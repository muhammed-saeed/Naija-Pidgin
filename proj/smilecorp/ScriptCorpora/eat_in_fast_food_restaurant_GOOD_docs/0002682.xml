 How my Mom Lost 55 Pounds On a Low Fat Vegan Diet 
 
 Share Email Print 
 
It’s often difficult to convince our loved ones to make changes that we know they desperately need to make to improve their health.

It’s even more difficult to see someone you love experience health problems in spite of knowing all of the right information and even accepting its validity!

I became a vegetarian at the age of 18 because of my mom, who at the time took an interest in healthier eating.

At the time, she was accumulating all sorts of great vegetarian and vegan recipe books and really tried to change her diet.

This is how I started my interest in vegetarianism. Soon after, I became a raw foodist! And over the years, I’ve never stopped my interest in healthy eating and natural health.

Even though my mom had me as an example and knew all of this information about healthy eating, she kept gaining weight every year!

Her weight kept going up and up to the point where she became obese.

I kept pushing her to make changes — and she even knew what changes to make — but a few things were holding her back:

 * She always used food as gratification and therefore delayed changing her diet .“Oh, I have a vacation next week so I can’t really do it now, but right after I come back from the vacation I’ll get started!”

 * She became confused about what to eat . Even though she started with the best intentions, conflicting dietary advice eventually got to her. She didn’t eat terribly bad, but the few mistakes she made were enough to tip the balance scale in the wrong direction!

 * She felt powerless . Even though I kept trying to help her, she told me,“You know what Frederic, don’t beat yourself up if you can’t change me. This is my problem… I know you’re trying hard. It’s not your fault, it’s mine.”

Over the years, I kept trying to help her.

One time, she even agreed to go 100% raw for a month. This had mostly positive results but she couldn’t stick to it.

She kept telling me that I did“everything I could”to try to help her and really the ball was in her camp now to change.

But deep inside, I felt like I hadn’t done everything I could. I didn’t give up.

When my dad died last year, it was a big shock to my mom. How could someone so young pass away so suddenly?

It was a wake up call. Here’s her at my wedding day, in 2010.

 

Shortly after, she visited me in Vancouver and spent a week there. During that time, I told her:

This week, you’re going to eat like us! I want to show you how easy it can be to eat healthy. And when you go back home to Montreal, I’ll put you on a program that will really make a difference.

Initially, she was reluctant.“I’m on vacation!”she complained.

But because she liked the food, it wasn’t so much of a struggle.

Between that and a few intense conversations, I managed to convince her to try a new approach.

When she got back home in September, she was on the program.

Every week, she would call me and tell me how much weight she lost! 10 pounds, 12, 15, 20… the weight just kept falling off effortlessly.

When I saw her in June, she was a transformed woman!

* She lost 55 pounds
* She went from a pre-diabetic condition to totally normal blood sugar
* All of her other markers (like cholesterol, etc.) are healthy now
* Instead of being tired walking long distances or hills, she now walks every day and has more energy than ever before

 

When you say that you can“totally transform your life,”it may sound a little cliché.

But lose 55 pounds, and I guarantee you that you’ll transform your life. Nothing will ever be the same. You’re not the same person anymore!

How Did My Mom Lose 55 pounds?

In the past, I tried to get her to eat more raw foods, try smoothies, and even go raw at times. But it didn’t work.

I realized:

 The raw food diet is great for a lot of people, but totally unrealistic for many. 

So I gave my plan a simple plan that worked. In essence, here’s what she did.

Forbidden Foods

I gave her a list of foods to“avoid.”this included:

 Dairy products (including yogurt, milk, cheese, etc.) 
 Meat 
 Chicken 
 Fish 
 Bread 
 Anything made with flour (except pasta) 
 Oil 
 Nuts, seeds, nut butters 
 Avocados, coconuts, olives 
 Refined sugars 

Foods to Eat

Then I gave her a list of foods to eat in unlimited quantities.

 Fruits 
 Vegetables, Salads 
 Beans, Legumes 
 Whole Grains 

And that’s it! Of course, more went into this, but this is the basic program.

My Mom’s Diet

My mom learned a few tricks of her own to make it work. One was to eat a late dinner, that way she would avoid late-night snacks. Her diet looks something like this:

 Breakfast: 
Oatmeal with a ton of fruit
 Lunch: 
Salad or nothing.
 Dinner (around 7 or 8 p.m.) 
A big starch+vegetable dinner, such as low fat vegan chili, morroccan couscous, and other recipes from the Low Fat Vegan Chef .
 After Dinner : After dinner, she generally has another big bowl of oatmeal with fruit, or just fruit, or sometimes low-fat cereal with almond milk

The Learning Curve

At first, it was a learning curve for her. She had to learn how to avoid the fat in most recipes. For example, she discovered how to make hummus without the usual tahini, and made it taste pretty good.

She tried a lot of recipes designed by my wife Veronica, such as the ones included in our Low Fat Vegan Comfort Soups recipe book .

She eventually learned to create recipes of her own.

My Mom’s Tips

My mom, who speaks only French, wanted to share a few tips for success with you.

 1) Keep it simple . Make a big batch of something and eat it throughout the week. Variety is often the enemy of success when it comes to weight loss. Find something you like and eat a lot of it.

 2) Eat the same thing for breakfast, every day .

 3) Always have in the fridge a big fruit salad. 

 3) Always have in a fridge cut vegetables and green salads. 

 4) You can use spinach leaves instead of“rice”as to eat under a recipe like vegan chili. 

 5) Don’t be afraid to eat a lot . You’ll lose weight anyway following this program.

 6) Always put more vegetables than the recipe calls for! 

Cheating

I knew my mom wouldn’t follow this diet 100%, and she didn’t. But she succeeded anyway. The difference was that when she“cheated,”it was truly when she had no choice in some social situations, and she made the best choice she could in the moment. Food was no longer about“reward.”If she wanted to have something forbidden, she waited for a time when she could truly enjoy it.

The Keys to Success

One key to success to my mom’s weight loss program was its simplicity. I just gave her a list of foods to eat and a list of foods to avoid.

I told her to walk more often, but did not bother her with exercise guidelines.

One key was the absolute avoidance of fat. She had enough essential fatty acids stored up for a lifetime, so I did not have her supplement with unnecessary essential“oils.”

Fat is an impediment to weight loss, much more so than sugar. Fat is concentrated calories that add almost nothing to your feeling of fullness, and can just as easily be skipped in most recipes. One tablespoon of white sugar is only 50 calories, compared to 120 in a tablespoon of any oil!

When someone needs to lose a lot of weight, they don’t need to consume any concentrated calories. That’s why I eliminated all nuts, seeds, avocados, olives, durian, and any other fatty food.

When she reaches her ideal weight (she still has 15 pounds to lose), then she may be allowed to have some fatty foods on occasion.

Unless you’re active and at your ideal weight, eating more fat is NOT the answer. Cutting it out completely may just be what you need.

From Obese to Healthy Weight in less than 8 months

I was shocked to discover that my mom went from being“obese”to only slightly overweight according to BMI guidelines in just eight months! In fact, she only has 6 pounds to lose at this point to be considered at a“normal weight”according to the BMI guidelines.

A healthy weight is one of the many rewards of a healthy lifestyle.

Raw food is one path to health, but it’s not the only path. Whatever you do, choose low fat plant foods. Optimize the amount of raw foods to your liking. Many people thrive on a 100% raw food diet, but it is unrealistic to expect everybody to be able to follow such a program. Others are happy with 80% raw, while many can do extremely well on even less raw food.

The key is to follow a low-fat, vegan diet free of refined and processed foods.

In this article I gave you a quick overview of my mom’s program for losing weight. Would you be interested in finding out everything else that went into it?

 As part of my Raw Vegan Mastery Program , I’ll be releasing a video called“How to Lose Weight on a Plant Based Diet”— This video will teach you not only exactly what you need to know, but will also show you practical recipes to get started.

 The Mistakes of Natural Hygiene: Part 1: Drugs and the Germ Theory 
 
 Share Email Print 
 
The Mistakes of Natural Hygiene, Part 1

Natural Hygiene is one of the health philosophies that influenced me the most. I first discovered the raw food diet through the writings of Albert Mosséri, who was a disciple of Herbert Shelton, who’s considered the grand-father of the modern Natural Hygiene movement.

When I first got into Natural Hygiene, I viewed it as quasi religion. It was such a paradigm shift that completely changed my world. I ended up accepting it completely after studying it carefully.

In my first few years as a raw foodist, I became extremely sick and it was only the Natural Hygiene concepts that saved me and helped me regain my health. ( I told the full story of what happened in my book Raw Food Controversies .)

I consider Natural Hygiene a great health philosophy that can have a tremendous, positive influence in your life. But because this health philosophy has been created by doctors and researchers that lived 50 to 150 years ago, it’s no longer fully up-to-date with modern science and research, and what we’ve discovered about the human body.

In this series of articles, I’ll be looking at the concepts of Natural Hygiene and dissecting them, one-by-one. Some of these concepts are still very accurate and healthful. Others are incorrect but still lead to positive results when applied. And finally, some concepts of Natural Hygiene are downright wrong.

What Is Natural Hygiene?

To understand Natural Hygiene, we must look at its history and how it came about. Natural Hygiene is essentially a health system that was developed in the last part of the 19th century by medical doctors who became disillusioned with the practice of medicine at the time.

Although Natural Hygiene had inspiration from European writers, it’s essentially an American system developed in the United States.

Natural Hygiene was known at the time as“Nature Cure”and later as“Orthopathy.”

Around the year 1850, medicine had made some great progress but was still very primitive compared to what it is today.

Doctors at the time had very little clue about what causes disease. Many harmful practices were common, such as:

 1) Bathing infrequently due to the false belief promoted by some doctors that bathing too often was bad for health. ( http://orthopathy.net/history.html ) 

 2) Recommending sick patients to eat a rich diet of meat, butter and other rich foods to“regain their strength.” 

 3) Bleeding and blood letting as a cure to disease remained popular ( http://rosemelnickmuseum.wordpress.com/2009/03/11/19th-century-doctors-in-the-us/ ) 

 4) Heroin was routinely prescribed for the common cough ( http://www.cracked.com/article_15669_the-10-most-insane-medical-practices-in-history.html ) 

 5) Many doctors did not wash their hands before performing surgery 

The first doctors that formulated the ideas behind Natural Hygiene were all very disillusioned with the practice of medicine in their times. Many had been sick themselves and unable to cure themselves through the“science”they had learned.

Those doctors included:

Dr. Issac Jennings (1788-1874)

Jennings is considered to be the father of Natural Hygiene. His trick was simple. He started giving his patients sugar pills as“placebos”and discovered that all of them recovered much faster than usual! He then developped the theory of“orthopathy”or“letting the body heal itself”through fasting. It also says something about the dangers of medicines at the time, when the word“placebo”wasn’t even well known.

Silvester Graham (1794-1851)

Graham was one of the most influential early hygienists. He was one of the first public figures to advocate vegetarianism and what he called“temperance.”We may remember him as the inventor of the graham cracker, but his contribution was much greater. His followers practiced the brushing of teeth, vegetarianism, sobriety, and eating whole foods (such as whole wheat bread instead of white flour)… all practices that we take for granted today, but were very controversial at the time.

Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (1852-1943)

You may remember this guy for inventing the“Kellogg Corn Flakes.”He was a devout Seventh Day Adventist who advocated a strict, sober, healthy life and fasting, which was called“water cure”at the time.

 Herbert Shelton (1895-1985) 

There were many more early natural hygienists part of that Nature Cure movement in the 19th century. But the movement was not unified until Herbert Shelton came along.

Shelton was born in 1895. In his youth, he became a passionate student of the writings of early Hygienists, and proceeded to consolidate all their theory into a unified philosophy he called“Natural Hygiene.”In his thirties, he wrote his giant book“Human Life, Its Philosophy and Laws.”

He then operated a health center in Texas where he practiced fasting and a clean, mostly raw food diet.

All of the modern Natural Hygiene movement stems from Shelton, although it gained even more popularity when T.C. Fry came along and later, when the book“Fit For Life”was released in the 1980s. All serious promoters of Natural Hygiene today are students of Shelton, who wrote more than 50 books.

The Natural Hygiene System

The basic principle of Natural Hygiene is self-healing.

Although Natural Hygiene has later been hijacked by authors such as Harvey Diamond who cherry-picked some ideas such as food combining, the basic principle of Hygiene has nothing to do with diet.

Here are the main concepts of Natural Hygiene, followed by some practical example.

 1) Self-Healing : The body has the ability to heal itself, when you get out of the way and provide it with what it needs. Suppressing symptoms is not treating the body. For example, while traditional doctors may provide a special“immunity enhancing diet”during a flu, or some drugs to suppress the symptoms, a Natural Hygienist will probably advise to simply rest as much as possible, don’t take drugs, eat as little as possible, possibly fast, and let the body recover naturally.

 2) Less Intervention . Although Natural Hygiene would not claim that it’s always wrong to intervene (for example, if someone breaks his leg), in general, for most diseases, they recommend to avoid giving drugs or natural treatments that are meant to suppress symptoms.

 3) Fasting . Fasting is a key component of Natural Hygiene because it is the ultimate physiological rest. The purpose behind fasting is to let the body heal itself by shutting down all the energy that goes into digestion and redirecting it towards healing. During a fever, or other acute diseases, Natural Hygienists would probably advise fasting as opposed to interventions or medicine, even if body temperature is high.

 4) Simplicity in eating . Natural Hygienists recommend a diet that’s as simple as possible. While not all agree on the details (such as eating 100% raw or not), most recommend simple vegetarian meals devoid of salt, condiments and spices.

 5) Fruitarianism . Almost all Natural Hygienists recommend fruit as the most pure, biologically-appropriate food one can eat.

How Do You Know If You’re a Natural Hygienist?

Some people call themselves Natural Hygienists, but in reality they are naturopaths. How do you know the difference?

This goes back to the principle of self-healing and non-intervention.

If you suffer from a common cold, a naturopath will probably recommend some kind of herb or tincture to“boost your immune system.”

A Natural Hygienist will instead recommend that you fast if you can, get as much rest as possible, drink water, and not take any particular remedy, whether natural or not.

A key principle of Natural Hygiene is to look for the cause and remove it, instead of suppressing symptoms with medicines, even if those come from natural sources.

Modern Natural Hygienists

As a movement, Natural Hygiene has essentially disintegrated. Hygiene saw a resurgence of interest after the publication of the book Fit For Life in the 80s, and many doctors at the time became modern Natural Hygienists. These doctors, such as Dr. Alan Goldhamer from the True North Health Center in California, still practice fasting but don’t necessarily identify themselves as“Natural Hygienists.”

The raw food movement, especially the 80/10/10 Diet by Dr. Douglas Graham, is also strongly influenced by Natural Hygiene. But now, there is no longer a true Natural Hygiene movement that is clearly identifiable. Many authors, myself included, have been influenced by Natural Hygiene, but don’t accept all of its philosophy blindly without question.

Where Natural Hygiene May Be Wrong

It would take a lot of time to go through the philosophy of Natural Hygiene. This was just a brief overview to attack the more specific issues.

Natural Hygiene, as a basic health philosophy, is very appealing and in my experience, works a lot of the time.

Where I think Natural Hygiene is wrong is in applying these principles no matter what, and never consider the state of science in 2012.

Natural Hygiene Mistake #1: Drugs

One principle of Natural Hygiene, as explained by Dr. Shelton in his book Natural Hygiene: Man’s Pristine Way of Life, is the idea that all drugs are toxic, and that’s why they work.

The classic example is that of the constipation drugs, even their herbal equivalent.

Shelton’s reasoning was as follows: drugs don’t really have an effect on the body. Why? Because if you’d give them to a dead person, nothing would happen.

It’s the BODY that has an effect on drugs. The body reacts to the drug given, and the result is our own interpretation of this principle in action.

Let’s say someone suffers from constipation. The drug given will actually provoke a mild form of diarrhea. Is it the drug that’s acting on the body? The drug in itself, Shelton explained, does nothing. You have to give it to a living organism.

However, because it’s a drug and it’s toxic, the body cannot use it as nutrition. It wants to get rid of it. In the process, several things can happen.

In the case of the constipation drug, the body wants to eliminate it through stools, and that’s why users of this drug find relief.

Did the drug cure them of their constipation? No. Instead, it was a toxic substance that the body wanted to eliminate. In the process, it caused diarrhea and eliminated it along with the stools.

That’s a simplistic explanation, but you get the idea.

Shelton believed that ALL drugs were toxic and did not have a specific effect, chemical or other, on the body. In fact, it was always the body reacting to the drug, and in the process eliminating a symptom or another.

Although Shelton was right to say that all drugs are toxic to some degree, he was wrong in his simplistic explanation of their action on the body.

Many drugs actually work through complex chemical and hormonal reactions in the body. Here are some examples:

 1) Aspirin . Pain is something that is felt in the brain. Aspirin works by inhibiting an enzyme that produces prostaglandins, substances similar to hormones that trigger inflammation in the body. Aspirin binds itself to the enzyme, changing its chemical structure and blocking the reaction that produces the prostaglandins.

 2) Prozac . Many anti-depressants like prozac will work due to their effects on serotonin levels. Low serotonin is associated with depression and anxiety. Due to a complex process, Prozac works by increasing the amount of serotonin that can be delivered to the cells. That’s why Prozac is part of a class of drugs called“Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (or SSRIs).

We could go on an on with more examples, but you get the idea.

Yes, drugs are toxic.

But no, they don’t ALWAYS work through the simplistic idea that the body is working in some manner to“eliminate”or“reject”them. In some cases, they can literally alter complex chemical reactions taking place in the body.

Natural Hygiene Mistake #2: The Germ Theory

Another area where Natural Hygiene is dead wrong is the belief that contagion of disease is essentially a myth.

Even though Shelton and others always claimed that diseases like the flu were essentially the body’s efforts to detoxify itself, I was never fully convinced.

Even T.C. Fry had some interesting discussion on viruses and why he believed that they could not cause disease and were essentially“a scam.”

I was never fully convinced because my own experience, like that of most people, contradicted with this teaching of Natural Hygiene.

Everybody has had the experience of coming in contact with someone with a common cold and then contracting the disease or ailment shortly after.

Typically the pattern is always the same:

 - You haven’t been sick for a while 
 –People around you may be sick, but you’re not. 
 –After spending time in a crowded area where lots of people are sick, someone around you, like your wife/husband or roommate, comes down with the cold 
 –A day after, you get the cold yourself. 

I remember when I was living in Costa Rica in 2006, working at retreat center I had tried to purchase. We had a little community of people living onsite, and one day people started getting sick with the stomach flu. It was amazing to see everyone get sick, one after the other, with the exact same symptoms.

I naively thought I would be immune from this, but I also ended up being bed-ridden for 2-3 days. Granted, at the time I was under tremendous stress and my immune system was probably greatly compromised, but there was no doubt that the disease was contagious and of viral nature. In fact, during that time, a significant percentage of the town where I lived got sick with the same stomach flu.

Generally, I agree with Natural Hygiene in their treatment of viral diseases. It’s much better to recover while fasting, resting and drinking plenty of water, than the usual treatments.

However, their explanation of disease as always being an attempt for the body to“heal itself”through some sort of crisis is flawed, to say the least.

I don’t think I want to go into a big debate about the Germ Theory, since viral science is quite complex. Times have evolved since Shelton’s days, and we now know more about viruses and their action on the body.

A Personal Experience

A great book to read on the topic of immunity is Dr. Fuhrman’s recent Super Immunity. In this book, you’ll discover exactly what you can do to increase your immunity natural.

After reading Fuhrman’s book, I realized that I had not gotten sick for a long time. I could not even remember the last time I had a cold!

When I was traveling around the world, there were a time or two that I felt I was almost coming down with symptoms of the cold, but after a day or so it was over, and I did not even get a runny nose or anything.

So recently I started bragging about the fact that I could not remember the last time I had a cold. Then my wife made an interesting observation. She said:

 “Fred, you work at home. You don’t come in contact with large crowds of people. You mostly work at home or in an office downtown where you don’t shake hands with anybody. When most people get sick, during the winter, you stay in the tropics. You rarely take public transportation and you don’t touch communal areas. Maybe that’s part of the reason why you never get the cold.” 

I thought that was interesting, but I didn’t think about it too much.

Then recently, my wife and I attended a health conference in California with 250 people in the room. I should have paid attention when I heard lots of people coughing in the room. But because I felt fine and I was with supposedly“healthy”people, I didn’t think about it twice.

I shook hands with lots of people that weekend. And guess what? As soon as I got back home, my wife got sick with the cold. Then I started feeling symptoms of the cold myself! I got a sore throat and felt tired. Typical common cold, except that I got almost no mucus compared to most people.

This was over quickly, but I’m quite certain that coming in contact with this many people and getting the cold was no coincidence.

Let me just go through some practical tips and ideas.

 1) You Can Increase Your Immunity Naturally . Natural Hygiene is not totally wrong on viral diseases. You can certainly increase your immunity naturally by eating a diet composed mostly of fruits and vegetables and avoiding processed foods.

 2) If You’re Healthy, Symptoms Will Be Milder . If you do get sick, you’ll likely experienced a much more suppressed form of the disease than most people. And it will likely be over sooner.

 3) You Don’t Need Drugs to Recover . To recover from most viral illnesses, you don’t need drugs. Natural Hygiene is right to recommend for the disease to“follow its course”and for you to simply provide the right environment to allow for maximum healthful recovery.

 4) Fasting May Help . In some cases, fasting may help you recover from viral illnesses.

 This is the first part in a series of articles on Natural Hygiene. Stay tuned and please post your comments below!

 Should All Condiments Be Banned on Low Fat Raw Vegan? 
 
 Share Email Print 
 
 When I first went raw in 1997, I quickly discovered delicious gourmet raw food cuisine.

Unfortunately for my health, the raw cuisine promoted at the time (and still in vogue today), was filled with raw fats and condiments.

For example, in one big personal salad, I could have included:

- Several tablespoons of olive oil
- An entire avocado ( or two )
- A handful of pine nuts or walnuts
- Soy sauce
- Onions, garlic, etc.

These salads were satisfying, but left me extremely tired after eating them. No wonder: I was consuming most of my calories from fat!

In fact, these salads contained more fat that a typical value meal at McDonald’s.

Over the years that followed, I went to another“extreme,”by going back to a lower-fat diet and eliminating all condiments completely.

In my book The Raw Secrets , I even spoke against common condiments such as garlic and hot peppers.

 But where do I stand today? 

One of the biggest problems I’ve always had with the raw food diet is the inability to enjoy simple, raw salads.

No matter how much I tried to convince myself that a salad consisting of a romaine lettuce, some tomatoes and half an avocado was extremely healthy, I simply did not enjoy it!

For years, I stood staunchly with my“no-condiment”policy, avoiding raw garlic at all costs and minimizing my use of condiments in any raw recipes.

I had no problems eating simple fruit meals and smoothies…but when it came to vegetables, I just didn’t enjoy them as much without some kind of seasonings.

Many raw foodists make an effort to eat everything 100% raw, while worrying about little things, such as whether the dried herbs they are using are truly raw.

Over the years, I have found that it’s better to make some compromises and actually enjoy your food than try to stick with an impossible-to-follow ideal.

Some people are perfectly happy eating a bowl of romaine lettuce and a few tomatoes for dinner. But most people — myself included — would feel pretty dissatisfied after eating such a boring meal.

 So should you avoid all condiments? And if you do use them, should they be 100% raw? 

I believe that it’s the big things that matter, not the little things.

Having a few relatively healthy condiments on an overall healthy meal is NO BIG DEAL, even if some of these products are not 100% raw.

Don’t miss the forest for the trees.“Better”is the enemy of the good, sometimes!

That being said, here are some condiments you can use, regularly or occasionally, to add enjoyment to your raw food meals:

- Homemade Seasonings: I showed how to make healthy condiments out of dehydrated vegetables in my DVD series,“ The Low Fat Raw Vegan Cuisine .”The idea is simple: dehydrate pieces of celery, bell peppers, cabbage or any other vegetables. Then turn them into a powder in a VitaMix or coffee grinder. These powders add a lot of taste to salads and dressings!

- Garlic: A lot of raw recipes taste incredibly better with a little garlic, for example a guacamole dish. The trick is to only use a little. When you blend garlic, you oxidize it and make it less strong. I don’t eat raw garlic daily, but my wife uses it in some recipes. I must say that I don’t experience any negative effects from occasional garlic use.

- Green Onions: Any salad or raw soup tastes better with green onions (also called spring onions)!

- Thai Chili: I must admit that I do love spiciness, even though I come from a background of natural hygiene. Certain recipes, especially if they are Asian-inspired, can be made incredibly tastier and more authentic with a little spiciness to them, such as from Thai chili pepper. The trick is to use fresh ingredients, and not hot sauces, which tend to affect the body more negatively due to everything else they contain.

- Chipotle Powder (by Frontier ): This organic seasoning by Frontier is great for those who like a little spiciness. It really adds a kick to a salad or Savory Veggie Stew, even though it’s not raw.

- Salad Sprinkle (by Frontier ): A great addition for some kick to your everyday salad.

- Chinese Five Spice (by Frontier ): Includes the flavors of sweet, sour, salty, bitter and spicy for a great addition to any Asian creation.

- Mexican Fiesta (by Frontier ): For any Mexican-style dish that needs a little more seasoning than just the spicy taste.

- Herbamare: This is a seasoning found in health food stores that contains salt. The raw vegan diet is very low in salt, therefore using a sprinkle of a salty seasoning on top of a salad will not put you in a terrible risk bracket for salt consumption. Most of the raw recipes I make taste pretty good without salt, but sometimes adding a tiny bit makes the difference between an“okay”recipe and a great one.

- Ceylon Cinnamon (soon to be available from us): Tastes WAY better than cassia (regular) cinnamon and has a natural sweet, bright, and not-dry flavor. It’s great in raw dishes, smoothies and puddings.

- Tahitian Vanilla (soon to be available from us too): Larger, more fragrant and soft and flexible, unlike bourbon vanilla. This means you can use it in raw dishes easily by scraping out the seeds and even make your own organic vanilla extract at home!

If you truly enjoy the foods you’re eating, I don’t recommend to“add”anything to make it better. But sometimes having a few seasonings can really make a difference and make the program much easier to follow and enjoyable.

Remember that the body adapts pretty quickly. If you never eat any onions or garlic, you’ll probably feel strange eating them. But if you eat them fairly regularly in small quantities in recipes, your body adapts to it and they no longer bother you.

The trick is to enjoy your food…and be healthy!

Ex-Vegans Speak Out

One phenomenon we’ve been noticing lately, probably more notably due to social media technologies like blogs and Facebook, is how many ex-vegans are coming out to share their experience on why they stopped being vegan after many years, often due to health problems that occurred on a vegan diet that were quickly resolved with the re-introduction of animal foods.

There’s even a website, www.letthemeatmeat.com, that interviews these ex-vegans.

In addition to the casual experience of these ex-vegans, we also have many raw food authors who used to be vegan for a number of years, but now include some animal products in their diet.

(…)

Common Problems

By reviewing the stories of ex-vegans, I have identified a few common problems that some people have run into.

Sometimes, they were able to solve these problems with proper supplementation or a chance for another raw vegan diet (such as a low-fat one), but the problems I will list below are strictly limited to the people who did not find any improvement in supplementation or (for some who have tried it) low fat veganism.

Of course, this is purely anecdotal and it’s impossible to accurately decide what actually happened in every case (versus what they said happened). However, I believe it would be a little close-minded to totally dismiss these stories as arising from “anorexic” people who “didn’t do the diet properly.”
Dental Problems

This is mostly common in raw-foodists, who tend to have more dental problems than the general population. I discussed the reasons in my book Raw Food Controversies.

Essentially, the low-caloric density of the diet encourages frequent snacking on sugary foods (like fruit), which promotes decay. Eliminating snacking and eating actual meals is a key element in preventing dental problems on a raw food diet. Strict dental hygiene is required as well.

Some vegans report an increase in dental decay on a vegan diet, but I suspect that’s simply because they’re eating more refined carbohydrates like flour, cookies and vegan junk foods.

Low Sex Drive

This symptom is not common, but happens to some men who go raw. Most vegan men don’t complain about low sex drive. In my opinion, that’s mostly limited to men who follow a fat-free diet (with no overt fats), undereat calories, and exercise too much and too often. This is completely preventable.

Lack of Energy

I’ve met a lot of “tired vegans,” and I used to be one of them, although I experienced this symptom on a high-fat, raw vegan diet. People complained about feeling exhausted and needing to have frequent naps to recover.

In vegans, I attribute this mostly to the overconsumption of grains (especially refined grains and flower-based products) and oils, under consumption of fruit and underconsumption of total calories.

In raw vegans, it’s caused by a high-fat diet and the underconsumption of fruit or a calorie restrictive diet.

Lack of Stamina

Many ex-vegans report that when they were on a vegan diet, often after a few years, they lost stamina to exercise. For example, in the past they could work out for 60 minutes on the treadmill, and before they broke their vegan diet, they were finding it hard to do more than 20 minutes, and often needed all day to recover.

I would attribute this in most cases to the same causes for lack of energy, but also possibly to a vitamin B12 deficiency.

Constantly Hungry

This symptom is common in vegans but even worse in raw foodists. It’s easily explained by the fact that plant foods are not as calorie-dense as animal foods, and also carbohydrates don’t satiate as much as protein-based foods.

Vegans and raw foodists need to eat more, but also fill their sweet tooth with fruit, which tends to eliminate most of the cravings by providing the simple carbohydrates the body desperately needs.

Hair Falling Out

This is a symptom that tends to happen mostly to raw vegan women who go on a very low fat diet or tend to drop weight rapidly. To avoid this issue, I would encourage an increased consumption of omega-3 rich foods such as flax, walnuts and hemp seeds, even if this brings you above 15% fat. Lower the fat content in the diet progressively, not overnight.

Depression

This is probably the most common extreme symptom that vegans experience that lead them to change their diets. As we’ll see below, it could simply be caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency.

Ice Cold Extremities

Some vegans and many raw foodists experience cold feet and end and often attribute it to poorer circulation on this diet. I don’t know that it’s the case, but I’ve found that as long as I exercise daily, my body stays very warm (ask my wife if you want proof!)

Vitamin B12 Deficiency

This deficiency is common in long-term vegans, but also common in the meat-eating population.

Besides severe nervous system degeneration problems, a B12 deficiency can cause fatigue, depression and “brain fog,” which could explain many of the failures of the ex-vegans who tend to feel instantly better when they start eating meat again.

A good supplement is the best way to prevent a B12 deficiency, but perhaps some individuals cannot absorb the supplement optimally and therefore feel the best results when they get their B12 from animal foods.

Eggs and dairy products are generally a poor source of B12, which would explain why the ex-vegans feel so much better when they start eating meat or fish again (just a few ounces of fish provides enough B12 for about two days). (NOTE: I recommend the B12 supplement over animal-source B12).

Hypothyroidism

This is a more rare symptom that could be caused by a diet rich in raw cruciferous vegetables (like cabbage, broccoli, etc.) that contain thyroid inhibitors known as goitrogens. In some sensitive individuals, consuming a lot of these vegetables can cause thyroid problems.

The simple solution for those with a pre-existing hypothyroid condition is to avoid these raw cruciferous vegetables, or steaming them instead.

 Do Raw Foodists Have an Eating Disorder like Orthorexia? 
 
 Share Email Print 
 
 A few years ago, I did an interview with Dr. Steven Bratman, M.D., who wrote the book“Health Food Junkies,”which was his personal story of how he became so fixated with healthful eating that eventually his quality of life diminished.

The book also talked about some people that Steven met that became so obsessed with health foods that some of them got really sick or even died.

In my interview, Dr. Bratman confessed that the book did not become very popular, because the average person did not care about crazy health foodists, while the“health food junkies”that he talked about were not going to buy a book on the subject.

So the book is now out of print, but the term“orthorexia”that Bratman introduced in his book is now something you’ll hear once in a while.

Orthorexia comes from the Greek word “ortho” which means “right or correct”, and “orexia” which means “eating”, so it’s righteous eating; a fixation in eating. He defines orthorexia as an obsession with eating healthy food, and avoiding unhealthy food.

To Steven Bratman,“orthorexia”is a mental disorder similar but different to anorexia.“Orthorexia”is the specific obsession with food and bodily“purity,”not weight and appearance.

So while an anorexic person might starve herself just to look skinny, the orthorexic could decide to gorge on avocados, or go on a 6-month coconut water fast, depending on what they feel will most“purify”their bodies.

Is there such thing as“orthorexia”or an actual obsession with healthful eating?

When I interviewed Steven Bratman, he seemed convinced that there was very little evidence that eating junk food such as potato chips or even steak was actually bad for you.

It seemed to me that because he was so obsessed with food quality in the past, he took it to the other extreme by not caring at all about what he eats now.

However, I do think that some people can get a little too obsessed with food and the ideal of“purity”that they end up hurting themselves.

As I talked about in my new book Raw Food Controversies, I even met people that died due to their unhealthful obsession with purity.

 

I think that while some people go totally loco with this obsession with diet, many others go the other way and don’t care at all about what they eat much like the general public.

And we know what that brings: diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, not to mention that this poor diet is the main reason why most people feel so tired and terrible most of the time.

So it does make sense to care about what you eat and want to improve your health with raw foods, green smoothies and fasting, but it’s important to keep things in the right perspective.

To me, the biggest problem that I see with raw foodists and other“health foodists”is that they don’t have their priorities right.

Many people obsess about little details such as making sure everything they eat is absolutely 100% raw and organic and spend considerable time, money and energy in doing so, while at the same time undo all the benefits by making BIG mistakes such as eating too much fat or not exercising at all.

Some people are so obsessed with diet that they find it becomes their primary preoccupation: they can’t stop thinking about what they’re going to eat, and experience anxiety if they are in a situation where their dietary needs can’t be met so they spend most of their time eating at home alone out of fear.

Others always feel like their diet is not“good enough,”going from a fairly strict raw food diet to one that eliminates ALL fats, spices, and condiments and eventually many of these people do so much fasting, cleansing and detox that they end up depleting their bodies to the point of no return.

Do you see where I’m going with this? Healthful eating is healthful, as long as we keep things in perspective.

Steven Bratman wrote in his book: “When an orthorexic falls off the path, the only remedy is an act of penitence, which usually involves stricter diets or even fasting to cleanse away the traces of unhealthy foods.”

He also says: “Whereas the bulimics and anorexics focus on the quantity of food, the orthorexic fixates on its quality. All three – the bulimic, anorexic, and orthorexic – give to food a vastly excessive place in the scheme of life”.

How can you tell if you’re an orthorexic person?

Try it now, for fun!

Give yourself a point for each question. The more points you accumulate, the more“orthorexic”you are :

 1. Do you spend more than three hours a day thinking about healthy food? If you do, give yourself a point; if you spend more, give yourself two points.
 2. Do you plan tomorrow’s food, today? So, do you think in advance “what am I going to eat tomorrow?”.
 3. Do you care more about the virtue of what you eat, rather than the pleasure you get from eating it.
 4. Have you found that as the quality of your diet increased, the quality of your life has diminished?
 5. Do you keep getting stricter with yourself?
 6. Do you sacrifice experiences you once enjoyed, to eat the foods you believe are right?
 7. Do you feel a sense of self-esteem when you eat healthy food; do you look down on others who don’t?
 8. Do you feel guilt or self-loathing when you stray from your diet?
 9. Does your diet socially isolate you?
 10. When you are eating the way you are supposed, do you feel a peaceful sense of total control?

When I look at the questionnaire above, I can honestly say that there was a point in my life where I would have answered“yes”to almost every single question.

I used to think about food all the time, to the point where it would be my main topic of conversation with EVERYONE. I tried all kinds of strict“detox”diets, hoping to finally experience the benefits promised to me by the raw food gurus, but nothing worked!

In fact, with time, I became sicker and sicker. In fact, I was so obsessed with this ideal of raw foodism, but at the same time filled with cravings and felt unsatisfied, that I was having dreams of eating cooked junk foods.

In one dream, I remember eating a giant chocolate cake, and waking up the next morning feeling so guilty, as if I had just killed somebody!

That is just not healthy!

Now, even though I do still think it’s important to have some measure of control over your diet and not fall for the“everything in moderation”including junk food trap, don’t be so obsessed about your diet that your decisions are driven by an ideal rather than good common sense. For example:

 1) Don’t just eat anything and everything because it’s“raw”
 2) Don’t refuse to eat something that’s not organic, IF the alternative food is less healthy. A commercial banana is still better than“organic”soy ice-cream or organic raw cheesecake. Organic fat or junkfood is still junk.
 3) Don’t think that just because you value healthful living, that everyone else feels the same way and that you’re somehow better and more“enlightened”than them. This just alienates your friends and family.
 4) Compare yourself with yourself, rather than with others such as raw food“gurus”.
 5) Realize that it’s okay to give yourself goals, but sometimes fall off the wagon and pick yourself up again. It’s just part of the process.
 6) Stay a bit flexible in your approach, and be open to new ideas. You will never learn anything new with a closed mind.
 7) Treat others and yourself with dignity and respect. Food is only one aspect of your life!

What’s your own experience with“orthorexia?”

 Eating Raw, Vegan and Vegetarian in Greece and the Greek Islands

Temple of Haphaestus in Athens
 
by Veronica Grace Patenaude

Greece is unlike any other place in the world. It is a place that has always fascinated me since I was a child and I often dreamed of going to ancient sites and gazing upon ruins built by an ancient civilization that was so advanced for its time. Fortunately for us, so many ruins and texts (such as the Iliad and the Odyssey) have withstood time and can still be enjoyed by people from all over the world today.

It is definitely a place you should consider visiting at least once in your lifetime.

Greece is a country where even the smallest of islands and remotest of places will have beautiful temples dedicated to any number of the pantheon of gods of Mount Olympus. They would often choose the highest plains on which to build a temple to their chosen god. The most famous of all is the Parthenon for the goddess Athena at the Acropolis of Athens as well as the Oracle at Delphi for the god Apollo.

The Greeks (after the Egyptians) were one of the first civilizations to ponder the creation of the universe. The most widely accepted version is reported by Hesiod in his writing the Theogony. It begins with Chaos, a yawning nothingness. Out of the void emerged Eurynome also known as Gaia (the Earth) and some other primary divinities: Eros (Love), the Abyss (Tartarus) and Erebus. Gaia gave birth to Oranos (the Sky) who then fertilized her. From their union were born the Titans, six males: Coeus, Crius, Cronus, Hyperion, Iapetus and Oceanus and six females: Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Rhea, Theia, Themis and Tethys. Cronus was the last Titan to be born because he was the most terrible of all of Gaia’s children and he ended up castrating his father and became the ruler of all the gods with his sister-wife Rhea.

You may have heard of Cronus, as he is the father of the almighty Zeus, the ruler of all the gods at Mt. Olympus who overthrew him with the help of the Cyclops and banished him along with the other Titans into the Abyss (Tartarus), a dungeon in the underworld for all eternity.

Although these tales are purely mythological it is interesting that so many beliefs have stemmed from Greek origins, such as the name Gaia for the Earth, being the mother of all living things. And the underworld being a dark place of torment and suffering.

We also have the Greek philosophers such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle to thank for shaping the entire thought of Western Civilization today. All of which have had an immense effect on our beliefs about the world as we perceive it.

So the Greeks earned some well deserved respect from us on our travels!

 But It’s All Greek To Me! 

“Why would I travel to Greece? I don’t speak let alone read Greek!”you might exclaim.

Fear not, Greek is not an intimidating as you think and you will miss out on a great culture, country and ancient history if you let this deter you.

In Greece, you will see the Greek alphabet everywhere. And unless you are only staying for a day or two, you really should spend a few minutes going over the Greek characters, as you will find it very useful when deciphering road signs and menus if you plan on stepping anywhere outside of your resort haven where everyone speaks English. Even so, after about an hour of practice (in total) you should have no problem deciphering some basic Greek.

Here’s a quick look at the Greek Alphabet, it’s translation into Roman characters to help you read Greek signage.
 
Fred and a local Greek try to decipher ancient inscriptions at Delphi
 
 Do I Really Have to Learn Greek? 

 
 [/caption] 

The answer is no, you don’t HAVE to learn Greek. Any tourist place you are going will have more than enough locals that speak both Greek and English. Generally if they didn’t learn English they’d have a hard time communicating with the rest of the world since few people who are not Greek, speak Greek and fewer still can read it outside of Greece itself.

Fred found Greek a little more challenging than let’s say Italian, but after the learning curve of the Greek alphabet and a few new sounds it actually became enjoyable for him. A lot of English and even German words have Greek roots, as the Romans read and spoke Greek fluently and integrated a lot of their words into their vocabulary. If you are going to spend a few weeks there, it definitely comes in handy and anyone you talk to in Greek will light up and be astounded that you took the time to learn their language for such a short visit.

 Here are some Greek phrases to help you break the ice, or get along with the locals (using the Roman alphabet). 

Excuse me–Signomi

Do you speak English?–Miláte angliká?

Do you understand English?–Katalavenetay angliká?

Where is _____? Pou eneh _____?

I am vegetarian–Emeh hortofágos

Can I order this without milk or cheese?–Boró na parangelo aftó horís gála í tyrí?

Can I order this without meat or fish?–Boró na parangelo aftó horís kréas í psári?

Greek salad with no feta cheese please–Ellinikí saláta me féta den parakaloúme

I’d like a fruit plate please–Tha íthela éna piáto froúton parakaló

Is there cheese in this?–Eínai tyrí se aftó?

 Greek Restaurant Types 
 
 Tavernas are the standard eatery you will find whether you’re in a city or in the middle of nowhere. They’re usually owned by a family and will cook some traditional Greek dishes along with more westernized touristy dishes. Quite often you can tell a place is a Taverna if it has a chalkboard out front with daily specials and a menu with pictured dishes down the side. These places are fairly inexpensive if you stick to fruit plates, salads, beans, soups, side dishes, and dips.

What Taverna’s offer on the menu and what they have available are two different things, generally if you are at an establishment frequented by locals and not just tourists there will be different items offered based on days of the week or season. Often there will be a few vegetarian friendly dishes available, but not every item listed on the menu. Always ask, as the kitchen can sometimes modify and they generally have daily specials as well.

 Gyros and Souvlakias are fast food style stands that generally sell shaved meat in a pita bread, kebabs, fries and occasionally falafel and “tost” (a toasted half baguette). Not really worth checking out for vegetarian fare.

An Estiatorio is a more upscale type of Greek restaurant. These will feature more high end menu items, most likely fresh seafood dishes along with traditional Greek vegetarian friendly starters and side dishes. There will not be any pictures of dishes here, so make sure to ask about certain ingredients if you have any doubts. Almost all items on these menus are available every day and are made to order. If you ask what can be made vegan or vegetarian you will be fine.

 Greek Produce and Food 

I’d have to say that while Italy was bursting with fresh, delicious local produce, Greece was not. Yes there was produce, but it did not seem like the Greeks were as proud of their fruit, as let’s say their olive oil and yogurt. Quite often we would find that produce was not as good as the shop keeper said it would be and it just wasn’t as flavorful as it could have been. This is probably due to several reasons, the fact that Greece is going through some hard times, the produce sellers are not sampling all of their produce and people have switched what was once a largely plant based Mediterranean diet into a meat and dairy based diet with copious amounts of olive oil on EVERYTHING.

While the Italians are proud of quality olive oil, they just don’t douse everything they eat and cook every dish in oil like the Greeks do and it’s probably due to the fact that olive oil was such a staple export for the country even as far back as the Minoan civilization on Crete in the 15th Century BC. Even through times of scarcity, the Greeks could depend on olive oil to help feed their families as it’s much higher in calories than fruits or vegetables and lasts longer than fresh meat. It is seen as flavoring and main cooking oil and the idea of eating a low fat diet has not reached Greek shores.

Just know that anything you order at a Taverna or other Greek establishment will likely be cooked in or flavored with LOTS of olive oil, and ( just like Italy) there is no other salad dressing available, unless you don’t mind eating your Greek Salad naked!

 Deciphering Vegan Items on a Greek Menu 

 
 
Typical Greek Taverna menu
 
 

You may come across some of these traditional Greek dishes if you visit a taverna.

 Appetizers: 

Gigantes–baked broad beans (butter beans) generally in a sweet onion tomato sauce; occasionally you will find different variations.

Fava–blended chickpeas or split peas garnished with olive oil and served as a dip for bread.

Dolmades–lemon flavored rice stuffed vine leaves.

Skordalia–a dip made with garlic and olive oil blended with either potatoes, stale bread or nuts. *Some recipes include eggs, so ask.

 Entrees: 

Yemista–stuffed tomatoes or peppers generally filled with meat, rice and onion tomato sauce, occasionally you will see these offered without meat.

Melitzanes Papoutsakia (eggplant“little shoes”)–stuffed with tomatoes and onions, sometimes topped with cheese–ask.

Briam–chunks of zucchini, potatoes and eggplant with (or without cheese), seasoned with tomato sauce and olive oil baked in an oven.

Imam–eggplant, onions and tomatoes baked in an oven.

 Side Dishes: 

Skordia–mashed potatoes pureed with garlic.

Chorta/Xorta–boiled bitter greens seasoned with lots of olive oil and lemon juice.

Eating Raw, Vegan and Vegetarian in Athens
 
The Erechtheum on the Acropolis
 
Our first stop in Greece was to Athens, one of the worlds oldest cities which has had a history dating back 3,400 years! Athens has gone through many growth spurts and declinations over the centuries. The latest of which was in the 1920s when Athens’population ballooned to over 700,000 people.

Today, the Larger Urban Zone of Athens is estimated to have almost 5 million people living in it! Athens is also the 4th most populous city in the European Union. So let’s just say that Athens is indeed a very sprawling, and somewhat crowded city.

We stayed in the downtown area of Athens near Plaka. If you come to Athens, EVERYONE will be talking about and referencing Plaka. Basically it is the old neighborhood of Athens that surrounds the Acropolis on the northern and eastern sides. Plaka was developed around the Ancient Agora of Athens, which the ruins of can still be seen to this day. You will likely be doing most of your sightseeing and shopping in this area as there are many old buildings, ruins, and churches along with markets, vendors and restaurants. All of it is walkable all the way up to the Parthenon at the top of the Acropolis where you get an amazing view of the city below.

 The Plaka Flea Market 

If you want high end shopping head to to Ermou Street, the most famous of all shopping streets in Greece. Many a tourist has shopped til they dropped here!

For everything else go to the Monastariki Flea market, it’s is another name for the Plaka market. It offers a series of small shops where you can find any kind of knickknacks, antiques, souvenirs and street food from local vendors. It’s open every day of the week.

However, if you want to buy strictly produce you will have to go to the market early on weekdays, because it closes on Saturday afternoon and is not open at all on Sunday (much to our dismay as we spent two weekends in Athens). Other vendors are open, just not produce stands on Sundays.

If you do not shop at the Plaka market, you will be hard pressed to find a decent grocery store to buy produce at. It is possible to find a few small fruit stands throughout the downtown area, but the variety of fruit is limited. Check out this page on The Laiki Markets of Athens for a list of all the community markets and their days : http://www.greecefoods.com/farmers-markets/index.htm 

 Why Aren’t There Any Grocery Stores in Athens? 
 
Fruit stand in Athens
 
You might exclaim this in frustration if you have trekked up and down every street in search of a place to buy some“real”food.

The answer is: I don’t really know. But it seems that Athenians like to buy their produce fresh and buy it all once a week at their community market in their area (which is usually on a week day) and then they use convenience stores and small shops for dried and canned goods. There are a scarce few grocery stores, we found one called Bazaar in the downtown area and another small health food store attached to the Vegetarian Fast Food restaurant on Panepistimiou.

Basically most tourists use Athens as a short stop over city for either flying in or flying out, and usually throw in a half day trip to the Acropolis or a full day trip to the Oracle at Delphi. (Both of which, are highly recommended.)

 Athens Sights 

 The Parthenon 

It goes without saying that this is one of the most famous Greek ruins, almost everyone has either heard of it or seen it’s iconic picture. It was used as a great temple to the goddess Athena whom which Athens was named after and is the main building of the huge complex on top of the Acropolis. You can either walk up to the Acropolis yourself and pay for admission at the top, or go on an organized half day tour which includes admission to the Acropolis and the New Acropolis Museum along with a guided group tour. It is very hot at the top under the full sun, unless you go in the morning or evening, or on an overcast day. Admission: adults 12 euros, children 6 euros. For more information on the Parthenon go here http://www.athensguide.com/acropolis.html .

 The New Acropolis Museum just opened up and boasts a state of the art building design that showcases many ruins of the ancient city throughout the centuries. Literally the floor is just plexi-glass and completely see through, so you can gaze down through the stories to the ground below. It’s definitely worth checking out. The only downer is that about half of the best statues and friezes are actually at the British Museum in London, as they were plundered by the Duke of almost a century ago. Needless to say, the Brits don’t feel like returning them any time soon. So if you get a chance to go to London, you’ll want to make sure you see the Acropolis section as it’s quite impressive and it’s free. I’m glad we were able to see this earlier on our European trip.

For hours and admission prices for all the sites in Athens check out http://www.athensinfoguide.com/open.htm for more information.

You should have no problem viewing these monuments within a day or two.

Other than that, you should probably head out of town to either explore the more northern areas of Greece or head to Piraeus port for some Greek Island hopping, like we did.

 Vegetarian Restaurant in Athens: 

There is one vegetarian restaurant in Athens, although a little pricey, they do offer fresh juices and a number of vegan dishes. Granted, if it’s just vegan food you’re after, any taverna should have a few staples like giantess (broad beans), salads, lava, eggplant etc, for a little less.

Greek Island Hopping
 
Near Little Venice in Mykonos
 
We chose a travel agent to book all of our island hopping for our first trip to Greece. While it definitely saved us time, headaches and stress, it is also a little pricier than booking yourself. We chose Fantasy Travel and all of the hotels we stayed in offered a complimentary breakfast. While it wasn’t exactly a vegan friendly package, we were able to squeeze out a little bit of fruit for breakfast each day from the sparse continental buffets and then supplemented with our own stash in the hotel room.

*If you have some time to research what islands you want to see for sure and read a few reviews on hotels you can definitely plan it yourself, just make sure that you know the ferry schedule or buy all of your ferry tickets in advance when you get to Athens.

 Wait…Why is everything closed? Oh it must be“Greek Siesta Time”! 

On the islands you may notice from 2 to 5 or 6 pm most shops are closed as well as restaurants. The reason is, that almost all Greeks take a siesta during that time, leave work and close up for a 2 or 3 hour nap. (Yeah, don’t we all wish…) Smaller hotels can also close their reception areas during this time as well, so take note. Also make sure that you either have lunch with you or eat before 2 pm as you will be hard pressed to find much vegetarian friendly food until after 7 pm when everything opens back up again.

*Most Greeks eat dinner between 9 pm and Midnight and you will generally only see tourist restaurants with diners between 6:30 and 8:30 pm.

 Mondays in Greece 

While most of Europe enjoys closing up shop on Sundays, (including Athens) a lot of the tourist places are open on Sundays and closed on Monday mornings, or all day. So just make sure you double check everything will be open if you end up on a Greek island on a Monday.

 Cats! Cats! Everywhere! 

You will find cats all over the Greek islands.  Most are very friendly, some are garbage raiding alley cats, but they are everywhere. I think I am a cat magnet, because if there is a cat around it will usually find me and start up a conversation!  Here’s a little friend I met in Santorini when we first arrived, he was so affectionate I thought we’d see him every day, but unfortunately we never met again. He personifies the Greek cats very well.  Good-natured, happy and probably hungry too.  I hope you like them, if not well then you can just avoid them…

Windmills at Little Venice on Mykonos
 
Mykonos

Mykonos is a great little island that is generally the first stop for tourists on an island hopping tour. It’s open seasonally and most of the people who work on island are actually from Athens or other parts of Greece and just come to work for the summer months. It is also known for it’s party beaches: Paradise and Super Paradise Beach which attract club hoppers and a lot of gay men from all over Europe with it’s all night dance parties.

Despite the notion that it’s a party island this, Mykonos is still a great place to visit for a few days or even a week, if you want to enjoy some scooter/atv riding, sun tanning, lounging by the pool, swimming and walking through the picturesque streets of Little Venice. If you only had one island to visit, Mykonos is not a bad choice for your first visit to Greece and will not overwhelm you with Greek ruins and constant day tours.

 Getting Around 

 
 
50cc ATV
 
 

Mykonos is not that big, but if you’re staying in a hotel outside of the main town, walking during the heat of the day can be off-putting or not possible for some. A lot of hotels are in town, but you will need to find transportation to get the to nice beaches. Car rentals are abundant in Mykonos as are all the Greek islands, so booking in advance is not necessary and they are cheap. Better than renting a car, is to rent an atv or a scooter (helmets are free and engines are only 50 cc and very manageable) and cruise around to the beaches and park at will. Parking is only available outside of town at the port, but many people still park their scooters or ATVs in town near Little Venice for evening sunsets. Give it a try, it’s cheap and it will only add to your adventures on the Greek islands! Taxis are few on the island with only about 10 running during the day and 10 at night, so don’t count on taking them everywhere. It’s much cheaper to just rent an ATV for less than $20 US a day. There are also buses available in Mykonos, like all of the Greek islands and your hotel should be able to provide you with a daily bus schedule.

 Sights of Mykonos 

 
 
Paradise Beach
 
 

 Paradise and Super Paradise Beach are fully serviced beaches, with umbrellas, loungers and many cafes and restaurants and bars that you can order a la carte from and eat on right on the beach. There’s also a dive shop on site, but diving in Mykonos is not that exciting and we did not particularly enjoy the hospitality of the dive master at Dive Mykonos. It’s definitely worth spending at least a day or two in pure comfort on these beaches where you can buy ample drinks and snacks like fresh juices, fruit salads, giant fruit plates, Greek salads, garden salads and a few other vegan friendly hot dishes.
 
Fruit selection at Paradise Beach
 
 Little Venice –reminiscent of Venice in Italy for it’s beautiful little pedestrian streets and brightly painted houses (in white and blue) it’s nice for a short little stroll, to grab some photos and watch the sunset from along the coast. It is the place to be for sunset dining in Mykonos. Look for the many windmills on the hill and get there before sunset to get some beautiful photos. It’s very windy so make sure to bring a jacket too.

 Fruit Stores 

 
 
Fruit store in Mykonos
 
 

The main town of Mykonos has one decent sized fruit store beside the bus station before you get to Little Venice, you’ll see a large sign pointing towards it and if you get lost, just ask.

Outside of the main town you will find lots of fruit stores all along the “highway” road to the airport. You won’t be able to miss them. All the fruit here is basically self serve and then weighed at check out.

 Restaurants in Mykonos 

 

There are no specific vegetarian restaurants in town, but just ask around at the tavernas what they have available that day that is suitable for you. Everyone speaks English and menus are generally available in several other languages like French, German and Spanish as well.

 Naxos 

 
 
Naxos
 
 

Naxos was our second island getaway in Greece. We had no idea what to expect when we arrived and we wondered if all of the Greek islands were as small and touristy as Mykonos.

We were pleasantly surprised on arrival that the island was although much bigger, seemed to have more options for activities, sights and walking around. It’s actually the largest Greek island in the Cyclades group.

You will find two things here that you won’t find on other Greek islands. Plenty of fresh water and Naxos potatoes. The mountains of Naxos are able to trap rain clouds and create the perfect environment for agriculture on this self sustainable island. Although we heard the potatoes were delicious, we unfortunately did not get a chance to sample them on our short trip!

 Getting Around Naxos 

Car rentals are abundant here as with all of the Greek islands and for cheap. We decided to once again opt for an atv, as it’s easy to take into town and you don’t really need an actual parking spot to park it. This time we got a bigger one (150 cc to 250 cc) which is just fine for going anywhere in Naxos with two people. We even headed out into the Naxos mountains and took it climbing up the mountain roads. Yes they’re steep and it’s a little windy, but the roads are pretty dead and it’s really safe. Just bring your helmet.

 Sights of Naxos 

 
 
Temple of Demeter
 
 

 Temple of Demeter 

This was my first choice of a site since I read rave reviews about it on TripAdvisor. It’s actually fairly easy to get to with the well labeled signs from Naxos City and took us about 45 minutes to drive to on the Atvs. When we arrived some people were just leaving and we had the entire temple to ourselves. It was very very peaceful and beautiful. It’s hard to imagine just how long the ruins have been there because the quality of the stone is still very good.

 Venetian Museum 

 
 
View from Venetian Museum Balcony
 
 

This is in the Kastro area at the top of the city of Naxos. The views alone from the balconies are worth the admission price, even if you could care less about history. We tagged along on the free guided tour (included in admission price) and it was much more enjoyable than just browsing the small home ourselves. This way you get access to the secret cellar underneath and they show you some of the ancient stone blocks that were used to build the foundation. A lot of them have ancient Greek writing on them and it’s very cool. There’s also a piano and performance area with some great acoustics which they offer small concerts a few times a week. Highly recommended if you have the time.

 Archaeological Museum 

While not as exciting as let’s say the New Acropolis Museum, if you’re a history buff and don’t mind looking and some ruins of columns, statues and pottery it’s still interesting. It’s fairly inexpensive anyway and a good way to pass the time if you’re wandering around.

 Naxos Mountains 

 
 
Mountains
 
 

While we had intended to check out some sights along the way, we just ended up following the road almost all the way to the end of the island. The roads climb pretty high, but they seem very safe to drive on and there is little if any traffic. It is very liberating to just cruise around feeling the wind against your face and wondering what will be around the corner or at the top of the cliff. There are some very beautiful views from here, and if you’re tired of tours it’s a great way to spend the day enjoying the natural beauty of Naxos. Bring sunscreen and jackets (if coming back after sunset). Water and food is also a good idea, but you can always stop in a town for that as well.

 Naxos Town 
 
Naxos harbor at dusk
 
Make sure you take a stroll through“Old Town”and along the harbor of Naxos. You can get a better feel of what it must have been like to live in Naxos so long ago. There are some great views to be seen and don’t miss out on the sunset at the harbor.

 Fruit Markets 

The best fruit market we found was in the middle of “Old Town” which you can find by walking along the water of Naxos town and look on your right for sign placards showing directions to and shops found in Naxos town. It’s also below the “Kastro” (Castle) area where you find the Venetian Palace and the Archaeological Museum. You’ll know you found it when you see crates of fruits and vegetables lining the sides of the small pedestrian street.

 Restaurants in Naxos 

There are no specifically vegetarian restaurants in Naxos, but you will find that many of the tavernas especially in Old Town will have vegetarian items on their menu, including soups, beans, grilled vegetables, fried vegetables, and bread. Also check to see if you can get a plate of Naxos potatoes on the side.

Santorini
 
Caldera view from our hotel
 
Ah Santorini. A place where you swear the sky touches the ocean and everywhere you look seems like a misty blue dreamland you could just float away into another land. It’s that beautiful.

The second our ferry boat opened it’s huge platform and we stepped onto Santorini our jaws dropped wide open. You look up, and then up and then up some more and you see a massive caldera cliff all around you. You think, how is it possible that anyone lives on this island? It’s just a cliff! How are we going to get there?

Oh you do…Once you get in your taxi, bus or rental car you go up a road unlike anything you’ve seen before with many switchbacks as you weave all the way up to your magnificent view at the top of the caldera below. Really breathtaking.

Aside from the slightly nerve-wracking drive up and down that one road to the port, everywhere else is a breeze to drive on Santorini and you will have no qualms about it.

 Getting Around 

A lot of people just stay in a hotel in Thira/Thera and just walk around, but you will miss out on the other side of Santorini unless you venture out there. Cars again are cheap and you can get atvs upon arrival no problem. There are busses as well, ask your hotel for help with the bus schedule.

 Sights of Santorini 

 The Caldera 

 
 
Fred and I enjoying a sunset salad
 
 

The caldera is very easy to see anywhere from the top of the volcano crater and offers very beautiful views sunrise, day and sunset. If you have a hotel with a caldera view, expect it to be a bit pricier than one in town or across the street.

Many people also choose to enjoy the view from up close and take a sail around the interior of the caldera and take a swim in the open ocean. While the views are certainly lovely, they are not as exciting as say a speedboat tour watching dolphins play against the backdrop of a tropical island. If you find just relaxing on a boat, getting some sun, going for a dip and viewing rocky cliffs then this is for you. If you aren’t utterly impressed with the idea you can save your pennies knowing the best views really are from the top and not on the boats down below. Our pick: a sunset sail with Santorini Sailing. While they are not “raw” friendly for their onboard barbecue, they can accommodate vegetarian and vegan guests. Check out their website here for prices: http://www.santorinisailing.com/index.htm 

 Amoudi Bay 

 
 
Amoudi Bay from the sea
 
 

This gem is not near the main town of Thera but on the North tip of the island. We read reviews online and decided to venture out on an atv down the coast line and all the way down to the bay. The drive is very easy. There are two ways to get there however. One driving through town will take you along the top to the tourist part of Amoudi bay which has a million steps to walk down to the ocean below. The other bypasses Thera and goes down along the lower part of the island and you end up at the bottom of the bay where there’s a beach and restaurants to sit at. The views from the bottom here are very beautiful with the chiseled red rocks all around you. Don’t leave Santorini without at least stopping by for a visit!

 Ancient Thera 

 
 
View from Ancient Thera
 
 

This is the site of the highest ancient ruins I have ever seen and the views are spectacular. Ancient Thera sits atop a 360m high (1148 ft) mountain that towers over the bays of Santorini below. How any civilization could survive up here, no one really knows. It gets so hot up here that it is closed every day after 2pm and locals head back down for their afternoon siesta. There are a few ways to get up, take a bus from the beach town below, drive up by car, atv or scooter, or walk. Might I suggest that you actually do not walk on this occasion, unless it is very cloudy, early in the morning or you are accustomed to extreme temperatures. If you walk up the mountain it will take you an hour or two depending on your speed, once you’re actually at the site entrance and likely sweaty and tired, you are exposed to the elements and still have to climb a little higher and walk around under the beating sun for another hour to see the actual ruins.  Our solution was to drive up by ATV, which was no trouble at all on the steep switchback road and took only a few minutes. Even after being on the top for a few minutes we could understand why so many people were taking busses and why the site opens early and closes in the afternoon. Bring sunscreen, hats, umbrellas, and lots and lots of ice cold water you will need it. The site is very rocky and not easily walkable. If you have little children or have mobility issues I suggest you take a pass on this one to avoid slipping or heat exhaustion.

 Grocery Stores 

You will find grocery stores in Santorini that have a good selection of produce. There is a decent sized one right before Thera near the post office. If your hotel is not nearby to one you may have to grab a taxi back if you have a lot of bags.

 Restaurants in Santorini 

Santorini does not have any vegetarian restaurants and it’s pretty touristy, but a good amount of tavernas will have some vegan and vegetarian options. One taverna at the far end of Ammoudi bay offered baked beans in vegetable sauce and fava dip while the rest offered seafood, seafood and more seafood! In Thira town you will find some breakfast/lunch cafes will offer fresh fruit plates, fresh orange juice and waffles or crepes with honey. Grocery stores will be the most inexpensive place for food here and are your best bet.

Crete–The Magical Island
 
Balos Lagoon, Crete
 
Crete is the mother of all Greek islands. It is absolutely enormous, and just a few days on this island does not do it justice. I seriously recommend spending at least a week here and not spending more than a few days in Heraklion and moving off to Chania for a base to experience the west part of Crete as well.

 Heraklion 

Heraklion is definitely not the most stunning city in Greece, it’s rather unimpressive, noisy and crammed. Parking is very scarce and it’s likely your hotel won’t even have a parking lot. It’s easy to walk about, so I suggest leaving your car parked while in Heraklion and using it only for escaping the city as traffic can be bad during rush hour.

*It seems that a lot of places have reduced hours or are closed on Mondays in Heraklion. So make sure to take this into account if you only have limited time and always check opening hours in advance.

 Sights of Heraklion 

There are a few sights to see in Heraklion that you can generally see in 2 days.

 Venetian Harbor 

 
 
Venetian fort
 
 

This can be seen pretty much any day of the week and you will know it when you see it. It looks like a castle fort guarding the old harbor. For a few euros you can venture inside and see the inside and climb up to the top for some views of Heraklion and the harbor below.

 Heraklion Archaeological Museum 

 
 
Phaistos Disc
 
 

Currently there is only a small temporary exhibit open to the public while they finish renovating the rest of the museum (closed since 2006). It’s basically one room and with artifacts in display cases. There are about 450 artifacts on display (some of them are very small). While interesting, I’m sure the full museum once it’s opened in spring 2012 will be much better. If you want to skip the admission fee, you can also view all of the main artifacts online here: http://www.ancient-greece.org/images/museums/heraklion-mus/index.htm 

Museum Hours:

July 1st to October 31 :

Mondays: 1:30–7pm

Tuesday–Sunday and Holidays 8am–7pm

November 1st to March 31:

Daily: 8am–5pm, Mondays: 1:30 till 5pm

(Subject to change, please check beforehand)

Entrance Fees: Adults: 6 Euros, students and visitors over 65: 3 Euros.

A combined 10 Euro ticket good for the Museum and the ancient palace of Knossos is also available. *Best deal

 Knossos Palace 

 
 
Bastion A at Knossos Palace
 
 

The must-see historic place on Crete. It is about 15 minutes south of Heraklion by car, and you’ll find parking just before you see the entrance on your left.

The once great palace of the Minoan civilization on Crete stands in ruins today, but with the help of Arthur Evans in the 1900s it was unearthed and slightly reconstructed. While some people are appalled at the fact some parts have been restored to show some vivid decorations, it gives one a better idea of the grandeur the palace once had.

It has been speculated that this is the place from where the Greek myths of Theseus and the Minotaur and the Labyrinth were born. While the palace itself is certainly not a death trap for an unlucky Theseus, it is definitely a labyrinth and a very complex building.

There is a guided tour available for 10 euros per person in addition to the entrance fee. I suggest you take the tour, as you’ll get a much more in-depth history and explanation of what you’re looking at. The tour guides are licensed and you will enjoy Knossos much more with their help.

 Fruit Markets 

 
 
Fruit stand at Central Market
 
 

You will find a few fruit stands in Heraklion just by walking around. The best one is at the central market in the heart of Heraklion. You can’t really park here, so it’s best to just walk from your hotel. You will find much more selection here than at grocery stores or basic fruit stands. We even found figs after everyone in Greece told us there are no more figs left in September!

 Restaurants in Heraklion 

There are no vegetarian restaurants in Heraklion but you will find vegan and vegetarian food at some of the Tavernas. The best vegan-friendly menu we saw was at a place along the port called Maranto (Maρavto in Greek) ironically it’s a seafood restaurant, but if you tell them you are vegetarian (and don’t eat milk or cheese) they will happily show you what they can make for you (like pastas and vegan risottos which they highly recommend) They also have a tangy shredded vegetable salad which was so delicious we came back the next day.

 Sights Around Crete 

There is much more to Crete than just Heraklion, so please please visit as much as you can on your visit. The roads are perfectly safe to drive and well paved and the scenery will be the best you find in the Greek islands.

*A Note About Driving in Crete: roads are single lane and it is customary for those on the right inside lane to drive in the shoulder or ride the line, to allow cars to pass in between them and oncoming traffic. It is much safer to do this than to drive fully in the middle of the lane and risk an impatient driver speeding up behind you or trying to squeeze around you. Most people will drive 100 to 120 km/h.

 Crete Aquarium 

 
 
Fish at CretAquarium
 
 

Heading 30 km east from Heraklion you will find sign posts on the road advertising the Crete aquarium or CretAquarium in Hersonissos/Chersonissos. It’s open every day from 10 am to 6 pm.  Admission: adults 6 euros and children 4 euros. It’s definitely worth a stop if you’re near Heraklion, like marine life or have kids. They even have several sharks!  They offer personal audio guides available in almost every language which really enhances the exhibits.

 Balos Lagoon 
 
Balos Lagoon
 
The place most often quoted as“Heaven on Earth”on Crete.  Sure I read about it and thought we should check it out to see what all the fuss was about…Fred was even more unprepared for what we saw as we walked across the plain and stepped down onto the ledge overlooking the sea below. He looked at me and exclaimed “Yes! This is it, this is it!”, I just smiled and said, “So now you agree the ridiculously long drive was worth it?” We spent a while up here before heading down, getting lots of photos and doing a few videos.  The view is just too good to rush. If you come to Crete you cannot miss out on coming here, I don’t care how many hours you have to drive it will be worth it.

Expect to take about 3 1/2 hours to drive here from Heraklion, or better yet stay in Chania and reduce your trip to only 58 kms. If you don’t do anything else in Crete but come here, you will feel accomplished, have a great day and get some amazing photos.

The lagoon is at the northern most tip of Crete of Gramvousa Peninsula. Just keep driving all the way west and then turn north when you see signs for Balos. You will continue until you reach a two way dirt road on the side of a cliff and continue to the edge of the island. Go slow and during the day and you’ll have no problem. Once at the gate there will be a fee of 1 euro per person for the upkeep of the area. Find the parking lot and park your car. Try not to park it near where any goats are sleeping to discourage them from climbing on and denting your hood! Ouch…You can bribe them with bananas though, they seem to eat anything!
 
Balos goats hanging out in the parking lot
 
Once parked grab all your stuff, you will not be coming back until you’re ready to leave. Water, food, towels, hats, bathing suit, camera etc, bring everything in a backpack. Good shoes are handy too, it takes much longer to hike down in flip flops. Walk towards the signs and down the rocky plain until you get your first glimpse of the lagoon. There are chiseled steps to take pictures from and walk all the way down to the beach below. It is fairly steep and can be hot, so it is not recommended if you have little children, babies or mobility problems of any kind. You will likely be tired going down and especially coming back up if you are not in good shape and/or dehydrated. The best shots will all be at the top of the cliff, so best to take them before you hike all the way down.

The water is warm and shallow and great for taking a dip. The afternoon can be very windy at times so finding shelter behind a rock or an umbrella will make for a more enjoyable day. There’s not much for refreshments here other than a small shack that serves souvlaki, french fries, Greek salad, pop and water. You can rent beach chairs on site from a guy sitting at a table.

 Samaria Gorge–Western Crete 

 

While we did not get a chance to view or hike the gorge, it’s definitely on our list of must do’s next time we’re in Crete. It’s fairly hard to do by yourself since you park at one end and must get a ride or picked up at the opposite end. You will either have to take a tour bus from Chania or Heraklion (it can be up to a 16 hour day) or go with another couple and have one vehicle on one end and the other on the exit side. The roads do not meet though so this can take some extra time to get to.

It can be very busy during tourist season with up to 3000 visitors a day so keep that in mind when you decide what month to visit in. Bring all of your own necessities and good hiking shoes. The gorge is 16 km long and starts at an altitude of 1250m.

Children under the age of 8 or 9 are not recommended, as they will usually tire well before the end of the hike which can be a problem if they are too heavy to carry the rest of the way. People with mobility issues or those who are not moderate to strong hikers should consider whether they are fit enough to take on the gorge as well. It can be very steep and has many slippery rocks and quite a natural pathway.

Rhodes
 
Sunset at Rhodes
 
Rhodes is the site of one of the 7 Wonders of The Ancient World–The Colossus of Rhodes.  It was originally looming over the entrance to the main harbor in Rhodes and was surely impressive.  While nothing remains, you can still see the entrance where the great statue once stood.

Rhodes is one of the most visited islands in all of Greece, there are even numerous flights coming from all over Europe that go directly to Rhodes. Let’s just say that it’s way past touristy and can seem down right unauthentic at times if you’re hanging by resorts and tourist tavernas. If it were not for some of the impressive sights here, I would say skip it altogether and just go to Crete instead if you want a great vacation.

Still interested? Well I’m not going to write off Rhodes just yet, but the vegetarian choices and produce markets are scarce, yet a few are still possible to find.

If you’re into beaches and a crazy party scene then you will probably love Rhodes.  If you’re into ancient sites and history then you will equally enjoy Rhodes as well.

 Getting Around 

If your hotel is in the main part of Rhodes town near all the sights then you can probably just walk. Keep in mind that it can be very hot here, so bring lots of water and a hat. Car rentals are available (atv not recommended as some sights are too far) so just get a car for the day(s) that you need to leave Rhodes and drive around. A lot of the streets are one way in Rhodes, so make sure you have a map and know how to get out of town and back in town to your hotel because it will be two different routes.

 Sights of Rhodes 

There are MANY places to see in Rhodes, below are just a few if you have a short time, but also some noteworthy places such as the Butterfly Valley, Tsambika beach, the Decorative Arts Museum and the Old City could be added if you have a few more days.

 Acropolis of Rhodes 

 
 
Temple of Apollo
 
 

This is a great first stop to see ancient Rhodes and the ruins that have survived thousands of years. Lucky for us they have been rediscovered and are completely free to visit! There is a bit of climbing and the area is fairly exposed to the elements. The ancient hippodrome is still mostly intact and very impressive. Come in the early morning or before sunset, it can be very very hot here if you’re walking from your hotel.

 Palace of the Grand Masters of Knights 

 
 
Palace of the Grand Master of Knights
 
 

You will either take a cab or walk here, it’s found in Rhodes town itself. This was the first “real” castle I’ve ever been in, and I must say it was very impressive. It’s mostly intact and really feels medieval. The ticket price is a little steep, but this is probably the main reason sightseers come to Rhodes so you have to see what all the fuss is about. Photos are not allowed in some of the rooms, so just be mindful and make sure to take photos where you can (like in the outside courtyard and before you get into the palace)

 Fruit Markets 

Most of Rhodes town is littered with little convenience stores selling random souvenirs, snacks and some fresh produce. The quality won’t be great, but you will be able to find things like bananas, apples and grapes (August and later). The tourists don’t really eat much fruit, so the central market near the port is mostly souvenirs and cheap tourist food as well.

 Sights Outside of Rhodes town 

 
 
Bay of Lindos
 
 

 Acropolis of Lindos 

 
 
Temple of Athena Lindia
 
 

Lindos is about 55 km away from Rhodes and is an easy drive. You have to park before the town at the main parking lot and walk in. Go through the town streets until you see signs for the acropolis and you can follow it up some slick rock stairs all the way to the top. The acropolis sits on a natural citadel above the city below and has ruins of an old fortress on top. It offers very beautiful views of the bays and Lindos below. It can be very hot up here so early morning or after 5pm would be best. They close around 6:40pm and start pushing people out around 6:35 so make sure you keep that in mind. Bring good shoes as the steps are smooth and can be slippery.

Faliraki is probably the most touristy place I’ve seen anywhere in Greece. It kind of looks like an old tourist town built around an amusement park and it’s overall very gaudy looking. There’s a lot of resorts here and it’s near the beach.

It is home to one of the largest outdoor water parks though and if you’re dying from the heat, or have kids, or have “big kids” (husbands) it’s still a fun way to spend the day for 20 euros each. It’s open all day and was not overly crowded when we visited in September. In the height of summer it can be very hot there and people suggest wearing socks or bringing flip flops for walking around on the hot pavement. This place is past it’s prime but the slides are still up and running and all the tubes are free so it still has some to offer.

A few caveats: the locker rooms are in a public area, and the change facilities are very small, so wear your bathing suit to save time. You have to pay 6 euros for a locker and 5 will be returned. No outside food is “allowed” and they only serve typical American junk food like nachos, hot dogs, burgers, chicken wings and pop. So sneak in your own food and eat it discretely.

We had a great day here, it was a little overcast and not too hot, but I definitely swallowed too much pool water from bailing at the end of some VERY fast slides. I even got a video of Fred on one of the tube slides the“Sting Ray”.  Pretty hilarious!

 

…Back to Mainland Greece

 Delphi 

 
 
The Treasury of Athens at Delphi
 
 

After our final island stop in Rhodes we headed back to Athens and spent our last day in Greece at the Oracle of Delphi and the Tholos of Athena Pronaia (the temple ruins that you can see in the distance in the photo above)

After much research and weighing the costs, I decided we would attempt to make it to Delphi on our own, by taking the city bus from Athens. A lot of tour companies run a day tour for Delphi but I had heard bad reviews and you only get 2 hours at the actual site after a whole day on the bus and get dragged to some rug merchants for a sales pitch at the end. Not what I call worth your 90 euros per person!

The bus leaves at the main terminal in Athens (you can take a cab or find the metro if you have figured it out by then) at 7:30 and 10:30 am every morning. Come at least an hour and a half early and you can buy tickets on site for 13 euros each (each way). If you take the 10:30 bus you will arrive around 1 and it will give you about 4 hours to enjoy the area if you take the bus back at 5:30 pm.

Start with the museum and visit it with, or without a guide (with a guide will take longer, but the information is interesting). There are lockers in the museum where you can leave heavy belongings if you do not wish to carry them around with you until after you’re done the museum at the ruins outside.
 
Temple of Apollo
 
The ruins outside can be fairly busy depending on the season and it’s also very hot up there when the sun is fully shining. Bring water, a hat and possibly an umbrella. If it’s a little cloudy or overcast you will be fine. If you have small children or have difficulties with mobility you may only wish to visit the lower part of the ruins because it takes a little hiking to get to the top to see the hippodrome.
 
The Tholos of Athena Pronaia Sanctuary
 
If you still have time before your bus comes back you can hurry over across the street back towards Athens and you will see some ruins in the distance. This is the gymnasium and the Tholos of Athena Pronaia sanctuary. There are signs at the entrance of both the gymnasium and the sanctuary where you can walk down the hill to view it closer. From the museum, it will take you about an hour to get over there, take a quick look through and get back to the bus terminal in time if you hurry. (Longer if you walk slowly or stop for lots of photos.) It’s definitely worth at least going to the sanctuary to see the iconic view that you have likely seen so many times on postcards of Delphi.

Conclusion

We spent 17 lovely days in Greece and saw some of the most amazing sights, had great weather and learned about a unique culture. While it was definitely not the easiest of all places to find top quality produce in abundance, we were still able to find enough to eat to enjoy our vacation.

My top favorite places we saw would have to be:

#1 Oracle at Delphi and the Tholos of Athena Pronaia

#2 Balos Lagoon, West Crete

#3 Amoudi Bay, Santorini

#4 Acropolis of Athens

#5 Mykonos beaches and “Little Venice”

#6 Palace of The Grand Masters of Knights, Rhodes town

#7 Naxos mountains

Make sure you visit Greece at least once in your lifetime. Don’t wait until you are too old to really be able to hike around and enjoy it. The history and the sights are definitely worth it and you will be grateful you did.

Stay tuned for more in depth reports on our raw trip around the world.

 Eating Raw, Vegan and Vegetarian in Italy! 
 
 Share Email Print 
 
 

by Veronica Grace Patenaude

Italy is a wonderful and diverse country with with an abundance of fresh home grown Italian produce and cuisines that vary from region to region.

We spent a few days in a number of cities checking out the sights and enjoying some delicious Italian fruits this summer.  So much so that we definitely plan on returning for a few months in the near future! (Frederic would love to have the chance to practice his Italian again every day too.)

The Italians are very proud of their country, their heritage, their cars, name brand designers, their cuisine and the quality of their produce. Going to Italy is really stepping into a whole new world where everyone expects the best and only buys the best even if it’s a little outside their means. Most of the main cities seem to host locals who look like they just stepped out of a designer catalogue! The tourists of course are the easiest to spot, they’re the ones in shorts and a hat with a camera wrapped around their neck and their mouths gaping open .

In Italy the Italians have a reputation of driving VERY fast, often on winding and narrow single lane roads (that are two way roads) and drive fast cars or high-end scooters like Vespas.  They also do not seem to obey traffic lights right away or crosswalks.  Almost all of the crosswalks in large cities like Florence or Rome are not used, you must simply find a relatively“safe”time to go, take a deep breath and FIRMLY walk out onto the street and have traffic stop all around you and just get across. If you panic or run you will be in more danger than if you deliberately just cross the street calmly and confidently.  Italians don’t like to be slowed down, cities have a lot of traffic and crosswalk lights only impede traffic further so it seems they are not used hardly ever! If you’re from New York you may find this fact a little less intimidating than if you are from a small rural town!

Frederic began learning Italian a few weeks before we arrived, he spent about 3 weeks learning an hour or two of Italian a day and by the time we got there he was trying to speak full on conversations with everyone we met.  This greatly pleased everyone we ran into, they particularly enjoy having conversations in Italian instead.  Most of the people we met anywhere (outside of hotels and taxis) spoke very good English, a lot better than we anticipated and I’m sure it’s due to the large amount of tourists they receive from all over the world every year.  Some of the top sights in the world are in Italy so it’s no wonder they cater to English speaking travelers all over Europe, North America and Australia.

Deciphering Italian Menus

You will likely come across chalkboard signs or menus that have sections like Antipasti (starters), Insalata (salads), Primi piatti/il Primo (small first course), Secondi piatti/ il Secondo (main dish), Contorni/il Contorno (side dish) and Dolce (dessert).
If you plan on eating out, you will likely be ordering from the Antipasti things like bruschette, caprese salad, olive tapenades etc. From the Primo small portions of spaghetti, risotto or gnocchi, nothing from the the Secondo section, possibly something from the Contorno section if they have white beans, grilled vegetables, steamed asparagus, roasted potatoes, french fries, or long beans and you will probably be too full to have Dolce (dessert).

If you plan on avoiding the restaurants entirely then it will be a bit easier since you will be certain there aren’t any added things like butter, cream or cheese.

Eating raw in Italy is fairly easy when the produce is so fresh and delicious. If you have a market to go to and can wash and prepare some fruit and salads in your room you will have no problem.  The only issue is salad dressing.  There is no such thing in the Mediterranean! Italians use lots of olive oil and vinegar or lemon for salad dressing.  Perhaps bringing some with you or making it in a travel blender would be best for low fat salads. Avocado is not fresh and abundant here.

Eating vegan is fairly easy, but only if you include bread and pasta at restaurants since no one in Italy would really understand why you would choose to not eat meat, fish, dairy AND pasta.  They love their pasta. You will find spaghetti and gnocchi everywhere.  There is also quite often minestrone soup on the menu, which is basically just vegetable soup in a tomato broth, sometimes white beans in sauce or grilled vegetables.  But predominantly vegan food served at restaurants is dried pasta and bread. (Fresh pasta is made with eggs, it is against Italian law to use eggs in dried pasta) You can also ask for risottos to be made with no cheese, if you find a vegetable based one like mushroom or asparagus. Seafood risotto is the most common so stay away from that.  Cafe’s will likely have it premade, sit down restaurants will make it to order so you can always inquire if they will make it without the parmesan. Pizza can be made to order in many places without cheese, but is not as common at the tourist ready made pizza places (except in Rome). Pizza marinara (just tomato sauce and oregano) can be ordered almost anywhere pizza is made fresh, pizza bianca is dough brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with herbs, or you can make your own with tomato sauce and mushrooms, zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, olives etc without cheese.

If you’re a vegetarian you will likely have zero problem eating in Italy, since you can basically eat any pasta with cream or cheese, mushroom risotto, bruschette, minestrone soup, salads, vegetarian pizza etc.

Simple Italian Phrases

If you can, learn some basic phrases like this to get by:

“Sono vegetariano”I’m vegetarian
“Vorrei un piatto di frutta”I would like a fruit plate
“Vorrei un’insalata”I would like a salad
“Posso ordinare questo senza carne o formaggio”Can I order this without meat or cheese?
“ma senze pesci”but without fish
“ma senza formaggio”but without cheese
“Ha delle verdure grigliate?”Do you have any grilled vegetables?
“Vorrei  un piatto di pasta secca, non frescha”I want to order some dried pasta, not fresh (because fresh pasta has eggs in it)
“Vorrei della minestra di verdure, per favore”I want to order the vegetable soup, please
“Una pizza vegetariana senza formaggio, per favore”A vegetable pizza without cheese, please

Like I said most people speak English, but maybe if you are eating at a small mom and pop restaurant, or in the country side it might be useful to know some basic Italian if you plan or ordering at restaurants.

Italian Markets

You should be able to find fruit markets or produce stands in every city you visit in Italy.  All the locals buy their produce here, and there is always vendors selling pre made items to tourists, such as fresh juice, cut up fruit in cups and possibly some meat or fish items. The markets open early so make sure you head there before 1pm, preferably before noon for better quality produce and a good selection.

Italian Grocery Stores

Like most of Europe there are not many“large”grocery stores or supermarkets.  Most are fairly small, selling essential dried and canned items with milk and meat products, a few vegetables and fruits to tide people over or for tourists who want to get everything in one place.

Italian Restaurants

*A special note about Italian restaurants. A lot of them charge a“cover charge”per person for eating at their restaurant.  I guess this could be like an extra automatic gratuity. Sometimes 3 to 4 Euros per person.  Often you will see menu chalkboards advertising:“No cover charge!”this is a good sign.  If it does not say this it will be added to your bill. Also menu items include taxes and gratuity of 10%, only tip extra if you feel necessary.

Most cafes will be open continuously from breakfast to lunch, serving various things like English breakfast, Italian espressos, pastries, panini, pizza, and premade pasta dishes.

For dinner most restaurants are not open until 7pm (19:00) unless they are on a tourist street and are a cafe, then they will be open earlier but they sell basic low quality tourist food.

Italian Juice/Smoothie Bars

You will find a few places selling fresh squeezed juice whether it’s on the street or in a proper shop. Juice bars will have everything listed in Italian so it would be good to learn the Italian words of the fruits you like so you can look at their combinations and see what you want.  They usually offer smoothies with yogurt or milk, so make sure to mention if you want it without.  You can usually find at least one smoothie without dairy, like apple, orange and banana or with berries.  They seem to use blenders to make juices and not juicers as often. So don’t expect juices to be exactly the same as you’d find somewhere in the USA.

Italian Sweets Vendors

In the Mediterranean you will find that a lot of people eat fruit for dessert or a snack so you will usually see cups of cut up fruit being sold for a few Euros.  Things like cantaloupe, pineapple and grapes together or just watermelon.  Very easy to find in large cities and especially on hot days! They will usually sell other types of desserts as well.

Travelers Tip

Buy ALL of your museum passes or tour tickets online before you go to Italy. There can be huge lines at places like St Mark’s Basilica in Venice, The Colosseum in Rome and the Ufizzi Museum in Florence. The Italian sun can be hot and standing in huge lines to buy a ticket and then enter is no way to spend your holiday.  We skipped the line at EVERY major attraction and it was awesome! You just google the ticket you want, find a website that sells it, pick the date and entry time you want to go to the site and purchase it online.  Print the ticket and bring it with you to exchange for a real ticket at the ticket office upon arrival. They are a little lenient in time too, so 15-20 min before or after your time seems to be no problem either.

Eating Raw, Vegan and Vegetarian in Venice

 

Venice was the first city we went to in Italy and we had spectacular weather, low humidity and pure sunshine.  Make sure you get a map and have your hotel tell you how to get to and from San Marco’s Square as basically you will be going there every day for tours, shopping or restaurants.  Better yet, picking a hotel that is within a 10 minute walk to San Marco’s would be good too.  Ours was about 20 minutes away and going back and forth several times a day was a good workout dodging the masses of tourists on narrow streets!

Venice Tours

 Murano, Burano and Torcello : boat tour was well worth it. Inexpensive and a good way to see some little islands outside of Venice and get some beautiful photos of their painted houses. Stops for 40 minutes on each island to look around. 20 Euros each: http://www.tours-italy.com/venice-boat_tours-venice_three_island_boat_tours.htm 

 Walking Tour of Venice was not very exciting, but it came with a semi private canal tour (called Grand Canal Boat Tour&amp;Walking Tour) 53 euros each: http://www.tours-italy.com/venice-day_tours-venice_day_tours.htm San Marco’s Basilica was packed, you cannot take photos, you must cover up your shoulders and legs (ladies) and was pretty quick. Personally I think it’s overrated. The Grand Canal Boat tour was great, the guide was excellent and it covered much more ground than a gondola tour simply because the boat can go faster.

 Doge’s Palace: really nice to walk through, not very packed and you can skip the line and buy a ticket online in advance. 18 euros each http://www.tickitaly.com/galleries/doges-palace-venice.php This ticket also gets you into all the other museums in San Marco’s Square and can be used within 3 months, only once at each other museum.  Your time for Doge’s Palace must be reserved ahead of time though.  Well worth it.

Venice Vegetarian Restaurants

None!

Just modify menu items, no meat or cheese on salad, no cream in mushroom risotto, no cheese on pizza (although I heard pizza in Venice is not that great and of the low tourist quality variety) spaghetti pomodoro or marinara, and fresh orange juice or watermelon are a few things you can find almost anywhere. Sometimes cafes will have premade risotto or gnocchi that has cheese in it, so opt for a more sit down restaurant if you want made to order food.

Eating Raw, Vegan and Vegetarian in Florence

 

We spent 2 lovely days in Florence and wish we had had more time! The city is very walkable, so find a hotel within a few minutes of the Duomo and you will be near most of the attractions you want and all the shops and restaurants. The Duomo is free too, so that’s a huge plus and if you want to take some photos without all the tourists standing outside go around sunrise or 7am to get some great shots.

Florence Tours

 Tuscany by Vespa –this was the most exciting tour we did in Europe. Learn how to ride a scooter and tour Tuscany.  Not for the feint of heart or those unexperienced with cycling or riding things like atvs, jet skis or scooters.  It is safe, but Italian drivers can be crazy so you need to keep your cool when they pass you on little country roads. No city driving at all and very fun.  120 euros each: http://www.florencetown.com/eng/tuscany-tours/single-day-tours/77/tuscany-by-vespa–original-1-day-tour.html 

Museums in Florence

 Pitti Palace - the Boboli Gardens were well worth it and you get some great shots of Tuscany, Florence and the palace. There are 2 tickets, 1 for the minor exhibits and the gardens and one for the art gallery inside the palace.  You will likely not be able to do both in one day, it’s a lot of time walking, if you want both come on 2 separate days. You can buy tickets on site no problem.

 Galleria de Accademia –really good smaller museum who’s star attraction is the Statue of David. It is very impressive in person and in immaculate condition. You can spend about an hour or two here.  Buy your tickets online in advance to skip the line.

 Ufizzi Gallery –we did not have time to go to, but it is very crowded and busy all the time much like the Louvre.  Buy your tickets in advance and plan to spend most of a day here. Researching what you want to see in advance would be helpful too.

Florence Grocery Stores

They are a little harder to find in Florence, and fruit shops are scarce in the tourist areas. You will have to walk around on some side shops and find a vendor selling a few items or find the weekly market.

Florence Vegetarian Restaurants

 Il Vegetariano 
Via delle Ruote, 30 R (if you’ve gotten to the grocery store on this street you’ve gone too far)
39-055-475030
Vegetarian and Vegan friendly, has a raw and cooked veggie salad bar and vegan dressings
Closed Mondays, opens for dinner at 7pm.

This restaurant is really lovely, lots of space, affordable and a great vegan friendly salad bar you can load up your bowl with. No cover charge to eat here.  I think they are open for lunch too but may close around 2pm.

 La Fonte 
Via Lucignano 15, Montespertoli (FI 50025)
+39-0571-609514
Vegan-friendly, Macrobiotic, Organic, Beer/Wine

Serves dinner only except on Sunday which is open lunch and dinner. Closed Mon-Tuesday.

Eating Raw, Vegan and Vegetarian in Rome

 

We spent 3 days in Rome in the Campo De Fiori area, I really recommend finding an apartment in this area. (The hotels in Rome are very pricey) You can walk to the market every day in this campo and get all kinds of local fresh fruits and vegetables until about 1pm when they close down. You get a much better selection here than at any corner store or grocery store. They are closed on Sundays.

 

Water.  You will find fountains EVERYWHERE in Rome. On the sidewalks, near churches, in parking lots, in monument complexes. All of it is free and completely drinkable. So bring your own water bottle and you can fill it up with cold water wherever you are and save money on buying bottled water. The locals assure us the water is very clean and Rome is proud to still be a city of water and marble after over a thousand years.

It was easy enough for us to just walk to most places from here, Piazza Navona, Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon, Spanish Steps, Vittorio Emanuele monument, Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill are all within a reasonable walking distance from here.  If you get tired you can always take a cab or transit back. If you see 3 or 4 places each day you will have lots of time to take photos, enjoy the scenery and shop.  We saved some money in Rome by buying tickets online in advance for the Colosseum and downloading Rick Steve’s free audio tours for Rome and listening to them on iPods. Click here to download them. It’s really worth it for the Roman Forum especially, otherwise you won’t enjoy it as much and won’t be sure what ruins you’re looking at! Most of the other monuments are free to look at and you can come back again and again to avoid some of the crowds.

Rome Taxis

Do not take taxis from tourist places, you will pay a ridiculous price. (So ignore the guys standing outside the Colosseum!) If you get taxis that are on the go or at a taxi stand in the middle of the city it will be much cheaper than ones at any piazzas or monuments.

Rome Grocery Stores

They are available, you will find some things like apples, bananas, oranges and some vegetables, but the Campo Di Fiori market has a much better selection.

Rome Vegetarian Restaurants

Eating Raw, Vegan and Vegetarian in Sicily

 

We spent a short 3 days in Sicily, seeing Taormina on the East and Palermo on the West.  My advice would be to spend at least a week here if you want to see a few of the towns in between and enjoy some of the beaches.

Taormina is quaint town, but interesting as it’s built into the upper cliffs and has very beautiful views of the bays and beaches below.  It’s pretty touristy with lots of high end shops and restaurants.  There are two things that will frustrate you here. The first, driving can be stressful, even with a GPS the roads go off in all directions and if you miss your turn you have to drive a while to be able to turn around because the roads are on cliffs. The roads here are unlike any you have likely ever seen and they seem to build roads out of thin air supported from beams underneath. Parking is a nightmare, so you need to find one of the large parking garages before you get to the pedestrian walking street in the heart of old Taormina. The second thing is that grocery stores are really small and often only have 3 or 4 types of fruit, so you will have to try a few to get enough of what you want. It’s not that big and you can walk to them, but bring backpacks so you can carry it back with you.

Driving out of Taormina on the highway is fine around Sicily, the roads are not as narrow, there are 2 lanes, and if you just stay in the slow lane and let the crazy drivers pass you, you will be fine.

Palermo on the other hand is like Taormina’s disfigured ugly cousin… and I mean that in the most literal sense. The area around Palermo is pretty and has some nice views, but being in Palermo you will ask yourself how you entered a third world country without even knowing it. Driving here will push your nerves to the limits.  Traffic lights are scarce, traffic signs are suggestions, and people will park 2 or 3 deep on the sides of busy roads and you will have to be careful not to hit other side view mirrors while you weave in and out. Make sure you know where your hotel is and how you will get there, street signs are poor here and you can go in circles if you’re in the downtown area as a lot of roads are one way.  Hotels also don’t really have parking so you need to find a parking garage.  They will take your keys and cram your car in along with the rest of the lot, but at least your car is safer there than on the street. (From being scratched or hit)

Aside from the chaos and unpleasantries of how Palermo looks physically, the people are very nice and you can find food everywhere! Everyone has a fruit shop and sits on the street in a chair with their fruit and vegetable displays until late at night.  There’s a great selection of local produce for cheap.  There is so much fruit in Sicily just rotting on the trees because they cannot afford to pay people to pick all of it because the profits are so low when they sell it.

You won’t need to find grocery stores here, you’ll see fruit being sold everywhere you walk in the down town area.  There are also some vendors selling vegetables like boiled potatoes and corn in big tubs, but these are not good, they are cooked in really salted water and will not meet your expectations, so stay away!

You can also drive around Mt Etna and see a lot of people have fruit trees or orchards off the road, often with fruit sitting on them.  You can take a few pieces of fruit or possibly even go and ask to pick some for a fee.  It seems that they have so much fruit they don’t know what to do with it, and they don’t even eat much of it either.  Heaven forbid they do not get their pasta and fish intake!

Sicily Tours

 

 Taormina–Legendary Sicily 

This was an excellent tour. The owner, Eddie has a Ph.D in Geology and is an expert on volcanoes and history. He will tell you some amazing stories and show you things you’ve never seen before. He’s probably the best tour guide we’ve ever had, and he’s a tour guide second and geological expert first! We went on the Etna-Alcantara off-road tour. This is a great full day tour, so be sure to pack your tupperware of fruit! Eddie even stopped at a few places where we could pick figs and blackberries on the side of the road. The fruit grown on Mt. Etna will blow your mind. Be sure to mention us and spread the word on fruit eating! Check out his website http://www.legendarysicily.it/escursioni-naturalistiche-inglese.php 

Well that’s all for my in depth report on traveling to Italy.  I hope you enjoyed it.  Stay tuned for my next article on Greece!

 Another Free Chapter From Raw Food Controversies 
 
 Share Email Print 
 
Below you’ll find an entire new chapter from my upcoming book The Raw Food Controversies . So far the title is sticking, although I haven’t seriously started looking for another one. Maybe the first idea is the best? I dropped the word“Exposed”from the title. UPDATE! RAW FOOD CONTROVERSIES IS NOW AVAILABLE HERE 

What do you think? In this new chapter, I continue the story of how I got into the raw food diet in the first place. Future chapters will expose my story of decline in health when I followed the wrong kind of raw food diet, the raw food gurus I met and everything I read along the way.

 If you can’t wait to get started now, I suggest the Raw Health Starter Kit as the best resource: 

 http://www.fredericpatenaude.com/starterkit.html 

 “Look Mommy, I Stopped Eating And I’m Still Alive” 

The next book I picked up from the library was the giant tome on fasting by Shelton, which was translated into French as Le jeûne , meaning fasting , but the actual title in English was the longer The Science and Fine Art of Fasting. 

It was a fascinating book on the history of fasting, its use in religion and in the animal kingdom, the physiological changes that occur when someone fasts, and how to use fasting to improve one’s health.

 Shelton’s book made fasting actually sound cool and fun. Because he wanted to prove that fasting was safe, he went to great lengths giving examples of all these people that fasted for long periods of time and were able to keep their energy levels and even keep working.

Although the type of fast Shelton recommended involved absolute rest in bed, he also gave examples of people who fasted up to 40 days on water, and kept working during all that time.

After reading the book, I decided to give fasting a try and fasted for 3 1/2 days on my own. I didn’t rest in bed, but instead stayed active and continued my life as normal.

I found that fasting was a lot easier than I thought. The first day was really easy and I actually had a great amount of energy.

I was biking everywhere, and on the second day of my fast I met my highschool friend Hugo Cromer and told him I hadn’t eating anything for two days and I felt amazing.

He said: “Man, you’re crazy!”

Things got more difficult by the morning of the third day. On the second day, I was very hungry, but energetic. The thought of eating an apple made my mouth salivate.

On the morning of the third day, I felt less hungry and less energetic. I had discovered that my body was adjusting to the physiological effects of fasting and quickly moving in the ketonic state, where it was starting to feed of its own fat reserves.

During that stage, hunger disappears, along with energy. I’ve noticed over the years that the only people who feel amazing and energetic throughout a fast are overweight people. Skinny or thin people feel lethargic as soon as they hit day three. So on the third day, the fast didn’t feel that great.

But I stuck with it, and ate a fruit meal on the morning of the fourth day, which didn’t taste as amazing as I expected. I wasn’t crazily hungry like I was on the morning of the second day, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

What this fasting experience proved to me was that it was definitely possible to live for a while without food, without harming the body.

In my high school biology class, I had learned that the human body would die after 3-4 days without water, and only 7-8 days without food.

I don’t know where my teacher had gotten that information, but when I fasted for 23 days on water in 2005, I certainly disproved her assumption!

 How An Old Frenchman Would Transform My Assumptions About Diet and Health 

For the rest of the summer of 1996, I continued experimenting a little bit with Shelton’s diet, but without taking the plunge.

Towards the end of the summer, I went back to the library to look for some new books to read on diet and health. Among the various titles, from Fit For Life to more of Shelton’s books, I found a few curious-looking book by a Frenchman named Albert Mosséri.

Without really thinking about it, I picked up a few to add to my collection.

When I opened and started reading the first book, La Santé Par la Nourriture (Health Through Diet), I was blown away. After a few chapters, Mosséri had already introduced the concept of eating 100% raw by translating parts of a book by an Iranian author called Hovanessian.

Even though Shelton had kind of mentioned that man’s natural foods should be raw fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, he didn’t insist on that point. But the quotes by Hovanessian were so passionate in advocating a 100% raw diet that somehow I started to share that enthusiasm and felt this was probably the way to go.

The translation of Hovanessian’s book, Raw Eating, was only part of Mosséri’s work. When I started reading Mosséri’s books, time would stop. Without realizing it, I would have spent four or five hours reading.

Mosséri was a student of Shelton, whom he considered his biggest mentor. But Mosséri took a very different standpoint on many crucial aspects of the Natural Hygiene diet where he disagreed with Shelton.

Shelton’s books were written in a very old, ancient style and sounded very formal and severe, like having an old, cranky, puritan grandfather lecture you on morality for hours.

On the other hand, Mosséri was from a different generation (born in 1925, Shelton was born in 1895), and still alive (Shelton died in 1985).

Mosséri’s books were much easier to read, and in them he mixed stories, interesting quotes, personal experience and a kind of dry humor only a native French speaker could appreciate.

When I read Shelton’s books, it felt like I was presented with concepts that were ideological, but impossible to follow. Reading Shelton made you feel he was some kind of super-human, impervious to the influences of modern society, and you were a low-class, corrupted moron for not being 100% pure and natural like he said everyone should be.
 
I only met Mosséri (now 85) once, August 2010
 
Mosséri had a more down-to-earth approach that made you feel like you were normal for struggling in a society that did not promote health, and he also described his personal experience and struggles with interesting stories, which made you feel connected to him, without having met him in person.

The more I read Mosséri, the more I started to understand what was this concept of Natural Hygiene that I had discovered in other books, but never quite understood.

Mosséri was really passionate about Natural Hygiene and really bitter about modern medicine. He also had a lot of experience with his fasting center to back it up, working with some of the sickest people in the world, who came to him as a last resort.

But more importantly, Mosséri was also anti-naturopathic medicines, and spent a lot of pages to disprove everything from homeopathy to herbal medicine.

His main concept, which he got from Shelton, was that healing is a biological process, only the body can undergo. No other outside influences, whether they be drugs or herbal remedies, can heal you. At the most, they will suppress your symptoms and not get at the root of the problem, which what he referred to as the cause. 

 

One example he gave is that of a cold. We know that there are thousands of remedies to get rid of a cold. For example, some people take a drug. Others prefer herbal teas. Yet others go for a more brutal approach, such as drinking a shot of whisky. There are literally hundreds of folk remedies for getting rid of a cold.

Yet what do all of these remedies have in common? Everybody who takes them eventually gets better. But that’s not all…the person who does not take a remedy at all, and just stays in bed and fasts, also gets better, but much faster than everyone else, while addressing the real cause of the cold.

According to Natural Hygiene, and even modern medicine, there is no remedy for a common cold. What all of the remedies have in common is that they suppress the symptoms to some degree. But Natural Hygiene says that the symptoms should not be suppressed, because the dis-ease is an effort of the body to restore its homeostasis, or state of health, and should not be stopped in any way. Instead, we should provide the body with enough rest and other elements of healthful living, so that it can go through the disease naturally and heal itself, without any outside interferences.

The reason why Natural Hygienist use fasting is not because fasting itself cures anything, but because it allows the body to get enough rest (from digestion and physical activity), so that all its energies can be directed towards healing.

As I read Mosséri’s books, I became fascinated with this concept of Natural Hygiene. My mother was a nurse so I had had my exposure to modern medicine and knew it was not always the perfect savior we often believe it is. I now realized that even “natural” medicine were often just less dangerous ways to suppress the same symptoms that drugs try to suppress.

In terms of diet, Mosséri differed from Shelton in a few important areas. He believed strongly that Shelton was wrong in recommending a large amount of nuts and seeds in the diet. According to Mosséri’s experience over the years, the quantity of nuts recommended by Shelton on a daily basis led to some severe health problems (he even went as far as to say that he had know people who had died from those problems).

The problems he mentioned were: bad digestion and gas, constant  hunger caused by malnutrition, skin problems, lack of energy and even cancer.

However, he said that it was not necessary to eliminate all nuts from the diet, but we had to limit them to about five almonds a day! In his later books, he increased that amount to about once ounce.

Mosséri was also against grains like Shelton, but much more vocal about it. He claimed that bread and grains were not meant for human beings because we are not granivores like birds. Grains were acid-forming and were the primary cause of mucus in the body, therefore he said that if you stop consuming bread and grains you will never experience a cold in your life ever again!

He was also anti-meat (which goes without saying), and fish, so essentially all that was left were fruits and vegetables.

In his books, he quoted Hovanessian’s book on Raw Eating extensively, which claimed that a 100% raw food diet was the only way to achieve health. But after this long exposé against cooked food, he gave his own opinion about it, which was more moderate.

Mosséri first quoted some research about some tribes living in New Guinea that were living almost exclusively on cooked sweet potatoes. He said that if cooked foods were so bad, we wouldn’t find a tribe in perfect health living on a mostly cooked diet. However, he said that no tribe had ever been found — in perfect health — living on a diet of 90% bread or grains.

He also said that Hovanessian made these big salads by grating all of these strong vegetables together, like cabbage and onion, with milder vegetables, like carrots and lettuce, and then adding his own dressing of honey and oil.

Mosséri felt that if you couldn’t eat a vegetable raw (like raw cabbage), in large enough quantities, without mixing it in a big salad and camouflaging the strong flavor with questionable items like honey and oil, then you probably shouldn’t be eating that food raw in the first place.

Mosséri claimed to have a very sensitive palate, so he didn’t enjoy the vast majority of vegetables in their raw state. If he only ate the ones he enjoyed raw, then there wouldn’t be much left on the menu.

So as a compromise, he cooked some vegetables, just enough to make them more edible, and included those vegetables with his dinner meal.

Mosséri was also stressed the importance of eating when genuinely hungry. He said that most people do not wait for hunger to eat, but instead wake up in the morning, drink some coffee or other hot beverage that made their throat open unnaturally, and ate something without feeling true hunger. According to Mosséri, eating without hunger led to eat too much, and the wrong foods, which was the primary cause of disease in our society.

He described hunger as a pleasant feeling, not pain (which was a sign of false hunger) , and generally for most people only occurred 4 or 5 hours after waking up, unless they were athletes — in which case they would probably wake up hungry.

He offered a basic menu plan, which were described as the Ideal Diet: 

 

 Morning : Don’t drink anything, don’t brush your teeth. Wait for true hunger. 

 When you feel true hunger, calm it with a few fruits. Repeat a few times during the day. 

 Evening Meal : Either have a big salad (with avocado and acceptable condiments), or cooked potatoes with lettuce, or steamed vegetables. Alternatively, you can have salad at around 4 or 5 p.m. and follow it an hour or two later with cooked vegetables (including potatoes). 

I was really inspired by Mosséri’s writing and decided to give his diet a try. Fortunately for me, one of Mosséri’s favorite foods was potatoes. He was strongly against grains, but gave the green light to potatoes, which were a vegetable and naturally alkaline-forming.

When I experimented with Mosséri’s diet, I discovered that by waiting for true hunger, I would really appreciate the fruits I was eating, and thought it was the best meal on the planet. Many days, I would only start eating at around noon or 1 p.m.

In the evening, I would often make a massive salad, or eat a giant bowl of potatoes with some lettuce.

I found that I really enjoyed the taste of the foods I was eating (even without spices or salt), but I had trouble making the diet work.

Because I would wait for true hunger to eat during the day, and only eat a few fruits at a time, I would feel ravenous at night. I would then devour almost two pounds of cooked potatoes, and then feel tired afterwards.

Because the diet was difficult to maintain, I would often fall of the wagon and eat some junk food, and then pay for it the next day by feeling terrible, which led me to fast even longer, often all day, before I felt true hunger again.

It was my last year of music school (I had decided to finish my curriculum in three years instead of two), and my interest in classical guitar was waning. My true passion now was diet and nutrition, and natural hygiene.

The classical guitar field is extremely competitive and only a small percentage of the very best players eventually become performers. And even most of these performers still have to teach at a university to make a living, because there’s not a whole lot of interest in the world for classical guitar music.

But with health and nutrition, the possibilities were endless. I could see myself working in that field, perhaps even at Mosséri’s fasting retreat, and who knows what the future could hold for me.

So for that last year of music school, although I was determined to complete my studies with flying colors, I knew that I was not going to continue in university and have a future in classical guitar. I wanted to do something with health and nutrition.

For that school year, trying to follow Mosséri’s diet, I felt extremely isolated. I didn’t share my new beliefs with most of my friends because I knew they would think I was crazy (no one can live on fruit and potatoes!).

I spent a lot of time hunting for new fruits at different markets, and would buy exotic items such as papaya, whenever I could afford them.

I also started corresponding with Mosséri. I wrote him long letters, that I would mail to his address in France, and he would always reply back with laconic note that I would ponder for days.

When I told him that I felt so isolated with this new lifestyle in a long letter, he replied saying: “You have to break the isolation. Find other like-minded people you can share your thoughts with.”

Naturally, I wanted to go to France to see if I could land a job working at his fasting center. But when I asked him about that, he replied “I closed down the center so I can focus on writing my books.”

He recommended that I read all of his books and Shelton’s books several times, and also get a basic training in human physiology, which I did by reading more and more books, until I had essentially read everything he and Shelton had written that I could get my hands on.

Towards the end of my school year, around the spring of 1997, I felt my options were running out for what to do the following year. Mosséri had closed down his fasting center and was no longer accepting interns. I did not know any other similar fasting center in the world, and I seriously needed to meet some people in person who shared the same ideas and interests.

I truly felt I was alone in the world, trying to eat this way and learn about Natural Hygiene . I did at some point correspond with some people of my age that I found in the magazine published by the American Natural Hygiene Society, in the “Connections” section, but never met any of them in person.

However, right about that time when the spring flowers were in bloom, I went online for the first time and discovered a book that would give me the answer about what to do next.

 The Main Causes of Disease 

 by Albert Mosséri 

Nature Hygiene, such as explained in my books, is meant for people in developed countries and not to those in the third world, who suffer from problems that are totally different from ours. Hunger and hygiene are endemic phenomena in many of those countries, wheras in Western nations nobody really suffers from hunger and lack of hygiene.

The main causes of disease that affect us are those:

1)      Most people in civilized nations eat without being really hungry, and only because it’s mealtime. Children, who have purer instincts than ours, as well as animals, usually eat only when they are hungry.

2)      Most people eat foods that are not specific to the human race, that is foods that have not been meant for us by Nature. The specific foods for humans are fruits and vegetables.

3)      Modern humans also absorb a lot of poisons to stimulate themselves (coffee, tea, chocolate, refined sugar, alcohol, tobacco, chemicals in foods, etc.)

 Modern humans also take drugs, which are poisons. Very often, these drugs have no other purpose than to suppress the symptoms. 

There are also many other causes of disease (to be reviewed later).

 Don’t miss my next chapter! I will candidly talk about my first trip to California in 1998, when I met David Wolfe and the other raw-foodists of California, and how my health started to go downhill from following the wrong kind of raw food diet.
