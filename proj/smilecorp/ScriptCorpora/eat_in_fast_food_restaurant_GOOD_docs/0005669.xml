Food safety certification regulations in the United States.

Introduction

The vast number of foodborne illnesses A foodborne illness (also foodborne disease ) is any illness resulting from the consumption of food. Although foodborne illness is commonly called food poisoning , this is often a misnomer.  in the United States United States,  officially United States of America, republic (2005 est. pop. 295,734,000), 3,539,227 sq mi (9,166,598 sq km), North America. The United States is the world&apos;s third largest country in population and the fourth largest country in area.  today
results in huge personal, medical, and productivity costs. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture ( USDA USDA, 
 n.pr See United States Department of Agriculture. ) estimates that medical costs and loss
of productivity resulting from seven of the most serious food pathogens
are between $6.5 million and $34.9 billion annually (Partnership for
Food Safety Education, 1997; Food and Drug Administration, USDA,&amp;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA), independent agency of the U.S. government, with headquarters in Washington, D.C. It was established in 1970 to reduce and control air and water pollution, noise pollution, and radiation and to ensure the safe handling and , 1997). Estimates from the Food and
Drug Administration ( FDA FDA

suggest that hospitalizations due to foodborne illnesses cost more than
$3 billion per year, and productivity losses between $20 and $40 billion
per year (FDA&amp;FSIS, 2002).

Incidence is also staggering, with U.S. estimates ranging as high
as 76 million foodborne illnesses per year ( Mead mead   (mēd) , wine made of fermented honey and water, sometimes flavored with spices. It is highly intoxicating. Mead was known in classical Greece and Rome and was the favorite drink of the tribes of N and W Europe.  et al., 1999), 325,000
hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths. Almost three-quarters of the 76
million cases of foodborne illnesses estimated to occur annually in the
United States are thought to be the result of employee mishandling in
food service operations (McGorry, 1998; Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), agency of the U.S. Public Health Service since 1973, with headquarters in Atlanta; it was established in 1946 as the Communicable Disease Center. , 1999; Olsen, MacKinon, Goulding, Bean, and Slutsker, 2000).
Studies indicate that food service workers often lack safe-food-handling
knowledge, especially with respect to temperature control, personal

Manning&amp;Snider, 1993; Wyatt, 1979). The lack of adequate food
safety training is significant because the costs associated with
outbreaks of foodborne illness result in an estimated $7.7 to $23
billion per year to consumers, the food industry, and the U.S. economy
(Council for Agricultural Science Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.  and Technology, 1995). At least one
report has paralleled the increase in consumption of restaurant food
with the increased risk of illnesses being transmitted by food handlers handlers

From the regulatory standpoint, most states traditionally have
relied on health department inspections to evaluate the food handling
(and adequacy of food safety training) in food service establishments.
It is considered likely that some training in safe food handling will
have occurred during, or as a result of, the inspections. In addition,
some training may have been provided through occasional health
department-sponsored training seminars. Most often, however, food safety
training is largely left up to the food service establishment itself, or
the chain that the food service represents.

In today&apos;s economy, it is not surprising that the tremendous
growth of the food service industry, coupled with labor shortages A Labor shortage is an economic condition in which there are insufficient qualified candidates (employees) to fill the market-place demands for employment at any price. This condition is sometimes referred to by Economists as &quot;an insufficiency in the labor force.  and
complicated by a literacy barrier, has resulted in food handlers who
often are trained quickly and inadequately prepared, particularly in sanitation sanitation:  see plumbing; sanitary science.  procedures ( Colorado State University Colorado State University,  at Fort Collins; land-grant with state and federal support; chartered 1870, opened 1879 as an agricultural college, assumed present name in 1957. There is a veterinary teaching hospital, an agricultural campus, and a research campus.  Cooperative Extension,
2001). The result is many dangerous food-handling practices related to
temperature control, personal hygiene, and prevention of
cross-contamination that could have been reduced with better food safety
training. Effective training programs are therefore important, but
effectiveness often is not recognized or even measured. It generally is
evaluated through standardized standardized

With the growing concern over food safety, some states have slowly
begun to turn to mandatory certification of food safety managers as a
way of demonstrating food safety knowledge acquired during training. The
FDA Food Code (FDA, 2001) clearly recommends certification as part of
the demonstration of adequate knowledge in food safety: ... upon request the person in charge shall demonstrate to the
 regulatory authority knowledge of foodborne disease prevention,
 application of the hazard analysis critical control point principles,
 and the requirements of this code. The person in charge shall
 demonstrate this knowledge by compliance with the code, by being a
 certified food protection manager who has shown proficiency of
 required information through passing a test that is part of an
 accredited program, or by responding correctly to the inspector&apos;s
 questions as they relate to specific food operation. 

Studies have suggested that food safety training and certification
have a positive impact on sanitation in food service establishments and
on inspection scores, particularly in establishments with low initial
baseline inspection scores (Cotterchio, Gunn, Coffill, Tormey,&amp;Barry, 1998). Implementation of mandatory-certification regulations,
however, is handled very differently from state to state. The impacts of
different regulations have not been studied, nor has the nationwide
trend toward mandatory certification. The purpose of this paper is to summarize sum·ma·rize

Methodology

Most data for this study of food safety manager certification
regulations were obtained from state food codes found on health
department Web sites (California Department of Health Services Department of Health Services may refer to:

related to training and manager certification were used (Food Safety
Training and Educational Alliance, 2002; National Restaurant Association
Educational Foundation, 2001a). Finally, phone contacts were made to
state health departments as necessary to clarify information from their
Web sites. The data addressed the following issues:

* whether there is mandatory certification in that state,

* whether regulations pertained to managers as opposed to food
handlers,

* whether the certified See certification.  person must be on site at all times,

Results

The oldest known mandatory certification regulation was found in
the state of Washington, which started its program in the 1950s.

make certification mandatory. Certification is not correlated cor·re·late

It is bordered by Massachusetts (S), Vermont, with the Connecticut R. forming the boundary (W), the Canadian province of Quebec (NW), and Maine and a short strip of the Atlantic Ocean (E). , Texas, and Vermont).

In addition to the above states, which have codes clearly mandating
certification, several states have codes requiring the person in charge
to &quot;demonstrate knowledge of food safety&quot; (one way is to pass
an examination) modeled on language from the FDA Food Code. Examples of
such states include Arizona and Delaware. Arizona&apos;s Food Code
states: Based on the risks of foodborne illness inherent to the food
 operation, during inspections and upon request, the person in charge
 shall demonstrate to the regulatory authority knowledge of foodborne
 disease prevention, application of the Hazard Analysis Critical
 Control Principles, and the requirements of these rules. The person
 in charge shall demonstrate this knowledge by compliance with these
 rules, by being a certified food protection manager who has shown
 proficiency of required information through passing a test that is
 part of an accredited program, or by responding correctly to the
 inspector&apos;s questions as they relate to the specific food operation
 (Arizona Department of Health Services, n.d.). 

Among the 17 state food codes that clearly mandate certification,
regulations vary widely, but they generally cover 10 areas or issues:

* who must be certified (managers or food handlers),

* whether the certified individual must be on site at all times,

* recertification,

* approved examinations,

* training requirements,

* exemptions,

* allowed times for coming into compliance for new establishments
and for turnover,

* fees,

* instructor requirements, and

* the way in which certification is checked.

The ways in which these issues are most often regulated are
summarized below; examples from specific states follow.

Issues Covered in State Regulations

Issue 1 -- Certification of Managers Versus Food Handlers

Most state regulations apply to certification of a single
responsible individual (generally an owner or manager or supervisor) per
site, rather than to all food handlers within a food service operation.
Examples of jurisdictions that require only one certified individual per
site include California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah,
and Washington, D.C.

In a few states, regulations are written to include all food
handlers (for example, regulation in the state of Washington).
Certification and testing requirements in these states generally differ
from those in states that require only manager certification; they
reflect the need to affordably and efficiently qualify a vast number of
individuals.

Issue 2 -- Must the Certified Individual Be on Site at All Times?

Most states do not require the certified individual to be on site
at all times. Food service establishments are generally required,
however, to designate des·ig·nate

 2. To give a name or title to; characterize.

 3.  a responsible individual for the (brief) time
periods when the certified individual is not on site. Examples of states
that do not require the individual to be on site at all times include
California and Pennsylvania. Some codes specify that the certified owner
or employee may not be responsible for more than one establishment at a
time (the California code, for example). By contrast, some jurisdictions
require an on-site individual at all times during business hours BUSINESS HOURS. The time of the day during which business is transacted. In respect to the time of presentment and demand of bills and notes, business hours generally range through the whole day down to the hours of rest in the evening, except when the paper is payable it a bank or by a . These
jurisdictions include Illinois (for Category I establishments), Oregon,
and Washington, D.C.

Issue 3 -- Recertification

States are almost evenly divided on how often recertification needs
to be done. Many require that it be done every five years. Examples
include Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi,
and Pennsylvania. Also common is a three-year recertification period.
Examples of states that require recertification every three years
include California, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island,
Texas, Utah, and Vermont. South Dakota requires recertification every
four years.

Some states require recertification at different intervals for food
handlers and managers. The state of Washington, for example, requires
manager recertification every five years and food handler A software routine that performs a particular task. It often refers to a routine that &quot;handles&quot; an exception of some kind, such as an error, but it can refer to mainstream processes as well. The term is typically used in operating systems and other system software.  recertification every three years.

Recertification requirements also vary. Most states require an
examination only. Some states require training but no examination
(Pennsylvania). Others require both (such as Rhode Island and South
Dakota).

Issue Four -- Approved Examinations

Accepted examinations vary tremendously. Most states accept the
four examinations that are offered through the National Restaurant
Association (National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation,
2001b), Experior (2001), the National Registry of Food Safety
Professionals (2002), and the Dietary Managers&apos; Association ( DMA (1) ( D igital M edia A dapter) See digital media hub.

 (2) ( D ocument M anagement A lliance) A specification that provides a common interface for accessing and searching document databases. )
(1997). Examples of these states include California, Florida, and
Massachusetts. These four examinations used to be recognized by CFP 1. CFP - Constraint Functional Programming.
 2. CFP - Communicating Functional Processes.

CFP - Call For Papers (for a conference).  (see sidebar (1) A Windows Vista desktop panel that holds mini applications (gadgets) such as a calendar, calculator, stock ticker and Vonage phone dialer.

Protection-approved examinations.&quot;)

Other states allow different exams not recognized by CFP or accredited accredited

CFP-ANSI-accredited examinations. A very few states have a state
(written) examination (e.g., Illinois and Washington) that may be taken
in place of or in addition to the four examinations previously
recognized by CFP, depending on state regulations.

Issue 5 -- Training Requirements

States are also split over the issue of training requirements prior
to taking of examinations or re-examinations. Examples of states that
have no prior training requirements include California, Louisiana,
Massachusetts, and Utah; these states rely instead on the national
examinations as proof of knowledge. Policies also differ from state to
state with respect to training requirements for certification as
compared with recertification. Following are some examples of training
requirements:

* Minnesota -- 4 &quot;contact&quot; hours required for certificate
renewal;

* Mississippi -- 8 hours required for certification, 4 for
recertification;

* Pennsylvania -- 15 hours required for certification, 7.5 for
recertification;

* Rhode Island -- 15 hours required for certification, 6 for
recertification;

* South Dakota -- 8 hours required for certification, 4 for
recertification;

* Washington state -- 30 minutes (must be taught by a health
inspector A health inspector , or Environmental Health Specialist is a public employee who investigates health hazards in a wide variety of locations, then will take action to mitigate or eliminate the hazards. ); and

* Washington, D.C. -- no training requirements for certification, 2
hours required for recertification.

Issue 6 -- Exemptions

Many state codes do not specifically list exemptions. Among those
that do, facilities that sell non-potentially hazardous foods, those
that sell prepackaged pre·pack·age

exempt. Other exemptions may include food services that are regulated by
other government agencies (health care facilities, for example).
Examples of common exemptions are as follows:

nonpotentially hazardous foods, and nonprofit organizations Nonprofit Organization

Notes:
Examples of non-profit organizations are charities, hospitals and schools. .

Issue 7 -- Times Allowed for Establishments to Come into Compliance

Most state codes do not specify a time period for coming into
compliance when a certified individual has left the employment of the
establishment or when a new establishment is opened. Examples of
&quot;grace periods&quot; for coming into compliance when turnover has
occurred are 60 days (California) and 90 days (Illinois). With respect
to new establishments, Illinois requires new facilities to be in
compliance upon opening, whereas California allows new facilities 60
days to come into compliance.

Issue 8 -- Fees

Most states do not list specific fees, perhaps because the cost of
certification is already incorporated into the examination fees. In
states that do require fees, the state-written exams generally cost less
than a national examination (which ranges in price from $33 to $109). In
addition, state-written examinations that are required for all food
handlers generally cost less than state-written examinations that are
required only for managers or owners. For example, the state of
Washington&apos;s examination fee (which covers all food handlers) costs
$8, whereas Illinois&apos; examination fee (which covers only
managers/owners) costs $35.

Issue 9 -- Instructor Requirements

Many states do not mention instructor requirements. In state codes
that deal with instructor requirements, it is often simply stated that
instructor approval is regulated by the health department.

Issue 10 -- How Certification Is Checked

Few state codes address this issue. Regulations that cover this
issue require that certificates be kept on file in the food service
facility. Some states require that they be brought to the health
department (to obtain a permit, for example). Proof of employment may
also be part of this requirement so that certificates from individuals
who no longer work for an establishment are not used.

Other Issues

The 10 issues outlined above are addressed in several of the state
food codes; two other issues are regulated in at least one state food
code. One of these issues is the penalty for failure to comply
(California&apos;s code states that the state may revoke To annul or make void by recalling or taking back; to cancel, rescind, repeal, or reverse. 

 revoke  v. to annul or cancel an act, particularly a statement, document, or promise, as if it no longer existed.  permits for a
failure to comply and Illinois&apos; code states that an injunction may
be filed against an establishment). The second issue is the requirement
for multiple permits per site (for example, in superstores This is a list of superstores by country. Multi-national 

 Auchan Barnes&amp;Noble (Books, Music, Videos, Magazines) Best Buy (Music, Videos, Electronics, Computer Software, Appliances) Borders (Books, Music, Videos) Carrefour Cora 
  where
separate permits may be required for the deli, the bakery, and so forth)
and how that affects the number of certifications required. California,
for example, specifies that grocery stores with multiple permits are not
required to have more than one person certified.

Discussion

In summary, mandatory state food safety manager certification
regulations vary. This study provides information for regulators as
states continue to move to mandatory food safety manager certification.

Variations in regulations were not unexpected. Differences in the
setup of state regulations occur because of differences in

* state and local health department budgets (which affect the
ability to develop, manage, and enforce regulations, training, and
examinations);

* local standards (which may exceed federal Food Code guidelines guidelines, 
 n.pl a set of standards, criteria, or specifications to be used or followed in the performance of certain tasks.  in
various areas such as frequency of inspection);

* credentials CREDENTIALS, international law. The instruments which authorize and establish a public minister in his character with the state or prince to whom they are addressed. If the state or prince receive the minister, he can be received only in the quality attributed to him in his credentials.  and background of regulators (which affect the
ability to write examinations and coordinate sanitation training);

* the size of the health department (which affects the amount of
time available for training, examination management, and
administration);

* the priorities of the health department (education versus
inspection); and

* perceived needs (risk assessment).

Support in passing legislation (or lack of support) from
legislative authorities, the food service industry, and consumers will
have an impact as well.

The growing trend toward mandatory certification of food safety
managers in sanitation should be a concern for the food service industry
as well. Food service establishments need to become involved in the
process and become more proactive in meeting requirements across the
country. This involvement is particularly important for restaurant
chains that hire, train, and move managers across the country. In this
age of high turnover, the best course of action for national restaurant
chains would be to meet the &quot;strictest&quot; state requirements in
order to achieve the highest levels of food safety as well as provide
flexibility in meeting labor needs.

Mandatory certification of food safety managers also raises the
issue of inspector credentials and inspector &quot;certification.&quot;
Food service managers may question the right of inspectors to require
certification when the inspectors themselves may not have fulfilled any
mandatory education or examination requirements.

Finally, the idea of mandatory certification also raises the issue
of using universally accepted examinations that are based on nationally
accepted standards. The use of validated examinations accredited by
CFP-ANSI simplifies the work of determining which are the best
examinations, but some states have decided to use their own
examinations. When they do so, the states become responsible for
administration of the examinations, as well as validation, security, and
periodic revision. Some of the benefits of having a nationally accepted
standard for the testing of certified food protection managers include
the &quot;free movement&quot; of managers with the necessary credentials
from state to state, and the reduced duplication-of-effort costs in
testing and training (Cotterchio, Gunn, Coffill, Tormey,&amp;Barry,
1998).

More studies need to be done on the impact of mandatory
certification, particularly as it is affected by differences in state
regulations. Possible studies include its impact on food service
inspection scores and on foodborne-illness outbreaks. In addition, it
would be useful to determine how mandatory certification affects
managers&apos; attitudes regarding food safety and their implementation
of good food sanitation practices.

Limitations of this study of state regulations include the small
sample size (more information about county or city regulations would
have been useful and are also recommended for a future study), the
dynamic nature of changing regulations as more states consider mandatory
certification, and the fact that the study does not evaluate differences
in interpretation of regulations at local levels or the impact of local
regulations that may be more &quot;strict&quot; than state regulations.
In addition, it would have been useful to interview all jurisdictions
about future plans regarding mandatory certification, and this kind of
research is recommended for a future study.

Mandatory certification is one tool states may use to ensure
adequate food safety knowledge of food handlers and food managers. As
the labor shortage continues, it will likely become more important, with
adequate food safety training also continuing to be problematic.
Variation in state regulations are not unexpected, but may make
regulations difficult for the food service industry to understand or
meet. Regulators and the food service industry need to work together to
develop regulations that help ensure the safety of food and help prevent
foodborne illnesses.

It is the U.S. member body to ISO and IEC. ). Only three of the four exams that CFP used to
recognize became accredited by CFP-ANSI in 2003:

* the National Restaurant Association&apos;s exam (National

* Experior&apos;s exam (2001), and

* the National Registry of Food Safety Professionals&apos; exam
