&quot;A place to call his own.&quot;

 (...continued from home page...) 

 He finally found another shelter where he could stay&quot;warm and dry,&quot;and then, he started thinking back to the letter he&apos;d written to us from prison.

His life may have been&quot;up in the air,&quot;but there were some things Jerry knew for sure. First, he really needed to change his life, not go back to a life of addiction. Second, he didn&apos;t want to get in trouble and go back to prison. And third, but perhaps most importantly, he wanted to&quot;grow closer to the Lord.&quot;

And that&apos;s just what happened when Jerry was accepted into our men&apos;s recovery program! Daily classes, chapel and Bible study helped him grow spiritually. And his spiritual growth made him want to grow in other directions…to have healthy  relationships, a job and a place of his own!

The first thing Jerry got when he graduated was an apartment. Today, he&apos;s an associate minister at a local church and enrolled in college classes where he&apos;s working toward his technician&apos;s certification in heating and air conditioning.

Thanks to the support of friends like you, Jerry is one more person who has found his place in the Lord&apos;s world!
