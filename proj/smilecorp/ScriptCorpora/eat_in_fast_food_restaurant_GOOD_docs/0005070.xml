I really enjoyed this restaurant. I&apos;ve been there twice and both times my food was wonderful. My husband seems to think that they use too much salt in their cooking. I don&apos;t think so! Anyhow, the atmosphere is great and the service was excellent too! A bit pricey but I thought it was well worth it!
