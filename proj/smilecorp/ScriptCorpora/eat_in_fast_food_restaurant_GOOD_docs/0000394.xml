Tips for Green Mill Restaurant

 Green Mill is Brand New Again. I am up in the area some for meetings and have been at the Coon Rapids Green Mill lately and noticed it is completely new. Everything was really up to date. The food was spectacular and the service was incredible. Even the manager, Jason, came by to say hi. What I will like in the future is using their meeting room in the back, another great update to the place. I am in love with their 1/2 baked pizzas which I always get when I go to these locations.

We didn&apos;t get either. Again, it wasn&apos;t even busy. I grade this experience with an F. …

 Local pizza chain continues to bring in droves of families and friends with gourmet pies and pastas.. In Short 
From sports fans whooping it up at the bar to kids playing at tables and high booths, Green Mill is a rambunctious scene. The decor is surprisingly nice, given the family-friendly vibe: mahogany wood paneling, decorative glass dividers, brick walls and artsy glass light sconces. Most everyone comes for the pizza, whether it&apos;s deep-dish, stuffed or on a cracker-thin seasoned crust. Other dishes include seafood pastas and hot Italian subs. …
