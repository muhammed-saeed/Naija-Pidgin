There may be a few states that require gloves but most states do not require gloves to be worn during food-handling. However, there are companies such as large corporate sandwich shops that require the use of gloves. Bread, cooked meats, dairy products, and condiments do not generally have a high risk factor for hazardous cross-contamination. That is not to say that dairy and meat cross-contamination does not lead to a shorter shelf-life, because the contaminated product will spoil faster.

In situations that could lead to potentially dangerous cross-contamination, such as fish processing or any animal processing that may involve intestines, there may be regulations enforcing the use of gloves but are not necessarily put in place by the health department. Fish processing can be potentially dangerous not only because of fecal matter but also many fish (tuna for example) and shellfish carry histamines that can cause allergic reactions and are easily transferred.

The use of gloves is a tricky subject. Gloves are often used in lieu of washing hands which can lead to cross-contamination of potentially hazardous foods. Also, because gloves are being worn and gloves cost money the wearer is less likely to change gloves as often as they would wash their hands. In general most people would naturally wash their hands, competency aside, after handling potentially hazardous items (including money).

I am going to San Diego soon and I would like a recommendation for a good restaurant. Not super expensive, but good quality food. Possibly seafood or Mexican food, since those are the family favorites.
