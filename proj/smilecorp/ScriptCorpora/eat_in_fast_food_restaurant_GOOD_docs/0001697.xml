​ View photos from our visit to Knaus Berry Farm last season. 

Just yesterday, Knaus Berry Farm opened up. In a few weeks, lines will be seen winding down the street on the slowest of days. And the people will be here for the delectable shakes, baked goods and farm fresh produce.

We stopped by to talk to the bakery manager, Tom Blocher, who told us the farm has been there since the 1950s. &quot;It was my mother-in-law&apos;s cookies that started it all as far as baked goods go for Knaus Berry Farm,&quot; Blocher explained. &quot;After that, baked goods were a main aspect of the farm every year.&quot;
 
They have blueberry, peach, guava, cherry, Key lime, apple, pecan and even shoefly pies. And besides the strawberries, of course, there are those mean cinnamon rolls! And what do they have to say about folks thinking they&apos;re Amish? (the Amish prepare similar goods at farms up north.)&quot;There were never any Amish here, just German Baptist, which to the untrained eye, might fool you.&quot; We say Amish or not, Knaus Berry sure knows how to work a bit of magic in the kitchen and in their produce.

Knaus Berry Farm is now open until mid April, everyday except Sundays from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
