Sheriff&apos;s Office, PSL police warn businesses counterfeit bills being circulated

Police say these two men passed counterfeit money on Sept. 21 in Port St. Lucie. Investigators are looking to the public to help identify them.
 
Port St. Lucie police and the St. Lucie County Sheriff&apos;s Office show the counterfeit $20 and $50 bills seized.
 

 
 PORT ST. LUCIE —
Store clerks might want to pay a little extra attention to customers paying for small dollar items with big number bills.

Police and St. Lucie County sheriff&apos;s detectives on Friday said in recent weeks, a person or persons have passed or tried to pass counterfeit bills at at least seven area businesses.

&quot;The individuals will come in and buy an item of a small dollar amount and get real U.S. currency in return and then move on to the next location,&quot; police Detective Tom Nichols said.

Surveillance footage from a CVS pharmacy shows two men in their 20s, each 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet tall, allegedly trying to buy a soft drink Sept. 21 with a bogus $50 bill. The men weigh 170 to 200 pounds and one has a beard.

It&apos;s unknown whether these two men are responsible for all or any of the other cases, at least three of which are being investigated by the St. Lucie sheriff&apos;s office.

Sheriff&apos;s Detective Scott Young said it appears those responsible are targeting smaller businesses, though he said one of the cases in the county happened at a Walgreens.

He also said law enforcement officials in Indian River County are working cases of counterfeit bills being passed Sept. 27 at the Indian River Mall.

Nichols said it&apos;s a felony to possess counterfeit bills and also a felony to pass counterfeit bills.

Nichols said he doesn&apos;t endorse the use of special counterfeit marking pens. He said they determine the starch content of paper, but said office supply stores carry paper with starch in it.

Young said in some instances counterfeiters sell their product to another &quot;criminal entity.&quot;

&quot;You could have a ring that just prints the currency and you have runners that pass that currency or runners that try to bring in other criminal entities that want to purchase,&quot; Young said. &quot;We certainly don&apos;t know if that&apos;s the case in this juncture.&quot;

Late last month in Martin County, a customer at a fast food restaurant near Kanner Highway and Interstate 95 used two phony twenties.

A cashier at the business said a customer in a Ford SUV used the bills to buy $22 worth of food, and received $18 in change. The worker said she was alerted to the fake bills by another customer, who received the fake cash as change for a $50.

Seems to me the phoney bills are going to be passed out while the meeting is going on, as well. Poor writing.

From the photo, they look like pretty good fakes. Telling us what to look for would help.

I noticed on the picture of the money, the marker they use to check to make sure it is real was used. The mark was brown, which is what color it should be if the bill is real. What is making this money fake?

Isn&apos;t that the reason we had changed all our money to this crap that looks like fake money, so nobody could counterfit the stuff. Oh, I forgot about China.

They&apos;ve been caught before here. Not the same guys, but counterfeiters have been caught.

Hard to catch because they get them into circulation then leave the area and go to another part of the state.

If you happen to get lucky enough to get one of these, you&apos;re out the amount it was. Very hard to get a bank to take it and give you real money because then they are out the amount.

Not to mention how hard in some cases it is to arrest them for it due to what the laws are.

I got a fake twenty last year from an atm in Lakeland. When I approached the bank (where I have an account) they told me there atm was maintained by an armored car service and they were not liable for it. My only recourse was to submit it to the bank for investigation by the Secret Service. They told me if it prooved to be a real bill it would be credited back to my account. About 3 weeks later a credit for the bill appeared on my statement. I assume it was not counterfit after all.
