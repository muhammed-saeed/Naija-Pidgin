 How to Compare the Nutrition of Fast Food Restaurants 
 Jun 14, 2011 | By Chris Sherwood Photo Credit fast food image by Kathy Burns from Fotolia.com 
When you don&apos;t have the skills or desire to cook, or when you&apos;re traveling or too busy to cook your own meals, fast food restaurants often become a top contender for meals throughout the day. Unfortunately, many fast food menu items are not exactly healthy, since many are full of hidden calories, fat and sodium. The good news is that you can compare the foods from different restaurant chains to help you select healthier items during your breakfast, lunch or dinner break.
 
Step 1

Look at the posted dietary information in the restaurant. Many fast food establishments put up posters in their restaurants listing the nutritional facts of the foods they serve. Nutritional information is also sometimes found on the food wrappers or for some chains on the backs of their napkins.
 
Step 2

Look online for the dietary information by visiting the fast food restaurant&apos;s website. Click on &quot;Nutritional Information,&quot; or a similarly named link. Contact the company directly by email, which is often listed on the restaurant&apos;s website, and ask for their nutritional information if it is not readily available online.
 
Step 3

Compare the calories in similar items on the menu. Many fast food menus may have burgers or other food items that can take up as much as 1,000 of your daily allowed calories. Choose the restaurant with the least amount of calories for the food you want. Consider cutting calories further by asking for no mayonnaise to be added to the sandwich, or by going without cheese.
 
Step 4

Compare the levels of saturated fat between restaurants. Choose the restaurant meal with the least amount of saturated fat. Many animal-based foods including meats like hamburger but also toppings such as mayonnaise and cheese contain saturated fat. Foods high in saturated fat are more likely to be high in cholesterol too, which can increase your risk for heart-related problems such as high blood pressure, heart diseases, heart attack and stroke, states the American Heart Association.
 
Step 5

Compare the sodium content of the foods offered by fast food restaurants. Fast food restaurants often add salt in excess in for flavoring of meats, French fries and other menu items. Choose items with lower sodium to keep your daily intake of salt less than the U.S. Department of Agriculture&apos;s recommendation of 2,300 milligrams, or about one teaspoon.
