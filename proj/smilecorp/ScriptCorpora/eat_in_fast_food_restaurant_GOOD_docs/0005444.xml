--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                                  The &quot;one&quot; is quick to cut his losses and move on.:

 On misreading issues (teleprompter vs. Prez Busch tripping over his tongue…what goes around…): the Easter egg roll party he attended, Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen reading Obama’s speech, stopping a speech and telling his teleprompter to &quot;move it on up”, the rise of Privacy in Somalia, our constitution is 20 century old….

 On reverend Rev Wright: &quot; Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views”. [ ...also...&quot;I have been a member of Trinity Church since 1992. I have known Rev. Wright for almost 20 years,&quot; he said at a news conference in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. &quot;The person I saw yesterday is not the person I met 20 years ago.&quot;

 On Rezko by Obama:“ This isn&apos;t the Tony Rezko I knew .&quot; ...by Hillary Clinton: &quot; your contributor, Rezko, in his slum landlord business in inner-city Chicago .&quot; 

 On the Alaskan“Bridge to nowhere”and other pork barrel:“ Others intent on cutting spending have pointed to Alaska&apos;s &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; as a wasteful project. I agree and believe that it represents the first type of project we should cut. But it&apos;s wrong to single out one state&apos;s pork project. If we&apos;re serious about shared responsibility, let&apos;s eliminate all pork projects in all states.” From Florida, where the stimulus package is being well spent surfaced two bridges to nowhere already: a $3million dollars turtle crossing bridge under a freeway and a DOT plans to build a $128 million bridge between Stuart and Palm City, next to an existing bridge just a quarter of a mile away. Another“stimulus bridge”provided by the federal stimulus package would connect two campuses at Microsoft&apos;s headquarters in Redmond and cost us $11 million.

 On Porculus: denouncing Bush on contracting programs and“fiscal irresponsibility”:“There is a fundamental public trust that we–the government- must uphold. The American’s people’s money must be spent to advance their priorities and not to line the pockets of contractors or to maintain projects that don’t work”…Way to go, mister, how do you spell crooks in your administration, lobbyists, pork barrel, pet project, your agenda vs our lives, etc, etc…Trillions already spent and none for my priorities or fix a broken system, just to line the pockets of your electorate, buddies, and congressional representation!

 On creating jobs:“ That is how we will achieve the number one goal of my plan—which is to create three million new jobs, more than eighty percent of them in the private sector.”(that means that 20% would be 600.000 jobs in government growth (GM and Chrysler, Gov owned banks?)…and in June 09, when I wrote this, unemployment has reached 9,5% and private sector is still shrinking its workforce!)

 On Dascle: I screwed up,” Obama said repeatedly during a series of TV interviews.“I take responsibility for this mistake .” 

 On AIG:  &apos;It&apos;s their fault, the Democrats&apos; fault, the Republicans&apos; fault.&apos; Listen, I&apos;ll take responsibility. I&apos;m the president .&quot; 

 On teleprompter:“ &quot;You know I had an entire speech prepared for this wonderful occasion, but now that I am here, I am going to try something a little different—I am going to speak from the heart,&quot; Obama said jokingly as his teleprompter rose from the floor…Biden said:“&quot;What am I gonna tell the president?&quot; Biden said as a gust of wind knocked down his left teleprompter. &quot;I&apos;m gonna tell him his teleprompter is broken. What will he do then?&quot; Did you notice the difference between his elocution with and without the teleprompter: assurance and magnetism vs. every other word is punctuating with an“ahem”that provides for the selection of the right word, leading to neutral, safe and non-committal rants worthy of a speech impaired person and boring to death. I tried to watch his speech on healthcare yesterday and realized that he never EVER watches you in the eyes, you, the viewer, the person sitting in front of him. He keeps on switching from left to right, to left, reading flawlessly whatever the teleprompters off cameras show him. He is to political speeches what Britney is to singing with lip synch devices: painful to watch!

 On his wet dream:“ Just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhere to live free from fear in the 21st century. (Applause.) And as nuclear power -- as a nuclear power, as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act. We cannot succeed in this endeavor alone, but we can lead it, we can start it. So today, I state clearly and with conviction America&apos;s commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. (Applause.) I&apos;m not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, &quot;Yes, we can.&quot;

 On Americans and Muslim countries: &quot;The United States has been enriched by Muslim Americans. Many other Americans have Muslims in their family, or have lived in a Muslim-majority country. I know, because I am one of them.&quot; Nota: hundreds of thousands of US soldiers have lived in Muslim countries too…and have been enriched by the knowledge that life sucks there! That is why all these Muslims are coming over here, right?

 On war with Islam: President Obama stated that“the U.S. &quot;is not and never will be at war with Islam,&quot;…and portrayed terrorist groups such as al-Qaida as extremists far removed from the vast majority of Muslims. Really? Let’s list the Muslim countries that are friendly to the US, where US citizens can roam freely and exercise their freedom of speech, religion, sexual preferences, etc…: Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Yemen, Egypt, and West Africa, Lebanon….

 On the Swine flu”and containment :“ it would be akin to closing the barn door after the horses are out. Because we already have cases here in the United States.”…like in: the boat hit an iceberg and is taking water quickly…sir, sir, we are sinking! Well…water is already in so don’t bother plugging the hole! 
 
 On Sotomayor and her racist comment:“ &quot;I&apos;m sure she would have restated it,&quot; he said…and believe him…he knows about re-stating, over and over again! But she did have a chance to restate it Mr President! Your Ivy League Latina pick actually said the same thing, almost verbatim, three years in a row: in 2001, 2002 AND 2003 and made allusion to her race and gender in about 80 opinions she wrote, according to the news media. She also deeply believes that exams are racists, whatever it means for the people who fail them, white included! But she will get nominated because she does not need talent when the Democrats have the majority, and the majority leader himself, Mr Reid (read optional?!) stated in June .during the love frenzy between lefty senators in various photo ops with Sotomayor:“I understand that during her career she has written hundreds and hundreds of opinions. I haven’t read a single one of them , and if I am fortunate, before we end this, I won’t have to read one of them!”. I wonder if the Prez has read any?

 On his economic“Bridges to nowhere”stimulus plan and predictions, by his first man: “Everyone guessed wrong at the time the estimate was made about what the state of the economy was at the moment this was passed,&quot; Biden said. Anything else you tried to guess: the cost of healthcare, the cost of GM and Chrysler, the impact of your stimulus, the virtual jobs you saved and the real one that were not created?...

 On his manipulating of the free press: “&quot;I know Nico Pitney is here from the Huffington Post,&quot; he said &quot;I know that there may actually be questions from people in Iran who are communicating through the Internet. Do you have a question?&quot; Pitney has been called the day before by the White House and asked to come up with such a question. Obama went on to another pre-planned question to Macarena Vidal representing a Spanish speaking show and went on to crack jokes until he called it a day and walked away despite a question by Mike Allen: &quot;Mr. President! May I ask about Afghanistan? No questions about Iraq or Afghanistan?&quot;


 On Congress:“ They have hearings, they write white papers, and then suddenly the lobbyists and the special interests start going at it. And the next thing you know, another 10 years has gone by, and we still haven’t done anything.”…no comments! You can trust him: he knows!

 On his crashing teleprompter: &quot;Oh, goodness, Sorry about that, guys.&quot;…fortunately the other one was still working and he was able to finish his speech. Another American must have become jobless on that day!

 On judges and applying the law: Obama has stated that a critical factor in judging was &quot;what is in the judge&apos;s heart,&quot; and that Judge Sotomayor had been selected for the Supreme Court because of her ability to apply her life experience–as a female minority-to her cases. Unfortunately, grilled on the matter, Sotomayor stated: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t approach the issue of judging in the way the president does,&quot; she said. &quot;Judges can&apos;t rely on what&apos;s in their heart. They don&apos;t determine the law. Congress makes the laws. The job of a judge is to apply the law.&quot;

  On his Harvard buddy, the sooo famous Professor Gates: It seems like Henry Louis Gates, the Harvard Professor, was arrested in his Cambridge home for a few good reasons: barking at the officers, hiding behind his oversized egocentric race card and arrogantly refusing to comply with legitimate requests. Was he racially profiled or just booked for being stupid? President Obama, from his high chair and prestigious position became judge and jury by stating on record that the police were &quot;acting stupidly&quot; to arrest his friend. Should he be focusing on important things, like fixing our economy or bailing out Kevin Johnson? He was not there was he? But he knows that all the cops are black killers and every white is a racist. Every black with a NAACP card knows that! I was not there either but I can judge too! I can picture the arrogant old fool trying to turn his pampered stupidity (forced his own door) into a civil right-like struggle . Like most of us whites, he should have complied peacefully and THANKED THE Police for responding quickly. After all, they rushed to protect the property of a rich black man, property that was reported as being burglarized. Does the professor know that at the end of the day he has more chances to fall murdered by another black than from Police brutality? (FBI data: In 2007, 3221 blacks were murdered. 2905 of them by other African Americans). 

 Ivy league + affirmative action = cry baby: “&quot;I think it&apos;s fair to say, No. 1, any of us would be pretty angry. No. 2, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home. And No. 3—what I think we know separate and apart from this incident—is that there is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately, and that&apos;s just a fact.&quot; Maybe they should just stop breaking the laws!


 On open debate on Healthcare: We&apos;ll have doctors and nurses and hospital administrators, insurance companies, drug companies —they&apos;ll get a seat at the table, they just won&apos;t be able to buy every chair. But what we will do is, we&apos;ll have the negotiations televised on C-SPAN, so that people can see who is making arguments on behalf of their constituents and who are making arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the insurance companies.” Instead of C-Span, we now have close doors committees and cannot even see the list of the names of health care executives or special interests who visit the White House for closed-door 
 
On the media for not helping:  On health care, the media has &quot;a lack of sustained focus on the facts,&quot; and it“makes it very difficult”    to sell the plan. I guess MSNBC and moveon.org need to cater to the chief a little more…Bad, bad media…  not blindly marching to his drums anymore!    

 On calling the Cambridge cops stupid: President Obama said Friday that he has he used the wrong words calling the action stupid and should have &quot;calibrated those words differently.&quot;   He stated: &quot;I want to make clear that in my choice of words, I think I unfortunately gave an impression that I was maligning the Cambridge police department and Sgt. Crowley specifically. And I could&apos;ve calibrated those words differently.&quot; Eventually, he also called the white police officer to let him know all the good he thought of him….blah blah blah…

 On races, last year while campaigning against Rev Wright-Jackson-Sharpton-WEB Du Bois: “That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends. But it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table. At times, that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes along racial lines, or to make up for a politician’s own failings.”No kidding? “But I have asserted a firm conviction—a conviction rooted in my faith in God and my faith in the American people—that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds, and that in fact we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union.” 

 On the media for making him look stupid on his comment on the“stupid”action of the cops in Cambridge:   “it is the media&apos;s &quot;obsessions&quot; that are keeping alive his comments about the arrest”              

 On his $900 billion health care porculus that  did not meet his August recess deadline: &quot;We did give them a deadline, and sort of we missed that deadline. But that&apos;s OK, We don&apos;t want to just do it quickly, we want to do it right.&quot;   No kidding…they did everything to shove the monster down our throats before going on vacation and now the“delay”(amendments and lipstick on the pig to please more Democrats) is something good…to make it right! Really? Also, what about the accounting gimmicks to keep it under $1 trillion? What about the $245 billion to increase doctor’s fees under Medicare? $1,145 trillion minimum…let’s talk about it in five or ten years.

 On the opposition to his healthcare reform: &quot;They run their ads. And let&apos;s face it, they scare people,&quot; Yet Obama has gathered an incredible mass of supportive special interests groups: &quot;We have the American Nurses Association, we have the American Medical Association on board,&quot; Obama told the weekend crowd in Grand Junction, Colo. &quot;We have an agreement from drug companies to make prescription drugs more affordable for seniors. ... The AARP supports this policy.&quot; But Gibbs, the mouthpiece for the administration clarified the situation: White House spokesman Robert Gibbs seemed to understand as much when he said the administration is benefiting from the help of &quot;interest groups,&quot; avoiding the more unsavory term &quot;special interests. It&apos;d be sort of odd to go to a town hall meeting and rail against interest groups that are supporting reform ... who have acknowledged that it&apos;s time for health care reform,&quot; he said. The president&apos;s criticism is aimed at &quot;interest groups that are aligned to keep the status quo either because it benefits them or they have a vested interest.&quot;           Got it! The good special interest groups that can lobby, versus the bad one that are evil!

 On AARP supporting his health care plan: Obama recently shot himself in the foot–again- when he said at the town hall that &quot;we have the AARP onboard because they know this is a good deal for our seniors. AARP would not be endorsing a bill if it was undermining Medicare.&quot; Unfortunately, he was quickly rebuked and AARP&apos;s chief operating officer Tom Nelson promptly replied that &quot;indications that we have endorsed any of the major health care reform bills currently under consideration in Congress are inaccurate.&quot; The teleprompter has been fired! 

 On the media–again- for not supporting him on healthcare and reporting–how dare they- the opposition across the country: &quot;TV loves a ruckus, What you haven&apos;t seen on TV and what makes me proud are the many constructive meetings going on all over the country.&quot; I guess what makes him proud are the people his lackeys have libeled as Nazi, terrorists, right wing nuts, etc, etc…go figure!

 On Washington D.C AND Congress :”Everyone&apos;s getting all &quot;wee-weed up&apos;&apos; in Washington? ”. According to Gibbs, the White House mouth piece, Obama referred to bed wetting, to the state of mind of the politicians faced with the frustration of the healthcare plan and the plunging approval ratings of the“one we have been waiting for”. (new low-point in the president&apos;s public job approval-ratings - down to 51 percent this week in the Gallup Poll, the Pew Research Center&apos;s poll and the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released this week. An ABC/Washington Post poll today shows that fewer than half of Americans surveyed - 45 percent - support the health-care reform as it has been explained to date, with 50 percent opposed.)


 On his Green Czar, the radical leftist Van Jones, through his White House speaker:” The President &quot;doesn&apos;t endorse&quot; Jones&apos;s participation to the 9/11 Truth movement (revisionist of the 9-11 events), radical racial and political statements, and his support for a cop killer on death row”. Sort of late to realize that radicals are radical, Mr Prez! How do you spell D.U.M.P.E.D? 

 On his healthcare plan: He used to hammer around: &quot;I keep on saying this but somehow folks aren&apos;t listening: If you like your health-care plan, you keep your health-care plan. Nobody is going to force you to leave your health-care plan,&quot; Sept 10, that has become &quot;Nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have. Let me repeat this: Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.&quot; The word REQUIRE is important because it says that the Government intent is not to have your plan changed–a requirement from the top- but there is not much they can do to prevent it from happening.

 On the cost of his Healthcare revamping: &quot;I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits either now or in the future. Period.&quot; I guess his plan“will create or save”dollars and won’t increase the deficit…like the jobs and the economy…We have created or saved one million jobs blah blah…safe and final but impossible to prove one way or the other.

 And the 17 million uninsured missing in his 9/9/09 speech: &quot;There are now more than thirty million American citizens who cannot get coverage.&quot; Up to September, we were hammered with the 47 million uninsured Americans. Now 30 millions? Were the 17 millions now missing not Americans, like illegals? Or by some mysterious process, did these people find some kind of insurance, another miracle by the administration that creates or save? On July 23, he said, &quot;This is not just about the 47 million Americans who don&apos;t have any health insurance at all…&quot;

 On rapper Kanye West’s way he treated 19 year old white country singer Taylor Swift at some music event: &quot;He&apos;s a jackass,&quot; . Realizing he might have made a mistake being so candid, he tried to get his comment back and is on record saying. &quot;Come on guys, cut the president some slack. I&apos;ve got a lot of other stuff on my plate.&quot;. 


 On the ACORN debacle: On ABC, President Obama said that“he does not really follow ACORN much”….sure…they just contributed $800k to his campaign and not only did he represent them as a lawyer but he also helped train the organizers of the association when himself was a community organizer…He never lies…just misrepresent reality! Could have he said:“&quot;The ACORN I saw yesterday is not the person I met 20 years ago.&quot;

 On his failed Olympic bid for Chicago:  “I think it’s always a worthwhile endeavor to promote and boost the United States of America and invite the world to come see what we’re all about,”Totally right Sir! Not much to see in your hometown and people chose skin and thongs over….what is there again in Chicago? On his catering to voters: “we will never forget Katrina”...and how can we forget the“Super Dome”and its refugees beat up, looted, raped, murdered by their own…and the New Orleans police officers looting shops along regular looters,…and the gang bangers taking over the streets and firing weapons at rescue choppers and firefighters. It was so bad that we had to send the national guard to kill these bastards…and the lines of empty flooded buses the city did not even try to use to evacuate its citizens…and the abandonment of the weakest by their own people. How can we forget the incompetent Mayor Nagin or democratic Governor Blanco…she was so good and the Bush administration so bad that she did not even try to run against a conservative candidate that easily won the state (Bobby Jindal). How come she knew she had no chance? How come Alabama and Mississippi were able to recover in a couple of months? How come New Orleans and Louisiana are the only place in America where the worst of the people came up during a natural disaster. I remember the 2007“five star”treatment of the 20.000 fire refugees in the Qualcom stadium in san Diego…do you! Why such a difference?
   


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


$829 billion!!! Could you run it by me again? We moved to a Government run healthcare system to cover our huge amount of uninsured. Interestingly, the numbers of people that the plan is supposed to help shrunk with time. It was around 50 million people during the campaign and all the way to August 09. Out of the blue, it went down to 30 million in the President’s speeches and now, papers are talking about 18 million people who cannot afford health care. Here is a quick and cheap fix: give 1 million to each of these identified 18 million and turn them into instant millionaires with no excuse not to get healthcare. Also, pass a couple of laws to prevent insurers not to deny coverage for existing conditions, define care that should be reimbursed and cosmetics, cap prices on things like frame for glasses, ambulance rides, X ray or crutches and monitor and punish fraud and abuses on both client and provider side. That would save us $811 billion people!

On 9 September 2009, like every year since 2001, I got up, put on my“special”T-shirt and went out to display the American flag arguing with my wife that people are forgetting about the tragedy and that we must remind them at work, school, everywhere. I picked up my daily newspaper and sure enough, Rememberance day was not front page news Also, to add amazement to surprise,“Muslims and Holy month of Ramadan”was the Region pages main topic. How sensitive! We certainly don’t want to remind people that there is anti-American evil around and that 3000 civilians were targeted and murdered on that day by 19 cowards not even representative of a nation or its legitimate army. On 9-11-2001, they performed a mass murder. Some of the victims jumped to their death to avoid raging fires, fought to crash a plane or waited powerless for the buildings to collapse while saying their last goodbyes on their cell phones. I remember…do you?. And thank you to the teachers who said that talking about 9-11 is not in the curriculum. It makes sense, like not talking about May 8, July 27, Sept 2, 9-11, Nov 11, Dec 7…Whatever! I made 9-11 part of the curriculum and removed my kids from school for the day. We attended the Rememberance ceremony together in Folsom. My wife was in her United Airlines uniform and I wish I could have worn my Army uniform too. Flags and anthems, 21 shot volley and a Bell, and the Taps and inspiring speeches, prayers and testimonies…that morning, I was especially proud to live in Folsom. I wish we had more children representing our numerous schools and organizations, more teenagers, more people to learn and perpetuate the souvenir. I also wish we had some representatives of our Muslim community that have found a tolerant home in this town. They should have been there too, standing at our sides.&quot;I can die now. Heaven will be in the memories of those who remember!&quot;. Do not forget!

Obama’s judgment? Another dumped nominee, another lefty lunatic. 

Van Jones’discreetly resigned on a Sunday morning of a Labor Day weekend. I guess he did not want to be yet another distraction to President Obama–who did not personally comment on that- and wanted to join the club of the previous radical nominees that could not stand scrutiny. The unelected and un-paneled so called“Green Czar”was known since day one for his racial and liberal radicalism. Is hysteric past just caught up with him! In a perfect Obama fashion, Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean said that“Jones didn&apos;t realize what he was signing at the time”when he signed a petition calling for“an investigation into possible Bush administration involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks”. Obama would have said:“this is not the Jones I knew!”. Instead, Gibbs, Obama’s mouthpiece t thanked Jones &quot;for his service to the country&quot; and said that the President &quot;doesn&apos;t endorse&quot; Jones&apos;s participation to the 9/11 Truth movement (revisionist of the 9-11 events), radical racial and political statements, and his support for a cop killer on death row. Sort of late to realize that radicals are radical, Mr Prez! How do you spell D.U.M.P.E.D?

Talking about Czars, what’s up with that unaccountable administration with so many friends and favorites appointed without the scrutiny of Congress, and so little administrators. As of Mid August, 43% of top positions were still open in the administration. America is going empty, with nobody at the helm of crucial departments. Sure, Obama’s nomination process has been such a fiasco that the president is now careful on who will be next: a tax cheat or a pay for play guy!

 Déjàvu! The slippery slope to a declawed intelligence apparatus

“My husband was picked up by the Guatemalan military. He was captured alive in 1992. Then they falsely stated that he had been killed in combat. I found out six months later that he was, in fact, still alive, that they had faked his death in order to torture him long term, with medical assistance to avoid accidentally killing him”

Jennifer Harbury did not want to let go and after almost three years, a 32-day hunger strike in Guatemala and her 1995 14-day hunger strike in front of the White House, she finally attracted the attention of the media, attention that incited a State Department operative (Mr. Nuccio) to leak classified information to U.S. Rep. Robert Torricelli. The latter blew the whole thing into the open: The documents showed that the CIA was running death squads in South America and that criminals on CIA’s payroll were murdering and torturing thousands, even American citizens! Also, it exposed that Jennifer’s husband had been captured, tortured for two years and killed by Col. Julio Roberto Alpirez, a Guatemalan Intelligence officer and CIA operative also suspected of the murder of Michael DeVine, a local innkeeper of US nationality.

Rep. Torricelli drove his point home and showed Congress that the CIA was paying criminals and providing“technical assistance”to a Guatemalan group tasked to“eliminate”dissidents using kidnapping, torture and murder. According to Amnesty International, 110,000 civilians fell victims of the Guatemalan G2 since 1978…and the CIA helped, supported by the various US administrations. He also exposed the fate of about 350 prisoners held in illegal and brutal conditions similar to Jennifer’s husband’s, and the complacency or misleading attitude of both the CIA and some US Embassies.

Toricelli’s quest eventually forced the Clinton administration to reform the CIA and forbid the agency to associate itself–and the country- with shady characters, criminals or terrorists groups. Suddenly, HUMINT–Human Intelligence- took the back seat and clean high tech SIGINT–Signal Intelligence- became the main Intelligence gathering media for the country.

Nota: A few years later Jennifer Harbury took the matter to the Supreme Court but her lawsuit against high officials of former President Bill Clinton&apos;s administration–State Secretary Warren Christopher among them- Was eventually rejected. She had accused them of lying to her about the status of her former husband, Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, a Guatemalan guerrilla she had chosen to marry. She lost and America moved on.

When President Clinton chose to cut our military down to 10 active combat divisions from the 20 we originally had, it was just a good political move to reward part of his electorate and redirect money from the Defense Budget to the typical Democrat social pandering. No war in sight and the Cold one done with, it seemed like a safe move. But preventing our intelligence community from hiring informants of questionable morals and ethics was shortsighted. It did change the focus from a balance of“dirty”Human Intelligence (HUMINT)and modern and“clean”Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) to an all SIGINT system. And we now know the long term results (and they are always long term!).  

We were not able to foresee the rise of Al Qaeda, the rise of Bin Laden and the 9-11 plot two years in the making before it actually happened. We were also not able to capture or kill Bin Laden, nor confirm or not the status of Saddam’s WMD program.

The Bush administration and other Intelligence or Defense bi-party committees at Congress actually had to rely on“stale”SIGINT pieces of information and incomplete analysis coming from the highly inefficient and politically correct intelligence tool that the CIA had become under President Clinton…and 9-11 happened! 

Obama’s second executive order banning torture was reminiscent of the Clinton move of the mid nineties. It is indeed an effective way to please local supporters but it has shown the enemies abroad that they won’t be forced to“cooperate”if or when captured, and it has also neutered again our intelligence community.  

Today, the Attorney General of the Obama administration is attacking the CIA based on old memos that were readily available to Congress and most likely read by the past bi-partisan intelligence committees. Officially, the White House wants to move on and has setup new“Interrogation Teams”trained on the Politically correct Army’s interrogation procedures. But it looks like our AG has decided otherwise. Anyways, threatening to take to court, prosecute and eventually punish CIA operatives who have followed the letter and the intent of the former administration’s interrogation legal guidelines would amount to the re-declawing of the agency and its total“neuterization”.

The controversial guidelines went through a legal review, were shared with Congress and approved by the Government of the time until President Obama took power. Maybe some rogue consultants or operatives got over-zealous and must be punished. But globally, revisiting the past will be effectively demonstrating that whatever politics implemented by an administration, can be revisited and condemned by another. In another words: don’t do anything legal today that could take you to jail tomorrow. 

At the end of the days, it is not about abuses committed by our agencies–they should be exposed and punished- but about our successive poll driven administrations ran by poll driven politicians trying to please their followers. Blanket policies or blanket solutions don’t work.

The Clinton administration should not have passed a blanket policy banning the hiring of shady people. Instead, it should have reviewed the CIA payroll, kicked out the people we did not want to associate with, cleaned up the house and let them run their HUMINT business under oversight.

The Obama administration should not bag it all up in the same bag and pretend to be righteous (we are still using Blackwater services, using the Domestic surveillance law, applying“extreme rendition”, supporting Guatemala, etc…). Instead, some basic questions should be asked and answered:  Were the“enhanced interrogation techniques”legal? Did Congress know? Were they applied correctly? Were there abuses? Are we compliant with the Geneva’s convention’s description of a combatant and of a prisoner of war (chapt 4, http://www.genevaconventions.org/ ).?

 Interestingly, the White House wants to separate itself from the AG’s“independent”investigation. Also, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has claimed again and again that the CIA has lied to Congress and to her about the“enhanced interrogation techniques”the left has called torture for half a decade. She told the press again and again that our intelligence agency has misled Congress under President Bush, another“Watergate-like”scandal! But the Democrats killed a bill for an independent investigation panel. Who are they trying to fool? Who would believe that in this new era of coming out clean,“mopping up after President Bush disastrous politics”, the Democrats who control Congress would not jump on yet another opportunity to show the people how evil the Bush apparatus was and get back at Cheney?  

President Obama had no clue on what Pandora box he has opened when he played politics with the old CIA memos. Putting a lid on such an issue now would be seen as covering up for the most powerful Democrat in the House. Too late for that! It is time for a total exposure…of the hypocrisy of our politicians, Republicans AND Democrats! 

In the meantime, if I were a CIA agent, I would play it safe and draw my salary until retirement without risking a career standing up for politicians and politics.

If I were considering a career as an Intelligence Officer for any of the Intelligence agencies–CIA, FBI, NSA…- I would just grow a brain and do something else, like study law and become a shyster lawyer or a community activist.

If I were to plan a major attack on US soil or against US interests, I would start now!

Sleep well!

On 9 September 2009, like every year since 2001, I got up, put on my“special”T-shirt and went out to display the American flag arguing with my wife that people are forgetting about the tragedy and that we must remind them at work, school, everywhere. I picked up my daily newspaper and sure enough, Rememberance day was not front page news Also, to add amazement to surprise,“Muslims and Holy month of Ramadan”was the Region pages main topic. How sensitive! We certainly don’t want to remind people that there is anti-American evil around and that 3000 civilians were targeted and murdered on that day by 19 cowards not even representative of a nation or its legitimate army. On 9-11-2001, they performed a mass murder. Some of the victims jumped to their death to avoid raging fires, fought to crash a plane or waited powerless for the buildings to collapse while saying their last goodbyes on their cell phones. I remember…do you?. And thank you to the teachers who said that talking about 9-11 is not in the curriculum. It makes sense, like not talking about May 8, July 27, Sept 2, 9-11, Nov 11, Dec 7…Whatever! I made 9-11 part of the curriculum and removed my kids from school for the day. We attended the Rememberance ceremony together in our town. My wife was in her United Airlines uniform and I wish I could have worn my Army uniform too. Flags and anthems, 21 shot volley and a Bell, and the Taps and inspiring speeches, prayers and testimonies…that morning, I was especially proud to live here. I wish we had more children representing our numerous schools and organizations, more teenagers, more people to learn and perpetuate the souvenir. I also wish we had some representatives of our Muslim community that have found a tolerant home in this town. They should have been there too, standing at our sides.&quot;I can die now. Heaven will be in the memories of those who remember!&quot;. Do not forget! 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


&quot;Before leaving town for a 10-day vacation, Obama met Friday with former Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, an expert on health care policy and politics who was Obama&apos;s first choice for secretary of Health and Human Services before tax troubles derailed his nomination. A White House statement said the two &quot;agreed that substantive reform that lowers costs, reforms the insurance industry, and expands coverage is too important to wait another year or another administration.&quot;


Good job...ask a tax cheat how to fix the healthcare system!

Do we negotiate with rogue states?

Secretary of State Clinton stating August 2 that North Korea’s missile-launching provocation is the behavior of a brat. She said that“What we’ve seen is this constant demand for attention, and maybe it’s the mother in me or the experience that I’ve had with small children and unruly teenagers and people who are demanding attention—don’t give it to them, they don’t deserve it, they are acting out,”. That is why we have sent former president Bill Clinton to pick up the two journalists that North Korea had already agreed to release, thus allowing Kim Jong a nice photo op with beloved Clinton, and the local communist media to declare that along with the prestigious envoy, came a letter of apologies from Obama. Way to go and reward bad behavior! Of course there was not such letter–I hope- and of course, despite denials from the White House, this was not a private initiative. Korea 1, Community organizer 0.

Soon to come to the surface: what we gave up or exchange.

Question to you: should we bail out at any price all these people who put their lives in danger and the country at risk by ignoring the State Department travel advisories? What good did the female journalists or the Berkeley writers/hikers do to the world of news or intelligence? They took incredible risks to break the glass ceiling of journalism and report on secluded and repressive countries. They wanted to make a name for themselves…they did eventually. But what diplomatic price did we pay? Kim Jong was all smile while treating a former US President with benevolence. For a supposedly dying guy ready to vacate power, he looked energetic and talkative, on top of his game. He brought us to his own negotiation table and had us beg for the two girls. He pardoned them, meaning they are still guilty of all charges but forgiven by the good old man. And all that while Hillary, the State Secretary and wife of the envoy, was taking a firm stand against North Korea and was embroiled in a name calling game with them (she compared them to unruly teenagers and they labeled her a“funny lady, that someteime looks like a primary school girl and sometime a pensioner going shopping”They also said“her words suggest that she is by no means intelligent”.

What the hell is going on out there?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Do you know or remember the motto of the United States Postal Services? &quot;Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds&quot;. It looks like what the elements have never been able to do, disrupt the service, is going to happen because past generous pension plans. From Public Service to Self Service….seems familiar?

 Scary times? You tell me. 

Michael Jackson died suddenly at 50, reminding us of our human vulnerability and what a talented artist and role model he was. Congress even had a minute of silence and the whole world watched his last performance in a stadium named after a stationary company. President Obama is now considering the permanent wearing of a white glove, in memoriam. And the world cried, and many cashed in, and Al Jackson and Jesse Sharpton–or the other way around- seized the opportunity to make a comeback, and the black community made the final claim for their hero despite the fact that he spent most of his adult life erasing his negritude.  

In the meantime, while every single media was covering the circus and deifying the has-been that could never be again, the world has changed and not for the best. While we all mourned that bizarre being that has been mostly known for his freaky side than remembered for his hits of 20 years ago, North Korea ramped up its belligerent attitude and fired seven missile on July fourth, as promised. Our administration took the threat seriously enough to beef up the missile defense of the islands of Hawaii but remained pretty low key and helpless after Kin Jong’s contribution to our national day…The bully has tested us again and we went back to the UN, our tail between our legs.


In Iraq, the withdrawing of the US forces has indeed led to chaos and violence is steadily increasing toward the bloody sectarian violence of the past. So much for victory! 

In Iran, the cleric dictatorship has rigged the elections to extend Ahmadinejad’s leadership, and also violently suppressed demonstrations while accusing the West of supporting the unrest. Most recently, America and England have been told to stop criticizing what was happening…or else. Tweeter has become a“regime changer”–scary thought- and Moussavi presented as a great reformer and believed by many to be the“changes Iran has been waiting for”. Unfortunately, the fact that he might have been cheated from his victory does not make him the reformer we are hoping for. At a recent interview with the German magazine“Der Spiegel”, he made it clear for everybody: He believes in Iran getting its nuclear weapons, believes that America must come forward humbly to restore soured relations, believes that Israel is the enemy, believes that the Palestinians need their state back. About the holocaust…well…he said that“something must have happened”for all these people to try to run away…Moussavi is the party, the dictatorship and has shown how efficient he was when“war minister”during the Iran-Iraq conflict, he set up a formidable economy of war and jailed thousands of people. He is Ahmadinejad in a suit. He is to the educated and city dwellers the polished nationalist that could replace the rough and wild Ahmadinejad, the president of the workers and the poors. Anyways, Iran has shown us it true face again and with Ahmadinejad president for another term, and a crushed opposition, we already know what the next years are going to look like: anti Israel and anti-occident rhetoric, finalization of a nuclear weapon system, active support of Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine, and eventually active support of the Shiites and Al Sadr militias in Iraq to get rid of the Sunnis. 

In Pakistan, the US forces are getting more and more involved at getting rid of the Taliban heavens in the tribal areas. Every day, some drone blows up dozens of bad guys to pieces along with the unfortunate collateral damages that come with such blanket operations. How long until ground forces officially move in too? How long until we discover that US soldiers are already on the ground? 

In Afghanistan, the surge is on the way with a massive US offensive to dislodge the Talibans from their various Southern safe heavens. 

In Somalia, our money will arm the current regime and support its fight against the local Muslim clans. How long until ground forces are needed to prevent total chaos and also stop the piracy?

In China, Muslim minorities from the North are being repressed for refusing to be oppressed. Like in Nepal, the Chinese government is moving in quickly and strongly without any reaction from the US. Congress and the President were prompt to criticize Iran for its repression of the various“democratic”demonstration but interestingly stays pretty silent with China. After all, China is the backbone of our economy now and since day one, our administration has made it clear that the US would not let some human right issues hinder our economic and financial relationship.(“our pressing on those issues–human rights- can&apos;t interfere on the global economic crisis, the global climate change crisis and the security crisis,&quot; Hillary Clinton / 2009).

And Russia generously offering us the Russian sky and ground routes for the logistic support of our war in Afghanistan, after having been instrumental at getting its former Asian satellite republics to kick us out or triple the“rent”.. Because of our support to Georgia in August 2008, Russia literally kicked us out of the Russian airspace and out of our rear bases in the former Soviet Central Asian states of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Suddenly we have lost our critical resupply route to Afghanistan (Nato imports about 70 per cent of its food, fuel, water and equipment from Pakistan via the Khyber Pass, and flies in much of the rest through Russian airspace via bases in Central Asia. -Timesonline UK-). NATO had to choose between a rock and a hard spot, between Pakistan, Russia, or an expensive and nightmarish non sustainable airlift solution! But thanks to President Medvedev-Putin’s“generosity”, and Pakistan’s instability, new Russian routes have been opened and we are back in business. Sure! Now the Russians have full control of the outcome of our war and the bill is coming soon. What will the Obama administration give to“win”its war against Bin-Laden ( the only legit conflict?) A European missile shield? Georgia? Latvia or Lithuania?

And the Saudis releasing 1500 terrorists linked to Al Qaeda after having officially convinced them of the wrongfulness of their ideology. &quot;After several graded sessions with the committee, and having been convinced of their misguided vision, they renounced their erroneous ideologies, including the concept of driving out all infidels from the Arabian Peninsula,&quot; No comments. They made the world a safer place and the example should be followed by our administration that is so eager to empty and close Gitmo by the end of the year. Let the inmates swear to us that they saw the light, that drugs and Rock and Roll is the way along with promiscuity and let them go free. Would you? Would we apply that process to our entire prison system in order to save money?

And the US State Department that has just released five Iranians detained since 2007 for their active contribution to the training of anti-American militia and also the providing of the high tech and highly lethal road side bombs built around a shaped charge (EPS). They were suspected of being Quds force members under the protection of a Diplomatic job (elite secret unit of the National Revolutionary Guards). The State Department has denied that the release was a sign of weakness. What do you think? 

Stay tuned for more because more will happen and in the meantime, turn on your radio or watch your TV! Brainwash yourself to the tune of“Thriller”while our deficit grows to a multi-trillion figure, along with the unemployment and the economy, while we lose our international standing and any sort of credibility we had left.

   Obama…the wind cone on race or the foot in the mouth disease 

  On his Harvard buddy, the sooo famous Professor Gates: It seems like Henry Louis Gates, the Harvard Professor, was arrested in his Cambridge home for a few good reasons: barking at the officers, hiding behind his oversized egocentric race card and arrogantly refusing to comply with legitimate requests. Was he racially profiled or just booked for being stupid? President Obama, from his high chair and prestigious position became judge and jury by stating on record that the police were &quot;acting stupidly&quot; to arrest his friend. Should he be focusing on important things, like fixing our economy or bailing out Kevin Johnson? He was not there was he? But he knows that all the cops are black killers and every white is a racist. Every black with a NAACP card knows that! I was not there either but I can judge too! I can picture the arrogant old fool trying to turn his pampered stupidity (forced his own door) into a civil right-like struggle . Like most of us whites, he should have complied peacefully and THANKED THE Police for responding quickly. After all, they rushed to protect the property of a rich black man, property that was reported as being burglarized. Does the professor know that at the end of the day he has more chances to fall murdered by another black than from Police brutality? (FBI data: In 2007, 3221 blacks were murdered. 2905 of them by other African Americans). 

 Obama: Ivy league + affirmative action = cry baby: “&quot;I think it&apos;s fair to say, No. 1, any of us would be pretty angry. No. 2, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home. And No. 3—what I think we know separate and apart from this incident—is that there is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately, and that&apos;s just a fact.&quot; Maybe they should just stop breaking the laws!

 On the media for making him look stupid on his comment on the“stupid”action of the cops in Cambridge:   “it is the media&apos;s &quot;obsessions&quot; that are keeping alive his comments about the arrest”    All that while the White house tried to put new words and meanings in his mouth.        

 On calling the Cambridge cops stupid: President Obama said Friday that he has he used the wrong words calling the action stupid and should have &quot;calibrated those words differently.&quot;   He stated: &quot;I want to make clear that in my choice of words, I think I unfortunately gave an impression that I was maligning the Cambridge police department and Sgt. Crowley specifically. And I could&apos;ve calibrated those words differently.&quot; Eventually, he also called the white police officer to let him know all the good he thought of him….blah blah blah…

 The facts: He is prejudice against cop and he exposed racial issues when coming to the rescue of his high profile friend that the press keeps on referring to as“the renown professor” Gates junior. His buddy was arrested for disorderly conduct and the Prez had to pipe in and make it a racial issue, saying the cops acted stupidly adding to the long proven American history of racial discrimination. He had to back pedal, get his staff to apologize, blamed the media, eventually state that both parties were at fault before calling the white cop and apologize in other words, especially after the black officer that was part of the arrest went public and described who is racist and who was being profiled. No comments! Oooopsy…it did not go as well as for the biling out of Kevin Johnson, did it? Anyways…here is what this“renown”arrogant scholar is all about: victimization, bully tactics and race card…affirmative action and ivy league:

 Associated Press July 24
BOSTON - The second Cambridge police officer who was inside the home of renowned black scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. during his arrest says he and the arresting officer &quot;followed protocols.&quot;
Patrolman Carlos Figueroa says he and Sgt. James Crowley were investigating a report of a burglary at Gates&apos; home near Harvard University, and they needed to be sure everyone was in the house legally. He said that&apos;s why Crowley asked Gates for his identification. Figueroa said Gates shouted &quot;No, I will not!&quot; He also says Gates was shouting at Crowley, calling him a racist and saying, &quot;This is what happens to black men in America!&quot; 

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)—A black police officer who was at Henry Louis Gates Jr.&apos;s home when the black Harvard scholar was arrested says he fully supports how his white fellow officer handled the situation.Sgt. Leon Lashley says Gates was probably tired and surprised when Sgt. James Crowley demanded identification from him as officers investigated a report of a burglary. Lashley says Gates&apos; reaction to Crowley was &quot;a little bit stranger than it should have been.&quot;

Wright, Jackson, Sharpton, Gates, WEB Du Bois


 Du Bois…worth an institute in Harvard… 

 He described the Imperial Japanese victory over Russia as“colored pride”…hos simple is the world for pampered anti-white racist!

1936, invited by“imperial Japan”to visit Japan and Chinese territories occupied by the Imperial forces of Japan.. He stated that the Japanese/Chinese feud was caused by“China&apos;s &quot;submission to white aggression and Japan&apos;s resistance.&quot; He even told Chinese people to welcome Japanese soldiers as liberators…I guess he did not go to Nanking, right? He also supported the later invasion of Mandchuria.

About Stalin, he wrote:“Joseph Stalin was a great man; few other men of the 20th century approach his stature. He was simple, calm and courageous. He seldom lost his poise; pondered his problems slowly, made his decisions clearly and firmly; never yielded to ostentation nor coyly refrained from holding his rightful place with dignity. He was the son of a serf but stood calmly before the great without hesitation or nerves. But also - and this was the highest proof of his greatness - he knew the common man, felt his problems, followed his fate.”

About the 1956 Russian invasion of Hungary, he stated that the Hungarian revolution was led by Landlords and fascists.

In 1958 Du Bois was awarded an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Communist Prague His honorary dissertation was entitled The Negro and Communism 

In 1959 the USSR awarded him the International Lenin Peace Prize.

Stop it with the cry baby race game from yet another connected ivy league rich black guilt trip facilitator.

With more than 2 million burglaries in 2007, I am glad that somebody called the cops after witnessing two people–that have happened to be black- trying to force a door open. But reporting what seems to be a crime is plain“profiling”.

Of course, when the police showed up, the“professor”had to ride on his high racial horses, pull his well oiled race card out and most likely bark at the officers’face and call them racists instead of complying, showing proof of ID, explaining what had happened and thanking the officer for responding so fast and willing to put their lives on the line for the property of a black man.

But what can you say…ivy league rich and powerful black men rule the country now…and cops are“stupid”according to our new President.

And the funny thing is that the “ethnic study professor”have more chances to die killed by a black guy than a racist cop. I wonder if he knows it? 

FBI statistics from their website:

Do you know that African American are second as offenders in race crimes with 1448 documented crimes in 2007 against 4378 by white and Hispanics?

Do you know that the majority of persons arrested in the US are white with 69.7% in 2007.

Do you know that more African Americans died in the hand of other African Americans than from white racists. In 2007 3221 blacks were murdered. 245 by white murderers and 2905 by other African Americans. Also, 3587 white were killed, 2918 by white murderers. Blacks should fear blacks more than white and Hispanics.

 Brainwashed, one neuron at a time:


I wish the MEDIA would have given more coverage than 15 lines in the local paper to this Chico man&apos;s attempt to run over an abortion protester. Was it front page material and opinion feeder for the Eugene Robinson of the world? Maybe the article should have stated that the driver was brainwashed by the pro-abortion leftist propaganda that is stirring the crazies of the left and leading to violence: ELF members burning housing developments, animal activists violently intimidating scientists, anti globalization and anti war looting and rioting crowds, Gay activists defacing Mormon temples, anti Jews and Christians National Socialist and white supremacist like movements....When is the Governement going to protect us form the crazy people from the left? Of course I am being facetious! What about agreeing to the idea that there are crazy people all around, all faiths, party affiliations, races, ethnicities or sexual orientations willing to resort to violence to promote their agenda. Vilifying the right or talk shows might be fashionable for now but will not prevent any of you from eventually becoming the victim of a rabid leftist. Extremist news will lead to more extremist violence because leftist and right propaganda are both dangerous! Where does mainstream media stand?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Disinformation at work:


Mr. Robinson, a columnist from the East coast, wrote a nice long piece &quot;a la &quot; Homeland security depicting right wing nuts and yerrorists becoming restless because of the so called &quot;red hot &quot; right wing rethoric from right wing media. What about writing the same thing about lefty nut jobs, something like“Red-hot rhetoric from Liberals may be fueling radical acts”. Here is what you could also write! A good example of the leftist nut jobs is Abdulhakim Muhammad, 23, of Little Rock. Recently, he converted to Islam, went to Yemen, and brainwashed by years of media and leftist propaganda he went on a pre-planned shooting spree aiming at killing as many US soldiers as he could. He fed on the leftist rant that America is bad, war on terror offensive to Muslims, that our soldiers are baby-killers and rapists, and that the Afghanistan and Iraq wars are illegitimate despite both parties in Congress overwhelmingly supporting it again and again. One soldier was killed by the lone gunman. What about the crazies of the Animal Liberation Front and other sympathizers to their cause that go around threatening or bombing scientists working with animals? What about the idiots of the Earth Liberation Front that go around burning housing developments in suburbia to stop the sprawl? What about the violent and destructive anti war or anti globalization anarchist groups? What about the American citizens that are so disgusted by how“evil”America is that they spy for communist countries and disseminate our most sensitive secrets? Bipartisan blindness in both side of the political spectrum, poor education and lack of critical thinking is killing us as a nation. We get the schools, the media and governments we deserve. Rest in peace.

On this troubled time when our elected President deems necessary to perform another“apology tour”mostly aimed at the Muslim world, I thought it was adequate to publish again this essay I wrote a while back.

It is 98% original and still so frighteningly accurate..


 Muslims and peace.  

(nota: this paper quickly brushes an (incomplete) overview of the Muslim world complexity and only intends to trigger the need for more research in the reader’s part)


 Holy Qur-an 

Surate V 92“Never should a believer kill a believer (…)”

Surate V 93“If a man kills a believer intentionally, is recompense is Hell (…)”
 

We have read and heard many time that“Islam”is a religion of peace that has been“hijacked”by bloody terrorists seeking to bring fundamentalism in the Arab world.
These nihilists simplify the“Western world”as an American-led bunch of Christian countries made of crusaders united to annihilate the Muslim faith and fulfill the“Zionist”agenda. In return, we often have a tendency to wrongly simplify Islam as a single religion practiced by the Arab world as a whole. 
We do know that Christians are far from believing in the same things and practicing the same way, Christianity only being the common denominator, the name for a family of closely related beliefs. We are also aware that the Christian branches have sorted out their difference in blood and violence some four centuries ago and that Christians are actually pretty peaceful today. We also know better than to claim that the Western world is united when dealing with the Arab world.
On the other hand, and because of its huge Sunni majority (940 million out of 1 billion Muslims), Islam is often (and wrongly) considered as more united than Christianity and Judaism. But that religion also comes in many denominations, sects, and subdivisions, and more often than none, these groups have a hard time recognizing other groups as fellow Muslims, and it is not unusual to see them fighting each other.
To top it up, the Arab world is not only limited to the Middle East and ranges from former Russian republics to China, via Turkey, Africa, and Asia. Actually, the top ten Muslim countries of the world only include a couple of countries making what is commonly perceived as the Arab world (Turkey- 63,000.000- Iran–61,000.000- Egypt–54,000.000- Pakistan -136,000,000-).
The main Muslim population is mostly spread out in Asia (Indonesia -171,000,000- Bangladesh -106,000,000- India -103,000,000- China -38,000,000), with one big contender in Africa (Nigeria -47,720,000-). 

 The subdivisions of Islam:  

 ·        There are three major groups and many different smaller sects following their own versions of Islam 

Sunni Islam: They have chosen to follow Abu Bakr, as the successor of Muhammad. They form the majority in Algeria), Kuwait Afghanistan and outnumber Shiites in Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Somalia, Uzbekistan, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Libya and Jordan. Historically, Sunnis are pretty traditional believers and oppose Shiite, the US Nation of Islam, Ahmadiyya, and Ismailis.

Shi&apos;a Islam (Shiites): They have chosen to follow Ali, his closest relative, as the successor of Muhammad They form the majority in Iraq, Iran and Bahrain and total about 120,000.000. Shiites mainly oppose Sunnis and Ahmadyya.

Ahmadyya Islam: This clearly dissident branch of Islam was created by Mirza Ahmad in India in the nineteenth century, and includes about 170,000.000 followers (most of them in Pakistan). It preaches a peaceful“jihad”and had seceded in two different groups in the early 1900.

 ·        Two sects that have a lot of influence in the Muslim world challenge these numerous groups: 

The Wahhabis: Fundamentalists, they believe that everything that was added to the original religion after the third century is heresy. They only strive in Saudi Arabia that is well known for using its“petrodollars”to finance Coranic schools and spread Islam in third world countries plagued by misery, or in other parts of the world hit by religious based conflicts.

The Sufis: They follow another traditional form of mystic Islam clearly conflictual with mainstream Islam.

 ·        The other numerous sects split from the main currents of Islam throughout time and over disagreements on the choice of an Imam or the choice of what the right Islamic path should be. 

The, Zaidis (Imam issue), the Kahrijites (seeking another path), the Ismailis (ex Shiites), Fatimids (ex Ismailis, ruled Egypt for 200 years), the Alawis (ex Ismailis that strayed and are not considered as Islamic anymore), the Nizaris (formerly known as“Assassins”from the Arabic“ashshashsin”, a combination of words meaning“Hashish”and“to slaughter”. The original Crusaders fought that fierce sect known to be KUI (killing under the influence)), the Bahais (not regarded as Islamic anymore), and the Druzes (split from mainstream when believing that God can appear in a prophet or Imam. Druzes factions fought hard in Lebanon).

 The inter Arab and inter Muslim wars: 

The Arab world we know has been geographically drawn by the colonial powers of the twentieth century and has been plagued since with wars and rivalries. The presence of the state of Israel has been one of the leading causes of the Middle-Eastern wars and switches of allegiances. So were the two Iraqi invasions.

Politically, Arab regimes can be divided in two specific and competing sorts. On the one hand,“Pan Arab”government believe that they have been brought up by a“revolution”when on the other, oil producing countries believe that they are in power because of the richness of their soil. The latter is of course afraid to be forced to share its wealth with the former.

In the past decades, Arab countries have fought other Arab countries for many reasons including territorial disputes, expansion or wealth but not directly religion. Furthermore, many political tensions did not end up in wars but have also stressed the great divide between these Arab countries desperately seeking a European like union. The following confusing list of armed wars and political tensions of the past three decades best describes the complexity of their interactions.

During the Iran-Iraq conflict, Syria sided with Iran, and Egypt with Iraq. Algeria and Morocco are still at odds over the Western Sahara where the Algerian sponsored POLISARIO still fight Morocco’s ruling. Syria took over Lebanon, tried to invade Jordan (Israeli fighter jets saved Jordan form the Syrian armored onslaught), stood against Iraq and Egypt. Iraq and Saudi Arabia had tensions over borders and some war debts. Iraq and Turkey over the Kurds and water rights. Libya invaded Chad (oil). Libya and Syria are still trying to normalize their relationship with Egypt, banned for having supported Israel after the 1967 debacle. Jordan angered Egypt after siding with Iraq over the Arab council’s cooperation funds. Later, Iraq invaded Kuwait (oil), and Muslim countries sided with the UN force led by the US to liberate Kuwait (Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan, Turkey, United Emirates, Syria, Egypt, Bangladesh). Muslim countries also approved the second US led war in Iraq (Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kuwait, Uzbekistan). 

 Muslims and“invaders”: how fundamentalist“foreign fighters”take over liberation struggles
 
When Muslim countries are not too busy fighting each other, they stand up for their freedom against foreign invasions by“crusaders”of another faith. One cannot help noticing that in the past decades, these struggles have been mostly hijacked by a nucleus of international fundamentalists dedicated to getting rid of the“invader”, taking over the country, and imposing their radical views of Islam. The“foreign fighters”movement started in Kashmir, a hot spot between Pakistan and India where international Muslim fighters, supported by Pakistan, were fighting Indian troops (and still do it to a lesser extent), taking and executing hostages and blowing bombs. When Russia invaded Afghanistan, the trend greatly amplified and recruits from all over the Muslim world converged to fight the Russian in a holy Jihad. Instead of lining up at the unemployment line after the Russian defeat, these fighters spread out to more hot spots of the world, from Chechnya to Kosovo, Palestine, or Iraq for two consecutive wars.

The following listing illustrate the trend and shows that all the popular (and legitimate?) uprising against a foreign power of another faith had led to a take over of the struggle by radical Islam with a radical agenda.

Radical foreign fighters are fighting India over the independence of Kashmir. The Palestinian struggle against Israel has been hijacked by radical factions resorting to terrorism and backed up by powers such as Iran. For years, in and from Lebanon, radical Muslim terrorist groups have waged a war against Israel and against other Lebanese factions. In Chechnya, foreign fighters infiltrated the Chechen resistance and are now leading the struggle against Russian troops. The same was also tried in Kosovo. In Afghanistan, and twice in Iraq, foreign fighters joined the regular army to fight the US led invasions. In post Gulf War 2 Iraq, radical international fighters are using terror against occupation forces and other Muslim to fulfill their agenda.

 Islam and“wars of religion”: 

When fundamentalism takes over, Islam has a hard time cohabitating with another of its branches or another religion. Religious peace and tolerance that had been the norm for decades had been recently broken all over the world, everywhere where new self proclaimed righteous fighters try to impose by force their retrograde view.

In Africa, Muslim warriors, following a long tradition of hunting for slaves in“black Africa”took over or are actively seeking dominance in civil war torn or peaceful countries. Furthermore, a more global and insidious agenda is fulfilled by the Kingdom of Saud that spreads out Coranic schools in poor and remote provinces where young children are enrolled by force by their parents who want to grant them free food and“education”. Commonly,“studies”last about four years, in chains, the time it takes to learn the Holy Qur-an by heart.

Sudan had only been peaceful eleven years since its accession to independence in 1955. The perpetual civil war started as a religious war between the Muslim populated North and the Christian South. In the Darfur province of Sudan, and now in Eastern Chad, the Janjaweed Muslim militias backed up by the Islamic government of Khartoum, keep on carrying out well documented genocide-like military strikes on the Christian black African population, resorting to looting raping, mass killing to chase them away. Sudan is also known to harbor known terrorist groups.

In Ivory Coast, that used to be the“jewel of Africa”and the example of a post-colonial success, the fabric of the population had been eroded by the influx of refugees from neighboring countries, refugees seeking a piece of the success. The more than 60 ethnic groups that make the country lived in harmony until they became the“minority”in their own land, and recession hit. Interestingly enough, the North of the country that is currently held by three foreign backed dissident groups is also made of a majority of Muslim.

In Nigeria, since the 1993 dictatorship of General Abacha, dictatorship that led to corruption, drugs trafficking and ethnic and religious tensions and clashes in the 36 states that form the country, the Muslim of the North have been diligently oppressing their Christian-animist minorities. In 1999, defying the constitution, eleven Northern Muslim states have implemented strict Islamic laws, forced to Islam or persecuted other religious groups, burned and destroy other temples or churches, already accounting for tens of thousands of death and more in displaced populations.

In Somalia, another heaven for terrorist groups, the civil war still rages but if initially it was mostly an ethnic based ancient conflict pitting together nomads against sedentary people, Northern tribes against Southern groups, rural communities against urban populations, the new trend is religious and Muslim armed groups are fighting to get rid of the moderate Mulsim that promote some separation between religion and state.

In Algeria, after having cancelled elections obviously won by the Salvation Islamic Front that had capitalized in the discontent created by the recession of the 1990, the military dictatorship have basically abandoned whole remote regions of Algeria to the Salvation Islamic Army. Furthermore, another group of fundamentalist, the Armed Islamic Group , tried to force Islam on rural Algerians that were slaughtered or raped after their villages were looted. In urban area, and neighboring countries, intellectuals, journalists and officials were also executed by the Armed Islamic Group that found its fame in the many nail bombings that it conducted in Paris between 1993 and 1996. This civil war that still rages today in the name of the war on terror has already cost thousands of lives. 

Israel is still the standing symbol of a religious war between radical Islam and Zionism.

Turkey is still struggling between a modern and moderate Islam. As recently as 2002, the country has officially protected other religions and minorities and even allows Christian and Jew organizations to own real estate, that is to say churches and synagogues. Still, fundamental Islam lurks in the background and tries to take over.

As far Iraq is concerned, no comment: Muslims are still killing more Muslims than the coalition force and there is no way anybody would be crazy enough to try to build a church or a Synagogue in today’s Iraq.

In India, foreign Muslim fighters, and also terrorists, are waging a secession war in Kashmir. When in 1947, the Muslim state of Pakistan was created; millions of Hindu Indians moved South while Muslim went north to the new country. That was the direct cause for about 500.000 deaths. At the same time, about to be overtaken by Pakistan, the Indian ruler of Kashmir decided to join the South despite its Muslim majority. Since than, Muslim fighters and/or the Pakistanis army have tried many time to“liberate”the province from“infidel”hands.

In Afghanistan, after the departure of their common Russian enemy, the“freedom fighters”split in many warring factions and started a civil war that led to the Victory of the Pakistan backed Talibans, opposed by a coalition of moderate Muslims, the Northern coalition led by Commander Massoud. After 9-11, and despite the murdering of Massoud commandeered by the Talibans and Al Qaeda, the US backed the North and successfully routed the Talibans. Moderate Islam is still struggling today in Afghanistan, especially since the return of the Talibans. Pakistan does not really appreciate the“birth”of a sovereign and moderate power at its borders, and would rather have it out of sight of the international community in the hands of aTaliban-like regime.

In China, the Muslim western province of Xinjiang, North of Tibet, is one of the two only Chinese province where the majority is not held by the Han ethnic group but by Kazakhs, Uzbecks or Mongols, united with a common language and religion. Islam is predominant there and since 1990, Xinjiang Islamists have resorted to violence to voice their aspirations. Like in Tibet, China used the excuse of the post 9-11 global war on terror to increase its repression.

The Philippines suffers from a communist, a military and a Muslim rebellion. The latter resorts to terrorism and is today the most serious threat to the fragile democracy, with the group Abu Sayaf bragging to its linkage with Bin Laden. Hostage taking is a common tool used by the group that ridiculed the army in 2001 when it captured 200 hostages in a hospital. Since than, the US has been really active along local military forces to hunt down the terrorists.

Indonesia is the biggest Muslim country of the world that had been artificially united by its military ruler for the past 30 years. It is composed of 13,000 Islands occupied by three religious groups, Muslims, Hindus and Christians. Since 1998, the religious war between Muslims and Christians in the Moluccas island of the north East of the archipelago had cost more than 5000 dead and half a million of displaced people. 

In Timor, a hilly island whose Dutch part was attached to Indonesia in 1949 (West Timor) while its Portuguese part (Timor East) proclaimed independence in 1975, the population was 90% Catholic. The independent part was invaded by Indonesia in 1975. Islam has been imposed since 1949 on the West part and as of 1975 on the Eastern side. The“Islamization”was conducted by“inserting”250,000 Indonesian in the Island and by setting concentration camps were about 300,000 Catholics were still reported to be held in 1999. Thanks to international and UN pressure, Timor East chooses independence again later on. Since than, Muslim militias, backed by the Indonesian army, have already claimed thousands of deaths and the forced internment in West Timor of 250,000 displaced people.UN forces are still present there to monitor the situation and put an end the civil war.

In former Yugoslavia, Muslim ethnic minorities were the victim of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and UN forces were unable to stop it. As of today, the ethnic and religious cohabitation of what used to be the people of Yugoslavia under Marshal Tito is only guaranteed by a strong and permanent international military presence.

 Conclusion:
 
Islam, Muslims, the Arab world, moderation, terrorism and fundamentalism…

This paper did not try to bash on the Muslim faith but to describe what has been happening lately across the world, where Islam, has been involved. The author did not even tried to approach the various Islamic laws as applied differently in different countries, laws that would let a Westerner shocked and speechless.
Modern Muslims are struggling today with the return of the more fundamental approach of their religion that has been spreading since the 1979 Iranian revolution. Furthermore, the major Muslim sects and groups have also been fighting each other for the total dominance of the Islamic faith. It is up to the vast majority (?) of moderate Muslims to stand up and protect their“religion of peace that has been high jacked by the terrorists!”

In the meantime, it is a small world and if all Muslims are not terrorists, most terrorists are Muslim. If most Muslims are peace lovers, most Muslim countries are third world dictatorship in or out of a war, supporting or planning some kind of conflict or armed operation somewhere. And finally, if most Muslims would give their left arm to move to a Western country, America included, mostly Muslims would love to destroy these Western democracies to impose their backward laws.
Whether you like it or not, whether you think I am rude or insensitive, these are facts I could debate with you ad nauseam, and happily too. Welcome in the world and Mr Obama is not going to change it.

    Comparisons between what did not work under President Bush and works great under President Obama:

 

·        Drinking in college by Bush is bad but drug use by Obama is cool…the“audacity of dope!”

·        For 20 years and under Bush, attending Rev Wright’s church was OK but once Senator running for the White House, Rev Wright became &quot;The person I saw yesterday is not the person I met 20 years ago.&quot;

·        During previous administration, Rezko was a friend. During the campaign, &quot; your contributor, Rezko, in his slum landlord business in inner-city Chicago .&quot; (Dixit Sen Clinton). Once Senator running for the White House, Obama said “ This isn&apos;t the Tony Rezko I knew .&quot; 

·        Tax breaks: they were for the rich under Bush and are OK now that the Obama administration continues them.

·        A military surge in Iraq was bad under Bush and the lying General“Betrayus”misrepresented it but it is good under Obama in Afghanistan.

·        War on Islam bad under Bush…Muslim countries that are friendly to the US, where US citizens can roam freely and exercise their freedom of speech, religion, sexual preferences, etc…: Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Yemen, Egypt, and West Africa, Lebanon…. But President Obama stated that“the U.S. &quot;is not and never will be at war with Islam”

·        The Domestic Surveillance law was an attack on our constitutional rights and privacy under Bush but it is OK now for Eric Holder to push Congress for its continuation.

·        China’s poor records on Human rights issue were encouraged when Bush attended the Olympic games (dixit Sen Clinton or Pelosi) but“won’t hinder”our economic and political relationship with the Obama administration (dixit State Secretary Clinton or Speaker of the House Pelosi)

·        Carrying guns in public parks was a bad idea of the Bush administration but has been signed into law by President Obama.

·        Torture is an ugly legacy used and encouraged by the Bush administration but US lawmakers“a la Pelosi”who have known about it since 2002 did encourage it by their silence and complicity. They did not know, were lied to, forgot, did not do anything because it was pointless….whatever…. and President Obama said that he was“Seeking to move beyond what he calls a &quot;a dark and painful chapter in our history,&quot; a time when executive and legislative worked together to achieve results and win a couple of wars.

·        Investigating the Bush administration to restore America’s honor is good but creating a bipartisan committee to investigate the many claims from the speaker of the House, Pelosi, that the CIA has lied to and misled members of Congress is just a disturbance to more critical topics…especially when everybody knows that she has been lying on the matter…and if she has not, can one run by me why it is unimportant to prove that the CIA is actually lying and misleading Congress…a pattern that led us to Iraq…an excuse for Bush? A screen smoke from a lying and self serving politician? Come on, on these time of exposing Bush-Cheney evil side, Democrats would have jumped on the occasion and supported the investigation…unless they know Pelosi is lying!

·        Harsh interrogation methods were“legalized”by a bunch of“bad lawyers”of the Bush administration and that was not good, but using lawyers to legitimize the incarceration without trial of hard core Guantanamo inmates on US soil is OK as long as it comes from the Obama administration…

·        Pork Barrel under Bush was bad but under Obama it is a good thing

·        Lobbyist was the plague under Bush but under Obama it is OK…Interests groups involved in that new Green cash cow have increased their lobbying workforce by 300% compared to five years ago…

·        And Hiroshima and Nagasaki used to be good and credited for saving hundreds of Thousands of American AND Japanese lives but according to Obama, guilty America should be leading the world to a total nuclear disarmament because–how dared she- America actually used the evil power first.

·        And special funding to finance the war was bad under Bush but seems like a good idea under Obama, even when he used to oppose them when Senator.

·        And Blackwater and the privatization of war by corporate America was so bad under Bush but ignored today when Blackwater is still protecting State Department officials under a Federal contract.

·        And the special military tribunal that were not good at all during Bush and have been restarted by the Obama administration.

·        And the“rendition”process that allows America to transfer prisoners to foreign countries, was bad under Bush but upheld by the new administration.

·        And the nomination of buddies and contributors as Ambassadors….come on, even the owner of the Steelers got one of these cozy payback post!

·        And the announcement of the 150.000 jobs he saved the day when unemployment fell to another record low…oooops…he saved jobs based on what he said we would have lost without him! That’s good non partisan math!

·        And finally, $500 billion Federal Budget deficit and two wars were bad under two terms of Bush but $1.5 Trillion deficit–and growing- in 100 days under Obama is cool.

From Reuters: China hlaughs at our Treasury Secretary&apos;s attempt to convince them that their investment in American assets are safe!


Turbo Tax Geithner deserves his nickname...lol


http://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSPEK14475620090601

Reuters:

 

By Glenn Somerville

BEIJING, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Monday reassured the Chinese government that its huge holdings of dollar assets are safe and reaffirmed his faith in a strong U.S. currency.

A major goal of Geithner&apos;s maiden visit to China as Treasury chief is to allay concerns that Washington&apos;s bulging budget deficit and ultra-loose monetary policy will fan inflation, undermining both the dollar and U.S. bonds.

China is the biggest foreign owner of U.S. Treasury bonds. U.S. data shows that it held $768 billion in Treasuries as of March, but some analysts believe China&apos;s total U.S. dollar-denominated investments could be twice as high.

&quot;Chinese assets are very safe,&quot; Geithner said in response to a question after a speech at Peking University, where he studied Chinese as a student in the 1980s.

His answer drew loud laughter from his student audience, reflecting scepticism in China about the wisdom of a developing country accumulating a vast stockpile of foreign reserves instead of spending the money to raise living standards at home.

But later in the day, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan said it was important for the two nations to show the world they are working together through their joint economic dialogue.

&quot;We must through our dialogue send a clear signal that China and the U.S. are engaged in practical cooperation to address the crisis,&quot; Wang told Geithner, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry&apos;s website (www.mfa.gov.cn).

&quot;This is important for boosting confidence and encouraging global financial stability and economic revival,&quot; said Wang.

In his speech, Geithner renewed pledges that the Obama administration would cut its huge fiscal deficits and promised &quot;very disciplined&quot; future spending, possibly including reintroduction of pay-as-you-go budget rules instead of nonstop borrowing.

&quot;We have the deepest and most liquid markets for risk-free assets in the world. We&apos;re committed to bring our fiscal deficits down over time to a sustainable level.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  From the Russian newspaper PRAVDA..and believe me! It was -and still is- the official mouthpiece of the Communist party for haldf a century, so they must know better!



 American capitalism gone with a whimper 
  
27.04.2009 Source: Pravda.Ru URL: http://english.pravda.ru/opinion/columnists/107459-american_capitalism-0 

 
It must be said, that like the breaking of a great dam, the American decent into Marxism is happening with breath taking speed, against the back drop of a passive, hapless sheeple, excuse me dear reader, I meant people.

True, the situation has been well prepared on and off for the past century, especially the past twenty years. The initial testing grounds were conducted upon our Holy Russia and a bloody test it was. But we Russians would not just roll over and give up our freedoms and our souls, no matter how much money Wall Street poured into the fists of the Marxists.

Those lessons were taken and used to properly prepare the American populace for the surrender of their freedoms and souls, to the whims of their elites and betters.

First, the population was dumbed down through a politicized and substandard education system based on pop culture, rather then the classics. Americans know more about their favorite TV dramas then the drama in DC that directly affects their lives. They care more for their &quot;right&quot; to choke down a McDonald’s burger or a Burger King burger than for their constitutional rights. Then they turn around and lecture us about our rights and about our &quot;democracy&quot;. Pride blind the foolish.

Then their faith in God was destroyed, until their churches, all tens of thousands of different &quot;branches and denominations&quot; were for the most part little more then Sunday circuses and their televangelists and top protestant mega preachers were more then happy to sell out their souls and flocks to be on the &quot;winning&quot; side of one pseudo Marxist politician or another. Their flocks may complain, but when explained that they would be on the &quot;winning&quot; side, their flocks were ever so quick to reject Christ in hopes for earthly power. Even our Holy Orthodox churches are scandalously liberalized in America.

The final collapse has come with the election of Barack Obama. His speed in the past three months has been truly impressive. His spending and money printing has been a record setting, not just in America&apos;s short history but in the world. If this keeps up for more then another year, and there is no sign that it will not, America at best will resemble the Wiemar Republic and at worst Zimbabwe.

These past two weeks have been the most breath taking of all. First came the announcement of a planned redesign of the American Byzantine tax system, by the very thieves who used it to bankroll their thefts, loses and swindles of hundreds of billions of dollars. These make our Russian oligarchs look little more then ordinary street thugs, in comparison. Yes, the Americans have beat our own thieves in the shear volumes. Should we congratulate them?

These men, of course, are not an elected panel but made up of appointees picked from the very financial oligarchs and their henchmen who are now gorging themselves on trillions of American dollars, in one bailout after another. They are also usurping the rights, duties and powers of the American congress (parliament). Again, congress has put up little more then a whimper to their masters.

Then came Barack Obama&apos;s command that GM&apos;s (General Motor) president step down from leadership of his company. That is correct, dear reader, in the land of &quot;pure&quot; free markets, the American president now has the power, the self given power, to fire CEOs and we can assume other employees of private companies, at will. Come hither, go dither, the centurion commands his minions.

So it should be no surprise that the American president has followed this up with a &quot;bold&quot; move of declaring that he and another group of unelected, chosen stooges will now redesign the entire automotive industry and will even be the guarantee of automobile policies. I am sure that if given the chance, they would happily try and redesign it for the whole of the world, too. Prime Minister Putin, less then two months ago, warned Obama and UK&apos;s Blair, not to follow the path to Marxism, it only leads to disaster. Apparently, even though we suffered 70 years of this Western sponsored horror show, we know nothing, as foolish, drunken Russians, so let our &quot;wise&quot; Anglo-Saxon fools find out the folly of their own pride.

Again, the American public has taken this with barely a whimper...but a &quot;freeman&quot; whimper.

So, should it be any surprise to discover that the Democratically controlled Congress of America is working on passing a new regulation that would give the American Treasury department the power to set &quot;fair&quot; maximum salaries, evaluate performance and control how private companies give out pay raises and bonuses? Senator Barney Franks, a social pervert basking in his homosexuality (of course, amongst the modern, enlightened American societal norm, as well as that of the general West, homosexuality is not only not a looked down upon life choice, but is often praised as a virtue) and his Marxist enlightenment, has led this effort. He stresses that this only affects companies that receive government monies, but it is retroactive and taken to a logical extreme, this would include any company or industry that has ever received a tax break or incentive.

The Russian owners of American companies and industries should look thoughtfully at this and the option of closing their facilities down and fleeing the land of the Red as fast as possible. In other words, divest while there is still value left.

The proud American will go down into his slavery with out a fight, beating his chest and proclaiming to the world, how free he really is. The world will only snicker.

California has just recovered again for the day-after hang over caused by Cinco Di Mayo, the celebration of the onetime victory of a foreign military over another foreign military in a foreign country (on year later the French took Mexico and sat their puppet on the throne). When I look back at the American history, for events worth remembering and celebrating one way or another, May 5th (Cinco di Mayo) does not even make the list. Just consider, to name a few, May 7th (1915) and the tragedy of the Lusitania that caused America to enter WW1, or May 8th, V Day Europe, the end of WW2! About 115000 US servicemen and women died in the first world war, and 300000 during the second. But we just forgot that our present has been defined by our past and the people have chosen margaritas over the sacrifice of their grandparents and parents. Let just open the borders and get done with this nonsense, because our definition of what America is and should be does not measure up to what our ancestors believed. For the kick of it, I polled a couple of GED level teenagers about &quot;Lusitania&quot; and why America should remember May 8, 1945. Most of the tentative answers located &quot;Lusitania&apos; somewhere in Eastern Europe and offered the landing in Normandy on May 8th. No wonder that there is not such a thing as an American Department of culture!

Nota: Flu deaths are nothing new in the United States or elsewhere. The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 36,000 people died of flu-related causes each year, on average, during the 1990s in the United States.
 

Believing the media is a little like dealing with Jehovah witnesses. They have sold us the end of the world so many times in the past centuries that we don’t believe them anymore, even if we know that one day they might finally get the causes and dates right. The Bee, reporting on the so called“swine-avian-human flu”, filled up pages of fear-mongering material while also saying that only 20 of the 149 announced Mexican casualties of the virus were confirmed flu victims. Flop! Like for the West Nile virus and the Asian avian flu, cash strapped“tabloidic”media are playing on our fears. At the same time, Federal , State, Local governments and politicians are afraid of a Katrina-like disaster and backlash for inaction (Louisiana’s governor was kicked out and New Orleans mayor and police force became a national joke). They play safe and add to the hysteria with highly publicized emergency plans and other tips and tricks. Unfortunately, the new flu, like its Asian counterpart a while back, will kill a couple of hundreds of locals in the third world countries that are affected because of a virus spreading traditional home farming of pigs and chickens, poor sanitary conditions and a poor healthcare system. In the US, maybe a dozen will end up dead for having been at the wrong place at the wrong time. Should we be aware? Sure. Should we worry? I have more chances to die in my car on my way home than to get the flu. Just get your priorities right and be cool.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Obama denouncing Bush on contracting programs and“fiscal irresponsibility”:“There is a fundamental public trust that we–the government- must uphold. The American’s people’s money must be spent to advance their priorities and not to line the pockets of contractors or to maintain projects that don’t work”

Way to go, mister, how do you spell crooks in your administration, lobbyists, pork barrel, pet project, your agenda vs our lives, etc, etc…Trillions already spent and none for my priorities or fix a broken system, just to line the pockets of your electorate, buddies, and congressional representation!

Let see…the latest controversial pork barreled $410 billion budget,“last year business”, 8000 earmarks, 6% increase of funds for the government (crisis does not apply in DC)…and not a single veto yet to come from opur fearless leader that ran a campaign claiming he would read budget proposals line by line and get rid of the pork:

 
$21 million for research on a“quick peal grape”

$1.7 million for honey bees

$1.7 million for pig odor study

$1 million for crickets control

$800,ooo catfish genetic studies

$650,000 for beaver management

$900,000 to sustain Las Vegas

$2 million to promote astronomy in Hawaii

$200,000 for tattoo removal anti gang program

$300,000 for voyaging society of Hawaii

$200,000 for blackberry studies

Etc,etc..
 
More interesting are these facts:

$38,4 million co sponsored by Hilda Solis, Labor secretary

$109 million sponsored by Hillary Clinton, State secretary

$31.2 million sponsored by Transportation secretary Ray Lahood

$8.5 million in 16 earmarks by Rahm Emmanuel, White House chief of staff

Etc, etc…and the best for the end:

$7,7 million co sponsored by….Senator Obama while campaigning for the Presidential seat on the nop pork barrel and no earmarks and no biz as usual in DC platform!

 
Here are the changes we have been waiting for! Lol

Buyer’s remorse yet?

WASHINGTON–The Obama administration on Wednesday abandoned a controversial plan to make veterans use private health insurance to pay for costly treatments of combat-related injuries.

Stung by the angry reaction to the proposal, the administration made the decision after a meeting between officials from 11 veterans advocacy groups and top White House officials.

&quot;Our voices were heard,&quot; said Norbert Ryan, the president of the Military Officers Association of America. &quot;They made the right decision on this.&quot;

The plan would have reversed a long-standing policy of providing government health coverage for all service-related injuries. Few details emerged beyond its reported savings of $540 million, however.

Red Cross report states US used torture.


Water boarding, sleep deprivation and various other humiliations are standard practices for Evasion and Escape training for Special Forces (E&amp;E). So is it torture when they are applied on our soldiers as part of a training? Should we just keep on doing it to the bad guy and deliver them E&amp;E certificate of training completion and get done with it? You should read the Geneva Convention and when you read it (you will be one of the few), spend time on chapter 4 that describes what a combatant is and what rules one must follow in order to become a protected prisoner of war (POW). Where do you fit our enemies in the following statement:“Members of other militias (…) must fulfil the following conditions (-to be considered POW-):[ (a) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; (b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance; (c) that of carrying arms openly; (d) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war”. Don’t take my word for it, go and check it out, educate yourself because knowledge is power! ( http://www.genevaconventions.org/ ).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Don’t take my word for it!  

I know that you are still hanging out by your nails to the Audacity of your unlimited hopes and to the pledges and over-promises of the“one we have been waiting for”and that you have eventually put in the White House.

Just read the Tehran Times of February 21 2009! Reporting on a US TV interview by Stephanopoulos (ABC). The Iranian news media stresses President Obama’s commitment to“break away from President George W Bush’s policy on Iran and seek a much broader approach with the Islamic state”and quote him stating that““We are going to have to take a new approach. And I’ve outlined my belief that engagement is the place to start,”. Also, the reader is reminded that the US President ran a campaign saying that“there should be no pre-conditions in discussions with the Iranian leadership”. Add to that an interview with Al Arabya where he basically apologized to Muslim dictatorships and other third world tyrants for the past American intolerant behavior toward Islam and the tone of the new administration has been set: America is going to revive the happier American-Muslim times of 20 to 30 years ago, he said (“We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago”). The problem is that such a statement is wrong and shows a total ignorance of the historic realities of that time, and that 20 to 30 years ago, Middle Eastern terrorists were plaguing our skies or killing our soldiers and citizens all over the world while the cold armed war raged on through Arab proxies. Sure, all of this has happened on“day one”, a couple of days after our country had yet another peaceful democratic change of power that saw the first“black”president elected. But we are the bad guys right? Sure! Try to be a driving woman in Saudi Arabia or a school girl in Afghanistan. Try homosexuality or adultery in any of these Muslim tolerant banana republics. Have Sean Penn film a Harvey Milk movie in Saudi Arabia or organize a Gay pride in Tehran! Or just try to set free election, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom to dissent anywhere in the world where Minarets are standing tall and proud, beside Western countries and maybe Tunisia of course. I rest my case.

On day one, America lost its credibility and on day two, Iran had its first official nuclear power plant thanks to the overt Russian help. And why not? Because of our support to Georgia, Russia has kicked us out of Russian airspace and out of our rear bases in the former Soviet Central Asian states of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Suddenly we have lost our critical resupply route to Afghanistan (Nato imports about 70 per cent of its food, fuel, water and equipment from Pakistan via the Khyber Pass, and flies in much of the rest through Russian airspace via bases in Central Asia. -Timesonline UK-). NATO had to choose between a rock and a hard spot, between Pakistan, Russia, or an expensive and nightmarish non sustainable airlift solution! But thanks to President Medvedev-Putin’s“generosity”, and Pakistan’s instability, new Russian routes have been opened and we are back in business….right! Medvedev-Putin have also tested us, and strong armed us into relying on their good will to maintain our forces in Afghanistan, just when Obama plans on reinforcing our combat troops there and on winning that thing. As the Russian ambassador to Afghanistan said: if the Americans stay and win that thing it would be OK but if they lose or run away, we would not be the first one to cry over it! But was it innocent or was it the direct result of Obama’s capitulation personal letter hand delivered to the Russian presidential twins?

On day one, President Obama wrote a letter to the Russian president team (Medvedev-Putin) asking them to support the US regarding the Iranian nuclear research in exchange for the dropping of the US missile defense plan for Europe. The defeated and begging attitude had the predictable effect one gets when trying to appeal to the goodness of a bully. It showed weakness and lack of spine. America had lost its big stick! Within weeks, Russian scientist were openly supporting the Iranian nuclear team and the US were kicked out of their Soviet Central Asian bases. Now you understand why the European military’s effort for the ten next ten years is the development of a European missile shield, early warning satellite detection system, spy satellite system, GPS“constellation”, airborne warning radar systems and other drones that used to be American made and operated for the protection of its allies.

On day one America lost its credibility and on day two even South Korea resumed rattling its saber again while getting closer to having its nuclear weapons thanks to the same tactics used by Iran: delay, negotiate, break up, misinform, blackmail, negotiate, delay, test, breakup, etc, etc…Within Obama’s only term, two anti-American terrorist and unstable dictatorship will become nuclear powers! Also, we are not committed to Somalia, nor are we regarding the genocide in Darfur, nor have we stopped supporting the Ethiopian genocide against its rebelled minorities. We bomb Pakistan, thus accelerating the decaying of its elected government and let the Pelosis state that these bombing are conducted from our bases within Pakistan with the government approval. Way to go! We are going to close GITMO but nobody want the remaining inmates in their backyards, not even our anti-GITMO liberals and they will most likely fall back in Al Qaeda’s arms like so many others we have released (France is actually the only country that takes to court its nationals that are released from US hands!).

And finally, the“coup de grace”, the strawberry on the sherbet, is Mrs Billary Clinton first foreign trip, to Asia! The first trip ever of our new famous -and qualified by marriage- State Secretary representing the new administration to China, a strong economic partner (have you bought anything made in the USA lately?). It was marked, branded with a red iron in the history books, with the strongest signal ever that the US, weakened by its own economic crisis and addiction to credit, will put the issues of human rights to the back burners and will not let them“hinder”cooperation with China. She even stated that &quot; our pressing on those issues can&apos;t interfere on the global economic crisis, the global climate change crisis and the security crisis,&quot; Amen. Basically, a new era of unrestricted trade is born and America will not put on the negotiation table the lives of the victims of the Chinese regime. Sure, the next day the US State department released a written report criticizing the Chinese abuses but again, this is not going to“hinder”a good deal, is it? Mrs Clinton did really good and the world is a safest place, especially China.

The echoes of the campaign still ring in my head, the audacity of hope, the changes and the one we have been waiting for, the pledge to cut the deficit by increasing it three fold today to return to its current level in ten years, the pledge to study budgets a line at a time and to cut the Pork out of it, blah, blah.

It took what, ten days, for the new world stage to be set, for America’s new administration to throw its spine down the sewer. Russia, China, Iran and North Korea already got it and there is nothing we can do about it. The paper tiger is begging, meowing for love and understanding, compassion and help. Who has friends with such enemies? We chose the music and now we will have to dance to it, at least for the next four years. I wanted my country to be feared and I wanted my military to be respected. There is a saying stating that a country’s diplomacy is only as strong and successful as its military! Think about the diplomatic disaster of these first week and get back to me! Look above your self-inflicted credit card depts. or overpriced mortgage and imagine a world where Russia and China boss us around and where Iran and North Korea have become nuclear powers and possible nuclear technology“proliferators”. Think of all these people who hate your liberal guts and what you stand for, and after that, get back to me! In the meantime, enjoy the changes! The new Neville Chamberlain administration has promised us“Peace for our Times”.

Beware, men at work. 

The latest issue of the newsletter of the city of Folsom had plenty to say about the Folsom Dam!   

First in the news, of course, is the Grand opening of the Folsom Lake Crossing bridge that has been set for March 28th 2009. Sure, again, it does not cross the lake like its name might falsely indicate but it is build close enough to the structure that any out-of-towners will guess where the name comes from, especially if we paint“Folsom Dam”in huge letters on the concrete wall of the dam.. Anyways, this is big news because our dam is finally safe from terrorist attacks (?) while our traffic has conveniently been rerouted away from Sutter street, taking the shopping strip back to its pre bridge closure tranquility…I mean death-like tranquility.  

The second piece of news regards something that has started to transpire throughout California and it concerns the driest spell ever to hit our Golden State. The drought is coming and the early signs are alarming with only 61% of the regular snow pack showing and a dried out reservoir good enough for Napa style rejuvenating mud baths. Alert, alert! Stage 2 water alert! All citizen are required to level their front lawns to avoid runs off onto sidewalks. Also, you are mandated to figure out what days you are supposed to run your fully automated and leak free systems. Finally automatic or manual watering is only allowed between 10 pm and 10 am. So, let me see if I got it right: , on the days I take the Grey and the Blue trash bin out, if my house number and my front lawn are even, restaurants are prohibited to serve water and my sprinklers can go manually while I dry clean my car, naked and under the stars around midnight. Or else I will be yelled at, fined or prosecuted so bad that I’d wish I had cheated on my taxes instead.

Interestingly, the missing piece is about the ongoing progress underway to increase the safety and flood-control capability of the Folsom Dam (DS/FDR). The project has been going on since late 2007 and includes a new spillway to bypass the dam consisting of–I quote-“an approach channel from Folsom Lake, a control structure with six submerged gates, a 2,700-foot concrete-lined chute, and a stilling basin.”The work also includes safety related work to mitigate flood, earthquake and seepage risks. Finally, the main dam, both wing dams, and its many levees are also being improved. That is also good and newsworthy, isn’t it? Until I met Big X.

Big X is a conspiracy theorist that walks around with an aluminum hat. He kept on telling me to check the inside work, the roads within the lake, the men with the hard hats, the excavation and transportation of gold laden mud, to seek out there the reason for the disappearing waters! And I eventually did. The levee are being stretched and heightened using borrows from the floors of the lake. Contractors have built temporary roads inside the lake to transport the dugout loot from various collection points to where it is needed. Also, depending on sources, the entire project is forecasted to last about fifteen years because the lake is contained by 12 dams and dykes/levees that need improvements. The whole project was started at the fall of 2007 and is in its second winter in the making. My question to you is as follow: could one make the crazy allegation that for the benefit of the improvements and construction work being done, the dam’s level has been artificially kept particularly low through water releases. Sure enough we are going through the dry years of a traditional ten year cycle (2005 being the wettest year), but the lake has never been that low, it was closed to navigation June first last year and I don’t believe in coincidences.

Today, the low level of the lake often makes the news but nothing is ever said about the need for the safety work to continue, or about the guys with the orange hats. The lake might have actually been drained because of the newly built inside roads that are being used for the repair of the earth dam to be raised and stretched with mud dug out from lower levels. There is no way the Feds, the Bureau of Reclamations, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of water resources and the Sacramento Area Flood control Agency are going to let the reservoir fill to capacity and jeopardize what they see as the 10-15 year $2 billion project that will provide the 200 years flood protection Sacramento needs. When asked, a very nice spokesperson for the project told me that they don’t control the water releases, but would the Dam operators willingly endanger the workers’safety by letting the natural flow of the American river fill the reservoir? The work that has been envisioned involves the inside“excavation, transportation and placement of 3.5 million cubic yards of material”, the“hauling in and installation”of drill rigs and other“large scale”equipment, the provision for inside batch plants for the enormous quantities of concrete needed, the creation of inside staging and stockpiling area and the use of black helicopters at night to check on the sprinklers. Will the concerned agencies allow any of this to go under water? No way! That is why many believe that the lake will remain low until the construction is completed. In the meantime, what it might mean for us are more water restrictions, the end of the recreational boating activities, Big Brother checking my lawn and the guilt trip for the man-made global warming that has failed to unleash the winter rains and snows the lake needed.

Maybe indeed our regional dry spell is man-made and maybe the lake is being kept low for other reasons aggravating our normal dry years and lack of rain falls. According to Big X, UFOs were siphoning out our water at night and one has crashed inside the lake and got buried in the mud, thus explaining the closure of the roads and accesses and the work being done by the Feds. But who am I to say. I just live here, right?

It is already hard in good time for former inmates to find a job in sunny California, just think about their chances now! I think releasing around 50,000 of them in the middle of a recession is not going to help improve the crime rate. I am ready to bet that at the end of the day, if this plan takes place, many freed inmates will resort to crime for lack of other opportunities or because it is simply what they like and do. Such a release would at least have a positive impact in one economic sector and gun makers will most likely see a serious increase in gun ownership. After all, less law enforcement vs. more free crooks or potential recidivists does not add up to more security. I would also encourage all future victims of crimes perpetuated by released inmates -many will certainly recidivate- to sue the judges that have freed them for everything they owns. I certainly will do it and this is not a threat, just a fact!.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 The Teheran time, Jan 12 2009, quoted again President’s Obama’s pledge to meet Iranian leaders without any precondition. That campaign pledge marked a major change in the US foreign relation’s policies. Yesterday, Billary Clinton, our Secretary of State, implemented these changes and set the new bases of the new administration’s policy regarding dictatorship and repressive regimes:” Paying her first visit to Asia as the top US diplomat, Clinton said the United States would continue to press China on long-standing US concerns over human rights such as its rule over Tibet. &quot;But our pressing on those issues can&apos;t interfere on the global economic crisis, the global climate change crisis and the security crisis,&quot; Clinton told reporters in Seoul just before leaving for Beijing. “( AFP/POOL Feb 21 09) . But what to expect? The Clinton administration had already literally sold our economy out to China and Billary has not been picked for her qualifications but to rally her electorate. Her only qualifications come from following her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in foreign trips and she was nominated to the positions despite heavy froeign Middle Eastern investments to the Clinton foundation (conflict of Interest). The tone is set and we now know what the new America will stand for in the world! United Socialist States of America will be a stronger–and human rights blind- friend of Communist China! lol

Back to the Clinton years? 

In his first days of office, President Obama has signed two executive orders to close the prison of Guantanamo within a year–whatever it means- and to put an end to torture as our lawyers see it (what is torture? Is there ever a time when harsh treatment might be necessary, justifiable?).

The move will certainly appease a good part of his electorate and that was a political thing to do but is it the right or the safe thing to do? The 250 inmates left in Gitmo are the hard core terrorists that nobody want interned in his own backyard at home or abroad. They are the unrepentant and martyrdom seekers that our forces have captured on the battlefields of the War on Terror, or certainly kidnapped from the countries that were sheltering them, closing their eyes on their criminal activities or refusing to extradite them because we, the Americans, the Devil, the Yanquis, the infidels, the crusaders, the backers of Israel or other Bushists are the bad guys. In the meantime, in Guantanamo, no inmate has died yet from harsh treatment, and once confessions or information has been obtained from them, they have all been left sitting fat and happy with running hot water, electricity, news, the Koran, praying rugs, health care, laundry, translators, legal advices and all the many other generous amenities we traditionally provide our prisoners nationwide. Quite different anyways from what our prisoners, military or civilian, fighters or aid workers, get when they are captured by say Al Qaeda or the Talibans! 

Furthermore, it has also widely been reported that many of our released Guantanamo inmates went right back to swell the ranks of the terrorists they have served before. So, can you run it by me again why we should let them go? Because at the end of the day, that is what will happen with them if we try them in a civil or military court, isn’t it? For most of them, capture and confessions were“illegally”obtained according to the foo-foo suicidal world we live in and no charges would ever hold in a court of law. But if it makes you feel good about yourself, just go ahead, make their day!

The second executive order banning torture is an effective way to show the enemy abroad that they won’t be forced to“cooperate”if or when captured, and to neuter our intelligence community, again. When President Clinton cut our military down to 10 active combat divisions from the 20 we originally had, it was also the good political move to reward part of his electorate and redirect money from the Defense Budget to the typical Democrat social pandering. When he also prevented our intelligence community from hiring informants of questionable morals and ethics, he changed the focus from a balance of“dirty”Human Intelligence (HUMINT)and modern and“clean”Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) to an all SIGINT system. We know the results and they are always long term. We were not able to foresee the rise of Al Qaeda, the rise of Bin Laden and the 9-11 plot two years in the making before it actually happened. We were also not able to capture or kill Bin Laden, nor confirm or not the status of Saddam’s WMD program. The Bush administration and other Intelligence or Defense bi-party committees at Congress actually had to rely on“stale”SIGINT pieces of information coming from the highly inefficient and politically correct intelligence tool that the CIA had become under President Clinton and Mr. Tenet, unfortunately kept in place by the new Republican administration. 

Anyways, what is torture? I guess it is a matter of interpretation. As a former Special Forces operator, I know that water boarding, sleep deprivation and various other humiliations (tied naked to a pole, bag over the head, sensory deprivation,“good cop-bad cop”…) are standard operating procedures for Evasion and Escape training (E&amp;E). When such a treatment is applied to a soldier by his mates, without any actual physical violence and with the knowledge that he won’t actually die, it takes a couple of days to finally break the individual into submission. So is it torture when the same treatments we applied on these guys in Gitmo is applied on our soldiers as part of a training? Or should we just keep on doing it to the bad guy and deliver them E&amp;E certificate of training completion and get done with it?

I guess we must go and read the Geneva Convention to find the answer….but at least when you read it (and you will be one of the few), have the honesty to also read the chapters describing what is a combatant and what rules of war one must follow in order to become a prisoner of war protected by the convention. Actually, Article 3 and 4 of the convention are pretty clear about and say it all, but don’t take my word for it, go and check it out, educate yourself because knowledge is power! ( http://www.genevaconventions.org/ ).  

The articles accurately state:  

 “Art. 3. In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions: (1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. To this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons: (a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; (b) taking of hostages; (c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment; (d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. (2) The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for. An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict.

The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the present Convention.

The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict.

Art. 4. A. Prisoners of war, in the sense of the present Convention, are persons belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the power of the enemy:

(1) Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict, as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.

(2) Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfil the following conditions:[ (a) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; (b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance; (c) that of carrying arms openly; (d) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.

(3) Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.

(4) Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of military aircraft crews, war correspondents, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that they have received authorization, from the armed forces which they accompany, who shall provide them for that purpose with an identity card similar to the annexed model.

(5) Members of crews, including masters, pilots and apprentices, of the merchant marine and the crews of civil aircraft of the Parties to the conflict, who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any other provisions of international law.

(6) Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war.

B. The following shall likewise be treated as prisoners of war under the present Convention: (1) Persons belonging, or having belonged, to the armed forces of the occupied country, if the occupying Power considers it necessary by reason of such allegiance to intern them, even though it has originally liberated them while hostilities were going on outside the territory it occupies, in particular where such persons have made an unsuccessful attempt to rejoin the armed forces to which they belong and which are engaged in combat, or where they fail to comply with a summons made to them with a view to internment.”  

Also, one has to note that the terrorist groups and armies we fight are not even legal governments and have not signed the Convention anyways. So, does the Convention apply to them?

This is typical Asymmetric warfare, a warfare when one party is held to higher standards than the other. The war on Terror is all about asymmetric warfare and the US or Israel, as the most common examples, are permanently held to higher standards than the terrorist they fight, a good recipe for defeat. Just this morning, our local newspaper serving the city of Sacramento titled the following“Israel strikes Gaza after militants fire rocket”instead of stating the facts :”After terrorists in Gaza broke the truce again and fired a rocket, Israel had to strike back in retaliation!”.



President Obama has made a huge mistake and the consequences of his orders will be felt in a couple of years only, maybe when another unlucky Republican administration will take over. In the meantime ask yourselves these two questions:

Would you rather be a prisoner of our forces in Guantanamo or the prisoner of Al Qaeda in Iraq or Afghanistan?

Why do you think that you have been safe since 9-11? Because we have stepped up to the plate and fought or because the enemy has grown to love us, our life style, homosexuality, women’s right and Democracy, and all the other twisted Hollywood values we spread out?

Yes he can…look at us seriously and criticize Wall Street employees for more than $18 billion in bonuses paid in 2008 while the financial market was collapsing. He called it &quot;the height of irresponsibility&quot; while sitting next to his newly nominated Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, well known for evading taxes, but also recipient last year of $434,668 from the Federal Reserve Bank he was quitting to join Obama’s team at the White House. Yes he can and his most generous contributors were all the failing financial institutions that have been bailed out with my money. Yes he can, drop them now like he has dropped every single of his former associates that were“tainted”. Is anybody ever going to question his judgment, his association, is truthfulness or does he get a free pass. Anyways, it is OK…while Wall street was pouring money in his campaign coffers and cashing in bonuses, Bush was in charge and you can blame it on him while writing checks in adoration, goo-goo eyed in front of the ultimate political beast ever to serve in Washington. Discovered and trained by the best, he is delivering! Hail to the chief!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


OK guys…Porky has been fed and nothing will happen until the“pork barreled”bill has served all the special interests that barely elected the“Gifted one”…Cannot wait to see what the hundreds of millions of“neighborhood rehabilitation activities”are going to translate into…it also seems like ACORN and the other will get some of it! Go for it: YES YOU CAN!....but only for now…
Also note below the $2700 per every man and child in my district and remember that not all of them pay taxes.
Who should I write a check to? Can I opt for an IOU? After all California is going to send me one instead of the extra money they owe me for over paying my taxes! (I Owe You: IOU (debt) , an acknowledgment of debt)

 Dear Friend, 

 Yesterday I cast a“no”vote for the Democrat proposed $819 billion stimulus bill which passed 244-188. The 647 page bill was a virtual laundry list of government programs, most of which will do nothing to stimulate the economy. The cost estimate for residents of the Third Congressional District comes to $2,700 for every man, woman, and child.  

 Yesterday, we had an opportunity to take action that would have an immediate effect on our ailing economy.  However, when you look at the frivolous spending in this bill, along with what it will cost you, there is no way I could vote for it. A lot of these programs have nothing to do with creating new jobs or bringing relief to families and small business. I believe if we had focused on things like tax cuts–which have been shown to have an immediate effect on our economy and accelerate the appeals processes for local“shovel ready”projects, these areas would show immediate effect. When our economy is sinking in a sea of red ink, the only job Congress has is to concentrate on economic recovery. We face difficult circumstances and let’s not allow the current economic situation to be an excuse to engage in a reckless spending spree which will add to a growing mountain of debt. 

 I would like to draw your attention to Martin Feldstein’s Op-Ed in today’s Washington Post, &quot; An $800 Billion Mistake .&quot; 

 Sincerely, 

 Daniel E. Lungren
Member of Congress

 BILL CLINTON REVISITS HIS ECONOMIC LEGACY. 

At a meeting with progressive bloggers and journalists at the Sheraton New York Monday night, Bill Clinton , preparing for the opening of his Clinton Global Initiative conference, spoke freely about the financial crisis, and re-examined his own administration&apos;s economic legacy in light of the meltdown.

&quot;I have thought about that,&quot; Clinton told me when I asked whether he was reconsidering any of the deregulatory economic policies his administration pursued under Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin . Earlier this year, Rubin downplayed the extent of the mortgage crisis, and implied more of the blame could be placed on American consumers than on the excesses of Wall Street. But Clinton&apos;s assessment was quite different.

&quot;I actually called Bob Rubin,&quot; Clinton said, relaying their recent conversation about what could or should have been done differently during the 1990s to help prevent today&apos;s crisis. Clinton said he has two regrets: First, not pursuing more aggressively an aborted attempt to provide stricter oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. According to Clinton, the move was stymied by Democratic and Republican members of Congress and by mayors, who saw the lending giants as &quot;the New Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;pure&quot; because of their role in increasing homeownership to historic levels. But &quot;it just didn&apos;t feel good,&quot; Clinton said of Fannie and Freddie&apos;s outsized political influence.

Clinton also said he should have subjected derivative trading to more public oversight. &quot;We would have failed, but at least we could&apos;ve sounded the alarm.&quot;

Sir, Madam (to Congress!)

You have already wasted hundreds of millions of hard earned money in the bailing out of the financial institutions, all these banks and other mortgage companies. No strings were attached, no controls imposed and no“heads”have fallen. But what to expect? The Fanny May and other Lehman or Freddy Mac have been the biggest contributors to your political campaigns, left and right.
Now that the public has become aware of the waste, and of the arrogance and wastefulness of the institutions that we have allowed to help, our new president is talking about reinstating the financial safeguards that had been put in place after the great depression and conveniently abolished by the Clinton administration, also creator of the Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac parking garage for fallen Democrats. Now it is time to revisit the plan McCain unsuccessfully tried to implement two years ago and fix Wall Street!  

You people in DC are so predictable….no wonder the approval rating rate of Congress bottoms around 11%.
But it is a wonder that we, The People, believe that you can actually fix the crisis next time you try, with another $1,2 trillion of our money. How desperate or gullible can we be?
Anyways…this note is about the recovery packages assigned to the States. 

California is expecting a $26 billion freebee from the Federal Government. We have been without a budget for months and the State is going down the hole with a minimum of $40 billion deficit. The legislature is deadlocked in its partisan approaches and none of the offered solutions are really aiming at fixing the many problems, but at raising money to lower the debt. Providing any kind of money to the State is going to have the same effect as giving money to the banks. Instead of looking for the problems, fixing them, making hard choices, cutting the waste, restructuring, etc, California, the recipient of your“social check”will just use it to resume a lifestyle of waste, irresponsibility, revolving doors and golden parachutes. Why should money from taxpayers from fiscally conservative and responsible States be used to bail out wasteful, corrupted and fiscally irresponsible California? Whatever money coming from outside will be wasted, rerouted, diverted, raided for more pet projects, more new six figure positions made up for politicos on standby, more wasteful commissions to promote the sale of the Californian avocado or Californian milk, more service cars, per diem, credit cards, stupid projects… 

Furthermore, if the Feds take over infrastructure, why should I pay State taxes for the roads and bridges?

We, The People, are so fed up and We know that the legislative is there to balance executive and judicial. What were you doing in the intelligence committees when stale intelligence was sold to us and led us to the war? What were you doing in the various economic and financial committees? Was anybody awake when the signs of a catastrophic crisis were written on the wall? How many dot.com and other artificially inflated economy based on wind–literally- do you need to do what you have been elected for? 

I have a joke that you don’t have a crisis as long as you have taxpayers to milk!

So go ahead and keep on repeating the same mistakes over and over hoping sometimes to get different results (definition of insanity) The People don’t approve of you nor trust you anymore and will hopefully remember how bad you people perform now that they don’t have President Bush to blame anymore. President Obama is the good guy now and all the scrutiny and blame is going to come to you. 

I wonder if you can fall below a 10% of approval ratings. I am sure you will and even the media will start picking on you. Remember that 57 million people did not vote for the current administration. 

We will see soon

Has King’s dream come true? On the one hand, for almost forty years, Marin Luther King’s legacy has been affirmative action, the legalization of racial discrimination. So much for the dream and“the force of the character and not the color of the skin”. Poor MLK must be turning in his tomb with his name reduced to some Burger King’s meal appellation and his dream totally perverted with the full support of the people he stood for. On the other hand, the first“black”president will take the oath tomorrow, something Martin Luther King has always dreamed of, an achievement showing that race indeed can be an opportunity. But for whom? Race still being an issue for the world’s media and for the majority on the left that have forever cashed on the“victimization”of the minorities (money for special programs, and votes), our new president has become a symbolic figure, not of“multi-racialism”but of African American achievement. For some reason, Barrack Obama is an African American, a black president. Not half black of half white, just hundred percent black. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton (currently unemployed!) might disagree and have always claimed loudly that Obama was not black enough, nor was he African American enough to serve the black cause (of entitlement and self victimization?). So for now, let us enjoy our first elitist“black”president that would have made MLK proud. But remember that if and when he does not meet the high expectations (political, racial or economic) put on his shoulders by voters who bought his rhetoric of changes, he is going to be dropped like an old sock and will most likely become the first half white US president.

“California&apos;s Supreme Court ruled that the state&apos;s Good Samaritan law only protects people from liability if they are administering emergency medical care”. So people, out there, in a wrecked smoldering car, or laying down with your bike on a busy intersection , or drowning in a pool, choking on gas leaking from a stove or carbon monoxide infiltrating your car, or certain to suffer of a sun stroke in your closed van in summer…two words for you: tough luck! I won’t try to protect you from an inevitable fate. I will stop, try to prevent the situation from getting worse, call 911, and look at you burn alive, be run over again by a speeding car, drown, choke, die…My last words to you, begging for help, will be:“The Supreme Court said that you are going to die”. I already changed my first aid kit in my car for a bag of Marshmallows. While the car burns, with you in it, I might grill some and offer you one while awaiting 15 minutes in urban area, and up to hours in the wild, for“trained professionals”to show up. How long can you hold your breath?

The fox in the henhouse! I quote the Bee: Obama&apos;s camp defended Geithner. &quot;He made a common mistake on his taxes, and was unaware that his part-time housekeeper&apos;s work authorization expired for the last three months of her employment,&quot; Now people, you know why we are in the financial and illegal immigration mess we are in! I would not pay taxes and be caught hiring illegals, I would get a fine and maybe jail, not a job as a Treasury Secretary. Why on earth would Geithner need any qualification for his job in the new administration? After all, look at the Caroline Kennedy and other Valery Jarret that were pushed for the senate. And what about Richardson? Is anybody ever going to question Obama’s judgment regarding his past and present sulfurous or insipid associations? Oooops…what am I thinking: scrutiny by the media is only reserved to Republicans and Conservatives.

Two years ago, the Folsom lake was closed for navigation July first. Last year, we ran short of water June first and water use was rationned by the city of Foslom around september. Rafting the American river is now hundred percent dependent of dam releases and there is no more excess of water. Predictions reported by the Bee forecast a three year drought because of El Nino. There is no more water guys! Our consumption and waste has overexceeded our resources and there is no dam, nor canal, nor desalinization that will change that. The South is thirsty so desert can be turned into green grass around LA, lakeshore artificial development in Palm Springs or agriculture in the valley. Game is over! Whatever gimmick is used won&apos;t work because too many people have been invited to the party and the cake is too small. It is not time to re-route or store the little water we have but time to re-evaluate its use.

FUNNY! The changes we have been waiting for are finally coming…Amazingly, the same people who attacked Sarah Palin are now supporting a“politically green”Caroline Kennedy (real co-author of many books with no voting records and no political experience, but with the name recognition of Paris Hilton) and whatever made the former“unqualified”for a VP job makes the latter“fresh”for Senate. The same way, the people who voted out Hillary at the primaries because they were tired of the Clinton dynasty are now applauding Obama’s Clintonite cabinet and the perpetuation of the Kennedy senatorial line at all cost. Also, experience counts, President Elect Obama was considering appointing his old politically inexperienced friend Valerie Jarret as senator of Illinois, but she“removed”herself once the“Bribojevich”scandal erupted and she got a cozy job at the White House instead. And finally, Biden, away from the flood lights, has secured“his”senatorial seat by temporarily putting a faithful“seat warmer”in charge while waiting for his son Beau to take over once he retires from the military.

Talking about changes also brings forward the Obama’s camp dealing with the Bribojevich scandal. Obama needed an internal investigation by“impartial”incoming White House attorney Greg Craig to prove to us that he, himself, did not have any direct contacts with the crook, and that the part of his staff that was interviewed did not have any“inappropriate”contacts with Blago either. So the Messiah was right…no direct contact, just through his staff, right? But what about“inappropriate”? What about the one that evaded investigation? How does Obama’s camp defines“inappropriate”? I quote the AP:“Emanuel had one or two conversations with Blagojevich and four with Harris on the subject of the Senate seat, according to the review. The report said Obama authorized Emanuel to pass on the names of four people he considered to be highly qualified to take over his seat—Illinois Comptroller Dan Hynes, Illinois Veterans&apos; Affairs Director Tammy Duckworth, Rep. Jan Schakowsky and Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.“and also“The report said that earlier, Emanuel recommended Jarrett for the Senate seat without Obama&apos;s knowledge, and Jarrett later accepted a job as a senior White House adviser.”and also, later on“Craig revealed his findings into a memo to Obama. The memo was dated Tuesday (Dec 23), but a transition official said an initial copy was given to Obama on Dec. 15. On that day, Obama announced that the report was ready but that he was withholding it from public release for a week at the request of the U.S. attorneys still conducting their investigation.“

What a bunch of crooks…and the report was conveniently released when OBObama was on vacation in Hawaii and Emanuel in a“long planned vacation in Africa”, at the time when a Hollywood photographer–not one of the thousands of paparazzi swarming Hawaii- was strolling the beach by himself, camera in hand, and stumbled upon a beefy shirtless OBObama…and the picture made the news, the web, the searches…and put the report on the sideline. Tell you what guys; your man is a politician to the core, a smart one, a real one. He knows all the tricks of the book and has already applied them on you, the gullible. I decided to rename him OBObama“the gifted”!

Yes he can and yes they can, with or without experience! Should I put pinky filters on to look at the new world of changes coming to D.C?

For the past six months I have only tried to show you that“The gifted”is a real politician, deep pocketed and self serving as his mentors from Illinois. He learned from the best after all! I wish him success in fixing what Bush has never really broken and at mopping after the financial mess and“no strings attached”bail outs congress gave us. I am glad that he is smelling the coffee, awaking to the real life…Afghanistan needs more troops; middle class needs the new administration to continue with the tax breaks implemented by Bush; financial institutions need to be safeguarded against Clinton-like deregulations in the spirit of the failed Republican attempt to do so two years ago; failing companies might/should fail and reorganize or go; no matter how black a potential senator from Illinois could be, a“Bribo”backup stinks; Israel is doing what he claimed there he would do if people were launching rockets at his daughters, etc, etc…”The gifted”is drifting center…Boo Hooo!

 Happy New Year 2009 and may Peace be with you!   

 India and Pakistan: 

The aftermath of the terrorist attack of Mumbai are scary because of the increasing military tensions between two nuclear powers that have regularly been at hot and cold war since 1948. Of course you have all heard about the Mumbai terror attacks and proven Pakistanese links to training camps and local officials and Islamic groups.  There is a saying in India that all states have an army but in Pakistan, the army has a state, and the current government of Pakistan does seem powerless in the hands of its military. Furthermore, Pakistan today is afraid not just of Indian reactions (surgical strikes and so on) but also of a likely international community&apos;s backlash especially US, and maybe also of some sort of Israeli revenge strike for the brutal killing of Jews in Mumbai. To escape political, economic or military retaliation, the Pakistanese military seems to be willing to create a war hysteria, which they hope will divert the attention of the international community. India is not keen to start a war but may be inclined to somehow retaliate against the terror infrastructure in Pakistan, with international support if they can garner it. Of course such an action would most likely mean some level of war for Pakistan and tension is growing. As far as the military buildup at the Indian/Pakistanese border goes, it is fooling the west for now but also weakening the Pakistanese military presence in the tribal and Al Qaeda areas at a time when it is also reported that Islamic groups are spreading and conquering more provinces by force and terror, imposing Islamic laws and parallel governments to the local people that did not flee. The Talibans and the Pakistanese army have never been really enthusiast at fighting each other and creating a war hysteria that relegates India’s justified anger to the side line is helping both unlikely allies in Pakistan. But in the long run, Pakistan is the losing party! In the meantime, the Allied task in Afghanistan will become tougher because the Taliban and terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan has been left alone and unchecked. I wonder who will win that one: the“sane”or the terrorists? I wonder if America will fill the vacuum and resume the necessary surgical strikes in Pakistan, with India, under the“cover”of an“international alliance”. 

 Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas: 

The title is not a mistake! Israel is not finally retaliating against the Palestinian people but against Hamas, a terrorist and mostly foreign organization paid, trained and armed by a foreign country (Iran) that has hijacked a democratic process to take over the land and manipulate its people. Hamas, Iran, don’t want peace in the region, don’t care much for the Palestinians. Hezbollah, in Lebanon, is another terrorist and mostly foreign organization paid, trained and armed by a foreign country (Iran) that has hijacked a democratic process to take over the land of Lebanon and manipulate its people. Hezbollah, Iran, don’t want peace in the region, don’t care much for the Lebanese. Sounds familiar? Same story different place and same goals! Hezbollah is currently flexing its muscles again, stirring the anti-Jew hatred pot in Lebanon and getting ready to open a second front against Israel. The Palestinian and the Lebanese people have historically been the unwilling pawns of the self serving anti-Israel policies of neighboring countries that took turns leading the charge. Syria, Libya, Egypt, Jordan and Iran have always been involved, together or alone, at one time or another. Using Lebanon or the land given to the Palestinians (Gaza strip) as the starting point for terrorist or military attacks has been a traditional sport of the Arab powers since the state of Israel was created... War by proxy and to hell with the people they claim to protect: they don’t care much about them and they should die for their cause too. Israel has hammered down again and again the recent Hezbollah’s rearming policies and provided worrisome figures for the world to ponder with. Hezbollah is allegedly a 14,000 fighters strong force and could also assemble 10,000 reservists. Its arsenal could include Russian made anti aircraft portable missiles and about 30,000 rockets (short range, 107 and 122mmm, many of them provide by Iran and Syria). Hezbollah, Iran, must feel secure in Lebanon, hiding among the civilian population while setting home-made rocket launch pads on timers along the Israeli border. But thinking that the next Israel offensive will be as politically correct and weak as the 2006“Second Lebanon War”could be a fatal error. The February 2009 Knesset Elections are looming in Israel and the weaklings, led by Olmert are on the way out. Olmert is still the acting leader of a caretaker government despite his resignation but watch out for the tough rising star, Tzipi Livni!

 Somalia and Piracy: 

Civil war: The United Nations are currently debating about the stabilization of“The Horn of Africa” and considering again the creation of another multinational force of“Blue Helmets”to intervene in Somalia against the Islamist militias that are holding most of the country and waging a brutal civil war that has been a long lasting humane tragedy. President Abdullah Yusuf has resigned and fled the country with his followers upon learning that the Ethiopian military that was fighting the Islamists for him was bound to withdraw (by the way…read an older newsletter of mine talking about the US Congress financed genocide in Ethiopia and the US complacency toward it as long as Ethiopia fights the terrorists in Somalia!). Somalia is now left in a vacuum the Islamists are quickly going to fill unless something is done. Sure, 2600 African Union soldiers are already there under the banner of the UN but they have not been effective at all. A new UN resolution, #1831, is going to renew for six months the mandate of that force with a wishful clause for some country to show up and provide them with“logistical, political and technical reinforcements”! The financial cost and the total lack of security in the country is less than appealing and financial aid to help sustain 3,5 million starving Somalis have been steadily decreasing. Also, many Non Governmental Organizations have left the country, unable to safely provide a much needed medical help for the locals. Somalia seems like a lost cause and the UN is basically trying to jump start some kind of international interest in the fate of the victims of the long lasting civil war. A 10,000 strong UN force with a clear mandate might be able to lower the“tensions”between neighboring Eritrea and Ethiopia, both respectively providing support to the warring factions, Islamic militias for the former and local government for the latter. But we all know that the UN is as strong as the modern Western country that makes and finances the bulk of its force, and as successful as its will to win the thing is strong. Who on earth would want to go back there? America? Been there, been kicked out. France: been there, done that, wasted lives, time and money, left…Anybody out there?

Piracy: In April 2008, Somali pirates captured a French luxury cruise boat,“Le Ponant”, and took thirty people hostage. On April 11, the government agreed to pay the two million Euros ransom and recovered boat and hostages. In the meantime, the pirates were tracked leaving the boat with the money and boarding a SUV. They took off through the desert until ambushed by French combat helicopters that destroyed the engine of the truck. 6 terrorists were captured along with the ransom and two killed. In September 2008, the 15th, the French sail boat“Carre d’As”is captured by Pirates around the tip of the“Horn of Africa”. 30 French Special Forces operatives and Marines assaulted the boat, killed the terrorists and recovered the hostages. The night assault was“book perfect”with high altitude air coordination and intelligence, close air support helicopters on standby, a Malaysian hospital boat at the ready, a speed boat for diversion and an assault boarding party on a secondary vessel. Technology (Night vision devices, radio transmitters…), intelligence, discretion, skills and speed made it possible. Do you think that the Pirates have gotten the message not to attack French boats anymore? 

And Georgia (Russian military punishment and aftermath: Cold War?), Ukraine (Russia and port of Sebastopol), Dagestan (rebels vs. Russia), the US missile shield in Eastern Europe vs. Russia, the Philippines (Muslim separatist threat), Northern Ireland (extremist cell splitting from IRA resuming the war?), North Mali…and North Korea, Thailand, China, Tibet, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Guinea, Zimbabwe, Myanmar…

Child Maid trafficking, California, Dec 28th

Yes, it is true: white Westerners did not invent slavery and have long abolished it. But in 2008 Africa, the Middle East and Asia, slavery is still doing good. From time to time, the issue makes the news and for us, the &quot;junk news&quot; addicts (bad news quickly), it becomes true until a Kennedy runs for office or a Spears goes panty-less. Sweat shops, chained students in Coranic school (Chad), sex slaves, Pilipino maids for Arab sheiks, Russian girls for catalog sale, underage girls and boys for the brothels of Thailand or Cambodia, stolen or purchased children all over the third world (for everything from paid adoption, mining to prostitution or body parts harvesting), ...you name it! The world is a nasty place to live in and most of the people don&apos;t have the rights nor the freedom the Western Democracies enjoy. If there is one lesson for 2009, it is the following: Freedom is not free and every day, you should thank a God, your parents and veterans for living in America.

Calif. Court: Would-be Good Samaritan can be sued Dec 19, 2008

“California&apos;s Supreme Court ruled that the state&apos;s Good Samaritan law only protects people from liability if they are administering emergency medical care”. So people, out there, in a wrecked smoldering car, or laying down with your bike on a busy intersection , or drowning in a pool, choking on gas leaking from a stove or carbon monoxide infiltrating your car, or certain to suffer of a sun stroke in your closed van in summer…two words for you: tough luck! I won’t try to protect you from an inevitable fate. I will stop, try to prevent the situation from getting worse, call 911, and look at you burn alive, be run over again by a speeding car, drown, choke, die…My last words to you, begging for help, will be:“The Supreme Court said that you are going to die”. I already changed my first aid kit in my car for a bag of Marshmallows. While the car burns, with you in it, I might grill some and offer you one while awaiting 15 minutes in urban area and up to hours in the wild, for“trained professionals”to show up.

Obama review clears staff in Blagojevich case

The changes we have been waiting for are coming. President Elect Obama needs a lawyer and internal investigation to figure out if he, himself, has had direct contact with the corrupt Governor of Illinois. Furthermore, he guarantees the public that the members of his staff that have been interviewed did not have any“inappropriate”contacts related to the sale of the Illinois’s Senate seat. Clinton did not have sex and Obama’s staff had only appropriate contacts with“Bribojevich”. Were they related to Valery Jarret, candidate #1? Was Emanuel Rahm involved? I just wonder why would Obama’s staff dodge scrutiny and questions if their only“wrong doing”was to reward an inexperienced but supportive friend with a senatorial job. No matter the wrapping, a politician is still a politician and one month only from taking office, President Elect Obama is showing that changes should be deeply rooted in continuity!

Caroline Kennedy seeks senate seat,

 Arab World Embraces shoe tosser

Good…Iraqis, Saudis, Libyans and other in various Arab“open democratic societies”are saluting the arrival of Western values in Baghdad. Only in a Western democracy can a citizen throw something at a president or other leader without being thrown alive into a wood chipper along with three or four generations of his/her relatives. The cowardly Arab world applauds something that would be just comical in our side of the world while at the same time, realizing deep down inside that there is no way they would survive doing the same to any of their leaders. It reminds me of the old cold war joke: a Russian and an American are talking Democracy. I can go in front of the white house and call president Reagan names, said the American. And the Soviet to reply: We have Democracy too…I can go in front of the Kremlin and call president Reagan names too.

How low can interest rates go? 

Interest rates should never be lower than what we pay when we borrow money on the international market. If Chinese money comes at a 6% rate, it should also be at a minimum of 6% when the Federal Reserve provides it to the domestic market. Does it make sense to any but me? Foreign prime rate range from 2 to 13%. In the past ten years, while our own interest rates fell down, the“Net foreign ownership“of American assets was multiplied by five. America has sent more and more money and interest abroad, allowing foreign countries and institutions to buy even more US assets in return, and cash in more dividends. The final outcome of such a downturn spiral is easy to foresee: Bankruptcy!


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The world through Pinky glasses

“Rezko may be spilling the bean”. That was the title of an article ran by my local and lefty only paper a couple of months ago, during the electoral campaign, while OBObama was severing his links to all the people that made him. The article was describing Rezko, how he raised millions for local politicians, his links to the PE (offered him his first job after law school, funded his early political career, helped launch is senatorial career, bought a house nearby and gave/sold a piece of the land, etc, etc…) and his relation with the administration of Illinois governor Bribojevich. The article was predicting“explosive political fallout”, a possible“October surprise”that could hurt the Democrats, and the upcoming fall of Bribojevich. It took two extra months to convict the latter and in view of his character, I cannot wait to see who is next on the list. Already, Jesse Jackson Jr is trying to save his career and many more are already coming forth while others are certainly keeping a low profile and praying that they won’t be exposed. With both Rezko and Bribojevich potentially singing like birds or trying to blackmail their way out of jail, God only knows what the next bomb is going to be. Is it just me or OBObama is gifted in picking the wrong people to associate with. Look at his speech writer…suddenly the picture groping is not a biggy and sexism is not in Billary’s mind anymore. Look at the difference of treatment between Bush and his drinking when young and the PE’s drug use and smoking. The changes we have been waiting for are coming…corruption is not corruption, sexism is not sexism, drug use is not alcohol, people who have been attacking Palin are now supporting a completely“politically green”Kennedy and whatever made the former“unqualified”makes the latter“fresh”, and the people who voted out Hillary at the primaries because tired of the Clinton dynasty are now applauding OBObama’s Clintonite cabinet and the perpetuation of the Kennedy dynasty at all cost. Put your pinky filters on and look at the new world….and remember, he did not have any sex with that lady!

California near financial Armageddon!

Good try Governor…35 days of the“legislature failing to act”, really? I have been here nine years already and have never seen the state’s legislature do anything but waste time and money, fill deep pockets, cater to generous“special interest groups”, practice the revolving door dance and the inter agency“piggy back”salary scheme, grant regular raises, surrender to unions, issue bonds, and throw to the people’s vote everything that is too risky politically. Is Armageddon worse than that? Not sure. What about California filing Chapter 11? Judges and auditors would be reevaluating salary and perks, would repossess the free cars and per diem for idling days, would make sure that legislators are totally kicked out when they are voted out, would scrutinize expenses and reimbursement,“political contributions”that smell bribes, second careers that feel like payback, conflict of interests and mismanagement. A bankruptcy court would also track every cent of our money and might even be able to solve the budget crisis by adding common sense and sanity to the Capitol. Let’s go for it Governator! Drastic time call for drastic measures…or let’s lease California to China...they could use the extra space.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

After“The day without the Mexicans”, here comes the day without the Gays! It was a good idea but a little misplaced on the calendar. I wish the freaky fringe of the Gay community - the leather and butt in the air and biker looking crowd- would skip the Folsom street parade or that the gay community would take a day off during the gay pride. That is when we would notice their absence–favorably- and not miss a public indecency that would put anyone else without a rainbow flag in jail. But who am I to judge, right? I am not“sensitive”enough, nor fair enough to understand why people need to walk around half naked, drag each other by leashes like obedient dogs, or wear pink bikinis when male, forty and overweight. It is all about love, equality and rights….morals and decency are sooooo outdated, me square-minded conservative me!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

I am so tired of foreigners coming here and trying to make this country exactly like theirs after escaping a dirt poor and often intolerant place. A Sikh wanted to become a prison guard (and that is commendable). The prison rules facial hairs to guarantee that the mandatory gas mask will work in case of a prison riot and the use of tear gas or smoke. He did not like it for religious reasons, refused to shave, sued for discrimination…and won. Why change my lifestyle when I can change America, right? And what is next? The beard will prevent his protection for any gas or smoke often used in cases of riots. Should the Californian Department of Correction accommodate him with a cozy special job away from inmates and risks of riots? Is he going to sue if he gets exposed to gas or smoke and get physically affected? What if hundreds of Sikh apply for the CDC jobs now, get hired and sheltered? Who is going to conduct riot control? Your“innocence”is killing me and will soon kill you anyways. But what do I know? I am a foreigner, from Europe doing in America what Americans do!

Presidential Order, WWII internment camps to be part of national monument

When are we going to stop with the guilt? When the country is supposed to celebrate the“Day of Infamy”, the day of the Japanese treacherous attack on Pearl Harbor that led America to WW2 in Europe and in the Pacific, President Bush turned part of a WW2 Japanese internment camp into a national monument. I feel sorry for the internment but war is war, the Japanese enemy was merciless, and America eventually paid reparations ($20,000 check per survivor or remaining families of the WW2 internment camps). Why not also focus on the active heroes, the survivors of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team of the United States Army, a unit composed of Japanese Americans who fought in Europe? Japan never paid any war reparations, Hirohito stayed in power (just think of us letting Hitler in power at the end of WW2) and the war criminals of his family were pardoned. The Japanese armies enslaved the non-Japanese populations of their Chinese and Pacific conquests, experimented on human beings (Unit 731 researched biological warfare and conducted human experimentation), and slaughtered, raped, and murdered everybody from POWs (read/watch“The Great Raid”) to civilians (read/watch“The rape of Nanking”:300.000 people slaughtered, raped, massacred in six weeks) while dragging around forced sex slaves from Korea. I am still looking into the history of WW2 in the Pacific for a single example of compassion shown by the enemy. Have you found any?

What’s next on war on Pot? 

What was the Bee thinking, running a long front page piece on pot legalization in California? Did the millionaire George Soros, the perseverant advocate of free pot, sponsor it? In a completely unrelated article, page A18, the Bee also reported that Amsterdam, the famed city of illegal pot but legal“coffee shops”and prostitution was going to modify its highly criminalized social experiment and clean its city center from its crime generating brothels, pot bars and other sex clubs.
The answer to the question“What’s next on war on Pot?”might be found in the reason why Amsterdam is reconsidering its landmark activities: legal gambling, prostitution and drugs bring organized crime and criminality and the former tolerant and crazy city is now becoming famous as a“free zone for criminals.”

Obama vows massive work program.

I am getting worried when I hear that the bankrupt Federal government plans on taking over the responsibilities of the States regarding infrastructure and schools. Does it mean that we are not going to pay State taxes toward roads and bridges anymore? Does it mean that our failed expensive Californian education system will cost us less that the $50 billion it costs us today? Or does it mean that our Federal taxes are just going to increase while our local taxes will stay the same? The Federal government should just stick to what it is responsible and paid for and Obama should not be considering entrusting our worst Congress ever with more money to waste and programs to mismanage. Furthermore, it is most likely that all these FDR like gimmicks will create low wage jobs, adequate for waves of illegals that will come back to benefit the foreseeably uncontrolled huge and wasteful programs. Have you seen any cheap and efficient program coming from Washington lately, beside throwing good taxpayer’s monies on top of bad? Get a clue!

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


$11 billion deficit? Who are we kidding? If I remember well, we were already $15 billion in the hole last year. Furthermore, a Federal judge has imposed the state to pay $9 billion -rain or shine- to fix the prison’s medical system. That is a total of $24 billion. If we add the $10 to $25 billion“gap”predicted for the 08-09 budget alone, we end up next year with a $34 to $50 billion deficit! That is the equivalent of the cost of our failed education system, or half of what the State needs to function every year! Next year, sunny California would need $150 billion to make it through this fiscal year and plug its“structural”hole. But with a predicted 2009 tax income of only $85 to $75 billion, we can expect the state to practice deep cuts in services, borrow more money at an insane interest rate and increase taxes while awarding its yearly raises and wasting our hard earned dollars. During the dot com, and the housing bubble, when money was flowing, they spent like drunken sailors and today they need more. Is it time to move out of here and let them pay the bills?

I am so tired. I wish I did not care, nor have TV or newspapers.
I might just go back to my native island of Corsica!

No bailout

The automaker bailout comedy is pathetic. The CEO of Ford pledging no salary for 2009 when he piled up $50 millions in the past two years alone…and their private jets…and now taking the train…Pathetic.
Congress is also confirming its 12% approval rating with questions that are completely out of touch with reality…why do you build and make Hummers. Because they sell and automakers are in the business of selling what sells and not saving the planet.
Finally, I don’t believe it is up to the government to tell private industries what to build and sale. What do you want to impose: an East German Trabant like universal car? I would buy whatever I feel, foreign if the US automakers cannot provide.
If bailing them out we do, the strings should be on exec salaries and parachutes, restructuration, consolidation, controls…
There is a cheap way out of the problem: tell automakers to sell here what they build for Europe or in Europe. Smaller cars, small engines, 35/40 mpg average, lots of diesel turbo that is cleaner than gasoline and very low emission (cars are taxed on emission levels). Let them do it, make them!
Go and check out Ford France or Germany. Check out Opel, that is GM in Germany. Look at their cars and the range….Amazing!
And they get awards every year for green car or environmental innovation.
The European security and pollution tests are even harder than ours and bringing the cars over here should be easy.
Ford and GM know how to build fuel efficient and environmentally responsible cars. Opel (GM) is coming up with a revolutionary hybrid car that runs on an electric engine and has a small gasoline motor that only start to recharge the batteries.

Bring here what they sell in Europe! 

Go check it out by curiosity, get educated and challenge them: they have the skills, experience and know how…they don’t need much money…just a kick in their fat unionized and anti business behinds!

This is too funny. I have only been away for three weeks, on vacation back home to Corsica, and the Clintons and their administration are already back in the White House. I could not believe it when my folks at home told me Billary would be State Secretary…no way, not after the vicious things the Clinton said and did to OBObama! And she has no experience beside trailing her Hubby on official trips and drinking tea with the other wives. What about Health? At least she has some experience if she learned from her failures…LOL…You guys wanted change and you got the“same old, same old” Washingtonite elite. What was it again:“I am the one we have been waiting for!”,“change we can believe in!”…yeah right! Show me changes! 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We have seen what is wrong with the political system today: the increasing role of money and the obsolete electoral system. The FEC website shows that the campaign have cost $1,5 billion(all candidates included). Obama has disclosed $639 million against $335 million for Mc Cain. Money talks and the traditional somewhat controlled public funding has lost against the Obama’s money machine and its unlimited and uncontrolled“small donations”, mainly from the same big corporations that have also fueled MacCain. Furthermore, we must move away from the obsolete 1845 “winner takes all”electoral college and adopt a modern direct democracy system. People should make a president! Not money games and corporate America. People, not elected representatives, should make a president, especially when these elected officials have the lowest approval ratings ever in the history of the country. $1,5 billion spent on disinformation and negative ads by a two party political monopoly to ensure that the Lehman bros and other Fanny May stay in power! A joke. Tomorrow, along with a new President, we will wake up to the real world again, disenchanted and with a big headache. Elections are on Tuesday…a good thing! Why waste a perfectly good weekend?

I think prostitution should be decriminalized across the whole state and I admire San Francisco for trying. And also gambling out of Indian land. And drugs too...Everything legal!
We would build a wall around California and would elect Kurt Russel as our next governor. Illegal immigrants would not make the news coming in anymore -beside Mexican drug cartels- and the nation headlines would only cover &quot;Escapes from CA&quot;.
Come on. Money has no color, flavor, odor, morals or panties. Just think on how much taxes could come in through state paid pimps, drug and card dealers. Even food stamps would be accepted to buy a joint, play roulette or get some VD. I love it. When do we start? Where do I sign? When do we vote?

 Prop 8
I am tired of reading that Connecticut has joined the“forward”thinking states that have allowed same sex couples to marry. The Supreme Court of Connecticut has spoken, not the people. October 28th, Connecticut will indeed join California and Massachussets as the third state were a couple of judges have decided that their interpretation of the constitution is the law and that the people should not even be consulted or listened to. Prop eight will most likely pass on Nov fourth in California, like it did a couple of years ago. Nov fifth, the losing parties will start their lawsuits. Soon after, again, our judges will overturn the vote of the people. Next year, like for the two past years, a few gay activist groups will lobby to amend our school curriculums again in order to integrate the contribution of famous gay Californians to the history of the state or celebrate–and discuss at school- a“Harvey Milk”day, the collateral murder of an openly gay San Francisco supervisor in 1978 (Arguably, Mayor Moscone was the target). Please, report the facts and try not to contribute to social engineering. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

November 4, 2020. A new Prop 8 is on the ballot and reminds us all the 08“civil right”struggle, when gay marriage was the issue. The few Californians who remained after the state’s bankruptcy of 2009 are listening again to their octogenarian Senator, Barbara Feinstein. She says that Prop 8 is again about discrimination and that she has seen it too often in her lifetime. She says that &quot;Proposition 8 is a mean-spirited effort which will hurt so many Californians. I urge my fellow Californians to vote no on Proposition 8.&quot; A“No on prop 8”is about equality and basic rights, and it is good to California because it will prevent the modification of the constitution to punish loving and consenting adults in a strong relationship.

Yes, adult, loving and consenting incestuous couples should also have the right to marry in a state where prostitution, gambling and drugs have become legal and taxable to pay for education.

Vote NO on prop 8 2020! 

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If my mathematics is correct, we were already $15 billion in the hole last year. Furthermore, a Federal judge has imposed the state a $9 billion bill to pay -rain or shine- in order to fix the prison’s medical system (universal healthcare for inmates!). That is a total of $24 billion. If we add the $10 to $25 billion“gap”predicted for this budget alone, we end up next year with a $34 to $50 billion deficit! That is the equivalent of the budget for our failed education system, or half of what the State needs to function every year! Sunny California would need a mere $150 billion to make it through the 08-09 fiscal year and plug the“structural”hole. With a predicted income of $85 to $75 billion, we can expect the state to increase the“structural”deficit, practice deep cuts, borrow more money at an insane interest rate and increase taxes. During the dot com, and the housing bubble, when money was flowing, they spent like drunken sailors and today they need more. Is it time to move out of here and let them pay the bills?

Barack who?

For someone who“wants to reclaim the American dream”, he is the living proof that the dream exist and is well! He attended private and expensive colleges still discreet about his records. He became a“civil right”lawyer, the attack dog used by“civil right”law firms and organizations to enforce social engineering, promote political and social correctness, get taxpayer’s money for entitlement programs. Groomed and trained in corrupt Illinois, he was made Senator with Rezko’s money and Ayers endorsement. Paid by financial institution, mortgage industry, Universities and health care lobbies (the core of his plan for America is to“socialize”them), he has surrendered himself with the same people he runs his campaign criticizing, from shady characters to old career politicians. Ultimate sleek political machine, he rebounds each time he his attacked, quickly severs exposed connections to crooks, brandish the racial scarecrow and comes back telling us what we want to hear, but riding the wave of the same people and special interests that are harming this country, and us. Should we think of him as a polished and Harvard trained Sharpton or Jackson. Maybe! Look at his life, his achievements, his“civil right’crusades, his goals. Is he innocent, so different from the Washingtonian political machine he belongs to. No!

Vote Barack! Vote Goldman Sachs, Lehmans bro, Countrywide, Fanny and Freddie…vote corrupt CEOs and failed politicians in office. We need more milking of the few that pay taxes and more wealth redistribution and entitlements (“rights”) toward the majority of the Americans that believe that the government should provide them with everything.What on earth has happened to“Don’t ask yourself what the government can do for you, yada, yada…”and“I have a dream that one day my children would be recognized for the force of their character and not the color of yada, yada…”. Obama is all about the color and what the government–taxpayers- should do for you. So go ahead freeloaders, the majority! Vote Obama….but always remember that politicians like entitlement programs are voted in by the majority but paid by the few. We hold the strings to the money. Come and get more of my, just try!

 Barack who? 

We have learned more about Sarah Pailin in a couple of weeks than about Obama in years and despite the supposed scrutiny typical of such a high profile campaign, I did not get all the answers I wanted and I am still wondering who is Senator Obama. Sure, I could use his own biographies to figure out what he is made of, but talk about possible bias and re-written history! He is a politician and I have to assume that as a good and successful politician, he is good at distorting reality and truth to fit his needs.

Also, the mainstream media is obviously so much in love with the phenomenon that investigative journalism has been turned into a thing of the past, replaced by shameless adulation and promotion of the new“Messiah”.

So here I am, a couple of weeks before the elections, still wondering who on earth Barack Obama really is and resorting to known facts, pretty safe allegations and other fact based hypothesis to frame the character of the guy that does not want to be judged by his race while playing all the cards available, race included. That is why he has maybe escaped the traditional treatment of traditional politicians. To question Obama, criticize him, and wonder about his past actions or associations, one must be a racist, right? After all, isn’t he“the one we have been waiting for?”So maybe before asking such disturbing and troubling things, just maybe, one should ask himself if it is only because Obama is black.

So I did….Eric, is it because Obama is Black? And I honestly replied to myself: nope!

 It is because Obama passes for a saint, a straight arrow, a poor for the poor, a multicultural icon because he is multicultural and other bull I forgot. Also because he is full of himself and tries to convey that image of an anti-Washington knight in a white robe and on a white stallion. Finally it is because of race indeed, because only Democrats and Black civil right activists can talk about him, question affirmative action or call him the N words, unpunished. When other people question him, the outrage and the immediate sentence come: Racist. And I don’t want to be called a racist…so I won’t ask, right? Don’t ask, don’t tell…ask, deny!

It was the same thing when I questioned Hillary: male chauvinist pig! What about you guys: anti white geriatrics! I just want him known for what he is because he is a corrupt politician too! Just a new gifted one. Vote him in, but vote him knowing who he is and who’s puppet he is! Who has his hand all the way up, make him talk and move…Morgan, Countrywide, Freddie, Fanny, Goldman, Lawyers, Universities, Healthcare, old Washingtonites….

The few blogs I animated or visited lead me to look up some of the claims made by supporters of both parties. I started at Wikipedia and pulled the string, Goggling or Yahooing around, names and places, allegations and innuendos.

 

Here is what I found that could be interesting to ask the candidate of change with the audacity of hope and some fullness of himself (“I am the one we have been waiting for”and“We I am”)

 Obama: poor, rich or the fruit on entitlement and affirmative action? 

He attended the Occidental college in Los Angeles for two years (a small private coeducational liberal arts college, 6% African Americans, Tuitions not available online), Columbia (one year?, $32,000 a year) and Harvard from 1988 to 1991 ($55,000 a year), Ivy league places of higher education by excellence. How did he pay his way through that? Loans and grants? One needs money to borrow money…the mortgage debacle has proven it!)

 Obama: Poor for the poor? Rich backed up by the rich…for the poor? (really?) As corrupt as his DC peers? (maybe more?) 

His top ten donors by industry include lawyers and law firms (his peers), securities and investment (his historical piggy bank), Business services, Real Estate (a house is a right, not a privilege one must work his buns off for and pay for), Universities (Higher education is a right, not a privilege one must work his buns off for and pay for) and Health professional (Health care is a right not a responsibility). Interestingly also, is the fact that for a man of change that wants to separate himself from the business as usual his peers practice in DC, he has been cashing in big from various famous institutions such as Goldman Sachs, City Group, JP Morgan&amp;Chase, Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley. Do some of these names ring a bell/ What about Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac? In three years in the Senate, Barack ended up being the top senator benefiting from the two financial institutions largess. I quote:‘A review of Federal Election Commission records back to 1989 reveals Obama in his three complete years in the Senate is the second largest recipient of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae campaign contributions, behind only Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the powerful chairman of the Senate banking committee. Dodd was first elected to the Senate in 1980.”

 Obama: a bright young guy or a political back-alley smart cat? 

I quote:“2008 boosted Obama into the position of the most successful presidential fundraiser ever, in addition to this election&apos;s presumptive Democratic nominee…In November he&apos;ll face Republican John McCain, who has indicated he’ll accept public financing in the general election, while Obama has opted out of the system. He&apos;s the first major-party candidate since the system was created to decline taxpayers&apos; money for the general election.”

Since it has started, despite the FACT that his top contributors are big corporations, legend had it that small Internet donors made the bulk of the monies…that is exactly how many corporations including Freddie and Fanny have paid Obama….through small contributions from their employees! Genial!

Also remember that Freddie and Fanny were created by the Congressional Democrats and President Clinton (–known as government-sponsored entities or GSEs–) to make mortgages available to more people, even people who couldn&apos;t afford them! Yes….the same companies that McCain wanted to regulate and that Obama–that one- voted to support. Remember that–I quote-“Instead, Democrats in Congress have sought to preserve the quasi-governmental status of the mortgage giants, seeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as places to locate former top Democratic Party operatives, where they have earned millions in compensation, despite a continuing series of financial Enron-like scandals.”

Freddie and Fanny his big small donors!

 Obama: a man of change…advised and guided by the same old, same old guys he criticize? 

For a man of change targeting every day the way the old corrupt men and women do business in Washington, it is interesting to note that Barack has just hired these same men and woman he attacks to“groom”him, advise him and run his campaign.

Biden is one, of course, part of the very old Washingtonites, part of the problems Obama decries. Biden is such an old icon of D.C that each time Obama attacks McCain on how long he has served, not done anything, perpetuating the same culture of corruption, yada yada…I think of Biden, believe he is talking about his Veep.

 Rubin is another interesting fellow! Robert Rubin, is a former Clinton Treasury Secretary who has been touted as a possible appointee to a cabinet post for Senator Obama. Rubin is one of Obama&apos;s economic advisers. Under Clinton, he was the architect of the law that was promoted and passed to kill the regulations put in place on the financial institutions after the great depression (recently Bill Clinton, in a TV interview confessed that he was not so proud of that one). After that he went to support Enron and to work for Citigroup (Obama’s big donor) for $40 million a year to &quot;advise on strategy.&quot; 

 Paul Volker is another one. He was the financial economist for the Chase Manhattan bank until he joined the Treasury Department in 62. From 1969 to 1974 Mr. Volcker served as under-secretary of the treasury for international monetary affairs and his best achievement was his critical role in the collapse of the Bretton Woods System thanks to his decisions to drop the Gold Convertibility of the US dollar. Logically, after such a good move, he ended up Chairman of the Federal Reserve under Carter in 72. Under Reagan, he is credited for limiting the stagnation of the economy by increasing the inflation, thus leading the country to the serious recession of the early 1980s, which provided for the highest unemployment levels since the Great Depression. He is a member of the G30, an international group of financiers and supports Obama.

 James A. Johnson was in charge of digging out a suitable Vice President for Obama…Old time Democrat and presidential campaign operative (Mondale, Kerry), he naturally ended up helping out. But Johnson had some embarrassing corpses in his closet, and once exposed, was dumped by an Obama known for quickly severing gangrenous limbs for the safeguard of his message of change and integrity. Johnson got huge freebees from Countrywide (rings another bell?). He is also a board member of KBhome (interesting….they build homes!) and Golden Sachs (rings a bell?). From 85 to 90, he was a director at Lehman Brothers (rings a bell). From 1990 to 1998, he served as Johnson was chairman and chief executive officer of Fanny Mae (91-97), the quasi-public gig setup by leftists utopian and sponsored by greedy financial institutions organization to turn home ownership into a universal right, money or not, good credit or not!

 Franklin D. Raines basically took over from Johnson’s job at Fanny May and cashed in the same way selling utopia to suburbia. &quot;The first black man to head a Fortune 500 company.&quot; Has been in and out of Fannie Mae from 91 to 99 were he finally resumed his position as a CEO. In 2004, he took an early retirement and he is still investigated by the Feds for“alleged’accounting frauds such as setting up gimmicks to increase his bonuses (total: $50 million). He also got $3 million in favorable loans from Countrywide. Obama denies he is an advisor but it was reported twice in the Washington Post that he was without any denial by his campaign (July 16th and August 27th).

 Obama: tell me who your friends are and I will tell you who you are! 

Reverend Wright: Okay. Obama attended his sermons for 28 years, got married by the man, got his children baptized by him too. He sat there for hours but never realized what kind of Anti-American and black supremacist racist things were going on there. It took some talk radio shows to wake the Messiah up to the realities of the United Church of Christ! (“It is not the Wright I knew!”)

Paul Ayers: Ayers was one of these pathetic anarchists of the 1970ies. Lived underground, planted bombs, believing he was something else than an idiot. Anyways…Obama and Ayers both lived in the same hood for a while; both worked on political reforms (education) and served on the board of an anti-poverty group committees. Both often had lunch together, Ayers hosted a party for Barack’s first run to Senate, Close relationship? maybe not but one can argue that he maintained a working relationship with a known shady character. You judge, keeping in mind what would have happened to McCain if he had met once the Unabomber?. (“It is not the Ayers I knew!”)

James Johnson: see above (“It is not the Johnson I knew!”)

Raines: see above (“It is not the Raines I knew!”) 

Tony Rezko: Rezko is a typical American fundraiser, corrupted to the bone, he corrupts everything he touches, He is currently in jail and about to spill the bean about his dirty financial deals with Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich . He has helped make Obama and was his first contributor (Wikipedia:“The first ever political contributions to Obama were $300 from a lawyer, a $5,000 loan from a car dealer, and $2,000 from two food companies owned by Rezko.).In 19997, Obama helped Rezko get more than $14 million in taxpayer funds. From 2003, Rezko raised $14 million for Obama&apos;s U.S. Senate campaign. He threw parties, raised money and Obama has acknowledged that about $250,000 in current campaign contributions came from Rezko. In 2005 Rezko&apos;s wife and Obama purchased adjoining properties from the same sellers in the Kenwood District of Chicago. Obama’s had a house on it and he paid $1.65 million ($300,000 below the asking price!) (“It is not the Tony I knew!”)

The extreme left fringe of his party: Obama is mostly scary for the crazy extreme leftist minority groups he appeals to. He catered to them (anti war, global warming stances, pro green, anti-rich….) but never tried to rein them in when they went on a violent rampage to disrupt the Republican conventions. Cars were burnt, shops looted, delegates beat up,“conventioneers”all ages violently extracted from their buses, denied access to the convention, etc…Do you remember Obama calling his red storm troopers back, or criticizing them?

ACORN“The country&apos;s largest grassroots organization working for the empowerment of low and moderate income people”: The old friends. ACORN has endorsed Barack for president. Obama was forced into disclosing that he has paid ACORN $800,000 to register new voters. Interestingly, in his FEC disclosure, the payments were hidden as payments to a front group called Citizen Services Inc. for“advance work.”). Furthermore, Obama was the executive director of ACORN’s voter-registration branch in 1992 and he lead the voter registration program that helped elect Carol Moseley-Braun to the Senate that year. In 1993, Obama sued the state of Illinois for ACORN to implement the federal“Motor Voter”law, which the GOP governor of the time refused to implement because it would lead to voter’s fraud.

ACORN is also dedicated to democracy and a universal right to vote for everybody and everything, illegals, dead people and cartoon characters included. The organization is under investigation for nationwide voter’s fraud allegations and one guy came forward stating he registered 72 times for cash and cigarettes….Democracy in action people!

So what will you ask? Well, it is sort of disturbing that all these shady and corrupt characters, businesses, banks or groups, have made or are making Obama’s entourage. They are all making the news today, or have in the past and not for good deeds. What would that tell you about Obama’s judgment? You tell me. I think it is disturbing and I think we deserve clear answers and facts. Actually, and it is true, with such known even remote associations, I could not even apply for the Green card or the citizenship. But he can be your next Prez!

 Obama: the ultimate politician: a wind cone blowing with the wind! 

Who is Obama? A civil right lawyer for the lawyers, a taxpayer’s money pumping machine for special interest groups, an Illinois mobster groomed by the crooks for the crooks, the left wing socialist nut that appealed to the fringes of his party during the primaries, or the Middle Class conscious middle of the road social-conservative he has become since he won the nomination? He can certainly not pay everybody back. How is he going to be if or when he wins?

 Obama who? 

So go ahead….deny, deny, deny and believe that the new Messiah is innocent of all charges and has not done anything wrong, directly or by association. Claim that all his long term dark religious, political or lobby associations are not showing poor judgment and political opportunism but are merely accidents, glitches of his life. Believe if you want that he is by the poor and for the poor and that he will fix all the ills of the universe. Everything I talked to is public information and you just have to Google Obama + a name or a scandal to find tons of data, most of it from legit sources. Pull a string and it will lead you to all these things I have talked about. He might be your next President, so make the effort to go over the nicely polished and carefully crafted image and at least, try to debunk my claims. I Dare you!

The way I see him he is the fruit of affirmative action (but he somehow wants to reclaim the American dream according to his book when is the living proof the dream is still here and well!) He went through expensive college (note that Columbia still refuses to this day to release his records when we know everything about McCain in Annapolis!). He became a“civil right”lawyer, the attack dog fused by law firms or“civil right”organizations to milk the system, enforce social engineering, promote political and social correctness, make tons of money for entitlement programs based on taxpayer’s money. Groomed and trained in Illinois, synonym of corruption, he was made Senator with Rezko’s money and Ayers endorsement. Paid by financial institution, mortgage industry, Universities and health care lobbies, he has surrendered himself with the same exact people he runs his campaign criticizing: shady characters, lawyers, former CEOs of financial groups, mortgage institutions or other special lobbies and old politicians that have been there forever, some known for ruining the country a couple of time. Ultimate sleek political machine, he rebounds each time he his attacked, quickly severs exposed connections to crooks, and comes back all well dressed and well spoken telling us what we want to hear but riding the wave of the same people and special interests that are harming this country, and us.

Should we think of him as a polished and Harvard trained Sharpton or Jackson. Maybe! Look at his life, his achievements, his“civil right’crusades, his goals. Is he innocent, so different from the Washingtonian political machine he belongs to. No!

No past but a big future…You have been warned! So now, just go ahead with your social experiment, blindfolded and naïve. Vote Barack! Vote Goldman Sachs, Lehmans bro, Countrywide, Fanny and Freddie…vote corrupt CEOs and failed politicians in office. We need more milking of the few that paid taxes and more wealth redistribution and entitlements (“rights”) toward the majority of the American that believe that the government should provide them with everything.What on earth has happened to“Don’t ask yourself what the government can do for you, yada, yada…”and“I have a dream that one day my children would be recognized for the force of their character and not the color of yada, yada…”. Obama is all about the color and what the government–taxpayers- should do for you. So go ahead freeloaders, the majority! Vote Obama….but always remember that politicians like entitlement programs are voted in by the majority but paid by the few. We hold the strings to the money. Come and get more of my, just try!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is what I wrote last week to my President,“representatives“and other Senators… 

Madam, Sir
A quick common sense suggestion to get out of the impasse and get rid of the pork barrel laden plans setup to rewards bad behaviors from major financial institutions (that have their hands deep into the pockets of our past and current candidates to the presidency and many more of our elected officials) and irresponsible borrowers that have believed YOUR utopian idea that owning a house was a universal right and not the privilege of the hard working, hard saving, accountable few with the well deserved good credit that goes with responsible banking.  

Post depression regulations ruling banks and loaning industry were erased under President Clinton and many Federal, state and local attempts to regulate the lending industry after the crash of the dot.com were systematically ignored or defeated thanks to the amount of“protective”money spent by the financial institutions that primarily benefited from the“universal housing”dream that you have all preached at one time or another.  

There is not such a thing as a governmental bail out because the US government does not have any money….It can only print more, devaluating the national currency to the status of Monopoly game currency.  

America is a“free market”society and“free market”should regulate the matter. People will lose their over priced homes and foreclosures and auctions will allow others to acquire a cheaper dwelling. Banks will go bankrupt and other banks will grow. Lessons will be drawn at all levels and things will naturally even out.

Half of the American people pay taxes (unfortunately) and finance the country, the non tax payers, the free loaders, the illegals and other“undocumented”. Give a $5000 tax refund to every taxpayer in America instead of bailing out greedy corrupting machines that have collapsed our economy! 140 million taxpayers….$5000 each…do the Math!

If I put my $5000 in the bank, it creates liquidity, banks can invest or loan money. If I put it toward the new roof or the new car I need, it will create jobs and consumption, will re-circulate the money. If I put it toward an IRA or 401k, a college fund, or buy gold, it will consolidate investment, secure commodities.

This would be a win-win situations and taxpayers would be rewarded for being the good citizens they are, the economy would be re-energized and the bad bankers, loaners, buyers would learn from their failures. 

Still, at the end of the day, as a taxpayer, I demand a full investigation and public hearings and trials of all the people who have directly or indirectly milked the system or benefited from it. Politicians, Bankers, loaners, CEOs, board of directors, investors….assets should be seized and frozen, repossessed. Too many“smart”people rode the“house.com”wave and made tons of money knowing that it was all about a scam, inflated and artificial prices, entitlement,“housing affirmative action”. It is time to pay back! 

But what do I know? I just have an excellent credit score, bought my house the old fashion way after a lifetime of working and saving, know that equity loans must be paid back, know what I can afford, know what the real value of my house is and knew that the whole scheme was wrong. Today I know that people should stop whining“Katrina-like”, stop holding their hands out and blaming everybody else for their problems. I also know that I am done being financially and emotionally milked by the free loaders or the greedy of our society. I am done.

As a taxpayer that does the right thing every day, I am done. And I am also done with D.C or the State legislature. We, the taxpayers, are paying you. We might not put you to office–free loaders do that too- but we are the one paying you and for some reason we woke up to the reality: your are not really out there to watch out for our best interests. I wonder why so much mistrust? What is the approval rating of Congress again? Is it lower than that of a President considered by so many as the worst President ever? Get a clue! 

What is it going to take to stop the charade and take the lead, all of you in D.C? Leadership has nothing to do with winning a popularity context. Pleasing everybody is not leadership…might get one elected by the many and paid by the few, right, but that is it! Being elected does not make anybody a leader. Leadership means making the right choices, showing example and competence, staying in touch with its base, sometimes punishing but often loving, and watching out for the best interests of those under. What kind of a leader have you been lately? What kind of a leader are you? Did you cash in from Fanny Mae and Lehman bros? Should I bother and look it up? You tell us? You show us! 

This week, I am going to take my children -10 and 11 y.o- to the capital city of America. I think I will spend more time meditating with them on the war memorials covered with the names of people what knew the price to pay to make that country what it is than trying not to be sarcastic and cynical on the steps of the Congress, the gate of the White House, or the entrance of the Supreme court, institutions founded to serve and protect the people of America, provide checks and balance, institutions supposedly manned by people better than us dedicating to SERVING the country and not their self interests. What should I tell them? How politics should works or how it really works? What would you tell them? 

Nota: The taxpayer’s bailout plan was eventually voted and passed. Pork Barrel made its way through too and as long as our legislators could take our hand, they just ripped off the arm, Washingtonian politics at its best by self serving and self centered arrogant and power hungry ELECTED officials, both aisles included. The President and the two Presidential candidates approved and signed on, showing the audacity of continuity and the Mavericanism of status quo. $25 billion were also given to Ford and GM last week because the two automakers cannot compete in a market of fuel efficient cheap quality cars….mostly thanks to their rigid unions entrenched in the audacity of entitlement. For most Americans, it does not really matter because it is not THEIR money. For the 140 million tax payers, it just shows where we are heading: the many voting free loaders and self serving politicians are getting a stronger grip on our wallets and will milk us more in years to come. Nobody will try to fix the system and it will eventually run short of us (taxpayers), short of money. My trip to DC went well and the Capitol is already being prepared for the 2009 inauguration. Indeed, I was loudly cynical and sarcastic while walking the polished stones of the seats of the Executive, Legislative and Judicial powers of America. Indeed I was respectful in front of the war memorials. Freedom is not free and this country was built on sweat, blood, hard work, not on entitlement and freebies. How far and low have we gone…

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am done now…That pathetic“bailout”was the last rusty nail on my coffin of hope….hope of common sense, hope of some kind of decency and honesty in DC, hope in the three balancing branches of government, hope in two balancing parties…The audacity of my hopes has been shot down…your new messiah is as corrupt as the most corrupt of the old timers he criticizes and the old guard has lost its sparks. Voters are ignorant (did I mean stupid?), party-aligned and blind and deserve everything they get. The Government is bankrupt and printing money. As good American entities, Federal and State agencies run maxed out credit card, pass bonds (6 out of 10 Californians polled knew bonds must be re-payed), and borrow more than they can pay with bad credit….Does it reminds you of anything? Like the morons who bought huge expensive houses with bad credits, zero down or interest only , our Federal and State institutions are biting on more than they can chew and running us toward the cliff, the ultimate meltdown. Such a young country with so much potential! Too sad to see it go…from the Frontier spirit to universal affirmative action and entitlement….Way to go! 

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is Biden a new voice or same old Washingtonite professional profiteer? Has Obama cashed millions from Fanny Mae, Lehman bros and other ailing financial institutions before he started to point fingers at them? Is Obama running the same type of false misguiding old time politics ads as McCain? Who did it first? Who was there first, the chicken or the egg? Who was there first: political career or Obama? Has Obama preached a totally different way to the libs during the primaries and changed his positions on many things now that he is the nominee? Is Obama really connected to the poor and struggling or is he another filthy rich lefty politician? Is he or not a lawyer financed and backed up by lawyers? Does he spend more time at home with his kids than Pailin? Does his wife? Is he a better parent? Was he a better community organizer than she was a mayor or governor? Is he what he is because he says so? Is his only audacity his race and is only hope that Hispanics will vote a black guy as a Prez? Is he only going to be elected for the force of his character or for the skills of his campaign? Is he a frigging lying in your face politicians like the other one and at the end of the day, is he going to screw me and this country more or less than the other candidate!

The state found a genial solution to fix the budget: borrow from taxpayers! No kidding? Where else could the money come?

Income taxes: we pay! Taxes on businesses: we pay through lower wages, meager benefits, higher prices of the products, lower 401k matching plan, or unemployment when the businesses relocate! Bonds: we pay and our kids too! High price of education: we pay through taxes, lottery, high tuitions, volunteering, donations, purchase of stationary! High perks and salaries of the legislature, the prison guards, police officers, University staff, and other unionized special interests groups or redundant state workers manning obsolete systems in an inefficient, complicated and overcrowded organization: we pay! Special elections to promote the pet projects of the many special interest groups: we pay! Recall elections: we pay!“Regular”elections to vote on issues that are political suicide for lawmakers: we pay! Dot.com crash: we paid! Housing bubble that burst: we are paying! Sterile stem cell research: we pay! Demagogic“feel good”politically correct school curriculum: we pay by constantly scoring last of the nation! Lack of vocational school, lack of discipline,, lack of parenting: we pay with an increasing number of school drop outs! $15 billion in the hole: we will eventually foot the bill! $9 billion more for the prison health system: we will pay too! All this because they say living here is priceless….Tell you what: not anymore if you are a taxpayer!

Sarah Palin: a good choice? 

Mc Cain’s campaign stole Obama’s Thunder last Friday morning when announcing early morning that a complete unknown female governor had been picked as a Veep for the Republican ticket. What was supposed to be the day when every media outlet was to dissect“ZE Speech”by the MLT wannabee new Messiah, became the day for“Sarah who?”  

I thought that it was funny! Suddenly the convention of the Democrats was old news, and so was Obama’s performance in front of 84,000 people. Too bad.

I also predicted that she would make the news and magazine covers, kick the Obama couple out of the flood lights, and she did.




Finally, I explained why it was a grandiose idea unless….she had skeletons in her closet.

I was right…. (Am I not always right? J)…so right! 

The idea is grandiose because:

She is younger than Obama

She is“newer”than Obama

She is as cute as Michelle

Obama chose an old“Washingtonite”for VP, one of the people he criticizes for the problems, and McCain chose an unknown successful“Maverick”

McCain chose a woman, a mom, when Obama sent Billary back home, humiliated.

McCain chose a woman and the Obama campaign has to be really careful on how she is going to be treated (not to alienate voting women)

McCain chose a conservative mom

McCain chose a governor that stood for her state against oil companies and had them pay billions in taxes (Alaska is flooded with cash while most states are in the red)

McCain chose somebody who fought corruption in both parties, old politics and self serving“earmarks”

If the ticket wins, she will be the next Republican candidate to face Obama and Billary in 2012….but with four years experience as a VP 

The skeletons are popping up thx to our tabloidic media and audience:

“Trooper gate”: did she or not directly pressure her administration in order to get her brother in law fired?

Pregnant 17yo daughter: suddenly it is an issue (not political yet and thx Obama for wanting to keep kids out of the way)….obviously the poor 17yo won’t have the free pass other celebrities“a la Spears family”get! 

Husbands double decade old DUI.

Anything else? McCain campaign says it is all there is and they expected it! We shall see. 

So what do you think? Good choice or desperate political maneuvers? 

Also, what about the Democrats and democracy?

Nobody from any right wing fringe of the conservative/republican aisle has tried to derail the convention of the Democrats, attacked delegates and burnt and loot properties. You know: the gun and bible totting moron Obama dislikes!But the left and its Democratic values was again shown in action at the opening of the RNC…like usual…protesters, slogans, public disruptions, attacks on citizens and properties, disruption of a legit political process, etc, etc…It just reminded me that it is how it has always started with the world dictatorships of the left: intolerant brown shirts sturm troopers marching in the streets and imposing their Democratic views via violence and intimidation, the first steps to re=education or concentration camps! You guys must be so proud of your activists! Just keep it up and you will scare the American people away from your“tolerance”.

Our kids don&apos;t need any fancy strategy to enter active life and succeed. Nor are they all entitled to a high school or a college degree. There is a wise saying that states that some kids are born to write symphonies and some to carry the piano. It is up to our failing school system to get its act together and orient to vocational education the Middle school children that show a &quot;learning challenge&quot;. That would indeed put an end to the monetary scams run by our public and private institutions of &quot;higher learning&quot; that act more and more like loan providing banks than schools preparing youth for the challenges of life. Is it finally time to end the charade and shake a system that costs us more than half the total budget of the state ($50 billion for K12 + $10 billion for higher ed) and continuously shows poor results despite highly paid employees (salaries and perks) and tons of costly demagogic and self serving special education pet programs (the more special program a school has and the more money it gets)? The bad worker always looks for excuses while the good one looks for solutions. Let’s fix that thing!

Interest rates are at the lowest and realtors are reeling in the homebuyers they are luring into giving another shot at home ownership. I hope we have learned our lesson and stop loaning to people who cannot afford the payments. The concept might shock many but home ownership is not a right! It is the privilege for people, who saved all their lives, have a stable work history, have maintained a good credit and also generate an income that provides for every other household expense. As far as equity goes, I am tired of hearing that it is some kind of wealth and that billions of dollars of home equity have been lost. Home equity is only real money when one sells high. Beside that it is just plain virtual money, monopoly dollars. It is just an untapped potential value and should not be accessible. How can one seriously consider borrowing real money against virtual money? Well….that is what we have been doing for the past five years. Artificially, the home prices went high and people were made to believe that they could borrow against them. They did and are now stuck with high payments, in real money! Think!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Voting for race instead of ideas? 

There is a question going around in the news regarding a possible deep laying racism in white people. Basically, the media are asking themselves if white America is ready to elect a black president in 2008 and if many who are claiming support for Obama are actually unconsciously kidding themselves and will eventually cast a“white”vote when ballot time will come.  

The question is fair because indeed, racism and prejudice affect the way some people vote. Take a look at the African American community to illustrate my propos: it seems like as of today, about 90% of the African American voters polled will vote for Obama. Just remember the democratic primaries and it is the percentage that the black candidate has already obtained in many states…Is Racism preventing African Americans from voting for a lady in a Mao suit or an“old wrinkled white man”and is racism, above ideology, politics and agenda, steering so many toward a black only vote? Some high level black conservative have strangely enough already announced that they will support Obama against logics and political convictions….Again, is race a factor? At least, to stand up for the“Caucasian”side, I can make a case that racism is lesser there because a bigger percentile of White will vote for Obama compared to the percentage of blacks that will vote for a McCain. So here is the question again: is race a factor? Will African Americans vote for the color of a skin or for the force of a character? Will guilt ridden white voters vote for the color of a skin or the force of a character? Will race be the decisive factor? 

Why is America so obsessed with labels that it cannot go beyond the many prejudice and stereotyping of its self induced tabloid culture of diversity? Lieberman“Jewiness”was an issue when he ran for VP, and Romney’s“Mormonism”was also an issue. Add the sex of Billay and the race of Obama, the age of McCain and the“pastority”of Huckabee. Sharpton a moron, Gore a nerd that invented the Internet and Bill Clinton a perv. What is it with the obsession Americans have for labels? Maybe we should let People magazine vote for us….and MAYBE Paris Hilton should be a VP. After all, my governor is a celebrity from Hollywood and look at the good job he has done! (Sarcasm!)Tell you what….a confession….listen carefully and don’t repeat it because it is sort of embarrassing…”I have known forever that Hillary was female, Obama black, Romney Mormon and McCain white…”! Didn’t you notice too?

Now let’s get back to facts, agenda, platforms, ideas, you now, further behind the picture or the video, where it hurts your brain when you use it trying to figure out how bad you are going to get screwed next year depending on who will move to DC! 

 And before bashing me, just remember the wise words of somebody who knew better and stated that if it has to be about something, sex should be it: 

 “I am not holier than thou. I am not perfect by any means. But there are events in life that you learn from, and which remind you what this is really all about.” John Edwards from a speech on October 29, 2007

Georgia: Pathetic but typical story of abandonment.

Since its accession to independence in 1991, Georgia has been heavily courted by America that wanted to make it the foremost Eastern outpost of NATO. Georgia entered the Northern Atlantic alliance through the side door, the Partnership for Peace, and was supposed to be made a full member in 2009 despite a strong Russian opposition. Georgia really improved its state institutions since the so-called“Rose revolution”in 2003 and the young representative democracy has achieved high improvements in reaching the political, military, economic and humanitarian goals set by NATO and the European Union in order to be considered for a membership, especially as far as corruption was concerned.

Georgia is a fairly small country of 45,000 sq/miles (70,000 square kilometers) and about 5 million“Georgians”living in nine regions spread out between the Black Sea on the West and Azerbaijan on the East. Turkey and Armenia form its Southern border and Russia watch from the North. George Bush is the first American president to visit the country, stressing the importance it has for the West, NATO and the E.U. Since the beginning, the Western contribution to Georgia has mostly been a“Train and Equip”military assistance program and the help to build a pipeline to transport crude oil from Azerbaijan’s Caspian Sea oil fields to the Black sea, in direct competition with the quasi Russian and Iranian monopoly. Georgia has also been made to believe that it was benefiting from an unconditional support from the West–especially America- and has felt confident in ignoring and sometimes challenging Russia’s belligerent talks or active“bullying”. Georgia is the third force contributor of the“coalition of the willing”with 2000 soldiers manning check points in Baghdad and its“Green Zone”.

Despite the stabilization of the post“Rose Revolution”, Georgia had to deal with its secessionist states of Adjara (South West on Black Sea), South Ossetia (Russian border, North, center) and Abkhazia (North West, on the Black Sea). Eventually, Adjara quickly“dropped”its separatist agenda but the two other provinces, made of non Georgian ethnic minorities, found active help and support from a sympathetic Russian  “Big Brother”eager to step forward with a“peace keeping”military force and“protect”the separatist and pro-Russian province from the potential aggression of a“militarist and pro-Western”Georgia. Through the use of the legitimacy of the U.N. and the“manipulation”of OSCE observers, Russia has had the upper hand over the conflict since the early 1990ies when the separatists started the ethnic cleansing of Georgian from Abkhazia and when many South Ossetians left Georgia to Russian’s North Ossetia.

Since then, while Georgia was trying to become a model democracy worthy of integration to NATO, Russia has fueled the separatist movements of the provinces and escalated the provocations. The more involved the US and NATO, the more Russia sided with the two seceding provinces. Russia unilaterally created military bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, provided Russian passports to the local minorities, ordered its peacekeepers to use force to protect the province from Georgia, increased its peacekeeping force and eventually also backed up or engineered many destabilization operations, that is to say bombings or attacks against Georgian forces or assets. Russia set up consulates and bilateral defense agreements with the separatist governments and only stopped short to recognizing the independence of the provinces despite U.N, E.U and American appeals for a peaceful path to a referendum or other democratic solution.

In the meantime, maybe emboldened by what was perceived as a strong American backup and European concern, Georgia have stepped up to the plate and matched every Russian moves with confidence and aggressively while developing and modernizing it’s military. Georgia has also forcibly responded to every single provocation in the field or diplomatically to any Russian controversial declaration. Of course, both sides were pointing the finger at each other in a skillful blaming game that has confused the U.N and European observers since the beginning of the crisis. 2007 saw a tale telling escalation that culminated a couple of days ago when Georgian troops entered in strength in South Ossetia to submit its capital and get rid of its separatist movement while the whole world was focused on the Olympics. Since April 2008, the situation has seriously deteriorated in the field with many air space violations from both sides (unmanned surveillance Drones from Georgia and Russian fighters), terrorist like attacks against Georgians or separatists, Russian military buildup in the separatist province of Abkhazia, bombings, clashes, mortar and artillery exchanges in South Ossetia and a spying allegation made by Russia. Eventually, throughout July 2008, bombings and military clashes affected all sides while tensions rose to a boiling point with saber rattling declaration from all the parties. Finally in August 2008, Georgian soldiers backed up with tanks, artillery and airplanes invaded South Ossetia and its capital and started a direct Russian military intervention that has involved heavy bombings of Georgian troops and targets both in South Ossetia and Georgia, the landing of fresh troops in Abkhazia and the locking of its Black Sea ports and accesses, and the declaration that the Russians will only stop once the Georgian government has been toppled and its armies defeated.

Putin left the Olympics and China right away and was seen the very next day, close to the front line talking to its generals while the West and the UN released diplomatic notes and sent more observers. In the meantime, President Bush attended Beach Ball trainings and was offered to slap the cute bottom cheek of a Miss Misty something, showing Georgia that there is a difference between talks and actions. The President would have flown to DC right away it would have sent another kind of message to Moscow! But what do I know?

I can only remember…

I remember Poland in World War 2 and how the Western powers abandoned it to its fate despite multilateral defense agreements.

The West Germans during the cold war, asking France to move non-NATO military units in Germany because they were not sure of the American commitment to die in a nuclear winter against the Red Army in order to preserve Western Europe. France was–and is- an independent nuclear power with more at stake at the time. To defend France, France would have to defend Germany, eventually with its own nuclear weapons! The Germans skillfully bet on France too!

I remember the Kurds and the Shiites during the first Gulf War…They were encouraged to open a Northern and Eastern front in Iraq to distract Saddam’s armies, and led to believe that the dictator and its Presidential Guard would be dealt with. The invasion stopped short of Baghdad for short term political reasons and the Kurds and Shiites were left to die in the hands of the Presidential Guard we conveniently allowed to move around to facilitate their punitive tasks.

I remember the death of Tito and the splitting of Yugoslavia with Croatia running for its independence, soon unilaterally recognized by Germany (a WW2 ally!) despite international calls for caution. That is when the war started with the Serbian majority trying to cement the now collapsing country with blood and bullets.

Georgia has just learned the hard way that there is not such a thing a partnership or agreement when you are small and when the invader is Russia.

The West just realized–hopefully- that Russia is not an ally, will never be and has its own agenda in its zone of influence.

America, hopefully, will get the message that one cannot go around meddling in other people’s strategic playground without eventually stirring the pot and generating new crisis….The path to hell is paved with good intentions but obviously, ignoring the Russian reservations for so many years while building a NATO outpost at its direct Southern border and threatening its oil business was not a good idea….and the price for that is going to be huge in blood and long in civil wars.

Hopefully, European nations that have disarmed since the collapse of the Russian Empire and buried the“cold war”for more social programs will get to their senses and finally realize that there is still a giant aggressive military power in Eastern Europe. It is well armed, holds the controls for oil and natural gas supplies, and is switching back to a semi-dictatorship status.

Finally, a new conflict has started in Eastern Europe and world observers will again judge the international community for its actions. The US will also be judged for its inactions and Putin has shown for now that he has the upper hand and that there is not much that the US can do for its poor ally….beside maybe shipping back the 2000 Georgian combat ready troops from Iraq right into the battlefield before Georgia becomes again another Russian puppet government.

                                                                            Good luck Georgia!

                                                                             ----------------------

It has been two days since I have written the article above, and five since the beginning of the conflict. Today, August 12, Russia has announced the end of the hostilities against Georgia stating that the aggressor had been punished, that its armed forces had suffered a terrible blow, and that the Russian citizens and peacekeepers in the seceding provinces are now safe.

Ironically, one of the main excuse for the Russian intervention was the Russian constitution mandated demand for the protection of Russian nationals at home and abroad…and we know that Russia had unilaterally taken steps to recognize the legitimacy of the separatist regions and has issued its citizens Russian passport. When Georgia made the unthinkable mistake of using force to retake South Ossetia, the Russian government had a constitutional excuse to move in, on top of the official need for protection for its so-called peacekeepers.

In the meantime, France took the lead with its foreign minister landing in the war zone right away and the French president meeting with European leaders and disclosing his plan to meet with the Russian president before actually flying into Georgia.

President Bush just came back while Mrs. Rice sent a“nobody”from her department to the Georgian capital, and the charade has finally ended with a strong military and diplomatic Russian victory!

De facto, Russia now owns the separatist provinces and Georgia can write them off. Russia also sent a clear message to its former republics: don’t mess up with us and don’t trust the good words of the West.

The message to the West and NATO is even stronger: don’t interfere with MY business in MY backyard. Russia has been made a fool for too long and Russia is finally back, oil rich, standing and kicking, maybe not as a world power anymore but as the regional undisputable power.

In a few chosen words, Russia basically told America, the U.N, the E.U and the rest of the world: blah blah blah….what are you going to do about it?

Interestingly, Russia stopped short of taking over Georgia and installing a puppet regime there….(darn…I lost a bet and it is going to cost me lunch!). For some reason, it looks like the Bear has just flexed its new muscles but is still eager to keep its options open regarding Europe (its customer for oil), the U.N and the G8 (used to be G7: seven industrialized nations. Became 8 with Russian addition.

America is going to push for a quicker access to the NATO membership for Georgia….and what? Would the West ever go to war against Russia for Georgia, or Latvia? Not a chance! Russia made sure that the whole world knows it…

So what are we going to do for now to safeguard emerging democracies in the Russian strategic area of interest? I think a post war Berlin-like setup could work. Maybe we should permanently position a symbolic multinational force in each of these countries. A military aggression against the country would mean international casualties, an act of war against all the represented countries. The deterrence worked well during the Cold War and could work again. Furthermore, I do believe that if the West would have followed the French foreign minister’s example and flown high level diplomats to the war zone, Russia would have stopped its military operations for fear of damaging collateral damages such as the death of a well known political figure. Instead, we sat on our thumbs and made strong declarations…

Finally, we need to be cautious and take our time to make sure that we don’t directly threaten Russia and its strategic interests, nor embolden our partners into making a foolish military statement. We did not like it when the USSR tried to make Cuba, right in our backyard, an outpost of communism and a nuclear launch pad. Well…think about it…Half a century later we are trying to set a NATO military outpost and an Anti-Russian Defense missile system right at Russia’s Southern border….and we hope it will work!

What are we thinking?

 The 2008 French White Book on Defense and Homeland Security.   

 The French government has just released its 2008 White Book on defense and homeland security, the first extensive official French threat assessment and forces reorganization plan since 1994. The book was commissioned in July 2007 by President Sarkozy and the extensive reforms it details are the result of no less than 40 audits involving 52 personalities from 14 different nations. Senior officers of the French Armed Forces, representatives of every French political party, CEOs, European politicians, journalists, representatives of the major religions, and respected“strategists”took part in the debates that are fully reported in the second volume of the document.     

 It would be difficult to cover the wide ranging reforms in detail, as the thousand or so pages of the two volumes are heavy reading, even in English. However, this paper presents the gist of the recommendations and presents some of the reactions.   

 For the first time the White Book has addressed French security concerns globally without limiting them to defense or military issues. It redefines a National Security Strategy involving the implementation of a defense policy, a Domestic Security Policy (global domestic security), a Civil Security Policy (security of individuals, civil order), and also, to a certain extent, a Foreign and an Economic Policy.    

 Because the world has undergone deep changes since 1994, new threats have emerged and called for reorganization. The White Book details how“globalization”has given birth to a faster exchange of information, goods, and people that have both positively and negatively impacted the international and domestic, economic, social, and politic environments. It lists what it describes as the European continent’s“direct vulnerabilities”to terrorism and to weaponry such as ballistic missiles being developed by emerging powers such as Iran. It also lists new threats such as possible crises in Asia; medical, sanitary, or ecological disasters; mass migrations of people; and cyber attacks. It presents a strategic analysis covering the next 15 years. 

 The results of that analysis define the 2008 National Security Strategy built around five combined strategic functions that defense and security forces must master. These functions are: Knowledge and Anticipation, Protection, Prevention, Intervention, and finally, Deterrence.  Knowledge and Anticipation: Intelligence is described as most critical since it provides the first line of defense in preserving France’s strategic initiative. It is anticipated that Intelligence will be obtained via a wide spectrum of new and modernized media such as ballistic missile launch-detection, early warning surveillance satellites, and radars. This national missile defense system might become the first component of a more global European initiative. The role of unmanned aerial vehicles will be increased (UAV) to complement traditional air combat equipment. Signal intelligence assets will be extended to space (CERES satellite program). New all-weather all-time satellites will replace the current Helios imagery systems (MUSIS program). The whole array of satellites will fall under a new Joint Spatial Command under the control of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. An intelligence academy will also be created.                 

 Protection:  New threats such as terrorism stress the need to refocus on the domestic protection of the population and of the national territory. France needs to be protected from major disasters and its resilience needs to be nurtured. In this case, the document describes the term“protection”as“the capability for the public administrations and civilian population to react to a major crisis and quickly restore normal processes.”To achieve these goals, the White Book recommends adapting the current and future intelligence gathering network to domestic intelligence needs, the development of a better response capability from the various public administrations, the implementation of a national alert and information network, and stronger cooperation between the military and the civil security organisms. Twelve sectors of national vital activities have been defined and will be the focus of special protective measures that France would like to promote at the European level for a more global approach (energy, food supply, water management…). Finally, defense against cyber war, the possible hacking of communication and computer networks, has been made a priority; offensive and defensive technologies and systems will be developed to protect France’s information systems.   

 Prevention:  The White Book recommends concentrating conflict prevention capabilities and possible intervention to a vast geographical area of critical strategic importance for both France and Europe. Roughly contained between the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, this wide zone of interest includes Asia, which has become increasingly important to the world’s security. France will also revise its defense agreements with its African partners and shift them toward a new European/African partnership for peace and security while keeping all its options open for prevention and/or action along the occidental and oriental coasts of Africa, the Sahel region included in-between. France will also maintain a significant military presence in the Antilles-Guyana area, mainly to benefit its space facilities at Kourou.   

 Intervention: The White Book provides a variety of scenarios regarding the use of the military. It defines three major types of intervention: military domestic operations, military operations (abroad), and joint military and civil operations abroad. Domestic military operations would be exceptional and limited to such national emergencies as natural or technological disasters or major terrorist attack. The military forces would be required to support and/or complement other public or civilian agencies. Military operations would most likely be conducted abroad and fall into two major categories: stabilization operations (1000 to 5000 men plus support) and high intensity operations. Stabilization and high intensity operations are not mutually exclusive and one could precede or follow the other. Joint military and civil operations may also precede, complement, or complete military operations, especially in a reconstruction or a“peace consolidation”phase. France recognizes the predominant role of the United Nations but also deplores the lack of coordination among its components. The paper stresses a new concept: international military operations must be followed by international civil operations! It is all about a“Crisis Exit Strategy”that requires the full involvement and tight collaboration of civilian specialists, such as administrators, economists, magistrates, financial and legal counsels, who are left behind to support emerging local political institutions, manage international aid, and assist in economic development. 

 Deterrence: Nuclear deterrence will remain the cornerstone of France’s national strategy and its role as the ultimate guarantor of the national security and independence is stressed again in the newly released document. France defines it nuclear deterrence as a unique tool to prevent aggression by a foreign state against the vital interests of the country. To face emerging threats and to maintain its credibility, France will upgrade its two nuclear components composed of ballistic and airborne missiles. The White Book provides for the development of four to six new stealth nuclear attack submarines capable of carrying and launching new long range cruise missiles. These high precision missiles will also be compatible with other naval and airborne assets. At the same time, France pledges that it will take an active role in proposing and supporting nuclear disarmament and anti-proliferation measures. 

 The White Book also reiterates France’s commitment to the European Union and to NATO. It proposes steps for the European Union to finally become a major international player when it comes to managing international security crises. These steps include the creation of a global permanent European intervention force of 60,000 and the development of a European planning and command structure for military and civil operations. The paper also calls for four critical actions aiming at the security and protection of European citizens (cooperation against terrorism and organized crime, implementation of European civil protection assets, coordination against cyber war and protection of the energy grid and strategic supplies) and for the redaction of a“European White Book on Defense and Security.”   

 NATO is turning sixty years old and since the early 1990, Europe and the alliance have undergone many major changes. France sees a need for a renovation of the alliance and will seek a new balance between the American and the European influence within the organization. France sees both the European Union and NATO as complimentary and is committed to fully participate in the alliance as long as its nuclear forces remain independent and no French military force is placed under permanent peacetime NATO command.      

 Again, there, France underlines principles expressed by General de Gaulle: France is and shall remain independent, preserve its freedoms of analysis and decision. That concept is also reflected in a new approach to the military industry.   

 No European country can master, develop, and maintain the defense related technological capabilities necessary for total independence. France will focus on the“first industrial strategic circle,”on domains that are critical to its strategic and political autonomy–nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, nuclear attack submarines, Information systems security - and will give the European market, the“second circle,”top priority for other military equipment–aircraft, UAVs, cruise missiles, electronics. The remaining exterior world would become a“third circle.”   

 To achieve these revolutionary goals, the government intends to begin with a wave of restructuration that will involve the dissolution or relocation of major units and the laying off of about 54,000 defense personnel or employees. The relocated units will be regrouped by affinity to maximize their efficiency and support. The money saved by these measures will be entirely funneled toward new equipment. All together, by the year 2020, the government is planning to spend $580 billion toward the defense effort (377 billion Euros). Furthermore, while obsolete or redundant agencies will disappear, new ones will flourish from the top level of the French government down: Defense and Homeland Security Council, National Intelligence Council, Information Systems Security Agency, Inter-ministry Committee for the Coordination of the Defense against NBC Threats, Inter-Ministry Center for Crisis Management, European Center for Civil Protection, Space Joint Command, Defense Financial Committee, Intelligence Academy, Mixed (Civil and Military) NBC Training Center, etc. The White Book stresses the need for highly professional soldiers, the extensive use of the traditional reserve, as well as the“enlistment’in the active reserve of highly qualified civilian human resources (reservists will be able to serve up to 200 active days a year), and the adhesion of the nation to the new National Security Strategy. It also addresses the opportunity for a voluntary“Civic Service”for young adults.   

 In raw numbers, the future French Army would be composed of an operational force 88,000 strong and almost as many support personnel. This Ground Operational Force (FOT: Force Operationnelle Terrestre) would be able to simultaneously deploy and support a 30,000 men force over six months, while maintaining 5000 personnel on permanent alert and dispatching 10,000 to intervene in a major domestic disaster. By 2020, that army will be completed with about 650 new armored combat infantry vehicles (VCBI), 25,000 new“digitized”infantry combat systems“Felins”, some 200 IED proof vehicles, and single rocket launchers to comply with the ban on cluster bombs. The Air Force will manage both Air Force and Navy aircraft and the total combat fleet of 300 will be entirely made of Rafale and upgraded Mirage 2000.   

 On top of its new Nuclear Submarines, the Navy will also be outfitted with four new“Projection and Command”frigates (Mistral type) and 18 intervention frigates. Satellites, UAVs, Offensive and defensive cyber warfare systems, missile defense systems and other Intelligence assets will provide the government and its forces with the information necessary to guarantee France’s independence within Europe and NATO.   

 President Sarkozy disclosed the White Book June 17 2008. The next day, a group of senior officers, signing the name of a famous French corsair“Surcouf,”wrote anonymously to a major paper and sharply criticized the plan, describing it as“amateurish”and saying that it literally abandoned European military predominance to Great Britain. Other general officers also came public and said that while the US and British have learned with blood that ground components should be increased, France was shamefully going the opposite way. If everybody seems to agree with the geopolitical assessment and the future threats to France, it seems that the emerging debate is concerned with the future. While the White Book does not provide funding prior to 2012, it does propose immediate major money- saving measures that would directly affect the forces. Around 400 military bases are going to be closed or moved in the biggest consolidation project ever and about 54,000 defense jobs are going to be lost. Experience has often shown that the geographical relocation of bases often ends up costing more than it saves. Experience has also shown that politicians have always had a tendency to cut military positions and preserve unionized civilian defense positions. The French army’s nickname is“The great mute”because it has always endured critics or cost-cutting reforms silently while other state employees have taken it to the streets with large and long lasting union backed demonstrations and strikes (teachers, transportation, power companies).    

 The question today is about how operational the French military forces are going to be in the next few years while enduring a huge geographical and structural reorganization and losing tens of thousands of personnel. French forces are still heavily committed in Africa, the Middle East, former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan and also must be ready to quickly react to any new international or domestic crisis. 

 Politics and economics are also at play now that the reform plan is out there. Local officials who see their cities or districts directly affected by the loss of a lucrative military base (average of 800 personnel and dependants per base) are bringing it up to Paris and strings are currently being pulled by power players trying to preserve what they have, or trying to get more. For now, the debate has changed and until the list of the 400“dissolved”or displaced garrisons has been finalized, it is not going to be about soldiers, equipment, alliance, strategy or defense but about politics, regional economy and money.   

 “You French only fight over money…we fight for honor!”said the defeated British officer to a bunch of French Corsairs. 

 “People always fight for what they lack!”replied Surcouf.    

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am already done with the presidential race.

Both camps are resorting to stupid TV advertising to cater to their stupid bases of ignoramuses while pointing fingers at each other for running a“negative campaign”. I was expecting, hoping for a better debate!

It is far too early for this junk to start and I am done already. YOU, people, will get the President YOU DESERVE! Not the best one or the one you voted for (for half of you)….just the one you deserve.

As far as I see it today, both candidates are incredibly neck to neck despite totally different agenda and media appeal. Think of it: while the“Kennedy to be”was attracting up to 250,000 Germans at a monument dedicated to Prussian military supremacy, the other one was visiting a German grocery store in the middle of nowhere, America. Still, Americans are still divided and undecided between the old guy that look and feel like other we have had and a new guy with a noisy and well orchestrated media machine but little to offer beside radical“changes of heart.”

Again, I would have not closely followed the Democrat party’s primary, I could have liked OBObama (Or Best Offer Bama) for what he says he stands for…but I did follow the fight between is camp and the Clintonites, heard what he had to say and ran from his crazy liberal agenda….until he won and became more of a conservative (pro guns, death penalty, more gov power for Domestic spying, business exoneration for cooperating with gov, off shore drilling despite what his base and liberal congress says…). 

Who is OBObama? We still don’t know! No resume, a change of mind every two seconds (campaign funding, town hall meetings, support and dump his embarrassing friends and relations, supports and dump his ultra liberal base now that nomination is granted, support and dump anti-oil drilling concept and crowd…), a messianic icon pushed down our throats by the enamored media, a guy largely financed by the same despicable good old businesses he criticizes.

Is he just one of these professional politicians, one of these guys blowing with the wind like the“wind cones”I mention so often on these blogs: colorful, empty, blowing with the wind?

How can he, with a straight face, go around and tell us today that offshore drilling is part of the solution to become energy independent within 10 years, when he had, along with his base and other Arnold and Pelosi’s, argued before that it was not even part of a solution? How can he gather a crowd of believer today and get incensed and applauded after saying he believes in“Red”, when a week ago he got the same results saying“Blue”?

He is just another of these cynical“Washingtonites”he denounces every day“as part of the problem”. After all, the successful politicians“a la senator Kennedy”all started young and had to do whatever it takes one day to get the long lasting position they have held for so long! That is why, maybe, they spend millions for a job that only pays a couple of $100k a year! J

Mc Cain…kind of old….kind of reassuring when listening to the crazy leftist agenda. Sure, he goes slow, fumbles around and looks and feels like the good old familiar establishment…he does not show any audacity but for now, for sure, he seems to carry the hope of 44% of the voters! Will he be elected to defeat arrogance and extreme audacity? Will he be elected by people frightened by a media made phenomenon?

Why is OBObama still dragging in the polls? Is it really because of Mc Cain’s“negative campaign”or just because he is too much, all over the place and full of himself?

Finally, I cannot even believe that the“race card”is also suddenly becoming an issue when I honestly think that nobody really cares about it. I mean, Mc Cain is often referred as our typical American old white politician, from the political establishment! Did you notice that he was white? In the meantime, the Clintons were the one who brought race in the race ( http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-01-24-sc-bill-clinton_N.htm  ), and Jackson the one saying OBObama was“acting White”(  http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/09/19/jackson.jena6/index.html  ) or using the“n”word when referring to him ( http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/16/jackson.nword.ap/index.html ). His wife is the one who stated that the country had done nothing that made her proud of and in 2007 Sharpton said that“&quot;just because you&apos;re our color doesn&apos;t make you our kind.&quot; (  http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003566724_blacksummit11.html?referrer=digg   ).

Today, Mc Cain is pointed out t as the racist because he compared OBObama as a tabloidic celebrity loved by the media…Bringing the race card against Mc Cain, and us, white voters, is not a good idea for one simple reason: The Republican campaign has not (yet?) talked about race and only Democrats and black activists have so far been guilty of doing it. Would Mc Cain get a free pass for repeating Bill Clinton’s statements or calling OBObam a“N”or threatening to“cut his nuts”(Jackson again!)? I doubt it! That would be political suicide.

Tell you what, all of you the thin skinned professional victims and hypocrites: you don’t have to remind us! It has been more than a year that OBObama has been“groomed”for the job! We have noticed that he is black…don’t insult our intelligence and trust us….and trust us when I say we don’t really care…and trust us when I say that if he makes it an issue and starts hinting that he might not get elected because we are racists, that will do it…piss us off…and he won’t be elected!

He will be judged like MC Cain, the old white guy, for the force of is character, his agenda and his flip flopping, not for the color of his skin. Amen! 

For readers who don’t master English, even as a second language:

This blog talks about:

Presidential race

McCain and Obama 44% each despite what the media does

Obama flip flops too often

McCain“reassuring”because conventional old white guy

Racists: Democrats and black activists are racist!

Sanctuary cities…Are heart bleeding liberals going to learn? 

Sanctuaries for illegal immigrants were created in the seventies by priests who sheltered South American aliens running away from civil wars or dictatorships.

Churches were turned into“sanctuaries”and their occupants protected from the police, immigration enforcement and American laws.

Later whole cities became sanctuaries and started to break the state and federal laws they are supposed to enforce.

San Francisco has been one of them since 1989 and its extreme liberal drunk play-boy turned mayor has just been forced to put an end to the madness after the city fell under the media radars for its crazyness.
 

Prior to a triple murder that has exposed the ill placed pride the city establishment has put into providing haven to illegal immigrants, things were going smoothly for the wackos of the bay:

·        City employees are requested not to ask about any immigration status and demanded not to volunteer resources or assistance to federal enforcement agencies

·        $83,000 were spent early this year to inform illegals that the city was open to them.

·        Illegal immigrants convicted of small crimes were not turned to the authorities but sent to remote facilities in San Bernardino for some re-eductation.

·        Illegal immigrants were also flown back to their country of origin at taxpayer’s expense. 

Not long ago, in the city of the bums, a whole family was coming back from a picnic when their car ended up in the way of a well known gang member from El Salvador. The father and two sons were shot on the spot.

The gang banger was arrested and is awaiting sentence. In the meantime, his criminal history has surfaced (felony weapon charges, gang activities, multiple arrests but no convictions)) and also the fact that the crimes should have never been committed because the city should have turned him to the federal authorities the first time he was arrested. 

San Bernardino county officials also complained when they discovered that San Franfreako recently sent juvenile Honduran crack dealers to group homes in their city of Yucaipa and that half a dozen of them just walked out, back to the streets where crime has been steadily increasing. 

Ideology over public safety to the rising displeasure of the city: 79% of the polls show that residents want laws to be enforced.

Mayor Newsom made a recent about face against these policies after they had been exposed. But that might be because he has a gubernatorial agenda and does not need to support the crazy liberal agenda of the city elites anymore. Furthermore, the city is about $350 millions in the hole and taxpayers are starting to scrutinize the millions that are spent in the crazy Sanctuary agenda such as the $3 million future city ID card program for illegals without US identifications. They should also take advantage of the many city benefits, shouldn’t they? 

When is the federal government going to raid these places and jail these city, county and state workers that are breaking the laws based on ideology instead of living by them and enforcing them. Isn’t it why taxpayers elect them and/or pay them? What about no religion NOR ideology in public places….the Law, just the Law!

Laws of the country versus Illegal immigration

Government role to enforce the laws and not make them out…at every level

When good intention turn really bad

The path to hell is paved with the best intentions

Criminals not given to the Feds….but“deported”in somebody else’s backyard

No accord on High speed rail, July 15, sacbee

Our adored legislature crafted a 10 billion rail bond in 2002, pushed it off the ballot in 2004 and 2006 and just discovered July 14th that it needs an amendment before July 15th to qualify, the day Senate took off!. Last year, Mehdi Morshed, director of the High Speed Rail Authority, went public after his budget was cut to $14 million from $103 million. He stated: &quot;There&apos;s really no public purpose for me and my staff to be in the office unless you want to move forward with the project. If you don&apos;t want (…) then close it down and save yourself some money.&quot; In 2007 it was also said that the rail bond would likely be shelved anyways to facilitate the passage of a 2008 $30 billion bond dedicated to union-protected pet projects. Nothing new! Business as usual in California: the budget is late, senate is off, and the bullet train killed again. In the meantime the wasteful charade continues and we are supposed to pay to keep that thing alive. I am so disgusted with our elected officials that I cannot type anymore. July 14th, Bastille day! Let’s build one and lock all these crooks up….freedom at last! 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 I love it when the rich and the famous -- Al Gore, Gov. Schwarzenegger, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and other celebrities -- tell us that they won&apos;t even consider offshore drilling while fueling their private jets. How dare we, the stupid commoners, push for nuclear power or the offshore drilling of our untapped resources? That would most likely ruin the picture-perfect ocean sceneries they enjoy from the bay windows of their exclusive beach.
I wonder where were these environmental concerns when they started to privatize so much of our coastlines. Basically, they oppose the drilling because &quot;it is not a quick fix,&quot; not because it is not a solution, and of course, they have yet to come up with any fix! It is like them trying to persuade us not to invest more into some cancer research because it could take up to five years to show some beneficial results.
Finally, they are referring to a one and only catastrophe that happened 40 years ago. Do you think that we might have the technology to do a better job today? What about the other platforms that have been pumping nonstop for 40 years without leaking? Think!

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ooooops…The State of California just overspent its 2006-2007 $107 billion budget by $4 billion. Now you understand why we are somewhere between ten to twenty billion in the red, owe tons of borrowed money and have a credit rating down the gutter. Irresponsible legislators and movie actors turned“Gobernator”just flushed down the toilet the lifetime salary of 2000 average Californian households, did not say“I am sorry”and went on with their dysfunctional life at the capitol: budget is late as usual, deficit is structural and booming, special interest groups have their hands in every pockets, and bonds or tax increases can always solve the problems. The average Californian household earns around $50.000/year and will work for about forty years. That totals around $2 million. Time it by 2000 households and you will get your $4 billion waste. Way to go…we overpay a bunch of self serving irresponsible politicians to run the government via referendums, waste our money, borrow like maniacs and tax us more instead of fixing the problems. Remember: there is no crisis as long as you have taxpayers. Keep on milking us!

California is on fire thanks to the tree huggers! 

We just got a health warning because of the smoke from 1200 wildfires, and the State Air Resources Board voices its goal of slashing emissions by 30 percents by 2020. The scheme is based on increasing utility bills and on blackmailing businesses. Often, in the morning, when my kids fight over the newspaper’s weather page, I tell them to look outside. Look at that smoke!

Every year, wild fires destroy millions of oxygen generating trees because some believe in the unconditional protection of the forests. As a result, sanctuaries are not regularly cleaned; fuel packs up below the trees, waiting for the right spark that will turn everything to ashes before the erosion of the charred sterile soil begins. It is not nuclear science: trees transform carbon in oxygen while fires generate smoke and carbon; eventually, rotting dead trees will also release carbon. The board should focus on fire prevention and forest maintenance and protection. Human activities and fuel fossil burning have historically been presented as the main responsible for the Green house effect that causes Global warming. Last year, the fires in San Diego released in one week 25% of the CO2 that the whole of California releases in one month. In 2002, 7 million acres of forest burnt to the ground and in 1997, the Indonesian fires were credited for the tens of thousands of tons of CO2 that made that particular year the worst ever in co2 emission. While we point fingers at fossil fuel for Global Warming, we conveniently avoid talking about these wildfires that have become more destructive than ever in human history because of the laws put in place to protect our forests: no logging, no cleaning, no access at all in sanctuaries, fuel amassing on the ground…These restrictions have caused more damages ever and for the first time in century, fire resistant forest have burn to the ground, literally gone in smoke.

It is easy to remember, and so logical:

Burning forest in America release about 10 tons km-2 of CO2 annually.

Burnt trees stop processing carbon.

Dead biomass (dead trees and plants) rot and release more CO2

The whole cycle releases as much CO2–if not more- as fossil fuel burning.

Extra C02 increases the Green House effect.

Increase of the Green House effect increases the dryness of our forest.

Extra dry forest–whatever is left- burn just looking at it. 

CO2 emissions from wildfires are predicted to increase by 50% by the year 2050…Where will your children be?

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wildfires and Greenhouse effect: a vicious circle. 

Officially, fossil fuel burning and other human activities cause Global Warming. But it has been conveniently omitted by the SUV-bashing tree-huggers that CO2 is also generated when wood products are burned. Just look through your window! Actually, the amount of atmospheric damages due to fuel burning is similar to the effect of plant matter burning (Lindesay et al., 1996). In 2002, seven million acres of forest went in smoke (NIFC, 2003). That is seven million acres of terrestrial vegetation that stopped absorbing carbon dioxide, that released unwelcomed CO2 in the atmosphere while burning, and again while its dead biomass decomposed afterwards. Wildfires release about 10 tons km-2 of CO2 annually in the American West and Southeast (emissions that could increase by 50% by 2050.) Basically, human activities and wildfires create the green house effect that contributes to the global warming that dries our vegetation that burn just by looking at it. To put an end to this disaster, we need to switch our focus on the short and long term impact of the wildfires, quickly reverse our crazy protective policies and replace them with preventive measures such as controlled burns and“environmental”preventive logging, maintenance and clean up.

Prepaid anonymity: a danger? 

In the mid nineties, in France, one could buy a prepaid cell phone without having to show any picture ID or register any addresses. Talk about a“no strings attached”plans! The convenience was great and anybody could get a cheap cell phone and really pay-it-as-he-goes! Unfortunately, a too common occurrence when extreme freedoms are granted, the convenient and simple system was soon to be abused by gang bangers, drug dealers, criminals of all kind and terrorists. Think about it: stealthy portable communication devices were sold everywhere without any control! Phone numbers were assigned to the phones….but the phones not attached to anyone, thus preventing the eventual listening or tracking of the devices, of the owner. The phones were of course coming in every style, color and technology possible, and prices ranged high. Only the credit card size“minute cards”were standard. Soon, kids and adults were aggressed in the streets and their working and anonymous cell phones forcibly removed from them, to be used until the exhaustion of the remaining time, or to be sold as upgrades. The whole concept of“string free”had obviously become a bad idea, and by 1999, when I left, prepaid cell phones as they were designed, became more“secured”, regimented. One had to show a picture ID and proof of lodging (utility bill….) in order to buy a cell phone that was registered to a user.

2007, California. I went to get a prepaid cell phone for my French au pair. The local cell phone shop has a couple to offer and I picked one plus a $20 dollar card for 200 minutes. No ID control, nothing. I could have paid the total $40 cash and gone without a trace. The activation was a formality, on the phone, no question asked. Welcome Jane Doe! So here I am, 9 years later, discovering that the wheel is yet to be discovered again….the hard way! Prepaid phones are currently sold without any“strings attached”and can become untraceable communication and detonating devices for home grown terrorists or abroad. It also appears that their reselling value in developing country is triple the US price because most of them work internationally. All in all, it looks like those freedoms we enjoy just facilitate crimes. Again, I must ask you why even when voting, identities are not checked. What’s up with Americans and checking IDs? What is wrong with documenting that you are who you say you are? Freedom is a privilege one must earn and our freedoms have been paid in blood throughout time, earned for us by better men and women than us. Freedom is not a right and is not unchecked. Common sense, laws and courts have defined what our freedoms are and are still regulating what they consist of, trying to balance common good and personal rights. Freedom is something that can be legally taken, and re-instated. Freedom comes with a price….and these prepaid phones should come with a couple of safeguarding strings!

Anyways, the rich and the famous don’t want oil platforms to ruin their ocean-view from their beach mansions and the same environmentalists that reject oil or nuclear have found excuses to fight wind mills and solar farms in their backyards. Think…if you can!

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2001, from her mansion, Barbara Streisand told us to save energy and dry laundry outdoor. Today, the rich and the famous hypocritical figures of the country, tell us that they won&apos;t even re-consider off-shore drilling. Sure, Arnold, Gore, Pelosi and other“Santa Barbarians”can afford to fuel their own jets and global warming does not apply to them. How dare we, the stupid commoners, push for nuclear power or the off-shore drilling of our untapped resources? That would most likely ruin the picture perfect ocean sceneries they enjoy from the bay windows of their multi-thousand square acres exclusive beach properties. The Californian coastline is either protected or owned by millionaires. The latter will soon make the headlines against off-shore drilling in the name of environmental concerns! It is plain disgusting! Tell you what, 9 June 08 the Crude Oil was $3.20 and retail $4.43. Distribution, marketing, refinery, cost of operation and profit was 53 cts/gal for the Oil companies. State storage tank fee, state and local sales tax, state excise tax and federal excise tax totaled $0.70/gal. OPEC is enjoying higher demand, mainly from China and India. Oil companies are processing everything from extraction to delivery. Governments are…taxing! Think!

The 2008 puppet show, brought to you by big businesses 

During World War two, in France, the local mafia had a good scam going on: part of it joined the government of Vichy and collaborated with the Germans while the other part joined the Underground, the French resistance. At the liberation, the“collaborators”were caught and tried….but bailed out by the Free French Forces mobsters of the underground who testified that the one in the German side were actually working underground and provided a lot of good intelligence against the Germans. By keeping a foot on both camps, the mafia came up as a winner and that was a smart move. The Germans would have won, the process would have been inverted with the same results.

It is like playing roulette and gambling on red and white, even and uneven, or betting on the only horse left in the race….you cannot lose!

Why do I mention this historical sideline to you today? Well, presidential elections are on the way and the candidates are all telling you guys how things are going to change, telling us that the other are corrupted and bought out by corporate money, and that they are going to change the way D.C does business.

The three top candidates are voicing different point of views, representing different parties, claiming radical ideological and ethical differences…while“eating from the same eatery!”For one of them, it does not really matter anymore because she is about to be kicked out back to the senate where she has been supposed to represent her electorate from New York (disenfranchised voters through lack of representation?)…but still, it is interesting to look at the pattern in the“contributions”they got, at their top donors.

First, as mature and reasonable adults, I believe that we can all agree that there is not such a thing as a“free”donation or campaign contribution, a free innocent vote. Whenever we vote, or donate as individuals or as corporations, we are always expecting something in return, an agenda we support because we are somehow going to benefit from (Universal or private health care, less or more taxes, more or less food stamps, higher or lower minimum wages, Internet for all, foreclosure bail-out plan, reparations, open or closed borders, tax rebates….). Stating otherwise would be hypocritical because we also know that part of being a politician it to have deep pockets tailored in the suits!

So here it goes. I did some little research to see who have shoved their hands up the behind of the 2008 presidential candidates and make them move and talk.

Are you sitting? Brace yourselves!

Among the 20 top donors for each candidate, we find five that are contributing to all of them . Again, as mature and reasonable adult, we can agree that neither political ideology nor political agenda and candidate’s personality can motivate such a strange move that remind us of the little WW2 story I told you as an introduction.

Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase&amp;co and Lehman Brothers are these opportunistic“contributors”. Now you understand why the US of A is a country by the lawyers and for the lawyers!

Four other contributors are also donating across the aisle but mostly to the“old Washingtonians”, Mac Cain and Billary. Again, as mature and reasonable adult, we can agree that neither political ideology nor political agenda and candidate’s personality are behind that opportunistic behavior.

Merril Lynch, PricewaterhouseCoopers, UBS AG and Greenberg Traurig are the culprits betting on both parties.

 www.opensecrets.org is a good place to start looking at who is behind the scene….if you care at all, of course!

A simple search on presidential campaign contributions would also bring mostly the same things….the results only vary because of the twisted and complicated way campaign financing is regulated…PACs, coded vs non coded…everything to ensure that WE THE PEOPLE are totally screwed by the shrews!

China and the Asian stereotype of duplicity!  

Recently, China has been trying to restore its“virginity”on human rights and democracy because of the looming Olympic Games that are going to be held there.

The attention-deficient occident vaguely remembered something about safran-robed monks and oppression in Tibet and there was a couple of pushes to boycott the openings of these Games that are heavily sponsored and backed by western companies that have outsourced their manufacturing there, taking the work to the slave labor because slavery has been abolished on our shores. Remember:         China must look good and respectable!

The boycott started with the Olympic torch that was eventually targeted wherever it showed, stolen, blown off, and re-routed! Way to go people!

Anyways, China is still China and most of the country is rural and undeveloped, forgotten by the“industrial revolution”that has blessed a few places there. The country is also communist, secretive and belligerent. Finally, China is also a local bully with little democratic values and armed with the power to block the UN for it has been given the veto rights of the members of the General Assembly. In a nutshell, China does not care about political lobbying, tree huggers, chanting peaceniks or any other free speech advocate.

But China needs the Olympics to refurbish its tainted blazon and in order to do so, the Chinese government has bowed to the international pressure and started“talks”with Tibetan representatives….who cares anyways! In Asia, everything is long term and the repressions can resume once the Games are over, right?

In the meantime, China has also been proven guilty of bad judgment by supporting corrupt and extreme governments in order to secure oil and gas resources. And I won’t even mention North Korea!

It took a Genocide in Africa and a recent Asian hurricane and human tragedy to expose more of the Chinese government’s self serving lack of compassion.

We have already talked about Darfur and an ongoing genocide in this newsletter. Not only is China the preferred customer for the oil of Darfur, but China is also providing all the necessary military hardware to Khartoum, the capital, so the country–and its oil- can be secured. Is China indirectly arming the genocidal arms of the Arab militia called the Janjaweed? You bet, and as a result, about 1600 villages that have been burnt, looted, population displaced, raped, and slaughtered. 200.000 dead, 150 to 200.000 refugees in neighboring Chad and Central African Republic…this human tragedy has been happening under the Chinese watch for the past four years and we might want to add it to our list of grievances, just below the Tibetan mass repopulation drama.

Also recently, a massive earthquake hit China and brought the country to the fore of the news for the extent of the drama, the scope and quality of its humanitarian reaction, and the help provided by foreign nations. Forgotten is Tibet for now: China is mourning, and China is standing and fighting. China has become“decent”.

But at the same time, China has also been exposed for its double standards when a devastating hurricane hit and ravaged the coats of what used to be Burma.

How convenient for China to accept and ask for more foreign help to cope with its own natural disaster, and deny dirt poor Myanmar the same things by defending the corrupt and inefficient military Junta’s position not to allow anything to flow to the victims of the hurricane. According to Chinese officials, the world must respect the country’s decision to deny more help to the 2.5 million victims that are at high risk of more floods, diseases and hunger because“Myanmar”is a sovereign nation...under Chinese control! Myanmar is a backward military dictatorship similar to North Korea and has also conducted an active genocidal policy against its Karen minority. The country has been closed to world scrutiny for decades thanks to its Chinese big brother that regularly blocks the UN from investigating human rights abuses. Furthermore, it is also an ally of India in its fight against Indian insurgents hiding in the Burmese jungle. Finally, and most importantly, Myanmar’s junta has recently granted China the right to buy its natural gas and that also explains why China is not eager to see the Junta fall: more natural gas will diminish the Chinese dependency in oil, and lower its energy bills! Is it worth ignoring the human tragedy, the shortcomings and inefficiency of the military junta? You bet! .

To summarize, China buys more than half of the Sudanese oil output and wants Sudan to access the underground crude reserves of a pacified Darfur, pacified by Muslim militias armed with Chinese weapons. China also wants to access the gas reserves of Myanmar and won’t interfere with the corrupt and inept Junta at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. That is China for you folks! Welcome to geopolitics one-o-one: Money talks, the torch runs and people die! 

Nota: I wrote“China has also been proven guilty of bad judgment by supporting corrupt and extreme governments in order to secure oil and gas resources”and I already see among you people thinking that America is no better and that I could have written“America has also been proven guilty of bad judgment by supporting corrupt and extreme governments in order to secure oil and gas resources”. Here are our providers in order of importance:“The top five exporting countries accounted for 69 percent of United States crude oil imports in March while the top ten sources accounted for approximately 88 percent of all U.S. crude oil imports. The top sources of US crude oil imports for March were Canada (1.727 million barrels per day), Saudi Arabia (1.535 million barrels per day), Mexico (1.232 million barrels per day), Nigeria (1.138 million barrels per day), and Venezuela (0.858 million barrels per day). The rest of the top ten sources, in order, were Iraq (0.773 million barrels per day), Angola (0.375 million barrels per day), Algeria (0.232 million barrels per day), Ecuador (0.231 million barrels per day), and Brazil (0.188 million barrels per day).”

 http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/company_level_imports/current/import.html The US needs oil….well let me rephrase it: you guys out there are energy guzzlers and we need to import oil anyways because you won’t let us pump our own. No democracy would ever survive the direct supporting of a genocide to secure or protect its energy sources (Iraq is not really paying off as far as oil goes, or for the Bush administration’s approval rating?!...and it is not even genocide!). If we were to get rid of all of our tainted sources for oil (or food, electronics….), we would be stuck with Canada and the UK because all the other countries still have a lot to learn about Democracy…and we would also be stuck with an Amish-like lifestyle! No more Hybrid car, Starbucks and other latte, American idol and credit cards…we would all become Amish and live happily ever after! China on the other hand can get away indirectly killing hundreds of thousands of people while you sleep at the helm, focused on your navel!

How convenient for China to accept and ask for more foreign help to cope with its own natural disaster, and deny Myanmar the same thing by defending the military Junta’s position not to allow anything to flow to the victims of the hurricane. According to Chinese officials, the world must respect the country’s decision to deny more help to the 2.5 million victims that are at high risk of more floods, diseases and hunger because“Myanmar”is a sovereign nation...under Chinese control! Myanmar is a backward military dictatorship similar to North Korea and has also conducted an active genocidal policy against its Karen minority. The country has been closed to world scrutiny for decades thanks to its Chinese big brother that regularly blocks the UN from investigating human rights abuses. Furthermore, it is also an ally of India in its fight against Indian insurgents hiding in the Burmese jungle. Finally, Myanmar’s junta has recently granted China the right to buy its natural gas and that also explains why China is not eager to see the Junta fall. More natural gas will diminish the Chinese dependency in oil, and lower its energy bills. Money talks, the torch runs and people die!!!

Recently, Tim White left Indiana for a $325,000 job at the University of Riverside (plus $25,000 for relocation and a $9,000 annual car expense). Mark Yudof - Texas Universities system- was given a $925,000 annual package and an $11,000 monthly house allowance to lead the University of California. According to some they walk on water and lay golden eggs. In 2005 the salaries of the UC employees were posted online (key words: sfgate special 2005 UC salary) and showed how one could end up with a 600k paycheck on a 40k salary. The perks are just incredible and cover overtime, bonuses, housing and relocation allowances, stipends and other revenue sharing. Instead of being the places of“higher learning”where our students are trained for the future, Californian universities have become symbolic images of inefficiency and corruption. Last year,“Higher Education”has cost the State 11 billion, on top of the $52 billion dedicated to“regular education”(for a total budget of $101 billion that also included $28 billion for salaries). Still, tuitions go up, results go down and taxpayers end up footing the extra bills. Am I the only one shocked by this never ending self serving scam?

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Last year,“Higher Education”cost the State 11 billion. But University salaries are so high that tuitions are increased, often leading angry students to march to the capitol demanding fair prices. California runs through referendum and Legislators put out purposely confusing duplicate bills that exonerate them from their job responsibilities. Often tricked, misinformed and uneducated on the issues at hand, voters buy into the scams and repeatedly shoot themselves on the foot. More money flows, tuitions are lowered, perks increased, money runs short, tuitions are upped…blah blah. Furthermore, it seems like there is no resource for administrators in California. Recently, Mark Yudof - Texas Universities system- was given an $828,084 annual package to lead the University of California. According to some he walks on water and lays golden eggs. He is even said to fly! That is not all. Salaries are topped with Perks that also include overtime, bonuses, housing and relocation allowances, stipends and other revenue sharing. Online 2005 salary reporting on UC employees show how with a 40k salary you end up with a 600k paycheck (key words: sfgate special 2005 UC salary). It works for the universities, the schools, legislators, state workers salaries….nothing new…keep on milking us!

By the way….for the cry baby who cannot drive their stupid Sport Utility vehicles, trucks, Sport light utility trucks (SLUT), and other gas guzzler and don’t like where we are going with the gas prices and how much profit oil companies made….and think the latter are responsible….I have news for you:

Cost of gasoline break down according to the liberal Californian government

 http://www.energy.ca.gov/gasoline/margins/index.html 

Refiner Margin - Refiner Margin (costs and profits) is calculated by subtracting the market price for crude oil from the wholesale price of gasoline. The result is a gross refining margin which includes the cost of operating the refinery as well as the profits for the refining company.

Recent example:
9 June 08:
Crude Oil Cost: $3.20
Retail prices: $4.43

Refineries:
Distribution Costs, Mayketing Costs and Profits: $0.02
Refinery Cost and Profits: $0.51
Total for the profit and cost of operation: 53 cts

State Underground Storage Tank Fee: $0.01
State and Local Sales Tax: $0.33
State Excise Tax: $0.18
Federal Excise Tax: $0.18
Total: $0.70

Result: Governments win 70 to 53!

If the oil companies made billion in profit and that makes you mad, just think of how much your governments (Federal and local) are piling up…and you are pissed at the oil industry and want to raise their taxes…They do the work, find it, drill it, run the risks of losing it all in foreign countries (nationalization of the oil industry has been common from Mexico to Venezuela, not counting all the Arab countries), re-invest in other risky places like Afghanistan, Georgia, Darfur or Colombia and hope things will get better….while the government sits on his butt and cashes in–chin chin- to give to Katrina’s victims while the survivors of the massive fires and exodus of San Diego last year or of the massive floods in Iowa now, just move on with their lives without tears, looting, rapes, murders and shooting at firefighters or other red cross employees….

Way to go….grow a brain and think, and imagine what would happen if OBObama listen to is crooked acquaintances such as rev Wrong, Tony Rezko, or Jim Johnson and raises the taxes on oil companies?

Business one-o-one: businesses don’t pay taxes . The cost of operation is included to the price of the product! You would have a job, you would know!

Sleep tight now! We are watching out for you!

What does it cost Obama NOT to make Billary a VP or drag the Ctintons around: $10 million bucks!
I would have known it was so cheap to get rid of the gang, I would have collected money myself!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Breaking news:

Gas prices go up: go blame Billary, Obama and Mc Cain’s major contributors!

Yes….the messiah too is taking oil stained money and wants more since he flipped flopped on the campaign financing issue…After his links to Jim Johnson and the subprime mortgage companies was exposed

 http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/11/obama.vp/index.html 

here comes the next one: senate is investigating possible and likely speculation on the oil prices….involving major donors to the presidential candidates……that have made major donations to the Democrats!

 http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/moneyweb.php?cycle=2008 

I quote:
“The crux of the matter goes back to January 2006, according to the Asia Times’William Engdahl in a May editorial.
“Then, apparently to make sure the way was opened really wide to potential market oil price manipulation, in January 2006, the George W Bush administration’s CFTC permitted the Intercontinental Exchange, the leading operator of electronic energy exchanges, to use its trading terminals in the United States for the trading of U.S. crude oil futures on the exchange in London - called“ICE Futures.”
The editorial takes the position that“how today’s oil prices are really determined is done by a process so opaque only a handful of major oil trading banks, such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, have any idea who is buying and who is selling oil futures or derivative contracts that set physical oil prices in this strange new world of‘paper oil.’”
Ties exist between Phil Gramm and investors, including Goldman Sachs, who helped move regulation of WTI offshore, with the ICE Futures Europe purchase.
For example, the top five contributors to Gramm in the 1997-2002 cycle of fundraising were Credit Suisse First Boston, $45,500; Morgan Stanley, $40,500; JP Morgan Chase&amp;Co, $36,250; Security Traders Assn., $32,500 and Goldman Sachs, $29,000—a list that includes four major oil-trading banks and a traders association, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
“A major contributor to high oil prices is the rise in speculation,”Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. said in May, estimating that speculation has added about $35 to a barrel of oil.“This is not a supply and demand issue.”

In 2001, from her mansion, Barbara Streisand told us to save energy and dry laundry outdoor. Today, the rich and the famous hypocritical figures of the country, tell us that they won&apos;t even re-consider off-shore drilling. Sure, Arnold, Gore, Pelosi and other“Santa Barbarians”can afford to fuel their own jets and global warming does not apply to them. How dare we, the stupid commoners, push for nuclear power or the off-shore drilling of our untapped resources? That would most likely ruin the picture perfect ocean sceneries they enjoy from the bay windows of their multi-thousand square acres exclusive beach properties. The Californian coastline is either protected or owned by millionaires. The latter will soon make the headlines against off-shore drilling in the name of environmental concerns! It is plain disgusting! Tell you what, 9 June 08 the Crude Oil was $3.20 and retail $4.43. Distribution, marketing, refinery, cost of operation and profit was 53 cts/gal for the Oil companies. State storage tank fee, state and local sales tax, state excise tax and federal excise tax totaled $0.70/gal. OPEC is enjoying higher demand, mainly from China and India. Oil companies are processing everything from extraction to delivery. Governments are…taxing! Think!

The 2008 puppet show, brought to you by big businesses 

During World War two, in France, the local mafia had a good scam going on: part of it joined the government of Vichy and collaborated with the Germans while the other part joined the Underground, the French resistance. At the liberation, the“collaborators”were caught and tried….but bailed out by the Free French Forces mobsters of the underground who testified that the one in the German side were actually working underground and provided a lot of good intelligence against the Germans. By keeping a foot on both camps, the mafia came up as a winner and that was a smart move. The Germans would have won, the process would have been inverted with the same results.

It is like playing roulette and gambling on red and white, even and uneven, or betting on the only horse left in the race….you cannot lose!

Why do I mention this historical sideline to you today? Well, presidential elections are on the way and the candidates are all telling you guys how things are going to change, telling us that the other are corrupted and bought out by corporate money, and that they are going to change the way D.C does business.

The three top candidates are voicing different point of views, representing different parties, claiming radical ideological and ethical differences…while“eating from the same eatery!”For one of them, it does not really matter anymore because she is about to be kicked out back to the senate where she has been supposed to represent her electorate from New York (disenfranchised voters through lack of representation?)…but still, it is interesting to look at the pattern in the“contributions”they got, at their top donors.

First, as mature and reasonable adults, I believe that we can all agree that there is not such a thing as a“free”donation or campaign contribution, a free innocent vote. Whenever we vote, or donate as individuals or as corporations, we are always expecting something in return, an agenda we support because we are somehow going to benefit from (Universal or private health care, less or more taxes, more or less food stamps, higher or lower minimum wages, Internet for all, foreclosure bail-out plan, reparations, open or closed borders, tax rebates….). Stating otherwise would be hypocritical because we also know that part of being a politician it to have deep pockets tailored in the suits!

So here it goes. I did some little research to see who have shoved their hands up the behind of the 2008 presidential candidates and make them move and talk.

Are you sitting? Brace yourselves!

Among the 20 top donors for each candidate, we find five that are contributing to all of them . Again, as mature and reasonable adult, we can agree that neither political ideology nor political agenda and candidate’s personality can motivate such a strange move that remind us of the little WW2 story I told you as an introduction.

Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase&amp;co and Lehman Brothers are these opportunistic“contributors”. Now you understand why the US of A is a country by the lawyers and for the lawyers!

Four other contributors are also donating across the aisle but mostly to the“old Washingtonians”, Mac Cain and Billary. Again, as mature and reasonable adult, we can agree that neither political ideology nor political agenda and candidate’s personality are behind that opportunistic behavior.

Merril Lynch, PricewaterhouseCoopers, UBS AG and Greenberg Traurig are the culprits betting on both parties.

 www.opensecrets.org is a good place to start looking at who is behind the scene….if you care at all, of course!

A simple search on presidential campaign contributions would also bring mostly the same things….the results only vary because of the twisted and circonvoluted way campaign financing is regulate…PACs, coded vs non coded…everything to ensure that WE THE PEOPLE are totally screwed by the shrews!

China and the Asian stereotype of duplicity! 

Recently, China has been trying to restore its“virginity”on human rights and democracy because of the looming Olympic Games that are going to be held there.

The attention-deficient occident vaguely remembered something about safran-robed monks and oppression in Tibet and there was a couple of pushes to boycott the openings of these Games that are heavily sponsored and backed by western companies that have outsourced their manufacturing there, taking the work to the slave labor because slavery has been abolished on our shores. Remember:         China must look good and respectable!

The boycott started with the Olympic torch that was eventually targeted wherever it showed, stolen, blown off, and re-routed! Way to go people!

Anyways, China is still China and most of the country is rural and undeveloped, forgotten by the“industrial revolution”that has blessed a few places there. The country is also communist, secretive and belligerent. Finally, China is also a local bully with little democratic values and armed with the power to block the UN for it has been given the veto rights of the members of the General Assembly. In a nutshell, China does not care about political lobbying, tree huggers, chanting peaceniks or any other free speech advocate.

But China needs the Olympics to refurbish its tainted blazon and in order to do so, the Chinese government has bowed to the international pressure and started“talks”with Tibetan representatives….who cares anyways! In Asia, everything is long term and the repressions can resume once the Games are over, right?

In the meantime, China has also been proven guilty of bad judgment by supporting corrupt and extreme governments in order to secure oil and gas resources. And I won’t even mention North Korea!

It took a Genocide in Africa and a recent Asian hurricane and human tragedy to expose more of the Chinese government’s self serving lack of compassion.

We have already talked about Darfur and an ongoing genocide in this newsletter. Not only is China the preferred customer for the oil of Darfur, but China is also providing all the necessary military hardware to Khartoum, the capital, so the country–and its oil- can be secured. Is China indirectly arming the genocidal arms of the Arab militia called the Janjaweed? You bet, and as a result, about 1600 villages that have been burnt, looted, population displaced, raped, and slaughtered. 200.000 dead, 150 to 200.000 refugees in neighboring Chad and Central African Republic…this human tragedy has been happening under the Chinese watch for the past four years and we might want to add it to our list of grievances, just below the Tibetan mass repopulation drama.

Also recently, a massive earthquake hit China and brought the country to the fore of the news for the extent of the drama, the scope and quality of its humanitarian reaction, and the help provided by foreign nations. Forgotten is Tibet for now: China is mourning, and China is standing and fighting. China has become“decent”.

But at the same time, China has also been exposed for its double standards when a devastating hurricane hit and ravaged the coats of what used to be Burma.

How convenient for China to accept and ask for more foreign help to cope with its own natural disaster, and deny dirt poor Myanmar the same things by defending the corrupt and inefficient military Junta’s position not to allow anything to flow to the victims of the hurricane. According to Chinese officials, the world must respect the country’s decision to deny more help to the 2.5 million victims that are at high risk of more floods, diseases and hunger because“Myanmar”is a sovereign nation...under Chinese control! Myanmar is a backward military dictatorship similar to North Korea and has also conducted an active genocidal policy against its Karen minority. The country has been closed to world scrutiny for decades thanks to its Chinese big brother that regularly blocks the UN from investigating human rights abuses. Furthermore, it is also an ally of India in its fight against Indian insurgents hiding in the Burmese jungle. Finally, and most importantly, Myanmar’s junta has recently granted China the right to buy its natural gas and that also explains why China is not eager to see the Junta fall: more natural gas will diminish the Chinese dependency in oil, and lower its energy bills! Is it worth ignoring the human tragedy, the shortcomings and inefficiency of the military junta? You bet! .

To summarize, China buys more than half of the Sudanese oil output and wants Sudan to access the underground crude reserves of a pacified Darfur, pacified by Muslim militias armed with Chinese weapons. China also wants to access the gas reserves of Myanmar and won’t interfere with the corrupt and inept Junta at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. That is China for you folks! Welcome to geopolitics one-o-one: Money talks, the torch runs and people die! 

Nota: I wrote“China has also been proven guilty of bad judgment by supporting corrupt and extreme governments in order to secure oil and gas resources”and I already see among you people thinking that America is no better and that I could have written“America has also been proven guilty of bad judgment by supporting corrupt and extreme governments in order to secure oil and gas resources”. Here are our providers in order of importance:“The top five exporting countries accounted for 69 percent of United States crude oil imports in March while the top ten sources accounted for approximately 88 percent of all U.S. crude oil imports. The top sources of US crude oil imports for March were Canada (1.727 million barrels per day), Saudi Arabia (1.535 million barrels per day), Mexico (1.232 million barrels per day), Nigeria (1.138 million barrels per day), and Venezuela (0.858 million barrels per day). The rest of the top ten sources, in order, were Iraq (0.773 million barrels per day), Angola (0.375 million barrels per day), Algeria (0.232 million barrels per day), Ecuador (0.231 million barrels per day), and Brazil (0.188 million barrels per day).”

 http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/company_level_imports/current/import.html 

The US needs oil….well let me rephrase it: you guys out there are energy guzzlers and we need to import oil anyways because you won’t let us pump our own. No democracy would ever survive the direct supporting of a genocide to secure or protect its energy sources (Iraq is not really paying off as far as oil goes, or for the Bush administration’s approval rating?!...and it is not even genocide!). If we were to get rid of all of our tainted sources for oil (or food, electronics….), we would be stuck with Canada and the UK because all the other countries still have a lot to learn about Democracy…and we would also be stuck with an Amish-like lifestyle! No more Hybrid car, Starbucks and other latte, American idol and credit cards…we would all become Amish and live happily ever after! China on the other hand can get away indirectly killing hundreds of thousands of people while you sleep at the helm, focused on your navel!

According to some they walk on water and lay golden eggs. In 2005 the salaries of the UC employees were posted online (key words: sfgate special 2005 UC salary) and showed how one could end up with a 600k paycheck on a 40k salary.

Finally ID check for voters in half of the nation 

Finally America came to its senses and the Supremes have upheld the State of Indiana’s law that requires registered voters to show proof of identity. Since I have been in the States (99) I have been amazed at the fact that there is no real ID but the driver’s license or a credit card with your mug on it if you opt for the option. Of course, liberal conspiracy theorist are talking about a right wing conspiracy (that ensures that only American citizens can actually perform their highest responsibility and right ever???), saying that voters are going to be disenfranchised, the poor and the elder, and minorities, and the many many people who don’t have any ID, nor idea, nor business in the US of A.

The big right wing brother is watching….and Bush is going to steal the elections!!! Boo hoo!

The ID card in Indiana is free….tell you what: if the elder are able to cash their retirement, find their way through Medicare, drive to the shopping center, renew their driver’s licenses, smog their cars, use a credit card, go to the local casino or play bingo , they can go and get a free ID.

If you are poor but able to walk to the nearest church to get your free canned food, to a state agency to get your food stamps, to the next curb to hold a“would not even work for food stamps”sign, to a Democrat party meeting or the ER for medical assistance, you can go get your free ID.

If you are legal minority, victimized and disenfranchised for life but able to attend Democratic Party meetings, go to“civil right”marches, listen to reverend Wright, register with“La Raza”, open a French restaurant, or run a 7-11, you are able to get your free ID card.

If you are illegal, able to figure out how to cross the border, get a social security card, cash unemployment checks, lobby politicians to stand for you and get pamphlets from Mexico telling you what your rights are in America, you can get your ID card.

Basically, if you can make the effort to register to vote, you can also get a free ID….unless you are a Democrat from Dale County in Florida!

So what is your problem with the protecting of YOUR MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT?

Billary is angry because she will lose an important share of her Latino votes…Obama is just OK and“will make sure every rightful voter is voting”….good….the ID requirement will ensure that!

As for me, I am against because I won’t be able to vote anymore, again, and again, and again!

Sue Wilson: Federal rules give corporation-backed conservative radio all the local voices


Sacramento Bee, Sunday May 11 2008, Opinions: KSAC radio &quot;killed&quot; the last &quot;progressive radio show and replaced it by Christian music. Sue will lose her job and tries to make the case that the FAIRNESS DOCTRINE needs to be brought back to provide listeners with the opportunity to hear something else than the &quot;conservative conglomerates&quot; that have put her and many other like her before, out of work. What is &quot;fair&quot; in the fairness doctrine?


A problem with her piece: radio is something that one must chose to actively listen to! Brain washing from the right or the left can go on without affecting anybody that has not actively tuned on a specific station. Like TV, bad shows get low audience and bad ratings and good shows get audience, attract advertizing, get ratings and generate tons of money. If classic music, christian music, minority radios, hard rock or country make it without any governement intervention, why should &quot;progressive talk&quot; be protected by a &quot;fairness doctrine&quot;, an affirmative action law that denies the rules of free market and competition and actually limit freedom of speech.


Below my comments to her:

Every year the same stuff comes over and over again, most of it pet projects of the left that have been“discarded”one way or another (ballot box, bill…). The so-called“fairness doctrine”is one of them and the cry-baby excuses are always the same lame one.

I understand that Sue Wilson is mourning the end of her job and wishes that some government program such as a“Fairness Doctrine”would guarantee her decades of secure airwave time“balancing”opposite radio shows. But right now, I guess she can only vent, and complain, and seek a job in a left leaning newspaper or Californian campus.

I am still amazed at the way“social engineering”works in America. In the name of equality, we have divided our society in self conscious entitled groups (sexual, religious, racial, ethnic….) and in the name of Fairness, some want to impose an artificial system that would override the market economy and legalize a limitation of free speech.

Radio, like TV, is pretty cool….nobody can force you to tune in, to select a station…free will at his best, the American dream.

But according to Sue Wilson, it is not fair, because there are more conservative, Hip Hop, and Christian radio shows than“progressive”(whatever that word mean to describe Democrats and Liberals). Of course, not to offend people, she does no mention Hispanic, Russian, Vietnamese or other ethnic shows, even classic music, hard rock or country features that are still successful out there. What are their excuses to be successful enough to survive the“evil conglomerates”? Who finance them? Nope….it is unfair because her business model, the industry she works in, is basically faulty….but at the end, making it political eases the pain of failure….it is all about politics…and her!

Let see….Could we agree on the following:

-         If 90% of the talk shows are“conservative”it is because most people CHOSE to tune in“Conservative”talk!

American freedom of CHOICE!

American free market: up or out!

People don’t tune in because they cannot listen to liberal–sorry,“progressive”- speech. People chose to tune in, therefore listening indexes go up, stations become successful, success attracts advertisers, advertisers mean money, and everybody makes money! These are the basics of the business out there, for everybody in the radio business! Why is American Idol more successful than 20/20? Because it is trun by FOX or because people just like it better and TUNE IN?

-         If 90% of the talk shows are“conservative”and doing good, it is because they sell advertizing and make bundles of money, not because they are protected by a federal plan or agency, by a law. But according to Sue Wilson, Liberal talk should be somewhat protected, right! Actually we could also agree that the first amendment was not written to protect the politically correct speech on harmless foozy-woozy subject aiming at making people feel good, but that it was written instead to protect“offensive“and divisive speech! Again, should we come up with a sort of affirmative action program to give special preferences and protections to“progressive”radio?

-         If KSAC cannot afford a bigger transmitter, that is tough luck…I’d love to own a Rolls and live in Monterey….cannot afford it and won’t cry over it!

-         If KSAC was happy with 32000 listeners a week, I am happy for them! One has to be content with what he has! The blog I contribute to has more drive-by bloggers….a day. I wonder if the“Fairness doctrine”should also extend its rules over the Internet, and TV, and movie theatres, and schools, and Universities, and daily speech, and bumper stickers, newspapers, personal websites, school papers, match boxes…? Why not? What is FAIR?

-         Sue Wilson also states that businesses would never advertise in“progressive talk”because“liberals never miss an opportunity to bash corporations as evil and crooked”. So we have to believe that the Obama and Clintons of the world are not getting any of their“contributions”from businesses, right, that all corporations are evil and none would ever contribute to the left side? Furthermore, may I suggest her to listen to Armstrong and Getty, Ron Arrnie and Don, Michael Savage…. if she wants to hear some really hard and crude bashing of the President, his administration, his secretaries, and big corporations…they do it daily…and get funding…and more listeners every day!

-         If“the broadcasters must serve the public interest–the public interest of all of the people,”why is“progressive radio”guilty of only preaching for its“church”, the same way“conservative”radio is accused of? Should moveon.org open its pages to conservative, Christian, or anti-abortion crowd too? This is getting too funny…and sad.

-         If the 1700“conservative”radio“starved independent stations of revenue”, it is indeed good business, the good old fashion American way, the way the Wall Mart, Lowes, Home Depot, Ford, Gm, ATT…etc, etc….have starved their competition. Up or out….unless of course, we also implement the“fairness doctrine”to everything around.

Who are we kidding?

First of all, most of the politicians of the left side of the aisle are millionaire running -or contributing to- big corporations (maybe the speaker of the house could ask her husband to donate some of the profit made from the defense contracts she awarded him?). Furthermore, market economy“oblige”, corporation always spend money across the spectrum to ensure a return in investment. Finally, Sue Wilson want us to believe that NO US corporation is run by a left leaning or independent CEO that would invest some money in“progressive talk radio”if it were profitable, ENTERTAINING, and not a waste of resources. No way!

To the question“Why are corporate dollars the sole arbiter of what information we the people get to hear on publicly owned airwaves?”the answer again is simple: free market, everything is for sale and MONEY TALKS. Why are corporate dollars also the sole arbiter of what information we the people get to hear FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES on publicly owned airwaves? Why anything in America, even the presidential seat, depends on“corporate money”from the left (like Mr Soros) or the right, or just from“neutral corporations”with a big financial agenda (and not political)….this is your country Sue, you answer that! But that is the way it runs….

Again, people need to tune in, dial around and seek something they relate to, something they like, set it on their radio, and just listen to if afterwards.

There is no room for“progressive”talk radio the way it is and Sue Wilson should go and apply her talents where“progressive”talk works: Moveon.org, political campaign staffs, free speech.org, Schools and Universities…would be a good start!

If the“fairness doctrine”is re-implemented, besides guarantying the Sue Wilson of the world with a lifelong career, it would need to be enforced to grant some listeners to the liberal media. What would FORCE listener to tune in order to get“the equal time”, the material for a democratic“balanced view”.

Would brown shirt and stick toting“Fairness doctrine Implementation Police forces”be created to force us to listen to the“progressive”voice?

That would be highly progressive indeed, along with re-education camps and self criticizing….

Sue Wilson should not ask the government what it is going to do for her but ask herself why nobody wants to tune in–or invest- in her business model.“Progressive”radios have popped up and gone for a decade while“conservative”radio has strived. Personally, I think that the shows I listen to are fun, highly entertaining, and dynamic and often echo my convictions. When I browsed through“progressive”radio, I have always felt like listening to a boring bunch of condescending self-congratulatory University teachers that think that the rest of the world is a bunch of illiterate gun totting, god fearing red-necks. I never felt like belonging to their audience and the last thing I want to do while I commute is die of boredom, or fall asleep.

Why pushing for Colombia! The US government and its strange bonds with a really unstable country.

 For almost three decades, the US government has been involved in an anti narcotic war in Colombia.
Officially the main goal was to help the local government put an end to the culture, refinery and export to America of the cocaine from that poor country. There, peasants had to resort to the illegal culture for lack of alternate crop and source of income.

The Colombian elite was made of drug lords and Pablo Escobar was the top dog, the one and only–and also one of the richest men of the world- until his violent death in 1993. For the poor, he was a sort of Robin Hood, providing them with a source of income, lodging, schools, and health facilities in exchange for a total loyalty. For the Pro US government and anti-drug forces, he was a merciless killer heading the Cartel of Medellin, the man that got thousands of people executed, from government officials to cops and lawyers.

His death eventually created a vacuum that was immediately filled by the Cartel of Cali (his top contender) and many smaller and rival organizations. Despite millions of dollars, years of“deforestation”, electronic warfare and active military actions against all the smuggling means the drug lords have used (airplanes, submarines…) the production did not stop at all, and the production of cocaine even increased, unbridled and uncontrollable.

Today, drug lords, guerillas and Colombian paramilitary forces supposed to fight them are cashing in with the white powdered gold. Did the US lose….or not?

 Colombia is also a country that has been plagued by a civil war for half a century. Pablo Escobar did try to get rid of the communist guerilla movements that competed with him for the drug money, but he did not succeed and eventually sided with them so everybody got a cut of the drug deals. If you cannot beat them, join them! These guerillas owned the jungle and the FARC group is actually the real American target today (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia).

Considered as a terrorist group by almost everybody but Castro and Chavez, the group was born in the forties and controls about 20% of the country. Composed of about 15 to 20 thousand fighters, armed and equipped like a regular army, they are led by the septuagenarian Manual Marulanda. The group eventually lost its communist affiliation when it started dealing drugs in the eighties.

The FARCs are still making the news today and you might have heard of the most recent events linked to them. To better finance their struggle they have also resorted to revolutionary taxes, gold digging and hostage taking. One of these hostages is the famous Ingrid de Bettencourt, a dual citizen of Colombia and France, and a former presidential candidate. She has been held since 2002 and her failing health came fore recently when rumors of her imminent death made the news. Furthermore, in March 2008, the Colombian army raided a FARC camp in Ecuador and killed their second in Command and spokesman, Paul Reyes. Tensions arose between the two countries and Hugo Chavez even started to mobilize its military forces in Venezuela.

 

Drugs coming to America, Marxist guerillas, and corrupted governments…the US had many reasons to get involved and to stay. That is why the“Plan Colombia”,“a Marshall plan for Colombia”came up!

Brewed in 1999 by Bill Clinton and the Colombian president of the time, Pastrana, and signed in August of 2000, it was aiming at pacifying Colombia and generating prosperity.

One of the goals was to promote substitution crops in Colombia and lower US import taxes so these crops would have a market.

Suddenly, the culture of coca would be replaced by flowers or other textile related greens and America would be buying it all. It made sense but not to the republican lead congress that vetoed it (and today Bush is pushing it and the Democrat lead congress might reject it! Go figure!).

In order to achieve that objective, the Colombian administration directly dealt with the FARC and granted them part of the country as a free roaming demilitarized zone in exchange of the dropping of the drug trafficking. The Colombian military leadership reacted strongly, supported by the US congress, and they strong-armed Pastrana into ending his dialogue with the rebels. The only deal left for the Clinton administration was the more traditional one: the arming and training of the Colombian forces to get rid of drug dealers and guerillas. $7 billion of US help over a couple of years were allocated, translated in top notch military hardware and US advisers. Satellite systems were designed and implemented to detect the fields of coca, and chemicals used to destroy them (Roundup from Monsanto!). On the paper, the combination of the two seemed unbeatable but nobody was wise enough to foresee the real results of these massive destructions;

-         Growers–poor peasants- lost the coca but also their small gardens as a collateral damages. All means of surviving gone, they eventually joined the FARC seen as the good guys.

-         As far as the jungle goes, it was an environmental disaster

-         For the coca, it is easy to grow and the fields were moved deeper under the cover of the jungle and the output actually increased

-         Small spraying airplanes were destroyed because of their vulnerabilities

All in all, it was a mistake, an expensive failure….but…

 

War, total war became the new adopted solution by the Generals in Colombia who wanted a share of the $7 billion budget, and by the American government that saw war as a way to invest that same money into the national economy. The satellite system and its maintenance and operation, secured communication, latest US helicopters (18 Blackhawk for $237 million + $120 million for additional heliborne support if necessary), Monsanto chemicals sprayed by Dyncorp airplanes and crews (some pilots were even caught using and dealing the cocaine they were supposed to destroy)…

 The Bush administration continued the policy in 2001, despite its failure to achieve the official goals or eradicating coca. President Bush even got more money for the plan and the full support of the new Colombian president.

Alvaro Uribe was elected in 2002 on one platform: the end of the guerillas, the end of the FARC that have killed his father and tried to kill him a dozen times. He was highly motivated to side with the US government and suddenly, Colombia became one of the three countries the most heavily subsidized by America, with Israel and Egypt. The war switched from drugs to anti-guerilla and with presidents Uribe and Bush, the use of the American equipment and personnel for the destruction of the FARC became the official policy. Colombia was put under the total control by the army and the police tasked to crack on the rebels. This state of emergency and virtual dictatorship of Uribe (that granted himself the power to bypass its congress), led to the creation of an illegal and bloody right wing paramilitary groups tasked to do the dirty job, groups quickly matched by the FARC that created the“Bolivarian militias”of urban combat, bringing the civil war to the streets of Bogota. Despite the fact that this paramilitary force under Carlos Castana became even worse than the FARC (human rights violations, rapes, illegal taxes for“protection”, torture, violence, drug trafficking…), and despite the fact that they were eventually added to the US terrorist list, their“good”results against the FARC granted them immunity, as long as they recovered land from the rebels…and secured oil supplies.

 Yes….you read it right! OIL with a big“O”…again!

 Colombia accounts for close to 1 million barrels a year (up from 100.000 in the eighties) and the US relies more and more on South American oil to keep its gas guzzlers on the road and limit its dependency on the Persian Gulf. Knowing that the FARC have been pretty good in the past at disrupting the Colombian oil production (in retaliation to the American push to destroy them) and because many US companies have been granted exploration and exploitation rights on the yet undiscovered and untapped reserves that sit in FARC held territories, you understand now why the war on the drug lords and their revolutionary accomplices has totally switched to today’s open war on the FARC. For ever, the US administrations, from Clinton to Bush, have tried to secure and develop a new source of oil in Latin America, and the war on Drugs was just a lame excuse, a minimal part of a bigger and longer well orchestrated plan! 

 Key words: Plan Colombia, Pablo Escobar, Farc, Colombian oil….

Wake up people…no wonder Ritalin is a fast growing drug! You anti-torch guys must suffer from permanent attention disorder and should focus more on your health and less on bay events. Repeat after me: China has never ever had good human records. China does not care about being nice, polite, politically correct, nor does China care about pleasing American Buddhist, and/or Katmandu lovers. And repeat after me again: China will not let Tibet go, ever! You can blow the torch, pee yourself, roll and cry, climb the Golden Gate or jump from it, China does not care. Furthermore, the Olympics will be held anyways and all the nations will smile and cheer while American and other Western corporations in the business of exporting our jobs and manufacturing facilities to the 25 cents an hour Chinese slave workers will inundate the airwaves with expensive ads. The same applies for the Darfur lovers. China does not care about your lobbying, hunger strikes and chaining yourself to a tree. China buys more than half of the Sudanese oil output and wants Sudan to access the underground crude reserves of a pacified Darfur, pacified by Muslim militias armed with Chinese weapons. Welcome to geopolitics!

I respect Hmong veterans for their long struggle at the side of the French, and the Americans afterwards, in what used to be Indochina. We know about their plight in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. But should we dedicate them a special chapter in our school curriculum? I went through my son’s fourth grader“Social study”book on opening day at school and asked the teacher if it was coming with a whip and if there was anything there that he should be proud of…Chinese building railraods, depossessed Mexican immigrants, Japanese camps, and the native we slaughtered. Today we are going to add the Hmongs to the curriculum and the tale of our abandonning them to the Vietnamese and Laotian revenge. Question: Should the books cover the history of all the minorities that make the framework of America? Should our schools be responsible for the transmitting of cultures and traditions from one silent generation to a passive one? What is next? The Italian contribution to the American Pizza, the Middle Eastern love story with 7-11, the French improvement to American wines and kisses? The casino success story of the the Cache Creek, Thunder valley and other Jackson Rancheria foreign nations? Our kids are failing in Math and English. They cannot spell SCIENCE and think Tibet is a sushi. Leave specialized history to higher places of learning and focus on the basic and general necessary skills our kids need to master.

The Steam train operator and his city’s sustained lifestyle: is he a millionaire?

 I wish I had more time to take a look at Folsom’s finances. My only hope is that we are not like Vallejo, flirting with bankruptcy because 80 percent of its general fund covered salaries or because it pre-spent future housing income.

I literally blew up after reading about the racketeering of our Steam train operator by the city. Is Folsom so desperate for money that it can go after a landmark business and increase its rent by 100% overnight? If the answer is yes, other businesses should beware. The lame excuse is that when“The city’s paying for the (park events),”the operator is getting more business for free. Since the housing“bubble”began around 2001 and reached its peak in 2005, the city has added 12,703 consumers, 3494 detached houses, 1758 multi-family housing units, and also delivered about 210 commercial permits (city website information). Property taxes went from roughly seven million in 2002 to ten in 2005 and almost twelve (proposed) in 2006. And I am not counting garbage, waste disposal, water, sewage, park fees and whatever other income the city collects, such as the mysterious“Landscaping and Lightning Districts”taxes for vague neighborhood improvements (Surplus should be carried forward as a credit against the following year: when is the last time that you got an L&amp;L credit? Is the city keeping surpluses?)

Where did the money go? Into, the library, the levees, or the grandiose repaving of our streets (already cracked and pot holed, not mentioning all these annoying little rubber pellets)

I know: Global Warming, that’s it!

From the top of your head, beside the library, what exactly did we get back from the city since 2001? A positive balance?

If the city is what it is today, it is because of us, the residents, a specific demographic exception made of above-average wealthy, educated and paid residents. It is because of its clean, competitive and attractive businesses, the tree lined neighborhood we tend, the streets we keep clean, the laws we abide, the steam train we ride and the Zoo we visit. Somehow, Folsom is still a little caring community with its landmarks, events and businesses that the Folsomites traditionally support. The city must recognize that the Steam train has been a park event by itself for 18 years, a feature associated to the Zoo and recently to the new library. Did that park make the train or did the train make that park?“All we’re trying to do is give the city its fair shake! (…) These are tough economic times and the city can’t keep sustaining his (train operator) lifestyle without getting anything in return.”Boo Hoo, blah blah!

I think it is time for us to take a look at the city’s lifestyle during“these tough economic times”and give it its fair shake-up. Where did the money go and how much?

Nancy Peligrosa is willing to risk the US already delicate situation in Iraq in the name of the appeasement of a powerful Armenian lobby that has been pushing again and again for the recognition by the US of the Armenian genocide conducted by the Ottoman Empire about a hundred years ago. Turkey is a critical NATO partner and a much more critical ally in the war in Iraq. The US uses Turkey as a rear logisitic base for its supply and air lift operations. One third of the fuel used by our military transits through Turkey 9so much for the people who claim we went in for Iraqi oil!). Angered by the Democrat led effort to officially recognize the genocide, Turkey is threatening to stop any active support to the US for the war in Iraq, review its position within the NATO alliance, and, worth of all, move into the Kurdish part of Iraq to conduct a retaliatory strike against the Kurd terrorist group (PKK) that has become emboldened by the US support for the Kurds in Iraq and resumed attacks against Turkey’s military (just slaughtered 13 border guards). If the resolution on the genocide passes, the Democrats will be responsible for breaking whatever balance exist in Northern Iraq, pushing the Turkish military into conducting military action against one of the active American ally in the war against terrorism in Iraq. The US government will have tough choices because of Nancy’s catering to her lobbyists: side with the Kurds or with Turkey, or jeopardize its military operations in Northern Iraq, or jeopardize NATO’s Southern flank, right when Putin is taking all the steps to resume the cold war.

The genocide has happened and has been recognized by many nations already. Genocide should not be encouraged and should be denounced…but is it the right time? The risk are so high for the future of America’s war in Iraq, NATO, the region…If the resolution passes and the situation goes as predicted (Turkey banning US operations from within its borders, military incursion in Northern Iraq, NATO loss of its Southern flank), the Democrat will bear the responsibility of the total collapse of that region of the world, our war effort, and NATO coalition.

Way to go! I wonder what Billary-ous and Osama are thinking of this backstabbing?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Political correctness has become such a“natural”part of our American life that one cannot oppose Billary’s candidacy without being tagged as a male chauvinist misogynist pig. In the same way, saying one does not support Obama is racist. Here is a question for you all, from the far left to the far right, Jerry excluded: should we just vote for Billary because she is the first woman ever to run for President? Should we only vote for Obama because it is about time we have a black President to make up for slavery, segregation, lack of reparation, profiling, etc, etc…? The danger of being so much in tune with our feelings, instead of our brain, is that we react emotionally to issues and not with logics. One should not vote for his party, or his guy, a gender, a race or a religion but for ideas, leadership, agenda, experience…anything but the looks, in pants or Mao suit. Political correctness is preventing the exchange of ideas and a healthy debate. Lawsuits and overstretched so-called“Hate crime”laws are daily muzzling freedom of speech as it was intended. Remember that Politically correct speech does not need to be protected by the constitution. The first amendment was written to protect“insensitive”speech….such as mine

How does Folsom fare?

 Today Vallejo is flirting with bankruptcy because 80 percent of its general fund covered the salaries and benefits of its union backed firefighters and police.

This is also what is happening at State level.

The Legislative Analyst’s Office (LAO) reported that when benefits are included, compensations for State employees amount to about $28 billion. Other available LAO tables also show that since 1991, state civil service employees have had a raise every single year (When is the last time you had one?). Other interesting figures are as follow: State legislators (120): a 42% raise since 2000 (while the General funds only increased by 32%); Highway patrol since 2003: 2.7% in 2003 up to 12% in 2004, and about 6% a year since. Correctional officers since 2003: from 5.2% to 10.3%.

Last year, it was reported that it costs taxpayers about $3 million per lawmaker per year in order to have the two legislative houses waste our surplus revenues on good days and raise taxes and sell bonds on bad days (actually, salaries and benefits make 80% of the money allocated to the Assembly or Senate.) And I could go on and on with all these depressing numbers available to anybody willing to look them up.

As for the education, the state general fund and local property tax revenue for education went from $35.6 billion in 1998 to about $50 billion for 2005-2006 (half of the total budget of the State). All this money is awarded to a funnel like broken system with only some of it trickling down to the already overcrowded classrooms. Look at the results: California ranks 46th in the nation. Furthermore, according to recent dramatic advertizing, the budget cuts applied on education are going to harm my kids and their classes might reach the 30 student per teacher...good….that will be an average of two kids less per classes and my daughter and my son will now have a full two minute per hour of one on one with their teachers! That is what: 10 to 15 minutes a day? Way to go.

So let me sum it up for you: $50 billion on education plus $28 billion on salaries added to about $3 billion in waste (2007 California Piglet Book) , out of a $100 billion budget equal 19 billion left for everything else (roads, repaying bonds, transportation, infrastructure, bills….). All in All, this is the business model of the 7th economy of the world, with its bankrupt lottery and corrupt Indian gaming to round up the numbers. Maybe it is time to legalize prostitution and have the State sell drugs in our schools to finally balance this mess! But who cares? Really? Just remember that there cannot be any crisis as long as you have taxpayers…Happy cows come from California (sometimes on a fork lift.) Keep on milking us!

Fierce faceoff likely as Johnson, Fargo vie for Sacramento mayor, March 6 2008

 Do you want to know what Sacrament will look like under another term of Democrat Mayor“Wealth”Fargo: Go drive around Sac. Start from J and spread out…the streets, the slums, downtown, the homeless. Just imagine more of it!

Do you want to see what Sacramento will look like under Democrat Kevin“Magic Slumlord”Johnson: drive around Sac. Start from the empty properties in disrepair he owns in Oak Park district and move center…just imagine a slum-downtown, more of what he could do!“Cow Town”is doomed!

I just love it. For the past 8 years, the Reps have been demonized as the Swift boaters, mud slingers, dirty politicians, election robbers, name callers, not fair popular vote does not count, etc, etc....

And here we are with the two last top Dems resorting to third world dirty politics to win the main price, the nomination, the trip to DC.

Nothing has been dirty enough, from taking to court casino workers union to prevent them from voting to racial innuendos, dug out 5th grader essays, poll station mob style attitude, lawsuits and sarcasms....and Billary camp has been really good about that....and these people want to give &quot;conserrvatives&quot; lessons on Democracy? Are you all kidding me? It is like sipping a good old cognac....just seating here and keeping score....and the wife of Monica&apos;s lover is not done....she will resort to anything to get what she thinks she is entitled to...even take the party down! I cannot wait....Champagne is in the fridge, ready for the Grand Finale, the ultimate moment of infamy by and for the one that claim that they stand for you...

I am too poor to be a Democrat and working too hard to be a liberal burning cars and smashing windows in the main streets of America.

Keep up the good work, Billary and other Obama, singing drunk Kennedy and filthy rich Code Pink picketed Pelosi! There is nothing on TV and we love to see you guys in action.

The worst congress rating in US history and the filthiest campaign ever in the Dem side!

2008, a year to remember...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Keep on milking us.

 80 percent of Vallejo&apos;s expenditures covered salaries. This is what is happening at State level.

The Legislative Analyst’s Office reported that benefits and compensations for State employees reach $28 billion. Other tables also show that since 1991, state civil service employees have had a raise every year (from 1.4% to 4.3% since 95). Other figures are as follow: Highway patrol since 2003: from 2.7% to 12%. Correctional officers since 2003: from 5.2% to 10.3%. As for the education, the state general fund for education went from $35.6 billion in 1998 to about $50 billion for 2005-2006 (half of the total budget of the State...and we rank 46th in the nation for academic achievements). Finally, since 2000, our 120 State legislators got a 42% raise and it costs taxpayers about $3 million per lawmaker per year in order to have the two legislative houses waste our surplus and sell bonds. And I could go on and on. This is the business model of the 7th economy of the world (10th according to the CIA). There is no crisis as long as you have taxpayers! Happy cows come from California, sometimes on a fork lift. Keep on milking us!

The last contenders to the American throne have vowed to lower our dependency from fossil fuel and our contribution to the green house effect. Mrs Clinton would bring 55 mpg cars to us by 2030 and would spend $50 billions in alternative fuel research. Obama would dedicate $150 billion for the next decade. McCain claims that he would focus on other“exotic”fuels and nuclear power. Let’s throw more of our money for things that are already out there, viable or not! Do you know that a basic European Fiat Punto Turbo diesel gets 50 mpg compared to 53 mpg with a Prius that cost about twice as much? Do you know that new diesel runs cleaner than gasoline and that a European green car is a turbo diesel car? Do you know that American automakers commonly get 30 to 50 mpg on their European models? Take FSAF for example. The American giant in Europe is known for its Ka, C-max, S-max, or Tourneo that average 40 mpg, and also run on Flexifuel that lowers emissions by 70%. FSAF has even imposed itself as the Green champion of the automakers, touting innovations since 2001. Flexifuel, a mixture of ethanol (85%) and any grade gasoline (15%), has been so widely adopted all over Europe that FSAF had a couple of their cars go from Bodo (Norway) to Paris (France….why do I have to say that?) via Stockholm and Copenhagen (just figure it out!) using the existing Flexifuel-providing gas station infrastructure. Another US giant, Opel, has a revolutionary working hybrid car for 2010. The Flextreme system, or E-flex, is a car that is 100% powered by an electric engine. The batteries are charged by a 1.3 liter turbo diesel engine that only starts when they are low. In this case, emissions again are lowered to incredible low levels. We already have the technology but will let Washington or Detroit waste billions in biofuels that are going to change our agricultural landscape, contribute to more deforestation across the world and therefore increase the Green house effect (i.e. Oil from Palm tree: forests in Indonesia harvested for the 25ct/gal B100 biodiesel). We have the exotic power but wrongly focus on hybrid cars. When the technology will become cheaper and most of the car on the roads will indeed be hybrids, what is going to happen to the batteries? A typical lead battery is made of 3 pounds of plastic, 1 gal of sulfuric acid, and 21 pounds of lead that mother earth has a hard time digesting. I know! We will ship them to deforested China, Africa, India or Bangladesh….along with our E-trash, anywhere but in our backyard! Stop driving main battle tanks and tell automakers to sell now and here what they build for Europe…that will do it for a while! Also, change your driving habits and save gas to lower both consumption and prices. Just do the right thing!

Nota: FSAF stands for Ford SAF (Societe Anonyme Francaise) and Opel is GM!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


At the end, is gender, race or party line going to be the only criteria for the People to figure out who is best suited to“save America”? (from what? The only recession I see have been“media induced”…gas is cheaper than anytime in 2k7, Christmas shopping was higher than 2k6–and just lower than expected-, house bubble was to burst for it was not a sustainable nor sane system and the one paying the price are many who bet on a quick money making turnover)

Am I a racist if I don’t vote Black?

Am I a misogynist pig if I don’t vote skirts? (oooops…pants for Billary…is she really a she? I thought she was the one with the pants on in the couple, and Bill the one with the pants….down! J)?

Am I a“senior hater”if I don’t vote McCain?

Should Oprah run so we would have a senior black female in one candidate? :-0

What about voting for the best qualified candidates? That would be new.

Tell you what: I would rather vote Obama over McCain or Billary! That is how bad it is….between three Democrats, I would give a shot to Obama because he looks good, sounds smart, promotes hard work and education among the Black community, reject self-pity and entitlement, and like any other Prez, would eventually realize what the real world looks like on Day one and go the necessary moderate conservative way. Oh….yes….and because I hate her!

The rest is just political rhetoric, fairy tales! You don’t really believe what they tell you, do you?

Billary…the Clintons? Are you kidding me…Billy Boy back in the house, Prez or unofficial VP in the shadow of the Mao suit wearing chipmunk? Alone with the pages and other Interns? Code Pink in the Lincoln bedroom for free? Tainted cigars and dirty carpet? No way. We had 8 years of it already.

McCain…a“social conservative”, too much to the left.

What would we get with a dem?

We would withdraw from the Middle East as already announced by the Democrats, Al Qaeda would be proclaimed a winner and would come back here for more butt kicking, more tax payers money would go to waste toward education, illegal immigration and some unrealistic socialized medicine reform while more billions would be wasted toward the greens-for-gas biofuel utopia: harvest trees and harvest crops for biofuel…increase global warming by cutting the trees (cf Indonesia and Malaysia destroying their Palm tree forest for a $0.25 / gal palm oil bio diesel!). We would surrender our guns and the military would be de-financed, and de-balled. All public building would be retrofitted with the third“not comfortable with your sex”bathroom like at Target. Like in Berzerkley, recruiting stations would be banned, and cities like San Franfreako would chose what Federal law to go with or not…Tell you what, I feel safer already!

I think we are going to have a lot of fun in the years to come…the campaign has already been really interesting, showing me, a foreign observer, the US democracy in action…vive la republique…


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Clintons are desperately resorting to negative politics now that they are losing ground to Obama. Give it a week or two and you will see Billary telling Obama that he is black (indeed he is) while he will reply to her that she is a woman (is she?). I love to watch the slug fest on the Democrat side. They claim so often that we are the bad guys…it is pure poetry to see over funded Democrats tearing down other over funded Democrats (with the money they spend destroying each other, they could have provided health care to a couple of hundred of thousands of their constituents J), making up destructive innuendos, resorting to dirty politics, using third party mouth pieces to do the dirty work, digging out and distorting things, slinging mud, belittling each other, suing each other in court to block voters from voting…I love to see Democrazy in action…(not to mistake with Democracy!). You guys are Bad!

Now that they have exposed their true colors, perverted the voting process, divided their electorate to better conquer, made Race an issue (Thank you Billy boy), promised more of my hard earned money for a medical scam, and told the enemy that if they are elected, America will officially be defeated in 2009 and will withdraw home to wait for another kick in the butt, (just to name a few items they preach), let us get ready to use it all and more against whoever is going to be their nominee!

If it is good to use by a Democrat against a Democrat, it is good for us against them too, right….So guys, out there, please lay low when McCain will take on the survivor of your social experiment.

The last piece, the candle on the cake, the star of the Christmas tree will be coming soon to us, delivered at home during their convention: are the Super-delegates going to follow the will of the people, and how! I can hardly wait to see how the Democrazyc process works!

Virgin Airlines, partnered with Boeing, is test flying the first biofuel powered jetliners running on a mixture of coconut and babassu oil (Palm tree nut). Recently, the Bee reported that the Palm forest in Indonesia was harvested to generate palm oil for a cheap Biodiesel. Open your eyes people. Biofuel is not the solution! Because of this new environmental hype and money making frenzy (a gallon of third world produced B100 biodiesel costs 25cts/gal) we are going to let the world’s agricultural landscape change to profit the fuel making crops on top of encouraging the harvesting of natural forests. Short term, money is flowing. Long term, the whole process will contribute to more desertification and an increase of the Green House effect. Your Hybrid car is not the solution either! Green European Turbo Diesel cars get the same mileage for half the price! Furthermore, a typical lead battery is made of 3 pounds of plastic, one gal of sulfuric acid, and 21 pounds of lead. How about recycling yours? Would it make everybody feel better if they were sent to the soon to be desert third world, along with our E-trash, asbestos- laden ships to salvage, bio-hazard trash, etc, etc…


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Letter from Africa.

Sudan has been under pressure to clean its Human right records in its Darfur province. Still, despite a permanent state of civil war, the country that has once been in the US sights for having hosted Bin Laden and terrorist camps, has shown a 10% growth in 2005 and 2006. How can a mostly war torn and dirt poor country come up with such an economic growth? Sudan, the biggest country of the continent, possesses one fifth of the proven oil reserves of Africa and oil concessions have been awarded over half of the country. Three active one in the South, already provide half of the Sudanese total output that is sold to China (40%), Malaysia (30%), and India (25%). Most of these concessions are still unexploited and many are located in the Shamal Darfur area, north of the long neglected, drought and famine plagued desert Darfur province. In Sudan, thanks to oil, the longest lasting civil war of the continent ceased in 2005 after the death of 2 million and millions of refugees. Since the 1956 independence, the South, mostly black and Christian, have fought for auto-determination. To break from international isolation imposed by America after 9-11, and to exploit the Asian thirst for oil, the central Muslim government brokered a successful peace agreement with the Southern rebels and created a National Union government while opening a path to a greater autonomy of the South by promising a referendum in 2011. In Darfur, North West of the country, because of inter ethnic tensions (Arabs vs. non Arabs) and the unwillingness of the central government to redistribute wealth and develop the area, two local rebel groups chose the armed struggle in 2003 (The Sudanese Liberation Army -SLA- and the Justice and Equality Movement–JEM-). The government has since been using an Arab militia called the Janjaweed to fight them and in four years, more than 1600 villages have been burnt, looted, population displaced, raped, slaughtered. 200.000 dead, 150 to 200.000 refugees in neighboring Chad and Central African Republic…is this a genocide? While Western politicians and bureaucrats discuss to figure out if it is (the conflict is not just ethnic or religious but historical, political and economic), people die, unprotected by the U.N. African-only interposition force sent there because the West bought the threats of a massive and global Jihad if white“crusaders”(i.e. soldiers of Peace) were sent to“invade”(i.e. interpose, help, protect) yet another Muslim country. Eventually, when the conflict spilled over to neighboring Chad (recently oil rich too), the European Community decided to deploy its forces that are now about to secure the Chad/Darfur border along with the refugee camps that are also being raided. When poor countries, money, oil, and politics mix, the poorest die! In the meantime, not only China is the preferred customer, but China is also providing all the necessary military hardware to Khartoum, the capital, so the country–and its oil- can be secured. Is it why America is so silent?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Ghosts of the Capitol
Do you remember last year when the redistricting bill was lost between the Senate and the assembly in Sacramento, and only resurfaced when it was too late to add it to the 2008 ballot? That redistricting bill was specifically written to balance the Perata-Nunez sponsored term limit bill that contains a special clause that would actually extend their term (both should be termed out in 2008)! Exposed, the two manipulators were“forced”to also support a redistricting bill in exchange of running theirs. Unfortunately, for some“obscure”and unexplained reason, one bill made it while the other got lost long enough to be disqualified for the February ballot. The Indian Compacts disappearance issue that has recently been uncovered is the 2008“Encore”provided by the career scam artists that run the state. It was recently reported by a major media that after our Governator had approved the Indian Gaming compacts, he had the paperwork sent to the Californian Secretary of State’s office for quick processing. The US secretary of the Interior is the next step and has 45 days to review the deal and accept or reject it in view of pros and cons, opposition build up, etc…Once these 45 days are over without an outcome, Federal law says that the compacts gain automatic approval. Well, guess what? In this charmed time of tooth fairies and red fat man delivering toys, the paperwork was allegedly“misplaced”for about 80 days before it miraculously re-appeared in the in-box of some“big-feathered-wig”at Indian Affairs. Basically, it seems that the compacts have already been ratified and published in some Federal register, and the tribes are already preparing to challenge the voters if the compacts are rejected. In the meantime, Prop 94, 95, 96, and 97 are still in the February Ballot for us to ratify, or not (“to confirm by expressing consent, approval…” ). They offer to increase State and local government revenues by allowing four tribe operated casinos to increase their number of slot machines by the thousands in exchange of millions of dollars in pay back to be deposited in General Fund. Are we going to waste our votes on a done deal? If we listen to our Governor, he does not really know. He stated that he was not aware that once published, the compacts would become valid even if the good people of California voted against them. But he also told us a year ago that the budget deficit was all gone, vanished, puuuufff, just like the redistricting bill and the Indian compacts. Talk about the ghosts of the capitol! They all reappeared after a while and without any explanations! And now they haunt us! How come our beloved legislators never go puuuuf, disappear for good? Just think of it: a day without the Capitol, a day without representation! You are right….we already have it, almost everyday. In February, let’s show them that we are not stupid!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Are our legislators wasting our time? ABX1–the Democratic leadership’s health measure for uninsured Californians- has just been killed by one part of our legislature, after having been passed by the Assembly Health Committee . It was filled with holes, over-optimistic, under-funded and plain crazy. Furthermore, five of the seven propositions in the upcoming ballot are done deals. 91 closes a financial loophole….that has already been closed. 94 to 97 ratify Gaming Compacts already approved at Federal level. To top it up, 93 is the shameless self serving Nunez-Perata term extension bill and 92 another money shell game. Furthermore, last year, the redistricting bill (crafted to balance the Nunez-Perata scam) disappeared during the approval process and only re-appeared too late to be added to the February ballot. Also, the Compacts got Federal approval after escaping the scrutiny of the The US secretary of the Interior by“disappearing”far beyond the 45 days evaluation limit and re-appearing in time to be approved. I have monitored the democratic process of some third world countries. They would have put California to shame! But who care? We just get the governments we deserve.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In the Navy, Nuclear submarines are the most critical pieces of the inventory because they are totally part of our nuclear deterrence policy. The latest subs have top secret propulsion systems, top secret power plants, top secret communication devices, etc, etc.

Is the Navy paranoid, no! Our deterrence is based on the fact that our submarines are 24/7 cruising the bottom of the ocean, undetected and undetectable, and permanently able to carry a huge nuclear strike, offensive or defensive, on any enemy. MAD, mutual assured destruction! If you hit me, I will still have the power to destroy you thanks to the stealth of my submarines, and to their nuclear payload.
In order for the deterrence to work, our nuclear vector carriers need indeed to be stealthy, undetectable. Everything has a“signature”nowadays. It could be the cavitations created by a propeller, the specific humming of a power plant, the burst transmission of a radio message, the water displacement…
In order for these vital characteristics to be kept secret, well, they need to be classified, and critical pieces of equipment kept away from satellites or people who can take pictures, film or record them. 

The USS Virginia is one of our latest nuclear submarines, the crème de la crème. It has been around for about a decade already, or more, and sports such a revolutionary propeller that grants him stealth and credibility...
Because this propeller has a specific design that allows the sub to move undetected from surface ships during its stealthy patrols around the world, it is common for the Navy to“wrap”it up when the submarine comes to dry docks after a mission. Actually, the wrapping of top secret technology has been a common procedure since World War 2, since the two major powers had started to junk space with spy satellites.

Dan Twohig is a lucky guy, because he discovered something that could have cost him his life in China or North Korea. He lives in North Bend in Washington State, about 25 miles from Seattle. Sick of his commute, he was looking for a closer place to move in last June, and stumbled upon top secret military technology while scrolling over Seattle using Microsoft Virtual Earth program, an application pretty similar to Google earth. The picture is a 2003 caption of the USS Virginia on dry dock at the Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor in Washington State, also known for housing the largest nuclear weapons arsenal, the Strategic Weapons Facility Pacific. On this picture, depicted for all to zoom in, lays the sub with its unwrapped high tech propeller. Dan, a marine buff, posted it on his blog and the news took off and spread on the Internet.
So much for top secrecy, naval deterrence, and trust on your government to do the right thing to protect you!

These applications that allow you to“virtually fly over”towns and country are a blessing for all the bad guys.
With such a detailled picture, I can figure out point of entry, security, targets, vulnerabilities…I am not a terrorist, so you are fine.
Tomorrow, I can follow you home, get your address, pull out an aerial view of your house, zoom in, and figure out point of entry, security, targets, vulnerabilities for my next home invasion, or to steal the nice Ferrari or the Lexus you were driving…but I am not a robber, so don’t fear me.
How do you like to have everybody and his sister able to peek in your backyard, zoom-in on your house, pull you credit history and interest payments, our Nuclear secrets? I don’t feel good at all.

Just take a look at the pictures and detailed floor plan and financial information on your house www.zillow.com  
And by the way….the sub is still there for our pleasure! Can you believe it?

Have a nice day and sleep tight. Big brother is looking after you.

Democracy in action.
Recently, ABC decided for us which candidate was TV worthy and Kucinich filed a complaint with the FCC. In Vegas, the Billary’s camp sued to prevent Casino workers from voting because they support Obama. In Nevada, a mini encore of the Bush-Gore election, Billary harvested the most votes while Obama got the delegates. In California, five of the seven propositions in the upcoming ballot are done deals. 91 closes a financial loophole….that is already closed. 94 to 97 ratify Gaming Compacts already approved at Federal level, and the tribes are ready to sue if they are rejected at the ballot box. 93 is the Nunez-Perata term extension bill (no comment) and 92 another money shell game. Furthermore, last year, the redistricting bill that was crafted to balance the Nunez-Perata scam disappeared during the approval process and only re-appeared too late to be added to the February ballot. The Compacts got Federal approval after escaping the scrutiny of the The US secretary of the Interior…they just“disappeared”far beyond the 45 days evaluation limit and re-appeared in time to be approved. Now I know why we vote on Tuesdays. Why waste a weekends? 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I love third world politics.

2008 just started and the so familiar looking paperwork is already here announcing yet another whole set of ballot issues our deep pocketed and incompetent legislators want us to make a decision on. I opened it and was surprised to discover that it was missing the pages containing the full text for propositions 94 to 97. But don&apos;t worry! A separate supplemental ballot guide has also been printed...and might be delivered before absentee ballots are mailed…or after. The four propositions are related to Indian compacts and offer to triple the number of slot machines the four richest Indian tribes on earth are operating in Southern California. You already know how much the State is going to benefit from such a deal, so I won’t go there nor promote the legalization of State run prostitution for profit. But I still wonder why would the State want us to ratify (“to confirm by expressing consent, approval…” ) a prior agreement? Are we wasting our votes on a done deal? It was recently reported by a major media that after our Governator had approved the compacts, he had the paperwork sent to the Californian Secretary of State’s office for quick processing. The US secretary of the Interior is the next step and has 45 days to review the deal and accept or reject it in view of pros and cons, opposition build up, etc…Once these 45 days are over without an outcome, Federal law says that the compacts gain automatic approval. Well, guess what? In this charmed time of tooth fairies and red fat man delivering toys, the paperwork was allegedly“misplaced”for about 80 days before it miraculously re-appeared in the in-box of some“big-feathered-wig”at Indian Affairs….Basically, it seems that the compacts have already been ratified and published in some Federal register, and the tribes are already getting ready to challenge the voters if the compacts are rejected. Do you remember when the redistricting bill was lost between the two chambers in Sacramento last year, and only resurfaced when it was too late to add it to the 2008 ballot? The redistricting bill was specifically written to balance the Perata-Nunez sponsored term limit bill that contains a special clause that would actually extend their term (both should be termed out in 2008)! Exposed, they were“forced”to also support a redistricting bill in exchange of running theirs. The Compact issue is the 2008“Encore”provided by the career scam artists that run the state. Third world politics: bills appear and disappear, rotten politicians strive, and bribes flow.

We know all about the corruption in Sacramento, and how the State’s credit card is &quot;maxed up&quot;, its interest rates through the roof and credit down the tube. So maybe it is finally time for“We”, the voting tax payers to make it clear and loud once and for all at the ballot box: we are not stupid, we don’t buy it anymore and stop milking us! Use common sense and do what is right!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Do the right thing: shut up and pay! 

I am so sick of rewarding the bad behaviors of the few, up and down, left and right. It looks like there is no accountability, no personal responsibility anymore….it is always somebody else’s fault, never mine. And I always end up footing part of the bill!
When we think war, torture, or health care, we go in a bipartisan mode. The way our Union is set up with the balance of powers between the Executive, the Legislative and the judicial, We, the people are supposed to be the power, directly or not. Instead, we are complacent, elect them and trust their lies…they never knew, they don’t support, they don’t agree, oh my! Pelosi and torture, the Reps and global warming…you name it! While the two big parties take turns to rule and fill their pockets, we just sleep, all ritalined up to our noses, giving away our power and responsibilities! We let the few milk us and we reward them with our souls. 

When we think New Orleans, we think Katrina and about fifty thousand people who stayed despite the warnings, encouraged by the inertia of the local administrations (a conservative Republican candidate was elected governor afterwards…How do you explain that?) We know the results, the deaths, the lootings, murders and rapes, the guilt trip, and the“charity”still going on almost three years later, on our dime. Just compare it to the recent fires in Southern California with about 750,000 people self evacuated, FEMA told they were not needed, 10,000 refugees–already forgotten- in a clean stadium for two weeks of solidarity, everybody un-entitled and just dealing with the drama, on their own. Think about Florida and its hurricanes and regular evacuation of the coast by the thousands. Think of the Northwest and winter disasters…no moaning and no looting…nada! We have let the few milk us and we rewarded them with our money... 

When we think credit cards, we think of Americans living“in the red”with debts in the tens of thousands of dollars, spent equity and filed bankruptcies. Wrong! Not only it seems that the majority of U.S. households have no credit card debt but according to the Federal Reserve, about 30 percent of them pay off their balances monthly. Compare it to the mere 8.3 percent of households that owe $10,000 or more on their cards (MSN Money), or the few without home or car insurances, with Emergency Room as the healthcare provider, with frivolous lawsuits…Somebody must pay for them or protect oneself from them, right?. Again, we let the few milk us and we bail them out with our generosity…and indirect taxes by the Feds, the State, financial institutions, higher fees.  

Think of the“.com”(dot com) bubble from 1997 to 2001! It was the over evaluation of the stock of thousands of companies with the same business model competing for the same services. California piled up–and spent- billions, believing that this new economic model would never collapse.2001 saw the“.com burst”that possibly turned real estate into the only place left for speculators to invest in. Politicians pledged they will never get caught again and will save every extra income instead of spending it….Mea Culpa. At the same time, their pockets filled with lavish gifts from mortgage companies, they killed bills designed to safeguard the lending industry and prevent“predatory loans”and Subprime mortgages. The Housing bubble started. People were easily convinced that they deserved a house, even when poor, with bad credit and no money down. Buyers thought home equity was a pile of cash in the attic, something one uses and does not to pay back, like bonds (???). And again California piled up–and spent- billions. And again when the bubble collapsed, politicians claimed innocence while passing yet more unbalanced budgets. They gave each other raises and paid off the special interest groups and other unions before telling us that we are in a 7 billion hole…duh no, make it 14 billions…and that it is going to hurt! Us? The same us that always try to do the right thing, are never bailed out but always taped, you and me, working our sorry behind off to make ends meet? 

Don’t you think that common sense, laws, and morals are just inconveniences for law abiding, god fearing people who always try to do the right thing? I do. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We were 7, than 10 and now $14 billions in the hole. How much more next?
But who is counting? Obviously not the State!
Furthermore, the Bee also reported that billions in contractual pension plans for State workers were never funded, but are owed!
Arnold also promised not to raise Taxes and here they come...the state grew...its expenses too...hot issues are thrown at &quot;the people&quot; for them to vote on (half of the people polled recently did not know bonds must be repaid!)...bonds are a way to pay the bills...
I have been here long enough to understand that deep pockets are tailored in legislators’suits while mine must be kept inside out so every penny can subsidize utopian or self serving pet project.
Is there anybody up there, or out there? Anybody???ere is what is going to happen next year: more taxes, more bonds, more raises for unionized power groups while we, the tax payers, will be working our behind off,. Furthermore, every dollar we will earn will be less valuable than the previous one, and already earmarked for some crazy wasteful irresponsible project. Great! Cannot wait!
We are in the hole but that does not prevent State official from granting each others raises, nor prison guard from getting a 7.5% raise...After all, who is counting? As long as we have taxpayers, we have money, right?
2008...bonds for transportation, bullet train, bonds to cover the debt, price of gas going up, countries switching to the Euros and great depression like inflation here, tobacco taxes (already done?), car tax, Internet sales tax, yard sale tax, children lemonade stand tax, wood fire fines in Sac county, universal health care (I pay for the uninsured for my car, why not for health care...and we could also create a mandatory program so taxpayers would have to adopt a retired state worker, move him/her in his house and pay for his/her care and expenses...car too…)…


I am also supposed to switch to the“curly”light bulbs to save the earth while–to save money- the State is considering the release of 22,000 offenders in our streets (time to buy a couple of guns and lots of ammos?)…makes sense!
I don’t know anymore. Is it in the air, the water, the food??? What are they on? Should State worker and legislators be tested for common sense impairment drugs?
Here is what I foresee for 2008: I am going to sell my house (still tons of equity), take my family, my four cars, my skills, my wife’s registered business, all our volunteer work, our incomes, savings, bank accounts, credit cards, perfect credit, taxes, car insurances, purchases, direct and indirect contributions, etc…and move them someplace else where we won’t be milked dry.
And unless there is HOPE (and I see none), more like me are going to do it…we will leave behind the illiterates, the unemployed by choice, the illegal, the married gay couple, the 22,000 criminals and other unions, the uninsured, The Indian“sovereign”nation meddling with State’s policies, its casinos, the bankrupt, the bribers and the“Bribees”, Aids and TB in the rise, the homeless and the welfare addicted…
From far away, we will see how the State is going to tax them! That is going to be entertaining, so fun!
I have been here 9 years...that is how long it took me to lose faith.
Good job! Well done!
Whatever…
I hope the legislature is going to enjoy the emission credits provided by Fabian Nunez…after all, they are what they are, the expression of a loophole that allows gross polluters to keep on polluting instead of investing money into cleaning up their emissions.
Basic economics: they still exist because it is cheaper to buy them to pollute than to modernize!
Basic hypocrisy: by maintaining the system of emission credits, we actually make sure that the gross polluters will never invest in clean air.
Basic corruption: who is behind the scheme? How much did it pay?
Basic showbiz distractive effect: look at me, look at me (Fabian!)?
And I am supposed to change my light bulbs,,,,right!
Anyways, like all the State employees, rain or shine, it is the Holiday recess…a couple of weeks?
More at Christmas, for the teachers, than for me in a whole year? Right again!
On my dime….RIGHT AGAIN!!!!! 

Merry Christmas.

I wonder how the place of“higher learning”that UC Davis claims to be is going to fit its“more diversity for more equality”concept in the famous line from Martin Luther King’s speech“I have a dream”. In the name of social engineering and to find new ways to divert money from classrooms programs to promote the new American dream of victimhood and entitlement, they have written the next chapter of the book on how to destroy America as one nation. Let’s offer a new translation to that great speech that had no room for affirmative action:“I have a dream that my children will live in a nation where they will be judged by the color of their skin and by their ethnic group of origin, whether they come from Vietnam, the high plains or China, whether they come from Ghana or Morocco, Iran or Turkey, whether they are non White Hispanic from Mexico or San Salvador, whether they are Pacific Islanders, African Americans or Native Americans from the Thunder Valley, the Jackson Rancheria or Cache Creeks tribes…(list in not inclusive. European countries don‘t apply).”What about promoting the concept of hard work?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What to call people who believe that bonds are money trees that bloom billions? What to call people still ignoring that taxes make the state&apos;s largest revenue and that education is the biggest spender? What name to call adults who were made to believe that owning a house is a right, even without money, with bad credit, no past and a foreclosed future? Again, and again, everything goes back to EDUCATION, morons! With EDUCATION, you know your history, know the meaning of Memorial Day or why you should celebrate Ocho Di Mayo and not Cinco. With civic EDUCATION, you learn who you are, where you belong, what to stand for when you claim that you are American, how it works and why it should be protected. With EDUCATION, you don&apos;t need sexual harassment lawsuit nor loitering fines because you learn to respect the other and your country. Are we witnessing the results of two decades of failed policies applied by the politically correct and equalitarian moron factories called schools? Maybe people should take a test before voting, a control of their knowledge on the issues. But that would not be nice to the morons, would it?

The Folsom City October’s Newsletter stressed the need for water conservation, echoing California’s demand for a more responsible use of a limited resource. For that purpose, meters are being imposed on residents to prevent“waste”despite the fact that any possible“waste”(run off waters) will eventually flow back to the river anyway, and go south to be sold so deserts can bloom and artificial lakes can be filled in Palm Springs or Riverside. Let me think about it! I pay for my water and whatever runs off or is eventually re-treated, comes back to me to be billed again, or is sold to the South…limited resource and unlimited income! That is the ultimate scheme because the more I waste of the same water, the more I can be billed for it…But will it solve the supply problem (of water, not money)? Another solution offered to us is to switch back to the water-saver toilets…you know! The one you must flush two to three times…unless you process dry pellets like a rabbit! Let’s replace our oversized efficient water-guzzling bowls for new water saving models that treat a better“incheage”per gallon of water. Let’s buy bricks! That is a good idea too…but will it solve the supply problem?“Reducing our consumption is responsible stewardship of our rivers and it benefits the entire region”said a Utilities Department Engineer, who also claimed that people actually realize how much they use once they pay for it! It sounds all good to me but somewhere my cynicism tells me that there is more to the conservation-billing-selling issue than saving mother earth and raising my awareness on the daily waste of our modern society. Dig out the dirt, the lack of planning by our elected officials throughout time! We have a cake, our regular water supply provided by Mother Nature through winter snow and rain falls. We have the users of the cake, mostly farmers and urban dwellers. We have an unequal repartition in California with most of the supplies here, in Norcal, and most of the users south, in the Central Valley and the ever growing big cities. We also have an increasing unplanned population. And remember….the cake is still the same….but every year the thirst grows! Global warming is a good scapegoat for everybody, but what about the impact of the housing boom on our reserves? Just in the past four years, how many houses have been built? How many more people, bathrooms, swimming pools, sinks and water heaters, lawns, dish washing, flushes, and drains? Our threatened Californian water supply has already lost about one million acre feet of reserve and we add more consumption to whatever is left! It does not make any sense, does it? Build more dams they also say…that would fix it? But will it solve the supply problem? What are the new dams going to fill up with? We would just end up with the same resources split between different storage areas. Recently, the media reported a one time event in Georgia that has been plagued by the worst drought ever since 1986: the desperate governor and her staff were finally taking it to God almighty, praying together at church, for the rain to come and save their constituents left with a mere 60 days of water supplies -especially in the five million residents Atlanta area served by an almost dry lake-. The poor governor had already done everything she could, from imposing drastic water conservation measures to reducing the water distribution to Alabama and Florida, and condemning protected species of mussels. Many years of unplanned growth have actually led to that incurable current situation. And now what? What can be the next step, if any? In California, the nanny, like the Horn of Plenty, is getting dry, her now sagging breast finally sore from the estimated 37 million thirsty and often wasteful mouths that are mercilessly sucking them dry (26% of the Californians were born abroad). Sacramento legislators might recommend a silicon implant to restore the figure of our aging lady, but that would never replace the milk, would it? The desalinization of the Pacific or the melting of the world’s fading iceberg resources could also solve the supply problem. And than, what? Planning and adaptation of the growth to the available infrastructure and resources? That would be revolutionary and innovative! That would also not be nice to the millions who still want to come live here while the grass is greener, the houses nicer, the laws friendlier, etc, etc…The control of water will be a major reason for war in the decades to come. Turkey, for example, is currently damming the sources of major rivers that feed other belligerent countries. Again, the war between the“have”and the“have not”! What about California in forty years: the North vs. the South? Make good choices!

Pakistan leader to quit army this month 

Benazir Bhutto is no hero nor Democrat, nor salvation for Pakistan. She has been kicked out of two governments already for corruption. The main charges have been presented by the Swiss government (money laundering) and by Poland (bribes in a tractor deal). Other documented corruption cases were related to shady deals with France (bribes in a fighter plane deal) and the Middle East (gold smuggling). Interestingly, she only came out of exile recently and was a guest at the White House in January 2007. After the Red Mosque massacre, in Pakistan, the world media made her a contender for a power sharing government to &quot;humanize&quot; the dictatorship of Musharraf! Nice plot guys, but in a typical self serving and long term thinking middle Eastern way, she has out-played her handlers in D.C and the scheme just blew up in America&apos;s face with Lady &quot;10%&quot; (actually the nickname of her husband) now seeking full power, backed up by Islamists parties (also self serving long term thinkers) that usually place women between the dog and the pig in their society. We feared Iran and its future nukes? Just wait for the collapse of Pakistan!

$9.8 billion hole seen in state budget

After extra months of“labor”to cash extra Per Diem income and deliver a late“balanced”budget, state officials first task was to quickly raise their salaries, the salaries of their cronies and other special interest groups such as the prison guards or University staff, before telling us, boo hoo, that the budget is already in the red and that &quot;All the easy solutions are gone&quot;…for us taxpayers?

What on earth has happened to all the direct and indirect windfalls of four years of housing boom? After the dot.com disaster, legislators have pledged to save the money generated by extraordinary rewarding circumstances in order to have it to pay for unexpected downfalls…Shame on you for spending like drunken sailors and helping yourself with our money! Shame on us for letting it happen, year after year, one of their raises at a time, at the price of yet another increase of our taxes. Let us save money and start with our“rulers”! The 2007 California Piglet Book (look it up on the Internet) accounts for more than $3 billion of waste such as $300.000 each for six non-functioning multilingual toilets in L.A. or Pet Care benefits for Shasta county employees. Are you mad yet?

Nancy Peligrosa is willing to risk the US already delicate situation in Iraq in the name of the appeasement of a powerful Armenian lobby that has been pushing again and again for the recognition by the US of the Armenian genocide conducted by the Ottoman Empire about a hundred years ago. Turkey is a critical NATO partner and a much more critical ally in the war in Iraq. The US uses Turkey as a rear logisitic base for its supply and air lift operations. One third of the fuel used by our military transits through Turkey 9so much for the people who claim we went in for Iraqi oil!). Angered by the Democrat led effort to officially recognize the genocide, Turkey is threatening to stop any active support to the US for the war in Iraq, review its position within the NATO alliance, and, worth of all, move into the Kurdish part of Iraq to conduct a retaliatory strike against the Kurd terrorist group (PKK) that has become emboldened by the US support for the Kurds in Iraq and resumed attacks against Turkey’s military (just slaughtered 13 border guards). If the resolution on the genocide passes, the Democrats will be responsible for breaking whatever balance exist in Northern Iraq, pushing the Turkish military into conducting military action against one of the active American ally in the war against terrorism in Iraq. The US government will have tough choices because of Nancy’s catering to her lobbyists: side with the Kurds or with Turkey, or jeopardize its military operations in Northern Iraq, or jeopardize NATO’s Southern flank, right when Putin is taking all the steps to resume the cold war.

The genocide has happened and has been recognized by many nations already. Genocide should not be encouraged and should be denounced…but is it the right time? The risk are so high for the future of America’s war in Iraq, NATO, the region…If the resolution passes and the situation goes as predicted (Turkey banning US operations from within its borders, military incursion in Northern Iraq, NATO loss of its Southern flank), the Democrat will bear the responsibility of the total collapse of that region of the world, our war effort, and NATO coalition.

Way to go! I wonder what Billary-ous and Osama are thinking of this backstabbing?

The convoy could have been seen anywhere in Washington D.C. Four to five black armored SUVs with tinted bulletproof windows zooming in and out of traffic with flashing lights on…a VIP and its secret service escort! The only visible difference from the video made from inside the third vehicle is the place. Streets are mostly dirt roads crowded with the unruly traffic of everything and anything, from donkey carts to overloaded buses, mid size cars and two-wheelers. Buildings are sun-bleached third world country looking and sidewalks are crowded. Men also wear robes. The place is Baghdad, Iraq, and today, again, like so many times, a high value target is being convoyed from A to B with armed security contractors in charge of its protection. The video–downloaded from the Internet, something you will never been shown by the major media outlets- shows a chaotic and swarming environment, and the nervous sound bites of the alert armed men in charge of the security can be heard in the background. Suddenly, the roar of an explosion covers all noises and the SUV ahead seems like it has been crushed by a side blow. It crumple and skids sideways across the street, smoldering. The windshield of the car the video is made from cracks. Gunfire can be heard and the bulletproof windows are hit. Security contractors scream…”floor it”,“pass the wreck”,“go, go, go!”The SUV speeds up, bypasses the now burning car, hitting it in the process and spinning it with their colleagues and friends most likely dead within. The car rushes through a busy cross road and catches up with the first SUV of the convoy. While taking evading actions, the security detail returns fire in the general direction where the RPG or roadside bomb attack, and small arms fire came from.

This is an almost regular day for these civilian contractors we call mercenaries, security personnel in charge of the protection of people and facilities in the war zones the US has been involved in.

In February 2007 it was estimated that about 800 civilians contracted to the Pentagon have been killed and more than 3,300 wounded. We also remember the fate some of them endured and how their bodies have been desecrated, dragged behind pickup trucks, slashed and sliced, burnt and hung from a bridge.  

A mercenary is 1. One who serves or works merely for monetary gain, or, 2. A professional soldier hired for service in a foreign army. What is the difference between these security contractors working for private security entities, and let say, the TSA that has been contracted to secure our airports, your security guard standing in guard at the entrance of your gated community, or the armed security officer patrolling around our office at night. Are they really mercenaries? What about a H1 visa employee? Is he/she some kind of mercenary?

Again, asymmetric warfare is at work with the recent Blackwater scandal and its alleged shooting of civilians. Suddenly,“collateral damages”are new and innocent civilian casualties are newsworthy? What has happened in DC and at the headquarters of our major biased media outlets?

Since the beginning, since Somalia, we have been fighting an enemy that has commonly used civilian has a human shield, kids to pick up under fire the arms of its fallen fighters, women to push forward while firing weapons from under their arms, hospitals, Mosques, cemeteries and schools to fire weapons from, crowded places to conduct attacks from. Since the beginning, the enemy has been given a free pass by everybody, even the most vocal anti-war and anti-Blackwater groups and individuals. The enemy can hide in civvies, act among crowds, mutilate civilians and non-combatants for no other reason but religious intolerance and hatred, and get away with it, often with various“badges of honor”such as the“freedom fighter”title. And since the beginning of this politically correct war on terror, our side has been paralyzed, blamed for everything, accused tried, convicted…If the new rule out there is that you cannot shoot back in the general direction of the enemy to accomplish your mission or just save your life…you are right! Let’s get the hell out of there and save what we can of the last real man this country has. We are going to need them here to stand against this suicidal fuzzy-woozy liberal junk that is spreading out like the plague and killing us as a nation. Most of the time the civilians that end up being the so-called“collateral damages”are whether unwilling victims unaware of an imminent attack, threatened to act normal, or indifferent passer-bys that see the armed men in position, the RPGs, the ambush, and just hang around to see how it will end up, and maybe take part of some good old corpse dragging and mutilating afterwards! I am not advocating the shooting of unarmed civilians, of course, but forever, I have been advocating the fighting of these stupid wars like we meant to win them. The TV series“The War”reminded us of Dresden, Tokyo, Manila, Berlin, Nagasaki, Hiroshima…Civilians always pay the highest price in war. Should have we spared them all in the forties, and lost the wars? Would the world be a better place now with an allied defeat in WW2? Caesar took over Rome. On his way to the coffer room a Senator stopped him and in the name of the freedom of speech granted to him by the Republic, told him he was not allowed to take any money. Caesar replied that war had no need for freedom of speech. He also added“Speak again and I kill you. I need the money to fight in Spain”, and concluded with a“It is hard for me to threaten you, harder that it would be for me to actually kill you!”(Plutarch fall of the Roman Republic) Hail Caesar!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


“The war”is not about the minority groups that fought in World War two. It presents as many live testimonies as possible from the survivors of a disappearing generation. In the name of some twisted notion of diversity and entitlement, the documentary is called biased because soldiers of Hispanic origins that made the biggest fighting minority of the US Army don’t have the second biggest“air time”in the movie. This is not affirmative action and nowhere is it written that anything that is displayed, filmed or written should embrace every single thin skinned citizen that makes the angry fabric of our society. What is next? The Gay community is going to call for a boycott of the movie, women, Italians, war dogs? What about the proud 442nd Regimental Combat Team of the United States Army, a unit uniquely composed of Japanese Americans who fought in Europe and never got reparations? Maybe the“Latino”community–and others- should make their own documentary to preserve their heritage. I made my mind up and won’t watch“The war”because it completely ignores the US soldiers from French ancestry. I know racism when I see it and this is as anti-French as it could be!

Tell me what you drive!

My part of Oak Avenue Parkway has become the most recent victim of the Band Aid gang that has already patched so much black top around our town, Northern California, and the State. My commuting road was so familiar to me, uniformly faded by the sun, with grass growing in its cracks delimiting the lanes and making up for the lack of paint markers. But no patches! Some ups and downs, some rattling, some shaking, some wiggling, but no bumpy patches!

Until a couple of weeks ago! For some reason, a Band Aid agency showed up with orange cones and started to cut squares and rectangles, L or T shaped sizes, here and there, according to a design and obscure reasons they were the only one to know. The backhoe, replacing an obviously missing compacter, drove back and forth on the filler without much success while a finisher stood ready for the touch up, the final black top layer. Now, my grassy little stretch of road has become even more like the rest of our roadways: randomly patched and bumpier.

I drive small…just because my first–and last- American car was a SUV made by Ford! You must remember the late nineties series of Exploder, do you? They were literally pieces of junk on under-pressured Firestone tires, plagued by roll over and recalls.

 Anyways, it takes small cars to realize that American roadways have been designed for big trucks, SUVs (Sport Utility Vehicles), SUTs (Sport Utility Trucks), SLUTs (Sport Light Utility Trucks) and other SHUTUPs (Sport Hybrid Utility Trucks Unlimited Power), or Minivans. Or maybe it is the other way around…I am not sure! Maybe it takes bad roads to realize that small cars are not welcomed and that huge trucks are necessary. When you drive small, you can sense how uneven the roads are, even the new one. A simple pot-hole makes you feel like you are going to lose a wheel or tear your front end. Add to that all the junk that is always encountered, mostly on freeways, and yes, you understand why big cars still have a future in the US. I drove everywhere from Tahoe to Monterey in my little 10 by 5 feet 43 years old Fiat (have you seen Luigi, in Cars?). A palette on the freeway seemed like a building to me; a bouncing rock like a falling mountain, a pot hole like a crater my car was the plug for. Sure, the little size allowed the zigging and zagging around the obstacles, while staying in a single lane, mind you. But at the end of the day, a 200 mile trip ended up being 300 for the extra distance caused by the extra swerving. Defensive driving they rightly call it! Defensive indeed….for lack of any other option but to buy giant wheels like everybody else to make up for the road conditions, to accommodate ever enlarging drivers and passengers, to make up for bad driving skills, and -some also say- for lack of personal confidence and to compensate substandard mojos.

The Smart is coming next year! It is a small zippy car made by Mercedes-Benz and Swatch, sporting an 800cc engine, and built as tough as a Nascar race car (don’t take my word for it and go see the actual 70 mph crash tests on Youtube)….and the Smart is already condemned because our roadways and urban streets are in such state of disrepair and because the the average American derriere won’t fit its European sized seats!

Take San Francisco as an example! Have you ever driven away from the tourist attraction area? Just try Mission and drive it from the financial district to the 101…you literally need a tracked vehicle to go there!

Anyways….the choices are ours:

-         bouncy uncomfortable defensive driving in small fuel efficient commuters or offensive driving in huge gas guzzlers mounted on fat wheels

-         laughable patched roadways re-sprayed with liquid tar from time to time or real fat black topped surfaces made with the right equipment and technology that can build flawless smooth landing strips for airports

What is it going to be? We already know the answer, don’t we? Ford and GM know how to build smaller cars that are highly fuel efficient for the European market. But as long as they can sell here bigger ticket items, why would they bother with low priced, small-margin, reliable and cheap cars? The technology is also here to build decent roads but for some reason we are cheap and resort to companies that don’t use the right equipment the right way and we lack the long term planning that could avoid the ruining of new surface streets to provide for some overseen sewage or electrical underground passages (but what do I know: I just spent 10 years of my life in the road construction industry!).

My heroes are the small cars drivers that get out everyday amidst angry driving monsters. My heroes are the few bicycle riders that try to commute everyday to a nearby job without being killed by“offensive”drivers when they cross a road. My heroes are the Crossing Guards that literally jump in front of high speed traffic to secure a safe passage to the other side for our kids, despite the cars that still try to sneak in any possible opening.

Tell me what you drive and I will tell you who you are and you how you drive!

9-11

In the Horn of Africa, a desert country is suffering from what could amount to crimes against humanity. Villagers are brutalized by governmental troops, women gang raped, civilians killed for no other reason than being at the wrong place at the wrong time, houses and huts burnt to the ground. The culprit is Ethiopia and its American backed government ruling over a dirt poor country of 77 million souls! We train and arm its armies, provide them with intelligence so Islamic movements can be rooted out of the region (especially Somalia), and we also conveniently ignore the exactions that have been committed there since 1994. Ethiopia is a country that is becoming more and more violent and Ogaden is the province where the exactions are committed to prevent its secession, and to punish its people for the armed activities of the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF). Deemed as terrorists because they resorted to violence after their failure to secede legally by following a process provided by the constitution, the soldiers of the ONLF have been blamed for bombings and murders, for the recent attack on an oil field and capture of 9 Chinese workers. Nice! And even nicer when you know that all these government led abuses are paid by US taxpayers in the name of some twisted political alliance against people that are supposed to be worse. Last year, we gave Ethiopia almost $300 millions and our legislature is currently debating whether to get them around $500 millions for 2008. We kill today’s terrorists while breeding the anti Americans of tomorrow!

Welcome to the Global world of geopolitics!

This was a quick preventive introduction to mute the isolationists among you. Leaving other people alone does not work anymore, especially for a country that depends on Middle Eastern oil to operate gas guzzlers, China for its cat fish and polished river rocks, and Argentina for its roses. Think about it next time you travel abroad: one cannot just go around and impose working conditions, standards of living, culture and junk food without generating some deep cultural, religious or political resentment.

9-11 happened six years ago already. My kids were four and two. My wife was in her United Airlines uniform ready for another international flight. The planes were crashing live on TV and she saw her friends and co-workers incinerated in the balls of fire. My birthday is September 12th. Should we turn the page and forget? Should we go on with our lives? Should we also forget Pearl Harbor, May eighth, July fourth, November eleventh, the assassination of President Kennedy or Martin Luther King? The attacks on 9-11 changed us and the way we live, and letting them be forgotten would cut current events from their past rational and emotional roots. Tens of thousand of people were directly affected by the loss of 3000 relatives or friends, casualties of a new kind of war waged on American soil. About 4000 US service members and thousand more contractors have already lost their lives in two different wars that are still being fiercely waged on foreign soil. Tens of thousands were wounded or crippled while hundred of thousands of indigenous civilians were also slaughtered, mostly in sectarian blood baths. It has happened, it is happening and it is still affecting our daily lives. On September eleventh, my wife cried softly. It is a recurrent sad day for her, sad because she lost friends, sad because her job lost its glamour and because she became a front line defender with some self defense tricks, pass codes to the armored door to the cockpit, and other law enforcement agency like procedures. It is also a sad day because during training she got to hear the real sound bits of what had really happened in the airplanes, all the things that were quickly removed from our screens by the media“that did not want to upset the American people”. Funny how every day for the past six years we have been exposed to the collateral damages of wars and other pictures of foreign innocent victims, but systematically denied our people who had to chose between burning alive or jumping to their death from the World Trade Center, the screams of the crew members being executed in the airplane to paralyze passengers into inaction, the executions and live beheadings of foreign hostages in the hands of the animals who hate what the Western world stands for. On 9-11, I remind my children what it is all about, why I fly a flag outside my house, and why I watch again the hundredth of pictures I saved to keep my memories sharp and my anger alive. On 9-11 2001, it could have been my wife, or me, or my kids, or all of us….or you. And tomorrow, it could happen again like in Madrid or in London. Dozens of attacks have been prevented across the world since that day when the war hit the American soil. The bombs did not go off in a German commuter trains, liquid explosive was not boarded in 15 transatlantic flights from London, and the shoe bomber had his butt kicked by alert flight attendants. It is not a matter of“if”anymore, but“when”. It is going to happen again here or there, in Paris while you are vacationing, or in the mall in Roseville. Remember that it is always easier to destroy than to build. In that war, they will always have the upper hand and you have become a front line soldier! You don’t have to like it….just get used to it and never forget 9-11 because tomorrow, it could be you!

 RACIAL GAP IN EDUCATION? 


A Californian State report on State wide results in California schools showed that the origins of the“racial”educational gap is more cultural than financial (“Tests show racial achievement gap. State results shed new light on wealth vs. poverty debate”Article by Laurel Rosenhall–Sacramento Bee Staff Writer). Basically, it demonstrated that across the State, poor white and Asian students were even faring better than their affluent African American and Hispanic peers. Now that the myth of poverty is out of the pictures when we talk about education, it is time to systematically include the higher achievement rate of poor and wealthy Asians in all types of studies (school performances, jobs, salaries, parent involvement, success….) to get the white man guilt out of the picture and show that education, like anything else, is a matter of culture indeed, but also of parental involvement and personal will to succeed. A kid that has been permanently treated as a victim of a system cannot succeed in that system! Low income white or Asians are attending the same schools as low income Americans of African and Hispanic ancestry. The people who succeed in a poor environment are facing the same challenges and deficiencies as their failing kin. Some say the tests are biased because oriented to the white American culture. Would the kids fare better if African history and Mexican geography was addressed? And what about the failure in math? It looks like despite their being the wealthiest African and Hispanic communities in the world, presented with the most opportunities, they end up toping the lists for failure at school, chances of contracting HIV or getting diabetes, ending up in gangs, in jail. It is more than racism, lack of money, lack of opportunities. Is Bill Cosby right when he criticizes minorities“who put higher priorities on sport, fashion, and“acting hard”than on education, self-respect, and self-improvement”.

No column: August recess! 

Come on. You were not really expecting a column from me, right? Nobody is working!

Federally, the Prez is at Camp David for a well deserved time off. After all, it is tiring to be the US president with the lowest approval ratings ever (33% Aug 2007 Gallup ).

Congress is on vacation. Remember, it is this time of the year when they drop everything (even hot matters like deficient bridges) in order to get a primary house remodeled, or to count packs of dollar bills neatly stacked in a freezer, or whatever else they do for a living when they don’t vote to finance various wars or Big Brother laws while claiming they don’t support them. Remember, it is tiring to be the US Congress with the lowest approval ratings ever (29% Aug 2007 Gallup ), even lower than the Prez.

On the Race 08 front (and Race is indeed the issue!), we have“wartime senators”raising money on our dime to get a grander job instead of sitting in DC to do what they were elected for, proving again that term limits would replace“prostitution for duration”by“hard work for a legacy.”Furthermore, Billary showed some cleavage and finally took the lead declaring that she would take donations form special interest groups but will never bend over backward for them (can she roll?). She also stated that she can walk on water but declined to prove it.

Statewide, the assembly cannot pass a long awaited budget but crave for vacations too. After all, it is time for the Nunez and Perata to fine tune the future term limit bill that would actually extend their terms, and for all to cater to the Indian Nation (foreign entities meddling in State politics), to get a primary house remodeled, or have a dinner and sleepover with special interest groups. Basically, they just do whatever else they do for a living to divert taxpayer’s money and propose bonds for critical things that got neglected. Nothing new: divert the money for infrastructure; propose a bond Californian cows vote for. Divert the money for levees maintenance; propose an emergency bond. Divert the money for bridges maintenance….You know the song by now…Happy cows come from California ! Keep on milking us, we deserve it!

Locally, Tsakopoulos tries to sprawl a resisting Democrat and prominent Davis in exchange of some stem cell lab, while stem cell money is slowly dilapidated by a mostly anonymous commissions -mandated by the people- that have been debating for years on how to jumpstart stem cell research. Talking about genetic enhancement also reminds me of Pluots or Graples, and chemical enhancement“a la Tour de France”, Schwartzenegger, or Garry Bond. It also brings fore the scare of chemical poisonment from most of the Chinese goods we purchase, from toys to pork, tooth paste to cat fish.

At home, I write for free, and deal with the nastymail and other anonymous letters and voicemails. You know…the price to pay…freedom of speech….as long as it is politically correct!

So for August, nothing, nada, niet, rien! Vacations!

I am going to enjoy the coldest days in California since the 1900th (new Ice Age), while crying over the increasing loss of our forests to fire (Global warming or lack of cleaning of the undergrowth and dead wood in the name of the utopist idea of a fire-free natural state of the forest?).

I am going to pull out my three colored garbage cans every Tuesday because I gave up trying to remember which day is for what, and because the neighbor I copied got it all wrong…

I am going to dig out the old car that must be still attached to the fender I already located in the dirt that fills my front yard because the run off water pours rust and oily shinny liquids on my sidewalk.

I am going to install a fake waterfall in my house and decorate it with these nice little polished river rocks made in China that I saw in my local handyman warehouse.

I am going to relax in my backyard and drink some Dasani tap water I have paid a buck a bottle.

I am going to join you, soccer-moms, and express myself with positive clapping or in silence when we renew with the“silent Saturday”tradition! Sport without counting, sport without screaming, sport without taking sides, equal time for all, a ball per kid, all winners.

I am also going to have a little thought for the hundred thousand kids that played every year at the almost defunct Basketball town in Rancho. After all, a settlement hungry shyster lawyer and a paraplegic should have their own elevator to attend a birthday party in a warehouse of sports for kids! I wonder what lessons children will learn from that. I wonder if they will become more compassionate when they will be aimlessly roaming our streets for lack of healthy activities.

I am just going to take it easy, not get angry or upset, and for one month only, step down and remodel my soap box with my own money, on my own dime…and get it ready for September.

No column today. I am closed for a well deserved summer recess!

 McClellan, the self-proclaimed pedophile under strict Californian restrictions, will leave us and what he calls his new &quot;Orwellian&quot; life conditions. Poor guy....now I feel bad! Twenty years ago, when we had more guts, common sense and morals, he would have at least been taken to the border on a rail, with tar and feathers. This outstanding citizen was just in the business of attending family events, taking pictures of little girls and posting them on the Internet for predators to better find them. He was eventually routed out of Washington to live in his car in the LA area where, I quote him:“There seem to be plenty of family events down here every week for me to attend,”he said,“and of course the weather is nice all year.”That was in June. It took us two months to figure out how to deal with him. 60 days to chase him around, to another state, to make him somebody else&apos;s problem until he ends up shot or he does molest a kid. Way to go! Still, a question remain unanswered: was he using public libraries to maintain his website? After all he is innocent until proven guilty, right?

While Hamas runs a Disney Channel type TV show promoting hatred and brainwashing the future Palestinian generation of anti-Semite and suicide bombers, the American Muslim community is dead silent. It might be to busy suing the State in order to remove any offensive mention of the nationality or religion of the 9-11 terrorists from school books to prevent the Arab world and Islam from looking bad. In the meantime, a May 22 2007 Pew Research Center poll of American Muslims showed that only 5% of the American Muslims support Al Qaeda, openly enough to state it for the poll. Only 5%? That is five potential homegrown terrorists for every hundred Muslims. The religion of Peace is in action, at home, or on TV!

I hate inconsistencies!

My family and I went to France three weeks ago and I forgot to take my hard earned and expensive Green Card with me. I did not think twice about it and really had a great time in Strasbourg and around Tours, on the Loire River. I never drink here, but back there, in these two wine counties famous for their Gewürztraminer or Vouvray, I don’t even recall drinking water! Anyways, the time to leave came too soon, again, and we boarded a 200mph bullet train from Tours to the Roissy Airport train station. That is when things got complicated.

The security screener for United Airlines asked for my Green Card. He was adamant: a US address on the French passport means the mandatory presentation of a Green Card. I was to go back to Paris, to the US embassy and get the matter sorted out ASAP! My wife hugged me and left me with a last“Kids, kiss your daddy good bye. We don’t know when we will see him again!”

I took a cab and quickly ended up at the gate of what is supposed to be America in a foreign country, a place where help is at hand. The bunker looking centuries old building lost all its Parisian charm. Concrete blocks, high fences, and Police officers everywhere, visitor screened on the sidewalk, no bags allowed…the whole scene makes you wonder how much safety there is abroad for Americans. Anyway…twelve noon…the staff is having lunch….come later. I found a guy to look after my bags for some Euros and finally made it inside the building through thorough security screenings that would put airports to shame. Get a ticket…and wait…three walls…about ten armored windows per wall….most of them with screens down…it is Friday after all! Finally, my number comes…it is four pm already…”Sorry sir. You need two Letters of transportation; and we need to check your name against State and Homeland Security databases…and anyways, we closed four hours ago…fill the paperwork and come back Monday”

The good news is that I got to spend two days in Paris. The bad news is that I didn’t really budget for that and I was supposed to start with my new job on Monday. Oh well, carpe diem!

Monday came and I was there bright and early to get my two letters. 9.30, the screen of window twelve opened and I was delivered two thick super-stamped envelopes, one for the airline to let me go, and one for my port of entry to let me in. Taxi, airport, 2pm flight to DC….Thanks God, I made it…or so I thought!

After snailing around for about 50 minutes through the non-citizen lane at the immigration control in Dulles airport, I got“detained”for another 4 hours by Immigration and Border control officers. I was finger-printed, digitally photographed, asked about size and weight, why I was not a citizen yet, etc, etc…I missed all my connections (of course) and they did not stamp my passport until the whole terminal was empty. It is good to be back!

Frustration ran high…sure it was initially my mistake but come on! The year is 2007…French passport were changed to be optically read two years ago under the pressure of the US government. High speed Internet, digital databases, secure connections, no-fly lists, most wanted lists, terrorist lists, good guy lists, bad guy lists, Freedom Fries list, war on terror and list compatibility, consolidated lists, federal agencies integration…Just revisit what I had to go through in order to get a re-entry stamp! And I shortened the ordeal because I am limited in words.

In the meantime, from Friday afternoon to Monday morning plus four hours in Dc, thousands of people came unchecked through our open northern and southern borders without any finger printing, with no document, US employment, tax or police history.

A Homeland security census states that 1.3 millions illegals were apprehended in 2005. That is 3561 a day! Let’s assume, playfully, that for one arrested, only one comes through…that is 3561 illegal a day that enter the country, 148 per hour. While the consular employee and the immigration officers spent about eight hours trying to figure out if I was who I said I was (Computer files, passport, driver’s license, credit card….), a minimum of 1184 illegal and unchecked modern time slave workers had already entered the US to mow your lawns, pick strawberries, or do whatever they do here, good or bad! Way to go! Now I feel safe.

Where do we go from there? I don’t mind strict rules…I just mind being the victim of inconsistencies and hate to think that next time I should just come in through Canada or Mexico, with or without a Green card, TB, or radioactive material!

 Crime against humanity in the Horn of Africa. 

In the Horn of Africa, a desert country is suffering from what could amount to crimes against humanity. Villagers are brutalized by governmental troops, women gang raped, civilians killed for no other reason than being at the wrong place at the wrong time, houses and huts burnt to the ground. I know that names are popping up in your heads already. Darfur, no, too far from this geographic area! It must be Djibouti, a French territory, one of the last bastions of its colonial empire…or better, Somalia and its raging civil war between warlords, hard core Muslim militias, and a puppet government backed up by one of our allies in the“war against terror”, that is to say Ethiopia. 
Sorry, you are wrong and being kept in the dark for the culprit is an American backed government ruling over a country of 77 million! We train and arm its armed forces, provide them with intelligence so Islamic movements can be rooted out of the area, and we also close our eyes in front of the exactions that have been committed there since 1994.
Ethiopia…it is a country that is becoming more and more violent, and Ogaden is the province where the exactions are committed to prevent its secession from the country and to punish its people for the armed activities of the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF). Deemed as terrorists because they resorted to violence after they failed to secede legally by following a process provided by the constitution, the soldiers of the ONLF have been blamed for bombings and murders, for the recent attack on an oil field and capture of 9 Chinese workers.
The government of Ethiopia wants them added to the US terrorist list and denies any wrong doing but the ONLF claims that they were pushed to the armed struggle, and eventually had to conduct high profile armed operations, in order to attract foreign scrutiny over what is happening in Ogaden. 
And the tactics are working. From the US government to the European parliament, the killings documented by humanitarian agencies, are starting to be the main topics of heated debates. Ogaden is a forbidden area for news-media and foreigners, but watch groups from outside Ethiopia have already brought up thousands of cases of torture, mass rapes, executions, and illegal detentions that literally amount to“crimes against humanity”according to Human Rights Watch that labeled Ethiopia as“one of the most repressive countries in Africa”. 
Since 2005, when the opposition parties were about to win the majority of seats in the parliament, the central government has made sure to repress opposing political forces with the use of force, political murder and illegal imprisonment that have eventually sent surviving opposition leaders abroad. Furthermore, to strengthen its grip over the country, punitive lethal expeditions have also been regularly sent against ethnic minorities and the people of Ogaden. 

Nice…all this is also paid by US taxpayers in the name of some twisted political alliance against people that are supposed to be worse.
Last year, we gave Ethiopia almost $300 millions and our legislature is trying to get them around $500 millions in 2008. Sure, new roads and buildings are appearing there, and crime is lowering while cut flowers and coffee are selling high on the international market. But most of our financial help has nothing to do with these“improvements”because these millions are labeled as“non humanitarian help”. 
Geopolitics at its best…side with the devil to destroy a bigger devil!
But payback time will eventually come! What do you think? What should we do?

Fairness doctrine. Monday 7/9/2007

Is“progressive talk”radio a constitutional right? Liberals in D.C, in the name of fairness, want to implement an affirmative action-like program that would legally impose radio“Liberal talk”content on Americans. Conservative programs are blamed for their success and finger pointed for raising the awareness of their active listeners. Conservative talk shows are run by private companies for profit. They are successful because people actively dial in to listen to them. They are successful because they sell lots of advertising. They are successful because they are entertaining. Also, they are not force-fed on radio listeners who have the choice to turn them on or off. Have any of you listened to Air America once, while driving. Liberal radio is boring, a driving hazard that should be made illegal. We used to have it in Sacramento until KCTC Sacramento switched to ESPN Sports from Air America (Air America filed chapt 11 10/13/06). Get a clue! I cannot wait to see how Democrats are going to make the“Fairness doctrine”fit the First Amendment. But they already sold us on legal racial discrimination to end racial discrimination, didn’t they? Where is the ACLU in this case?

 It all gets back to education Re &quot;C&apos;mon, we can&apos;t be all that dumb,&quot; June 2: What to call people who believe that bonds are money trees that bloom billions? What to call people still ignoring that taxes make the state&apos;s largest revenue and that education is the biggest spender? What name to call adults who were made to believe that owning a house is a right, even without money, with bad credit, no past and a foreclosed future?

Again, and again, everything goes back to education, morons! With education, you know your history, know the meaning of Memorial Day. With civic education, you learn who you are, where you belong, what to stand for when you claim that you are American, how it works and why it should be protected. With education, you don&apos;t need sexual harassment lawsuits nor loitering fines because you learn to respect each other and your country.

Are we witnessing the results of two decades of failed policies applied by the politically correct and egalitarian moron factories called schools? Maybe people should take a test before voting, a control of their knowledge on the issues. But that would not be nice to the morons, would it?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A West Sacramento 10 pm curfew and ban on the gathering in public of about 350 gang members also prohibited them from possessing“graffiti tools”, weapons, drugs or alcohol. Does it make sense to try to clean a gang plagued area of the capital city of the fifth largest economy of the world? Well, according to the three Californian Justices, it is not fair to punish“alleged”criminals. After all, we would not want to deprive them of any of their constitutional freedoms, do we? The men in robe disregarded testimonies stating the great benefits of the curfew for the local community and businesses and solemnly declared that there were not enough evidences of“gang criminality plaguing West Sacramento”. Sure….what do you expect them to know about such a thing as bad neighborhood and criminality. They must read the Time, watch CNN, and live in gated communities with security mercenaries palliating the“de-policing”of our law enforcement officers. Way to go! Here two suggestions for these three dreamers in their ivory towers: move their office and housing in West Sac and send them a free subscription to the Bee.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A recent survey of Californian adults, voters, have shown that most of them have no idea on what a bond is or how it is repaid, what the term limits are, what is the first revenue of the State or the top spending agency. And the same people vote, again and again, on every single bill the legislature throws at them. They even elect representatives, Presidents!

What to call people who believe that bonds are money trees that bloom billions? What to call people still ignoring that taxes make the state&apos;s largest revenue and that education is the biggest spender? What name to call adults who were made to believe that owning a house is a right, even without money, with bad credit, no past and a foreclosed future? Again, and again, everything goes back to EDUCATION, morons! With EDUCATION, you know your history, know the meaning of Memorial Day or why you should celebrate Ocho Di Mayo and not Cinco. With civic EDUCATION, you learn who you are, where you belong, what to stand for when you claim that you are American, how it works and why it should be protected. With EDUCATION, you don&apos;t need sexual harassment lawsuit nor loitering fines because you learn to respect the other and your country. Are we witnessing the results of two decades of failed policies applied by the politically correct and equalitarian moron factories called schools? Maybe people should take a test before voting, a control of their knowledge on the issues. But that would not be nice to the morons, would it? So where do we go from now….watch the movie Idiocracy and have a glimpse!

For the Spanish version, go page three.

When I drive around Folsom, I see more and more signs in Spanish trying to lure potential Hispanic customers to spend money. At the DMV, manuals are also written in Armenian, Chinese, Korean, Punjabi, Russian, Tagalog, or Vietnamese. On the phone, TV or Radio, in the voting booth, at the bank, at church, or at the self checking counters of local stores, customers are asked for the language of their choice. Finally, soon enough, to add to the towering and shinning Golden Mausoleum-looking Mormon temple, we will commute everyday under a seven story high minaret that will remind me of the good old days when I lived in Chad.

When I drive around my town today, I get this strange feeling that I am quietly being assimilated, slowly but surely amalgamated to other foreign cultures that“de-me”a piece at a time while keeping their cultural identity, and shutting me up with political correctness. I happen to be white, Christian and Westerner. When I decided to move abroad, I chose a country I could relate to, a place that I thought was built upon“values”similar to mine, with a language I could speak. I would have wanted Spanish, I would have gone to Spain or Mexico….Minarets, Morocco or Tunisia!

 Today, my“whiteness”seems to carry all the guilt of the world! Ask my fourth grader…she has already learned about how bad Americans can be! She knows everything about the discrimination against the Chinese that built the railways, and about the Mexican immigrants that do the work we don’t want to do, and about the Japanese that were interned during WW2. Social studies it is called…and she still has enough time left to talk about Native Americans, African Americans, and Muslims in the post 9-11 world. That is for sure making your kids proud of their heritage, right? And you wonder why they need Ritalin! In the meantime, Christmas, Pearl Harbor, and V day Europe are not in the curriculum….but Hanukah and Cinco di Mayo are! Go figure.

Christianity also seems to be something I should be ashamed of thanks to a global agenda to cure the West of its Judeo-Christian traditions. Forever, groups of other cultures and faiths have freely practiced their religions in America, in Folsom. But today, our guests feel like they can make the town look a little more like one of theirs? Am I intolerant? Should I join their faith or learn their language to make them feel really comfortable in my town, in YOUR country? I am sure that a seven story-high project of a cross somewhere downtown Folsom would draw more media attention and legal challenges than the project of the Mosque and the Mormon temple combined ever did. I also believe that these edifices are more like a statement than places of devotion. But what do I know? I must be a bigot, maybe racist, but certainly intolerant individual.

Or maybe I am just cranky…Again, California just recovered from its Cinco di Mayo celebrations, the short lived victory of a foreign army over another foreign army in a foreign country. Again, California ignored Ocho di Mayo (oooops….May 8th, V day Europe….no biggie!) like we have already mostly ignored Siete de Deciembre (Pearl Harbor). But what to expect from one of the three states of the union where Hispanics, La Raza, form the new majority?

For some reason I am not sure of what an American is anymore. Is America still the strong culture and model that used to assimilate worldwide waves of immigrants? Has something irreversible happened to the American model, something that makes all the different ethnic and religious groups live side by side in their traditional ways without displaying any will to melt in? Is there such a thing as an unrestricted right to“Americanship”for foreigners? Can society be multicultural and work? Can a country have no immigration policy or forgo to enforce them?

From the melting pot to the salad bowl! Diversity in the name of equality for the American quilt, the patchwork of different bits and pieces legally sown together to create a fuzzy woozy country! Is it a failure? Is the American culture the weakest? Where will America be in twenty years?

Headline: California’s bullet train stuck in traffic 

“There’s really no public purpose for me and my staff to be in the office unless you want to move forward with the project. If you don’t want to move forward with the project, then close it down and save yourself some money.”
When Mehdi Morshed, director of the High Speed Rail Authority, learned in January that his 2007 budget would be cut to $14 million from his proposed $103 million, he publicly exposed the state’s hypocrisy regarding the California High Speed Train project.
To further add insult to injury, it appears the projected $10 billion 2008 rail bond will likely be shelved to facilitate the passage of a $30 billion bond dedicated to union-protected pet projects.

Way to go, California, especially at a time when Fiona Ma (San Francisco) became the fastest American Assemblywoman on rail when she rode the French bullet train that hit the 357.2 mph mark!

Ten years ago, a Californian Bullet Train project was presented as the solution to easing traffic on our congested highways and to contribute to a cleaner air.
Ten years ago the High Speed Rail Authority was created, and for these past ten years, it has aimlessly spent money, secured lands, planned railroads and crossings, budgeted phases, and studied“hardware”options.
Why the charade has gone on for so long is still a mystery. It looks as though there is no end to this tunnel!
Thirty-five years ago, France witnessed its inaugural high speed train ride at a commercial speed of 200 mph“in comfort conditions similar to an airplane”as the Transport Secretary of the time described it.
Yes, you read it correctly…that was 35 years ago, only five years after a fast train feasibility study, in France mind you and at the same time as the only ever commercial supersonic plane (the Concorde) and the Minitel (French“internet”workstations attached to every phone subscriber’s telephone).
In the meantime, America was blacktopping railroads, relegating trains and tramways to museums and promoting transportation by cars.
Did Detroit, tire manufacturers, oil companies and major airlines kill the Great American rail system that spider-webbed the continent from coast to coast, serving big cities as well as prairie towns?
Today, in France, people commute 400 miles a day, to downtown Tours or London, or to downtown Paris, for example, in two hours! Super-commuters are not a California exclusivity! Super commuters take the train, often with their automobiles loaded on the rear cars when the Train-Auto option is opted.
Just think of it: Downtown Sacramento to downtown San Diego in 2-1/2 hours (500miles)!
One could literally commute in style and work anywhere in the Golden State, instead of following along behind humongous gas-guzzlers snailing along our maxed-out derelict, over-crowded, and expensive highways.
Today we have been made to believe that bullet trains are expensive, that building a dedicated railroad will be long and painful, that mass transportation will never work, and that the money should be spent on improving our roads.
What roads? There is no room to expand any of our major highways, gas prices and emissions are going up, and millions of dollars in idling time stuck in traffic are wasted every day.
What is a long time? In four years France went from an idea, to production and exploitation. When there is a will…!
And what is expensive? California-expensive, like so many other things, like a bridge on a Bay?
Last year in Millau, France, the world’s most beautiful and innovative viaduct was built. Three world records were shattered in four years for a total price of $544 million. Beautiful, Innovative, within budget and on time….words that have long disappeared from the language in California.
In San Francisco, the East span of the Bay Bridge is a typical piece of work done by agencies that have no problem spending and wasting our time and money. After the Loma Prieta earthquake, the double-decker, which had been built in 1933, needed to be retrofitted. Studies showed that it could be done for about $200 million, but additional studies in 1999 claimed that building a new bridge with the same number of lanes (real smart, hey?) would take only take a couple of extra hundreds of million with the added benefit of a 100-year life span.
The choice was a“no brainer”and the new“Signature Span”concept got the green light in 2002 with the completion originally planned for 2007 at a price of about $2.6 billion!
As you know, completion is now set for 2013 and the final price as of 2005 has already reached the estimated $6.2 billion.
I wonder what the estimate will be in 2010. In the meantime, the toll went up $1. This increase pays for the madness while the completion of the project (and its reliability) was awarded to the lowest bidder!
Keep on milking us, please! As long as taxpayers and bonds are around, there is money!

A deeply disturbed animal just got his five unnecessary days of fame -by bored blood thirsty media- for the slaughtering of 32 students and teachers in Virginia. (I already forgot his name and won’t glorify him more by saying it….like the other before him, he does not deserve to be called anything but names . His rotting carcass should be hung in a webcam accessible open cage on the campus of the university, to show any copycat what we do to them after they come in the open!).

Way to go Political Correctness! Since 2005, this moron has shown many tale telling disturbing signs of mental problems, so bad that the attendance in his classroom went from 70 to seven, and that his teacher threatened to resign! 

 He was arrested twice after female students worried for their safety reported him to the authorities. He was tutored one-on-one by the head of the English department after his crazy gory“creative writings”were exposed. He was sent to a psychiatrist and was even shortly interned in a mental institution. Still, no red flag showed on his Police records when he went and legally bought a couple of handguns.

Guns don’t kill people but people kill people! We, society, are partly responsible for what has happened there. We did not call him“weird”, say he was kind of sort of“demented”, label him as crazy, lock him up for some good old fashion electroshock treatment that would have fried his disturbed brain and turned him into a harmless veggie…no!

 We are better than that! Our society is opened to everybody, all sorts of creeps, weirdoes, perverts that we would never dare discriminating against! 

Was he left alone because of PC, because of his race and fear of a financially punitive lawsuit from the ACLU?

Who is the overpaid psychiatrist that diagnosed him as harmless? Is he going to be sued and held responsible for his costly mistake?

Was the little refuse on some anti-depressant drug known for murderous or suicidal side effects on 10 to 15% of the patients? After all, we need to know….because the killings happened on the day the FDA told us that anti-depressant are cool to use!

Should you worry about all these time bombs, these legally Ritalined children that are pharmaceutically neutered in our schools? 10 or 15% among them will end up taking their own lives….or others!

Have a nice politically correct day and get the head of the principal of the university, even the Police chief’s….that won’t solve anything but make everybody feel better.

Texas law…Common sense and Justice rule!

A married man came back home late at night to discover his wife having sex in a car in front of his home. The surprised woman started to struggle and screamed“rape”. Her lover kicked her out of the car and tried to drive away while a ballistic husband–believing that he was protecting his wife- pulled out a gun (concealed arms permit) and shot to death the run away“rapist”. The husband was arrested for voluntary manslaughter until the investigation showed that his wife lied to him, that it was not a rape. The judge ruled in favor of the husband and his wife was charged for the manslaughter. Way to go….I am moving there! http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4675987.html

Parents beware!
 

My 10 year old daughter asked me if she could lookup some pictures of the Californian town of Folsom on the Internet. I told her to Yahoo“Folsom”and select“images”on the menu. A couple of minutes later, obviously embarrassed, she asked me for a private talk and told me it did not quite work. In her own words, she described to me the weirdest things and I had to see it for myself. Guess what? Searching for images of Folsom pulls out photos of Folsom Street in San Francisco, a place where the Gay-Lesbian-Transsexual-transgender crowd holds their“Folsom Street Fair”, a legal freak show that has more to do with vice and perversion than advocacy for a mainstream gay life,“not that there is anything wrong with that!”

For the past decade, and too many times already, the Supreme Court has been unsuccessfully coping with the issue of the protection of our children against the Internet porn industry, and /or the unbridled dissemination of electronic adult content, versus our“freedom of speech”. In the meantime, while these nice little old people in robes debate the extent of our Freedom of Speech, we, the parents must protect our children.

It makes sense right? We would not want to infringe on the freedom of speech of that thing displayed on one of the pictures, a fat 50 year old male weirdo that wants to be remembered wearing a wig and a tiny red bikini under the folds of his sagging belly. We would not want to restrict porn webmasters. We would not want to limit their freedom of speech by imposing an easily filterable“.XXX”extension to their domain names.

No way! That would really hurt my kids in the long run because it would eventually limit one of their basic constitutional freedoms tomorrow by denying them the right to fully express themselves as mature citizens…if they embrace a career in porn!

In the meantime, the porn industry can actually come into our homes and freely display offensive images on our computers. Whether we want it or not, they are forced upon us everyday and can appear anytime, even searching for Folsom!

Megan’s law is another good example of the institutions failing to protect us. A year ago, I was attending a class on Megan’s law and confessed that I had never visited the website. Candidly, I also asked a wide-eyed audience what I should do if I discovered that a register sex offender lived in my street, and if killing him/her, or driving him/her out of town on a rail, with the tar and feathers thing, were my possible options.

The institutions have failed us because some unaccountable lawyers or psychiatrists have given up their responsibilities to protect the public, and released potentially dangerous sexual offenders in our street (and more than 50% will become recidivists according to statistics). I was innocently raised under the assumption that the prison system only releases people that have“paid their debts to society”, that are no longer a threat to the public, and that prison is a place one does not want to go back to. So my question has always been the same: why the need for the registration, the mapping, electronic anklets and public disclosure of“reformed”sex offenders? If they are still a threat to us, what on earth are they doing in our streets, and what are we supposed to do with the information?

Furthermore, to make things a bit more disturbing, a loop in the law allows some of the offenders to avoid registration on the public website, and one has to actually go to the Police station to check a full listing after a formal request and a non-disclosure agreement.

And you thought you were safe with the public display of 20 sex offenders in Folsom, some with no address and some“in violation”….And you thought that you were safe because your neighborhood showed none! Tell you what, we might have 30, or 40 in town, and a couple of them in your street!

Right now, I don’t really want to know that our system is so broken that potentially dangerous people are released in our streets, and that you and I have become responsible for protecting our families. I was half secure in my belief that we only had to fear criminals we don’t know about yet!

So here it is, your call again…What can you do?

I could provide you with some personal suggestions but they are not nice, so I will just leave it to you!

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Do prison psychiatrists lay Golden Eggs, cure cancer, re-grow hair when hovering by, and convert convicts? Like in the cult movie“Office Space”, I want to be the consultant hired to“streamline”the process. I want to ask a Prison Psychiatrist to describe what he does at work, to convince me why he deserves a $250.000 salary on my dime on top of other State perks. I want to replicate the process with a“Psyche”from the Health Department and ask why he thinks $144.000 is not enough. State workers have it all figured out: one category uses its union to blackmail legislators into a round of raises. Once it has been done, the same category of workers in another department uses its own union to complain that their wages are not competitive anymore, and threaten to transfer for the better pay. Everybody cry, moan etc…Raises are finally allocated to the latter. Next door, another category sees the above raises and starts lobbying/blackmailing for“competitive”and fair wages, for their raises... And so on! When are we, the tax payers, going to put an end to that madness?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Californian school system is standing out for its incredibly high cost of operation, and for its dramatic inability to educate. The excuses for trailing behind most States of the nation are many, race or income based and always the same despite the dollars and remedies applied years after years. Some kids are born to write symphonies and some are born to carry the piano. Instead of lowering our standards to ensure that the“learning challenged”graduate, shouldn’t we honor the one who overcome the handicaps others use as excuses for their failures? Let us cut the fat, find where the money goes, develop vocational schools, and prepare our children for the competitive world ahead of them. Learning and sports are competitive activities and neither“affirmative action”nor“positive clapping”is going to turn any kid into a genius or an Olympian. Our children deserve a system where they can all excel at their own level, not a one (small) size fit all that neuters hard work and gift in the name of sensitivity. How could we function if we were all PhD? How would we function without a Paris or a Britney and their real life“Blonde”jokes?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


So much to say….so little time!

I am depressed….literally! So much got me going since I wrote my last column that I could not make up my mind on what to talk about. 

I wanted to talk about the grand opening of our magnificent library and promote the importance of reading, the beauty of books, and the necessity of self“edutainment”through the discovery of history as written on paper, in serious or embellished fashion. I wanted to promote the critical thinking that can only be acquired by people who don’t take what they see, hear, or read for granted but make a personal effort to do some fact finding, conduct the researches across a wide range of medium and idea to build their own independence of thoughts. I wanted to promote the touch, feel and smell of old books, the exhilaration of reading decade old original hard cover books. 

I wanted to talk about education and money, and how we throw more and more of it into a broken system. Have you realized yet that our school system is remarkable by its high cost of operation (it receives about 40% of the state’s revenues every year, plus the lottery, home taxes, bonds, parental participation with money or labor), and by its tragic failure to educate, with California still trailing most states of the nation. Actually, it is just another typical example of our Californian“tragi-comedy”: by the time the allocated monies flow down to the places and people that need it, most of it has been sucked dry by the“overhead.”In this case, the cost of educating our children as no correlation at all with what California is spending in education and the question remains: where does the money go? 

I also wanted to talk about the“stupidization”of our societies; we have replaced the un-sensitive elitist laws of nature by a semblance of political correct equality in front of our human laws. We have replaced reproduction by sex, food for hunger by“the pleasures of the table,”common sense by lawsuits, work by entitlement (one out of six Americans was getting a“social”check in 2006), and fitness by fatness. That is progress….or is it? While the educated get smarter, they also get older and fewer, having the luxury to postpone reproduction for longer stints in college, ski trips to Aspen, a career and some retirement. The same applies to the so-called conservative, the new married minority, vowed to extinction by those who want to cure the Western world from its white and Christian traditions. In the meantime, the poor and the less educated of the globe breed earlier and longer, only postponing reproduction for their own versions of the WWF: to wage war in a neighborhood country they will be able to loot, rape and burn to the ground. Do you really believe that we are getting any smarter as a specie? Do you believe that we are going anywhere? 

I wanted to talk about races, and especially about American of African ancestries, and how they stand divided between the Jackson/Sharpton/Poitier/NAACP entitled crowd and the successful one they derogatory refer as the &quot;house slaves&quot; such as Senator Obama, Whitaker, Condoleza, Cosby, etc, etc…Isn’t it interesting that the latter are the good students, businesspersons, police officers, artists, or politicians that have succeeded despite all the handicaps &quot;the race card flashers&quot; use as excuses for their failures? To make my case, Jackson and Sharpton were even recently quoted saying that despite his skin color, Senator Obama is not one of &quot;their kind&quot; because he does not fully embrace &quot;their agenda&quot; (of charity, victimization and entitlement?). Way to go so close to Martin Luther King’s dream of his children being judged by the content of their characters….and only that!

I wanted to talk about the Americans of Japanese ancestry getting a $20,000 reparation check per survivor or remaining families of the WW2 internment camps, monies that the survivors of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team of the United States Army, a unit composed of Japanese Americans who fought in Europe, will never even dream to see, ever!. I wanted to talk about the movie“Letter to Iwo Jima”and the depiction of the Japanese fighters as the victims of the American inhumane destroying machine, another way to re-write history for our politically correct grown children addicted to Japanese goods. I wanted to ask you if you knew that Japan never paid any war reparations, that Hirohito stayed in power (just think of us letting Hitler in power at the end of WW2) and the war criminals of his family were pardoned. I wanted to tell you that they literally enslaved the non-Japanese populations of their Chinese and Pacific conquests, experimented on human beings (Unit 731 researched biological warfare and conducted human experimentation), and slaughtered, raped, and murdered everybody from POWs (read/watch“The Great Raid”) to civilians (read“The rape of Nanking”:300.000 people slaughtered, raped, massacred in six weeks). I wanted to unveil for you the cargo of the German submarine U235 that was shipped out of Germany on May 25, 1945 in a last mission to deliver to Japan, the last standing Axis country, the goods necessary to deliver the nuclear edge and the total control of the airspace. Overall, three crated revolutionary aircrafts (two jet fighters, a rocket-propelled fighter, a glider-bomb), 10 canisters of uranium oxide, and over 3 tons of technical drawings, plus other pieces of technology (torpedo, fuses, armor piercing shells, etc.), were on their way to Japan when the war ended in Europe. I let you imagine what could have happened.

I decided not to even approach any of the above. Instead, I will just talk to you about my 9 years old son suddenly becoming a Vegetarian on a Friday, feasting on celery, banana slices, and applesauce. Fortunately, on the next Sunday, he returned to the good old meat-eating habits better suited to the specie that tops the food chain …he finally realized that -I quote him- veggies were“boring.”Way to go son!.

You know our electoral system is broken when:

- Only rich corrupt people run

- Only paid activists get involved

- Campaign contributions are legal

- Bribes are illegal and contributions aren&apos;t

- Only crooks run for office according to the opponent

- Voters keep rotten candidates

- Taxpayers are cows that politicians milk

- Happy cows come from California

- With cows, there is no deficit

- Deep pockets are tailored in politician&apos;s suits

- Their depth varies with the office

- State worker invest millions for &quot;their&quot; candidates

- Only State workers get raises

- &quot;special interest groups&quot; don&apos;t expect paybacks

- Did I say that?

- Working people work on Tuesdays

- Free loaders don&apos;t and vote to improve their freebies

- Voting happens on Tuesday not to ruin a weekend

- Whatever was voted on is always challenged by the loser until it passes

- Elections are an investment, not a waste

- Elected official are assets, rarely a waste

- Lt Governors are a waste and should be insurance commissioner

- A civil servant serves us

- Did I say that?

- Did I tell you that campaign contributions are not bribes and that cows pay taxes?

- Special elections are not &quot;special&quot;

Maybe and only maybe:

- Only productive people should vote on spending money

- 5 years should go by before any bill is challenged

- Alleged misconduct should be investigated

- Over 50% abstention should get the elections cancelled


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Recently, America reached two important milestones.

The first one is that our population reached 300 millions. I am assuming that the figure accounts for the legal citizens only - documented dead voters included - and does not take into account the millions of illegal immigrants–undocumented“legal”workers included–that actually live openly within our open borders. Knowing now that the Census bureau cannot even account for its laptops, I am still kind of questioning the accuracy of the reports it trumpets all around….Okay, so in 2006, America actually reached around the 300 millions mark!(plus or minus a couple of millions?).

The other report that I thought was more interesting was an analysis of new census figures by The New York Times claiming that married couples were making less than 50% of the American households (49.7 percent, or 55.2 million, of the nation&apos;s 111.1 million households in 2005 were made up of married couples) 

The Good!

Finally, It has happened, and that, married brothers and sisters, IS good news. I came here in 1999 and something I learned quickly is that there in no more Melting Pot, no more identification to a nation, borders, a culture, a language or a religion. Nope, nada! In the name of equality, the American people have been divided in minority special entitled groups. In the name of diversity, Americans have been made aware of their differences and separated, by origins, races, languages, religions, sexual preferences, weight, health, income, wealth, region, political preferences…

You are not Americans anymore but African American or White non Hispanic, middle class or/and disenfranchised, heterosexual or out of the closet gay-lesbian-transgender-cross-dressed, rich (starts at middle class) or left behind, Republican or Democrat, red or blue, or a combination of all of the above.

I always joke that I wished I were a minority disabled female veteran with some native American blood, or something similar that grants you a state employment for life or preferential treatment wherever you go! Well….it finally happened! I am minority now….officially!

It is time for the 55.2 million of us, married couples, to unite, find a lawyer (that is easy) good enough (that is harder) to get us a slot in the official list of the entitled protected minorities, a special parking sticker so our pregnant wives don’t have to park miles away from the shops, a permanent pass to the Diamond lanes, priority and preferential bids for married couple’s owned businesses, free tickets to Disneyland, the full attention of the ACLU and other“civil right”groups, and a national recognition for our contribution to the survival of American values with the erection in D.C of a statue depicting a married couple racing against the clock, the husband in business attire beating his wife to the door–she is munching a slice of pizza while she runs-, followed by a kid in soccer gear, and another one in diapers swallowing a rattle while a wiener dog chews on a Teddy Bear .

I feel special now that I got a new identity as protected specie! Maybe married couples are on the decline but now they are entitled to respect, attention, perks and all the affirmative action other minority groups get everyday! Isn’t it cool? Watch out, I am special! 

The Bad!

We should have seen it coming anyways and it is not a surprise. Come on, look around you! We have become a society where personal responsibility is gone and where as long as you say“I am sorry”everything is fine, no matter what you did or said. No responsibility, no commitment. Everything is under warranty and can be returned, no question asked. Test drive a car, test drive a computer (2 years return policy at Costco), test drive a pet, test drive a girl friend. You don’t like what you got, discovered that a puppy barks and poops, found a cheaper computer at Frys, had a fight with your partner….no problem! Call it a quit! Return the car, take the doggie to the shelter, repack the PC, dump your girl for her sister and start all over….come on! It is money back guaranteed! You cannot beat it. Actually, it takes two to build a long lasting relationship, and it takes the symbolic ceremony of the marriage, and the rings that should keep you focused to create and maintain the commitment both parties made when they were united by law and at a church or a temple. But our society has also become a society steered to the immediate fulfillment of any pleasure. Why wait when you can get it now, whether you can afford it or not? Zero percent financing, no money down, good or bad credit! Get it now, don’t wait, you deserve it; you are entitled to everything and anything you wish for, right now, even a marriage. Weddings have been lowered to the level of commodities, something you need to get sometimes, like a dishwasher and a flat screen TV, and something you don’t need to keep, something that carries an expiration date, a time bomb, but not a challenge. You buy the package - a wedding for 150 people in Baja California, horse and carriage and professional video included - and basically focus more on the event (how your friends and family are going to be flabbergasted) that on what it really means. Marketing and money took over, like they already ruined Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas. When and if you get married, it is not for the commitment anymore (until death?) but for the show, another set of tacky lights on the roof of your superficial life! Lack of commitment to do it or while in it, added to the regular ridiculing of the sacrament by agenda driven groups, are killing the marriage. Do you really think it is a good thing? 

The Ugly!

Yes indeed, the legal and religious act of getting married had been under attack for quite a while now. When my children were younger, my daughter wanted to marry me and my son wanted to marry my wife. I always replied to them:“no problem kids! Right after the ceremonies we will move to Campturkey ( KY ?) where the cross-bred live, in the boonies”. Family joke aside, I did not have to move so far to see it live! There is a“Campturkey” in California, under the spotlights of the media where the cross-bred breed like la bunch of horny lemmings at spring, before the mythical (but fake) migration to death over the cliff (I wish!). Hollywood and its“role models”are all over the media, regular or tabloid. We are daily fed with cancelled week long marriages, divorces, kids out of wed locks claimed by multiple fathers, promiscuity, sex videos, unfaithfulness, drunkenness, drug addictions, perversions“a la Bambi”, and all these nice things that make show biz go round. Add to that our singing stars and the values most of them convey, without forgetting other controversial public figures, like the pedophile priests or our elected officials addicted to Interns and Pages, to name a few. I am not a prude nor am I a“saint”. But come on…Do you think it is healthy to hammer us everyday with the messed up life of so many of our“idols”. Our real life has just turned into one of these cheap afternoon soap dishes:“The bald and the beautiful”or“Degenerate housewives”turned reality show, with the pretty boys and girls, the unhealthy romances, the twists, the treasons, the rebounds…To top it up, the Gay and Lesbian community also came after the notion of marriage and tried to appropriate it like they have already done with my children’s rainbow. Why do they want“my”marriage so bad that they have to mimic it wherever they got their wish granted? I don’t care if they want to officialize their union with their partners and I do believe that they should be entitled to the same legal protections and rights the legal union provide, but they must call it something else…and they need to stop the Tux and White dress thing….that is freaky!.

Come on people….that is what our kids are growing with, what the alphabet generations grew up with. No wonder they sneak in at night to sniff the Freon gas out of your window air-conditioner, or get high inhaling anything from glue to paint and pressured air cans. God only knows what I would inhale out of despair if I were like them…Tabasco maybe? 

I can already hear the voices of disapproval raising, telling me that the majority of marriages end up in divorce and that this fact alone explains why the Sacrament of marriage is going down the tube. The voices are saying that the commitment argument is horse manure and that no one needs a ring to remember the mutual needs of a“limited responsibility partnership”. They also say that I am a bigot jealous of the rich and the famous, and a gay hater that want to send homosexual couples back in the closet and deny them their civil right to the magic of my wedding day. Finally, the voices yell at me that I should go back to my country if I don’t like it here. Fair enough, but these arguments actually make my case and that is why I made them up to conclude today’s column. These voices are in my head and I made them up, and you should not hate me because I have the choice….to stay here or go home….when you are stuck here!

The voices….the voices are annoying now and it is time to go. How much do I owe you doctor? No, no, I won’t forget my medication. Yes, I will be back in a month for another session, column I mean. No I wasn’t mean…and if I was, I forgot….and I am sorry…Thank you doctor!

Does it make sense to hold accountable for any flood-related costs the authorities that validate the levees for the protection of housing developments, along with the authorities that issue the building permits, and with the authorities that collect the home taxes? People that live or bought next to levees should know the risks and be willing to endure some losses and costs, but authorities that allowed the land to be developed, and also cashed on it, should be held responsible for most of a post-flood remediation. Common sense rules! Accountability should too!

You know your healthcare system is messed up when:

-         patients and insurances are customers and most medical facilities private businesses

-         an ambulance and a day at the hospital cost more than a 3 day package air trip in a three star hotel to Hawaii

-         American made medicine are cheaper abroad

-         a broken arm costs a couple of thousands of dollars for an x-ray and a cast

-         ERs are closed on a weekend….if they exist

-         insured and paying customers need an appointment and about a week to be seen

-         uninsured customers are seen immediately at any open ER

-         if co-pay is cheap, customers are kicked out for any higher priced client

-         if co-pay is high, customers are kept, day after day, for more test, doctor visits, consultations

-         regular hospitals have more than 70% of their bills in recovery

-         health costs are not capped, nor controlled or investigated

-         you are imposed a physician or dentist, and they don’t need to be good

-         there is no real competition or alternative

-         you go for a checkup and it cost an arm and a leg!

Nota: all the above is fiction and we all know that.

Sign of times, the first 2007 American-born baby (oxymoron because all children born on US land is an American) was born from an illegal immigrant and the woman was even rewarded with a $25,000 prize. Sign of times, to cater to its foreign interest (Chinese in this case), an American corporation (Baby&apos;r us) rewarded the breaking of the laws of the land. Sign of times, the demographics of New Orleans are changing and nurseries are filling up with the American newborns from the Hispanic illegal workforce that is rebuilding the city while the &quot;citizen-victims&quot; are still on subsidies waiting for their new houses to be delivered. Welcome to America, the land of the...lemmings! Where is the cliff?

My daughter liked the presentation of Hanukah they got in her last school day, and the traditional game they played, but she would have also enjoyed very much talking about what was going to happen in her life on the upcoming Christmas weekend.

I asked her if she felt that the school was actually avoiding anything Catholic, and was answered by a“Helloooo…remember last Christmas?”

Flash back…My daughter happens to have a bigger heart than I do, and last year, on her own time, own paid paper and toner, printed monthly coloring packets of about twenty pages for her classmates. One day, during the“winter holiday,”her teacher found the coloring template of a kid on his knees with joint hands. She asked my daughter to remove the cartoon from every packet while trying to explain to her that some parents might find it offensive. Her feelings were hurt and to this day, she still does not understand what had happened. How can I explain to her that some so called adults out there would have sued the school because an 8 years old girl was so &quot;viciously&quot; forcing her religion upon their children?

How should I tell her today that being Catholic is often a good enough and fashionable reason to be discriminated against by the political correctness that prevails in the country?

Why the guilt trip for being what we are? Why the &quot;neuterization&quot; of the differences in the land of diversity? Does diversity come with a restriction clause, such as &quot;everything but white and catholic,”not to mention the evil &quot;conservative&quot; thing, soon to become the &quot;C&quot; world?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A prank has recently exposed the dangers of political correctness and the insanity that runs in the country.

A couple of Juvenile males spray-painted their face in bright red, and also sprayed their bald skulls black along with a fake painted beard, mustache and eyebrows before going to their local DMV to renew their driver’s license. They got the licenses all right with their clown faces on them. To top it up, plastic oversized teeth completed the look for a videotaped joke that ended up on www.youtube.com . The immediate success of the online video got back to DMV officials that forced the kids to come back for a new license or see the old one revoked. DMV‘s spokesperson stated that nothing illegal had been done but that trying to modify your appearances for a driver’s license could result in some problems. When asked how come nobody at that specific DMV office challenged the look of the young men, the reply was, I quote;“I don’t think it is up to DMV employee to tell a cancer patient that is wig is not looking right, or an acne ridden girl if that is what she wants to look like on a picture”

Therefore, I guess it is OK to be unchallenged with a spray painted face, beard and hair, and plastic teeth. That is what nice people do, right?

What a bunch of stupid wimps we have become, just good enough to look for the closest and highest bridge….AND JUMP FROM IT!

&quot;Just call me Grinch!&quot; 

I gave a coat to the Red Cross, another one to see Santa, and a third for News10. I gave shirts and socks to Twin Lakes, and bags of old clothe to the Salvation Army and the veterans. I also gave cans to the school, toys to the Marine Corps, the Cappuccino Cruzers, and Euro Sunday. I brought bags of goodies to the Lion’s club, ran for food, dropped free stuff at the thrift shop, and fresh cookies in the held out hands. I donated one of my cars for the orphans, gave my blood, a kidney and my left eye. 

I gave it all….and it does not feel good anymore! I have been“burnt”by the overkill of corporate America’s“Spirit of Christmas.”I got indigestion from the food and“Toyz”runs, Christmas carols, Santas, and tree lightings that have been shoveled down my soul since last Thanksgiving. Too much Christmas has killed my Christmas spirit again!

Furthermore, the image of a Folsom“needy”woman haunts me: she had a toddler in one arm and a cigarette in the other;“Leave it there with the others,”she casually said about a bag of goodies while pointing to a dozen bags already lined up against a wall! Motivated by some kind of indifferent entitlement, she had obviously applied to every single program in town. 

Again, the holiday season had fallen upon us, loaded with guilt. We are bad human beings if we do not give because it is wrong for some to be cold and hungry at Christmas while we get fatter. Again, my family gave without counting to the one who asked, and took, without counting.

Nevertheless, as a teacher put it while promoting a food run:“Give! It will make you feel good!”…and it is all about us isn’t it? 

I am just plain done because I have seen too many abuses too many times in too many places and because I am also confident that the challenged people with the will to change their fates will eventually do it without my donated toy or coat. For the rest, the lifetime needy, it is just a choice or an illness, and both should be treated! 

Therefore, I decided to stop reaching out by proxy. I also decided to stop feeling guilty for not giving a percentage of my salary to my church, or my left arm to a charity. I will focus and reach around me, help the people in need I know or can identify in my community, and God knows we have many in Folsom! Just ask your local firefighter, Code enforcement, or Police officers for the many Folsom social horror stories! Better yet, just attend the CAPS program to see it live (Folsom Citizen Academy), or walk around your neighborhood. Last year, a ride along in an ambulance opened my eyes. With blaring sirens, we entered Empire Ranch, soon to be joined by a backup unit from another station. Paramedics entered the house and eventually took a senior away while I waited outside, looking at cars slowing down, or neighbors peeking through the windows. Nobody asked anything, and throughout the whole incident, a man right next door kept on mowing his lawn. Poor woman! She thought suburbia was safer for seniors, closer to love and care! 

Finally, let us wonder a little about what is happening to the“needy”the rest of the year. Are we just a feel-good bunch of hypocrites hogging on the planet resources while donating to concerts against world famine or other Telethons? Do our“needy”survive all year on the Christmas loot or is it just more morally acceptable to let them starve, wander, and die under the sun? What is happening to our“generosity”the rest of the year, eleven months a year? Shouldn’t we have summer food runs too? What is happening to the many local, State and Federal programs paid for by taxpayers? Are they total failures and shouldn’t we fix them according to the“accountability thing”I preach all the time?

We suffer from attention disorder and only react to what makes today’s headlines. Yesterday’s hunger has been solved because we donated a couple of cans. Our Christmas-time people in need are okay until next Christmas because we got rid of the clothing we outgrew. Isn’t life simple?

Roots.

Every year, I leave behind the signs of my suburbanite Folsom life for two weeks in a place in the Mediterranean sea where people are still killed for honor or revenge.  

In my little Corsican town that once dealt with the Romans, the repeated triple stroke of the Angelus (curfew), has been ringing everyday at dawn since 900AD. The white bleached 15th century bell tower also rings the hours, the somber toll or the joyous carillon, gently timing the lives of the proud 400 or so Corsicans that have been living there for generations, most of them familly.

I was born and raised there, in a stony house covered with schist slates, standing on stone walls three feet wide and older than Sacramento. I was born in the bed I slept in, played in the“maquis”(aromatic shrubs) my two kids also played in, warmed up the school benches they got to seat on to copy French poetry in cursives or get helpful tips to stay out of trouble, like seating straight or focusing. I was born somewhere else like many Americans today, like you or your parents, grand or great grand parents, and that vital someplace else is what still flows in my veins, and in my children’s. 

Every morning, family and friends brought us treats to make our short stay sweeter: fresh red and silver fishes, wild boar meat and woodcocks, cheese and dry cured sausages, chestnuts and clementines. In the“modern world”we feed ourselves, mostly processed food munched in a hurry, at home or in a cube at work! Back there we still cook and we eat what we grow, raise, hunt, poach, fish, and make! When did we go wrong? What happened to us while we became more“civilized”?  

With the blade of a knife, a sign of cross is often drawn on the loaf of bread before it is cut and shared. During the long meals, people vocally“argue”about local, national or worldwide politics with wide hand gestures, a loud and scary sight for the outsider, a tradition often interrupted by healthy spoonful of food or a sip of wine. They know Arnold has been re-elected, Iraq is a mess and Lebanon a lamb on the altar of geopolitics. They also know that the wind is changing and that it is time to bring the cattle to lower altitudes, or to pick and store the apples.  

In the pure adventurous Corsican tradition, I left for new horizons, lured across the seas by the tales of our nonagenarians that came back after decades at the service of a now faded empire. At home, they know I will also come back, if not to die, at least to be buried, in the house-looking family tomb that overseas the Mediterranean.. Death is part of life and when we visit with the children, we must visit the living and the dead alike, share memories and stories, pass along an invaluable heritage. 

Lucie and Vincent cried when it was time to go, and leave their loving pepe and meme and the safety and wonders of this place. If you don’t say good bye, you never get to say hello again and Canari, my village, will still be there next year, immobile in time and little changed for my children to enjoy again.

I read a piece on the righting the wrongs that was done to the Japanese that lived in America during WW2 (Sacramento Bee, today)…$20.000 per interned or the surviving family and the camps turned into museum for the American guilt trip. That is nice and Americans are so generous….and forgiving,Now that the Japanese Americans have been generously“repaired,”(reparations!), I hope that the media will led them to help us get war reparations….from Japan!

Do you know that Germany paid billions in war damages and reparations, was rebuilt from ground up and completely“denazified”for decades, and its war criminals tried and executed?

Do you know that Japan never ever admitted being the aggressor in Asia or against America, never paid a dime, got immunity for most of its well known war criminals (many of them from the emperor’s family) and even went on to rewrite its own history? Actually Japanese history book even teach how Japan was the victim of the occidental onslaught and tried to protect Asia!

Hiro-Hito was pardoned, kept in power, granted immunity, and never tried for his responsibility in the war crimes in China, all over Asia and against POWs and civilian populations.

He was left to rule his people through the American reconstruction of his empire (paid by the American people) that eventually led Japan to its economic success.

Do you think we could have left Hitler in power in Germany, and pardon the SS and other criminal German organizations, and individuals?

No way!

However, it happened in Japan….and now Americans are made to feel guilty about the internment of a potentially dangerous population that had been infiltrated by spies and have actively or not helped the Japanese war effort.

Furthermore, you should go and talk to the few surviving WW2 veterans. They left their families back home to fight the Japanese for a few bucks a month, not enough for the people left behind to buy food or basic things. As they always tell me, the interned Japanese were provided with a roof, some medical care, and some food, commodities that were denied to most of their relatives.

Will you quit forwarding the self-destructive agenda that Americans are bad and the rest of the world are our victims?

That is an agenda for shyster lawyers, for the feel good crowd that want to save the world, reach out, show the example…that is suicidal!

It was war, for Christ sake. And a very nasty one in the Pacific.

We would have fought it at home and abroad like we have fought the recent one, we would be Japanese or German slave workers.

History is well documented and shows what has happened. Let us not forget it and the healing process should not be for us only to bear!

The race card!

A 20-year veteran American of African American ancestry firefighter was (tentatively) awarded a $2.7 millions settlement because his spaghettis were seasoned with some dog food. The fact that he kept on calling himself the“big dawg,”and kept telling newbies on cooking duties that they needed to feed“the dog”had of course nothing to do with the prank. Racism was the culprit and the city of L.A and its deep pockets the target. (Thanks god he has a history in hazing new recruits and just got what he deserved. LA might not pay!).

A car robber went on a high-speed chase with a stolen vehicle, was eventually blocked, resisted arrest and was stricken 11 times to obedience with a flash light. He was awarded a $450.000 settlement!

In New York, a vehicle rammed into an undercover officer and then an unmarked NYPD minivan twice part of a surveillance operation of a suspicious strip joint with a &quot;chronic history of narcotics, prostitution and weapons complaints.&quot; The collision prompted other undercover officer to shoot at the fleeing vehicle (they shot 50 rounds but only 21 hit the target: what are they learning in Police academies?). Two black males were hit, one fled the scene. Three officers that had been directly or indirectly rammed were treated for minor injuries. The officers that fired their guns never shot anybody ever during their career. Despite that, Sharpton went to Jamaica Hospital, where one victim was pronounced dead, and Mary Immaculate Hospital on Saturday and held news conferences afterward. At Jamaica Hospital. To top it up the mayor of New York immediately questioned the“excessive force”while knowing the facts and before the end of an official investigation, basically denying the police officers their right to be innocent until proven guilty.

Tell you what….I am willing to eat dog food for a year for a lot less, steal a car, go on a high speed chase and resist arrest for the same amount, and ram a cop if impunity is granted.

Please, all of you, Americans of African Origin….it is boring! You are boring. Stop whining, get up and fight. You are contributing to the perpetuation of your own victimization by being so thin skinned. Promote successful African Americans and stop standing for the people out for a quick buck, or a victim status. You are and deserve better and should believe in it. Each time the Sharptons side for a wrong cause, or each time the race card is obviously pulled, sympathizers drift away.

That is how I feel right now, as a foreigner who came here and has less rights, privileges or protection that African Americans, the wealthiest black population of the world that has been provided with the most opportunities ever.

Stop whining, get up, and fight for the right things

Lebanon 2006. The tragedy goes in the country of the Cedar tree! 

For the past 18 months, following the murder of prime minister of the time, Mr Rafik Hariri, roadside bombs have claimed the lives of politicianss and Journalists.

In February 2005, an improvised explosive device (IED) estimated to one ton of high explosives blew up while Hariri’s motorcade drove by..

Hariri was openly opposed to a Syrian plan to extend the presidential term in Lebanon, extension that would have benefited its puppet government. His death was attributed to Syria of course, but for a while the BBC also blamed America and Israel and pushed forward a conspiracy theory stating that because both countries were interested in having Syria turned into the“Black sheep”of the world for its active support to the insurgency in Iraq and to the anti-Israel Hezbollah in Lebanon, both had a good motive for such a twisted plan. 

Eventually, that assassination led to the withdrawal of the Syrian forces from Lebanon and their redeployment on the 600kms Syrian border with Iraq, and the UN just passed a resolution to setup a special tribunal to bring the murderers to justice and find who pulled the strings. 

Last week, pro-Westerner and anti-Syrian Pierre Gemayel, son of the former president, Minister of industry and Christian Phalangist was murdered in public, shot along with his body guard by hitmen that ambushed his car and used silenced pistols, a first in the Lebanese political crime history that has been dominated by roadside bombs (the highest the target, the bigger the bomb!).

What has happened?  

Syria was officially collaborating with the investigation and complying with the UN, the USA, Israel, and their specific demands.

Would Bashar Al Assad, President of the Syrian Arab Rebublic (actually more like a religious Allawite dictatorship over a Sunni-Shia majority), be so short-sighted as to have ordered that execution? After all, he already seems to be deeply related to the Hariri assassination. 

The Syrian president had overtly tried to get the term of the current Syrian puppet president in Lebanon extended (Emile Lahoud) and Gemayel was strongly opposed to the idea. That is a possible motive!

Furthermore, the Lebanese law states that the government must be dissolved if one third of its 24 members becomes“unavailble”or resign. Some see the recent Crime spree as a mean to covertly overthrow the current administration that is now two resignations or deaths short of the required third. That could be a motive too!

Finally, two“rival”Christian parties (one pro and one against Syria) represent the Christians of Lebanon and the murder could have had some negative effect in the Christian community and profited the pro-syrian group led by Aoun. Another motive?

Throw the Hezbollah in the mix and its claims of political legitimacy (the group was one of the government’s majority faction until its 6 members resigned to protest the post Hariri assasssination anti-Syrian campaigns), the Israelo-Hezbollah war conducted from the Southern borders, and the historical Syrian claim for the land of Lebanon that should have been part of a Great Syria, and you can see why this powder keg is ready to blow. 

Now what?

Lebanon is in trouble and a civil war looms again.

Pro-Syrians versus anti-Syrians

Sunnis against Shiites, and Druzes.

Christians against Muslims.

Pro-Syrians Christians against anti-Syrians Christians

Lebanese against Hezbollah.

Pro-Syrians and Hezbollah versus anti-Syrians.

Israel against Hezbollah and eventually against Lebanese forces.

Syria against anti-Syrian Lebanese to help out pro-Syrian Lebanese that called for help.

Israel against Syria.

Israel against Syria, Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon. 

The combinations are endless and a troubling reminder of another civil war, another time, when all the religious groups and factions had their militias slaughtering each other while Israel was fichting Arafat’s PLO in Beyrouth.

To top it up, America will certainly use as the leverage any proof of the Syrian involvement in the murders as a tool to force Bashar Al Assad to stop supporting the insurgency in Iraq and shut the Syrian border with Iraq to any kind of trafic in exchange of some kind of“immunity”. 

Most likely, Lebanon will pay a big price soon in the name of a bigger picture, another lamb sacrificed on the altar of a local but bigger geopolitics game

Slippery slope!

Outraged by some has-been comedian that has used the“N”word in anger, thin-skinned African American leaders are now pushing for a ban of the use of that derogatory word that is still fashionable among youngsters and“artists”of African ancestry but definitely taboo from any other racial groups and not widely used anymore. It will be interesting to see if the so often quoted sacred American Freedom of speech is going to survive this attack or eventually succumb to the Political Correctness that is taking over whatever we do or say. If it does, than we have to expect other offensive words to follow such as White Trash, Trailer trash, White boy, Snow white, Red Neck, Moron, Fat (…) and so many other that have the power to offend others. Tell you what! It is all a matter of education and skin thickness. Derogatory words, offensive epithets, slurs, discrimination and profiling are fact of life all over and one can get offended 24/7. But what do I know? I am just a Frog, a Frenchie, a French fry (French immigrants not to mix up with the famous Freedom Fries!), a Cheese-eating Surrender Monkey (the Simpsons).

Election are not about us now.

Elections are about the future. 

The broken roads, the broken levies, or the broken school system are the symbol of what has gone wrong in our political system.

Money has long been earmarked for their maintenance or improvement, through sales taxes, gasoline taxes, home taxes, or the Lottery, but elected officials have used it for other things with malice, and have sold us to the Bond system without remorse. 

We are a State“in bondage”, perversely tied into long term loans, willingly voting every year to raise our own taxes, or raise the taxes of somebody or something else that is going to raise prices to make up for the losses.

When we shoot ourselves in the foot, we want the big gun, the 50 caliber, the“Big Bertha”…after all, WE are California and happy cows come from California, don’t they? Keep on milking us please! 

We could–we should- demand the broken system to be fixed before throwing more money at it. After all, don’t we fix the leak of the swimming pool before filling it up, or fix an exhaust pipe before testing a car for smog? Nope! Not here! In California, it looks like a majority of voters don’t pay taxes at all. Or else, how could one explain why propositions for more bonds and more taxes would pass?

Common sense is just gone, along with accountability and fiscal responsibility, flushed down the toilets. 

Elections are about the future, the legacy for our children. When we vote, we have the duty to continue the good things, fix what is broken, and to put an end to the bad.

Where does the money go?

Well, once money has been allocated to something, offices are setup, people hired to manage it, salaries and perks distributed, consultants hired to spend it, lawyers paid to protect it, buddies and relatives brought over for high paid fictional work. Eventually the something ends up not being done, and more money is put on the ballot for these people to finally do the work. Do the words‘Stem Cell Research”sound familiar? 

California voted, and ten years from now, while teenager girls will still secretly be guided through abortion in our schools, my daughter will get her first jobs and start repaying the debts we have imposed upon her because we are just short term minded, irresponsible and selfish. Add to that the new Asian-Middle East new nuclear threats,“global terrorism”and the world wide ecological disaster and you will understand how bad we, the People, have failed our children

Violence in Iraq, again: a summary for you to understand what is happening there. 

Shiites are killing Shiites; Shiites are also killing Sunnis; Shiites are killing Shiites that kill Sunnis; Shiites are killing Kurds, and Shiites are killing Shiites that kill Kurds. Eventually, Shiites are also killing allied soldiers and killing Shiites that kill allied soldiers. Furthermore, Sunnis are killing Shiites and Shiites that kill Shiites, on top of slaughtering Shiites that kill Kurds and Shiites that kill Shiites that kill Kurds. Eventually, Sunnis are also killing allied soldiers and killing Sunnis that kill allied soldiers. To top it up, Sunni and Shiite suicide bombers are blowing up regular Iraqis. Police forces affiliated to sectarian groups are also in a rampage, when they are not targeted by the“Death squads”of the other groups. Finally, foreign fighters are killing the murderous Shiites and Sunnis for their not forwarding the cause of Islam against the crusaders. To make it simpler, Iran is financing the needs of both the Shiites and the Shiites that kill the Shiites, hoping that they will eventually stop fighting each other and will start killing Sunnis. Meanwhile, some crazy clerics, in the name of their own variation of the Muslim faith, are calling for the destruction of the other sects in a bloody race for survival and ultimate power. Caught in the middle of this killing frenzy, allied forces are trying to stabilize a shaky government and impose Democracy on the blood thirsty killers. Now you understand why dictatorship worked in Iraq!

I don’t want to sound like I am bashing the religion described by Iranian President Ahmadinejad as“a peaceful, beautiful and complete religion”but I am fascinated by the obvious contradiction between what we hear and what we see and would love some answers. A local Imam, in Sacramento, claimed that October, the month of Ramadan, was“the month of charity, worship, humility and forgiveness for all Muslims around the globe”, a time“to focus inwardly”. Since then, sectarian violence has increased 43%!

In 1991, in the Middle of the Sahara, South of Libya, after firing a few round of Kalashnikov and after the sunset prayer, my local Muslim guide–and friend- told me that there was only one God and many ways to adore him. Why so much wisdom…and so much violence?

Churchill once said that America always end up doing the right thing….after trying everything else. What would the right thing be?

Unions protecting the interests of correctional officers and other prison guards are angry at a plan to move 2000 inmates to private prisons out of California. Of course they are claiming that paying private corporations to manage prisons violate the constitution (despite the fact that we already do it here) and that they are only concerned for the safety of the prisoners. For the past years, the same unions have begged again and again for more prisons, more money, and more guards to better handle the overcrowding of our jails, while throwing millions into self-serving politics and pointing accusing fingers at the administration. Reportedly, the new cost for the daily handling of these 2000 inmate will be $63 a head, roughly $126.000 a day. I wonder what is the daily cost for handling 2000 inmates in California? I know it does not matter because taxpayers foot the bill, but still, what does it cost? Today, Arnold does not need the prison guard political machine to win these elections and can patch the overcrowding of the prisons without catering to their special interests. It is payback time! Don’t you love dirty politics? 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Almost a month ago, on the opinion forum of the Bee, we got to read“A Muslim leader&apos;s plea”written by Imam Muhammed Abdul-Azeez, Sacramento (SALAM Islamic Center). Courageously, he stated that at a time when Muslims were offended by the Pope,“Responding to the (pope&apos;s) remarks that Muslims are violent by committing violence is certainly not the most convincing refute”and also said that it was time for them to“learn to respond to words with just words .“ Interestingly, he also stated that it was the month of Ramadan,“the month of charity, worship, humility and forgiveness for all Muslims around the globe”, a time“to focus inwardly”. Since then, our media have been reporting a steady and serious increase in the bloody sectarian death toll in Iraq where Muslims are daily torturing and executing other Muslims by the hundred (43% increase in sectarian violence since midsummer). If Islam does not want to be mislabeled, peace-loving and moderate Muslims should better come out and explain to us how to read these mixed signals we get from“Muslims around the world”on that Muslim month of charity. Obviously, for many Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq, Ramadan is not a time for forgiveness but rather equals to an open season on other Muslims. I don’t want to sound like I am bashing the religion described by Iranian President Ahmadinejad as“a peaceful, beautiful and complete religion”but I am fascinated by the obvious contradiction between what we hear and what we see and would love some answers. In 1991, in the Middle of the Sahara, South of Lybia, after firing a few round of Kalashnikov and the sunset prayer, my local Muslim guide–and friend- told me that there was only one God and many ways to adore him.Why the inter-Muslim violence?

Stuck!

America is definitely divided between the“Red”and the“Blue”, the two big self serving party machines that finally destroyed the idea of Democracy and the whole electoral concept.

There is not such a thing anymore as a credible alternative (i.e. Green, Independent, Libertarian…) because a successful modern election campaign revolves around two things these“peanut gallery”parties don’t have: one of the big party’s endorsement and its fundraising machine.

When is the last time a third party candidate has been elected in a key State or Federal position?

Are these parties“left over”to make us believe that we do have a choice? 

Take the Doolittle/Brown race as an example.

Doolitle is hundred percent Republican, running under the Republican banner, backed up by Republicans and Republican money.

Brown is kind of new in the paysage and when one go through his positions on big issues such as universal health care (pro), the war (against), abortion (pro), gay marriage (against), Gun control (against), he is not in the Democratic main stream of ideas, nor is he in the Republican’s.

He could have been a good independent runner, a third party candidate…or could he? 

Without one of the two labels, would an independent Brown have come so far as to threaten Doolittle’s long held seat?

It is doubtful that any of the parties would have tolerated the intrusion of an outsider for such an important position, and Brown would have run under something else but the Red or Blue banner, he would have most likely been stomped by the elephants or kicked out by the donkeys.

If you cannot beat them, join them!

Running as a Democrat despite his non-party line positions have allowed him to really stand up to Doolittle thanks to the weight of the party he chose to represent. Good for him!

For voters, I am not sure of what this attitude conveys and they are faced–again- with a great dilemma:

Should Republicans go simple, follow the party line and vote for the candidate of their party, no questions asked, nor answered?

Should Democrats go simple, follow the party line and vote for the candidate of their party, no questions asked, nor answered?

Should voters vote for a Brown because he looks like an independent thinker despite his official affiliation? Once elected (if elected), is he going to fully rally to his sponsor (payback time) or stick to his convictions even if they are not party-line?

Should disheartened Republicans vote for Brown because they don’t really like Doolittle anymore?

Should disheartened Republicans not vote at all, to make a statement before the presidential?

Should disheartened Democrats vote for Doolittle because they don’t really like Brown?

Should disheartened Democrats not vote at all, to make a statement before the presidential?

Should“third party”voters vote for the“less worse”of the two“evils”, a thing they do all the time when they vote?

Should voters vote for the party, the ideas, or the person?

Should voters stay home and not waste another otherwise pretty useful Tuesday? 

I am sorry voters are stuck and that eventually, at the poll stations, they end up voting for people they don’t know, or don’t like, just because there is no real choice anymore.

When, as an outsider, I listen to the“negative campaigning”and other mud slinging; I wonder why people still vote for the candidates, why the victims of the smearing don’t sue for defamation of character if they are really innocent, why State or Federal officials don’t look into the allegations, why candidates are not kicked out of politics if found guilty.

Once voters have been beat down by the political propaganda, lied to by partisan politics, and denied the facts and truth they should be entitled to in order to make their choices, what is left?

A vote by default, a choice between a Doolittle and a Brown, a Bush and a Kerry, a“yet-to-be-named”outstanding unknown Republican and a Hillary, or some other outstanding unknown Democrats, people the two parties are going to pull out of their hats and mold into a superstar, the next“savior”!



I am a legal immigrant on a Green card and cannot vote. So I will seat on the side and watch the same sad political comedy repeat itself again, and again. 

 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly!  

Recently, America reached two important milestones.

The first one is that our population reached 300 millions. I am assuming that the figure accounts for the legal citizens only - documented dead voters included - and does not take into account the millions of illegal immigrants–undocumented“legal”workers included–that actually live openly within our open borders. Knowing now that the Census bureau cannot even account for its laptops, I am still kind of questioning the accuracy of the reports it trumpets all around….Okay, so in 2006, America actually reached the 300 millions mark!(plus or minus a couple of millions?).

The other report that I thought was more interesting was an analysis of new census figures by The New York Times claiming that married couples were making less than 50% of the American households (49.7 percent, or 55.2 million, of the nation&apos;s 111.1 million households in 2005 were made up of married couples)   

 The Good! 

I came here in 1999 and something I learned quickly is that there in no more Melting Pot, no more identification to a nation, borders, a culture, a language, a religion or a Flag. Nope, nada! In the name of equality, the American people have been divided in thin-skinned minority special entitled groups. In the name of diversity, Americans have been made ferociously aware of their differences and separated, by origins, races, languages, religions, sexual preferences, weight, health, income, wealth, region, political preferences… 

You are not Americans anymore but African American or White non Hispanic, middle class or/and disenfranchised, heterosexual or out of the closet gay-lesbian-transgender-cross-dressed, rich (starts at middle class) or left behind, Republican or Democrat, red or blue, or a combination of all of the above.

I always joke that I wished I were a minority disabled female veteran with some native American blood, or something similar that grants you a state employment for life, or preferential treatment wherever you go! Well….it finally happened! I am minority now….officially!  

I feel special today because I got a new identity as protected specie! As of now, married couples are entitled to respect, attention, perks and all the affirmative action other minority groups get everyday (you wish!)! Isn’t it cool? Watch out, we are special! 

 The Bad! 

We have become a society where personal responsibility is gone and where as long as you say“I am sorry”everything is fine, no matter what you did or said. No responsibility, no commitment. Everything is under warranty and can be returned, no question asked. Test drive a car, test drive a computer, test drive a pet, test drive a girl friend. You don’t like what you got, discovered that a puppy barks and poops, found a cheaper computer, had a fight with your partner….no problem! Call it a quit! Return the car, take the doggie to the shelter, repack the PC, dump your girlfriend for her sister and start all over….come on! It is money back guaranteed! You cannot beat it. 

Furthermore, our society has also become a society steered to the immediate fulfillment of any pleasure. Why wait when you can get it now, whether you can afford it or not? Zero percent financing, no money down, good or bad credit! Get it now, don’t wait, you deserve it; you are entitled to everything and anything you wish for, even a marriage. Weddings have been lowered to the level of commodities, something you need to get sometimes, like a dishwasher and a flat screen TV, and something you don’t need to keep, something that carries an expiration date, but not a challenge. 

Commercialization, marketing and money took over! They have already ruined the true Spirit of Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas, and marriage is next! When and if one gets married, it is not for the commitment anymore (until death?) but for the show, another set of tacky lights on the roof of your superficial life! Are lack of commitment to do it or while in it, added to the regular ridiculing of the sacrament by agenda driven groups, killing the marriage?

 The Ugly! 

When my children were younger, my daughter wanted to marry me and my son wanted to marry my wife. I always told them:“no problem kids! Right after the ceremonies we will move to“Campturkey”( KY ?)”. Family joke aside, I did not have to move far to see it live! There is a“Campturkey” in California, under the spotlights of the media where the cross-bred breed like la bunch of horny lemmings at spring, before the mythical (but fake) migration to death over the cliff (I wish!). Hollywood and its“role models”are all over the media, regular or tabloid. We are daily fed with cancelled week long marriages, divorces, kids out of wed locks claimed by multiple fathers, promiscuity, sex videos, unfaithfulness, drunkenness, drug addictions, perversions“a la Bambi”, and all these nice things that make show biz go round. 

 Add to that our singing stars and the values most of them lip-sing, without forgetting other controversial public figures, like the pedophile priests or our elected officials addicted to Interns and Pages, and you will see what happened to the“traditional values”. I am not a prude nor am I a“saint”. But come on…Do you think it is healthy to hammer us everyday with the messed up life of so many of our“idols?”Our real life has just become one of these cheap afternoon soap dishes!“The bald and the beautiful”or“Degenerate housewives”have turned into reality show, with the pretty boys with no morals and the pretty girls with no brain nor virtue, the unhealthy romances, the twists, the treasons, the rebounds…

 To top it up, the Gay and Lesbian community also came after the marriage and tried to appropriate it like they have already done with my children’s rainbow. Why do they want“my”marriage so bad that they have to mimic it wherever they got their wish granted? I don’t care if they want to officialize their union with their partners and I do believe that they should be entitled to the same legal protections and rights a legal union provide, but they must call it something else…and they need to stop the hetero-like Tux and White dress thing….that is freaky!. 
 

I met my wife 23 years ago and I still remember how worriless and easy our life was before we finally got married; we did not feel“stuck”with each other and did not really need to invest into the relationship. A marriage is such an unnatural thing for the tie-wearing animals that we are. It needs a permanent investment from both parties, a common will to make it work, a lot of giving and forgiving. It needs work! 
Irresponsibility, non commitment and instant gratification are not the right combinations for a successful relationship….but what do I know, I am French, the country of the“ménage a trois”!?


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Front page material? A fourteen year old girl got interviewed by the secret services because she posted death threats to the President on her“Stab Bush”“Political”blog. Good! Nothing better than a good spanking to straighten up opinionated teenagers and show them that the law applies to them too, and that if one ignores the laws, one better shut up and keep a low profile. That being said, I find it amazing that a fourteen year old can be actively militant and have any strong political orientation. When you total her life experience - the 3 years in diapers, two years crawling at the carpet level, three or four years of Barbie, a year of Barbie and whoever the new boy friend is, the braces, the hormones kicking, the hunt for the black heads, the election of the school treasurer and the so called“molecular science”classes- you wonder where she found out that she was a liberal and that she hated Bush…I am sure that she vividly remembers the Clinton’s years and can compare! (LOL as they say). Maybe the parents are confusing the time of innocence with the time for indoctrination? Maybe they should better pay attention to what their daughter does on the Internet….just maybe! In the meantime, they might have found a clue because their teenager daughter hates Bush, instead of them, a rare occurrence at this age where parents are often blamed for everything (and a common occurrence for GW to be blamed for everything from Global Warming to the Ice age). Whatever…she made the front page and will soon appear on 20/20 or another“tabloidic”celebrity making freak show.

Monica yesterday.

Fowley today.


Interestingly, the Republicans are reacting strongly to what has happened when compared to the way the Democrats reacted 15 years ago with one of them…

Is pedophilia a crime in 2006 fror a Republican? Was it honorable in 1983?

Congressman Gary Studds (his porn movie name?) and his preying on congressional pages back in 1983: during the course of the House Ethics Committee&apos;s investigation, Studds publicly acknowledged his homosexuality and his relationship with a 17 year old male page. As the House read their censure of him, Studds turned his back and ignored them. Later, at a press conference with the former page standing beside him, the two stated that what had happened between them was nobody&apos;s business but their own. In the case of Foley the Republicans have reacted with revulsion due to his relationship with a minor and he has stepped down from his position in Congress. In the case of Studds the Democrats honored his pedophelia and elected him to five more terms in the House.

Does it look like we are finally going to have a national ID card?

It is about time we come up with some real ID, let say, something like my Green card, half plastic and half digital, hard to counterfeit and easy to scan for detailed identification data. Sure, teenagers and Illegal immigrants are not going to be happy about it…no more underage drinking on a fake ID for our partying kids! No more of anything from driver licenses to voting for illegal aliens! Well, unless the ACLU and liberals have their way of course!

Gee….what a concept! Only legit citizens will be untitled to what they pay for….at least a spark of common sense from our elected officials in DC!

What do you think of it?


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The pope infuriated Muslims across the world when he quoted a conversation on Christianity and Islam held 600 years ago between a Persian intellectual, and a Byzantine Christian emperor.

He basically said that Islam was described as evil and inhuman because it preached the converting by the sword of the“non-believers”and other“men of the books”(Christians!). What the Pope described was a 600 years old view of the Islam of the time, something one can use to draw a parallel with the modern age views of the fundamentalists that wage a religious war all over the globe, Al Qaeda militants and other Taliban or Iranian maniacs included.

He said:“‘Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached,’””

To this inflammatory speech,“peace loving Muslims”led by fundamentalist replied with violent demonstrations, effigies of the Pope set on fire, and pledges to“break the cross and spill the wine”. They have already killed a nun in Somalia, and firebombed two churches in Palestine (Orthodox and Anglican: that shows you how smart some are! J)…

Was the Pope kind of sort of right?

President Ahmadinejad said Islam is &quot;a peaceful, beautiful and complete religion.&quot; Why the violence?

Are the fundamentalist making the Pope’s point by resorting to violence and threats?

When is the last time a Catholic strapped himself in an explosive vest and blew up a Mosque? When is the last time a Jew blew up a restaurant in Germany? When is the last time a Buddhist chopped the head off a Taliban that blew up century old Buddhist statues in Afghanistan?

Thank you for your thoughts….and remember the Danish cartoons!

How can I ever forget 9/11 with a wife flight attendant and a birthday on September 12?

Amazingly, 2006 seems to be the year of remembrance for America, with scores of documentaries, movies, dramatizations, books and reports! Even Bin Laden re-appeared for the occasion…Elections are closing and the tragedy is being manipulated and abused by about everybody with a voice, turning this fifth anniversary into a pathetic comedy, a power trip by the partisan media and unscrupulous politicians. Do I feel safer today? Definitely not since“criminal profiling”is still prohibited, since our borders and ports of entry are still wide open, since we unilaterally have to play fair when the enemy does not need to, since many Americans believe that 9/11 was a conspiracy and that Arabs had nothing to do with it, since the ACLU-like lawyers are still standing against common sense, since political correctness gags us, since“moderate Islam”is still mute, since our“self-centerdness”and arrogant stupidity still prevents us to see where our survival lays.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Only one question for you today:  

In our XXI century of twisted values, how can a dead Israeli or Lebanese civilian be a worldwide victory for the Hezbollah and a defeat for Israel? Any comment on this new amazing trend?


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Jane Doe was on the phone with her dishwasher when she ran the light and was pulled over by an officer. Her day started as usual with her alarm clock forwarding a wake up call to her cell that reminded her to take a shower, brush her teeth, wear clean underwear and get a Latte. At ten am, the dog feeder notified her PDA that it was down to one quarter full. At noon, she received an email from Microsoft and Whirlpool telling her that soon, her washer and dryer would also be online and able to report critical things such as the end of a wash cycle or the condition of the filters. In the meantime, John was monitoring the temperature of the beer in the fridge and was getting automatic calls from his recorder for each football game successfully burnt on DVD. John and Jane are much happier now that they can interact live with their appliances, and they hope that soon the Hoover fertility monitor will call them to tell them that it is time to procreate and generate more little“connected”freaks. If that lifestyle ever becomes“in”, I am out!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Let us take a break from our Southern borders and our shameless politicians for some introspection, a deeper look to our insides! Literally!

Organ trafficking is a pretty lucrative international market and recently, a mortuary home around Los Angeles had been exposed for“parting out”bodies they were paid to respectfully bury or cremate and selling the removed organs to medical related facilities or individual. Everything went from kidneys to skull, lungs to limbs…. If in America, legal and ethical barriers have been set, internationally, from China to South America and Africa, harvesting organs from dead and live patients can even be state sponsored. China harvests its incarcerated population (while in the US, inmate, lifers, get access to organ transplant and compete for them with the honest population!) and many countries have laws that actually make it legal for a live person to sell, or buy, organs. Not in my backyard, you are all screaming! Well, actually, in America, even if it is not really legal, we already had some instances of good“matches”being offered loads of cash for selling a non vital part of themselves!

If you look at the stem cell research, it is not too far off and we now allow the“harvesting”of aborted fetuses to feed our dream of immortality. Further away, in international waters, on ships or retired oil platforms, renegade surgeons or scientists (enlightened???), test human cloning and other medical things most of the world rejected.

From our cozy and safe living room in suburbia, when reading about WW2, the camps and“the doctors of the devil”, we kind of wonder what happened and why. These people who profit from our fear to die and perform these unethical experiments are exactly the same breed as the Nazi doctors. Give them an once of legitimacy and you will see….and be frighten.

Mr Cedillo....we are done with your pet bill on illegal immigrants and drivers licenses. How many time do people have to say NO for you to understand? NO is NO in English and in Spanish, so stop wasting our time and money, and the time you are paid for by your electorate to do something good for US. Illigals didn&apos;t put you in office! Illegals don&apos;t pay your salary and other perks! Don&apos;t you have anything better to do on tax payers money? They are illegal and we don&apos;t have to waste any money on background checks because we already know that they broke the laws of OUR country. Just let it go!


I wish you&apos;d run for a bill promoting a &quot;term limit&quot; of five years for every Californian bills: whether it has beren rejected or voted in, no bill can be challenged or re-proposed within five years

War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling, which thinks that nothing is worth war, is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. - John Stuart Mill ~ (1868) 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If we believe what recent drive-by bloggers from the left have claimed in past blogs, King George is manipulating world events and his administration is behind the London terror fear and the many re-routed airplanes. Elections are coming and Americans need to be frightened into voting Republicans!
A recent poll also demonstrated that one third of the polled citizens still believe in 2006 that the Bush administration was actively involved in 9-11, in the destruction of the Twin towers, the Pentagon, and the crashed flight 93. http://www.scrippsnews.com/911poll 

Do you believe that all the crews of the re-routed airplanes are Republicans on the administration payroll?
Do you believe US“dark republican”forces were behind 9-11?
Do you believe that the exposed terror plot in the UK, the 18 terrorists of the Netherlands, and the three unexploded nail bombs in German trains have been planted by operatives of the Bush administration to prevent Democrats to regain control of the White House?
Do you believe that without the US intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq, the world would be a better place and North Korea, China, and Iran would have never felt like they needed to develop a nuclear arsenal to defend themselves?
Do you believe that Somalia, Yemen, Ethiopia, Western Sahara and the Sudan would be love filled tourist destinations without King George?
Do you think Iran, Syria, Islamic maniacs, Hamas, Hezbollah and the PLO only want, preach and finance the total annihilation of the Jewish race because America supports Israel?


Do you believe that the Congo, Ivory Coast, Burma, Nepal, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Chechnya, Lebanon, Cyprus, the former Yugoslavia, and all the dozens of conflicts in the world are the result of the Bush administration?
Do you believe that tomorrow, a democrat at the White house would put an end to all these recurrent and historical religious, ethnic and sectarian conflicts and spread peace, happiness and hamburgers throughout the world?


Is peace the only alternative to war? Should it be?


Are all the wars bad or can you think of any &quot;good&quot; war?


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In today’s news, I read that TSA employees will take over from contract employees to check IDs at airports and that they will all attend a training in“psychological profiling”. What the heck is that?

Profiling right now should be based on race and religion only, until more newly converted white Caucasian join the terrorist cause for some twisted murderous reason. No more random selection for the extra search should be made by the computers that manage the ticketing!

Political correctness is literally killing us! We need more spies infiltrating the mosques, more devices monitoring radical imams, more control of our borders, more background investigations, more scrutiny, and more common sense!

These people are out to kill as many civilians as possible! The plot would have gone through, about 3000 people would have perished, fallen in mid ocean. Just another 9-11, just the medicine our airlines and our economy needs.

Like Hezbollah that has spent its time trying to hit civilians targets in Israel, while fighting among a Lebanese civilian human shield, the terrorists just want to achieve a body count, a huge one. It is time to wake up!

Liberals, right wingers, Peacenicks….we are all potential victims and they will not spare any of us.

I know who the enemy is. Do you???


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


On the one hand, we have a famous terrorist group the UN was to disarm, a group holding Lebanon hostage and fighting there a Syrian and Iranian proxy war against Israel. On the other hand, we have the Israeli forces held to higher fighting standards, spreading leaflets,and doing whatever is possible in a military conflict to spare an apathetic Katrina-like population. The equation is pretty simple but yet to be seen in the biased media: Hezbollah has always been a &quot;bad guy&quot;. The group prepared the war (15.000 rockets stockpiled, bunkers in urban areas, new anti tank technology….) and started it. Hezbollah wants the death of as many civilians as possible, in Israel where it fires hundreds of“fire, forget and hope they will hit a densely populated urban area”rockets, and in Lebanon where it uses the population as a human shield. Israel fights for its survival and is trying to limit civilian casualties at the price of a longer and slower war of attrition that will eventually weaken Hezbollah and certainly destroy Lebanon again. How can a dead civilian be a worldwide victory for the terrorist and a defeat for Israel?


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Fed up with the drive-by US liberal or Arab anti-Jew bloggers that keep on claiming the modern land of Palestine for its alleged original owner, the Palestinian people, I decided to take a ride in my time-traveling Yugo and figure out by myself if an injustice had been committed against the“Palestinian”people, thus explaining the anti-Semitic feelings Arab nations and their terrorist off-springs have for Israel. I could have taken the easy way and moved back to what most of the people consider as the beginning of it all: November 29, 1947, when the UN voted on resolution 181, which approved the partition of the western part of Palestine into a predominately Jewish state and a predominately Arab state. Remember that only 13 countries formulated a“No”vote (Afghanistan, Cuba, Egypt, Greece, India, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Yemen) and that the next day, most of them started the bloodshed by proxy or directly.

But I decided to move a little earlier, to the aftermath of the war that ended all the wars. 
From my personal library, I dug out a 1922 Atlas of the post WW1 world describing among other things“the new old land of promise in Palestine”under British Mandate. After WW1, interestingly, the British government was mandated by the League of Nations to facilitate“the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”. Eventually, the Jews worldwide saw it as“an opportunity to the return of national power and unity in a free nation controlled by its ancient inhabitants”and the New York Times of the day summarized the Jewish aspirations by saying:“The effect of the mandate is to create a national home, a refuge for Jews who, because of oppression or persecution in any other land, may desire to seek shelter there”(The literary Digest Atlas, p38, 1922). 

By 1921, the 515,000 Muslims in Palestine were already at odds with the 63,000 Jews and the 62,000 Christians that also considered that piece of land sacred and prompted the British Secretary of States of the time, Winston Churchill, to declare:“Palestine belongs to the whole world, and this city of Jerusalem is almost equally sacred to Moslems, Christians and Jews, and not only to the DWELLERS in Palestine, but everywhere. Instead of sharing miseries through quarrelling, the Palestinians should share blessing through cooperation.” 

Furthermore, at the same time, G. A. Smith, in his“Historical Geography of the Holy Land”(London), also wrote that“By a strange turn of events, the Philistines, those ancient enemies of the Children of Israel, have succeeded in giving their name to the whole country, for“Palestine”is directly derived of Philistine”. 

Interesting, isn’t it how history keeps on repeating itself, all over again, and again!

This took me further down in time and an Internet search of the Philistines brought up troves of information. 

The Philistines, literally the“people of the sea”, were the people archeologically linked to Western Anatolia or Mycenaean Greece (Cyprus, Crete) that INVADED the Egyptian Southern coast of Canaan circa 1160 BC, just before the Israelites arrived and created their 6 million people“Kingdom of David and Solomon”that covered the land from the Sinai to the Mediterranean, from the Jordan river to most of Syria included Damascus and the Beirut of today! Maybe Palestine should be returned to Egypt or Greece, and Syria and Lebanon to Israel!
Isn’t it ironic that the Philistines weren’t Arab, that they invaded an Egyptian coastal land that is almost the Gaza strip of today, occupied the cities of Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashod and Ekron, and spent the time they were not fighting the Egyptians, fighting their Hebrew neighbors of the highlands. 

Isn’t it ironic that the Philistines were characterized as cunning pagan warmongers by the Jews and as pirates and marauders by the Egyptians?
Isn’t it ironic that the modern Jews of the“highland”have finally returned the land of the Philistines–the Gaza strip- to the modern Arab people that claim it today, but that it eventually led to a new open war? Isn’t it ironic that the Arab world thinks that Gaza is not enough and also want to give the original Jewish land to the new Philistines?
Isn’t it ironic that the name Philistine could come from the Semitic word Plishah that means invasion, and that only in the XIX century did writers start officially referring to the Philistines as being the Arab people native of Palestine?
Finally, isn’t it ironic that one of the common meanings of the word Philistine describes a close minded person?



Now–and again- does it really matter if the chicken or the egg was there first? And if it matters, can we at least be honest about it?

Hatred between the two people was there then, and is still kept alive today by foreign Arab powers interested in the destabilization of the region and using the resentment for a proxy war that serves their interests and preserves a“justification”for their Islamic terrorist off-springs across the world. You are right! They are right! Let us redraw the borders, do right for the people who were wronged! 

But where to start? How far back? Iran and Iraq were Persia. The rest was Egypt, Arabia and the Ottoman Empire. Just take a look at Europe today, pre-1989 (Berlin, the Wall), pre and post WW2, pre and post WW1, pre and post 1870, pre and post any major conflict or invasion that has shaken its borders every 50 years of its existence….Where do you want to start righting the wrongs? How far back? And is it really going to solve anything? Does it really matter anyway?

Maybe, just maybe, Iran and Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas should have given a chance to the planned Palestinian referendum on the existence of an independent Palestine and on the recognition of Israel. But the outcome of such a vote could have deprived them from their anti-Jewish rhetoric. The Palestinian people, like their Lebanese neighbors, are just held hostages by powers that use them as proxy for their crazy causes. That Israel gave Gaza back and bulldozed its own colons out of the strip of land was not enough of a step in the right direction for them. Total annihilation has been sought since 1947 at the price of many wars and bloodshed that have permanently weakened Egypt and Syria, almost destroyed Jordan, and annihilated the fabrics of Palestine and Lebanon.

I am disgusted by the same old titles all over our revisionist media that conveniently single out every Israeli attack or alleged casualties without EVER showing us the picture of an Israeli house destroyed by a Hezbollah missile, or even without bothering to remind us that Israelis got rewarded for returning the Gaza strip with elections that put the terrorist group Hamas in power, and renewed attacks from Gaza AND Lebanon. The stench of our free press just….makes me sick!
Where is my bucket?

If Mexicans were launching rockets over Houston and kidnapping border guards, what would Americans do? Jerry knows! Americans would most likely find or make excuses for the attackers, and give up their sovereignty…head in the sand….butt in the air…ouch!

Israelis don’t take any…thing from anybody and they are darn right to go and expand their buffer zone to Lebanon today, Damascus or Teheran tomorrow!
I tried to understand why Hamas or the Hezbollah suddenly became so bold and aggressive. I wanted to understand why Iran and Syria unleashed their rabid dogs….
Any idea?
Maybe Iran has achieved a crude nuclear bomb and just got the new blueprints for a long range missile from his long time missile provider, North Korea! That would make the bearded maniac bolder!
What about Syria stirring the civil war and invasion pot in Lebanon to get it back…. Shiites in the South suddenly attack Israel. The Lebanese army is split between Sunnis and Shiites and cannot intervene to restore calm. Israelis take things in their own hands to secure their borders while demanding that the fragile Lebanese government does something…Syria is back….how convenient! Could happen too!
Or maybe, (the most likely choice) Iran and Syria just freaked out when they learned that for the first time in the history of their struggle that has long and largely been carried by terrorist groups, the Palestinian people were going to have a REFERENDUM and vote on the recognition of Israel and the existence of an independent Palestinian state….


Could it be possible that the terrorists don’t want Ali and Yasmina Doe to actually voice their opinion…Just maybe! From Indonesia to Afghanistan, Iraq to Gaza, the Palestinian struggle is the excuse for terrorism. What would happen if the Palestinian people actually wanted peace? Why are Palestinian armed groups supporting the referendum, and foreign backed groups doing everything to upset Israel?
Anyways….at least there is a lesson we can draw:
Two US soldiers were kidnapped, tortured, executed, mutilated….and we told the enemy that we understood why they were so merciless….after all, one of our tens of thousands of soldiers might have raped and killed there.
Three Israeli soldiers have been kidnapped…Israel is unleashing hell!
Guess why Arab states fear and respect Israel more than America?

I have already complained enough about the abuses of the first amendment and how free speech protects pan-handling, soliciting work on a sidewalk, flag and cross burning, yacking away in a cell phone…

Another thing that literally enrages me is the American Disability Act and the abuses it has generated. It drives me crazy when I see cars loaded with obese people sporting the handicapped sticker so they can park right at the entrance of their favorite junk food place. It drives me nuts when I read about these made up official“illnesses”such as the grooming disorder that protects the psychos and even allow lawsuits and money on top of special working arrangements and preferential treatments. Sure the ADA must have benefited real disabled persons, but its language is so vague that ambulance chasers allied with“disabled”con artists have made fortunes filing up lawsuits left and right and cashing settlements.

Should we, as a society, make it a norm to accommodate everybody, even small groups? Should we, as a society, make the fat people park on the other side of the parking lot to force them to exercise before eating or just accommodate their excesses and low self esteem? Should businesses accommodate wheelchairs, even cliff climbing or gymnastics shops? Should movie theatres playing vintage silent movies or painting galleries accommodate the blind? Should radio stations operate for the deaf? Should businesses adapt their cubicles to huge butts or should the persons go on a diet? Should the schools be forced to teach“learning challenged”kids? Should the governments be in the business of telling us how high the roll of toilet paper should be and where, left or right, the flushing handle should be positioned? Should we ban words like FAT, OBESE, PSYCHO, LUNATIC, CRAZY, STUPID and replace them with more adequate PC words? Should we redefine disabilities and handicaps using a common sense approach and not an emotional one? Should we ban lawyers from defining disabilities and treat lunatics instead of accommodating them?

The whole point of this posting is the following: how far should we go to accommodate everybody and do you think that the ADA has just been“hijacked”(to use a fashionable expression!)?

 2 US soldiers tortured and slaughtered despite of their status of prisoner of war that granted them the protection of the Geneva convention! 


Despite our anger and disgust for the permanent violations of the laws of war and Geneva conventions by the pigs in Turban back there, violation so conveniently ignored by our politicians and media, we cannot put all the Muslims and Middle Easterners in the same basket.
The majority out there lives in fear and pays a daily high price in blood from the same hands that claim to fight for them. In Iraq, Afghanisan, Somalia, War torn Congo or Ivory Coast, the regular Joe just wants to go on with his life and be left alone….
I do hope that our Officers and NCOs will make sure our troops understand that….we cannot have anymore“collateral”damages that our media, heart bleeding and liberal crowds are going to exploit for the benefit of the enemy…and at war, anger is a bad companion!



What a messed up world! I cannot wait to see if anybody out there will have the guts to stand up and say that the enemy has been blatantly violating all the common laws of war, that these two executions were the last drop, and that orders have been given to our troops: everything goes against any armed combattants, captured fighters. The Geneva convention is a 2 way street! They don’t abide by it, we won’t anymore and we will fight the way they do: dirty!



Sure, in my dreams….


What we are going to hear from now on are the“peace moms”like Cindy and other“wind cone”politicians (colorful, empty and blow with the wind!) saying that Bush is reesponsible, that we attacked them, that for the past 2006 years, since the conservative Christian Jesus started to interfere with Arab affairs, we have messed that part of the world and made them angry at us….
We are going to see the &quot;flip-flop&quot; Kerrys saying that they voted for the war but not for the violence, or Hillary-ous stating that the blood of these 2 kids is on the hands of all the anti-gay, anti-amnisty, anti immigration, Katrina creators, anti minority, pro war heterosexual conservative red necks! We are going to see fat spoiled college student throwing up against war in the streets of San Fran (like they actually did a couple of years ago), and finally to top it up, the sad sight of sagging breast over cottage-cheese bellies of the“Brests not boms”matrons of the Bay….did not make it up….and their nakedness is protected by the first! ( http://www.zombietime.com/breasts_not_bombs/ ).



We are not going to see people like me, spilling out their gut feelings in the streets and sending a clear message to the enemy: party is over!
Nope….we are going to see the self whipping crowd lamenting that it is all our fault, and even if we didn’t do it, somebody else did, or I forgot, but we are bad, so bad, we deserve every inch of it…blah, blah, blah…
The lambs to the slaughterhouse, vicitms!!!!



And finally, to wrap it up, wait until you see the crazy allegations the Kennedrunks or other Murthards are going to make, and how the media are going to run with it. By the way, I wonder what MC Cain has to say about that?


Tell you what....


I’d rather hunt with a Cheney than drive with a Kennedy!
I’d rather go to war with our troops than live your deballed peace!

”Represented as existing or as being as described but not so proved; supposed.”


This is one of the definitions of a word that is taking more and more importance in the legal and media vocabulary, a word that is often being misused in order to protect the“rights”of the criminals, and, a rather new phenomenon, a word used to smear“out of the blue”and forever a person that has not been proven guilty yet.

The word is“alleged”!

It used to be in the books that any accused person was innocent until proven guilty!

The concept was pretty clear and simple and the word“alleged”applied perfectly. Eventually, because criminals are starting to have more rights than regular citizens, the media and the lawyers started to misuse the word. Today, even when a culprit had been caught red handed, on the spot where the crime was committed, on camera and in front of witnesses, he becomes an“alleged suspect”despite the fact that everybody knew he is the real suspect.

It was easy to go a step higher and literally abuse the word, go from some vague or crazy allegations to the guilty verdict of the media before any trial by law.

This is happening all over, again and again and some recent high profile cases come to mind, like the Duke Lacrosse team alleged rape despite the lack of DNA evidence, proof, and testimonies contradicting the defense attorney and the DA. We already had one instance of“alleged”murder of civilians by the military that brought to the fore all the anti-military types in the media, references to Nazi Germany or to My Lai in Vietnam.

The interesting thing with these allegations that turn about anybody into a suspect, from John Doe, to teachers and alleged sexual misconducts, Police officers and alleged excessive force, soldiers and murders at war (…), is that it is now up to the accused to prove to the world that he/she is innocent. Furthermore, the person(s) or media that formulate or echo the allegations don’t even have to show proofs, or apologize when everything deflates and the“alleged”guilty party is cleared.

Actually, we had a good example on the last blog with Lisa re-inventing history, calling us idiots, while at the same time refusing to give us any references, authors, links….anything to back her statements or for us to research.

That is the way the world goes round now, a world designed by Mr Stupid for Mr Stupid. What do you think?

A quote from Roger, from FT Lauderdale:


1. We killed Zarqawi
2. The Iraqui cabinet is finally formed
3. Rove is free of charges
4. The economy is great
5. Unemployment is at its lowest since the 1960s
6. Bush visited Iraq much to the chagrin of the Dems
7. Bush is back up in the polls
8. Republicans held onto the seat in Southern California
9. Alqaida is running scared
10. Want more?….


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Zarqawi was a small time criminal ending up in such a position of power that he had to be taken out. He was a criminal, a murderer and Nick Berg’s screams will haunt me forever. I suggest that you go and download the video and explain to me, in total candor, how one can fight these animals? If you are against killing these guys, please, come forward and tell us why! I cannot wait!!!!!

The death of Zarqawi IS A GOOD THING for us! Sure Bush is profiting from it too….but what is your problem, you all in the conspiracy theory left side? Should Hillary-ous Clinton profit from it? Or Gore? or Billy boy? They enjoyed the dot.com ride and even took credit for inventing the Internet! Nobody complained! yeahhhh, right!

The death of Zarqawi IS A GOOD THING for Arabs, because he was responsible for the death of more“Muslim brothers”than Westerners (and we all know how the“brotherhood”goes between Muslim sects!).

The death of Zarqawi IS a good thing for all our soldiers that directly or not, put him on the run and finally cornered him. Champagne everybody! Good job, and remember, it is NEVER to late, as long as we don’t give up!!!

Despite what the Mohammad, Ali and Amhed say, leaders are not something you find under every pebble of sand and replacing him, rebuilding the network is going to take some time. Sure, one of these murderous ignoramuses is eventually going to strap an explosive vest and blow himself up someplace to avenge him, there or here, but this is the war we fight today, and Zarqawi and all the“blood-running-rivers”people are the enemy, outside or within.

What if we were to pick up the fight their dirty way, jeopardize their access to Heaven by rubbing our bullets in pigs fat, burying their dead with swines (like the Brits in India against Muslim rebels) and posting the movies on the internet, locking them up in Gitmo where they can commit suicide as much as they want (better there, alone, that with an explosive jacket in a mall!)….that would be a radical change….proactivity vs reaction!

We know that they are not following the Geneva’s convention requirements...if they don&apos;t, they cannot be protected by it!
So let’s take our gloves out and finish that thing, because like about Israel they don’t want peace, they just want the eradication of Israel and its people. The same applies to the US….and God forbid if you are a US jew!!!

We should all cheer for the blow the obscurantists sustained when 500 pounds of good old US high explosive ordnance sent Zarqawi to check if there is such a thing as heaven with virgins, or if hell is a better place for people like him. Remember that their holy book does not allow the murder of other“believers”, and hell is the price! He killed or commandeered the killings of so many that according to the same holy book he claimed to live by, he must be laying in a hot spot, not with hot chicks.

Now that I stepped out of the P.C world, let us judge the flood of hatred of our slogan preaching and brain-washed terrorist wannabees, and Muslim zealots that won’t resist screaming for revenge. In the middle of this sad affair, where are the moderate Muslims of the world? Are they mute....or scared???.

Immigration never had a racial overtone…slavery did.


Black Africans were captured by their own or by Muslims from the North and sold to slave traders.
Asians are enticed by Asian gangs under false pretense to come over here ILLEGALLY and end up in sweat shops or sex trade….slavery again!
Hispanics are convinced to come over by friend or familly members that found their way around our system to better their lives. The Mexican governement also wants to enjoy the $20 BILLIONS they send home while getting rid of its unemeployed population. The mob, Mexican and US, make tons of money smuggling them to US business more than happy to run modern age slaves under the protection of our politicians….slavery again.

Legal immigration is the key to get rid of these crimes! End of story.
LEGAL immigration made the country what it is, through the medical and criminal screening of Ellis Island, Angel Island, and tougher border control.

The 12 millions illegals (undocumented? :-) )should be given a deadline to register (if not immediate expulsion when found), do the paperwork , and learn English. 5 years &quot;probation&quot; sounds good and they could automatically be added to the lottery during these 5 years. They should be required all the things European immigrants are required to produce or pay for…
Right now, people, legal immigrants are discriminated against.

The genocide in Darfur started with the slaughtering of the mostly Christian black population by the Government of Sudan but since 2003, armed groups have also joined the conflicts against the government: the Sudanese Liberation Movement (rebels demanding a better distribution of vthe oil wealth SLM) and the Movement for Justice and Equality (Islamic group with a nationalist agenda MJE).
About 300,000 dead, 1.85 million displaced people, 230,000 in Chad that almost fell victim form a Sudanese backed coup d’etat…that makes the Darfur crisis is a serious humanitarian situation.
April 2004, a Chadian sponsored cease fire was negotiated and enforced by a cease fire African observation mission composed of 6500 men of the African Union paid and supported by the European Union.
Since Sept 2005, cease fire violation have increased and clashes betweeen rebels and the government, rebels and African observers, Janjaweed and rebels, Janjaweed refugee camps and even cities in Chad have escalated. The number of victims too.
On the UN side, a resolution to let humanitarian aid in was passed July 30 2004, and another one Sept 18.
The African Union commited 6500 personnel and protection troops, with a goal of 7700 soon while trying to bring the warring factions to the negotiation table, again and again.
Thanks to 79 NGOs (10 French) and the 13 UN agencies employing 11,500 people, 1.652.000 people were given access to water, 40 millions tons of food distributed to 2.1 million peopleand 4 vaccination campaign against vpolio conducted.

The rest of the world had been active and aware a long time ago, while America was focusing on American Idols or other junk food news. Darfur is to everybody like Somalia or Rwanda was to the US…A place you want to help but that nobody sane would touch with a ten foot pole. It is depicted as Muslim slaughtering Christians to appeal to the average Joe….this is an oversimplification and there is a big power struggle back there, involving religion, oil, power. Bin Laden recently came out to declare a new Jihad against the UN, Eururopean or US crusaders, that is to say peace enforcement and keeping forces. The warring factions recently &quot;obeyed&quot; by demanding more African troops and no westerners ever or it would be a &quot;Jihad&quot;. Iran said it would share its nuclear technology with Sudan. Sudan is trying to destabilize Chad.


It is a mess and America just wakes up to it.!

Where have you been people…the rest of the world have at least tried hard for the past 3 years now…WHAT DID YOU DO? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Let us take a break from our Southern borders and our shameless politicians for some
introspection, a deeper look to our insides! Literally!

Organ trafficking is a pretty lucrative international market and recently, a mortuary home around Los Angeles had been exposed for“parting out”bodies they were paid to respectfully bury or cremate and selling the removed organs to medical related facilities or individuals. Everything went from kidneys to skull, lungs to limbs.

If in America, legal and ethical barriers have been set, internationally, from China to South America and Africa, harvesting organs from dead and live patients can even be state sponsored. China harvests its incarcerated population (while in the US, inmates and lifers, get access to organ transplants and compete for them with the honest population!) and many countries have laws that actually make it legal for a live person to sell, or buy, organs. Not in my backyard, you are all screaming! Well, actually, in America, even if it is not really legal, we already had some instances of good“matches”being offered loads of cash for selling non-vital parts of their bodies!

If you look at the stem cell research, it is not too far off and we now allow the“harvesting”of aborted fetuses to feed our dream of immortality. Further away, in international waters, on ships or retired oil platforms, renegade surgeons or scientists (enlightened???), test human cloning and other medical things most of the world has rejected.

From our cozy and safe living room in suburbia, when reading about WW2, the camps and“the doctors of the devil”, we kind of wonder what happened and why. These people who profit from our fear to die and perform these unethical experiments are exactly the same breed as the Nazi doctors. Give them an once of legitimacy and you will see…and be very frightened.

eBay government lessonsRe &quot;Westly says he&apos;ll apply eBay lessons to government,&quot; commentary, May 30: Somebody should tell Steve Westly that our eBay state and its legislators have been for sale to the highest bidders for quite a while now. The so-called &quot;special interest groups&quot; and their bribes (I meant &quot;contributions&quot;! We all know that bribes are illegal!) have plagued our political landscape since deep pockets have been tailored into the business suits of our politicians. From Greek investors to public servant unions, from the Indian gaming lobby to the &quot;trans-crossed&quot; crowd, from businesses to nonprofits, everybody knows who to &quot;buy now,&quot; where to bid, how much and whether there is a minimum bid. The funny thing is that we only get to read the feedbacks when the smear campaigns start. Only then is the real character of our public -- self-serving -- servants unveiled and they all seem to be somewhat &quot;unethical.&quot; I wonder why we keep on paying for the free rides of all these &quot;compassionate&quot; millionaires? Is it by the people and for the people or by the people and for me? I don&apos;t know. I am French!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


You know our electoral system is broken when:

- Only rich corrupt people run

- Only paid activists get involved

- Campaign contributions are legal

- Bribes are illegal and contributions aren’t

- Only crooks run for office according to the opponent

- Voters keep rotten candidates

- Taxpayers are cows that politicians milk

- Happy cows come from California

- Whith cows, there is no deficit

- Deep pockets are tailored in politician’s suits

- Their depth varies with the office

- State worker invest millions for &quot;their&quot; candidates

- Only State workers get raises

- &quot;special interest groups&quot; don’t expect paybacks

- Did I say that?

- Working people work on Tuesdays

- Free loaders don’t and vote to improve their freebies

- Voting happens on Tuesday not to ruin the weekend

- Whatever was voted on is always challenged by the loser until it passes

- Elections are an investment, not a waste

- Elected official are assets, rarely a waste

- Lt Governors are a waste and should be insurance commissioner

- A civil servant serves us

- Did I say that?

- Did I tell you that campaign contributions are not bribes and that cows pay taxes?

- Special elections are not &quot;special&quot;

 

Maybe, and only maybe:

- Only productive people should vote on spending money

- 5 years should go by before any bill is challenged

- Every alleged misconduct should be investigated

- Over 50% abstention should get the elections cancelled

Will Iraq be the Algeria of the US military?

A summary of an article published in the May-June 2006 edition of Armor, the oldest US military publication ( www.Armor.com ) 

 &quot;Iraq has no jungle and many urbanized areas. What is happening in Baghdad is similar to the battle of Algiers. Despite using many innovative tactics in counterinsurgency and getting the upper hand over the FLN, the French ended up alienating the local population and losing the war politically. This is what America has to expect&quot;.

Colonel Andrew J. Bacevich, US Army, retired, Los Angeles Times

Asymmetric warfare 

           The French war in Algeria inspired the basis on a new &quot;anti-occident&quot; strategy largely rooted in Mao and Sun Tzu writings, and later labeled as &quot;asymmetric warfare.&quot;

The Algerian terrorists/insurgents of the National Liberation Front (FLN), in the name of its &quot;legitimate&quot; revolution, resorted to terror against the enemy and their own native population, bloody purges within its ranks, torture, executions, mutilation, kidnapping, terrorist tactics, bombings, extortion, disinformation, and sabotage, both in Algeria and France, against soldiers and civilians.

At the same time, the slightest morally reprehensive or illegal act from the French forces was fully exploited to the full extent by the Parisian FLN disinformation apparatus. Eventually, the media would end up echoing the alleged or documented atrocities committed by the army of the Republic, soon followed by the rest of the world and international organizations. Finally, that sort of moral blackmail ended up paralyzing the government and scaring politicians and military leaders into inaction for fear of scandal.

In his book, &quot;Asymmetric warfare or the defeat of the victor&quot; (2003), Jacque Baud states that the media is the major weapon of the terrorists. The Brazilian author and philosopher Olavo de Carvalho have also echoed this theory when he said that disinformation, as a weapon recently became the most pervasive action of the media.

What happened in Algeria was really similar to the current conflict in Iraq, both on the military battlefield and on the media battleground. Asymmetric warfare at its best is still applied today. In order to function, that warfare needs to achieve the &quot;brainwashing&quot; of the public so that &quot;it won&apos;t even detect the inborn immorality of the so-called moral requirements demanded from one of the parties while granting the other an indifferent and accomplice silence for its violation of the same requirements&quot; (Olavo de Carvalho).

Far from being an apologist for the Algerian war famed torture and local French civil and military rebellion, this topic tries to show how difficult it is for a legitimate democratic state, held to higher standards by its own rules of law and openness, to fight a ruthless enemy that does not respect any moral standards nor international rule in the name of the adage: everything goes for the revolution.

When Colonel Andrew J. Bacevich declared that &quot;Indiscipline, lawlessness and the excessive use of force will not guarantee victory in Iraq; indeed, the reverse is true&quot;, he basically and wrongly referred to the darkest aspects of the Algerian war to characterize it. On top of that, he even quoted an American soldier that told the Post, &quot;It&apos;s a little like the French colonel in &apos;The Battle of Algiers.&apos; You&apos;re all complaining about the tactics I am using to win the war, but that&apos;s what I am doing - winning the war&quot;.

In Algeria, indiscipline, lawlessness and the excessive use of force was the act of the few empowered by a succession of desperate government that first incited the violence, then conveniently ignored it before burying it. The majority of the 1.7 million of servicemen that fought and died for 8 years served admirably well and with honor the cause that the democratically elected government of France ordered them to defend: the preservation of what was perceived as its &quot;territorial integrity.&quot; Innovative and traditional military and psychological tactics were extensively used to counter the ferocious insurgents. Sure enough, the torture and summary executions performed by some in the French side are the only thing history remembers from this conflict. Asymmetric warfare at its best, selective memory for those that conveniently forgot the bloody tactics used by the FLN to get the power and later, to keep it.

The war in Algeria was a total war, the first asymmetric conflict that killed hundred of thousands of people, mostly among the civilian population that was the &quot;water for the fishes,&quot; the hearts and minds French troops and the FLN were fighting for. The conflict spilled into neighboring countries all the way to Egypt and as far North as France and Paris.

It was a dirty war by all standards, closer to a civil war than to a regular colonial war, with its absurdities, horror, treasons, cowardice, and extreme self-righteousness from both parties.

For history, always conveniently re-written by the winners, it is a colonial war won by the oppressed Algerian people, a conflict that almost destroyed the colonial French republic and that &quot;brought victory and dishonor&quot; to its Nazi-like armies (vision the educative movie &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; or &quot;Lost command&quot; with Anthony Quinn)).

For historians, it was a dirty conflict where one camp was held by the International community to higher standards than the ruthless and ferocious enemy it was fighting.

The chapter of these dark times is not even closed yet and the debate about confessing the institutionalized use of torture in Algeria rages in France, brought back to the fore by the former &quot;carriers of the FLN&quot;, the various French celebrities that sided against their own country during the conflict, carrying messages back and forth to the &quot;insurgents&quot;. Again, Algeria and its past FLN administration are not even requested to revisit the horror and the mass murders they were responsible for. Certainly, a joint recognition and apology would finally put an end to this drama that has hurt and still hurts French and Algerians generations. 

As far as the current war in Iraq goes, even in its consequences, it is not likely to become another Vietnam. Iraq is turning to be more like a US military Algeria, something that is going to deeply affect the Army, its leadership, its doctrine, its training, and the way it will be perceived, far beyond the lifetime of the current decision makers in Washington.

Here is a screenshot of another one published in Armor in July 2005:


Baghdad fell a long time ago in the learning curve of counterinsurgency, and it appears we still have not learned enough from our casualty count, nor have we from recent history, and we all know those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it.

Iraq: 2005

Roadside bombs (RSB) and rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) attacks in Iraq quickly became the main threat to drivers of lone patrols and support personnel traveling with daily supply convoys throughout the country, but mainly around or inside the capital. Initially, the casualty rate in stricken vehicles was 99 percent; however, the lethality of ambushes was officially lowered to 25 percent due to the use of armor kits for vehicles, air reconnaissance, portable jamming devices, computer mapping of favored locations, and sniper teams on search-and-destroy missions. At home, despite a meticulous casualty count kept by the media, the daily victims of RSB attacks are no longer even making front-page news. The war is far away and these tragedies have become routine events.

Iran, a nightmare?

Iran is slowly but surely accessing a military nuclear power status and is bragging about it in the name of an obsolete but universally recognized self determination right. Defying the Western calls for more openness of its nuclear plans and processing plants, and laughing at the Western (legitimate?) concerns caused by the radical speeches of its newly democratically elected president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (as“democracy”in a dictatorship of a radical religion), Iran is now filling the vacuum left by Saddam and making the news with threats and crazy speeches that defy diplomacy, reason and common sense. After denying the Holocaust, Ahmadinejad has pledged many time to destroy Israel, and recently announced its willingness to transfer its nuclear technology and knowledge to other Islamic countries. Sudan, mind you, has been given first choice during the visit of its president Omar el-Bechir in Teheran, the same Islamic Sudanese president that supports the genocidal Arab militias known as“Janjaweed”that are responsible for the well documented rapes, killings and other abuses that have left 1.2 million catholic and Muslim black Africans homeless in Darfur and in Chad. Actually, it is the same Islamic government that Osama Bin Laden just supported in a now rare occurrence of video speech by the rat-hole confined former leader of Al-Qaeda. Threatened by an imminent UN military intervention, el-Bechir just got the unexpected help from his former protégé, the Jihad-master Bin Laden that called for the stockpiling of landmines and the gathering of freedom fighters in the Arab land of Sudan to prepare for the violent and bloody repelling of the soon to be invading UN crusaders. Call me paranoid, but I kind of worry about the crazy hateful kid of the block being about to purchase a couple of big guns for himself and his other crazy buddies. Diplomacy is obviously failing with the little mad man of Teheran and the US, the European Union and the UN have failed to even reach a semblance of a reasonable agreement with the uranium-stoned high religious and political leaders of an Iran where the moderate are keeping a very very low profile (and I would not blame them…they could march against America in America and Teheran, but certainly not criticize Teheran in Teheran!). Call me paranoid, but I am kind of wondering about our future when I hear professional politicians stating officially that our standing firm on stupid principles such as non proliferation or non military use are just plain mean and reinforce the Iranian anger toward us. Call me paranoid, but the prospect of Iran blowing up Israel, or sharing its technology with such a backward and genocidal country like Sudan does not ring too safe to me. Call me selfish but letting them gain access to military grade uranium might not be fair in the“fuzzy woozy”scale of heart bleeding things but looks pretty reasonable to me.

So what is it going to be for you? Do you believe that tomorrow, the crazy guy and his bearded radical mentors are going to play nice with military nukes and that the mutual assured destruction that was the core of the cold war era nuclear deterrence (MAD) is going to work? Do you believe that somebody should go there militarily and take the nukes out, one way or another, at the risk of starting a second Iraq like war with its roadside bombs, insurgents, inter-ethnic and inter-Muslim bloodbaths? Do you pray for Israel to move its behind and go deal with the Iranian plants like they did with Saddam’s? After all, they already dedicated a spy satellite on the issue! Or do you just believe in peace, love, promiscuity, metrosexuality, medical marijuana, Ritalin, fairness, equal rights, American Idols, the power of prayers and forgiveness, equality, blah blah blah….the“see no evil”head in the sand ostrich thing?

Have a good life….and as I tell my kids, make good choices!

My four cars do not even total the amount of horse power found in a new Hemis, and I don&apos;t believe that blaming rising horse power for the increase of speed is correct. My 70hp 1988 Renault took me to L.A at an average &quot;traffic&quot; speed of 90mph. My 17hp 1964 Fiat maxes up at 60mph and I often catch myself far beyond suburban speed limits too. My 74 Porsche 914 accounts for less power (80hp) than any modern 4 door sedan, SUV or other pick-up truck...&quot;Size does not matter&quot; and speeding is all about the weight on the gas pedal. Accidents result from our fast and high pressure life style, speeding, reckless driving, crowded roads and attention disorder. Leave the horses alone but remove seat belts and air bags....people would be more careful if they were aware on how much they could lose when they drive. I need a pretty defensive driving to compensate for the lack of these mistake forgiving contraptions.

The well known Megan&apos;s Law had been named several years ago after Megan Kanka, a New Jersey seven-year-old girl was raped and killed. The culprit was a convicted child molester who had discreetly settled in the family&apos;s neighborhood.  The parents of the martyred child started a movement to have local communities warned when known sex offenders were relocating to their areas and eventually, Megan&apos;s law was born.

Anybody can now go to an official website and check by zip code or address if any of such a potential predator is your gentle neighbor. In California, the website is http://www.meganslaw.ca.gov  .

We are all happy, I am sure, to have such a tool and a quick search of my own town showed &quot;only&quot; 18 offenders, none &quot;high risk&quot; and none in my direct neighborhood, thank you.

So, let us take a look to the John Doe family now! Today, John is glued to the computer monitor, speechless because he has just discovered that a high risk sexual offender leaves next door, a living example that the legal and law enforcement institutions have given up their responsibility to protect his children (the risk rating goes all the way to Serious and High Risk!). What happened to the old principle that a convict is only released when he has paid its debt to society and is not a threat anymore? What does John do with the information? Do you think he is happy?

Legally, the only thing one can do with the information is to pass it around (asking the neighbors to check the website) and try peacefully to get the person to move out. For high risk offenders, the local government can also organize a campaign of information via flyers notifying you that your children might be at risk. Taking the matter in your own hands his of course totally excluded. Again, what is one supposed to do when the local government says that your children might be at risk to be hurt (or worse) by a known dangerous person (high risk) that is entitled to live next door?

Today we actually have a system that releases convicted sex offenders , child molesters or other perverts in our neighborhoods, some still categorized as &quot;high risk&quot;, while providing citizens with a free Internet tool to figure out if their families are in any danger, a tool one must check basically every day...and we are supposed to be happy?

I am not and my mood changed even more when I learned that a loophole in the law allows some of them to avoid being exposed through the public database and that the only way to get the full picture is to actually go to the local Police department, fill up a disclaimer, and be presented with the real and full database of the about 500.000 known sexual offenders nationwide.

I was &quot;happy&quot; with the 18 I found in my town....none in my street!  But I just discovered that 44 registered sexual offenders actually live and lurk around, and today, I will have to go to the Police to check my street!

How safe do you feel now, knowing that the public website is mostly worthless ?


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Don&apos;t you find it ironic that doctors have no problem whatsoever with euthanasia, terminating a live fetus, and performing partial abortion on a viable unborn baby (that is to say delivering the legs, arms and torso only, puncturing the back of the skull, suctioning its contents so as to collapse it, and completing the delivery) but do not want to medically support the execution of convicted and appeal-exhausted death row inmate. One has to remember that they made the“oath of hypocrite”and I am sure that they would attend the last moment of a condemned person if they could charge them normal fees, perform massive surgery on them before dumping them to hospice care when the insurances don&apos;t pay anymore. Personally, I don&apos;t really care if the needle is sterilized before the injection and if a doctor is present or not. Let ask a member of the victim&apos;s family to push the button or perform the injection. That would solve all the problems!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How do you call paying &quot;coyotes&quot; to smuggle humans in containers and drop them in the middle of a desert? How do you call piling workers in trailers, and paying low wages for a back-breaking job? It is SLAVERY…and studied under a pure economist point of view, one can see why SLAVERY makes sense…killing the elder and the handicapped also makes pure economic sense…but it took the Western world centuries to add compassion and quality of life to the economic or natural equation. America built a“dream”for its people, born or LEGAL immigrants, a dream based on decency, the right to work, minimum“living”wages, health care…I won’t pick up your darn strawberries or clean your dirty sheets for $5 to $6 an hour with the ER as my care provider, an overcrowded trailer as my quarters and a portable potty for 20… if this is YOUR American dream, the“land of the substandard opportunities”, you are more than welcomed to try it!.
Sure greedy businesses, lobbyist and their political puppets would tell you that outsourcing work to third world countries and importing cheap foreign slave labor is necessary for America&apos;s modern economy, but it only make sense for them by saving them from paying for wasteful sick days, unnecessary worker comps, retirement for useless seniors…I had a dream that America will one day be a nation where I will not be judged by my origins, my religion, my sexual preferences, the color of my skin but by the content of my character, my commitment to the laws, and my hard work. 
People like me want to promote American LEGAL and decent working conditions. What are the pro-illegal groups promoting but the substandard American dream that finance the wealth of some corrupted industries ?

21 Major US airports have failed a security test and let bomb material through. Of course, Homeland Security officials are surprised and TSA claims some kind of unfinished training while stating that security is the prime objective of the company. Should you be worried, so long and so much money after 9-11?The fact of the matter is that the bomb material that was sneaked in had nothing to do with what the available screening technologies look for, that is to say traditional traces of traditional explosive. With a good insider knowledge of what goes on in the airport as far as screening goes, the teams in charge of testing the security smuggled common household products that only become explosive when combined together. So, TSA failed, by lack of equipment, and security was breached, allowing through material capable of taking an airplane down in each of the 21 tested airport. Did the Feds cheat?Since 9-11, all the security measures and equipment that had been deployed across the nation&apos;s airports and in the planes have been tested over and over, and most of the time failed the tests. If passive measures like the armored doors in the cockpit, made sense, expensive devices like the explosive seeking scanners can be fooled by people who understand the technology and are smart enough to make home-made explosives or weapons. Air Marshals make sense! Profiling makes sense! Preventing carry on luggage makes sense to avoid a post screening mixture of chemicals, one or many terrorists could have smuggled in separately! Confining pilots in their locked and armored cockpit for the duration of the flight makes sense (toilets should be included in the front and food provided)! Banning non long-term citizen in cleaning and security jobs makes sense (with a least ten years of possible background investigation)! As far as high-tech gadgets go, like your average computer, they are as secure as the day they were designed according to outdated and &quot;reactive&quot; specific requirements, meaning that the day they are deployed, they are not only already obsolete but also &quot;open sources&quot;, that is to say readily available to study inside out for people to find ways to &quot;beat&quot; them. Anyone who has been trained in the fun and highly imaginative art of &quot;booby trapping&quot;, already knows how to make sneaky mean stuff such as an undetectable pressure trigger with a simple bowl and some plastic wrap, or turn a simple thing such as a car&apos;s sun visor into a lethal nail-stuffed explosive device. And you thought that you were really safe!


In the meantime, our borders have also been tested and radioactive material made it in the US like a letter through the mail.

 http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/03/27/D8GK83AG6.html 

And wait! It gets better! To make things worse, you have to know that the tests were only ran at the few border crossing points that have gotten their share of radioactivity detectors (most of them don’t have any), and that the material was“legalized”with fake licenses printed on a home computer. The detectors worked well but human failure and I am sure some political correctness was to blame…

On top of that, just add the pro-illegal immigration wave that is sweeping American streets, coordinated in our back by Hispanic media, and yes, we can all say it loud and together: WELCOME TO AMERICA!!

State Treasurer Phil Angelides showed us the real ugly face of our state. Taking advantage of his position, he designed a plan to generate a buck or two for CalPERS and CalSTRS. At recent board meetings of the giant state agencies, he begged them to invest billions in toll roads and other revenue generating infrastructure programs. He was reported to claim that &quot;where there is an income stream, WE should get it, not private companies&quot;(-as &quot;we&quot; the state employees, unions and agencies, as opposed to WE the people of California?-)and was also also quoted saying &quot;who do you want to see reap the benefits of revenue-generating projects?&quot;. State workers pensions are in jeopardy because state workers got more than the State (ie tax payers) can pay. So everything goes to find ways to finance the huge gap. After all, we wouldn&apos;t want state workers to work a little longer or be stuck with a little less money when they retire (word banned from the private sector vocabulary). I have an answer for you, Mr Angelides, what about WE the taxpayers should benefit from State projects, not you nor your croonies at the Capitol! Happy cows come from California. Good milk come from happy cows. Ours is getting sour so STOP MILKING US!

Like Northwest pilots, Delta employees should look at what happened to United when deciding to fight to the the end or give up to the demands in order &quot;to save the company&quot;.  While the unions stayed put and the execs piled up huge secured benefits, United skillfully lead the employees into giving up wages and benefits, and locked them in a ten year &quot;no raise&quot; deal below a pre-2000 pay level, while canceling pensions with the blessing of the bankruptcy courts. At that time, striking would have meant the end of a giant but would have actually benefited the US Airline industry as a whole. Furthermore, assets and bases would have been sold to honor the pensions, and senior employees would have retired, while younger one would have gotten decent new jobs in a re-energized industry and some guaranteed money toward their retirement. It did not happen and the United workplace is now plagued with a new Wal-Mart feel that includes desperate &quot;extreme&quot; seniors holding on to their &quot;greeting&quot; jobs, low paid sour cheated employees, poor in-flight services and angry low fare passengers still expecting a long vanished glamour on their Southwest like &quot;six leg trip, peanuts and jokes only&quot; discounted tickets. Is it time to outsource the Airlines and man them with Chinese or Indian personnel?

  Muslims and peace.  

(nota: this paper quickly brushes an (incomplete) overview of the Muslim world complexity and only intends to trigger the need for more research in the reader’s part)


 Holy Qur-an 

Surate V 92“Never should a believer kill a believer (…)”

Surate V 93“I   f a man kills a believer intentionally, is recompense is Hell (…)”
 

We have read and heard many time that“Islam”is a religion of peace that has been“hijacked”by bloody terrorists seeking to bring fundamentalism in the Arab world.
These nihilists simplify the“Western world”as an American-led bunch of Christian countries made of crusaders united to annihilate the Muslim faith and fulfill the“Zionist”agenda. In return, we often have a tendency to wrongly simplify Islam as a single religion practiced by the Arab world as a whole. 
We do know that Christians are far from believing in the same things and practicing the same way, Christianity only being the common denominator, the name for a family of closely related beliefs. We are also aware that the Christian branches have sorted out their difference in blood and violence some four centuries ago and that Christians are actually pretty peaceful today. We also know better than to claim that the Western world is united when dealing with the Arab world.
On the other hand, and because of its huge Sunni majority (940 million out of 1 billion Muslims), Islam is often (and wrongly) considered as more united than Christianity and Judaism. But that religion also comes in many denominations, sects, and subdivisions, and more often than none, these groups have a hard time recognizing other groups as fellow Muslims, and it is not unusual to see them fighting each other.
To top it up, the Arab world is not only limited to the Middle East and ranges from former Russian republics to China, via Turkey, Africa, and Asia. Actually, the top ten Muslim countries of the world only include a couple of countries making what is commonly perceived as the Arab world (Turkey- 63,000.000- Iran–61,000.000- Egypt–54,000.000- Pakistan -136,000,000-).
The main Muslim population is mostly spread out in Asia (Indonesia -171,000,000- Bangladesh -106,000,000- India -103,000,000- China -38,000,000), with one big contender in Africa (Nigeria -47,720,000-). 




 The subdivisions of Islam:  

 ·        There are three major groups and many different smaller sects following their own versions of Islam 

Sunni Islam: They have chosen to follow Abu Bakr, as the successor of Muhammad. They form the majority in Algeria), Kuwait Afghanistan and outnumber Shiites in Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Somalia, Uzbekistan, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Libya and Jordan. Historically, Sunnis are pretty traditional believers and oppose Shiite, the US Nation of Islam, Ahmadiyya, and Ismailis.

Shi&apos;a Islam (Shiites): They have chosen to follow Ali, his closest relative, as the successor of Muhammad They form the majority in Iraq, Iran and Bahrain and total about 120,000.000. Shiites mainly oppose Sunnis and Ahmadyya.

Ahmadyya Islam: This clearly dissident branch of Islam was created by Mirza Ahmad in India in the nineteenth century, and includes about 170,000.000 followers (most of them in Pakistan). It preaches a peaceful“jihad”and had seceded in two different groups in the early 1900.

 ·        Two sects that have a lot of influence in the Muslim world challenge these numerous groups: 

The Wahhabis: Fundamentalists, they believe that everything that was added to the original religion after the third century is heresy. They only strive in Saudi Arabia that is well known for using its“petrodollars”to finance Coranic schools and spread Islam in third world countries plagued by misery, or in other parts of the world hit by religious based conflicts.

The Sufis: They follow another traditional form of mystic Islam clearly conflictual with mainstream Islam.

 ·        The other numerous sects split from the main currents of Islam throughout time and over disagreements on the choice of an Imam or the choice of what the right Islamic path should be. 

The, Zaidis (Imam issue), the Kahrijites (seeking another path), the Ismailis (ex Shiites), Fatimids (ex Ismailis, ruled Egypt for 200 years), the Alawis (ex Ismailis that strayed and are not considered as Islamic anymore), the Nizaris (formerly known as“Assassins”from the Arabic“ashshashsin”, a combination of words meaning“Hashish”and“to slaughter”. The original Crusaders fought that fierce sect known to be KUI (killing under the influence)), the Bahais (not regarded as Islamic anymore), and the Druzes (split from mainstream when believing that God can appear in a prophet or Imam. Druzes factions fought hard in Lebanon).




 The inter Arab and inter Muslim wars: 

The Arab world we know has been geographically drawn by the colonial powers of the twentieth century and has been plagued since with wars and rivalries. The presence of the state of Israel has been one of the leading causes of the Middle-Eastern wars and switches of allegiances. So were the two Iraqi invasions.

Politically, Arab regimes can be divided in two specific and competing sorts. On the one hand,“Pan Arab”government believe that they have been brought up by a“revolution”when on the other, oil producing countries believe that they are in power because of the richness of their soil. The latter is of course afraid to be forced to share its wealth with the former.

In the past decades, Arab countries have fought other Arab countries for many reasons including territorial disputes, expansion or wealth but not directly religion. Furthermore, many political tensions did not end up in wars but have also stressed the great divide between these Arab countries desperately seeking a European like union. The following confusing list of armed wars and political tensions of the past three decades best describes the complexity of their interactions.

During the Iran-Iraq conflict, Syria sided with Iran, and Egypt with Iraq. Algeria and Morocco are still at odds over the Western Sahara where the Algerian sponsored POLISARIO still fight Morocco’s ruling. Syria took over Lebanon, tried to invade Jordan (Israeli fighter jets saved Jordan form the Syrian armored onslaught), stood against Iraq and Egypt. Iraq and Saudi Arabia had tensions over borders and some war debts. Iraq and Turkey over the Kurds and water rights. Libya invaded Chad (oil). Libya and Syria are still trying to normalize their relationship with Egypt, banned for having supported Israel after the 1967 debacle. Jordan angered Egypt after siding with Iraq over the Arab council’s cooperation funds. Later, Iraq invaded Kuwait (oil), and Muslim countries sided with the UN force led by the US to liberate Kuwait (Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan, Turkey, United Emirates, Syria, Egypt, Bangladesh). Muslim countries also approved the second US led war in Iraq (Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kuwait, Uzbekistan).


 

 Muslims and“invaders”: how fundamentalist“foreign fighters”take over liberation struggles
 
When Muslim countries are not too busy fighting each other, they stand up for their freedom against foreign invasions by“crusaders”of another faith. One cannot help noticing that in the past decades, these struggles have been mostly hijacked by a nucleus of international fundamentalists dedicated to getting rid of the“invader”, taking over the country, and imposing their radical views of Islam. The“foreign fighters”movement started in Kashmir, a hot spot between Pakistan and India where international Muslim fighters, supported by Pakistan, were fighting Indian troops (and still do it to a lesser extent), taking and executing hostages and blowing bombs. When Russia invaded Afghanistan, the trend greatly amplified and recruits from all over the Muslim world converged to fight the Russian in a holy Jihad. Instead of lining up at the unemployment line after the Russian defeat, these fighters spread out to more hot spots of the world, from Chechnya to Kosovo, Palestine, or Iraq for two consecutive wars.

The following listing illustrate the trend and shows that all the popular (and legitimate?) uprising against a foreign power of another faith had led to a take over of the struggle by radical Islam with a radical agenda.

Radical foreign fighters are fighting India over the independence of Kashmir. The Palestinian struggle against Israel has been hijacked by radical factions resorting to terrorism and backed up by powers such as Iran. For years, in and from Lebanon, radical Muslim terrorist groups have waged a war against Israel and against other Lebanese factions. In Chechnya, foreign fighters infiltrated the Chechen resistance and are now leading the struggle against Russian troops. The same was also tried in Kosovo. In Afghanistan, and twice in Iraq, foreign fighters joined the regular army to fight the US led invasions. In post Gulf War 2 Iraq, radical international fighters are using terror against occupation forces and other Muslim to fulfill their agenda.




 Islam and“wars of religion”: 

When fundamentalism takes over, Islam has a hard time cohabitating with another of its branches or another religion. Religious peace and tolerance that had been the norm for decades had been recently broken all over the world, everywhere where new self proclaimed righteous fighters try to impose by force their retrograde view.

In Africa, Muslim warriors, following a long tradition of hunting for slaves in“black Africa”took over or are actively seeking dominance in civil war torn or peaceful countries. Furthermore, a more global and insidious agenda is fulfilled by the Kingdom of Saud that spreads out Coranic schools in poor and remote provinces where young children are enrolled by force by their parents who want to grant them free food and“education”. Commonly,“studies”last about four years, in chains, the time it takes to learn the Holy Qur-an by heart.

Sudan had only been peaceful eleven years since its accession to independence in 1955. The perpetual civil war started as a religious war between the Muslim populated North and the Christian South. In the Darfur province of Sudan, and now in Eastern Chad, the Janjaweed Muslim militias backed up by the Islamic government of Khartoum, keep on carrying out well documented genocide-like military strikes on the Christian black African population, resorting to looting raping, mass killing to chase them away. Sudan is also known to harbor known terrorist groups.

In Ivory Coast, that used to be the“jewel of Africa”and the example of a post-colonial success, the fabric of the population had been eroded by the influx of refugees from neighboring countries, refugees seeking a piece of the success. The more than 60 ethnic groups that make the country lived in harmony until they became the“minority”in their own land, and recession hit. Interestingly enough, the North of the country that is currently held by three foreign backed dissident groups is also made of a majority of Muslim.

In Nigeria, since the 1993 dictatorship of General Abacha, dictatorship that led to corruption, drugs trafficking and ethnic and religious tensions and clashes in the 36 states that form the country, the Muslim of the North have been diligently oppressing their Christian-animist minorities. In 1999, defying the constitution, eleven Northern Muslim states have implemented strict Islamic laws, forced to Islam or persecuted other religious groups, burned and destroy other temples or churches, already accounting for tens of thousands of death and more in displaced populations.

In Somalia, another heaven for terrorist groups, the civil war still rages but if initially it was mostly an ethnic based ancient conflict pitting together nomads against sedentary people, Northern tribes against Southern groups, rural communities against urban populations, the new trend is religious and Muslim armed groups are fighting to get rid of the moderate Mulsim that promote some separation between religion and state.

In Algeria, after having cancelled elections obviously won by the Salvation Islamic Front that had capitalized in the discontent created by the recession of the 1990, the military dictatorship have basically abandoned whole remote regions of Algeria to the Salvation Islamic Army. Furthermore, another group of fundamentalist, the Armed Islamic Group , tried to force Islam on rural Algerians that were slaughtered or raped after their villages were looted. In urban area, and neighboring countries, intellectuals, journalists and officials were also executed by the Armed Islamic Group that found its fame in the many nail bombings that it conducted in Paris between 1993 and 1996. This civil war that still rages today in the name of the war on terror has already cost thousands of lives. 

Israel is still the standing symbol of a religious war between radical Islam and Zionism.

Turkey is still struggling between a modern and moderate Islam. As recently as 2002, the country has officially protected other religions and minorities and even allows Christian and Jew organizations to own real estate, that is to say churches and synagogues. Still, fundamental Islam lurks in the background and tries to take over.

As far Iraq is concerned, no comment: Muslims are still killing more Muslims than the coalition force and there is no way anybody would be crazy enough to try to build a church or a Synagogue in today’s Iraq.

In India, foreign Muslim fighters, and also terrorists, are waging a secession war in Kashmir. When in 1947, the Muslim state of Pakistan was created; millions of Hindu Indians moved South while Muslim went north to the new country. That was the direct cause for about 500.000 deaths. At the same time, about to be overtaken by Pakistan, the Indian ruler of Kashmir decided to join the South despite its Muslim majority. Since than, Muslim fighters and/or the Pakistanis army have tried many time to“liberate”the province from“infidel”hands.

In Afghanistan, after the departure of their common Russian enemy, the“freedom fighters”split in many warring factions and started a civil war that led to the Victory of the Pakistan backed Talibans, opposed by a coalition of moderate Muslims, the Northern coalition led by Commander Massoud. After 9-11, and despite the murdering of Massoud commandeered by the Talibans and Al Qaeda, the US backed the North and successfully routed the Talibans. Moderate Islam is still struggling today in Afghanistan, especially since the return of the Talibans. Pakistan does not really appreciate the“birth”of a sovereign and moderate power at its borders, and would rather have it out of sight of the international community in the hands of aTaliban-like regime.

In China, the Muslim western province of Xinjiang, North of Tibet, is one of the two only Chinese province where the majority is not held by the Han ethnic group but by Kazakhs, Uzbecks or Mongols, united with a common language and religion. Islam is predominant there and since 1990, Xinjiang Islamists have resorted to violence to voice their aspirations. Like in Tibet, China used the excuse of the post 9-11 global war on terror to increase its repression.

The Philippines suffers from a communist, a military and a Muslim rebellion. The latter resorts to terrorism and is today the most serious threat to the fragile democracy, with the group Abu Sayaf bragging to its linkage with Bin Laden. Hostage taking is a common tool used by the group that ridiculed the army in 2001 when it captured 200 hostages in a hospital. Since than, the US has been really active along local military forces to hunt down the terrorists.

Indonesia is the biggest Muslim country of the world that had been artificially united by its military ruler for the past 30 years. It is composed of 13,000 Islands occupied by three religious groups, Muslims, Hindus and Christians. Since 1998, the religious war between Muslims and Christians in the Moluccas island of the north East of the archipelago had cost more than 5000 dead and half a million of displaced people. 

In Timor, a hilly island whose Dutch part was attached to Indonesia in 1949 (West Timor) while its Portuguese part (Timor East) proclaimed independence in 1975, the population was 90% Catholic. The independent part was invaded by Indonesia in 1975. Islam has been imposed since 1949 on the West part and as of 1975 on the Eastern side. The“Islamization”was conducted by“inserting”250,000 Indonesian in the Island and by setting concentration camps were about 300,000 Catholics were still reported to be held in 1999. Thanks to international and UN pressure, Timor East chooses independence again later on. Since than, Muslim militias, backed by the Indonesian army, have already claimed thousands of deaths and the forced internment in West Timor of 250,000 displaced people.UN forces are still present there to monitor the situation and put an end the civil war.

In former Yugoslavia, Muslim ethnic minorities were the victim of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and UN forces were unable to stop it. As of today, the ethnic and religious cohabitation of what used to be the people of Yugoslavia under Marshal Tito is only guaranteed by a strong and permanent international military presence.




 Conclusion:
 
Islam, Muslims, the Arab world, moderation, terrorism and fundamentalism…

This paper did not try to bash on the Muslim faith but to describe what has been happening lately across the world, where Islam, has been involved. The author did not even tried to approach the various Islamic laws as applied differently in different countries, laws that would let a Westerner shocked and speechless.
Modern Muslims are struggling today with the return of the more fundamental approach of their religion that has been spreading since the 1979 Iranian revolution. Furthermore, the major Muslim sects and groups have also been fighting each other for the total dominance of the Islamic faith.

It is up to the vast majority (?) of moderate Muslims to stand up and protect their“religion of peace that has been high jacked by the terrorists!”

&quot;The dam was stopped in 1975 because of earthquake concerns&quot; - the Sacramento Bee, Sunday March 11,2006, &quot;Auburn Dam wins a key ally&quot; 


This is a nice euphemism to describe what has actually happened two decades ago in the Auburn area, but what to expect from &quot;ritalined&quot; America that has been plagued with attention disorder for longer than that. In 1975, the US Bureau of reclamations had an ambitious design it started to work on: a 700 foot-high concrete arch dam one mile southeast of Auburn, just downstream the confluence of the North and Middle forks of the American river.In 1975, land was appropriated for the lake and valuable prime land that would eventually end up on the shores of the future recreational lake was bought and sold for big money. In 1975, while work on the foundations of the dam was well underway, a 5.7 magnitude earthquake hit the Oroville area and proved that the numerous fault in the Sierra foothills, Auburn area included, should be considered as active. One that ran at the Auburn dam site did its job and the foundations collapsed, releasing enough water to take out a couple of bridges downstream. The dam would have been up when the earthquake hit, Sacramento would have been flooded in less than an hour.We need water storage, hydro-electricity and flood control but building a dam in Auburn would just be increasing the flooding risks for the Sacramento area and that is why the project has been stopped in 1975 and every single time agenda driven politicians brought it back on the table. Wouldn&apos;t it be nice to have a new lake and develop prime real estate along its shores, like Granite Bay and El-Dorado hills? Would we follow money....or common sense.Please, all of you, back in D.C., go back to the 1975 events and investigation reports before pushing for such an irresponsible agenda....unless you want your name to be attached to the next disaster that would make Katrina look like a storm in a swimming pool!

It was recently reported that ten Californian landscaping companies joined others in Washington to lobby Congress and promote &quot;guest programs&quot; for immigrants. One of them, allegedly from Mission Viejo (Diversified Landscape Management), was even quoted saying that there is a labor shortage and that even with wages running up to $35 an hour for public contract work, they cannot attract a lot of U.S. citizens (Sacramento Bee). What a joke! I looked up the company and tried to get a phone number, ready for the opportunity to finally get a high paying job that would allow my wife to stay home. My researches came out vain and I am still stuck with the declining salaries of the I.T world that require higher education and experience for a lot less than the above $35/h. Gee, I wish I were a poorly educated illegal immigrant to get these high paying jobs &quot;modern time slave owners&quot; offer, and US citizen &quot;reject&quot;.

1300 Muslims, all ages and sexes, killed, bombed, tortured&amp;executed, and shredded to pieces by other Muslims in Iraq since the Golden Domed Mosque, the holiest 1200 years old Shiite shrine, blew up 20 days ago. It reminds me of the Talibans blowing up the statues of Buddha.
This is a good example of the so called Arab brotherhood! I guess one has to assume that half of the Muslim population are just Americans and Jews in disguise…because no Muslim would kill or harm another Muslim“brother”…Isn&apos;t it written in the Holy Quran that one cannot kill another &quot;believer&quot;? I will have to go and check the many Holy Quran I got to see where these fractricide murders are allowed….unless one of our reader wants to enlighten us? Any volunteer to shed a light on this &quot;inter-Muslim&quot;? Or is the explanation the fact that they are many competing currents of Islam,that they hate each others guts while claiming to be the only legitimate one? Right now, it looks like they hate each other more than the Allied forces! Interesting. They know the allies will eventually go…they need to get ready for the take over when this happens…they have time…about 600 years…their Islamic calendar set up buy the prophet (Sura IX, verse 36-37) put them in 1427…right guys?


Furthermore, as far as I can see, and count, not only Sunnis and Chiites are slaughtering each other, killing Imans, bombing temples, car-bombing Muslim funerals or weddings, but Muslim“brothers”from other countries are supporting one camp or another. America would really want to anihilate Arabs, it would withdraw the troops now and let Sunni countries fight Chiite countries in the Muslim battlegroung of Iraq. Muslims are still killing more Muslim in Iraq than Allied troops do! Good job guys! Furthermore, I remember whe the PLO tried to take over Jordan, when Syria invaded Jordan only to withdraw when Israeli fighters flew over their tanks, when Iraq and Iran (Sunnis and Chiites) went at it big time, even using kids to blow up against tanks and minefields and also chemical weapons, when Turkey and the Kurds, or Iraq and the kurds were slaughtering each other. I remember when Muslim brothers and Syria, under the pretext of fighting Israel or Christian militias, blew each other up when trying to conquer Lebanon…I remember Saddam and Kuwait, Libya and Chad, Morocco vs Algeria and the Polisario, the Islamic Salvation front and Algeria, the war in Yemen, Sudan vs Darfur and Chad, Somali militias….so please, no lecture, no lesson about the Arab being btrothers united under Islam against whoever! Islam is made of many different denominations and/or sects, some trying to adapt traditions to modern ages and other, violent, trying to bring the good old fundamentalism back. One need to understand that to grasp the reasons behind Islamic violences all over the world.


Finally, FYI, I downloaded 4 versions of the Coran: a French, an English, a Spanish and a German, all randomely selected on peer2peer and some bilingual in Arab too. On the 4 pdf files, I searched for the word“tolerance”and“tolerant”, in each language…zero, nil, nada, niente, rien, nothing, nicht!!! Try it…prove me wrong…I really hoped to find the world somewhere. No wonder they can clame“Your rivers will run blood one day“. They are“it”and must kill us or convert us! End of story (That part I found!). They have tried before, twice, and lost….the second time they did not recover and their calendar is still stuck there…no wonder if after math and calculus the only thing they have going -but had not invented- is oil.


If our perception of Islam as a violent religion is wrong ( perception reinforced by the mediatization of rabid and angry crowds, bloody and broadcasted execution of hostages...) aybe it is time for the moderate Arabs to stand up and correct it by their actions.

Open letter to - enter company name - (HP or United, Northwest, Delta, Ford, GM...): I don&apos;t have the resume it takes to even be considered for the CEO position of your company but tell you what: I can do better than - enter CEO name - (Fiorina, Tilton, Ford jr...) in less time for a lot less money! As an example, Fiorina was &quot;dumped&quot; by HP (as the Bee elegantly and rightfully put it) after 6 years of mismanagement that took low cost HP-Compaq computers of poor quality to the shelves of Costco and other Sam&apos;s club, threatened HP&apos;s printers core business, and led to a massive lay-off ... and the got $42 millions for that. I could BK any company in one month for a couple of hundred thousands. What do you say?Jokes aside, I just wonder what these overpaid CEOs do to deserve the secured &quot;compensation packages&quot; they get! Do they walk on water, lay golden eggs, heal whoever the touch? Why is it that up there, wether you are good or bad, you always come ahead when rank and files that make your wealth just get the boot and the unemployment line?

  What happened to Jill Caroll?; American&apos;s attention span too short 
While listening to a foreign radio station on Feb. 25, I realized the deadline for U.S. journalist Jill Carroll had passed - without any kind of media attention in America.
She could have died a horrible videotaped death last Sunday, while everybody was going on with his or her petty business.
She is American and Ritalined America replaced her with &quot;American Idol.&quot;
She is a journalist and her peers have abandoned her.
She is a woman and American women don&apos;t care.
She is Catholic, and no sermon or prayer can be heard.
She might have already died, in a deafening silence.
America, the big kid with acute attention disorder had already moved to the next shiny thing! That alone tells a lot about what we really are!

I am so tired of our media propagating the idea that legal and illegal immigrants come over here to do the &quot;dirty&quot; work Americans do not want to do. Immigrants from Mexico come here to do the low paid jobs the agricultural, construction and janitorial industry herd them to do. For them, it is a way of bettering their lives and the pathetic wages they get allow them to live and save money to send home. No American would take those jobs because here, legal workers are entitled to some kind of living wages and minimum of benefits these exploited people are denied. If the companies who profit from these modern time &quot;slaves&quot; could make it possible, the jobs &quot;Americans don&apos;t want&quot; would have already been outsourced to slave labor in China or India, to workers paid 25cts an hour, and a huge wall lined with minefield would be closing our Southern border. Would you rather break your back in the sun for $7 and hour or do it in a mine for $20. That is why you have more American miners than grape pickers!

IMAX Sacramento:


So, here it is! George and Angelo K. Tsakopoulos gained subsidy from the City Council that is going to pad their deep pockets and protect their business until 2010. In 2004, the brothers purchased a building that had already been subsidized by the city. They knew that its major tenant, IMAX, was an ailing and failing business but foresaw that the city would do anything on taxpayer&apos;s money &quot;to keep the lights on&quot; in lame and unattractive downtown Sacramento. These guys are all over the region and they are good! Tell you what, they deserve their tacky &quot;Parthenon&quot; tower and
the renaming of the city to Sakramenthos!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Taxes, taxes and taxes: Why am I not surprised that the city of Folsom has already earmarked the unexpected millions in extra tax revenues for some future project?
Like they were really considering giving us a tax return!
Furthermore, the WI-FI coverage of the city, in a partnership with Intel, sounds good to me as long as it is not done with taxpayers&apos; money.
I wonder why people think that surfing is a right? I am already paying for my own access, thank you, and I am not planning on paying new taxes for our registered child molesters or other freeloaders to surf for free.
What about more services for our seniors, or cheap neighborhood shuttle buses to ease traffic?

Why did the chicken cross the road ?


George Bush&apos;s Answer:
We don&apos;t really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to
know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is
either with us or it is against us. There is no middle ground here.

John Kerry&apos;s Answer:
While serving in Vietnam, I was in favor of the chicken crossing the
road. Then later I realized that there were those who needed the
chicken on this side of the road. Now I would like to see the chicken on the
other side of the road, unless of course it would be better served to
be on this side of the road. Ideally, I think the chicken should be in the
middle of the road.

Bill Gates&apos; Answer:
I have just released eChicken 2004, which will not only cross roads,
but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your
checkbook and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.

Dr. Seuss&apos; Answer:
Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad?
Yes, the chicken crossed the road, But why it crossed, I&apos;ve not been told!

Ernest Hemingway&apos;s Answer:
To die. In the rain. Alone.

Martin Luther King Jr.&apos;s Answer:
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads
without having their motives called into question.

Grandpa&apos;s Answer:
In my day, we didn&apos;t ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told
us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.

Barbara Walters&apos; Answer:
Isn&apos;t that interesting? In a few moments we will be listening to the
chicken tell, for the first time, the heart-warming story of how it
experienced a serious case of molting and went on to accomplish its
life-long dream of crossing the road.

Ralph Nader&apos;s Answer:
The chicken&apos;s habitat on the original side of the road had been
polluted by unchecked industrialist greed. The chicken did not reach the
unspoiled habitat on other side of the road because it was crushed by
the wheels of a gas-guzzling SUV.

Jerry Seinfield&apos;s Answer:
Why doesn&apos;t anyone ever think to ask, &quot;What the heck was this chicken
doing walking around all over the place anyway?&quot;

Pat Buchanan&apos;s Answer:
To steal a job from a decent, hard-working American.

Jerry Falwell&apos;s Answer:
Because the chicken was gay! Isn&apos;t it obvious? Can&apos;t you people see the
plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to the &quot;other
side.&quot;That&apos;s what they call it -- the other side. Yes, my friends, that
chicken is gay. And, if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too.
I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the
liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like &quot;the
other side.&quot;

Aristotle&apos;s Answer:
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

Captain Kirk&apos;s Answer:
To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

Bill Clinton&apos;s Answer:
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What do you mean by
chicken? Could you define chicken, please?

Albert Einstein&apos;s Answer:
Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the
chicken?

Sigmund Freud&apos;s Answer:
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the
road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

L.A.P.D.&apos;s Answer:
Give me ten minutes with the chicken and I&apos;ll find out.

Louis Farrakhan&apos;s Answer:
The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed
the &quot;black man&quot; in order to trample him and keep him down.

O.J. Simpson&apos;s Answer:
It didn&apos;t. I was playing golf with it at the time.

Northwest pilots should look at what happened to United when deciding to fight to the the end or give up to the judges. United Airlines got away with rejecting contracts and canceling pensions with the blessing of the bankruptcy courts. Actually, while the unions stayed put and the execs piled up huge secured benefits, United skillfully lead the employees into giving up wages and benefits, and locked them in a ten year &quot;no raise&quot; deal below a pre 2000 pay level. At that time, striking would have meant the end of a giant and would have benefited the US Airline industry. Furthermore, pensions would have been honored, senior employees would have retired while younger one would have gotten decent new jobs in a re-energized industry. It did not happen and the United workplace is now plagued with desperate &quot;extreme&quot; seniors holding on to their jobs, low paid sour cheated employees, poor in-flight services and angry low fare passengers expecting a long vanished flying glamour on their discounted tickets.

Californian sex crimes soap opera: Two weeks ago, the Republican assemblymen were attacking assemblyman Leno, Democrat and homosexual, for his &quot;soft&quot; bill on sexual predators. The Democrats distorted the Republican &quot;tough on crime&quot; stand and called it an homophobic attack on gays, Mister Nunez quoted saying the Republican argument against leniency was &quot;bullshit&quot;. The Sacramento Bee ran a week long piece on how good the worst of our sexual predators have it under the Californian sun, how often they get out ....and come back, triggering a legitimate popular concern. Thank you, the Bee! Suddenly, the Democrats are changing their position on sexual crimes and are now presenting themselves as the tough guys of the block. You know what, Mister Nunez? THAT IS BULLSHIT!

Once a year, throughout Europe, we have a decade old event dubbed the &quot;Jam Echelon day.&quot; The goal is for participants to jam, bring to a halt, the Anglo-Saxon communication intelligence system (COMINT) known abroad as &quot;ECHELON&quot;. This is achieved by flooding &quot;ECHELON&quot; with all the keywords that trigger its powerful computers, words that are well known and can be generated by special software designed for the occasion. On that special day, emails, faxes, phone calls are filled with mentions to terror, AK47, bombs, Al Qaeda, imminent attack, Jihad, spying, and all the goodies that can make a paranoid Intelligence Analyst die of a heart attack. If you haven&apos;t heard of it yet in America, it is just because officially, &quot;ECHELON&quot; does not exist and even the European envoys that came to confront the US government with their findings (including proof of the use of the system for political and economic spying, screen shots of Echelon computers, pictures of installations, declassified US papers talking about it....) were just denied access to anybody and told again it was a fantasy. &quot;Echelon&quot; was designed for the cold war, born from the famous UK-USA pact involving the US, Great Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Designed and used by private corporations such as Boeing, Hughes or Loockeed, it monitors every single air waves, signals from the Internet, telephone, faxes, radio, and underwater fibers or cables. When the Russian empire collapsed, former president Clinton gave up to the pressure of the corporations that ran &quot;ECHELON&quot; and allowed economic spying on its &quot;allies&quot;. In two well documented occurrences, &quot;ECHELON&quot; successfully helped US companies win multi-million contracts over French or Japanese companies .&quot;ECHELON&quot; has also been used for domestic intelligence, with a spin to make such an activity legal. Western democracies have made domestic spying illegal without many legal safeguards. The five countries operating &quot;Echelon&quot; have the possibility to use it clandestinely at home or bypass their national laws regarding domestic spying by using each other to snoop on their citizens.President Johnson ordered the DOD to analyze the college student protestsThe CIA was exposed for having compiled files on over 13,000 individuals, including 7,000 US citizens and 1,000 domestic organizations between 69 and 78.In 75, the Canadians asked their British counterpart to monitor Mrs. Trudeau (the spouse of their prime Minister) under the suspicion of using pot.Henry Kissinger used the NSA to intercept the messages of then-Secretary of State William P. RogersIn 83, the Canadians were asked by the British to snoop on Mrs.. Thatcher&apos;s son, suspected of &quot;disloyalty&quot;.In 88, the NSA was exposed by an &quot;ECHELON&quot; operator for recording phone calls to and from South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond. The Reagan administration order the NSA to target Maryland Congressman Michael Barnes In 89, Mrs.. Thatcher used &quot;ECHELON&quot; to monitor a British newspaper that was alleging that her son took bribes in an arms deal..Do you even remember the post 9-11 &quot;Omnivore&quot; and &quot;Carnivore&quot;?All the furor over GW&apos;s secret domestic spying operations is just a political stunt by a &quot;short term memoried&quot; opposition and citizens lost in the utopian belief that they have privacy. Your license plate carries your name, your computer is run by spyware, you go around loudly and shamelessly spilling out your entire life in a cell phone that is GPS enabled and track all of your movements, allow all of your service providers to spam you and sell or share your personal info by checking the box without reading the fine prints, buy online or by phone, apply for all the freebees and rebates, leave your business card all over, don’t shred your mail nor secure your surfing history, don’t pay attention to all the personal data stolen everyday from legitimate businesses that have your bank records, and demand some kind of privacy from your government, the only one that can be made accountable for“spying”on you.

Wake up people: you have lost your privacy a long time ago! Your whole life is digitized and all over for sale or grab. You are a license number, a phone number, a SSN number, an IP address, a bank pin number, a patient number! You are a number! You are all over!

Once, in the immensity of the Sahara, my AK-47-totting friend Mahamat told me the wisest thing I ever heard about religion: &quot;Eric,&quot; he said, &quot;there is only one God and many ways to adore him!&quot;Now a vocal Muslim minority, reverberated by agenda-driven media (the cartoons where published last September: who dug them out and why?), want to turn our secular countries into Islamic-compatible lands, and demand from us to bear the weight of their integration.
I wish the silent majority of Muslim were marching to disassociate themselves from the nihilists that they said have &quot;hijacked&quot; their &quot;tolerant&quot; religion of &quot;peace.&quot; Unfortunately, the only one we are shown are demanding more blood, and destruction, reinforcing our perception of Islam as a radical, blood-thirsty religion.

By signing a exemption for the exit exam, our legislature catered to the entitlement crowd. The exit exam is suppose to be the pass to college and a professional life. By creating exemptions, not only does not the legislature fool anybody on the actual achievements of the exempts, but also tell the students who passed it that they wasted their time. Eventually, an associate degree will become the minimum hiring requirement if the exit exam gets the reputation of being given away to people who keep on failing it. We are only supposed to be equal by law. We are born unequal, some built to run tracks, some to eat donuts, some to sing, and some to design software. Life eventually sort us out and puts us where we belong, not where we want to be. Killing or devaluating the exam won&apos;t make the failed students more successful and won&apos;t affect the good one that will just have to pass the next level. There is indeed an easy way to better prepare the &quot;education challenged&quot; students: it is called vocational school or training! Remember: some people are born to carry the piano while other write symphonies and we should all be prepared to excel at what we are good at and not be made to believe that we all have the same potential.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I found it ironic that the Arab-catering American government finds the caricature of Muhammad offensive when our own god is ridiculed or attacked every day and when Muslim call for the destruction of Judaism! Muslims in Europe are abusing the Democratic freedom they found there to try to condemn a speech they consider offensive. They chose to leave their dictatorships of Islam for the more welcoming and very generous shores of the Western European democracies. Now they are trying to shape the policies of these secular countries into a more Islamic-compatible system. I wish they were more Muslim marching in our street to condemn the slaughter of innocent Muslims by the terrorists in Iraq! I wish they would have shown as much energy to reject the Talibans, denounce war-monging Saddam or Iran, condemn terrorism, disassociate themselves from the nihilists that they said &quot;hijacked&quot; their religion of peace. All this rubbish about Muslims getting upset over cartoons reminded me of the story of the infant teacher and the kindergarten drawing session.&quot;What are you drawing ?&quot; asked the teacher.&quot;I&apos;m drawing a picture of God,&quot; answered the little girl.&quot;But nobody knows what God looks like.&quot;&quot;They will when I&apos;m finished!&quot; replied the girl.

Ivory Coast, former African jewel, one of the few that made it and built up after its independance from France....here it is today, while we stand by, as described by a UN officer...

Growth in 2006, what growth? In one year, home sales volume dropped an average of 60 percent, gas prices have already sneaked back up to $2.40 a gallon, and the governor elected to &quot;clean house&quot; is talking about increasing our deficit. Welcome to 2006, different year but same baloney.
Instead of using the profit of the housing bubble to pay back the billions we already borrowed and spare our children, the state&apos;s Legislature is switching to its traditional spending frenzy mode to pay off pressure groups. &quot;Build it,&quot; the governor said. Build what: the deficit?
You cannot get away trying to be a free-spending liberal after two years of failing to be fiscally conservative. Keep it up and you will most certainly be &quot;voter-minated&quot; by the California taxpayers who chose not to flee.

After having pushed so long for free and fair elections in Palestine, the world is stuck today with a legitimate Palestinian government it does not like.The legally and fairly elected terrorist and extremist Hamas movement makes one wonder whether such a result of a democratic process makes sense at all. After all, it is just a bunch of terrorist that has been elected to replace another un-elected but recognized bunch of terrorist. Sometimes one has to beware of what he wishes for, especially in the Middle East

Michelle Mott finally killed the little compassion left in me for the so-called &quot;Katrina survivors&quot;. The evacuees from Lulling, LA, have been given tens of thousand of dollars in Californian help, free rent, present, cash, donation, on top of FEMA&apos;s money. But the free rent will end in three months and now they go around whining and criticizing the same people and administrations that helped them.They got $3000 from FEMA for wind damages on a house they did not even own but think that they deserve tens of thousands! They have low or no income, a free place in Mather, and complain because they cannot afford a $380,000 house in California. They are not even residents of this state but believe they should get our welfare money without filling the paperwork. They complain about our low paying construction job market when their hometown is booming with new oil drilling and when Louisiana is starving for builders (yahoo &quot;lulling, LA&quot;). Tell you what, people! For the past few months you actually had it better than many Nowhere in America can one purchase a house on a $14 an hour job ....do you remember? That is why you were renting back home! Actually, I cannot even afford Karate lessons for my own children, and had to take $500 from my hard earned savings to pay for Christmas, but what do you know, yours was free! So please, take your whining and go away!

Isn&apos;t it interesting that in a country where pouring melting wax over one&apos;s genitals, piercing almost anything from sexual organs to tongue and lips, inserting Botox or gel pads in organs, tattooing full bodies, or starving oneself to diet are considered normal, we end up calling a simple sleep deprivation torture ? Tell you what! Let&apos;s forget the sleep thing and start the hot wax and live piercing of our prisoners....for free! That would be called FASHION! 

What is torture?

Is it the treatment provided to our soldiers or nationals in Iraq or Afghanistan, the recorded pictures and videos of gory murders and mutilated bodies so gruesome that our media decided not to report…for our own good? (Thanks to the Internet and peer-to-peer they are available anyways!)
Is it only the bad treatment of a few prisoners by a few psychos in uniform placarded all over by the same media….for our own good?

In Iraq, our forces won the land battle against the standing enemy armies of Saddam and won all the battles fought against the various local militias afterwards but like in the seventies, we are losing that war at home. Welcome back to Vietnam and remember the German saying:“Children, enjoy war because peace will be terrifying!”

Do you have any idea of what goes in the mind of our average GI Joe, our good US kid that went on a mission, to protect us?
I know that it is not a place I would like to visit right now! Ask Mister Kerry….he knows it all: the war, the crimes and the anti-war on the home front. Today, in our twisted world of twisted values, Arab media can freely glorify the &quot;freedom fighters&quot; and display the pictures of dead Americans, each one a small step toward victory against the &quot;great Satan&quot; while at home, American death and suffering are absent from the news except for the body count...How can we win a war without involving the people, without fueling anger against the enemy and cultivating patriotism?

Did anybody ever teach us never to pick a fight one is not willing to finish?                      
In Iraq, our troops are fighting, with their hands tied by the media, the polls, the public opinion, the international community, our democratic and Christian values, international laws, treaties and conventions we signed. Our troops are targets to the most coward form of terrorism, slaughtered and maimed one at a time by car bombs, roadside bombs, so called“freedom killers”sniping them in the back. Powerless, they do keep track of the body count and resent the indecision of our leaders stuck in approaching mid term elections. They see first hand the gruesome reality of the war fought by ruthless enemies, thousand of miles away from our politically correct dreamland. We are expecting so much from them and so little from the opposing forces that the whole thing is turning into a sad joke, another drama, asymmetric warfare at its best. Did we send them to verify again theories on human attrition in war and its domestic political effects or to wipe out the enemies of democracy?

Do you want to know what torture is?                                                               

 Torture is to get up every day to drive a truck of supply along“Roadside bomb alley”after having seen first end what nails, rocks and metallic shrapnels do to an unprotected human body.
Torture is to get up every day to go on foot patrol and expect any civilian to pull out a gun from under its robe and shoot you in the face.
Torture is to see the daily enemy’s lack of respect for human life, lack of respect for his own people that he uses as a shield or kill for propaganda.
Torture and pain is to restore power and water, resume oil production, open a school or build a bridge and see it blown to pieces by the obscurantist the next day.
Torture is to get up every day and be shot at from a hospital, a school or a Mosque and not be able to return fire while your comrades are spilling their blood in the gutters.
Torture is to get up every day knowing that if captured you will be denied any kind of mercy and that even your dead body will be used for psychological effect, returned as pulp or hung from a bridge for the blood thirsty media.
Torture is to remember the faces of the 2100 dead and the blood of the 10000 wounded or maimed comrades in arms you accompanied for their last trip home, most of them hit “when military vehicle hit an improvised explosive device…”, as the Pentagon officially reports it.
Torture is to realize that most of the wounded average 25 years old and many among them are left brain-damaged or blind, or both, from shrapnel and dirt blown to the face by roadside bombs, the“improvised explosive devices”that hit the only vital area not protected by body armor.
Torture is to come back home on short leave and watch biased home media echoing enemy propaganda, or listen to well fed, safe and comfy fellow Americans and elected official question the war the elected government sent you to wage.
Torture is to see heroes like Pat Tillman depicted as morons on MSNBC.
Torture is to be called a“baby killer”, to see Al-Jazeera news and biased hatred broadcasted home, to see the same people that accompanied our soldiers to the carriers, waving flags, cheering and all, now turning their back with disgust, burning the flag or marching for peace.

Torture is what all theses contradictory feelings, all that fear, pain, sorrow and anger do to our soldiers back there; it is what keeps them awake and accompany them daily for 365 days. A female US doctor in Iraq said once: &quot;I go to sleep and dream about them (-the young American casualties-) all night long, awaking in a sweat because something is wrong&quot;  

Above all the politics and partisanship, let me remind you what this war is all about, like all the other before; it is about young Americans risking their life for what they believe is a good cause, something worth dying for, you and me, US. I collected Christmas cards for the troops in the school my kids attend, and all the second and third graders made it so clear to me, above and beyond politics; with their own words they thanked an unknown soldier for protecting them, for being away from their families on this time of celebration, and wish them a safe return home. This war is first of all about our soldiers we sent back there and our duty is to honor and protect them.

   Sometimes, observing the US politic soap opera, the French in me truly wonder if the politicians and the people are just plain innocent, or if the whole country suffers from attention disorder.    

   It took an article by the New York Times on Friday December 16th, to start a media feeding frenzy, a campaign of fear orchestrated by almost everybody that want to keep the people down below, where they pay and shut up; The piece of news was that the Bush administration had allegedly secretly shattered a quarter of a century worth of regulations on &quot;spying”on American citizens! At least this is what was being reported and echoed, echoed, and echoed again.

   The facts appear to be slightly different and it looks like the administration only authorized the eavesdropping on INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS of suspected US citizens. That had been done with the blessing of the Attorney General and the knowledge of the members of the congress who were supposed to know. Sadly, the latter were apparently not shocked by the information until it became public and put them in the spotlight. Only than did they start to run for cover, and seek excuses for their passivity and inaction. 
   Indeed, with the fourth amendment that protects US citizens from illegal domestic seizures, the secret of any &quot;correspondence&quot; is preserved and cannot be broken without a legal process and a warrant. And sure enough, there is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in charge of granting these warrants after a review of the cases.
But the Bush administration bypassed the court and went directly to the chief law officer of the Executive Council (the Attorney General) for the legal advices, and congress for information. Is that illegal, worth talking about impeachment?
   On top of that, one can make the case that the intercepted communications were INTERNATIONAL, and not domestic, and that a warrant was not necessary. 

For those out there who pay attention, our domestic &quot;privacy&quot; has been gone for a while now. Just think of it! Most of the businesses are monitoring our shopping habits, health condition, Internet surfing, types of phone calls, banking, eating, driving habits.... in order to better target us and mold us into the perfect little shopping machines. That happens every single day and we don&apos;t care! Proud to be American, we drive around with our names on our license plates, chain forward emails, fill up tons of rebate coupons, provide our credit card info to machines on the web, gamble online, give our zip code to gasoline pumps, visit chat rooms, smile at cameras at the drive-in ATM machines, take phone surveys, &quot;use&quot; computers but cannot spell spyware, make sure the cell phone GPS is on.... Our entire life and lifestyle is already out there, digitized, FOR SALE! And on top of that, our &quot;Ritalined&quot; society DOES NOT PAY ATTENTION!   

One day of 2000 , &quot;Omnivore&quot; came along, quickly followed by its more efficient brother &quot;Carnivore&quot;.


 
   Should have we paid attention when Earthlink sued the FBI (and lost), to avoid installing the email traffic-monitoring tool on its servers in July 2000 . Should have we noted that in the name of the almighty national security, this tool that is running at all the Internet Service Provider level to mine data on a targeted individual, was also exposed for its collecting of all the rest of the traffic? Should have we thought about it and about the implications for the future?

   Should have we noticed, in 1998, when a preliminary report by the European Parliament (covered by the New York Times) exposed a massive US led spy technology network called Echelon that was intensively used to monitor world phone, fax, email, and radio transmissions for economic and political gain, mainly outside but also inside the US.

   Should have we given it a second thought when the Europeans showed up in Washington to get some answers and were gently ignored by the whole congress, while the US government was publicly denying such a thing as the (well documented) system ECHELON?

   Should have we noticed the Australian confession to belonging to such an organization?    

  Should we wonder why, mostly in Europe, there is a &quot;Jam Echelon day&quot; during which &quot;Internauts&quot; are invited to flood cyberspace with emails containing all the search worlds used by the spying system, words such as &quot;bomb&quot;, &quot;terrorism&quot;... (There are even a couple of word generators available for the lazy &quot;emailers&quot;)? 

   Should we be aware of systems such as ECHELON, OMNIVORE, CARNIVORE, ALTVORE, OASIS, FLUENT, STEEPLEBUSH, RUNWAY, PUSHER, MOONPENNY, KNOBSTICKS, GT-6,  or SILKWORTH ? 



            Finally, the most important clue we should have noticed was the British worry in 1997, when they discovered that the US based Lockheed constructed and managed  SILKWORTH system had permanently monitoring 100,000 simultaneous British calls since 1975 , showing to the world how the so called post WW2 &quot;UKUSA&quot;  agreement was ab-used to bypass national laws.

Basically, the UKUSA agreement involves the USA, the United Kingdoms, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The five Anglo-Saxon countries run about 50 high-tech 24/7 listening stations spread out across the world and especially focused on US based Internet hubs, underwater repeaters of communication cables, and communication satellites. Historically designed to monitor the Russian communist empire during the Cold War, the COMINT (Communication Intelligence) network has been extensively used for political and economic gains by its members since 1989.

   Spying is fair game, and eavesdropping on non-UKUSA countries makes political sense. But a darker side of the alliance has also been disclosed by ex spies and operatives, politicians and journalists turned book writers and describing how the various governments involved in the alliance have often resorted to each other to &quot;spy&quot; on their own citizens in order to circumvent domestic laws on domestic spying! 

                                                       Here it is, finally on your laps, the real reasons for hysteria and paranoia! And they are called &quot;check and balance&quot;, &quot;oversight&quot;, &quot;transparency&quot;, and“control&quot;. 

   If we do need to be able to monitor the domestic communications of suspected domestic &quot;bad guys&quot;, we also need to understand how it is done, what tools we are using, and who is preserving the &quot;check and balance&quot; of these top secret systems that don&apos;t even officially exist and cannot be talked about. (God knows where I am going to end up with my Green card for such an open source and generic paper on really well documented COMINT systems). 
   Obviously, our Congress is in the dark and has not paid more attention to the issues than the average Joe, despite a history of cases involving the exposed snooping on some of their members. Obviously, the government knows some and uses the various systems LEGALLY, if not ethically.... but everything goes and should go in the name of National interest and security! 


   What is worrisome, besides the utopian concept of entitlement of some privacy from our government that we might still have, is the developing and use of these spying tools by private corporations contracted by &quot;unofficial&quot; federal agencies to do all the hyper-classified job. Who is monitoring whom in this spying game and to what extent should the Lockheed, TRW, Boeing, Hughes and other be trusted to abide the laws and not fall into a lucrative and self interest based spying game? What started as a“noble”tool against the Red Army and the communist coalition of Eastern Europe, has now been given a broader mandate against the free populations of the world. The successive governments making the UKUSA alliance have obviously used these tools to go around their own laws, perverting the intent and the letter of these text designed to preserve their citizens from abuses. Furthermore, the fact that ECHELON has been used to spy on the same elected officials that are supposed to protect and represent us, shows that nobody really control the agencies in charge and that the &quot;beast&quot; is kind of running by itself.

   The US congress, according to all the recent interviews, reactions and reports, seems unaware of the US spying capability, and worse of all, unaware of its use. One must wonder why they are still being paid! The European Parliament has been on top of the problem for almost ten years now, and trying to figure out how to deal with that disturbing issue of the Anglo Saxon &quot;Big Brother”. Maybe the US congress, along with England and its minions should join the European Parliament in figuring out what is definitely bad in the way the system works or is being used, in the name of future generations. The movie &quot;1984&quot; comes back to mind reading this paper! We are getting there, asleep at the helm!  

Some twenty years ago, during the Watergate hearings, Senator Frank Church warned the American people when he claimed that he saw how easily America could become a tyranny if the technology that was available at the time was to be handled by unsupervised agencies.   

   The examples above, and the recent over-blown &quot;scandal&quot;, only show that some of our laws have to be revisited and revised because of the passing of time and the technological evolution of our society. This is needed to prevent the unethical but legal interpretation of their intent and letter our armies of lawyers are so fond of, and to avoid any of the tempting possible circumvention that bypass the check and balance process our democratic governments are founded upon.
Should the government be allowed to monitor domestic threats? Definitely yes, but the government should not be in the business of trying to trick the system and should leave it to“shyster”lawyers!
Should the people pay attention to what is going on outside suburbia? You bet.
Should we trust our elected officials not to fall asleep while on constitutional guard duty? Get real!

The lemmings!


 If Contrary to popular belief, the Lemming&apos;s suicide is a fiction perpetuated by a the Disney movie &quot; White Wilderness&quot;  where they were forced over a cliff by the fiming crew for dramatic effect, it is true that lemmings are much more likely to kill each other than to kill themselves...


American businesses, to avoid paying for the hard earned perks that make our country a &quot;civilized&quot; one (minimum wages, retirement, medical, vacations, workers comps, workers legal protections...), are taking their business to poor or developping countries, thus shortchanging the &quot;native&quot; labor.


Call it progress: since we implemented laws against human trafficking and slavery, businesses now export the labor to foreign &quot;slave&quot; workers in foreign sweat shops.American farmers, along the Southern border states, legally get away with their hiring cheap illegal immigrant labor from Mexico, labor force they pay minimum wages without any of the required decent perks mandatory for citizens.


Call it progress, they don&apos;t have to kidnap their laborers in Africa and ship them over. Mexican illegals risk death to get one of these jobs.To avoid ethical American concern and laws regarding the treatment of prisonners, government agencies clandestinely &quot;ship&quot; them to allied semi-dictatorship for interrogations.


Call it morals: we will protect our red legged frogs or our dogs but hypocritically let foreign intelligence services dirty their hands for us.To bypass the Freedom of information act, government agencies are now resorting to sub-contracting jobs to private corporation (even military operations), thus preventing any kind of oversight by the public.


Call it progress, by the People and for the People!To avoid laws and restrictions on human medical reasearches, US labs and private scientific entities move their facilities and brains abroad. It just happened again with the stem cell research entities that made an alliance with South Korean labs to by-pass American laws. Thanks god Hitler&apos;s &quot;devil &quot;s doctors&quot; are no longer around because we would have US labs in Dachau or Buchenwald!


Call it hypocrisy: let us harvest organs from South American children, buy Chinese dog and cat&apos;s leather, promote human guinea pigs....as long as it is not in our backyard!This trend is just not American. The so-called Western civilizations are plagued with the same trend and exporting jobs, knowlege and &quot;brains&quot; to countries less likely to take into account outdated concepts such as democracy, right to work, right to assemble, right to dissent, freedom of speech, freedom of choice, respect of others, respect of life, right to vote, right to work, minimum wage, vacations...Short sighted and in the name of the almighty dollar, Euro or Yen, they are rapidly depriving their own citizens with the opportunities and the jobs that will fashion their own future. 


America is leading the march and the banner is proudly and very successfully carried by Walmart.Our cheap goods come from abroad, manufactured by modern time &quot;slave labor&quot; trained in local US built schools while our plants close, while &quot;native&quot; employees lose their jobs, and kids don&apos;t see any potentially rewarding professional training. Opening a Pandora box the government let United Airlines default its contractual pension plan, already followed by many other major US companies toying with that (good!?) idea.


Call it progress. Once upon a time, we were roaming earth on our fours...with the lemmings. We went full circle, walked up, drove, wore a tie and back to primitive behavior, from a democratic community to the survival of the fittest. No, we might not run to the cliff together, but it definitely looks like we are doing a good job at destroying each others future.

Isn&apos;t it interesting that in a country where pouring melting wax over one&apos;s genitals, piercing almost anything from sexual organs to tongue and lips, inserting Botox or gel pads in organs, tattooing full bodies, or starving oneself to diet are considered normal, we end up calling a simple sleep deprivation torture? What is torture?Tell you what! Let&apos;s forget the sleep thing and start the hot wax and live piercing of our prisoners....for free! That would be call FASHION!

                  A DIFFERENT CHRISTMAS POEM THAT WAS FORWARDED TO ME!

The embers glowed softly, and in their dim light,                                                                          I gazed round the room and I cherished the sight.
My wife was asleep, her head on my chest,
My daughter beside me, angelic in rest.
Outside the snow fell, a blanket of white,
Transforming the yard to a winter delight.
The sparkling lights in the tree I believe,
Completed the magic that was Christmas Eve.


My eyelids were heavy, my breathing was deep,                                                                Secure and surrounded by love I would sleep.                                                                       
In perfect contentment, or so it would seem,
So I slumbered, perhaps I started to dream.
The sound wasn&apos;t loud, and it wasn&apos;t too near,
But I opened my eyes when it tickled my ear.
Perhaps just a cough, I didn&apos;t quite know,
Then the sure sound of footsteps outside in the snow.



My soul gave a tremble, I struggled to hear,
And I crept to the door just to see who was near.
Standing out in the cold and the dark of the night,                                                                   
A lone figure stood, his face weary and tight.
A soldier, I puzzled, some twenty years old,
Perhaps a Marine, huddled here in the cold.
Alone in the dark, he looked up and smiled,
Standing watch over me, and my wife and my child.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; I asked without fear,
&quot;Come in this moment, it&apos;s freezing out here!
Put down your pack, brush the snow from your sleeve,
You should be at home on a cold Christmas Eve!&quot;
For barely a moment I saw his eyes shift,
Away from the cold and the snow blown in drifts..
To the window that danced with a warm fire&apos;s light
Then he sighed and he said &quot;Its really all right,

I&apos;m out here by choice. I&apos;m here every night.
Sleep without fear as you turn out your lights.
&quot;It&apos;s my duty to stand at the front of this line,
That separates you from the darkest of times.
No one has asked or begged or implored me,
I&apos;m proud to stand here like my fathers before me.
My Gramps died at &apos;Pearl on a day in December,&quot;
Then he sighed, &quot;That&apos;s a Christmas &apos;Gram always remembered.&quot;

My dad stood his watch in the jungles of &apos;Nam&apos;,
And now it is my turn and so, here I am.
I&apos;ve not seen my own son in more than a while,
But my wife sends me pictures, he&apos;s sure got her smile.                                                                                                                                Then he bent and he carefully pulled from his bag,
The red, white, and blue... an American flag.
&quot;I can live through the cold and the being alone,
Away from my family, my house and my home.

I can stand at my post through the rain and the sleet,
I can sleep in a foxhole with little to eat.
I can carry the weight of killing another,
Or lay down my life with my sister and brother..
Who stand at the front against any and all,
To ensure for all time that this flag will not fall.&quot;
&quot;So go back inside,&quot; he said, &quot;harbor no fright,
Your family is waiting and I&apos;ll be all right.&quot;

&quot;But isn&apos;t there something I can do, at the least,
&quot;Give you some money, prepare you a feast?
It seems all too little for all that you&apos;ve done,
For being away from your wife and your son.&quot;
Then his eye welled a tear that held no regret,
&quot;Just tell us you love us, and never forget.
To fight for our rights back at home while we&apos;re gone,       
To stand your own watch, no matter how long                                                                                                                                                 For when we come home, either standing or dead,
To know you remember we fought and we bled.
Is payment enough, and with that we will trust,
That we mattered to you as you mattered to us.

Folsom Point / Dike Eight Folsom, Empire Ranch, California


Just north-west of Sacramento in the suburb of Folsom is the Folsom Lake State Recreation Area. The southern end of the lake is contained by a series of dams and dikes. At the south-east end of the lake is the earthen Mormon Island Dam, also called Dike Eight. This dam is about 3/4 miles long, and takes a dog-leg turn between the west and middle third. Interestingly,  if my memory serves me well, about 2 to 3 years ago, realtors won a lawsuit and were granted a permit to build &quot;Empire Ranch&quot; and its golf course. Again, if my memory serves me well, these dykes were originally designed to protect the main Dam from collapsing. In case of a major flood that could put the dam at risk, that specific dyke was supposed to break or be opened to empty the excess water and divert it away from Sacramento. Well, now, the diversion course is through suburbia!

In Empire ranch, nobody wonder why a small stream runs through their houses, along the bicycle tracks. On Green Valley road, right at its lowest and closest point to the dyke, there is a &quot;park&quot;, a little protected swamp. I wonder where the water comes from? Seepage or release?

Furthermore, since I have moved there, early 2002, I have seen too many times drilling and concrete crews working there, reinforcing the bases of the dyke. Lately, they have also dumped tons of rocks, on its base again.

I got the opportunity to see the whole area from above, the top of Eldorado Hill (Muse street) and it is scary! You can see the lake and millions of gallons of water towering above the little valley where Empire ranch was built. You can see the &quot;park&quot; swamp and the line of mature trees that follow the stream that zigzag through suburbia. You can imagine the &quot;what if???&quot; disaster scenario: major flood, seepage, levee failure, earthquake (the Bear fault is under the lake....again, if my memory serves me well!). 


Have a good day....in paradise!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A $300 million dollar program has been set by the Pentagon to counter balance what is perceived as disinformation regarding military operations in the media. This psy-ops (psychological warfare operation or &quot;information war&quot;) has been designed to offer the &quot;half full glass&quot; vision of the war as an alternative to the &quot;half empty&quot; that is our daily bread.World and national media have shown a tendency to print or broadcast the grim, the bloody, the scandalous....in one word, the &quot;paparazzi&quot; type news we, the tabloid hungry people, enjoy so much.


What makes the news is one man&apos;s opinion (the editor, the party&apos;s mouth piece, the agenda driven person....). Anybody with two cents of common sense and some critical thinking knows that it takes a lot of investigating on an issue of interest in order to strip it from all the &quot;bias&quot; and unearth a clearer picture. Yes, it takes work to educate oneself!Many are perceiving the Pentagon effort as another administration plot to temper with free press and free speech because the Army will (and is currently doing it) pay for its literature to be printed. But is it an attempt to eradicate our free press and speech?


Call me cynical, but I do believe that the press and other news apparatus have given up informing people for the more lucrative job of making money, blowing with the wind and actually dis-informing. Examples:&quot;Tookie&quot; Williams was a saint and the media never showed any picture of his victims, nor described how he plotted to escape by killing cops or why he was put in isolation for sexual assault and attacking a guard. When millions of Iraqis are going to vote, we focus on the Ministry of Justice clandestine death squad and its120 murders.When a school is reopened in Iraq, the media count.the casualties to the last roadside bombs.When a plane crashes it makes the front page but articles never tell you how many landed safely on the same day.West Nile Virus, Ebola or Avian flu haunt us despite a mere couple of hundred casualties a year while thousands of Americans still die from medical errors or the regular flu.


News are biased, tainted by their agenda or lack of agenda, and there is nothing such as an objective news media in the world. Welcome to the Pentagon information warfare channel! Knowing that some &quot;alternative&quot; media options are going to be offered to me on the military operations is actually THE exciting piece of news of the day, and most likely, whatever the Pentagon is going to sell for printing is going to be under such a scrutiny that it is going to be true. Furthermore, the false ethic debate on paying to be published is so hypocritical! Isn&apos;t our media system all about money anyways? Free press means freedom to print anything, buy ($) the information, buy ($) the whole edited piece and publish it, or pay to be printed. Our freedom is to &quot;buy&quot; the news or not, to believe our media or not.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Using sexy women to get a &quot;legitimate&quot; business going is indeed the oldest and most successful trick of the world and ranges from the &quot;Hooters&quot; cult thing to the live underwear models in shopping malls. Men have a very simple wiring connected to an hyper sensible &quot;reptilian brain&quot; that cannot resist any call of the wild. Any good looking female wearing the right hot business attire and generating the right level of sex appeal combined to a just amount of innocent flirtation can get any potential male customer to climb the curtains and buy a bridge in Paris. That the Pharmaceutical industry is using former cheerleaders to sell their various magic pills should not be of any surprise to any of us. But that the hot bimbo factor could be the only reason why a doctor would prescribe me a medication instead of another is pretty disturbing to me.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Khmer rouges communist minority seized power, and blew up century old temples and religious idols of the prestigious past of their ancestors, sold statues and slaughtered the monks. The Pakistanis sponsored Taliban minority blew up century old giant Buddha and imposed their ruthless religious tyranny to keep Afghanistan in the darkness. In Russia, communists eradicated religion for almost a century in the name of their atheist enlightened doctrine that claimed millions of lives. 


At home, the ACLU and other American extremists groups want to blow up the Ten Commandments our founding fathers veneered, chisel our first ever written laws out of governmental buildings, outlaw the &quot;majority rule&quot; concept, split the society into a multitude of self aware groups, promote unity through difference, happiness through political correctness, compliance through legal &quot;neuterization&quot; of the opposition. The dictatorship of the minorities is running full steam in our open society that allow single individuals or small insignificant groups to challenge the majority, the laws, and the constitution in the name of a self serving arrogant entitlement.



This is extremism at work: illiterate or self righteous arrogant psychos imposing their twisted views of liberty and happiness on the masses.  The last time I checked, America was still a white &quot;christian&quot; country, thus explaining why one can see more references to &quot;Christmas&quot; than to a &quot;Hanukah&quot; or &quot;Kwanza&quot; during the Holy-day season. The last time I checked, for an automaker, it makes more sense to advertise SUVs in family oriented publication than in Gay magazines. The last time I checked, the jail population is made of people who committed crimes or broke the law and only happened to be white, red or black. The last time I checked, abstinence, condoms, and &quot;no to drugs&quot; prevent AIDS, not races. Everyday, the silent majority is assailed by agenda driven groups seeking power beyond their relevance. And everyday, these groups get these powers thanks to the broken legal system.  


What is America made of? 300 million people? Depending on the issue of the day, it seems to me that it is made of 300 millions of lawyers, or 300 million black, or 300 million gays, 300 million atheists, 300 million peaceniks, 300 million victims of police brutality... you name it! If you are part of a minority, and don&apos;t like what most of the rest of the population does or believes, you need to become the new majority by spreading your own ideas and beliefs and convincing people to adopt them, as a new attractive alternative that makes sense. But not here! Not in the land of the free!Here, minority groups just play the legal card, the political correctness asset, and the media to prevent the majority of the people from doing whatever they all like to do or believe. Unable to offer any alternative to what the majority likes to do, these totally irrelevant factions take it to the bench and bring the majority to their level. 


I am French (you know it by know) and don&apos;t care much about Halloween or Thanksgiving. Should I go around with my attorney and try to deny you the right to eat poultry, like PETA, or should I just cook a filet mignon and water it down with Beaujolais? Should I deny you the right to decorate your shopping centers and homes with ghosts and witches or should I just ignore them?The old saying &quot;in Rome do as the Romans do&quot; stand for here too: &quot;at home, do whatever you want, but in America, do as Americans do&quot;....so I am going to sue y&apos;all because you are offending me in everything that you do that I don&apos;t like.  


A Martian American and a white-non-Hispanic are sitting in a fast food restaurant in an all white town. E.T says: I love America. We have freedom of speech. I can stand up right now and scream: I hate white trash!  The white guy says: you are right, it is a great country.I can go in your hood, stand in a Martian restaurant and scream &quot;I hate white trash&quot; too! 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


America has demonstrated its political weakness in Iraq, and now the violences that have proven successful against our country&apos;s resolve are being used by foreign fighters in Afghanistan. The &quot;poster child&quot; for the war against terror is experiencing more of the suicide and roadside bombings that worked so well in the streets of Baghdad. America became such a spineless country manipulated by agenda driven groups and media that it won&apos;t even try to stand up and fight for survival, nor even allow its soldiers to fight for it.The national public forums are filled with blames and finger pointings, and totally lack common sense propositions or solutions. We are becoming the laughing stock of the world and China is learning. Did we fall so low as to really become this self centered lootering-like crowds at the shopping malls on &quot;black Friday?&quot; Is it what our soldiers are fighting for? Than, bring them home because we do not deserve their sacrifice!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Here it goes again. Not even one week after a total victory over El Gobernator, the state is back at its best &quot;business as usual&quot; gimmick: bonds! What about a 10,2 billion bond for the Californian infrastructure in 2006? A 10 to 15 billion bond a year seems like a good solution to fix the budget deficit. After all, as long as the equity of Califunia is taxpayers based, why shouldn&apos;t the legislature borrow more to pay the things our taxes are originally taken for. The financial scandal at the University of California showed us were the money goes. Millions of hard earned taxes were spent in raises, bonuses and perks for execs and staffers while tuition increased. Eventually, we, the people, had to cover the extra cost on top of paying the taxes. And the University had the nerves to beg for more money and blamed Arnold for harming the students, Wake up people! The sacred cow is fat enough now and it is about time we slaughter it and party...or move out and starve it to death.

 The terrorists in Iraq are using despicable tactics that are still deeply engraved in every mind in France. Between 1954 and 1962, In Algeria, Northern Africa, the French military faced a ruthless &quot;liberation army&quot; that was resorting to terror to achieve its final goal, the liberation of the country from the colonial power. The terrorists of the time were avoiding direct confrontations with the French military while bombings public places, executing colons, soldiers, white or Algerians, and conducting drive by/walk by shooting. Most of the time, they would also mutilate the bodies of their victims to better convey their message of terror. During that merciless war, there was no possible neutrality and the poor &quot;fellah&quot; (peasant) that both parties were claiming to fight for was the one that paid the highest price in blood and extorted money for the terrorist cause. Eventually, Paris gave the full powers to the military to win that thing , judicial included, and the military started to use torture against the captured terrorists. At that time, there was a saying: &quot;there are two kinds of terrorists today: the one that is working on his bomb to blow up 20 to 40 people, and the one we torture in order to stop that bombing!&quot;. Eventually, these CIDs (cruel and Inhumane or degrading) allowed a quick victory over the terrorist network, and the Algerian &quot;National Liberation Army&quot; (ALN) collapsed. 

The military battle was won.... but politically; it ended up in a disaster that cost France the collapse of the government of the fourth republic, a military coup, an attempt on the life of the president, and a humiliating withdrawal from Algeria. Recently, an American soldier in Iraq, interviewed by the Post, referred to the partisan movie that the Algerian government commandeered just after the war, &quot;The Battle of Algiers” and said: &quot;It&apos;s a little like the French colonel in &apos;The Battle of Algiers.&apos; You&apos;re all complaining about the tactics I am using to win the war, but that&apos;s what I am doing - winning the war.&quot; 

What is torture, what are abuses, what is excessive force?
A massive bomb is hidden in a stadium during the super bowl. You arrested the terrorist and he is bragging that you are too late, that the bomb is going to explode in half an hour and that you cannot evacuate the place in time.... what would YOU do? To spice it up, let us say your son, or wife, or husband, or the tree of them are in the stadium, enjoying their (last?) hot dogs.
In some cases, can torture be legitimized?
What should one do against an enemy that resorts to terror, mutilation and torture as a weapon?
Are people in jail (death row inmate), victims of some level of physical or psychological torture?

The rest of the world is concerned by the US control of the Internet because it currently provides America with the ability to unilaterally monitor the worldwide email traffic that is currently channelled through its national hubs. A couple of years ago, the European parliament investigated the role of the US controlled system &quot;Echelon&quot; that spies worldwide communication systems and provides the US with military and economic intelligence. The report named and described bases, infrastructure and equipment throughout the world and showed evidences that this cold war tool setup to monitor the communist block, was now being used alongside the email monitoring tool &quot;carnivore&quot;, and the other Oasis and Fluent programs to provide US industries with an economic edge over the spied European and Asian countries. A European delegation was eventually sent to Washington to confront the US government with the findings, but it was not welcomed nor heard, and today, the US government still denies the existence of &quot;Echelon&quot;. Who said that the Internet was free and &quot;open&quot;?

&quot;Tookie&quot; William found transformation in jail proving that &quot;cruel and inhumane punishment&quot; can work. Should we spare the life of a repented killer or fry him for the four cold blooded murders of innocent people. The death penalty system is flawed in California because it allows &quot;redemption&quot; at tax payers expenses. With the passing of time, memories of the victims fade while the death row inmate can rebuilts his damaged public image. Too easy! The clock of &quot;Tookie&quot; Williams stopped in 1979 when he killed the four people he was robbing. Furthermore, he is also &quot;co-responsible&quot; for the other thousands of gang related murders the gang he &quot;co-founded&quot; committed. Wasn&apos;t the Crisp his brainchild, applying in the streets his heinous and violent doctrine? Williams is no hero and would have mercyless shot the Swiss moron behind the Nobel nomination, &quot;Snoop Dog&quot; or any other  supporters, if they had worn the wrong color of clothing in his &quot;hood&quot;. Wake up people!

A couple of weeks ago, I had to pick my daughter up from school and take her to an emergency medical appointment. Diagnosis: acute ear infection and prescribed ear drops six times a day. The next day, I took her back to school and asked the teacher if she could administrate the medication. She said that she could not and sent me to the school nurse, at the main office. The nurse asked me for a written permission from the doctor, permission I did not have and
could not get quickly without another emergency appointment and lost day of work. I just told them to give me a call again when my daughter will complain about the pain and went, kind of upset. In the meantime, she can go to the same teacher to confess a pregnancy, be forwarded to a friendly nurse for directions, sent to sympathetic (un)Planned Parenthood staffers for clandestine processing, and eventually get an abortion without parental knowledge. And the majority in California voted that it is right and should stay like that. I wonder how many parents went to vote?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Many have asked me what the heck was happening in France and I guess I should warn you that what you are actually seeing there is just down the road for you, in America. The ongoing riots in the suburbs of France are just the results of unbridled immigration policies by successive governments, lack of integration of the Muslim community in the fabric of the French republic, high unemployment for low educated young people of Northern African origins, and excessive demagogy from partisan politicians hungry for new votes at any price. Sounds familiar, does it?


The riots started when two &quot;outstanding&quot; French teenagers from Arab descent tried to avoid a police checkpoint and hid in a power sub-station were they eventually electrocuted themselves. The event was quickly twisted by some media and partisan politicians (you know, the one that don&apos;t have the power and try to get it back), and broadcasted as an example of Police brutality toward two young immigrants. On top of that, Mr Nicolas Sarkhozy, responsible for the National security and head of the Police, unfortunately claimed that the nation would be protected, laws enforced and that he would &quot;hose away the scum of the suburbs.&quot; These words were of course largely echoed and amplified by the free media as well as the politicians from the &quot;opposition&quot; to such an extent that it just made things worse by legitimizing the &quot;anger&quot; of the immigrants and their violence and by &quot;evilizing&quot; the institutions and the rule of law (to understand part of the extreme mediatization of his world, one has to know that Mr Sarkhozy planned on running for President and that everything goes to &quot;destroy&quot; his political stand ).


Every year, around Christmas, young immigrants traditionally burn cars and riot, for the kick of it, challenging the national political will , and daring the police to do anything about it. The way it goes is the following: year one, suddenly, out of the blue, &quot;young suburbanites&quot; burn x hundred cars (one cannot describe them as anything else but &quot;young&quot; or &quot;teenagers&quot;, or victims!). Lots of media attention for a &quot;festive&quot; event and the media and politicians look for excuses, not reasons and culprits; on year two, around the same period, the media brings the subject again, interview hooded teens and the Police. Of course the Police promises action and that turns into a daring game involving more cops, more suburbs, more &quot;angry youth&quot; while the media keeps the tally of the burned cars and crowns a winner....it started in 1998, and still goes on!


These violence have never been met with the strict application of the laws, and again, this time, instead of putting out a small fire before it grew, the government tried to &quot;reach out&quot; to the &quot;elders&quot; of the &quot;community&quot; to stop the emerging riots. In the meantime, the media and &quot;opposition&quot; looked for excuses, blamed unemployment, low education, fear of the Police,and other demagogic heart bleeding excuses for the anarchist looters and rioters. Again, like so often in America, instead of looking at the crime, we looked at the possible reasons why it had been committed and tried to forge excuses for it. Plain wrong! When is the last time I was unemployed and angry, and went in a rioting-looting rampage? When is the last time you did it?


The French immigration policy is two fold: the law of the land automatically grants the French citizenship to any baby born in France; the family reunion clause allows any legal immigrant to bring his whole extended family over. Furthermore, most of the immigrants came from former colonies, mostly from North African Muslim countries. They brought over there relatives, had many children and never really integrated in the mostly Christian and open French society. Huge government-subsidized low rent suburbs were built for these poor immigrants that could not afford any other housing and had low paid manual jobs because of their lack of qualifications. They raised many kids in these &quot;concrete ghettos&quot;, many kids that are trying to find their identity, not being French nor really Muslim. Low income families, subsidized neighborhoods, street gang life versus free public education, consumer society that promotes quick rewards versus low paid jobs, and a new political weight created by irresponsible politicians willing to sell the country off for a couple of extra votes, eventually forged this sub-society of &quot;anarchists&quot;.


Did they originally come for the work or for the unemployment? Who cares! Life is still sweeter in France for all of them than it was or would have been where they originated from. They passed on the opportunities (free education, getting out of the suburbs and moving on) and blamed everybody else for their shortcomings. The hold out their hands and burn everything if you don&apos;t pay, schools and churches included.These pathetic events drive me nuts, anger me, because I care for my country and don&apos;t believe that the French owe anything to any of these French born sons of immigrants. They are just lazy bums that found quick ways to make a buck, live in violent packs and terrorize their community, abuse the social system, and abuse the weaknesses of our democratic open societies, with the complicity of partisan politicians and the free forum and amplification chamber of irresponsible media.Eventually, if the government does not reclaim the streets quickly, Monsieur Dupont (French John Doe) will start defending his &quot;hood&quot; with his shot gun. Do you know one can buy a WW2 submachine gun with 500 rounds of ammos for $200 in the streets of Strasbourg?


 Don&apos;t laugh to hard, America. The way it is here, you are next!

Faithfull to the“anti-occident”concept of &quot;assymetric warfare&quot; that was born during the French-Algerian colonial war, and  is deeply rooted in the writings of Mao and Sun Tzu, the so-called &quot;iraqi insurgents&quot;, in the name of their struggle, resort to terror against the population, torture, executions, mutilation, kidnapping, terrorist tactics, bombings, extortion, disinformation, and sabotage.   Simultaneously, any morally reprehensive or illegal act from any force of the coalition, is immediately exposed by our media, the Weapons of Mass Disinformations we were so desperately seeking back there (WMDs).

   In his book,“Asymmetric warfare or the defeat of the victor”(2003), Jacque Baud states the theory that has also been echoed by the Brazilian author and philosopher Olavo de Carvalho: the media is both &quot;the major weapon of the terrorists,&quot; and the vector of &quot;disinformation as a weapon.&quot;    

   Recently, Olavo de Carvalho even stated that the public was &quot;brainwashed&quot; to the point that “it won’t even detect the inborn immorality of the so-called moral requirements demanded from one of the parties while granting the other an indifferent and accomplice silence for its violation of the same requirements.”

   It works anyways, and paralyzes governments and scares politicians! 

Do you trust the media, and do you think that we are losing the war on the media battleground?

Last week, an ABC TV show dealt a huge blow to the security and safety of some US nuclear reactors, namely the 25 reactors independently run by major university such as Irvine or Penn State ( http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/LooseNukes/story?id=1206529&amp;page=1  ). With the help of a dozen of students learning journalism, the show took the viewer to a cross country trip of denial and criminal irresponsibility. Out of the 25 campus reactors, only one showed some semblance of security and denied access to a team of student. The other 24 were literally open, night and day, 24/7 and the student teams were even able to reach the core of the reactors. Unchallenged, they were often able to film the glowing core and pos for pictures, huge backpacks on their back, a couple of feet away from bomb grade uranium.Knowing that most of these active reactors contain anywhere from 20 to 50 pounds of weapon grade uranium that could be easily stolen or blown up as a crude dirty bombs in the middle of major urban area should concern anybody with some common sense, but none of the interviewed local authorities showed concern and all stood up for their security plans that rely on local law enforcement agencies....Scary!. This debacle, 4 years after 9-11, the war, the Patriot Act (etc,etc...) has been possible because the university ran plants don&apos;t fall under the direct responsibility and supervision of the government and are basically left alone without any control, &quot;Red team&quot; tests, or guidance.Many, in this forum and elsewhere, have claimed that the government was increasing its power and getting to much involved in our lives, in &quot;private&quot; businesses, that the Patriot Act and other measures weren&apos;t needed to grant us safety.Should we trust the universities to safeguard their installations? Should we trust the privately owned labs that &quot;play&quot; with real chemical, biological or nuclear &quot;military&quot; grade &quot;ingredients&quot;? How do you feel now, knowing that you live near a dirty bomb waiting to be detonated? Do we need more government to protect the majority from the denial of the few?

Well, housing price in Natomas, CA, just got shot down! Amazing, isn&apos;t it, that Natomas residents just realized that living in the shadow of a levee system means living in fear of a predicted flood. Amazing also that thanks to the New Orleans disaster, officials try to cover the rather large behind they have been sitting on for decades; suddenly, we need a new levee ASAP to back up the old decrepit and insufficient one.
Residents need information, flood insurance, provisions and contingency plans because nobody will be likely to escape a quick flood. The message is pretty clear: The elected officials failed residents (again?) by granting building permits for suburbia to expand in agricultural land (and taxes to flow in) without spending an extra dime on an old levee system.
It is up to the residents to get ready, according to the new guidelines that clearly state that it could be big, it could be bad and that residents will be on their own.
Good luck, Natomas, and pray to whomever you want that winter 2005 won&apos;t bring a &quot;pineapple express,&quot; nor the long overdue 100 year flood.

1.3 million abortions are performed every year in the US while 450.000 women get a morning after pill ? I am still waiting for a women&apos;s perspective to understand why one would need a morning after pill, an abortion pill or an abortion unless she has been raped or shown that the foetus is not viable, or the mother in danger? I hope my daughter will never be... there (I almost wrote &quot;that dumb!&quot;)! I hope she will respect her body and herself enough not to fall for the first upcoming horny moron! And if she does, I hope she will be smart enough to use one of the many available contraceptive tools.I don&apos;t believe any teenager should be put in a situation where she would have to express a &quot;statutory freedom&quot; and make the ACLU advocated &quot;pro-choice&quot; thing of terminating a pregnancy. The majority of the couples or single parents out there are normal people and depriving them from their parenting duties (and rights) is wrong.
All of you teenagers, repeat after me:

The theories on where Google is going to be next year are only abounding because Google is smartly enjoying its unique moment of fame to keep rumors going with one goal in mind:  raise as much money as it can as fast as possible! Right now, Google is a typical dot.com company, like so many that have hurt the economy not long ago... it only provides a service and does not produce or generate anything but quick return in investments and a bunch of new rich kids. Many similar search engine are doing the same job, some at least as well as this newly over-hyped company and it is hard to understand why Google has suddenly been labelled as the company &quot;that redefines the technology industry&quot;. Actually, Yahoo&apos;s digital library project recently challenged Google&apos;s questionable leadership, and the recent spread of rumors about Google&apos;s national wireless project, challenge to Microsoft software, or its plan on drawing on NASA rocket scientists, seems more like well engineered media campaign to regain the spotlights than anything else. Our society strives on short term &quot;foufou&quot; hypes, and Google is just another one of them!

Afghanistan, Massoud: a missed opportunity!

 
September 9 2001, Commander Ahmad Sha Massoud, the Lion of Panjshir, the Charismatic leader of the Northern Alliance that was fighting the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, was assassinated by two suicide bombers posing as journalists and commandeered by both the Talibans and Bin Laden. Two days later, the two towers of World Trade Center were collapsing in the streets of New York. Two months later, a US backed Afghan Northern Alliance was routing the Talibans and taking Kabul.

Who was Massoud, why was he killed?

Early on, Massoud, a fundamentalist, fought the Russian forces and its Afghan puppet regime with the Taliban forces. During the civil war that followed the withdrawal of the Russian forces, the Talibans, literally took control of the country and got rid of all the warlords and other opposition forces. According to his close friends, Commander Massoud, who learned to know the Talibans while fighting the Russians, saw a dark side in fundamental Islam and started to drift away from his earlier convictions. With the arrival of Al Qaeda in the wake of the new masters of Kabul, he took refuge to the North and created an Afghan coalition force aimed at getting rid of the Talibans and at restoring peace within a more secular and tolerant Islam. His struggle at the command of the Northern Alliance went mostly unnoticed to the world until the Talibans started to blow up century old statues of Buddha. Public executions, public beating of &quot;un-bearded&quot; men and &quot;disobedient&quot; women, or killing for no reason was kind of acceptable for the self centered and apathetic Western democracies; but how dare the nihilists destroy their cultural heritage and these statues so dear to our intellectuals and historians? 

April 4 2001, invited at the European Parliament, he is welcomed like a chief of State despite what the protocol had to say, and tries to warn the world of the dangers brewing in the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, thus signing his death warrant. He pleaded the Afghan cause to the European elected officials, warned the world of the danger represented by inference from Pakistan, the Talibans and foreigners from Al Qaeda. More important was his ignored direct message to President Bush: &quot;If peace is not restored to Afghanistan, if America does not help the Afghan people, it is almost certain that the Afghan problem will spread to America and many more countries&quot;. Sadly, the media did not reverberate his worlds and he even confided to his brother that the Occident&apos;s war on terror was just a bunch of slogans.

He was long convinced that the Talibans were incult mercenaries, a &quot;Pakistanis colonialist tool&quot; used to keep Afghanistan out of the way. Many historians have stated since that Pakistan was afraid of a growing Afghan nationalism and were using the Talibans and their fundamentalism to oppress it in order to make it &quot;unattractive&quot; to the rest of the world and prevent if from becoming a sovereign country. To make things worse, and profiting by the local political chaos, Al Qaeda&apos;s ideologist, the Egyptian Al Zawari and his financer Bin Laden, were also able to install the infrastructure of their &quot;foreign&quot; organization in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda quickly became a state within the state, another entity that Massoud had to fight.

Massoud risked his life to bring his warning message to the occident and eventually paid the ultimate price. Not only was he a political threat to the Talibans and Al Qaeda because of his international iconic status and the message he was pushing, but he was also a military threat because of his charisma that kept the Northern Alliance strongly united in its fight for a free and sovereign Afghanistan.

November 13 2001, a US journalist, Alan Cullison (also a Harvard professor), entered Kabul with the US backed victorious Northern Alliance. The Talibans were defeated and Bin Laden in the run in some remote caves near the border of Pakistan. America&apos;s revenge was consumed and Massoud avenged. In a local market, Alan bought an &quot;Al Quaeda&quot; laptop to replace his, lost in a battle, and found, among tons of incredible data, the original templates of all the accreditations the fake journalists used to get close to Massoud and kill him. As it appeared later, it was critical for the Talibans and Al Qaeda to execute Massoud before September 11 2001 because they knew how America would react to the planned terrorist attacks on New York. The machiavelic plan called for a commander US military intervention on Muslim Afghanistan to unite the Arab world against America. It also foresaw the possible use of the Northern Alliance as a more discreet US vehicle for retaliation and dictated the assassination of Commander Massoud as a way to break the cohesion of the Alliance and eventually split it back to irrelevant warring factions.

The plan eventually failed and the Northern Alliance resisted the loss of their adored leader, now resting in peace in a Mausoleum overlooking an almost democratic Afghanistan. The day before his death, Ahmad Shah Massoud, the Lion of Panjshir, shared these verses with a friend: &quot;This wonderful world is nothing else but history, history of deception, dirty tricks and spilled blood. Look up! The night is pregnant, and neither you nor me, know who will be the child of the night. The child of tonight is tomorrow, and nobody can tell what tomorrow will be or how it will be!&quot;.


 


Amhad Shah Massoud, the Lion of Panjshir! A great man died and America should be aware of his role and remember his name.

 United Press International reported early that Hurricane Katrina led more than 200 New Orleans police officers to quit the 1500 strong force , and two to commit suicide.(...) while Fire department officials said they weren`t aware of any such actions from any of their firefighters. Where do we go, as regular fragile citizens, when the people we pay and trust to protect us in case of emergency, just fail us and leave us at the mercy of whatever is hitting us? Too often, since America has been at war, have we heard pathetic and ridicule stories of reserve or active duty military personnel running AWOL or seeking a political refugee status in Canada because they &quot;did not know&quot; that joining the military could one day translate into going into harm&apos;s way to protect the country they vowed to serve. I guess the money and the 8 to 5 job was good until the CALL came! The debacle in New Orleans unfortunaltely brought a similar issue fore and shattereds whatever blind confidence I had toward public servants (Federal, state, city workers), public services (as in offering services to the public: hospitals, schools, nursing homes, daycare centers....), and many human being. Call it what you want but I am personally lacking the strong words I would need to describe the betrayal of the 200 cops that decided that their paychecks, uniform and oath were suddenly not worth doing their jobs ( jobs they are currently trying to get back now that the danger is gone) . How would one describe the nurses and doctor that literally abandonned their bed-ridden patient to the raising waters, or the nursing home workers that just dropped whatever they were doing to flee, knowing that they were abandoning the weakest among us to a certain death. What words can one use to describe that young mother that scattered her 3 children among friends and family the day before Katrina hit, and ran away on her own? Louisiana, like Florida a dozen times a year or Texas, recently, are lucky enough to have storm watches and plenty of warning to allow the right thing to be done at every echelon. But what just happened is depressing and makes me wonder about the notion of &quot;intelligent&quot; design...nah!!! we are too dumb to survive scrutiny!

 I live in &quot;Kalifuhnia&quot; ,aka &quot;la-la land&quot;, and the local &quot;plague&quot; is not going to have any cute name nor will it provide anybody with any warning. It will come one day, brutal and fast, the big one, the long predicted mother of all the earthquakes that will dwarf all the other. How do you think I feel now with my &quot;handy-dandy&quot; emergency kit wondering if the teachers are going to run for their lives or orderly follow the evacuation plans and take care of my kids, first and foremost? Do I still believe that the Police is going to show up quickly to bring back law and order or should I get my own gun, in case officers decide to check out the gambling in Nevada instead? The levees in New Orleans are a joke compared to ours. Emergency services are overwhelmed and understaffed. Planning and training are wishful. California has not achieved protection against the 100 year flood yet, nor against the 200 and 400 year floods; There are also talks about the cyclic tropical storm dubbed &quot;pineapple&quot; express, that hits the snow pack in December with hot rain and sends walls of roaring waters down the main rivers. Thank you New Orleans! I don&apos;t feel good anymore.

The point I am trying to make is very simple: I was innocently assuming that every single person that wears a uniform, or renders a service to the public was trustworthy enough to go beyond and above the call of duty. Maybe I served too long! It looks like our society is started to lose core values like duty, sacrifice, responsibility. Obviously, the 200 cops in New Orleans, the nurses, the runaway mom, or even the complaining soldiers described above, felt that they only had a job; just a job! Does the oath to serve, or the &quot;silent social contract&quot; that supposedly bounds a service provider (teacher, doctor, daycare worker....) to the recipient and the family, mean anything anymore? Maybe the &quot;social&quot; responsibilities that go with these jobs should be attached to the positions in such a way that it would be a punishable crime to avoid them. After all, &quot;quiting&quot; in time of crisis for a sworn Police offcier is similar to desertion in time of war for a soldier.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The mayor of New Orleans is back at work, stressing out is shortsightness and lack of risk appreciation. Sure, mayor, let&apos;s repopulate New Orleans before the levees are completely fixed and strenghtened to categorie 4 hurricane standards. Let&apos;s revisit the events triggered by Katrina with a possible upcoming storm. Let&apos;s finish the job and drown the one that made it out! After all, Ophelia raced by and Rita builds up! It is about time that we show the inept mayor and governor of Lousisiana for what they really are and finally appreciate the efficiency of the heavy federal machinery. Remember, the levees broke in New Orleans! People abandonned the weakest among them behind! Local and state governement, elected officials and agencies failed them while the feds built up and moved in. Not the other way around! An Internet poll ran Sept 20 by AOL showed that after 500.000 votes, Bush performances on Katrina were rated good by 68% while the mayor&apos;s performances were rated poor by 66% of the voters...hmmmm! I wonder why?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Culture of fear and victimism.

Katrina stressed out what is wrong with our society. We are kept in a permanent state of fear fueled by agenda driven politicians from all sides, special interest groups such as the pharmaceutical industry, and media and lawyers that promote a status of defenseless but entitled victims. People in the Southern states had ample warning of the oncoming hurricane and were told to leave. City officials in New Orleans failed to provide transportation, security or food to the one who decided to stay. State officials, in denial, failed to implement good contingency plans (if any) and cope with a long predicted catastrophe. The junk media created and fueled anger and divisive racial issues while inventing a casualty count in the tens of thousand and a possible surge of West Nile virus and other viral epidemics. The weapons of mass deception (WMD) are still being used now that all the shortcomings and the lies have been exposed and the whole thing is still affecting the public, nationwide and internationally.

In fact, Katrina has been directly responsible for less than a thousand deaths and major physical destructions in three states. New Orleans, the focus of the media and the heart of the racial issue, has fallen victims of inadequate flood protections and levees collapse. The flooding of New Orleans was already a well-documented disaster waiting to happen before Katrina&apos;s extra water rushed against frail and aging levees that were surrounding low-income housing. Still the blame game from irresponsible and unaccountable officials and organizations goes on because, at the end of the day, nobody wants to be held responsible for what has happened. But what really happened?A major hurricane, like many before, hit states that are prone to hurricanes but decided to maintain their long lasting &quot;head in the sand&quot; policy hoping that this time, like many times before, the storm will just go away... Florida, as an example, goes through them 4 to 5 times a year without a fuss, looting, pan handling, blame gaming or any Katrina-like media attention. Ample warning was provided and people asked to leave. Some decided to stay despite the odds, a fair choice almost everywhere but in New Orleans where the old levees gave up. City officials from New Orleans loudly blamed FEMA to hide their own shortcomings while refusing to give food and water to the refugees in the Superdome, or to use school buses for evacuations. State officials in Louisiana went around screaming at upper echelons for more buses while rows of neatly parked unused school buses were being flooded in New Orleans.  They complained because FEMA was not there quickly enough and now complain because FEMA over estimated the needs and is &quot;wasting&quot; big sums of needed money in unused trucks or shelters. Can FEMA win? The National Guard, in Louisiana again, failed to alert all its members and to protect its own vehicles from the rising waters. Law enforcement agencies, encore in Louisiana, failed to hold some sort of cohesion during the crisis, and to protect the people from various despicable crimes, a real disgrace for the nation.  New Orleans police officers fled the scene in patrol cars or were caught looting on TV. Hospitals, nursing home and neighbors or families failed to help and evacuate the most vulnerable among them: the elderly and the ill. The media, endorsed race as an issue, largely backed up by the voices of African American leaders, hinting that low income blacks were left to die in the path of the storm and that federal help was voluntarily delayed by some racist calculations. Soon, to confirm racism, number are going to show that 90% of the victims were minorities, conveniently omitting that African Americans make the fabric of these states. Income became the other issue and the media and politicians were quick to point out the low income and rampant poverty of the victims...after having ignored these conditions for decades! Still, 11,5% of the low income from New Orleans is white and nobody has really stood for them yet. The mayor of New Orleans, maybe through Voodoo, was able to make up a casualty count of 10.000 and more, figure rapidly echoed by irresponsible national and international media for about a week.... until official count barely climbed to the thousands and casualties became a non issue.2 days in the after-storm and 6 feet in water, citizen reporters (a new concept.... no wonder the press is so bad!) started to convey their limited perception of the situation, to report multitude of floating corpses, to describe despair and abandon, and tell horrible tales of non assistance or compassionate murder. The media and politicians, again, provided a large forum to these testimonies and following their partisan agenda, quickly put all the blame on the slow response of the federal entities. After all, if the &quot;ambulance chasers&quot; and &quot;jackals&quot; of the media were able to immediately bring us live the horror stories of the destroyed areas, there was no excuse for the US governmental agencies not to be there. But again, it might be easier to report live mayhem, chaos, or a fire, than to actually try to put an end to it!The media and the public figures (whatever it means, people like Oprah!) focused mainly on New Orleans. The city was actually victim of its failing levees, bad flood control, and failing services, but it displayed many unique exciting features other places did not have despite more serious damages from Katrina. The looting, the murders, the rapes, the snipers, the arson, the misery of the overcrowded &quot;Superdome&quot;, the race and income issues were more &quot;marketable&quot; for the ten o clock news than flattened but evacuated cities of Mississippi.Unable to bring upon us the fear of SARS or Mad Cow Disease, Bin Laden or the flu pandemics, and betrayed by a low casualty count, the media had to resort to the threat of a West Nile Virus outburst, the hovering calamity of cholera, the unavoidable plague that would be soon followed by fire from the sky, locusts and millions of deaths. Actually, the only thing the media do to sell is to instill fear and make us happy to be anywhere else but where they are spinning live events.

The list could go on but the main point is that when people are scared and &quot;victimized&quot; (turned into victims), they look up for higher &quot;entities&quot; to protect them, take care of their every need, pamper them and reassure them. We live in a society were personal responsibility gave way to victimization and entitlement. The fear that is daily instilled in us by our elected officials and media apparatus has long convinced us that we are in danger (conservative conspiracy, loss of our freedoms, Sars, Mad cow, TB, West Nile, Asbestos, global warming, terrorism, war with North Korea, sex predators, drive by shooting, fire from the sky, locusts....). Superficial instant spinned news, agenda driven media, politicians, and celebrities, shocking images, and horrific testimonies keep us in this state of dependency, of lethargic acceptance of whatever our &quot;leadership&quot; and &quot;opinion makers&quot; spoon feed us. Gone is the critical thinking! Gone is logic! We now assume that somebody else is in charge of standing for us, and if it does not work to our liking, that this somebody owes us tons of love, care and money.

Today, the same people that refused to evacuate Katrina&apos;s path, cry racism, complain that they were abandoned and hold their hands out. Should not they take a low profile, pick up a bucket and do some work to deserve what is given to them?  Are they victims, people who are harmed by or made to suffer from an act, circumstance, agency, or condition (victims of war) or are they their own victims: persons who suffers injury, loss, or death as a result of a voluntary undertaking? 

Anyways! Who cares anymore? 3 weeks later, the whole thing totally deflated, fell out of the front pages while the drooling media switched to a promising &quot;Ophelia&quot;. In the meantime, close to a thousand death later, a Katrina-desensitized America is also closing the doors after having been kept on the edge for to long. After all, how much of this roller coaster and over inflated real time spinned &quot;reality&quot; news can one handle!

Next, please!

The Bee was so right:&quot;this is a national disgrace!&quot;. People were warned in advance about Katrina , and were told to leave. Some decided to stay and to top it, afterwards, there was looting, assault, shooting, arson, rapes and sniper fire at rescuers. We want to know why &quot;this debacle happened&quot;! But bringing &quot;race issue to fore&quot; is both irresponsible and divisive. Not all the low income are African Americans; not all the low income stayed; not all the low income had no choice and none of it is a conspiracy. Of the poor in New Orleans, 11.5 percent are white! Where are they in the media ?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Most certainly, post Katrina investigations are going to expose the inadequacies of the Mayors of New Orleans and the incompetence of the Governors of Louisiana and their administrations. Law enforcement agencies, growth planning, building permits, levees, emergency services, contingency planning and National guard units fall under their responsibilities.Katrina was far from being a surprise storm and people in the stricken states got plenty of warning. The first emergency responders are supposed to be provided by the states while the heavy federal machinery kicks in and takes over. What really happened there? What do you think would happen to California if tomorrow, god forbid, a surprise major earthquake was to hit? Is denial and lack of responsibilities a new official trend?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                 From unknown source of a chain-email: Funny Californian maths! 


Last week I purchased a burger at Burger King for $3.58. The counter girl took my $4.00 and I was digging for my change when I pulled 8 cents from my pocket and gave it to her. She stood there, holding the nickel and 3 pennies, while looking at the screen on her register I sensed her discomfort and tried to tell her to just give me two quarters, but she hailed the manager for help. While he tried to explain the transaction to her, she stood there and cried.

Why do I tell you this? Because of the evolution in teaching math since the 1950s:

Teaching Math In 1950:
A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is 4/5 of the price. What is his profit?
Teaching Math In 1960:
A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is 4/5 of the price or $80.What is his profit?
Teaching Math In 1970:
A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is $80. Did he make a profit?
Teaching Math In 1980:
A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is $80 and his profit is $20. Your assignment: Underline the number 20.
Teaching Math In 1990:
A logger cuts down a beautiful forest because he is selfish and inconsiderate and cares nothing for the habitat of animals or the preservation of our woodlands. He does this so he can make a profit of $20. What do you think of this way of making a living? Topic for class participation after answering the question: How did the birds and squirrels feel as the logger cut down their homes? (There are no wrong answers.)
Teaching Math In 2005:
Un hachero vende una carretada de madera para $100. El costo de la produccisn es $80. Cuantes tortillas se puede comprar?

The Bee was so right:&quot;this is a national disgrace!&quot;. There was looting, assault, shooting, arson, rapes and sniper fire at rescuers. We want to know why &quot;this debacle happened&quot;, bringing indeed &quot;race issue to fore&quot; like in the multiple L.A. riots, or famous New York blackout. How come looting and violence never happen in any other Gulf state regularly hit by hurricanes, and where whole cities are literally abandonned to the fury of the elements? Is race a factor as stated by irresponsible Bee writers that promote the stupid idea that poor blacks were voluntarily left on the path of the storm and that help was voluntarily delayed? This attitude is also a divisive &quot;national disgrace&quot;, but as long as it is an issue for the media and black leaders who conveniently omit to condemn the many crimes, bring it on! 11.5% of the New Orleans poor are white! What is their excuse for having evacuated , not comitting crimes, not crying for help, not blaming the whole world, and not getting ready for the lawyers and the well deserved reparations? Where are they in the media? As far as intervention delays go, just remember that about only 30% of the Louisiana National Guard is in Iraq, and the rest, regular citizens, were also victim of the storm and hard to regroup As far as out of state help goes, it was paralyzed by the same 20 foot floods that prevented evacuations. Finally, when all these people made it and disturbed the local flourishing criminal activities, they were shot at! Maybe it is time there to stop the whinning, show some spirit, organize post 9-11 New York like &quot;bucket brigades&quot; and start cleaning the mess!

“At the end of the day, only the winners get to write the history books, even when the loser complains that the means to achieve victory were not fair”
The French that were shooting German soldiers in the back or blowing up trains were labeled as terrorists and shot when caught. The same applied to the irregular units of merciless Russian partisans creating havoc in German supply lines. History eventually made them heroes!
The French so called“colonial”war for Algeria, pit together in an ugly urban warfare seasoned paratroopers with clear orders to clean up the slums of Algiers against“freedom fighters”adept to terror, used to bomb restaurants, murder occidentals,“French friendly”Algerians or soldiers. A political defeat erased from the books the“military”victory of the paratroopers, and the FLN fighters became the iconic heroes depicted in the post war propaganda movie so often quoted in America:“The battle of Algiers”. 
It is all a matter of perspective, and again, the winner will finally get to impose his translation of the facts to posterity.
Is there any real difference between the French paratroopers that were mandated by their government to destroy the terrorist cells of Algiers and end terrorism, the American GIs ordered to secure Iraq, or the Russian soldier fighting Chechen rebels? Weren’t the Talibans the good guys when they were fighting the Russians, before they became these nihilist zealots while fighting America? What are the common points, if any, between a Vietminh or Vietcong soldier booby trapping a trail, a French partisan blowing up a railroad, a FLN fighter bombing a restaurant, a Hamas suicide bomber slaughtering Israeli bus riders, or an international Jihadist detonating a roadside bomb in Baghdad?
We all agree that the tactics currently used by the terrorists to fight this war, on the battlefield or at home, are cowardly, gruesome and against every single word written in the Geneva Convention. But why should they care? As international and borderless fighters, they never signed it anyways and don’t have to live by it. At the same time, they officially deny themselves the“humanitarian”protection of the Convention by not respecting the“laws of war”it defines clearly. Again, why would they care when they know already that in our highly sensitive and soft-bellied democracies, voices will raise to provide them with everything they deny their victims: compassion, respect, humanity, application of the laws, legal counsel and forgiveness. Is it fair? Who care! Winning is the only goal, isn’t it?
Finally, we can also agree that these despicable tactics have been used throughout history, again and again, used by the David of the world fighting the Goliath of the world! We don’t have to like it, but we cannot deny it! It is just written in other words, presented in a nicer way in the history books of the winners, that’s it!

The world battle against the“Jihadists”started in Afghanistan with the US blessing and is growing with new recruits from Muslim communities across the world, fighters becoming seasoned terrorists in the battlefields of Chechnya, Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Malaysia…Furthermore, the use of cost effective and simple IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) has proven to be highly effective and disruptive against US or Russian forces. Whether we like it or not, this ruthless and merciless enemy is the one we are fighting today. Whether we like it or not, because they are ruthless and not bound to any international treaty or“laws of war”, they will keep on using that traditional warfare of the weak toward the strong. Whether we like it or not, they will always have the upper hand on the battlefield because it is always easier to cheat and trick, to destroy and scare, than to build and“play fair”.

In France, the military is nicknamed“the great silent one”. If the elected people that sent our troops in harm’s way cannot stand for them at home, maybe it is just about time for the military to stand up for itself and advertise its good deeds and achievements. One needs to have a will to win a battle, to win a war. Our military is strong and willing enough to do that. But modern“political correctness”and the fact that politicians are not willing to win it might seal the fate of our war in Iraq and weaken our international standings. Just think of how many potential“hostile”countries are currently watching and learning.

The laws of war are simple and the Geneva Convention, that so many quote without reading, is pretty clear when defining a combatant and the protection he is expected to enjoy from the treaty. Lately, it has been waved around a lot, but most likely by people with an agenda WILLINGLY depriving the public from the real facts and our troops from a last resort against terrorists. Our forces have to live by it everyday, as close as possible to its real intent when, obviously, the enemy is not respecting it and should not even fall under its protection…Should we protect them anyways or treat them like the war criminals they are? Does the enemy deserve any mercy and can our forces win without taking the warfare to their level? Would you rather be a“rebel”prisoner of US forces or a US citizen prisoner of the“rebels”?


Judge for yourself: Art. 3.of the Convention defines the status of prisoner of war and states that they“shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, color, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria”and prohibits“violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture, taking of hostages, outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples”; Article 4 clearly defines the conditions needed to acquire the status of prisoner of war protected by the international law and state that “Prisoners of war, in the sense of the Convention, are persons belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the power of the enemy:
1. Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.
2. Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfill the following conditions:
(a) That of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
(b) That of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance ;
(c) That of carrying arms openly ;
(d) That of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.” 

Obviously, to please the public opinions of the Western Democracies and its people, America has decided to fight with its hands tied to its back. Would have Americans won World War 2 with such a backboneless mentality?

The Nigerian type scam letters have been sent to almost everybody connected to the Internet since they first appeared half a decade ago, but only a limited few fell for them. They are scam, and they are spam too! The originators are conducting illegal business from foreign countries and should be prosecuted, and an end put to their enterprise. But domestically, the very few recipients who willingly try to engage in the proposed illicit transactions should also be prosecuted for attempting to launder money and evade taxes. I have no pity for the so-called victims! Greed drove them to take the bait, conduct illegal transactions and lose it all! Why should our legal system try to recover their lost money? These people proved by their illegal actions that they would launder drug or terrorist money for a quick buck!

School exit exams!

I hate numbers and partisanship...

The recent article from our local main source of news forgot important data, thus preventing a reader to form the whole &quot;exit exam&quot; picture. At the end of the day, it is all about the almighty dollar and helping out the &quot;minorities&quot; and low income families, giving away free diplomas, or rewarding work?


eDnial! Some people cannot learn or will not learn and instead of focusing on the failures, we should reward those many, the vast majority, who stood up to their personal challenges and overcame their difficulties. More than just racial (Asians always omitted when education goes! I wonder what is their excuse for success?) and economics, the challenges are at home! The parents (2 in a stable relationship????) are responsible to take their kids to school, ensure that they stay there, help the teachers enforce discipline, monitor and help with the homework, provide some sort of example, take the &quot;learning challenged&quot; kids out of the traditional system for a vocational school! My kids were born abroad, caught up with English and are now cruising for the GATES program. Nothing to do with money! I am not giving any to the school nor paying tutors. My wife and I both work and BOTH dedicate plenty of time at home toward the homework and as much as possible in the classrooms (when we can) ! A little Game Boy or TV and a lot of reading or &quot;research&quot;; pages of alphabet to practice cursives, a multiplication table every day...Do we want to do that on top of the cubicles, shopping, cooking...? No! Do we do it? Yes...After all, they are our kids and education is critical. I guess we understand it!
Are the teachers in &quot;defavorised districts&quot; paid less? Are the schools getting less funding? Are they vandalized because of less fundings or because students don&apos;t care about them? Is the exam culturally and socially indifferent? Is it too hard? (Actually, I asked around about how tough the exam was, and the most common answer was &quot;fifth grade level&quot;!!!).

I quote:
&quot;Pass rates varied greatly between the district&apos;s two comprehensive high schools. At Folsom High, 98 percent of the class of 2006 has passed both sections of the exam. Just 12 students are starting their senior year without having already passed.&quot;

 What is the % of minorities (Asians included, please?) who passed at Folsom? 

 What is their excuse for passing? 

 What is the % of minority that failed? That passed? 

&quot;But at Cordova High, only 73 percent of incoming seniors have passed both sections. On that campus, 104 students are starting their final school year uncertain if they will graduate. &quot;

 What is the % of Asians in the 73% that passed? 

 What is the % by race of the 104 &quot;failures&quot;? Any Caucasians or Asians? 

 104 failed....what is the excuse for the 73% that passed: are &quot;low income&quot; and race a factor too? 

 Do the schools and teachers get less money per student in Rancho than in Folsom? 

&quot;The schools differ demographically - Cordova has a greater number of low-income, English-learning and minority students than Folsom - highlighting a major debate over the exit exam.&quot;

 What is the % of &quot;English learning&quot;, low income and minority students that PASSED (Asians too please)? 

 What has personal income to do with the schools? Do Folsomites have tutors and private classes or do they enjoy the regular 30 kid per prefab room where parents get to volunteer to help the teachers? No public library in &quot;defavorised districts&quot;? 

 How many of the family units of the failed students have cell phones, cable TV, PS2 and Game boys? How many watch discovery channel or National Geographics? 

African American students in the class of 2006 statewide, 75 percent have passed math and 82 percent have passed English. Among Latino students, 81 percent have passed each the math and English sections.&quot;

 Statewide, how did the Asians and the Caucasian fare? 

 How many African Americans and Latinos failed in good scoring school districts?

The state Justice Department cafeteria exhibit is not public art but provocation. Art is defined as &quot;human works of beauty&quot; involving a &quot;high quality of conception or execution.&quot; Virgin Mary in dung, crucifix in urine, America flushed in the toilet must be &quot;liber-art.&quot; And what would Freud make of that scatology?
An artist is commonly considered as &quot;One, such as a painter, who is able by virtue of imagination and talent to create works of aesthetic value.&quot; My 6-year-old son draws better toilet bowls.
Lawyers, not society, have imposed on the public (the community or the people as a whole) &quot;very large boundaries&quot; that blur the common sense limits of decency, morals, freedom, right or wrong. Is &quot;lawyer-driven art&quot; the final nail to the coffin?
But like art, semantics is old fashioned. If the display is an exercise of the First Amendment, I cannot wait so see the pro-military or pro-Christian displays. Unfortunately, the next one will most likely be about &quot;the mind of a terrorist provoked by American Christian values.

A misguided middle Easterner looking Brazilian citizen was unlucky enough to live in a suspect area of London that was actually under police surveillance; he was stupid enough to wear a heavy coat in summer and a backpack in the metro at the height of the terrorist fear; he was misguided enough not to obey police orders to freeze. He got wisely shot many time in the head, the command center of the body that needs to be destroyed in order to prevent any voluntary physical action such as setting an explosive device. Why the outrage? Sure, in a perfect world, blah blah blah! But our world is not perfect and I hope that tomorrow our cops will be as good as the Britons. In the meantime, a piece of advice: always listen to an armed law enforcement agent!

If indeed it was a joke to try to provide African men with condoms, it is also a joke to believe that African women are going to take the time to use a bactericide vaginal cream...The only thing that would ever work against AIDS (or any other illness) back there is to round them up and give them a shot, something they cannot negotiate, sell or trade, a vaccine! Have any of you, good Samaritans, ever been to Africa, in the jungle, conduct sanitary assessments, visit hospitals? Do you really expect poor and uneducated African women and men to do better than the highly educated metrosexual American gay community that is still plagued with an ever increasing number of infections? Get real please.

One could easily compare the San Diego political and economic disaster to what is actually happening to California as a whole. There, we have a city that spent more money than it could afford, betting on projected future revenues and an utopist economic boom. There, we also have politicians dedicated to their careers and dirty money, that believe that the people elected them to cater to special interests. In San Diego, there are also strong unions representing self serving city workers that keep on sweetening their deals, believing somehow that there is more money to tap from the bank accounts of struggling overworked and underpaid taxpayers. Finally, San Diego has also found its charismatic potential savior, not in a Terminator like action figure but in a bare foot surfing queen desperate voters want to put in office, believing that she will somehow defeat corruption. Only in LA - LA land!

Recently, commenting on the possible role of al-Qaida in the bombing in &quot;Londonistan&quot;, Ian Blair said, &quot;Al-Qaida is not an organization. Al-Qaida is a way of working ...&apos;&apos; To hide the scary forest of the Jihad, we came up with the frail tree of Bin Laden and Al-Qaida! The forest is far bigger with dozens of active Jihadist cells around the world, an Hydra, a multi headed monster loosely connected to a &quot;greater cause&quot; that renders our Al Qaida almost irrelevant.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


al-Qaida, the tree that hides the forest!
Since the beginning, our government and media, eager to sell us a quantifiable threat on which to apply their &quot;metrics&apos;, have directly or not linked Al-Qaida to every terrorist attack on the planet. But is there an Al-Qaida, a &quot;base&quot; besides the core of the Mujaheedins fighting the Russians in Afghanistan? Somewhere, down the line, America created Al-Qaida, the terrorist group, to design an enemy every body could measure. If Al-Qaida has a history or a defined hierarchy similar to all the known terrorist groups, it has not been shared yet, and embarrassing stories and contradictions from top level officials prove the point. To hide the scary forest of the Jihad, the world wide war against Zionists and crusaders, that &quot;international Muslim fighters&quot; started to wage against the Russians in the late seventies, we came up with the frail tree of Bin Laden and Al-Qaida! The forest is far bigger with dozens of active Jihadist cells around the world, similar to the one that took responsibility for the despicable bombing in Londonistan. No, the enemy is not as quantifiable as the PLO, IRA or Rote Armee! It is a Hydra, a multi headed monster loosely connected to a &quot;greater cause&quot; that renders Al Qaida almost irrelevant.

I am tired of hearing that obesity is a medical condition for the masses. Obesity has always been the medical physical problem of the few, and the made up genetic excuse for the increasing mass of human looking piles of cottage cheese. The three genes of obesity are lack of eating moderation, lack of excercise and lack of self esteem. Where were all these obese persons twenty years ago? I am old enough to remember the masses of &quot;lean and mean&quot; crowds rushing in the streets across America. I am old enough to remember skinny children practicing sports at school when they were not roaming neighborhood on bikes or playing catch. We indulge ourselves in a life of excess, and blame everybody and everything, genes or pieces of clothing included, for our disturbing appearances. The makers of the Junk food that drips down your chin or your new bading suit do not make you look fat! You just are because you made it happen. Obese people should never get a handicap sticker allowing them to park a couple of crawls from food sources; they should have reserved spots...on the far end of the parking lot!

What is happening to all the vocal groups that used to fill the airwaves and written columns with the end of the world, &quot;green house&quot; effect, raising seas and other global warming? I guess that they are just keeping a low profile now because they are unable to explain why it has been so cold and wet lately, why the lakes and reservoirs are so full, and why satellite studies have shown that the ice crust of Antarctica was steadily increasing, absorbing and freezing the melted glacier waters. Maybe it is time to acknowledge that we have no idea whatsoever on how and why climate have regularly and dramatically changed on earth since the beginning of times. What about blaming the late cold wave, rain, hail and snow storms on &quot;global warming&quot; too? That would be....interesting!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Did anybody notice that within a month, while unemployment runs high and many struggle in the private sector, raises are flowing for legislators (+12%) and law enforcement officers (+25 to 41%)? Did anyone notice that teachers are standing up for more money (California&apos;s teachers had the nation&apos;s highest average salary in 2002-03, at $55,693....and among the worst results anyways), side by side with Caltrans, while correctioal officers are still enjoying their four year 34% raise plan? My wife lost her pension (thank you United) and my job is in jeopardy. Prices of living skyrocketted while salaries dropped for the jobs that are not outsourced in India, and still, our disconnected legislature and arrogant state workers unions believe that we, the taxpayers, are going to take more of these insanities, pay and shut up. Tell you what: the priviledge to live a suburbian life in crazy California is not worth any of it, and Chugwater, Wyoming, sounds pretty appealing to me!

A lot of noise for nothing! Why would anybody in the lucrative internet porn industry want to switch from its common dot com domain name that needs to be individually filtered out by a network administrator trying to prevent porn surfing from a company employee, to a dot XXX domain that is going to be automatically blocked by a firewall? Willingly switching to a generic dot XXX domain does not make any economic sense to the porn industry because &quot;pornographers&quot; know that the Internet Service Providers are going to provide the subscribers with an easy to use one step &quot;.XXX&quot; blocking tool. So, unless they are forced by law to switch, I am telling you, it is not going to happen in the US. Furthermore, even if it is ever passed as a law here, it won&apos;t affect companies hosted in foreign countries. Online porn generates billions and is here to stay, wether we like it or not!

 Pseudo science on emotional issues.   


 When real science is lacking on issues of national interest such as the natural occurrence of asbesto$ and its health effects, it creates a vacuum that politicians, lawyers, insurance companies and special interest groups quickly fill up for electoral purposes, publicity, greed or agenda driven reasons. Our society strives on fear, and the &quot;political - media complex&quot; (referred as the &quot;Complex&quot; as of now in this paper) survives on maintaining that balance of fear that leads us, the masses, to approve more control over our lives. That is why they are in power and that is why we are kept head down in blinders on the raceway.   No newspaper will ever sell based on good news only! No politician will ever be elected by telling you that things are not so bad and that he won&apos;t change much! No environmentalist will earn your money or your vote of confidence by claiming that the ice crust of the Antarctica has been officially growing despite the green house effect and that maybe, nobody really understand what is happening to mother earth. No civil union will get funded by disclosing that the groups or individuals they are standing for have the same opportunities we have but might not seize them! No insurance company will ever let you understand that there are millions of reasons why they won&apos;t pay for the damages they scared you into seeking coverage for. That is the way we are, as a society. As individuals, we might just need to feed on these renewed fears to feel good about ourselves and our lives, for everything around us to come into place and make sense. 


 Puppet masters, strings of fear and puppets!   


 I am not even started yet, and I can feel the masses and the egomaniac opinion makers pointing a shaky finger at me and screaming conspiracy for my taking a shot at legitimate fears! Who am I working for? Who is my master? Who is paying me? What is my agenda?   


 This morning, again, I opened my favorite newspaper (actually the only one left for Northern California) hoping to read that life is not so bad in the Western democracies, that thousands of airplanes landed safely, that some actors stayed married for life, that some role model professional sport players don&apos;t do steroids, that SARS and chicken flu are under control in Asia, that love songs can be &quot;rapped&quot;…you know, the complete opposite of what we want and get as a &quot;tabloidic&quot;- junk news society! And here it was, on the first page, something I completely forgot about for its relative scientific and statistical irrelevance, the wake up call about the West Nile Virus. Sure enough, it is mosquito time with the perfect combination of heat and high waters! But instead of reminding the readers that commuting to work or recreational activities have killed and will keep on killing hundred of thousands every year, the article skillfully avoided statistics on past human casualties to focus on numbers of phone calls to the virus hot line and reported dead birds. Who care! That stupid virus killed what? Three dozens people last year, nationwide? Should I really worry about it or would it be wiser to check what is in my tap water, what is in my food or how much chlorine is in my spa? This is a typical example of the vacuum of fear being filled by the media, stand up preachers of the modern age. We want to read and hear that we are going to die, maybe because we are afraid of it, when actually born for it. Everyday, our politicians, lawyers, insurance companies or media apparatus come up with a new scarecrow: terrorism, bio terrorism, nuclear winter, nuclear holocaust, earthquake, flood, tornado, hurricane, west Nile virus, SARS, Ebola, AIDS, locusts, fire from the sky, green house effect, tsunamis, polluted waters, cigarettes, junk food, outdoor air, indoor air, too much sport, not enough exercises, too much wine, not enough, asbesto$... Am I dead yet?  


 Did I say asbesto$? El Dorado hills?   


 Asbesto$ is the new hype for the &quot;Complex&quot;. In 1978, it was lead poi$oning. The motto that is still deeply engraved in our brain was that lead based paint was killing our children and that we needed to do something about it, like strip the old paint and repaint our houses. I wonder who profited from the fear of our kids actually licking the walls. Sure enough, after about 12 years of expensive remediation, the number of American kids with elevated blood lead level dropped to 434,000 from 3 to 4 millions. The &quot;Complex&quot; claimed victory, carefully hiding the billions of profit it made, altogether with the fact that in the meantime, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its Federal partners, successfully reduced the main contamination causes, that is to say lead in gasoline, drinking waters, industrial air pollution, foods and most of the consumer products (see EPA website).   


 Leaking underground gas station tank$ quickly became the new moneymakers after Lead. Do you remember the (at least) 400.000 leaking tank$ across the nation that were threatening our water supplies and might cause miscarriages, birth defects, early cancer, alien abductions and the end of the world? By 1998, they were almost all compliant to the new Federal rules and we all felt good about it despite billions spent on that particular insignificant tip of the pollution iceberg. Our underground water is still being polluted by industrial spillages and raw sewages, and is still not drinkable as is anymore. What happened? Do we feel good because 400,000 gas stations were put to compliance to new expensive standards while pesticides, mercury, industrial pollution, uncontrolled spillages and other major polluters are still not reined in? I guess it was an OK thing.... and it made the &quot;Complex&quot; richer and happier!   


 Mold$ became the new century&apos;s bad boys. It is crawling in our houses or offices and making us sick. It gives asthma and allergies to our kids. It is going to kill us.... or so we believe. Again, industries, helped by lawyers and insurance companies, started to scream their battle cry, quickly echoed by politicians: &quot;remediation!&quot; Workers in space suits and moon boots showed up in the &quot;contaminated&quot; houses and plastic tarps were quickly stapled all over for containment! New laws were put in place and mold controls made mandatory. Still neither science, nor statistics...just space suit level fear for a long-term moneymaker! How many people actually died from mold related illness? How many kids? Who care! Builders continue to erect houses at high speed, using wood that is not even dried yet and materials known to release dangerous chemical pollutants indoor (see recent Californian State report on indoor air pollution). Furthermore, from October to May, new houses get regularly drenched by heavy rains, and the wetness just gets dry-walled in and trapped for the next generation of mold$ to grow and be &quot;remediated&quot; later. But who are we to judge? Our houses are getting safer aren&apos;t they?   


 Asbesto$ is the new space suit fear hype. In El Dorado and Placer counties, California, suburbia is mushrooming, and huge natural veins of asbesto$ are being unearthed and pulverized in the name of suburban expansion. Pseudo science promoted by fear selling media, remediation companies, politicians seeking a battle horse, and environmentalists are clashing with developers and homeowners afraid to see the prices of their expensive houses drop. The whole thing is of course being done at the expense of the soccer moms worried for their children, moms and kids they all claim to be concerned about. The EPA has even recently been dragged into the debate to reassure the panicking crowds and promise Federal legislation. Again, the battle cry is &quot;remediation&quot; and the science and statistics are out of sight.   Sure enough, asbesto$ is not good. We know it! Or do we? A mere 10.000 people nation wide (and rising?) die every year of asbesto$ related cancer (Mesothelioma- numbers from Census bureau). Are they victims of natural occurrence of raw asbesto$ released in the air or, knowing that it takes 20 to 30 years for asbesto$ cancer to show, are they merely the victims of the pre-legislated exposure in the quarries, construction sites and shipyards of the seventies? Industrialized countries have intensively used asbesto$ fibers for fireproofing, insulation, building materials, road construction, car parts (brake pads...) until health studies and environmental impacts led to workplace and usage regulations. 


 The use of asbesto$ is regulated, the quarries are all closed and our supplies come from third world countries nobody cares about! Maybe, just maybe, it makes sense to believe that the past generations of people that are now falling victims of their reckless exposure to the deadly fibers should get some kind of attention and reparations. But as far as science goes, there is nothing showing that &quot;natural occurrence&quot; of disturbed asbesto$ can cause cancer (EPA). Old studies on lethality related to exposure showed that indeed, people working days after days in quarries, crushing the rocks to extract the fibers and bagging them were put at risk and account for most of the casualties. Second hand asbesto$ exposure, from dust brought home by the workers or from other decaying asbesto$ based materials (insulation, fireproofing, construction....) have also been documented as the cause of a great number of asbesto$ cancers. At the same time, the opposite is true and some of the workers exposed to first or second hand asbesto$ never developed cancer (EPA). How much needs to be breathed in to put somebody at risk? Is there a difference of risk between natural asbesto$ and processed fibers? Is irregular short outdoor exposure to asbesto$ fibers as bad as permanent in-situ indoor exposure to &quot;refined&quot; fibers? Once a vein has been covered with houses or a park, does it put an end to the risk and is dust control sufficient to protect citizens during constructions? What kind of exposure (how much for how long) are we talking about? If the EPA does not know and if it will takes decades of studies to figure it out, what should we do? Panic?   


 I was born and raised in a place now known as &quot;the village of the damned&quot; by the French remediation &quot;Complex&quot;. The Northern part of the tiny Mediterranean island of Corsica housed the second biggest open-air asbesto$ quarry of Europe until 1965. The whole mountain is asbesto$, serpentine, and its name has always been the &quot;white point&quot; (for its white exposed parts). Since the beginning of times, this friable mountain has been exposed to the weather and the incessant assault of the sea. Since the beginning of time, the fibers, sometimes as thick as a thumb, have been exposed by the elements to the people, the cattle and other food sources of the area. In the 1900, industrial exploitation started and it peaked in the fifties. A huge cloud of dust was the permanent feature of that mountain being blow to pieces while the processed rocks, called &quot;sterile&quot;, were dumped in the sea after the main fibers were extracted. The whole coastline changed with time and the &quot;sterile&quot; rocks created all the grey popular &quot;sand”beaches that are still a feature of about 20 kilometers of the coastline. Even today, when a storm hits, the rocks are rubbed again each other by the raging seas, and the released fibers turn the coastline waters milky white. Sure enough, after the quarry was closed and new scientific knowledge exposed the risks of asbesto$, the local &quot;Complex&quot; took over and pseudo science was used to generate fear, anger, concern, lawsuits, and generate business. Suddenly, my birthplace became famous: Canari it is, &quot;the village of the damned&quot;!   


 Interestingly enough, out of the 1431 workers that worked there between 1949 and 1965, 601 were located, 160 of them dead. Among the dead, 38 died from various cancers, 20 from some kind of bronchial related cancer and only one was found to have died from asbesto$ cancer (French social security figures). In the village, thank you for asking, 70 is still a young age to die and the cemetery shows a long history of very senior citizens, despite the air and food source (from cattle to fishes) being exposed to natural or industrial occurrence of asbesto$. My own dad is 73, and God bless him, is pretty healthy, thank you for asking. The funny thing about him is that he came all the way from France to work 10 years in the quarry. He met my mom there and they have three healthy boys that grew up fishing, swimming and scuba diving these seas, sun tanning on these &quot;sterile&quot; beaches, and enjoying all the food raised, poached, hunted, grown, brewed or fished on these (dangerous?) hills. That is not science but facts! In the meantime, the &quot;Complex&quot; is still trying to cash in and the latest proposal is to truck over dirt from the mainland and cover the whole mountain...just follow the money!   


 When a debate becomes emotional, when greed shows its ugly face, when everybody and anybody jump in the bandwagon for YOUR good, that is when you need to pay attention and be careful. I am not trying to downplay the issues, and yes, I do believe our word is better with less Lead, less leaking tank$, less airborne mold$, less asbesto$. But in the meantime, one must wonder if the &quot;major&quot; media issues are really the one we should be concerned about. Maybe the tree is still hiding the forest and the scarecrows the good-doers often brandish might also hide greater and more immediate dangers.   You are afraid of inhaling asbesto$, and rightfully so! But do you know what is the percentage of asbesto$ among all the other harmful indoor or outdoor pollutants we breathe in 24/7?   Maybe you just don&apos;t want to know!

When I look back at the American history, for events worth remembering and celebrating one way or another, May 5th (Cinco di Mayo) does not even make the list.Just consider, to name a few, May 7th (1915) and the tragedy of the Lusitania that caused America to enter WW1, or May 8th, V Day Europe, the end of WW2! About 115000 US servicemen and women died in the first world war, and 300000 during the second. But we just forgot that our present has been defined by our past and the people have chosen marguaritas over the sacrifice of their grand parents and parents. Let just open the borders and get done with this nonsense, because our definition of what America is and should be does not measure up to what our ancestors believed. For the kick of it, I polled a couple of GED level teenagers about &quot;Lusitania&quot; and why America should remember May 8, 1945. Most of the tentative answers located &quot;Lusitania&apos; somewhere in Eastern Europe and offered the landing in Normandy on May 8th. No wonder that there is not such a thing as an American Department of culture!

After skillfully enticing United Airlines unions to convince employees to give up benefits in two successive rounds of concessions in order to protect their pensions, (salary, vacations, medical, training pay), United executives went on anyway to shift responsibility for its underfunded pension plans to the already ailing government pension agency, while giving themselves huge raises and retaining bonuses for doing such a good job at saving the bankrupt company money.
Now they are going after the &quot;old&quot; contracts for the coup de grace. Of course, beforehand, Glenn Tilton and his sidekicks made sure that their pensions and golden parachutes were nicely secured through Enron-like gimmicks and they now stand unharmed, laughing their way to the banks. What a shame!
They opened a Pandora box and Delta, American and GM, to name a few big ones, are certainly going to follow in, dragging the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. into insolvency for many more people not even related to the industry. Another American tale in the making!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Cinco di Mayo is coming and we should embrace illegals and legals all the same! It cost me $3000, a trip to the capital city of my country, and a physical examination by a doctor appointed by the US Embassy to make sure that I was not going to be a medical burden for America. I had to show transcripts of my diplomas, prove I had some money set aside, and my wife had to commit to supporting me in case I would not make it. I went through all that process and all I got was a lousy Alien registration card with my name misspelled on it. But I AM PROUD OF IT! If America were my homeland, I would join any Californian citizen association to secure its borders....but why should I care if you, the native, the free and the braves, don&apos;t care! You want Homeland security and open borders! You don&apos;t want to drill Alaska but you want to preserve your gas guzzlers! You want to protect your trees but you want your wooden house in suburbia! You want free medical but you open the country to TB and other &quot;exotic&quot; stuff! You want safe streets without police chases! You let your teen-aged daughter look like a tramp but you sue for sexual harassment! In the word oxymoron, one can find &quot;oxy&quot;, from the Greek &quot;sharp&quot;, and &quot;moros&quot; for foolish! Are we a bunch of Moros?

 April 21, 2005, a Bulgarian MI 8 Russian made helicopter was shot down by a rocket propelled grenade, killing all in board but a crew member that was later executed by the terrorist group on scene.
The video of the low flying white chopper is a fresh reminder of Cambodia in 2002. The 22.000 strong multinational force of the United Nations Temporary Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) mandated by the 1991 Paris agreements was heavily relying on aircrafts to fulfill its mandate and military airplanes and helicopters were teaming up with civilian companies to provide the scattered UN forces and outposts with the much needed logistical support that the local bad road conditions prevented.
US made light helicopters from Canada were criss-crossing the heavy Cambodian skies along with old Russian made transport choppers owned by some Eastern European company, a couple of Malaysian Sikorsky, Australian Blackhawk and French Puma.
Cambodia was a well-armed country with many feuding legitimate (or not) political factions taking pot shots with anything they had in their inventory at whatever took for the skies. Early on, during the preparatory missions, rotary aircrafts would come back from“discovery”missions with bullet holes and shrapnel scars. Low flying missions over hostile territory were quickly cancelled to avoid starting a casualty count and new Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) were put in place.
From that day on, helicopters were to take off vertically and quickly reach a safe altitude (above small arm and RPG range), fly to the destination, circle it high while ensuring with the local ground forces that the area was secure, and finally plummet down, elevator like, to the landing site. Furthermore, Canadian Kiowa were equipped with a Kevlar seat skirted with a ballistic“blanket”the pilots had to wrap around their sides, and French anti mine“carpets”started to appear on the floors of other machines. The Malaysian Sikorsky was not sea-worthy anymore due to the added armor fitted during Malaysian’s own counter-insurgency operations and the Australians would always man and arm their weapons upon take off. The combination of these passive and active measures was proven to be a success and the only helicopters eventually lost to the Cambodian jungle and sea were a couple of Mi 8 that actually“went mechanical.”. One has to remember that the fleet of battle scared Russian MIs contracted by the UN at that time, had been retired from the Chechen battlefield and showed their wear…along with their flip-flopping, shorts wearing pilots.
Anyways, what was eventually proven to be a success was subsequently extended to the fleet of fixed wing aircrafts whose crews and passengers rediscovered the joys of the stomach turning combat take off and landing, that is to say the sharp vertical climb or dive from or to a dirt airstrip cut in the jungle.
One can have its own opinion on the UN efficiency but what was witnessed in Phnom Penh was a typical trial by error discovery operation that quickly ended up with the implementation of procedures that efficiently corrected the early mistakes.

It just took a couple of months of learning for most of the vital UN air transportation to be finally secured and that was one of the great success everybody there was to enjoy at one time or another because UNTAC was so dependent on its air forces.
George Santayana rightly stated,“Those that forget the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them”.
Here we are again, twelve years after the disaster in Somalia, about two years into the Iraqi conflict, and after half a dozen of downed helicopters, wondering why such a mistake would be repeated at the cost of more lives.
It is the job of combat helicopter to fly low and slow, search and destroy, attract and return fire. They are designed for combat and sport armored bodies and windows. Should a soft-skinned transport helicopter flying over hostile territory be unnecessarily exposed to the short range of an anti tank RPG or a small caliber assault rifle?
The answer is obvious: not after two years into a counter insurgency conflict!
On the one hand, RPG are optically aimed short range portable anti-tank missiles sporting a shaped charge designed to explode on impact. They are designed for ambush style close combat in canalized environments and against slow moving armored targets. They are not wire, optically or heat-guided and have not tracking or locking system to guarantee a successful hit. That is what anti-tank or anti-aircraft missiles do.
RPG are also cheap, light, and simple to use and are readily available in mass quantities all over the world, thus making them a weapon of choice for highly mobile small armed groups of insurgents.
On the other hand, aircrafts, both rotary and fixed winged, should get their protections from high altitude and speed.
Exposing non-specialized ground support aircrafts to the potential lethality of a RPG is definitely a tactical mistake one has to get ready to pay a high price for.

What was reminded to us the hard way in Mogadishu, during what was considered as the most violent US military battle since the Vietnam war, should have been engraved in stone, written as permanent a SOP in all the field manuals (FM) of our armed forces: in operational areas, soft skinned ground or air vectors should never be committed within the range of common RPG!

According to the Goldwater institute, enrollment of four-year-olds in early education programs has increased from 16 to 66 percent since 1965. Concurrently, the drop out rate has also regularly increased, to reach 30% in our Californian schools today. What is really going on? If one listens to Marjie Lundstrom, as she states in her editorial &quot;Real advocates for kids step up for universal preschool&quot;, and according to a recent Rand report that is being waved as a battle flag by newly energized Democrats, the fact that 4 y-o toddlers cannot attend preschool for free is a major factor contributing to our failure to retain students. Face it! Ninth graders and above are the one leaving our schools , and despite a huge increase in funding (from $5.500 per student in 84 to $9.000 in 2002) it looks like our children are not getting any smarter. But free preschool should fix K12 problems!If that was true, and not politically far stretched, one would have to ask what are the real reason for California&apos;s bad ranking behind other states that don&apos;t have universal preschool? After all, Georgia and Oklahoma are the only states of the Union to offer it nationwide and figures don&apos;t even show a drastic improvement of their overall performances. Furthermore, similar programs are being developed in Florida, Massachusetts, New York and West Virginia but it does not mean that they are going to be adopted and it still leaves a question standing: why are so many states faring better than us without resorting to that expensive &quot;magic bullet&quot; (almost all of them) ?When Californian schools used to report drop out numbers without any oversight, the numbers were kept incredibly low to preserve a misleading image of education quality! Interestingly enough, since independent agencies started to dissect the performances of our schools, the picture suddenly got a lot grimier!.Go figure!What we know for sure is that we are spending more money per student. We also know that we are ranking next to the last despite having passed more than $35 billion in state bonds for school facilities between 98 and 2002. We spent $10 billion from 96 to 2003 (and failed) to reduce the class sizes to 20 despite studies showing no relations between achievement and class size. We remember that for the year 2001-2002 California ranked first among all states in teacher salary with an average of $53.810, and we are all very confident that they were able to preserve and improve what was granted to them. We are also aware that for one teacher in the field, our Californian school system has almost one non teacher on pay roll (2001: 298.000 vs.. 241.000) and that a little more than 10% hold &quot;emergency&quot; credentials only. This is what we know about! This is education out here, in la-la land! It might be time now to stop throwing money at a broken machine. Our school system is definitely broken and needs a major overhaul, not a political gimmick that is going to give the Democrats their voice back. After all, the future of our children should be more important than an electoral, demagogic and populist  speech aiming at opening the doors of preschool to the poor at the expense of the wealthy. If that was a viable solution, I would gladly adopt it. Unfortunately, a quick research shows that the problems of our educational system are other than the lack of a free universal daycare and that political correctness and sensitiveness rein us from addressing them. Some parents are culturally more inclined in taking an active attitude toward the education of their children than other! Furthermore, indeed, far too many children start on the wrong track, with English as a second language, because the melting pot has been broken and replaced by cultural diversity! Finally, no one can force a self entitled spoiled tattooed body pierced wise cracker loser to seat tight in a classroom when he/she could make a quick buck in the street (and teachers don&apos;t want them anyways).But who am I to judge? More students enrolled for free in a broken system sustained by the wealthy and managed by our state would mean even more money for the school system and more power to its union! &quot;To me, this is not political,&quot; said David Gordon, Sacramento County superintendent of schools. &quot;This is a smart thing to do in terms of using money wisely.&quot; Yeaaah, sure! That would be a first, Mr Gordon

Terri Schiavo: let us rephrase it in a realistic manner: should we, as a society, legalize starvation to death as a mean for euthanasia? Would you write on your living will that starvation to death is your preferred method to be put out of your misery if tomorow, God forbid, you end up in a &quot;vegetative state&quot;? Just remember that we all are in a temporary healthy state and that any of us can at anytime end up like poor Terri! What is wrong with you people?

Lucky her! She found a cooked finger in Wendy&apos;s chili and will sue for reparations because she cannot sleep, threw up once, and might never have chili again. She is certainly going to be a millionaire soon! Isn&apos;t it weird that if the finger had belonged to a legitimate worker that lost it in a freak workplace accident, that worker, if insured, would only get like $50 a week for the new handicap, versus millions in a lawsuit for the finder...


The first lesson: it is better to find a finger than to lose one!


The second lesson: I have to drop Wendy&apos;s from my list because they are going to thoroughly screen their food source from now on, and I must rest all my hopes to find the body parts that will make me rich on Carls, Mc Donalds, KFC or the fat headed guy&apos;s place.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Let set politics, bipartisanship, religion or lack of it aside for a moment and take a look at what we are allowing to happen in 2005 America: a woman is being legally starved to death because her husband does not want to transfer his legal &quot;ownership&quot; to her familly! In a country were animals or vicious criminals are &quot;put to sleep&quot; in a quick painless way, we are allowing &quot;starvation to death&quot; to be engraved on our wall of shame. I guess it is not the kind of &quot;unusual and cruel punishment&quot; that rocks the human rights activists boat. Terri Schiavo is not the bed ridden vegetables described by many; she is your average hopelessly retarded kid or your alzheimer patient. Look around you folks! She is there, opened eyed with a smile on her mouth, loved by the one who care for her. To her parents, like to so many around us, these eyes and this smile are worth millions. Does our society starves to death brain damaged children or patients on life support? Does our society starves to death animals? Does our society allow me to shoot my dog when I don&apos;t want it anymore or does it force me to put it out for adoption? What are we becoming? At least have the guts to order a lethal injection!

To beat Bob &quot;Meathead&quot; Reiner, Bill Lockyer and Steve Westly to the starting line, state Treasurer Phil Angelides announced that he will run against Arnold &quot;elitist&quot; Schwartzenegger…in 20 months! Isn’t it interesting to see that the person who has been handling the finances of our state since 1998, does not even take any responsibility for the state of our budget and is arrogant enough to consider getting the governor’s seat? Who cares anyways? The important piece of information is that the race for governor is on and we are going to get swamped by negative ads and speeches. Didn’t we just go through that?
California, a state of déjàvu, where elections come every other day that is not taken by the Gay marriage issue, fund raising, Scott Peterson, illegal immigration, the Maloofs, driving licenses for illegal immigrants, the Kings, Caltrans, Michael Jackson, CalPERS, demonstrations for peace, former Congressman Condit, demonstration against globalization, Teacher-prison guard-firemen-CHP-state worker unions lobbyism, Janet Jackson, Indian casinos, blah, blah, blah. Boring!

When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer! They definitely have more power than we, the PEOPLE, when we exercise our Constitutional right to vote...Over and over again, we, the PEOPLE, are asked to express ourselves by a vote. We, the People, go out of our way and vote. Over and over again, whatever the outcome is, judges and lawyers declare that the results of the legal vote we, the People, have cast, is inconstitutional. Over and over again, the same issues come to the ballot and we, the People, have to re-vote or re-re-vote on it.....


Insanity is when one keeps on doing the same exact thing hoping to get a different result!

I cannot believe that Michael Jackson and steroids create more buzz than Iraq, the Korean and Iranian nukes or the upcoming cold war with China! I am so glad our congress decided to spend its time and enrgy in cleaning up American athletes. Do we really care? I only use the sports section of my newspaper to wrap my bacon when I microwave it! What about you?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Should we group anti-war displays with Nazi and Klan parades? Is it the responsibility of the People to police the government in actions of war! 


I just think that the First should not protect anything that incite violence or hatred or break the laws, ie. disrupting of traffic, rioting setting cars on fire, throwing projectiles at law enforcement units, damaging properties, disrupting peace....


The First Amendment stipulates the right to peacefully assemble to state your case. Provoking a dialogue through offensive material or violence is not, I am sure, what was supposed to be protected. If one wants to strike or complain, one is free to do so or assemble peacefully with another, with signs and banners that make sense without disturbing anybody: passer-bys or grandpa taking a nap! That is the soap box concept: take it to a park, stand on it and express your ideas...if I want to listen: I&apos;ll stop.


The responsibility of the people is indeed to police the government at all times, not to create havoc. Hanging the effigy of a soldier from you windows is as offensive to me as hanging the effigy of a black person or a woman... it is indeed protected but will eventually create disorder because it is offensive to the people targeted by the effigy and the people who support them. The Pearcy, in Sacramento, knew it. Furthermore they are hypocritical because they do it on their weekend home and not at their primary residence: way to go!


A simple peace sign would convey the same message, wouldn&apos;t it? Going the extra step is irresponsible and being protected for it does not make any sense! They went the extra step and now are afraid of the consequences: to easy! If tomorow, God forbid, a distraught soldier on leave was to come and torch the house, I would feel sorry for is going to jail for a couple of morons....not for them. What about my renting the house across yours and hanging a huge fake bloody dog by a hook with a neon banner stating: I love animals...they taste good. Every single day and night you would have to look at it + the candle vigil of PETA, + the media trucks...All that while I&apos;d be sitting happy in my permanent residence while enjoying the show on TV! How would you like the First, than?

Again, one&apos;s freedom stops when it infringes in someone else&apos;s!

If the liberal agenda promotes abortion, Euthanasia and the abolition of the death penalty, than I guess I am definitely not one.
 How can one be pro-life for the scum of our society, pro-death for fetuses and pro-euthanasia at the same time?
 Ooooooops….sorry! let’s rephrase it in politically correct English because it is far less offending:
 How can anyone want to spare murderers from unusual and cruel punishment while promoting pro-choice and assisted suicide?
 Sounds better, right?
This whole suicidal thought process sounds like a death wish to me, but who am I to judge?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Khmer rouges blew up century old temples and religious idols of the prestigious past of their ancestors, sold statues and slaughtered the priests.
The Taliban blew up century old giant Buddha and imposed their ruthless religious tyranny.
American extreme liberals want to blow up the Ten Commandments our founding fathers veneered, chisel our first ever written laws out of governmental buildings.
This is extremism at work: illiterate self righteous arrogant psychos imposing their twisted views of liberty and happiness on the masses. What are they afraid of?
Our &quot;Talibans&quot; even despise life and rabidly promote euthanasia and abortion while defending the civil rights of the scum of our society. Does any of this make any sense at all ? I am completely …lost!

According to our local newspaper, drugs, poverty and poor access to healthcare are responsible for doubling the HIV infection rate of the African Americans. I thought that AIDS was mostly contracted by promiscuous people doing drugs or having unprotected sex, and I now know that not doing any of the above is the best way to avoid the infection... Races, sex, religion, wealth, the car you drive, the place you live in or the dog you walk have nothing to do with AIDS. So here it is folks: keep your pants up and if you really cannot resist your urges, get a condom! Am I also missing something or are the other minorities conveniently forgotten in the study despite their sharing the same poverty and poor access to health care?

A 425 pounds tiger roaming suburbia for weeks cannot be a threat taken slightly and the fact that it was finally shot is unfortunate but should not be a tragedy, unless you are a pet lover extremist that tolerates pet shops, declawed cats, debarked dogs,“fixed”pets, large animals in apartments and other abomination to nature. The California Department of Fish and Game, animal control or the police should not be looked upon as the bad guys for not taking a chance at letting such a potential predator get away. The Abby and Emma Hedengran of America should be the one blamed and prosecuted for having“large cats”or other“wild”creatures as pets. The Webster dictionary defines a pet as“a domesticated animal kept for pleasure rather than utility”. Roy (of Siegfried and Roy) can enlighten us on Tiger domestication while we ponder the virtues of keeping about anything for irresponsible pleasures. I’d rather be safe than sorry and would personally destroy on sight and without hesitation any creatures that could pose a threat to my family, rabid poodles included!

Nation and duties vs. individualism and freedom. What a challenge for the U.S. Supreme Court! Should our First Amendment protect an average person applying contemporary community standards and also a content that is not contrary to the commonly agreed upon American values and that preserves the social interest in order in morality?
If the answers to these question seem so obvious, common sense ruling, one should wonder why, as of today, the First Amendment also protects hate leaflets, anti-war displays, hate speech, Nazi and Klan parades, flag and cross burning, dissension, private possession of obscene material, Internet pornography, promotion of pedophilia, offensive and profane speech, hard core lyrics, media smear campaigns and even political parties whose intentions include overthrowing the U.S. government.
The French have a saying that states that one&apos;s freedom stops when it infringes in someone else&apos;s! Isn&apos;t it wise and simple?

How would you feel if I rented the house across the street from you and displayed effigies offensive to YOU? I could have an effigy on woman inferiority, an effigy on white supremacy; I could have a 20 feet flag pole on the front yard next to a camouflaged HUMVEE; I could have huge signs saying“Nuke Iraq; Nuke North Korea; Nuke Iran and Syria”; I could have signs stating that senior citizens should be killed at birth... well, you got the picture!
I could have all these skin crawling things across your driveway on top of the“collateral damages”(demonstrations, riots?) while enjoying suburbia in my other quiet home!
Lawyers Stephen and Virginia Pearcy are cowards seeking attention and stirring people’s emotions to achieve it. They should be be held responsible for whatever violent outcome might come out of the“stunt”they pulled. Instead, they are hiding behind our basic constitutional privileges and must be laughing their stupid arrogant heart out when people are risking jail to put an end to the display. Isn’t it somewhere a law against inciting violence?
I hope one thing: that the demonstrators, from both extremities, will take the“fight”to Berkeley, to the Pearcy’s real home and leave us alone…

We supported the Shah and turned Iran into the leading regional military power that Komeiny’s religious dictatorship inherited.
We switched allegiance to Iraq and armed Saddam to enable him to fight Komeiny and turned Iraq into the leading regional military power.
Saddam broke free from his masters and invaded Kuwait. We mounted a coalition to teach him a lesson while letting Syria get away with taking control of Lebanon in exchange for supporting Gulf War 1. Saddam did not learn and we recently removed him from power with Gulf War 2 after destroying its military forces, thus bringing Iran back to the top.                                Syria is now siding with Iran after having helped Saddam, and suddenly, the whole world is reminded of the poor Lebanon, crushed under Syria’s military.                                            Iran must be taken out next, along with its allies. That is inevitable. That is the circle of geopolitics!. Sorry. Reality check!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


When in trouble, please don&apos;t call 911 anymore! Who knows? Over-armed violent cops might show up and level the neighborhood. They are so famous for hurting &quot;misguided&quot; and innocent citizens, for shooting to death car robbers that try to run them over, for beating up outstanding minority victims, and for using excess of force and discrimination on a daily basis. If our politicians have their way, the pink cruisers of the politically correct and sensitive new law enforcement units will soon give away sermons, roses and food stamps to the innocents-until-proven-guilty crowd. Their tasers are now to dangerous according to some (the crooks?) and I guess mister Mark Leno, D-San, will be the person to call for an arrest requiring something more than the baton, but lesser than a gun.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A recent letter in the our local newspaper untitled &quot;Patriotism upside down&quot; was a live display of arrogance, ignorance, and bias. Arrogance because it claimed that all the people offended by the Pearcy&apos;s display have a military background. Ignorance and bias because it featured some old oxymorons about the military and stated them as fact. Sure, the Pearcys must have alienated some military personel when they displayed their &quot;controversial&quot; military effigy from the window of their weekend home, but they angered mostly people with common sense able to see the rape of our first amendment: inciting violence in Sacramento while hiding in Berkeley, and getting away with it. That by itself should show us that our most basic amendment is &quot;upside down&quot;. Bias and ignorance because the writer obviously have no clue on how the military works and must have gotten information from some anti-military cereal box from the sixties. Self righteous, condescendent, self proclaimed history buff with insider information, the author is an example of what is wrong with the extremists from both sides. Thanks to our Freedom of speech to allow such people to make fools of themselves publicly!

Focusing on gender to explain why ex HP CEO Fiorina was fired is stupid, biased and agenda driven. What about her performances? HP trails IBM and Dell, only making money selling expensive ink for cheap printers, and offering bargain laptops at Costco. What about the 141 millions HP just settled for on a patent infringement lawsuit that reduced the company first 2005 fiscal earnings by 3 cents a share? What about the million dollar salaries, bonuses and perks she got for not reaching company goals? What about the 21 million severance check? Maybe headlines should have read“Over paid failed CEO got Golden parachute!”

Our education system is faring at the lowest (a little above Alabama and Louisiana) and bankrupt school districts are closing schools, increasing the kid to teacher ratio, cutting physical education and arts. Welcome to California, land of the fourth or fifth....or whatever makes you feel good...economy in the world!


One cannot be and have been! Well, guess what? Welcome to the West! It is wild, indeed.


Our state is bankrupt! Our schools are bankrupt! Our institutions are failing us, our legislators are corrupt! and our moral values are twisted. Where do we go from there? A recall? Nope... been there, done that already and it does not work! As far as I remember, we borrowed millions for our budget and for education and the money is still not filling the poop hole we are in, nor is it reaching the schools. According to the Legislative Analyst&apos;s Office, $9,508 will go for every public school student, an increase of $206 from last year. Where does the money really go? Even at the federal level, Education outspends Defense....Let us stop throwing money at a broken system! It is time for a complete overhaul, time to trim out the fat and send all the big butted self important office crabs out in the field, in the class rooms where they are needed. Our kids deserve it, don&apos;t they? After all, haven&apos;t we made sure that they would reimburse the bonds too, twenty years from now?


Tell you what: you are all fired!                        WE, you know, the PEOPLE, are fedup!

United Airlines just got another huge $750 million concession from front line employees while management is securing a bonus plan program that only make sense for them and is predicted to reach $200 millions in 2005. The happy few on the top can &quot;earn&quot; bonuses of up to 40% of their salaries. At the bottom, the &quot;commoners&quot; can secure a 5% bonus for good performances. Glenn Tilton is the Ceo of UAL and earns $712,500. A 40% bonus for getting pay cuts from employees would grant him a $285,000 bonus. Way to go...Enron!

Please, READ the Geneva Convention before talking about it! It defines certain mandatory“rules of war”, and by not complying, terrorists deny themselves its protection. Our senators should distribute it in Fallujah instead of attacking Mr Gonzales. Question: Would you rather be a terrorist prisoner of the American forces or an American prisoner of the Iraqi“freedom fighters”?.

To straighten the house, El Gobernator is forecasting new ballot battles for 2005. When you think about it, voting in California is a full time job! We elect legislators to represent us on local, state or federal issues. We vote directly on the same issues because our representatives cannot make up their minds. We also vote on the“propositions”, the issues legislators won’t deal with. Recently, we even had to vote to remove from office an elected official we overwhelmingly voted in. After we vote, the issues always come back anyways and have to be re-voted on again. Once we are done, non elected lawyers representing non elected parties challenge the votes, their outcome, legitimacy or contents and get them cancelled, redrafted and re-re-voted again. Our representative Democracy has become a direct Democracy turned into a lawyer run dictatorship of the special interest groups. What is the point of voting? Can anybody enlighten me?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2005 has an air of“déjàvu”.“Ahnold”raises more and more funds while the“girlie men”of the legislature sharpen their teeth for bigger bites of special interests. Mister Bustamante primed his own money pump by announcing he would run for insurance commissioner (and give himself a raise if elected, from his $131,250 annually for doing nothing to $140,000). The state budgets and spends (our) tax dollars like there is more where it is coming from and the driver licenses for illegal immigrants and the gay marriage issues are being revisited (didn’t we already vote for that?). Our education system is faring at the lowest (a little above Alabama and Louisiana) and our economy is in a free fall mode. We still have more than $8 billions structural deficit despite the recent endebtment of our children (my name is Bond…) while $14 billions still cross the border to Mexico annually. Our water is tainted with pesticides, our fishes with mercury, our milk with jet fuel, our air is filthy and I am just fed up. One positive thing, though: the tsunami did not hit us!.

Five Indiana PACERS players and five fans were charged and sentenced to wear a pink TUTU at every game of the 2005 season, for fighting in the stands and on the court at the end of a game against the Detroit PISTONS last month. The TUTU will allow viewers, supporters and players to identify quickly the culprits on top of destroying their self esteem. The TUTU thing will be expanded to every Americn sport, WWF and NASCAR included.


 


By the way, if we stop recruiting NBA players within gangs and if we start to desegragate this sport, we might end up with racially balanced teams and less violence on the field. Think about it! Why are we limiting African Americans to rap music and basket ball?...that is segregation! Let us stop it!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Did you thank a vet on December 7th and explained to your kids what happened on that day? My kids were the only one to bring it up to their teachers in their class rooms, and despite aknowledging the event, it was not even shared with the rest of the children by the teachers...Sad!


But what do I care....I am French and so are they!


By the way....I am talking about Pearl Harbor, Stupid!...the day US forces shot down 29 innocent Japanese airplanes....and actually, if they attacked us, it is because they had many reasons to hate us, right?        Whatever!!!!!!!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                           Warum haben wir die zweite weltkrieg verloren? 

Why did we lose World War two! 

 What finally did it was when war President Roosevelt came on the public airwaves in the USA and in Germany during the Battle of the Bulge, and publicly apologized for the swift sentencing to the firing squad of the German spies caught in civilian clothing or US army uniforms and equipment and creating havoc and bringing destruction to the Allied supply lines. That was a shameful un-American act lowering us to the level of the enemy we were fighting.
 The outcry from the German public opinion, that was daily broadcasted by our media on the Home-front, was the cause of that historical moment that was quickly followed by a unilateral withdrawal of our troops from Europe, the signing of a peace treaty with Adolf Hitler and the return to the isolationism that served us well until we were dragged in that murderous conflict in 1941, long after most of Europe was under the Nazi boot. 

 We should have seen it coming earlier, when the Red Cross condemned the internment of Japanese Americans, thus exposing us as the hypocritical nation we were: a so called Democracy at war, fighting a couple of dictatorships while rounding up potential enemies or spies in the name of an outdated concept of National Security.
 We should have seen it coming when our war reporters in the cities of Dresden or Tokyo reported live the inhumane slaughter of thousands of unarmed civilians burning alive under the rain of US incendiary bombs, unveiling military actions that went far beyond the legitimate show of power and diplomatic sanctions that should have followed Pearl Harbor and the loss of the Pacific to the misguided but still humane and forgivable Axis forces. After all, our media and intellectual said it well: weren’t we a little responsible for the anger the assailants had for us?
 We should have seen it coming when a teary Peter Pumpkin, the American favorite anchorman, conducted an emotional interview of Mr A. Hitler in the middle of the leveled city of Berlin. The heart wrenching, and first hand descriptions of what the German people had to endure from Allied forces dedicated to crushing the Fuhrer’s dream of a happy and united Europe of playful blond haired and blue eyed children, was just a Pulitzer sized masterpiece. Finally, thanks to the dedication of our free responsible press sponsored by Goebbels himself, Joe and Jane Doe got to hear it at home, from Adolf’s broken English, and got the sad vision of the shattered German dreams of European happiness and unity from Madrid to Moscow: one land for one people under one enlightened leader….the American dream that could have been true!
 We should have seen it coming when finally the wonderful US concept that“dissention is patriotic”was successfully applied all over America through anti-war and flag burning demonstrations fueled by some politicians and major media.
 We should have seen it coming when our Hollywood icons chained themselves to our tanks, burned their draft cards or went to entertain German Armies, while doing drugs and having the promiscuous superficial lives role models should have.
 We should have seen it coming when on the European and Pacific theatres, the enemy started to accuse our soldiers of standing for our values, fighting too hard for their cause, for their lives, firing their weapons or refusing to give up. Once exposed, these despicable un-American behaviors quickly led to the trial and repatriation of the culprits but the damages were done and the American flag stained forever. 

 Yes ….we should have seen it coming and spared America, the Home of the Brave and the Land of the Free, with the shame of fighting its enemies. Roosevelt understood that salvation was in forgiveness and that a shameful peace was the only alternative to war. 
 May 8 1945 , now celebrated as Bratwurst day, he had lunch in Berlin, signed a peace treaty and hugged Mr Hitler while his wife played piano with Eva Braun. Two months later, he visited Japanese Emperor Hiro-Hito, renounced his imperialistic claims on some meager Pacific possessions, dedicated the Missouri memorial to the Japanese pilot murdered at Pear Harbor and bought a Japanese car.
 The folly of war was over, and Americans could now serenely go back to their pursuit of happiness, knowing that the whereabouts of every single one of its war criminals, former hateful servicemen and women that dared fight bravely the poor Germans and Japanese misguided people, was monitored and that a database of their addresses was easily accessible at the local library.

God Bless America!


NB: Fiction.....???? Think again!

I cannot believe that everybody is falling for the &quot;Blog&quot; frenzy (Web Log). Anybody can start a blog for as low as $10.00 a month for the domain name &quot;stupid_stole_the_elections_again.com&quot; and a pre-posted website ready to host Joe and Jane Doe&apos;s craziest undocumented rumors. Sure enough, some blogs have been credited for uncovering the meaning of life or the origin of god. That is mostly because of the traditional media that have suddenly given a forum to this new &quot;opinion maker&quot;. I run a &quot;blog&quot; and I am amazed at the flow of visitors I get, feeding on stuff I just make up, on opinions. We like to be comforted in our beliefs and the blogs are replacing the discussions people used to have long ago, when they had a social life. A piece of advice for you out there: don&apos;t believe everything you read on the net!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Like the head of the routed Taliban government, Mulah Omar, Yasir Arafat believed in denying its people of any chance for peace, basic freedom and comfort while embezzling billions of dollars, enjoying the most modern commodities, and maintaining his wife’s obscene Parisian lifestyle. He tried by force to make Jordan the new Palestine and lead his people to slaughter and exile. He tried to steal Lebanon and barely escaped the Israeli onslaught. Fatah, Black September and many other were the alternate armed branches of the terrorist Palestinian Liberation Organization that high-jacked, murdered and bombed civilian targets across the world until the infamous US government negotiated deal limiting terrorism to Israel! Nobel prized thanks to convenient short term memory, he became a &quot;legitimate&quot; head of (non existing) state, maybe the only one ever to preach hatred with a holstered gun at the United Nations. His death might be the first real hope of peace for the people he pretended to serve. Hopefully, there is an up there were all the innocent victims of the bombings, high jacking, policy of hatred and other terrorist acts he ordered or covered are going to make his new kingdom....HELL!.


Look up any link on the OLP and you will see that it means TERRORISM! Yasir Arafat was not any saint fighting for a just a cause. He was a self serving tyrant, madman dreaming of a Palestinian state anywhere....as long as he stayed in charge!

After filing for chapter 11 and junking its stock, United Airlines renegotiated its contracts with its unionized employees after stripping them from their company ownership. With the other ailing“legacy”airlines ready to follow suite, and encouraged by the federal government’s apathy, United recently dropped the pensions and switched the company’s retirement financial burden to the taxpayers. Furthermore, the company made new outrageous demands and wants to deprive its remaining core employees from whatever they salvaged from the last round of concessions: vacation time, medical benefits or living wages for its flight attendants (the company’s most numerous category and smallest salary mass). Again, instead of solving the problems and reorganizing the airline to fit the industry’s new profile, obscenely overpaid top execs are trying to extend their exuberant lifestyle by ripping their employees off. One could assume that in America, dedicating a lifetime of hard work should secure a retirement; especially when it is contractual; Not anymore…Next time you will see an executive from United, tell them it is about the American dream, not greed. They are easy to spot up there: they are the only one with a parachute…a golden one!

I am an ALIEN, on a green card, a legal immigrant. I have been here for more than 5 years now, working hard and paying big. I bought a house, own and insured my 4 cars, pay taxes and bills, volunteer some of my time and in return, get no say at all on how the money I pay in taxes is going to be spent . Actually, locally or at state level, a bum from San Fransisco, a professional &quot;sick-leaver&quot;, a social leech or a young improductive punk from UCLA can vote to increase or extend the freebees that I pay part of...and I have no say at all! How fair is that? Maybe voting on financial issues should be limited to the one who eventually pay the bills, the taxpayers. Maybe voting on financial issues should be denied to the one who profit from the gifts and have no interests other than preserving or increasing what they get.


Think about it!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


They wanted anybody but Bush! They let anybody contest for the Democratic party convention and the Democrats nominated anybodies to run against the hated war president. They lost!


Go figure...


Lessons:


1 - The Democrats are disconnected with the American realities. Don&apos;t wake up the middle class conservative America!


2 - Liberal ideas are not really mainstream despite what the media tried to tell us for the past 5 months. 11 states voted overwhelmingly to protect the concept of marriage.


3 - The Clintons are partying. Get ready for Hilary 2008!


4 - Are the White House Arrogants (Cheney, Rumsfeld....) going to consider this &quot;consevative&quot; vote of confidence as a blank check? Hopefully not...


5 - Moore is a moron....he sent its army of cameramen to monitor the elections in Florida when everything happened in Ohio. Aren&apos;t we glad he just reports or twists past events instead of predicting the weather.

Lessons learned from the 2004 Presidential, and from the Californian ballot comedy


Lesson1: Democrats and Liberals are far richer than Republicans.                                         Lesson 2:In order to be elected (or re-elected) with a narrow margin, a very rich candidate needs to pocket (and waste) millions in &quot;contributions&quot; from wealthy individuals or interest groups. Note that both parties call them &quot;bribes&quot; when pocketed by the other.
Lesson 3: According to what voters saw and heard, only crooks run for local, State or Federal offices. What is the police doing?
Lesson 4: According to the price paid by the presidential candidates ($600 millions) and by the supporters of the Californian propositions ($200 millions), only wealthy people can tamper with politics or run for office.
Lesson 5: According to common sense and Lessons 3 and 4 only wealthy crooks enter politics or run for office.
Lesson 6: According to Lesson 5, we know why Election Day is on a Tuesday: Why waste a perfectly good weekend? It is not like we have many left!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Like in 2000, overseas Military ballots are going to be thrown out by the thousands because, again, absentee ballots for the military have been mailed to late (thank you Mr Nader!). Bush won Florida by 350+ votes after a couple of recounts but at the same time, Florida, junked a couple of thousands of military absentee ballots because they were posted too late. Across the nation, every single state did the same...


What a pity! Our troops are actually sheding their blood to protect the Democratic process that prevents them from voting! If they were all minorities or left leaning, I guess it would matter but because most of them are traditionally Republicans, nobody care. But it is OK somehow....California made it legal for them to fax their ballot....and we know that ia fax is a comodity that is largely available to our troops lined up around Fallujah!


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Californian three strike law needs indeed to be fixed: it is not deterrent enough if &quot;professional criminals&quot; are still not afraid of stealing a slice of pizza or lying on a loan application after their second strike. Question to the bleeding heart crowd out there: how many chances, &quot;strikes&quot; should we grant the victims? Wouldn&apos;t it be nicer to pass a law that would give the victims the right to come back before the crime happened and go on with their lives ?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Did anybody notice that afer having tried the Brits, dictatorship, the Russians and the Talibans, Afghanistan finally got a shot at Democracy and held its first ever free and almost peaceful elections?


Did any local female lib movement hailed the fact that for the first time in generations, women were allowed to vote and make their voice count?


Ooooops! Sorry! It has to be a non-event because the Bush administration is kinda, sort of behind that. If I were American, I would be proud of this achievement in the line of past American traditions of liberating countries....but what do I know? I am French! 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Freedom?
My cynical and ironic letters have been published monthly in a local newspaper for
the past 4 years and none ever stirred so much hatred that the one published October 21 (see Californian Foie Gras, 2 letters down!), when I claimed my pride to be an omnivorous being. It did not take nuclear scientists (obviously!) to find my phone number but it took exactly 8 hours and 6 spineless individuals to leave me messages wishing me a painful death from meat indigestion. In the dictatorship of the minorities, that used to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, radicals of all kind are trying to change the way we live, think, believe. They stand for their freedom and are pro-choice as long as it is about farming embryos, dislocating fetuses, assisting suicide or unplugging comatose patients. They believe they are the holder of the &quot;humane&quot; values and are arrogant enough to ignore that their pet is somebody else’s food somewhere else, outside the narrow borders of their utopia. They shave their wild hair, hide their body odors, sit on ceramic toilets and drive cars to forget that they are degenerate animals. They live in suburbia, consume energy, debark their dogs, declaw their cats, and &quot;vasectomize&quot; pets and husbands…if any. They hate themselves and the rest of the world. That thought depressed me so much that I had to play some De Bussy to accompany a celebration Foie Gras that I washed down with a St Emilion. Content, I sat under the big dipper smoking a pipe of Amsterdamer and I quickly dismissed my guilt for the people out there who only had a salad to enjoy.

Guys....French bashing is getting old!


I am so tired of the free French-bashing perpetrated by lazy journalists or editorialists catering to a moronic audience. The straw that broke the camel&apos;s back was laid by Julia Gorin a year ago (is it a French name?) on Foxnews.com. ( http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,92768,00.html  ). Because it is still live and posted, I came to the conclusion that many here haven&apos;t gone over their French thing yet and need help....here it is, finally!


Her whatever it was (letter, editorial, article?), was just a non ending list of out of context junk spinned to fit the ultimate goal, comfort John Doe Stupid in its hatred.


Anybody can bash anybody and it does not take a nuclear scientist to smear (Obviously !). I took Julia&apos;s piece, replaced all the &quot;F&quot; words (dirty word for France!) by &quot;the USA&quot; and basically changed the references to her arguments, the quotes and the spins. I ended up with a nice primal piece of American bashing that any French American hater &quot;a la&quot; Julia Gorin could have written in Paris to cater to its French moronic readers...I hope you are going to be enraged after reading that piece and tell me to go back to my country if I don&apos;t like it here....and rightly so! But two things: first, don&apos;t hate me because I have the choice, speak 4 languages and can go back to France or someplace else. Second, just think how I felt reading the original that was as incendiary and stupid as the bombs we dropped over Dresden. You might not like France&apos;s position and that is your right, but before smearing, get the facts behind it! Come on, more Americans share that position than Frenchmen!


Here is what I attached to the mail I sent back to Fox, thanks to their &quot;respond to the writer&quot; feature:


 Look at me, look at me….I am not a so called journalist but, like FOX, I can also do junk reporting for moronic readers….
Why don’t you guys get a plane ticket and visit France instead of reporting what you wish was true. Are you so bored?
Get yourself a bottle of Bordeaux, a piece of Foie gras, and some Roquefort cheese. Listen to Debussy and watch a Monet. Finish with a cognac and make love to your spouse (147 times a year according to latest release!). Enjoy it…..because tomorrow, you are going to wake up here, in your dysfunctional family, trapped in some traffic jam and sentenced to a veggie burger while watching African American cursing and touching themselves over hate-rap“music” 



 Let&apos;s Pardon the French                                      RE-WRITTEN By Me 


 As many sound and revealing theories as have been proposed over the past year to explain the USA&apos;s confounding geopolitical behavior, they&apos;ve all missed something fundamental. 
The country&apos;s less than Western, less than ally-like stances would have seemed less baffling if we hadn&apos;t started from a wrong premise: Namely, that the USA is a member of the civilized world.                                                                                           Savages naturally gravitate toward savages. And they facilitate savagery everywhere while impeding nations that seek to minimize it.
How else to explain  the USA &apos;s defiant feting and support of brutal leadership, as in Africa , Pakistan , South America and  the Persian Gulf ? Why else would a conservative get beat up for protesting a Californian anti-war rally? Why else would a Californian synagogue be burnt? How else to explain American sympathy for  Islamic rebels in Afghanistan, China or Chechnya as long as they fight US enemies?
 The USA has a natural affinity for the globe&apos;s uncivilized elements. The more primitive, the better to define one&apos;s own deviancy down -- a deviancy that once prompted George F will to say “America is a large, friendly dog in a very small room. Every time it wags its tail, it knocks over a chair”, and Churchill to quote: ” Americans always try to do the right thing -- after they&apos;ve tried everything else.” that believe that &quot;being sensitive&quot; means &quot;moral.&quot;
 “But how does one account for all the charming, elegant French culture -- the art, the wine, the cheese, the language, the pastries -- those qualities that lack in the USA. My uncle, the mayor of a little Corsican town built in the 15th century, answered that question when he invited me to the  Louvres :&quot; They&apos;re low-class. They don’t have museums.&quot;
America is considering culture like jelly….the less you have, the more you spread. Junk culture, fast food culture, is a brilliant cloak for depravity: Don a lofty external disguise of fast paced energetic life to mask a degraded internal character. Anything the American do is considered artful, including inventing the  use of dung to paint the Virgin Mary . Go figure!
The“political correctness”inventors, meanwhile, perpetually pride themselves in having abolished all &quot;insensitiveness&quot; in every aspect of life. But closing an eye on their puppet dictator’s crimes or ignoring the war in Europe for 2 years and hiring Nazi scientists responsible for the rockets or gas chambers was never an issue. After all, they invented the Atomic bomb and mastered the massive incendiary bombings of civilian targets from Tokyo to Dresden!
The US even managed to innovate in animal cruelty. The popular chicken dishes served in the Fast-junk-food joints that they enjoy so much (obesity is spreading in the Cow Boy country), are mechanically force-fed to become soft and fatty. Last July, a top New Orleans restaurant celebrated its International Federation of Competitive Eating won by a fellow that swallowed 44 and 1/2 hot dogs in 12 minutes. .. Its winner reportedly remarked, &quot;If“It’s like a dream, like a celebrity -- right? I’m so happy!”.&quot; 
Of all the contemporary diplomats, dignitaries and official ministers of the world, it was dashing  US State Department Collin Powell  who refused to answer the question if he tried to mislead the world when he had his one man show at the UN and made a good effort at selling the world stale intelligence and made up evidences. Wasn’t him also the publisher of a 600-page book (My American Journey) dripping with words of honor and integrity?
Always on the opposing side of civilization and on the cutting edge of degenerateness, the Americans are pioneers in decadence. Where are the Ten Commandments dragged in the mud? Where is the Catholic Church turned into a paradise for pedophiles? Where are sex predators released in the streets by ambulance chasers? Where is an elected President having sex in his office with an intern? Where is cross-burning and Nazi demonstrations considered as freedom of speech? Where is junk food considered cuisine? Where are 400 years history considered a civilization? Where is education failing so bad that high school student cannot spell Iraq, speak there own language or count how much the next tattoo or piercing is going to cost?…Only in America, that same fat America
No wonder the book that was a 2001 bestseller in the USA ,  The Sexual Life of Catherine M (Grove Press), the true-life memoir of Parisian editor and art critic Catherine Millet who &quot;loves penises,&quot; as the June 2002 review in  Elle Magazine reads.
Consider also the fact that ice skating is the most watched sport in the US and that its leading“cultural”role models from Hollywood are all about sex, rap and drugs, and you’ll get a clear picture of the American sexual deviancy brought by decades of repression that have lead to the regular abduction and molestation of children.
Whenever the American conscience wrestles with the introduction into our society of some risquénew practice, procedure or product -- such as lowering the legal age of consent, partial abortion, embryonic stem cell research, installing condom machines in schools, approving Marijuana or RU-486 and dispensing Ritalin to children -- proponents always reason,“it is my constitutional right….it is about consenting adults….it is my choice”
Why do you think that in the rest of the world, where they speak in soft tones and posture demurely, they bristle when the rude, high-decibel fat arrogant American approaches with a moronic question, and pretend they don&apos;t understand English: Stupidity could be contagious and they don’t want to get it!
During his stay in Sacramento,  columnist Eric Chevreuil witnessed a road rage incident when one car pushed another off the road because fingers were flipped. People are shot all the time in such events according to news reports. Eric was even quoted saying that the event was typical of an American day.

Now we know why America is only famous for its stupidity, oversized women and a four-letter“f”word that sums it up…

Ready for loathing?


I am too poor to be a Democrat and too intimidated to be an“out of the closet”Republican…I have found out the hard way, like others, that too many Liberals are so arrogant and so righteous that they would stop at nothing to plainly neutralize you. After all, aren’t they the self appointed guardians of the real American values, the real sensitive and politically correct demagogic metrosexual ecologic values everybody should stand for…because they do? When they are out to spread the good word to the commoners, the stupid white gun-totting christian red-necks, everything goes, from the abuse of races, genders, sexual preferences and religions, to Intimidation, destruction of property and violent demonstrations! Sometimes, I wish I were a Democrat able to proudly display a Kerry-Edwards sign on my SUV or lawn without fear of my mansion being egged or my hybrid car keyed. Instead, I have to keep my“racist and elitist right wing”views personal and go on with my day…When was it written that our freedom of speech was limited to the politically correct?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Californian foie gras is about to become history if producers don’t come up with a more“humane”way to feed their geese. What is a humane way to treat your food, or an animal? Oh, yes, toys for pigs and music for chickens….I forgot! I am sick and tired of veggie eaters lecturing me on my meat. I can’t wait for the day our technology will enable us to record the scream of a potatoe being boiled alive and for the plant eaters to finally go away. I want my geese to be fat, my rabbit tender, my quail stufffed with raisins, my filet mignon red, my venison marinated, my spare ribs without BBQ sauce, my baby lamb grilled, my chicks broiled, my veal fried, my rooster stewed in wine, my snails in butter, and my horse meat medium rare….I want cold cuts, prosciuto, sausages and ham, pates and terrines, foie gras and blood sausage….I want tripes and tongues, chicken liver and fried lamb brain, raw meat in tomatoe sauce. You might want my food to be your pet, but it is my food anyways, and I want it all, with only a side dish of salad!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Poor Kerry…full of intents but lacking real plans, he looks more and more like a good looking lamb sacrificed on the altar of the Clintonites: . Face it, the only way the Democrats can retake the White House is to have Hilary Clinton run against a new Republican wanabee 4 years from now.

Today, America is so evenly politically divided that the odds are against any uncharismatic outsider trying to beat the current“war president”. Only second class candidates ran for the Democratic Party nomination and Kerry was one of them. Despite a better“stage presence”, he obviously never had what it takes to defeat Bush but his party ignored it to better groom Hilary for the next round. That strategy might fail anyways for three major reasons:the next President is going to rejuvenate and mold the Supreme Court to its party linesHilary won’t be able to use Bill’s“legacy”anymore and will have to make a political name for herself on top of overcoming the“women president”thingThe current thorns in Bush’s records are long term issues that can improve with the test of time (outcome of war, economy….)

Still, a miracle could happen and a clueless Kerry could end up with the mess, no real solutions and promises he cannot keep…

Eventually, history only will tell our children if the Democratic Party actually wished a defeat to better position Hilary and to avoid the challenges of leading a country at war?

Whoever wrote that was quite inspired....thank you! 

ARTICLE I: You do not have the right to a new car, big screen TV, or any other form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally acquire them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.
ARTICLE II: You do not have the right to never be offended. This country is based on freedom, and that means freedom for everyone -- not just you! You may leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion, etc.; but the world is full of idiots, and probably always will be.
ARTICLE III: You do not have the right to be free from harm. If you stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful, do not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives independently wealthy.
ARTICLE IV: You do not have the right to free food and housing. Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and will gladly help anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional couch potatoes.
ARTICLE V: You do not have the right to free health care. That would be nice, but from the looks of public housing, we&apos;re just not interested in public health care.
ARTICLE VI: You do not have the right to physically harm other people. If you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim, or kill someone, don&apos;t be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the electric chair.
ARTICLE VII: You do not have the right to the possessions of others. If you rob, cheat, or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens, don&apos;t be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you still won&apos;t have the right to a big screen color TV or a life of leisure.
ARTICLE VIII: You do not have the right to a job. All of us sure want you to have a job, and will gladly help you along in hard times, but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself useful.
ARTICLE IX: You do not have the right to happiness. Being an American means that you have the right to PURSUE happiness, which by the way, is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an over abundance of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused by the Bill of Rights.
ARTICLE X: This is an English speaking country. We don&apos;t care where you are from, English is our language. Learn it or go back to wherever you came from!
 ARTICLE XI: You do not have the right to change our country&apos;s history or heritage.

War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling, which thinks that nothing is worth war, is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. - John Stuart Mill ~ (1868)

Danger: extreme liberals at work!


When it suits their disruptive purposes, American leftists conveniently forget that there is a common point between our first amendment and the Geneva Convention: one cannot claim the protection of either one when not abiding by their requirements. I don&apos;t think our founding fathers were foreseeing bull-horned hate slogans of dissent from a rag tag hysterical crowd, when they granted us &quot;the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government&quot;. If middle class &quot;conservative&quot; America was too busy working for a living during the Boston non-event, it looks like professional activists of global intolerance and other &quot;paid pony tailed activists for non-profit organizations&quot; owned the streets again, in New York, and showed us what &quot;Democracy in action&quot; really means to the liberals. It is safer to demonstrate for peace there than it is in Sadr city, safer to mock military funerals than to stand for our freedoms, safer to ridicule soldiers and veterans than to contribute to society, safer to provoke cops than to show an example, safer to litter and destroy than to clean and build. All this intolerance and rabid hatred in the name of the first amendment... and more disgusted moderate Democrats switching to a conservative vote in New York!

 Are the Democrats stuck in Vietnam?
It is interesting to see that 4 years after Al Gore tried and failed to use his service in Vietnam against Bush’s“missing”year in the National Guard, John Kerry and the democrats have decided to go down the same risky path and opened a can of worms while avoiding real presidential issues.
Gore served 141 days as a rear echelon reporter and his“protected”service failed to survive the public scrutiny and was quickly dismissed as relevant in 2000. Kerry served 5 months and was awarded medals but the raising controversies about the wounds and his character while on duty and the suddenly“missing”years of anti-war“heroism”of his post-war life will most likely end up hurting him too. So here we are, closer to election day having to choose between Kerry’s heroic 40 days in 69 but 30 missing years of political records and Bush’s 4 past years of presidential records but a missing year in 72. Short of any relevant issues to sell us a“presidentiable”Kerry, maybe the Democrats should stick to Bush and his college drinking habits.

 The First Amendment and free sp eech. 
Since 1641, when Massachusetts first drafted a document including the concepts of freedom of speech and due process, about 120 significant Supreme Court decisions and historical events have reshaped our First Amendment.
Americans have forever disputed what freedom of speech should be and there is not a single day that goes by without our legal system redefining its applications or trying to limit it to the politically correct.
Recently, the war on terrorism and the Patriot Act have been perceived as new attempts by a government to rein free speech in the name of national security while judges across the country have gagged the press or dragged reporters to the bench in a“private vs. public interests”legal shootout. 

It looks like since the independence, the American People has had a hard time with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
·        How should these fundamental texts be interpreted and should they be interpreted at all?
·        Is it all about the context, the intent or the wording?
·        Does any of these 220 years old laws apply to our modern world?
Somehow, it seems like with the passage of time, the ultimate responsibility to answer these recurrent questions has been transferred to lawyers all the way up to our Supreme Court and that“WE”, the People (citizens of a state), have abandoned our democratic“by the people”birth right to a handful of powerful individuals.

When the Declaration of Independence stated our equality, it meant equality regarding to our human laws and not nature’s. When a judge renders justice, thanks to the due process granted to us by the Fourteenth Amendment, he just applies our laws or their most commonly accepted significances forged through jurisprudence.
 Ironically, we are guaranteed our most basic rights by century old imperfect texts open to all kinds of interpretations and challenges. 
·        What should be the criteria to challenge the First amendment?
To answer that question, one might have to go back to the root and figure out what define America as a nation, American as“a people”of this nation and the First Amendment in that context.
Is America a single unique nation perceived as such by the rest of the world because it is composed“of a large community of people of mainly common descent, language, history, etc., usually inhabiting a particular territory and under one government”(Oxford American dictionary) or is it a multi-facetted entity its citizens would selfishly mold to better fit their individuality?
“Nation and duties vs. individualism and freedoms”, what a challenge for the Supreme Court!

Common sense should be re-introduced in the equation and it is maybe time to do some introspection and ask ourselves if our precious little person is really more important than the next door neighbors’or take precedence to the interests of the People, of the Nation.
·        Should our First Amendment protect“an average person applying contemporary community standards”?
·        Should it be about“embracing at the least the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully (and peacefully?) all matters of public interest”?
·        Should it only protect a content that is not contrary to the commonly agreed upon American values and that preserves“the social interest in order in morality”?
·        Should it enforce compliance with“a valid and neutral law of general applicability”fitting the standards held by the majority, while“balancing the competing private and public interests at stake”? 

If the answers to these question seem so obvious, common sense ruling, one should wonder why, as of today, the First amendment also protects hate speech, Nazi and Klan parades, flag and cross burning, dissent, private possession of“obscene”material, Internet pornography, promotion of pedophilia, offensive and profane speech, hard core lyrics, media smear campaigns and even political parties“whose intentions include overthrowing the US government”.
 The French have a saying that states that one’s freedom stops when it infringes in someone else’s! Maybe that is the common sense that we are missing when we challenge our laws and rights.
·        Have we actually gone so far in our individualism that we now truly believe that one person’s rights and freedom can supercede the welfare of the Nation, the rights and freedoms of the People that hold these famous“contemporary community standards”?
Furthermore, according to some Supreme Court decisions, free speech has been given the function (…)“to invite dispute (…) induce a condition of unrest, create dissatisfaction (…) or even stir people to anger”to better serve“uninhibited, robust and wide open”debates on public issues.
·       Does it mean that our rights and freedoms as individual citizens come without DUTIES toward the People?
·       Can one just walk around expressing anything he pleases the way he wants without fearing any kind of challenges in the name of this new self centered approach of debate?
In 1919, Supreme Court Justice Holmes said it all when he wrote that not all speech is protected by the First Amendment, citing the now famous example of falsely crying“fire”in a crowded theater.

A common sense approach based on commonly approved standards and values seems to make more sense when re-writing our laws and freedoms, but that would mean depriving the (precious) individual from its self serving interests and focusing on the group, the majority of the American People of the American Nation that hold the commonly agreed upon American values.
·        After all, are we a Republic by the people and for the people, by the lawyers and for the lawyers or just by me and for me?
I believe President Kennedy showed us the path when he asked us to figure out what we could do for the nation and not what the Nation could do for us.
But what do I know? I am French!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Memories: 


What do Kerry and Gore have in common?


 They both served less than 5 &quot;heroic&quot; months in Vietnam , bash Bush for &quot;hiding&quot; in the National Guard and supported a 2 term draft dodger. The big fuss is about Bush and his &quot;missing&quot; year....what about Kerry&apos;s missing 30 years of American and Vet bashing?


Maybe Jane Fonda can enlighten us?


 





Now Kerry...

 Lesson for a young Democrat: dissent today; join an anti-war movement and drag our servicemen and women in the mud. Run away from your responsibilities or serve 5 months and claim in the name of morals and ethics that the soldier you fought with are animals, the politicians rotten and the enemy victims. Later on you&apos;d be able to join the rank of the rotten and run for president!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A couple of months ago, Kerry ended up winning boring democratic primaries by lack of real competition. The fact that he was the“less worst”of a bunch of has-been and wanabees does not really qualify him for the presidency except in a twisted political logic. Just remember the Kucinich, Sharpton, Dean, Edwards, Clark, Lieberman, Gephardt and Moseley Braun. That was the dull Democratic leadership of 2004, what the Democrats had to choose from. Logically endorsed by default, Kerry is now reinventing himself in order to fit the character of the ideal candidate he is not. The hatred for Bush might propel to the White House a man with questionable political records and a lawyer. Isn’t it scary?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Who is he?


First clue: he is a big bully looking guy acting like a &quot;girlie man&quot; when confronted to unions or tough situations? Second clue: a big strong guy, action hero, turned failed politician like Jesse Ventura....Third clue: he borrowed billions to pay the debts Gov. Davis generated...Fourth clue: his budget is still 3 weeks in the voting...Final clue: when his term ends he might try to &quot;be back&quot;....


The answer is in Kalifuhnia!!!

Sleeping butt-naked on a doorway in San Fransicomeless!


Every year, when I hear reports of the“exposed flesh”of the San Francisco Gay pride parade, I can’t help myself but wondering why the indecent exposure law does not apply and I have this fantasy of challenging it the next day by walking butt-naked through the financial district. I wonder if I would draw applauses or a swarm of police officers. Actually, the same exact reasoning applies to the sleeping on somebody’s doorway and to the defecating on public places…”house challenged persons”(bums?) do it freely….but could I? San Francisco: you now pay 3$ to enter and get to watch twisted values in action. Does anybody there remember that good people have rights too?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Where is my flashlight?


Whether you are white, black, pink or green, if you steal a car, start a high speed police chase that endangers hundreds of people, try to run and resist arrest, you deserve whatever violence that you bring upon yourself. Like in Iraq, our troopers are held to better standards than the murderers. Only law abiding citizen should be allowed to claim protection of the laws, but not here, because it is un-American to loose it when your daily life is to fight crimes in our sewers. In our new twisted world of twisted values, criminals end up with more rights than police officers. Maybe we should put the lawyers in charge of enforcing our laws…and fighting our wars!

&quot;Far in Heights 9-11&quot;


If Mr. Moore were a republican, he would have directed a“documentary”(Skerry Movie?) based on the Democratic candidate for the White house. He would have exposed the foreign contribution monies and emphasized the“flip-flopping”and voting history on major issues. He would have shown interviews of Heinz employees complaining about their jobs moving overseas, staged a re-enactment of the anti Vietnam War meetings and medals dumping paralleled with various testimonies picturing Mr. Kerry as a fame and medal seeker that blew minor scratches out of proportion. The left French elite in Cannes voted against Bush. So will the US. It does not make Moore’s piece a Pulitzer or his radical propaganda a documentary.

A new movie hailed in CA: May 14th, the Latinos are all gone AND WE CRY!!!


How arrogant for the latino community to believe that America would be paralized without its legal and illegal Hispanic workers. As far as I know, cotton was still picked up in the South after slavery was abolished! Modern countries have historically relied on immigration from poor countries to provide for the low paid jobs. Our Hispanics community is similar to the North Africans minority in France or the Turkish in Germany....sorry....reality check! I had a dream once, that all the white non-Hispanics vanished from the United States. Suddenly, America looked just like Mexico with its misery, its Cinco di Mayo, its pollution, its corruption, donkey carts, and a desperate workforce sneaking in Canada for low paid jobs.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I watched the Nick Berg’s murder video that the Political Correctness Office of the US media decided to hide from me, with the full support of the Anger Management Department of the What-Is-Good-For-US agency, and the funding from anti-Bush organizations. We were told that it was showing a“kinda-sorta”trial, that a scream was heard and the head of the victim shown…But actually, it shows animals cold bloodily slaughtering Nick and hacking his head off for long seconds, in a pool of blood…
Yes. The savagery of the act and the screams will haunt me for a long time but certainly not longer than the anger and the hatred I now feel for these beasts.
Remember Pearl, Quattrocchi, Berg, the dragged US bodies in Somalia, the corpses hanging from a bridge in Fallujah and our soldiers executed or blown to pieces by roadside or car bombs. Remember our people jumping to their death from the burning towers. Remember the real face of the enemy before opening your heart; they will put a bullet in it!!!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Geneva Convention has been waved around a lot lately, but most likely by people with an agenda WILLINGLY depriving the public from the real facts: our forces live by it everyday, as close as possible to its real intent when obviously, the enemy is not respecting it and does not even fall under its protection…


 
Judge for yourself:

 Art. 3. 
 (1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely , without any adverse distinction founded on race, color, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.
To this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons:
(a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture ;
(b) taking of hostages ;
(c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment;
(d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.

 Article 4 
A. Prisoners of war , in the sense of the present Convention, are persons belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the power of the enemy:
1. Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.
2. Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfil the following conditions:
(a) That of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
(b) That of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance ;
(c) That of carrying arms [b]openly ;
(d) That of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.

A solution to make everybody happy, save our soldiers, promote our values and love...in Iraq:


What about sending our peace-mongers and heart bleeding crying babies to demonstrate for peace in Iraq...they could chain themselves to a suicide bomber, lay on a roadside bomb or hug an Al Sadr, preach peace and cultural understanding, promote the Geneva convention, abortion, thongs, body piercing, Gay marriage, American idol, affirmative action, fast food and NASCAR, equality for women, peace and love, and show the insurgents the REAL FACE OF AMERICA. In the best scenario, the beheaders would fall in love with your typical &quot;All American&quot; girls and join them for the next Gay Pride in San Francisco. They would be butt-naked and that wouldn&apos;t be an abuse! The worst scenario would provide videos of slaughtered Americans for Al Jazeera! But who care? Not our media…


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 


What is torture?

Is it the treatment provided to our soldiers or nationals in Iraq or Afghanistan, the recorded pictures and videos of gory murders and mutilated bodies so gruesome that our media decided not to report…for our own good? (thanks to the Internet and peer to peer they are available anyways!)
Is it only the bad treatment of a few prisoners by a few psychos in uniform placarded all over by the same media….for our own good?
I want it all! I want to see side by side what was done to our Iraqi prisoners and what they did to their American captives! I want the media to report the cruelty of war…from both sides! Let us decide on what torture is, what abuse is and what is standard conditioning of prisoners.
And as a reminder, the Geneva Convention only protects combatants when they have a known and identified leader, when they carry their weapons openly and when they all wear the same distinctive sign…By choosing to hide in schools, hospitals and holy shrines, by choosing to fight among and behind the civilian population, by choosing the strategy of terror, by not wearing any distinctive signs and by executing prisoners and mutilating bodies, our enemies have chosen not to be protected by that convention.  

America would have fought WW2 like we are fighting modern conflicts, we would be goose stepping around by now…and speaking a foreign language: German!
Do any of you dare to remember how we bombed Germans and Japanese into submission, leveled their cities and landmarks with incendiary bombs, summarily tried, jailed or executed many of them? It never occurred to our elders to let Goebbels broadcast Nazi news in America, to interview Hitler in his bunker, tolerate dissent or let anything or anybody undermine the war and the moral of our troops!

In Vietnam, the war was winnable and by 1975, the communist’s forces were scattered, weakened and inefficient…US forces won all the battles but lost the war…at home!      In Iraq, our forces won the land battle against the standing enemy armies of Saddam and won all the battles fought against the various local militias afterwards but like in the seventies, we are losing that war at home. Ask Mister Kerry….he knows it all: the war, the crimes and the anti-war on the home front.But today, in our twisted world of twisted values, Arab media can freely glorify the &quot;freedom fighters&quot; and display the pictures of dead Americans, each one a small step toward victory against the &quot;great Satan&quot; ( http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/gulfwar2/us-military.htm  ) while at home, American death and suffering are absent from the news except for the body count...How can we win a war without involving the people, without fueling anger against the enemy and cultivating patriotism?

Did anybody ever teach us never to pick a fight one is not willing to finish?                      
In Iraq, our troops are fighting, with their hands tied by the media, the polls, the public opinion, the international community, our democratic and Christian values, international laws, treaties and conventions we signed. Our troops are targets to the most coward form of terrorism, slaughtered and maimed one at a time by car bombs, roadside bombs, so called“freedom killers”sniping them in the back. Powerless, they do keep track of the body count and resent the indecision of our leaders stuck in an election year. They see first hand the gruesome reality of the war fought by ruthless enemies, thousand of miles away from our politically correct dreamland. We are expecting so much from them and so little from the opposing forces that the whole thing is turning into a sad joke, another drama. Did we send them to verify again theories on human attrition in war and its domestic effects or to wipe out the enemies of democracy?

Each time a GI is blown to pieces on“Roadside bomb alley”or killed by a sniper hiding in a school in Iraq, domestic support to the war, the administration and the president slides down a couple of points.
Each time civilian hostages are taken and gorily executed, or when car bombs destroy the headquarters of some local agency trying to rebuild Iraq, domestic and international support inches down.
Each time a powerless coalition soldier is murdered and or mutilated, anger and revolt grows among his peers in uniform, stuck there far too long, at the mercy of wavering poll driven politicians elected by media controlled suburbanites.
Each time a powerless coalition soldier is murdered and or mutilated without any decisive action taken from the leadership to put an end to the current politically correct status quo, anger and revolt grows among other soldiers that feel abandoned.
Each time a powerless coalition soldier is murdered and or mutilated there, anger and revolt spreads and revenge is sought.
Each time anger, revolt and revenge fill the hearts of soldiers,“collateral damages”follow.

Do you want to know what torture is?                                                                  Torture is to get up every day to drive a truck of supply along“Roadside bomb alley”after having seen first end what nails, rocks and metallic shrapnels do to an unprotected human body.
Torture is to get up every day to go on foot patrol and expect any civilian to pull out a gun from under its robe and shoot you in the face.
Torture is to see the daily enemy’s lack of respect for human life, lack of respect for his own people that he uses as a shield or kill for propaganda.
Torture and pain is to restore power and water, resume oil production, open a school or build a bridge and see it blown to pieces by the obscurantist the next day.
Torture is to get up every day and be shot at from a hospital, a school or a Mosque and not be able to return fire while your comrades are spilling their blood in the gutters.
Torture is to get up every day knowing that if captured you will be denied any kind of mercy and that even your dead body will be used for psychological effect, returned as pulp or hung from a bridge for the blood thirsty media.
Torture is to remember the faces of the 750 dead and the blood of the 4100 wounded or maimed comrades in arms you accompanied for their last trip home, most of them hit “when military vehicle hit an improvised explosive device…”, as the Pentagon officially reports it.
Torture is to realize that most of the wounded average 25 years old and many among them are left brain-damaged or blind, or both, from shrapnel and dirt blown to the face by roadside bombs, the“improvised explosive devices”that hit the only vital area not protected by body armor.
Torture is to come back home on short leave and watch biased home media echoing enemy propaganda, or listen to well fed, safe and comfy fellow Americans and elected official question the war the elected government sent you to wage.
Torture is to see heroes like Pat Tillman depicted as morons on MSNBC.
Torture is to be called a“baby killer”, to see Al -Jazeera news and biased hatred broadcasted home, to see the same people that accompanied our soldiers to the carriers, waving flags, cheering and all, now turning their back with disgust, burning the flag or marching for peace.                                                                                  Torture is what all theses contradictory feelings, all that fear, pain, sorrow and anger do to our soldiers back there; it is what keeps them awake and accompany them daily for 365 days. A female US doctor in Iraq was quoted saying: &quot;I go to sleep and dream about them (-the young American casualties-) all night long, awaking in a sweat because something is wrong,&quot;                                                                                     Welcome back to Vietnam and remember the German saying:“Children, enjoy war because peace will be terrifying!”

Do you have any idea of what goes in the mind of our average GI Joe, our good US kid that went on a mission, to protect us?
I know that it is not a place I would like to visit right now!

Illogic logic of war...


The situation in Iraq is getting nastier everyday and one must now wonder if that kind of war will ever be winnable by a democracy that is neuterized by its domestic or international laws, led by a struggling leader running for re-election, misinformed by its media and heavily dependant on suggestive polls.

What a pitiful picture reopening old wounds! Israel would have said to hell with that and sought and killed the murderous obscurantist clerics in the shrines of Iraq or plainly traded the complete surrender of the nihilists for the safeguard of the monuments. The winner always gets to write history and bailing out of Iraq would be equal to losing.

We are stuck in the logic of war and Iraq will indeed be another Vietnam if our government and people fail our brave troops. We have no other choice but to stand firm and win that thing for the sake of our future as a free nation.

State 4 sale!


When it is about easy money and quick fixes to the budget deficit to avoid the necessary painful solutions that are trulty needed, California seems to be pretty inventive. Blackmailing the Indian casinos to pay 25% of their revenues or see the Californian card rooms and racetracks operate their own slot machines in exchange of one third of their income reversed in the Sheriff&apos;s coffers, is the latest outrageous offer sponsored by an aging porn guru and Mister Blanas. After the bonds, here comes intimidation! Next on line could be to threaten churches to &quot;contribute&quot; to the state&apos;s finances in order to prevent the legalization of prostitution. The Russian mob could also be convinced to &quot;help&quot; out financially to prevent harassment from the police...The Golden state is still for sale and anything shamelessly goes when it is about contributions and special interests. Money has no odor and elected officials no shame!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The new pledge: 


I am on my way to the Supreme Court to propose the new pledge that will fit modern Americans, that would fit all; here it is:


I kind of agree with (pledge allegiance)  the amendable constitution (to the flag) of the United States of America and to the dictature of the minorities (republic) for which it tries to stand(s): one multicultural and sensitive nation under lawyers  (God), diverisified (indivisible), with the liberty to sue and reparations (justice) for all.


Support that new pledge and the new flag that goes along with it:


 
the motto: asinus asinum fricat 





Thank you for your time and attention.

 Are you guys DEAF?..... OOOOPS....sorry, for those many among you who are truth challenged, I actually meant Hearing impaired!


 MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH: the following findings are XXXX rated and suppose the audience is aware of the word &quot;onanism&quot;. Parental discretion strongly advised.


For a long time it has been believed and claimed that Onanism was a very bad and destructive vice detectable through signs of loss of hearing, loss of memory, loss of virility, loss of cheerfulness and loss of progeny.


When we look at our politicians, lawyers and &quot;civil liberties defense groups (indulged in &quot;civil disobedience * &quot;), we can tell that what is commonly held as true for onanism might also be true for &quot;intelectual onanism&quot;, that is to say the art of abusing a major organ (the brain in that case) to end up with wasted resources and energy but a huge and brief sense of achievement. Julius Ceasar once said in his commentaries:&quot;To the lonely it is company; to the forsaken it is a friend; to the aged and to the impotent it is a benefactor. They that are penniless (replace penniless by Brainless for the sake of my argument!)are yet rich, in that they still have this majestic diversion.&quot; 


Our Metrosexual (loss of virility) professionals (loss of cheerfulness) of the political and judicial arcanes of the Capitol are on daily basis showing us that they are unable to do their job (pass a law or enforce it: loss of progeny). Furthermore, they do suffer from short term memory (loss of memory), love diversions and are obviously deaf to what the people want and vote for (loss of hearing).


About it, Solomon said, &quot;There is nothing to recommend it but its cheapness.&quot; Maybe that is why &quot;intelectual onanism&quot; is so widely practiced in Kalifuhnia!


Here it is... not only TB has made a come back but &quot;intelectual onanism&quot; is ravaging the rank of our legislature right before our eyes!


nota: civil disobedience is to liberals what crime is to crooks....the difference is that liberals don&apos;t get to go to jail and are honored for breaking the laws!


 April fool&apos;s day....that was a fake medical report, OK! don&apos;t go around believing everything you read on the Internet!!!  :-) 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                              
The light that investigators are shedding on the criminal bombing that occurred Thursday March 11, 2004 in the capital of Spain, is exposing the limitations of the Emergency Services (ES) when faced with a major unexpected war-like event that has instantly killed 200 and seriously wounded 1400.



 The facts: 
10 bombs remotely detonated by cell phones simultaneously exploded in commuter trains (some being double-deckers) and in the major train stations of Madrid. The four locations where the devices were detonated were packed with travelers at the height of the commuting time, between 7.30 and 7.45am. Furthermore, the French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; reported that 3 extra bombs that were found unexploded, were set to explode later, indicating that the terrorists might have planned a delayed explosion to disrupt the work of the ES teams and law enforcement agencies and to resume chaos. The toll of this typical act of terrorism amounted to 1600 casualties suffering from simple shock to major war like traumas, severe burns or death. 
 The crime scene: 
Collapsed or gutted trains, debris falling, smoke, blood, bodies and body parts everywhere (some found on the roof of the train station), shocked victims wandering around or trying to go home, panic on scene and spreading out, traffic jams, &quot;over&quot; accidents…that were the scenes of the geographically spread out explosions ES and law enforcement agencies were trying to locate in the mist of panicked, incomplete and contradictory reports that were flooding the emergency phone lines. Apocalypse can be a cheap thing to create! 
 The first steps:
 While law enforcement agencies and the military cordoned the whole downtown area (it is commute time!), and tried to open streets to emergency vehicles and set communications, Crime Scene Investigation units, bomb squads and emergency teams reached the different sites and started to secure the bombed areas and to take over the firefighting and the medical aid from the good Samaritans.
Buses were used as first aid stations or, along with taxis, as ambulances to ferry the casualties to the nearest hospitals that were quickly overwhelmed and started to beg for blood donors. Eventually, casualties were than evacuated further away in suburban hospitals. Casualties were transported in blankets for lack of stretchers or simply tended were they laid and left there without supervision by outnumbered and overwhelmed medical staff. Good Samaritans, again, volunteered and provided first aid, donated blood on the spot, provided needed psychological comfort or herded shocked patients.
 Finally organized: 
Communication, access to the scene and coordination between agencies finally improved and the military quickly activated two field hospitals on site while the casualties (most of them still evacuated in cabs and buses) were better dispatched to hospitals. Bodies and body parts were now beginning to be hand picked, recovered (&quot;we did not know what to pick up!&quot;) while the investigation began. Wounds and trauma:
Most of the dead were grossly dismembered and burned. The serious casualties were suffering from war-like traumas (massive hemorrhages, missing limbs, opened wounds, and severe burns) and many other were in shock, apathetic or hyperactive. Many &apos;unharmed&quot; passengers needed psychological comfort to cope with the vision and the experience.  
 ES Crews: 
ES crews had a hard time reaching the different explosion sites (traffic jams, confusing reports and information) and most of the first aid, triage and &quot;intelligence&quot; were provided by on site &quot;good samaritans&quot;.
3 unexploded bombs were voluntarily or accidentally set up to explode later and might have hurt the ES and add to the panic and disruption, a typical tactic aiming at disorganizing the logistics of the enemy. Furthermore, according to rescue workers, some ES teams were &quot;at loss&quot; and completely unprepared for the carnage they discovered, carnage remotely connected to their daily &quot;workflow&quot; of car accidents or strokes.
  Logistics: 
Access and communications were critical aspects of the medical operation. Madrid is an old city with narrow streets and 4 lane boulevards daily clogged by unruly and noisy traffic. The spreading news of the attack brought that traffic to a halt, traffic that law enforcement agencies had to reopen. For lack of preset communication procedures or radio equipment, cabs and buses loaded with casualties were wandering around trying to reach the same hospital, that is to say the closest while dispatchers were trying to &quot;rein&quot; down ES vehicle and organize traffic and evacuations. Hospital near by quickly reached their limits and blood reserves were far too insufficient. The military came in later than it could or should have.  
      


             Lessons learned: (I am sure there are more…but let us start somewhere!) 


 
 Awareness and training:
 ·the good Samaritans played the most important part of this operation: first aid, calm and &quot;intelligence&apos; gathering: train more First Aid / CPR, inform, and educate citizens
·First Aid / CPR training should automatically involve dealing with basic gory-graphic war-like trauma and war-like first aid (pack hanging guts in wet clothe, tourniquet on any amputated or compressed but not visible limb, manual compression on any kind of wound, mouth to &quot;gaping hole&quot; resuscitation, dealing with major burns….)
·ES crews can also be targeted by terrorists (delay fused bombs): train the crews on tactics and &quot;weapons&quot; used by terrorists. Keep them informed on the evolution of the threat.
·Buses and cabs: should be at least trained to switch to a certain radio channel if involved in transporting casualties. Guidance and hospital information could be provided to them instantly.
·Control the crowds and command help from bystanders.
·Inter agency training: civilian ES should know how the military works and vice versa. That mutual knowledge would unable the first one on site to facilitate and speed the arrival and install of the other 
 Nota: 
1. In Germany, it is mandatory to have an approved first aid kit in every car, along with insurance and registration. It is a blessing for qualified First aid volunteers because they can easily access enough first aid equipment to efficiently treat casualties while waiting for ambulances.
2. Basic first aid training could also be part of the driver&apos;s license education and tests. If one is given the power to possibly hurt someone, shouldn&apos;t it be given the responsibility to help out under the protection of the good Samaritan law and in view of the motto &quot;any help is better than none&quot;


 Access and communications: 
·Use local media while permanent channels are set up: inform, command, direct traffic, direct ES vehicles
·Quickly create combined teams when possible by exchanging one element of the affected area (knowledgeable of his own &quot;backyard&quot;) with a crewmember of similar qualification from an ES vehicle of another geographical area. That procedure will progressively improve the long-term efficiency of the teams (quicker response time thanks to a &quot;local&quot; teammate: main and secondary accesses, water re-supply points, food, gas, lodging….)
·Fine tune inter-agency communication procedures: they should work horizontally (between subordinate units of different branches) as well as vertically (two separate networks linked to the top only) 


The video tape that claimed the attacks in the name of Al Quaeda warned that the next attack on America was 90% ready. Two years and billions after 9-11: are WE ready?

I am 14: I can vote, drive, drink, smoke, have sex and be the ultimate citizen moron run by exploding hormones, and traumatized by an unfinished childhood...Pot should be legal, Britney president, breast implant free, and money spend to find a cure for cancer should be rerouted to solve acne (cancer only kills old people....they should be killed at birth anyways....) .


NB:The ability to vote is naturally attached to the US citizenship, a birthright or a naturalization right that can nonetheless be legally suspended, thus, actually turning the &quot;right&quot; into a privilege. The &quot;vote&quot; is a civic duty that has always been given to responsible adults, and if tomorrow, one was to redefine adulthood through legislation, and lower the voting age to 14, the same should be applied to the purchase of alcohol and cigarettes (more tax money!), to legal sex (pedophiles would love that!), and driving (more taxes added to happy lawyers and insurance companies!). Furthermore, our immature kids would also have to be legally and financially held responsible for their actions and tried as adults (more unhappy kids!). No double standards when it comes to civic responsibilities! That is why voting has always been the unchallenged privilege of independent productive adults, and that is why all the 14 y-o in the nation are still cocooned under parental custody. Leave it that way please!


NB: Actually, if I had a say, it would be a better idea to suspend the voting privilege of the &quot;non-productive&quot; persons, that is to say our distinguished citizens that have never earned a living, paid taxes or are 100% supported by taxpayers money (long term students living with their parents, lazy bums and other coach potatoes, homeless, social free-grazers...); do we really want to give them the power to extend their benefits?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Super (bad?) Tuesday...


What else to expect from the Californian social free grazers and other financially irresponsible deep in debts voters, but to pass the propositions that are going to throw more billions of borrowed dollars into an inefficient legislature and an inefficient school system? No accountability, no reforms, no pain....we just borrowed money to make up for money we did not have but wasted! Principal and interests are going to amount to close to 50 billions and it is going to cost us, the few taxpayers left, about $100 per borrowed billion, that is to say about $5000 per taxpayer over the next 14 years! I thought nobody was planning on raising taxes? I tried to explain to my 7 year old daughter that she will end up paying part of the bonds for our lack of accountability but she did not get it. Actually, I still don&apos;t and the way most of you voted, you don&apos;t have a clue either

Survivors…
This is a personal message dedicated to the survivors of the second millennium, especially for the one raised in the fifties and sixties. They worked their tail off to rebuild the &quot;ancient&quot; war torn occident and provide us with all the things they never had. Their final products were the creators of the modern world as we know it. Not too bad for survivors!
Unfortunately, one of the byproduct of these proud and hard working generations was the creation of a litigating society and the breeding of mostly lazy entitled spineless and immoral morons that are going to take us full circle, back to the beginning…
Maybe, after all, asbestos, lead, bruises and germs had a genetic effect on us….or on the brain tissues of our offspring! 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


&quot;Even before the ground war in Vietnam had begun to settle down into one of grinding attrition - a strategy that is proof of a lack of strategy - the Americans had already begun to rely heavily on their overwhelming superiority in weapons technology. (...) But in the guerilla war, this dependence produced serious difficulties. If the enemy could not fight that kind of war, and was unsporting enough to resort to primitive tactics, then the crutch of high-tech weapons might prove extremely unsupportive. (...) At first, the Americans were somewhat bemused at the idea of finding themselves in conflict with a bunch of little guys living in holes in the ground. (...) It represented the early and simplistic attitude that techno logical inferiority, poverty, and stupidity somehow went together inside the black tunnels. (...)It was a view held by the commander in chief himself. Senator William Fulbright, then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recalled that President Johnson &quot;believed that with primitive society the Vietnamese had, they could not possibly prevail against the United States with its unlimited power.&quot; There was also a prevailing view among senior commanders that because Vietnam was not a full-fledged war but rather an extended police action, it was not necessary to endure the usual hardship of war&quot;Tom Mangold and John Penycate summarized it all in their 1985 book titled &quot;The tunnels of Cu-Chi&quot;. One just has to change the references to Vietnam with Iraq or Afghanistan to sum up the current allied military situation. CIA operatives, Special forces, Rangers, Seals, Delta, TF21 and Grey Wolves have been more successful against terrorists/freedom fighters in the aftermath of the high tech ground offensive than the rest of the heavy &quot;traditional&quot; combat units. Again it comes down to the basics of war and &quot;fairness&quot;. If the US wants to win that one, our troops, supported by our politicians, must go &quot;down and dirty&quot; and answer to guerilla with guerilla tactics, to terrorism with terrorism. Everybody heard about the 1967 infamous program designed by Robert Komer, Gal Westmorland&apos;s deputy of Pacification. Named &quot;Phoenix&quot;, and key element of a bigger &quot;Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support&quot; (CORDS), it was designed to &quot;root out&quot; (by all means) the communist organization in South Vietnam. The first phase of Phoenix was to gather intelligence using every possible &quot;trick&quot; of the trade (so immoral to our sensitive standards), from Human Intelligence (Humint, undercover agents....) to the use of prostitutes, torture, pressure or black mail..The second phase was the &quot;exploitation&quot; of the intelligence. Basically, Phoenix officially accounted for about 60.000 Vietcong agents captured or neutralized, 20.000 of them reported killed. Its (relative?) success, despite proven reports of abuses and &quot;collateral&quot; messes unavoidable when fighting in the gutters, lays in North Vietnamese official reports quoting the &quot;devious and cruel&quot; program as responsible for the loss of thousands key cadres, betrayals, major disruption of operations and defections of combatants, and loss of critical infrastructure and anihilation of the F100 commando unit and its sixty undercover agents and safe houses in Saigon. Nothing is fair in war and the winner even gets to re-write and sanitize history!Our troops are doing an amazing job despite being &quot;handcuffed&quot; by our politicians pressured by electoral deadlines, political correctness and international opinions. It looks like our beloved elected officials are the one loosing that war for partisan or self serving short term agendas. But only our soldiers will bear the marks of failure....for ever. That is what happens when the political will for war fades away: the soldiers, the troops pay the price. If one does not learn from the mistakes of history, one is doomed to repeat them, so let us finish and win that war or bring our boys back and hold our politicians accountable.

Do WE really want to give $12 billions to the education system when parents already donate so much while their dumbed down kids get abortions without their knowledge? What happened to the dozen of billions spent last decade?

Do WE really want to give Arnold another $12 billions on top of the ten proposed last year to bail Kalifhunia out of red ink? I thought WE elected Arnold-Fundraizor to deal with the problems the &quot;Terminator&quot; way!

Do WE want to empower our egislators (Reps and Dems alike) with a simple majority system and make it easier for them to serve the special interest groups that own them? The way it is forces them to reach a bipartisan compromise that serves us better. Just add deadlines, financial penalties and chair removal to perfect the system.

Do WE need a law to guarantee a &quot;balanced budget&quot; and a monetary reserve? If WE really do, let&apos;s recall our legislators and replace them with our average housewives: they know how to balance a tight budget! Do WE need 55, 56, 57&amp;58 or do WE simply need to cut the fat, stop the waste and kick elected officials into accountability?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


They propose and WE dispose...


Do WE really want to give the Californian education system more money to waste when parents already give time in classrooms and buy cereals and pens while their kids get abortions, Ritalin or surgery without their knowledge?
What happened to the dozen of billions that was spent last decade? One piece of advice: cut the fat, stop the waste and improve the end product!
Do WE really want to give Arnold more billions on top of the ten proposed last year to“bond”California out of the crisis?
I thought WE elected Arnold to deal with the problems the“Terminator”way: cut the fat, stop the waste, and kick some behinds!
WE don’t want a friend…WE have many! WE want a governor that governs, institutions that enforce the laws and accountable citizens that are ready for the painful remedies that will protect our kids from paying for our mistakes. After all, WE did not pay attention, did WE?
Do WE want the lazy legislators ( Reps and Dems alike) to be able to pass whatever law they want with a simple majority? Do WE want to trust them with the power of pushing whatever agenda they were paid to push by special interest groups? Are you kidding us? The way it is now forces a bipartisan compromise that serves us better. Let us add a deadline to achieve consensus and salary loss, chair removal plus penalties for every day of delay and the system would be perfect.
After all, WE hired them and discover WE can fire them…Good, let’s kick them into accountability too!
Do WE need a law to guarantee a“balanced budget”and an emergency monetary reserve fund? If WE really need such an amendment, it is time to recall everybody that have been elected to office and replace them with our average housewives: they know how to balance a tight budget!
Do WE need to pass 4 propositions to change“Kalifunia”or do WE simply need elected officials to do what WE pay them for?



Remember, they propose and WE, the people, dispose!

The Bush administration carries all the blames....


News report should start with something like....&quot; For the past 20 years, some how, everybody was led to believe Iraq and Saddam......and the misinformation was carried from administration to administration with the encouragement of the Intelligence community.....&quot;....not just Bush and his people....
By the way, wasn&apos;t mister Tenet appointed by Clinton???



God, I hate politics and fast food media...
Sunday, the dead GIs were buried page 17 but today Janet Jackson Breast is what counts in the old US of A....



Maybe we are the bunch of Morons politicians and media manipulate at will...One can argue that the current administration used the misinformation as a premise for war and that getting information (or misinformation) is one thing; acting on it is a different matter. Right, but many elected officials from all parties sat on the same Intel committees and were sold the same pieces of Intel the administration and all the Rumsfeld of the world were presented with. Many democrats also supported the war based on the evidences they got and that makes it possible to argue that the current administration waged the war based on the same pieces of info and on the bi-partisan support they got. 
As a French, I would just add that maybe, just maybe, an excess of arrogance and self importance prevented the Bush administration from trying to figure out why the Intelligence they got was not sufficient to convince the French, the Germans, the Russians and the UN. 
As a former Intel. officer, I can also venture to say that maybe 2 mandates under Clinton, that shrunk the military to 10 divisions and inserted political correctness in the Intelligence business (no deals with bad guys, not becoming bad guys), and an extra heavy reliance on Electronic intelligence added to the immense ego of the US Intel community brought us the bombed Chinese Embassy in Serbia, the Khobar towers in Saudi Arabia, our destroyed Embassies in Africa (Kenya and Tanzania), the Cole, the WTC...
Maybe the upcoming investigation is all for the best....if we, the &quot;we are the people&quot; crowd, finally understand that there is no possible dirty business without eventually getting down and dirty too. 
There is a name for the wasteful arrogant careless World minority we represent: victims!
The Occident is so fat, decadent, comfy and entitled that it cannot even grasp the hatred and envy it generates throughout the world.
Our enemies made it clear and who care if they actually &quot;hijacked a religion&quot;?
All our values put together cannot stop them because dying for a belief will provide them Heaven: the ultimate reward....
What are our values beside entitlement and compromise? Are they worth dying for, for the vast majority among us? Just a few of us are still standing for what they perceive as our real values (Country, family, Democracy) but when they die, they are buried page 17 of the newspapers, far away from Janet Jackson&apos;s sagging boob or her brother&apos;s deviancy!
Time To wake up and smell the coffee....because time is on their side and they are not tied to the next elections or political short term agenda....&quot;sit on the river bank and you will see the corpse of your enemy floating by!&quot;


No, WE CANNOT ALL GO ALONG! 

Anyways....just let put the constructive blame on all the people who deserve it and for once, do something for the future of our children... 

Did I get carried away....again?....what about them ?



&quot;One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.&quot;
  President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998.

&quot;If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq&apos;s weapons of mass destruction program.&quot;
  President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998.

&quot;Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face.&quot;
  Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998.

&quot;He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983.&quot;
  Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998

&quot;[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq&apos;s refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.&quot;
  Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998.

&quot;Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.&quot;
  Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998.

&quot;Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.&quot;
  Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999.

&quot;We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.&quot;
  Sen. Carl Levin (d, MI), Sept. 19, 2002.

&quot;We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country.&quot;
  Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002.

&quot;Iraq&apos;s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.&quot;
  Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002.

&quot;We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is using and developing weapons of mass destruction.&quot;
  Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002.

&quot;The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons...&quot;
  Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002.

&quot;I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force - if necessary - to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.&quot;
  Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002.

&quot;There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years . We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.&quot;
  Sen. Jay Rockerfeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002,

&quot;He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do.&quot;
  Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002.

&quot;In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.&quot;
  Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002

&quot;We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction. &quot;[W]ithout question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. And now he has continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real ...
  Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003.

Is Bush a Democrat?  
The only thing that caught my attention during the politically insignificant Iowa Caucus happened at a political event hosted by Howard Deans and disrupted by a pro-Bush group. When the name calling started after a pitiful performance by another“has been”(senior rocker citizen“Joan Jet”),“flag waving fascists”and“communists”were the insults of choice that were exchanged.
Do the Democrats really believe that the Republicans under Bush leadership are fascists?
Do the Republicans really believe that all the Democrats are Communists?
The scary thing is that both parties, blinded by their own deviated“ideo-logic”, do believe it. But could it be that today’s Republicans are only yesterday’s Democrats?
A new“right wing”is indeed appearing at the House and in the Talk radio media to counterbalance what is seen as modern Republican liberalism and to give a voice to millions of Americans afraid by the successful assault on their (traditional?) values by far too“diverse”and colorful minority groups: they are conservatives and believe in“past”traditional Republican values that are not reflected anymore in the new Republican party lines that promotes bigger government, huge government spending, de facto amnesty for illegal immigrants and expensive and demagogic social policies.
Twenty years ago, the current George Bush could have run as a Democrat…against his father!
Today, he is considered as a fascist (Hitler, Mussolini???) by the Democrats…and the Democrats are considered far too mellow by the emerging extra liberal power players, the Green party and other ACLU minded like groups of activists.
Finally, the old traditional bipartisanship is collapsing due to an extreme shift to the“left”, and giving way to emerging extreme from both side of the spectrum.“Extra liberalism”and“’Extreme Right”are disrupting the old balanced order and soon, like in most of the European countries, the US flag of the new“nationalists”is going to battle in the streets the red or rainbow flag of the revolutionary“extreme left”.
If one does not learn from the mistakes of history, once is doomed to repeat them.
For the past 3 decade, political correctness, added to the abandonment of our core values (country, family…) and the growing failure of the institutions to enforce the laws, created a“dumbed down”society ruled by litigations and total un-accountableness of its“equal but separate”entitled citizen-victims.
The result is showing today with the shifting of the“traditionalists”to the right of the Republicans“a la Schwartzenegger”and the bending of the most recent generations toward the extreme left and its“anything goes”attitude; entrenched radicals, left and right!
Is America going to see a new Perot or Buchanan finally split the Republicans because its current leadership is too liberal? Most likely.
Are the Democrats going to lose voters to a new Nolan, a new Libertarian or Utopian party? Most likely.
Is George Bush a Republican version of a liberal? It looks like it anyways.

Have you ever seen the specs on a military wife? She has to be completely independent, possess the qualities of both father and mother, be a perfect hostess to four or 40 with an hour notice, run on black coffee and little money, handle every emergency imaginable, without a manual, be able to carry on cheerfully, even if she is pregnant and has the flu. She must be willing to move to a new location 10 times in 20 years and help other military wives go through their lives. She also needs an unusually strong heart so it can swell with pride in her husband&apos;s achievements, sustain the pain of long separation, beat soundly when it is overworked and tired, and be large enough to say &quot;I understand&quot; when she doesn&apos;t, and say &quot;I love you, regardless&quot; when she waves goodbye to her husband from a pier, a runway or a depot, knowing in her heart why it is so important that he leaves. Sometimes she might shed a tear for joy, sadness, pain, disappointment, loneliness or pride but always, she shows a dedication to all the values that she and her husband hold dear. Have you acknowledged one lately?

California, June 2015. The pink cruisers of the Political Correctness Police are patrolling the neighborhoods. Finally, after decades of civil and human right activism, undocumented immigrants, homeless persons, credit or other job challenged people are getting a fresh start Californian style: they are moving to suburbia. Every house displays a pink multilingual“open house”sign. The Californian“Casa Amor”law is finally being implemented and every single vacant 500 square feet of Californian housing is about to be shared with the under-privileged, the“road kills&quot; of our insensitive system. That is why loaded pink buses are converging to the suburbs. John and Jane“taxpayer”Doe have been prepared for that day too. Despite their selfish busy working schedule, they underwent night classes of cultural awareness, learned the 20 most common American languages and took weekend“guilt field trips”in San Fransiscomeless. Reeducation has been completed and they are now standing on their porch, rehearsing a welcome speech or holding a Pinada. Today, they are giving away their extra square footage to the needy. Today, they are entering the new Political correctness dimension and showing the Californian way to the world…

That is when I woke up! Happy New Year.

Our current administration and our intelligence community have long pledged that the 9/11 mess won’t happen again. And trust them, it won’t!



Don’t get them wrong, a terrorist attack on our soil is still more than likely to happen and the odds of the bad guys using weapons of mass destruction also increase with time, but that is not the mess federal and local administrations are trying to prevent. And how could they? How could one secure a country with thousands of miles of open borders and coasts, a suicidal country with a growing number of ACLU minded like political correctness“police forces”promoting illegal immigration, attacking the laws and law enforcement agencies, fighting profiling and willing to open our land, our homes and our hearts to anybody stretching a hand.
Even the Homeland security secretary confessed his ignorance on how many illegal immigrants live within our borders and freely cross them on a daily basis. He just threw at us an 8 to 12 millions range, a scary wild guess.

The Mess they are actually trying to prevent is the blame-game, the finger pointing that came after the twin towers collapsed, the accusations that everybody up high knew but that incompetence facilitated the attacks, the investigations of the intelligence agencies and the exposures of the tens of thousand of pieces evidence that could not be pieced together. That is why one came up with the color coded levels of alert and that is why any“chatter”that is intercepted by electronic (Elint-Echelon-NSA) or human intelligence (Humint-CIA, NSA, FBI, Military…), is basically served to the people in real time.
That is also why the NRA has seen a steady and major increase of its membership; people feel abandoned with the burden of their own security on their shoulders and some are taking the matter in their hands…go blame them!
Does anybody truly believe that Washington or Sacramento can prevent a Mohamed Atta or a Thimoty MC Veigh from ramming an explosive laden truck through a shopping mall (Mike Bower did it to our state Capitol in Jan 2001)? Martyrdom for all of us will be the reward for such innocence.

The“beauty”of terrorism is its simplicity! Any man dedicated to his cause and willing to pay the ultimate price can strike anywhere and anytime, and there is not much anybody can do about it but go after the brain and the money. The history of terrorism has showed that trying to foil attacks is just a mind game that, eventually, the attacked party always loses.

But we, the people, don’t know that. We have been pampered and spared for the past 30 years, when terrorism was only hitting foreign countries or our interests and people in foreign lands…We have been made to believe that our nation was invulnerable and that our land was out of reach. Arrogance on top of a major state of denial made us believe that we were not concerned by global terrorism…until 9/11!
Time for a new wake up call: you cannot be protected, you can only be warned!
By paying off the living relatives of the victims of 9/11 (compensating? For what?), and by allowing lawsuits, the administration admitted some kind of responsibility for not being able to stop the attack and opened a Pandora box. Here we are now, 3 years later, still expecting a complete protection we will never get!

Instead, we have been involved in our own defense and we have to share the burden. We have been made responsible for our fate. When the government cries“wolf”, we are given pieces of information that are determining our actions, our choices. It is now up to us to“read”the chatters and decide if the warnings are worth changing anything in our habits, worth flying or not, leaving town or not…
We wanted it and we got it…we are now involved and responsible thanks to the“cover your behind”mouthpieces from Washington that are now transferring the burden and the worries to the John and Jane“crying babies”Doe.

What else to expect from them? The trend already started with the mapping on the Internet of the free roaming sexual predators that are being released in our neighborhoods. On the one hand, non accountable lawyers and doctors are giving them a clean bill of mental health for their release, while, on the other hand, State funded websites pinpoint them, transferring all the responsibility for protecting children to the neighbors. What happened to the concept that when somebody is released from jail, it means that the debt to society has been paid and that the person has been fully rehabilitated? Gone with the wind, I guess!

And now, our newly elected governor wants to save money by releasing 25.000“harmless”inmates in our streets. Maybe they are harmless and not recidivist because they are behind bars! Does it mean that they should be released? Should I stop paying taxes and buy a couple of guns?

The Bee, Dec1: “My interests are in making you as successful as you need to be so that when we work together on whatever is important to me, you’ll have the capacity to make it happen”. That is what Senator Cedillo told Gov Schwarzenegger when letting go of the current SB60 and announcing its 2004 version. It sums up the“self-serving-politics-as-usual”motto some of our elected“politicrooks”live by. Why are the Democrats, Hispanic caucus and farmers’unions endorsing illegality, modern day slavery and low wages without benefits instead of promoting our values, legal immigration, the living wages and all the benefits that come with the American dream? Why are they sponsoring“sweat shops”? As long as they are in the slave business they should bring in Chinese workers paid the 75 cents a day US companies pay them in their homeland, and point them to the farms…That would quickly take care of our immigration problems: no Hispanic would work for that amount and extra Chinese would have to swim in!
Educate me please: what is the big picture?

&quot;The villagers were forced to attend the clandestine meeting. After a lengthy speech on the benefits of the revolution, the Vietminh political officer crushed a raw egg in one of his hands to illustrate the fact that the &quot;white&quot; of the egg, will eventually go away and only the yolk will remain, the yellow. Such a crude analogy was a common propaganda tool during the French and American Indochina wars. In Iraq, in Afghanistan, anywhere in the world where our troops are deployed, locals know that it is not going to last. For us, in the Rat race, two or six months can make a huge economical or political difference. There, time measures in years, decades. Furthermore, Saddam is not running for re-election and terrorists are not required to respect the rules of war! An Arab proverb says it all:&quot; sit on the river bank and you will see the corpse of your enemy float by!&quot;…time is the essence. A Reggae song explains it all:&quot; a fighter that runs away gets to fight another day!&quot;…winning is the only goal.&quot;


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A Somali adage says…
 &quot;Me and Somalia against the world. Me and my clan against Somalia . Me and my family against my clan. Me and my brother against my family. Me against my brother.&quot; 
An Afghan adage could have said the exact same thing and here we are at it again, trying to deliver our democratic model to a country that has a European middle age like social fabric. 
Enter the Russians
For ten years, Russian conscripts brought the Socialist revolution to Afghanistan. Most of them believed that they were building schools and hospitals for children.
But the reality was different and instead, they were dug in behind minefields and barbed wires in a few key fortified cities, and their dead were buried in the secrecy of the Russian nights.
Venturing out meant heavy armor, air support, merciless combats. No prisoners, mutilated corpses, destroyed“kichlaks”(farms), slaughtered families, multicolored“butterfly”mine to attract children, black market, Opium, burned bodies…
The country still belonged to the Moujahedeens They were launching US backed operations from Pakistan and the factions were united in their“jihad”(holy war) against the invaders and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan forces (DRA: puppet government). “Me and Afghanistan against the Russians!”. 
For America, Afghanistan was some kind of continuation of the cold war.
Exit the Russians and enter the Talibans.
Once the last Russian was gone, traditions took over in Afghanistan and a civil war raged until the strongest faction “ Me and my clan against Afghanistan ; Me and my family against my clan”.  Unfortunately for the Talibans, Kabul, Herat and Kandahar are not Afghanistan and local warlords were still controlling whole provinces To really get the big picture of the Afghan way, one just remember that when they were escaping from the American led forces, in 2002, the runaway Taliban leadership had to pay its way through their“own country”to the Pakistanese border.
The Taliban ruthless regime was a dictatorship of Islam and erased the little social improvement the Russians brought in their occupied cities where women were allowed to go to school, teach, work and drive.
Who cared about the civil war, the mines, the maimed children, the opium crops, the bombed out statues of Buddha and the“lost”anti-aircraft“Stinger”missiles? Russia had its Vietnam and Taliban country became a nice buffer for the US“protectorate”of Pakistan…Buried in its self destruction, it fell in the background of the Western world preoccupations, like Somalia or the multiple Sierra Leone or Rwanda of Africa….....until 9/11.Exit the Talibans, enter US forces and NATO:
“If one does not learn from the mistakes of history, one is condemned to repeat them.”
It took 2800 deaths in New York to bring Afghanistan back to the foreground. The culprit, Bin Laden, the American creation of the 80s (Bin Laden and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar got their weapons from the US), was running its terror network from that country ruled by religious tyrants. It was time for the US to avenge its dead and money and weapons, again, bought the temporary alliance of some disgruntled ethnic groups left behind by the religious revolution.
And here we are again, backing up an imported friendly and corrupted government, dug in behind minefields and barbed wires in a few key fortified cities and chasing our creatures all the way to Pakistan, officially an ally but traditionally a safe heaven for the Mujahedeens. Bin Laden, and Hekmatyar, Harkat ul Mujahedeen, Hizbul mujahedeen, Al Badr and the Patchuns from the South, are raiding Afghan forces and killing Afghan officials that represent the“infidels”. In their“Madrassahs”(Quranic school), the Imans are issuing“fatwas”for another“Jihad”against another invader. Rejuvenated Talibans forces under the new leadership of Mullah Mohammed Assan and Qadir, reinforced by Al Queida members and Mujahadeens from all over are escalating guerilla war against American and Nato forces in the Eastern and Southern provinces.
 “Me and Afghanistan against the Americans!”. 
Exit the US and NATO, enter…
 “One cannot buy Afghanistan. One can only buy it from somebody else!”
Once again, Afghanis are united against what they perceive as the bigger evil and as history unravels, their attacks are hitting the cities held by the occupying forces.
During their war against the Russian forces, the Mujahedeens excelled at keeping the cities insecure. Ambushes, limited hit and run operations against military or civilian targets, bombings, kidnapping and“hits”on military and political figures were regular occurrences that the Red Army could not prevent, especially in the major cities of Kandahar and Herat that the soviet finally bombed into rubbles, still failing to stop the urban guerrillas.
The future for Afghanistan might not be the one our forces and governments are planning. Fiercely independent and nationalists, Afghanis have shown through their most recent history that they only tolerate others to interfere with their domestic political chaos for a limited time. The Talibans have been ousted. To the Afghan eyes, they were just a little too extremists but the new Talibans under new leadership seem more adequate than foreign powers or corrupted“puppet regimes”.
Is it time for the US led forces to let the traditional power players resume their role of balance in the Afghan political anarchy?
Like Somalia, Afghanis know that westerners will leave, one way or another. When this day comes, Inch Allah, everything will return to normal, to a world they understand.
Afghanis are easy going, fatalist people. They also love to joke.
In Kabul, one of them told a French soldier that they really liked the French and that they would kill them last when the time to get rid of the foreign forces will come.
How touching!

Sahara, 20 tourists have just been released by other believers of Islam. That was the headlines yesterday. While Indonesia is fighting religious zealots, India and Pakistan are sharpening bayonets, Iran is fine tuning its nukes, Libya is purchasing a new virginity, Somalia and Sudan are still“civil-waring”, Russian hospitals are leveled in Chechnya, new anti progress alliances are stepping up against democracy in Afghanistan…Another day in the paradise of a religion hijacked by its most intolerant and maniacal followers, the manipulative“terro-nihilists”that bath their revolution in the blood of the innocents to create fear, chaos, terror and eventually fulfill their agenda. Giving up to terror cannot be the way out for the weakened democracies of the world, the victims. It is time to set aside the Geneva Convention and other luxuries of our world of diplomacy, roll up our sleeves and fight these animals in the gutters where they strive. Or we can sit down and talk, give peace a chance, reach for them open-armed, sing“we are the world”and be slaughtered on the altar of obscurantism.

Since when has the stalled recall that was driven by a $38 billion deficit turned into a racial thing plastered all over the media?
Is it because everything American revolves around special interest groups and“victimized”voting minorities?
When I studied the American civilization, in France, the time when America went from the &quot;melting pot&quot; to the &quot;salad bowl&quot; was the historic landmark that changed the country for ever.
America the &quot;melting pot&quot; was the nineteenth century land of opportunities where immigrants sailed to. It was the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and the immigration process, a young democracy everybody could be a part of and help define.
The &quot;melting pot&quot; process successfully mixed up millions of European, dozens of cultures, religions, languages and struggling races!
A land of enlightment by the people.
Some groups did not make it. Blacks were segregated and American Indians were dying in reservations. Asians were working hard and Muslims were warlords out of Hollywood fantasies. It took until the late sixties to achieve a greater social balance and to right major wrongs. 
From the late sixties forward influential organizations decided to cater to the &quot;road kills&quot; of integration.
In the new correct America, a multi-colored &quot;salad bowl&quot; where all the players are to be kept separated under different sets of rules or privileges was created.
Multiple languages, cultures, religions, physical conditions...and begging groups!
A land of entitlement for the people and by the lawyers.
Diversity in the name of equality!
The wealthiest blacks of the world became African Americans. Hispanics and Native Americans joined the Pacific Islander and the white-non Hispanics patchwork. Illegal immigrants became undocumented aliens and women got their preferential treatment, along with the gay-lesbian community, the disabled and basically everyone except your typical middle class American. Interesting enough, the only exception to that social demotion of minorities to the“victim-entitled status”is the Asian community that is still demonstrating that minority status, immigrant status, integration and cultural identity can cohabit in the land of the free.
On behalf of special interest groups, politicians are profiteering from that social-liberal revolution: groups of“entitled victims”have been created and are jealously preserved and catered to.
What would Dr King say if he knew that his grandchildren are begging for a“black”day and rodeo at the Californian fair and lobbying for more racial data collection? What would he say witnessing a lawsuit from the ACLU, NAACP and MALDEF stating that minorities are not bright enough to use the same voting machines that were good enough to elect Democrats for the past five years?
We are now identifying ourselves within a protected minority and not as a nation, within an entitled group and not a country. Talk about social improvements.
Where is it written in any interpretation of the constitution that the language of the country is political correctness, whether expressed in Spanish or Mandarin?
Where is it written in any interpretation of the constitution that the majority does not rule in a democracy?
Where is it written that the constitution should be interpreted?
A joke describes the difference between dictatorship and democracy: dictatorship is: &quot;shut up!&quot;, it said, and democracy is &quot;blah blah&quot;.
So true in the land of the dictatorship of the minorities?
So true in the land where votes count, where opinions are listened to, where politicians elected by the people work for the people, where money and recognition is less important than skills, blah, blah, blah, blah...
By the way, what happened to the budget deficit?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Since when has the stalled recall that was driven by a $38 billion deficit turned into a minority thing daily plastered all over the media?
It must be because everything American must revolve around special interest groups and“victimized”voting minorities?
In the land of entitlement, we are divided by the politicians and the lawyers; In the land of diversity, we are identifying ourselves within a protected minority
and not as a nation, within an entitled group and not a country. I had a dream that my 2 children will grow in the dictatorship of the minorities and will not be judged
by the content of their character but by the color of their skin, the percentile of Indian blood running in their veins, their immigration status, their weight, their religion
or sexual preferences. I had a nightmare.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


More Californians are following the debates and educating themselves on the issues at end and voting attendance is predicted to be at a record high.
Good…Civism is finally back in California. It is time to reclaim our democratic rights and make our voices count. It is time to end the dictatorship of the minorities, of the special interest groups, of these judges and lawyers who decide what is good for us because we, the majority, failed to participate. We had a revolution because we could not stand the wigged mouthpieces of the British crown making decision for us. God fearing Americans built a country under god and by god. That is my country and the country of the MAJORITY among us. How dare they, modern time dictators, regularly overturn the will of the people and ignore the will of the majority with a single signature. I want my country back, by the majority and for the people.

According to some well informed sources within the Democratic Party, a recall of the newly elected governor might get momentum with the recent announcement by Hitler himself that Arnold Schwartzenegger took advantage of their friendly relationship and groped him in Berlin during the 1936 Olympics. Furthermore, dozens more unattractive women came forward to criticize Arnold. The bold womanizer refused to have anything to do with them in the past, rejection that led them to depression and other self destroying activities. Mr. Hitler has not returned Bob Mulholland calls for an exclusive interview yet but ex-president Bill Clinton was quoted saying that at least, as a good woman loving democrat,“he would have had sex with all these women”.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A seventeen year old died after a medicinal abortion and we blame it on the abortion pill, not education, teen sex or unplanned pregnancy. A kid is shot at school during an argument and we blame it on the guns, not on the evolution of mentality in teenagers or their lack or values or respect for anything. An art show displays tame nude paintings and is censored, but it is an expression of our freedom of speech to paint the Virgin Mary with dung. Immigrants lobby for more freebies but send billions in their home country and don’t invest in our economy…and on, and on!!!
Am I the only one or is there something wrong in our“bizarro”world? An upside down world…What a ride!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

I have never realized it until it was brought to my attention by the media coverage of the recent Supreme Court ruling on races as a factor to use in the name of equality. Now, when I look at successful blacks, Hispanics or Asians, I cannot help but wonder if they got where they are thanks to hard work and merit or just because of a political correct preference. This will apply to my dentist, surgeon, manager, lawyer, cab driver or contractor and profiling will be my creed as of now because I want the best for my money. This is too bad for the one who deserve what they are but my preference will now go to the only victim of prejudice in this country: non minority groups. It is just common sense and not racism But what do I know? As a green card owner, an Alien, I am also a victim of the American policies that created diversity in the name of equality. Go figure that concept!

Bleeding heart are applying domestic and international political and media pressure for the involvement of US troops in the Liberian mess. After all, isn’t Liberia a country created by America for its freed slaves? Aren’t we guilty for that? Don’t we owe them reparations too? Compassion again is knocking at our door and asking for another donation. Let us do it and give them our kids. Let our boys defend peace and themselves against ruthless“soldiers”in civilian clothes, most of them 8 to 15 years old. Let the media show pictures of the pubescent victims of our armies of baby killers. Let the world hate us more and liberals blame it on republicans. Rational and emotional are conflicting again. Should we save the word? Yes, but can we? Maybe all the anti-war protesters led by Al&amp;Jesse, the NAACP and the ACLU should give peace a chance, go there, hold hands and sing“we are the world”.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tell me where you get your news and I will tell you who you are! The well-orchestrated visual choreographies that showed us the war, the victory, the speeches and other political milestones (Jessica Lynch?) were precise and detailed Hollywood-like productions run as psychological warfare operations to win the minds and the hearts of the American public.
In the 1990s, the first Gulf War entered history as an example of successful disinformation applied to politico-military goals. This war will become a symbol too for its real-time video news limited in space and reported out of a global context by embedded journalists: junk news for the junk food crowd!
I am so glad that the national and international written press is still around to help us acquire the big picture!

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you Governor! My company is moving its operations to Arizona and stranding me in bankrupt California (are we still the fifth economy of the world?).
Soon I will join the long line of the unemployed and cash my $300 check to pay increasing taxes, mortgage, insurance, utility bills, food, daycare, loan and all the other minor financial burdens of the little people. I am so glad that my taxes are paying for the state administration to sit down in cool rooms and contemplate the growing deficit while resorting to the short term tax patch. I own 5 cars (2 regular-3 classic) that I drive regularly and maintain. 3 are going to be put“on blocks”: no more insurance, tax, gas, lube and tune, accessories, wax and polish…No tax for you, Governor!
I will try to last for as long as I can and will eventually sell my hard earned home and move out.
I can’t wait for the time when illegal Californian immigrants will cross the border to Mexico, for a job in Tijuana. I will be there, driving the eighteen wheeler!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The democratic process that granted President Bush the presidency and the power to start a war also allowed a well-mediatized minority to dissent to &quot;give peace a chance.&quot; The consultation time is over and our elected government has made its decision.
Our soldiers are in harm&apos;s way and we must unite behind them now. In the short term, the next presidential election will give us another chance to make changes and the majority will elect or re-elect our leader.
In the long run, history will judge our country and its course of action. Our president is the leader of all the voters: pro, con and abstentions.
So stand up and support our military that is also fighting for the freedom of the few to disrupt our ailing economy or join Saddam&apos;s human shield brigades.

Dave Barry’s French“humoring”column was fun up to the meaningless French translation at the end (where is it coming from?). Sure enough the two countries disagree and sure enough they are still allies in the big scheme of things but I wish the French position would have been better explained on this side of the Atlantic in order to put an end of the superficial bashing promoting hatred. The French (or shall we start calling them“Freedom”, like the fries?) are literally mad at being singled out as the“peace mongers”when the US cannot even get 9 countries to support them. As far as WWII, cowardice and history of pacifism goes (according to ignoramuses in the US media), reading the French history should suffice restoring the fact that French are belligerents…and different. France does not want to be forced into a war and does not want the unilateral use of preventive force to be legitimized. France is mad at America for its new arrogance, for its simplistic binary approach of world politics (you are with me or against me), for a blurry case…French wonder how America the righteous ended up resorting to twisted arms and bribes for support (Guinea, Bulgaria, Angola, Turkey…); France wants to know why America, a lawyer driven country, disregards international laws and jurisdictions; why the god fearing country follows the war drums; why the land of the free and all the amendments ignores its domestic and international public opinion; France does not believe that the modern world is driven by“cultural shock”but wants to promote cultural differences and dialogue against uniformity and binary thinking. France does not want to anger nor please Washington. France just want to do it right according to its government, public opinion and the international laws that eventually granted us the world we live in. Saddam must go, France agrees, but not that way!
Finally, to expose the laughable stupidity of the anti-French forums, what is called French-fries actually came from Belgium and you cannot find French toast in France. After all, everything just revolves around cultural awareness: one has it or not!

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, the US government is going to come forward with hard evidences that Saddam must be contained now. That is about the only thing European media reported after the speech delivered by President Bush and the whole world is now looking forward to February 5. The French and Germans have said it repeatedly: make your case and we will follow. They know that the alternative to war is not peace but they just do not want to go to war for the kick of it.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


You cannot really find it in the US news and I want to spell out some of the French Anti-war arguments for you to think about.

The U.S. government was not successful in convincing the people of Europe that Saddam poses a threat worth waging a war. The U.S. government has not even succeeded in convincing 50 percent of its own citizens, and it expects European leaders to stand up and support something nobody believes in. European nations have strong Muslim minorities they need to deal with. Asking them to ignore them does not make any sense. How would America react if Europe wanted to attack Mexico with the support of U.S. forces? Asking the U.S. government to ignore the effects of such an involvement on its relationship with Latin America and the United States&apos; Hispanic minority would be kind of insensitive. The Euro is currently stronger than the dollar but that won&apos;t last if war becomes the only option. Recession is always hitting European countries harder than the United States. A lot is at stake across the pond and President Bush needs to present Europeans with a better smoking gun.

If a smoke jumper wants to fry with“Penthouse”, so be it! If a tank driver wants to melt under“Britney”, fine! Why the fuss if back at the base, everything is immaculate again? Taxpayer’s money also pays for the wars, the defective equipment and the low salaries of these people. But where is the taxpayer&apos;s &quot;oversight&quot;, the lawyer, the feminist and the columnist when the fat of their skin melts, when 50 caliber bullets tear them apart, when air-tankers lose a wing in mid-air? In our twisted world, a naked Virgin Mary painted with feces is art worth public display but soldiers cannot bring Pin-ups in the battlefield. People that professionally risk their lives tend to love and idealize women a little bit more than the new century feminized John Doe... It might be the combination of extreme physical fitness, stress and testosterone! Is that their sin? Or is their perception of perfection offending because it does not really reflects reality anymore? Sometimes I wish I could just sit down all day, be sensitive and practice political correctness for a living instead of being out there in the real world!

What is China to America? Numerous and hard working people denied basic labor laws are willing to pile up hours, give up vacations and earn peanuts to make corporate America richer. Isn&apos;t almost everything you look at &quot;made in China&quot;? What is America to Europe? Numerous and hard working people under
really basic labor laws (compared to Europe) are willing to pile up hours, give up vacations and earn peanuts to make corporate Europe richer. How do you feel now?

Isn&apos;t it ironic that the same contagious pustule-carrier disease that wiped out so many Native Americans is now threatening to wipe us all out? Are we, &quot;imported&quot; Americans, facing extinction too? How is Victoria Secrets going to promote skinny, fair-skinned models in a post small-pox world of overweight, scar-covered customers? How bad are actresses going to look after inoculation?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What is this big fuss about Profiling (v. tr. pro·filed, pro·fil·ing, pro·files. To draw or shape a profile of.screening by recruiters, socializing when you select your friends, counseling for school psychologists who tag your kid as troubled , common sense for the guy who avoids to provoke cruising-for-a- bruising looking adolescents in a black hand painted Camaro. Profiling is called headlines when deciding what juicy story is going to provide the ratings on the front page or the 8 o clock news. Profiling is also called affirmative action by the government.

What we call Profiling is what makes the word go: it is what you are, what you want, what you fear, what makes you successful in some lines of work where it is needed.

HR, front desk employee, anybody in the security business, salesmen, credit unions and banks, landlords&amp;. everybody does it&amp;. have to&amp;. Cops too!

I did not say it is a fair process, but after all, in the country of the all-amendment excuse, it is the expression of my freedom to choose and maybe the figures and the facts out there created a stereotype for the typical bad guy that the cops have to get. Too bad and change the statistics!

Why don&apos;t we stop hammering down well-known and limited risks of the shot and just take it. Instead of looking at pictures of the few vaccinations gone wrong over the past 50 years, one should take a peak of what the virus could do to your loved one. I want that shot, the one against big and medium-pox, Hepatitis, polio and a couple of self-injection syringes of atropine too.

France is still among the handful of countries that view America favorably.
Despite recent France bashing in US news, America is still highly supported by the French that have long understood that naiveness and arrogance are the unfortunate traits characterizing the way the US &quot;big kid&quot; deals with other countries, as illustrated (again) by two recent events.
Naiveness when the body of the Pakistani national executed for the murder of two CIA employees was sent back home, thus providing America-haters with a martyr and a reason for some flag burning.
Arrogance when a couple of ignoramuses planned a beauty pageant contest associated to a political agenda in the Sharia-abiding Muslim province of the riot torn country of Nigeria.
And after that, one wonder why most of the world does not support America... 

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It makes me sick when we waste our time debating issues such as the cross-burning being a demonstration of free speech protected by the First Amendment. I don’t really believe that the founding fathers wanted to protect such cowardly and vile acts when they wrote the constituion and granted us the“first”. I’d rather believe that they meant that a modern democracy should be an open forum for everybody to civilly express any kind of educated opinion, dissension included. So, messieurs the self proclaimed freedom-lawyers, why don’t you finally move from your twisted interpretation of our constitution to its real intent, from the gutter to the light?

A couple of Hollywood“have been”backed up by a couple of Hollywood“wanabees”are lobbying against the US pre-emptive strike war option. From the vain brainless fake blondes to Alec Baldwin (surprise! he still lives here.), they form a gallery of wealthy hypocrites that promote violence and death in most of the few movies they have a part in. The plans should indeed be amended to please them: retaliation would be the option to answer a terrorist attack against Hollywood. For all other scenarios: pre-emptive strike!
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To all the peace-mongers and crying babies out there, I have news for you: our president just reminded the world that our defensive strategy remains the same one we have had since the end of WWII: should an enemy use a weapon of mass destruction against us, our forces or allies, the US would retaliate with an arsenal not limited to conventional weapons.
Have you already forgotten M.A.D? The same concept that allowed us to be free, spoiled and obese applies today to all the Iraks and Al Queida of the world. Why don’t you stop the whinning and just go along with the ride that already saved your miserable suburbian lives?

Lessons learned from the 2002 Californian election comedy (it also applies to the system nationwide):
Lesson 1: In order to be elected (or re-elected) with a narrow margin, a Democrat needs to pocket (and waste) twice more &quot;contributions&quot; than a Republican. Note that both parties call them &quot;bribes&quot; when pocketed by the other.
Lesson 2: According to what Californians saw and heard, only crooks run for office.
Lesson 3: According to Forbes and the price set by Gov. Gray Davis for the gubernatorial throne ($67 million), only wealthy people can run for office.
Lesson 4: According to common sense and Lessons 2 and 3, only wealthy crooks run for office.
Lesson 5: According to Lesson 4, we know why Election Day is on a Tuesday: Why waste a weekend?

The world&apos;s fifth largest economy, California, can pride itself of being a bankrupt state lead by corrupt politicians, failed by most of its paralyzed institutions, handicapped by utopian liberalism, plagued by power and water crisis, regenerated by math and English impaired high school grads, jammed on most of its highways, flooded on most of its borders, at risk from food-water-air poisoning and infected with TB-like long forgotten illnesses.We still have a lot left, to live the suburban &quot;dream&quot; in the Banana Republic of California, but take a look at what we should have had, at what has been lost and at what is being wasted. The Oct. 1 report of the $700 million of federal help for low income families that the state forfeited for lack of matching fund is yet, another ridiculous blow. After all, why get a couple of free millions for non-campaign contributors when taxes can be increased for the common good?
Just blame it on the federal government and its stupid rules. It is the traditional way out.

My land of birth has been invaded so often and my people endured such a hardship since the Greeks started to paddle around the Mediterranean Sea, about 2500 years ago, that according to African American standards I should be entitled to reparations. I cannot avoid the nightmares for I myself carry the suffering of my ancestors: Roman soldiers taking slaves, Arabs raiding my villages, the Germans, The Italians, the French, alien abductions...My parents overcame the suffering of their elders and brought me to the land of opportunity. I missed a whole lot of them but I won&apos;t let this one go by: Give me the land and money I deserve for hardship that started around the stone-age. Is there a lawyer or reverend in the audience?

According to the INS, I am an &quot;Alien&quot;. To me, I am a just a visitor, an observer of the American way, from the &quot;melting pot&quot; to the &quot;salad bowl&quot;, from segregation to unbriddled diversity. The ethnic debates around the state fair attracted my attention and I believe that it is time to desegregate the event. The simple idea of the exitence of the so-called &quot;ethnic days&quot; should repulse civil right activists and take minorities in the streets. This is segregation at its best, a segregation defended by minorities. Can&apos;t black cow boys compete in regular rodeos? Can white ride in the black rodeo? Are hispanics welcome on Asian day? Is Spam the only food on Pacific Islander day? Are there any bathrooms for &quot;white non hispanics&quot; on these days and what happened to the native americans during this Fair of sensitiveness: don&apos;t they also deserve a day? So many questions in the city that prides itself to be the most diverse in California, not so long after many good people died for &quot;white only&quot; things to disappear!
In the name of equality, America finally created diversity: isn&apos;it the ultimate oxymoron?

Re &quot;Bullet misses French leader,&quot; July 15: The failed attempt on the life of the French president during the &quot;Bastille Day&quot; parade in Paris made the local news and showed something that would have gone unoticed otherwise:
The 2002 French national day, or &quot;Bastille Day&quot; as it is called here, was dedicated to the French-American friendship.
New York firefighters opened the ceremony and people cried. West Point cadets marched down the most beautiful parade ground of the world and people cheered.
Isn&apos;t it interesting to see that France did that at the height of a U.S. anti-France media campaign led by a minority of idiots mirroring a French anti-Americanism voiced by another vocal minority of idiots.
Here and there &quot;hate groups&quot; are trying to demonize the other when history shows that since the Revolution and despite a tumultuous relationship, the French-American couple has always been a strong one made of two strong-willed, independent partners.
Two reminders from the events in France: Our leaders are vulnerable and our media, sometimes, help distort the truth by giving an unchallenged forum to vocal biased groups.

While California was recovering from its Cinco de Mayo Margarita-Nachos hang over, in Europe, on the 8th of May, ceremonies were being held, ceremonies that should have been echoed here had the American people more respect for the American history, heritage and spilled American blood. All across Europe, foreign and US military units, US veterans, politicians and civilians celebrated V-Day Europe and reaffirmed in front of the immense neatly trimmed gardens of stone that the fallen &quot;boys&quot; are not forgotten and did not die for nothing. Where was your flag on the 8th and have you thanked a Vet lately? Should the existence of a“all-in-one Memorial day”erase the milestones of history?

For thirty years some at the highest echelons of the Catholic Church acted as accessory to the sex predators: guilty!
For thirty years, faithful to the best tradition of the American corporations, families have traded money for their children, a reverse prostitution called &quot;Settlement&quot; that have left the criminals unharmed and unexposed. Accessory to the sex predators: guilty! Shouldn&apos;t all the actors of this tragedy be held accountable for their personal role and face our justice system, right now?
Shouldn&apos;t we also teach a tough lesson to all the greedy parents that have &quot;settled&quot; the suffering of their children and the safety of our kids for the almighty dollar?

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Freedom of speech is limited to the politically correct, privacy is long gone and traveling became a hassle. The only real freedom we have is the freedom of choice and many lives are affected by our daily decisions. Some people eat junk food far too often: bad choice! Teen-agers race their cars: bad choice! Immature people have kids, guns or responsibilities: Bad choice! Unprotected sex is still common: bad choice! The list could be so long and I am limited in space....When people don&apos;t kill people, they willingly commit suicide using poor judgment. Letting them sue for compensations for their mistakes is taking the accountability out of the equation of life, leading to chaos and rich lawyers!

Hundreds of Palestinian gunmen followed the basic rules of terrorism and stormed an historical and sacred place to save their lives. But the Israelis were guilty!
The Palestinian gunmen seized the place of worship and the monks that would not abandon it. But the Palestinians were the hostages!
The gunmen had food and support and chose to surrender. No death for the cause for the people who use“children-bombs”. But they were the heroes.What would have America done if instead, 100 of Al Queida&apos;s men had been in the same church? The 9-11 mass murder would have been linked to the PLO, US forces would be conducting the massive clean up for the Israelis with the full support of the world?
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The 9-11 tragedy would have been linked to the OLP, the US military expeditionary corps would be right now in the occupied teritories destroying the terrorist infrastructure, rounding up Palestinian armed fighters, hunting down Arafat and his peers and shipping Shapiro, the american-palestinian, to Guantanamo. All of that would be done with the full support of the western world, the American people, the Congress and the media. Furthermore, our Secretary of State would never dare saying that such actions will never stop terrorism. Why would anyone fair and true to the belief that all terrorism is evil try to deny Israel the right to fight it?

Finally some medical geniuses are trying to provide scientific justifications for a barbaric ritual practiced in many developped and third world countries for various non-scientific reasons (religion,“hygien”, initiation, tradition, habit…). It is a wonder that a practice that has drawn the blood of millions of male and female children worldwide for milleniums have recently mobilized women but left men totally unconcerned. Mutilation of the genitalias, also called circumcision or excision for the males, has a new reason to live on: it helps prevent some sexually transmitted cancer and AIDS. And I thought that unprotected sex only was the agent for STDs….

Thanks to the Bee for taking a closer look on the impact the energy crisis and the recurrent issue of the Auburn Dam have on the American river. One only thought that private citizens and businesses were the most affected by the rate hikes and the black outs but actually, the rafting industry and related businesses have already been hit hard by the utilities who control the water flows. It is most likely that if adopted, the Auburn dam project will make things worse in the name of a short term energy patch.
Furthermore, when the honorable mister Doolittle says that rafting has an impact on the environment , he is right!
The American river rafting experience is turning everybody into a anti-Dam activist and rafters, compulsive cleaners and environmentalists, spend their time sharing their passion and protecting their river....Rafting is not just about getting wet and pushed around rocks by angry waves; it is mainly about rediscovering our roots, the world as it was before suburbia. It is about sharing with Americans and foreigners alike, the history and richness of our natural heritage. It is about making people aware of how threatened the nature we keep for granted is and how hard it gets to preserve the little we have left.
It would just take a rafting trip down the river for Mr Doolittle to realize how wrong he is.
Be my guest, Sir, it is my treat!

AOL &apos;s $46 millions extra monthly profit should show customers the dangers of monopolies.Arrogance and impunity often come with the position and the users, often lacking real alternative solutions, have no other choices but to grumble and pay. Microsoft can financially blackmail its client to switch to its new operating system and AOL can parade at the top as the one and only without regulation or outcry...With the freedom of choice almost gone, goes one of our fundamental liberties. Remember that people rule in a democracy, not businesses.I don&apos;t want AOL-Warner to tell me what to do: I chose Compuserve and you too should exercise your rights and change.
ooops! Sorry...AOL bought Compuserve too!

Representatives of the insurance, technology, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, securities and certainly automobile industries are gathering millions of dollars to defeat the Bills 36 and 11 that areaiming at exposing dangerous defective products. They argue that such
Bills are going to threaten trade secrets and patients privacy. The trade secrets they are afraid to see leaking to the public might b related to all these secret settlements that denied consumers the right toknow that they were at risk. The patients whose privacy is involved might be the victims (or their relatives) that sold their souls to prevent the corruptors from bein exposed, thus accepting shared responsibility for the cover up and for more unnecessary deaths (murders?).
When John Doe commits murder, even by negligence, he is bound to jail. When John Doe witnesses somebody being hurt and does not intervene or withhold information preventing a crime, he is bound for jail. When moneyis transferred to buy silence, to cover negligence that let to deaths or injuries, it sounds like the Mob is back in business.
And when these Mob like actions are conducted by top US companies, madelegal by huge amount of money and top lawyers and stay unpunished, it scares me.

The new US administration plans to develop the &quot;missile defense&quot; shield is
bringing us back 30 years ago when the option that the US would not risk a
nuclear holocaust to defend Europe from the Red Army had to be considered and
pushed European countries to develop their own arsenal and rely on a more
involved nuclear and non-NATO partner: France.
A US owned shield would only resume a long dead arm race and all the nuclear
powers and powers- to- be are going to dedicate more money and time to improve
their current nuclear weapons. That would seem to them as the fair price to pay
to achieve balance and deterrence again. Furthermore it will cost billions to
the US taxpayers for the development of that continental shield. How much do
you think it would cost a nuclear power to improve just ten of its missiles for
them to break through? Technology and brains are not just Americans and they
are many ways to &quot;deploy&quot; nuclear arms, the cheapest being a terrorist suicide
attack. If tomorrow a fairly industrial and wealthy nuclear power states that
its new top secret missiles have successfully be designed to break through the
shield, it will bring doubts in people&apos;s minds and the whole thing will not be
trusted anymore. Remember the lessons from history: in the - armor against the
bullet- race, the armor NEVER EVER won!

The American Civil Liberties Union defends the arcade gaming industry by
denying the government the duty to decide &quot; what kind of speech is
appropriate&quot;, what kind of message they can convey.
Furthermore, we have a judge that has also declared that &quot;children have
free-speech rights that should not be taken lightly&quot;.
The debate is becoming a constitutional one in the country of all the
amendments the Freedom of speech is going to be the topic, not violence.
If education of the parents and their children is the approach and if
violent gaming is just a mean of expression that should be protected from
restrictions and censorship, one should ask why pornography, alcohol,
vehicles, voting right and other issues have been banned, censored or
restricted. Porn was not deemed as an appropriate speech when it was
restricted to adults only, in blind shops and away from zoning area.
Sometimes the government has to step in and sometimes Civil liberties Union
should learn to step out.
When they are not under the supervision of their parents, kids can go and
play freely, practice a virtual Colombine. AB 40 will force the arcade
industry to take an active part in protecting our children. Is that so bad
or do we want uncontrolled porn too?
And by the way, my children have a free-speech right but as long as I am
responsible for them, I have the right not to listen to them!

Think about it for a moment and tell me if we are crazier than we have ever
been and if we are getting better at it:
The same one are not seizing the opportunities and the same one are crossing
oceans to make it happen, the crying babies are still crying and help comes
without trying, reverends and presidents have a taste for younger girls when
actors, boxers or football players beat or kill their spouses, the American
beautiful dysfunctional family model is an Oscar- winner and children saw
&quot;Scream&quot; from K2 through K6, adults riot over stupid $100 shoes and their
kids are going to be beaten up or worse over stupid $100 shoes, our
teenagers slaughter each other or feed their love kids to dogs, we build
unsafe and unreliable cars to better kill ourselves and &quot;Recall&quot; will be the
next model, we destroy the forests and the prairie in he name of god
&quot;Suburbia&quot; and we feed carcasses to cows, our pets are trained to kill and
we mix up Ebola and Aids to see what we are going to come up with, crack
dealers are made heroes by the news and dung has become Art, blasphemy is
freedom of speech but freedom to choose is profiling, peace is not
profitable and we reinvent the &quot;Cold War&quot;......
I could go on and on but you would call me a sour nag .....After all, each
of us is a contributing part of this madness.
Well actually everyone but me, because I did not do it and even if I did, it
is not my fault, I am not responsible and someone out there is willing to
defend me. So sue me!!!!!

At about the same time last year, a couple of denial-of-service attacks on high profile dot com businesses sparked a wave of surprising confessions from government agencies revealing that for months their computer networks had been hacked in, defaced or breeched. Scared and mostly computer illiterate congressmen granted money and allowed the FBI to use &quot;Carnivore&quot;.
For the past 4 weeks, we have been hammered with the story of a Russian mole inside the FBI, a spy that literally sold out the country most sensitive secrets for 15 years. The CIA joined in recently and declared that it had grossly overstated the Russian threat, thus misleading the country&apos;s foreign policy and expenditures.
It is hard to believe that the 2 most powerful intelligence apparatus of the world are so shallow. After all, the &quot;super spy&quot; of the century is just held accountable for the loss of 2 informants in 15 years, for selling out a tunnel any seismic sensor had already detected (the Russians learned from the US tunnel in Berlin) and disclosing to the Russian Navy that electronic devices were guarding the oceans.
Nothing new out there!
Today&apos;s world offers new threats and requires new responses. A major overhaul is needed for the 2 agencies that have re-assessed their missions, structures and cooperation.
Brandishing a scarecrow will most likely ensure that the FBI and the CIA will get the adequate funding.
So sleep tight America, your security still lays in pretty good hands.

Cinco de Mayo.
 
History can be so interesting depending on the side one is sitting on.
The Cinco de Mayo is the Mexican celebration of the 1862 battle of Puebla
when the Mexican army defeated the French force sent by Napoleon III.
April 30 is a major French military celebration of the 1863 French battle of
Puebla when 62 French Foreign Legionnaires held for a day a little hacienda
against a 2000 strong Mexican force. They refused to surrender and finally
the last 6 survivors fixed bayonets and charged to their death.
This heroic event is known by most of the French and closely linked to the
Foreign Legion that is admired and respected throughout the country.
The irony is that today, in two countries, people are celebrating the same
battle but different heroes.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Beware Californian police forces!
It is more likely that your presence is going to be perceived as a
provocation on this festive and colorful day and it is more likely that you
will be charged for profiling the Hispanic minority on that special day when
a lot more of of their representants are going to be carried away, act silly
and be pulled over, fined or incarcerated.

A few points to restore some truth and complete the article published Aug.
3rd:
 
 &quot;A wounded symbol, Concorde&apos;s first crash recalls its torturous history.&quot;
 
The Concorde has been successfully flying the rich and the wealthy over the
Atlantic for a quarter of a century, in about 3 hours, beating all the odds and
 critics.
For the past 25 years, its slick and elegant silouhette has been admired
worldwide by generations of plane spotters and other travellers stuck with fat
and slow commercial airplanes.
 
Copied by the Russians that flew their supersonic Tupolev for awhile despite
the mediatized crash of their prototype, and boycotted by the US, because it
was considered too noisy, Concorde has proudly displayed all over the world its
unequaled and successful technology.
 
Yes, Concorde is noisy. It is using fighter jet engines, yet I have never seen
any Military aircraft banned from taking-off or landing in any US Air Base or
US civilian airport located in populated areas. The noise was not really an
issue for the 20 Concordes that were built and banned...
Its high speed and altitude did not damage or stress its structure and 10 years
ago, for a major overhaul operation, the British and the French were surprised
to discover that after decades of flying high and fast, Concorde was corrosion
free (speed + altitude+ heat) and stress free compared to regular commercial
ships.
Concorde was such &quot;a technological failure&quot; that 2 years ago, US companies
backed up by the US government, spent millions of dollars in Russia to bring
back to life the Russian copy-cats, 2 or 3 of the remaining supersonic Tupolev
that were restored and filled up with electronics before being flown in order
to learn more about supersonic transportation...Maybe it was to painful for US
scientists to ask the Brits or the French about the success of a 30 years old
technology.
 
Concorde crashed and killed for the first time, but whatever the reasons,
some debris on the runaway that blew up a tire and started a chain reaction,
maintenance problem or just plain age, it will remain the symbol of flying with
style, the symbol of a successful technology that served its purpose.
 Should it be retired? It is up to Air France and British Airways to decide.
 
But today, still, it is undoubtly the most beautiful thing men put in the air
and lucky are those who get to fly it, travel in it or just watch it.

Among other things, I do strongly resent the fact that the Sacramento Bee only dedicated part of the front page of its March 14th edition, to a woman with a &quot;grooming disorder&quot;. The issue is important and should not have focused on one single person.
Don&apos;t get me wrong, I do feel a lot of sympathy for that disabled person because I myself suffer from a disorder too, the so famous but unrecognized &quot;hard to wake up&quot; disorder that got so many of us fired. It will take about 20 of us people fired for &quot;sleeping in&quot; to start a class action lawsuit and have the compassionate nation restore our pride and grant us a blue sticker and our lost wages.
We Americans, suffer all from some kind of ailment and it is about time that we wake up to this truth and face our disorders whether it is all about eating, sleeping, drinking, shooting, learning, working, or voting.
Let our nation of pioneers become a confederation of 50 institutions for deeply disoriented citizens!
We want to share our problems and be heard and as long as we will have courageous lawyers and doctors standing for our rights, we know that one day for sure, we won&apos;t have to hide, be ashamed or be afraid............. of the straight jacket.

Thank you so much for your generous gesture and finally putting an endto the suffering of many small and mid-size IT businesses that havesurvived the dot-com crash and the unpaid millions.Thank you so much for taking the easy way out to solve the energy problemyou createdand bill them an extra 40% for it.To make up for the lost money and contracts, to pay the taxes and adapttheir strategies to make the best of a slowing economy, many companies had to cut down their expenses and lay off people.The one that are not bankrupt yet have reached a fragile financial balance that is now broken. Are they now going to downsize, move away or close their doors?It is up to the State&apos;s miracle makers to convince them that higher pricefor power and more frequent blackouts throughout summer will help them bounce back toprofitability. Good luck Governor!

What is this big fuss about Profiling (v. tr. pro·filed, pro·fil·ing,
pro·files. To draw or shape a profile of. / To produce a profile of ????),
stereotypes or racial profiling? Isn&apos;t it something we all do everyday when
we see a battered pick up truck and think &quot;redneck&quot;, when we drive in front
of a cheap looking trailer park and visualize &quot;trailer trash&quot;, when we see a
drunk dirty bum relieving himself on the sidewalk and scream &quot;white trash&quot;.
Aren&apos;t we all Profiling all the time, choosing a nanny, a school, a beauty
or tattoo parlor, a parking spot, a street to drive through or a park to
walk in. Profiling is called screening by recruiters, socializing when you
select your friends, counseling for school psychologists who tag your kid as
&quot;troubled&quot;, common sense for the guy who avoids to provoke cruising-for-a-
bruising looking adolescents in a black hand painted Camaro. Profiling is
called headlines when deciding what juicy story is going to provide the
ratings on the front page or the 8 o clock news. Profiling is also called
affirmative action by the government.
What we call Profiling is what makes the word go: it is what you are, what
you want, what you fear, what makes you successful in some lines of work
where it is needed.
HR, front desk employee, anybody in the security business, salesmen, credit
unions and banks, landlords.... everybody does it.... have to.... Cops too!
I did not say it is a fair process, but after all, in the country of the
all-amendment excuse, it is the expression of my freedom to choose and maybe
the figures and the facts out there created a stereotype for the typical bad
guy that the cops have to get. Too bad and change the statistics!

I left France for America because, as most of the rest of the world, Ii truly
believed that the U.S were the country of unlimited capitalism: UP or GO!!! 
Well, surprise, surprise....America is 10 times more social than everything I
have seen in Europe and all its institutions and work places are tainted by
political correctness, quotas and ratios. Sex, races, religion or physical
challenges come before performances. The fear of a lawsuit is so present that
any spirit of competition has been anihilated along with the capacity of
telling someone or accepting the truth..
 Wake up America....We are just supposed to be equal in front of the law and
not every kid is going to write a symphony because his mother wants to and
threatens to sue: some kids grow up to carry the piano and not to play it! Just
spell it out to her!
When is America going to &quot;desegregate&quot; and treat people according to what they
do and not what they are(ie minority, female,gay, disabled, sun-lover...),
according to the goals they can reach and not to the &quot;case&quot; they might have.

o you believe that our founding fathers were crooks and wrote a
constitution to protect crooks?
I would not think so.
Do you believe that most of our lawyer&apos;s interpretations of our rights tend
to make my first statement right?
It would appear like it.
An attorney proclaimed that using thermal imagery technology against a
pot-grower was leaving the &quot;homeowners&quot; unable to protect their privacy
because technology was exceeding &apos;the natural senses&quot; and subverting our
&quot;ability to contain private matters&quot;.
Thank you so much to consider all &quot;homeowners&quot; as mobsters, to consider
cancealing a crime as a private matter and to skillfully ignore that the
basis of all illegal operations is to beat &quot;the natural senses&quot; of law
enforcement agencies.
Why would anyone fight to have a low-tech and powerless cop when the bad guy
walks around with Kalashnikovs, police scanners, cell phones, the internet,
night vision devices and other goodies like, let&apos;say, no law to abide by?
It beats me!

 If you rent or buy a house, you are supposed to exercise your freedom of choice
and use your better judgement.
When moving next to Mather airport, one has to expect some kind of unavoidable
nuisances caused by air traffic.
Reconsidering and complaining afterwards is not only unfair to the legitimate
businesses that have been long time contributors to the development of the area
but also shows a now common lack of personal responsibility.
Remember that you can choose your neighborhood but not your neighbours!
I chose to live at the end of the runway of a busy small airport but I don&apos;t
mind the airplanes at all.
What I hate the most are lawn mowers in the afternoon, loud music and loud
foul-mouthed people.
Oh, by the way, why do you think you had such a good deal on your new home when
the rest of Sacramento&apos;s suburbs are still overpriced and soaring?
Are you going to complain about that too?

I polled some people around me and asked them what happened May 8 that should have a bigger celebration in the US than the victory of a foreign army in a foreign country over another foreign army (Cinco di Mayo). I got everything from the &quot;Ocho di Mayo&quot; to complete internet listings of all the events that occured on that day throughout history. I am a former military, foreign, and grew up watching on that day, all over Europe, civilians and military alike gathered in US military cemetaries and in front of all the monuments dedicated to the victims of WWII, paying their respects to these brave men and women who fought and died for our freedom. In my little 150 people village in northern Corsica, children are going to sing the national anthem, do the roll call of our victims and somebody will answer: &quot;dead for the country!&quot; for each name called. I am French and May 8, I will fly the US flag. Oh, by the way, did I say that May 8 1945 was the end of World War II in Europe?

About a month ago, the United States of America, leading the way to the rest of
the free world was forcing ex-president Milosevic
to accept the outcome of the elections and concede without trying to manipulate
the results, recount or organize a &quot;revote&quot;.
Today, the one and only superpower, in the name of democracy and to make
everybody&apos;s vote count is making a fool of itself selecting its new president
by interpreting people&apos;s ballots, Chads (hanging and pregnants), dimples, vote
real intent, discarding lesser ballots without postmarks, litigating when law fails...
The words &quot;fraud&quot;, &quot;manipulations&quot;, &quot;sore loser&quot; and other have been said and
printed; the damages are done and the USA will have a hard time forcing
democratic values to third world countries in the future and the next
president, whoever it might be, will always see that silent question in the
eyes of his interlocutors:
&quot;Tell me, did you win it or did you steal it?&quot;.

More casualties related to the Firestone ATX tires.
Why? 
At first, one could have blamed Firestone and Ford for the accidents related to
the thread separation of the tires but now, a full month after the medias
started talking about it, why are people still dying or ending up in hospital
beds? 
On August second, when the SACRAMENTO BEE blew the wistle and mentioned the
recall in many countries, USA excluded, I called local Ford dealers and was
told not to worry. 
On that same day I was charging new tires on my credit card.
It was not the best thing to do to my bank account but it was the reasonnable
thing to do. 
I can&apos;t believe that some immature and irresponsible people are still driving
their cars knowing that their tires might kill them or other users of the road.
Shouldn&apos;t they be prevented from using the roads? 
I thought that I was safe with my new tires and I just found out that Firestone
can still hurt me because of the stupidity of some drivers.

There is not a single week without a recall from the #2 automaker, Ford.
Nothing to worry about: airbags, seat-belts, fuel lines, cruise control, bad
tires, steering wheels, wheels and hubs.....you name it.
How can a company that obviously has problems building safe cars be the #2
automaker?
What about the quality of the production of the #20?
See the new Ford RECALL 2000 next friday in your favorite newspaper.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Here it comes again.....Ford will have to recall 1.7 million cars because of
defective ignition systems.
After the tires, the seat belts, the self inflating air bags, this recall shows
again that what customers take for granted when buying a car is far from being
done. Technology that should be mastered by now on standard pieces of equipment
still fail us because of sloppy and cheap design or production.
Add to that the cover-ups, by Firestone, Ford or Mitsubishi (plus the one that
have not been found yet...), the volunteer recall of defective tires made by
Continental (feeling the heat?) or the ABS problem of our school buses and you
can safely assume that what we hold for true in the Airline industry is hitting
the Automobile industry: globalization and ruthless competition may force
industrials to cut corners....at the customer&apos;s expenses.
Now that the company execs can be held reponsible and jailed for such things
and thanks to media scrutinity, let us hope that this trend will be over soon
and that we will get more quality and safety and less big broad fake smiles for
our money.
Furthermore, let us pray too that the NHTSA, theBBBs, BARs and other
pro-consumers organization will have the financing and independance necessary
to our protection.

I do strongly resent the fact that I was referred as &quot;White&quot; on the cover page of the March 13 issue of the Sacramento Bee. I am neither &quot;white&quot; nor &quot;American&quot;, nor &quot;white Caucasian&quot; or &quot;white non Hispanic&quot; anymore.
Like many ethnic groups in our country, I now want to be referred as what I truly am:
A European American.
I might even go as far as adding a regional touch to it because we are all so culturally different in Europe: call me a &quot;Western European American&quot;.
But I am of French ancestry and first generation here so maybe &quot;Western European French American&apos; would describe me better, would make me feel more accepted and part of the &quot;salad bowl&quot;.
And you know what, too, I am a full breed proud Corsican, born in our 120 years old family house and raised in Napoleon&apos;s island so why don&apos;t you start calling me a &quot;Western European French Corsican American&quot; and stop messing with my culture, origins and feelings before I sue you.

What kind of message do parents want to convey to their kids?
Is a pipe bomb at Colombine an evil thing and a pipe bomb in somebody&apos;s
pumpkin a good one?
What about putting together a pipe bomb for a destructive purpose? is that good
too?
I remember the outcry about Colombine and the blame put on the careless parents
that did not know what their murderer-
to- be- kids were doing at home,sawing off shotguns and building bombs. Are the
parents of the two pumpkin-blowers any better?
And finally, what if my two year old had decided to take a closer look to that
pumpkin on that magical night?
Is it OK for him to get hurt because a blowing up bomb is a prank according to
the new biased standards?

Vice president Cheney&apos;s message to the nation, basically telling the US
citizens that saving energy was plain nonsense and that the focus should be
put on increasing the domestic fossil fuel production, is a real civic
message that should be engraved in stone for the next generations to enjoy
through the eyepieces of their gas masks. 
&quot;You shall not save energy&quot;, ever.
The fossil fuel supply is eventually going to run out and just depending on
it, not saving it and not focusing on developping alternate solutions for
our children is the most short sighted and irresponsible act a government
can do.
Is America an arrogant and self destructing superpower or is it the
&quot;policeman&quot; of the word, the country supposed to spread democratic values
and set the example?
The 2 oil crisis of the past 30 years forced the country to build better
cars, to investigate alternate power sources, to learn the values of not
wasting energy, to educate users and producers...Today in California, people
and businesses are finding solutions to cut down consumption and bills.
Is it so bad or are some financial interests upset by this new attitude?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


PG&amp;E and Edisson can&apos;t keep up with years of regulation on the one hand and the
fast Californian growth on the other.
The needs are increasing tenfold and we expect these companies to face them for
free because nobody want to come up with the money.
It is going to hurt them first; than, myself as a share h older and finally
you and me as consummers. California need strong power company with the cash
flow necessary to increase the production, cover the increasing needs and
export electricity.
We have part of the solutions:
- push for alternate energy (the candle, the sun or the nuclear....)
 - quit our wasteful habits and turn the air con and extra lights off
- pay big money for ever
Choose wisely California, because the High Tech business is &quot;electricity
hungry&quot; and hates black-outs....it might take its dots, its coms and other chips
and move them somewhere else!

Ford Recall. No it is not the new model from the automaker...
Recall is what Ford does the best and my Explorer has been recalled twice in two years for major security features.I wish I knew in 1999 what I know now and I wish I had the choice we have now not to buy Ford or the Explorer.I am screening the news everyday for updates on the safety of my car and for exposure of new cover up.More is going to surface with the open antagonism between Firestone and Ford and the blaming game will finally bring the truth.In the meantime, 174 dead and 700 injured later, I make sure that my children are safely strapped, I drive extra-carefully and I maintain my SUV like if my life was ONLY depending on it...
