 Here&apos;s a short list of jobs in the U.S. which you can create to generate income:

1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.

2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor&apos;s equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.

3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.

4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.

5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.

6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a&quot;For Lease/Rental&quot;sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.

7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one&apos;s hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.

Good luck!

 You are on the bottom of the over 2 million people that are unemployed. Employers are hiring(if they are) people with skills and experience and are more stable in their lives. They have families to support and mortgages to pay. Also with more businesses closing their doors and laying off people, you are better taking any job you can get even if it is in fast foods. See if they have direct deposit so you can&apos;t spend your check on food!!

 Culver&apos;s minimum hiring age is 14 with a workers permit.

I called many stores because I am 14 looking for a job. This was the response they gave which makes me happy after looking for so long.

Find a local one go online and apply and go in store to apply or call and ask if they are hiring.


What I did was Google a bunch of business near my home and found their numbers using Google maps or their sites and I called and directly asked if they are hiring and what age do they hire at.

Try local grocery stores, pizza parlors, retail stores, fast food restaurants.

 The best thing I can think of for a person your age is get a lawn mower and start advertising that you will mow and blow every yard for $15-25 in your neighborhood then surrounding neighborhoods. Then add more for extra services {painting ecd.}.

Get your contractors license part time and you can do more, charge more and employee more people.

If you are really a self starter do some internet marketing for all your businesses.

I would be glad to help if you need it.
