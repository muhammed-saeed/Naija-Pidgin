Clinic Touted As Fast Food For Healthcare

 POSTED: 2:22 pm EDT September 26, 2005 UPDATED: 4:35 pm EDT September 26, 2005 
 A drug store chain now includes fast food style health clinics in several central Indiana locations.

In-store health care is now available at select CVS pharmacies, where customers can do more than fill a prescription, Staying Healthy&apos;s Stacia Matthews reported.

The MinuteClinic offers quick, cheap and convenient routine health procedures.
 


&quot;It&apos;s very easy and convenient just like fast food. However, just as you wouldn&apos;t go to McDonald&apos;s and order fillet Mignon, you would not come here and get your appendix out,&quot; said Cathy Clodfelter, of MinuteClinic.

There aren&apos;t doctors at the MinuteClinics. Instead, board-certified nurse practitioners are trained to diagnose, treat and write prescriptions for 20 common illnesses clearly stated on a menu board. The prices are listed, so customers know the costs upfront.

&quot;Just like at a fast food restaurant -- you know what you&apos;re getting and you get the same thing every time you go. It&apos;s the same way here,&quot; Clodfelter said.

Dave Price is in between jobs and currently uninsured. He came to MinuteClinic in search of low-cost care for pink eye.

The antibiotic he was using wasn&apos;t working and his symptoms got progressively worse.

MinuteClinic nurses determined Price&apos;s condition was too complex. Nurses referred him to a doctor for further evaluation.

But, Price appreciated the fact that no appointment was necessary and that his visit lasted 15 minutes.

Price said consumers who can&apos;t afford to take time off work will like the clinic&apos;s longer hours.

&quot;I think it&apos;s a great idea, and with the appropriate conditions, it would be really good option,&quot; Price said.

MinuteClinic fees are covered for people who are insured with Cigna or United Health Care

MinuteClinic health care centers in the Indianapolis area are located in CVS stores in the following locations:


 86th&amp;Ditch Road, Greenbriar 96th&amp;Allisonville Road, Indianapolis South Meridian&amp;County Line Road, Indianapolis 9805 Geist Crossing Drive, Indianapolis 5026 West US 52, New Palestine 3280 State Road 32E, Westfield 1466 W. Oak Street, Zionsville
