Woman sentenced for spree, stabbing

26-year-old pleads guilty to felonies as part of agreement

March 8, 2011

MARTINSBURG - A co-defendant in a local crime spree last year, including the stabbing of a man during an armed robbery, pleaded guilty Monday to one count of forgery of a credit card and conspiracy to commit robbery.

Falon Sue Mauck, 26, who is currently incarcerated at Eastern Regional Jail, also entered a plea of no contest to one misdemeanor count of breaking and entering of an automobile as part of the agreement.

She was sentenced by West Virginia 23rd Judicial Circuit Judge Gray Silver III to one to 10 years in prison on the forgery conviction and one to five years in prison on the conspiracy conviction. Mauck was granted credit for time already served on the misdemeanor conviction as part of the agreement.

In addition, the court ordered Mauck be jointly liable for $32,387 in medical expenses incurred by the victim stabbed in the armed robbery.

She was originally indicted by a Berkeley County grand jury in October 2010 on 14 counts. The remaining counts of her indictment were dismissed as a result of her cooperation with authorities in the prosecution of 31-year-old Joshua Daniel Stevens, also incarcerated at Eastern Regional Jail, who was named in a 28-count criminal indictment last October in connection with last year&apos;s crime spree.

The crime spree included an arson at a vacant Martinsburg home and the armed robbery Mauck took part in.

The forgery charge Mauck pleaded guilty to was related to an incident in which she attempted to use a stolen credit card at a local fast food restaurant, while the misdemeanor conviction was related to the theft of the card itself from the victim&apos;s vehicle. The conspiracy charge Mauck pleaded guilty to stemmed from the March 27, 2010, armed robbery in Falling Waters during which Stevens is accused of stabbing a man in the back.

In that case, Mauck admitted Monday to assisting in the robbery by holding down the victim during the incident, hampering the victim&apos;s attempted escape. As he tried to flee, Stevens stabbed him before he and Mauck chased the victim into a nearby wooded area where he fell to the ground, Assistant Berkeley County Prosecuting Attorney Carmela Cesare told the court Monday.

The victim was subsequently flown to Inova Fairfax Hospital in Virginia. He later identified Stevens from a photograph. As a result of Mauck&apos;s cooperation, the state was able to secure a separate plea agreement that could see Stevens plead guilty to a total of 10 counts of his indictment, resulting in a potential maximum sentence of 71 years in prison. The court will decide whether or not to accept the agreement during a change of plea hearing scheduled for March 28.

Stevens&apos; arrest came after he allegedly was involved in an April 24, 2010, arson at a vacant Central Avenue home.
