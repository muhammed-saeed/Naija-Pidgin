		McDonald&apos;s Loses Lakeshore Beef 

By Rae Doyle

The SF Board of Appeals voted against an appeal by McDonald&apos;s April 23 to overturn 
 a determination by SF Planning Department Zoning Administrator Larry Badiner.

On behalf of McDonald&apos;s, Walter Wong, of Jaidin Consulting, had appealed Badiner&apos;s 
 determination that a hamburger fast-food restaurant was not a permitted use 
 under Lakeshore Plaza&apos;s Conditional Use Permit (CUP) in a letter dated July 
 26, 2002. Badiner advised Wong that a fast-food hamburger restaurant would require 
 a specific modification to the original permit getting the approval of the Planning 
 Department and SF Board of Supervisors.

Jaidin Consulting had sought a short cut to that process by presenting an argument 
 for the Board of Appeal&apos;s consideration that, under the CUP stipulations, a 
 sandwich restaurant is an acceptable use at the plaza and a hamburger is a sandwich.

On Oct. 30, 2002, the Board of Appeals agreed and voted four to one to overturn 
 Badiner&apos;s determination, clearing the way for a McDonald&apos;s restaurant at Lakeshore 
 Plaza.

After the hearing, Commissioner Douglas Shoemaker was concerned because there 
 had been no community input on an issue that has been vigorously opposed by 
 the Lakeshore Plaza community in the past. He placed a request for a rehearing 
 on the Nov. 20, 2002 calendar; notice of that hearing reached the community 
 on Nov. 19, 2002.

This time the community responded. On 24-hour notice, 30 people attended with 
 their comments. Because of the public input, a rehearing was scheduled for the 
 next month, a move unprecedented in the Board of Appeal&apos;s history, according 
 to President Arnold Chin.

Subsequently, Wong asked for two continuances in order to negotiate with the 
 community. MMI, the plaza&apos;s property management company, approached SF Supervisor 
 Tony Hall with a proposition to present to the community: MMI would agree not 
 to lease to McDonald&apos;s if the community would agree not to oppose a family-style 
 restaurant that serves hamburgers. By this time, McDonald&apos;s had withdrawn from 
 the appeal and was no longer negotiating for a lease.

Members of Lakeshore Plaza Improvement Club, Merced Manor, Pine Lake Improvement 
 Club and other groups from nearby neighborhoods, including the West of Twin 
 Peaks Central Council, rejected MMI&apos;s offer, preferring that the process that 
 had begun before the Board of Appeals play out.

Thwarted in his effort to get agreement from the neighborhood groups for a 
 family-style hamburger restaurant, Hall set out to prove that the dissenting 
 group of neighbors did not represent the majority of Sunset residents. After 
 asking for community input in his West Portal Monthly column, Hall testified 
 at the April 23 hearing that he received 48 responses for approval and two that 
 did not approve. Hall told the Board of Appeals members that he &quot;represented 
 the words and views of the silent majority who are intimidated by the loud voices 
 of the few.&quot;

At an April 10 Town Hall meeting hosted by the Lakeshore Acres Improvement 
 Club more than one-third (37 out of 100 attendees) indicated they did not oppose 
 a family-style restaurant serving hamburgers. However, opposition to McDonald&apos;s 
 was unanimous.

Assemblyman Leland Yee attended the Town Hill Meeting and lent his support 
 to upholding the CUP.

&quot;No one can come into Lakeshore Plaza and decide what to do there without the 
 permission of the people who will approve the conditions upon which they must 
 behave,&quot; Yee said. District 4 Supervisor Fiona Ma also spoke in opposition to 
 McDonald&apos;s attempt to circumvent the CUP process.

At the Town Hall Meeting, Bill Chionsini, a member of the Lakeshore Acres Improvement 
 Club and president of the West of Twin Peaks Central Council, explained that 
 the community wants the plaza to be economically viable.

&quot;The neighbors want to keep the plaza from deteriorating - and also want the 
 City to have the tax revenues generated by the businesses in the plaza,&quot; he 
 said.

At the April 23 hearing, the Board of Appeals heard public comments that included 
 two former SF Supervisors. District Attorney Terrence Hallinan had been on the 
 Board of Supervisors in 1988 when the original Conditional Use Permit was heard. 
 He said he listened to hours and hours of opposition to a hamburger fast-food 
 restaurant being included in the permitted uses at the plaza.

Maintaining that the integrity of the CUP process was at the heart of the issue, 
 former supervisor Annemarie Conroy questioned why the issue was now before the 
 Board of Appeals.

At the April 23 hearing, a minimum vote of four to one was required to overturn 
 Badiner&apos;s determination. Board member Hisashi Sugaya commented that the question 
 of whether a hamburger is a sandwich or not was silly and he voted against the 
 appeal. Douglas Shoemaker and Sabrina Saunders also voted against it. Vice-President 
 Kathleen Harrington and President Arnold Chin voted to overturn the determination.

With a vote of three to two, the zoning administrator&apos;s determination was not 
 overturned. An SF Planning Department spokesperson provided information about 
 how the planning code defined a full-service restaurant that may make it possible 
 for a family-style restaurant that serves hamburgers to be a permitted use. 
 There are two &quot;non-fast food&quot; criteria: the customer must be served, rather 
 than pick up food at a counter, and they must pay after they eat.
