 Bryan Can an employer refuse to give you your pay check? 
 i work at a combination A&amp;W Longjohn Silvers. (im only 19, working my way through engineering school, dont judge) i get payed on fridays. i went to work at about 11:30 to get my paycheck and noticed that everyone was busy and there were alot of customers. i left because my manager has an aneurysm when we try to get our checks when they are busy, which is perfectly understandable. i went home for about an hour and drove by again to see that there weren&apos;t very many customers, and most of the people working were just standing around talking. i walked in and requested my paycheck. my manager responded&quot;Bryan, you know i can&apos;t go get your check when we are busy.&quot;having heard this about 20 times before, i leaned over the counter and saw that there were no orders on the readout screen for the drivethrough or the dining room, meaning that they were not busy, at all... after about five minutes of argument in front of about 10 customers and being called an asshole a total of 3 time and being told once that someone should punch me in the face, she finally gave me my check.

just for future reference: Is it legal in New York State for an employer to withold pay for ANY ammount of time?

please include reputable sources

 No that isn&apos;t legal. You need to discuss this issue with the other employees because I am certain you are not the only one annoyed by this practice. If you get your co-workers to voice a complaint your chances of making things better are greatly improved.
In response to the people who say you are lucky to still have your job that is total BS. If you are mistreated and miserable at your job find another one. No one who hates dealing with there boss is lucky to have that job.

 The employer can set the time of day you are allowed to pick up your check. We often held checks until the end of the work day. If I were him I think I would chose to mail them out that would stop people from coming in at bad times to pick up their checks.

You should know that just because there are no orders up it does not mean they were not busy. And if it was right after the lunch rush as you say I&apos;m sure they were busy cleaning and getting ready for the dinner run. And if you have been told 20 times before why in the world would you ask for your check @ 12:30 the height of the lunch rush! Restaurants don&apos;t calm down until at least 1:30 or 2:00.

 Wow! I&apos;m so glad I live in the UK. This sort of thing would never be allowed to happen over here.

1, Its just about as illegal as you can get in employment law

2, If anything like this ever happened, all the workers would stop what they&apos;re doing and walk out, refusing to work until the situation was resolved, and promises made that it would never happen again.

 I am in the UK and was lucky enough to work for companies that had a proper pay routine. No cheques to get lost and always paid through into my bank account. On Bank Holidays the money went in the week before. You should be paid on a regular day each week or day each month and providing the company are organized probably at a set time, certainly before you are due to leave at the end of that day or the end of your shift. You cannot demand it if you are still within the alotted time, only make a note of dates when payments were not made on time. Then complain!

I do not think with holding money is legal. Do you have a work contract? We can obtain legal help from a Union or Citizens Advice who have good legal packages in many areas of law. It is free, maybe seek out an approved equivalent body. You would have a legal case if your contract listed specific details of your pay arrangements but I expect if you do have one it will be the wage and payday/date only. Check it out!:)

Additional details comment

Never be too confident about keeping your job, everyone is dispendable even close ties outside work does not make you immune! You obviously have dynamics not easily understood by those other than those working with you. Be civil and professional and she cannot refuse you a good reference. Stay within the law always. That engineering qualification is more important than the current job. That is much more important or should be! Good Luck :)

 They have to pay you on the normal payday. there is nothing in the law which defines WHEN on the payday they have to pay you. As long as the check is available at some reasonable time that day, it&apos;s legal.

It&apos;s probably irrelevant, because I doubt you work there anymore if you took the attitude you did.

 Your employer has to pay you on regularly scheduled pay days. The law does not require they pay you at a specific time.

If you escalated the issue to that level you are lucky if you don&apos;t get fired.

 i know some places they wait until 3pm to give ur check but i dont think she can just hold it cuz she wants to.even if they are busy, how hard is it to hand someone a check and be done with it.sounds like a ********* to me...good luck with that!

 Well they can arguably with hold your check until close of business. You should have let her refuse and walked away. The employer could possibly been liable to pay you an hourly wage until you received your check.

But the verbal abuse and threats can be easily considered harrassment. Report her to the district supervisor and contact the labor board. I&apos;d even see an attorney. You may be able to stop working and get enough cash to pay for college up front.

Normally I wouldn&apos;t condone a lawsuit but the fact that this lady manages a fast food restaurant and treats her employers with such abuse is absurd!

 Yes, there is no law in NY that states that you need to receive your paycheck at a certain time. As long as you get it on that day, there isn&apos;t a problem. If they decide not to pay you at all or delay it a couple of days, that&apos;s a problem. NY is also an&quot;employment at will&quot;state so they can fire you for no reason. Hope you keep you job after that disagreement. Good luck
