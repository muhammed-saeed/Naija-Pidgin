Company Perspectives:

McDonald&apos;s is the world&apos;s leading food service organization. We generate more than $40 billion in Systemwide sales. We operate over 30,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries on six continents. We have the benefits that come with scale and a strong financial position. We own one of the world&apos;s most recognized and respected brands. We have an unparalleled global infrastructure and competencies in restaurant operations, real estate, retailing, marketing and franchising. We are a leader in the area of social responsibility. We actively share our knowledge and expertise in food safety and are committed to protecting the environment for future generations. Yet, we have not achieved our growth expectations for the past several years. So, our challenge is to leverage our strengths to profitably serve more customers more ways more often.

Since its incorporation in 1955, McDonald&apos;s Corporation has not only become the world&apos;s largest quick-service restaurant organization, but has literally changed Americans&apos; eating habits--and increasingly the habits of non-Americans as well. On an average day, more than 46 million people eat at one of the company&apos;s more than 31,000 restaurants, which are located in 119 countries on six continents. About 9,000 of the restaurants are company owned and operated; the remainder are run either by franchisees or through joint ventures with local businesspeople. Systemwide sales (which encompass total revenues from all three types of restaurants) totaled more than $46 billion in 2003. Nine major markets--Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States--account for 80 percent of the restaurants and 75 percent of overall sales. The vast majority of the company&apos;s restaurants are of the flagship McDonald&apos;s hamburger joint variety. Two other wholly owned chains, Boston Market (rotisserie chicken) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (Mexican fast casual), along with Pret A Manger (upscale prepared sandwiches), in which McDonald&apos;s owns a 33 percent stake, account for about 1,000 of the units.

In 1954 Ray Kroc, a seller of Multimixer milkshake machines, learned that brothers Richard and Maurice (Dick and Mac) McDonald were using eight of his high-tech Multimixers in their San Bernardino, California, restaurant. His curiosity was piqued, and he went to San Bernardino to take a look at the McDonalds&apos; restaurant.

The McDonalds had been in the restaurant business since the 1930s. In 1948 they closed down a successful carhop drive-in to establish the streamlined operation Ray Kroc saw in 1954. The menu was simple: hamburgers, cheeseburgers, french fries, shakes, soft drinks, and apple pie. The carhops were eliminated to make McDonald&apos;s a self-serve operation, and there were no tables to sit at, no jukebox , and no telephone. As a result, McDonald&apos;s attracted families rather than teenagers. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the restaurant was the efficiency with which the McDonald&apos;s workers did their jobs. Mac and Dick McDonald had taken great care in setting up their kitchen. Each worker&apos;s steps had been carefully choreographed, like an assembly line, to ensure maximum efficiency. The savings in preparation time, and the resulting increase in volume, allowed the McDonalds to lower the price of a hamburger from 30 cents to 15 cents.

Believing that the McDonald formula was a ticket to success, Kroc suggested that they franchise their restaurants throughout the country. When they hesitated to take on this additional burden, Kroc volunteered to do it for them. He returned to his home outside of Chicago with rights to set up McDonald&apos;s restaurants throughout the country, except in a handful of territories in California and Arizona already licensed by the McDonald brothers.

Kroc&apos;s first McDonald&apos;s restaurant opened in Des Plaines, Illinois, near Chicago, on April 15, 1955--the same year that Kroc incorporated his company as McDonald&apos;s Corporation. As with any new venture, Kroc encountered a number of hurdles. The first was adapting the McDonald&apos;s building design to a northern climate. A basement had to be installed to house a furnace , and adequate ventilation was difficult, as exhaust fans sucked out warm air in the winter, and cool air in the summer.

Most frustrating of all, however, was Kroc&apos;s initial failure to reproduce the McDonalds&apos; delicious french fries. When Kroc and his crew duplicated the brothers&apos; method--leaving just a little peel for flavor, cutting the potatoes into shoestrings, and rinsing the strips in cold water--the fries turned into mush . After repeated telephone conversations with the McDonald brothers and several consultations with the Potato and Onion Association, Kroc pinpointed the cause of the soggy spuds. The McDonald brothers stored their potatoes outside in wire bins, and the warm California breeze dried them out and cured them, slowly turning the sugars into starch . In order to reproduce the superior taste of these potatoes, Kroc devised a system using an electric fan to dry the potatoes in a similar way. He also experimented with a blanching process. Within three months he had a french fry that was, in his opinion, slightly superior in taste to the McDonald brothers&apos; fries.

Once the Des Plaines restaurant was operational, Kroc sought franchisees for his McDonald&apos;s chain. The first snag came quickly. In 1956 he discovered that the McDonald brothers had licensed the franchise rights for Cook County, Illinois (home of Chicago and many of its suburbs) to the Frejlack Ice Cream Company. Kroc was incensed that the McDonalds had not informed him of this arrangement. He purchased the rights back for $25,000--five times what the Frejlacks had originally paid--and pressed forward.

Kroc decided early on that it was best to first establish the restaurants and then to franchise them out, so that he could control the uniformity of the stores. Early McDonald&apos;s restaurants were situated in the suburbs. Corner lots were usually in greater demand because gas stations and shops competed for them, but Kroc preferred lots in the middle of blocks to accommodate his U-shaped parking lots. Since these lots were cheaper, Kroc could give franchisees a price break.

McDonald&apos;s grew slowly for its first three years; by 1958 there were 34 restaurants. In 1959, however, Kroc opened 67 new restaurants, bringing the total to more than 100.

Kroc had decided at the outset that McDonald&apos;s would not be a supplier to its franchisees--his background in sales warned him that such an arrangement could lead to lower quality for the sake of higher profits. He also had determined that the company should at no time own more than 30 percent of all McDonald&apos;s restaurants. He knew, however, that his success depended upon his franchisees&apos; success, and he was determined to help them in any way that he could.

In 1960 the McDonald&apos;s advertising campaign &quot;Look for the Golden Arches&quot; gave sales a big boost. Kroc believed that advertising was an investment that would in the end come back many times over, and advertising has always played a key role in the development of the McDonald&apos;s Corporation--indeed, McDonald&apos;s ads have been some of the most identifiable over the years. In 1962 McDonald&apos;s replaced its &quot;Speedee&quot; the hamburger man symbol with its now world-famous Golden Arches logo. A year later, the company sold its billionth hamburger and introduced Ronald McDonald, a red-haired clown with particular appeal to children.

In the early 1960s, McDonald&apos;s really began to take off. The growth in U.S. automobile use that came with suburbanization contributed heavily to McDonald&apos;s success. In 1961 Kroc bought out the McDonald brothers for $2.7 million, aiming at making McDonald&apos;s the number one fast-food chain in the country.

In 1965 McDonald&apos;s Corporation went public. Common shares were offered at $22.50 per share; by the end of the first day&apos;s trading the price had shot up to $30. A block of 100 shares purchased for $2,250 in 1965 was worth, after 12 stock splits (increasing the number of shares to 74,360), about $1.8 million by the end of 2003. In 1985 McDonald&apos;s Corporation became one of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

McDonald&apos;s success in the 1960s was in large part due to the company&apos;s skillful marketing and flexible response to customer demand. In 1965 the Filet-o-Fish sandwich, billed as &quot;the fish that catches people,&quot; was introduced in McDonald&apos;s restaurants. The new item had originally met with disapproval from Kroc, but after its successful test marketing, he eventually agreed to add it. Another item that Kroc had backed a year previously, a burger with a slice of pineapple and a slice of cheese, known as a &quot;hulaburger,&quot; had flopped. The market was not quite ready for Kroc&apos;s taste; the hulaburger&apos;s tenure on the McDonald&apos;s menu board was short. In 1968 the now legendary Big Mac made its debut, and in 1969 McDonald&apos;s sold its five billionth hamburger. A year later, as it launched the &quot;You Deserve a Break Today&quot; advertising campaign, McDonald&apos;s restaurants had reached all 50 states.

In 1968 McDonald&apos;s opened its 1,000th restaurant, and Fred Turner became the company&apos;s president and chief administrative officer. Kroc became chairman and remained CEO until 1973. Turner had originally intended to open a McDonald&apos;s franchise, but when he had problems with his backers over a location, he went to work as a grillman for Kroc in 1956. As operations vice-president, Turner helped new franchisees get their stores up and running. He was constantly looking for new ways to perfect the McDonald&apos;s system, experimenting, for example, to determine the maximum number of hamburger patties one could stack in a box without squashing them and pointing out that seconds could be saved if McDonald&apos;s used buns that were presliced all the way through and were not stuck together in the package. Such attention to detail was one reason for the company&apos;s extraordinary success.

McDonald&apos;s spectacular growth continued in the 1970s. Americans were more on-the-go than ever, and fast service was a priority. In 1972 the company passed $1 billion in annual sales; by 1976, McDonald&apos;s had served 20 billion hamburgers, and systemwide sales exceeded $3 billion.

McDonald&apos;s pioneered breakfast fast food with the introduction of the Egg McMuffin in 1973 when market research indicated that a quick breakfast would be welcomed by consumers. Five years later the company added a full breakfast line to the menu, and by 1987 one-fourth of all breakfasts eaten out in the United States came from McDonald&apos;s restaurants.

Kroc was a firm believer in giving &quot;something back into the community where you do business.&quot; In 1974 McDonald&apos;s acted upon that philosophy in an original way by opening the first Ronald McDonald House, in Philadelphia, to provide a &quot;home away from home&quot; for the families of children in nearby hospitals. Twelve years after this first house opened, 100 similar Ronald McDonald Houses were in operation across the United States.

In 1975 McDonald&apos;s opened its first drive-thru window in Oklahoma City. This service gave Americans a fast, convenient way to procure a quick meal. The company&apos;s goal was to provide service in 50 seconds or less. Drive-thru sales eventually accounted for more than half of McDonald&apos;s systemwide sales. Meantime, the Happy Meal, a combo meal for children featuring a toy, was added to the menu in 1979.

In the late 1970s competition from other hamburger chains such as Burger King and Wendy&apos;s began to intensify . Experts believed that the fast-food industry had gotten as big as it ever would, so the companies began to battle fiercely for market share. A period of aggressive advertising campaigns and price slashing in the early 1980s became known as the &quot;burger wars.&quot; Burger King suggested that customers &quot;have it their way&quot;; Wendy&apos;s offered itself as the &quot;fresh alternative&quot; and asked of other restaurants, &quot;where&apos;s the beef?&quot; But McDonald&apos;s sales and market share continued to grow. Consumers seemed to like the taste and consistency of McDonald&apos;s best.

During the 1980s McDonald&apos;s further diversified its menu to suit changing consumer tastes. Chicken McNuggets were introduced in 1983, and by the end of the year McDonald&apos;s was the second largest retailer of chicken in the world. In 1987 ready-to-eat salads were introduced to lure more health-conscious consumers. The 1980s were the fastest-paced decade yet. Efficiency, combined with an expanded menu, continued to draw customers. McDonald&apos;s, already entrenched in the suburbs, began to focus on urban centers and introduced new architectural styles. Although McDonald&apos;s restaurants no longer looked identical, the company made sure food quality and service remained constant.

Despite experts&apos; claims that the fast-food industry was saturated, McDonald&apos;s continued to expand. The first generation raised on restaurant food had grown up. Eating out had become a habit rather than a break in the routine, and McDonald&apos;s relentless marketing continued to improve sales. Innovative promotions, such as the &quot;when the U.S. wins, you win&quot; giveaways during the Olympic Games in 1988, were a huge success.

In 1982 Michael R. Quinlan became president of McDonald&apos;s Corporation and Fred Turner became chairman. Quinlan, who took over as CEO in 1987, had started at McDonald&apos;s in the mailroom in 1963, and gradually worked his way up. The first McDonald&apos;s CEO to hold an M.B.A. degree, Quinlan was regarded by his colleagues as a shrewd competitor. In his first year as CEO the company opened 600 new restaurants.

McDonald&apos;s growth in the United States was mirrored by its stunning growth abroad. By 1991, 37 percent of systemwide sales came from restaurants outside the United States. McDonald&apos;s opened its first foreign restaurant in British Columbia, Canada, in 1967. By the early 1990s the company had established itself in 58 foreign countries and operated more than 3,600 restaurants outside the United States, through wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, and franchise agreements. Its strongest foreign markets were Japan, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Australia, and France.

In the mid-1980s, McDonald&apos;s, like other traditional employers of teenagers, was faced with a shortage of labor in the United States. The company met this challenge by being the first to entice retirees back into the workforce . McDonald&apos;s placed great emphasis on effective training. It opened its Hamburger University in 1961 to train franchisees and corporate decision-makers. By 1990, more than 40,000 people had received &quot;Bachelor of Hamburgerology&quot; degrees from the 80-acre Oak Brook, Illinois, facility. The corporation opened a Hamburger University in Tokyo in 1971, in Munich in 1975, and in London in 1982.

Braille menus were first introduced in 1979, and picture menus in 1988. In March 1992 Braille and picture menus were reintroduced to acknowledge the 37 million Americans with vision, speech, or hearing impairments .

Quinlan continued to experiment with new technology and to research new markets to keep McDonald&apos;s in front of its competition. Clamshell fryers, which cooked both sides of a hamburger simultaneously, were tested. New locations such as hospitals and military bases were tapped as sites for new restaurants. In response to the increase in microwave oven usage, McDonald&apos;s, whose name is the single most advertised brand name in the world, stepped up advertising and promotional expenditures stressing that its taste was superior to quick-packaged foods.

McRecycle USA began in 1990 and included a commitment to purchase at least $100 million worth of recycled products annually for use in construction, remodeling , and equipping restaurants. Chairs, table bases, table tops, eating counters, table columns, waste receptacles, corrugated cartons, packaging, and washroom tissue were all made from recycled products. McDonald&apos;s worked with the U.S. Environmental Defense Fund to develop a comprehensive solid waste reduction program. Wrapping burgers in paper rather than plastic led to a 90 percent reduction in the wrapping material waste stream.

It took McDonald&apos;s 33 years to open its first 10,000 restaurants--the 10,000th unit opened in April 1988. Incredibly, the company reached the 20,000-restaurant mark in only eight more years, in mid-1996. By the end of 1997 the total had surpassed 23,000--by that time McDonald&apos;s was opening 2,000 new restaurants each year--an average of one every five hours.

Much of the growth of the 1990s came outside the United States, with international units increasing from about 3,600 in 1991 to more than 11,000 by 1998. The number of countries with McDonald&apos;s outlets nearly doubled from 59 in 1991 to 114 in late 1998. In 1993 a new region was added to the empire when the first McDonald&apos;s in the Middle East opened in Tel Aviv , Israel. As the company entered new markets, it showed increasing flexibility with respect to local food preferences and customs. In Israel, for example, the first kosher McDonald&apos;s opened in a Jerusalem suburb in 1995. In Arab countries the restaurant chain used &quot;Halal&quot; menus, which complied with Islamic laws for food preparation. In 1996 McDonald&apos;s entered India for the first time, where it offered a Big Mac made with lamb called the Maharaja Mac. That same year the first McSki-Thru opened in Lindvallen, Sweden.

Overall, the company derived increasing percentages of its revenue and income from outside the United States. In 1992 about two-thirds of systemwide sales came out of U.S. McDonald&apos;s, but by 1997 that figure was down to about 51 percent. Similarly, the operating income numbers showed a reduction from about 60 percent derived from the United States in 1992 to 42.5 percent in 1997.

In the United States, where the number of units grew from 9,000 in 1991 to 12,500 in 1997--an increase of about 40 percent--the growth was perhaps excessive. Although the additional units increased market share in some markets, a number of franchisees complained that new units were cannibalizing sales from existing ones. Same-store sales for outlets open for more than one year were flat in the mid-1990s, a reflection of both the greater number of units and the mature nature of the U.S. market.

It did not help that the company made several notable blunders in the United States in the 1990s. The McLean Deluxe sandwich, which featured a 91 percent fat-free beef patty, was introduced in 1991, never really caught on, and was dropped from the menu in 1996. Several other 1990s-debuted menu items--including fried chicken, pasta , fajitas, and pizza--failed as well. The &quot;grown-up&quot; (and pricey ) Arch Deluxe sandwich and the Deluxe Line were launched in 1996 in a $200 million campaign to gain the business of more adults, but were bombs. The following spring brought a 55-cent Big Mac promotion, which many customers either rejected outright or were confused by because the burgers had to be purchased with full-priced fries and a drink. The promotion embittered still more franchisees, whose complaints led to its withdrawal. In July 1997 McDonald&apos;s fired its main ad agency--Leo Burnett, a 15-year McDonald&apos;s partner--after the nostalgic &quot;My McDonald&apos;s&quot; campaign proved a failure. A seemingly weakened McDonald&apos;s was the object of a Burger King offensive when the rival fast-food maker launched the Big King sandwich, a Big Mac clone. Meanwhile, internal taste tests revealed that customers preferred the fare at Wendy&apos;s and Burger King.

In response to these difficulties, McDonald&apos;s drastically cut back on its U.S. expansion--in contrast to the 1,130 units opened in 1995, only about 400 new McDonald&apos;s were built in 1997. Plans to open hundreds of smaller restaurants in Wal-Marts and gasoline stations were abandoned because test sites did not meet targeted goals. Reacting to complaints from franchisees about poor communication with the corporation and excess bureaucracy , the head of McDonald&apos;s U.S.A. (Jack Greenberg, who had assumed the position in October 1996) reorganized the unit into five autonomous geographic divisions. The aim was to bring management and decision-making closer to franchisees and customers.

On the marketing side, McDonald&apos;s scored big in 1997 with a Teenie Beanie Baby promotion in which about 80 million of the toys/collectibles were gobbled up virtually overnight. The chain received some bad publicity, however, when it was discovered that a number of customers purchased Happy Meals just to get the toys and threw the food away. For a similar spring 1998 Teenie Beanie giveaway, the company altered the promotion to allow patrons to buy menu items other than kids&apos; meals. McDonald&apos;s also began to benefit from a ten-year global marketing alliance signed with Disney in 1996. Initial Disney movies promoted by McDonald&apos;s included 101 Dalmatians, Flubber, Mulan, Armageddon, and A Bug&apos;s Life. Perhaps the most important marketing move came in the later months of 1997 when McDonald&apos;s named BDD Needham as its new lead ad agency. Needham had been the company&apos;s agency in the 1970s and was responsible for the hugely successful &quot;You Deserve a Break Today&quot; campaign. Late in 1997 McDonald&apos;s launched the Needham-designed &quot;Did Somebody Say McDonald&apos;s?&quot; campaign, which appeared to be an improvement over its predecessors.

Following the difficulties of the early and mid-1990s, several moves in 1998 seemed to indicate a reinvigorated McDonald&apos;s. In February the company for the first time took a stake in another fast-food chain when it purchased a minority interest in the 16-unit, Colorado-based Chipotle Mexican Grill chain. The following month came the announcement that McDonald&apos;s would improve the taste of several sandwiches and introduce several new menu items; McFlurry desserts--developed by a Canadian franchisee--proved popular when launched in the United States in the summer of 1998. McDonald&apos;s that same month said that it would overhaul its food preparation system in every U.S. restaurant. The new just-in-time system, dubbed &quot;Made for You,&quot; was in development for a number of years and aimed to deliver to customers &quot; fresher , hotter food&quot;; enable patrons to receive special-order sandwiches (a perk long offered by rivals Burger King and Wendy&apos;s); and allow new menu items to be more easily introduced thanks to the system&apos;s enhanced flexibility. The expensive changeover was expected to cost about $25,000 per restaurant, with McDonald&apos;s offering to pay for about half of the cost; the company planned to provide about $190 million in financial assistance to its franchisees before implementation was completed by year-end 1999.

In May 1998 Greenberg was named president and CEO of McDonald&apos;s Corporation, with Quinlan remaining chairman; at the same time Alan D. Feldman, who had joined the company only four years earlier from Pizza Hut , replaced Greenberg as president of McDonald&apos;s U.S.A.--an unusual move for a company whose executives typically were long-timers. The following month brought another first--McDonald&apos;s first job cuts--as the company said it would eliminate 525 employees from its headquarters staff, a cut of about 23 percent. In the second quarter of 1998 McDonald&apos;s took a $160 million charge in relation to the cuts. As a result, the company, for the first time since it went public in 1965, recorded a decrease in net income, from $1.64 billion in 1997 to $1.55 billion in 1998.

McDonald&apos;s followed up its investment in Chipotle with several more moves beyond the burger business. In March 1999 the company bought Aroma Café, a U.K. chain of 23 upscale coffee and sandwich shops. In July of that year McDonald&apos;s added Donatos Pizza Inc., a midwestern chain of 143 pizzerias based in Columbus, Ohio. Donatos had 1997 revenues of $120 million. Also in 1999, McDonald&apos;s 25,000th unit opened, Greenberg took on the additional post of chairman, and Jim Cantalupo was named company president. Cantalupo, who had joined the company as controller in 1974 and later became head of McDonald&apos;s International, had been vice-chairman, a position he retained. In May 2000 McDonald&apos;s completed its largest acquisition yet, buying the bankrupt Boston Market chain for $173.5 million in cash and debt. At the time, there were more than 850 Boston Market outlets, which specialized in home-style meals, with rotisserie chicken the lead menu item. Revenue at Boston Market during 1999 totaled $670 million. McDonald&apos;s rounded out its acquisition spree in early 2001 by buying a 33 percent stake in Pret A Manger, an upscale urban-based chain specializing in ready-to-eat sandwiches made on the premises. There were more than 110 Pret shops in the United Kingdom and several more in New York City. Also during 2001, McDonald&apos;s sold off Aroma Café and took its McDonald&apos;s Japan affiliate public, selling a minority stake through an initial public offering.

As it was exploring new avenues of growth, however, McDonald&apos;s core hamburger chain had become plagued by problems. Most prominently, the Made for You system backfired. Although many franchisees believed that it succeeded in improving the quality of the food, it also increased service times and proved labor-intensive. Some franchisees also complained that the actual cost of implementing the system ran much higher than the corporation had estimated, a charge that McDonald&apos;s contested. In any case, there was no question that Made for You failed to reverse the chain&apos;s sluggish sales. Growth in sales at stores open more than a year (known as same-store sales) fell in both 2000 and 2001. Late in 2001 the company launched a restructuring involving the elimination of about 850 positions, 700 of which were in the United States, and some store closings.

There were further black eyes as well. McDonald&apos;s was sued in 2001 after it was revealed that for flavoring purposes a small amount of beef extract was being added to the vegetable oil used to cook the french fries. The company had cooked its fries in beef tallow until 1990, when it began claiming in ads that it used 100 percent vegetable oil. McDonald&apos;s soon apologized for any &quot;confusion&quot; that had been caused by its use of the beef flavoring, and in mid-2002 it reached a settlement in the litigation , agreeing to donate $10 million to Hindu, vegetarian, and other affected groups. Also in 2001, further embarrassment came when 51 people were charged with conspiring to rig McDonald&apos;s game promotions over the course of several years. It was revealed that $24 million of winning McDonald&apos;s game tickets had been stolen as part of the scam. McDonald&apos;s was not implicated in the scheme, which centered on a worker at an outside company that had administered the promotions.

McDonald&apos;s also had to increasingly battle its public image as a purveyor of fatty, unhealthful food. Consumers began filing lawsuits contending that years of eating at McDonald&apos;s had made them overweight . McDonald&apos;s responded by introducing low-calorie menu items and switching to a more healthful cooking oil for its french fries. McDonald&apos;s franchises overseas became a favorite target of people and groups expressing anti-American and/or antiglobalization sentiments. In August 1999 a group of protesters led by farmer José Bové destroyed a half-built McDonald&apos;s restaurant in Millau, France. In 2002 Bové, who gained fame from the incident, served a three-month jail sentence for the act, which he said was in protest against U.S. trade protectionism. McDonald&apos;s was also one of three multinational corporations (along with Starbucks Corporation and Nike, Inc.) whose outlets in Seattle were attacked in late 1999 by some of the more aggressive protesters against a World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting taking place there. In the early 2000s McDonald&apos;s pulled out of several countries, including Bolivia and two Middle Eastern nations, at least in part because of the negative regard with which the brand was held in some areas.

Early in 2002 Cantalupo retired after 28 years of service. Sales remained lackluster that year, and in October the company attempted to revive U.S. sales through the introduction of a low-cost Dollar Menu. In December 2002, after this latest initiative to reignite sales growth failed--and also after profits fell in seven of the previous eight quarters--Greenberg announced that he would resign at the end of the year. Cantalupo came out of retirement to become chairman and CEO at the beginning of 2003.

Cantalupo started his tenure by announcing a major restructuring that involved the closure of more than 700 restaurants (mostly in the United States and Japan), the elimination of 600 jobs, and charges of $853 million. The charges resulted in a fourth-quarter 2002 loss of $343.8 million--the first quarterly loss in McDonald&apos;s 38 years as a public company. The new CEO also shifted away from the company&apos;s traditional reliance on growth through the opening of new units to a focus on gaining more sales from existing units. To that end, several new menu items were successfully launched, including entree salads, McGriddles breakfast sandwiches (which used pancakes in place of bread), and white-meat Chicken McNuggets. Some outlets began test-marketing fruits and vegetables as Happy Meal options. Backing up the new products was the launch in September 2003 of an MTV-style advertising campaign featuring the new tag line, &quot;I&apos;m lovin&apos; it.&quot; This was the first global campaign in McDonald&apos;s history, as the new slogan was to be used in advertising in more than 100 countries. It also proved to be the first truly successful ad campaign in years; sales began rebounding, helped also by improvements in service. In December 2003, for instance, same-store sales increased 7.3 percent. Same-store sales rose 2.4 percent for the entire year, after falling 2.1 percent in 2002.

In December 2003 McDonald&apos;s announced that it would further its focus on its core hamburger business by downsizing its other ventures. The company said that it would sell Donatos back to that chain&apos;s founder. In addition, it would discontinue development of non-McDonald&apos;s brands outside of the United States. This included Boston Market outlets in Canada and Australia and Donatos units in Germany. McDonald&apos;s kept its minority investment in Pret A Manger, but McDonald&apos;s Japan was slated to close its Pret units there. These moves would enable the company to concentrate its international efforts on the McDonald&apos;s chain, while reducing the non-hamburger brands in the United States to Chipotle and Boston Market, both of which were operating in the black.

McDonald&apos;s continued to curtail store openings in 2004 and to concentrate on building business at existing restaurants. Much of the more than $1.5 billion budgeted for capital expenditures in 2004 was slated to be used to remodel existing restaurants. McDonald&apos;s also aimed to pay down debt by $400 million to $700 million and to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Cantalupo also set several long-term goals, such as sustaining annual systemwide sales and revenue growth rates of 3 to 5 percent. In a move to both simplify the menu and make its offerings less fattening, McDonald&apos;s announced in March 2004 that it would phase out Super Size french fries and soft drinks by the end of the year.

(established 1948)
McDonald&apos;s, like Coca-Cola , Marlboro, and Levi Strauss , has become a highly prominent global brand symbolically associated with notions of an American consumer democracy and way of life. The distinctive ‘Golden Arches’ motif can be seen in about 120 countries, the 30,000th McDonald&apos;s restaurant opening in 2001. The origins of the company lay in the 1948 plans of Richard and Maurice McDonald to apply Fordist principles to the fast food business, concentrating on the production of a limited range of items, speedy service, and reduced labour costs. The two other key ingredients lay in a distinctive visual identity for the restaurants and the establishment of an effective franchising system. There is some debate about the origins of the striking ‘Golden Arches’ motif, with many histories accrediting its invention to the architect Stanley Meston, who was commissioned by McDonald&apos;s to design a number of their early franchised buildings. However, there is some evidence to suggest that it was Richard McDonald, highly sceptical of the architectural and design professions, who first sketched out the ‘Golden Arches’ and the colour scheme and assigned them to Meston for realization. The first franchised McDonald&apos;s restaurant with the distinctive ‘Golden Arch’ was designed by architect Stanley Meston and built in Downey, California, in 1953. Restored in 1997 and reopened with a museum and gift shop on site, it was deemed eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Often considered to be the first visually characteristic McDonald&apos;s restaurant was that constructed two years later in Des Plaines, Illinois, also designed by Meston, owned by the McDonald&apos;s franchise agent Ray Kroc. The growth of the company was rapid: by 1957 there were 37 McDonald&apos;s restaurants, by 1959 over 100, a figure that had doubled in 1960. The definitive McDonald&apos;s logo was created in 1968 by the Arcy Agency, based on the ‘Golden Arches’ of the buildings. The first McDonald&apos;s outside the USA was established in Canada in 1967, the beginnings of an international trend that has established major markets in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Australia, and Canada. The first McDonald&apos;s restaurant in Japan opened in Ginza, Tokyo, in 1971, and the number had grown to more than 2,400 by the early 21st century, making Japan the largest McDonald&apos;s market outside the USA. The first McDonald&apos;s restaurant on the African continent opened in Morocco in 1992 and in the Middle East in the following year. The first outlet in China was opened in 1992, with more than 80 in Beijing alone by the early 21st century. By the turn of the century eight out of the ten busiest McDonald&apos;s restaurants were outside the USA, the busiest being located on Pushkin Square, Moscow, serving 43,000 customers per day. Today, outlets can be found in airports (the first was in Changi Airport, Singapore, in 1981), educational institutions, museums, hospitals, and sports stadiums. However, although McDonald&apos;s has attempted to give many of its international outlets an indigenous, local identity through the menu and identification with community causes, the distinctive ‘Golden Arches’ did not always meet with acclaim. In Beijing, China, they were seen as part of an undesirable clutter of signage in the urban environment. In 2002 the city government ordered McDonald&apos;s to remove more than 30 ‘Golden Arches’ as it sought to give the city a visual ‘makeover’ in the run-up to hosting the 2008 Olympic Games.

 Top Home &gt; Library &gt; History, Politics&amp;Society &gt; US History Encyclopedia 
 Mcdonald&apos;S, the world&apos;s leading fast food restaurant chain. In 1948, the brothers Maurice and Richard McDonald converted their San Bernardino, California, drive-in to a take-out restaurant serving mainly inexpensive hamburgers and French fries prepared assembly-line style. Ray A. Kroc (1902–1984) became the brothers&apos; franchising agent in 1954, and expanded the company nationwide, opening his first McDonald&apos;s in Des Plaines, Illinois, the next year. Using business-format franchising, Kroc maintained strict corporate-level control of the McDonald&apos;s concept, service, and products. Kroc&apos;s chief financial officer, Harry Sonneborn, created a system of carefully choosing sites for new stores, then leasing them to franchisees, making rents an important source of corporate revenue and the company the world&apos;s largest owner of commercial real estate.

McDonald&apos;s mass-marketing strategy emphasized family-oriented and &quot;all-American&quot; themes, &quot;quality, service, cleanliness, and value,&quot; and continual innovations, such as the Big Mac in 1968, a line of breakfast foods in the mid-1970s, child-oriented Happy Meals in 1979, and Chicken McNuggets in 1982. In 2001, McDonald&apos;s, with 30,000 stores and 395,000 employees serving 46 million people each day in 121 countries, achieved sales of $14.9 billion—over 60 percent of that outside the United States—earning $1.6 billion in net income. The international expansion of McDonald&apos;s has made its logo, the golden arches, a leading symbol of globalization and American culture.

 McDonald&apos;s Corporation ( NYSE :  MCD ) is the world&apos;s largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurants , serving around 68 million customers daily in 119 countries. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Headquartered in the United States, the company began in 1940 as a barbecue restaurant operated by the eponymous Richard and Maurice McDonald ; in 1948 they reorganized their business as a hamburger stand using production line principles. Businessman Ray Kroc joined the company as a franchise agent in 1955. He subsequently purchased the chain from the McDonald brothers and oversaw its worldwide growth. [ 5 ] 

A McDonald&apos;s restaurant is operated by either a franchisee , an affiliate , or the corporation itself. The corporation&apos;s revenues come from the rent, royalties and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. McDonald&apos;s revenues grew 27 percent over the three years ending in 2007 to $22.8 billion, and 9 percent growth in operating income to $3.9 billion. [ 6 ] 

McDonald&apos;s primarily sells hamburgers , cheeseburgers , chicken , french fries , breakfast items, soft drinks , shakes and desserts . In response to changing consumer tastes, the company has expanded its menu to include salads , wraps , smoothies and fruit. [ 7 ]

 History 
 McDonald&apos;s corporate logo used from 1968 to 2006. It still exists at some restaurants. The oldest operating McDonald&apos;s restaurant was the third one built, opening in 1953. It is located at 10207 Lakewood Blvd. at Florence Ave. in Downey, California (at 33°56′50″N 118°07′06″W ﻿ / ﻿ 33.9471°N 118.1182°W ﻿ / 33.9471; -118.1182 ). Main article: History of McDonald&apos;s 
The business began in 1940, with a restaurant opened by brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald at 1398 North E Street at West 14th Street in San Bernardino, California (at 34°07′32″N 117°17′41″W ﻿ / ﻿ 34.1255°N 117.2946°W ﻿ / 34.1255; -117.2946 ). Their introduction of the &quot;Speedee Service System&quot; in 1948 furthered the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant that the White Castle hamburger chain had already put into practice more than two decades earlier. The original mascot of McDonald&apos;s was a man with a chef&apos;s hat on top of a hamburger shaped head whose name was &quot;Speedee&quot;. Speedee was eventually replaced with Ronald McDonald by 1967 when the company first filed a U.S. trademark on a clown shaped man having puffed out costume legs.

McDonald&apos;s first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; on May 4, 1961, with the description &quot;Drive-In Restaurant Services&quot;, which continues to be renewed through the end of December 2009. In the same year, on September 13, 1961, the company filed a logo trademark on an overlapping, double arched &quot;M&quot; symbol. The overlapping double arched &quot;M&quot; symbol logo was temporarily disfavored by September 6, 1962, when a trademark was filed for a single arch, shaped over many of the early McDonald&apos;s restaurants in the early years. Although the &quot; Golden Arches &quot; appeared in various forms, the present form as a letter &quot;M&quot; did not appear until November 18, 1968, when the company applied for a U.S. trademark. The present corporation dates its founding to the opening of a franchised restaurant by Ray Kroc , in Des Plaines, Illinois , on April 15, 1955, the ninth McDonald&apos;s restaurant overall. Kroc later purchased the McDonald brothers&apos; equity in the company and led its worldwide expansion, and the company became listed on the public stock markets in 1965. Kroc was also noted for aggressive business practices , compelling the McDonald brothers to leave the fast food industry. The McDonald brothers and Kroc feuded over control of the business, as documented in both Kroc&apos;s autobiography and in the McDonald brothers&apos; autobiography. The San Bernardino store was demolished in 1976 (or 1971, according to Juan Pollo) and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo restaurant chain. It now serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, as well as a McDonald&apos;s and Route 66 museum. [ 8 ] With the expansion of McDonald&apos;s into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life . Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity , corporate ethics and consumer responsibility .

 Corporate overview 

 Facts and figures 
 By 1993, McDonald&apos;s had sold more than 100 billion hamburgers. The once-ubiquitous restaurant signs that boasted the number of sales, such as this one in Harlem , were left at &quot;99 billion&quot; as there was only space for two digits. 
McDonald&apos;s restaurants are found in 119 countries [ 9 ] and territories around the world and serve 58 million customers each day. [ 3 ] McDonald&apos;s operates over 31,000 restaurants worldwide, employing more than 1.5 million people. [ 9 ] The company also operates other restaurant brands , such as Piles Café.

Focusing on its core brand, McDonald&apos;s began divesting itself of other chains it had acquired during the 1990s. The company owned a majority stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill until October 2006, when McDonald&apos;s fully divested from Chipotle through a stock exchange. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Until December 2003, it also owned Donatos Pizza . On August 27, 2007, McDonald&apos;s sold Boston Market to Sun Capital Partners . [ 12 ] 

In March 2012, McDonald&apos;s quietly resigned its membership in the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) saying only it was a &quot;business decision&quot;. [ 13 ] 

 Types of restaurants 

Most standalone McDonald&apos;s restaurants offer both counter service and drive-through service, with indoor and sometimes outdoor seating. Drive-Thru, Auto-Mac, Pay and Drive, or &quot;McDrive&quot; as it is known in many countries, often has separate stations for placing, paying for, and picking up orders, though the latter two steps are frequently combined; it was first introduced in Arizona in 1975, following the lead of other fast-food chains. The first such restaurant in Britain opened at Fallowfield , Manchester in 1986. [ 14 ] 

In some countries, &quot;McDrive&quot; locations near highways offer no counter service or seating. In contrast, locations in high-density city neighborhoods often omit drive-through service. There are also a few locations, located mostly in downtown districts, that offer Walk-Thru service in place of Drive-Thru.

To accommodate the current trend for high quality coffee and the popularity of coffee shops in general, McDonald&apos;s introduced McCafé , a café -style accompaniment to McDonald&apos;s restaurants in the style of Starbucks . McCafé is a concept created by McDonald&apos;s Australia, starting with Melbourne in 1993. Today, most McDonald&apos;s in Australia have McCafés located within the existing McDonald&apos;s restaurant. In Tasmania , there are McCafés in every store, with the rest of the states quickly following suit. After upgrading to the new McCafé look and feel, some Australian stores have noticed up to a 60% increase in sales. As of the end of 2003 there were over 600 McCafés worldwide.

Some locations are connected to gas stations / convenience stores , [ 15 ] while others called McExpress have limited seating and/or menu or may be located in a shopping mall . Other McDonald&apos;s are located in Wal-Mart stores. McStop is a location targeted at truckers and travelers which may have services found at truck stops . [ 16 ] 

Since 1997, the only Kosher McDonald&apos;s in the world that is not in Israel , is located in the &quot; Abasto de Buenos Aires &quot;, Argentina . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] 

 Playgrounds 
 McDonald&apos;s in Panorama City , Los Angeles, California designed for family-friendly image 
Some McDonald&apos;s in suburban areas and certain cities feature large indoor or outdoor playgrounds . The first PlayPlace with the familiar crawl-tube design with ball pits and slides was introduced in 1987 in the USA, with many more being constructed soon after. Some PlayPlace playgrounds have been renovated into &quot;R Gym&quot; areas.

 Redesign 
 McDonald&apos;s in Mount Pleasant, Iowa . This is an example of the new look of McDonald&apos;s in the United States 
In 2006, McDonald&apos;s introduced its &quot;Forever Young&quot; brand by redesigning all of its restaurants, the first major redesign since the 1970s. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] McDonald&apos;s has invested $1 billion to redesign nearly all of the 14,000 restaurants by 2015.

The goal of the redesign is to be more like a coffee shop, similar to Starbucks . The design includes wooden tables, faux-leather chairs, and muted colors; the red is muted to terra cotta, the yellow was turned golden for a more &quot;sunny&quot; look, and olive and sage green were also added. To warm up its look, the restaurants have less plastic and more brick and wood, with modern hanging lights to produce a softer glow. Many restaurants now feature free Wi-Fi and flat screen TVs. Other upgrades include double drive-thrus, flat roofs instead of the angled red roofs, and replacing fiber glass with wood. Also, instead of the familiar golden arches, the restaurants now feature &quot;semi-swooshes&quot; (half of a golden arch), similar to the Nike swoosh . [ 21 ] 

 Business model 

McDonald&apos;s Corporation earns revenue as an investor in properties, a franchiser of restaurants, and an operator of restaurants. Approximately 15% of McDonald&apos;s restaurants are owned and operated by McDonald&apos;s Corporation directly. The remainder are operated by others through a variety of franchise agreements and joint ventures. The McDonald&apos;s Corporation&apos;s business model is slightly different from that of most other fast-food chains. In addition to ordinary franchise fees and marketing fees, which are calculated as a percentage of sales, McDonald&apos;s may also collect rent , which may also be calculated on the basis of sales. As a condition of many franchise agreements, which vary by contract, age, country, and location, the Corporation may own or lease the properties on which McDonald&apos;s franchises are located. In most, if not all cases, the franchisee does not own the location of its restaurants.

The United Kingdom and Ireland business model is different than the U.S, in that fewer than 30% of restaurants are franchised, with the majority under the ownership of the company. McDonald&apos;s trains its franchisees and others at Hamburger University in Oak Brook , Illinois .

In other countries, McDonald&apos;s restaurants are operated by joint ventures of McDonald&apos;s Corporation and other, local entities or governments.

As a matter of policy, McDonald&apos;s does not make direct sales of food or materials to franchisees, instead organizing the supply of food and materials to restaurants through approved third party logistics operators.

According to Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser (2001), nearly one in eight workers in the U.S. have at some time been employed by McDonald&apos;s. (According to a news piece on Fox News this figure is one in ten. [ citation needed ] ) The book also states that McDonald&apos;s is the largest private operator of playgrounds in the U.S., as well as the single largest purchaser of beef , pork , potatoes , and apples . The selection of meats McDonald&apos;s uses varies with the culture of the host country. [ citation needed ] 

 Shareholder dividends 

McDonald&apos;s has increased shareholder dividends for 25 consecutive years, [ 22 ] making it one of the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] 

 Controversies 

As a prominent example of the rapid globalization of the American fast food industry, McDonald&apos;s is often the target of criticism for its menu, its expansion, and its business practices. The McLibel Trial, also known as McDonald&apos;s Restaurants v Morris&amp;Steel , is an example of this criticism. In 1990, activists from a small group known as London Greenpeace (no connection to the international group Greenpeace ) distributed leaflets entitled What&apos;s wrong with McDonald&apos;s? , criticizing its environmental, health, and labor record. The corporation wrote to the group demanding they desist and apologize, and, when two of the activists refused to back down, sued them for libel in one of the longest cases in British civil law. A documentary film of the McLibel Trial has been shown in several countries.

Despite the objections of McDonald&apos;s, the term &quot;McJob&quot; was added to Merriam-Webster&apos;s Collegiate Dictionary in 2003. [ 25 ] The term was defined as &quot;a low-paying job that requires little skill and provides little opportunity for advancement&quot;. [ 26 ] In an open letter to Merriam-Webster, Jim Cantalupo , former CEO of McDonald&apos;s, denounced the definition as a &quot;slap in the face&quot; to all restaurant employees, and stated that &quot;a more appropriate definition of a &apos;McJob&apos; might be &apos;teaches responsibility.&apos;&quot; Merriam-Webster responded that &quot;we stand by the accuracy and appropriateness of our definition.&quot; [ 27 ] 

In 1999, French anti-globalisation activist José Bové vandalized a half-built McDonald&apos;s to protest against the introduction of fast food in the region. [ 28 ] 

In 2001, Eric Schlosser &apos;s book Fast Food Nation included criticism of the business practices of McDonald&apos;s. Among the critiques were allegations that McDonald&apos;s (along with other companies within the fast food industry) uses its political influence to increase its profits at the expense of people&apos;s health and the social conditions of its workers. The book also brought into question McDonald&apos;s advertisement techniques in which it targets children. While the book did mention other fast-food chains, it focused primarily on McDonald&apos;s.

McDonald&apos;s is the world&apos;s largest distributor of toys, which it includes with kids meals. [ 29 ] It has been alleged that the use of popular toys encourages children to eat more McDonald&apos;s food, thereby contributing to many children&apos;s health problems, including a rise in obesity. [ 30 ] 

In 2002, vegetarian groups, largely Hindu and Buddhist , successfully sued McDonald&apos;s for misrepresenting its French fries as vegetarian, when they contained beef broth . [ 31 ] 
 A PETA activist dressed as a chicken confronts the manager of the Times Square McDonald&apos;s over the company&apos;s animal welfare standards. 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), continues to pressure McDonald&apos;s to change its animal welfare standards, in particular the method its suppliers use for slaughtering chickens. [ 32 ] Most processors in the United States shackle the birds upside down, then run them through an electrically charged water tub to render them unconscious before slitting their throats. [ 33 ] PETA argues that using gas to kill the birds (a method known as &quot; controlled atmosphere killing &quot; or CAK) is less cruel. [ 34 ] Both CAK and &quot;controlled atmosphere stunning&quot; (CAS) are commonly used in Europe. [ 33 ] 

 Morgan Spurlock &apos;s 2004 documentary film Super Size Me said that McDonald&apos;s food was contributing to the epidemic of obesity in society, and that the company was failing to provide nutritional information about its food for its customers. Six weeks after the film premiered, McDonald&apos;s announced that it was eliminating the super size option, and was creating the adult happy meal .

The soya that is fed to McDonald’s chickens is supplied by agricultural giant Cargill and comes directly from Brazil. Greenpeace alleges that not only is soya destroying the Amazon rain forest in Brazil , but soya farmers are guilty of further crimes including slavery and the invasion of indigenous peoples’ lands. The allegation is that McDonald&apos;s, as a client of Cargill&apos;s, is complicit in these activities. [ 35 ] 

 Arguments in defense 

In response to public pressure, McDonald&apos;s has sought to include more healthy choices in its menu and has introduced a new slogan to its recruitment posters: &quot;Not bad for a McJob &quot;. [ 36 ] (The word McJob, first attested in the mid-1980s [ 37 ] and later popularized by Canadian novelist Douglas Coupland in his book Generation X , has become a buzz word for low-paid, unskilled work with few prospects or benefits and little security.) McDonald&apos;s disputes this definition of McJob. In 2007, the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan &quot;Would you like a career with that?&quot; on Irish television, outlining that its jobs have many prospects.

In an effort to respond to growing consumer awareness of food provenance , the fast-food chain changed its supplier of both coffee beans and milk . UK chief executive Steve Easterbrook said: &quot;British consumers are increasingly interested in the quality, sourcing and ethics of the food and drink they buy&quot;. [ 38 ] In a bid to tap into the ethical consumer market , [ 39 ] McDonald&apos;s switched to using coffee beans taken from stocks that are certified by the Rainforest Alliance , a conservation group . Additionally, the company started using organic milk supplies for its hot drinks and milkshakes. According to a report published by Farmers Weekly in 2007, the quantity of milk used by McDonald&apos;s could have accounted for as much as 5% of the UK&apos;s organic milk output. [ 40 ] 

McDonald&apos;s announced on May 22, 2008 that, in the U.S. and Canada, it would switch to using cooking oil that contains no trans fats for its french fries , and canola-based oil with corn and soy oils, for its baked items, pies and cookies, by year&apos;s end. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] 

With regard to acquiring chickens from suppliers who use CAK or CAS methods of slaughter, McDonald&apos;s says that it needs to see more research &quot;to help determine whether any CAS system in current use is optimal from an animal welfare perspective.&quot; [ 43 ] 

 Environmental record 
 Kosher McDonald&apos;s at Ben Gurion International Airport , Israel 
In April 2008, McDonald&apos;s announced that 11 of its Sheffield , England restaurants have been using a biomass trial that had cut its waste and carbon footprint by half in the area. In this trial, waste from the restaurants were collected by Veolia Environmental Services and used to produce energy at a power plant. McDonald&apos;s plans to expand this project, although the lack of biomass power plants in the U.S. will prevent this plan from becoming a national standard anytime soon. [ 44 ] In addition, in Europe, McDonald&apos;s has been recycling vegetable grease by converting it to fuel for its diesel trucks. [ 45 ] 

Furthermore, McDonald&apos;s has been using a corn-based bioplastic to produce containers for some of its products. Although industries who use this product claim a carbon savings of 30% to 80%, a Guardian study shows otherwise. The results show that this type of plastic does not break down in landfills as efficiently as other conventional plastics. The extra energy it takes to recycle this plastic results in a higher output of greenhouse gases. Also, the plastics can contaminate waste streams, causing other recycled plastics to become unsaleable. [ 46 ] 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized McDonald&apos;s continuous effort to reduce solid waste by designing more efficient packaging and by promoting the use of recycled-content materials. [ 47 ] McDonald&apos;s reports that it is committed towards environmental leadership by effectively managing electric energy, by conserving natural resources through recycling and reusing materials, and by addressing water management issues within the restaurant. [ 48 ] 

In an effort to reduce energy usage by 25% in its restaurants, McDonald&apos;s opened a prototype restaurant in Chicago in 2009 with the intention of using the model in its other restaurants throughout the world. Building on past efforts, specifically a restaurant it opened in Sweden in 2000 that was the first to intentionally incorporate green ideas, McDonald&apos;s designed the Chicago site to save energy by incorporating old and new ideas such as managing storm water, using skylights for more natural lighting and installing some partitions and tabletops made from recycled goods. [ 49 ] 

When McDonald’s received criticism for its environmental policies in the 1970s, it began to make substantial progress towards source reductions efforts. [ 50 ] For instance, an “average meal” in the 1970s—a Big Mac, fries, and a drink—required 46 grams of packaging; today, it requires only 25 grams, allowing a 46% reduction. [ 51 ] In addition, McDonald’s eliminated the need for intermediate containers for cola by having a delivery system that pumps syrup directly from the delivery truck into storage containers, saving two million pounds of packaging annually. [ 52 ] Overall, weight reductions in packaging and products, as well as the increased usage of bulk packaging ultimately decreased packaging by 24 million pounds annually. [ 53 ] 

 Legal cases 
 Main article: McDonald&apos;s legal cases 
McDonald&apos;s has been involved in a number of lawsuits and other legal cases, most of which involved trademark disputes. The company has threatened many food businesses with legal action unless it drops the Mc or Mac from trading names. In one noteworthy case, McDonald&apos;s sued a Scottish café owner called McDonald, even though the business in question dated back over a century (Sheriff Court Glasgow and Strathkelvin, November 21, 1952). On September 8, 2009, McDonald&apos;s Malaysian operations lost a lawsuit to prevent another restaurant calling itself McCurry . McDonald&apos;s lost in an appeal to Malaysia&apos;s highest court, the Federal Court. [ 54 ] 

It has also filed numerous defamation suits. For example, in the McLibel case , McDonald&apos;s sued two activists for distributing pamphlets attacking its environmental, labor and health records. After the longest trial in UK legal history, the judge found that some claims in the pamphlet were untrue and therefore libellous. The company, however, had asserted that all claims in the pamphlet were untrue, essentially obliging the judge to publicly rule on each one. Embarrassingly for the company, several of the specific allegations were upheld. [ 55 ] 

McDonald&apos;s has defended itself in several cases involving workers&apos; rights . In 2001 the company was fined £12,400 by British magistrates for illegally employing and over-working child labor in one of its London restaurants. This is thought to be one of the largest fines imposed on a company for breaking laws relating to child working conditions (R v 2002 EWCA Crim 1094). In April 2007 in Perth , Western Australia, McDonald&apos;s pleaded guilty to five charges relating to the employment of children under 15 in one of its outlets and was fined AU$8,000. [ 56 ] 

Possibly the most infamous legal case involving McDonald&apos;s was the 1994 decision in The McDonald&apos;s Coffee Case where Stella Liebeck was awarded several million dollars after she suffered third-degree burns after spilling a scalding cup of McDonald&apos;s coffee on herself.

In a McDonald&apos;s American Idol figurine promotion, the figurine that represents &quot;New Wave Nigel&quot; wears something that closely resembles Devo ’s Energy Dome , which was featured on the band&apos;s album cover, Freedom of Choice . In addition to the figurine&apos;s image, it also plays a tune that appears to be an altered version of Devo&apos;s song &quot; Doctor Detroit &quot;. Devo copyrighted and trademarked the Energy Dome and is taking legal action against McDonald&apos;s. [ 57 ] 

 Products 
 A McDonald&apos;s McArabia meal, served with French fries. The McArabia is a popular pita bread sandwich sold in the Middle East and central Asia. Main article: McDonald&apos;s products See also: McDonald&apos;s products (international) 
McDonald&apos;s predominantly sells hamburgers , various types of chicken sandwiches and products, French fries , soft drinks , breakfast items, and desserts . In most markets, McDonald&apos;s offers salads and vegetarian items, wraps and other localized fare. On a seasonal basis, McDonald&apos;s offers the McRib sandwich. Some speculate the seasonality of the McRib adds to its appeal. [ 58 ] Various countries, especially in Asia, are currently serving soup. This local deviation from the standard menu is a characteristic for which the chain is particularly known, and one which is employed either to abide by regional food taboos (such as the religious prohibition of beef consumption in India ) or to make available foods with which the regional market is more familiar (such as the sale of McRice in Indonesia ).


 Headquarters 
 McDonald&apos;s Plaza, located in Oak Brook, Illinois is the headquarters of McDonald&apos;s 
The McDonald&apos;s headquarters complex, McDonald&apos;s Plaza, is located in Oak Brook, Illinois . It sits on the site of the former headquarters and stabling area of Paul Butler, the founder of Oak Brook. [ 59 ] McDonald&apos;s moved into the Oak Brook facility from an office within the Chicago Loop in 1971. [ 60 ] 

 Advertising 
 Main article: McDonald&apos;s advertising 
McDonald&apos;s has for decades maintained an extensive advertising campaign. In addition to the usual media (television, radio, and newspaper), the company makes significant use of billboards and signage, sponsors sporting events ranging from Little League to the Olympic Games , and makes coolers of orange drink with its logo available for local events of all kinds. Nonetheless, television has always played a central role in the company&apos;s advertising strategy.

To date, McDonald&apos;s has used 23 different slogans in United States advertising [ citation needed ] , as well as a few other slogans for select countries and regions. At times, it has run into trouble with its campaigns.

McDonald&apos;s has become emblematic of globalization , sometimes referred to as the &quot; McDonaldization &quot; of society. The Economist newspaper uses the &quot; Big Mac Index &quot;: the comparison of a Big Mac &apos;s cost in various world currencies can be used to informally judge these currencies&apos; purchasing power parity . Norway has the most expensive Big Mac in the world as of July 2011, while the country with the least expensive Big Mac is India [ 61 ] (albeit for a Maharaja Mac —the next cheapest Big Mac is Hong Kong ). [ 62 ] 

 Thomas Friedman once said that no country with a McDonald&apos;s had gone to war with another. [ 63 ] [ full citation needed ] However, the &quot; Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention &quot; is not strictly true. Exceptions are the 1989 United States invasion of Panama , NATO&apos;s bombing of Serbia in 1999 , the 2006 Lebanon War , and the 2008 South Ossetia war .

Some observers have suggested that the company should be given credit for increasing the standard of service in markets that it enters. A group of anthropologists in a study entitled Golden Arches East [ 64 ] looked at the impact McDonald&apos;s had on East Asia , and Hong Kong in particular. When it opened in Hong Kong in 1975, McDonald&apos;s was the first restaurant to consistently offer clean restrooms, driving customers to demand the same of other restaurants and institutions. McDonald&apos;s has taken to partnering up with Sinopec , the second largest oil company in the People&apos;s Republic of China, as it takes advantage of the country&apos;s growing use of personal vehicles by opening numerous drive-thru restaurants. [ 65 ] McDonald&apos;s has opened a McDonald&apos;s restaurant and McCafé on the underground premises of the French fine arts museum, the Louvre . [ 66 ]

 McHappy Day 

McHappy Day is an annual event at McDonald&apos;s, where a percentage of the day&apos;s sales go to charity . It is the signature fundraising event for Ronald McDonald House Charities . [ 67 ] 

In 2007, it was celebrated in 17 countries: Argentina , Australia , Austria , Brazil , Canada , the United States , Finland , France , Guatemala , Hungary , England , Ireland , New Zealand , Norway , Sweden , Switzerland and Uruguay .

According to the Australian McHappy Day web site, McHappy Day raised $20.4 million in 2009. The goal for 2010 is $20.8 million. [ 68 ] 

 McDonald&apos;s Monopoly donation to St. Jude 

In 1995, St. Jude Children&apos;s Research Hospital received an anonymous letter postmarked in Dallas, Texas, containing a $1 million winning McDonald&apos;s Monopoly game piece. McDonald&apos;s officials came to the hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, who examined the card under a jeweler&apos;s eyepiece, handled it with plastic gloves, and verified it as a winner. [ 69 ] Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, McDonald&apos;s waived the rule and has made the annual $50,000 annuity payments, even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald&apos;s (see McDonald&apos;s Monopoly ).

 Cultural references 

 Political cartoonist Michel Kichka satirized a McDonald&apos;s billboard in his 1982 poster &quot;And I Love New York&quot;. On the billboard, lettering above the chain&apos;s golden arches symbol read &quot;McDonald Duck&quot;. [ 70 ] Country singer John Conlee referenced McDonald&apos;s in his 1983 hit song &quot; Common Man &quot;. Feeling awkward as he is about to have a swanky dinner, Conlee says, &quot;Let me drive us to McDonald&apos;s and I&apos;ll talk to you concerning something you should really know.&quot; [ 71 ]
