 Really nice room with a good view of Tropican Ave and LV strip. Worth the extra money for view room. Bad experience with check in, no information about leaving your car to check in and they will not let that happen unless you self park in the back of the complex. Ended up doing about 15 laps aroud the valet/taxi area to get checked in. Bellman was really great, obtained a very rare mini fridge for the room for us. Maintenance picked a really bad time to servie the elevators for our tower however. First thing in the morning when all the guests are trying to get down to the main level. Some were waiting for over 45 min for a ride down. No comps or even an appology for that maneuver. Overall a realy nice stay, Nine Fine Irishmen is a neat pub with very friendly tenders in the upper bar. Pretty decient food too.

 I did not stay in the hotel, so I cannot rate the rooms. However, I did spend a very enjoyable evening in the casino and associated restaurants/shops.

I was there on a Monday night and started at ESPN Zone. I got the last seat in the place, I think, during Monday Night Football. I had a steak dinner and a Guiness, which was quite tasty. The service was good and the servers friendly. It was a good atmosphere to watch the game.

I visited Coyote Ugly, just to see it. It was very entertaining. Good people watching opportunities. Crowded, though.

I played craps in the casino and had a wonderful time. I found a nice $5 table and settled in. The dealers were friendly and the casino atmosphere was pleasant. The cocktail waitresses were friendly, efficient, and came around frequently. They earn their tips. I usually drink only coffee while at the table, but they were more than happy to provide it.

The parking garage was reasonably close to the casino. It is entered through the Arcade on the mezzanine level.

All-in-all I found the NYNY casino to be a very pleasant place to spend time. We plan to go there to stay in April 2004. I&apos;ve booked the Deluxe Broadway room after reading some of the other reviews here. We&apos;ll see.

 We didn&apos; actually stay here but spent some quuality time in the casino and loved it. This was one of the few casinos that had slots that didn&apos;t just eat our money. Overall the slots in Vegas seem to have been tightened up considerably.

Great bars and restaurants, I strongly recommend Nine Fine Irishmen or The Times Square Bar if you are in the mood to&quot;throw back a pint&quot;. This is one of the only casinos where you can sit at the bar without a video poker machine under your glass! Friendliest bartenders in town.

If you insist on bringing kids to Vegas (I&apos;ll never understand why) I guess this place would be OK. I wouldn&apos;t recommend going here around spring break (unless you are on spring break) as it is a favorite of the college crowd.
I can understand why! If I was 22 again this would be my favorite spot. In November it&apos;s even fun at 55.

 We like NY NY, I was really really touched by the new 9/11 display outside. The public bathrooms were really clean, which you might actually find surprising if you go in some other ones. My husband and his best man had a riot in the arcade, but they don&apos;t like if you win too much, they actually booted them off the race car game for being too competative. Hey buddy, we&apos;re paying guests!

 Did not stay here, but gambled here and won on penny slots. I won $300 on the Beverly Hillibillies slot.
To the prejudice butthole who made the comment about the&quot;HOMIES&quot;and&quot;COMPTON&quot;, you should keep your butt in your small lilly white community and you won&apos;t be bothered with the likes of&quot;HOMIES&quot;. I seen just as much trailer park trash there, but who cares, I know how to enjoy myself and not be so pre-occupied with color.

 My sisters and I did out annual Vegas jaunt and finally got around to visiting the NYNY. The first indicator that this hotel/casino REALLY was just like New York were the vast number of&quot;Homies&quot;in the casino. We thought we were in LV, not Compton! Anyway, it was late and we were hungry..went up to Nathan&apos;s. We ended up leaving our booth and food due to the pending knife/gang fight in the restaurant! Told security but they didn&apos;t seem concered! We couldn&apos;t get out of there fast enough...OH! I&apos;m sorry...we had to wait 40 minutes for the valet to bring our car around. Love Vegas but will NEVER go back to NYNY. Stay away!

 This was our first time in Las Vegas, while Vegas was fun, this hotel was okay. Overall the place looks great, but the casino was way too crowded on saturday night, impossible to get a table at any denomonation! The dealers weren&apos;t too friendly and the slots were very tight. I went across the street to MGM, not as crowded, dealers were friendly and helpful and I won a few dollars. Next trip back I will look for another place to stay.

 First things first, I booked this hotel through Vegas.com which is the first time I&apos;ve ever used any sort of Internet-based travel site for anything more than comparing. We got three nights (Tuesday-Thursday in August granted) for $230 total, including all taxes and fees. A pretty excellent deal. At check-in (15 minute wait at 2:00 pm on a Tuesday) we were unable to get the King-Size, non-smoking we had requested on Vegas.com. We went King/Smoking for night 1 and then NY NY was very good at switching us for nights 2 and 3 to King/non-smoking. Everyone at the hotel was wonderful, the rooms were nice - our first room was 151 steps (!!) from the elevator and that was a bit extreme - but otherwise everything was great. Both rooms had views of the strip and the coaster, but we never heard either at all. It was over 100 every day but the A/C kept up no problem. The casino area is exceptional and the food and entertainment choices are excellent. We especially enjoyed the Il Fornaio cafe in the morning for an easy way to have a $10 breakfast of muffins and coffee without dealing with room service. We never made it to the dueling pianos in the Times Square bar, but we looked in once and it looked like something we will definitely try and hit next time.

The only negative about our entire experience was the pool area. If you are at ALL interested in spending time at the pool, I would strongly recommend another hotel. The pool itself is decent size, but the surrounding area is small, lounge chairs are stacked right on top of each other and the pool is located directly below the noisiest part of the roller coaster. There is absolutely NO way to relax at the pool. Add to all this the fact that NY NY gets more wind than any other spot on the strip for some reason and it was a very unpleasant experience. We spent one hour in 3 days at the pool. We were also surprised than on a 106 degree day the pool was very cold - less than 75-80 degrees. We heard from friends that stayed at the Flamingo that their pool was the same way, so it must be a concerted effort to keep algae growth down but it definitely took the breath away. Anyway - Vegas.com - two thumbs up and everything about NY NY except the pool, two thumbs up.

 First of all, we did not stay at this hotel, so I can&apos;t really comment on the rooms or service in general, BUT the major turnoff was going inside through the casino to the shops and restaurants, my wife and I were ONSLAUGHTED by those annoying promotions people. I HATE THAT!!!&quot;Where are you staying, visit our hotel, we&apos;ll give you a free show, here&apos;s a pamphlet.&quot;They wouldn&apos;t shut up long enough for us to say,&quot;not interested.&quot;Reminded me of walking the streets of Cozumel or Cancun getting bothered by those time share people offering a free rental car or blanket.....New York-New York was not the only hotel that allowed this, BUT they were the most persistent and bothersome there that we had to get out of there. We were going to eat at the ESPN Zone, but the promotional KNATS drove us away and we ate elsewhere. NY-NY was a nice looking hotel with a good theme, but I will NEVER go back or stay there because of the experience we had walking through there last week. Notice to the hotels: DON&apos;T LET THESE PROMOTIONAL KNATS IN YOUR HOTELS TO BOTHER YOUR CLIENTS!!!!! IT IS A MAJOR TURN OFF!!!!!!

 The New York New York Hotel and Casino lacked the grandeur of hotels such as the Bellagio, the Venetian, even MGM Grand. The architecture inside was not very appealing. It was almost as if the casino area was put together. I think the only thing good about New York New York was the availability of alcohol (I only had to pay a waitress two dollars for a tip, and I got a twelve-ounce Budweiser), and Jackpot Party. If you&apos;re reading this, and planning on going to Las Vegas, definitely check out Jackpot Party at the New York New York. Jackpot Party is a slot machine that is a guaranteed winner, when you play your quarter or dollar smartly. I think it is one of those slot machines that are in casinos for the sole purpose of making people happy. I went to Vegas with about ten friends, and by the end of the five-day trip, half of us were playing Jackpot Party, and all of us made money off it at least once. That&apos;s all. But if you want my advice, out of all the hotels on the Strip, the New York New York Hotel and Casino rates at about a 3.

 After staying at Paris, I realized what a great hotel New York New York is! We had a great room -- it looked out over the parking lot, but it was an excellent deal on a nice room with a large tub and soft sheets. I love the atmosphere and the variety of restaurants. I will be back!

 We did not stay at NY NY, but spent alot of time at the property. We stayed at the Tropicana and spent most of our evenings at NY NY. We thought they kept the property clean and the service was friendly. The lay out made things easy to find. The location is hard to beat.

 I was actually quite happy with the room. My husband was&quot;comped&quot;3 nights there. It Had 2 queen sized beds and the view was great. Thr roller coaster was below us , so that was no problem as far as noise. I DID like the casino..It was small and&quot;profitable&quot;..(for me ). Not speaking for anyone else :. I liked it alot !

 We went to Vegas with friends for the Jewelry Convention. Got to the hotel early Friday around 9:00am. We confirmed our reservation. I did the $20 grease to see if there was a room ready, The girl said come back at 11:00am and don&apos;t stand in line. So we did. Got back and our room was ready. Normal check-in is 3:00pm. Asked for a non-smoking king away from the roller coaster. Get upstairs to our room 2160 Century Tower, It was so small you had to go outside to turn around. I opened the drapes and there is the coaster. We thought we would see how loud it would be. It was so loud we had to change rooms in the morning. They were accommodating. I stressed again&quot;away from the coaster&quot;I get to the room that is even farther away from the elevator 2576 Century Tower. Had to make 10 turns through the hallways to find it. Slightly bigger room but still insight and ear sound of the coaster.
The room services were good. The casino was small and not very well marked. The pool was HORRIBLE. It opens at 10:00am and you have to sit in the shade till about noon before you get any sun. By this time you are packed in like sardines. Don&apos;t try to move your chair or the&quot;chair police&quot;will give you grief. If you want a place to sit and relax you can rent a cabana for a small fee of $125 a day. The pool is the size of a regular home pool. Oh yes did I mention they only have one drink girl! After the line at 10:00am. Once you get in and scramble for a chair, you now have to go stand in line at the other end of the pool for towels. I ended up going next door to the Monte Carlo and paying $15 a person to use there pool. It was well worth the $30. Nice lazy river, wave pool,trees,snack bar,2 pools and great service. Lots of nice staff.
As far as places to eat. There are no good places at NYNY. The Big Apple bar was great. Good entertainment,Pedro the bartender was great. Not to many friendly people there overall.
Went to work out one day but they charge you $20 for a day pass. It should have been free. My wife got her nails done and the Spa lady told her you can use the pool at the MGM because they are affiliated. I wish the desk had told me that. So I decided to ask them and they denied it. I did not check at the MGM but I should have.
The slots are tight and the tables were OK. They are always working on things in the casino during peak times.Like taking apart the gaming tables and construction. Not very good planning.

I forgot to mention we got room service late one night. They told us 1/2 hour. Well 1 1/2 later the guy shows up after we had called twice and the lady told us he should be there an minute. He tells us the elevators were shut down. I signed for the food with no tip anyway. He also makes an excuse that the room service is separate from the hotel. Not sure what that means. I was starving. We told the desk what happened and they did not even comp us or say a simple I&apos;m sorry.

Nobhill at the MGM is a must do! Top notch 5 star. La Femme at the MGM was good but not great. The show is 1 hour 20 minutes. 1 hour would OK. Better show for men I think than women. My wife only liked a couple of skits.

Mandaly Bay nice but over priced restaurants.

Luxor had nothing to offer.

Excalibur was older but a fun place. Great for kids.

Bellagio is top notch. The fountain show was great. The buffet was incredible. Well worth the wait. Went at 8:00pm had to wait 1 1/2 hours but it was a dinning treat. Worth the $32 per person. Go early or after 9:30pm to avoid the lines.

Ceasars is always great. They are adding on again. Went to the Forum shops. Had lunch at Spago. Very nice place.

Venetian is very nice. Would not recommend the gondola ride for $12 a person. Very short ride inside. I would stay here. It is central to the strip.

Paris we spent a short time there but was not overly impressed. Very bad place to catch a cab ride.

Fremont Street was great. Nice to see they cleaned up the old Vegas. The gift shops are half the price and the craps tables were hopping. Still $5 tables at night. About a $20 cab ride from NYNY. Also not to crowded.

My conclusion, for all the places we went to for shopping,food and gaming. The MGM, Bellagio, Cesars and Venetian I would recommend staying. It depends on your budget and taste.

Thanks for listening and Good Luck :)

 First of all, I didn&apos;t get the room I had reserved months ahead of time. In fact I arrived at 1pm and was told to come back at 3pm. 3pm is checkin time I was told by Ms. Albert Einstien at the front desk. Then at 3pm, they still didn&apos;t have any rooms clean yet. At 5pm I was told they only had standard rooms left. I asked the front desk girl for a room high enough so that the roller coaster would not bother me. She still tried to give me a room on the tenth floor. I had to speak with a manager to finally get a room high up. So, in the beginning I was already on edge. I guess like everywhere, it is hard to find good help. Other than a bad front desk experience, it is an OK hotel. I liked the NY decor, the piano bar, and the Big Apple Bar. The bars had some excellent free entertainment. Not sure if I would stay again.

 Stayed here for a couple of days in March. Room did not have much of a view, but I couldn&apos;t really hear the coaster, which was good. Bed was comfortable and the room was clean and housekeeping was there early and the room was made up by 10 a.m. Hotel was clean and neat and staff was friendly in all areas.

I will stay again and enjoyed it very much. No complaints.

 What a disappointment. They had the most unconfortable beds ever we asked for a non smoking and got a smoking room and it stunk the rollercoaster noise is as bad as people are saying but fun to ride. They have a table and two unconfortable chairs and a dinky TV. We learned that the NYNY is a great place to visit but not to stay at.

 Just returned from a three night stay at NYNY (2-12 thru 2-15). Have been here many times but the first staying here. I think NYNY does a good job in keeping there theme constant throughout the property (down to the fake steam coming out of the manhole covers).

Check in was easy as we came in on a offer through the slot club ($49 a night, can&apos;t be beat). The room was small, faced the roller coaster but it really was fine for what we needed. I think the standard rooms I have had at Treasure Island, Mirage and even Monte Carlo were bigger but it was still ok for us. However, the room we were in was quite far from the elevator (190 steps!).

I don&apos;t believe they have a buffet so we ate at Ilfornaio for breakfast a couple of times at it was very good and actually reasonable. I never do too well there gambling but since it was actually raining a lot when we were there I did play there more than I wanted and lost some weight in my wallet....

The valet system is very good. To pick up your car just self-serve yourselve and scan your ticket and each time the car was delivered in less than five minutes - pretty good. The new sportsbook is way too small....they sort of stuck it in near ESPNZone. The tv&apos;s they do have are situated in front of only 2-3 rows of seats and you have to really look up to see them, sort of like sitting in the front row of a movie theater. I wouldn&apos;t sit here for my football weekends to Vegas (I like the Mirage for that).

Overall, a very good stay and I was actually impressed with the NYNY.

 First time at the NYNY and was overall very happy... check in line was long, but went fast... the Internet special promised a skyline room, and we got that on the 31st floor! Yes, the roller coaster is a little loud even when not that close to it, but not enough to affect my sleep. Miss having a buffet in the hotel I&apos;m staying at, and wasn&apos;t impressed with the breakfast at Il Fornagio (long wait but we had a 2 for 1 coupon). Got a french dip sandwich at the little stand, but was cold and took forever to get - didn&apos;t appear that the man working the area was thrilled to be there. Other than that, overall very happy, nice clean room, very clean casino, free drinks when playing slots. Only complaint is you can get a free drink playing a 2 cent slot, but placing $100 sports bets, you don&apos;t get a free drink unless you go up and ask for a free coupon - one coupon per bet! Valets were great, luggage kept very secure. Very nice atmosphere, but I seemed to always get lost in there!

 Just returned from a four day stay and would go back tomorrow if time and money were unlimited. While losing each day on both blackjack and slots, but staying within a reasnable limit, I found the dealers to be very friendly. Drinks were available while playing on a very regular bases and the service was excellent. The hotel was over booked when we checked in however my disappointment turned to satisfaction as the upgraded me on the spot to an available room. I would go back just to enjoy the piano bar and had a great time each evening listening to some great music and everyone having fun. While the All American resturant was average at best ESPN zone was enjoyable and the short walk to MGM afforded a very nice buffet. I am planning on going back in 2004 and hope to stay at NY/NY.

 Check in line long. Rooms were typical of standard Las Vegas Rooms. When we entered our room there was something&quot;crusty&quot;on our comforter. Called room service and someone came up to change the bed with a supervisor within five minutes. No problems with the rooms after that. Big Bathrooms

Food was good. The America restaurant was good and convienent.

The atmosphere of this entire building from the casino to the general areas is very different than any other in Las Vegas. A brook that runs through the casino and cobblestone streets in the food court. Very cool. The roller coaster here is great, if you love roller coasters.

Casino was very nice. Dealers were very friendly and helpful. This casino was good to me but bad to my husband. We both did very well at the Mandalay Bay though. Those slots were loose.

We received a great rate on this room. $59 per night and it was worth every penny.

The Bar at Times Square was AWESOME and if you are looking for some cheap entertainment on the strip this is the place to go. The Dueling Pianos show is unbeatable.

All in all this is a great hotel with a great casino and awesome entertainment. We would definately stay here again.

 i really enjoyed my stay at nyny. used vip check in and it was quick and easy. room was sufficient for my needs although it seemed a little dark. the casino is fantastic as it is very lively with entertainment and has a large variety of games and slots to choose from. staff was very friendly in casino. hit a couple of hand pay jackpots on slots and attendant was by my side in less than a minute both times. drink service at table games was outstanding.

 First stay at the NY/NY and had an overall good experiance. Like the way the rooms were decorated, somewhat small and dark but comfortable. We had heard not to get rooms facing the roller coaster (because of noise) but we decided to ignore that and were pleased we did. Ended up with a great view of the strip and the noise was there but it was muffled which did not bother us. We didnt eat much at the hotel because it didnt seem like they offered a whole lot, although remarks from other guests indicated that the restaurants were pretty good. Casino was somewhat crowded but i like the way it was set up. We got a nice souvenir with a drink! Pick up any drink you want in a porcelin apple. Its a large inexpensive drink and you get to keep the apple. The staff was very friendly and helpful any time we needed anything. The pool was unimpressive, not much too it, but we werent there to see the pool anyway. Overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone.

 My third trip to Vegas, and first stay at NY, NY. The exterior design and casino/restaurant/entertainment area inside are the best on the strip in my opinion. The NY theme is carried on throughout. Food was great, lots of good, quick, cheap options (I agree with earlier comment that the breadbowl of clam chowder is a great deal), but you can go more expensive with great variety too. Sports book area is small, but right next to ESPN SportsZone, which shows all the games. Casino seems small compared to the monsters (MGM, Ceasars, Bellagio, etc.) but has everything. Location is great, easy access to all of the best strip properties. Will go again soon, and see Rita Rudner this time.

 Beware of that Rollercoaster by your hotel room window, it is incredibly noisy and distracting! If you happen to stay at this hotel, ask the desk to put you in a room where you will see less of the tracks. I thought the room was small, and there was no iron in the room, a definite minus.

If you&apos;re looking for somewhere romantic to go, don&apos;t go here.

 My wife and I decided to come into LV a day early before a business conference at the Bellagio. This was not our first trip to LV and we wanted to stay somewhere different than we had before (previously have stayed at Luxor, Alladin, Treasure Island, and Golden Nugget) NYNY was always on our list and we decided to try it out for a night. Overall, the experience was neither good nor bad but rather vanilla. The rooms were clean and spacious, but overpriced. We asked for a room away from the coaster and were placed in a room with the coaster right in front of us. However, we never heard any noise from it so it wasn&apos;t an issue. The only problem that we had was that the casino was extremely crowded with touristy types. (isn&apos;t it funny that even though we are on vacation in LV that we never consider ourselves tourists? Am I the only one who thinks like this?) The check in was a pain because you were constantly having to dodge all the casino traffic. I don&apos;t think we ever even played in the casino, instead we opted to go a few blocks down to the Luxor and some other places. Overall I felt like I was in a busy themepark and not at a Las Vegas casino. (there were kids and teenagers everywhere) My suggestion to first time visitors is to take the walk or cab ride to check out NYNY, but stay at one of the other stip hotels that aren&apos;t as&quot;touristy&quot;.

 We paid $69 a night Sun-Wed and $99 on Thursday. We got a non-smoking room on floor 10 but it was all the way to the end of the floor. So we had to walk several hallways back to the elevator. It felt crowed on the main floor in the non-gaming areas such as restaurants and shops. The roller coaster was definitely noticeable for a light sleeper.

 I didnt stay at NY/NY but I went to both meet my friends there and gamble....I liked the room(they had a jacuzzi room,second honeymoon)and the gambling was alright. Do note: The NY/NY is tight on the slots and table games and you&apos;re going to have to play for awhile to get at least a dinner comp.

Went To ESPN Zone and had dinner and bet on some post season baseball.

I just may stay there next time when im in town

 I&apos;m totally half and half on NYNY! First of all, I&apos;ve stayed at
RIO,MANDALAY,MGM,T.I., LUXOR and NYNY had the smallest room out of
all of them. Really small...I love the decor though. My view was toward the
rollercoaster and it kinda woke me up around noon...well...here&apos;s some
review...

ROOMS-Like i said, small! i would upgrade to a suite if I do ever go back.
Which i probably won&apos;t. I like the decor like I said before and the view was
really nice. Bathroom&apos;s ur basic plain bathroom and nothing special. I
like the way the rooms are set up by the different buildings of NYC. I
stayed at the Empire I think. Rooms are not what&apos;s good about NYNY.

CASINO-This is where NYNY gets it&apos;s praises. The Casino floor and it&apos;s
amentities are fun, fun, fun! The Big Apple lounge is one of my fave place
to hang out. I saw some celebrities there too. Casino gaming
environment is top notch. I won alot in blackjack and you can look around
and not be bored. I didn&apos;t play too much slots. But one of my friend won
some $$$ playing slots. The restaurants are great there. Americana is a
great place to chow late night. The Food Court area has a great look to it
and the food is very NY! Even the sewage with steam is a nice touch.
Visiting the casino is a must!

SPA/Pool-yuck,yuck,yuck!!! the spa at NY is like going to my grandma&apos;s
bathroom...what the hell are they thinking. One tub with warm water and
that&apos;s the jacuzzi? How lame! The pool sucked really bad. It&apos;s one pool
and it reminded me of Red Roof Inn. NYNY is not a resort! It&apos;s just a
Casino with rooms. If u want a resort atmosphere then do not go to
NYNY! Go to Mandalay!

OVERALL-I hate the rooms and spa/pool...but the casino area and it&apos;s
theme gives NYNY a better score. Go hang out at NYNY for sure...just
don&apos;t waste any money by staying there. Go across the street to MGM and
walk across and party at NYNY!

 Marquee room was great. Oversized with a whirlpool tub for two. Room service was there in 10 minutes. Very clean room, air was cool and fresh with friendly service. Casino was very unique with very open floor and was kept pratically spotless. Friendly cocktail service from some of the prettiest ladies in town. Fast checkin/out and great security staff. This is the best place I have ever stayed and will do so again.

 The first time we stayed in Las Vegas was at this hotel. Our check in was around 11:00 pm and the line was very crowded. We had to wait a long time to get checked into our room, there were few selections left and it seemed like a trek to get there. When we finally got to the room it was much smaller than expected. The casino on the other hand was a site to behold. The America Restaurant has very slow service (somewhat typical of Vegas) as did Nathan&apos;s Hot Dog Stand on the second floor. We never did get a free drink. I would recommend staying somewhere else and visiting New York New York.

 I have now stayed at 3 of the Vegas hotels. Our first trip was at the Paris hotel. We liked it. The second trip was at the Venetien and we really liked it. This last trip was in a deluxe room at NYNY and we loved it. Even though the room was smaller than the Venetien it was still a big room and the Art Deco Decore was much more to our liking than the&quot;elegent&quot;Venitien. Our room was quite large and , being on the corner, had many windows on two of the walls. The bathroom was not pretensiously large and was&quot;rich&apos; feeling. There were no Floral paterns in the room thank goodness. Everything was comfortable including the chairs and beds. Even the piullows worked for me and I usually bring my own.Our view was out the back of the hotel and was colorful and fun. We could watch the roller coaster climb the lift hill and descend. The coaster did make noise though. It isn&apos;t a horrible noise. it was more like a wind storm or ocean waves. Still I can see how it would be annoying to some people. It stopped at 11:00 which was just about right.
Most employee was courteous and smiling and helpful from the first gentlmans, Marco who helped check us in to the sandwich makers in the Deli. The morning employes serving the&quot;buffet&quot;breakfast at Nathan&apos;s while not rude were not as fun or concerned as everyone else.
I was worried about staying here due to some reviews but it was great. The slots did seem a bit tight but they did in most of the casinos we were in. Bad luck this trip I guess!

 I had checked out of the Tropicana to come to the Ny Ny. I was hoping to find a hotel that was romantic and wild at the same time. Ny Ny is it! It is clean, great service, great food, good slots, and great location. It was my girlfriend&apos;s 21st birthday and it was perfect. Coyote Ugly is boring. All it is is just a bunch of people stand in place and watch some girls move and sway from side to side. I wasn&apos;t to pleased. Overall it is a great hotel. My only bad experience is that at 3am, the night before we left, there had to be about 5 guys in the next room that were as drunk as could be and yelling and laughing. I called security, 25 minutes went by, still, they never showed up. So I got out of bed, pounded on the wall and said&quot;PLEASE, THANK YOU!!!!!&quot;After that, not one peep from that room......until 8am, they were as loud as could be. This really wasn&apos;t the hotel&apos;s fault. I mean I wish security did come, then maybe they would of be less noisy. Hey that&apos;s Vegas. It was a fun as well as romantic hotel. I would stay here again, but next time I think I might try Aladdin, Mirage, Monte Carlo, or Bellagio.

 We visited for our 2nd wedding aniversary and had a wonderful time. The service was wondeful. We could hear the rollar coaster from our room at times, but we are in our mid 20&apos;s (were gone most of the time it was open) and had a great view of the strip so we were happy to overlook it. The only resturant we visited there was the Chin Chin Cafe and it was all right. We were pleasantly suprised by the Dueling Pianos act at&quot;The Bar at Times Square&quot;. We spent the end of one night there and it was a great way to end a night on the town. We went to Coyote Ugly one night (again, at the end of the night on the way to our room). We didn&apos;t get charged a cover and thought it was all right, but not great. The casino was a little tight and VERY crowded. Good atmosphere though, it&apos;s hard to beat the likliness to New York. For the price we paid (deal on the internet), we had a great time and would stay there again.

 The likes: (1) location is excellent and allows for easy travel to all casinos on the south strip. You have overpasses to the MGM Grand&amp;Excalibur. From Excalibur, you can take either a tram or moving sidewalks to Mandalay Bay&amp;Luxor. You are right beside the Monte Carlo, which has a 24 hour tram to Bellagio. Bellagio, in turn, has a overpass to Bally&apos;s, which is connected to the Paris, which is right beside the Aladdin. So from the New York - New York, you can go anywhere on the south strip without much effort for free. (2) Good inexpensive food all over the casino. Personally, I think the gaint $4.50 sourdough bread bowl of clam chowder is the best buy. If you want to pay $100 for a meal, they have plenty of restaurants for that too (can one person really eat a 16 ounce porterhouse steak?).
The Dislikes: (1) Room size can drastically change from one visit to the next. In May the room was so big they ran out of furniture. There was a big bare spot (say 10&apos;x20&apos;) in front of the window. In July, the room was so small the king size bed was all it could hold. Paid the same price on both visits, so I don&apos;t understand the problem. (2) When you check in, they give you a coupon book. Problem is some of the coupons are either expired (match play on table games) or simply cannot be redeemed because the service is no longer offered. In July, we were able to use 2 coupons and had to throw away 3. (3) Not really a problem if you like kids, but maybe the casino is too kid friendly. A lot of families come to the New York - New York and other than the arcade on the second level (which is NOT free), the only other entertainment for the kids is to run through the casino. No this is not allowed, but hard to enforce.

 Stayed at NYNY (end of July) because I had 2 free nights there...soooooo...in general, the room was pretty decent, bed comfy (king bed), bathroom kinda small-have seen worse. Super friendly hotel registration staff. Didn&apos;t gamble much there at all-whatever money I did gamble, stayed with the NYNY-LOL. Easy casino to use as a base to Luxor or M.Bay (easy walk), which is where I was when I wasn&apos;t at the Venetian (must drive). Would stay again with a free room. I HATED the fact that we always went through the video game room from the parking garage-if there is another way, obviously, I didn&apos;t know about it-do tell! Lots of kiddies at the NYNY and surrounding resorts (ie. excalibur luxor) so if you don&apos;t want to be around children, you may not want to stay here. Sum it up: Decent room, super comfy bed, great staff.

 We visited NYNY over the 4th Holiday, the place was very busy, we really liked the casino, we always do fairly well here, at least they let you play a while, the rooms are small but nice, room service was wonderful, valet parking superb, our only negative is the amount of kids in the casino, i mean a woman holding a baby at 3 a.m., come on people, Vegas is for adults, Disney is for kids.

 I like the hotel for what it is, however the slots are tighter than&amp;$*#! I&apos;ve stayed at the New York New York once but I would not stay again. I like that little pizza place by the piano bar. The roller coaster rocks! Sit in the front car on the right side. Oh, and keep your arms inside! I&apos;ve won money here, but not to the extent of Excalibur. I&apos;ve had better luck on the $5 slots than the quarters. It&apos;s a fun place to visit just as long as you don&apos;t plunk to much money down.

 Played at NYNY for one day in 2001 and started getting free room offers in the mail (not quite sure why because I&apos;m a mid-roller at best) so I decided to take them up on one. They didn&apos;t have a king bed room when I checked in, so I ended up in a room with two queen beds and no desk. (I was told I could switch the next day, but it wasn&apos;t a huge deal to me.) Check-in was reasonably courteous and efficient. I later found out that I could have used a line for&quot;Invited Guests&quot;(at the far left end of the desk when facing it) rather than the general line-up.

Stayed on the 19th floor of the Century tower, with a&quot;Strip&quot;view that faced straight out onto LV Blvd., so I could really only see the MGM. The strip itself was blocked from view by the north and south ends of NYNY. Even with the outdoor vents open, the noise from the rollercoaster was not bothersome to me, but I do shift-work so I&apos;ve been conditioned to sleep through noise. The room itself was pretty large, but could have used either more lamps or higher wattage bulbs. The armoire was nice AND functional, and the in-room iron and board proved useful. The bathroom was large and the water pressure and temperature were quite good. The bathtub was slightly larger than standard, but nothing like the tubs at Aladdin. The television was smaller than I expected, seeing as how I&apos;ve gotten a 27&quot;TV in my room in places that were downright shabby otherwise. The wall safe was of the electronic variety.

Had TONS of fun in the Big Apple Bar, where there is live music until 3 am. They&apos;ve got the video poker/blackjack machines at the bar, but when the band is playing, there are no free drinks available. Actually, that&apos;s not entirely true: the drink IS free, but there is an entertainment charge of $1.75 for getting your free drink while the band&apos;s playing, but that&apos;s better than the $4.50 that people not at the video machines pay. I sit at the bar and play $1 video blackjack SLOW, and save the real gambling for the tables on the days I&apos;m NOT partying -- I don&apos;t like to drink too much during serious gambling sessions. If you&apos;re a single man sitting at the bar, especially if you&apos;re dressed well, expect to be approached by young (and not-so-young)&quot;professional&quot;women doing business. If they keep bothering you after you politely decline, signal the bartender and it will be taken care of pretty much instantly.

There&apos;s an admission coupon for 2 to Coyote Ugly nightclub in the funbook you get when you check in, so I went there to see what it was all about. Yes, it&apos;s like the movie. It was loud and crowded, too loud to meet and talk to people, if that&apos;s why you go to a club. The staff were all pretty cool, except for one bouncer who had a really bad attitude. I didn&apos;t get his name, but he&apos;s a very wide and tall blond man with a mole on his left cheek. This guy was actually telling customers not to smoke cigarettes near him because he was getting over pneumonia! Hey guy! If your company doesn&apos;t give you enough sick days, how is that my problem? Maybe you should ask your boss if you could work the door, or in another part of the casino until you&apos;re feeling better! If smoke bothers you, don&apos;t work in a smoky club! The customers DO NOT want to hear about it! Otherwise, the dancing bartenders are quite attractive, and CAN dance. Drinks are sort of pricey, $6.50 for a Heineken, plus tip. They are pretty liberal with the free shots (something from the movie) and I got one practically right upon arrival right after they publicly shamed me for showing up in a shirt and tie. If you&apos;re the jealous type, you probably don&apos;t want to go there with your attractive wife or girlfriend. The more attractive women are asked if they want to dance on the bar, and sometimes things can get racy: think pitchers of water over white shirts. Anyone who goes up get a shot or two poured down their throat.

I didn&apos;t eat at any of the sit-down restaurants at NYNY. The fast-food places have standard mediocre food and mediocre service, the exact same as you&apos;ll get at pretty much any fast-food restaurant on the planet.

As for the gaming, it was pretty average. Since my room was comped, I couldn&apos;t get any other comps out of them to save my life (as I said, mid-roller at best.) The casino was not crowded, and all of the games were represented. Typical for summer midweek. The staff were all competent and courteous. Drink service is pretty constant, but it almost always is when you&apos;re tipping average or better.

All-in-all, it was a good time there, especially for no money. I will stay again, but will never play there exclusively. At my level of play, I can get much better comps elsewhere. However, it&apos;s so much easier to stumble to my room from the Big Apple Bar when I&apos;m staying at NYNY!

 Excellent customer service. One of the easier casinos to earn comps. We like the jacuzzi in the free rooms.

Everytime we stay at NYNY we have a blast. We get a kick out of their offer for a free limo from and to the airport.

Cann&apos;t go wrong with the NYNY. Good looking waitresses!

 Our visit was wonderful. We have a 4yr old daughter who enjoyed the stay as well. The room was not as large as say the one at Excalibur we had stayed in previously but when you have a clean, spotless room in an overall great hotel, size isnt all that important to us.

We were on a lower floor and the coaster didnt bother us at all. We were a bit far from the elevator, but after the first few trips back and forth to and from the room it became old habit and the walk felt shorter than what it was. No biggy.

Our daughter was quite entertained by what we could see of the coaster from the room. Casino and surrounding area got crowded during the day and evening with tourists (but arent we all tourists when we visit? haha) but thats to be expected. If you&apos;re not in a hurry this wont bother you much. Vegas and Crowds? Who knew..haha.

The arcade area was more than enough entertainment for our daughter and we had fun too. Excellent location to several hotels worth taking in. Walking distance to restaurants like Dennys and Carrows and fun places like the Coca Cola Store and M&amp;M Factory.

Never had any problems with noise from other guests or the coaster. The pool, although rather bland compared to the likes of Mandalay Bay, if your goal is just to cool off and wet, then it works out just fine. We went down about an hour before the pool closed and it was peaceful, about 8 people if that at the pool, only a few actually in the pool. Again, the roller coaster is ever present but we got a kick out of watching people on it.

Casino slots sure took our money but thats half the fun..playing.

As far as kids in Vegas..Ive seen some posts about that. I think you have good parents and bad parents. Responsible parents will see to it that the children have their fun too..and I dont mean running around unsupervised. There are plenty of places for the kids to spend time and enjoy themselves instead of being turned loose. Parents need to be responsible and stay with their children. My husband and I spent each day with our daughter doing family things (arcades, Hoover Dam, M&amp;M Factory, etc). In the evenings after dinner and she had a bath, she was put to bed. If I want to go gamble he stays with her in the room..and when I come back, he goes. But she is never left alone, never left to run around, and never left in the care of any Hotel-run Facility. 4 or 14, she will never be unsupervised. I just wish more parents would really understand how important it is to not allow their kids to run around. I get mad too when I see people with babies in strollers roaming casinos at 2am!

There is a place for children in Vegas...children live there on a daily basis BUT casino floors are not playgrounds and it should be no different than if you did take your children to Disneyland...stay with them, be responsible, keep them safe. And everyone can have a good time. And for those who dont like kids or dont think they have a place there..stay out of places like Excalibur, NYNY, Circus Circus. If my husband and I were to go alone we&apos;d definately stay somewhere more&quot;adult&quot;like the Venetian or Paris.

So overall..NYNY was a great stay for a family. It was clean, theme was great and people were friendly. As much as we were in and out of the hotel during peak hours, the crowds were no biggy overall. Late night the casino is pretty quiet and it was the best time in my opinion to enjoy playing in it! =)

 Don&apos;t believe anything they tell you on the reservations phone. Get written confirmation and don&apos;t think that the Player&apos;s Card will do any good for upgrade on the room. They told me to go to the VIP registration which I did and was made to feel like a fool since apparently it is for the whales only. I paid $118 a night for a room that at time I reserved in Feb. was $65 for two nights. Did&apos;t have time nor inclination to argue. I e-mailed customer service after I got home --that&apos;s been a week--haven&apos;t heard anything and probably will not.

 Although I enjoyed the view from our room (facing the MGM) the roller coaster was very noisy and you could hear the laughter in the halls at 3am. The rooms have hardly any furniture in them and the bathrooms could be better. I did not enjoy gambling here either. The casino is VERY crowded and it is hard to get any play in, with people banging into you. A nice place to look at, but not to stay at!!!

 We recently spent 3 nights at the NYNY. Overall, I enjoyed my visit.

The room we were in, 24th floor of the Century Tower, was quite lovely. Art
deco furniture including a beautiful armoire. We really like the decor. The
bathroom was new and nice as well, stocked with the standard
amenities. It was a bit of a hike to the elevator but that seems to be
standard for Vegas. I suppose we heard less noise because of it. The
roller coaster was below our room and it was audible. It wasn&apos;t usually an
issue except the day I was feeling ill and hung out in the room for the
morning. I could have done without the screamers then.

We ate in several of the quick food outlets and all were OK. The coffee
joint was under-staffed so it was a 10-minute wait for a machine-made
latte. The pretzel kiosk was yummy.

The casino was somewhat crowded but not uncomfortable. I only played
the slots, no tables, and lost money overall, but not in a bad way. My
boyfriend lost his clump of slot club cards here and unfortunately it didn&apos;t
make it back to lost&amp;found. We suspect they may have destroyed them
as there were cards for other casinos all over town. My boyfriend found a
lucky Price is Right slot machine, and played it consistently for the
duration of our trip. It really seemed to love him and he constantly hit on it.
Drink service was good, no complaints there.

Check-in was quick and efficient. We slipped the clerk $20 US and got a
lovely upgrade.

The only downer to our visit was that I left my laptop computer charger in
the room when we checked out. We were moving to a downtown hotel so
as soon as I unpacked, I called NYNY to check on the charger. No such
luck. I&apos;m still trying to deal with them about this and frankly, they&apos;re
annoying me by not taking it seriously and failing to return my calls. I had
to force the issue to even get housekeeping to put me on to security (and
file an official report). I&apos;m now totally angry at this runaround so am in the
process of writing a letter to the hotel manager, security head,
housekeeping, etc. This is a $140 CDN loss for me. Surely housekeeping
turns in weird items like this? It presumably had no value to them? Oh
well, maybe we&apos;ll get comp&apos;d a room next time.

 My wife and I visited vegas for spring break &apos;02. We booked a package deal through AMERICAWEST.com for the air fare and hotel from Chicago. We got round trip air and hotel stay for both, 5 nights 6 days for a total of $700.00!! This is no joke, the rate was great, that was part of the reason we decided to go. On to the vacation. We flew AMERICA WEST which was fine. The new york new york hotel also offers a hotel check in at the las vegas airport. I had called ahead to make sure we had a non-smoking room and made sure the hotel checkin at the airport would be open until 11pm (our arival time at the airport)and they indicated that would not be a problem. We arrived in vegas ahead of schedule, 10:30pm. We headed over to the hotel checkin instead of waiting for lugage, we thought this would be a great service. It was about 10:45pm as we are walking up to the checkin booth at the airport and I notice the gates going down to the booth, like they are closing. So I run about 30 feet to get under the gates before they close. I get inside and the manager informes me that they are closed and that he can not help me. I said excuse me, it is 10:45pm, you do not close until 11pm. He said they were closed and could not help me with my checkin. I then asked that he please ckeck me in, I will be the last customer of the day. He agreed. I then proceeded to checkin, and indicated that I had made a reservation for a non-smoking room. He told me right off the bat, before even checking that there were no non-smoking rooms available. He said I would have to be on a waiting list until the following day to see if one became available. I told him this was unacceptable. He indicated that a reservation is only a request, rooms are given out as you arive. Keep that in mind for your trip!! So we got a room on the 3rd floor, smoking, with a king bed. We got to the hotel and my wife noticed the line to the registration desk was very short, so we decided to try our luck there for a non-smoking room. Needless to say, after explaining our situation and our experience at the airport the person at the desk (Benjermin) got us a non-smoking room on the 20th floor of the hotel facing the strip. WOW, I guess it pays to ask at the hotel. In all I would say that our stay at the New York New York was very good. We did do our rounds to all the other hotels and ever prefered this hotel after seeing all the others. We felt the New York has a more layed back, blue collar type of atmosphere. The other hotels like Belogio, Mandilay Bay, Ceasars, and Mirage all were to upscale for us. We were very comfortable walking about the New York in shorts and a polo. At the other high class hotels we felt the dress code needed to be more strict than we wanted on a regular basis. We did get dressed up for the shows at night, which we did&quot;O&quot;and S&amp;R, but during the day, we did shorts and polo&apos;s. The new york new york was very comfortable. They also had a wide variety of food choices. They have pizas for the kids and fine dinning for the adults. We noticed that the other hotels did not offer to go or anything other than fine dinning at $20 to $25 dollars a dinner. The new york has some great quick lunch spots and quick dinner locations without being to overpriced or being stuck into sitting down and giving up a tip. Gambling here is not that great though. I am not a big gambler, but I like to play blackjack, craps, and roulette. The entire time I was there I could not find one $5 black jack table. I only found one $5 roulette table and craps was fine. I did find two good finds on the casino floor. On the casino floor near the exit to the strip down by ESPN Zone they have some Keno/Blackjack slot machines. These are machines that play multiple games: Keno, 5 card draw, and BLACKJACK. The best part is they are only 25 cent machines. My wife and I played 25 cent blackjack to our hearts content without any problem at all. We did not have to wait and it was great!!!! Also, check out the&quot;Chuck a Luck&quot;game near the escalator to go upstairs. It is a dice game that is a lot of fun with a $1 min bet. It is a lot of fun for a beginner gambler. I renamed it&quot;Chuck a Buck.&quot;All in all, it was a great stay and we will go back. If you have any questions about my stay, do not hesitate to ask me.

 If you stay here and have an early flight request a room away from the roller coaster on the east side of the property. It goes until about midnight during the week and you can hear the constant rumbling of the cars on the track and the intermittent screams of riders. The room I stayed in in the Century Tower was very nice, but it was a little unnerving to have the picture of the New York City skyline, complete with the WTC, staring back at me, from the wall near the television.

Room service is great. Once of the best meals I had in Las Vegas during a recent trip in late March.

The casino is really poor. I think theyve carried the New York theme too far. It was rare that someone wasnt bumping into me while I was playing at tables or machines. It is far too crowded for an enjoyable evening of gambling.

The restaurant situation is dismal. They are too crowded and people stood in line for long periods to buy fish and chips. Two small restaurants closed at 7:30 PM and the workers reported they had run out of food. and on a Wednesday night.

Based on too many people, too many children running around, noisy room, and crowded and expensive restaurants I would not stay there again.

 One of the best executed themes on strip. Casino layout somewhat confusing. Slot club stingy. Food court in neighborhood theme has decent variety of quickie snacks, didn&apos;t try the froufrou restaurant. Spa OK. Wicked spacious room, bathroom small. Took stroll down length of hall - because of unique bldg shape, rooms at ends of hall are a l--o--n--g way from elevators. Great location. Would stay there again.

 The atmosphere is wonderful, a lot cleaner than the city of NY but a lot more prostitutes :-) We had great fun and especially enjoyed the sidewalk cafes in the hotel. We did think for what we paid there should have been free coffee in the room however. Parking was easy; they have a very nice adjoining garage. Walking to other casinos was also easy. But.....TO MANY PEOPLE!!!

 I had a great time at NYNY. They let us block off many rooms for our
wedding party once we arrived. Also because of a miscommunication
between a reservation and Expedia.com, they bumped my parents to a
Jacuzzi Suite and gave them a $100 gift certificate to Il Fornia (sp?). The
casino was also nice $$ to us.

 A great place to go and see. Visually impressive inside and out. Excellent food and service at ESPN, Chin Chin, Gonzales y Gonzales. Good cocktail service at tables, and friendly dealers. Rita Rudner show excellent.

On the other hand; Tightest slots we ever saw. Very ordinary rooms, with very few amenities. Lousy slot club. Tough to get comps, etc. Unfriendly sports book personnel, who are not knowledgeable.

A great place for table games, and to dine, but wouldn&apos;t stay there again.

 This is a fun place to visit and walk thru, lots going on. But, very poor gaming action, one of the tightest casino&apos;s that we encountered, very hard to put anything together on the slots, definately tighter then other places. The rooms are not nearly as good as at other hotels, we had a jacuzzi room and it had hardly any furniture in it, wasen&apos;t very large, and lacked ammenities we find elsewhere. The noise from the roller coaster can get bothersome. Didn&apos;t like the music (if you call it that) coming from the main bar stage, the group wasen&apos;t very talented and souded terrible, we ended up leaving the casino to get away from ths noise they were putting out. This casino needs to loosen up the slots, and put some furniture in their rooms.

 While we enjoyed the casino and will visit it again, we would not recomend staying at the hotel. our &apos;deluxe suite&apos; was very unimpressive---i actually phoned the front desk thinking they had given us the wrong type of room! and while the roller coaster is fun to ride, having it pass your room continuously is very annoying...

 Loved the place. Celebrated my 50th B-Day there! Check-in was slow but the room was nice, not real large but nice&amp;clean with an art deco theme. We were on the 20th floor of the Centruy Tower and had no issue with the coaster. I did not see much of hosekeeping but everthing was tidy. The location is great and has easy access to several other casinos (MGM, Tropicana, Excalibur, etc.). We arrived in early October about a month after 9-11. There was a very moving display of messgaes and mementos outside of the hotel on the corner surroundong the &apos;harbor&apos; that choked me up. You could see that the items and their placement were spontaneous. When I visited again this month (Feb.) the display seemed more formal. The fence was covered with t-shirts from fire and rescue departmetns from across the country. Even if you don&apos;t stay here you should take a look at this memorial.

Now the first day I simply could not lose - from slots to tables! what a grand experience. Lost the next two days but won most back on the fourth. From my perspective, and I am not a particulalry high roller, the comps were great (we ate on the house every day after the first night) . One of the things I really like about this casino is that it is a navigable size. You won&apos;t get lost and all room elevators are an easy walk off the gaming floor. The rates tend to be a little higher here, but you pay for some of the atmosphere and the location. We ate at several restaurants and they were fine and a little above average. Never had a problem with the floor waitress. She always seemed to find us when we needed something to drink.

The hotel/casino has my vote of confidence and we would definitely stay here again.

 We had a great time here. Good variety of restaurants, loved the casino theme, and the rooms were fine. The one drawback if you&apos;re a light sleeper is that you may have to deal with roller coaster noise after 10 AM. There is a roller coaster that surrounds the building.

 We got stuck in Las Vegas last September 2001, as - two days before the end of our vacation - the attacks at the WTC and Pentagon happened and all the airports were closed. So we decided to move to another hotel. (We stayed at the small but nice La Quinta Inn). We went to NYNY-Hotel next door and got special rates and a great room. I enjoyed the stay at NYNY-Hotel a lot, I only once in a while lost my way in the big casino searching for the elevators, which would lead to our room. Beside that I can not complain about anything and would love to spend my vacation there again one day. Oh, only one thing: it is way too cold in the casino, but I realized this in all the other casinos as well!

 Stayed four nights in June. Great weather! The best part about NYNY is the casino. This casino is by far the best themed. Rooms were a little small and the design was not the best. Like the Luxor and Treasure Island for rooms. The check-in was quick and the service was great. Toilet didn&apos;t work when we got there, staffer was up in three minutes and no problems from there on out. Price could have been better, but if you want good cheap rooms stay at Stratosphere. Service and food at America way down from the last time I was there. Will not be eating there any time soon. Next trip in August 2002.

 The first time we stayed in Las Vegas was at this hotel. Our check in was around 11:00 pm and the line was very crowded. We had to wait a long time to get checked into our room, there were few selections left and it seemed like a trek to get there. When we finally got to the room it was much smaller than expected. The casino on the other hand was a site to behold. The America Restaurant has very slow service (somewhat typical of Vegas) as did Nathan&apos;s Hot Dog Stand on the second floor. We never did get a free drink. I would recommend staying somewhere else and visiting New York New York.

 I have not stayed At New York New York yet but I will be staying in there in April.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get a room upgrade?

I&apos;ve heard that upon check in, when you hand them your ID, if you slip them a 20 or 50 dollar bill along with your ID you MIGHT get a room upgrade.

Has anyone ever done this and does it work?

Is there a better way to do it?

 We selected the New York, New York for two reasons, we wanted a hotel with unique themeing...as well as one with a large room and a hot tub. We booked four months in advance, and were pleasantly surprised to find out we were getting what we wanted with the Players room.

After reading several other Guests experiences with the hotel, I noticed a pattern of problems that encountered with the front desk. Being somewhat anal retentive, I made it a point to notify the hotel 72 hours before arrival for confirmation. Although the lady I was talking with seemed a little impatient, she did confirm the reservation, exactly what our group was expecting.

Check-in was a rather lengthy process which only became more aggrivating when the clerk handed me the check-in statement which was not only 120.00 less per night, but for a simple deluxe room. He was more than understanding and patient with our needs, but what it came down to was the room we had booked, was being rennovated, and they were downgrading parties into basic rooms, since nothing else was available.

The situation only got worse when the Front Desk manager came out and preceeded to belittle myself and my roommate, as if it was our fault the room was unavailable, as if we were able to predict in advance this situation would happen. I soon began to realize that this was the type of individual that was not going to budge or even apologize for the inconvenience that we were experiencing, but to leave us with the impression that we should be honored and thankful to even be getting a room. Without even acknowledging the fact that the reservations department seemed to be completely disconnected from the operation of the hotel, we had to settle with a standard room, that was not even ready until 5:00PM.

As the rest of our party was still to arrive on a later flight, the front desk host notated the situation, and informed us that our party would be directed to express checkin where they would be able to pick up their room key.

As things would have worked out, our party never got that message, in fact they were told we had never checked in, a situation which I overted by nonchalantly loitering in front of check in for three hours, until they had arrived.

Unfortunately, that beginning was the end of our stay. Although we were forced to stay at the New York New York, we made sure that we spent as much time away from the hotel as possible.

The casino had a very warm feeling to it, almost a non stop progression of themeing and sound, however, it goes to show that you can build the most incredible resort possible, but who would want to go in after having the carpet pulled out from beneath you, and the&quot;token&quot;manager telling you to just be grateful getting in.

This type of attitude I could accept if I planned things at the last minute, or if I didn&apos;t place down a deposit, or if I didn&apos;t call 3 days in advance for confirmation. This is a testament to how unorganized a resort gets when it focusses more on making a profit than accepting the realization that the only way profit generates is by providing Guests with a worldclass experience that would only make them inclined to dropping their money by the hundreds or thousands.

And although I feel rather chinsey about harping this long about check-in and the crappy reception we received, I can only hope that anyone else who visits the NY NY knows what product they are looking for, and how much they are willing to compromise their values to receive it.
