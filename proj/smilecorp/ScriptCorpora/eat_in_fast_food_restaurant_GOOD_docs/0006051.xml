 El Cerro mobile review 
by Cait ( 1 review )
 July 09, 2012 I recently came here with two friends and we are very picky eaters...especially when it comes to Mexican food since we all worked at a Mexican restaurant together. This was, hands down, the best Mexican food I have ever had. The fajitas were amazing and my friends loved their burittos. I would come back to Raleigh all the way from Pennsylvania just to eat here.

 Fuji Japanese Steakhouse Just OK 
by Anne Smith ( 2 reviews )
 July 07, 2012 - I&apos;m sure their hibachi food is good, but I ordered the sushi and was not impressed. I ordered a salad with ginger dressing and that was not good either. The ginger dressing tasted like mayo with some ginger flavoring, eww. I ordered a california roll, cucumber roll, and shrimp tempura roll. The sushi rice was dry and cold and none of the rolls had any flavor. I usually don&apos;t use very much soy sauce but I had to just to give these rolls some flavor. I&apos;ve had way better sushi in Raleigh. The staff was nice and the atmosphere was nice. I went with my mom and she asked for some tofu, which was not on the menu, and they were nice enough to make it for her. Bottom line, I will probably not go back.

 Aversboro Restaurant&amp;Sports Bar Very Disappointing 
by David B ( 1 review )
 June 28, 2012 - Over a hour wait for our food. Service was just horrible - gave up on our server ever stopping by to check on refills. We just started getting up and going to the bar ourselves. After waiting an hour for our food were told they were out of the item we wanted. Owner said she would comp our meal but when it came time to settle we where charged over 62 $ for what amounted to 5 beers and 3 mixed drinks. We left disgusted. Its a shame - we would wear this place out if it was any good as we are within walking distance.

 Aversboro Restaurant&amp;Sports Bar Give it another try! 
by Chris Emory ( 1 review )
 June 27, 2012 I&apos;ve been going to this restaurant for the last 20 years and I think this iteration is the best yet. As with all new places there are kinks to be worked out and these two ladies seem to be doing an awesome job. They have a new menu with a lot of great choices and prices have been lowered on a lot of the food and drinks. One of my favorites is the Wendy City, italian sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms, and spicey mustard it is really good. Wednesday night there are cornhole tournaments at 7 and DJ/karaoke at 8. Thurs-Sat there is live music on the patio. I go almost everyday and the only achilles heel I have seen are the really busy nights they can get backed up but that holds true everywhere. All in all a really great place with good food. I highly recommend going.

 June 22, 2012 - So I came in for lunch on Thursday and was given the biggest hello you can get. I was sat and had not one but two servers helping me. One was in training. Suzie and Dave treated me like a king. There was a few other people in there and they where also having a good time with these two. Lunch was fast fesh and good. Had a Chef&apos;s Salad and it was a Salad I had to bring home cause it was big. I told a lot of my friends of the good time I had just eating lunch. Next week my office is coming back. Keep up the good work!!!!

 La Piazza Hight cost, very poor quality 
by Richard Vasconi ( 1 review )
 June 19, 2012 On June 19, 2012 I was totally disappointed with my Chicken Marsala. The meal came out slightly warm, that included the chicken, mushrooms, sauce, and potatoes. Chicken was tough. Nothing was freshly made and I was the first customer for diner. They want to be a high-end restaurant. They have raised the prices by 25% or more this past year. After this meal, I realize that they aren&apos;t worth the price. If I want old left over meat and potatoes, I&apos;ll buy a frozen dinner. I do like their lasagna greatly. I won&apos;t ever order anything expensive again from the menu again. The service was good, the bread was hot this time, and they had someone singing there, which was very nice. Oh, you can&apos;t order a large pizza at night or any sandwiches. Since this is really a low-class restaurant, they need to add that back on the menu to bring in a bigger crowd. Their pizza is very good.

 Aversboro Restaurant&amp;Sports Bar Wow what a place, Great Luck!!! 
by Ben P. ( 1 review )
 June 18, 2012 - Heard thru the grapevine that this place was under new ownership so I stopped by for a try. Better than expected. came in just after the ribbon cutting and got served quickly. order a burger and got cooked the way I liked it, which seems to be hard for some places. Friend had a chicken club and she loved it. Can&apos;t wait to eat there again!!!!

 Aversboro Restaurant&amp;Sports Bar New owners, not so new experience! 
by KGH ( 2 reviews )
 June 16, 2012 My husband and I have driven by this place several times recently and noted a bit of a crowd playing cornhole outside. We decided to give it another try to see if maybe those in the crowd knew something we didn&apos;t. Our previous experiences at this location were that we got canned and frozen / microwaved quality food. We went on a Friday night, and there were a lot of people who apparently had the same idea - it was busy. We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken promptly. When our server came back with our drinks, we ordered the fried okra appetizer, the grilled pork chop dinner for my husband and a burger with onion rings (an upcharge) for me. Our server came back twice - once to tell my husband they were out of mashed potatoes for his meal, then to tell him they were out of corn (his next choice). Another server brought our meals (though we hadn&apos;t yet gotten our app); we asked her to bring some utensils. The fried okra arrived a bit later, partially cold and not at all crispy. The okra appetizer was$4 and change - and was about 1/2 cup at most. My burger was below average and dry - the bun was room temperature. The onion rings didn&apos;t arrive at all - they sent fries out instead. I asked our server to make sure we weren&apos;t charged extra for the rings - she hadn&apos;t noticed that we didn&apos;t get them. Instead of offering to bring a fresh order of rings, she came back a few minutes later and said they couldn&apos;t take off the rings, but wouldn&apos;t charge us for one of our teas - which would come out about the same. My husband&apos;s pork chops were rubbery and slightly browned. The lima beans he ordered as his third choice were barely cooked and poorly seasoned (I know we like veggies cooked to death in the South, but his were crunchy!). We had to ask for the rolls mentioned as an accompaniment for his meal. Our drinks (tea, beer, margarita) and his rolls were the best things we had. All in all, disappointing. I really hoped that we had a good new neighborhood hangout in Garner We took most of the food home to share with our dog....

 June 12, 2012 - Been here a few times lately.... When it first opened it was the best restaurant in the White Oak area! The past few times I have been, I ordered chicken (I only eat chicken when it comes to meat) both times it has had some areas where it could have been cooked a lot more! My grilled chicken was raw in one corner, not cool! I will not be back!!!

 Aversboro Restaurant&amp;Sports Bar Great Place/Atmosphere 
by Eric Libby ( 1 review )
 June 05, 2012 - So I was a little hesitant to try this place out. I looked at a few of the reviews from a few years ago they were far from favorable. After speaking to the new owner, I was assured that my experience would be great. They were right. The food was well-presented and delicious. The staff was friendly and courteous and the drinks were well-priced and of good strength. I will be going back.

 TerraFin Station pan seared scallops, triple chocolate brownie by strawberryaudrey ( 5 reviews )
 May 18, 2012 - So happy with my first visit to terrafin. I ordered the pan seared Scallops and they were AMAZING! So fresh and yummy. DH ordered a steak (don&apos;t remember which cut) and also thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered the triple brownie for dessert and OH MY GOODNESS, it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! I wish we had gotten our servers name because she was absolutely wonderful in every way. We will go back again for a special occasion. The atmosphere is casual but the food is top shelf! And if you read the negative review by the guy complaining about the food don&apos;t believe it. I am one of the most critical people alive and this is one of the first restaurants in the area I have been so thoroughly happy with. Also there is a bar area and a dining room area but they are totally separate.

 + 3 more photos from QuakerHeel Charlie&apos;s BBQ&amp;Grille Different Can Be Good 
by QuakerHeel , Piedmont Triad
 ( 496 reviews )
 May 10, 2012 - This is a neat little place, with good to very good food, and friendly folks all around, both staff and customers, and they&apos;ve been around about 5 years now. Now, it is not your typical NC BBQ joint (Eastern or otherwise) in appearence, menu offerings, BB sauce, or service. The food is an eclectic melange of barbecue tastes and flavors, North Carolinian and otherwise, reflecting the tastes and experiences of Charlie. First off as to appearence - it is a relatively new place in a strip center somewhere on the outskirts of Clayton (I know, who knew Clayton even had outskirts) - easier to reach off I-40 than off US Highway 70. The walls are loaded with signs, newspaper articles, and photos - many dealing with Charlie Carden&apos;s career in law enforcement There are statutes of pigs, and pithy sayings, and tributes to veterans, and America, in general - a feel good place for most folks. None of the tables or chairs wobble, and none seemed scarred with names of old girl friends, or even older wives. The menu here is very broad for such a small place - Brisket, Ribs, BBQ Chicken, Pulled Pork (not at all chopped), Sausages, Angus Burgers, Chicken Tenders, Brunswick Stew, Fried Catfish, and even home made Chicken Salad, and Wings on Wednesdays. Sides are mainly the usual - Cole Slaw, Baked Beans, Collards, Buttered Potatoes, Fried Okra, and even Beer-Battered Onion Rings (add 59 cents). The smoked meats are cooked on racks (Butts on top for 12 hours, Ribs, and Brisket at the bottom, getting benefit of all the melting fat) using hard wood in an electric cooker - there is some smokiness, but not a huge amount in the taste. The pork is pulled, never chopped, but it comes out tender, not stringy as some pulled pork does. It comes out of the kitchen moist, but benefits from the house BBQ sauce - which is not as vinegary as most Eastern sauces, but it is not thick or overly sweet like Western sauces - this is a true hybrid pork product. The sauce is brought to the table heated, like that at Allen&amp;Son, where Charlie put in some time years ago. This pork makes a particularly nice sandwich. The portion size on the como plate was rather small. The Brisket is a&quot;wet&quot;version, tender, not at all chewy or stringy, with great flavor, with some nice outside crust. I imagine the Brisket Sandwich is a great item as well, even if a bit messy. The portion size on the Brisket was nice.The Hushpuppies are made using an old family recipe which was for fried cornbread, and calls for coarse cornmeal, giving the pups a crusty exterior and great taste The Collards are generally nice, just a tad sweet for my tastes. The Brunswick Stew (add 99 cents) is a fairly busy version, loaded with meat, and nice veggies - tasted fresh and clean. The Angus Burger is super, nesttled in a very well toasted bun, generously slathered in mayo. The Seasoned Fries are quite nice, and I generally avoid such items. The chili on the hot dog was much different from what I am used to - very thick, with chucks of tomato thru out - nice flavor from the Angus Beef - but, definitely not your Daddy&apos;s hot dog chili. The portions here are not huge, the prices are a bit high, especially when the portion size is factored in - We had Brisket, Pork and 2 sides, a hot dog and a hamburger and fries, and 2 drinks for just over $25.This is not a place that serves the traditional NC BBQ items, and the absolute purist will probably not be thrilled, but there is much to like here. The Brisket is outstanding, as is the Burger, and the Pork is far from bad, it is just a little different, and the service is outstanding. I&apos;ll try some Ribs, BBQ Chicken, and their Sausages on the next visit - and there will be a next visit. Drop by and see Charlie, and give his BBQ a try.

 Waffle And Cream Not worth the money by a long shot 
by David Bolton ( 1 review )
 May 09, 2012 - Disappointed, to say the least. I went to this place (which is within walking distance of my apartment) three different times before I found it staffed. During the previous times, no one next door would come wait on me—and the doorbell of the&quot;Ring Doorbell&quot;sign was missing. Stood in line for five minutes while the people in front of me decided on what they wanted. They wanted a banana split. Nope, no bananas. They wanted pineapple topping, like in the picture. Nope, no pineapple topping. They wanted two different kinds of ice cream in the 2-scoop sundae. Well, that&apos;s going to cost 50-cents extra. Why? Because we have to expend the effort to put the scoop into one kind of ice cream, and then ANOTHER kind of ice cream—duh. Ohhhh—well that makes sense. Wait, what? I tried the&quot;strawberry cake batter&quot;ice cream. For $2.96 I got a half-hearted attempt at a scoop of ice cream which was a dark solid pink and had some colored sprinkles in it. Strangely enough, it didn&apos;t taste like strawberry. Or cake batter. It took two glasses of water to wash the chemical taste out of my mouth, after I tossed the uneaten half into the garbage can. Seriously, ice cream has maybe five or six ingredients at the most. How these people managed to find a way to screw theirs up is beyond me. Oh, and by the way—the Char Grill next door SUCKS, and is expensive. If you want a good hamburger or hot dog, either go to Cook Out (which is INCREDIBLY cheap for the amount of food you get), or spend a little extra and go to Woody&apos;s in downtown Raleigh. And as far as ice cream goes—there&apos;s a little indie shop with a putt-putt near Food Lion off Tryon. Their Cookie Monster ice cream (with like, 12 different kinds of ground-up cookies) is AWESOME.

 La Piazza Great food 
by CF , Knoxville
 ( 24 reviews )
 April 24, 2012 - I really really enjoyed my pizza and pasta dishes at La Piazza. It is a strip-mall location, so I didn&apos;t expect much, but the food is really superb. However, beware that the house salad is some kind of bagged iceberg thing. I&apos;ve been skipping it altogether, which is a shame because there&apos;s a great opportunity to provide a decent Italian house salad. (I&apos;d even pay more.) My only complaint is that it&apos;s very noisy when it&apos;s busy, and I would have liked more privacy. But we&apos;re good with placing an order on a Saturday night and taking it home.

 La Piazza Okay, could have been a lot better 
by Fran03 ( 1 review )
 April 17, 2012 The food was excellent and the service was awesome. A couple things that my husband and I did not like was that the silver wear, you are only given one fork and one knife which to us is first off gross to use the same fork through out the whole meal. Secondly the owner, I think (not too sure because he wasn&apos;t dressed very professionally) was yelling at his employees in front of all of the customers which was disruptive to our dinning experience. This was our first time at La Piazza and until some changes are made, it will be our last.

 TerraFin Station mobile review 
by kjwaters ( 1 review )
 April 14, 2012 - FABULOUS!!! Well...we read the reviews and decided to ignore the two negative ones...and are we thankful. We had just returned from Norfolk Va. and had eaten at some of the BEST in the area for 4 days. TerraFin offers better prices for the same fabulous foods we had at some really upscale resturants. We were with 2 friends and all of us could only say WOW....aren&apos;t we glad we finally have food like this without having to drive to Raleigh or Durham. TerraFin for dinner is a nice place with GREAT food. Everything from the combo seafood plate, the Merlot marinated steak, the pan-seared scallops, the shrimp pasta dish I had was fabulous. The portions are just right (well, I did have to bring some of mine home...too good to leave behind). The wait staff were very attentive, boxing my leftovers and making sure our glasses were full. Melissa was our attendant..great job. We will be back again and again...and will be taking other friends and family. This is the best dining experience we have had in area. We like Applebees and Ruby Tuesday&apos;s and love Cracker Barrel...but that is the same experience every time....for something that gives your tastebuds a NEW invigorating experience this is the place....I only wish I had room for dessert...they look and sound wonderful.

 Clubhouse at Cleveland Square mobile review 
by David Green ( 1 review )
 April 11, 2012 - EXTREMELY disappointed...first and last time visiting....ordered the Dutch House wings after recommendation from wait staff. Described as&quot;dry-rubbed and spicy&quot;by the waitress. When they arrived, they reminded me of convenience store fried chicken that had been under a heat lamp for too long. Beyond crispy is an understatement and the meat chewy. So, I tried the wings prior to complaining. They lived up to their look. Terribly dry, chewy and tasteless. I ate one and a half wings. Long story short, I brought this to the attention of the waitress and management. Management told me that of I just didn&apos;t like the food, there was nothing he could do about it. If there was something wrong with the food, he could do something about it. Well, other than everything I just told him, the meal was excellent....I was disappointed to say the least. No offer to comp, no offer to replace it, just a disappointing feeling left to a first time customer. Good service, taking care of the customer would have brought me back for a second chance. I received neither, I won&apos;t return.

 TerraFin Station Love this place 
by Rags ( 1 review )
 April 05, 2012 - We have been back several times and TerraFin is one of our favorite places to eat. Food is very good. We have had the tilapia, fried haddock, lobster mac n cheese, hamburgers, stuffed mushrooms and several other specials. The food was nicely plattered and ample in serving. The veggies were all fresh. The pecan pie is homemade and great. Decor is tasteful. Nothing fancy but it does include pics of all the local spots in the Garner (40/42) area. Porter&apos;s Strawberry, the birdhouse builder, exit sign off 40....Each time we have eaten there the restaurant has been very busy. Our wait staff has always been attentive. We will recommend to friends and will continue to return for good food with a reasonable price and I wouldn&apos;t compare the food served here to Applebee&apos;s or Ruby Tuesday. I think it&apos;s better.

 Larry&apos;s Southern Kitchen Fried chicken, smothered chicken, BBQ ribs, fried trout, chicken and dumpling, collards, cabbage and etc.... by Angelo Peyton Jr ( 1 review )
 March 27, 2012 Well, I&apos;ll have to say the comments that I had read were oh so true. I currently live in Texas but my parents live in Garner, NC. My sister and I both flew down for their anniversary and we had opportunity to go to Larry&apos;s to eat. Outside wasn&apos;t much to luck at, but when you open the door the smell of this wonderful food hit your stomach. The buffet was a smorgasbord of all my favorites without my mom having to cook for several days. The food was hot and delicious. Everything that crossed my lips was on point from the fried chicken to the pig feet. Normally I prefer catfish, but that boneless fried trout was on the money. The vegetables are too die for. The collards and cabbage were cooked to perfection. I didn&apos;t have any of the deserts but I also didn&apos;t have any room left. There were also several other items I didn&apos;t get to try but will tackle on next visit. The service personnel were courteous and fun! I guess they could tell I enjoyed the food by the amount of plates I went thru, leaving nothing but bones! will definitely return on my next visit to N.C as the first place I dine at. Wish they would open a restaurant in Elgin Texas! Definitely 4.75 stars

 Larry&apos;s Southern Kitchen TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! 
by LLC ( 1 review )
 February 26, 2012 - My experience at Larry&apos;s&quot;Southern&quot;Kitchen was terrible! It was one of the worst experiences that I have had at a restaurant. I put the word southern in quotation marks, because I use the term southern loosely when referring to this restaurant. I decided to go there because I heard rave reviews from friends. When I approached the&quot;buffet&quot;(once again used loosely), I wondered where the rest of the food was! The food selection was extremely limited and looked very unappealing. However, I stayed there and hoped that it would get better. I agree with another reviewer about the food being tasteless. I was wondering how one could run a southern restaurant yet not apply any seasoning to the food? HELLO? The term&quot;southern&quot;means that the food is seasoned....and seasoned very well. I can&apos;t understand why anyone can say that the food is good. Please help me understand. Furthermore, the price was very high for the limited food selection offered on the buffet, and the fact that the quality of the food was very poor. The price was $9 for the buffet and an additional $1.25 for a drink (plus tax). Also, the waitress was not attentive at all. I practically had to hunt her down in order to get a drink refill while I was still eating! Then when I asked for a drink refill to go, I was told that I would be charged an additional $1.25, just like buying another drink. They do not give free refills on drinks to go. Overall, the restaurant was substandard and the customer service was very, very poor. Needless to say, I never returned there for a second visit. Also, I have informed everyone that I know about my terrible experience and warned them that it is almost definite that they will have the same bad experience that I had.

 Fuji Japanese Steakhouse Gave them another try today... 
by Liz Winfrey Ventura ( 1 review )
 February 22, 2012 ...after having a pretty&quot;OK&quot;experience initially, but not fantastic by any means. Today, the first thing I noticed was a really bad smell as we walked in the door. It almost smelled like vomit. The smell got a little better the further we walked into the restaurant, but never completely went away. My friend complained that the floor was sticky, so I don&apos;t think I want to even ask about that... We sat down, had our drink and appetizer orders taken without a hitch. My friend and I both ordered Diet Dr. Pepper which tasted pretty bleh. I mentioned this to the waitress (who I don&apos;t think understood me completely to begin with). She said&quot;It tastes fine to me.&quot;Well, that&apos;s nice for her. Obviously if you have two people who drink Diet Dr. Pepper often and don&apos;t think it tastes right, something is probably not right. 2 against 1... anyway... we ended up having water. I was not thrilled with the professionalism of the waitress with this issue. The chef was very animated and I enjoyed the interactions with him. I&apos;ve actually had a lot of luck with the chefs at this particular Japanese Steakhouse. They tend to be quite entertaining here versus other restaurants. Unfortunately, he did not cook my filet mignon the way I wanted, so I was pretty disappointed with my food. I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll be giving this restaurant another try.

 Garner Mayflower Seafood This place is horrible! 
by Ellen ( 1 review )
 February 18, 2012 Me and the family visited this hot mess! After standing waiting for some one to sit us for 10 mins I noticed another group waiting to pay and leave! This should have been a major hint... Well we ordered. If three people at your table get a salad or soup the fourth person gets to eat crackers.. Not like normal seafood places that start you off with hush puppies. My food was horrible! The one person that paid attention to my reaction was a bartender! She saw me turn white and was there! She would be the only reason why I would ever return! Meanwhile I saw the Manager of the joint carry my sons hamburger to a wrong table, take it back to the kitchen and serve it right on up to my son 10 mins later. Dont go here! If you do- go to the bar! The bar tender will treat you right!

 TerraFin Station Overpriced Food, Bad Service, Bad Atmosphere 
by James Willis ( 1 review )
 February 17, 2012 Let me start by letting you know how we found this restaurant. We received a coupon in the mail with a very appealing look to it. This restaurant isn&apos;t too far from where we live so we thought we would check it out. We went online and looked at their website and read all the reviews we could find. We were very impressed by all the good reviews we found online. There were very few bad reviews, but lots of great ones. We normally avoid places with bad reviews, but there were so many great ones and since we had the coupon we thought we&apos;d try out this casual/fine dining restaurant. We came to the&quot;fine dining&quot;conclusion based on the prices of their entrees. Once we got there we could tell the place is basically just a bar that was trying to serve upscale food at upscale prices. Again, against our better judgment and based on the reviews, we decided to stay and give it a shot. They were not overly busy, there were several empty tables, but had a decent crowd. It took several minutes before our drinks were delivered. We&apos;re used to restaurants with these types of prices having something complementary on the table while you wait for your meal - bread, cheese&amp;crackers, chips, or something. Nothing was brought out. We ended up waiting over 45 minutes for our food to finally arrive. Once our food arrived, we could tell it was low-scale Applebee&apos;s-like food but cost about $10 more per dish…not worth the money they were asking for it. The filet steak was not cooked as ordered. We asked for it to be medium-well and there was no pink at all in the steak and the edges were actually charred. The baked potato was the smallest I&apos;ve ever gotten at a restaurant, ever. The tilapia was so small you could barely find it with 3 small pieces of broccoli as the side. Our server was never around when needed and they weren&apos;t that busy. She actually stood at the bar talking to co-workers while she was supposed to be running our payment. This was just an all-around, horrible, Valentine&apos;s day experience for us, especially when you&apos;re talking about a $50 or more bill. We&apos;ve been to places before where the food wasn&apos;t the greatest, but service was good, or maybe the atmosphere was great. This place offered none of that…everything about the experience was bad. Please, please read this and highly consider the negative reviews before you go. I know what you&apos;re thinking…we just had a bad night and the good reviews outweigh the bad. But we really wish we&apos;d have paid more attention to the bad reviews because they were spot on. For the money you&apos;d spend here, you could have went someplace nicer, with better portions, much better service and much better price. Based on our experience, from now on when we see bad reviews we will definitely give them more consideration and hopefully you will too.

 La Piazza Never Disappointed 
by Lydia B ( 1 review )
 January 30, 2012 My husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed La Piazza becoming a part of our community. The food is wonderful whether we get takeout or dine in. We were just there yesterday with a group of eight and once again, the experience was great. Our waiter, Eric, went over and beyond to make sure we were accomodated. People can be quick to crticize, so just wanted to give commendation where it is due!
