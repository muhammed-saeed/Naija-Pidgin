 IateApie.net provides reviews of food products 
with diet&amp;nutritional claims such as low fat, low carb, reduced sugar, 
less sodium and whole grain. Try Jamba Juice Oatmeal for a Buck By: Tanya Taylor, PhD | Mar 4, 2009 
 
 

Looks like oatmeal is the next big &apos;healthful&apos; thing being offered by fast food restaurant and Jamba Juice recently introduced, Steel Cut Oatmeal is getting rave reviews. SeriousEats.com did a taste test of oatmeal from Au Bon Pain, Cosi, Pret a Manger, Maoz, Jamba Juice and Starbucks, and Jamba Juice Oatmeal came out the winner.

All March long, Jamba Juice is offering a coupon that lets you try their steel cut oatmeal for just $1.00. Visit OatmealforaBuck.com to get it (regular price is $2.95).
 
 Jamba Juice Oameal is steel cut, slow cooked in soy milk, organic oats topped with either Apple cinnamon, Blueberry-blackberry, or fresh banana, as well as with a brown sugar crumble .

The Fresh Banana Oatmeal has 280-290 calories (50-70 calories from the fruit and 40 calories from the brown sugar crumble)

 Starbucks Oatmeal , which we reviewed , comes pre-packaged. All the barista does is add hot water, and stir, bu it is only 140 calories.
