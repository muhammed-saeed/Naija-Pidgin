 subman Feb 12 at 12:25 PM I got a call from this 760-705-8888 number I own a subway franchise, this indian dude claimed he was from subway corp. claiming i had won some free t-shirts and things, he said some guy named john will bring them to me by 11am tom. he said he needed a verification number he first asked me for my cell phone numer so he can text it to me. at that time i was a little suspicious. Because first of all if he&apos;s calling from subway he should already have my cell number. so i told him i dont have a cell so then he said ok u will get a call back from an automated system with the number, i said fine. so i got the number and it said craiglist and i was like wtf. so the guy called back and asked for the number when i asked for his name he said john. then i asked him for the number to subway corp, which he didn&apos;t know so at that point i know it was a scam and i told him im not gonna give him the number so he said go to hell and hung up LOL 12 people marked this helpful Mark Helpful Reply This comment was marked as spam.

He has a strong accent. Mark Helpful Reply A Web User Jun 25 at 03:45 PM Was working in a convenience store and this number called the phone. It was a guy with an Indian accent saying that someone would be coming by the next day with shirts and hats and that he was going to send me a confirmation number for me to give the delivery guy. He said that it was computerized and needed to be texted to someone in the store so he needed someone&apos;s cell number, and that he would call back to get it. Gave him my cell number, like an idiot, and got a text from craigslist with a secret code which also said that any request for the number is a scam and not to give it away. He immediately called my cell and then called the store about 6 times and I hung up on him each time. This guy is apparently trying to create accounts on craigslist, probably to scam other people, using google voice.

Number dose its job when they called last time Mark Helpful Reply Deebee Nov 07 at 07:27 PM They called from a Houston, Texas number first (only rang twice) than 30sec later from this California # which according to this site is a generic Google voice #. I sure wish I phone had call block Mark Helpful Reply R Nov 07 at 06:10 PM It&apos;s just a Google free call program. My realtor called me using this program testing it out and I let it ring and heard voice mail. It can be used to make prank calls which can be annoying so if so have cell phone carrier or LAN line carrier place block and its free to do so and it works.

Indian/Pakistani man named Alex who spoke in very broken English. He claimed to be from Shell Oil corporate and was going to have Free T-Shirts and Hats delivered. Told me to Hang up and wait for automated call from #310-928-7055. Received automated call with password linked to unidentified Craigslist promotion. Recived call back from Alex, asking for password. When I questioned him, he became very agitated, I could hear multiple voices in background, sounded like a boiler room call center. Told him I would not give him the password and wanted to speak with somebody in charge he gave me the #541-481-5181 and somebody named Bill Scamph.

Mark Helpful Reply A BlackBerry User Oct 06 at 08:09 PM My cell phone never rang so it must be an&quot;unknown&quot;or&quot;private&quot;number Mark Helpful Reply A Web User Dec 12 at 02:30 AM I get tend to get those calls from&quot;UNKNOWN&quot;numbers as well. Usually it only happens during the work hours, naturally, so I just hit ignore so I don&apos;t distract my fellow co-workers. But, ONE DAY, I tried to call them BACK and of course, it doesn&apos;t have a real number. I was FINALLY sick of the whole thing so AFTER work one day (like 5:30 or so), I ANSWERED the call and it was actually for a credit card OFFER. It wasn&apos;t for your normal Visa companies like Chase, Capital One, etc. It was for some bank I&apos;ve never heard of. Therefore, not a bank in my area (I live in Richmond, VA). Maybe legit, maybe not. Also, the credit amount was EXTREMELY low--only $300 and it had a&quot;processing fee&quot;as well. Something like $45. I made up some story that I had some big-time inheritance check coming in the next couple of weeks and I wouldn&apos;t need the cash. Mark Helpful Reply A Web User Dec 12 at 02:31 AM This guy was a total prick. He wouldn&apos;t get off the phone. He was CONVINCED that I needed cash (which I guess we could all use extra cash) and was extremely abrasive. I finally just hung up. On the 25-30 minute ride home, he called 3-4 times, but, of course NO MESSAGE.
