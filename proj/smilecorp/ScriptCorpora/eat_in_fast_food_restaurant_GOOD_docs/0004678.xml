A promise kept. 



When Seville was first introduced, it was to be a new kind of American luxury car. International insize. 
Cadillac in craftsmanship. Timeless in styling. Some wondered. Seville has kept its promise. With 
subtle refinements to enhance its original concept. Because of our ongoing quest for perfection, 
Seville is even more desirable today . . . one of the finest production cars built anywhere 
in the world. Your Cadillac dealer invites you to experience Seville. It&apos;s the only way.

ill 



In the heart of Germany there is 
a race course called the Nurburgring. 

An awesome giant of a track, gen- 
erally acknowledged to be the most 
arduous test of both cars and men. 

All of the world&apos;s great high-per- 
formance cars have raced there- 
most have had their day. 

Yet, few cars— and certainly no 
luxury sedans— have achieved a more 
impressive record on the Nurburgnng 
than those built by the Bavarian 
Motor Works of Munich, Germany 

Luxury sedans? Yes. But luxury 
sedans built by racing engineers. 
German engineers who believe that 

ql 1977 BMW ot North America. Inc 



extraordinary performance is the only 
thing that makes an expensive car 
worth the money 

PERFORMANCE PERFECTED 
ON THE RACETRACK . 

While It IS, of course, feasible to 
develop an acceptable automobile in 
the relative vacuum of the test track 
and the laboratory it is virtually 
impossible to simulate the perfection 
demanded by motor racing. 

Motor racing enables BMW 
engineers to develop ideas and 
expenment without the inhibiting 
constraints of economics or the cost 
of production— a crucial role in the 



development of a true high-perfor- 
mance automobile. 

And the BMW 530i is a direct 
reflection of this cache of engineenng 
intelligence. 

Its suspension— independent on 
all four wheels— IS quick and clean 
through the corners; its steering 
sharp and accurate. 

Its four-speed manual transmis- 
sion (automatic is available) slips pre- 
cisely into each gear And its 
acceleration comes up smoothly with 
the turbine-like whine so charactens- 
tic of the justifiably renowned 3-liter 
BMW engine.

PARTICIPATION NOT ISOLATION . 

The interior of the conventional 
luxury sedan is deliberately engi- 
neered to isolate the dnver from the 
mechanical workings of the automo- 
bile, the world outside and the road 
beneath. 

The intenor of the BMW 530i is 
carefully engineered to include the 
driver as one of the integral, function- 
ing parts of the car itself— the human 
part that completes the mechanical 
circuit. 

Careful study has been made of 
the critical interrelation between seat 
location, visual position, steering 



wheel, pedals and controls. 

Luxurious? Yes. Yet all functions 
have been assiduously planned to 
facilitate total, precise control at all 
times, under all conditions. 

So successful is this integration 
of man and machine that when you 
drive the BMW 530i for the first time, 
you will experience an almost total 
oneness with the car A unique feel- 
ing of effortless control which, if 
you&apos;re accustomed to conventional 
luxury sedans, will be completely and 
pleasantly new to you. 

Surprising? Only to those who 
have never driven a BMW. 



As the editors of Motor Trend 
magazine observed, &quot;The reaction 
to a BMW is always the same. The 
first time dnver takes the wheel 
and after a few minutes no other 
automobile will ever be the same 
again.&quot; 

If the thought of owning such 
a car intngues you, call us anytime, 
toll-free, at 800-243-6000 
(Conn. 1-800-882-6500) 
and we&apos;ll arrange a 
thorough test drive for 
you at your convenience.

Michael M. Ames, professor of 
anthropology and director of the 
Anthropology Museum at the Uni- 
versity of British Columbia, was 
instrumental in giving visitors un- 
limited access to everything the 
museum owns, thanks to a system, 
initiated in 1976, that he describes 



as &quot;visible storage.&quot; Although he 
did his first research among North- 
west Coast Indians, Ames became 
interested in Sri Lanka while pur- 
suing Southeast Asian Studies in 
graduate school. He has made 
three field trips to the island to 
study religion and social change. 




For the past ten years Len Aron- 
son has worked for the Society for 
the Protection of Nature in Israel. 
The behavior and ecology of the 
Nubian ibex has been the focus of 
his recent fieldwork, which ties in 
with the Israeli government&apos;s desire 



to preserve this species. As senior 
instructor at the Ein-Gedi Field Sta- 
tion, located on the shores of the 
Dead Sea, Aronson is also deeply 
involved in educational programs 
to increase the public&apos;s awareness 
of its natural surroundings. 




An associate curator in the De- 
partment of Herpetology, Charles 
J. Cole began his career at the 
American Museum of Natural His- 
tory after receiving his Ph. D. from 
the University of Arizona, His 
study of parthenogenesis in lizards 
was an outgrowth of his investiga- 



tion into evolutionary relationships 
of reptiles and amphibians and how 
species are formed. Cole&apos;s herpet- 
ological perambulations have taken 
him to many a lonely stretch in the 
Southwest and in Mexico. Asked 
about his future research plans, he 
responded, &quot;More of the same.&quot;

QUESTERS 
WORLD OF 
NATURE ^ 
TOURS 



&quot;Nature tour&quot; has a special meaning when 
you travel with Questers. We are the o«/y 
professional travel company specializing ex- 
clusively in nature tours. 

Our approach in planning Worldwide Na- 
ture Tours is to provide you with the broadest 
possible opportunity of experiencing for 
yourself the natural history and culture of 
each area we explore. With the leadership of 
an accompanying naturalist, we search out 
the plants and animals, birds and flowers. . . 
rain forests, mountains, and tundra . . . sea- 
shore, lakes, and swamps of the regions we 
visit. We also study the architecture, archae- 
ology, museum collections, temples, and cus- 
toms of the people. 

Varying in length from 4 to 36 days, Ques- 
ters Worldwide Nature Tours travel to virtu- 
ally every part of the world. Groups are small, 
and early reservations are therefore sug- 
gested. Listed below is a sampling of the 31 
destinahons offered in 1978. Detailed itin- 
eraries for each tour, and the current Direc- 
tory of Worldwide Nature Tours outlining 
the complete 1978 program, are available from 
your travel agent or Questers.

A native Texan who has just 
moved to Canada, William Cade, 

shown here with his daughter Tamez, 
is assistant professor of biological 
science at Brocic University in 
Saint Catharines, Ontario. In 1972, 
while doing graduate work at the 
University of Texas at Austin, 
Cade became curious about crickets 
and other insects that communicate 
with each other acoustically. &quot;I 
began graduate school during a pe- 
riod of virtual revolution in evolu- 
tionary theory,&quot; he says, &quot;and 
my scientific interests changed 
from cell biology to ecology and 
the evolution of animal behavior.&quot; 
He subsequently wrote his doctoral 
thesis on the sexual behavior of the 
field cricket, readily observed in 
Texas. Since crickets and their rela- 
tives are agricultural pests in the 
United States and other parts of the 
world. Cade hopes that his basic re- 
search may also prove utilitarian. 



In the belief that anthropology 
students become better anthropolo- 
gists if they understand their own 
culture, Conrad P. Kottak, who 
teaches at the University of Michi- 
gan in Ann Arbor, has spent consid- 
erable time at a nearby McDonald&apos;s 
restaurant. The data he has gath- 
ered there contribute to the material 
he uses in his undergraduate an- 
thropology courses. Kottak plans 
to examine the significance of such 
manifestations as Walt Disney&apos;s 
creations, the movie Star Wars. 
and the effects of advertising and 
politics on American pop culture. 
In pursuit of more information on 
these subjects, he frequently 
watches television, reads maga- 
zines, and accompanies his children 
to diiferent fast-food restaurants. 





A naturalized United States citi- 
zen, Richard Goody has been at 
Harvard University ever since he 
came to this country from his na- 
tive England twenty years ago. He 
has been interested in planetary 
astronomy for an even longer pe- 
riod. Currently a professor of 
planetary physics. Goody got his 
B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees 
from Cambridge University. His 
present research centers on the 
meteorology of Venus, Martian 
dust storms, and the plasmasphere 
of Jupiter. His future projects in- 
clude studying the satellites of the 
outer planets. Goody is a Fellow of 
the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, a member of the National 
Academy of Sciences, and the 
author of several books.

Last summer, Mr. Hanns Ebensten 
made one of the most exciting and 
enjoyable survey expeditions of fiis 
life, in Nortfiern Canada. 

In collaboration witti fi^anitoba Gov- 
ernment Travel, we now proudly offer 
small groups of travelers tfie first op- 
portunity to visit this wonderfully 
rewarding region: 



AUGUST 24 TO 30, 1978 

AUGUST 27 TO SEPTEMBER 2, 1978 

We travel north from Winnipeg by 
plane to our lodge base, and make 
forays by helicopter and boat to see 
polar bears, caribou and moose; we 
hike over the immense tundra which 
is at this time covered with a pro- 
fusion of wildllowers and berries: the 
area is particularly rich in shore birds 
and water fowl: the estuaries of the 
Bay abound with whales; and there is 
a notable lack of human activity.

A Matter of Taste 



by Raymond Sokolov 



Grounds for Delight 



When carefully brewed, 
a cup of coffee can 
overwhelm the senses 



As I grow older, I incline more 
readily to the view that the whims 
of the aged should be treated with at 
least grudging respect. For instance, 
I side with the senescent but nor- 
mally sophisticated New York pub- 
lisher whose quirk it was to take 
iced coffee with lunch — every 
lunch. After a long career, the pub- 
lisher moved his office to a building 
directly across the street from an 
expensive French restaurant whose 
proprietor, a martinet in almost 
every respect, surpassed even his 
usual hauteur on the day he refused 
to serve the elderly bookman coffee 
with his timbale de homard. That 
this misplaced gastronomic strict- 
ness cost the restaurateur thou- 
sands of dollars in expense account 
editorial lunches (and that similar 
acts of rudeness soon alienated 
many more clients and forced the 
restaurant to close) is a just and fit- 
ting reminder that fine dining should 
not be encumbered with rigid rules. 
On the other hand, it is fair to say 
that the literary graybeard had vio- 
lated good taste, but he did so in a 
thoroughly American way. 

Few commentators on our do- 
mestic habits — even Tocqueville 
neglected this point — have re- 
marked that, unlike the people of 



other cultures, Americans swill cof- 
fee with their meals. This is an 
abomination almost as noxious as 
the Scandinavian predilection for 
combining food with glasses of hard 
liquor, for coffee is one of the very 
few things we can consume that has 
a truly bitter taste. By itself, a care- 
fully brewed, aromatic cup of cof- 
fee is a wonderful thing. It does not, 
however, go with either meat or 
fish. Coffee does complement 
sweet foods, and I think that the 
insistence of some European res- 
taurants that coffee must always be 
a separate course served with cere- 
mony after dessert is needlessly 
fastidious. Yet this severity points 
in the right direction. Good coffee 
is a rare and hard-won treat, diffi- 
cult to prepare and worth attending 
to without the distraction of other 
tastes and smells. Really good cof- 
fee can be as overwhelming to the 
senses as a fresh truffle. I recall 
tasting a cup, absentmindedly, after 
a splendid dinner in a Brazilian ex- 
patriate&apos;s house and snapping to 
surprised attention. I complimented 
my host, who explained, somewhat 
embarrassed at my slowness, that 
he was an importer; coffee was his 
business. 

You don&apos;t have to be a Brazilian 
coffee broker to have good coffee 
at home, but it helps. Coffee is not 
a simple drink. It is much more dif- 
ficult to be sure of finding good 
coffee than it is to know that you 




24 COLOR SLIDES 

of the Great Impressiomst 
Masterpieces for only $J 



(comparable value $18 to $24) 







Includes this Deluxe 
Album and 48-page Gallery 
Lecture Guide— at no extra cost 



/^AZE in astonishment as Renoir&apos;s 
^-^ lovely &quot;Seated Bather&quot; (shown 
above) appears on your wall aglow with 
all the vibrant reds, blues and greens 
of the Impressionist palette. Or, thrill 
to Rembrandt&apos;s famed &quot;Aristotle Con- 
templating the Bust of Homer&quot;— one of 
the world&apos;s costliest works of art. Or, 
marvel as you view Titian&apos;s allegorical 
masterpiece &quot;Sacred and Profane Love&quot; 
just as it appears in Rome&apos;s Borghese 
Gallery. 

Until today, unless you had the means 
to travel among the world&apos;s great mu- 
seums and private collections, you sim- 
ply could not know these paintings so 
intimately. Now, as a member of the 
McGraw-Hill Color Slide Program of 
Art Enjoyment, they are but a few of 
the magnificent art works you will en- 
joy and more richly understand as you 
view them in dramatic full-size and 
glowing original colors! 

Accept this $1 demonstration offer 

If you mail the attached card, you will 
receive a unique Album containing 24 
color slides of priceless works by Renoir, 
Monet, Degas and other important Im- 
pressionist painters. These exquisite 
slides are produced to exacting specifi- 
cations in Florence on 35mm. Kodak 
film. They come in individual 2&quot; x 2&quot; 
mounts and can be used in any home 
slide projector. (If you do not own a 
projector, see special offer below.) 

The color slides, however, are only 
one part of this elaborate Album. 
Bound into the center is an illus- 
trated 48-page book by Albert 



Chatelet, Director of France&apos;s re- 
nowed Lille Museum— with a guide 
to each of the slide pictures and 
the complete story of the Impres- 
sionist era. 
If this demonstration pleases you, you 
will be offered a new slide-and-com- 
mentary Album approximately every 
six weeks. Among the Albums in this 
series are Italian Renaissance Painting- 
the Origins of Modern Art—Romanti- 
cism and Realism^and other Albums 
covering every major art period. 

The cost is surprisingly low 

The least you might expect to pay for 
24 color slides of comparable quality— 
if the subjects were available from mu- 
seums and private collections— is $18- 
$24. Yet, as a subscriber to this new Pro- 
gram, you pay only J7.95 for each com- 
plete Album— including slides and illus- 
trated guide book. You may take as few 
or as many as you like, and may stop

have laid your hands on a respect- 
able bottle of wine, because coffee 
is not labeled or controlled with 
anything like the precision of wine. 
Still, with the recent rise in coffee 
prices, a good cup of Mocha-Java 
may soon cost as much as a glass of 
Chambertin. 

Whatever other thoughts the cur- 
rent coffee shortage may provoke, 
when we pay more than $4 a pound 
for supermarket, canned, run-of- 
the-mill stufi&quot;, it is time to take a 
serious look at this curiously stimu- 
lating decoction of the fruit of C of - 
feci arabica, which we have been 
downing with such nonchalance for 
so long. 

A good cup of coflFee is the end of 
a complex chain of transmission 
that begins in such exotic tropical 
highlands as the Blue Mountains of 
Jamaica, the Colombian Cordillera, 
or the Harar district of Ethiopia, 
where coffee shrubs first grew in 
the wild. Coffee&apos;s cherry like fruit 
was eaten for protein and fermented 
for wine before its inner bean was 
boiled to make the beverage we 
love. By about 1600 it was well 
known in western Europe. Coffee- 
houses started up everywhere and 
became centers of urban social life. 
Louis XIV backed an ultimately 
successful French horticultural ef- 
fort that culminated in coffee plan- 
tations in Martinique (and subse- 
quently, all over the tropics of the 
New World). Coffee (whose En- 
glish name is a cognate of an Arabic 
word that probably came into the 
language via a Turkish variant) is 
now a worldwide or, at least, a 
third-world-wide crop. Green beans 
(what is left after the fleshy outside 
of the berry is removed) come to us 
from around the globe. And it is the 
devil&apos;s own job for the layman to 
choose among them. 

One certainty is that canned com- 
mercial coffee is the lowest echelon 
in the retail coffee marketplace. 
Brand-name coffees are blends, and 
they increasingly contain admix- 
tures of an inferior, insipid strain of 
coffee, C. robiista. Stepping up the 
ladder to whole roasted beans, we 
enter a chaotic but fascinating arena 
of warring claims. Quality beans — 
even if correctly labeled — come in 
many grades, from many places 
within the general growing area 
identified by a label. Just as hill- 
sides in Burgundy differ, so do hill- 
sides in coffee-growing regions of 
Costa Rica. At today&apos;s prices, one 



wants to be sure of what one is 
purchasing, but the fact is that the 
specialty coffee merchants have us 
by the short hairs. We can never 
be sure that the Medellin beans in 
the picturesque sack — side-by-side 
with many equally picturesque 
sacks — are as good as we would 
like. Some aficionados will taste 
whole beans or scrutinize them to 
see that they are not mottled, suit- 
ably uniform, and lustrous with oil. 

Roasting, especially the pro- 
tracted dark roasting favored by 
Italians and others in the know, 
brings oil to the surface of the bean. 
In my neighborhood, there used to 
be a wise old Italian coffee man 
whose store was dusty and aro- 
matic; he roasted his own beans 
every day on the premises. This 
was a rare opportunity and it ended 
when he closed up shop a few 
years ago. Now I see how impor- 
tant it is to get fresh-roasted beans. 
After a few days the oil begins to go 
rancid. To combat this, connois- 
seurs refrigerate whole beans in air- 
tight glass containers. They buy in 
small quantities, enough for a week 
or two, and grind what they need as 
they need it. Whole beans retain 
their flavor much longer than 
ground coffee. But, then, purists 
fight over which is the best kind of 
grinder and how fine to grind. Edu- 
cated opinion seems to align itself 
with burr-type electric grinders ad- 
justed to produce the finest grind 
short of powder (real pulverization 
vaporizes the oil and defeats the 
purpose of the exercise). All these 
gyrations lead ultimately to the par- 
lous act of brewing. Here, a few 
basic principles determine every- 
thing, and they are all meant to pro- 
duce a pure, strong coffee aroma. 

For the perfect cup of coffee, you 
must combine the best water avail- 
able, at a temperature just below 
boiling, with the best beans you can 
get. This must, logically, occur in 
some sort of vessel. Glass and ce- 
ramic finishes are ideal. Metal of 
almost any sort picks up an off-taste 
and/or adds its own to the coffee. 

Some people simply put coffee in 
an enamel saucepan, pour very hot 
water over it, wait until flavor de- 
velops, and get the floating grounds 
to settle to the bottom by adding 
eggshell or a small amount of cold 
water. Such &quot;prospector&apos;s coffee&quot; 
is as good as can be, but it is a mess. 
Indeed, figuring out what to do with 
the grounds is the main mechanical

problem of coflFee making. It has led 
to scores of solutions too familiar to 
mention. The filter-drip method is 
the experts&apos; favorite. You just fold 
up the filter paper around the 
grounds and throw them out. The 
urn is glass or pottery. And there 
you are. Except for one thing. Cof- 
fee gets cold and does not reheat 
well. A thermos is the best solution. 
It preserves the flavor, although 
aroma is irrevocably lost after those 
first few minutes. Cold coffee can 
be used for iced coffee or even 
drunk at room temperature. Any 
Italian cafe will serve you caffe 
freddo on request and without 
treating you like a lunatic. In 
Bologna, even cold coffee can taste 
good. 

Coffee also has a limited range of 
uses in cooking. Primarily, it shows 
up as a flavoring element in pastry 
cream, in ice cream, and in 
mousses. Since the cook in these 
cases wants intense flavor, but as 
little liquid as possible, freeze-dried 
coffee is a good source. It dissolves 
easily in a bit of cold liquid. Aroma 
is not an issue in a coffee eclair; so 
the usual deficiencies of freeze- 
dried coffee don&apos;t matter. And the 
flavor of freeze-dried crystals is 
generally superior to that of instant 
powder. 

Coffee is, of course, not only a 
flavorful drink, it is also a drug or 
rather it contains one, caffeine. Caf- 



feine may be harmful to some peo- 
ple&apos;s health, and it may keep some 
people up or make them jittery. 
Such people can always abstain or 
choose flat, decaffeinated coffee. Or 
they can opt for abstemious self-in- 
dulgence: they can decide to drink 
small amounts of very good coffee. 
Putting the standard two table- 
spoons of ground coffee into six 
ounces of water per cup twice a day, 
they will risk little and improve the 
enjoyment of life through astute ex- 
ploitation of a useful plant. It is also 
the case that one pound of coffee 
yields more than fifty such cups. 
And should coffee climb to $10 a 
pound, think of it as twenty cents 
per marvelous cup. 

So drink less and enjoy it more. 
T.S. Eliot had it all wrong. His 
character Prufrock should have re- 
joiced, not whimpered, when he 
said: &quot;I have measured out my life 
with coffee spoons.&quot; 

Raymond Sokolov is a free-lance 
writer whose special field of in- 
terest is the history and preparation 
of food. 

Errata: We regret mixing our 
fruits and inadvertently substituting 
a photograph of a fig tree for a date 
palm in October&apos;s column. Also, 
the figures for dates produced in 
California and imported dates 
should have read &quot;thousands of 
tons,&quot; not millions. 



Frozen Coffee Mousse 

4 egg yolks 
% cup superfine sugar 
2 tablespoons freeze-dried coffee 
4 egg whites 
1 tablespoon sugar 

1. Beat the egg yolks, superfine 
sugar, and coffee together until 
thoroughly mixed. If the coffee 
granules do not completely dis- 
solve into the mixture, proceed 
anyway to the next step. 

2. Heat the mixture from step 1 
in a heavy-bottomed saucepan 
over low heat. Beat constantly 
for 3 or 4 minutes with a whisk. 
When the mixture thickens, set 
the saucepan in a shallow pan 
containing cold water and con- 
tinue beating. This will give you 
a chance to mix in any remaining 
coffee granules and will also pre- 
vent the mixture from overcook- 
ing. Be alert during the cooking 
stage; as soon as the mixture be- 



gins to stick to the pan or to cur- 
dle, remove to the pan of cold 
water. 

3. Beat the egg whites until they 
form soft peaks. Add the sugar 
and beat some more, until stiff 
peaks form. 

4. Stir a quarter of the egg whites 
into the yolk-coffee mixture to 
lighten it. Then fold in the rest of 
the egg whites. 

5. Transfer the mousse to a serving 
dish. Place in the freezer. After 
an hour or so, fold the mousse 
into itself; some separation will 
probably have taken place. Be 
careful to preserve as much air 
and lightness as possible. Test 
the mixture again after another 
hour and fold again if necessary. 
Continue in this manner until 
folding is no longer necessary. 
Before sitting down to dinner, 
remove from the freezer to 
soften the mousse slightly.

of lasting beauty, 
meaning and value - to

heirlooms to future generations. There can be no 
better heirloom than beautifully leather bound, 
gold-decorated editions of the world&apos;s greatest books. 

Now, you can acquirelhis kind of private library 
from The Easton Press. 

The World&apos;s Greatest Books 

It isn&apos;t difficult to list the world&apos;s 
greatest books. Their titles spring 
instantly to everyone&apos;s mind, because 
what makes a book great is its ability to 
have a lasting impact on each new 
generation of readers. A book becomes 
great only when it is recognized as being 
great - generation after generation. 

Melville&apos;s Moby Dick, Dickens&apos; A Tale of 
Two Cities, Chaucer&apos;s Canterbury 
Tales, Plato&apos;s Republic, Thackeray&apos;s Vanity 
Fair, Fielding&apos;s Toyn ]ones, Hawthorne&apos;s 
icarlet Letter, Dostoevesky&apos;s Crime and 
Punishment, Homer&apos;s Iliad, Bronte&apos;s 
Wuthering Heights, Dante&apos;s Divine Comedy, 
Swift&apos;s Gulliver&apos;s Travels. Mark Twain&apos;s 
Huckleberry Finn and Milton&apos;s Paradise Lost. 

Books like these are the greatest books 
of all time. ..the books of lasting value that 
;ach family wants on its bookshelves. 

As Beautiful as They 
Kre Meaningful 

The pride that one feels in acquiring this 
edition of the world&apos;s greatest books 
:omes not only from the power and 
lignificance of each literary master- 
piece. It comes also from the sheer 
jeauty of each book. Every volume in 
his private library will exemplify the 
ultimate in the art of printing, illus- 
rrating and binding, 
tach of the volumes will be printed on 
:he highest quality paper. Each book is 
jound in genuine leather, and every 
/olume&apos;s binding is inlaid with real gold 
n a unique design that sets it apart from 
ill other volumes. 

Genuine Leather Bindings 

Today it is rare to find books bound in 
;enuine leather. The cost of such 
bindings and the time required to create 
hem has made the crafting of such 
bindings an almost vanishing art. 

iut each book in this collection will be 
lound in genuine leather! The leathers 




used will be only the finest, and many 
different types of leathers will be used - 
calfskin, cowhide, suede, sheepskin - to 
give even greater distinction to the total 
collection. 

As with every detail of these books, 
luxury in binding will be the rule rather 
than the exception. Each volume will 
have the beautiful lustre, wonderful 
feel, and distinctively rich smell that is 
characteristic of only genuine leather. 

Unique Cover Designs 

of Real Cold 

To further enhance the richness and 
beauty of your books, each binding will 
be decorated with real gold. Each cover 
design will be deeply inlaid with this 
precious metal. The back cover and the 
spine of each book will be similarly 
decorated. 

Cilt-edged Pages 

Complementing the gold of the leather 
cover&apos;s design is the gilt edging of every 
page. The pages of every book will be 
gilt-edged in real gold. 

Elegant in Every Way 

As final touches of elegance, each book 
will have beautiful endsheets of the 
highest quality, contain a bound-in 
ribbon page marker and be bound with a 
&quot;hubbed&quot; spine that is used in only the 
finest books. 

The result of all of this careful attention 
to luxury and elegance is a collection of 
books that brings back memories of the 
great private libraries of the most 
discriminating families in days gone by. 



Distinctly Different Volumes 

Distinctiveness is the watchword of this 
private library. No two volumes are the 
same. The leather used in the bindings 
will be of many colors and grains. The 
type styles and illustrations will vary 
from volume to volume matching the 
unique character of each of the 
individual works. The design on each 
volume&apos;s leather cover will be different, 
with no two alike. Even the sizes of the 
books in the collection will vary. 

A Most Important Family Heirloom 

To acquire this distinguished edition of 
&quot;The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written&quot; 
is to establish a family treasure that will 
be enjoyed now and passed on from 
generation to generation. 
Each of the books in this collection is a 
literary masterpiece. In addition, each 
volume is a work of lasting beauty. The 
elegance of the genuine leather 
bindings, decorated with real gold and 
crafted to the highest standards of the 
bookbinder&apos;s art, makes this private 
library an expression of true apprecia- 
tion of quality.

example of such a family treasure than 
this edition of the world&apos;s greatest books.

The Acquisition Plan 

Books of the quality of the volumes in 
this collection are not generally avail- 
able today, and they cannot be mass 
produced. Because of the extraordinary 
care and craftsmanship required of fine 
bindings such as these, the books in the 
collection will be issued at the rate of 
one per month. 





Subscriptions to The Easton Press 
edition of &quot;The 100 Greatest Books 
Ever Written&quot; will be offered only on an 
advance registration basis. Further, 
individual volumes of the edition will 
not be offered. This means that only 
subscribers to the collection can acquire 
this private library of distinction. 

Comparable books bound in genuine 
leather sell for as much as $50 to $75 
per volume. However, you will be 
pleased to learn the volumes in this 
collection will be priced at only $28.50 
each for the first two full years. Future 
volumes will be similarly priced subject 
only to minor periodic adjustment to 
reflect varying material costs. 

Thus, you can acquire &quot;The 100 
Greatest Books Ever Written&quot; at prices 
far lower than collectors have been 
accustomed to paying for similar fine 
books in the past. 

This favorable pricing is possible 
because the efficiencies of direct mail 
selling will enable us to place a larger 
print order than is usually possible on 
fine editions of this nature.

any books you do not want. A list of the 
100 books scheduled in the collection

The Great Energy Standofif 

by Luther P. Gerlach 



Shortages, Arabs, and 
technology may hurt energy 
plans, but they can&apos;t 
compare with a few 
determined Minnesota 
farmers 

On a small hill near Scott Jenks&apos;s 
dairy farm outside the town of 
Lowry in west-central Minnesota, a 
large hand-lettered poster pro- 
claims: &quot;God made this land for 
growing food, not for power lines.&quot; 

For five frigid November days 
more than a year ago, farmers and 
their townsfolk neighbors gathered 
on that hill to block surveying for 
construction of a high- voltage trans- 
mission line. A few weeks later I sat 
with some of the participants in the 
community room of the Lowry 
Lutheran Church, as they explained 
what had happened on the hill. 

&quot;We blocked them with our 
bodies and our equipment,&quot; ex- 
plained Scott Jenks, 59. &quot;We stood 
in front of the surveyors&apos; transits 
and their aiming stakes. And we ran 
chain saws so that they could not 
talk to each other by walkie-talkie. 
But there was no violence. We 
wouldn&apos;t have any of that.&quot; 

&quot;When the sheriff told one of us 
to move on, we did,&quot; observed 
Gurvin Femrite, 39, who came up 
to help Scott soon after trouble 
started. &quot;But then someone else 
just stepped in to take our spot.&quot; 

&quot;When I saw Scott and our 
neighbor Tony Bartos parking the 
silage wagon in front of the sur- 
veyors, I got worried,&quot; added Mrs. 
Jenks. &quot;We knew what had hap- 
pened over in Meeker and Stearns 
counties, you see. So I got on the 
phone and started calling the others 
in our group. And then they called 
others.&quot; 

Art Isackson nodded. &quot;And we 
came. I guess at one point we had 
200 out there. Not just farmers, but 
also people from the towns — busi- 
nessmen and others. And they 
came from all over. From some of 
the other groups in the other coun- 



22 



ties where the line will go. If this 
would have gone on another day or 
if we have to do it again, we would 
get maybe 500 out.&quot; 

&quot;Reporters and city people just 
don&apos;t seem to understand this,&quot; ex- 
plained Carolyn Koudela, 41, a 
farm wife and president of one of 
the resister groups. Save Our Coun- 
tryside, or SOC. &quot;We are very in- 
dividualistic. Our land is our land. 
Each of us will farm it in his own 
way, and no one can tell him he 
must change. But when one of us is 
in trouble, everyone will rush to 
help. Like when the tornado struck 
two or three years ago and hit a 
barn north of Lowry. Within two 
hours the neighbors had the live- 
stock rounded up and all the wreck- 
age cleared. So when our land is 
threatened by the power line, we all 
help. It&apos;s our way.&quot; 

&quot;I don&apos;t know how we would 
have fed 500,&quot; sighed Esther Hed- 
lin, 60. &quot;We had trouble as it was — 
but we managed. First we made 
coffee, and it went on from there. 
The more that was needed, the 
more we provided.&quot; 

&quot;One report in the paper said 
that you also fed the surveyors,&quot; 
I observed. 

&quot;Of course,&quot; smiled Mrs. Jenks, 
&quot;we really have nothing against 
them as persons. It&apos;s what they 
represent.&quot; (The surveyors were 
employed by two collaborating 
rural electric cooperatives.) 

&quot;Someone did let the air out of 
Kingsley&apos;s car tires — he&apos;s the co- 
ops&apos; field representative — but Scott 
had his son pump them right back 
up. 

&quot;I guess it was Kingsley who 
said on TV that we should all be in 
the slammer for what we were do- 
ing.&quot; 

When I asked if that was why 
they called the place where they 
resisted the surveyors Slammer 
Hill, they nodded alfirmatively. 
&quot;That&apos;s what we called it at first. It 
was a risk we were willing to take, 
being arrested. There is just no way 



we are going to let the line cross our 
land. But since it&apos;s our rights and 
our land we are fighting to protect, 
we gave the hill a new name.&quot; 

&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; 

&quot;Constitution Hill. The name&apos;s 
still up there on the canvas we 
stretched across the top of the 
township road. You have to see it.&quot; 

Later I did visit the &quot;Hill&quot;; I 
spoke to farmers and businessmen, 
and heard them express over and 
over why they believe the trans- 
mission line is a threat to rural life, 
to their health and welfare, to their 
ability to farm effectively and pro- 
duce food to feed the world, and to 
their sense of integrity and justice. 

Scott Jenks and his wife ex- 
plained how they built up the farm 
they had bought in 1952 with the 
last of their savings. &quot;We sold 
everything we had and moved up 
here with nothing but our car and 
some furniture. We had real rough 
sledding at first. Food prices were 
way down at the time. We were 
feeding hogs, but got nothing for 
them. But we made it. I can remem- 
ber wearing the same shoes, patch- 
ing the soles, year after year. But 
we raised six fine children and built 
a real fine operation. 

&quot;The two girls are nurses, and 
two of the boys are farming rental 
land. When they finished school, 
we sold the dairy herd; now we 
concentrate on small grains — 
wheat, soybeans, oats. And I also 
have a backhoe and do some earth 
moving on contract. We did a lot of 
work ourselves on our new house. 
We&apos;ve thought about selling rather 
than live under the line. But when 
prospective buyers hear that this is 
where the big line is going to come, 
they lose interest.&quot; 

&quot;I&apos;ve heard that the governor 
and some legislators are talking 
about the state and the co-ops buy- 
ing out a person who just cannot 
bear to live with the line,&quot; I com- 
mented. &quot;Would this satisfy you, 
particularly if they paid what you 
asked?&quot;

&quot;No, it&apos;s like being forced off 
your land. Maybe at one time if 
they would have offered us enough, 
we would have taken it. But now 
we are not going to give in.&quot; 

&quot;It&apos;s a principle we&apos;re fighting 
for — and a way of life,&quot; Carolyn 
Koudela explained. &quot;Family farm- 
ing is a good way of life. We are 
not all millionaire farmers. Many 
owe a lot for their land, for equip- 
ment, parts, and fertilizer. But they 
all take pride in what they do. And 
not just the elders. My husband&apos;s 
people have been farming here for 
three generations, and I am sure 
that there will be a fourth genera- 
tion for the simple reason that we 
have two sons, we have four daugh- 
ters. Some will be working else- 
where, but some will farm. They 
just love the land, this way of life. 
There&apos;s a freedom in it.&quot; 

&quot;We have 520 tillable acres of 
good soil, black and heavy,&quot; 
Gurvin Femrite declared, as we 
drove around his fields. &quot;We raise 
wheat, barley, com, and beans and 
feed up some beef cattle. Even 
though they called it a drought last 
year, we grew enough beans to win 
a five-state contest. We planted 
double rows. The prize was a trip 
to Las Vegas. We would never 
have gone otherwise; it&apos;s just too 
expensive. The power line is sup- 
posed to go right where we grew 
the beans. They take a 160-foot- 
wide easement and put the line in 
the center of it.&quot; 

We stopped on a corner of his 
land and looked around. Heavy 
winds had drifted the shallow snow. 
The land was broad and flat: 
Lowry, the highway, and Jenks&apos;s 
hill rose several miles to the east. 
It looked beautiful, even under the 
cold gray sky. As we drove on, 
Femrite interrupted my musing: 
&quot;That&apos;s the Hedlin&apos;s place over 
there, Esther and her brother.&quot; 

&quot;Was it Esther who said they are 
worried that the line goes over their 
drainage ditch and they won&apos;t be 
able to get a dragline in to keep it 
open?&quot; 

&quot;Sure, it&apos;s something to worry 
about. You need good drainage 
here. And it&apos;s the same if it goes 
over the Lowry sewage lagoon; 
they won&apos;t be able to dredge it.&quot; 

We turned into Femrite&apos;s place 
and he pointed out the metal barn 
he had just erected to store ma- 
chines and green crops. &quot;Accord- 
ing to the new route, the line would 



26 



be about 500 feet from it. And then 
it would probably go over where 
Myra has her vegetable garden. So 
we wonder, can we really keep on 
living here? Is it fair to our chil- 
dren? They are the fourth genera- 
tion of Femrites. But with the line, 
they will get the land in worse shape 
than when we got it. Mostly, we 
worry what may happen to them if 
they grow up under the line.&quot; 

Joining our wives for coffee in 
the Femrite&apos;s comfortable kitchen, 
we talked about the resisters&apos; con- 
cern that since &quot;the line&quot; is larger 
than anything else in the upper Mid- 
west — two direct current lines, 
each able to carry 400 kilovolts — 
they consider it a major, untested 
risk to health and safety. We dis- 
cussed how other power line resis- 
ters (especially Jim Nelson, 32, in 
Grant County — a farmer with a 
master&apos;s degree in physics), have 
put together reports that warn of 
the way such lines could emit ozone 
or produce electromagnetic fields 
and induced currents. 

&quot;The cooperatives tell us there 
is no risk, but when we read the 
reports of the Russian experiments 
and the testimony of those New 
York doctors. ...&quot; 

&quot;Marino and Becker? But their 
research was on 765-kilovolt lines, 
alternating current.&quot; 

&quot;Still, it makes you think. As 
Verlyn Marth says, 400 kilovolts in 
each line means 800 kilovolts. The 
point is, we just don&apos;t know. Now 
the state is going to have the uni- 
versity monitor the line for the 
effects of ozone.&quot; 

&quot;So we are the guinea pigs.&quot; 
Myra shook her head, poured more 
coffee. &quot;We and our three sons. 
Are we just supposed to wait and 
hope the co-ops are right? Is it fair 
to our children?&quot; 

Together with her neighbor Nina 
Rutledge, Myra leads a Cub Scout 
den. They talk about how they 
stood together on Constitution Hill 
all morning resisting the surveyors, 
singing &quot;God Bless America&quot; and 
&quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; to drown 
out the sheriff&apos;s attempts to read an 
order to disperse. Then they broke 
off, went home, picked up the Cub 
Scouts, and drove them to the TV 
station in Alexandria, some thirty 
miles away, so that the Cubs could 
see how a TV show was produced. 
At the station, one of the reporters 
stared at them, did a double take, 
and asked if he had not seen them 



before — on the Hill that morning. 

&quot;He seemed surprised,&quot; noted 
Nina. &quot;We were in a different con- 
text. Maybe at first he couldn&apos;t be- 
lieve that the same people who 
were on the Hill would also be den 
mothers.&quot; 

Nina and her husband, Dennis, 
are newcomers to the area. Dennis, 
an Annapolis graduate, was a Navy 
pilot, and still flies in the Reserve. 
But he grew up on a farm in Ben- 
son, Minnesota, and always wanted 
to get back to farming. Despite the 
risk in leaving the security of the 
service, he and Nina took the 
plunge in 1974 when they found the 
place they wanted, 210 acres on the 
highway outside Lowry. They were 
hit by drought, low prices for their 
corn and soybeans — and now the 
threat that the line would cross 
three-quarters of a mile of their 
land. &quot;But we&apos;ll make it. We&apos;re 
determined.&quot; 

Rutledges, Jenks, Koudelas, 
Femrites — newcomers or centen- 
nial farmers — they are all deter- 
mined to maintain their way of life 
against threats from the outside, to 
challenge and resist the power line. 
They are but a tiny sample of the 
resisters. Some 3,000 people have 
signed up as members of one or 
more of at least eleven resister 
groups — No Power Lines, in one 
part of Grant County; Save Our 
Countryside, in Pope; Keep Towers 
Out, in Steams — to name but a few. 
Hundreds came out to block the 
surveyors at Lowry. Scores came 
out to block the surveyors in 
Stearns and Meeker counties. 

Since spring of 1974, when the 
electrical cooperatives first sought 
easements for the line, hundreds 
have taken time out from planting 
and harvesting or braved the snows 
of winter to challenge the line and 
face the cooperatives in dozens of 
local meetings and regional and 
state hearings. They have contrib- 
uted uncounted hours and many 
thousands of dollars to fight the line 
not only in the hearings but also 
before the courts and legislature. 
Some of them have traveled to 
other parts of the country to leam 
about power-line fights or related 
energy matters. 

It has cost them in stress and 
anxiety: &quot;Well, it&apos;s really been 
something I never thought to ex- 
perience. It&apos;s all you think about 
day or night. I dreamed last night 
that the thing was finally settled.

I just can&apos;t believe this is happening 
to us. It&apos;s like a horrible dream. 
We have no control over what hap- 
pens; they just get their own way 
with the line.&quot; 

Yet many also say that through 
all of this, people and communities 
have been empowered, enriched; 
they have never been as together or 
as alert as they are now. They tell 
how this struggle has changed 
them, has opened their eyes to the 
need to be involved and not just to 
trust that things will work out. 

Theirs was the first power line to 
be routed according to the 1973 
Minnesota power plant and power- 
line siting legislation. This law au- 
thorized the Environmental Quality 
Council (EQC, a board comprised 
of the heads of seven state agen- 
cies, a governor&apos;s representative, 
and four citizen advisors) to deter- 
mine routes based not only upon 
recommendations from utilities but 
also from citizens. As good as this 
first seemed, the resisters quickly 
found flaws in it. 

&quot;The confrontations have been 
important,&quot; according to Harold 
Hagen, who has been challenging 
the line since January 1975. &quot;But 
now we need to change the legisla- 
tive procedures, which forced rout- 
ing the lines over productive crop- 
land.&quot; 

Hagen, 50, began farming in 1946 
at Starbuck, with 160 acres he has 
since built up into a 1,200-acre 
enterprise. He grows grain and com 
and keeps up to 12,000 chicken and 
turkey breeders. He spends as 
much as $400 a month on electricity 
to ventilate and light the breeders. 
I heard him speak eflFectively at 
hearings, meetings, and press inter- 
views. Now, he and I stood in the 
middle of the rolling, black-hued 
acres he had been harrowing and 
fertilizing with nitrogen sprayed 
from an ammonia tank hitched to 
his tractor. 

Hagen, who served on the citizen 
advisory task force to help site the 
line, described his frustrations: 
&quot;We were told that the line could 
not go over state parks and wild- 
life areas or down highway or rail- 
road rights-of-way. That forced the 
line onto farmland. Some say it&apos;s 
because the Department of Natural 
Resources (DNR), the Department 
of Transportation, and the environ- 
mentalists protected their turf. 
Some say it&apos;s because it&apos;s easier to 
build the line over flat farmland.&quot; 



A rare opportunity to share the exciting 

life of America &apos;s foremost 

artist-naturalist. 



J^ magnificent book for all those 
^ A. interested in birds, in nature, in 
the fight for our threatened environ- 
ment — and in the man who worked 
with the Audubon Society to make 
that fight America&apos;s own. 

The World of Roger Tory Peterson 
is a biography so eventful it reads al- 
most like fiction. FUled with stories of 
famous birdwatchers from Louis Agas- 
siz Fuertes to Elliot Richardson, it in- 
troduces you to a remarkable man in 
all his aspects ... a boy collecting 
wildflowers and ducking his father&apos;s 
razor strop ... a teenager photograph- 
ing birds and ruining his first romance 
by making a date of a 17-mile bird 
walk. 

Roger Tory Peterson was reported 
as a possible spy for standing with bin- 
oculars at five in the morning on Long 
Island&apos;s Suru-ise Highway looking for 
goldfinches. He explored 40 belfries in 
the Rhine Valley seeking storks. He 
lost his red cap and nearly his life pho- 
tographing supposedly extinct James&apos;s 
flamingos at 14,000 feet in Laguna 
Colorada in Bolivia. When he got a 
haircut on the Galapagos a hen scan- 
dens gathered each lock as it fell to 
line her nest, and on Femandina Is- 
land he was attacked as a rival by a 
bull fur seal. 




You&apos;ll travel with him from 
Galapagos to Greece, from New Eng- 
land to New Hebrides, from the Andes 
to Antarctica viewing rare birds from a 
unique perspective. 

This is a reading experience almost 
as intimate as a bird walk with Mr. Pe- 
terson as host and guide. 

A beautiful experience . . . 
a volume of great beauty. 

In shsuing the life and enthusiasms of 
Roger Tory Peterson, you will also en- 
joy the great talents of this unusual 
man. The book is handsomely and 
profusely illustrated with his own 
drawings and full-color paintings. In 
itself, it is a collector&apos;s item you will 
treasure and enjoy. The ideal gift for 
lovers of birds and beauty.

&quot;Where is the line going to cross 
your land?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;It&apos;s not, not now. It was on the 
cooperatives&quot; preferred route, but 
this route was shifted during the 
hearings.&quot; 

&quot;Yet you have been working just 
as hard since then to resist the new 
route.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, it&apos;s something that had to 
be done.&quot; 

I asked if it wasn&apos;t also true that 
some people were helping resist the 
line even though they never were 
affected by it. 

&quot;Yes, quite a few, like the 
Koudelas and Cloweses. If we 
don&apos;t work together now, we might 
be the ones in the future.&quot; 

&quot;It&apos;s not only morally wrong if 
each person only looks out for him- 
self and tries to shift the line onto 
someone else&apos;s land; it&apos;s also tac- 
tically wrong,&quot; Jim Nelson ex- 
plained to me in September 1974. 
&quot;The power company will pick us 
off one by one.&quot; As a township 
clerk, Jim was one of the first in 
Grant County to learn that the 
co-ops wanted to build the Une. 
In 1972 Nelson and his wife had 
joined his parents in farming 800 
fertile acres near Elbow Lake. 

Nelson had previously worked in 
the aerospace industry near Bos- 
ton. Now, just when the Nelsons 
were back to rural life, industry 
was going to march a giant power 
line right over them and their new 
house. As he saw it, the small rural 
co-ops, which had brought elec- 
tricity to the farms, had become 
giant companies little different 
from big utilities. He worried that 
once the line was in, other utilities 
would get permission to parallel it 
with other lines in a wide corridor. 
So he helped get a group going in 
his part of Grant County. No Power 
Lines— NPL— they called it. But 
he and his fellows also went out to 
urge others, in neighboring town- 
ships and counties, to form their 
own local groups to resist the line. 
Meanwhile, others were doing the 
same, elsewhere. 

&quot;The co-ops always look for 
some type of conspiracy to explain 
the way they have been con- 
fronted,&quot; Hagen once observed, 
&quot;but it&apos;s not that way. It has been 
spontaneous. Our organization sort 
of builds around the action.&quot; 

As resisters met, saw a common 
purpose, and stood together against 
what seemed to be the overwhelm- 



ing force of the power co-ops, they 
found ways to collaborate across 
the counties. They formed loose 
coalitions, appointing representa- 
tives from each local group to serve 
on a coordinating board. CURE, 
Counties United for Rural Environ- 
ment, emerged. 

Resisters also expanded their 
antiline network by telephoning and 
writing. The 240-acre Tripp dairy 
farm near El Rosa has become one 
of the nodes of this communication 
system. When the Tripps hear of 
someone in the state or across the 
country who has information the 
resisters need, a service they can 
use, or has shared common experi- 
ences, they will write or call. 

Not unnaturally, officials in the 
energy industry and in government 
have asked the resisters in Minne- 
sota and elsewhere what they pro- 
pose to do about getting electricity 
if the lines are not built. Employees 
of the embattled Minnesota co-ops, 
themselves becoming militant, have 
worn red badges lettered in black, 
&quot;If the lights go out, call CURE.&quot; 

There are alternatives, resisters 
respond. If you won&apos;t build the 
lines along highways or through 
parks, then build smaller power 
plants where the power will be 
used, use solar or wind energy, or 
put the lines underground. The co- 
ops explain that these are simply 
not currently feasible alternatives. 
But the resisters counter by charg- 
ing that the power companies are 
locked into obsolete technology. 

Showing us around his place in 
El Rosa, Virgil Fuchs observed 
that &quot;if I used the same technology 
I did even five years ago, I would 
be finished.&quot; He scoops into a bin 
of golden corn kernels to show how 
he preserves their food value by 
spraying them with a new chemical 
instead of using a propane drier. He 
wants to irrigate his new fields by a 
large center pivot system and to 
spray pesticides, herbicides, and 
even some seeds from the air. He 
fears the lines and towers on his 
land would prevent this. His wife, 
Jane, stepping down from one of 
their big tractors — a $40,000 invest- 
ment — admits that for the family 
farmer to survive, &quot;it&apos;s either grow 
bigger or get out.&quot; They need 
energy to grow, but if it comes 
through in a way that blocks their 
ability to use new methods of farm- 
ing, they feel that &quot;it just doesn&apos;t 
make sense.&quot; 



In March 1977, Will Mische came 
to a meeting of Keep Towers Out, 
or KTO, and asked members if they 
would like to try to send electricity 
without wires, using a method pro- 
posed in 1908 by Nikola Tesla. 
Virgil said sure, and volunteered 
his bean field as a site for the ex- 
periment. 

Mische, 40, lives outside Saint 
Cloud, in Stearns County, has a 
masters degree in sociology, and 
works for the Minnesota State Em- 
ployment Service. He had been 
active in the peace movement in the 
sixties and early seventies, and re- 
mains committed to social action. 
He became increasingly worried 
that resistance to the line was driv- 
ing people to violence they did not 
want. 

When, in February 1977, he read 
a newspaper article about Canadian 
and Russian experiments in wire- 
less transmission of electricity us- 
ing Tesla&apos;s ideas, he and his wife 
volunteered their time and savings 
to the project. He sees it as a first 
step to &quot;the kind of alternative that 
can meet the farmers&apos; concerns, yet 
provide abundant energy to help all 
people.&quot; He also enlisted the aid of 
several people of like spirit in the 
food cooperative movement in the 
Twin Cities. 

Will, Virgil, and Virgil&apos;s two old- 
est sons worked spring and summer 
to build the Tesla receiver in 
Virgil&apos;s bean field. Their aim is to 
receive power broadcast from other 
experimenters in Timmons, On- 
tario, who are building a Tesla 
transmitter. Officials in the energy 
industry and Minnesota govern- 
ment are surprised when they hear 
that Virgil has allowed 7,000 feet 
of cable to be buried in his bean 
field as a ground and has erected a 
60-foot tower as an antenna. They 
don&apos;t think it will work. &quot;It is only 
one of the many things we are do- 
ing,&quot; say the resisters. &quot;We won&apos;t 
ever give up, we are determined.&quot; 

Often I am asked to lecture to 
various audiences about what it is 
that the farmers really want; what 
is really behind it all. I usually show 
how the resistance takes the shape 
of a social movement, like the black 
power movement, the environ- 
mental movement, women&apos;s libera- 
tion. Using models we developed 
studying and analyzing these other 
movements, I explain that the 
power line resistance is organized 
much like these other movements.

I&apos;mluck^ 

Good things are happening 
in our village. Thanks to 
someone like you who cares. 



Luz Marina Osorto lives in the sun-parched village 
of Esquimay in Latin America. Once her future vi&apos;as 
darkened by poverty. Today it glimmers w/ith hope. 
Thanks to concerned people like you. And guidance 
from Save the Children. 
For generations, the mothers of Esquimay rose at 
4 A.M. to bake rosquillas, hard biscuits that are the 
staple of their meager diet— and can be sold to neigh- 
boring tow/ns. But the work was hard and took 
so long. Because the women had to grind the corn 
by hand, they could barely make enough rosquillas 

to feed their families. 

A Save the Children field worker helped the 

mothers set up a village baking center and get a 

motor-driven corn grinding mill. Now Esquimay 

produces over 5,000 rosquillas a day. At last, 

children like Luz have enough to eat. The mothers 

of Esquimay have more time to devote to their 

children. And there is some money left over for 

clothes, school books, and a planned health clinic 

and new school. 

But Esquimay&apos;s long climb out of poverty is 

only a beginning. And impoverished children in 

other villages are still waiting and hoping. 

Not for a handout. But a hand up! 

They are asking for your help now. 



520 a day is all it takes. 
Mere pennies can do it. 

The money you donate to sponsor 
a child like Luz is combined with that 
of other sponsors to provide equip- 
ment, training and funds to transform 
a whole community. Thanks to volun- 
teered labor and materials, your spon- 
sored child receives benefits worth 
many times your total gift. And you&apos;ll 
see the results. First, you&apos;ll get a photo 
and case history of the child you spon- 
sor. Have the chance to correspond. 
Get reports of progress being made in 
the community. Receive our annual 
report showing how donated dollars 
are used. 

Luz is lucky. But there are so many 
other children still hoping. Won&apos;t you 
show them you care? Fill out and mail 
the coupon today. Please.

It is segmentary, with many differ- 
ent groups; it is polycentric, with 
many leaders. It is integrated by 
networics, rather than by a formal, 
bureaucratic chain of command. 
The movement grows as its partici- 
pants go out and recruit others, 
face to face. Its participants be- 
come committed — radicalized — as 
they take risks by standing up to 
established orders, as they did on 
Constitution Hill. The resisters 
legitimatize their actions and drive 
forward under the thrust of power- 
ful ideas about the evils of the line 
and the rightness of their efforts. I 
show that movements like this are 
not simply explained away as the 
work of a few agitators. They be- 
come powerful enough to stop es- 
tablished orders and generate 
change. 

Sure, my audiences agree. You 
have just restated our problem. But 
what is the answer? How can we 
deal with this in a rational manner? 

To the energy industry, resist- 
ance often seems not only irra- 
tional but also selfish, even un- 
patriotic and irresponsible. If fight- 
ing to implement the administra- 
tion&apos;s energy plan and achieve inde- 
pendence from imported oil and 
natural gas is &quot;the moral equivalent 
of war,&quot; then developing the coal 
and lignite of the northern Great 
Plains is one of the holy battles. 
The energy industry can get the 
capital to build and use the ma- 
chines to mine the sprawling de- 
posits of fossil fuel, convert these 
to electricity in power plants near 
the mines, and send it by high- 
voltage transmission lines to tie into 
regional and national grids and sup- 
ply the needs of farms, towns, in- 
dustries, and cities. The ±400 kilo- 
volt, direct-current line will carry 
electricity into the national grid 
from a 1 ,000-megawatt plant in 
Underwood, North Dakota. The 
cooperatives see it as a worthy 
effort, but instead of being praised 
it is being blocked by what they re- 
gard as the selfish action of a hand- 
ful of misguided landowners. 

And government is troubled. 
Minnesota officials feel they have a 
power plant and line-siting process 
that protects individual rights and 
the environment while assuring 
timely and responsible energy de- 
velopment. Both energy developers 
and government officials explain 
that the resisters have had the bene- 
fit of this state process and of every 



32 



legal remedy. The resisters&apos; law- 
suits have been heard through all 
the state courts. After a month of 
deliberation the State Supreme 
Court denied their final appeal on 
September 30, 1977. 

The resisters have been heard by 
the state legislature, which has ac- 
cordingly modified legislation to 
protect farmland in future sitings. 
The governor and church officials 
have tried separately to negotiate 
settlements between resisters and 
co-ops through mediation. Resis- 
ters now get sizable payments for 
easements. Thus, officials and 
energy developers say, &quot;What 
more can the resisters expect? They 
can&apos;t just say that the &apos;bottom line 
is no line.&apos; They should now accept 
the conclusion that the line will be 
built over the land of some of 
them.&quot; But these officials and 
energy developers join many others 
in asking, &quot;Will it take force to 
settle it? Will it be necessary to 
bring out the National Guard, after 
all?&quot; 

In trying to answer such ques- 
tions, I remember how a sheriff in 
Steams County explained to the 
press why he and his few deputies 
could not disperse resisters and 
enforce surveying and construc- 
tion: &quot;To pull guns is to be willing 
to use them, and the line just isn&apos;t 
worth this.&quot; 

So I have to say, &quot;No, force is 
not the answer.&quot; Warning of energy 
shortage is not the answer. Telling 
resisters that they can&apos;t stand in the 
way of the energy industries&apos; means 
of winning the great crusade to 
meet America&apos;s energy needs is not 
the answer. Telling them that they 
had their day in court, participated 
in the decision-making process, and 
must accept the outcome is not the 
answer. At least, not now, not in 
this case, for these resisters. It may 
be for others, later. But for these 
resisters, it is they who are &quot;in the 
right.&quot; It is they who are &quot;fighting 
the moral equivalent of war.&quot; And 
some accept that it might become a 
real war. So, whose cause is the 
right one? 

Is it that of those who decide to 
develop coal and lignite as the 
country&apos;s great black hope or of 
those who say, &quot;Not over my 
place&quot;? What do you do when re- 
sistance becomes as much a cru- 
sade as development? Simply scat- 
ter the minority with a whiff of 
eminent domain? But what is the 



minority? The farmers say they are 
protecting the basic freedoms and 
the food-producing farmland that 
we all need. The energy developers 
say they are protecting legal proc- 
esses and the energy-providing sys- 
tems we all need. Government says 
it is making decisions reflecting 
study of all the social, economic, 
technical, political, health, and 
ecological factors. And it says it 
is facilitating public participation 
so it can consider all views. Maybe 
what officials expect is that this 
participative process will achieve 
consensus. But the participants in 
this process have emerged flying 
the banners of their rival holy 
causes even higher. 

Even if we could determine what 
is the common good and what is the 
majority view, we live in a society 
that increasingly, and almost mili- 
tantly, seeks to protect the rights 
of all minorities. If a minority does 
rebel instead of conform, the estab- 
lished order does not know what 
to do. 

So, I have no answer to the ques- 
tion. How can we deal with resist- 
ance? Answers are being sought by 
all involved in such disputes. The 
answers may be different from any- 
thing we can now envisage. 

And they won&apos;t just be technical 
and economic answers, but moral, 
ethical ones as well. The resisters 
have added feelings and sentiment 
to the mechanical process of trans- 
porting energy from fossil fuels. 
They are telling us that the energy 
we use costs much more than just 
money. We face the dilemma to- 
gether. The energy future of this 
country is at stake. 

In the summer of 1977. top Luth- 
eran church officials came with a 
local minister to visit church mem- 
bers who are fighting the power 
lines. &quot;They really listened to our 
concerns,&quot; Gurvin Femrite reports. 
&quot;I think they learned something. 
Just at the end, one churchman 
said, &apos;Of course, war doesn&apos;t solve 
anything.&apos; I answered him with a 
question. &apos;But if that were the case, 
wouldn&apos;t we still be under English 
rule?&apos; &quot; 

&quot;What did he say to that?&quot; 

&quot;Nothing.&quot; 

Luther P. Gerlach, an anthropolo- 
gist at the University of Minnesota, 
studies social movements, includ- 
ing the rise of resisters to energy 
schemes.

This View of Life 



Nature&apos;s Odd Couples 



Some unusual unions 
have big benefits . . . until 
one of the partners expires 



From Nature&apos;s chain what- 
ever hnk you strike. 
Tenth, or ten thousandth, 
breaks the chain aUke. 

A. Pope, 
An Essay on Man (1733) 

Pope&apos;s couplet expresses a com- 
mon, if exaggerated, concept of 
connections among organisms in an 
ecosystem. But ecosystems are not 
so precariously balanced that the 
extirpation of one species must act 
like the first domino in that colorful 
metaphor of the cold war. Indeed, 
it could not be, for extinction is the 
common fate of all species — and 
they cannot all take their ecosys- 
tems with them. Species often have 
as much dependence upon each 
other as Longfellow&apos;s &quot;Ships that 



pass in the night.&quot; New York City 
might even survive without its dogs 
(I&apos;m not so sure about the cock- 
roaches, but I&apos;d chance it). 

Shorter chains of dependence are 
more common. Odd couplings be- 
tween dissimilar organisms form a 
stock in trade for popularizers of 
natural history. An alga and a fun- 
gus make lichen; photosynthetic 
microorganisms live in the tissue of 
reef-building corals. Natural selec- 
tion is opportunistic; it fashions 
organisms for their current environ- 
ments and cannot anticipate the fu- 
ture. One species often evolves an 
unbreakable dependency upon an- 
other species; in an inconstant 
world, this fruitful tie may seal 
its fate. 

I wrote my doctoral dissertation 
on the fossil land snails of Ber- 
muda. Along the shores, I would 
often encounter large hermit crabs 
that had incongruously stuffed 
themselves into smaller neritid snail 
shells. Why, I wondered, didn&apos;t 



these crabs — their big claw pro- 
truding — trade their cramped quar- 
ters for more commodious lodg- 
ings? Then, one day, I saw a hermit 
crab with proper accommodations 
— a shell of the &quot;whelk&quot; Cittarium 
pica, a large snail and major food 
item throughout most of the West 
Indies. But the Cittarium shell was 
a fossil, washed out of an ancient 
sand dune to which it had been car- 
ried by a hermit crab 120,000 years 
ago. I watched carefully during the 
ensuing months. Most hermits had 
squeezed into nerites, but a few in- 
habited whelk shells and the shells 
were always fossils. 

I began to put the story together, 
only to find that I had been scooped 
in 1907 by Addison E. Verrill, mas- 
ter taxonomist, Yale professor, 
protege of Louis Agassiz, and dili- 
gent recorder of Bermuda&apos;s natural 
history. Verrill searched the rec- 
ords of Bermudan history for ref- 
erences to living whelks and found 
that they had been abundant during

Land Hermit Crab 



by Stephen Jay Gould 



the first years of human habitation. 
Capt. John Smith, for example, re- 
corded the fate of one crew member 
during the great famine of 1614- 
15: &quot;One amongst the rest hid him- 
self in the woods, and lived only on 
Wilkes and Land Crabs, fat and 
lusty, many months. &quot;(I hope that 
Raymond Sokolov will act as advo- 
cate for the land crabs one of these 
months. Properly seasoned, they 
are delicious. For the whelks, I 
will let others speak — although I 
don&apos;t doubt their nutritional value.) 
Another crew member stated that 
they made cement for the seams of 
their vessels by mixing lime from 
burned whelk shells with turtle oil. 
Verrill&apos;s last living Cittarium came 
from the kitchen middens of British 
soldiers stationed on Bermuda dur- 
ing the war of 1812. None, he re- 
ported, had been seen in recent 
times, &quot;nor could I learn that any

of the oldest inhabitants.&quot; No ob- 
servations during the past seventy 
years have revised Verrill&apos;s conclu- 
clusion that Cittarium is extinct 
in Bermuda. 

As I read Verrill&apos;s account, the 
plight of Cenobita diogenes 
(proper name of the large hermit 
crab) struck me with that anthro- 
pocentric twinge of pain often 
invested, perhaps improperly, in 
other creatures. For I realized that 
nature had condemned this crab to 
slow elimination on Bermuda. The 
neritid shells are too small; only 
juvenile and very young adult crabs 
fit inside them — and very badly at 
that. No other modern snail seems 
to suit the crab, and a successful 
adult life requires the discovery 
and possession (often through con- 
quest) of a most precious and dwin- 
dling commodity, a Cittarium shell. 
But Cittarium, to borrow the jar- 
gon of recent years, has become a 
&quot;nonrenewable resource&quot; on Ber- 
muda, and crabs are still recycling 
the shells of previous centuries. 
These shells are thick and strong, 
but they cannot resist the waves 
and rocks forever — and the supply 
constantly diminishes. A few 
&quot;new&quot; shells tumble down from

the fossil dunes each year — a pre- 
cious legacy from ancestral crabs 
that carried them up the hills ages 
ago — but these cannot meet the de- 
mand. Cenobita seems destined to 
fulfill the pessimistic vision of 
many futuristic films and scenarios: 
depleted survivors fighting to the 
death for a last morsel. The scien- 
tist who named this large hermit 
chose well. Diogenes the Cynic lit 
his lantern and searched the streets 
of Athens for an honest man; none 
could he find. C. diogenes will 
perish looking for a decent shell. 

This poignant story of Cenobita 
emerged from deep storage in my 
mind when I heard a strikingly 
similar tale last month. Crabs and 
snails forged an evolutionary inter- 
dependence in the first story. A 
more unlikely combination — seeds 
and dodos — provides the second, 
but this one has a happy ending. 

William Buckland, a leading 
catastrophist among nineteenth- 
century geologists, summarized the 
history of life on a large chart, 
folded several times to fit in the 
pages of his popular work Geology 
and Mineralogy Considered With 
Reference to Natural Theology. 
The chart depicts victims of mass 
extinctions grouped by the time of 
their extirpation. The great animals 
are crowded together: ichthyo- 
saurs, dinosaurs, ammonites, and 
pterosaurs in one cluster; mam- 
moths, woolly rhinos, and giant 
cave bears in another. At the far 
right, representing modern animals, 
the dodo stands alone, the first re- 
corded extinction of our era. The 
dodo, a giant flightless pigeon 
(twenty-five pounds or more in 
weight), lived in fair abundance on 
the island of Mauritius. Within 200 
years of its discovery in the fif- 
teenth century, it had been wiped 
out — by men who prized its tasty 
eggs and by the hogs that early 
sailors had transported to Mau- 
ritius. No living dodos have been 
seen since 1681. 

In the August 26, 1977, issue of 
Science. Stanley A. Temple, a 
wildlife ecologist at the University 
of Wisconsin, reported the follow- 
ing remarkable story. He, and 
others before him, had noted that 
a large tree, Caharia major, 
seemed to be near the verge of 
extinction on Mauritius. In 1973, 
he could find only thirteen &quot;old, 
overmature, and dying trees&quot; in 
the remnant native forests. Expe- 



rienced Mauritian foresters esti- 
mated the trees&apos; ages at more than 
300 years. These trees produce 
well-formed, apparently fertile 
seeds each year, but none germ- 
inate and no young plants are 
known. Attempts to induce germ- 
ination in the controlled and favor- 
able climate of a nursery have 
failed. Yet Calvaria was once com- 
mon on Mauritius; old forestry rec- 
ords indicate that it had been lum- 
bered extensively. 

Calvaria&apos;s large fruits, about two 
inches in diameter, consist of a seed 
enclosed in a hard pit nearly half an 
inch thick. This pit is surrounded by 
a layer of pulpy, succulent mate- 
rial covered by a thin outer skin. 
Temple concluded that Calvaria 
seeds fail to germinate because the 
thick pit &quot;mechanically resists the 
expansion of the embryo within.&quot;&quot; 
How, then, did it germinate in 
previous centuries? 

Temple put two facts together. 
Early explorers reported that the 
dodo fed on fruits and seeds of 
large forest trees; in fact, fossil 
Calvaria pits have been found 
among skeletal remains of the dodo. 
The dodo had a strong gizzard 
filled with large stones used to 
crush tough bits of food. Sec- 
ondly, the age of surviving Cal- 
varia trees matches the demise of 
the dodo. None has sprouted since 
the dodo disappeared almost 300 
years ago. 

Temple therefore argues that 
Calvaria evolved its unusually 
thick pit as an adaptation to resist 
destruction by crushing in a dodo&apos;s 
gizzard. But, in so doing, they be- 
came dependent upon dodos for 
their own reproduction. Tit for tat. 
A pit thick enough to survive in a 
dodo&quot;s gizzard is a pit too thick for 
an embryo to burst by its own re- 
sources. Thus, the gizzard that 
once threatened the seed had be- 
come its necessary accomplice. 
The thick pit must be abraded and 
scratched before it can germinate. 
Several small animals eat the 
fruit of Calvaria today, but they 
merely nibble away the succulent 
middle and leave the internal pit 
untouched. The dodo was big 
enough to swallow the fruit whole. 
After consuming the middle, dodos 
would have abraded the pit in their 
gizzards before regurgitating it or 
passing it in their feces. Temple 
cites many analogous cases of 
greatly increased germination rates 



r 



40 



for various seeds after passage 
through digestive tracts of several 
animals. 

Temple then tried to determine 
the crushing force of a dodo&apos;s giz- 
zard by making a plot of body 
weight versus force generated by 
the gizzard in several modern birds. 
Extrapolating the curve up to a 
dodo&apos;s size, he estimates that Cal- 
varia pits were thick enough to re- 
sist crushing; in fact, the thickest 
pits could not be crushed until they 
had been reduced nearly 30 percent 
by abrasion. Dodos might well have 
regurgitated the pits or passed them 
along before subjecting them to 
such an extended treatment. Tem- 
ple took turkeys — the closest mod- 
ern analogue to dodos — and fed 
them Calvaria pits, one at a time. 
Seven of seventeen pits were 
crushed by the turkey&apos;s gizzard, 
but the other ten were regurgitated 
or passed in feces after consider- 
able abrasion. Temple planted the 
ten seeds and three of them germi- 
nated. He writes: &quot;These may well 
have been the first Calvaria seeds 
to germinate in more than 300 
years.&quot; Calvaria can probably be 
saved from the brink of extinction 
by the propagation of artificially 
abraded seeds. For once, an astute 
observation, combined with imagi- 
native thought and experiment, 
leads to preservation rather than 
destruction. 

With this column, I begin the 
fifth year of &quot;This View of Life.&quot; 
I said to myself at the beginning 
that I would depart from a long 
tradition of popular writing in nat- 
ural history. I would not tell the 
fascinating tales of nature merely 
for their own sake. I would tie any 
particular story to a general prin- 
ciple of evolutionary theory: Irish 
elks to extinction; decoy &quot;fish&quot; on 
a clam&apos;s rear end to the problem of 
perfection; flies that eat their 
mother from inside to adaptation. 
But this column has no message 
beyond the evident homily that in 
our complex world things are con- 
nected to other things — and that 
local disruptions have wider conse- 
quences. I have only recounted 
these two, related stories because 
they touched me — one bitterly, the 
other with sweetness.

Tovil: Exorcism by White Magic 



by Michael M. Ames 

photographs by Yvonne Hannemann 



Instead of bell, book, 
and candle, Sri Lanka&apos;s 
Buddhists use dance, 
song, and theater to 
cure demon-caused illness 

Legend has it that when Buddha 
first visited Sri Lanka (formerly 
Ceylon), he struck a bargain with 
the demons. Their karma is to per- 
secute humans, causing illness and 
misfortune. But once appeased, 
the devils must desist. The duty of 
the benevolent gods, long ago con- 
verted by Buddha&apos;s teachings, is to 
use their superior power to insure 
that the demons keep their word. 

And so Buddhists of Sri Lanka 
believe that when someone falls ill 
and finds no relief in Western or 
ayurvedic (primarily herbal) medi- 
cal treatments, a demon (yaka) 
may be the cause. The patient or his 
family will then seek the advice of a 
priest (yakiidura) who specializes 
in the appeasement and exorcism of 
yakds and of less dangerous ghosts 
ipretas). If the priest diagnoses a 
spirit attack, he will prescribe a 
tovil ceremony — a long, elaborate 
ritual exorcism, involving as much 
as thirty hours of drumming, danc- 
ing, and chanting. 

On February 12, 1978, at the 
American Museum of Natural 
History, a troupe from Sri Lanka 
will perform tovil. the exorcism 
ceremony of ritual chanting, 
dancing, and drumming. Tickets 
for the performance, which starts 
at 3:00 p.m. in the auditorium, 
may be purchased by the general 
public for $5.50 each at the Museum 
or by calling (212) 581-1105. 

For a complete schedule of the 
troupe&apos;s February and March 
tour of nine other United States 
cities, contact the sponsor. The 
Performing Arts Program of the 
Asia Society, 133 East 58th Street, 
New York, N.Y. 10022. 



Tovil is part of a large collection 
of magical practices that aid trou- 
bled Sinhalese Buddhists when all 
else fails. Many regional varieties 
of these ceremonial arts exist, but 
there are only three basic types: 
exorcism of ghosts and demons, 
propitiation of planetary deities and 
astrological powers, and veneration 
of so-called Hindu gods, who, the 
faithful say, predate Buddha and 
have nothing to do with Buddhist 
teachings or practice. 

Officially, Buddhists seek salva- 
tion from life&apos;s suffering through 
the cycle of rebirths and ultimate 
redemption from this cycle through 
purity of thought and deed. But this 
goal is difficult to understand and 
even more diflRcult to attain, requir- 
ing perhaps many thousands of re- 
births. To cope with daily life, the 
faithful require more immediate sol- 
ace. Sinhalese Buddhism faces the 
dilemma of all redemptive religions: 
it offers salvation from this world 
while obliged to remain very much 
a part of it. Although not a formal 
part of Sinhalese Buddhism, the 
three ceremonial systems that con- 
sole through magic are its comple- 
ment. 

In Sri Lanka&apos;s southern low- 
lands, where I conducted most of 
my research, the three systems — 
and the offerings, ceremonies, and 
priestly mediators they require — 
are ranked according to the spirits 
they address. The law of karma dic- 
tates that all spirits have been re- 
born in their present forms because 
of previously earned merit or de- 
merit. A virtuous person may be 
reborn as a high deity, while a glut- 
ton may first become apreta of the 
deceased and then a ravenous de- 
mon. At the top of the spiritual 
scale are deities — almost always 
benevolent — of varying powers and 
talents, who aspire to become fu- 
ture Buddhas. Planetary and astro- 
logical gods rank somewhere in be- 



tween these deities and the consis- 
tently malevolent demons and 
ghosts at the bottom of the hier- 
archy. 

Tovil dance drama is therefore 
the lowest category of magic cere- 
mony. Only temporary shrines are 
constructed for its purposes, for 
demons are certainly not welcome 
permanently, and appeasement 
takes the form of impure offerings, 
such as a cock. The professional 
status of yakadurds contrasts with 
that of kapiirdlas, priests who pay 
homage to benevolent deities. Ka- 
purdlas may be permanently at- 
tached to temples, where they can 
enjoy a guaranteed income, regular 
hours, and the psychic reward of 
performing meritorious acts worthy 
of pious Buddhists. Chasing out 
demons by means of tovil is neces- 
sary work, but it lacks virtue. Ya- 
kadurds perform genuinely thera- 
peutic services and may come from 
any social caste, but because they 
deal with evil, they may be more 
feared than respected. 

Nevertheless, a yakddurd re- 
quires more knowledge than other 
priests. During his apprenticeship, 
he becomes a master of spells and 
charms, the principal means of con- 
trolling yakds and pretas. Once he 
becomes adept at charming, he re- 
cruits a troupe of assistant magi- 
cians, dancers, and drummers to 
work with him. He must memorize 
many charms, songs, and ballads, 
and master intricate and frenzied 
dance routines. In addition to this 



As a tovil ceremony begins, a 

dancer whirls to drumbeats and 

chants. Tovil songs and dances 

honor Buddha, appease demons, 

and appeal to benevolent gods 

who hold sway over evil spirits.

magical lore, the demon priests I 
knew were as conversant with Bud- 
dhist theology as most village 
monks. These yakddurds were also 
familiar with deity rituals and ayur- 
vedic medicines. While higher 
priests can ignore lower systems, 
yakddurds need some knowledge 
of all religious phenomena. 

Besides knowledge, a yakddurd 
needs strength to endure his ardu- 
ous life. If called, he must be will- 
ing to break his sleep night after 
night, for he treats people in pain 
who need and demand quick relief. 
For a whole night&apos;s work, he usu- 
ally earns only five to forty rupees, 
depending on the income of the pa- 
tient&apos;s family and the seriousness of 
the illness. The priest may not be 
solicited again for more than a 
month. 

Indeed, the frequency of tovil 
curing ceremonies has declined dur- 
ing the last century. Denounced as 
idolatrous superstition by Christian 
missionaries and Western rational- 
ists who dominated the develop- 
ment of modem education in Sri 
Lanka, tovil has faced increasingly 



44 





stiff competition from ayurvedic, 
homeopathic, and allopathic medi- 
cal systems; Buddhist reform 
movements; and the growing popu- 
larity of the Hindu god Katara- 
gama. Because of changes in the 
economy, demon priests are hard 
pressed to earn a decent living. One 
well-known yakadurd will be the 
last in his family; his son is a bus 
conductor and has no plans to pur- 
sue his father&apos;s profession. People 
who work for wages seem to have 
less time and money to devote to 
tovil entertainments, and many of 
the masks used by tovil dancers 
have disappeared into European 
and American collections. 

Nowadays the Sinhalese profess 
skepticism about their world of 



While the patient, far left, sits

in an elaborate basket. He will

ceremonial objects. 



countless demons and ghosts. 
Nevertheless, one Sinhalese said to 
me, &quot;I don&apos;t believe in all those 
demons, but I can&apos;t be sure that 
they don&apos;t believe in me.&quot; When 
people fall ill, they may seek other 
remedies first, but, in the spirit of 
Pascal&apos;s wager, they grant that the 
demons are worth a try. 

A tovil ceremony focuses on five 
important va^&apos;fli. making special al- 
lowances for other notable demons 
and for the hordes of lesser demons 
and ghosts who follow behind. 
Though symptoms overlap consid- 
erably, and priests vary in their 
diagnoses, each yakd is nominally 
associated with specific diseases. 
These are either hysteria, in asso- 
ciation with hallucinations and 
aberrant behavior, or physical dis- 
orders, including broken bones, 
linked with psychological distress. 
For example, Rlri Yakd, the blood 
demon, who assumes a variety of 
human and animal forms in order to 
dig up fresh graves and devour 
bodies or suck their blood, is 
thought to cause fevers, stomach 
pains, headaches, and hysteria, and 
is associated with diseases and in- 
juries that result in loss of blood. 
Mahasona Yakd, the &quot;great ceme- 
tery demon,&quot; lies in wait in grave- 
yards for people burying their dead. 
He also lurks at four-comer inter- 



sections, slaughterhouses, and 
lonely places. He too takes on sev- 
eral forms, has thirty thousand 
demonic assistants at his call, and 
causes cholera, smallpox, and dys- 
entery. The third arch demon, 
Huniyan Yaka is one of the most 
powerful and his tovil is one of the 
most elaborate. 

Kalu Kumdra, known as the 
&quot;black prince,&quot; and his female 
form, Mohini Yakkhini, are the in- 
cubus and succubus of Sinhalese 
mythology. The first causes men- 
strual disorders in women and 
young girls, troubles during preg- 
nancy, and erotic dreams. The suc- 
cubus visits young bachelors at 
night, causing nocturnal emissions. 
She drives young men to distraction 
or hysteria: her victims may run 
wildly into the jungle or shout and 
scream for no apparent reason. For 
such cases, priests have been 
known to prescribe marriage as 
well as exorcism. 

The fifth important yaka is Ma- 
hakola Sanniya Yaka, the demon 
of delirious and convulsive states, 
the particularly hideous and power- 
ful leader of the eighteen sanni, 
personifications of the terrible mal- 
adies they cause. During the Sanni- 
yakuma tovil ceremony, masked 
dancers impersonate Mahakola and 
his eighteen assistants. The kola 



mask is often elaborate, depicting 
miniatures of the sanni. The sanni 
masks, on the other hand, are 
crudely carved and brightly 
painted, meant to depict the illness 
each demon brings. One mask has 
sightless eyes, while another has a 
cobra, symbol of deafness, wrapped 
across one side. During a tovil, all 
eighteen, although cited in song, 
never actually appear; five to seven 
are usually shown, representing 
mainly psychological disorders. 
Sinhalese seem to feel that fear 
causes disease. If a patient&apos;s fears 
are calmed, so that he finds peace 
and happiness in following the 
Buddha&apos;s teachings, his health will 
be restored. By alleviating mental 
distress, tovil enables Buddhists to 
concentrate on meditation and 
growth in virtue. 



In one version of tovil, a dancer,

exorcised. At right, he dances with 

flaming torches. Far right, the

burial ground. To fool the 

patient&apos;s demon persecutors, a 

dummy representing him will 

be cremated before high noon.

\ 




When a yakddurd diagnoses de- 
mon persecution, the patient&apos;s 
family may opt for a tovil. Once 
this commitment is made, it must 
be honored. The patient&apos;s horo- 
scope is consulted for an auspicious 
date and fees established for the 
priest and his assistants. The 
wealthier the family, the more elab- 
orate the ceremony should be; 
therefore, the larger the troupe, the 
higher the price. The simplest pos- 
sible tovil would involve only one 
priest and could be conducted in 
privacy inside the patient&apos;s house. 
But most tovils are held in a court- 
yard of the family home and call for 
at least one drummer, several danc- 
ers, and perhaps a master of spells, 
usually the leader of the troupe, 
whose members have probably 
worked together for years. 

The tovil audience has its own 
role. The ceremony is always a 
family aflFair, an occasion for 
friends and relatives to gather and 
demonstrate emotional and finan- 
cial support for the patient. Since 
the tovil begins at dusk and con- 
tinues at least until dawn or noon of

the following day, family members 
and retainers must gather food for 
the expected well-wishers. The 
morning before the ceremony, the 
family, under the chief priest&apos;s di- 
rection, weaves and folds banana 
stems and young shoots of palm 
leaves into elaborate shrines and 
offering containers. 

In front of the house, space is 
cleared for the ceremony itself and 
for observers. The patient is laid 
out at one end on a cot or mat, 
opposite a large gatelike palm leaf 
structure through which the de- 
mons must come. Although the to- 
vil ritual will focus on just one 
major yaka, each important devil 
and some pretas must be appeased, 
and so small shrines and oflFering 
baskets are also set up. 

By late afternoon, the chief priest 
and his troupe arrive and put on 
their costumes. Each dancer wears 
several short white-and-red skirts, 
one over the other, a short tight 
jacket, a wide white or red sash, 
anklets adorned with bells, make- 
up, and sometimes a turban. While 
dancing, each may hold tufts of 
young coconut leaves and later in 
the evening take up burning torches 
soaked with oil. The dances begin 



slowly and solemnly, but grow pro- 
gressively more lively, sometimes 
led by the drums and sometimes 
counterpointing them. Dancing and 
commentaries interlace singing and 
chanting of powerful mantras. As 
costumes and torches flash, bells 
jingle, and drums beat rhythmi- 
cally, performers&apos; and spectators&apos; 
excitement steadily mounts. 

TovU&apos;s most dramatic episode, 
the maha samaydma, takes place 
just after midnight. One dancer, 
holding burning torches in his 
mouth and hands, dances with such 
frenzy that the audience is led to 
believe that he goes into trance. 
Most yakddurds actually avoid 
trance because they have no wish 
to be possessed by the demons they 
are attempting to exorcise. But pa- 
tients, at least those driven insane 
(pissu) by demonic possession, may 
genuinely fall into trance at this 
point. Some have been known to 
fake trance. Usually unmarried and 
sexually frustrated young men and 
women become pissu — to gain at- 
tention, to excuse past indiscre- 
tions, or to elicit parental permis- 
sion to marry. Villagers enjoy try- 
ing to detect a faker. They watch 
the patient&apos;s eyes — they should be 
glazed — and dancing to judge 
whether he exhibits a demon&apos;s 
expertise. 

A possessed patient — or rather, 
the demon in the patient&apos;s body — 
will be made to dance about the 
performance arena. Once the de- 
mon has enjoyed himself and the 
patient is completely exhausted, 
the priest bargains. Before consent- 
ing to depart, theyakd may demand 
offerings and a second dance. 

After the tense pitch of the maha 
samaydma, the tovil rushes to con- 
clusion with a bawdy comedy rou- 
tine. The crowd and the patient are 
vastly entertained; by tovil&apos;s end, 
bloodthirsty demons have been re- 
duced to laughable impotence. The 
procession of the eighteen sanni is 
particularly comic. These demons, 
responsible for various illnesses, 
are presented as ridiculous, retreat- 
ing buffoons. As they depart, so do 
the patient&apos;s symptoms. One sanni 
may act totally confused, mistaking

Before an ornate palm leaf

In tovil, entertainment is insep- 
arable from exorcism. Colorful 
songs and dances honor the gods 
and placate demons; they also en- 
tertain assembled guests and dis- 
tract the patient. By means of 
words, gestures, and masks, priests 
confront the sufferer with concrete 
images ofyakds and pretas who are 
vanquished before his eyes. While 
propitiating harmful spirits, a priest 
is also trying to change the sick 
person&apos;s mental disposition. 

Tovil is simultaneously a social 
event for relatives and friends, 
ritual drama, therapeutic catharsis 
for the patient, and theological dis- 
course. A major tovil&apos;s many parts 
are basically a simple formula, re- 
peated for each important yaka to 
emphasize the lowly place of de- 
mons in the spiritual hierarchy. 
Officiating priests first pay homage 
to the Buddha, whose teachings 
and moral power are supreme. Next 
the priests appeal to the mercy of 
the benevolent deities who hold 
sway over demons. Finally, the 
demons are appeased with offer- 
ings and obliged to stop harassing 
the patient. 

Hence the most monstrous 
ghosts and demons are shown as 
subject to the law of karma, the 
teachings of Buddha, and the power 
of the gods. As demons can be com- 
batted and subjugated, so can life&apos;s 
daily problems. Yakds and pretas 
symbolize the impurities — greed, 
anger, jealousy — humans must 
purge themselves of before they 
can win release from suffering. 7b- 
v/7 not only provides therapy for 
psychosomatic disorders, but also 
dramatically reaflRrms the world 
view of Buddhism at its popular, 
grass roots level. □

Ibex in Israel

Under strict protection, 
these biblical goats are 
shifting through their 
seasonal home ranges 
in increasing numbers 

The oasis of Ein-Gedi shimmers 
in the heat on the western flank of 
the Dead Sea. At 1,302 feet below 
sea level, this is the lowest area on 
the surface of the earth. In this part 
of Israel the crags and steep can- 
yons of the Great Rift Valley are 
home to the Nubian ibex, an ex- 
tremely agile wild goat that is well 
adapted to extreme temperatures 
and sparse vegetation. The Ein- 
Gedi Nature Reserve, which com- 
prises most of the springs and 
streams of the oasis, is a particular 
haven for these biblical animals. 

The Nubian ibex (Capra ibex nu- 
biana) is a subspecies that is dis- 
tributed in Israel from the northern 
shore of the Dead Sea along the 
rift valley as far south as Elat. Small 
herds exist in parts of the Negev 
highlands, and limited numbers can 
be found in the Sinai Peninsula. 
Nubian ibex also still survive in 
Syria, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi 
Arabia but their numbers are held 
down by herds of Bedouin sheep 
and goats, which present severe 
competition for ibex, especially in 
drought years. 

The distribution of ibex is limited 
primarily by the availability of wa- 
ter: ibex need to drink every few 
days. Their diet is heavy in halo- 
phytes (plants with a high salt con- 
tent), which may explain their de- 
pendence on drinking water. A 
wide variety of plants grow within 
the Ein-Gedi oasis and ibex feed on 
most of them. In addition to the 
desert-adapted halophytes, ibex 
also favor the savanna-type trees of 
the area, such as the toothbrush 
tree, the horseradish tree, and the 
Christ&apos;s-thorn tree. When there is 



sufficient rain in winter, water 
holes form in the surrounding can- 
yons and wadis and the ibex can 
range farther from the oasis. 

Ibex are normally browsers, but 
if sufficient grass cover exists, they 
prefer to graze. They begin to feed 
with the first light of day, and dur- 
ing the average thirteen hours of 
daylight, they spend about half the 
time eating, moving from one food 
source to another. During the hot- 
test hours, the ibex rest and rumi- 
nate. At sunset they climb to a safe 
sleeping place for the night. 

In drought years, however, ibex 
may continue to feed after dark or 
they may move up to their sleeping 
spot at sunset and come down to 
eat in the middle of the night. The 
presence of a tapetum in their eyes 
indicates an adaptation for night vi- 
sion. The tapetum insures that light 
coming into an eye has two chances 
of stimulating the visual cells, in- 
stead of only one as in the eyes of 
most diurnal mammals. 

With the exception of the Red 
Sea coast, the Dead Sea area has 
the highest summer and winter 
temperatures in Israel. Ibex are 
mainly diurnal and much of their 
feeding is done under very hot and 
arid conditions, but they are well 
suited to do so. Their shiny summer 
coat is an important factor in keep- 
ing body temperature down by re- 
flecting solar radiation. The base of 
each hair is black and so is the skin, 
preventing absorbtion of harmful 
ultraviolet rays. Movement during 
the hottest part of the day is mini- 
mal, and much of the heat load is 
dissipated through panting. 

Ibex are gregarious and are nor- 
mally found in socially structured 
groupings that allow for an orderly 
daily routine, with harmful fighting 
kept to a minimum. Larger males 
tend to band together and have few 
social interactions with females and 
younger males. This separation ap- 



pears to be caused by yearling fe- 
males remaining within their moth- 
ers&apos; home range, and by the ten- 
dency of young males to seek social 
relationships with other males of 
their size and age group. As they 
get older, males vacillate between 
female-young groups and inter- 
mediate male groups (three to five 
years old). At the age of six or 
seven, they finally join up with one 
of the large male groupings. 

A well-defined hierarchy exists 
within the male group social struc- 
ture. Those who dominate are large 
bodied and large horned. Among 
the females there is also a hierar- 
chical structure, but this is little 
understood. Since the maximum 
size of a female&apos;s horn rarely ex- 
ceeds that of a yearling male, fe- 
males are dominated by males two 
years old and up. 

Dominant males secure their 
positions in the hierarchy by se- 
rious fights in which the force of a 
blow can snap a horn. Usually, the 
loser is not physically banished, 
although in some cases he may 
temporarily leave the home range. 
Once established, the hierarchy is 
constantly reinforced by displays 
and nonserious fighting. Almost all 
of these interactions take place be- 
tween individuals that are more or 
less equal in size. Preparation for 
these dominance fights starts at an 
early age, with two-week-old kids 
practicing fighting behavior. The 
most characteristic behavior pat- 
tern of dominant males is a horn 
threat — lowering the head in a men- 



Bey ond reach of predators, a herd 

of Nubian ibex negotiate a trail 

on a sheer cliff of the Great Rift 

Valley in Israel. Their spongy 

hoofs help them grip the rocks.

acing position and preparing to 
butt. This is usually enough to 
induce subordinate behavior in 
smaller males and females. In gen- 
eral, males that reach the alpha po- 
sition within a herd maintain it for 
only two or three years. Younger 
males can therefore rise in the hier- 
archy and eventually have an op- 
portunity to mate. 

The dominant males do most of 
the courting and mating during the 
rutting season, but there is a defi- 
nite distinction between dominance 
and leadership. This is well illus- 
trated in mixed herds. The males in 
such herds dominate the females in 
matters of food and resting spots; 
but when the herd is in movement, 
one of the older females invariably 
takes the lead. 

There is a high mortality rate 
among males seven years and older, 
and there are almost no instances of 
males living more than twelve 
years. Old males tend to walk alone 
rather than in a herd or small group. 
They are quite heavy, more than 
175 pounds in some cases, and not 




as agile as younger males and fe- 
males. This makes them easy prey 
for leopards, which are increasing 
in the Dead Sea region. 

The desert race of leopard, for- 
meriy thought to be extinct in Is- 
rael, is an important factor in keep- 
ing the ibex population down. An 
examination of dozens of leopards&apos; 



scats showed that ibex make up the 
main part of their diet. The reaction 
of ibex to the presence of a leop- 
ard is interesting. Ibex exhibit a 
great deal of curiosity. Even when 
fleeing danger, they will stop and 
turn around to look at their pur- 
suer. On one occasion I observed a 
group of about twenty ibex that had

Just prior to the rut, several 
males within a herd &quot;present&quot; 
their horns to one another (top, 
preceding page). This behavior 
helps to establish rankings in 
the dominance hierarchy, although 
the alpha male position has 
already been decided. If two 
contestants have horns of similar 
size, neither may back off and 
they may exchange butts 
intense enough to snap a horn. A 
breeding male (bottom, preceding 
page) performs a lip curl caused by 
smelling the urine of an estrous 
female. Two juveniles (left) imitate 
the adult copulatory posture. A 
dominant male, below, approaches 
a female restingfrom his attentions.

discovered the presence of a leop- 
ard. They began to close in and to 
stare at him in a fashion similar to 
that of mobbing in birds. They all 
showed nervous reactions — raising 
their tails in the air, stamping their 
forelegs, and whistling nervously. 
They continued to close in until 
they were about forty-five feet from 



the leopard, which finally got up 
and moved away. 

On another occasion, my dog 
was the object of ibex curiosity. In 
the evening twilight, my dog and I 
were sitting near one of the springs 
in the oasis. A group of ibex sighted 
the dog and began to move in until 
they were within six feet of us. 



Being a well-disciplined animal, 
the dog sat quietly. However, the 
tension became so great for her that 
she finally broke for the ibex. In a 
matter of seconds they reached a 
nearby cliflFand were out of danger.

jury. This ability is the best defense 
of the ibex, although large males 
are able to inflict terrific blows 
with their three-foot-long horns. 

Ibex are not territorial animals in 
that they do not defend areas to pre- 
vent trespassing by other individ- 
uals. The area that ibex cover in 
their daily activities is their home 
range. According to the time of 
year and the climatic conditions, 
they can be found in one of their 
seasonal home ranges. They are 
loyal to these home ranges and will 
return to them year after year un- 
less some untoward circumstance 
prevents their doing so. Summer, 
winter, prerut, rutting, and lamb- 
ing home ranges are used in se- 



quence by the appropriate animals. 
Movements from one home 
range to another are probably 
learned from older individuals. In a 
drought year the movements are 
restricted to those areas where 
there is suitable forage. This applies 
in particular to the movements of 
pregnant and lactating females. For 



many females, the summer and 
winter home ranges coincide in a 
drought year. The largest males 
show the most distinct movements 
from one home range to another, 
even during drought years. 

Ibex show little variation in their 
ordinary behavior most of the year. 
But during the prerut and rutting

condition and will be an active 

breeder for about three years.

periods there are marked changes 
in the males, and from about July, 
males begin to show their rutting 
colors. They drift into a special pre- 
rut home range that is used every 
year. The oldest and most dom- 
inant males usually appear last. 
They become very sluggish and at 
times are still asleep on their sides 
at eleven in the morning. The slug- 
gishness may be a means of con- 
serving energy for the strenuous 
rutting to follow. During the hot 
part of the day, there is little inter- 
action between individuals, but 
toward nightfall fighting begins to 
break out. 

A characteristic prerut activity is 
the &quot;huddle.&quot; Several males come 
together in a circle, their heads 
toward the middle, and present 
their horns to one another. Indi- 
vidual fights may break out, but the 
dominant male usually does not 
participate. His dominance is al- 
ready accepted by the rest of the 
group. 

At about the time of the autumnal 
equinox, the male prerut herds 
break up and the members go off in 
search of receptive females. The 
posture that males take at this time 
is curious. They bend their heads 
back over their shoulders and 
curve their tails up over the back- 
bone, exposing a white rump patch 
to the fullest. The body is taut and 
held close to the ground. In this 
manner the male will walk after a 
female for hours. At times, the 
male will perform a kind of dance, 
short-stepping backward and for- 
ward in relation to the female. The 
dominant males don&apos;t let subordi- 
nates come close to any receptive 
females. 

Females show a quiet heat, not 
forcing themselves on the males in 
any manner. The behavior of a 
courting male is very cautious, 
which apparently keeps the female 
from running off into an area where 
there are other large males. The 
male is constant in his mating pur- 
suit and hardly eats. The female, 
however, continues to browse, pay- 
ing scant attention to her suitor. 
One means that the female has of 
diverting an ardent male&apos;s attention 
is to urinate. The urine, probably 
containing breakdown products 
of hormones, causes the male to 



lip curl (flehmen). While he is doing 
this, the female can move a little 
distance away and rest. 

Mating occurs in October, usu- 
ally at night when the females are 
fully receptive after a full day of 
courting. Prior to mounting, a male 
gives a series of whistles and be- 
comes quite aggressive toward the 
female. He then mounts her, with 
intromission lasting only about 
three seconds. There is no pair for- 
mation among ibex; once mating is 
accomplished, the male looks for 
other receptive females. 

The rutting season is short, about 
one month. Males remain in the 
vicinity of the females for one to 
three months afterward; the older, 
more dominant males are first to 
leave for their winter home range. 
Toward the middle of March the 
females begin to give birth. They 
leave their kids of the previous year 
and climb to more inaccessible 
cliflFs to give birth. There is very 
little forage in these areas, but they 
are difficult for predators to reach. 

Ibex kids are physically pre- 
cocious. They are born with their 
eyes open, and within minutes they 
attempt to rise up on their legs. 
Within twenty-four hours they can 
walk, but they don&apos;t run and jump 
well. At the end of forty-eight hours 
they are running and jumping and 
even doing aerial splits. When they 
are one week old they can negotiate 
almost any place on the cliffs that 
their mothers can. By two weeks 
they can jump more than three 
times their own height. Since the 
kids are so quick in their develop- 
ment, there is apparently no need 
for the mother to eat the afterbirth 
(as is common in many ungulates) 
to reduce the chances of her kid 
being discovered by predators. 

After several days of being alone, 
during which mutual imprinting 
takes place, mothers with new kids 
join together to form nursery bands. 
The initial bond prevents the kids 
from losing their mothers and going 
to some other female. When there 
is no direct line of sight between 
mother and kids, they seek one 
another by vocalizing. The sounds 
they emit are similar to the &quot;baa- 
ing&quot; of sheep. Once mother and kid 
see one another, the kid will stoop 
down and begin to suckle. While it 



is suckling, the mother will in many 
instances smell the kid&apos;s anal gland 
— apparently positive proof of iden- 
tification. The kids, which have 
been making nibbling movements 
with their lips and mouth since they 
were two days old, will lick, smell, 
and chew on plants, but not until 
the age of one week do they actu- 
ally begin eating and digesting small 
amounts of vegetation. The wean- 
ing process is gradual. Mothers 
never butt or charge at their kids to 
prevent them from suckling. This 
behavior on the part of the mother 
assures that the kid will not be 
forcibly ejected from the frame- 
work of the group. 

Kids and mothers maintain a 
close relationship until the mothers 
give birth again the following year. 
The parent continues to groom her 
offspring, and sleeps next to it up 
until the day that she goes to partu- 
rate. The yearlings then join up 
with the nursery bands. When the 
mother and her newborn kid return 
from their seclusion, other females 
and their kids, along with the ju- 
veniles, organize into large herds 
and move to their summer home 
ranges — continuing their annual 
behavioral cycle. 

Because, throughout history, 
ibex were much sought after by 
man, they came close to extinction 
in several areas. The Romans en- 
joyed ibex fighting as a spectator 
sport. During the Middle Ages, the 
animal had a magical reputation in 
Europe. The ibex became a walk- 
ing pharmacy: its blood was con- 
sidered a cure for callouses; hair 
balls, composed of hair, resin, peb- 
bles, and other indigestible items 
that formed in the animal&apos;s fourth 
stomach, were used to treat cancer; 
rings made of ibex horn were worn 
to prevent disease; and ibex feces 
were prescribed as a remedy for 
gout and tuberculosis. The Bed- 
ouins of the Judean desert once 
hunted ibex extensively for their 
fine-tasting meat, but strict protec- 
tive laws, prohibiting the hunting of 
ibex and creating a network of pre- 
serves, has changed the outlook for 
these superbly adapted arid-land 
creatures. They now thrive in most 
parts of their former range in Israel, 
and oases such as that at Ein-Gedi 
are interlaced with their trails. D

The Value of Virgin Birth 



by Charles J. Cole 



Some female lizards can 
reproduce without mating, 
enabling them to quickly 
establish new colonies that 
are devoid of males 

Biologists studying reptilian re- 
production had always assumed 
that, as in humans, it takes two to 
tango. This assumption was shat- 
tered about twenty years ago when 
a herpetologist, just returned from a 
field trip, sorted out samples of pre- 
served lizards and discovered that 
for some species there were only 
females. He could have shrugged 
this oflF with the thought that the 
males had simply been overlooked 
or missed while collecting. But he 
and a few colleagues dared to think 
that the samples reflected a real 
absence of males, and the study of 
this phenomenon began in earnest. 

More than two dozen species of 
reptiles that can reproduce without 
males are now recognized. These 
exceptional vertebrates are fre- 
quently referred to as &quot;all-female&quot; 
or &quot;unisexual&quot; species. The big 
differences between these reptiles 
and related bisexual species are 
that in all-female species each nor- 
mal adult is a virgin that produces 
offspring independently, and all off- 
spring are females. This means of 
reproduction is known as parthe- 




nogenesis — the development of un- 
fertilized eggs. Such procreation 
differs from that of the few all- 
female species of fish and salaman- 
ders, which only reproduce after 
breeding with males of closely re- 
lated species. 

Natural parthenogenesis has 
been known to biologists for a long 
time from the many species of in- 
vertebrates that consist only of 
females (for example, some weevils 
and crustaceans). In other inverte- 
brates, such as social wasps and 
bees, males are produced by de- 
velopment of unfertilized eggs (all 
fertilized eggs develop into fe- 
males). Although such observa- 
tions suggested several intriguing 
questions of basic importance to 
reproductive and developmental 
biology, vertebrate biologists his- 
torically had taken comfort from 
the thought that natural partheno- 
genesis was peculiar to a number of 
plants and to &quot;simpler,&quot; inverte- 
brate forms of animals, not some- 
thing to be concerned with too 
seriously among the vertebrates. 

The first published report 
strongly indicating that some spe- 
cies of reptiles reproduce partheno- 
genetically was published in 1958 
by Ilya Darevsky at the Zoological 
Institute, Academy of Sciences of 
the USSR. Darevsky could find 
only females in some populations of 



Armenian lizards and discovered 
that these could produce offspring 
in isolation from males of any spe- 
cies of lizard. Prior to Darevsky&apos;s 
report, Sherman A. Minton at the 
Indiana University Medical Center 
and Richard G. Zweifel at the 
American Museum of Natural His- 
tory were puzzling over the ab- 
sence of males in certain samples 
of whiptail lizards from the south- 
western United States. Darevsky&apos;s 
report put their observations into 
sharp focus, and since then, about 
a hundred papers concerning all- 
female species of reptiles have ap- 
peared in the literature. In addition, 
some species of lizards have been 
discovered that have bisexual popu- 
lations at some localities and uni- 
sexual populations at others. 

Much of the evidence for par- 
thenogenesis in reptiles had been 
circumstantial. The initial hypothe- 
sis stemmed from the apparent ab- 
sence of males in certain popula- 
tions. But how could one be sure 
this was not a matter of sampling 
error, even though some of the 
samples were extensive? Addi- 
tional collecting might reveal males. 
Or, if males of these species were 
truly nonexistent, how could the 
possibility that the females breed 
with males of other species be ruled 
out? The most direct evidence 
could be derived from studying 



56 




Parthenogenetic , hybrid New Mexico whiptail lizard

captive lizards maintained under 
controlled conditions, but year 
after year, attempts to raise these 
animals in several laboratories 
failed to establish perpetuating col- 
onies. In 1971, T. Paul Maslin at the 
University of Colorado reported 
obtaining a few parthenogenetically 
produced embryos and offspring 
from laboratory-raised whiptail liz- 
ards, but this triumph was marred 
by the premature death of most of 
the animals and no continuing 
colonies resulted. 

Early failures to raise all-female 
species of lizards in the laboratory 
did not necessitate rejecting the 
hypothesis that parthenogenetic 
reproduction occurred in nature. 
Before the hypothesis could be 
thoroughly tested, the vital require- 
ments of laboratory hatchlings had 
to be determined so they could 
reach adulthood in good health and 
with consistent reliability. 

This problem was solved re- 
cently at the American Museum of 
Natural History. The premature 
deaths of captive lizards, which had 
plagued earlier efforts, including 
ours, apparently resulted from a 
vitamin D deficiency and inade- 
quate metabolism of minerals. Pro- 
viding the lizards with essential 
radiant energy and nutrients has 
corrected the problem. Today, rais- 
ing parthenogenetic whiptail lizards 



is a relatively simple procedure. 

Successful colonies were started 
with a few adult, female Chihuahua 
whiptail lizards captured in New 
Mexico. These females were main- 
tained in total isolation from males 
of any reptile species. Eggs depos- 
ited in the laboratory by the field- 
captured lizards produced only 
female offspring. At the age of 
about one year, our laboratory- 
hatched virgin females began lay- 
ing viable eggs. These eggs also 
hatched and produced all-female 
offspring essentially identical to 
their mothers, even to having the 
same chromosome complements. 
Our colony is now into its fourth 
generation of all-female lizards 
hatched and raised in complete iso- 
lation from males. 

How can parthenogenetic lizards 
produce viable eggs, which have 
complete sets of chromosomes and 
balanced sets of genes, even though 
they are not fertilized? In bisexual 
species, each typical body cell con- 
tains two complete sets of gene- 
carrying chromosomes. One set is 
inherited from the mother and one 
from the father. When the cell pre- 
pares to divide into two daughter 
cells, each chromosome replicates 
itself and the daughter cells receive 
a copy of both sets of chromo- 
somes. This occurs during normal 
growth and development, such as 



when old or damaged skin tissue is 
replaced. However, cell division is 
different when eggs and spermato- 
zoa are produced in the gonads. 
Consequently, a normal egg or 
sperm receives only one copy of 
each chromosome. At fertilization, 
when egg and sperm unite, the 
presence of two complete sets of 
chromosomes and genes is re- 
stored. It appears that partheno- 
genetic lizards produce eggs in a 
fashion that provides each normal 
egg with a copy of all chromosomes 
present in a typical body cell, in- 
stead of only half. The eggs are 
genetically complete. 

Scientists are beginning to under- 
stand how all-female species of liz- 
ards came into being and why they 
survived. Parthenogenetic repro- 
duction evolved from bisexual 
species, and this occurred several 
times, independently, among dif- 
ferent kinds of lizards. It survives 
in various lizard populations for 
different reasons, depending upon 
ecological conditions. 

For example, Lepidophyma fla- 
vimaculatum is a tropical lizard 
that occurs at markedly low den- 
sities in forested areas of Mexico 
and Central America. But these 
lizards thrive along the edges of 
forests or where trees have been 
disturbed or locally destroyed. At 
most localities, populations consist 



57 



BISEXUAL 



Some species of tropical lizards 
have both bisexual and all-female, 
or parthenogenetic , populations. 
In forests, which cover much of 
their range, the lizards occur 
at low densities because such 
habitat is suboptimal. All 
populations of these lizards 
thrive, however, in forest-edge 
or disturbed habitats. Because 
these habitats are in rapid 
transition, a mechanism for 
rapid and efficient colonization 
would be advantageous 
and may explain the presence 
of parthenogenetic females. 




A representative population 
of such a lizard (above) is 
stylistically depicted at a low 
density in its suboptimal forest 
habitat. The black lizards are 
bisexual; the green individual 
is a female carrying the trait for 
parthenogenetic reproduction. No 
percentage or physical proximity 
is implied. A frequency for this 
trait has not been established 
other than that it is rare. Nor is 
it known whether this type 
of variation or mutation is 
recurrent or whether it is always 
present at some low level. 




A storm has knocked over a few 
trees in the forest. The resultant 
microhabitat differs from 
conditions within the forest proper 
and is optimal for these lizards. 
Bisexual lizards need a minimum of 
two individuals of opposite sex 
{or a gravid female) to reach the 
area, meet, mate, and produce 
offspring to establish a colony. 



The fallen trees provide cover. 
Insects and other prey associated 
with the decay of wood furnish a 
plentiful food supply. And since 
more sunlight reaches the ground, 
the lizards can thermoregulate 
more efficiently. Because of 
these optimal conditions, the 
bisexuals have built up a higher 
density than a forest population. 



UNISEXUAL 




.yp^. 



In the same situation, only one 
parthenogenetic female need find 
her way into the disturbed habitat 
in order to found a colony. ( The 
bisexual lizard represents those 
individuals that have not 
dispersed out of the forest.) An 
individual&apos;s ability to take 
advantage of the resources in 
this area is not related to mode 
of reproduction. 



The parthenogenetic colony has 
outproduced the bisexuals over 
the same amount of time. All 
offspring are identical copies, or 
clones, of the pioneer female and 
so can reproduce without mating. 
This results in a rate of 
reproduction that is at least twice 
as high as that of the bisexual 
colony, which is composed roughly 
of 50 percent males.

Plant succession is at a stage 
where ideal conditions have been 
largely eliminated; the area has 
reverted to the habitat from which 
the lizards emigrated. Succession 
has resulted in less cover, 
sunlight, and insects. Carrying 
capacity has diminished until the 
population is at the low density 
of the forest situation. 





As constantly happens in a forest, 
another blowdown of trees has 
occurred. A similar, longer-lasting 
situation would be present where 
man has cleared part of a forest, 
creating an edge habitat. Again, 
at least two bisexual lizards 
of opposite sex must wander into 
the location to take advantage 
of it and produce a colony. 




The situation may best be viewed as 
a fluid mosaic in which this species 
has high and low densities of both 
bisexual and unisexual populations. 
High-quality habitat appears 
unpredictably at sometimes widely 
scattered locations. Bisexual 
reproduction can be an effective 
means of colonizing such habitat, 
but it is not efficient. 




i 



The same factors work against the 
all-female colony, and the rate of 
population reduction is similarly 
governed by plant succession. The 
lesser genetic variability of these 
lizards may be disadvantageous at 
some point, although hybridization, 
producing triploid offspring, or 
random mutations could occur. 



Because all-female colonies, in 
various optimal microhabitats 
scattered throughout the forest 
and its edges, may have larger 
populations, more unisexual 
individuals could be available to 
disperse from a given point. 
Even a juvenile parthenogenetic 
female can successfully start 
a colony soon after she matures. 



Parthenogenetic reproduction 
seems to have evolved because it 
permits rapid colonization of good, 
but transitory, habitats in species 
whose range contains considerable 
marginal habitat. Over a long 
period of time, the parthenogenetic 
females of a species could become 
extinct or the species could 
end up completely female. 



59 



Parthenogenetic reproduction has 

also become established in lizards 

through hybridization, resulting in 

all-female species. This is a 

type of sympatric speciation. 



The western whiptail (white) is a 

desert-dwelling species and the 

little striped whiptail lizard 

(black) inhabits grassland in the 

American Southwest. Parts of their 

ranges come into proximity or 

overlap in a desert-grassland 

ecotone. Individuals from both 

species disperse into this buffer 

strip between the two primary 

populations, where they can 

exploit the available resources. 



Mating between the two species 
has taken place. As would be 
expected from such a pairing, the 
offspring, of either sex (cross- 
hatched), is sterile. In this situa- 
tion, however, a hybrid female 
carrying the trait for partheno- 
genetic reproduction (green) has 
appeared from a mating. Both 
types of hybrids are capable of 
exploiting the resources of the 
ecotone, but only parthenogenetic 
females can reproduce. 



The parthenogenetic lizard has 
reproduced and become self- 
perpetuating. The all-female 
colony of hybrids has its own 
distinct traits, which are a combi- 
nation of characteristics inherited 
from the western and little striped 
whiptails. This new species, the 
New Mexico whiptail (green), is 
a successful competitor within 
the &quot;hybrid habitat,&quot; and can 
disperse into other habitats.

of males and females in about a 
one-to-one ratio. In some places, 
however, only females have been 
found. Biologist Robert L. Bezy 
has speculated that the all-female 
lizards evolved from bisexual popu- 
lations because of specific ecologi- 
cal factors. Their apparently nar- 
row requirements for temperature, 
humidity, the cover of logs and 
stumps, and insect prey associated 
with rotting wood would account 
for the overall rarity of this species. 
Under certain optimal conditions, 
however, these lizards can form 
relatively large local colonies. 

Optimal conditions related to 
general topography and climate are 
relatively stable; those related to 
forest conditions and the occur- 
rence of suitable logs are ever 
changing due to ecological succes- 
sion. One fallen tropical tree can 
support a colony of Lepidophyma, 
and a number of dead trees can sup- 
port a veritable population explo- 
sion of these lizards. But to take 
advantage of such ecological 
&quot;windfalls&quot; as the food and cover 
provided by decaying logs, the liz- 
ards must reach the logs in time and 
reproduce quickly. This is a pre- 
carious existence. The populations 
thriving in a disturbed area are, in 
a sense, doomed because ecologi- 
cal succession will result in decom- 
position of the logs and the growth 
of new trees. The lizards, which are 
really nominal forest dwellers, will 
become less successful as succes- 
sion proceeds. 

What seems to be at work is that 
in this species natural selection 
favors the evolution of efficient 
mechanisms for dispersing and 
colonizing localities that have been 
recently disturbed. Parthenogene- 
sis is one such mechanism, and 
probably evolved through one or 
more females who carried a muta- 
tion or gene combination that al- 
lowed reproduction without males. 
Such females would be highly suc- 
cessful in establishing new colonies 
because a new population could be 
produced from the chance dispersal 
of only one parthenogenetic lizard 
into a previously unoccupied local- 
ity. Colonization of new areas is 
less efficient in bisexual species be- 
cause a minimum of two compat- 
ible individuals of opposite sexes or 



a gravid female carrying offspring 
of both sexes would be required to 
establish another population. 

The New Mexico whiptail lizard 
has all-female populations at all 
localities where it has been found. 
Biologists Charles H. Lowe and 
John W. Wright suggested that it 
originated as a hybrid between two 
bisexual species, the western whip- 
tail, which lives primarily in des- 
erts, and the little striped whiptail, 
which is a grassland species. Hy- 
bridization between the desert and 
grassland lizards probably occurred 
in the desert-grassland ecotone 
(transition zone), one of the habi- 
tats now occupied by the New 
Mexico species. The New Mexico 
whiptail displays many character- 
istics that are intermediate between 
the western and little striped whip- 
tails. The thought follows that the 
hybrid offspring were ecologically 
successful in the &quot;hybrid habitat&quot; 
(the ecotone) as a consequence of 
having a set of genes from each of 
two different parental species well 
adapted to the habitats spanned by 
the ecotone. 

As is often the case with hybrids, 
however, both the male and female 
offspring were probably sterile be- 
cause of their inability to produce 
sex cells with balanced sets of 
genes. Of course, an organism is 
headed for extinction if it cannot 
reproduce, even if it is highly fit as 
an ecological competitor in a spe- 
cific habitat. If, however, one or a 
few hybrid females were partheno- 
genetic, they would have been able 
to reproduce. After the original 
male and female sterile hybrids 
died, only the parthenogenetic 
females continued to perpetuate 
their kind. Once the species was 
established, its populations could 
move to accommodate shifts in the 
distribution of its habitat and, as in 
Lepidophyma, individual females 
could disperse and establish new 
colonies elsewhere. 

Examples such as these have led 
scientists to suspect that partheno- 
genesis became established among 
reptiles in at least two different 
ways. For species in which hybridi- 
zation was involved, the selective 
advantages are in allowing the off- 
spring to produce eggs having com- 
plete sets of genes and in maintain-

In 1902, Huerfano Butte, Arizona, 
was surrounded by grassland (top). 
This habitat supported the triploid 
unisexual Sonora whiptail lizard. 
By 1969, the habitat had changed to 
desert-grassland (bottom), and the 
diploid bise.xual western whiptail 
was the predominant species. Some 
interbreeding has occurred, 
producing tetraploid hybrids. 



ing the gene combinations that are 
well suited for continued existence 
in specific habitats. In nonhybrid 
situations, the advantage of par- 
thenogenesis is that it allows effi- 
cient colonization of new localities 
but not necessarily different habi- 
tats. Establishment of partheno- 
genetic reproduction appears to be 
in progress today in some species 
in which only females occur at 
some localities and both sexes are 
found at others. 

When a nonhybrid mode of evo- 
lution was involved, the surviving 
parthenogenetic populations usu- 
ally are considered to be of the 
same species as the bisexual popu- 



61 



lations from which they evolved, 
since the only basic differences are 
in the mode of reproduction. Pop- 
ulations in which parthenogenesis 
evolved through hybridization are 
considered to be new species be- 
cause usually the lizards are clearly 
different from both parental species 
in anatomy, habitats, and biochem- 
ical characteristics, and in addition, 
they regularly perpetuate their own 
distinct kind. 

The mode of egg production in 
parthenogenetic reptiles appears to 
be one in which all offspring from 
one female are essentially carbon 
copies. Except for random gene 
mutations, each lineage is, in es- 
sence, a clone. Thus, once a lizard 
becomes parthenogenetic and has 
a combination of genes that allows 
it to be a successful competitor in 
certain ecological situations, the 
genetic inheritance is well pre- 
served, generation after generation, 
with less genetic variation than 
occurs in bisexual species. This 
may mean that, in the long run, 
parthenogenetic species are at an 
evolutionary disadvantage because 
of reduced variability and evolu- 
tionary plasticity for responding to 
changing environments. 

There are ways in which gene 
combinations might suddenly 
change in parthenogenetic lizards. 
For example, a female of a diploid 
parthenogenetic species could mate 
with a male of a closely related 
species. Since the parthenogenetic 
female produces eggs that contain 
two full sets of chromosomes and 
genes and the male&apos;s spermatozoa 
carry another set, the hybrid off- 
spring, if viable, would be triploids 
— that is, they would contain three 
complete sets of chromosomes and 
genes in each typical body cell. In 
fact, several all-female species of 
lizards consist only of triploid indi- 
viduals, which produce triploid off- 
spring similar to themselves. These 
species probably evolved through 
hybridization between unisexual 
and bisexual lizards. 

Going a step further, there is the 
possibility of a triploid partheno- 
genetic female mating with a male 
of another species. In this case, the 
hybrid offspring would be tetra- 
ploids — with three sets of chromo- 
somes and genes inherited from the 



mother and one set from the father. 
Two hybrids of this sort have been 
found in southern Arizona, at 
Huerfano Butte, south of Tucson. 
The female parent was probably a 
Sonora whiptail lizard, and the 
male parent a western whiptail. 
Photographs of the locality taken 
about the turn of the century docu- 
ment that it used to be grassland. 
By 1969, when the tetraploid hy- 
brids were discovered, the habitat 
had changed dramatically to desert- 
grassland; desertification having 
occurred coincidentally with a drop 
in the water table, and other 
changes, in southern Arizona. Biol- 
ogists think that the triploid all- 
female Sonora whiptail abounded 
in the area when the habitat was a 
more suitable, cooler, moister 
grassland, and that the diploid, bi- 
sexual western whiptail recently 
invaded the area as its habitat, the 
desert, expanded. Today, the des- 
ert species is plentiful throughout 
the area and the parthenogenetic 
species clings to a local remnant of 
grassland where the tetraploid hy- 
brids occasionally arise. Given the 
appropriate combination of events, 
perhaps such hybrids could evolve 
into a tetraploid species. 

As mentioned earlier, lizard eggs 
that develop without hybridization 
or fertilization normally produce 
essentially identical female off- 
spring. However, hybrids that de- 
velop from fertilized eggs of 
parthenogenetic females exhibit 
males. The sex of a hybrid depends 
on whether the sperm from the 
male was carrying the X or Y chro- 
mosome. So when a parthenoge- 
netic female mates with a male of a 
different species, she can produce a 
variety of offspring in one clutch of 
eggs: some can be females identical 
to the mother (from eggs that were 
not fertilized); others can be poly- 
ploid hybrids bearing differences 
in various traits; and the hybrids 
can be either female or male. 

When the first substantial reports 
indicated that some lizards repro- 
duce without males, little was it 
known that parthenogenetic repro- 
duction is only one of several ways 
in which these reptiles are noncon- 
formists in vertebrate biology. The 
discovery of normal triploidy 
among reptiles was also a surprise 



to many biologists. So, too, was the 
discovery that the evolution of 
some species involved hybridiza- 
tion between two previously exist- 
ing species, which is sympatric 
speciation — not involving geo- 
graphic isolation of a population of 
a previously existing species. Such 
hybridization occurred in part be- 
cause ecological disruptions cre- 
ated newly disturbed habitats in 
which two geographically adjacent 
species could come into contact 
and interbreed. The disturbed habi- 
tats were most suitable to the resul- 
tant hybrids, which survived as all- 
female species once they devel- 
oped parthenogenetic reproduc- 
tion. This negated the typical prob- 
lem of sterility and provided rapid 
fixation of a hybrid combination of 
genes that was suitable to the dis- 
turbed habitat. 

Disturbed or fluctuating habitats 
also played a critical role for lizards 
in which parthenogenesis evolved 
without hybridization. In these 
cases, the original bisexual species 
was adapted to forest edge situa- 
tions (ecotones) or areas containing 
logs and pioneer vegetation. As 
plant succession proceeded, the 
local habitat changed and became 
less suitable to the lizards. In such 
species, parthenogenetic reproduc- 
tion improved the efficiency of col- 
ony formation after new disturb- 
ances created suitable habitat. 

In both cases, the evolution of 
parthenogenetic reproduction al- 
lows rapid colonization of disturbed 
habitats, a critical ability for ter- 
restrial animals whose optimal 
habitat is transitory and/or whose 
range contains considerable mar- 
ginal habitat. D

Of Cricket Song and Sex 

Male field crickets attract females with their song, 
but they also draw aggressive competitors, 
hungry predators, and dangerous parasites ^ 

by William Cade &quot;

In most parts of the world, 
the rhythmic songs of crickets 
fill the air on warm nights. 
These peaceful-sounding love 
songs of male crickets not 
only attract females; they are 
also battle cries. Competing 
males fight violently for fe- 
males, other males silently 
&quot;steal&quot; females attracted by 
a neighboring male&apos;s song, 
and some predators and para- 
sites locate males by their 
conspicuous calling songs. 
Song is the most obvious 



aspect of a cricket&apos;s compli- 
cated sexual behavior. 

Male crickets produce song 
by rapidly rubbing their wings 
together. The hardened wings 
have special surfaces for pro- 
ducing sound. Of the more 
than 2,000 cricket species that 
have been described, each 
has a very specific calling 
song, once thought to have 
evolved principally to prevent 
matings between members of 
different species. However, 
males of the same species 



also compete by means of 
song for sexually receptive 
females. 

For a male animal, the pur- 
pose of any type of reproduc- 
tive competition is that he 
should mate as many times as 
possible. Reproductive suc- 
cess, or more precisely the 
propagation of an individual 
animal&apos;s genes, is usually con- 
sidered to be behind competi- 
tive behavior. Until recently, 
animal behavior was often 
analyzed as an adaptation

Because this tree cricket 
nymph is too young to have 
wings, it cannot produce 
song. It is lighter and softer 
bodied than field crickets, 
which live in burrows.

Almost identical to Gryllus 
integer, these field crickets 
are lighter in color and inhabit 
domestic dwellings rather than 
fields and lawns. At left,

own calling song to attract

benefiting survival of the species. 
Behavior also perpetuates an indi- 
vidual&apos;s genetic line and can simul- 
taneously benefit and hinder an in- 
dividual&apos;s ability to reproduce. This 
important concept helps explain re- 
productive competition in crickets. 

In sexual behavior, male field 
crickets are very aggressive toward 
other males, biting with powerful 
mandibles and intermittently pro- 
ducing loud bursts of song. Some 
males routinely defeat others in 
fights, ascending to the top of their 
own hierarchy. Dominant males 
call for females from specific sites. 
They defend these territories 
against other males, searching out 
and attacking those who are trying 
to mate. By aggressively securing a 
calling site and interfering with 
other males, a dominant male 
cricket has access to more females 
and therefore leaves more offspring. 

Because fighting may result in in- 
juries severe enough to prevent fu- 
ture mating, an individual cricket&apos;s 
behavior can be expected to reflect 
a combination of costs and benefits. 
If two unevenly matched males are 
contending for a nearby female, the 
weaker male may benefit most from 
avoiding a fight, remaining unin- 
jured and, therefore, capable of 
more matings in the future. 

When I decided to study patterns 
of male cricket competition for fe- 
males, I chose the field cricket 
Gryllus integer, a species that com- 
monly occurs in grassy fields and 




residential lawns in central Texas 
and throughout the Southwest. 
During my early observations, 
which took place at night in both 
the field and in a specially con- 
structed outdoor arena, I noticed 
that while some males called regu- 
larly, other, silent males walked or 
remained stationary, often very 
close to a calling male. In a sense, 
silent males behaved like satellites 
of the calling male. Katydids and 
grasshoppers, close relatives of 
crickets, also demonstrate this sys- 
tem of callers and satellites. In 
these species, calling and satellite 
behavior are alternative ways in 
which males acquire mates. Some 
males call and attract females; 
meanwhile, others silently intercept 
females attracted by the calling. 
Alternative patterns of mating in 
the same species are probably wide- 
spread. They have certainly been 
observed in cockroaches, mud 
wasps, bees, lightning bugs, fishes, 
frogs, lizards, and birds. But this 
behavior presents something of a 
problem for evolutionary biologists. 
If, in an animal population, one be- 
havior attracts mates more success- 
fully than alternatives, the most 
successful behavior should eventu- 
ally become the population&apos;s pre- 
dominant form of mating. Under 



what circumstances, then, do al- 
ternative mating behaviors occur in 
the same population of males? 

Seeking an answer, I attempted to 
identify some of the costs and bene- 
fits associated with the behavior 
of calling field crickets and that of 
their satellites. For a male cricket, 
the obvious benefit of calling is that 
it attracts females for mating, and I 
have observed Gryllus integer 
females walking, sometimes run- 
ning, directly to a calling male and 
mating with him. But a possible cost 
of calling is that the male also at- 
tracts predators. Using tape- 
recorded cricket song, I tested the 
ability of various animals to locate 
crickets by sound. For the most 
part, tests with birds, frogs, toads, 
and some invertebrates were un- 
successful. But one night in August 
1974, when I was beginning to doubt 
that predators were able to locate 
calling cricket males, I noticed a 
red-eyed yellow fly (Euphasiop- 
teryx ochracea) standing motion- 
less on a loudspeaker that was 
broadcasting cricket song. 

Since that night, I have used 
taped cricket song to attract many 
of these flies, which are parasites 
of crickets and katydids, but I have 
found that only the females are at- 
tracted. All the females contained

many living young, or larvae, in 
their reproductive tubules. Re- 
sponding to a calling song, female 
flies deposit their larvae on a male 
cricket. The larvae burrow inside 
the cricket, feed and grow for about 
a week, then emerge and pupate. 

Fly parasitism always kills the 
host cricket, which dies as the lar- 
vae emerge. Flies also deposit 
larvae in a male cricket&apos;s territory. 
Larvae stand erect and readily stick 
to crickets walking nearby. Because 
field crickets are often hidden by 
dense vegetation or burrows in the 
ground, larvae deposited near the 



70 



source of cricket song may parasi- 
tize hidden calling males and per- 
haps satellites. However, in the 
field, female crickets did not draw 
flies, calling males were usually 
parasitized, and noncalling males 
rarely contained fly larvae. Euphas- 
iopteryx ochracea specializes in 
calling male crickets. 

Fly parasitism is a major danger 
to calling male crickets, but males&apos; 
reactions to each other also influ- 
ence sexual behavior. When calling, 
Gryllus integer males space them- 
selves at regular intervals in a field. 
Although I have observed fights be- 



tween calling males, their spacing 
may also be due to threats of ag- 
gression communicated by calling 
song. I tested this possibility by 
broadcasting a previously recorded 
calling song to a calling male. When 
I gradually moved the loudspeaker 
closer, up to an average distance of 
two feet, some males stopped call- 
ing, immediately ran to the loud- 
speaker, and viciously attacked an- 
other male I had tethered nearby. 
In the field, calling neighbors are 
always at least three feet apart, and 
I found that at this distance, ex- 
perimentally produced aggressive

lag- 1 
(by 






behavior was unlikely. Calling 
neighbors probably separate to 
avoid the costs of fighting. Con- 
versely, if a male prevents other 
•males from calling nearby, he bene- 
fits by gaining a monopoly on fe- 
males, or at least the ability to at- 
tract females, in the immediate 
vicinity. 

Many calling males did not be- 
have aggressively when I played 
taped song in their direction. These 
males stopped calling and remained 
stationary or walked in the area as 
if they were satellites of the loud- 
speaker. Males began to behave 



like satellites at an average distance 
from the loudspeaker of five feet, 
much greater than the distance at 
which caller males became aggres- 
sive. Apparently, the threat of ag- 
gression from a competing male (or 
what sounds like a competing male) 
causes some males that were previ- 
ously callers to behave like satel- 
lites. In completely natural cir- 
cumstances, a satellite male may 
benefit by avoiding both parasitic 
flies and aggression from calling 
males. Satellites walk very close to 
calling males without risking at- 
tacks and aire therefore in a better

position to intercept approaching 
females. 

In another type of sexual aggres- 
sion, some silent Gryllus integer 
males run up to calling males and 
attack them. Both combatants 
bite, push, and make short, loud 
bursts of song. The behavior of 
these silent aggressive males, very 
different from that of sateUites, may 
be a way of securing a calling site 
by displacing a previous resident. 
Possession of a signaling site 
greatly enhances a male cricket&apos;s 
ability to fight. Alternatively, a si- 
lent male&apos;s aggression may prevent 
other males from calling, leaving 
more females for the attacker. At 
any rate, attacks by previously si- 
lent males represent another cost 
to a male that calls for females. 

If a male starts calling to attract 
females, he runs the risk of attract- 
ing aggressive silent males, para- 
sitic flies, and even the cat next 
door (cats have been shown to be 
attracted to cricket and katydid 
song). Given these sizable dangers, 
why do males call? Probably be- 
cause calling generally results in 
more matings per night. Satellites 
often tried to mate by following fe- 
males and producing courting song 
— a soft sound, almost inaudible to 
human ears, that stimulates nearby 
females prior to mating. However, 
very few matings resulted from sat- 
ellite males&apos; courtship. Male sexual 
behavior evidently involves certain 
compromises: satellites avoid flies, 
but at the expense of success with 
females; calling males mate often, 
but risk parasitic flies and aggres- 
sive males. 

One obvious variation in calling 
told me more about the relative 
mating success resulting from dif- 
ferent male behaviors. Male call- 
ings range from louder than ninety 
decibels to lower than forty. In the 
field, when I simultaneously played

taped calling song at different vol- 
umes, females, aggressive male 
crickets, and parasitic flies were at- 
tracted much more often to the 
louder song. Loud callers probably 
draw many females, but they also 
attract many aggressive males and 
flies. Softly calling males attract 
fewer females, but fewer flies and 
male attackers are drawn to them. 

Cricket males, like the males of 
most animal species, compete for 
choosy females. Male and female 
sexual behaviors theoretically dif- 
fer because of the relative amounts 
of metabolic energy invested in the 
sex cells. Because females invest 
heavily in eggs, or potential off- 
spring, they need to choose the best 
fertilizing mate. Males, by virtue of 
their small investment in sperm, are 
less discriminating. 

Female crickets apparently pre- 
fer to mate with calling males, per- 
haps because calling identifies a 
male as being of the same species, 
a very important mate criterion. 
Calling might also signal that a male 
has a suitable genotype. Female 
preference for calling males parti- 
ally accounts for more calling be- 
havior at particular times of night. 
Slowly bicycling through a thirty- 
block residential area at all hours 
of the night, I listened for, and 
counted, calling crickets. Two 
hours before sunrise I noticed a 
shift: some previously silent males 
now began to call. Although many 
males remained silent, by sunrise 
the number of callers had increased 
threefold, then rapidly declined. 

To find out whether increased 
calling corresponds to an increase 
in female attraction, I played taped 
songs and counted the females col- 
lected in a trap mounted on the 
loudspeaker. I was surprised to find 
that female attraction actually de- 
creases during the hours that calling 
behavior increases, so that no fe- 
males are attracted at sunrise. Most 
males might be expected to call at 
times when females are readily at- 
tracted to their songs and not when 
females are least likely to come. 
Parasitic flies are attracted to taped 
song well into the daylight hours, 
so an absence of fly attacks is not a 
reason why some previously silent 
males begin to call. At dawn, how- 
ever, males tend to call at relatively 



low volume, and therefore probably 
attract few flies. Still, why should a 
male call, even at low volume, if 
females are not attracted? 

Early in the night, male and fe- 
male crickets openly walk and feed 
in a given area. But at sunrise, fe- 
males and both calling and noncall- 
ing males gather in small groups 
under dense vegetation to avoid 
waking birds that, while not at- 
tracted to cricket song, would cer- 
tainly prey on wandering crickets. 
Female crickets in these small hid- 
den groups are still sexually re- 
ceptive and matings do occur. At 
sunrise, aggressive males are not 
attracted to calling males, and the 
cost of singing is temporarily re- 
duced. Having been unsuccessful 
at mating the previous night, some 
previously silent males begin to call 
at low volume as a last attempt to 
mate with nearby females. 

In a field cricket population, al- 
ternative male mating behaviors are 
maintained by balancing mating 
success and longevity. On a given 
night, a calling male cricket will 
mate successfully. But the insect&apos;s 
life could be shortened by the flies 
and aggressive males it attracts. 
During any one night, satellite be- 
havior could attract few mates, but 
by extending a male&apos;s life expect- 
ancy, it would guarantee future 
mating opportunities. In drawing 
conclusions about sexual behavior, 
many variables have to be consid- 
ered: some males shift from calling 
to satellite behavior or adopt inter- 
mediate patterns, and the costs and 
benefits of mating behavior may 
change greatly during the course of 
of a night. However, over a male 
cricket&apos;s lifetime, calling and satel- 
lite behavior may result in roughly 
equal numbers of matings. If they 
do, both behaviors are equally 
successful and will be maintained 
in the population. D 



Common throughout the 

northeastern United States, the 

male snowy tree cricket sings in 

a high-pitched trill. Like all 

crickets, it produces song by 

rapidly rubbing its wings together.

Rituals at McDonald&apos;s 



by Conrad P. Kottak 



The success of this fast-food 
chain may be based, not so 
much on the taste of a Big 
Mac, as on the security 
offered in ordering one 

The world is blessed each day, 
on the average, with the opening 
of a new McDonald&apos;s restaurant. 
They now number more than 4,000 
and dot not only the United States 
but also such countries as Mexico, 
Japan, Australia, England, France, 
Germany, and Sweden. The expan- 
sion of this international web of 
franchises and company-owned 
outlets has been fast and efficient; 
a little more than twenty years 
ago McDonald&apos;s was limited to a 
single restaurant in San Bernardino, 
California. Now, the number of 
McDonald&apos;s outlets has far out- 
stripped the total number of fast- 
food chains operative in the United 
States thirty years ago. 

McDonald&apos;s sales reached $1.3 
billion in 1972, propelling it past 
Kentucky Fried Chicken as the 
world&apos;s largest fast-food chain. It 
has kept this position ever since. 
Annual sales now exceed $3 billion. 
McDonald&apos;s is the nation&apos;s leading 
buyer of processed potatoes and 
fish. Three hundred thousand 
cattle die each year as McDonald&apos;s 
customers down another three 
billion burgers. A 1974 advertising 
budget of $60 million easily made 
the chain one of the country&apos;s top 
advertisers. Ronald McDonald, our 
best-known purveyor of ham- 
burgers, French fries, and milk- 
shakes, rivals Santa Claus and 
Mickey Mouse as our children&apos;s 
most familiar fantasy character. 

How does an anthropologist, ac- 
customed to explaining the life 
styles of diverse cultures, inter- 
pret these peculiar developments 
and attractions that influence the 
daily life of so many Americans? 



Have factors other than low cost, 
taste, fast service, and cleanliness 
— all of which are approximated 
by other chains — contributed to 
McDonald&apos;s success? Could it be 
that in consuming McDonald&apos;s 
products and propaganda, Ameri- 
cans are not just eating and watch- 
ing television but are experiencing 
something comparable in some re- 
spects to a religious ritual? A brief 
consideration of the nature of ritual 
may answer the latter question. 

Several key features distin- 
guish ritual from other behavior, 
according to anthropologist Roy 
Rappaport. Foremost, are formal 
ritual events — stylized, repetitive, 
and stereotyped. They occur in 
special places, at regular times, 
and include liturgical orders — set 
sequences of words and actions 
laid down by someone other than 
the current performer. 

Rituals also convey information 
about participants and their cul- 
tural traditions. Performed year 
after year, generation after gen- 
eration, they translate enduring 
messages, values, and sentiments 
into observable action. Although 
some participants may be more 
strongly committed than others to 
the beliefs on which rituals are 
based, all people who take part 
in joint public acts signal their ac- 
ceptance of an order that trans- 
cends their status as individuals. 

In the view of some anthropolo- 
gists, including Rappaport himself, 
such secular institutions as Mc- 
Donald&apos;s are not comparable to 
rituals. They argue that rituals 
involve special emotions, nonutili- 
tarian intentions, and supernatural 
entities that are not characteristic 
of Americans&apos; participation in Mc- 
Donald&apos;s. But other anthropolo- 
gists define ritual more broadly. 
Writing about football in contem- 
porary America, William Arens 
{see &quot;The Great American Foot- 



ball Ritual,&quot; Natural History, Oc- 
tober 1975) points out that behavior 
can simultaneously have sacred as 
well as secular aspects. Thus, on 
one level, football can be inter- 
preted simply as a sport, while 
on another, it can be viewed as a 
public ritual. 

While McDonald&apos;s is definitely a 
mundane, secular institution — just 
a place to eat — it also assumes 
some of the attributes of a sacred 
place. And in the context of com- 
parative religion, why should this 
be surprising? The French sociol- 
ogist Emile Durkheim long ago 
pointed out that some societies 
worship the ridiculous as well as 
the sublime. The distinction be- 
tween the two does not depend 
on the intrinsic qualities of the 
sacred symbol. Durkheim found 
that Australian aborigines often 
worshiped such humble and non- 
imposing creatures as ducks, frogs, 
rabbits, and grubs — animals whose 
inherent qualities hardly could 
have been the origin of the religious 
sentiment they inspired. If frogs 
and grubs can be elevated to a 
sacred level, why not McDonald&apos;s? 

I frequently eat lunch — and, oc- 
casionally, breakfast and dinner — 
at McDonald&apos;s. More than a year 
ago, I began to notice (and have 
subsequently observed more care- 
fully) certain ritual behavior at 
these fast-food restaurants. Al- 
though for natives, McDonald&apos;s 
seems to be just a place to eat, 
careful observation of what goes on 
in any outlet in this country reveals 
an astonishing degree of formality 
and behavioral uniformity on the 
part of both staff and customers. 
Particularly impressive is the rela- 
tive invariance in act and utter- 
ance that has developed in the ab- 
sence of a distinct theological doc- 
trine. Rather, the ritual aspect of 
McDonald&apos;s rests on twentieth- 
century technology — particularly

automobiles, television, work lo- 
cales, and the one-hour lunch. 

The changes in technology and 
work organization that have con- 
tributed to the chain&apos;s growth in 
the United States are now taking 
place in other countries. Only in 
a country such as France, which 
has an established and culturally 
enshrined cuisine that hamburgers 
and fish fillets cannot hope to dis- 
place, is McDonald&apos;s expansion 
likely to be retarded. Why has Mc- 
Donald&apos;s been so much more suc- 
cessful than other businesses, than 
the United States Army, and even 
than many religious institutions in 
producing behavioral invariance? 
Remarkably, even Americans 
traveling abroad in countries noted

for their distinctive food usually 
visit the local McDonald&apos;s outlet. 
This odd behavior is probably 
caused by the same factors that 
urge us to make yet another trip 
to a McDonald&apos;s here. Wherever 
a McDonald&apos;s may be located, it is 
a home away from home. At any 
outlet, Americans know how to 
behave, what to expect, what they 
will eat, and what they will pay. 
If one has been unfortunate enough 
to have partaken of the often in- 
digestible pap dished out by any 
turnpike restaurant monopoly, the 
sight of a pair of McDonald&apos;s 
golden arches may justify a detour 
off the highway, even if the penalty 
is an extra toll. 
In Paris, where the French have 




not been especially renowned for 
making tourists feel at home, Mc- 
Donald&apos;s offers sanctuary. It is, 
after all, an American institution, 
where only Americans, who are 
programmed by years of prior ex- 
perience to salivate at the sight of 
the glorious hamburger, can feel 
completely at home. Americans in 
Paris can temporarily reverse roles 
with their hosts; if they cannot act 
like the French, neither can the 
French be expected to act in a cul- 
turally appropriate manner at Mc- 
Donald&apos;s. Away from home, Mc- 
Donald&apos;s, like a familiar church, 
offers not just hamburgers but 
comfort, security, and reassurance. 
An American&apos;s devotion to Mc- 
Donald&apos;s rests in part on uniformi- 
ties associated with almost all Mc- 
Donald&apos;s: setting, architecture, 
food, ambience, acts, and utter- 
ances. The golden arches, for 
example, serve as a familiar and 
almost universal landmark, absent 
only in those areas where zoning 
laws prohibit garish signs. At a 
McDonald&apos;s near the University of 
Michigan campus in Ann Arbor, 
a small, decorous sign — golden 
arches encircled in wrought iron — 
identifies the establishment. De- 
spite the absence of the towering 
arches, this McDonald&apos;s, where I 
have conducted much of my field- 
work, does not suffer as a ritual 
setting. The restaurant, a contem- 
porary brick structure that has been 
nominated for a prize in architec- 
tural design, is best known for its 
stained-glass windows, which in- 
corporate golden arches as their 
focal point. On bright days, sun- 
light floods in on waiting customers 
through a skylight that recalls the 
clerestory of a Gothic cathedral. In 
the case of this McDonald&apos;s, the 
effect is to equate traditional re- 
ligious symbols and golden arches. 
And in the view of the natives I 
have interviewed, the message is 
clear. 

When Americans go to a Mc- 
Donald&apos;s restaurant, they perform 
an ordinary, secular, biological 
act — they eat, usually lunch. Yet, 
immediately upon entering, we can 
tell from our surroundings that 
we are in a sequestered place, 
somehow apart from the messiness 
of the world outside. Except for 



such anomalies as the Ann Arbor 
campus outlet, the town house 
McDonald&apos;s in New York City, 
and the special theme McDonald&apos;s 
of such cities as San Francisco, 
Saint Paul, and Dallas, the restau- 
rants rely on their arches, dull 
brown brick, plate-glass sides, and 
mansard roofs to create a setting 
as familiar as home. In some of the 
larger outlets, murals depicting 
&quot;McDonaldland&quot; fantasy charac- 
ters, sports, outdoor activities, and 
landscapes surround plastic seats 
and tables. In this familiar setting, 
we do not have to consider the ex- 
perience. We know what we will 
see, say, eat, and pay. 

Behind the counter, McDonald&apos;s 
employees are differentiated into 
such categories as male staff, fe- 
male staff, and managers. While 
costumes vary slightly from outlet 
to outlet and region to region, 
such apparel as McDonald&apos;s hats, 
ties, and shirts, along with dark 
pants and shining black shoes, are 
standard. 

The food is also standard, again 
with only minor regional variations. 
(Some restaurants are selected to 
test such new menu items as &quot;Mc- 
Chicken&quot; or different milkshake 
flavors.) Most menus, however, 
from the rolling hills of Georgia to 
the snowy plains of Minnesota, 
offer the same items. The prices 
are also the same and the menu is 
usually located in the same place in 
every restaurant. 

Utterances across each spotless 
counter are standardized. Not only 
are customers limited in what they 
can choose but also in what they 
can say. Each item on the menu 
has its appropriate McDonald&apos;s 
designation: &quot;quarter pounder with 
cheese&quot; or &quot;filet-0-fish&quot; or &quot;large 
fries.&quot; The customer who asks, 
&quot;What&apos;s a Big Mac?&quot; is as out of 
place as a southern Baptist at a 
Roman Catholic Mass. 

At the McDonald&apos;s that I fre- 
quent, the phrases uttered by the 
salespeople are just as standard 
as those of the customers. If I ask 
for a quarter pounder, the ritual 
response is &quot;Will that be with 
cheese, sir?&quot; If I do not order 
French fries, the agent automati- 
cally incants, &quot;Will there be any 
fries today, sir?&quot; And when I pick

ii&apos;niiiiniiiiinniiiimmm 



up my order, the agent convention- 
ally says, &quot;Have a nice day, sir,&quot; 
followed by, &quot;Come in again.&quot; 

Nonverbal behavior of McDon- 
ald&apos;s agents is also programmed. 
Prior to opening the spigot of the 
drink machine, they fill paper cups 
with ice exactly to the bottom of 
the golden arches that decorate 
them. As customers request food, 
agents look back to see if the de- 
sired item is available. If not, they 
reply, &quot;That&apos;ll be a few minutes, 
sir (or ma&apos;am),&quot; after which the 
order of the next customer is taken. 

McDonald&apos;s lore of appropriate 
verbal and nonverbal behavior is 
even taught at a &quot;seminary,&quot; Ham- 
burger University, located in Elk 
Grove Village, Illinois, near Chi- 
cago&apos;s O&apos;Hare airport. Managers 
who attend choose either a two- 
week basic &quot;operator&apos;s course&quot; or 
an eleven-day &quot;advanced opera- 
tor&apos;s course.&quot; With a 360-page 
Operations Manual as their bible, 
students learn about food, equip- 
ment, and management tech- 
niques — delving into such esoteric 
subjects as buns, shortening, and 
carbonization. Filled with the spirit 
of McDonald&apos;s, graduates take 
home such degrees as bachelor or 
master of hamburgerology to dis- 
play in their outlets. Their job is 
to spread the word — the secret suc- 
cess formula they have learned — 
among assistant managers and 
crew in their restaurants. 

The total McDonald&apos;s ambience 
invites comparison with sacred 
places. The chain stresses clean 
living and reaffirms those tradi- 
tional American values that tran- 
scend McDonald&apos;s itself. Max 
Boas and Steve Chain, biographers 
of McDonald&apos;s board chairman, 
Ray Kroc, report that after the 
hundredth McDonald&apos;s opened in 
1959, Kroc leased a plane to survey 
likely sites for the chain&apos;s expan- 
sion. McDonald&apos;s would invade the 
suburbs by locating its outlets near 
traffic intersections, shopping cen- 
ters, and churches. Steeples fig- 
ured prominently in Kroc&apos;s plan. 
He believed that suburban church- 
goers would be preprogrammed 
consumers of the McDonald&apos;s for- 
mula — quality, service, and clean- 
liness. 

McDonald&apos;s restaurants, nestled 



1&apos; 



79 




beneath their transcendent arches 
and the American flag, would en- 
close immaculate restrooms and 
floors, counters and stainless steel 
kitchens. Agents would sparkle, 
radiating health and warmth. Al- 
though to a lesser extent than a 
decade ago, management scruti- 
nizes employees&apos; hair length, 
height, nails, teeth, and complex- 
ions. Long hair, bad breath, stained 
teeth, and pimples are anathema. 
Food containers also defy pollu- 
tion; they are used only once. (In 
New York City, the fast-food chain 
Chock Full O&apos; Nuts foreshadowed 
this theme long ago and took it one 
step further by assuring customers 
that their food was never touched 
by human hands.) 

Like participation in rituals, 
there are times when eating at Mc- 
Donald&apos;s is not appropriate. A 
meal at McDonald&apos;s is usually con- 
fined to ordinary, everyday life. 
Although the restaurants are open 
virtually every day of the year, 
most Americans do not go there 
on Thanksgiving, Easter, Pass- 
over, or other religious and quasi- 
religious days. Our culture re- 
serves holidays for family and 
friends. Although Americans neg- 
lect McDonald&apos;s on holidays, the 
chain reminds us through tele- 
vision that it still endures, that it 
will welcome us back once our 
holiday is over. 

The television presence of Mc- 
Donald&apos;s is particularly obvious on 
holidays, whether it be through the 
McDonald&apos;s AU-American March- 



ing Band (two clean-cut high school 
students from each state) in a na- 
tionally televised Thanksgiving 
Day parade or through sponsor- 
ship of sports and family enter- 
tainment programs. 

Although such chains as Burger 
King, Burger Chef, and Arby&apos;s 
compete with McDonald&apos;s for the 
fast-food business, none rivals 
McDonald&apos;s success. The explana- 
tion reflects not just quality, serv- 
ice, cleanliness, and value but, 
more importantly, McDonald&apos;s ad- 
vertising, which skillfully appeals 
to different audiences. Saturday 
morning television, for example, 
includes a steady dose of cartoons 
and other children&apos;s shows spon- 
sored by McDonald&apos;s. The com- 
mercials feature several McDon- 
aldland fantasy characters, headed 
by the clown Ronald McDonald, 
and often stress the enduring as- 
pects of McDonald&apos;s. In one, Ron- 
ald has a time machine that en- 
ables him to introduce hamburgers 
to the remote past and the distant 
future. Anyone who noticed the 
shot of the McDonald&apos;s restaurant 
in the Woody Allen film Sleeper, 
which takes place 200 years hence, 
will be aware that the message of 
McDonald&apos;s as eternal has gotten 
across. Other children&apos;s com- 
mercials gently portray the con- 
flict between good (Ronald) and 
evil (Hamburglar). McDonaldland&apos;s 
bloblike Grimace is hooked on 
milkshakes, and Hamburglar&apos;s ad- 
diction to simple burgers regularly 
culminates in his confinement to a 





&quot;patty wagon,&quot; as Ronald and Big 
Mac restore and preserve the social 
order. 

Pictures of McDonaldland ap- 
pear on cookie boxes and. from 
time to time, on durable plastic 
cups that are given away with the 
purchase of a large soft drink. Ac- 
cording to Boas and Chain, a Mc- 
Donaldland amusement park, com- 
parable in scale to Disneyland, is 
planned for Las Vegas. Even more 
obvious are children&apos;s chances to 
meet Ronald McDonald and other 
McDonaldland characters in the 
flesh. Actors portraying Ronald 
scatter their visits, usually on Sat- 
urdays, among McDonald&apos;s outlets 
throughout the country. A Ronald 
can even be rented for a birthday

party or for Halloween trick or 
treating. 

McDonald&apos;s adult advertising 
has a diflferent, but equally eflFec- 
tive, theme. In 1976, a fresh-faced, 
sincere young woman invited the 
viewer to try breakfast — a new 
meal at McDonald&apos;s — in a familiar 
setting. In still other commercials, 
healthy, clean-living Americans 
gambol on ski slopes or in moun- 
tain pastures. The single theme 
running throughout all the adult 
commercials is personalism. Mc- 
Donald&apos;s, the commercials tell us, 
is not just a fast-food restaurant. 
It is a warm, friendly place where 
you will be graciously welcomed. 
Here, you will feel at home with 
your family, and your children will 



not get into trouble. The word you 
is emphasized — &quot;You deserve a 
break today&quot;; &quot;You, you&apos;re the 
one&quot;; &quot;We do it all for you.&quot; 
McDonald&apos;s commercials say that 
you are not simply a face in a 
crowd. At McDonald&apos;s, you can 
find respite from a hectic and im- 
personal society — the break you 
deserve. 

Early in 1977, after a brief flirta- 
tion with commercials that harped 
on the financial and gustatory bene- 
fits of eating at McDonald&apos;s, the 
chain introduced one of its most 
curious incentives — the &quot;Big Mac 
attack.&quot; Like other extraordinary 
and irresistible food cravings, which 
people in many cultures attribute to 
demons or other spirits, a Big Mac 



attack could strike anyone at any 
time. In one commercial, passen- 
gers on a jet forced the pilot to land 
at the nearest McDonald&apos;s. In oth- 
ers, a Big Mac attack had the power 
to give life to an inanimate object, 
such as a suit of armor, or restore 
a mummy to life. 

McDonald&apos;s advertising typi- 
cally de-emphasizes the fact that 
the chain is, after all, a profit- 
making organization. By stressing 
its program of community projects, 
some commercials present McDon- 
ald&apos;s as a charitable organization. 
During the Bicentennial year, com- 
mercials reported that McDonald&apos;s 
was giving 1,776 trees to every 
state in the union. Brochures at 
outlets echo the television mes-

sage that, through McDonald&apos;s, 
one can sponsor a carnival to aid 
victims of muscular dystrophy. 
In 1976 and 1977 McDonald&apos;s man- 
agers in Ann Arbor persuaded 
police officers armed with metal 
detectors to station themselves at 
restaurants during Halloween to 
check candy and fruit for hidden 
pins and razor blades. Free coffee 
was offered to parents. In 1976, 
McDonald&apos;s sponsored a radio se- 
ries documenting the contributions 
Blacks have made to American 
history. 

McDonald&apos;s also sponsored such 
family television entertainment as 
the film The Sound of Music, com- 
plete with a prefatory, sermonlike 
address by Ray Kroc. Commer- 



cials during the film showed Ron- 
ald McDonald picking up after 
litterbugs and continued with the 
theme, &quot;We do it all for you.&quot; 
Other commercials told us that 
McDonald&apos;s supports and works to 
maintain the values of American 
family life — and went so far as to 
suggest a means of strengthening 
what most Americans conceive 
to be the weakest link in the nu- 
clear family, that of father-child. 
&quot;Take a father to lunch,&quot; kids 
were told. 

Participation in McDonald&apos;s rit- 
uals involves temporary subordina- 
tion of individual differences in a 
social and cultural collectivity. 
By eating at McDonald&apos;s, not only 
do we communicate that we are 




hungry, enjoy hamburgers, and 
have inexpensive tastes but also 
that we are willing to adhere to a 
value system and a series of be- 
haviors dictated by an exterior 
entity. In a land of tremendous 
ethnic, social, economic, and re- 
ligious diversity, we proclaim that 
we share something with millions 
of other Americans. 

Sociologists, cultural anthropol- 
ogists, and others have shown that 
social ties based on kinship, mar- 
riage, and community are grow- 
ing weaker in the contemporary 
United States. Fewer and fewer 
people participate in traditional 
organized religions. By joining 
sects, cults, and therapy sessions, 
Americans seek many of the se- 
curities that formal religion gave to 
our ancestors. The increasing cul- 
tural, rather than just economic, 
significance of McDonald&apos;s, foot- 
ball, and similar institutions is inti- 
mately linked to these changes. 

As industrial society shunts 
people around, church allegiance 
declines as a unifying moral force. 
Other institutions are also taking 
over the functions of formal reli- 
gions. At the same time, tradition- 
ally organized religions — Protes- 
tantism, Catholicism, and Juda- 
ism — are reorganizing themselves 
along business lines. With such 
changes, the gap between the sym- 
bolic meaning of traditional reli- 
gions and the realities of modem 
life widens. Because of this, some 
sociologists have argued that the 
study of modern religion must 
merge with the study of mass cul- 
ture and mass communication. 

In this context, McDonald&apos;s 
has become one of many new and 
powerful elements of American 
culture that provide common ex- 
pectations, experience, and be- 
havior — overriding region, class, 
formal religious affiliation, politi- 
cal sentiments, gender, age, ethnic 
group, sexual preference, and 
urban, suburban, or rural resi- 
dence. By incorporating — wittingly

Climate and the Planets 



by Richard Goody 



Knowledge gained in the 
exploration of Mars 
and Venus throws light 
on questions concerning 
the terrestrial atmosphere 

Can ideas gleaned from studies of 
the inner planets point the way to 
the solution of an important terres- 
trial problem? The question is ob- 
viously rhetorical since I anticipate 
that the reader will answer &quot;yes.&quot; 
My personal research interests lie 
both in the behavior of the earth&apos;s 
atmosphere and in the nature of the 
other planets of the solar system. 
Although the planets diflFer greatly 
from one another, they also have 
important fundamental similarities. 
In so stating I am thinking mainly of 
the inner planets — Venus, Mars, 
and Earth. The outer planets, Jupi- 
ter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, 
and the two small, airless bodies, 
Pluto and Mercury, differ suffi- 



ciently from the earth that analo- 
gies are few. 

In my professional work I have 
found it interesting and instructive 
to let my thoughts go back and forth 
from the immense detail known 
about our own planet to the sparser 
and very different information 
available from Mars and Venus. I 
hope to give a general impression of 
what this implies by means of a few 
specific examples. 

The terrestrial problem that I 
have in mind is climate and its vari- 
ation, a topic that becomes increas- 
ingly important as the criticality of 
global food supplies receives more 
emphasis and as our capability of 
understanding our atmosphere in- 
creases. We are still in an early re- 
search phase. I doubt very much 
whether there will soon, if ever, be 
ten-year predictions of the climate 
or safe and controlled means of 
changing it. I emphasize the words 
&quot;safe and controlled&quot; because 



man, with characteristic haste, is 
already involved in both deliberate 
and accidental climate modification 
without the minimum understand- 
ing required to make such tamper- 
ing safe and controlled. But that is 
not part of this story. 

I can present a picture of climatic 
change in terms of recent and famil- 
iar human experiences, from the 
pages of written history, from the 
testimony of archeological finds, 
and from many aspects of the geo- 
logic record. In recent decades, 
particularly because of the power of 
isotopic-dating techniques, these 
sources of information have coa- 
lesced into the beginnings of a con- 
sistent picture of significant changes 
in all meteorological elements, on 
every time scale from year to year 
to tens of millions of years. 

To look at recent events, a cata- 
strophic drought in the Sahel region 
of North Africa is now, fortunately, 
receding; on the other hand, we are 




experiencing diflBcuIties and dis- 
comfort from a series of dry years 
in the western United States. Before 
that, in the 1960s, it was the turn of 
the east coast, which suffered a 
mini-drought that nearly emptied 
the reservoirs. And, to make the 
Great Depression even less bear- 
able, western Kansas and other 
parts of the Great Plains suffered 
the dust bowl disasters of the 1930s. 
All of these events involved de- 
creased rainfall, undoubtedly the 
most important aspect of climatic 
change, although temperature is 
easier to assess objectively. 

From about 1890, when the mod- 
ern thermometer became available, 
until 1940, amateur scientists 
helped to establish that, at least in 
the Northern Hemisphere, the tem- 
perature rose about 0.6°C. You may 
regard that as a very small change 
but, maintained over many years, it 
can have important effects. I recol- 
lect climbing in Austria and Switz- 



erland in the 1950s with maps based 
on surveys made in the early part 
of the century. The glaciers I en- 
countered were not where they 
were shown on the maps; in some 
cases the snout was several miles 
farther back than indicated. 

This warming up seems to have 
been part of a general trend leading 
out of a cold period in the sixteenth, 
seventeenth, and eighteenth cen- 
turies known as the Little Ice Age, 
a time when British writings refer to 
ice fairs on the Thames in London 
at which oxen were roasted on open 
fires. Needless to say, this would 
be inconceivable nowadays. 

As we go backward from the 
present, the records become less 
precise; nonetheless they show that 
we are looking at a continuing series 
of climatic changes. The archeologi- 
cal records show major differences 
in human life patterns that can only 
be accounted for in terms of a 
changed environment. The Norse 



voyages to North America would 
have been difficult, and the coloni- 
zation of Greenland impossible, 
with the present climate. Appar- 
ently, the North Atlantic had a mild 
climate from a.d. 600 to 1300. 

During the same period there 
must have been important changes 
in the southwest of this country. 
Pueblo Bonito, in what is now New 
Mexico, exists only as a ruin in an 
inhospitable canyon where the de- 
scendants of the Anasazi can no 
longer live. Elaborate dwellings still 



The inner planets, Earth, Venus, 
and Mars, have very different 
atmospheres. Nevertheless, 
information about our planetary 
neighbors gained from space 
probes can help us understand 
climatic change on Earth.

retain roof timbers from trees that 
could not grow today in any acces- 
sible location. In the eleventh and 
twelfth centuries the Anasazi mi- 
grated to the Hopi mesas, in what 
is now Arizona, and to the Rio 
Grande, presumably because their 
water supplies failed. 

Archeological and anthropologi- 
cal reasoning takes us further back, 
to times when the Sahara had ade- 
quate rainfall for agriculture and to 
intervals, some 10,000 to 20,000 
years ago, when human beings 
could migrate from Asia to Amer- 
ica across the Bering Strait. In that 
period we enter the most recent of 
the great Pleistocene ice surges, 
which, according to the geologic 
record, came and went periodically 
during the last million years. During 
one of these major ice surges, the 
temperature of the Northern Hemi- 
sphere may have been as little as 
10°C colder than today. There is no 
reason to believe that a similar cool- 
ing could not happen again. 

At this point you may reasonably 
wonder what Mars and Venus can 
have to do with the problem of cli- 
matic change. As I have already im- 
plied, the answer is relatively little, 
directly, but a great deal indirectly. 
Curiously enough, although we can 
now predict weather for a few days 
ahead, we are very uncertain as to 
the physical causes leading to the 
climate in any given epoch. Many 
important considerations may be 
involved. For one, the sun&apos;s radia- 
tion output may change, altering the 
total amount of heat falling on the 
earth. This heat provides the driv- 
ing force for all atmospheric mo- 
tions and is fundamental to all cli- 
mate considerations. (Some aspects 
of solar variation have been de- 
scribed in &quot;The Turbulent Sun,&quot; a 
supplement in Natural History, 
November 1976.) Other important 
possibilities are changes in the 
earth&apos;s surface caused by crustal 
plate motions, variations in the 
composition of the atmosphere by 
natural events or by human inter- 
vention, changes in atmospheric 
dust and particles related to vol- 
canic activity, deviations in the 
ocean currents (which strongly in- 
fluence coastal climates), waxing 
and waning of the polar icecaps, 
factors affecting cloudiness, varia- 
tions in the earth&apos;s orbit around the 
sun, and fluctuations in atmospheric 
flow patterns not attributable to ex- 
ternal circumstances. 




One aspect of the subject of cli- 
matic change is that with a single 
planet the only way to test a theory 
rigorously is to tinker with the en- 
vironment and that, as we are in- 
creasingly aware, is dangerous. So 
we fall back on the broader tapestry 
of the solar system for some help. 
If we have sufficiently understood 
our own global atmospheric phe- 
nomena, then the same ideas should 
be applicable to the different cir- 
cumstances of another atmosphere, 
and if the theories work out, we 
may feel confidence in our initial 
terrestrial conclusions. 

Mars, Venus, and Earth offer 
some important quantitative simi- 
larities and differences. The earth&apos;s 
rotation is an essential element in 
mid-latitude weather. Mars rotates 
at about the same rate as the earth, 
but Venus scarcely rotates at all. 
Atmospheric chemical composition 
may affect the surface temperature, 
some aspects of atmospheric mo- 
tions, and cloud formation. The 
earth&apos;s atmosphere consists princi- 
pally of oxygen and nitrogen, while 
the atmospheres of Mars and Venus 
have carbon dioxide as their princi- 
pal constituent. Clouds are a crucial 
element of climate: Mars has only 
rare condensation clouds; Venus is 
totally covered by clouds; and the 
earth is halfway between, with clear

Pueblo Bonito, an uninhabitable 
ruin in the Four Corners area of 
the Southwest, was a thriving 
communal Indian dwelling place 
in A.D. 1000. Failure of the 
water supply in the eleventh 
and twelfth centuries forced 
the inhabitants to migrate.

mines the degree of temperature 
contrast between the equator and 
the poles. With respect to the earth, 
Mars has less than a hundredth part 
of the surface pressure, while Ve- 
nus has almost one hundred times 
as much. 

This recitation of similarities and 
diflFerences could continue, but I 
believe that I have made my point. 
We will therefore go on to the next 
stage and describe, by means of 
examples, a number of areas in 
which the behaviors of planetary 
atmospheres are helping to instruct 
us about the earth. 

The first concerns the diflFerence 
in temperature between the equator 
and the poles. The question is not 
why the equator is hotter. This is a

disappeared completely when I stancd apply-

one meeting to another still fresh, with energy 
to spare. I&apos;m a much better listener and my 
reaction time is quicker, I can do each thing in 
its own time frame and as a result I get a great

A Martian dust storm, about 
186 miles across (indicated by 
arrow), was photographed by 
Viking 2. Local dust storms, 
such as this one, can spread 
over the entire planet, thereby 
producing climatic change. 



determined by looicing at a globe, 
remembering that the sun&apos;s rays 
strike approximately at right angles 
to the axis of rotation for all three 
planets. The amount of radiation 
falling on a given area of a planet&apos;s 
surface varies with the obliquity of 
the sun&apos;s rays. A large amount of 
solar radiation is absorbed in the 
tropics but where the sun&apos;s rays 
pass tangentially (somewhere in the 
polar regions) a minute amount of 
sunlight warms the surface. 

In the simplest case, surface tem- 
perature should follow the amount 
of sunlight. If there is no sunlight, 
the temperature can sink to abso- 
lute zero, -273°C (-460°F). Thus, 
for a planet without atmosphere or 
oceans, we might expect the tem- 
peratures to vary from absolute 
zero at the poles to a few hundred 
degrees above absolute zero in the 
tropics. In fact, the temperature of 
the earth&apos;s surface varies by only 



15 percent with respect to its mean 
value between the equator and the 
poles or, to put it another way, 
temperatures in the polar region are 
200° or so above the anticipated 
absolute zero. Our picture must 
therefore be deficient in some im- 
portant regard. What has been 
omitted is that both the atmosphere 
and the oceans carry heat in large 
amounts, tending to equalize the 
temperatures in equatorial and 
polar regions. That raises the ques- 
tion. What is it that governs the 
ability of an atmosphere to compen- 
sate diflFerences in solar radiation 
by means of atmospheric mixing? 
The reason I have asked this 
question is that it was not asked at 
all prior to the availability of data 
from Mars and Venus. These data 
show that the equator-to-pole tem- 




88 



N&apos; 



in 



perature contrast on Venus is less 
than 2 percent, close to that ex- 
pected for an intensely stirred at- 
mosphere. Mars, on the other hand, 
has a temperature contrast of 40 
percent, well on the way toward the 
case of an airless body. 

There are many factors involved 
in a complete explanation of these 
data, but the dramatic differences 
exhibited encourage a search for 
the simplest connection between 
the three planetary atmospheres. 
The essence of the argument can be 
captured as follows: The ability of 
an atmosphere to equalize tempera- 
tures by mixing does not depend on 
the mass of the atmosphere if the 
velocities involved in the mixing 
are comparable. On the other hand, 
the change in temperature that will 
take place in response to a change 
in insolation, or received solar radi- 
ation, is inversely related to the 
atmospheric mass. If these two 
processes conflict, as is the case in 
the three planets under discussion, 
the effect of differential solar heat- 
ing will be less on the planet with 
the more massive atmosphere. The 
global temperature contrasts and 
the surface pressures of Mars, 
Earth, and Venus are related pre- 
cisely in the sense that this argu- 
ment suggests, that is, the larger the 
surface pressure, the smaller the 
temperature contrast. 



This photomosaic made from 
photographs taken by Viking 2 
shows the Martian north polar 
icecap. Although water does not 
now exist in liquid form on 
Mars, there is evidence that 
it probably once did.

I will now turn to a second exam- 
ple. If we reduce the solar radiation 
reaching the earth&apos;s surface, the 
surface will cool; a I percent de- 
crease in solar radiation could cause 
the surface temperature to decrease 
by about 1°C. We have already seen 
how small temperature changes are 
associated with major climatic 
events. A decrease of solar radia- 
tion by 10 to 15 percent could cause 
an ice age. 

One way to vary the amount of 
solar radiation is to reflect some of 
it back into space from suspended 
particles. Clouds are a case in point. 
The loss of heat below a cloud deck, 
as contrasted to a clear sky over- 
head, is very evident to any sun- 
bather. 

Other particles, solid or liquid, 
can perform the same function as 
clouds. A permanent veil of dust in 
the air, such as that from volcanic 
eruptions, can lead to a lowering of 
the surface temperature. Major vol- 
canic explosions, such as Krakatoa 
in 1883, Pelee in 1902, and Mount 
Agung in 1963, injected vast 
amounts of dust into the strato- 
sphere, where it spread over much 
of the globe, causing spectacular 
twilight colors for several years. 
Some believe that increases in vol- 
canic activity could have caused the 
Pleistocene glaciations. I tend to 
favor another explanation, but that 
does not reduce the importance of 
understanding this phenomenon, 
particularly since atmospheric dust 
is also a byproduct of the industrial 
age and the artificial could even- 
tually exceed the natural variety. 

One long-lasting eflFect of a vol- 
canic eruption comes from the sul- 
fur in the emitted gases. This sulfur 
goes through a series of reactions 
and eventually forms sulfate com- 
pounds. These compounds collect 
as a long-lived layer in the lower 
stratosphere that might have signifi- 
cant climatic results. The sulfate 
layer exhibits itself as a subtle ef- 
fect in the twilight, known as the 
&quot;purple light,&quot; when the sun sets 
some 4° below the horizon. The sul- 
fate layer seems to persist between 
volcanic events but it then consists 
primarily of drops of concentrated 
sulfuric acid. This explanation 
comes straight from our experience 
with the clouds of Venus. 

It is very difficult to calculate the 
composition of particles in a cloud 
without direct in siiii measure- 
ments, and it required a mixture of

good fortune and very careful ob- 
servation to reach the present con- 
sensus that the clouds of Venus 
consist of small drops of concen- 
trated sulfuric acid. That discovery 
was regarded as somewhat bizarre, 
as was the terrestrial sulfate layer 
discovered some decades previ- 
ously. 

How did such a strange sub- 
stance as sulfuric acid come to form 
a continuous cloud layer? The sur- 
face of Venus is very hot; at 700° 
absolute it should be a visible dull 
red. This circumstance led investi- 
gators to think out from first prin- 
ciples what chemical species might 
occur if the surface of Venus were 
similar in composition to that of the 
earth. One result of this discussion 
was to predict the existence of an 
obscure substance, carbonyl sul- 
fide, a figment of the imagination 
at this stage, for we have, as yet, no 
chemical measurements of the 
lower atmosphere of Venus. Never- 
theless, its hypothetical existence 
fits with the presence of sulfuric 
acid clouds since there is a predict- 
able scheme of chemical reactions 
that could lead from carbonyl sul- 
fide to sulfuric acid at the observed 
cloud levels. 

The final chapter in this story 
was the recent discovery of minute 
traces of carbonyl sulfide in the 
earth&apos;s atmosphere and the imme- 
diate analogy that could be drawn 
with Venus in order to explain the 
earth&apos;s sulfate layer. 

Changing topics again, we may 
consider the more speculative, but 
far more dangerous, possibility of a 
climate catastrophe; that is, that 
our planet could, perhaps suddenly, 
change to a completely diflferent 
condition. 

One important possibility, at 
least as a &quot;mind experiment,&quot; is 
that the terrestrial oceans might 
freeze over. I find it somewhat sur- 
prising that the geologic record con- 
tains no evidence for such an event. 
On the contrary, it appears that gla- 
ciations were rather rare, there be- 
ing only one other previous to those 
of the Pleistocene epoch. I find this 
surprising for two reasons. First, 
astronomers are rather certain that 
the sun was cooler in earlier epochs 
than it now is. Second, if one ac- 
cepts the arguments of Budyko, the 
Soviet geographer, a very small 
decrease in solar radiation could 
cause the polar ice sheet to spread 
to the equator.

The reason for this is simple. We 
have already discussed how a de- 
crease in solar radiation leads to a 
decrease in temperature and how 
clouds might bring about such a 
decrease. Now substitute snow and 
ice cover for clouds and we see how 
a protracted cold period could lead 
to a surface that reflects much more 
solar radiation than do either the 
continents or the liquid oceans at 
the present time. Even without a 
decrease in solar radiation, it is con- 
ceivable that if the oceans were 
once to freeze, they would reflect 
so much radiation back into space 
that they might not melt again. 

This is not a wild speculation but 
a plausible conclusion, even though 
the scarcity of major glaciations ex- 
hibited in the earth&apos;s geologic rec- 
ord suggests that the reasoning is 
faulty. If we look elsewhere to see 
whether climate catastrophes are 
possible, traces of one can readily 
be seen on the surface of Mars. 

Mars is colder than the earth; 
water does not exist there as a liq- 
uid but rather as permafrost, small 
polar icecaps, and possibly as large 
subsurface ice deposits. Even if the 
temperature were to rise above the 



melting point for ice, the atmo- 
spheric pressure is too low to allow 
liquid water to exist; instead, it 
would boil and enter the atmo- 
sphere as vapor. There is, how- 
ever, spectacular evidence suggest- 
ing that liquid must have flowed 
over the surface of Mars on some 
occasion in its 4.5-billion-year his- 
tory, and water is the only likely 
candidate. The implication is that, 
at one time, conditions on Mars 
must have diflFered greatly from 
those that are now observed. The 
evidence points to a climate catas- 
trophe. 

There is another and even more 
disturbing climatic possibility, 
which planetary research may help 
to clarify, the so-called runaway 
greenhouse eflFect. The question 
under consideration is whether the 
surface of the earth could ever be- 
come like the surface of Venus, 
where the temperature is high 
enough to melt lead and all life, as 
we know it, is impossible. To an- 
swer this we must attempt to under- 
stand why Venus is as it is. 

The runaway greenhouse phe- 
nomenon concerns the eflFect of 
atmospheric water vapor and car-

bon dioxide upon surface tempera- 
ture. Both gases are transparent to 
solar radiation and do not interfere 
with its absorption at the planet&apos;s 
surface. They are not, however, 
transparent to the thermal infrared 
radiation emitted by the surface, 
which in the long run balances the 
incoming solar radiation. This semi- 
transparent gaseous screen inter- 
cepts some of the outgoing thermal 
radiation and the surface must be- 
come hotter and emit more radia- 
tion to balance the incoming solar 
heat. Thus, the more water vapor 
or carbon dioxide in the atmo- 
sphere, the higher the surface tem- 
perature. 

Yet another connection between 
surface temperature and vapor 
pressure exists, namely, that the 
pressure of the vapor above a liquid 
surface increases as the tempera- 
ture increases. This is why clothes 
dry more readily when heated and 
why water will boil if the tempera- 
ture is high enough. As the tem- 
perature rises, therefore, the 
amount of water vapor above a 
water surface increases and the 
greenhouse eflFect then leads to a 
higher temperature, hence to a 
higher vapor pressure, and so on — 
each boosting the other in turn. De- 
tailed calculations are required to 
understand whether this chain reac- 
tion tends toward a steady condi- 
tion, as in a nuclear reactor, or 
toward a runaway condition, as in 
an atomic bomb. 

The answer depends upon how 
close we are to the sun. It appears 
that there is a critical distance from 
the sun, somewhere between that 
of Earth and that of Venus, that 
enables us to enjoy a controlled 
situation while Venus undergoes its 
present inhospitable runaway con- 
dition. 

If all this is correct, we may be 
dangerously close to disaster. Rela- 
tively small changes in the amount 
of our clouds, the nature of our sur- 
face, or the chemical composition 
of our atmosphere could bring us 
closer to Venus&apos;s condition. There 
is no reason that we know of to take 
alarm at this circumstance, but 
every reason to investigate our 
nearest neighbor with great care. 

My final vignette concerns dust 
storms. You should be convinced 
at this point that dust in the atmo- 
sphere can aflFect the climate in an 
important way, and a number of 
human activities can influence this 



92 



factor: overgrazing, irrigation, in- 
dustrial effluents, and photochemi- 
cal smogs, to name a few. One 
problem is that winds can raise 
dust, which can then change the 
weather and thereby influence the 
dust amount. How do these proc- 
esses interact and could they, like 
the ice cover or the greenhouse 
effect, run away in an uncontrolled 
manner? 

We have not gotten very far with 
this question in terms of terrestrial 
happenings, but the global dust 
storms of Mars present us with 
spectacular and possibly related 
events to study. 

The atmosphere of Mars is usu- 
ally fairly clear. It is true that it 
contains a larger amount of dust in 
proportion to gas than does the 
earth. It was a minor surprise of the 
Viking mission (although it should 
not have been) that the Martian sky 
is colored red by the dust rather 
than being blue, as in the scattering 
by gaseous molecules on the earth. 

The dust suspended in the Mar- 
tian atmosphere can absorb solar 
radiation, and since there is so 
much dust in relationship to the 
tenuous atmosphere, the heating 



rate can be very great. It can go as 
high as tens of degrees in a single 
day, a rate that typically occurs in a 
terrestrial hurricane. In the latter 
case, the heating is caused by con- 
densing water, but the effect is sim- 
ilar; namely, that a substance, 
water or dust, is raised from the 
surface and then rapidly heats the 
atmosphere. In either event the 
heat released can drive a gigantic 
heat engine fueled by the materials 
raised by its own winds. The engine 
can, therefore, sustain itself and 
build up to dangerous intensities. 
There is an important difference, 
however, between a hurricane and 
a large dust storm — the condensed 
water of a hurricane falls out rap- 
idly as rain, while dust can linger 
in suspension for days or weeks. A 
Martian dust storm can continue to 
pump dust from the surface until 
the stratosphere over the entire 
planet is filled. Thus when Mariner 
9 reached Mars in 1971, the planet&apos;s 
surface could not be seen; only 
three large volcanoes showed as 
traces on the television images. 
Fortunately, the dust settled after 
a week or two and the Mariner 
cameras could carry out their map- 



ping mission according to plan. 

The most recent Viking pictures 
capture examples of some small 
dust storms and of one storm that 
achieved global proportions. We do 
not have all the data needed to 
understand these events but the po- 
tential for uncovering clues in a 
class of climate problems is enough 
to justify careful comparative stud- 
ies of Martian and comparable ter- 
restrial phenomena. 

I have tried to show how ideas 
can move back and forth between 
planetary and terrestrial atmos- 
pheric problems to the benefit of 
both subjects. In fact, they are not 
two subjects, but one. Lest I be 
misunderstood, I do not suggest 
that planetary research should be 
chosen as the main approach to all 
or any terrestrial climate problems. 
At best, we gain inspiration from 
such studies. The required answers 
to specific questions about climate 
must also be reachable without the 
use of space probes. Nevertheless, 
the knowledge gained from plane- 
tary exploration can help us better 
understand some terrestrial prob- 
lems and I, for one, greatly appre- 
ciate that bonus. D

Xrom sea to shining sea, America is blessed with an 
abundance of stunning birds and flowers. A glorious, spirited 
patchwork of sound, color and fragrance. 

In every state, nature&apos;s beauty abounds. Americans know 
it, and are proud of it. And with each new song a bird sings, 
and each new flower that blossoms, that pride is renewed 
and strengthened. 

To forever affirm this pride and respect for the natural 
environment, each of the fifty states has chosen an official 
state bird and flower as a lasting acknowledgement of 
nature&apos;s bounty. Seen together, as they are in this collection. 
The Birds and Flowers of the 50 States capture the total 



richness of the great American outdoors, and prove that 
nature, in all her glory, is an everlasting part of America the 
Beautiful. 

It is appropriate, therefore, at a time when Americans are 
dedicating themselves to preserving and protecting the 
natural environment, that America&apos;s foremost conservation 
group — the National Audubon Society — has appointed 
Fleetwood to issue the first philatelic collection honoring 
these living symbols of the United States. 

Fifty original works of art by 
America&apos;s greatest wildlife artist 

Each of the commemorative covers in The Birds and 
Flowers of the 50 States is a triumph of craftsmanship and 
design by a man who is often called America&apos;s greatest living 
wildlife artist: Arthur Singer. For nearly two years, Arthur 
Singer has labored to achieve the perfection and absolute 
fidelity to nature that a collection of this importance 




Covers shown

Arthur Singer is often called America&apos;s 
greatest living wildlife artist. Of special 
interest to collectors, this is the first time 
he has ever consented to create a series 
of philatelic covers. 



The cachet of each issue is an 
original painting of the state bird 
and flower by Arthur Singer, 
perfect in every detail and true to 
nature&apos;s colors. 



Each of the fifty covers will be issued in 
the appropriate state capital on the 
anniversary of statehood, and will be 
officially postmarked to certify that it 
can never again be issued. 



deserves. As a result, collectors who acquire these fifty 
covers will own what is surely the most comprehensive, 
most authentic tribute of its kind ever issued. 

Singer&apos;s paintings capture each bird in its true colors and 
shadings. The flame-red plumage of Ohio&apos;s Cardinal. The 
startling brightness of New York&apos;s Bluebird. The dramatic 
orange and black contrast of Maryland&apos;s Baltimore Oriole. 
The head, the feathers, the beak and the tail of each bird is 
shown in exquisite, and accurate, detail. 

A rainbow of floral colors 

The state flowers, from the delicate blossoms to the 
graceful leaves, are just as real. And the colors! The bright 
orange of the California Poppy. Breathtaking Texas 
Bluebonnets. Soft pink, sweetly-scented Mayflowers from 
Massachusetts. Here is a collection which forms a rainbow 
of floral colors, textures and shapes — a dream garden filled 
with America&apos;s most beautiful flowers. 

Arthur Singer has created /i/ty perfectly-colored, 
perfectly-detailed masterpieces for The Birds and Flowers of 
the 50 States, making this a landmark collection that will be 
praised by collectors and nature lovers for years to come. 

Historic postmarks 

Significantly, each of the fifty covers will be issued in the 
appropriate state capital on the precise ar^niversarii of 
statehood. There, each will be officially postmarked by the 
United States Postal Service. The covers honoring the 
thirteen original states will be issued on the anniversaries of 
their ratification of the Constitution. Thus, the collection is 




not only a worthy tribute to the official state birds and 
flowers, but, as the postmarks certify, a collection which can 
never again be duplicated. 

Surprisingly modest cost 

Normally, a collection of this scope, by an artist with the 
international reputation of Arthur Singer, would be beyond 
the reach of most collectors. Therefore it is significant that 
the original issue price for The Birds and Flowers of the 50 
States is a very modest $2.50 per Commemorative Cover. 
This price is guaranteed for the entire collection, and a 
deluxe collector&apos;s album is included at no additional cost. 

Subscribers will receive issues at the convenient rate of 
four per month for twelve months. The twelfth shipment will 
include six issues. Shipments may be paid for by check or 
money order, or automatically billed to a credit card 
account. 

Deadline for application; January 31. 1978 

This magnificent tribute will be issued only in 1978, and is 
available to you only by advance subscription. The edition is 
forever limited to the exact number of valid applications 
postmarked by January 31, 1978. 

Therefore, to share in the excitement of the official 
National Audubon Society collection of The Birds and 
Flowers of the 50 States, mail the attached Subscription

The Human Condition 



1 



Humankind, by Peter Farb. Hough- 
ton Mifflin Company, $15.95; 544 
pp.. illus. 



Sydney Smith, English wit and 
writer of the early nineteenth cen- 
tury, was asked by a froward young 
lady at a dinner party whether he 
read the books he reviewed. Where- 
upon Smith replied, &quot;Dear me, no. 
It prejudices a man so.&quot; I must con- 
fess that after reading the first 
ninety pages of this magisterial 
work, it was clear to me that if the 
author maintained the same rate of 
error, skewness, and misinterpre- 
tation throughout the book, I 
should not be suflRciently able to 
unprejudice myself in favor of its 
good qualities to recommend it to 
the attention of the reader. 

But after that small segment of 
ninety pages it is as if the author 
had suddenly found his way out of 
the darkness into the broad light of 
day, for in the remainder of the 
book virtually all error, skewness, 
and misinterpretation fall away, 
and one finds oneself cheering the 
author&apos;s success in bringing oflF a 
feat that I, at least, can only marvel 
at. &quot;And still the wonder grew/ 
That one small head could carry 
all he knew.&quot; Not that the re- 
mainder of the book is totally free 
of errors, but they are of a trivial 
nature and none of them signifi- 
cantly affect the point the author is 
making. However, lest the reader 
feel disappointed, here is a brief 
sample taken at random. The term 
Ramapitheciis is not derived from 
two Greek words. One-egged twins 
should not be called &quot;identical&quot; 
because they can be both chro- 
mosomally and constitutionally dif- 
ferent. No human has ever been 
bom with a genuine tail. Darwin did 
have a retarded son. It does not 
cost $200,000 to raise a child from 
conception through four years of 
college, but by the latest (October 
1977) estimate, $64,000. And so on. 



This small sampling will do. The 
reader will perceive that the type of 
error cited is really of no great 
moment. And so let us proceed to 
the book itself. 

What Farb has attempted to do in 
this book is to give the reader some- 
thing more than the usual super- 
ficial account of the rise and de- 
velopment of humankind. He suc- 
ceeds where others have failed 
because he continually probes be- 
neath the surface in the endeavor to 
find the causes of things. He never 
glosses. He goes into detail. When 
he doesn&apos;t know, he says so. He 
has read widely and well, and he 
possesses the gift of writing clearly 
and simply. One is never at a loss to 
understand what he means. There 
is not a dull page in the book. In 
fact, I found it so absorbing that it 
was difficult to attend to anything 
else until I had completed reading 
it. And, indeed, when I came to the 
end I regretted that this quite long 
book was not longer. 

Humankind not only makes de- 
lightful and informative reading, 
it constitutes a liberal education in 
itself. I cannot think of another 
work that comes close to what 
Farb has achieved in this book. Al- 
though this certainly was not his 
purpose, one of the things his book 
should accomplish is to make it 
clear that anthropology, the study 
of humanity, should be at the core 
of every educational curriculum, 
embellished, of course, by the satel- 
lite humanities. Humankind would 
be the ideal text for such a core 
curriculum. 

As Farb puts it, the book repre- 
sents &quot;an attempt to solve some of 
the mystifying unknowns in the hu- 
man equation, to examine the 
axioms and postulates about our 
biology and behavior, and from 
these variables to deduce at least 
some understanding of our past and 
our future.&quot; He begins by placing 
humankind within its proper frame- 
work in our world and discussing

THE 

1978 

IVATURAL 

HISTORY 

PHOTOGRAPHIC 

COMPETITION 



This year, the Grand Prize of Natural History&apos;s photo- 
graphic competition will be two tickets for the American 
Museum of Natural History&apos;s Discovery Tour of Egypt. 
The three-week trip will include a two-day stop in London, 
followed by a leisurely cruise on the Nile from Cairo 
to Aswan, with an optional flight to Abu-Simbel. 

Besides the Grand Prize, the 1978 competition offers cash 
prizes totaling more than $3,000. The winning entries will 
be published in a special double issue of Natural History 
in August and will be exhibited at the American Museum of 
Natural History. 

The four categories for entries are broad enough to fit the 
interests of any photographer. They are: (1) The Natural 
World; (2) A Sequence of an Event in Nature; (3) Photo- 
micrography, including pictures with a scanning electron 
microscope; and (4) The Human Environment. First Prize 
in each category is $500. In addition, all entries are eligible 
for the following awards: Humor in Nature, $200; Urban 
Wildlife, $200; and ten Honorable Mentions at $100 each. 

The deadline is April 15, 1978. Please put your name and 
address on every entry and include a stamped, self-ad- 
dressed envelope — since we do want to return your pictures 
to you. 

To all, the best of luck! 




THE RULES 

1. The competition is open to 
everyone except employees of the 
American Museum of Natural 
History and their kin. 

2. Competitors may submit up to 
three previously unpublished entries 
in each of the four categories. 
Decision of the judges is final. 

3. The Museum acquires the right 
to publish and exhibit the winning 
photographs and to use them for 
promotional purposes. The Museum 
assumes no responsibility for 
other entries. 



4. Entries may be transparencies 
or prints up to 8 by 10 inches, 
and each must bear the photog- 
rapher&apos;s name and address. 

5. Enclose a self-addressed, 
stamped envelope for the return of 
entries.

the importance of the meaning of 
our membership in the order of 
primates for an uncierstanding of 
our rise and development. Here, 
among other things, Farb under- 
scores that humans apparently rep- 
resent the only species that has ever 
been threatened by its own biologi-

it is the retention of that remarkable

the saving hope for our species.

The errors of our younger years are 
drafts upon our older years, payable 
(with interest) some 30 years from 
date. 

The so-called &quot;diseases of old age&quot; 
are essentially the diseases of 50 to 
70 . . . &quot;the dangerous years!&quot; 

Research scientists find that people 
who survive these &quot;dangerous years&quot; 
successfully (without acquiring some 
&quot;chronic&quot; disease such as cancer or 
heart trouble) are likely to live on for 
another healthy quarter of a century. 
They seem to have developed what 
might almost be called an immuniiy 
to these killers. Why? To find out, 
some careful studies have now been 
made of these extraordinarily long- 
lived individuals.

For the fifth year, we invite you to 
witness North America&apos;s greatest wild- 
life spectacle: 

The.Seals, 
on the Icepack 

Each year, in March. In Canada&apos;s Gulf 
of St. Lawrence, hundreijs of thou- 
sands of seals end their southern mi- 
gration and congregate on the ice- 
pack, turning it into a huge natural 
nursery as the females give birth to 
their babies. 

In March 1978, by using reliable heli- 
copters, small groups of tourists will 
again land on the icepack and see 
this dramatic and incredibly beautiful 
sight. 

We are the only company in the world 
with the experience, knowledge and 
audacity to offer these unique, thrill- 
ing and exhilarating tours which are 
arranged with permission of the Gov- 
ernment of Quebec.

mans are not under the control of 
any instincts whatever.&quot; 

Instinct as an explanatory princi- 
ple has served so long to explain so 
many diflFerent forms of behavior 
that it has grown to be uncritically 
accepted as an article of faith. Faith 
is certainty without proof; science 
is proof without certainty. The 
amusing thing about the debate 
over instinct in humans is that it 
could be easily settled, but it hasn&apos;t 
been. One would suppose that one 
could simply cite examples of in- 
stincts in humans and measure 
them by whatever means had been 
agreed upon for their existence or 
nonexistence. 

If one can avoid the semantic 
confusion of such things as 
&quot;drives,&quot; &quot;reflexes,&quot; &quot;predisposi- 
tions,&quot; &quot;needs,&quot; &quot;the innate,&quot; and 
the like, there is some chance that 
one may understand why the so- 
called sex instinct and Lorenz, 
Ardrey and company&apos;s much- 
bruited &quot;instinct of aggression&quot; are 
not instincts at all. As Farb puts it, 
&quot;Humans survive as a result of the 
things they are able to learn, not 
the things they are born with.&quot; 

Both the interest and the value of 
his book would have been height- 
ened had Farb devoted some space 
to a critical discussion of the falla- 
cies involved in the claims usually 
made for the existence of instincts 
in humans. The meaning of a word 
is the action it produces, and in this 
area the divine right of words has 
played a dominant role. Words 
fashion our thoughts, and in this 
way, alas, we become the prisoners 
of other peoples&apos; vocabularies. I 
wish that, in his excellent discus- 
sion of language, Farb had said 
something on this theme. Let us, 
however, be grateful for what he 
has given us in such abundance, for 
his ideas, at least, are never buried 
in thickets of words. 

In his wholly admirable discus- 
sion of the chimera of &quot;race,&quot; Farb 
makes a point that is too frequently 
overlooked, namely, that biological 
and physical diflFerences between 
human populations are often 
equated with imputed, innately de- 
termined psychosocial differences. 
It is the practice of this imputation 
that is the essence of racism. Ra- 
cism, as Oliver Wendell Holmes, 
Sr., said, is like the pupil of the 
human eye: the more light you ex- 
pose it to, the narrower it grows. 
The ringing words of William Lloyd 



Garrison reverberate in the mind. 
&quot;With reasonable men I will reason; 
with humane men 1 will plead; but to 
tyrants 1 will give no quarter, nor 
waste arguments where they will 
certainly be lost.&quot; 

Farb will not be read by bigots, 
racists, or tyrants. His book will be 
read by reasonable and humane 
men and women, for it is a reason- 
able and humane book about hu- 
manity, and it is qualifiedly optimis- 
tic concerning the future of our 
species. My own view is that, in a 
time of crisis, the only philosophi- 
cally tenable position — even for a 
pessimist — is optimism. Farb con- 
cludes that our species has always 
been beset by problems and has 
always produced innovations to 
solve them. And he adds, &quot;No rea- 
son whatever exists for doubting 
that such will continue to be the 
case in the future.&quot; Had he thought 
otherwise, he would not have 
written this book. I, for one, am 
very glad he saw fit to write it.

pologist and social biologist whose 
most recent book is The Nature of 
Human Aggression.

DISTINGUISHED MUSEUM SCIENTISTS AND SCHOLARS. 



THREE EXCITING SPRING TRIPS: 

European 
Waterways Cruise 

May 12-28 

Sheer beauty would be reason 
enough for a tranquil voyage 
aboard a charming ship on the 
Tagus, the Duoro, the Gironde, 
the Dordogne, the Loire and the 
Seine. Especially in the spring, 
when the rivers and their valleys 
are at the loveliest and birdlife 
abundant. 

But the great waterways of Eu- 
rope have muchtotellyou beyond 
esthetics. Dr. Harry L. Shapiro, 
Curator Enneritus of Anthropology 
at the American Museum, will 
discuss how the rivers helped 
shape the cultures of the people 
who settled in Galicia, Basque 
country, Brittany, the wine coun- 
try of the Bordeaux and Loire re- 
gions. And Stuart Keith, Research 
Associate in Ornithology at the 
Museum, (and known as one of 
the most successful birders in the 
world) will lecture and lead spe- 
cial birding expeditions. An ex- 
pert botanist will introduce you 
to the flora of each region — and 
most especially the unique char- 
acteristics of the grapes which 
produce many of the world&apos;s most 
honored wines. 

Wildlife Tour 
to Alaska 

June 20 to July 7 

Which way would you most like 
to see and explore Alaska? With 
j air hops that take you deep into 
! the wilderness for an exciting 
view of the wildlife? With a six- 
day luxury cruise through the 
celebrated Inside Passage, from 
Skagway to Vancouver — with the 



mountains, forests and waterfalls 
along the magnificent coastline 
almost close enough to touch 
from your vantage point on deck? 

On the narrow-guage White 
Pass&amp;Yukon Railroad, up and 
down soaring mountains, execut- 
ing hairpin turns, through a wil- 
derness terrain that has never 
known interference? 

You can do all these and more 
on a remarkable trip to Alaska 
with Kenneth A. Chambers, nat- 
uralist and lecturer at the Ameri- 



seums. On this unusual trip, 40 
participants will have a unique 
opportunity to visit them (along 
with important science and art 
museums, cathedrals and arche- 
ological sites) in the company of 
the American Museum&apos;s Director, 
Dr. Thomas D. Nicholson. In most 
cases, you&apos;ll meet curators and 
tour areas not normally open to 
visitors. And in the evenings, 
you&apos;ll enjoy the operas, concerts 
and dinner receptions of these 
great cities.

(and probably most Alaskans as 
well) have ever been privileged 
to see.

Celestial Events 

Thomas D. Nicholson 

Sun and Moon From the beginning of January until about the 19th, 
the sun moves eastward through the stars of Sagittarius, then enters 
Capricornus. In this part of its easterly journey , the sun moves nearly 
parallel to the equatorial plane; from winter solstice on December 21 
until the end of January, it moves only five degrees northward. But 
because of our time-keeping practices, the time of sunset is affected 
more than that of sunrise. Sunset in late January comes conspicu- 
ously later than at winter&apos;s beginning, but the time of sunrise has 
hardly changed. 

The evening sky (before midnight) will be dark and moonless for 
the first two weeks of January, but from midmonth until the last 
week, the moon will notably brighten the evenings. In particular, 
observe the effect of the full moon on the nights of the 23rd and 24th, 
when its high, long path will light up the long, cold January nights. 
Phases are: last-quarter on January 2, new on the 8th, first-quarter 
on the 15th, full on the 24th, last-quarter again on the 31st. The 
moon in February will be new on the 7th, at first-quarter on the 14th. 

Stars and Planets Three bright planets, all bn the evening Star Map, 
appear prominently among the evening stars this month. Brightest is 
Jupiter, in Gemini, about midway between the twin stars. Castor and 
Pollux, and Aldebaran (in Taurus), low in the east at dusk, high in 
the south before midnight. Mars, now quite bright and reddish in 
color, is to Jupiter&apos;s left, among the dim stars of Cancer. It rises 
approximately at sunset and sets at about sunrise. If you watch care- 
fully from night to night, you will see its rapid retrograde (westward) 
motion through the stars of Cancer. Saturn is to the left of Mars, 
very close to Regulus in Leo (Saturn is the object to the right). It 
rises early at night and is high in the south after midnight. 

January 1: Earth is at perihelion, nearest to the sun for this year. 

January 3: The moderately productive (40 per hour) Quadrantid 
meteor shower will be at maximum this morning. 

January 5: The latest sunrise of the year occurs. 

January 8: The moon is at perigee. The eflFects of perigee and peri- 
helion will enhance the spring tides that coincide with the new moon 
occurring later today. 

January 18: Mars is now nearest the earth. It reaches this position 
once every 26 months, but its distance from earth at such times may 
vary from about 35 to 63 million miles because Mars can be at any 
location in its eliptical orbit. 

January 20: Saturn is nearest Regulus today (in conjunction) and 
moves slowly oflF to its right (west). The moon is at apogee. 

January 21: Mars is at opposition from the sun; Venus is in 
superior conjunction with the sun. Technically, Mars now rises at 
sunset and sets at sunrise; Venus rises and sets with the sun; and 
both become evening stars. 

January 23: Mars is near the moon tonight. 

January 25-26: Saturn is near the moon on these evenings. 

February 5: The moon is at perigee. 

February 15: The moon is very close to Aldebaran tonight. At 
about 9:00 p.m., EST, it is so close that it covers the star (an occulta- 
tion) for observers in parts of North America and Europe. Saturn is 
at opposition from the sun tonight and becomes an evening star. 

* Hold the Star Map so the compass direction you face is at the bottom; then match 
the stars in the lower half of the map with those in the sky near the horizon. The 
map is for 11:15 P.M. on January 1; 10:15 p.m. on January 15; 9:15 P.M. on January 
31; and 8:15 p.m. on February 15; but it can also be used for an hour before and 
after those times.

Tovil Dance (p. 42) 

Richard F. Gombrich&apos;s Precept 
and Practice: Traditional Bud- 
dhism in the Rural Highlands of 
Ceylon (New York: Oxford Univer- 
sity Press, 1971) places the tovil 
ceremonies in their Buddhist con- 
text, explaining the relationship be- 
tween culture and religion. The 
same approach is taken on a more 
general level by David G. Mandel- 
baum in &quot;Transcendental and Prag- 
matic Aspects of Religion,&quot; Ameri- 
can Anthropologist, vol. 68 (1966), 
pp. 1174-91. For the Sinhalese, 
Michael M. Ames describes the 
combination of religious and medi- 
cal therapy in &quot;Magical-Animism 
and Buddhism: A Structural Analy- 
sis of the Sinhalese Religious Sys- 
tem,&quot; Journal of Asian Studies, 
vol. 23 (1964), special issue, pp. 
21-52, and in &quot;Buddha and the 
Dancing Goblins: A Theory of 
Magic and Religion,&quot; American 
Anthropologist, vol. 64 (1964), pp. 
75-82. 

Gananath Obeyesekere has stud- 
ied Sinhalese rituals closely for 
many years. Two of his more im- 
portant contributions are &quot;The 
Buddhist Pantheon in Ceylon and 
Its Extensions,&quot; Yale University, 
Southeast Asia Studies, Cultural 
Reports Series, no. 13 (1966), pp. 
1-26, and &quot;The Ritual Drama of the 
Sanni Demons: Collective Repre- 
sentations of Disease in Ceylon,&quot; 
Comparative Studies in Society 
and History vol. 11, no. 2 (1969), 
pp. 174-216. Paul Wirz&apos;s Exorcism 
in the Art of Healing in Ceylon 
(Leiden: E.J. Brill Publications, 
1954) contains descriptive details of 
the tovil ceremonies. Beryl De 
Zoete also describes the cere- 
monies in Dance and Magic Drama 
in Ceylon (New York: Theatre Arts 
Books, 1958; $4.50). 

Nubian Ibex (p. 50) 

The Mammals IV volume of 
Grzimek&apos;s Animal Life Encyclope- 
dia, edited by Bernhard Grzimek, 
gives information about the diflFer- 
ent varieties of ibex. The English- 
language edition of this work was 
published by Van Nostrand Rein-

1972. Hoofed Mammals of the 
World, coauthored by artist Ugo

Mochi and scientist T. Donald Car- 
ter (New York: Charles Scribner&apos;s 
Sons, 1971) contains more basic 
information and shadow drawings 
for each species described. 

In &quot;The Behavior of Ungulates 
and Its Relation to Management,&quot; 
(pp. 324-40 of lUCN New Series 
Publication No. 24, 1971) Bernard 
Nievergelt compares rutting behav- 
ior and grouping in the Ethiopian 
and Alpine ibex. This lUCN publi- 
cation is a result of an international 
symposium held in Calgary. Verna 
Mays gives a short history of the 
renewal of the depleted ibex popula- 
tions of Europe in &apos; &apos; With a Little Bit 
of Luck&quot; in International Wildlife, 
1973, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 28-31. 

Parthenogenetic Lizards (p. 56) 

Various modes of reproduction 
are discussed in Intersexuality in 
the Animal Kingdom (New York: 
Springer- Verlag, 1975), edited by 
Rudolf Reinboth. This collection 
of articles, which resulted from a 
symposium held in Mainz in 1974, 
includes chapters on invertebrates, 
fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, 
and mammals; in the section on 
reptiles, Charles J. Cole reviews 
current knowledge of all known 
species. The book has extensive 
bibliographies and illustrations. 

Much of the recent work on par- 
thenogenesis in lizards has not yet 
filtered into the popular literature. 
For the reader who has access to a 
larger library or who wishes to ob- 
tain interlibrary loans, the follow- 
ing important contributions are 
listed. The question of natural par- 
thenogenesis in lizards was first 
raised by Ilya S. Darevsky, whose 
early work on Armenian lizards is 
summarized in a 1966 article, &quot;Nat- 
ural Parthenogenesis in a Polymor- 
phic Group of Caucasian Rock 
Lizards Related to Lacerta saxicola 
Eversmann&quot; (Journal of the Ohio 
Herpetological Society, vol. 5, no. 
4, pp. 115-52). Thomas Uzzell and 
Darevsky have more recently 
(1975) presented &quot;Biochemical Evi- 
dence for the Hybrid Origin of the 
Parthenogenetic Species of the 
Lacerta saxicola Complex (Sauria: 
Lacertidae), with a Discussion of 
Some Ecological and Evolutionary 
Implications&quot; (Copeia. no. 2, pp. 



204-22). J.W. Wright and C.H. 
Lowe hypothesize the hybrid origin 
of parthenogenetic species of 
American lizards in &quot;Weeds, Poly- 
ploids, Parthenogenesis, and the 
Geographical and Ecological Distri- 
bution of All-Female Species of 
Cnemidophorus&quot; {Copeia, no. 1, 
pp. 128-38). Robert L. Bezy discus- 
ses the origin of parthenogenesis in 
the absence of hybridization in 
&quot;Karyotypic Variation and Evolu- 
tion of the Lizards in the Family 
Xantusiidae,&quot; Natural History 
Museum of Los Angeles County 
Contributions in Science, no. 227 
(1972), pp. 1-29. 

Crickets (p. 64) 

Richard Dawkins, an ethological 
theoretician at Oxford University, 
presents a new perspective on evo- 
lutionary biology in The Selfish 
Gene (New York: Oxford Univer- 
sity Press, 1976). Dawkins contends 
that the gene, rather than the spe- 
cies, is the principal factor in natu- 
ral selection. One of the chapters in 
Howard E. Evans&apos;s Life on a Little- 
Known Planet (New York: Dell 
Publishing Co., 1968, $2.45 in 
paperback) is entitled, &quot;The 
Cricket as Poet and Pugilist.&quot; In 
entertaining form, Evans runs down 
the history of cricket study, includ- 
ing a summary of the literature on 
singing and sexual behavior.

Montague have edited a collection

American culture. This $5.95 vol-

Museum visitors can get a close- 
up look at the Small Animals of 
IVinidad on February 1, at 8:00 
P.M., when Ray Mendez, of the 
Museum&apos;s Exhibition Department, 
will present a slide lecture in the 
auditorium on some of the mam- 
mals, reptiles, amphibians, and 
arthropods that frequent the is- 
land&apos;s Arima Valley. Entomologist- 
photographer-artist Ray Mendez, 
has made five trips to Trinidad, 
where he has studied and photo- 
graphed such bizarre subjects as a 
fungus that envelops spiders; taran- 
tulas that live in twenty-foot-high 
piles of bat guano; hundreds of 
thousands of bats pouring out of a 
cave at dusk; army ants; and the 
world&apos;s smallest snakes, which live 
in huge termite nests. The event 
will begin with a brief discussion of 
Trinidad&apos;s ecology and end with a 
question and answer session. 

Tickets for associate members 
and the public are $2.00 and will be 
available at the auditorium door 
half an hour before the program be- 
gins. Participating and donor mem- 
bers will be admitted free. 

More than eighteen Hayden 
Planetarium Courses will be offered 
beginning in January. Included will 
be &quot;Stars, Constellations and Leg- 
ends,&quot; on the lore of the sky; 
&quot;Science and Science Fiction&quot;; 
&quot;Going Metric&quot;; &quot;Ground School

Nature doesn&apos;t explore just one path to reach a goal. 

Neither should man. 



For a green plant to survive, 
it must reach sunlight. So nature 
provides that if the plant&apos;s growth 
is blocked in one direction, it can 
grow in another. 

Man can learn from nature. 

For us to survive, we must 
have energy. And companies like 
Conoco are exploring for many 
different kinds. 

For instance, uranium and 



petroleum are often found in 
the same kinds of geological 
formations. And Conoco hunts 
for these formations from 
specially-equipped airplanes 
that take photographs and 
electronic readings of the land 
below. 

So as we look tor one resource, 
we may find clues to another. 
And we know how to get these 



resources out of the ground 
while respecting the natural 
environment. 

Conoco&apos;s 44,000 people are 
exploring many paths to the 
goal of enough energy for 
everyone.

All expensive, imported auto- 
mobiles feature an impressive list 
of sophisticated mechanical refine- 
ments. 

Most have some sort of inde- 
pendent suspension system. Most 
have fuel-injected engines. 

All are designed with more 
than a perfunctory nod to aerody- 
namics and functionality. 

Yet, write the editors of Motor 
Trend magazine, &quot;. . .once a knowl- 
edgeable and experienced driver 
has driven a BMW, any BMW, noth- 
ing else feels quite as good as it 
did before.&quot; 

The explanation? Quite simple. 

The BMW 320i is far more 
than a collection of gears and axles 
and random parts. 

It IS a finely tuned, evolution- 
ary machine. A practical sedan 
built by racing engineers and per- 

■Ci 1977 BMWol Norm America. Inc 



fected in places like Le Mans, Monte 
Carlo and the Nurburgring, where 
precision is crucial and agility and 
durability are more than just matters 
of theoretical speculation. 
PFRFECTED ON 
THF RACF TRACK. NOT MERELY 
THE TEST TRACK . 

While It IS, of course, feasible 
to develop an acceptable automo- 
bile in the relative vacuum of the 
test track and the laboratory, it is 
virtually impossible to simulate the 
perfection demanded by motor 
racing. 

When you press the 320i accel- 
erator, the two-liter, K-Jetronic, fuel- 
injected engine— the same basic 
engine that powers a majonty of the 
world&apos;s Formula Two race cars- 
responds without lag. 

Its suspension, independent 
on all four wheels— with McPher- 



son struts and coil springs in front, 
semi-trailing arms and coil spnngs 
in the rear— IS quick and clean 
through the corners. 

Its rack and pinion steenng is 
sharp and accurate. 

&quot;All told,&quot; say the editors of 
Car and Dnver magazine, &quot;the 
320i stands as eloquent rebuttal 
to all those who&apos;d have us believe 
that small economical cars must 
be dull-and that automotive per- 
formance for the late 1970&apos;s is 
best achieved with decals...&quot;

William H. Drury is studying the 
ecology of marine birds in the Ber- 
ing Sea as part of a National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis- 
tration (NOAA) project to assess 
the impact of oil drilling in the re- 
gion. Drury, who teaches ecology 
at the College of the Atlantic in 
Maine, has long been interested in 
biogeography. While formerly serv- 
ing as director of research for the 
Massachusetts Audubon Society, 
he made a ten-year study of tern 
and herring gull populations and 
movements along the New England 
coast. His future plans include re- 
search on the flora and fauna of 
Maine islands, on one of which he 
owns some land. 





An assistant professor of geology 
and mineralogy at the University of 
New Mexico in Albuquerque, Rod- 
ney C. Ewing&apos;s main diversion is 
&quot;walking in the mountains with a 
recalcitrant dog named Kimo.&quot; 
The subject of symmetry first drew 
his attention in an undergraduate 
course in mineralogy. A subsequent 
honors seminar, in which both sci- 
entists and artists discussed their 
respective concepts of symmetry, 



further buttressed his interest. 
Ewing&apos;s current research involves, 
among other projects, a study of 
natural minerals that have suffered 
radiation damage from constituent 
uranium and thorium atoms. Al- 
though this is an esoteric subject, 
Ewing says it provides &quot;very use- 
ful information in the evaluation of 
the long-term stability of material 
used for radioactive waste dis- 
posal.&quot; 




Asen Balikci, professor of an- 
thropology at the University of 
Montreal, was studying pastoral 
nomads in northern Afghanistan 
when he first saw buzkashi games. 
He subsequently filmed them as 
part of an anthropological series on 
social life in the Narin-Burka area. 
Besides previous fieldwork in 
Afghanistan and Ethiopia, Balikci 
has supervised the making of a 
nine-film series about the Netsilik 
Eskimo, seal hunters who live 
along the Canadian Arctic coast 
northwest of Hudson Bay. Balikci 
presented three films from that se- 
ries at the American Museum of 
Natural History in February 1976.

My photographs . . . 

lifers moments held suspended in time. 



Special moments in life mean so 
much. You&apos;re sure you could 
never forget them. But, time moves 
inexorably forward, and even the 
most precious of moments fade 
into distant memories. Only 
photographs can keep them alive. 

That&apos;s why photography has 
become so important to me. It lets 
me reach into the past and see it 
as it really was. It helps me 
preserve the present, which too 
soon becomes the past. But more 
important, I can capture the 
future , fidl of its surprises. Truly 
memorable photographs are 
simply beyond the capabilities of 
an ordinary camera. 

I wanted a camera versatile 
enough for all those moments, 
built to last a lifetime and 
dependable enough never to let 
me down. I chose Nikon -the 
camera the pros depend on. I 
already knew Nikon was the best 
35mm camera made, and when 
my dealer showed me the new, 
compact Nikon FM and how 
simple it was to operate, I knew it 
was the camera for me. And how 
right I was! My very first roll 
gave me sharp, perfectly 
exposed, color pictures. 

Surprisingly, the Nikon FM 
costs very little more titan an 
ordinary 35mm single lens reflex 
camera, yet it has all the feel and 
quality so traditional of Nikon. 
And, with all the interchangeable 
lenses and accessories that 
Nikon makes, there is just no limit 
to what I can do with my 
photography. 

For details on I tie Nikon FM as well as a 
schedule for the traveling Nikon School 
of Photography, check your local Yellow 
Pages for ihe Nikon dealer nearest you.

Born and raised in Nebraska, 
Marilyn Coffey, decided to write a 
memoir of the Great Plains — its 
land and its people. The dust 
storms of the thirties were one of 
the legends of her childhood and 
the severity of the weather in the 
Midwest left a deep impression on 
her. Coffey, who graduated from 
the University of Nebraska with a 
bachelor&apos;s in journalism, recently 



received the Master Alumnus 
award for distinguished achieve- 
ment in her field. &quot;Badlands Re- 
visited,&quot; a previous essay from her 
Plains memoir, was published in 
the Atlantic Monthly. December 
1974. Coffey is an assistant profes- 
sor of English at Pratt Institute 
in Brooklyn, where she has just 
moved to a house with — at last — a 
garret to write in. 




A postdoctoral fellow at the 
Scripps Institute of Oceanography, 
Ronald E. Thresher is conducting 
surveys of reef fishes in the Gulf 
of California. The data he is col- 
lecting is being added to a long- 
term comparative study of Carib- 
bean and eastern Pacific reef fishes. 



The focus of this work is the role 
of color patterns in social behavior. 
During his underwater explora- 
tions, Thresher also examines thf

spacing and behavior of the blenny 
In his spare time, he is a free-lancf&apos;

liantly revealed. And they permit you to view 
each priceless painting on your home screen in 
the full glory of the original.

This View of Life 



by Stephen Jay Gould 



An Early Start 



Shortly after the dawn 
of earth, life arose 
with vim and vigor 

Pooh-Bah, the Lord High Every- 
thing Else of Titipu, boasted a 
family pride so strong as to be 
&quot;something inconceivable.&quot; &quot;You 
will understand this,&quot; he said to 
Nanki-Poo in suggesting that a 
bribe would be both appropriate 
and expensive, &quot;when I tell you 
that I can trace my ancestry back 
to a protoplasmal primordial atomic 
globule.&quot; 

If human pride is nurtured by 
such vastly extended roots, then 
the end of 1977 was a bounteous 
period for self-esteem. Early in 
November, an announcement of 
the discovery of some fossil pro- 
karyotes from South Africa pushed 
the antiquity of life back to 3.4 bil- 
lion years. (Prokaryotes, including 
bacteria and blue-green algae, form 
the kingdom Monera. Their cells 
contain no organelles — no nucleus, 
no mitochondria — and they are re- 
garded as the simplest forms of life 
on earth.) Two weeks later, a re- 
search team from the University of 
Illinois announced that the so- 
called methane-producing bacteria 
are not closely related to other 
monerans after all, but form a sep- 
arate kingdom of their own. 

If true monerans were alive 3.4 
million years ago, then the common 
ancestor of monerans and these 
newly christened &quot;methanogens&quot; 
must be considerably more ancient. 
Since the oldest dated rocks, the 
Isua Supracrustals of West Green- 
land, are 3.8 billion years old, we 
are left with very little time be- 
tween the development of suitable 
conditions for life on the earth&apos;s 
surface and the origin of life. Life 
is not a complex accident that re- 
quired immense time to convert the 
vastly improbable into the nearly 
certain. Instead, life, for all its in- 
tricacy, probably arose rapidly 
about as soon as it could; perhaps 
it was as inevitable as quartz or 
feldspar. (The earth is some 41/2 



10 



billion years old, but it first passed 
through a molten or near-molten 
Stage and probably did not form a 
solid crust much before the deposi- 
tion of the West Greenland se- 
quence.) No wonder these stories 
hit the front page of the New York 
Times, and even inspired an edi- 
torial for Veterans&apos; Day musings. 

Twenty years ago, I spent a sum- 
mer at the University of Colorado, 
fortifying myself for the transition 
from high school to college. Amidst 
the various joys of snowcapped 
peaks and sore bottoms from trying 
to &quot;set a trot,&quot; I well remember 
the highlight of my stay — George 
Wald&apos;s lecture on the &quot;Origin of 
Life.&quot; He presented with infectious 
charm and enthusiasm the perspec- 
tive that developed in the early 
1950s and reigned as an orthodoxy 
until very recently — in fact, until 
last month for people who rely on 
published reports and do not have 
access to the &quot;invisible college&quot; of 
primary researchers. (Here I am 
fortunate, for a major center of the 
&quot;college&quot; lies a hundred feet from 
my office, and several of its out- 
standiiig occupants are friends and 
colleagues.) 

In Wald&apos;s view, the spontaneous 
origin of life was a virtually in- 
evitable consequence of the earth&apos;s 
atmosphere and crust, and of its 
favorable size and position in the 
solar system. Still, life is so stagger- 
ingly complex that its origin from 
simple chemicals must have con- 
sumed an immense amount of time 
— probably more time than its 
entire subsequent evolution from 
DNA molecule to advanced beetles 
(or whatever you choose to place 
atop the subjective ladder). Thou- 
sands of steps, each requiring the 
one before; each improbable in it- 
self. Only the immensity of time 
guaranteed the result, for time con- 
verts the improbable to the in- 
evitable — give me a million years 
and I&apos;ll flip a hundred heads in a 
row more than once. Wald wrote 
in 1954: &quot;Time is in fact the hero of 
the plot. The time with which we 



have to deal is the order of two bil- 
lion years. . . . Given so much time, 
the &apos;impossible&apos; becomes possible, 
the possible probable, and the 
probable virtually certain. One has 
only to wait: time itself performs 
the miracles.&quot; 

This orthodox view congealed 
without the benefit of any direct 
data from paleontology to test it, 
for the paucity of fossils before the 
great Cambrian &quot;explosion&quot; 600 
million years ago is, perhaps, the 
outstanding fact and frustration of 
my profession (and the subject of 
several past columns). In fact, the 
first unambiguous evidence of Pre- 
cambrian life appeared in the same 
year that Wald theorized about its 
origin. Harvard paleobotanist Else 
Barghoorn and Wisconsin geol- 
ogist S. A. Tyler described a series 
of prokaryotic organisms from 
cherts of the Gunflint Formation, 
rocks nearly 2 billion years old 
from the northern shore of Lake 
Superior. Still, the gap between the 
Gunflint and the earth&apos;s origin 
spanned ZVi billion years, more 
than enough time for Wald&apos;s slow 
and steady construction. 

But our view of life continued tc 
move backward. Laminated carbo 
nate deposits, known as stromato; 
lites, had been known for some 
time from rocks of the Bulawayai 
Series, 2.6 to 2.8 billion years old 
in Southern Rhodesia. The lamina 
tions resemble patterns formed b; 
modern blue-green algal mats tha 
trap and bind sediment. With fossi 
microorganisms clearly present i 
the Gunflint, the organic interpre 
tation of stromatolites won man 
adherents. Then, ten years ago i 
1967, Barghoorn and J. W. Schof 
reported &quot;algalike&quot; and &quot;bactfi 
riumlike&quot; organisms from the Fi 
Tree Series of South Africa. Nov 
the orthodox idea of slow construe 
tion over most of the earth&apos;s histor 
began to crumble for the Fig Tre 
rocks, based on dates available i 
1967, seemed to be more than 3 
billion years old. Schopf and Bar; 
hoom dignified their discoveris

COME SEE THE STATE 

THAT KEPT THE 

WORLD&apos;S SECOND 

OLDEST RIVER 

FROM DYING OF 

UNNATURAL CAUSES. 

Its name, ironically is the New 
River. It is 500 million years old. 

Older than the first, tentative 
fishes. Older than the trees. 

And, not long ago, it almost 
went the way of the dinosaurs. 

Except for North Carolina, the 
prehistoric river would be just 
another man-made lake by now 

But today it flows, unchanged, 
through gentle hills and fertile 
valleys. As a part of the National 
Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 

North Carolina, you 11 begin to 
notice from the moment you 
cross its borders, is a state that tal&lt;es 
nature seriously 

You can walk in vast mountain 
forests that have barely changed 
since the coming of man. 

You can stroll beaches where 
only the crabs and waterfowl are 
permitted to take up residence. 

From the Creat Smokies to the Outer Banks, national and state parks anc 
forestlands cover not just hundreds of square miles, but thousands. 

You can camp beside a waterfall, catch your breakfast in a clear mountair 
stream, and never see a sign of civilization.You can &apos;^ looking for seashells 
without having to look at high-rise condominiums. You can run the rapid.&apos; 




Get soaked to the skin. Go to places you&apos;d never see from the window of a car 
Do things you&apos;ve never done, just because you&apos;ve never done them. 

So come. Enjoy But do us one favor, please.Try to leave North Carolina 
the way you found it.Because that&apos;s exactly what we&apos;re trying to do.

with formal Latin names, but their 
own characterizations — algaiike 
and bacteriumlike — reflected their 
doubts. In fact, Schopf later de- 
cided that the balance of evidence 
stood against the biological nature 
of these structures. 

In this context, the recent an- 
nouncement of 3.4-billion-year-old 
life is not a startlingly new dis- 
covery but a satisfactory culmina- 
tion of a decade&apos;s debate about the 
status of life in the Fig Tree. The 
new evidence, discovered by 
Andrew H. Knoll and Barghoorn, 
also comes from cherts of the Fig 
Tree Series. But now the evidence 
is close to conclusive; moreover, 
recent dates indicate a greater age 
of 3.4 billion years for the series. 
The Fig Tree cherts may be the 
oldest appropriate rocks on earth 
for the discovery of ancient life. 
The older Greenland rocks have 
been too altered by heat and pres- 
sure to preserve any organic re- 
mains. Knoll tells me that some un- 
studied cherts in Rhodesia may 
range back to 3.6 billion years, but 
anxious scientists will have to await 
a political denouement before their 
arcane concerns attract sympathy 
or safety. Still, the notion that life 
has been found in the oldest rocks 
that could contain evidence of it 
forces us, I think, to abandon the 
view of life&apos;s slow, steady, and im- 
probable development. Life arose 
rapidly, perhaps as soon as the 
earth cooled down sufficiently to 
support it. 

The new evidence from the Fig 
Tree Series consists primarily of 
algalike microstructures far more 
convincing than the previous dis- |i 
coveries. &quot;In younger rocks [they] 
would without hesitation be called |i 
algal microfossils,&quot; Knoll and 
Barghoorn claim. This interpreta- 
tion rests upon five arguments: I 

1. The new structures are within 
the size range of modern prokar- 
yotes. The earlier structures de- 
scribed by Schopf and Barghoorn 
were disturbingly large; Schoplj 
later rejected them as biological 
primarily on the basis of their largs 
size. 

2. Populations of modern pro- 
karyotes have a characteristic dis- 
tribution of size. They can bt 
arranged in a typical bell-shapec 
curve, with the average diametei 
most frequent and a continual de 
crease in numbers as we move tc

His destiny was to 
die in poverty and 
disappointment. 

Yet iiis genius 
gave tiie world 
some of tiie most 
beautiful music 
ever heard. 

At the age of 6, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was 
the talk of Europe. By the time he was 8, he had sat on 
the knee of Empress Maria Theresa, delighted the 
court of George III, and composed four sonatas. 

Fame came early but fortune always eluded him— 
and when he died of kidney disease at 35, he was 
destitute and had to be buried in a pauper&apos;s grave. 

Yet he left the fickle world an astonishing body of 
music, ranging, like his life, from lighthearted frolics 
to epic tragedy... as you will discover in TIME-LIFE&apos;s 
magnificent boxed set on Mozart— the first in a book 
and record series called GREAT MEN OF MUSIC. 

Here is a &quot;connoisseur&apos;s choice&quot; of Mozart&apos;s 
creations, recorded in finest stereo sound by artists 
who have no peer. You&apos;ll hear Leontyne Price singing 
from The Magic Flute... Van Cliburn&apos;s rendition of 
Piano Sonatas Nos. 1 in C and 11 in A . . . Heifetz&apos;s 
interpretation of Violin Concerto No. 4 in D... Benny 
Goodman playing Clarinet Concerto in A. .. 

The boxed set on Mozart is only the beginning of 
GREAT MEN OF MUSIC-an unparalleled collection 
of the world&apos;s greatest music, performed by leading 
artists of our time. In future sets, you will thrill to the 
genius of Bach, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Brahms, 
Debussy, Mahler. . . more than 20 composers in all. 

And you&apos;ll listen with new understanding as well as 
enjoyment. Because each set is enriched with a color- 
filled booklet on the composer&apos;s life and times, plus 
program notes that tell you exactly what to listen for. 

Start by auditioning Mozart for 10 days free. You&apos;ll 
receive four 12-inch LP stereo records (the kind which 
usually retail for $6.98 each) in an elegant slipcase, the 
background booklet complete with Listener&apos;s Guide, 
AND the valuable deluxe edition of The Golden 
Encyclopedia ot Music— yours tree just for purchasing 
Mozart and agreeing to examine future sets. 

If after ten days you decide you&apos;d like to own this 
$45.87 value, it&apos;s yours for only $17.95, plus shipping and 
handling. If however, you are not completely delighted, 
return the album and encyclopedia and owe nothing. 
Send no money. Just mail the attached card. Or write

larger or smaller sizes. Thus, pro- 
karyotic populations not only have 
a diagnostic average size (point 1 
above), they also have a character- 
istic pattern of variation about this 
average. The new microfossils form 
a beautiful bell-shaped distribution 
with limited spread (range from 1 to 
4 micrometers). The previous, 
larger structures had great variation 
and no strong mean. 

3. The new structures are &quot;vari- 
ously elongated, flattened, wrin- 
kled, or folded&quot; in a manner strik- 
ingly similar to Gunflint and later 
Precambrian prokaryotes. Such 
shapes are characteristic of post- 
mortem degradation in modem 
prokaryotes. The larger, earlier 
structures were distressingly spher- 
ical; spheres, as a standard con- 
figuration of minimal surface area, 
can be easily produced by a host 
of inorganic processes — consider 
bubbles. 

4. Most convincingly, about one 
quarter of the new microfossils 
have been found in various stages 
of cell division. Lest such a pro- 
portion caught in flagrante delicto 
sems unreasonably high, I point out 
that prokaryotes can divide every 
twenty minutes or so and take sev- 
eral minutes to complete the pro- 
cess. A single cell might well spend 
one-fourth of its life making two 
daughters. 

5. These four arguments based 
on morphology are persuasive 
enough for me, but Knoll and 
Barghoorn add some biochemical 
evidence as well. Atoms of a single 
element often exist in several alter- 
nate forms of different weight. 
These forms, called isotopes, have 
the same number of protons but 
diiFerent numbers of neutrons. 
Some isotopes are radioactive and 
break down spontaneously to other 
elements; others are stable and per- 
sist unchanged throughout geologic 
time. Carbon has two major stable 
isotopes, C&apos;^ with 6 protons and 
6 neutrons, and C&apos;^ with 6 protons 
and 7 neutrons. When organisms 
fix carbon in photosynthesis, they 
use preferentially the lighter iso- 
tope C&apos;^ Hence, the C&apos;-/C&quot; ratio 
of carbon fixed by photosynthesis 
is higher than the ratio in inorganic 
carbon (in a diamond, for example). 
Moreover, since both isotopes are 
stable, their ratio will not alter 
through time. The C&apos;VC&apos;^ ratios for 
Fig Tree carbon are too high for an 
inorganic origin; they are in the

thesis. This, in itself, would not 
establish the case for life in the Fig 
Tree; light carbon can be fixed pref- 
erentially in other ways. But taken 
with the evidence of size, distribu- 
tion, shape, and cellular division, 
this additional support from bio-

case.

known on earth, so for now we can 
proceed no further from the direct 
evidence of fossils. We turn instead 
to the second front-page item, the 
claim of Carl Woese and his asso- 
ciates that methanogens are not 
bacteria at all but may represent a 
new kingdom of prokaryotic life, 
distinct from the Monera (bacteria 
and blue-green algae). Their report 
has been widely distorted, most 
notably in the New York Times 
editorial of November 11, 1977. 
The Times proclaimed that the 
great dichotomy of plants and ani- 
mals had finally been broken: 
&quot;Every child learns about things 
being vegetable or animal — a divi- 
sion as universal as the partition of 
mammals into male and female. 
Yet . . . [we now have] a &apos;third 
kingdom&apos; of life on earth, orga- 
nisms that are neither animal nor 
vegetable, but of another category 
altogether.&quot; Actually, biologists 
abandoned &quot;the great dichotomy&quot; 
long ago. Most popular these days 
is a system of five kingdoms (see 
my column of June-July 1976): 
plants, animals, fungi, protists 
(single-celled eukaryotes, including 
amoebas and paramecia, with nu- 
cleus, mitochondria, and other 
organelles), and the prokaryotic 
monerans. If methanogens are pro- 
moted, they will form a sixth king- 
dom, joining the monerans in a 
superkingdom, Prokaryota. Most 
biologists regard the division be- 
tween prokaryotes and eukaryotes, 
not between plants and animals, as 
the fundamental partition of life. 

Woese&apos;s research group reported 
their findings in the October 1977 
issue of the Proceedings of the Na- 
tional Academy of Sciences, in an 
article by George E. Fox and four 
other authors, including Woese. 
They isolated a common RNA from 



ten methanogens and from three 
monerans for comparison (DNA 
makes RNA, and RNA serves as 
the template upon which proteins 
are synthesized). A single strand of 
RNA, like DNA, consists of a se- 
quence of nucleotides. Any one of 
four nucleotides can occupy each 
position, and each group of three 
nucleotides specifies an amino 
acid; proteins are built of amino 
acids arranged in folded chains. 
This, in a compressed phrase, is 
the &quot;genetic code.&quot; Biochemists 
can now &quot;sequence&quot; RNA, that is, 
they can read the entire sequence 
of nucleotides in order down the 
RNA strand. 

The prokaryotes (methanogens, 
bacteria, and blue-green algae) 
must have had a common ancestor 
at some time near the origin of life. 
Thus, all prokaryotes had the same 
RNA sequence at one point in their 
past; any current differences arose 
by divergence from this common 
ancestor. If molecular evolution 
proceeded at a constant rate, then 
the amount of diflFerence now exist- 
ing between any two forms would 
directly reflect the amount of time 
since the two had a common ances- 
tor, that is, the last time they had 
the same RNA sequence. Perhaps, 
for example, a diflFerent nucleotide 
in the two forms at 10 percent of 
all common positions would indi- 
cate a time of divergence a billion 
years ago; 20 percent, two billion 
years, and so on. 

Woese and his group measured 
the percent difference for all pairs 
of species among the ten methano- 
gens and three monerans and used 
the results to construct a hypothet- 
ical evolutionary tree. This tree 
contains two major limbs — all the 
methanogens on one, all the mon- 
erans on the other. They chose 
three monerans to represent the 
greatest differences within the 
group — enteric (gut) bacteria ver- 
sus free-living blue-green algae, 
for example. Nonetheless, all the 
monerans are more similar to each 
other in RNA sequence than any 
moneran is to any methanogen. 

The simplest interpretation of 
these results holds that methano- 
gens and monerans are separate 
evolutionary groups, with a com- 
mon ancestry preceding the ap- 
pearance of either. (Previously, 
methanogens had been classified 
among the bacteria.) This interpre- 
tation underlies Woese&apos;s claim that 



methanogens are separate from 
monerans and should be recog- 
nized as a sixth kingdom. Since 
good monerans had already evolved 
by Fig Tree times, 3.4 billion or 
more years ago, the common an- 
cestry of methanogens and moner- 
ans must have been even earlier, 
thus pushing the origin of life even 
further back toward the beginning 
of the earth itself. 

This simple interpretation, as 
Woese and his group realize, is 
not the only possible reading of 
their results. We may propose two 
other perfectly plausible hypoth- 
eses: 1. The three monerans that 
they used may not represent the 
entire group very well. Perhaps the 
RNA sequences of other monerans 
will differ as much from the first 
three as all the methanogens do. 
Then we would have to include the 
methanogens with all monerans in 
a single grand group. And 2. The 
assumption of nearly constant evo- 
lutionary rates may not hold. Per- 
haps the methanogens split off 
from one branch of monerans long 
after the main groups of mon- 
erans had branched from their 
common ancestor. These early 
methanogens may have evolved at 
a faster rate than the moneran 
groups diverged from each other. 
In this case, the great difference 
in RNA sequence between any 
methanogen and any moneran 
would record a rapid evolutionary 
rate for early methanogens, not a 
common ancestry with monerans 
before the monerans themselves 
split into subgroups. The gross 
amount of biochemical difference 
reflects the time of divergence only 
if evolution proceeds at reasonably 
constant biochemical rates. 

But one other observation makes 
Woese&apos;s hypothesis very attractive 
and inspires my own strong rooting 
for it. The methanogens are an- 
aerobic; they die in the presence of 
oxygen. Hence, they are confined 
today to unusual environments: 
muds at the bottom of ponds de- 
pleted of oxygen or deep hot 
springs in Yellowstone Park, for 
example. (The methanogens grow 
by oxidizing hydrogen and reduc- 
ing carbon dioxide to methane — 
hence their name.) Now, amidst all 
the disagreement that afflicts the 
study of our early earth and its 
atmosphere, one point has gained 
general assent: our original atmos- 
phere was devoid of oxygen and

On Photographing the Invisible 



To the naked eye, it was a Swedish 
80-ore postage stamp. A rarity, and 
very valuable. 

The camera, however, told quite 
another story. The stamp was a coun- 
terfeit. 

Faint traces of tampering that were 
hidden to the naked eye were revealed 
by the camera. Someone, somewhere, 
had ingeniously altered the stamp by 
chemically removing a surprint. The 
stamp was worthless. 




To the naked eye (left), the 
stamp was genuine. To the cam- 
era (right), it was a counterfeit, 
hlote the faint, dark traces of 
tampering now revealed in the 
upper section. 



What manner of exotic camera 
was this that could &quot;see&quot; the invisible? 

The lens: one of the 20 in the 
Hasselblad arsenal, the 105mm Zeiss 
UV-Sonnar f4.3. Designed for pho- 
tography within the ultraviolet portion 
of the electromagnetic spectrum, its 
costly quartz elements can detect 
radiations that are unseeable by the 
human eye. 

It has peered at objects in outer 
space, examined forgeries, laid bare 
the secrets of counterfeit money. Not 
a lens for everyone, obviously, but an 
i ndication of j ust how awesomely com- 
prehensive the Hasselblad System is. 

The camera: an otherwise per- 
fectly standard Hasselblad 500C/M, 



normally fitted with an 80mm Zeiss 
Planar f2.8 multi-coated lens. 

This is the basic model that allows 
you to tap into the vast Hasselblad 
System. It is one of the most bewilder- 
ingly versatile cameras the world has 
ever known. Yet so marvelously simple 
to operate that it often plays the part 
of the family snapshot camera. 

A True System. 

The Hasselblad System is a prodigious 
array of 4 cameras, 20 lenses, 8 view- 
finders, 9 film magazines, and over 
300 other accessories. Choose the right 
pieces, and your 500CA4 would be 
equipped for sports, aerial, architec- 
tural, and fashion photography 

And portrait, landscape, medical, 
underwater, and news photography. 

And wildlife, laboratory, indus- 
trial, and child photography. 

And you would always have the 
right film in the camera at the right 
time. You can shift from color to 
black-and-white and back again to 
color — and resume shooting at pre- 
cisely the right frame— by popping in 
the protective dark slide and switch- 
ing film backs. 

The Camera with Nine Backs. 

There is a small button on the film 
back of every Hasselblad 500C/M. 
Slide it sideways with your thumb and 
the back will come away in your hand. 

The standard back holds 12 ex- 
posures. Each frame of film is 2!4 
inches square, almost four times the 
area of a 35mm /rame.( See box, below 
right, for actual size.) 

This is only the beginning. There 
are eight other backs available: Backs 
that let you change to a 6 x 4.5cm for- 
mat... or a 4.5 X 4.5cm superslide 
format for showing in any 35mm 
projector. Backs that give you a choice 
of 1, 12, 16, 24, 70, or 500 exposures. 
A back that is a sheet-film adapter. 



Even two backs for Polaroid film, so 
you can check composition, lighting, 
and exposure ahead of time. 

You begin to realize why eight out 
of ten top commercial photographers 
surveyed name Hasselblad as the 
medium-format camera used in their 
work. 

Retained Value vs. 
Obsolescence. 

In an age when machines spew out 
cameras in the tens and hundreds of 
thousands, when flashy new models 
thrust last year&apos;s marvels into early 
obsolescence, Hasselblad goes its own 
way. 

Planned obsolescence is taboo at 
Hasselblad. All but two of the acces- 
sories for the 500C/M will fit every 
Hasselblad made since 1957 (except 
the Super Wide C) . . . and will fit every 
future Hasselblad. 

The greater part of a year is spent 
on building each camera, much of it 
crafted by hand. And fully one quarter 
of the work force devotes its time to 
nothing but quality confol. 

Little wonder, then, that a pre- 
owned Hasselblad commands such a 
high price ... if its owner can be per- 
suaded to part with it at all.

rich in carbon dioxide, the very 
conditions under which methano- 
gens thrive and for which the 
earth&apos;s original hfe might have 
evolved. Could modern methano- 
gens be the remnant of the earth&apos;s 
first biota, originally evolved to 
match its general condition, but 
now restricted by the spread of 
oxygen to a few marginal envi- 
ronments? We believe that most 
free oxygen in our atmosphere is 
the product of organic photosyn- 
thesis. The Fig Tree organisms 
were already indulging in photosyn- 
thesis. Thus, the golden age of 
methanogens may have passed long 
before the advent of Fig Tree 
monerans. If this reverie be con- 
firmed, then life must have origi- 
nated long before Fig Tree times. 

In short, we now have direct 
evidence of life in the oldest rocks 
that could contain it. And, by 
reasonably strong inference, we 
have reason to believe that a major 
radiation of methanogens predated 
these photosynthesizing monerans. 
Life apparently arose about as soon 
as the earth became cool enough 
to support it. 

I exceeded my assigned column 
length long ago, but I cannot leave 
this topic without two closing 
thoughts, admittedly reflecting my 
own prejudices. First, as a strong 
adherent to exobiology, that great 
subject without a subject matter 
(only theology may exceed us in 
this), I am delighted by the thought 
that life may be more intrinsic to 
planets of our size, position, and 
composition than we had ever 
dared to imagine. I feel even more 
certain that we are not alone, and 
I hope that more eflFort will be di- 
rected toward the search for other 
civilizations by radio-telescope. 
The difficulties are legion, but a 
positive result would be the most 
stupendous discovery in history. 

Secondly, I am led to wonder 
why the old, discredited orthodoxy 
of gradual origin ever gained such 
strong and general assent. Why did 
it seem so reasonable? Certainly 
not because any direct evidence 
supported it. 

I am, as regular readers of this 
column know to the point of 
tedium, an advocate of the posi- 
tion that science is not an objec- 
tive, truth-directed machine, but a 
quintessentially human activity, af- 
fected by human passions, hopes, 
and cultural biases. Cultural tra- 



ditions of thought strongly influ- 
ence scientific theories, often di- 
recting lines of speculation, espe- 
cially (as in this case) when virtu- 
ally no data exist to constrain both 
imagination and cultural prejudice. 
In my own work, I have been im- 
pressed by the powerful and per- 
nicious influence that gradualism 
has exerted on paleontology via the 
old motto natura non facit saltuin 
(&quot;nature does not make leaps&quot;). 
Gradualism, the idea that all 
change must be smooth, slow, and 
steady, was never read from the 
rocks. It was primarily a prejudice 
of nineteenth-century liberalism 
facing a world in revolution. But it 
continues to color our supposedly 
objective reading of life&apos;s history. 

In the light of gradualistic pre- 
suppositions, what other interpre- 
tation could have been placed upon 
the origin of life? It is an enormous 
step from the constituents of our 
original atmosphere to a DNA 
molecule. Therefore, the transi- 
tion must have progressed labori- 
ously through multitudes of inter- 
vening steps, one at a time, over 
billions of years. 

The history of life, as I read it, is 
a series of long stable states, punc- 
tuated at rare intervals by major 
events that occur with great rapid- 
ity and set up the next stable era. 
Prokaryotes ruled the earth for 3 
billion years until the Cambrian ex- 
plosion, when all the major designs 
of multicellular life appeared within 
10 million years. Some 375 million 
years later, about half the families 
of invertebrates became extinct 
within a few million years. My 
favored metaphor is a world of 
occasional pulses, driving recalci- 
trant systems from one stable state 
to the next. 

Physicists tell us that the ele- 
ments may have formed during the 
first few minutes of the big bang; 
billions of years since have only 
reshuffled the products of this cata- 
clysmic creation. Life did not arise 
with such speed, but I suspect that 
it originated in a tiny fraction of its 
subsequent duration. But the re- 
shuffling and subsequent evolution 
of DNA have not simply recycled 
the original products; they have 
produced wonders.

Gerald R. Ford- 
on the American Presidency 

A man who held the highest office in the land 

chooses the 100 most significant events in the history of the Presidency... 

for permanent commemoration in precious metals. 



Minted in solid sterling silver and 24kt gold on sterling 

Limit : One collection per person 

Subscription deadline: March 15, 1978 



FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, 
a former President of the United States 
is involved in the creation of a definitive 
and unique study of the American Presidency. 
A history of our nation&apos;s highest office that 
focuses not just on the men who have held it, 
but on the evenls that have shaped it. 

This extraordinary history of the Presi- 
dency will be unique in another important 
respect. Because it will be recorded in pre- 
cious metal — on commemorative medals of 
enduring silver and gold on silver. 

To bring this medallic history into being, 
our 38th President — Gerald R. Ford — has 
reexamined the history of the office of the 
Presidency, choosing the 100 events in our 
nation&apos;s history that were in his view most 




I 



influential in shaping the nature of that office. 
Important . . . exciting . . . and controversial 
events that have defined — and dramatized — 
the extent of our Presidents&apos; powers. Turn- 
ing points in American history that have 
enabled our Chief Executives — from George 
Washington to Gerald Ford himself — to 
bring this country to the forefront of world 
leadership. 

Each of those great events, in turn, will be 
interpreted by outstanding American artists 




in the distinctive form of medallic sculpture. 
And their work will comprise an unprece- 
dented collection of 100 commemorative 
medals — finely detailed medals that will cap- 
ture the whole compelling history of the 
American Presidency. 

Events that shaped the Presidency 

The selection of the 100 events that will 
make up this unique medallic history has 
been a formidable task. Working with pro- 
fessional researchers. Gerald R. Ford de- 
veloped over many months a list of subjects 
for commemoration in this historic series. 

Some events demanded inclusion. Wash- 
ington&apos;s farewell message. Truman&apos;s dis- 
missal of General MacArthur. Lincoln&apos;s 
Gettysburg Address. Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt&apos;s unprecedented third term. 

But other events were far more diflicult to 
select. Was the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 
more significant in determining the course 
of the Presidency than the Eisenhower Doc- 



trine almost a century and a half later? 
Was Andrew Jackson&apos;s use of federal troops 
in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal riot 
more significant than Harry Truman&apos;s , 




Jefferson signs Louisiana Purchase treaty. 




seizure of the steel mills? The medallic his- 
tory reflects the choices Gerald Ford made. 
In doing so, he used many criteria. But one 
was of overriding importance: &quot;I tried to 
identify the events that would be most mean- 
ingful to the American people themselves,&quot; 
he explains. 

The final list of events represents an un- 
precedented overview of the American 
Presidency. A record of challenge and crisis 
... of progress and achievement . . . that is 
as exciting as it is enlightening. 

Medals that tell the story 

It now became the task of the master sculp- 
tors and skilled engravers of America&apos;s lead- 
ing creator of fine commemorative medals — 




The Franklin Mint — to interpret the 100 
events in the medium of medallic art. This 
was an enormous challenge. For, in every 
case, the medal commemorating a specific 
event was to portray the President involved 
in that event and to symbolize the signifi- 
cance of his action. 

Thomas Jefferson, for example, is depicted 
signing the treaty of purchase for the 
Louisiana Territory, while in the background 
an American flag is raised over the city of 
New Orleans. Abraham Lincoln is shown 
issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, 
while scenes symbolizing the freeing of the 
slaves appear behind him, Wilson is depicted 
at the Palace of Versailles, where his &quot;Four- 
teen Points&quot; led to the establishment of 
the League of Nations. John F. Kennedy is 



shown ordering the blockade of Cuba, while 
a U.S. naval task force prepares for inter- 
national confrontation on the high seas. 

All of the carefully detailed medallic 
sculptures created for this program are being 
thoroughly reviewed for historical accuracy 
and authenticity. Then, each medal will be 
carefully minted to high standards of quality 
that preserve the full detail of the sculptor&apos;s 
work while reflecting the lasting significance 
of the subject. 

Commentaries edited by President Ford 

To add still another important dimension to 
the program. President Ford will write a 
special preface for the collection, and will 
personally edit the written commentaries that 
will accompany each medal. These special 
commentaries will describe the events por- 
trayed on the medals and will explain their 
importance in the shaping of the Presidency. 

Our heritage of freedom 

It was during a working session at Vail, 
Colorado, where plans for the program were 




finalized, that Gerald R. Ford summed up 
his concept of this unique historical project. 
&quot;Having known and worked with five Presi- 
dents, and having served as President myself, 
I have come to know the many facets of this 
office. So this history, of course, reflects my 
view. But in a larger sense, it belongs to the 
American people. And if this manner of 
dramatizing history results in a better under- 
standing of our heritage of freedom, it will 
have been a most worthwhile project.&quot; 




A limited opportunity to subscribe 

The Medallic History of the American 
Presidency will be issued in a strictly 
limited edition. It may be acquired by 
subscription only, and only from the 
official minter. The Franklin Mint. 

The Mint Quality Edition of this collec- 
tion is available now. Each medal in the 
edition will be individually minted from 
painstakingly engraved coining dies — 
double-struck to provide a precision and 
intricacy of detail that is truly remark- 
able. And each person who subscribes 
may choose to receive the collection 
either in solid sterling silver or in 24 karat 
gold electroplate on sterling silver. 

To protect and display all of the medals, 
a matched set of two custom-designed 
albums will be provided. And a Certifi- 
cate of Authenticity, bearing the signa- 
ture of Gerald R. Ford, will be included. 

The medals will be issued at the rate of 
just one per month. The issue price is 
SI9.50 for each medal in solid sterling 
silver, and $27.50 in 24 karat gold on 
sterling. These prices will be guaranteed 
for the entire series — for the full 100 
months — no matter what increases may 
occur in the cost of precious metals or 
minting. To make this guarantee possible, 
the minter will commit — at current prices 
— for all the gold and silver required to 
mint the complete collection for each 
subscriber. 

Applications are therefore being ac- 
cepted by direct subscription only. The 
absolute subscription deadline is March 
15, 1978, and the total edition will be 
permanently hmited to the exact number 
of subscribers whose valid applications 
are postmarked by that date. After the 
medals have been sent, the dies used to 
mint them will be destroyed, thus pro- 
tecting forever the rarity of the collection. 

To enter your subscription, mail the 
application below by March 15th.

Strung-Out Stars 




The presence in the Milky 
Way of loose associations 
of young stars indicates 
that such groups are still 
forming in our galaxy 

A unique class of star clusters 
known as OB associations, which 
was first recognized thirty years 
ago, has been the subject of much 
recent telescopic investigation and 
theoretical analysis. Despite alter- 
nate theories, it appears that an OB 
association consists of young, mas- 
sive stars that may have been 
formed as a consequence of a se- 
quence of explosions of even more 
massive and shorter-lived stars. 

The characteristics that distin- 
guish an OB association from other 
kinds of star clusters include its 
size, the kind of stars found within 
it, the loose arrangement of those 
stars, and the association&apos;s ten- 
dency to expand. Association stars 
are spaced much farther apart than 
those of a globular cluster {see 
&quot;Stars by the Cluster,&quot; Natural 
History, October 1976) or even 
those of the less densely packed 
&quot;open&quot; clusters, such as the famil- 
iar Pleiades. In addition, nearly all 
the stars observed in OB associa- 
tions are massive, young, blue 
types known as O and B (hence 
the name &quot;OB association&quot;). Many 
of these stars are less than ten 
million years old. Stars in other 
kinds of clusters are generally 
older, cooler, and less massive. 

In 1947. a leading Soviet astron- 
omer named Victor Ambartsumian 
suggested that the many OB asso- 
ciations observed in our galaxy, the 
Milky Way, represent clear evi- 
dence for the continuing formation 
of large numbers of stars in the 
galaxy. Thus, according to Ambart- 
sumian, extensive star formation 
did not cease when the Milky Way 
itself was formed. Other astrono- 



mers had reached the same con- 
clusion from their own points of 
view, but Ambartsumian&apos;s argu- 
ment was novel. 

In simple terms, Ambartsumian&apos;s 
reasoning can be restated as fol- 
lows: The stars of the Milky Way 
follow orbits around the center of 
the galaxy. An OB association is 
large enough (some exceed 300 light- 
years in diameter) to cause the 
stars on the inner side of the group, 
that is, the side closer to the ga- 
lactic center, to orbit at noticeably 
faster rates than those on the outer 
side. They will therefore draw 
ahead, like the lead race cars in the 
Indianapolis &quot;500,&quot; and the whole 
pack will gradually be stretched out 
by this process of &quot;differential ga- 
lactic rotation&quot; until it is no longer 
recognizable as a distinct star 
cluster. This stretch-out will occur 
in a very short time span compared 
with the age of the galaxy (about 
fifteen billion years). The fact that 
OB associations can be observed in 
the Milky Way as discrete objects 
tells us accordingly that they are of 
recent vintage. This conclusion also 
provides independent confirmation 
of the deduction from the accepted 
theory of stellar evolution that O 
and B stars are much younger than 
the average stars in our galaxy. 
Ordinary star clusters are not 
drawn apart by differential galactic 
rotation because their internal grav- 
itational attraction, which draws 
the member stars toward the cluster 
center, is strong enough to prevent 
their disruption. Hence, the ordi- 
nary cluster revolves around the 
galactic center as a unit. 

In 1952, a Dutch astronomer at 
the Leiden Observatory verified a 
suggestion by Ambartsumian that 
another, more striking process 
might act to disrupt OB associa- 
tions, namely, that the member 
stars of an association are actually 



flying away from each other. In the 
terminology of astrophysics, asso- 
ciations are &quot;stellar systems of 
positive total energy.&quot; Ordinary 
star clusters have negative total 
energy, meaning that their internal 
gravitational force is sufficient to 
prevent the clusters from dissi- 
pating into galactic space. For this 
reason, ordinary globular and open 
clusters are not expanding. In an 
association, however, the opposite 
is true, and thus it seems that an 
association would break up even in 
the absence of differential galactic 
rotation. In fact, it has been sug- 
gested that the expansion of an 
association is what makes it large 
enough for differential galactic ro- 
tation to become a significant dis- 
ruptive factor. 

Further studies have shown that 
a typical OB association is not a 
single group but consists of several 
loose clumps, or &quot;subgroups,&quot; of 
stars, each gradually spreading out 
in the same way that the associa- 
tion as a whole is expanding. 

Ambartsumian proposed that the 
hundreds of stars in a typical large 
association were formed from the 
disruption of a single, very dense 
&quot;prestellar body.&quot; He admitted, 
however, that there was no evi- 
dence for the existence of such ob- 
jects in the undisrupted state nor 
any explanation for how such a 
body might fragment into normal 
stars. An explanation for the ori- 
gin of OB associations was there- 
fore required. Such a theory should 
account for their stellar composi- 
tion, size, subgroup structure, and 
tendency to expand. It should also 
account for their continued forma- 
tion during the last few hundred 
million years.

Armagh Observatory in Northern 
Ireland, lectured on &quot;The Death

says Gulf agricultural 
chemist Jim Ahle. 

&quot;Actually they&apos;re big 
trouble in North and 
South Dakota. They 
crowd out the wheat, 
and cost the farmers 
there over two hundred 
million dollars a year.

&quot;A lot of things will 
kill wild oats. NX^at we 
wanted was a single- 
minded herbicide that 
won&apos;t harm any other 
plants, or the people or 
animals who eat the 
grain. 

&quot;To solve that

problem, we developed a 
product called Carbyne® 
It proved to be one of the 
most successful wild oat 
controls ever developed. 

&quot;That was several 
years ago, but we&apos;re still 
running experiments 
with Carbyne, either 
new formulations or in 
combination with other 
herbicides, so you can 
control a variety of weeds 
with one application. 

&quot;For each new formu- 
lation, we sow thousands 
of wheat plants and wild 
oats in seed beds, and in 
a few weeks spray them 




with the experimental 
herbicide. Then we 
check to make sure the 
weeds are dead and the 
grain uncontaminated. 

One in 1^000 

&quot;For every herbicide 
that comes onto the 
market, at least seven 
thousand have been 
tested and rejected for 
one reason or another. 
Carbyne is a winner, but 
it&apos;s just one of many 
herbicides and pesticides 
we&apos;re working on here at 
Gulf. 

&quot;The American 
farmer is the most 
productive on earth. The 
challenge, as 1 see it, is 
to keep him that way.&quot;

meeting the challenge.

and Birth of Stars,&quot; at the Armagh 
Centre of the Irish Astronomical 
Society. In this talk, later ampli- 
fied in an article, he proposed that 
OB associations form when a rap- 
idly expanding shell of gas is 
ejected by a supernova explosion 
such as the one that produced the 
Crab Nebula. The shell rushes into 
the thin gas of interstellar space, 
piling it up in the process just as 
snow is swept up by the blade of a 
snowplow. In the thus-thickened 
interstellar gas, new stars would 
condense by a means that could 
not be specified but was inferred 
to occur. The new stars would 
make up an OB association, which 
would expand outward from its 
center because the member stars 
were formed from gas driven out- 
ward by the supernova shell. Opik 
also speculated that some of the 
stars created in this way would 
themselves eventually become su- 
pernovae and might subsequently 
give rise to future OB associations 
by the same process. 

The Opik theory was most imag- 
inative but it lacked a vital link, 
namely, a clearly defined process 
of star condensation. Accordingly, 
it is not too surprising that the 
theory apparently attracted scant 
attention and was nearly forgotten 
for two decades. 

In 1974, a specialist in galactic 
studies at the Max Planck Institute 
for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, 
West Germany, published the re- 
sults of a comprehensive investiga- 
tion of an expanding supernova 
shell on the boundary of the con- 
stellations Orion and Gemini. The 
author named the shell the Origem 
Loop and concluded that it was 
one of the oldest and largest super- 
nova remnants yet discovered. Per- 
haps her most significant finding, 
however, was that superimposed 
on the Loop, as seen from the 
earth, are five nebulae of the type 
that are heated and made to glow 
by the internal presence of O and 
B stars such as those in OB asso- 
ciations. The methods used to esti- 
mate the distance of such nebulae 
from the earth indicated that they 
were at the same distance as the 
Loop and therefore might actually 
coincide with it. Apparently, the 
stars of these five nebulae, which 
make up a small OB association, 
had formed in response to an effect 
of the expanding supernova shell on 
the interstellar gas clouds in its

vicinity, as predicted by the Opiic 
theory. 

The aforementioned article did 
not refer to Opitc&apos;s wori&lt;; indeed, 
the author may have been unaware 
of it. However, the article caught 
the eye of a TUricish colleague of 
mine, Hakki B. Ogelman, who was 
on a year&apos;s visit to this country 
from the Middle East Technical 
University in Ankara. In August 
1975, inspired by the apparent dis- 
covery of star formation in the 
Origem Loop, he and I drafted an 
updated version of Opik&apos;s theory 
on the origin of OB associations. 

Many advances in astrophysical 
understanding since 1953 contrib- 
uted to our formulation of the re- 
vised theory. The most important 
of these was the general recogni- 
tion (as a result of detailed calcu- 
lations made independently by 
several astronomers) that shock 
waves, including the kind of blast 
that travels out into space from a 
supernova explosion, can cause an 
interstellar gas cloud to begin con- 
densing into stars. The calcula- 
tions show that when a shock wave 
encounters an interstellar cloud, it 
will race around the exterior of the 
cloud more rapidly than it can pen- 
etrate to its center. As a result, the 
cloud, instead of simply being 
blasted from one side, is effectively 
squeezed from all directions. A 
similar effect is reported to demol- 
ish buildings subjected to the blast 
wave from nuclear bomb tests: 
they are blown together, rather 
than apart. The compression of an 
interstellar cloud by the supernova 
shock wave causes the cloud to 
condense and break up into stars, 
and this may be the missing proc- 
ess that the Opik theory required. 

There has been much progress 
recently in the study of how stars 
evolve, and the results of this work 
also have important applications to 
the theory of how OB associations 
are formed. In particular, it is well 
established that when stars begin 
to condense, the more massive ones 
form most rapidly. Further, when 
the stars are formed and nuclear 
reactions begin under conditions of 
high pressure and temperature at 
the stellar centers, the most mas- 
sive stars, that is, those of types O 
and B, which have the largest in- 
ternal nuclear &quot;furnaces,&quot; burn 
most rapidly. As a result, these 
massive stars may exhaust their 
fuel while smaller stars in the same

association continue to burn slowly 
or, in some cases, are still in the 
formative stage. When the massive 
stars reach the end of their fuel, the 
accepted stellar evolution theory 
predicts that they will go out in a 
blaze of glory in a supernova 
explosion. 

In our version of the association- 
formation theory, my colleague and 
I proposed that the shock wave 
from an initial supernova explosion 
triggers the formation of an associ- 
ation subgroup. Among the new- 
born stars of the subgroup, the 
most massive ones evolve most 
rapidly for the reason explained 
above. Thus, the two or three most 
massive stars of the subgroup will 
reach the end of their lives and 
themselves become supernovae, 
while the smaller stars are still 
comfortably husbanding their mod- 
est internal fuel supplies or are 
only in the process of forming. The 
two or three second-generation 
supernovae created in this way 
will each generate a shock wave 
that, in turn, causes additional new 
stars to form. Each supernova 
thereby produces a new subgroup. 
In each subgroup, once again the 
most massive stars will soon be- 
come supernovae themselves. 

An OB association is thus pro- 
duced by a chain reaction of stellar 
explosions, which we have termed 
the &quot;supernova cascade.&quot; By tak- 
ing into account the estimated time 
intervals required for each step in 
the process and the radius of ex- 
pansion of a supernova shock wave 
during each relevant interval, we 
found that this cascade might well 
explain the observed characteris- 
tics of OB associations, including 
their expansion, subgroup struc- 
ture, and size. 

Further evidence for supernova- 
induced star formation comes from 
observations of a group of stars 
and associated nebulosity known 
as CMa Rl that appears to be even 
younger than most OB associa- 
tions. According to a recent study 
by two astronomers at the Carnegie 
Institution of Washington, CMa- 
R 1 is located on the edge of a super- 
nova remnant dating from a stellar 
explosion that occurred about 
500,000 years ago. The Carnegie 
astronomers suggested that a 
nearby OB association may have 
been the site of the supernova that 
gave rise to CMa Rl. They have 
also revived a suggestion made by 



Opik that the Barnard Loop, a 
large nebula of uncertain nature in 
Orion, is a supernova remnant re- 
lated to the prominent OB associa- 
tion observed within it. Similar 
findings have been reported for 
several other associations as well. 
In short, there appears to be in- 
creasing evidence that supernova 
shock waves may have given rise 
to stellar associations. However, 
the Milky Way has other kinds of 
shock waves that might produce 
the same effects. In particular, 
there is a shock wave associated 
with the spiral pattern of our galaxy 
and there may be shock waves 
generated by the formation of elec- 
trically excited, or ionized, nebulae 
around young, hot stars. These 
kinds of shock waves have been 
proposed as the mechanism that 
creates OB associations. It seems 
likely to me that both of them, as 
well as the supernova cascade, may 
contribute to star formation in the 
Milky Way.

BOOK-OF-THE-MONTH CLUB 



A Matter of Taste 



Pease Be With You 



Chickpeas, like other 
legumes, are a good source 
of cheap protein 



If that noblest Roman prose 
writer of them all, Marcus Tullius 
Cicero, were alive today, his favor- 
ite New York restaurant would 
probably be Max&apos;s Kansas City, 
the once hip, slightly faded saloon 
near Union Square. Cicero would 
not be attracted to Max&apos;s out of 
some feeling for this former haunt 
of Andy Warhol&apos;s &quot;superstars.&quot; 
But he would like the sign out front, 
which promises &quot;steak, lobster, 
chickpeas.&quot; The hero of the Cati- 
linarian orations would actually be 
drawn, not to the steak and lobster, 
but to the chickpeas, and for a spe- 
cial reason. Cicero&apos;s family name is 
a form of the Latin word for chick- 
pea, cicer. Leguminous cognomens 
were not unusual in ancient Rome. 
With no apparent loss of dignity, 
eminent folk went about the impe- 
rial city identifying themselves as 
Lentil (Lentulus) and Pea (Piso). 

Strictly speaking, legumes (order 
Leguminosae) are no laughing mat- 
ter today either. Peas, beans, pea- 
nuts, soybeans, and chickpeas are 
the outstanding nonmeat source of 
protein in nature. But the chickpea, 
which flourishes in dry, warm cli- 
mates (the Mediterranean littoral, 
the Near East, and India), is, at 
best, a marginal item in our North 
Temperate Zone diet. And its name 
(Cicero notwithstanding) makes it 
sound funny. Only in Spain, as 
garbanzos, do the seeds of Cicer 
arietimim escape the curse of no- 
menclatural comedy. In France, 
they are pais chiches, a compound 



derived from the Latin word for pea 
and from cicer. But chiche is ver- 
nacular French for &quot;I dare you.&quot; 

Germans, who rarely eat chick- 
peas, must refer to them as Kicher- 
erbsen, a pairing of kicher (from 
cicer) and the garden- variety, Ger- 
man word for peas, Erbsen. Unfor- 
tunately, there is an etymologically 
unrelated verb, kichern, which 
means high-pitched laughter. To 
German ears, then, Kichererbsen 
are gigglepeas. In Italy, tasty, flat- 
sided, beige ceci are popular, boiled 
whole in soup or ground into flour. 
And yet, they are also the source of 
a decadent, seventeenth-century 
word, cicisbeo, an inversion of bel 
cece, beautiful chickpea, which 
was the name given to men who 
appeared in public with other men&apos;s 
wives. Cicisbeos were socially ap- 
proved escorts in a culture where 
no chic woman would go out with 
her own husband as her escort. 

Chickpeas go back much, much 
further in history. They crop up in 
Egyptian hieroglyphic texts as the 
&quot;hawk face.&quot; The name comes 
from the beaklike projection that 
grows on one side of the seeds. This 
small protuberance made later ob- 
servers think of a ram&apos;s head, 
whence the species name, arieti- 
mim, from aries, Latin for ram. 
Less fanciful observers see a typi- 
cal legume, a pealike, bushy, hairy 
plant that grows two feet high and 
fruits in the form of pods. The flow- 
ers emerge from the bud in three 
tiers of petals. The top petal is the 
&quot;banner&quot;; two lateral petals are 
called wings; a lower pair, some- 
times united, enclose stamen and 
pistil and are known as the keel. 

Planted eight to twelve inches 
apart, chickpea plants produce 
white or reddish flowers and yield 



anywhere from 500 to 1 ,000 pounds 
of seeds per acre. The sparse foli- 
age is poisonous and cannot be 
used for forage, but the green pods 
are edible and are sometimes used 
as an adulterant or substitute for 
coffee. The seeds are, of course, 
the point of the exercise. Highly 
nutritious — good sources of cheap 
protein, carbohydrates, fats, and 
B vitamins — chickpea seeds are so 
valued in India that they are raised 
on a vast acreage estimated to equal 
the entire worldwide acreage de- 
voted to sugar cane. 

This leguminous bounty is, sub- 
stantially, the result of a beneficial 
infection. Chickpeas, like other 
legumes, have characteristic nod- 
ules on their roots. These swollen 
tubercles are the visible aspect of a 
symbiosis between legume root 
cells and certain bacteria of the 
genus Rhizobium that are capable 
of processing, or &quot;fixing,&quot; free 
nitrogen out of the air and passing it 
on to the host plant. Nitrogen is, of 
course, the principal component of 
artificial fertilizers and it is a vital 
element of proteins. Properly inoc- 
ulated legumes thus can, and do, 
fertilize themselves. 

This is why legumes are so high 
in protein. And it also explains why 
legumes have been rotated with 
other crops since ancient times. 
Plowing under unwanted parts or 
all of a legume cover crop — a 
method known as green manuring 
— dates from at least as far back as 
Vergil and Theophrastus, who de- 
scribed it. Today, with fertilizer 
prices zooming, scientists are ex- 
ploring the possibility of developing 
a similar nitrogen-fixing capability 
in nonleguminous crops. Mean- 
while, an unrelated plant-growth 
stimulant has apparently been dis- 



38 



by Raymond Sokolov 



covered in that common legume 
alfalfa. 

In addition to their undoubted 
nutritional and chemical value, 
legumes are worth having around 
because they taste good. The diver- 
sity of the family&apos;s edible parts is 
quite surprising. Consider only that 
we benefit at table from peas, soy- 
bean curd (tofu), and lentils; from 
wax beans, broad beans, green 
beans, limas, and mung bean 
sprouts. Some legume seeds are 
sold dried; some come to us green 
and tender. Some plants, like the 
ordinary green bean, are cultivated 
for their pods. The Chinese manu- 
facture a bewildering spectrum of 
bean-paste condiments. Mexicans 
produce their own, hot-blooded 
bean dip. 

Perhaps we take this relatively 
mundane array too much for 
granted. We should certainly not 
dismiss the pea and the bean as 
plain fare. Fresh from the garden 
and boiled in generous amounts of 
salted water (a rapid, taste-preserv- 
ing, and nutritious method of prepa- 
ration), they will emerge bright 
green and riotous with flavor, a 
treat for any palate, no matter how 
sophisticated. 

Still, most legumes are household 
words, and need little introduction. 
Cicer arietinum, on the other hand, 
is a relatively unknown quantity, 
which most of us rarely use except 
straight from the can as an oddment 
in salads. Unprocessed chickpeas 
are available in specialty markets 
and health food stores. They are 
very hard and should be soaked 
overnight. Some authorities start 
with lukewarm water and add salt 
and a little flour. This seems un- 
necessary, as does the canonical 
addition of a pinch of bicarbonate 



Fertilizing: Its importance 
in creating superior wines. 




Fertilizing the vineyard is a vital part in 
the art of growing premium wine grapes. 
It is not a simple operation. 

Its Importance 

A healthy grapevine can thrive for 80 
years or more. In fact, the older its stock, 
generally the better its grapes. 

During the vine&apos;s lifetime its nutritional 
requirements will change from its earliest 
years — when it is being trained to the 
desired form for grape growing — to its 
later years — as it gradually matures into 
an established vine. 

Thus, any fertilizer program that is to 
be complete must take into considera- 
tion both the vine&apos;s long-term needs and 
its immediate requirements. 

Different Needs 

Fertilizing is not a simple operation. 
We know that even within a single vine- 
yard, there are no homogeneous soils. 
Soil textures can range from fine or 
coarse sand, to a very fertile sandy loam. 

These different soils require different 
fertilizers in different amounts to com- 
pensate for deficiencies. As a result, we 
have kept a precise history of all the fer- 
tilizing experiences in our vineyards over 
the past 30 years. 

We know exactly when, how much, 
and what kind of fertilizer has been 
applied to each of our vineyards during 
that time. 

We know the results of those appli- 
cations — and how long the treatment 
lasted — down to small problem areas 
only a few yards square and even indi- 
vidual vines. 

One of the methods we use to gauge 
these results is core sampling — the ex- 
traction of a cross-section of earth to be 
analyzed for nutrients — or the lack of 
them. Above, you see a renditon of our 
core sampler being used. 

We take samples at various depths 
down to four feet from any part of the 
vineyard which may show abnormal 
vine growth or visual deficiencies for 
comparison with samples from normal 
areas. These soil samples are delivered to 
our winery for immediate analysis. They 
will be analyzed and compared for avail- 
able nitrogen, pH, organic matter, and 
other important elements in order to de- 



termine the source of the problem and 
the type and quantity of fertilizer which is 
required. 

Fertilizing As An 
Exact Science 

There are two good reasons why we 
take so much care when it comes to fer- 
tilizing: under-fertilizing and over-fertiliz- 
ing. Under-fertilizing greatly reduces vine 
growth and bud fruitfulness, whereas 
over-fertilizing can produce such excep- 
tionally heavy leaf growth as to curtail 
bud fmitfulness and grape production. 

These phenomena are the result of an 
imbalance of what is known as the 
carbohydrate-nitrogen level of the vine. 

A high carbohydrate-moderate nitro- 
gen level produces moderate vegetative 
growth, early wood maturity, abundant 
fruit bud formation and good fmit pro- 
duction. 

This is what we look for in the Gallo 
Vineyards. 

Petiole Analysis 

In addition to normal soil analysis in 
our vineyards we also employ a test 
known as &quot;petiole analysis.&quot; 

The petiole is the stalk of a vine leaf. 
By taking a sample of it and analyzing it, 
we can determine the current nutritional 
status of the entire grapevine. 

If we find that a particular area of one 
of our vineyards is weaker than the rest, 
we will immediately gather 200 or more 
petiole samples from that section — plus 
a like number from a healthier area of the 
same vineyard for comparison. 

By analyzing the tissues of all these 
samples, we can readily and specifically 
determine if the weaker area has a defi- 
ciency of nitrogen, potassium, zinc, boron 
or some other vital mineral. 

Our Solution 

These are only a few of the many spe- 
cial steps we take in the Gallo Vineyards 
to try to grow the finest grapes possible. 

It is only by such meticulous care 
along the entire chain of grape growing 
and winemaking steps that we can hope 
to achieve our goal: 

To provide you with the finest wines 
we can produce.

of soda the next day before you 
begin boiling them (except where 
water is hard). It is normally suffi- 
cient merely to drain the soaked 
chickpeas, put them in fresh water 
to cover, and simmer, covered, for 
an hour or until tender. Then drain 
again, submerge in cold water, and 
rub until the skins separate from 
the seeds. The skins will float to 
the surface of the water and can be 
skimmed away. At this point, you 
are ready to prepare a whole range 
of unusual and hearty recipes. In- 
deed, an entire meal can be pre- 
pared with chickpeas, from hors 
d&apos;oeuvres to dessert. I do not pro- 
pose this as something anyone 
would actually wish to try, only as 
proof of the ingenuity of the human 
mind and evidence of the versatility 
of an underused foodstuff. 

The best known chickpea appe- 
tizer is the Near Eastern specialty 
hummus. This is a paste concocted 
from sesame seed oil (sold as tahini 
in Arab and specialty markets) and 
mashed, cooked chickpeas flavored 
with lemon juice and garlic. In 
Italy, pureed chickpeas go into a 
soup with pasta and other flavor- 
ings, for example, tomato and an- 
chovy. In the Caucasus, whole 
cooked chickpeas garnish a chicken 
soup enriched with rice, prunes, 
and dill. In southern France, you 
may run into a cold hors d&apos;oeuvre 
of chickpeas simmered in white 
wine with thyme and garlic. 

For the most part, however, 
chickpeas come in side dishes or as 
an element of complex main dishes. 
Israelis mix them with fava beans 
in a doubly leguminous salad. In the 
Caucasus, there is a dish called 
siserov shanakh, spinach steamed 
with a little tomato paste and gar- 
nished with chickpeas. The same 
region makes wheat pilaf with liver 
and chickpeas. 

North Africans use chickpeas 
frequently in some kinds of cous- 
cous. The most exotic version is 
Tunisian and employs such spices 
as ground dried rosebuds, as well 
as quince and fish. 

Sausages and chickpeas in broth 
have entered the French repertory 
as pais chiches a la catalane, be- 
cause the original version of the 
dish evolved south of the Pyrenees 
near Barcelona, the capital of Span- 
ish Catalonia. Innumerable chick- 
pea side dishes involve simmering 
onions with typical local spices, 
then adding chickpeas and heating 



them through. Spicy, cumin-laden 
Indian chickpeas or chili-powered 
chickpeas from New Mexico are 
examples of this basic theme and 
variations. 

Chickpea flour, available in spe- 
ciality outlets and in Indian markets 
(where it is called besan), is a staple 
of the Mediterranean and India. I 
have seen two versions of the deep- 
fried &quot;French fries&quot; called pani- 
setti on the Ligurian coast of Italy 
and piinisses in neighboring Nice. 
There are minor differences. Basic- 
ally, though, deep-frying small 
strips of moistened and boiled 
chickpea flour produces a crisp, 
starchy finger food with greater 
personality than potatoes can offer. 
Chickpea flour can also be used 
for dessert. Mysore pak is the name 
of the Indian pastry that will round 
out our imaginary, all-chickpea 
meal. Ghee, almond flavoring, 
sugar, and cardamom are com- 
bined with besan to make a sweet, 
flat, high-protein cake. Gigglepea 
indeed! 

Panisetti 

(Chickpea French fries) 

Salt 
1 cup chickpea flour 
3 tablespoons olive oil 

Oil for deep frying 

1. Bring Wi cups of salted water to 
a boil. Stir in the chickpea flour. 
Stir until smooth. 

2. Place over an asbestos pad and 
continue cooking for at least an 
hour over lowest possible heat, 
stirring frequently. (One recipe 
calls for 3 hours and achieves a 
very nutty flavor.) 

3. Push the cooked flour through a 
sieve into a mixing bowl. Stir in 
the 3 tablespoons olive oil. 

4. Spread this dough on an oiled 
surface such as a plate, using a 
knife and cleaning it as neces- 
sary in hot water to remove ad- 
hering dough. (Dough should be 
about Vi inch thick.) 

5. Let cool. Cut in strips of any 
length. Deep fry a few at a time 
in smoking oil until crisp and 
brown. Drain on paper towel 
and keep warm until the entire 
batch is fried. 

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

A Living Fossil 



One small plant has 
a long history and 
tells a complicated story 
that is still unfolding 



Imagine the emotions of a pale- 
ontologist, long a student of dino- 
saur evolution, who suddenly 
encountered a live Bronlosaurus, 
Triceratops, or Tyrannosaurus. 
That is roughly what happened 
about ten years ago to Sanford 
Siegel, a University of Hawaii bot- 
anist, when he examined the micro- 
organisms of a sample of soil he had 
gathered near the wall of Harlech 
Castle in Wales. When he cultured 
that soil sample in the presence of 
concentrated ammonium hydroxide, 
which greatly inhibits or arrests 
the life processes of most conven- 
tional cells, the medium triggered 
the growth of microscopic clusters 
of star-shaped bodies attached to 
slender stalks. Each body, about 5 
micrometers (0.0002 inch) in di- 
ameter, closely resembled pictures 
Siegel had seen of a recently dis- 
covered fossil microorganism. 
But as far as he knew, no living 
specimens of this organism had 
ever been described. With the help 
of the fossil&apos;s discoverer, Elso 
Barghoorn of Harvard University, 
Siegel was able to establish, in a 
strange sequence of paleobotanical 
events, that he had found a living 
relative of an organism first de- 
scribed as a fossil. 

Barghoorn had made his own dis- 
covery while gathering specimens 
of ancient rocks in a search for 



primitive organisms. One speci- 
men of chert, or flintlike rock, from 
Kakabek in Ontario, Canada, con- 
tained peculiar umbrellalike forms 
that seemed regular enough in 
physical appearance and structure 
to be considered microorganisms, 
rather than a pattern that had de- 
veloped as the rock formed. Barg- 
hoorn named these microorganisms 
Kakabekia umbrellata, meaning 
umbrellalike form from Kakabek. 

Since the rocks in which Barg- 
hoorn &apos;s forms appeared dated from 
the middle Precambrian period, 
about two billion years ago, the 
microorganisms were among the 
oldest of all plantlike fossils. 
Siegel&apos;s discovery of a living rela- 
tive of Barghoom&apos;s fossils estab- 
lished a remarkable thread of 
biological history. Siegel named his 
creature Kakabekia barghoorniana 
in honor of his colleague. 

Siegel had come to Harlech 
Castle in the course of a long 
project. For many years, with the 
support of the National Aeronau- 
tics and Space Administration, he 
had been examining the physiology 
of organisms under stress, espe- 
cially stress caused by harsh en- 
vironments likely to be encoun- 
tered during space travel or near or 
on other planets. Because ammonia 
is generally thought to have been 
one of the more abundant com- 
ponents of the primitive earth&apos;s 
atmosphere, and is still one of the 
major components of the present 
atmosphere of Jupiter, Siegel 
wanted to study earthly environ- 
ments with abundant ammonia. 
Natural candidates for examination 



were soils saturated with urine. On 
a chance visit to Harlech Castle, he 
observed tourists urinating near the 
castle walls, and learning that this 
was an old practice, decided to 
collect his first soil sample. Since 
the organism he discovered in that 
soil thrived in the presence of con- 
centrated ammonium hydroxide 
and was not seen in other environ- 
ments, Siegel hypothesized that 
he had found an obligate ammon- 
ophile, an organism that requires 
ammonia in order to grow. 

In the ten years since he first 
visited Harlech Castle, Siegel has 
found that he was mistaken about 
Kakabekia&apos; s need for ammonia. At 
sea level, the microorganism does 
require the compound, yet Kaka- 
bekia also appears in certain moun- 
tainous regions low in ammonia but 
high in alkalinity. Without ammonia, 
Kakabekia needs special soil con- 
ditions, as well as peculiar com- 
binations of temperature and alti- 
tude, to thrive. 

In soil samples from Hawaii, 
California, the Great Plains states, 
Illinois, New York, western Eur- 
ope, and northern South America, 
Siegel found no signs of Kakabekia. 
But the microorganism did show up 
in soils from Alaska, Iceland, and 
various alpine regions. So tempera- 
ture seemed to be one of the factors 
governing the distribution of mod- 
ern Kakabekia. But in studying its 
distribution up Hawaiian and Japa- 
nese mountain peaks, Siegel found 
that it grew in bands, which meant 
that at least one other factor was 
interacting with temperature to 
limit the organism&apos;s distribution. At

Original art you can own, 
instead of just visit. 




There&apos;s one experience that surpasses 
seeing an original work of art in a museum. 

Seeing it in your home. 

When you Hve with art, there are no 
time Umits on your appreciation. 

One day the work appeals to you in a 
particular way, and the next day you may find 
new meaning in it. 

Perhaps a previously unnoticed detail 
takes on significance. 

Perhaps the entire work seems to 
change as your mood changes. 

You form a relationship with the work- 
almost a dialogue — and it alters the way 
you look at things around you. 

And, inevitably, you grow to value it 
more and more.

lower elevations, Kakabekia is not 
found below about 45° north lati- 
tude, and thus appears restricted to 
regions with comparatively cool 
summers. At latitudes closer to the 
equator, it grows only at altitudes 
above 6,500 feet. Since air tempera- 
ture decreases about 7°C (about 
12°F) for each 3,300 feet of altitude, 
Kakabekia seemed to require low 
temperature and a certain altitude. 

The Kakabekia Siegel found on 
Mauna Kea, an extinct volcano in 
Hawaii, appeared to bear out his 
ideas about the microorganism&apos;s 
temperature and altitude require- 
ments. He recovered it on the vol- 
cano at altitudes above 1 1,500 feet. 
Once cultured, organisms consist- 
ently appeared in his soil samples 
at -7°C, but not at 30°C. But at 
about 10,000 feet up Mauna Kea, 
and on down to the base of the 
mountain (about 7,500 feet above 
sea level), Kakabekia showed ex- 
actly opposite characteristics, 
growing at 30°C, but not at -7°C. 
This second Kakabekia, which has 
adjusted ecologically to warm tem- 
peratures, seems to be a variant of 
the cryophilic, or low-temperature- 
favoring, strain that Siegel had 
found earlier. 

There are other variants of Kaka- 
bekia, with differences in the um- 
brellalike cap, with or without a 
stipe, or stalk. The umbrella may 
be lobed, scalloped, fringed, or cut 
into rather acute angles, and may 
have varying numbers of rays, 
the umbrella&apos;s ribs. These strains 
probably represent genetic variants 
that evolved from some proto- 
typical form. 

Another peculiarity of Kaka- 
bekia is that its cultures require no 
oxygen, but unlike typical anaero- 
bic bacteria such as Clostridium, 
which causes gangrene, it is not 
killed by oxygen in the air. Kaka- 
bekia does require a distinctly alka- 
line environment, which can be 
furnished equally well by sodium 
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, 
or ammonium hydroxide at a level 
that would be toxic to most living 
creatures. When sodium hydroxide 
is replaced by sodium metasilicate, 
which provides the same kind of 
alkaline environment, as well as 
silica, Kakabekia grows more 
slowly, or stops altogether. Since it 
contains large quantities of silica 
(the hard part of its cell walls that 
leaves a fossil) and has almost al- 
ways been found with diatoms 



(algae that have silica cell walls), 
researchers thought that Kakabekia 
could easily take advantage of sili- 
con in its microenvironment. But if 
metasilicate is toxic to Kakabekia, 
it must obtain its silicon from ordi- 
nary minerals in soil, possibly from 
sand, which is silicon dioxide. 

So far we know little about the 
Kakabekia cell and its metabolism. 
Our information has been limited 
because we have been unable to 
grow Kakabekia in pure culture — 
all cultures have been contaminated 
by other organisms, invariably 
diatoms — and because Kakabekia 
cells seem to grow very slowly. 
We do know that when these cells 
are tested with the Feulgen stain, 
which shows up the DNA of chrom- 
osomes, the results are negative. 
Since all known living things must 
contain DNA, Kakabekia is prob- 
ably a prokaryote, an organism 
that, like a bacterium, does not 
have its chromosomes gathered 
into a discrete nucleus. This hypo- 
thesis is supported by the discovery 
by several Russian workers of some 
star-shaped bacteria that develop 
in certain kinds of soil or in creek 
water rich in organic material. Al- 
though Kakabekia is nearly twice 
as large as these bacteria, they do 
have a marked morphological re- 
semblance. Their possible genetic 
relation is seconded by the fact that 
all of the star-shaped bacteria have 
been collected from cool regions. 

Kakabekia&apos; s slow growth raises 
questions in itself. In order to grow, 
it must have oxidizing enzymes that 
will mobilize energy from its en- 
vironment. Yet preliminary experi- 
ments have revealed that Kaka- 
bekia contains neither the deme 
enzyme nor the phenol-oxidizing 
enzymes that are most organisms&apos; 
conventional means of producing

WHAT&apos;S BETTER 
THAN SPEED READING? 



SPEED LEARNING 

(SPEEDPLUS COMPREHENSION! 



Speed Learning is replacing speed reading because it&apos;s easy to learn . . . lasts a lifetime . . . applies to 
everything you read . . . and is the only fully accredited course with the option of 3 college credits. 

Do you have too much to read and too 
little time to read it? Do you mentally 
pronounce each word as you read? Do 
you frequently have to go back and re- 
read words or whole paragraphs you just 
finished reading? Do you have trouble 
concentrating? Do you quickly forget 
most of what you read? 

If you answer &quot;yes&quot; to any of these 
■questions — then here at last is the prac- 
tical help you&apos;ve been waiting for. 
Whether you read for business or plea- 
sure, school or college, you will build excep- 
tional skills from this major breakthrough 
in effective reading, created by I&gt;. Russell 
Stauffer at the University of Delaware. 



Not just &quot;speed reading&quot; — but speed 

reading-thinking-understanding- 

remembering-and-learning 

The new Speed Learning Program 
shows you step-by-proven-step how to 
increase your reading skill and speed, so 
you understand more, remember more 
and use more of everything you read. 
The typical remark made by the 75,000 
slow readers who completed the Speed 
Learning Program was: &quot;Why didn&apos;t 
someone teach me this a long time ago?&quot; 
They were no longer held back by the 
lack of skills and poor reading habits. 
They could read almost as fast as they 
could think. 

What makes Speed Learning so successful? 

The new Speed Learning Program does 
not offer you a rehash of the usual eye- 
exercises, timing devices, costly gadgets 
you&apos;ve probably heard about in connec- 
tion with speed reading courses or even 
tried and found ineffective. 

In just a few spare minutes a day of 
easy reading and exciting listening, you 
discover an entirely new way to read and 
think — a radical departure from any-

thing you have ever seen or heard about. 
Research shows that reading is 95% 
thinking and only 5% eye movement. Yet 
most of today&apos;s speed reading programs 
spend their time teaching you rapid eye 
movement (5% of the problem) and ig- 
nore the most important part (95%) think- 
ing. In brief. Speed Learning gives you 
what speed reading can&apos;t. 

Imagine the new freedom you&apos;ll have 
when you learn how to dash through all 
types of reading material at least twice as 
fast as you do now, and with greater 
comprehension. Think of being able to 
get on top of the avalanche of newspa- 
pers, magazines and correspondence you 
have to read . . . finishing a stimulating 
book and retaining facts and details more 
clearly and with greater accuracy than 
ever before. 

Listen-and-learn at your own pace 

This is a practical, easy-to-leam pro- 
gram that will work for you — no matter

Abundant Birds of Beringia 



by William H. Drury 
photographs by Hope Alexander 



While population diversity 
is usually limited in the 
higher latitudes, geologic 
forces and biological 
productivity in the Bering Sea 
region have created an 
oasis for avian fauna 

Most people who take an intro- 
ductory college biology course 
learn of several geographic rules 
that account for both the diversity 
of species within an area and the 
population size of these species. 
One of these rules is that tropical 
regions produce many species, but 
that populations of each species are 
small. A bird watcher in the inland 
tundra of Alaska would be lucky to 
spot twenty bird species in a day, 
but in the forests, fields, and 
swamps of Central America, the 
sighting of two hundred species in 
a day is not unusual. 

Another rule states that while 
fewer species inhabit the higher 
latitudes, their populations tend to 
be large. Antarctica, its coastal 
islands, and islands in the South 
Atlantic, for example, have huge 
populations of penguins, petrels, 
and other marine birds. 

The difference in species diver- 
sity and population size in the two 
areas is essentially a reflection of 
climate and biological productivity: 
uniformly warm and moist climates 
support more species than do cli- 
mates in which temperature or 
rainfall varies widely. 

Most rules are made to be 
broken. Although many species, 
particularly land animals, conform 
to these geographic rules, some do 
not. Exceptions occur among ma- 
rine species that thrive on the vast 
food resources made available by 



cold water, currents, and upwelling 
systems. One of the most pro- 
nounced exceptions are the sea 
birds, waterfowl, and shore birds of 
the Bering Sea between Alaska and 
Siberia. Vast populations of more 
than thirty-four species nest on its 
many islands and along its ragged 
coastline. On the Pribilof Islands in 
the southern Bering Sea, some 
225,000 red-legged kittiwakes— 
nearly the entire world popula- 
tion — nest along with roughly 
1 00,000 black-legged kittiwakes , 1 . 5 
million thick-billed murres. and 
enormous numbers of crested and 
least auklets. Six hundred miles to 
the north, one million least auklets 
crowd the cliffs and rock-strewn 
shores of Little Diomede Island in 
the Bering Strait. 

Each spring the number of 
species in the Bering Sea increases 
as those that have spent the winter 
at sea around the Aleutian Islands 
or along coasts of the Pacific Ocean 
in both North and South America 
return to their nesting areas. During 
May, murres, kittiwakes, and 
puffins appear by the thousands in 
the widening leads among the ice 
flows or gather in the open water 
beneath nesting cliffs. Great flocks 
of eiders and old squaws and 
scoters hurry north along the wind- 
rows of drift ice. By late May, 
auklets swarm like mosquitoes 
around the rubble slopes of the 
islands. 

Later in the summer, short-tailed 
shearwaters from the Southern 
Hemisphere arrive through the 
passes of the Aleutian Islands and 
cross over the waters of the con- 
tinental shelf near Saint Lawrence 
Island on their way to the Bering 
Strait and the Chukchi Sea. During 
the last century, short-tailed alba- 



trosses skimmed the northwest 
Bering Sea at this time of year. To- 
day, few are seen because dur- 
ing the late nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries, plume hunters 
nearly exterminated the great birds 
on their breeding islands off Japan. 

With a few conspicuous excep- 
tions, such as the sooty tern of 
tropical seas or the quelea weaver 
finch of the East African plains, 
high bird populations are rare in the 
tropics both north and south of the 
equator. The number of sea bird 
species in more equatorial oceanic 
systems is also far lower than in the 
Bering Sea. Only some twenty or so 
endemic species inhabit either the 
Hawaiian Islands or the Galapagos 
Archipelago to the south. About the 
same number inhabit the coast of 
southern California. 

Marine bird species do not live in 
great profusion everywhere in the 
Bering Sea. Rather, they crowd 
into definite centers. One of these 
is at the western end of the curving 
line formed by the Aleutians and 
the Commander Islands, extending 
from southwestern Alaska west to 
the Kamchatka Peninsula, which 
dangles off eastern Siberia. Murres, 
guillemots, puffins, and kittiwakes 
nest in extensive colonies along 
this c4iain. In addition, four species 
of auklet occur here. One, the 
whiskered auklet, is restricted in its 



Kittiwakes and murres often 

nest on the same cliffs. The 

murres choose ledges closer 

to the summits and lay eggs on 

the bare rocks, whereas 

kittiwakes make nests.

nesting to the Aleutians and neigh- 
boring Siberian islands. 

The Pribilof Islands are another 
major population center. Still an- 
other center of species diversity is 
in the Bering Strait and the Chiri- 
kof Basin, the northernmost part 
of the Bering Sea just south of 
where Siberia and Alaska stand 
nose to nose. Three species of 
auklet — least, crested, and para- 
keet — nest in large colonies on 
Saint Lawrence, King, and Little 
Diomede islands. Birds are not the 
only animals that show great 
species diversity in the Bering Sea. 
Forty-five species of sculpin — 
large-headed, spiny fish — dwell in 
the deep southern part of the Bering 
Sea and along the edge of the conti- 
nental shelf, and five species of 
salmon ascend Alaska&apos;s rivers each 



spring to spawn. In contrast, only 
one salmon species inhabits the 
North Atlantic. 

The terrestrial flora of the region 
is also varied, far more so than 
in the higher latitudes of interior 
North America. The flora of the en- 
tire Canadian Arctic archipelago 
numbers 340 species. On Alaska&apos;s 
Seward Peninsula alone, botanists 
have recorded 475 species of vas- 
cular plants. 

Widely different climatic condi- 
tions within Beringia — the area that 
includes Alaska&apos;s interior moun- 
tains, its southeast coastal ranges, 
the Aleutian-Commander Islands 
chain, the Kamchatka Peninsula, 
and the Bering Strait islands — 
account, in part, for the region&apos;s 
intriguing and complex faunal 
and floral diversity. This climatic

Murres, top left, crowd together in 
tightly packed colonies, but 
kittiwakes, left, space their nests 
on long, narrow ledges and defend 
an area about six inches wide on 
each side. Because murres do not 
build nests, egg loss is higher than 
among kittiwakes. Potential loss is 
lessened because the egg&apos;s 
shape -wide at one end, narrow at 
the other-prevents it from easily 
rolling off. Pacific cormorants, 
above, nest on shorter, wider 
ledges, often at the edge of 
kittiwake and murre colonies. 



variety is, in turn, caused by pro- 
nounced topographic relief, which 
also creates various habitats. The 
climate of the Aleutian Islands 
and southeastern Alaska, for ex- 
ample, is mild and moist, whereas 
that of the Seward Peninsula is 
bitterly cold and surprisingly dry. 
In interior Alaska, the temperature 
on winter days might be -50°F, 
while in summer, the heat is worse 
than Miami&apos;s. 

Geologic forces have also con- 
tributed to large populations and 
diversity of sea birds. Much of the

ALASKA 




High sea bird populations do not 
occur throughout the Bering Sea. 
The largest colonies nest in the 
outlined areas, generally where 
nesting sites and food resources 
are most abundant. Many nutrients 
are brought into the Bering Sea by 
currents from the North Pacific, 
which rise as they sweep over the 
continental shelf (dotted line). The 
resultant turbulence causes the 
highest zooplankton productivity 
in the light-green area and the 
highest benthic productivity in 
the blue -shaded area. The 
dark-green area is one of low 
salinity frequented by murres, 
puffins, and kittiwakes, which feed 
on its high fish populations. 



area has been created as a result of 
the enormous energy released by 
the collision of three tectonic plates 
— the Pacific Ocean plate, the 
Siberian plate, and the North 
American plate. The crushing force 
produced by the movements of 
these three plates has produced 
volcanic activity throughout Ber- 
ingia, including the formation of 
the Aleutian-Commander Islands 
chain where vulcanism is still pres- 
ent and active. Vast extrusions of 
lava cooled rapidly to form fine- 
grained rocks; ice and pounding 
waves then broke them down to 
rubble. 

The present landscape along the 
indented coasts is one of spectacu- 
lar heaps of rubble and sheer 
cliffs that rise hundreds of feet. 
The rubble, ledges, and crevices 
supply countless nesting sites for 
sea birds. Pelagic cormorants and 
black-legged kittiwakes occupy the 
smaller ledges, and common murres 
crowd the wider ones, their nests 
so densely packed together that the 
birds can scarcely find room to 
perch. Pigeon guillemots nest in the 
small holes between boulders at the 
base of the cliffs. Homed puffins 
and parakeet auklets nest deep 
under boulders or in the larger 
crevices where they are able to es- 
cape predation by arctic foxes. 
Parakeet auklets return to the same 
nest sites every year and can locate 



them even when the rocks are 
buried under snow and ice. Day 
after day, the birds congregate in 
pairs or bickering groups on the 
snow slides covering the rock rub- 
ble. As soon as the snow melts, 
they vanish beneath the boulders. 

Even given the climatic varia- 
tion of Beringia, and its apparently 
limitless supply of nesting sites, 
high numbers and populations of 
bird species could not exist there 
without an abundant food supply. 
The Bering Sea is an area of high 
biological productivity. The pro- 
liferation of plankton in the water&apos;s 
upper sunlit, or euphotic, zone is an 
indispensable key to the biological 
system. As the ice breaks up in the 
spring, an unusually rich supply of 
plant plankton blooms. One expla- 
nation might be that low tempera- 
tures inhibit plant respiration 
(which consumes energy) to a 
greater degree than they inhibit 
photosynthesis (which traps en- 
ergy). By early spring, high 
amounts of plant plankton have 
accumulated, and the resultant con- 
centrations nourish crustaceans and 
small fish, which, in turn, attract 
sea birds and mammals. 

Many of the mineral nutrients 
necessary for production of plank- 
ton come from the Pacific Ocean 
via the deep trenches between the 
Aleutian Islands. The currents 
that carry the nutrients form the 



Bering Sea gyre. The typically 
strong winds of the south Bering 
Sea whip the waters of this slow- 
moving vortex and bring the nutri- 
ents to the surface. Part of this 
current flows over the continental 
slope and onto the continental 
shelf, where more nutrients are 
added by the heavy spring runoflF 
from the Anadyr River of Siberia 
and the Yukon and Kuskokwim 
rivers of Alaska. This water mass 
mingles with deep water from the 
Anadyr Basin and flows north past 
the western end of Saint Lawrence 
Island, through the Bering Strait, 
and into the Chukchi Sea. 

During the long days of the sub- 
arctic summer, the nutrients car- 
ried in the turbulent waters produce 
an abundance of plankton. Re- 
searchers have found that primary 
productivity north of the Aleutian 
Islands creates 250 milligrams of 
carbon per square meter of water 
surface per day. In the Bering Sea 



Nesting kittiwakes tolerate 

disturbances better than other 

Bering Sea birds. But as the area 

experiences more traffic from 

boats and planes, researchers 

e.xpect that mortality among 

the young will increase.

gyre, they have measured the pro- 
ductivity at 350 milligrams. For 
comparison&apos;s sake, only 70 milli- 
grams of carbon are fixed per 
square meter of water surface per 
day in the open seas. 

The amount of productivity on 
the western side of the Bering 
Strait is even higher. Here, re- 
searchers have determined that 
plant plankton fixes 1,000 milli- 
grams of carbon per square meter of 
water per day. Although at the 
low end of the measure of pro- 
ductivity of the world&apos;s best-known 
upwelling systems, such as the one 
off the coast of Peru, the amount 
of carbon does make this area one 
of the most productive in the world. 
Off Peru, the cold waters that 
flow north from Antarctica fix 
11,200 milligrams of carbon per 
square meter per day. This high 
productivity has resulted in rich 
fisheries and millions of cormor- 
ants, pelicans, and boobies. The 
situation in the Bering Sea is 
similar. 

One group of organisms that 
takes advantage of the local produc- 
tivity in the northernmost Bering 
Sea and Bering Strait is the 
benthos — bottom-dwelling worms, 
clams, snails, barnacles, starfish, 
and shrimplike crustaceans. These 
animals feed on the remains of plant 
or animal plankton that constantly 
sink from the sunlit zone above or 
are washed into shallow water. In 
turn, many sea birds and mammals 
consume the benthos, particularly 
in the shallows. Sea ducks often 
dive for bivalves and crustaceans, 
and shore birds probe for worms 
and clams on the mud and sand 
flats of lagoons, inlets, and es- 
tuaries. 

The distribution of these benthic 
animals is patchy in the Bering Sea, 
but their abundance in the Chirikof 
Basin is spectacular. Whereas bot- 



Although kittiwakes nest on narrow 
ledges, relatively few chicks die 
from falls because they rarely 
wander from the nest. Most often 
they sit or stand motionless, their 
hacks to the cliff face. 



tom samples from Anadyr Gulf and 
Bristol Bay in the Bering Sea pro- 
duce 470 and 55 grams of benthos 
per square meter, respectively, the 
Chirikof Basin bottom produces 
900 grams in the same size sample. 

Fish, as well as sea birds and 
mammals, feed off the benthos, 
producing heavy catches for Japan 
and Russia, the two nations whose 
fishing fleets harvest the area most 
eflficiently. Although some 270 
fish species inhabit the Bering Sea, 
the principal one taken is pollack, 
which, since the demise of the 
Peruvian anchovy, has the dubious 
distinction of being the most 
heavily utilized fish species in the 
world. Other abundant species are 
flounder, halibut, and hake, all 
bottom fish inhabiting the edge of 
the continental shelf; salmon in 
Bristol Bay; and herring in the mid- 
Bering Sea surface waters. About 
4Vi million tons of fish are taken 
annually in the entire area. This 
compares with some 500,000 tons 
hauled each year from the waters 
off New England. 

The reasons for bird species 
diversity in the Bering Sea are, 
however, far more complex than 
the mere availability of nesting 
sites and food resources. Other, 
more subtle influences, which have 
long been at work, have allowed 
more than thirty-four sea bird spe- 
cies to nest here for centuries. Still 
other forces have recently led addi- 
tional species to settle in the 
Bering Sea area. Each year, some 
species — bar-tailed godwits, wheat- 
ers, arctic warblers, and curlew 
sandpipers — migrate to the Alaskan 
coast from Siberia. Other species 
such as dovekies and black guil- 
lemots have come from the eastern 
Arctic Ocean. Some of these have 
frequented the Bering Sea for dec- 
ades; others, for only a few years. 
The reasons are not yet known. It 
does appear, however, that some of 
the new settlers came to the Bering 
Sea merely because they straggled 
outside of their usual migratory 
routes. 

In most cases, the great majority 
of a particular population will fol- 
low the same habits year after year, 
whether it be to remain in the same 
place throughout the seasons or to 
migrate during the spring and fall. 



A few individuals, however, will 
become colonizers. One example is 
the case of the herring gull popula- 
tion in the mouth of the Saint Law- 
rence River in eastern Canada. The 
great majority of these gulls nest 
within fifteen miles of where they 
hatched. Occasionally, however, 
we have found a few pairs from this 
region nesting in Massachusetts. In 
a comparable manner, a few birds of 
various species may wander into the 
Bering Sea from other areas. 

Such wanderers, together with 
species long endemic to the Bering 
Sea, may be a source of the species 
adding to the wide diversity of sea 
bird life here. In times of disaster — 
food shortage, environmental dis- 
ruption, or climatic change, for ex- 
ample — a few members of a popu- 
lation may colonize a new site. Or 
they may have moved to the site 
before the disaster struck. But the 
majority of the population, remain- 
ing in the traditional habitat, will 
be killed off. Occasionally, how- 
ever, it is just these birds, the stay- 
at-home conservatives, that survive. 
This may have been the case in 
Beringia and might account for the 
many species that have traditionally 
nested in the Bering Sea. When the 
Pleistocene ice sheets moved south 
some 20,000 years ago, parts of 
present-day Alaska and the Bering 
Sea escaped glaciation , e ven though 
most of Canada and much of the 
northern half of the United States 
did not. Botanists have concluded 
that this ice-free zone was at least 
partially responsible for Alaska&apos;s 
diverse present-day flora. This rea- 
soning could well be extended to 
include the Bering Sea&apos;s high num- 
ber of endemic species of sea birds. 

That such diversity of sea birds, 
as well as other animals and plants, 
occurs in such high latitudes as the 
Bering Sea is remarkable consid- 
ering the paucity of species in many 
other high-latitude regions. From a 
comprehensive ecological view- 
point, however, the diversity fol- 
lows the generalization that species 
abundance is greatest where re- 
gional topography and local cli- 
mates are varied, where biological 
productivity is high, and where his- 
torical accidents have allowed the 
perpetuation and enrichment of 
flora and fauna. □

Buzkashi 

by Asen Balikci 
photographs by Jim Sheldon 



To local chiefs in northern 
Afghanistan, a game that 
resembles a cavalry charge 
is a contest for prestige 

Buzkashi, which means &quot;goat 
dragging&quot; or &quot;grabbing,&quot; is an ex- 
ceptionally violent game that tribes 
in northern Afghanistan (Afghan 
Turkestan) play on horseback. Be- 
sides expressing the fierce and 
incessant social rivalry that preoc- 
cupies Afghans, buzkashi also indi- 
cates the important role that the 
horse has played in central Asian 
history. Early armies of nomadic 
horsemen could assemble quickly, 
cover great distances, attack, and at 
full gallop and without dismounting, 
sweep up women, animals, and 
plunder. Genghis Khan used cavalry 
to establish an empire that stretched 
from northern China to the Mediter- 
ranean. He then employed mounted 
couriers to transmit orders and news 
over his empire&apos;s routes. 

Although buzkashi&apos;s historical 
origins are unclear, they may lie in a 
traditional exercise of central Asian 
horsemen, who trained by riding, in 
turn, past a ditch and attempting to 
pick up a beheaded goat, or buz. No 
one knows when this exercise be- 
came a game in which all riders si- 
multaneously attempted to seize the 
goat, which is now a calf carcass. 

Of the many Afghan sayings con- 
cerning horses, one is, &quot;Better to 
have a poor rider on a good horse 
than a good rider on a poor horse,&quot; 
an expression of the Afghan belief 
that buzkashi belongs to the horse. 
In northern Afghanistan, the horse 
is the focus of complex personal 
and tribal ambitions and rivalries. 
Chiefs feel that their honor is 
closely tied to the qualities of their 
horses and will spare no amount of 
expense and energy on feeding and 
exercising their animals — and on 
the rituals surrounding them. Horse 



racing, once an important form of 
competition, has largely been re- 
placed by the more violent pastime 
of buzkashi. One Afghan explained: 
&quot; Every thing in buzkashi is rivalry . &quot; &quot; 

The groups involved in buzkashi 
on the vast plain of northern Af- 
ghanistan are primarily Uzbek and 
Turkoman (Turkic-speaking) pop- 
ulations, seminomadic sheep breed- 
ers and dry farmers who migrated 
across the Amu Darya (ancient Oxus 
River) from Central Asia. Among 
them live large groups of Persian- 
speaking Tajik, who excel at irriga- 
tion farming, and more recent set- 
tlers like the Hazara, of Mongol 
origin, and the Pushtuns, who are 
either farmers or nomads. 

Hence, in a day&apos;s walk in the 
Narin-Burka area of Baghlan Prov- 
ince in northeastern Afghanistan, a 
traveler encounters a mosaic of 
people, languages, and customs. 
Along the Narin River in the low- 
lands, Pushtun settlers occupy the 
best-irrigated fields. On the small, 
dry plateaus nearby, Pushtun no- 
mads pitch their black tents. Slightly 
higher, but drawing irrigation water 
from the same river, live Hazara 
settlers. Higher still, on a plateau 
without irrigation water, reside 
Uzbek horse and sheep breeders 
who summer on their mountain graz- 
ing sites in round felt yurts. Farther 
up, on the slopes of the gorges of the 
Hindu Kush, are the stone houses of 
Tajik gardeners, and in the moun- 
tains above them, at an altitude of 
nearly 9,000 feet, the Gujjar, who 
practice no agriculture, graze their 
goats. 

The original inhabitants of the 
area were the Uzbek, but after the 
Afghan government had consoli- 
dated its power in Turkestan at the 
beginning of the twentieth century, 
other. non-Turkic groups slowly 
began to settle there. Now Narin- 
Burka contains the three main seg- 
ments of Afghan society: nomads. 



sedentary farmers, and city-bazaar 
communities, the economic and 
administrative centers where hand- 
crafted goods are made and im- 
ported goods and local produce 
redistributed. In the city-bazaars 
reside almost all government 
officers — the regional governor, the 
police chief, the military comman- 
dant, the tax collector, the chief jus- 
tice, the regional school superin- 
tendent. 

The area&apos;s local political leader- 
ship is represented by the chiefs, 
or khans, of groups of kinsmen 
that anthropologists call lineages. 
The chiefs compete endlessly 
among themselves for prestige and 
dominance in every area: wealth, 
tribal leadership, land, hospitality, 
entertainment, wisdom, insolence 
to government officials, owning the 
best buzkashi horses, and hiring the 
best buzkashi riders. Buzkashi is 
one expression of the chiefs&quot; inter- 
minable rivalry, but the game itself 
can independently inspire an- 
tagonisms. 

The office of chief is not heredi- 
tary, and there are no clear-cut 
rules of succession. Local chiefs 
actually have no well-defined polit- 
ical or judicial powers, yet their 
influence as brokers in political and 
economic matters is substantial. 
Chiefdom is based on wealth — 
usually amassed, sometimes 
inherited — and on a quality called 
khanzada. literally, descendant of a 
chief. Within a particular lineage, 
practically all the rich, or would- 
be-rich, aspire to become chiefs. 



During a buzkashi match each 
rider, or chapandaz, tries to seize 
the buz, which means &quot;goat&quot; but 

is actually a calf carcass, and 
break away to score.

This ambition harnesses an indi- 
vidual&apos;s entire energy and encour- 
ages ruthlessness and constant 
political scheming. 

Once a man becomes a chief, he 
dare not lower his guard, for all 
chiefs compete against each other 
for supremacy, employing innumer- 
able stratagems: stealing a rival&apos;s 
fiancee, burning his fields, purchas- 
ing evil charms to destroy his 
flocks, luring his clients with gifts 
and promises, keeping superbly 
decorated guesthouses, providing 
lavish entertainment, and most im- 
portant, keeping the best biizkashi 
horses mounted by the best riders 
{chapandaz). Serious and often 
deadly rivalry is the essence of 



Afghan social life, giving it a theat- 
rical quahty reminiscent of displays 
of wealth in West Coast Indian pot- 
latches. Rivalry is by no means 
limited to the rich. According to 
one popular aphorism, &quot;A woman 
is a rival of a woman, a shepherd is 
a rival of a shepherd, and a chief is 
the rival of a chief.&quot; 

Traditionally , concern with horses 
and the associated biizkashi game 
was part of Turkic-Uzbek culture. 
Non-Turkic settlers in the Narin- 
Burka area quickly borrowed the 
main elements of this horse com- 
plex, which is now firmly entrenched 
in common regional culture. In 
Narin-Burka, people keep three 
kinds of horses. They never boast 



of, indeed, rarely speak of, work- 
horses. Considered inferior ani- 
mals, workhorses are used for load- 
ing goods, riding to the bazaar, 
operating oil mills, and very rarely, 
plowing. They are considered lowly 
animals and are often worked to 
exhaustion. 

Narin-Burka&apos;s riding horses be- 
long to a higher class. People know 
these horses as individuals and 
can describe all their characteris- 
tics: color, height, shape of head or 
legs, speed and endurance, past per- 
formances. Pushtuns have had a 
predilection for speedy riding 
horses, and one local tribe breeds 
them. In Pushtun areas of southern 
Afghanistan, ceremonial occasions

include formal horse races and 
spectacular equestrian exercises. 
Pushtun settlers in the north con- 
tinued these practices until they 
were recently replaced by buzkashi. 
However, I came across one inci- 
dent of a spontaneous race. 

Haji Omar, chief of the Laken- 
khel lineage of the Pushtuns in 
Narin, was riding back from bazaar 
with his client Qui and his rival 
Wakil Abdulajan. Qui owned a 
mare of excellent reputation, which 
Haji Omar was riding, while Qui 
had mounted Haji Omar&apos;s sturdy 
stallion. Wakil Abdulajan was trot- 
ting near them when he suddenly 
pushed ahead. A race began. Haji 
Omar excitedly whipped his horse. 



and Qui followed suit. As Wakil Ab- 
dulajan moved ahead, the lagging 
Haji Omar felt his prestige en- 
dangered, and shouted at Qui, 
&quot;Catch this scoundrel; push my 
horse as fast as you can.&quot; Wakil 
Abdulajan&apos;s lead lengthened, and 
Haji Omar&apos;s anger grew ac- 
cordingly: &quot;Qui, dismount, you 
are shaming my horse, and you will 
see how I am going to catch that 
infidel.&quot; They changed horses, and 
mounted on his own mare. Qui 
overtook the rival. Although Haji 
Omar finished last, his prestige re- 
mained undiminished because his 
rival had been defeated. At any 
time, latent rivalries can inspire 
such contests. 

The importance of buzkashi in 
chiefs&apos; rivalries means that in 
Narin-Burka, horses bred for the 
game are highly prized animals. At 
a colt&apos;s birth, it is not allowed to 
touch the ground, lest &quot;its wings be 
taken away.&quot; Generally, only stal- 
lions are used for games. During 
informal buzkashi games, a young 
horse is trained to dodge, attack, 
and respond to its rider. 

In 1955, the Afghan Olympic 
Committee made traditional buz- 
kashi an organized sport. This of- 
ficial form now has regulations gov- 
erning all its aspects: who can 
play, team size, length and sched- 
ule of games, scoring, field size, 
hrcsdmgoi buzkashi stallions, play- 
offs, and championships. 

But village buzkashi has few rigid 
rules. Playing grounds, located near 
most villages and towns in Af- 
ghanistan&apos;s seven northern prov- 
inces, should be grass covered and 
free of rocks, to avoid hurting 
horses&apos; hoofs. Buzkashi in Narin- 
Burka is a winter game; the season 
usually begins in the autumn, after 
the rainfall, and concludes shortly 
after the Muslim New Year&apos;s Day, 
March 2 1 . If playing went on during 
Afghanistan&apos;s very hot summers, 
the horses would suffer and clouds 



of dust from dry fields would blind 
the riders. 

All summer the horses are kept in 
courtyards to rest, but in October 
they are taken out and exercised — 
at first for only a few minutes a day, 
but working up to progressively 
longer and faster trips. In Narin- 
Burka, their oflF-season diet is clover 
and barley, and in winter their ra- 
tion of barley is much larger. 

Late November brings the first, 
short buzkashi matches. Only in 
mid-December does serious buz- 
kashi begin. Every Friday after- 
noon in the villages, the horseown- 
ers (who are khans of various 
ranks), the mounted chapandaz 
(rarely including more than a dozen 
active players), and a crowd of on- 
lookers gather on the game grounds. 
In one version of the game, the 
field itself has no precise bound- 
aries. On one side stands a line of 
mounted horseowners, elderly and 
influential people, and government 
officials. In addition to these nota- 
bles, several rows of spectators sit 
on the ground. In front of the elders 
is the goal, a circle about ten feet in 
diameter, outlined with gravel or 
sand. In the opposite direction, at a 
distance that depends on the field 
size and the number of horses, a 
pole is stuck in the ground. 

The game president (rais) places 
the buz in the goal. The chapandaz 
then struggle briefly until one of 
them manages to grab the carcass. 
The lucky horseman is then sup- 
posed to round the pole and return 
to the goal. If he manages to throw 
the buz inside the circle, he wins a 
point. En route, however, he has to 
face the other chapandaz. who try 
to take the buz away from him. The 
ensuing violent clashes are the 
game&apos;s raison d&apos;etre, the enact- 
ment of horseowners&apos; political 
rivalries. Chapandaz say that the 
horses develop their own rivalries 
and will spontaneously bite and 
kick each other. This game may 
continue indefinitely, until the buz 
or two or three carcasses have been 
torn to pieces. 

In Narin-Burka, most horse- 
owners pay cash for their animals. 
The average price of a good work- 
horse is 3,000 afghanis (the ex- 
change rate is currently forty-five 
afghanis to the dollar), while an

as a great blow to his honor. 



exceptional buzkashi horse can sell 
for about 60.000 afghanis. Narin- 
Burka&apos;s buzkashi horses have long 
pedigrees. Some are bred locally, 
others purchased on the plains 
along the Amu Darya, northwest of 
Narin-Burka. Two influential Uzbek 
chiefs breed buzkashi horses, but 
only sell in distant regions where 
they can command high prices. 

Some owners frequently change 
horses. Haji Omar once owned a 



very good horse, apparently un- 
defeated. His rival, Wakil Abdul- 
ajan, swore publicly to defeat the 
animal, and in the eflFort, he bought 
and sold over twenty horses. Only 
his death finally canceled his plan. 
A chief places his buzkashi horse 
in the center of his large courtyard. 
When guests arrive, they see the 
horse first and comment eloquently 
on its virtues. The owner&apos;s swell of 
pride is great, but no greater than 
his shame when his horse has per- 
formed poorly on the field. One 
Afghan declared, &quot;It is better to 
shoot a chief with a gun straight in 
his face, than to tell him loudly on 
the buzkashi field that his horse is 
weak and not fast enough.&quot; A chief 
will consult a shaman, who goes 
into trance to predict whether a 



young horse will become a good 
competitor. Chiefs also pay other 
holy men fat fees for protective 
amulets that are hung on the horse&apos;s 
neck. Certain individual horses are 
famous not only in Narin-Burka, 
but all over northeastern Afghani- 
stan. One is the undefeated &quot;golden 
horse,&quot; whose pedigree supposedly 
originates in Samarkand. People 
say that after every success, the 
golden horse dances like a colt all 
the way home. 

After the horse, the second im- 
portant factor in buzkashi is the 
chapandaz. Chapandaz are re- 
cruited during informal local games, 
played without rais near villages. 
To earn a prize, a rider must seize 
the buz, and breaking free of the 
pack, ride away in any direction. 
Young boys enter these games, ob- 
serving the methods of experienced 
chapandaz, who are not considered 
ripe until their mid-thirties or early 
forties, and who frequently com- 
pete in their fifties. The older 
chapandaz casually instruct the 
boys. Chiefs stand by, on the look- 
out for agile recruits. 

A chief spares no expense to se- 
cure the finest animals; he also 
safeguards his prestige by going 
after the best riders. Usually, every 
chapandaz is attached to a partic- 
ular chief, who oflFers him gifts and 
protection. 

Relations between chapandaz 
and chief are always cordial and 
friendly. A careful chief wants his 
chapandaz to have the best avail- 
able equipment. Before the buz- 
kashi season opens, the chapandaz 
receives a fine new coat, a fur hat, 
and woolen socks. On the playing 
field, as soon as the chapandaz has 
scored a point, the chief announces 
his gift or prize — usually money, 
occasionally a turban. His whip 
raised high to call attention to his 
score, the chapandaz rides forward 
to take his prize as the onlookers 
leap to their feet, cheering his name. 
During the season, the chapandaz 
receives additional presents of grain 
and money. One wealthy chief was 
so fond of his chapandaz that he 
gave him his daughter in marriage. 
Unless he is a close relative of the 
chief, the chapandaz does not 
supervise the daily care of the horse 
or horses that he habitually rides. 



60 




Chiefs believe that only kinsmen 
can take proper care of horses. Nor 
does a chapandaz ride only his 
master&apos;s animal. During a game, he 
will ride one horse for no more than 
ten or fifteen minutes. Then the 
horse is allowed to rest, and the 
chapandaz mounts horses belong- 
ing to his master&apos;s kinsmen, politi- 
cal allies, and clients. These horses 
stand saddled near the field and are 
brought to the chapandaz, who may 
accept or refuse freely. Chapandaz 
may even mount horses belonging 
to their master&apos;s rivals, although 
during important regional games 
such behavior might be considered 
bad taste. In the Burka area, only 
one chapandaz receives a regular 
salary from his master, and there- 
fore is not allowed to mount a rival&apos; s 
horse. 

The chief must also watch over 
his rider&apos;s safety, ior chapandaz are 
rivals to each other by definition. In 
principle, every chapandaz strug- 
gles alone and competes with all 
other chapandaz in the arena. In

sidelines cheer their favorite 
riders. At right, a chapandaz, who

scored, proudly shows off his prize 
of a quilted coat and a bag of soap. 



actual fact, chapandaz form three 
kinds of coalitions. Some outstand- 
ing riders become so well known 
that they travel to Kabul, the capi- 
tal, to play before the president. 
These players adopt haughty atti- 
tudes befitting stars, and acquire 
young admirers, who act as their 
satellites on the playing field, col- 
laborating in game strategy. 

A second kind of coalition re- 
flects a chief&apos;s political alliances. If 
he is powerful, he can surround 
himself with lesser chiefs, whose 
chapandaz support his own riders. 
During regional games, chapandaz 
from the same tribe will align them- 




T 




selves in a third type of coalition. 
Uzbeic chapandaz will help each 
other against Hazara and Pushtun 
riders, and vice versa. 

In the arena, a coalition of cha- 
pandaz may use all sorts of tricks to 
foil a dangerous rival. When he 
bends down to grab the buz, several 
horsemen may make their horses 
rear to strike him as he heaves 
himself up. As he rushes toward the 
goal, buz in hand, his enemies may 
cause a collision. Under these cir- 
cumstances, the chief can scream, 
announce irregular behavior, and 
call for the intervention of the mis. 
He may also resort to lobbying, 
passing gifts of money among other 
chapandaz, and eventually estab- 
lishing an ad hoc countercoalition. 

In Narin-Burka, two ethnic 
groups, the Awkhana Pushtuns and 
the Kogaday Hazara, practice one- 
upmanship by making extravagant 
efforts to recruit talented riders. 
For a long time, the Kogaday were 
far superior, thanks to three out- 
standing chapandaz, Jabar, Baz- 
mir, and Bazmir&apos;s brother, the great 
Bazgul. Bazgul was extremely ar- 
rogant, respecting nothing and no 
one, not even the Pushtun elders. 
He and the other two Kogaday in- 
flicted defeat after defeat on the 
Pushtuns, until they could not even 
touch the buz- 

Haji Omar, chief of the Pushtuns, 
could no longer endure this humilia- 
tion and declared that something 
had to be done. In council, the 
elders decided that buying better 
horses was not the answer, and that 
the only feasible strategy was to 
break the coalition of the three Ko- 
gaday chapandaz by attracting one 
to the Pushtun side. 

Since Bazmir and Bazgul were 
brothers, they were considered in- 
corruptible. So the Pushtun cha- 
pandaz brought Jabar presents, in- 
vited him to feasts, slaughtered fat 
sheep in his honor, and flattered

him from the buz. 



him, saying that they wanted him to 
teach them. For Jabar, this was a 
dangerous proposition: if he ac- 
cepted, the Kogaday reprisals 
would be terrible. At this point, the 
Pushtun elders intervened and of- 
fered Jabar full protection, cash 
compensation for any losses, and 
in the event of a fight or feud, the 
support of the whole Pushtun line- 
age, guns in hand. 

The strategy worked: Jabar 
joined the Pushtun chapandaz. 
pulled the buz from Bazgul&apos;s hands, 
and saved the honor of the Push- 
tuns. Heartened, Paindamangal, 
another Pushtun chapandaz, 
started using tricks against Bazgul. 
Paindamangal would lock the leg of 
the buz against his stirrup and place 
his foot so that Bazgul could not 
pull the buz out. While in full gal- 
lop, Paindamangal would counter 
Bazgul&apos;s pull by sliding down the 
horse&apos;s opposite side, right under 
its belly. The Pushtuns say that 
since then Bazgul has behaved like 
a normal human being. 

Because the reputations of cha- 
pandaz go up and down, even the 
greatest live in fear of enemies, in- 
juries, and bad luck. They fre- 
quently visit the shaman to ask the 
outcome of forthcoming games, and 
to learn whether their rivals have 
strong protective talismans or some 
evil medicine that will bring misfor- 
tune. In trance, the shaman calls his 
spirit protectors; with their help, he 
tries to &quot;raise the star&quot; of a cha- 
pandaz, to make him feel strong 
and confident. If the strongest 
magic is invoked, the chapandaz&apos;s 
rivals in the arena may suddenly 
see him as an enormously powerful 
giant. 

During play, the chief can do little 
except watch, pray, curse, and 
perhaps award prizes. But buzkashi 
could not exist without wealthy 
chiefs. Year round, chiefs breed, 
buy, and sell horses, lavish them 
with care, try to attract the ablest 
chapandaz and secure their loyalty, 
provide horses and riders with the 
best gear. Since these are expensive 
projects, buzkashi is an aristocratic 
game, a political strategy. If one 
chief&apos;s prestige begins to approach 
another&apos;s, the two automatically 
become buzkashi rivals. 

One great Pushtun chief in Narin, 



Arbab Jonmamat, married his son 
to a girl from a village near the 
bottom of Awkhana valley. The 
girl&apos;s family gave a feast in their 
house, but did not invite the La- 
kenkhel lineage. Its chief, Haji 
Omar, saw a chance to avenge this 
insult when the wedding proces- 
sion, which brought the bride to her 
husband&apos;s house, had to pass 
through his territory. The proces- 
sion was preceded by a group of 
buzkashi players, kinsmen of the 
bride and bridegroom. Throughout 
the singing and merrymaking, the 
riders played informal buzkashi 
continuously. 

When the joyous procession 
reached Lakenkhel, Haji Omar or- 
dered his chapandaz to bring their 
horses and capture the wedding 
party&apos;s buz, which they did easily. 
Jonmamat hurried over and begged 
them not to ruin the feast and to re- 
turn the buz. After waiting long 
enough to humiliate Jonmamat, the 
Lakenkhel returned the buz. When 
the game resumed, the Lakenkhel 
again attacked and took the buz. 
This time, they refused to return it. 

Besides the chiefs, the other 
members of a. buzkashi audience are 
also important to the game. This 
audience is hardly passive. Varied 
ethnic groups and members of dif- 
ferent lineages, each supporting 
their own chapandaz, will scream, 
shout, encourage, and criticize. 
Galloping horses may overrun the 
semicircle of onlookers, wounding 
some. If a quarrel breaks out among 
chapandaz, the spectators imme- 
diately join in, and as sticks and 
stones fly in all directions, a gen- 
eral battle begins. Buzkashi&apos; s vio- 
lence brings to mind medieval 
tournaments. 

In recent years, buzkashi games 
have become more frequent. At the 
end of the nineteenth century, dur- 
ing the last part of Afghanistan&apos;s 
feudal period, tribal chiefs faced a 
weak central government, and 
fought continually among them- 
selves for supremacy. Since the 
beginning of the twentieth century, 
the central government has gradu- 
ally grown stronger. Simulta- 
neously, buzkashi has replaced ac- 
tual warfare as the most visible 
manifestation of the chiefs&apos; politi- 
cal ambitions. D

The Elegant Symmetry of Crystals 

by Rodney C. Ewing 



Despite their variety, 
all these substances fall 
within an amazingly 
small number of classes 

Even a short visit to a collection 
of minerals and gemstones will im- 
press the viewer with the beauty 
and diversity of the specimens. 
There are about 2,500 naturally 
occurring minerals. Each is unique 
in size, color, and form, but the 
careful observer immediately be- 
gins to notice the similarities. It is 
these similarities that allow us to 
classify minerals into diflferent 
groups, according to their con- 
stituent atoms and the arrangement 
of these atoms within the crystal 
structure. The shape and orienta- 
tion of well-formed crystal faces 
provide the key to understanding 
the internal structure of minerals, 
and it is on these crystal faces that 
we will first focus our attention. 

In the earliest stages of natural 
science, well-formed crystals were 
placed in the same category as fos- 
sils, being considered &quot;tricks of 
Nature&quot; placed on earth by God to 
test the faith of man. Ancient 
descriptions of crystal forms, 
such as those by Pliny the Elder 
(a.d. 23-79), were brief and barely 
referred to the shape or arrange- 
ment of the crystals&apos; faces. Not 
until the seventeenth century were 
the first critical observations made. 
Then Nicolaus Steno (a Latinized 
version of the name of the Danish 
physician Niels Stensen) noted that 
crystal growth &quot;does not take 
place from within, as in plants, but 
only by the deposition of minute 
particles, brought from the outside 
by some liquid, on the external 
planes of the crystal.&quot; This was the 

te, photographed by Henry Jansen 



first eflFort to clearly separate the 
mechanisms of organic growth 
from those of crystal growth. In his 
study of quartz, Steno found that, 
regardless of their shape, similar 
faces make the same angle with one 
another. That precept was the first 
formal statement of what is now 
known as Steno&apos; s law, or the law 
of constancy of interfacial angles: 
the angles between corresponding 
faces on different cyrstals of one 
substance are constant. 

These two observations on the 
growth of crystals and the relation- 
ship between faces mark the begin- 
ning of the science of crystallog- 
raphy and the efforts of crystal- 
lographers to systematize crystal 
forms . Much influenced by the suc- 
cess of Linnaeus&apos; s classification of 
the organic world, eighteenth- 
century crystallographers con- 
tinued to measure and classify 
minerals. By 1800, five hundred 
substances had been carefully 
measured and described. In the 
same way that Linnaeus&apos;s Systema 
naturae was woven into Darwin&apos;s 
theories, these early morphological 
studies became the basis in the 
middle of the nineteenth century 
for the mathematical classification 
of all the known minerals into 
thirty-two groups. 

That well-formed crystals, with 
their strikingly planar faces, al- 
though diverse in shape, size, and 
form, could be grouped into only 
thirty-two classes is an important 
key to understanding the internal 
atomic structure of minerals. The 
same principles that limit the ar- 
rangements of repetitive patterns 
in wallpaper and tiles can also be 
used to classify crystal forms. The 
trick to understanding the limita- 



tions on two-dimensional patterns 
or the arrangement of three-dimen- 
sional crystal faces is to look for 
some relationship between the 
different component parts. Essen- 
tial to the process is the concept 
of symmetry — the exact repetition 
in size, form, and arrangement of 
constituent parts on opposite sides 
of a plane, a line, or a point. 

In dealing with crystals, we 
must look for simple geometric 
processes that will relate individual 
crystal faces to each other. These 
geometric steps — called symmetry 
operations — might involve such 
movements as rotation or mirror 
reflection. The limitation on the 
results of symmetry operations and 
their possible combinations is the 
cause of the limited number of 
crystal classes. The beauty of this 
approach is that it is independent of 
the minerals themselves and yet 
confirms a classification system 
that was originally based on years 
of careful and tedious observations 
of the number, shape, and orienta- 
tion of crystal faces on mineral 
specimens. Before discussing the 
classification system further, let us 
take a quick look at the internal 
structure of minerals and identify 
their basic building blocks. 

The arrangement of atoms in 
minerals is much the same as the 
regular, repetitive, two-dimensional 
patterns of wallpaper, Moorish 
ornamentation, or the etchings of 
the late Dutch artist M. C. Escher, 
except that in minerals the arrange- 
ment is three dimensional. The 
regularity and order of the atoms in 
minerals result from the lower total 
energy of a crystalline solid as com- 
pared with the disorder of a Tiquid 
or gas because of its higher energy.

To describe any regular pattern, be 
it that of wallpaper or atoms, it is 
not necessary to portray the entire 
pattern; it is sufficient instead to 
choose some basic motif (there may 
be several) that, when repeated 
continuously through two or three 
dimensions, will re-create the 
whole. In minerals, the three- 
dimensional motif that fills this role 
is called the unit cell. 

The importance of the concept 
of the unit cell was first realized by 
Rene Just Haiiy, an eighteenth- 
century French crystallographer. 
Many minerals have a variety of 
crystal forms. Haiiy noted that the 
variation for any particular sub- 
stance might be explained if the dif- 
ferent forms resulted from different 
stacking sequences of the basic 
unit cells, or as he called them, 
molecules constituantes. From the 
cleavage angles, that is, angles be- 
tween planes along which a crystal 
might break, Haiiy deduced that 
there were six different but primi- 
tive forms of the unit cells. Further, 
he showed that if crystal faces con- 
sist of a stacking of unit cells, then 
the angles between the faces will be 
determined by the relative dimen- 
sions of the unit cell and the par- 
ticular type of stacking sequence. 

The unit cell not only determines 
the angles between the faces of a 
crystal but also exhibits all the 
chemical and physical properties of 
the mineral. The dimensions of the 
unit cell, on the order of one 
hundred millionth of a centimeter, 
and its contents vary from sub- 
stance to substance, but each cell 



The periodic drawings of M.C. 
Escher are often used by 
crystallographers to teach the 
principles of symmetry. The white 
diamond superimposed on this 
design outlines the motif or unit 
cell, of the pattern. Repetition of 
this unit cell in directions parallel 
to the sides of the diamond 
generates the entire pattern. When 
the unit cell is rotated 360° 
around axes located at the white 
triangles, the pattern is 
repeated three times. 



is a building block containing all 
the information required for the 
construction of the entire mineral. 

Within each unit cell, there may 
be additional geometric principles 
in operation that relate the posi- 
tions of the atoms within the cell 
to one another and thereby create 
additional symmetries. The pres- 
ence of symmetry within a unit cell 
provides crystallographers with a 
precise shorthand for describing the 
structure of crystalline matter. In- 
stead of describing the position of 
every atom throughout a given 
crystal, a number that would be at 
least in the billions, a crystallog- 
rapher need only locate the atoms 
in a single unit cell. If atoms of the 
same kind within that cell can be 
related to one another by the rules 
of symmetry, it is sufficient to 
locate only one of the atoms within 
each unit cell. The remaining 
atoms of the same kind can then be 
generated by the application of 
symmetry operations. 

Thus, a determination of the 
positions of particular atoms within 
a unit cell, combined with the ap- 
propriate symmetry operations, 
makes possible the description of 
the structure of a specific mineral 
with a beautiful economy of 
thought. The real saving in time and 
effort, however, comes with the 
realization that although symmetry 
operations in a unit cell may exist in 
combination with one another, the 
total number of allowed combina- 
tions of symmetry elements within 
the unit cell is only 230. These 230 
combinations are known as space 
groups. The number of possible 
symmetry combinations describing 
the arrangement of crystal faces 
is more limited — numbering 32 — 
because of the restriction that imag- 
inary lines representing axes of 
rotation and the planes of mirror 
images must intersect at a common 
point. For the purpose of illustra- 
tion let us return to two-dimen- 
sional examples. 

A student of repetitive patterns 
such as those found in wallpaper is 
confronted with a seemingly infi- 
nite diversity. If instead of consid- 
ering the patterns themselves, we 
concentrate on the types of sym- 
metry in the patterns, regularities 
quickly become apparent. There 



Tiasy&amp;Symmetry: The Periodic Drawings of MC. Esct^er, by Caroline H. MacGillavry, Harry N. Abrams, Inc. 
urtesy of Escher Foundation — Haags Gemeentemusem, The Hague, 



are only two basic types of sym- 
metry operations in two-dimen- 
sional patterns. The first operation 
causes the reflection of the basic 
motif across an imaginary plane to 
match another part of the pattern. 
This is analogous to the reflection 
we see in a mirror. The second in- 
volves rotation and causes the pat- 
tern to repeat itself as it is rotated 
around an axis perpendicular to the 
pattern. If the letters, for example, 
is rotated 180° on a page, it repeats 
itself perfectly. A similar result is 
obtained when a square is rotated 
through 90°. 

Symmetry operations cannot be 
combined with one another in such 
a manner that they destroy the 
symmetry of the pattern. This 
qualification limits the allowed 
number of combinations. Mirror 
planes, for instance, must be either 
parallel to each other or at an angle 
of 30°, 45°, 60°, or 90°. Arranging 
the mirrors at any other angle, say 
73°, results in an infinite number of 
new mirror planes. A further re- 
striction is that the combination of 
symmetry operations must be 
compatible with repetition of the 
motif that will fill the given space. 
For example, a regular pentagon is 
an object that repeats itself five 
times in a rotation of 360°, but if we 
try to tile a floor with regular pen- 
tagons, cracks and spaces will in- 
evitably result. The cracks and 
spaces make for a poor bathroom 
floor as well as an impossible crys- 
tal structure. 

The allowed combinations in two 
dimensions can be derived mathe- 
matically or empirically by careful 
observation of two-dimensional 
patterns. By using either method 
we must conclude that there are 
only seventeen possible combina- 
tions of symmetry operations that 
will produce repetition of patterns 
in two dimensions. The infinite 
diversity of repetitive patterns in 
the two-dimensional world of tiles 
and wallpaper is thus reduced to 
only seventeen possibilities. 

For minerals, we must of course 
expand to three dimensions. With 
the addition of another dimension, 
the number of symmetry operations 
also increases to include more 
processes than simply rotation and 
mirror reflection. The number of

The manner in which 
three-dimensional unit cells

different orientations of crystal

French crystallographer Haiiy, 
shows the stacking sequence of

possible combinations therefore 
necessarily increases to include 
such new symmetries as that found 
in a spiral staircase, but the allowed 
combinations still remain amazingly 
limited. Consider the symmetry 
operations needed to describe the 
external form of the faces of a 
crystal. In this case, as already 
noted, there is the fortunate limita- 
tion that all the operations must in- 
tersect at a point within the crystal. 
The allowed combinations are ac- 
cordingly called point groups and, 
as previously stated, there are only 
thirty-two of them. The symmetry 
observed in the different faces of 
any crystalline material must fall 
into one of these groups. Not all 
crystalline materials, of course, dis- 
play smooth, plane-bounding sur- 
faces. Growth in confined spaces 
and variations in conditions of 
crystallization may inhibit or distort 
the development of crystal faces, 
but where faces are developed, the 
angles between similar faces will 
always be constant, and the com- 
binations of symmetry operations 
relating the faces to each other will 
always be one of the thirty-two 
possibilities. 

Let us now delve past the sym- 
metries of the external form of 
crystals and consider the sym- 
metries of the individual unit cells. 
Here the number of allowed com- 
binations increases because the 
symmetry operations of individual 
unit cells, unlike those of crystal 
faces, do not have to intersect at a 
central point in the crystal. Each 
unit cell is repeated throughout the 
entire mineral. The result of this 
repetition is the creation of new 
symmetries. When the thirty-two 
point groups are combined with 
repetition in three-dimensional 
space, the total number of possible 
combinations reaches 230. These 
230 space groups were indepen- 
dently derived in the late nineteenth 
century by a Russian crystallog- 
rapher, a German mathematician, 
and a gifted British amateur. The 
230 space groups represent all of 
the possible combinations of sym- 
metry operations with unit cell 
repetitions that are required to 
describe the crystalline state. The 
derivation and compilation of these 
groups make possible the routine

determination of the structure of all 

crystalline solids. 

The designation of the 230 space 
groups, which describe the arrange- 
ment of atoms within a crystal, 
preceded the ability of crystallog- 
raphers to actually make such de- 
terminations. Until the early part 
of the twentieth century, crystal- 
lographers were limited in the types 
of structural measurements they 
could make. An instrument called a 
goniometer was used to measure 
the angles between faces, and the 
polarizing microscope provided 
information on the interaction of 
polarized light with crystals in dif- 
ferent orientations. Neither instru- 
ment, however, provided detailed 
information about the internal 
structure of minerals. 

The discovery of X-rays by 
Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895 provided 
the necessary tool. In May of 1912 
an experiment was completed at the 
University of Munich in which an 
X-ray beam was directed at the 
surface of a crystal of copper sul- 
fate. The diffracted X-ray beams 
were recorded on film and the 
symmetrical pattern of the dark 
lines and points on the film were 
related to the internal arrangement 
of atoms in the crystal. 

William Lawrence Bragg, a grad- 
uate student at the University of 
Cambridge, was quick to seize on 
the importance of those results. He 
examined the structure of rock salt 
with X-rays and tested a structure 
postulated for it in 1883. Confirm- 
ing the structure of salt, Bragg be- 
gan a systematic X-ray examina- 
tion of other crystal structures. In 
1919 a Swiss mineralogist showed 
that the space groups of minerals 
could be determined by X-ray dif- 
fraction . Since that time , X-ray crys- 
tallography has been critical in the 
study of the solid state, and struc- 
tures that could only be guessed 
at from their external form have 
been confirmed by X-ray diffraction. 
The external morphological 
measurements of the eighteenth 
century, the mathematical deriva- 
tion of point and space groups in 
the nineteenth century, and use 
of X-ray diffraction in the twentieth 
have thus been combined to pro- 
vide today&apos;s understanding of the 
internal structure of minerals. n

Revelation 6:12 

There&apos;s something medieval about the Great Plains. 
Partly it&apos;s the land, so flat and so immense, spread out 
like a wall-to-wall carpet from the Rockies to the 
Mississippi, from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Such 
a land can make one believe that the world itself is 
flat: its four quarters perfectly balanced by the four 
cardinal directions; its one God safely ensconced in 
a zodiac heaven held up by the pitchforks of Justice, 
Prudence, Temperance, and Fortitude. And partly it&apos;s 
the Gothic sky vaulting overhead, a sky even more 
expansive than the land. Thunder and lightning can 
play tag across this sky without crowding the sun; 
cumulus clouds can pile up like mountain ranges, yet 
fail to blot out its blue. Here the age-old litany of the 
wind, the &quot;persistent, mournful crying wind of the 
plain,&quot; as Hamlin Garland put it, blows impartially 
on the just and the unjust. Here the single eye of the 
sun, blazing indifferently on good and evil, is rarely 
out of sight. Under such a sky, time itself seems 
eternal. 

The immutability of the Great Plains, its vastness, 
the stark emptiness of so much undifferentiated space 
is awesome, or would be if the settler hadn&apos;t divided 
the land in such a simple mathematical way: a plain 
geometry, as it were. Rectangularly shaped states 
right-angle one another, then break into checker- 
boards of counties, which separate into identical 
square-mile townships, which section into acres, 
which divide, ultimately, into cornfields — or occa- 
sionally multiply into a town halved by its Main Street; 
then subdivided into dozens of identical blocks, lots, 
and yards. Such simplicity, such thoroughness, seems 
in itself medieval. 

Small wonder, then, that when the dust storms of 
the 1930s rolled over the Plains — their turbulent black 
clouds pitching and heaving thundersqualls that 
showered dust instead of rain — some feared they were 
witnessing the apocalypse. The land, which had 
seemed so clearly defined, began to move: from field

to field, from county to county, from state to state. 
The distinction between land and sky, once so clear, 
became blurred as earth rose up to dance before the 
wind in a dozen different guises. Thousands of tons of 
soil, once indisputably wed to the land, rose and in- 
vaded the stratosphere. Such a reversal of the physical 
world was shocking. 

But as each early storm passed, the sense of the

apocalyptic died away with the wind. Dust storms, 
foiics reminded themselves, are a normal part of life on 
the Plains, where dry weather and high winds tradi- 
tionally combine to shift soil, where the settler com- 
plained in the 1800s about storms that left him sooty as 
a coal miner, where Indian villages were buried in dust 
as long ago as the fifteenth century, and where, eons 
earlier, the fertile loess itself had been blown in from 
the Rocky Mountains. In retrospect, it hardly seems 
remarkable that most people chose to dismiss the 
storms. There was something so arbitrary about them, 
so capricious. No two were quite alike. Some rolled in 
as magnificently as thunderheads; others shrieked in 
like relentless tidal waves. Some crept in like fog, 
clinging insidiously to the ground, then swelled until 
sky and land fused into a brownish pall. Others fell in a 
second, a pitch-black blanket unfurling, a thick whirl- 
ing cloud of dust dark enough to turn day into mid- 
night. Still, when the first of the great dust storms 
hit in November of 1933, even hardened newsmen 
were impressed. Originating in Saskatchewan Prov- 
ence in Canada and driven by gale-force winds, the 
storm swept through the Dakotas and Iowa, black- 
ened the faces of World&apos;s Fair visitors in Chicago, 
and the next day, turned New York&apos;s sky yellow, its 
afternoon to dusk. &quot;Much Awe Aroused by Phe- 
nomenon,&quot; headlined the Journal in Sioux City, 
Iowa, where the storm paled the eye of the bright after- 
noon sun until it shone as weird and blue as a foreign 
moon. The JournaVs page-one story opened with a 
quote from Revelation. Anything less seemed inap- 
propriate. 

Indeed, anything short of Revelation would have 
been inappropriate, for the dust storms of the 1930s 
ended an era on the Plains. They put an end to the 
world of the independent farmer, a world based on a 
dream as reckless as the vision that drew miners, in 
1849, across the prairie to the promised land beyond. 
The farmer&apos;s dream, like the gold miner&apos;s, was based 
on optimism and on an indifference to the land. The 
dust storms that blew this world apart were them- 
selves the result of a long process of disintegration, 
a process that began the moment the first crop was 
sown on the flat grasslands. But in 1933 the end was 
not yet visible — for dust storms, although more dra- 
matic than drought when viewed as individual phe- 
nomenon, actually extract their toll the same way: 
slowly, over the passage of time, like the embrace of a 
giant python whose coils tighten bit by bit. 

The first European to set foot on the Plains was 
Coronado, following his vision of a kingdom of silver 
and gold. Wave after wave of Europeans followed. 
None was able to gaze upon the land and see it for 
what it was. Instead, like blind men, each discovered 
his own elephant. Early explorers in 1820 were con- 
vinced that they saw a wasteland. So strong was their 
vision that the first maps marked the Plains as the 
Great American Desert, and as late as 1859, Horace 
Greeley wrote, &apos;T judge that the desert is steadily en- 
larging its borders and at the same time intensifying 
its barrenness.&quot; He proclaimed this land unfit for 
human habitation.

Those whose eyes were filled with dreams of fur or 
gold saw the Plains, as many still do, as a vast 
thoroughfare linking east and west. They beat a path- 
way through prairie grass high enough to cover the 
backs of their horses; their tracks can still be seen, 
running parallel with Interstate 80. The government, 
which fancied it could see the Plains clearly from its 
vantage point in Washington, envisioned the land laid 
out in modest European-sized farms of about 160 
acres each. The Homestead Act, passed in 1862, made 
this vision official. Actually, the prairie was hardly 
comparable to any land in Europe; it was more like the 
great plains of China or Russia&apos;s vast steppes. 

Shrewdest dreamer of all was the railroad, which 
saw nothing but coast-to-coast customers. In true 
American style, the railroad set out to market its 
dream, launching such an effective campaign that 
millions of farmers, looking for greener pastures, 
poured into the Plains. They came from states east of 
the Mississippi River and they came from Europe, 
particularly from Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavia. 
Between 1870 and 1900, more acres — some 430 mil- 
lion — ^were settled than during the country&apos;s entire 
previous history. The railroad worked this miracle by 
financing newpapers that printed glowing stories about 
opportunities on the prairie, the newsprint transform- 
ing every little hamlet into a burgeoning metropolis. 
Railroad agents, well supplied with newspapers and 
with exhibition cars displaying Plains produce, 
combed the east coast and the cities of Europe. 
Europeans willing to migrate were given steamship 
tickets and a free hitch on the railroad halfway across 
the continent to the Plains where, according to the 
agents, a husband waited for every woman, a thriving 
farm for every man. 



When the settler arrived in his well-advertised Eden, 
he was greeted by old-timers who looked at his ax and 
scoffed, &quot;A grass sickle will chop down all the trees 
where you&apos;re going.&quot; It was virtually true. The prom- 
ised land was a shadeless plain, with not enough trees to 
build a fire, let alone a house, and with water scarcer 
than shade. The settler burned buffalo chips, built his 
house of sod, and nearly broke his back trying to till the 
promised land. True, he didn&apos;t have to fell a tree or 
move a boulder to clear his field, but the very soil itself 
resisted the plow. Indeed, it broke the fragile blade the 
European settler had brought with him. He had to resort 
to the John Deere plow in order to break sod; even then, 
it took five oxen to pull the steel blade through the 
ground and transform the flat land into farmland. The 
virgin prairie grass had root systems extending deep 
into the ground, searching the subsoil for moisture. The 
root network for each clump of grass totaled a mile or 
more. It wove, beneath the surface of the land, a web as 
thick and brown as a thrush&apos;s nest, a web that had for 
centuries knitted land and plant. The settler, in plowing, 
didn&apos;t simply break sod; he broke root — and in so 
doing, he began to break the land&apos;s defense system 
against the prairie wind. 

The land, in turn, nearly broke the settler&apos;s dream. 
It didn&apos;t yield the way moist European soil did. Even 
160 acres of choice land (and homesteading land was 
rarely choice) were not enough to support a man. The 
settler had to purchase decent land from the railroad or 
from real-estate promoters who bought land in large 
blocks, then resold it by the acre. As if that wasn&apos;t 
tribulation enough, there was always the weather, 
hardly paradisiacal. If hot sun and high wind didn&apos;t 
drive folks mad in summer, then winter blizzards 
would. Or hail. Or grasshopper plagues. Or prairie

fires. No wonder settlers left the Plains in droves, as 
many as 90 percent abandoning some areas. Signs on 
returning prairie schooners cryptically summed it up: 
&quot;In God we trusted; in Kansas we busted.&quot; But 
despite afflictions, settlement crept steadily westward, 
following diminishing rainfall — about 32 inches an- 
nually at Dubuque, Iowa; 31 at Des Moines; 26 at 
Omaha. By the turn of the century, most land was 
occupied. East of the 98th meridian, which nearly 
splits the Plains in half, farmers tilled the land, harvest- 
ing &quot;cash&quot; crops of wheat and corn, gardening, raising 
chickens and hogs, and grazing cattle, for American 
farming was still diversified in the European fashion — 
a realization of the government&apos;s dream. To the west 
of the 98th meridian, where annual precipitation of 
about 20 inches makes farming unprofitable, ranchers 
grazed cattle and cursed the farmer who, they main- 
tained, was the ruin of the country, having &quot;everlast- 
ingly, eternally, now and forever, destroyed the best 
grazing land in the world.&quot; 

Meanwhile the settler&apos;s dream, weakened but not 
abandoned, was unexpectedly shored up by a new 
dream forming in the industrial east, a sophisticated 
belief in progress. Progress, after all, rested not on 
myth but on an inviolable law of nature. It was sci- 
entific. Darwin&apos;s Origin of Species began to assume an 
authority once claimed only by the Bible, and lo, the 
ancient dream of Eden began to transform itself into 
an optimistic vision of a Utopian future based on 
science and technology, a new civilization whose un- 
folding was as inevitable as man&apos;s evolution from the 
apes. 

World War I rapidly advanced this dream. &quot;Wheat 
will win the war,&quot; the government proclaimed when 
the beastly Hun blockaded the Dardanelles, cutting 



Europe off from her Russian wheat basket, &quot;Plant 
wheat!&quot; The marketplace echoed the cry, and wheat 
prices jumped, from a prewar level of 60 to 80 cents 
a bushel to $1.00, then to $1.40, and kept rising. By 
1917, when the United States entered the war, wheat 
had broken $2.00, the highest price the farmer had 
ever received. It went up to $2.10 and held. As the 
market boomed, the industrialist — smelling profit — 
took time off from developing tanks to do for the 
tractor what Henry Ford had done for the automobile: 
turn it from a novelty to a necessity. When salesmen 
showed the farmer how, if he replaced his team of 
horses with a fuel-powered tractor, he could plant as 
much as he could plow, the farmer didn&apos;t need much 
convincing. The number of cultivated acres doubled 
during the war as tractors rolled onto the Plains by the 
thousands. More than 11,000,000 acres — twice the land 
area of Massachusetts — was land that had been 
plowed for the first time. In Kansas alone, wheat 
acreage increased from 4,870,000 acres in 1910 to 
nearly 12,000,000 in 1919. Even the weather coop- 
erated. Plentiful rainfall, combined with patriotism, 
profits, and technology, created an era of prosperity 
such as the farmer had never known. 

The end of the war should have collapsed the 
market and the dream of progress, but it did not. In- 
stead, the government guaranteed wheat prices as part 
of its relief to Europe. And, by the time Europe had 
recovered, the industrialist had come up with a new 
technological miracle, the combine. This marvelous 
new machine, which cut, threshed, and cleaned the 
grain, released the farmer from his dependence on the 
hired hand in exactly the same way that the tractor 
had released him from his dependence on the horse. 
The ceiling went off wheat production; the age of

Heavily eroded field 

&quot;wheat kings&quot; began. Between 1925 and 1930, the 
amount of cultivated land jumped by 34 percent. With 
the combine, the farmer could reap as much as he 
could plant. With the tractor, he could plant as much 
as he could plow. With both, a bushel of wheat took 
only three minutes of human labor to produce. There 
was one drawback, however: it took a lot of land to 
make a combine pay. But the industrialist offered easy 
terms, and the banker volunteered to mortgage farm- 
land. Never a slacker, the farmer borrowed, bought 
land, and began to plow up everything he could. First 
he plowed farmland; then he plowed pasture, planting 
wheat everywhere and leaving fields bare from the 
time of sowing to the sprouting of the seed. Winter 
wheat was the worst. Sown in the fall, it left fields 
bare to the wind all winter long. When the farmer ran 
out of land on the rainy eastern half of the 98th 
meridian, he crossed right over and plowed semiarid 
ranchland, gambling on rain as he replaced long-rooted 
prairie grass with short-rooted wheat. By the time he 
finished sowing, the only thing that remained to bind 
dirt to land was moisture. So blinded was he by his 
dream that he even tilled land whose topsoil was so 
thin that the Plains clay, caliche, lay just below the 
bite of the plow. The sky was the limit, as far as the 
farmer was concerned. It never occurred to him that 
the land might have a limit, too. 

The farmer, busy sowing wheat and reaping gold, 
could foresee no end to his land of milk and honey. 
Never had his dream seemed more real. Progress was 
visible everywhere: in radio waves that brought New 
York to his living room; in automatic planters that 
seeded his crops; in towering silos made of gleaming 
concrete; in cars and trucks zipping up and down the 
roadways, streamlined trains tearing across the con- 
tinent, and planes bucking air currents on a new 
frontier. 

Then, in the summer of 1930, drought hit. Precipita- 
tion east of the Rockies was 500 billion tons short of 



normal, the worst drought on record, the weather 
bureau said. It lifted in 1931, dropped again in 1932, 
and by 1934 looked likely to run forever. The hot eye 
of the sun began to evaporate the land&apos;s final protec- 
tion against the wind — moisture. Lakes dried to 
puddles, and the water table under the Plains, which 
feeds the area&apos;s wells, lowered perceptibly. In Ne- 
braska, where I was born, the Platte River was nothing 
hut one long sand bar cutting across the state. That 
was hardly unusual (hadn&apos;t Artemus Ward called the 
Platte &quot;a good river if you set it on edge&quot;?), but sand 
bars in the Mississippi River were disconcerting. The 
Mississippi dropped to an all-time low, 2.5 feet be- 
low its previous low-water mark of 1864, so shallow in 
spots that swimmers could walk across it. 

Still, the farmer was hardly alone in his lack of fore- 
sight. When in 1933 a thunderhead dropped red dirt 
mixed with rain, an imaginative Nebraska newsman 
wrote: &quot;Omaha was blanketed with thick, red volcanic 
dust early this morning. It is believed to have been 
carried from volcanic eruptions in the Aleutian Islands 
several weeks ago.&quot; A University of Nebraska geology 
professor, E. E. Schramm, was more realistic. When 
he analyzed the dust (gypsum, volcanic ash, silt 
particles), he concluded that it orginated in the red 
Permian beds of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, beds 
formed late in the Paleozoic Era (before the rise of the

dinosaur) and now, some 250 million years later, 
transported by wind to Nebrasica. Yet even Professor 
Schramm was unwilling to see what this might mean. 
Instead, he considered the deposit a windfall: hadn&apos;t 
Nebraska farmers just received $25 million worth of 
free fertilizer? 

But blind optimism was not confined to the Plains. 
When the first great dust storm reached the east 
coast in November 1933, the New York Times was 
quick to assure readers there was no need to worry. 
Such storms, wrote its science writer, were similar to 
the red sirocco storms, which blow from the Sahara 
Desert across the Mediterranean to southern Europe 
and sometimes combine with rain, forming &quot;showers 
of blood&quot; that can strike terror in the hearts of &quot;super- 
stitious peasants.&quot; These &quot;displays&quot; were nothing 
compared to the record dustfall of March 1901, a 
series of cyclones that dropped some 550 million tons 
of dust over much of North Africa, the Mediterranean, 
and western Europe, In turn, this was peanuts beside 
the volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which shot dust 50 
miles into the air, turned skies red for three days over 
much of the world&apos;s surface, and rained dust around 
the globe for years. Now that was a dustfall! 

These &quot;blood rains&quot; were regarded as &quot;freaks of 
nature,&quot; weird combinations of circumstances that 
couldn&apos;t possibly be repeated in a hundred years. 
And, in truth, there was something fantastic about a 
dust cloud that covered 1,350,000 square miles, stood 
three miles high, and stretched from Canada to 
Texas, from Montana to Ohio — a cloud so colossal it 
obliterated the sky. Just as there was something

preternatural about a dust cloud dense enough to 
eclipse the sun simultaneously in six states. Or about 
New Mexico&apos;s soil turning New England&apos;s snow 
yellow. Or about a four-day storm in May 1934 that 
transported some 300 million tons of dirt 1,500 miles, 
darkened New York, Baltimore, and Washington for 
five hours, and dropped dust not only on the Presi- 
dent&apos;s desk in the White House but also on the decks 
of ships some 300 miles out in the Atlantic. Who could 
believe such things? 

Certainly not the farmer. After each storm, he 
paused to curse his bad luck, then revved up his 
tractor and replanted his crop. A man of dreams, the 
farmer was, a man of fierce determination. He had to 
replant. He owed the banker so much, it was reap 
wheat or lose his farm, so he ignored the county 
agent&apos;s warnings against &quot;reckless sodbusting,&quot; as 
they&apos;d been ignored since the late 1800s. And he paid 
no attention to the government that begged him to 
stop plowing, that had beseeched him, since 1929, to 
reduce his wheat acreage. Why should he listen? 
Government subsidy, even under the Hoover ad- 
ministration, had kept the wheat market from foun- 
dering. Instead, the farmer plowed like a man de- 
termined to make a silk purse out of a sow&apos;s ear, no 
matter what the price. He refused to believe that he 
was laboring only for the wind. But he was. Each turn- 
ing of the earth only further pulverized the soil, leav- 
ing it more likely to blow. Topsoil, cream of the earth, 
went first. When the wind came in, hugging the 
ground, dry dust rose like a mist, skimmed over the 
land — cutting from one field to another until both sur- 
faces were moving. Not just earth went. So did 
humus, separated from the soil by the wind; so did 




seed, blown out of the furrows, and small plants, 
lifted bodily into the air. Little remained grounded, 
finally, but barren soil — and the roots of growing 
grain, which would soon wither and die. The more 
conscientious the farmer had been, the more he 
pulverized the soil in plowing, the greater his loss. 

The more the dust blew, the finer it became, grinding 
itself into smaller and smaller particles until it hung in 
the air like motes in a sunbeam. Dust blew everywhere, 
penetrating even closed houses, rippling on window 
sills, clinging to walls and curtains. Nothing could shut 
it out. The housewife tried. She stuffed oiled rags 
around windows and doors. When that didn&apos;t work, she 
sealed cracks withpackingtape; when that didn&apos;t work, 
she hung bedsheets and sprayed them with water or 
kerosene. But nothing worked. Food laid out for supper 
would be ruined, the milk turned black in the glass. 
Everything — beds, clothes in the closet, food in the 
refrigerator — was covered with a fine film. &quot;It takes grit 
to live in this country,&quot; joked the farmer, but few 
laughed as masses of dust began to billow into huge 
tumbling clouds, ebony-black at the base and muddy 
tan at the top, some so saturated with dust particles that 
ducks and geese, caught in flight, suffocated; some 
turning the sky so black that chickens, thinking it night, 
would roost. 

The storms were not perpetual, but they began to 
seem that way. &quot;There is rarely a day when at some 
time dust clouds do not roll over,&quot; wrote Caroline 
Henderson, an Oklahoma farm woman, for the 
Atlantic Monthly. Oklahoma counted 102 storms in 
the span of one year; North Dakota reported 300 in 
eight months&apos; time. Most arrived early in the day and 
lasted until nightfall, but some raged through the 
night, and a few blew for days. The devastation 
wreaked by these &quot;black blizzards&quot; was astounding. 
Some 300,000 square miles — four times the land area 
of Nebraska — were damaged by dust or erosion. The

government estimated that 850,000,000 tons of soil 
were being swept oflF the Plains each year, leaving 
some 150,000 square miles of land devoid of topsoil, 
bleak stretches of ground that lay totally barren be- 
neath the wind. After the blizzards, people crept from 
houses or storm cellars to view a world increasingly 
transformed. Dead rabbits and birds littered the 
fields; once-green gardens and pastures lay beneath 
carpets of dust so fine that shoes left tracks as though 
in snow. Landmarks disappeared; plum thickets died 
out; even groves of locust trees vanished. Anything 
that slowed the wind — a tractor, a tumbleweed caught 
in barbed wire — would have a drift behind it. Dirt 
covered fence lines until only scattered post tops 
remained visible. It drifted as high as the eaves of 
houses, blocked roads and railroad tracks so badly 
that snowplows had to clear them. 

Lackluster cattle, which had fed on weeds, then on 
thistles, finally on nothing, stood gaunt and list- 
less — their hides rough, ugly growths festering 
around their mouths. Some farmers offered livestock, 
free, to anyone who could feed them. One man in 
Minnesota shot twenty-two head of cattle, then shot 
himself. Outlined against the sky, summer trees stood 
naked as skeletons, while farmhouses seemed like 
strange summer cottages dotted along wind-rippled 
dunes of dust on a vacated beach. Except for the 
savage grandeur of the wind, it was a silent and 
desolate world. Most of the wildlife that hadn&apos;t been 
killed had already migrated. 

Men followed suit. By 1935, thousands of dry-land 
farmers were streaming out of the Plains in a great 
exodus to California that would be memorialized later 
by John Steinbeck. During the decade of the thirties 
every state in the Union gained in population except 
five: the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma. 
Those states lost more than 300,000 people; most of 
them left in 1935 and 1936. Some folks — desperate, 
stubborn, or held tenaciously to the land by hope — 
stayed. Crop failure followed crop failure until life 
seemed as Biblical as Revelation (9:12): &quot;One woe 
is past and, behold, there came two woes more here- 
after.&quot; Fields were badly eroded; some had lost top- 
soil as deep as the land had been plowed. The remain- 
ing subsoil or, in some cases, clay was not porous 
enough to retain moisture or rich enough to support 
plants. Many, including the government, feared that 
the Great Plains had become the Great American 
Desert that early explorers thought it was. Pasture 
after pasture was destitute of grass; cornfield after 
cornfield yielded nothing but dead stalks. &quot;I don&apos;t 
think I picked ten bushels of corn from 320 acres,&quot; 
said Roy Glandt of a Nebraska crop. The land itself 
had lost its capacity to sustain life. The ocean of 
prairie grass that had been tamed into amber waves 
of grain became, in a few years, a wasteland. Finally, 
even the farmer&apos;s optimism crumbled into despair. 
&quot;We drive as if going to a funeral,&quot; wrote Meridel Le 
Sueur of this period. &quot;The corpse is the very earth.&quot; 

And so it was. The dream of progress had proved to 
be, not an alchemy, but a black magic that had all but 
exterminated the land. Progress, with its technology,

its profit motive, and its indifference to nature, had 
reduced paradise to a darkling plain. No longer could 
anyone believe that the earth would, necessarily, 
abide forever. That the land would, unconditionally, 
remain part of the land. No longer could man believe 
in his dominion. The shock was understandably ex- 
treme: it was the shock of the infant discovering the 
breast is not his. The lesson was a bitter one. 

The long task of reclaiming the land began; the gov- 
ernment took most of the initiative. &quot;Plant trees,&quot; 
said the government, and thousands of trees were 
planted as windbreakers. &quot;Dig ponds,&quot; said the gov- 
ernment, and ponds were dug. Snow fences were put 
up to slow wind erosion, dirt-filled burlap bags were 
piled on top of dunes, and emergency cover crops 
were sown. The government purchased some two

million acres (including 220,000 abandoned farms) and 
planted them with native grasses, permanently retiring 
much of the land from agricultural use. The reclama- 
tion process took four years, even with the help of 
rain. But eventually the Plains healed, and crops 
grew again. Not that the land would ever be the same. 
Topsoil, once blown away, can never be returned; 
virgin prairie, once plowed, can never be reclaimed. 
But gardens sprouted, lilacs and roses bloomed, and 
wildlife returned. 

The dust storms had not been apocalyptic in a 
physical sense, but in another sense they were. We 
who were born, as I was, at the end of the thirties, 
were born into a new era. The farmer was gone. He 
had been replaced by the agronomist, a scientist of soil 
management who was concerned with regulating, not 
conquering, nature; who worked closely with the 
engineer to conserve the precious resources of the 
Plains. The agronomist, of course, believed in the 
survival of the fittest, but he was not as cocky as the 
farmer had been, not as certain that man was destined 
to win that particular fray. In this new world, man 
and nature hung in a delicate balance. Accordingly, in 
the classrooms of the forties, I was taught (along- 
side the farm boys) the lessons of the thirties: how to 
reduce wind erosion by strip farming and crop rotation; 
how to plow at right angles to the prevailing winds; 
how to conserve moisture by stubble mulching and by 



keeping a cover crop on dry land. We were taught a 
new respect for the ancient arts of terracing and con- 
tour farming, a new respect for the land. &quot;He who is 
prudent in his use of the land,&quot; we were told, &quot;will 
suffer only heavy losses during the cycles of drought, 
but he who is improvident will suffer disaster.&quot; 
Clearly the sins of our fathers were not to be repeated. 
Outside the classroom, I watched these lessons 
being driven home as a huge dam was built on the 
Republican River, which cuts across Nebraska south 
of the Platte, a dam designed to retain the water 
that flows across the Plains from the Rocky Moun- 
tains, water that could irrigate the crops during the 
inevitable seasons of drought. It was part of a vast 
system of dams being carved into the Plains. The age 
of reckless and fickle optimism was clearly over. 
The world that had begun the moment the settler had 
arrived on the Plains with his plow and his wagonload 
of dreams was gone. The dust storms had blown 
that world away as surely as they had dispersed the 
topsoil, as surely as the wind had toppled the hardy 
independence of the farmer and eroded his dream. Not 
even the energy of World War II could bring it back. 
It was history, buried with the buffalo. The sky, the 
enormous Gothic sky, still arched overhead, and 
underfoot the land stretched out, or so it seemed, from 
sea to sea. But that, we knew, was an illusion. The 
sky might be limitless, but the earth was not. D

4 The Ornamental Eye 



by Ronald E. Thresher 




%. 




Many reef fishes have 
conspicuous eyes, the 
better to communicate with 

Brilliant colors are the visual 
hallmark of a coral reef. Purple and 
red shrimps peer from orange- and 
green-lined crevices in the coral; 
bright red sponges and purple and 
green gorgonians dot the seascape. 
But by far the most spectacular 
colors are found on the fishes. 
Black-and-yellow-banded angelfish 
swim slowly through swarms of 
electric blue damselfish, and scar- 
let-spotted hawkfish scoot about 
the coral. A colorful kaleidoscope 
of spots, stripes, swirls, and bands 
shimmers and flashes as the reefs&apos; 
piscine inhabitants search for food, 
shelter, and mates. These striking 
and sometimes bizarre color pat- 
terns have perplexed and impressed 
scientists the world over. 

Despite this interest, the func- 
tion of such color patterns is still 
poorly understood. The consensus, 
however, is that in many species 
brilliant coloration serves as a 
means of communication. For ex- 
ample, various &quot;cleaner fish,&quot; 
which must advertise their pres- 
ence to potential customers in need 
of parasite removal, are invariably 
brightly colored. In some species, 
conspicuous, or &quot;poster,&quot; colora- 
tion coordinates group activities; 
in others, it warns intruders away 
from an area already claimed by a

form of eye ornamentation among 
the reef fishes studied. This kole,

territorial fish. Such examples of 
advertising demonstrate the impor- 
tance of color — and vision — to reef 
fishes. This reliance on visual cues 
is related to the environment of a 
reef. 

In the often crystal clear waters 
around a reef, visual cues are de- 
tectable at a distance of many feet, 
thus enabling a signaler to be 
accurately located and identified. 
Chemical cues, on the other hand, 
are rapidly dispersed on the reef 
and may even be washed away by 
currents and tidal surges. Similarly, 
sounds are often diflRcult to localize 
and are easily drowned out by the 
crash of waves and the myriad 
noises of the reefs&quot; other inhabi- 
tants. Under such circumstances, 
coloration is the most eflfective way 
of gaining and transmitting infor- 
mation. 

Because of this reliance on visual 
cues, most reef fishes have large, 
well-developed eyes and react to 
the slightest movement near them. 
Possession of such eyes, however, 
is a mixed blessing. Although they 
permit an eflfective view of the 
environment, large eyes also pose 
a special problem for an animal 
when it needs to conceal its pres- 
ence. The otherwise effective 
camouflage both of predators, hid- 
ing in wait for prey, and prey, 
hiding from predators, could easily 
be ruined by a large, circular, 
glistening eye. As a consequence, 
numerous fishes have evolved com- 
plex adaptations to disguise their 
sight organs. Some have uniformly 
colored eyes that match surround- 
ing head colors and, thereby, seem- 
ingly disappear; others have one 
or more lines running through their 
eyes, breaking up their outline and 
making them less obvious. A few 
species confuse by having many 
&quot;eyes&quot;: two real ones; the rest. 



85 




eyelike spots scattered about the 
body. The evolution and function 
of such adaptations have been 
widely studied and discussed by 
many scientists. 

My observations of eye-color pat- 
terns in reef fishes of the tropical 
western Atlantic, however, have 
led me to conclude that for many 
species the association of color and 
eyes has evolved in another, com- 
pletely different direction. I closely 
observed eighty-five species of 
common reef fishes, including car- 
nivores and herbivores, free-swim- 
ming and benthic types, brightly 
colored ones as well as those with 
subdued or even cryptic colors. I 
found that many species had promi- 
nent and often wildly ornamented 
eyes; in fact, less than 25 percent 
of the species had camouflaged 



86 



eyes. The prevalence of conspicu- 
ous eyes was remarkable, as were 
the patterns of their ornamentation 
and their color combinations. 

The most frequently encountered 
form of eye ornamentation was 
outlining. Putting an outline around 
an object is one of the most effec- 
tive ways to make it conspicuous, 
just as disrupting its outline is an 
effective form of concealment. The 
eye, especially when round, lends 
itself well to outlining. This is 
largely achieved through color 
variation or shading of the pupil, 
iris, and surrounding head area. 
Typically, the pupil, iris, and sur- 
rounding head area are all differ- 
ently colored, creating a &quot;bulls- 
eye&quot; effect that focuses attention 
on the pupil. A few fishes carry 
this even further with additional 



full or partial rings of alternating 
colors around their eyes. In its most 
extreme form, the angelfish Poma- 
cantlms parii has four such rings 
around its pupils. 

Another common adaptation that 
makes the eyes prominent is con- 
trast. For a color signal to be most 
conspicuous, brightness contrast 
and simultaneous color contrast 
must be maximized. Brightness 
contrast entails the combination of 
a dark, nonreflecting area immedi- 
ately adjacent to a bright, shiny 
one; the sudden change in bright- 
ness draws attention and the sharp 
boundary enhances outlining. Si- 
multaneous color contrast is a 
balancing act of sorts that caters 
to the recipient&apos;s visual capacity 
to receive a signal. The ideal color 
signal is one to which the recipient

is most sensitive; on the other hand, 
the use of two colors creates an 
attention-drawing contrast. The 
farther apart the two colors are 
spectrally (and thus the farther from 
the point of peak sensitivity), the 
more dramatic and effective the 
contrast. The optimum balance be-

87 



tween opposing selective pressures 
is the use of two colors whose 
combination minimizes signal loss 
due to a shift away from peak 
sensitivity, while maximizing their 
spectral diflFerences. Based on the 
spectral sensitivities of reef fishes, 
the juxtaposition of blue and yellow 
should strike the most effective 
balance. 

Both brightness and simultane- 
ous color contrast are manifested 
by reef fishes. Virtually all fishes 
with conspicuous eyes have a dark 
pupil outlined by a bright iris. More- 
over, the pupil is often dark blue; 
the iris, bright yellow. In fact, blue, 
yellow, and for additional contrast, 
black are found in one or another 
combination in the eyes of more 
than half the fishes on the reef. 
Fishes as far apart systematically 
as gobies and jawfish have con- 
verged toward this particular com- 
bination of eye color. 

The blue tang, Acanthurus coe- 
ruleus, provides an impressive ex- 
ample of selection for such colors. 
As a juvenile, the fish is bright 
yellow, but as it matures, its body 
gradually turns pale blue. Through- 
out this change, its pupil is deep 
black, surrounded by a two-color 
iris. Between the pupil and the 
mostly iridescent blue iris, is a fine 
yellow outline. In its yellow phase, 
the tang&apos;s eyes are conspicuous 



black and blue spots on a yellow 
body, thus the three-color com- 
bination; as the fish matures, the 
eyes&apos; outer blue ring merges with 
the newly developing body color 
and the fine inner ring manifests 
itself. The eyes are now black and 
yellow on a blue background, as 
conspicuous as they were earlier 
and still retaining the basic three- 
color motif. 

These same three colors show up 
over and over again on reef fishes 
wherever the need for a conspicu- 
ous visual signal has arisen. Most 
of the cleaner species, such as the 
Spanish hogfish and the neon goby 
have body-color combinations of 
blue, yellow, and/or black. Several 
territorial fishes, such as many 
damselfish, are entirely blue and 
yellow. The false eyes on several 
juvenile damselfish are black, out- 



Reef fishes can best see blue and 

yellow. A combination of these 

colors, with black for added 

contrast, is common in species that 

depend on visual signals, such as

lined with blue, on a yellow back- 
ground. The same colors are 
featured in the large spots found 
on the snouts of many hamlets, 
small predatory basses common 
on the reef. Hamlets are a poly- 
chromatic group, and their con- 
spicuous nasal spots may have 
evolved to provide a standard for 
species recognition. 

The reasons for the evolution of 
the eyes of most reef fishes as con- 
spicuous signals are not completely 
clear. To a large extent, it reflects 
the importance of the eyes as a 
means of short-distance communi- 
cation throughout the animal king- 
dom. Even in humans, glaring at 
people carries a diflFerent meaning 
than refusing to look them straight 
in the eye. For many mammals, 
birds, and fishes the eyes are a key 
stimulus, which releases and orients

behavior. The Siamese fighting fish, 
for example, will display to and 
attack a shapeless lump of clay so 
long as it has a pair of distinct 
&quot;eyes.&quot; Recent research on Ha- 
waiian damselfish showed that their 
eyes are an important means of 
communication during aggressive 
interactions. During a fight, not 
only the relative strengths of two 
combatants but even the eventual 
outcome can be determined by 
watching the changing color pat- 
terns around their eyes. As the 
behavior of reef fishes is studied in 
greater detail, conspicuous eyes 
probably will be shown to play im- 
portant roles in courtship, spawn- 
ing, schooling, and virtually all 
other social interactions. 

But as important as ornamented 

eyes may be in short-range com- 

ui munication, fishes with such eyes 



should theoretically have to pay 
the price of conspicuousness. Most 
animals cannot aflFord to have per- 
manently bright colors around their 
eyes because predators could key 
in on these prominent features. 

If this is true for other animals, 
why should reef fishes be free of 
such constraints, especially since 
predators abound on the reef? The 
answer is twofold. First, the reef is 
riddled with hiding places for small 
fishes, which the larger predators 
cannot enter. Holes, crevices, and 
caves are never far away, and a 
threatened fish can quickly find 
cover. Such protection lessens the 
need to remain unobtrusive and 
cryptically colored. A second factor 
concerns the relative visual capabil- 
ities of prey and predator. Most 
reef fishes have eyes that are 
adapted to seeing best during full 



daylight conditions, when they are 
active. Predators are most active at 
dawn and dusk and their eyes have 
evolved to be most sensitive during 
these periods of dim light. So during 
the day, the predators are at a dis- 
advantage. A grouper is seen by 
potential prey long before it can 
see them. 

These two factors largely account 
for the limited amount of predation 
on small reef fishes during the day. 
Their color patterns, including 
those involving the eyes, are free to 
respond to other selective pres- 
sures, such as the need for effec- 
tive short-distance communication. 
In the long run, this relative free- 
dom from predation may well prove 
to be the single most important 
factor in understanding the signifi- 
cance of the rainbow colors of coral 
reef fishes. D

Notes from a Pioneer 



Letters From the Field, by 
Margaret Mead. Harper&amp;Row, 
$12.95:343 pp., illus. 

Most of the letters in this volume 
were written, not to a particular in- 
dividual, but to a varied, known, 
and loved group of people. And 
such is their straightforward style 
and eloquence that a reader, in 
some magical fashion, finds herself 
or himself taking, not the role of a 
student or critic, but the role of a 
friend or sympathetic colleague. To 
read letters from a friend in the field 
when that friend is Margaret Mead 
is a unique experience. 



There are field letters from Sa- 
moa, Manus, the Omaha Reserva- 
tion, New Guinea, Bali, and latmul, 
from a second visit to Manus, 
and from many subsequent, shorter 
trips. The time span extends from 
1925 to 1975, and each of the major 
field expeditions is prefaced by an 
introduction explaining the relevant 
personal, academic, and scientific 
circumstances. As a bonus, the 
volume opens with the most illumi- 
nating and helpful short statement 
about the importance of fieldwork 
that I have ever read. 

Mead&apos;s vivid and uninhibited de- 
scriptions of what she sees and

what she does are, in turn, moving, 
amusing, horrifying, and awe in- 
spiring: the death of a native child 
in Manus; the trickster fashion in 
which she and Gregory Bateson 
are blackmailed in Bali by the 
assistant chief priest of the village; 
the remarkable pigs at Alitoa who, 
if no children or dogs are within 
reach, are petted and take on the 
behavior of dogs; her irate ex- 
pressions of dislike for the white 
residents who are ruthlessly ex- 
ploiting the country and the native 
peoples; the courage and efficiency 
with which she copes with a hurri- 
cane in Samoa in 1926 and a vol- 
canic eruption on her return to 
Manus in 1953; her description of 
the effect of prolonged isolation 
and disassociation from the out- 
side world — with no mail for three 
months, no radio, nothing to read, 
her watch broken, and both she and 
her husband ill — &quot;I even begin to 
wonder what date it is.&quot; 

The letters from Samoa are, for 
me, particularly appealing. On her 
own choice and initiative, this 
young and inexperienced woman, 
&quot;with the courage of almost com- 
plete ignorance,&quot; traveled halfway 
around the world to study adoles- 
cent girls in &quot;a remote and un- 
touched place.&quot; The good sense 
and judgment she employs in ar- 
ranging her living and working 
situations so that she can do what 
she came to do; the diplomatic skill 
with which she accepts, and also 
evades, the handicap of high status 
bestowed on her by the Samoans; 
the fearlessness with which she 
lives through the hurricane (while 
caring for an infant and a small 
child) elicit from me the response: 
&quot;Would that my students should 
do as well on their first field trip.&quot;

A MARVELOUS GIFT FOR 

A SCIENCE-MINDED FRIEND! 



Cante ohitika win (&quot;brave-hearted 
woman&quot;)! Truly, as she says in her 
autobiography. Blackberry Winter, 
she had the sense &quot;of being invul- 
nerable as long as I was moving 
in the right direction.&quot; Her detailed 
accounts of the elaborate and time- 
consuming obligations of rank, the 
intricate social maneuvers by 
which she compensated aristocratic 
informants, the seemingly endless 
gifts and personal favors extracted 
from her by old and young make 
it dilRcult to sympathize with 
those anthropologists who have 
denounced their colleagues as 
&quot;exploiters of the natives.&quot; Speak- 
ing for myself, and construing ex- 
change reciprocities strictly, I have 
come out on the short end of almost 
all my transactions with the people I 
studied; although the intangible be- 
nefits have been great, these have 
not been acquired at their expense 
but rather in mutual benefit. Field- 
work is not a zero-sum game. 

With the present-day emphasis 
on women&apos;s studies and women&apos;s 
liberation, it is well that we are re- 
minded that Mead initiated the 
comparative study of women (and 
children) in other cultures more 
than 50 years ago, and that she has 
probably done more research on 
women and contributed more 
factual and insightful information 
about them than any other anthro- 
pologist — and, perhaps, any other 
human being. And, given her inde- 
pendence and originality, it is not 
surprising to learn that, on occa- 
sion, female critics have accused 
her of antifeminism, whereas male 
critics have accused her of rampant 
feminism. Her views about men, 
women, and children are, of 
course, best revealed in her own 
words. From her autobiography: 

Because of their agelong training in 
human relations — for that is what 
feminine intuition really is — women 
have a special contribution to make to 
any enterprise, and I feel it is up to 
them to contribute the kinds of aware- 
ness that relatively few men — except, 
for example, child analysts or men who 
have been intimately reared by 
women — have incorporated through 
their education. 

From the letters, Alitoa, 1932: 

The emphasis upon sex difference 
begins in the cradle — baby girls are 
decked out in earrings and necklaces, 
while boys wear no ornaments until 
almost grown. Little girls of four and 
five strut and flirt. The women do all

the carrying, the weeding, the cooking 
and have to all appearances a hard 
life, but they are attractive, valued and 
conscious of being valued. Shut out 
from the religion, from magic and from 
the social life of the men, they never- 
theless seem to maintain a firm sense 
of importance, and it is a sight to see a 
young woman swish her way across a 
village square where all the elders have 
been orating vigorously upon some 
affair of state. 

Mead, Ann Fischer, and 1 are in 
emphatic agreement that most field 
situations require the combined 
and cooperative effort of a man and 
a woman. In her boot; on the 
Omaha, The Changing Culture of 
an Indian Tribe, Mead notes how 
much easier it is for a woman to 
tali&lt;to the women than for a man 
to talk to the men, and she re- 
iterates it in a letter from the 
Tchambuli, dated 1933: &quot;Liice most 
of New Guinea, the men&apos;s houses 
and the rehgious cults make for a 
sharp division between men and 
women, and it is therefore ideal for 
a man and a woman to work to- 
gether in this culture.&quot; 

It is of historical interest that 
Edward B. Tylor said much the 
same thing in 1884 when advising 
American anthropologists on how 
to approach the study of American 
Indians. If a man and wife work 
together, he said, &quot;half of the in- 
vestigation seems to fall to her, 
so much is to be learned through 
the women of the tribe which the 
men will not readily disclose.&quot; 
Anthropologists, Tylor continued, 
ought not to sound the bull-roarer 
and &quot;warn the ladies off from their 
proceedings, but rather to avail 
themselves thankfully of their 
help.&quot; 

My husband and I came to an 
identical conclusion while we were 
carrying out our study of educa- 
tion among the Sioux on the Pine 
Ridge Reservation in 1962/63. We 
found that the task demanded not 
only the cooperative work of a ma- 
ture woman and a mature man but 
also the assistance of several 
younger people who, in this case, 
were American Indians. But Mead 
anticipated us in working in the field 
with young people, having returned 
to Manus in 1953 with Theodore and 
Lenora Schwartz. As she herself 
puts it: &quot;Any team, of whatever 
composition, but especially one 
contrasted in sex or age, will be able 
to do, not twice, but four or five 



Is it time 
to review 
your will ? 

Let this checklist 
help you decide. 

1. 

Have changes in the tax laws affected 
your will? 

2. 

Have you acquired important assets since 
your wilt was drawn up? 

3. 

Are you apt to outlive your executor? 
Have you changed your mind about your 
executor? — 

4. 

Have the needs of your immediate family 
increased or decreased? 

5. 

Have you moved to another state? Should 
your will be changed tocomply with laws 
of your new state? 

6. 

Did you forget to provide for a favorite 
charitable organization in your will? 



7 



Have you named a final or residual bene- 
ficiary, in case other beneficiaries die? 



If your answer to any of the above ques- 
tions is &quot;yes&quot; (except number 7}, then 
perhaps it is time to consult your attor- 
ney about a new or revised will. 

To aid In your thinking about wills, we 
will be glad to send you our free and in- 
formative booklet, &quot;37 Things People 
&apos;Know&apos; About Wills That Aren&apos;t Really

^&apos;Dianetics is the first book 
I&apos;ve ever read that 
makes sense out of 
the human mind.&quot; 



ED MORLER. MBA, Ph.D. Consultant/trainer 
Effective Communications Skills, New York 

&apos;And with a Ph.D. in human development 
and management you can bet I&apos;ve read plenty of 
books that tried, 

&quot;They all had bits and pieces of the picture, 
but Dianetics is the only book I&apos;ve been exposed 
to that takes up fundamentals not just symptoms. 
&quot;Wirh the insight I gamed from Dianetics, I 
understand where people are coming from. So 
I&apos;m much more successful at getting to conclu- 
sions we&apos;re all happv with, 

&quot;Several friends have said I seem more com- 
fonable lately, and it&apos;s true, 1 used to have such 
chronic tension in my shoulders that I was never 
relaxed. Through Dianetics I located the source 
of the tension and I haven&apos;t had it smce, 

&quot;I&apos;m enjoying life more I&apos;ve even taken up 
paintmg which 1 always wanted to do. In short, 
I&apos;m happier and more productive than I&apos;ve ever 
been, and that&apos;s a direct result oi Dianetics. 

&quot;I think Dianetics is 100 years ahead of its 
rime. It is without anv question the most impor- 
tant book on human behavior and the mind I&apos;ve 
ever read &quot;

times as much work as one person 
working alone,&quot; 

This volume of letters also dem- 
onstrates that Mead was one of the 
first anthropologists who wanted 
to study cultural change. Unhappily 
such was the definition of field re- 
search that she spent almost three 
decades collecting data on peoples 
who, it was hoped, had undergone 
little change. Then in 1953, the 
opportunity to study change was 
thrust upon her, for on her return 
to Manus, she found the people in 
the midst of a self-initiated revitali- 
zation movement. They told her: 
&quot;We have decided to have a new 
way of life, to throw away every 
evil custom of the past and set up 
our own form of life,&quot; Here is 
how she describes her reaction to 
this unanticipated field situation: 

I am fascinated with the type of 
commitment which I find I have to the 
accomplishment of their aspirations, 
I am not sure what it is. a reflection of 
a change in the whole climate of 
opinion in the world, or an accidental 
temperamental congruence, so that I 
feel closer to a people who believe 
that they can remake their culture if 
only they have the will to do so. or 
simply the human sympathy one feels 
for people whom one has known most 
of their lives, , . , In 1953 we are 
committed to mobility within one gen- 
eration and to building a world where 
the valuable unit is a human being 
and not simply membership in one kind 
of culture rather than another. And this 
means we cannot afford the aesthetic 
nostalgia for a &quot;whole culture&quot; and 
&quot;cultural depth,&quot; because we can only 
win this temporary battle with time by ] 
putting ourselves back of human aspira- 
tions, aroused by ideas of medicine, 
science, literacy and human dignity, , , . 
I had not guessed that there would I 
be a sort of spiritual change which! 
would be so gentle and so moving. It [ 
has the same sort of appeal that the I 
first songs of a revolution have, but! 
this has been a bloodless revolution f 
without violence of any sort and within 
the law — without any change in govern- 
ment in the larger sense but with this 
tremendous increase in local organiza-l 
tion and autonomy. The children are!

years ago, , , . It&apos;s all very good.

independent and dispassionate 
study of their peoples and institu- 
tions, despite the clear evidence 
of the multiplicity of benefits that 
such studies have conferred upon 
humankind, revolutionizing our 
thinking about sex roles, ethnic dif- 
ferences, dietary habits, health, 
medicine, and social change. Mean- 
while, in response to perilous bio- 
medical experimentations, the 
United States government has 
forced universities and related in- 
stitutions to protect human subjects 
from the broadest range of research 
activities, including those of 
fieldworkers, and thereby has re- 
quired investigators to state pre- 
cisely beforehand where, with 
whom, and with which procedures 
he (or she) will be working, while 
obtaining beforehand the signatures 
of their &quot;subjects&quot; to a document of 
&quot;informed consent.&quot; So hampered. 
Mead could scarcely have accom- 
plished her great series of field in- 
vestigations, and she has contended 
that anthropologists use no &quot;sub- 
jects&quot; but instead work coopera- 
tively with informants and native 
colleagues. Unhappily, neither her 
voice nor that of sympathetic col- 



leagues has been of influence upon 
federal policy makers. Further 
complicating the issue has been the 
heritage of United States involve- 
ment in the strife in Southeast Asia. 
Via their professional association, 
American anthropologists have im- 
posed upon themselves a politico- 
ethical code that would, if realisti- 
cally followed, convert inves- 
tigators into saintly idiots, without 
noticeably benefiting the peoples 
among whom they are working. It is 
greatly to Mead&apos;s credit that, at the 
height of this witchhunt within the 
American Anthropological Associ- 
ation, she spoke for sanity, toler- 
ance, a respect for all peoples, and a 
concern for the human and scientific 
values of fieldwork. This volume of 
letters helps us to appreciate her 
abilities and her moral courage.

In Pursuit of Birds 



by Michael Harwood 



The Audubon Society Field 
Guide to North American 
Birds. 2 Vols. Eastern Region, 
by John Bull and John Farrand, Jr. 
Western Region, by Miklos D. F. 
Udvardy. Alfred A. Knopf $7.95 
each; 775 pp., 855 pp., illus. 

When North American field bird- 
ing became a sport, as an antithesis 
to no-birds-barred gunning, a de- 
mand was created for pocket field 
guides to help the ordinary nature 
lover tell one feathered friend from 
another. The sport sprang from the 
scientific community&apos;s concern 
about diminishing numbers of birds, 
so the field guide art form came 
from a scientific background. Its 
first major expression, Frank M. 
Chapman&apos;s Handbook of Birds of 
Eastern North America (originally 
published in 1895), introduced the 
neophyte to the science, as well as 
the pleasure, of bird watching. But 
over the years the approach has 



changed considerably. Most field 
birders are not interested in sorting 
through complex details in order to 
identify birds. Is it or isn&apos;t it? that is 
the question. The current best 
handbook for these birders was in- 
troduced in 1966: The Birds of 
North America, by Chandler S.

text and pictures for individual 
species opposite each other on two-

the field didn&apos;t have to spend a lot 
of time flipping pages between text 
and pictures while the bird flew off.

OPERATION DOUBLE 
THE LAKE STATES. 




Paul Bunyan was a legend. 

But the huge harvest and regener- 
ation of the mighty forests that gave birth 
to that legend is a fact. More, it is a prac- 
tical lesson in the economics as well as 
ecology of the forest. 

The story spans a century and deals 
with social and economic perceptions as 
well as forest ecology. And it illustrates 
the difference between turn of the cen- 
tury logging and modem forestry. 

A hundred years ago this was the 



After 156 years, this Eastern Hemlock 
was still too small to harvest when 
the trees around it were cut down back 
in &apos;36. But with more room to 
grow, it doubled in size.

forests is one way 
to get big trees, 
faster. 



land of the Big Swedes and rough logging 
camps. The Great Northwoods. Loggers 
came to cut what they needed and move 
on. In terms of the times, this seemed 
no great evil. After all, &quot;forests were 
endless.&quot; There were no incentives to 
stay and replant. Supply exceeded de- 
mand tenfold. 

Enter Conservation. 

But the forests weren&apos;t endless. 
And by the 1920s the best timber in the 
region was gone. 

But if the 30s marked the end of 

one era, it also signaled the beginning of 

another: the age of 

conservation.

TREE IS WORKING 




I the land. They plant, thin, fertilize and 
:lirvest. Little is wasted. Even aspen, 
(,ce considered &quot;weed,&quot; is now used for 
; fper. In fact, nearly every part of every 
lirvested tree is used, ri^t down to the 
liSwdust. And where natural regenera- 
. tin is slow, foresters handplant the next 
L| neration of trees. 

The result is a better quality forest. 
( le that is actually more productive than 
luIBunyan&apos;s. 



Operation Double Tree: Why 
it&apos;s needed and how it works. 

In the U.S. alone, the demand 
for wood and paper products is ex- 
pected to doufc/e in less than 50 years. 

Yet today, only about one-third 
of this country&apos;s total forest is used 
to grow repeated crops of timber.

That works out to about one acre 
of trees for every man, woman and 
child. And each of those acres will 
■ have to be carefully managed to pro- 
vide a lifetime supply of wood products. 
Thus the reason behind Operation 
I Double Tree — the forest industry&apos;s 
name for intensive forest management 
that can double the amount of wood 
I grown on the nation&apos;s productive for- 
jestland. And do it in such a way that 
&apos;everyone can share in the benefits. 



This is what Operation Double Tree 
is all about. But it&apos;s more than words. 
Here are some examples of how this 
practical brand of twentieth century con- 
servation is working in the Lake States. 

Managing The New Forest. 

Item: In Minnesota, Boise Cascade 
gets more out of each harvest with a pro- 
gram that turns edgings, sawdust and 
other sawmill waste into useful wood by- 
products. Genetic research has even 
begun on the trees themselves, finding 
ways to make them grow faster and 
stronger. In the future these are the 
trees that will give us more wood, bet- 
ter wood, in a shorter amount of time. 

Item: At the Cloquet Forest Tree 
Nursery in Minnesota, Potiatch is raising 
250,000 seedlings a year in its green- 
house. Grown in small plastic containers, 
it takes the seedlings just six months to 
reach the size of two-year-old seedlings 
grown outdoors. 

Now, instead of waiting several 
years for natural regeneration, foresters 
can promptly replant harvest sites and 
give the new forests a healthy head start. 




seeds tor regeneration are collected by hand. 

Item: In Michigan, Packaging Cor- 
poration of America is recycling the 
sludge from its own water treatment 
plant to use as a fertilizer on crops of 
hybrid aspen. The trees are planted in 
rows, carefully spaced for weed control. 

Packaging Corporation foresters ex- 
pect their methods to produce mature 
aspen in as little as 15 or 20 years, com- 
pared to the 50- to 60-year period normal 
for wild, untended aspen. The new aspen 
will not only be ready for harvest sooner, 
but will have a better quality fiber and 
higher resistance to disease. 

Item: On Blandin Paper Company 
plantations in Minnesota, foresters and 



geneticists are working together to im- 
prove stands of trees. Using fast-growing 
white spruce on sites cleared of slower 
growing species, Blandin expects to dou- 
ble wood yield in the future. 

A Long Way To Go. 

So there&apos;s progress with Operation 
Double Tree in the Lake States, and in 
forests all across the country. But we 
stiU have a long way to go. 

On the average, industry lands grow 
50 percent more wood than the lands 




We depend on trees for countless everyday products. 

owned by government and private indi- 
viduals. Yet, even here, there&apos;s room for 
improvement. 

Overall, the American forest is only 
half as productive as it could be. And this 
is a waste. But by working together, 
all timber growers — private owners, in- 
dustry and government — can learn to 
make the most productive use of our re- 
maining commercial forests.* 

Industry has invested millions to 
make the concept a reality. But money 
isn&apos;t enough. 

Leaders and landowners alike must 
understand the problem. And, more im- 
portant, the solution.

Forest,&quot; American Forest Institute,

amateur interest might lead to seri- 
ous studies, so one is at least intro- 
duced to taxonomy. In any event, 
one starts with the loons and ends 
with the longspurs and snow bunt- 
ings in the major field guides be- 
cause that&apos;s the way the American 
Ornithologists&apos; Union presents 
them in the official Check-list. 

But now Knopf and the National 
Audubon Society have taken a new 
step in the march to the amateurs&apos; 
tune. In this two-volume field guide 
they have evidently decided to aim 
directly for the inexperienced birder 
to whom the science matters little 
and may even be confusing. They 
have ignored the checklist order to 
present the birds according to 
(roughly) shape, color, and habitat. 
The traditional use of stylized, 
painted illustrations has also been 
abandoned, in favor of color photo- 
graphs showing the birds &quot;as they 
really are.&quot; The sum total is often 
attractive, but it is not without its 
faults. 

First, the pluses: The texts are 
good to excellent, and a nice touch 
has been added. Each entry ends 
with a chatty note, which con- 
tributes to the enjoyment of the 
birds. Bull and Farrand in particu- 
lar seem to have taken splendid ad- 
vantage of extra text space opened 
by Knopf, which has printed the 
text on &quot;dictionary paper,&quot; a com- 
mendable choice that gives each 
book more pages without adding 
greatly to bulk or weight. The text 
pages are also nicely dressed here 
and there with black-and-white 
drawings. The photographs are gen- 
erally good, and some are truly fine, 
although occasionally the printing 
blurs and muddies them. The photo 
sections invite browsing, and many 
neophyte birders will enjoy flipping 
these pages to find the bird that has 
just puzzled them. They will doubt- 
less admire the way the plates have 
been keyed — thumb-indexed with 
bird-category shapes, and each 
category organized internally ac- 
cording to shapes and colors. Anc 
the less than expert can make some 
good use of the way the text is se&apos; 
up, not in the regular order, but b) 
habitats. Going birding tomorrow ir 
a California valley or oflF the Atlan 
tic shore? Then read up on the bird: 
in the &quot;Grasslands and Savannas 
segment of the Western guide o;| 
the &quot;Open Ocean&quot; section in th(| 
Eastern guide, to get acclimatei 
and whet your appetite.

However, the minuses are con- 
siderable. The photographs simply 
don&apos;t do justice to some species. 
Many plumage variations, particu- 
larly of immature and autumn birds, 
are left out of the photo sections, 
guaranteeing the neophyte&apos;s be- 
wilderment. And the value of the 
keys (aside from all the page turn- 
ing they require) is limited. The 
very example used in the Eastern 
guide to show how the keys work 
depends on a color and a habitat 
difference between the white- 
breasted nuthatch of the &quot;Decidu- 
ous Forest&quot; section and the red- 
breasted nuthatch of the &quot;Conifer- 
ous Forest,&quot; but the photograph 
given of the white-breasted nut- 
hatch shows a lot of pale cinnamon 
feathering underneath and places 
the bird in an evergreen setting. 
Identification is just not cut and 
dried, but when an editor starts 
divvying up species into habitats 
(not to mention distinctive colors) 
some arbitrary decisions have to be 
made. So in the Eastern guide, for 
instance, don&apos;t look for the great 
blue heron among the birds of the 
&quot;Seashore&quot; — or for any long- 
legged wader except the reddish 
egret. Don&apos;t look for the herring or 
the ring-billed gull there, either, or 
the common tern. They&apos;re all back 
in the &quot;Salt Marshes&quot; section or 
the &quot;Freshwater Marshes&quot; or in 
&quot;Lakes, Ponds, Rivers.&quot; Don&apos;t ex- 
pect to find nuances gracefully 
dealt with by these keys: don&apos;t look 
for the seaside and sharp-tailed 
sparrows in the same estuarine 
marsh, although likely they&apos;re both 
there; don&apos;t seek the photograph of 
the black-and-white warbler among 
the tree-clinging birds, nor that of 
the least sandpiper among the 
perching birds. 

Once a birder becomes serious 
about the sport and familiar with 
the territory, he or she will need to 
carry a more scientifically ordered 
and less-confining field guide, and 
will have to relegate these, with 
their good texts, to the role of tag- 
along or shelf reference. Still the 
Audubon-Knopf books are nice to 
look at and can be helpful, particu- 
larly to the beginning and casual 
birder.

New Telescope Design 
Makes Astronomy 
Accessible To Anyone! 

Astroscan 2001 - 
First &quot;Instanf&apos;-Use 
Astronomical Scope 

The amazing popularity of motion 
pictures such as Star Wars and Close 
Encounters and TV programs like 
Star Trek, Space 1999 and Logan&apos;s 
Run confirm the fact that Americans 
are looking skyward as never before. 
Astronomy is the NEW HOBBY of 
the 70&apos;s! 

Until now, though, getting into as- 
tronomy the right way has not been 
easy. Reason: the basic tool, the astro- 
nomical quality telescope has simply 
been too costly or too difficult to use. 

But, today, there&apos;s good news for 
would-be space watchers. Edmund 
Scientific, a company long known for 
coming up with top quality, afforda- 
ble scientific instruments has created 
an unusual looking, unusually effec- 
tive, unusually inexpensive telescope 
you can use to get into this exciting 
hobby. 

It&apos;s Astroscan 2001, a telescope so 
different and so precise even profes- 
sional astronomers have raved about 
it. And at just $149.95, it&apos;s one of the 
best telescope buys available. 

The wide-field Astroscan 2001 
gives you a window on a world be- 
yond that which you have ever 
known! You&apos;ll see the moon in crisp, 
clear detaU — Jupiter&apos;s gem-like satel- 
lites. You&apos;ll see glittering star clusters, 
colorful double stars, remote nebulae, 
the full celestial display of the night 
sky. It&apos;s an inspiring, awesome ex- 
perience you can enjoy for a lifetime! 

Edmund Scientific has devoted 
more than two years of concentrated 
engineering and product development 
to produce this special instrument. 
The objectives were simple but chal- 
lenging. The newest Edmund Scien- 
tific telescope had to: • give bright, 
clear views of the stars, the planets, 
the moon • be lightweight for extreme 
portability; convenient for hikes, bike 
trips, vacations • be simple to set up 
and use so anyone, even a young 
child, could enjoy the exciting hobby 
of astronomy • and, most important, 
be affordable! 



TIk Astroscan 2001 is among the most portable 
astronomical telescopes available. It sets up in sec- 
onds and is so easy to use even children can enjoy it 
on their oivn. 

The 2001 is a classic Newtonian re- 
flector telescope, using the same basic 
optical design as the largest observa- 
tory instruments. Light from distant 
celestial objects enters through an 
optically-coated window, is reflected 
and focused by a 4V4&quot; highly-polished 
parabolic mirror, reflected onto a sec- 
ondary flat-surfaced mirror and 
through a 28mm magnifying eye- 
piece, to your eye. The fine optics in 
Astroscan are better than those found 
in the world&apos;s best cameras. 

Astroscan weighs just over 10 
pounds and is only 17 inches long. 
The attracfively styled 2001 body is 
ruggedly constructed of high-impact 
red styrene. Its uniquely designed 
aluminum mount and fingertip focus- 
ing enables anyone to set up and use 
this fine instrument in minutes. 

The Edmund Scientific Astroscan 
2001 is now in full producdon and 
available for immediate shipment. 

To order Astroscan, simply send 
your check (or money order) for 
$149.95, plus 1.00 handling charge,

Celestial Events 

Thomas D. Nicholson 

Sun and Moon The sun is in the constellation Capricomus until 
mid-February. It moves into Aquarius on the 16th and into Pisces 
about March 12. Its motion through this part of the zodiac quickly 
takes it closer to the equatorial plane. This is evident in the rapid 
lengthening of daylight that we will experience (nearly three minutes 
a day in the mid-latitudes). By the end of February, the sun will be 
above the horizon for eleven hours and twenty minutes a day, an 
hour and ten minutes longer than at the beginning of the month. 

The moon is just past last-quarter on February 1, and will remain 
a morning object through new moon on the 7th. The evening cres- 
cent should be visible by the 10th. The moon will remain an object of 
the early evening sky through first-quarter on the 14th, full moon on 
the 22nci, and for several more nights as it wanes into its gibbous 
phase. Last-quarter moon will occur again on March 2 and new 
moon on March 8. On the 16th of February and again on the 15th of 
March, the moon will cover the star Aldebaran (the brightest star in 
Taurus). The occultation, as this event is called, will be visible in the 
northern part of North America on February 16, but will not be 
visible to North American observers during the March event. The 
moon is at perigee (nearest the earth) on the 5th and at apogee 
(farthest from the earth) on the 17th of February and March. 

Stars and Planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are bright and well 
placed in the evening sky during February. At dusk, Jupiter will be 
the brightest of the three, well up in the south, midway between 
Aldebaran and Castor and Pollux (the &quot;twins&quot; in Gemini). Mars is 
to the left and lower than Jupiter, close to Castor and Pollux and 
brighter than either. Saturn will rise in the east, very close to, and a 
little brighter than, Regulus in Leo. Jupiter sets shortly after mid- 
night. Mars a few hours before sunrise, and Saturn at sunrise. Venus 
is also an evening star, and you may be able to see it low in the west 
after sundown by mid-March. 

February 15: Early this evening (about 10:00 p.m., EST, and an 
hour earlier in each time zone to the west), the waxing gibbous moon 
moves slowly past Aldebaran, covering the star for some observers 
in North America. This evening, Saturn (near Regulus) is located 
directly opposite the sun. The planet rises at sunset, sets at sunrise, 
and then becomes an evening star. 

February 16: Mars has been moving nearer to Pollux. Tonight it 
is closest (conjunction). It then begins to move off to the right (west). 

February 17: The bright object nearest the moon tonight is Jupiter. 
It is the brightest starlike object in the sky. 

February 19: The moon passes beneath Mars today, nearest at 
about 3:00 p.m., EST, moving slowly away from the planet during 
the evening. Jupiter (to the right of Mars) becomes stationary among 
the stars. It had been moving slowly toward Aldebaran (to its right), 
but it now begins to move away to the east. 

February 21-22: The moon moves from the right to left of Saturn 
in the evening sky. Conjunction (when Saturn is nearest) is at 9:00 
A.M., EST, on the 22nd. 

February 27: Mercury, at superior conjunction, becomes an eve- 
ning star. 

March 2: Mars ends its westerly (retrograde) motion past Pollux. 
It now begins moving to the left (east) toward the star once more. 

March 12: Mercury and Venus are in conjunction in our evening 
sky, but they set too soon after sundown to be easily seen. 

■*Hold the Star Map so the compass direction you face is at the bottom; 
then match the stars in the lower half of the map with those in the sky near 
the horizon. The map is for 11:10 p.m., EST, on February 1; 10:15 p.m., 
EST, on February 15: 9:25 p.m., EST, on February 28; and 8:25 p.m. .EST, 
on March 15; but it can also be used for an hour before and after those times.

Additional Reading 



Sea Bird Diversity (p. 46) 

For a review of the topic of spe- 
cies distribution, see Robert H. 
Mac Arthur&apos;s Geographical Ecol- 
ogy: Patterns in the Distribution of 
Species (New York: Harper&amp;Row Publishers, 1972), which in- 
cludes an eight-page bibliography. 
Also general in its approach is 
Rachel L. Carson&apos;s The Sea 
Around Us (New York: New 
American Library, 1954, $1.50 in 
paperback). Carson provides read- 
able information about the physical 
structure of the seas and their nat- 
ural history. Well illustrated and 
charmingly written. Ocean Wan- 
derers by Ronald M. Lockley (Har- 
risburg: Stackpole Books, 1974) is 
the most recent general book on 
sea bird behavior and biology. 

A technical work directly related 
to the subject of sea bird species 
diversity in the Bering Sea is &quot;Did 
Santa Rosalia Like Sea-birds?&quot; by 
Miklos Udvardy, in Proceedings of 
the 16th International Ornithologi- 
cal Congress, 1976 (pp. 739-46), 
edited by H. J. Frith and J. H. 
Calaby. Udvardy compares the 
number of species per given area 
at diflFerent latitudes, and his article 
includes a short bibliography. Two 
works represent a summary of 
oceanographic work in the Bering 
Sea during the early 1970s. Bering 
Strait: The Regional Physical 
Oceanography, by L. K. Coach- 
man et al (Seattle: University of 
Washington Press, 1976) presents 
the most recent structural data for 
this part of the world. Oceanog- 
raphy of the Bering Sea (College, 
Alaska: Institute of Marine Sci- 
ence, University of Alaska, 1974), 
edited by Donald W. Hood and 
E. J. Kelley, contains information 
on fish and sea mammal productiv- 
ity and animal distribution for the 
Bering Sea region.

colorful treatment of the Turkoman 
people who originated buzkashi. 
Photographs and descriptive text 
fill pages 661-69. For general back- 
ground information on Afghanistan 
and its people, there is Louis Du- 
pree&apos;s Afghanistan (Princeton: 
Princeton University Press, 1973), 
which includes an excellent bibliog- 
raphy. 

One may see the game in action 
in the super 8, silent color movie, 
Buzkashi — The National Game, 
which was made in 1975 by Arthur 
C. Twomey for Grise Inc. This is 
released by Sound Book Press So- 
ciety of New York, with a teacher&apos;s 
guide, as number 6 in the series 
&quot;Afghanistan: The Land and the 
People.&quot; 

In 1968, Farrar, Straus published 
French writer Joseph Kessel&apos;s 
novel about buzkashi, The Horse- 
men, and the following year, John 
Frankenheimer directed a film 
based on Kessel&apos;s book. Louis 
Dupree discusses both in &quot;Kessel&apos;s 
&apos;The Horsemen&apos;: The Culture, the 
Book, the Movie,&quot; in the Novem- 
ber 1976 issue of Fieldstaff Re- 
ports. Copies available at $1.00

Crystal Symmetry (p. 64) 

Scientists in the Soviet Union 
are leaders in the field of crystal 
morphology, and the reader might 
therefore wish to consult the Eng- 
lish translation. Lectures on Crys- 
tal Morphology , by I. I. Shafranov- 
skii, published in 1973 by the Na- 
tional Bureau of Standards, U.S. 
Department of Commerce, Wash- 



ington, D.C. These lectures were 
given by Shafranovskii at various 
Russian universities in the recent 
past and contribute a good review 
of the subject. Two other sources 
can be consulted for background 
mineralogical information: John 
Sinkankas&apos;s Mineralogy for Ama- 
teurs (New York: Van Nostrand 
Reinhold Co., 1964) and Cornelius 
S. HUrlbut, Jr., and Cornelius 
Klein&apos;s Manual of Mineralogy, the 
nineteenth edition of which was 
published in 1977 by John Wiley&amp;Sons of New York. This latter 
work is the most recent in the long 
line begun by James Dwight Dana 
in the nineteenth century, and is 
often used as a reference manual 
in conjunction with beginning col- 
lege course work in mineralogy. 
The Sinkankas book is well illus- 
trated and very readable, and is 
slanted toward the identification of 
specimens by collectors. An enjoy- 
ably written addition to the subjec 
of symmetry in general is A. V 
Shubnikov&apos;s Symmetry in Scienct 
and Art, translated from the Rus 
sian by David Harker (New York 
Plenum Press, 1974). I 

Dust Bowl (p. 72) I 

Vance Johnson took a comprel 
hensive look at the dust storms ol 
the 1930s in Heaven&apos;s Tablelandi 
The Dust Bowl Story, which is pail 
of the series &quot;FDR and the Era cl 
the New Deal&quot; (New York: DJ 
Capo Press, Inc., 1974). A series (I 
articles by James C. Malin is ill 
teresting in that it assumes thl 
point of view that dust storms ha\| 
been a fact of life throughout nl 
corded history on the plains il 
America. Under the title &quot;Dul 
Storms&quot; these appeared in til 
May, August, and November 19&apos; i 
issues of Kansas Historical Qua 
terly (pp. 129-44, 265-96 at&apos; I 



106 



391-413, respectively). Long quo- 
tations from editorials and articles 
in newspapers of the 1890s make 
this fascinating reading. 

Photographer Margaret Bourke- 
White, coauthor with Erskine Cald- 
well of the depression-era You 
Have Seen Their Faces (New 
York: Arno Press, Inc., 1975, 
$15.00), was also responsible for 
a short, evocative memoir of her 
photographic work in the dust 
; bowl. The reader may wish to con- 
sult &quot;Dust Changes America,&quot; 
{The Nation, May 22, 1935, pp. 
597-98). Caroline A. Henderson, 
wife of a farmer and participant- 
observer of the dust storms, wrote 
&quot;Letters from the Dust Bowl&quot; (At- 
lantic Monthly, May 1936, pp. 
540-51) and &quot;Spring in the Dust 
Bowl&quot; (Atlantic Monthly, June 
1937, pp. 715-17). 

Reef Fishes (p. 84) 

Most of the literature on adaptive 
coloration and patterning in ani- 
mals relates to camouflage rather 
than to attraction. G. W. Barlow&apos;s 
article, &quot;The Attitude of Fish Eye- 
Lines in Relation to Body Shape 
and to Stripes and Bars,&quot; in Copeia 
(1972, pp. 4-12) takes this classical 
approach. Adaptive Coloration, by 
Hugh B. Cott (London: Methuen&amp;Co., 1940), although old, remains 
the best general survey of the sub- 
ject available. Eye signals, hiding, 
and ornamentation are all dealt 
with. Unfortunately, the work&apos;s 
illustrations, with the exception of 
the frontispiece, are all in black and 
white. Wolfgang Wickler&apos;s Mimicry 
n Plants and Animals (New York: 
McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1968) dis- 
pusses the color patterns of animals 
jind contains bibliographic cita- 
pons. This book is available in 
&apos;paperback for under $3.

JANUARY is the harcdest time of year for 
making charcoal to mellow the taste of Jack 
Daniel s Tennessee Whiskey. 

Just to begin, you need a hot cup of coffee 
and a good wool shirt. Then, you have to 
go out and chop these big maple logs into 
four-foot strips. Stack them in ricks. And 
burn them into the special 
charcoal that is used for 
mellowing Jack Daniel&apos;s. 
It&apos;s rugged work in the 
cold of January. But it 
accounts for a smooth 
whiskey, no matter 
when you sip it.

We&apos;ve Been Here 100 Years, a 

photography exhibit commemorat- 
ing the opening of the Museum at 
its present location, will be on view 
through February 1978 in the Hall 
of Northwest Coast Indians on the 
first floor. 

&quot;Creature Tales: A Theatre Pres- 
entation Based Upon the Legends 
and Poetry of Amphibians and Rep- 
tiles&quot; is a history, mythology, and 
interpretation of the origins of rep- 
tiles and amphibians, created by 
Richard Lewis and The Touchstone 
Players. Through dance, mime, 
music, and narration, &quot;Creature 
Tales&quot; will be presented on two 
Saturdays, February 11 and 18, at 
11:00 A.M. in the Museum&apos;s Edu- 
cation Hall, located on the first 
floor. 

Richard Lewis and his associate 
Joyce Timpanelli will also present 
Poems and Tales of Amphibians and 
Reptiles on Sunday, February 12, 
at 2:00 p.m. in the Hall of Mexico 
and Central America. And on Feb- 
ruary 15 and 22, at 7:00 p.m., Joyce 
Timpanelli will present some orig- 
inal and traditional tales in the Hall 
of Northwest Coast Indians. The 
first program will be &quot;Tales of 
Animal/Humans&quot;; the second, 
&quot;Tales of Death and Rebirth.&quot; 



All of these programs are for 
children and adults. They will each

In 1858, David Livingstone, on 
his third expedition to Africa, trav- 
eled up the Zambezi River deter- 
mined to bring Christianity, com- 
merce, and civilization to the re- 
motest villages. He was the first 
white man to penetrate the area. On 
March 1, 1978, African explorer 
and naturalist Quentin Keynes will 
narrate The Zambezi, I Presume, 
a film that took him several years 
to make. Using the landmarks thai 
Livingstone mentioned in his writ- 
ings, Keynes retraced Living- 
stone&apos;s route. He discovered a vil 
lage where a 106-year-old mar 
remembered seeing the first whitf 
man (who fits Livingstone&apos;s de| 
scription exactly) and was led to ai 
ancient baobab tree carved witl 
Livingstone&apos;s initials. The film, ai 
hour&apos;s worth of Africa, wildlife 
and history-come-to-life, will b 
shown at 8:00 p.m. in the Museum&apos; 
auditorium. Tickets for associat 
members and the public are $2.0 
and will be available at the aud 
torium door half an hour before th 
program begins. Participating an, 
donor members admitted free.

The new Toyota Celica. It&apos;s here now. A 
car which meets or exceeds all 1980 
Federal fuel economy and safety stan- 
dards. The latest in Toyota engineering 
advancements and wind tunnel refine- 
ments have produced an aerodynam- 
ic work of art. The Celica GT Liftback 
(pictured), GT and ST Sport Coupes. 

A beautiful car and a fine machine. The GT Liftback aerodynamics have 
contributed to increased interior room (4&quot; at shoulders), stability accelera- 
tion and efficiency. The handling formula includes MacPherson strut front 
suspension, power assisted front disc brakes, and steel belted ra- 
^ dials. The Celica&apos;s cockpit instrumentation is a beautiful 
example of functional engineering. And comfort is 
&quot;^exemplified by the reclining bucket seats with newly de- 
signed adjustable driver&apos;s seat lumbar support. 

^The beauty is value. The 1978 Celica GT Liftback delivers 
Toyota dependability and economy In EPA tests the 
&quot;Celica GT Liftback was rated at 34 highway, 20 city. 
These EPA ratings are estimates. Your mileage will 
vary depending on your driving habits and your car&apos;s condition 
and equipment. California ratings will be lower. GT Liftback op- 
tions are for personal taste. Like power 
steering, automatic transmission 
or the new sun roof (available 
Jan. 1978). The 1978 Celica.

The gutsy excitement of a sports car. Enough carrying capac- 
ity to surprise owners of cars much larger. Toyota has^ 
brought fun and practicality together And combined it with^ 
famous Toyota durability and value. The beautiful result— 
the 1978 Toyota Corolla SR-5 Liftback. 

,^ Driving made fun again. Corolla Liftback puts the 
fun back in driving because it&apos;s got many of the de- &apos; 
sign features of a sports car. Like a standard 
5-speed overdrive transmission. So you get&apos; 
maximum performance from the peppy 1 .6 liter engine. Corolla 
also has MacPherson strut front suspension and steel belted 
radial-ply tires. So it handles as crisply as it moves out. 





&apos;/ Sporty cars can be roomy too. Corolla Li ft back&apos;s big rear 

hatch allows you to easily load objects many bigger cars can&apos;t 

handle. And the split, fold-down rear seat lets you take any 

combination of people and gear along for the ride. That&apos;s why 

a pair of skis and your best friend can share the back of a Corolla 

Liftback with no hard feelings. 

A very together car. Corolla&apos;s unitized-body construe 
tion helps keep your car from getting rattled by a little^- 
thing like a bumpy road. Power assisted front disc 
brakes help you keep your cool, &apos;cause they&apos;re fade re- 
sistant. The Corolla SR-5 Liftback. It&apos;s the sporty car 
with room, Vrr-room, and Toyota durability Now you 
know why we say &quot;If you can find a better built small car 
&quot;&apos; an a Toyota... buy it!&quot;

Authors 



In 1971, while searching for 
caves in connection with his re- 
search on the paleoecology of early 
humans in North America, Michael 
G. Petit learned of the Eagle Creek 
bat cave in Arizona. Hooked on the 
bats, he observed the colony in the 
cave over a period of six years and 
documented its precipitous decline. 
An assistant professor at Colorado 
State University, Petit has worked 
as a house mover, pool hustler, and 
venereal disease control officer for 
the U.S. Navy. He tap dances and 
acts in university theatrical produc- 
tions during the academic year. 





David Herlihy teaches history at 
Harvard University, where he lives 
with his wife, Patricia, five sons, 
and one daughter. As comasters of 
Mather House, the Herlihys &quot;pre- 
side over a community of more than 
four hundred bright and active 
young men and women.&quot;&quot; Today&quot;s 
students, Herlihy has found, are in- 
terested in social history in general 
and women&quot;s history in particular. 
He has been concentrating on the 
history of the family in the Middle 
Ages and the Renaissance, and 
plans to investigate the life cycles 
of Florence&quot;s citizens in the four- 
teenth and fifteenth centuries. 



As a Peace Corps volunteer in 
1966, Kenneth W. Smith arrived in 
Santiago Sacatepequez, Guate- 
mala, on the eve of All Saints&quot; Day. 
The first thing he saw on waking up 
the next morning were the huge 
kites flying over the nearby ceme- 
tery. Several years after completing 
his tour of duty. Smith returned to 
Santiago, this time on a Fulbright- 
Hays scholarship. His purpose was 
to study the village&apos;s church rec- 
ords as a means of chronicling the 
political and economic changes in 
the community since the Spanish 
conquest. Smith is now using this 
research in his dissertation for a 
doctorate in anthropology, which 
he expects to receive from the Uni- 
versity of Minnesota.

Thoreau&apos;s Unfinished Business 

by Loren Eiseley 



Self-knowledge was to be 
sought beyond the bounds 
of Walden Pond 

The life of Henry David Thoreau 
has been thoroughly explored for 
almost a century by critics and biog- 
raphers, yet the mystery of this un- 
traveled man who read travel litera- 
ture has nowhere been better ex- 
pressed than by his old walking 
companion Ellery Channing, who 
once wrote: &quot;I have never been able 
to understand what he meant by his 
life. Why was he so disappointed 
with everybody else? Why was he 
so interested in the river and the 
woods . . . ? Something peculiar 
here I judge.&quot;&apos; 

If Channing, his personal friend, 
was mystified, it is only to be ex- 
pected that as Thoreau&apos;s literary 
stature has grown, the ever present 
enigma of his life and thought has 
grown with it. Wright Morris, the 
distinguished novelist and critic, 
has asked, almost savagely, the 
same questions in another form. 

In a less personal context he 
quotes from Thoreau, who spent 
two years upon the Walden experi- 
ment and then abandoned it, &quot;If we 
are alive let us go about our busi- 
ness.&quot; &quot;But,&quot; counters Morris 
brutally, &quot;what business?&quot; Tho- 
reau fails to inform us. In the words 
of Morris, Walden was the opening 
chapter of a life, one that enthralls 
us, but with the remaining chapters 
missing. 

For more than a decade after 
Walden was composed, Thoreau 
continued his intensive exploration 
of Concord, its inhabitants and its 
fields, but upon the &quot;business&quot; for 
which he left Walden he is oddly 
cryptic. Once, it is true, he muses 
in his journal that &quot;the utmost pos- 
sible novelty would be the diflFer-

Eiseiey. To be published by Times Books in June 1978

ence between me and myself a year 
ago.&quot; He must then have been 
about some business, even though 
the perceptive critic Morris felt he 
had already performed it and was at 
loose ends and groping. The truth 
is that the critic, in a timeless sense, 
can be right and in another way 
wrong, for looking is in itself the 
business of art. 

Thoreau was indeed a spiritual 
wanderer through the deserts of 
the modem world. Almost by in- 
stinct he rejected that beginning 
wave of industrialism that was later 
to so entrance his century. He also 
rejected the peace he had found on 
the shores of Walden Pond, the 
alternate glazing and reflection of 
that great natural eye which impar- 
tially received the seasons. It was, 
in the end, too great for his endur- 
ance, too timeless. He was a rest- 
less pacer of fields, a reader who, in 
spite of occasional invective di- 
rected against those who presumed 
to neglect their homes for far 
places, nevertheless was apt with 
allusions drawn from travel litera- 
ture and quick to discern in man un- 
charted spaces. 

&quot;Few adults,&quot; once remarked 
Emerson, Thoreau&apos;s one-time men- 
tor and friend, &quot;can see nature.&quot; 
Thoreau was one of those who 
could. Moreover he saw nature as 
another civilization, a thing of 
vaster laws and vagaries than that 
encompassed by the human mind. 
When he visited the Maine woods 
he felt its wind upon him like the 
closing of a dank door from some 
forgotten cellar of the past. 

Was it some curious midnight 
impulse to investigate such matters 
that led Thoreau to abandon the 
sunny hut at Walden for &quot;other 
business&quot;? Even at Walden he had 
heard, at midnight, the insistent 
fox, the &quot;rudimental man,&quot; bark- 
ing beyond his lighted window in 
the forest. The universe was in mo- 



tion, nothing was fixed. Nature was 
&quot;a prairie for outlaws,&quot; violent, 
unpredictable. Alone in the en- 
virons of Walden, Thoreau wan- 
dered in the midst of that greater 
civilization he had discovered as 
surely as some monstrous edifice 
come suddenly upon in the Maya 
jungles. He never exclaimed about 
the Indian trails seen just at dusk in 
a winter snowfall — neither where 
they went nor upon what prairie 
they vanished or in what direction. 
He never ventured to tell us, but he 
was one of those great artist-scien- 
tists who could pursue the future 
through its past. This is why he 
lives today in the hearts of young 
and old alike, &quot;a man of surfaces,&quot; 
but such surfaces — the arrowhead, 
the acorn, the oak leaf, the inde- 
structible thought print headed to- 
ward eternity. 

Thoreau, in his final journals, had 
said that the ancients with their 
gorgons and sphinxes could imagine 
more than existed. Modern men, by 
contrast, could not imagine so 
much as exists. For more than one 
hundred years that statement has 
stood to taunt us. Every succeed- 
ing year has proved Thoreau right. 
The one great hieroglyph, nature, 
is as unreadable as it ever was and 
so is her equally wild and unpre 
dictable offspring, man. Like ThO&apos; 
reau, the examiner of lost and 
fragile surfaces of flint, we are onl&gt;by indirection students of man. Wt 
are, in actuality, students of tha 
greater order known as nature. It i 
into nature that man vanishes 
&quot;Wildness is a civilization othe 
than our own,&quot; Thoreau had ven 
tured. Out of it man&apos;s trail hai 
wandered. He had come with th&apos; 
great ice, drifting before its vie 
lence, scavenging the flints it ha 
dropped. Whatever he was now, th 
ice had made him, the breath fror 
the dank door, great cold, and in&apos;i 
placable winters.

Thoreau in the final pages of 
Walden creates a myth about a 
despised worm that surmounts 
death and bursts from its hidden 
chamber in a wooden table. Was 
the writer dreaming of man, man 
freed at last from the manacles of 
the ice? Is not the real business of 
the artist to seek for man&apos;s salva- 
tion, and by understanding his in- 
gredients to make him less of an 
outlaw to himself, civilize him, in 
fact, back into that titanic other- 
ness, that star&apos;s substance from 
which he had arisen? Perhaps en- 
camped sufficiently in the great 
living web we might emerge again, 
not into the blind snow-covered eye 
of Walden&apos;s winter, but into the 
eternal spring man dreams of every- 
where and nowhere finds. 

Man, himself, is Walden&apos;s eye of 
ice and eye of summer. What now 
makes man an outlaw, with the fox 
urgent at his heels, is that one of his 
eyes is gray and wintry and blind, 
while with the other is glimpsed 
another world just tantalizingly 
visible and dismissed as an illusion. 
What we know with certainty is that 
a creature with such disparate 
vision cannot long survive. It was 
that knowledge that led Thoreau to 
strain his eyesight till it ached and 
to record all he saw. A flower might 
open a man&apos;s mind, a box tortoise 
endow him with mercy, a mist en- 
able him to see his own shifting and 
uncertain configuration. But the 
alchemist&apos;s touchstone in Thoreau 
was to give him sight, not power. 
Only man&apos;s own mind, the artist&apos;s 
mind, can change the winter in 
man. 

On July 14 of the year 1973, I 
awoke at dawn and saw above my 
head the chisel marks on an eight- 
eenth-century beam in the Concord 
Inn. As I strolled up the street to- 
ward the cemetery I saw a few 
drifters, black and white, stirring 
from their illegal night&apos;s sleep

among the gravestones. Later I 
came to the Thoreau family plot 
and saw the little yellow stone 
marked &quot;Henry,&quot; which no one is 
any longer sure indicates the pre- 
cise place where he lies. Perhaps 
there is justice in this obscurity be- 
cause the critics are also unsure of 
the contradictions and intentions of 
his journal, even of the classic 
Walden. A ghost then, of shifting 
features, peers out from between 
the gravestones, unreal, perhaps 
uninterpreted still. 

I turned away from the early 
morning damp for a glimpse of the 
famous pond which in the country 
of my youth would have been called 
a lake. It was still an unearthly 
reflection of the sky, even if here 
and there beer bottles were bobbing 
in the shallows. I walked along the 
tracks of the old railroad where 
Thoreau used to listen to the tele- 
graph wires. He had an eye for the 
sharp-edged artifact, I thought. He 
would have transmitted the bobbing 
bottles, the keys to beer cans, into 
cosmic symbols, just as he had 
sensed all past time in the odors of 
a swamp. &quot;All the ages are repre- 
sented still,&quot; he had said, with 
nostrils flaring above the vegeta- 
tion-choked water, &quot;and you can 
smell them out.&quot; 

As for arrowheads, he says in a 
memorable passage, &quot;You would 
say it had rained arrowheads for 
they lie all over the surface of 
America. They are sown like grain 
. . . over the earth. Each one yields 
me a thought. ... It is humanity in- 
scribed on the face of the earth. It 
is a footprint — rather a mindprint — 
left everywhere. . . . They are not 
fossil bones, but, as it were, fossil 
thoughts forever reminding me of 
the mind that shaped them. I am on 
the trail of mind.&quot; 

Some time ago in a graduate 
seminar in honor of a visiting emi- 
nent prehistorian I watched the 
scholar and his listeners grapple 
with the significance of an anciently 
shaped stone. Not one of those 
present, involved as they were with 
semantic involutions, could render 
up so simple an expression as 
&quot;mindprint.&quot; The lonely follower 
of the plow at Concord had pro- 
vided both art and anthropology 
with an expression of horizon- 
reaching application that they have 
inexplicably chosen to ignore. 

Mindprints are what the first men 
left, mindprints will be what the last 



man leaves, even if it is only a beer 
can dropped rolling from the last 
living hand or a sagging picture in a 
ruined house. 

Thoreau had extended his 
thought prints to something beyond 
what we of this age would call the 
natural. He would read them into 
nature itself, see, in other words, 
some kind of trail through that 
prairie for outlaws that had always 
intimidated him. On mountaintops, 
he had realized a star&apos;s substance, 
sensed a nature &quot;not bound to be 
kind to man.&quot; Nevertheless he con- 
fided firmly to his diary, &quot;the earth 
which I haveseen cannot bury me.&quot; 
He searches desperately, all senses 
alert, for a way to read these greater 
hieroglyphs in which the tiny inter- 
pretable minds of our forerunners 
are embedded. We. with a sharper 
knowledge of human limitations and 
a devotion to the empirical fact, 
may deny to ourselves the reality 
of this other civilization within 
whose laws and probabilities we 
exist. Thoreau reposed faith in the 
consistency of nature&apos;s habits, but 
only up to a point, for he was a stu- 
dent of change. 

Now Thoreau was a stay-at- 
home who traveled much in his 
mind, both in travel literature and 
beside Walden Pond. I, by circum- 
stance, directly after delivering a 
lecture at Concord and gazing in 
my turn at Walden, was forced im- 
mediately to turn and fly west to 
the badlands and dinosaur-haunted 
gulches of Montana, some of its 
natives wild, half-civilized still. As 
I followed our mixed-breed Chey- 
enne, as ambivalent toward us as 
the savage blood in his veins de- 
manded, it came to me, as it must 
have come to many others, that 
seeing is not the same thing as 
understanding. 

One man sees with indiflFerence 
a leaf fall; another with the vision 
of Thoreau invokes the whole of 
that nostalgic world that we call 
autumn. One man sees a red fox 
running through a shaft of sunlight 
and lifts a rifle; another lays a re- 
straining hand upon his com- 
panion&apos;s arm and says, &quot;Please. 
There goes the last wild gaiety in 
the world. Let it live, let it run.&quot; 
This is the role of the alchemist, 
the true, if sometimes inarticulate, 
artist. He transmutes the cricket&apos;s 
song in an autumn night to an ach- 
ing void in the heart; snowflakes 
become the flying years. And 



when, as archeologist, he lifts from 
the encrusting earth those forgotten 
objects Thoreau called &quot;fossil 
thoughts,&quot; he is giving depth and 
tragedy and catharsis to the one 
great drama that concerns us most, 
the supreme mystery, man. Only 
man is capable of comprehending 
all he was and all that he has failed 
to be. 

On those sun-beaten uplands 
over which we wandered, every 
chip of quartzite, every patinized 
flint gleamed in our eyes as large as 
the monuments of other lands. Our 
vision in that thin air was incredibly 
enhanced and prolonged. Thoreau 
had conceived of nature as a single 
reflecting eye. the Walden eye of 
which he strove to be a solitary 
part, to apprehend with all his 
being. It was chance that had 
brought me in the span of a day to 
the dinosaur beds of Montana. 
Thoreau would have liked that. He 
had always regarded such places as 
endowed with the vapors of Nox, 
places where rules were annulled. 
He had called arrowheads mind- 
prints. What then would he have 
termed a tooth of Tyrannosaiinis 
rex held in my palm? The sign of 
another civilization, another order 
of mind? Or that tiny Cretaceous 
mammal that was a step on the way 
to ourselves? Surely it represented 
mind in embryo, our mind, but not 
of our devising. What would he 
have called it— that miracle of a by- 
gone moment, the annulment of 
what had been, to be replaced by an 
eye, the artist&apos;s eye, that nature 
had never heretofore produced 
among her creatures? Would he 
have simply called it &quot;nature,&quot; as 
we sometimes do, scarcely know- 
ing how to interpret the looming in-

The Franklin Library presents 

THE GREATEST BOOKS 
OF THE 20th CENTUW 

A complete library of this century&apos;s greatest masterpieces, 

chosen by a distinguished international Board of Advisors. 

Each book fully bound in leather and ornamented in 22 karat gold. 



Available by direct subscription only. 
Subscription deadline: March 31, 1978. 



THE TWENTIETH CENTURY has 
produced more great books than all pre- 
vious centuries combined. 

It has been the century of the novel — 
an art form largely perfected in our time. 
It has been an age of great drama and 
poetry. And it has been a time of 
unprecedented grovrth in knowledge — 
clearly explained in books by the fore- 
most scientists, philosophers, biogra- 
phers and historians of our day. 

And now, from this vast treasury of 
major works, one of the most distin- 
guished advisory boards ever assembled 
will select those which stand out as the 
greatest books of the twentieth century. 
Fifty towering masterpieces. The essen- 
tial volumes of our time. The very best 
writing of the modern world. 

Furthermore, this collection of The 
Greatest Books of the Twentieth Century 
will be published in a single, very special 
edition. Each volume will be set apart 
from the ordinary by individual design, 
full leather binding and rich ornamenta- 
tion in 22 karat gold. And each will be 
privately printed and bound for subscrib- 
ers by The Franklin Library, the world&apos;s 
leading publisher of limited edition 
books in fine leather bindings. 

A treasury of the century&apos;s masterpieces 

A major portion of the collection will 
be devoted to the most compelling nov- 
els of the twentieth century: The Grapes 
of Wrath by John Steinbeck. Doctor 
Zhivago by Boris Pasternak. Look 
Homeward, Angel by Thomas Wolfe. 
The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann. 
The Trial by Franz Kafka. 

In addition, there will be collections 
of stories by the master storytellers of 
our time: Ernest Hemingway. James 
Joyce. Jorge Luis Borges. Drama by the 
century&apos;s leading playwrights: Bernard 
Shaw. Anton Chekhov. Eugene O&apos;Neill. 
Poetry by the modern masters: W. H. 
Auden, Robert Frost, William Butler 
Yeats. Biographies and autobiographies 
that recount the fascinating lives of great 
international figures. And brilliant ac- 
counts of the history, philosophy and 
science of our time. 

Leather-bound volumes — individually 
designed and illustrated 

All fifty volumes will be newly designed 
for this private edition. And each will be 
different from every other — in design, 
format and overall dimensions. 

Each volume will be fully bound in 
leather. And leathers of different grains 
and colors will be used to create a har- 
monious yet varied appearance through- 
out the collection. The covers and the 
spine of each book will all be richly 
ornamented with 22 karat gold. The 
spine of every book will have raised 
horizontal &quot;hubs,&quot; and the page edges 









y 



^^^,. 




Each volume will be beautifully crafled of leather, gold and moire fabric. 



will be gilded with 22 karat gold — 
the time-honored manner of enriching 
fine volumes. 

Each volume will be printed on spe- 
cially milled bookpapers and the end- 
leaves will be of lustrous moire fabric. 

Original works of art will be com- 
missioned to illustrate many of the books 
and will appear only in these leather- 
bound volumes. Famous works by out- 
standing artists of the past will grace 
other books in this collection. This taste- 
ful use of illustration will add dramati- 
cally to the pleasure of reading and 
owning these magnificent books. 

A single edition for subscribers only 

This exclusive edition of The Greatest 
Books of the Twentieth Century will be 
privately printed and bound solely for 
those who subscribe to the complete col- 
lection. None of these leather-bound 
volumes will be made available in book- 
stores, nor will any ever be reissued. 

The subscription rolls are now open. 
There is a firm limit of one subscription 
per person, and subscriptions will be 
accepted only until March 31, 1978. The 
edition will then be closed and no further 
applications ever accepted. Thus, the 
edition will be permanently limited.

have been too wise, too close to 
earth, too intimidated, to have 
called such ajoumal human. It was 
palpably inscribed from a star&apos;s 
substance. Tiny and brief in that 
journal were the hieroglyphs of 
man. Like Thoreau, we had come 
to the world&apos;s end, but not to the 
end of nature, not to the end of 
time. All that could be read was 
that we had a past; that was some- 
thing no other life on the planet had 
learned. There was, we had also 
ascertained, a future. 

In the meantime, Thoreau would 
have protested, there is the eye, the 
sun and the eye. &quot;Nothing must be 
postponed; find eternity in each 
moment.&quot; But how few of us are 
endowed to sustain Thoreau&apos;s al- 
most diabolical vision. Here and 
here alone the true alchemist must 
come to exist in each of us. It is 
ours to transmute, not iron, not 
copper, not gold, but our tracks 
through nature, see them finally 
attended by self-knowledge, by the 
vision of the universal eye — that 
faculty possessed by the alchemist 
at Walden Pond. 

But why, why had he left the 
sunny doorway of his hut in Walden 
for unknown mysterious business? 
Had he not written as though he 
had settled down forever? Why had 
Channing chronicled Thoreau&apos;s 
grievous disappointments? What 
had he been seeking and how had it 
affected him? If Walden was the 
opening chapter of a life, might not 
there still be a lurking message, a 
termination, a final chapter beyond 
his recorded death? 

It was evident that he had seen 
the whole of American culture as 
copper tinted by its antecedents, 
its people shadowy and gigantic as 
figures looming indistinctly in some 
Indian-summer haze. He had writ- 
ten of an old tree near Concord 
penetrated by a flying arrow with 
the shaft still attached. Some of the 
driving force of that flint projectile 
still persisted in his mind. Perhaps 
indeed those points that had once 
sung their message through every 
glade of the eastern woodland had 
spoken louder than the telegraph 
harp to which his ears had been 
attuned at Walden. Protest as he 
would, cultivate sauntering as he 
would, abhor as he would the root- 
less travelers whose works he read 
by lamplight, he was himself the 
eternal traveler. On the mountains 
of New Hampshire he had found 



&quot;small and almost uninhabited 
ponds, apparently without fish, 
sources of rivers, still and cold, 
strange as condensed clouds.&quot; He 
had wandered without realizing it 
back into the time of the first con- 
tinental ice recession. 

&quot;It is not worth the while to go 
around the world to count the cats 
in Zanzibar,&quot; he once castigated 
some luckless explorer, but why 
then this peering into lifeless tarns 
or engrossing himself with the 
meteoritic detritus of the Appala- 
chians? Did he secretly wish to 
come to a place of no more life, 
where a man might stiffen into im- 
mobility as I had found myself 
freezing into the agate limbs of 
petrified trees in Montana? He ad- 
mitted that he would gladly fall 
&quot;into some crevice along with 
leaves and acorns.&quot; &quot;There is no 
more fatal blunderer,&quot; he pro- 
tested, &quot;than he who consumes the 
greater part of life getting a living.&quot; 
He had emphasized that contempla- 
tive view at Walden, lived it, in 
fact, to the point where the world 
came finally to accept him as a kind 
of rural Robinson Crusoe whom, as 
the cities grew, it might prove wise 
to emulate. 

&quot;I sat in my sunny doorway,&quot; 
he ruminated, &quot;from sunrise till 
noon, rapt in revery, amidst the 
pines and hickories and sumachs, 
in undisturbed solitude and still- 
ness, while the birds sang around 
or flitted noiseless through the 
house, until by the sun falling in at 
my west window, or the noise of 
some traveler&apos;s wagon on the dis- 
tant highway, I was reminded of the 
lapse of time. I grew in those sea- 
sons like corn in the night.&quot; 

This passage would seem to 
stand for the serene and timeless 
life of an Oriental sage, a well- 
adjusted man, as the psychiatrists 
of our day would have it. Neverthe- 
less this benign fa9ade is deceptive. 
There is no doubt that Thoreau 
honestly meant what he said at the 
time he said it, but the man was 
storm-driven. He would not be con- 
tent with the first chapter of his life; 
he would, like a true artist, dredge 
up dreams even from the bottom of 
a pond. 

In the year 1837 Thoreau con- 
fided abruptly to his journal: &quot;Truth 
strikes us from behind, and in the 
dark.&quot; Thoreau&apos;s life was to be 
comparatively short and ill-starred. 
Our final question must, therefore, 



revolve, not about wanderings in 
autumn fields, not the drowsing in 
pleasant doorways where time 
stood still forever, but rather upon 
the leap of that lost arrow left quiv- 
ering in an ancient oak. It was, in 
symbol, the hurtling purposeful 
arrow of a seemingly aimless life. 
It has been overlooked by Tho- 
reau&apos;s biographers, largely because 
they have been men of the study or 
men of the forest. They have not 
been men of the seashore or men 
gifted with the artist&apos;s eye. They 
have not trudged the naturalist&apos;s 
long miles through sea sand, where 
the war between two elements 
leaves even the smallest object 
magnified, as the bleached bone or 
broken utensil can be similarly 
magnified only on the dead lake 
beaches of the west. 

Thoreau had been drawn to Cape 
Cod in 1849, a visit he had twice re- 
peated. It was not the tourist resort 
it is today. It was still the country 
of men on impoverished farms, who 
went to sea or combed the beaches 
like wreckers seeking cargo. On 
those beaches, commented Tho- 
reau, in a work that he was destined 
never to see in print, &quot;a house was 
rarely visible . . . and the solitude 
was that of the ocean and the desert 
combined.&quot; Here, recorded the 
chronicler, was a wilder, less hu- 
man nature. Objects on the beach, 
he noted, were always more gro- 
tesque and dilated than upon ap- 
proach they proved to be. A cast-up 
pair of gloves suggested the reality 
of hands. 

Thoreau&apos;s account, in Cape Cod, 
of the &quot;charity house&quot; to which his 
wanderings led him takes on a spe- 
cial meaning. I think it embodies 
something of a final answer to 
Channing&apos;s question about Tho- 
reau&apos;s disappointment in his fellow 
men. Published two years after his 
death, it contains his formulation 
of the end of his business, or per- 
haps I should say, of his quest. Hid-, 
den in what has been dismissed as a* 
mere book of travel is an episode 
as potentially fabulous as that of 
Melville&apos;s great white whale. 

First, however, I must tell the 
story of another coast because it 
will serve to illuminate Thoreau&apos;s 
final perception. A man, a shore 
dweller on Long Island, told me of 
his discovery in a winter dawn. All 
night there had been a heavy surl&apos; 
and freezing wind. When he came 
to stroll along his beach at morninj

A Way of Life Disappears 

It happened so quickly few men took heed. Within the span of a man&apos;s lifetime, a 
civilization that had endured for more than 12,000 years was virtually erased from the earth. 

Beginning in 1830 with the Indian Removal Act, the Indian was systematically and 
mercilessly driven from the land of his forefathers. By the time of the Battle of Wounded Knee 
in 1890, only a shadow remained of what was once a proud and glorious people. 

But what of the Indian before 1830? What do we know, as the 20th century inhabi- 
tants of this wonderous land, about the people who first settled here — the true native Americans? 

It is difficult to recognize the early Indians as individuals with human strengths and 
weaknesses. To fully understand their remarkable culture, we must examine the works that 
were meant to preserve the legacy of the past for future generations.

A Publication of Historical Significance 

The McKenney&amp;? Hall History of the Indian Tribes 
of J^orth America is the single most important account of the 
American Indian. Long recognized as a work of monumental 
stature, it has remained relatively unknown to the public only 
because of its extreme rarity. 

The American Museum of Natural History takes 
great pride in announcing the reissuance of McKenney&amp;&quot; 
Hall&apos;s work in a superb, leatherbound format. Published for 
the Museum by Volair Limited in an edition strictly limited 
to 5,000 two-volume sets. 

The work consists of the biographies and litho- 
graphic portraits of 120 prominent American Indians, plus 
3 scenic images of Indian life. The fascinating text is excep- 
tionally rich in anecdote and personal drama. The brilliant 
lithographs are among the only portraits from the great 
Indian nations, including the most prominent chiefs: Keokuk, 
Red Jacket, and Black Hawk. 

Captured here are the remnants of a dream : medicine 
men and fearless hunters, young squaws and brave warriors 
— all who lived and died long before the days of photography. 
Here too are the colorful and striking costumes, the feathered 
peacepipes and ceremonial weapons of a proud people. 

These are volumes of immense beauty and power, 
of even greater importance now than when first issued 141 
years ago. Indeed, The History of the Indian Tribes of J^orth 
America has established itself as an essential element of our 
heritage and history as a nation.

history of the work — the first time this valuable information 
has been assembled. 

Dr. Viola is director of the National Anthropological

he had immediately seen a lifeboat 
cast upon the shingle and a still, 
black figure with the eastern sun 
behind it on the horizon. Gripped 
by a premonition he ran forward. 
The seaman in oilskins was alone 
and stiflFly upright. A compass was 
clutched in his numb fingers. The 
man was sheeted in ice. Ice over 
his beard, his clothing, his hands, 
ice over his fixed, open eyes. Had 
he made the shore alive but too 
frozen to move? No one would ever 
know, just as no one would ever 
know his name or the sinking ves- 
sel from which he came. With des- 
perate courage he had steered a 
true course through a wild night of 
breakers only to freeze within sight 
of help. 

In those fishing days on Cape 
Cod, Thoreau came to know many 
such stories — vessels without 
weather warnings smashed in the 
winter seas, while, perhaps, a pit- 
tance of soaked men gained the 
shore. The sea, the intolerable sea, 
tumbled with total indiflFerence the 
bodies of the dead or the living who 
were tossed up through the grinding 
surf of winter. These were common 
events in the days of sail. 

The people who gained a scant 
living along that coast entertained, 
early in the nineteenth century, the 
thought that a few well-stocked 
sheds, or charity houses, might en- 
able lost seamen who made the 
shore to warm and feed themselves 
among the dunes till rescued. The 
idea was to provide straw and 
matches and provender, supervised 
and checked at intervals by some 
responsible person. Impressed at 
first by this signal beneficence of 
landsmen, Thoreau noted the in- 
structions set down for the benefit 
of mariners. Finally, he approached 
one such charity house. It ap- 
peared, he commented, &quot;but a 
stage to the grave.&quot; The chimney 
had fallen. As he and his companion 
wished to gain an idea of a &quot;hu- 
mane house,&quot; they put their eyes, 
by turns, to a knothole in the door. 
&quot;We had,&quot; Thoreau comments 
ironically, &quot;some practice at look- 
ing inward — the pupil becomes en- 
larged. Nature is never so dark that 
a patient eye may not prevail over 
it.&quot; 

So there, at last, he saw the end 
of his journey, of the business 
begun at Walden. He was peering 
into the charity house of man, upon 
a Cape Cod beach. For frozen. 



shipwrecked mariners he saw a 
fireplace with no matches, no pro- 
visions, no straw upon the floor. 
&quot;We looked,&quot; he said, &quot;into the 
bowels of mercy, and for bread we 
found a stone.&quot; Shivering like 
castaways, &quot;we looked through 
the knothole into that night without 
a star, until we concluded it was 
not a humane house at all.&quot; The 
arrow Thoreau had followed away 
from Walden had pierced as deep 
as Captain Ahab&apos;s lance. No won- 
der the demoniacal foxes leaping at 
Thoreau&apos;s window had urged him 
to begone. He had always looked 
for a crevice into the future. He 
had peered inward instead. It was 
ourselves who were rudimental 
men. 

A hundred years after Thoreau&apos;s 
death people were still trying to 
understand what he was about. 
They were still trying to get both 
eyes open. They were still trying to 
understand that he had brought 
something to share with his fel- 
lows, something that, if they par- 
took of it, might transpose them to 
another world. 

I had thought, staring across an 
angular gravestone at Concord, and 
again as I held a wind-varnished 
flint in Montana, that &quot;sharing&quot; 
could be the word. It was appro- 
priate, even though Thoreau in a 
final bitterness had felt sharing to 
be as impoverished as the charity 
house for sailors — a knothole 
glimpse into the human condition. 
How then should the artist see? By 
an eye applied to a knothole? By a 
magnification of sand-filled gloves 
washed up on a beach? Could this 
be the solitary business that led 
Thoreau on his deathbed to mutter, 
whether in irony or confusion, 
&quot;One world at a time&quot;? 

This is the terror of our age. How 
should we see? In what world are 
we? For we have fallen out of na- 
ture and see sometimes more and 
sometimes less. We see the past, 
the looming future, and then, so 
fearfully is the eye confused, that it 
stares inverted into a charity house 
that appears to reflect a less than 
human heart. Is this Thoreau&apos;s 
final surrealist vision, his glance 
through the knothole into the hu- 
mane house? It would appear at 
least to be a glimpse from one of 
those two great alternating eyes at 
Walden Pond from which in the end 
he had fled — the blind eye of win- 
ter and that innocent blue pupil be- 



side which he had once drowsed 
when time seemed endless. Both 
are equally real, as the great poets 
and prophets have always known, 
but it was Thoreau&apos;s tragic destiny 
to see, with eyes strained beyond 
endurance, man subsiding into two 
wrinkled gloves grasping at the 
edge of infinity. It is his final con- 
tribution to literature, the final hid- 
den conclusion of an unwritten 
life whose first chapter Morris had 
rightly diagnosed as Walden. 

There is an old biblical saying 
that our days are prolonged and 
every vision fails us. This I would 
dispute. The vision of the great 
artist does not fail. It sharpens and 
refines with age until everything 
extraneous is pared away. &quot;Sim- 
plify,&quot; Thoreau had advocated. 
Two gloves, devoid of flesh, clutch- 
ing the stones of the ebbing tide be- 
come, transmuted, the most dread- 
ful object in the world. 

&quot;There has been nothing but 
the sun and eye from the begin- 
ning.&quot; Thoreau had written when 
his only business was looking and 
he grew, as he expressed it, &quot;like 
corn in the night.&quot; The sun and the 
eye are the two aspects of nature 
that are irremediably linked. But 
the eye of man constitutes an awe- 
some crystal whose diflFractions are 
far greater than those of any New- 
tonian prism. 

We see, as artists, as scientists, 
each in his own way, through the 
inexorable lens we cannot alter. In 
a nature that Thoreau recognized 
as unfixed and lawless anything 
might happen. The artist&apos;s en- 
deavor is to make it happen — the 
unlawful, the oncoming world, 
whether endurable or mad, but 
shaped always by the harsh angles 
of truth — the truth as glimpsed 
through the terrible crystal of 
genius. This is the one sure rule of 
that other civilization, which we 
have come to know is greater than 
our own. Thoreau called it, from 
the first, &quot;unfinished business,&quot; 
when he turned and walked away 
from his hut at Walden Pond. 

The late Loren Eiseley — natu- 
ralist, humanist, and poet — was 
Benjamin FrankUn Professor of 
Anthropology and the History of 
Science at the University of 
Pennsylvania. All the Strange 
Hours, Eiseley&apos;s autobiography, 
was his last major prose work. He 
died in Julv 1977.

This View of Life 



by Stephen Jay Gould 



Crazy Old Randolph Kirkpatrick 



When he was wrong, 
he was very, very wrong, 
but when he was right, 
he was right on 

Oblivion, not infamy, is the usual 
fate of a crackpot. I shall be more 
than mildly surprised if any reader 
(who is not a professional taxon- 
omist with a special attachment to 
sponges) can identify Randolph 
Kirkpatrick. On the surface, Kirk- 
patrick fit the stereotype of a self- 
effacing, mild-mannered, dedicated, 
but slightly eccentric British natural 
historian. 

Kirkpatrick was the assistant 
keeper of &quot;lower&quot; invertebrates at 
the British Museum from 1886 until 
his retirement in 1927. (I have al- 
ways admired the English penchant 
for simple, literal terms such as 
lifts and flats for our elevators and 
apartments. We use the Latin cura- 
tor for guardians of museum collec- 
tions; the British call them &quot;keep- 
ers.&quot; We, however, have done 
better in retaining &quot;fall&quot; for their 
&quot;autumn.&quot;) Kirkpatrick trained as 
a medical student, but decided on a 
&quot;less strenuous career&quot; in natural 
history after several bouts with ill- 
ness. He chose well, for he traveled 
all over the world searching for 
specimens and lived to be eighty- 
seven. In the last months of his life, 
in 1950, he continued to pedal his 
bicycle through London&apos;s streets. 

Early in his career, Kirkpatrick 
published some sound taxonomic 
work on sponges, but his name 
rarely appears in scientific journals 
after the First World War. In an 
obituary note, his successor attrib- 
uted this halt in mid-career to Kirk- 
patrick&quot; s behavior as &quot;an ideal pub- 
lic servant.&quot; &quot;Unassuming to a 
fault, courteous and generous, he 
would spare no eifort to help either 
a colleague or a visiting student. It 



was in all probability his extreme 
willingness to interrupt whatever 
he was doing to help others that 
prevented his completing his work . &quot; 
Kirkpatrick&apos;s story, however, is 
not quite so simple and conven- 
tionally spotless. He did not stop 
publishing in 1915; instead, he 
shifted to private printing for a 
series of works that he knew no 
scientific journal would touch. 
Kirkpatrick spent the rest of his 
career developing what has to be 
the nuttiest of crackpot theories 
developed in this century by a pro- 
fessional natural historian (and 
keeper at the staid British Museum, 
no less). I do not challenge this 
usual assessment of his &quot;nummulos- 
phere&quot; theory, but I will stoutly 
defend Kirkpatrick. 

In 1912, Kirkpatrick was collect- 
ing sponges off the island of Porto 
Santo in the Madeira group west 
of Morocco. One day, a friend 
brought him some volcanic rocks 
collected on a peak 1 ,000 feet above 
sea level. Kirkpatrick describes his 
great discovery: &quot;I examined them 
carefully under my binocular micro- 
scope and found to my amazement 
traces of nummulitic disks in all of 
them. Next day I visited the place 
whence the fragments had come.&quot; 
Now Nummulites is one of the 
largest forams that ever lived (for- 
ams, single-celled creatures related 
to amoebas, secrete shells and are 
thereby commonly preserved as 
fossils). Nummulites looks like the 
object that provided its name: a 
coin. Its shell is a flat disk an inch 
or two in diameter. This disk is 
built of individual chambers, one 
following the next and all wound 
tightly into a single coil. In fact, 
the shell looks much like a coil of 
rope, appropriately scaled down. 
Nummulites was so abundant in 
early Tertiary times (about 50 mil- 



lion years ago) that some rocks are 
composed almost entirely of its 
shells; these are called &quot;nummu- 
litic limestones.&quot; The fossils are so 
common around Cairo that the 
Greek geographer Strabo identified 
them as petrified lentils left over 
from rations doled out to slaves 
who had built the Great Pyramids. 
Kirkpatrick returned to Madeira 
and &quot;discovered&quot; nummulites in 
the igneous rocks there as well. I 
can scarcely imagine a more radi- 
cal claim about the earth&apos;s structure. 
Igneous rocks are the products of 
volcanic eruption or the cooling 
of molten magmas within the earth; 
they cannot contain fossils. But 
Kirkpatrick argued that the igneous 
rocks of Madeira and Porto Santo 
not only included nummulites but 
were actually made of them. There- 
fore, &quot;igneous&quot; rocks must be 
sedinients deposited at the ocean 
bottom, not the products of molten 
material from the earth&apos;s interior. 
Kirkpatrick wrote: 

After the discovery of the nummulitic 
nature of nearly the whole island of 
Porto Santo, of the buildings, wine- 
presses, soil, etc.. the name Eozoon 
portosantum seemed a fitting one for 
the fossils. {Eozoon means &quot;dawn ani- 
mal,&quot; more on him in a moment.] When 
the igneous rocks of Madeira were 
likewise found to be nummulitic, 
Eozoon allanticum seemed a more fit- 
ting name. 

Now, nothing could stop Kirk- 
patrick. He returned to London 
itching to examine igneous rocks 
from other areas of the world. All 
were made of nummulites! &quot;I an- 
nexed in one morning for Eozoon 
volcanic rocks of the Arctic and in 
the afternoon of the same day those 
of the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic 
oceans. The designation Eozoon 
orbis-terrarum then suggested it- 
self.&quot; Finally, he looked at meteor-

ites and, yes, you guessed it, all 
nummulites: 

If Eozoon. after taking in the world, 
had sighed for more worlds to conquer, 
its fortunes would have surpassed those 
of Alexander, for its desires would have 
been realized. When the empire of the 
nummulites was found to extend to 
space a final alteration of name to 
Eozoon universum apparently became 
necessary. 

Kirkpatrick did not shy away 
from the evident conclusion: all 
rocks on the earth&apos;s surface (includ- 
ing the influx from space) are made 
of fossils: &quot;The original organic 
nature of these rocks is to me self- 
evident, because I can see the Fora- 
miniferal structure in them, and 



often very clearly indeed.&quot; Kirk- 
patrick claimed that he could see 
the nummulites with a low-power 
hand lens, although no one ever 
agreed with him. &quot;My views on 
igneous and certain other rocks,&quot; 
he wrote, &quot;have been received with 
a good deal of skepticism, and this 
is not surprising.&quot; 

I hope I will not be dismissed as 
an establishment dogmatist if I 
state with some assurance that Kirk- 
patrick had somehow managed 
to delude himself. By his own ad-

hard in toeing his own line: &quot;Some-

fore convincing myself that I have 
seen all the above-mentioned de- 
tails.&quot; 

But what version of the earth&apos;s 
history would yield a crust made 
entirely of nummulites? Kirkpatrick 
proposed that nummulites had 
arisen early in the history of life 
as the first creatures with shells. 
Hence, he adopted for them the 
name Eozoon. first proposed in the 
1850s by the great Canadian geo- 
logist Sir J. W. Dawson for a sup- 
posed fossil from some of the 
earth&apos;s oldest rocks. (We now know 
that Eozoon is an inorganic struc- 
ture, made of alternating white and 
green layers of the minerals calcite 
and serpentine.) 

In these early times, Kirkpatrick 
speculated, the ocean bottom must 
have accumulated a deep deposit 
of nummulitic shells over its en- 
tire surface, for the seas contained 
no predators to digest them. Heat 
from the earth&apos;s interior fused them 
together and injected them with 
silica (thus solving the vexatious 
problem of why &quot;igneous&quot; rocks, 
are silicates, while nummulites are 
made of calcium carbonate). As the 
nummulites were squeezed and 
fused, some were pushed upward 
and tossed out into space, later to 
descend as nummulitic meteorites. 

Rocks are sometimes classified as 
fossiliferous and unfossiliferous, but all 
are fossiliferous. . . . Really, then, there 
is, broadly speaking, one rock. . . . The 
lithosphere is veritably a silicated num- 
mulosphere. 

Kirkpatrick still was not satisfied. 
He thought he had discovered some- 
thing even more fundamental. Not 
content with the earth&apos;s crust and 
its meteorites, he began to see the 
coiled form of nummulites as an 
expression of life&apos;s essence, as the 
architecture of life itself. Finally, 
he broadened his claim to its limit: 
we should not say that the rocks 
are nummulites; rather, the rocks 
and the nummulites and everything 
else alive are expressions of &quot;the 
fundamental structure of living 
matter,&quot; the spiral form of all 
existence. 

Nutty, yes (unless you feel that 
he had intuited the double helix). 
Inspired, surely. A method to his 
madness, yes, again — and this is 
the crucial point. In framing the 
nummulosphere theory, Kirkpat- 
rick followed the procedure that.- 
motivated all his scientific work. ;

&quot;The reason we want to take coal and restructure it into substitute natural 
gas is that natural gas meets so many of our energy needs so perfectly.&quot; 



Turning Coal into Gas: 

Is it the best way to use Americans 

huge coal supplies? 

There are compelling economic and environmental reasons 
for coal gasification. It can help supply our growing needs for clean 

energy well into the future. 



Hugh Downs interviews Dr. Henry R. Linden, President of 
the Institute of Gas Technology in Chicago and one of the 
country&apos;s leading authorities on energy. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

My grandmother cooked with gas made from coal. Are 

you suggesting we go back to the &quot;good old days?&quot; 

DR. LINDEN: 

No. The substitute natural gas— SNG— we&apos;re talking 
about today is extremely clean and has roughly twice the 
energy content of the old &quot;town&quot; gas. In both respects 
SNG closely resembles natural gas whose purity and 
high-energy content make it the ideal form of energy for 
a broad range of applications. As the winter of 1976-77 
showed, the demand for natural gas is bigger than the 
supply. Hence the search for supplemental gas. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

How does gas from coal fit into this search? 

DR. LINDEN: 

Well, you have to understand that to meet future needs 
we&apos;ll have to develop every possible new source: gas from 
coal, from liquid hydrocarbons, from the Atlantic and the 
Arctic; gas from tight rock formations and the high-pres- 
sure brines underlying the Gulf Coast; plus sizeable im- 
ports of LNG~liquefied natural gas. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

Compared to other alternatives, does coal gasification offer 
any particular advantages? 



DR. LINDEN: 

The biggest advantage of gas made from coal is that we 
have so much coal in the United States— more proved and 
currently recoverable reserves than any other country. In 
terms of energy content they are larger than the proved oil 
reserves of the entire world. However, coal supplies only 
one-fifth of the fossil fuel energy we consume. One reason is 
a lot of the coal contains too much sulfur to burn directly 
without some form of expensive cleanup. Coal gasification 
can provide an acceptable answer and, at the same time, 
help reduce our dependency on foreign energy sources. If 
we get on with it, it could contribute to our energy supply 
before the end of the next decade. continued... 

&quot;Clean-burning, easily-transportable gas will play a signifi- 
cant role well into the 21st century&quot;

..even with an electric 

heat pump, the cost 

of heating with coal 

gas will still be less 

than with electricity.&quot; 



HUGH DOWNS: 

Do we really have to wait that long? 

DR. LINDEN: 

There are essentially three reasons why I cannot give you a 
simple answer The first reason is technological. The second 
financial. The third environmental. 

Let&apos;s talk about technology first. Processes for gasifying 
coal \n\.o medium Btu gas have been commercially available 
for many years. They have now been adapted to the pro- 
duction of high Btu gas— SNG. Those are first generation 
technologies. 

In order to get the enormous cost of construction down 
and to reduce requirements for land, water and labor, the 
gas industry and the government are developing new sec- 
ond generation technologies. Because of the urgency, sev- 
eral different processes are being developed simulta- 
neously. One of these is the HYGAS process on which we 
have been operating a pilot plant here in Chicago since 
1972. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

Isn&apos;t gasification basically a simple process? I mean for a 
society that&apos;s been to the moon? 

DR. LINDEN: 

Yes, basically. What&apos;s involved is adding hydrogen to coal, 
and the best source of hydrogen is water or steam. However, 
to do this efficiently requires high pressures and high tem- 
peratures and that means quite expensive equipment. So 
while the process is quite simple, the various complex steps 
to make it environmentally-sound and efficient on a com- 
mercial scale require very high investments. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

How much gas would a full-sized plant produce? 

DR. LINDEN: 

Commercial plants now in the design stage will produce 
250 million cubic feet of SNG a day, using about 20,000 
tons of coal and 7 million gallons of water in the process. 
However, just one plant will produce enough gas to serve as 
many as 700,000 residential customers. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

How much would a plant like that cost? 

DR. LINDEN: 

About $1.3 billion in today&apos;s dollars. If we wait, of course, 
the cost will go up because of inflation. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

And you don&apos;t think we should wait for some technological 

breakthrough that would greatly enhance efficiency? 



DR. LINDEN: 

1 don&apos;t. 1 think last winter&apos;s emergency illustrated the ur- 
gency to start building plants using existing technology. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

How many gasification plants are currently planned? 

DR. LINDEN: 

Six havebeenannounced, most of them in the Western U.S. 
These are all based on what is called the Lurgi process. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

But no one has started construction yet? 

DR. LINDEN: 

That&apos;s right. The biggest obstacle to building plants on a 
commercial scale today is financing. Because of the enor- 
mous capital requirements for each coal gasification proj- 
ect, lenders are simply unwilling to rely on gas companies 
alone to provide the credit assurances they demand. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

Are you saying that gas made from coal will cost more than 

natural gas? 

DR. LINDEN: 

Yes. When you&apos;re discussing coal gas of pipeline quality, 
you&apos;re looking at roughly four dollars per thousand cubic 
feet. Customers aren&apos;t used to that. They&apos;re buying natural 
gas cheaper today. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

How could you sell it then? 

DR. LINDEN: 

Well, there are some who feel that any supplemental source 
of energy should be priced at its true cost in order to signal 
that it&apos;s expensive. Much more expensive than what we&apos;ve 
been used to. However, most of us in the gas industry feel 
that it would be fairer to price supplemental gas on a 
rolled-in basis— in other words, average it in with other, 
lower-cost supplies. In fact, oil and electricity have been 
priced this way for years. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

Setting aside any environmental cost considerations for the 
moment, how does the cost of coal gasification compare 
with coal-fired electricity?

DR. LINDEN: 

Very favorably. The main reason is that it&apos;s so much more 
capital-efficient. On the production end, a coal gasification 
plant requires only about one-half the investment of a 
coal-fired power station. The advantage is even greater for 
transmission and distribution. 

A recent study projects the consumer&apos;s cost of energy 
from coal gas versus coal-fired electricity for residential 
uses: clothes-drying, water-heating and space-heating. It 
shows the cost of energy from coal gas substantially lower 
than that of electricity. When it comes to cooking, gas also 
has an advantage. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

What about technological advances like the electrical heat 

pump? 

DR. LINDEN: 

Even with an electric heat pump, the cost of heating with 
coal gas will still be less than the cost of heating with 
electricity made from coal. With the new gas equipment 
underdevelopment this advantage would increase. But this 
is not a gas vs. electricity issue. Our country will need all the 
electricity, all the gas and all other clean and reliable energy 
sources it can get.

I Final Environmental Impact Statement on the Proposed Kaiparowits Project, U.S. 
I Department of the Interior, March 1 976. 

The environmental impact of substituting coal for oil and 
natural gas by means of producing high-Btu gas from coal 
at the mine mouth and delivering it through the existing 
gas pipeline system will be less than that of any other 
method of substitution. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

Let&apos;s move on to the third problem you mentioned— the 

impact on the environment. 

DR. LINDEN: 

That&apos;s actually another thing in favor of coal gasification. 
Much of our coal has a high sulfur content, which is envi- 
ronmentally unacceptable today when you burn it directly 
But you release little sulfur into the air whenyougasify coal. 
HUGH DOWNS: 

How about the desulfurization of coal for generating elec- 
tricity? I know it&apos;s expensive now, but isn&apos;t that technology 
likely to be improved too? 

DR. LINDEN: 

Very likely But you&apos;ll be interested to know that one possi- 
bility to lick the problem is to turn high-sulfur coal into a 
medium Btu gas and use it to produce electrical power It 
may turn out to be the cheapest way to make such coal 
acceptable. 

HUGH DOWN.S: 

Will gas have a future role to play when renewable energy 



sources, such as solar or fusion come into the picture? 
DR. LINDEN: 

Definitely. Gas energy will be around for a long time. And 
even gas can be renewable. Take hydrogen. Eventually it 
may replace today&apos;s gas in our pipelines. It&apos;s an ideal fuel 
and totally non-polluting. 
HUGH DOWNS: 

Let me see if I can recap. I&apos;ll start with the advantages of 
coal gasification. 

There&apos;s an enormous amount of coal in the ground. It&apos;s 
our coal. We&apos;re not dependent on other countries. And gas- 
ification is environmentally acceptable. 
DR. LINDEN: 

1 would add another advantage. Using coal instead of im- 
ported oil helps our critical balance-of-payments problem. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

Now the disadvantages. It&apos;s expensive to gasify coal. 

DR. LINDEN: 

No question about it. But I believe it&apos;ll be far cheaper than 
any other uses of coal for most consumer needs— certainly 
for the residential and commercial markets. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

Then there&apos;s the problem of raising capital. And last, even 
though gasification minimizes emissions into the atmo- 
sphere, there is still an environmental concern. Each plant 
uses prodigious amounts of land and water. 

One last question. We haven&apos;t talked about conservation, 
which everybody agrees can play a really significant role in 
helping to close the gap between demand and supply. 

DR. LINDEN: 

Absolutely. Along with the development of new gas sup- 
plies, there&apos;s an urgent need to conserve— not to waste gas, 
or any other energy source for that matter. But while con- 
servation is important, it alone won&apos;t close the gap. The 
reason we need more gas is that natural gas meets so many 
of our energy needs so perfectly. Because of that, it heats 55 
percent of our homes and supplies 40 percent of the energy 
used by industry. 

The truth is, America can&apos;t do without it, and we don&apos;t 
have to. Clean-burning easily-transportable gas will play a 
significant role well into the 21st century. 

HUGH DOWNS: 

So grandmother was ahead of her time? 
DR. LINDEN: Let&apos;s Say she had the right idea. 




Built at a cost of $50 billion, the U.S. gas transmission and 
distribution network of one million miles is one of the most 
efhcient methods to transmit energy.

He had a passion for synthesis and 
an imagination that compelled him 
to gather truly disparate things 
together. He consistently sought 
similarities of geometric form 
among objects conventionally 
classified in different categories, 
while ignoring the ancient truth 
that similarity of form need not 
designate common cause. He also 
constructed similarities out of his 
hopes, rather than his observations. 

Still, an uncautious search for 
synthesis may uncover real con- 
nections that would never occur to 
a sober scientist (although he may 
be jostled to reflect upon them once 
someone else makes the initial sug- 
gestion). Scientists like Kirkpatrick 
pay a heavy price, for they are 
usually wrong. But when they are 
right, they may be so outstandingly 
right that their insights beggar the 
honest work of many scientific life- 
times in conventional channels. 

Let us return then to Kirkpatrick 
and ask why he was on Madeira 
and Porto Santo in the first place 
when he made his fateful discovery 
in 1912. &quot;In September 1912,&quot; he 
writes, &quot;I journeyed to Porto Santo 
via Madeira, in order to complete 
my investigation of that strange 
organism, the sponge-alga Media 
normanl.&quot; In 1900, a taxonomist 
named J. J. Lister had discovered 
a peculiar sponge on the Pacific 
islands of Lifu and Funafuti. It 
contained spicules of silica, but 
had an additional calcareous skele- 
ton bearing a striking resemblance 
to some corals (spicules are the 
small, needlelike elements forming 
the skeleton of most sponges). A 
sober man. Lister could not accept 
the &quot;hybrid&quot; and conjectured that 
the spicules had entered the sponge 
from elsewhere. But Kirkpatrick 
collected more specimens and cor- 
rectly concluded that the sponge 
secretes the spicules. Then, in 1910, 
Kirkpatrick found Merlia normani 
on Madeira, a second sponge with 
siliceous spicules and a supple- 
mentary calcareous skeleton. 

Errata: Please note the following cor- 
rections in the picture captions accom- 
panying William Cade&apos;s &quot;Of Cricket 
Song and Sex.&quot; January 1978. A spe- 
cies of round-headed katydid, not a 
tree cricket, is shown on pages 64-65. 
The long-legged crickets on pages 68- 
69 live on the ground, not in trees. The 
pink bases on the antennae of the insect 
on pages 72-73 identify it as a broad- 
winged tree cricket (Oecanthus lati- 
pennis). not a snowy tree cricket. 



26 



Inevitably, Kirkpatrick un- 
leashed his passion for synthesis 
upon Merlia. He noticed that its 
calcareous skeleton resembled sev- 
eral problematic groups of fossils 
usually classified among the 
corals — the stromatoporoids and 
the chaetetid tabulates in partic- 
ular. (This may seem like a small 
issue to many, but I assure you that 
it is a major concern of all pro- 
fessional paleontologists. Stroma- 
toporoids and chaetetids are very 
common as fossils; they form reefs 
in some ancient deposits. Their 
status lies among the classical 
mysteries of my field, and many 
distinguished paleontologists have 
spent entire careers devoted to their 
study.) Kirkpatrick decided that 
these and other, enigmatic fossils 
must be sponges. He set out to 
find spicules in them, since spicules 
are a sure sign of affinity with 
sponges. Characteristically, he 
soon claimed that he had found 
spicules in all suspected groups. 
We may be quite sure that he had 
deluded himself again in some 
cases, for he included among his 
&quot;sponges&quot; the undoubted bryo- 
zoan Monticulipora. In any case, 
Kirkpatrick soon became preoc- 
cupied with his nummulosphere 
theory. He never published the 
major treatise that he had planned 
on Merlia. The nummulosphere 
made him a scientific pariah, and 
his work on coralline sponges was 
pretty much forgotten. 

Kirkpatrick worked the same 
way in studying both nummulo- 
spheres and coralline sponges: he 
invoked a similarity of abstract, 
geometric form to infer a common 
source for objects that no one had 
thought to unite, and he followed 
his theory with such passion that he 
eventually &quot;saw&quot; the expected 
form, even where it manifestly did 
not exist. Yet, I must note one 
major difference between the two 
studies: Kirkpatrick was right 
about the sponges. 

During the 1960s, Thomas 
Goreau, late of the Discovery 
Bay Marine Laboratory in Jamaica, 
began to explore the cryptic en- 
vironments of West Indian reefs. 
These cracks, crevices, and caves 
contain a major fauna, previously 
undetected. In one of the most ex- 
citing zoological discoveries of the 
last twenty years, Goreau and his 
colleagues Jeremy Jackson and 
Willard Hartman showed that these 



habitats contain numerous &quot;living 
fossils.&quot; This cryptic community 
seems to represent an entire eco- 
system literally overshadowed by 
the evolution of more modern 
forms. This community may be 
cryptic, but its members are neither 
moribund nor uncommon. The lin- 
ings of caves and crevices form a 
major part of modern reefs. Before 
the advent of scuba diving, scien- 
tists had been unable to study these 
areas. 

Two elements dominate this 
cryptic fauna: brachiopods and 
Kirkpatrick&apos;s coralline sponges. 
Goreau and Hartman described six 
species of coralline sponges from 
the fore-reef slope of Jamaica&apos;s reef. 
These species are the basis for an 
entire new class of sponges, the 
Sclerospongiae. In the course of 
their work, they rediscovered Kirk- 
patrick&apos;s papers and studied his 
view on the relationship between 
coralline sponges and the enigmatic 
fossil stromatoporoids and chaete- 
tids. &quot;Kirkpatrick&apos;s comments,&quot; 
they write, &quot;have led us to compare 
the coralline sponges described 
above with representatives of sev- 
eral groups of organisms known 
from the fossil record.&quot; They have 
shown, quite convincingly I think, 
that these fossils are indeed 
sponges. A major zoological dis- 
covery has solved an outstanding 
problem in paleontology. And crazy 
old Randolph Kirkpatrick had 
known it all along. 

When I wrote to Hartman to in- 
quire about Kirkpatrick, he cau- 
tioned me not to judge the man too 
harshly for his nummulosphere, 
for his taxonomic work on sponges 
had been sound. But I respect Kirk- 
patrick both for his sponges and 
his numinous nummulosphere. It is 
easy to dismiss a crazy theory with 
laughter based on no attempt to 
understand a man&apos;s motivation — 
and the nummulosphere is a crazy 
theory. I find that few men of 
imagination are not worth atten- 
tion. Their ideas may be wrong, 
even foolish, but their methods 
often repay a close study. Few 
honest passions are not based upon 
some valid perception of unity or 
some anomaly worthy of note. The 
diiferent drummer often beats a 
fruitful tempo.

A report on a matter of public interest: 



How the Bell System is pumping 
more service out of less oil. 



In 1973, when the OPEC 
oil embargo went into effect, the Bell 
System committed itself to reducing its 
energy consumption. That commitment 
has been fulfilled. In four years, the 
Bell System has saved the energy 
equivalent of almost 24 million barrels 
of oil and over 415 million dollars in 
energy costs — savings that help hold 
down the cost of your telephone bills. 

Today, the Bell System is actually 
using 11 per cent less energy than it did 
in 1973, even though the number of 




telephones in service has risen over 16 
per cent and the volume of business has 
increased 33 per cent. 

Here&apos;s how we are combining 
common sense with uncommon technol- 
ogy in four basic areas to achieve Zero 
Energy Growth. 

Telephones are reconditioned 
tliree times. 

The Bell System&apos;s energy needs 
begin with the power and fuel necessary 
to design and manufacture the basic 



communications components— cables, 
wire and equipment such as your home 
telephone. 

In general, it takes much more 
energy to manufacture such items from 
scratch than it does to recycle them. 
Because Bell System equipment is 
designed by Bell Labs to be reliable, 
repairable and recyclable, extensive 
energy cutbacks have been realized 
through 40 years of recycling and reuse. 
New, more energy-efficient processes 
are constantly being devised by Western 
Electric, some of which entail 
modifying original designs for 
even greater materials and 
power savings. 

Since 1974, the Bell con- 
servation program has saved 
the energy equivalent of over 
three million barrels of oil by 
recycling metals. Also, more 
than six million equivalent 
barrels of oil have been saved 
through the reuse of equip- 
ment. The average telephone, 
for example, is reconditioned 
three times before it is unre- 
pairable or obsolete. 

New technology does 
more with less. 

Another area in which the Bell 
System is effecting energy savings is in 
power for switching and transmission 
equipment. Constantly, new energy- 
saving technology is being added to 
the system. Item: Over two billion 
power-saving transistors, diodes and 
integrated circuits have been put into 
use. Item: Light Emitting Diodes 
(LEDs) are replacing incandescent 
bulbs in switchboards and telephones, 
saving over 90 per cent of the pre- 
viously required power. Item: A new 



&apos;^^ |,ioi 



microprocessor called MAC-8 is less 
than one-tenth the size of a postage 
stamp yet contains the equivalent of 
over 7,000 transistors. The MAC-8 can 
execute several hundred electronic 
&quot;thinking&quot; functions, yet it will operate 
on only one-tenth of a watt of power. 

Smaller vehicles power 
giant fleet. 

Twenty-two per cent of Bell&apos;s 
energy requirements are in fuel for its 
fleet of over 170,000 vehicles, the larg- 
est privately ovmed and operated motor 
fleet in the world. Here, a number of 
commonsense procedures have been 
adopted: engines are carefully tuned for 
peak efficiency, smaller and more fuel- 
efficient vehicles are being used, 
and shuttle services have been set 
up between some company loca- 
tions. In addition. New York 
Telephone Company is experi- 
menting with nonpolluting, 
energy-saving electric-powered 
trucks. Due to these and other 
efforts, the Bell System in 1976 
used over five per cent less motor 
fuel than in 1973. 

Even emploYees&apos; body 
heat is used. 

Heating, lighting and air 
conditioning of Bell System&apos;s 
25,000 buildings account for 45 
per cent of its energy needs. 
Broad economies have been achieved 
simply by removing thousands of 
unnecessary lights; by lowering tempera 
ture settings; by cutting back on hot 
water temperatures; and by heating or 
cooling unoccupied areas only to the 
extent required for equipment 
operations. 

Moving beyond the obvious con- 
servation measures, the Bell System 
created a building energy management 
program to redesign and retrofit exist- 
ing buildings to improve their energy 
efficiency. Two examples of other power- 
saving programs at Bell facilities: 

• On windy Block Island, Rhode 
Island, the New England Telephone 
Company began operating a wind 



dynamo in September, 1976. It can pro- 
duce up to 15 kilowatts of electricity to 
power a central office and microwave 
radio terminal. Excess power from the 
windmill is fed back to the power 
company. 

• In AT&amp;T&apos;s new Basking Ridge, 
New Jersey, facility, an innovative com- 
puterized system heats about IH mil- 
lion feet of office space by recovering 
excess heat from the building environ- 
ment—lights, equipment and the body 
heat of employees. It is estimated that the 
system uses 25 per cent less energy than 
conventional heating/cooling systems. 

Bell trials of solar heating and cool- 

Windmill helps power central phone office and microwave 
radio terminal (tower at right) on Block Island. 




ing are providing valuable data which 
should lead to more widespread use of 
alternate energy systems. 

Today, throughout the Bell System, 
our commitment to energy conservation 
is more than a goal; it is an ongoing 
reality. And in looking to the future, we 
anticipate that in 1982 we will still be 
using no more energy than was used in 
1973. Keeping your phone system 
the best in the world.

A Nudge from the Hand of God 

by Stephen Pastner 



An anthropologist learns 
that Allah sees all on the 
coast of Pakistan 

The pye-dog had been in agony 
for three days. While attaclcing a 
goat, it had been bhnded by a stone 
that one of the fishermen had casu- 
ally tossed. Its initial howls of pain 
had subsided, but as it roamed 
restlessly up and down the beach 
at night, its fretful moans carried 
through the flimsy plank walls of 
the reed-roofed, one-room shack 
where I lived with my wife and 
small daughter. On the third day, 
the dog sought the shade beneath 
one of the lateen-sailed boats on 
the beach. Since stronger members 
of the village pye-dog pack had 
driven the helpless animal from the 
piles offish offal on which they fed, 
it was too weak to do more than 
whine and snap when the local 
children darted by or pitched sand 
at it. My wife and I were studying 
this Baluchi fishing village on 
Pakistan&apos;s Sind coast, which ex- 
tends from the Indian border to 
northwest of Karachi, and since my 
primary concern was making ob- 
servations, not value judgments, I 
had been trying, with some eflFort, to 
regard the dog&apos; s plight and the villag- 
ers&apos; reaction simply as data. After 
all, the incident was a paradigm of 
behavior I frequently saw on my 
numerous trips to sea with the 
fishermen, as well as in other areas 
of village life. 

During the men&apos;s sea hunts for 
fish, their livelihood, they often 
used such phrases as khoda-i-dast 
(&quot;the hand of God&quot;), kismet 
(&quot;fate&quot;), Allah malik (&quot;God is the 
master&quot;), and Allah dciiit. na daiit 
(&quot;God gives or withholds&quot;). When 
a valued gill net, which had cost 
much money and labor, snagged on 
a Karachi shrimp trawler&apos;s pro- 
peller, the disappearance was 
&quot;God&apos;s will.&quot; When a fishing 



ground that had for several days 
provided rich catches of Spanish 
mackerel suddenly yielded nothing 
but a rotting croaker, the reason 
was &quot;fate.&quot; When for days on end, 
rioting in Karachi, precipitated by 
the ill-fated 1977 elections, closed 
roads to the city&apos;s fish markets and 
bazaars, the loss to the village 
economy was the &quot;hand of God.&quot; 

Many observers of the East have 
construed such apparent equanim- 
ity in the face of trouble as &quot;Orien- 
tal fatalism,&quot; the view that this life 
and its capriciousness is but an 
illusory purgatory through which 
man must pass before reaching 
higher planes — the Buddhist &quot;nir- 
vana,&quot; the Hindu &quot;moksha,&quot; or the 
&quot;paradise&quot; of Muslims such as the 
Baluch. Although I had learned to 
look for the logic and function be- 
neath all social behavior, no matter 
how different from my own, I was 
often struck by the blase air with 
which the village fishermen faced 
assorted trials. 

Their unconcern over previous 
misfortunes sometimes seemed to 
carry over into a lack of foresight. 
The men did all their offshore fish- 
ing from sailboats twelve to forty- 
five feet long. Many were quite 
old, with hulls carved from single 
trunks of mango trees; some had 
been imported from south India 
as early as the turn of the century, 
in what the villagers called &quot;Vic- 
toria&apos;s time.&quot; All were leaky, even 
the newer, planked boats. Fishing 
went on daily in waters where vari- 
ous shark species, ranging from 
toothless dogfish to sixteen-foot 
tiger sharks and large makos, were 
among the largest single items of 
catch. Since only preadolescent 
children generally swim for recrea- 
tion, many of the men had for- 
gotten how to swim. Yet the villag- 
ers never used safety equipment 
although it was available in Kara- 
chi, only twenty miles away. 
This insouciance was of some per- 



sonal concern to me, since I fre- 
quently sailed as crew on various 
boats. If my host scorned life 
jackets, I felt morally obliged not to 
protect myself with such trifles. But 
after I almost capsized on my first 
trip out, the thought of another 
seven months of near-misses was 
not altogether pleasing. 

The fishermen also seemed to 
have an insouciant attitude toward 
the dying dog, as they sat mending 
their nets a few feet away. When I 
asked if no one would put it out of 
its misery, I was told: &quot;God will 
take it in His own time just as He 
has cared for it so far.&quot; (The latter 
was certainly true: the pye-dog 
pack passed their entire lives with- 
out any care from the villagers.) 
Another man elaborated, &quot;We 
would be damned if we interfered 
with God&apos;s plan.&quot; 

But I knew perfectly well that 
despite their verbal professions of 
fatalism, the Baluch hardly went 
through life as passive bystand- 
ers. The origin of their very way of 
life was testimony to an elemental 
refusal to knuckle under to fate. 
The ancestors of most of the vil- 
lagers we studied had come from 
Baluchistan&apos;s interior, where they 
had been nomads and farmers. 
Some had been driven to the coast 
by droughts and the death of their 
flocks. Religious persecution forced 
others to flee desert life, for the 
fishermen in our village were Zikri. 
a sect brought to Baluchistan some- 
time in the late fifteenth or early 
sixteenth century by a wandering 
Muslim holy man from India. 
He preached belief in a Mahdi, an 
Islamic Messiah named Nur Pak, 
or &quot;Pure Light,&quot; who supposedly 
was created before Adam. He will 
return with the Apocalypse, and his 
teachings are said to supersede 
those of Muhammed himself. To 
the Sunni Muslims of Baluchistan,; 
such belief is heresy, and in the 
mid-eighteenth century, the khan 



32 



of Kalat, whose dominions included 
all of what is now Pakistani Balu- 
chistan, declared a jihad, or holy 
war, against the Zikris, whom he 
considered infidels. To escape 
the khan, many Zikri Baluch fled 
south to the inhospitable coast of 
Baluchistan or southeast to Sind. 

Whatever the cause of the Zik- 
ris&apos; migrations from the interior, 
their transition from desert dwellers 
to fishermen was not easy. They had 
to learn new skills, master new 
environments. They would hardly 
have made these efforts if they had 
been mired in fatalism. Denying the 
teaching of their Mahdi and profes- 
sing conversion to Sunni Islam 
would have afforded many Zikris 
easy escape. But the ancestors of 
the fishermen we knew had with- 
stood this temptation, and those 
whose forebears had succumbed 
were disdained as apostates. 

In everyday life, too, the fisher- 
men&apos;s actions regularly belied their 
constant verbal bowing to God&apos;s 
will and destiny. Aside from the 
obvious hazards of deep-sea fishing 
from their crude craft, many fish- 
ermen were also involved in smug- 
gling and used their sailboats to

Then there was the regular practice 
of young village men uprooting 
themselves from their friends and 
families for months, and sometimes 
years, to try to make their fortunes 
in the Arab oil sheikdoms. 

Seen against this background

We distill our whiskey from a mash of 
America&apos;s choicest grain. Then, after distill-

farmers. And they use it in liquid form 
to fatten up their co&apos;ws. 
Thanks to our choice grain

babies on the same day — children 
they had wanted and had tried des- 
perately to save by calling on all 
possible sources of medical and 
spiritual help — I could understand 
why they stood dry-eyed at the tiny 
graves and tried to ease my distress 
by saying, &quot;After all we hardly 
knew them.&quot; 

When I took a long view of the 
villagers&apos; experiences, I sometimes 
noticed a kind of balance that 
validated the Baluchi idea of God&apos;s 
control over the universe. I recall 
one long day when our nets came 
up empty and the wind was so weak 
that we had to row most of the fif- 
teen miles back to shore. Allah less- 
ened our hardship by opening up 
what our captain referred to as the 
&quot;sea bazaar.&quot; Our route took us 
through the sea lanes used by heavy 
international shipping en route to 
Karachi, and shortly, the wasteful- 
ness of sailors from the industrial- 
ized world became a boon for the 
Baluch. We fished from the water 
two edible oranges; a slightly moldy 
loaf of bread; a beer can, which 
with a few wrenches of a scaling 
knife became a durable drinking 
cup; and a good oak plank that was 
later made into a spare rudder. The 
captain then jokingly ordered us to 
keep watch for a floating prostitute 
to round out our haul. 

Yet despite ample demonstra- 
tions of ways in which the Baluch 
braved their often diificult life, the 
matter of the dog rankled. I still 
found myself irritated by the local 
logic, which held that while the 
dog&apos;s blinding by the fisherman and 
teasing at the children&apos;s hands was 
no crime, putting it out of its misery 
was a damnable offense. So when 
several of the men came to me 
and — out of earshot of the 
others — urged me, an unbeliever 
anyway, to kill the animal, 1 quickly 
crushed its head beneath one of the 
massive log rollers used to beach 
boats. My act sparked a debate that 
continued for days in informal 
councils along the beach. Was I 
damned or had I provided a merciful 
cure for the dog&apos;s agony? The bal- 
ance of opinion was against my act. 
and even my supporters thought I 
would be wise to make a Herat, or 
offering to God. arguing that if Allah 
was angry, I&apos;d be propitiating Him; 
and that if He was unperturbed, I 
had nothing to lose. Before 1 got 
around to doing anything about the 
herai, I was given a personal dem- 



onstration of the long arm of Allah 
in human affairs, and learned new 
appreciation of Baluchi awareness 
of the divine presence. 

Besides studying the fishermen&apos;s 
social organization and cultural 
ecology, I was interested in the 
beliefs and rituals of the Zikri sect. 
I frequently sat in on their prayer 
sessions (zikr) which differ mar- 
kedly from those of Pakistan&apos;s or- 
thodox Sunni Muslim majority. 
During a zikr, fishermen praise God 
and their Mahdi in chants with beau- 
tiful, intricate contrapuntal har- 
monies that I found deeply moving. 
After nearly seven months of inti- 
mate association with the village, I 
finally obtained permission from the 
resident mullahs (religious leaders), 
as well as from a visiting Zikhpir, or 
saint, to tape-record a Thursday 
night zikr. (Like many other Mus- 
lims, Baluch revere saints, who may 
be dead or still living.) 

My tape recorder, which I peri- 
odically borrowed from an anthro- 
pologist friend in Karachi, was a 
welcome addition to village life 
on other occasions. Men were al- 
ways eager to perform hambas, or 
net-hauling chanteys, and other 
secular material for my mi- 
crophone. But when I wanted to 
introduce the machine into the vil- 
lage zikr khana, the cinderblock and 
stucco house of prayer, some men 
were dubious. The zikr khana was 
supposed to be a place of purity, 
uncontaminated by worldly goods. 
For visits to the zikr khana, fisher- 
men, who spent much of their work 
day amidst offal and the stench of 
drying fish, bathed and dressed in 
clothes of purest white, covering 
their heads with diaphanous prayer 
shawls. I always left even my eye- 
glasses outside this holy place, into 
which I now wanted to take a pro- 
fane piece of machinery. 

On the night of the recording, 
1 tested and retested the machine, 
which had always worked per- 
fectly. (It was a simple casette 
model and not much could go 
wrong.) A number of men told me 
that God might not be too pleased 
with my project, but I advised them 
to relax, as the mullahs themselves 
had given approval. 

The service began smoothly with 
the men in extraordinary voice. 
Any anxieties over the presence 
of a profane object had been over- 
come by devotion, and also, I 
suspect, by the prospect of per- 



forming for posterity. The early 
parts of the service rolled routinely 
onto the tape: the la, or repeated 
chanting of God&apos;s name, and the 
shahdat and dwa, prayers in praise 
of the Mahdi. But when those com- 
plex and lovely harmonies that I 
so wanted to preserve began, my 
machine&apos;s quiet whir suddenly 
stopped. Several bearded and 
shrouded heads turned impercep- 
tibly toward me, and I could detect 
more than one owlish expression 
with an &quot;I told you so&quot; twinkle 
barely masked by ceremonial so- 
lemnity. 

Chastened and unwilling to tempt 
fate, I made my overdue offering 
the next day, in the form of a finan- 
cial donation to the zikr khana. 

The Baluch occupy a small and 
remote part of a vast arid zone 
that has long been the breeding 
ground of prophets, the playground 
of jinn and other spirits, yet also 
witness to some of mankind&apos;s most 
rational and pragmatic achieve- 
ments. The Baluch are latter-day 
heirs to this juxtaposition of em- 
piricism and supernaturalism. His- 
torically and theologically, the 
Zikri sect is a late offshoot of 
the medieval Sufis — the beggar 
mystics who, ecstatically reciting 
the name of God, relegated them- 
selves to His care. But the sect&apos;s 
contemporary practitioners are 
husbands and fathers, sisters and 
mothers bound up in obligations to 
others and in a value system that 
esteems hard work, the person of 
&quot;heart&quot; or courage, and izzat, a no- 
tion of honor that is frequently 
aggressive. Total reliance on God 
is for spiritual virtuosos — like the 
pir and the fakir (a wandering 
mendicant) — who have extinguished 
worldly desire through single- 
minded devotion. Most Baluch 
cannot do this and know it; in- 
stead, they manifest their honor 
in a less exalted but equally diffi- 
cult struggle for a livelihood in 
the desert or on the sea and in ful- 
fillment of their duties as kinsmen 
and neighbors. Their theology takes 
the sting of personal blame from 
failure by acknowledging that all 
is ultimately in the hand of Allah. 
Blinded dogs notwithstanding, such 
belief is merciful even when the 
stern God of Islam is not.

took looters 400 years to gain entrance. And in an entire 
section devoted to Tutankhamen&apos;s Trea.sure. you&apos;ll follow 
the search lor this forgotten tomb, the exciting details of 
its discovery— and see the pictures that were taken at 
various stages of its unearthing. Beautiful color photo- 
graphs of the treasures themselves capture the exquisite 
workmanship of the tomb&apos;s gilded animal gods and god- 
desses, royal daggers, vases, furnishings, coffins, and of

What Are Comets Made Of? 



If we could be certain of 
the answer, we would know 
more about where these 
objects come from and 
how they are formed 

Comets are deceptive objects, 
disguising their true nature behind 
the filmy veil of light we see from 
the earth. A comet appears to the 
eye as a diffuse, somewhat V- 
shaped curtain of luminosity (the 
tail) attached to a brighter, rounded 
vertex (the head). The length of the 
tail and the brightness of the whole 
comet vary over a period of 
months, first increasing as the 
comet approaches the sun, then de- 
creasing as its orbit takes it back 
into the outer solar system. The 
point of closest approach, or peri- 
helion, is often much nearer to the 
sun than is the earth. The farthest 
point of the orbit may be as near 
the sun as the neighborhood of 
Jupiter or as far away as the edge 
of the solar system. When comets 
with the latter variety of orbit are 
observed, they are called &quot;new 
comets.&quot;&quot; They have probably 
never previously entered the inner 
solar system, having remained at 
the edge of the system since before 
the birth of the sun. 

What causes the glow of visible 
light from a comet? Is a comet 
composed of gases, liquids, or 
solids? What chemical compounds 
is it made of? These are some of the 
questions that occur immediately to 
anyone who has ever seen a comet. 
The first two questions have been 
answered satisfactorily by mod- 
ern astronomers. The final ques- 
tion is currently a matter of in- 
tense debate and energetic in- 
vestigation by a number of astron- 
omers, physicists, and chemists. 



In this article, I shall attempt to 
summarize the present state of 
knowledge on the chemical com- 
position of comets. But first, let 
us examine the information that has 
come to light in answer to ques- 
tions one and two. 

Astronomers obtained a de- 
tailed picture of comets by en- 
larging their images with telescopes 
and then breaking down the light 
into its component wavelengths 
with a spectrograph. What emerged 
was an incredibly complex pattern 
of spectral lines and continuum 
radiation. Let me explain the mean- 
ing of these terms. An atom or 
molecule in a gas may absorb radia- 
tion, such as sunlight, and thereby 
change the amount of its energy. 
It may subsequently reemit some 
or all of this energy. The wave- 
lengths of radiation that can be 
absorbed or emitted in this man- 
ner are characteristic of particular 
atoms or molecules. A particular 
atom or molecule has many such 
wavelengths of radiation, generally 
known as spectral lines. When 
atoms or molecules aggregate in a 
dense body, their spectral lines tend 
to lose their individual character 
and merge into a broad emission 
spectrum called a &quot;continuum.&quot;&quot; 
Visible sunlight, with its maximum 
intensity at wavelengths that ap- 
pear to us as yellow, is an example 
of such a continuum. 

The visible spectra of comets 
are characterized by both line and 
continuum emission. The con- 
tinuum emission is identical to that 
coming to us fporn the sun. Since 
comets are too low in weight to 
create their own light, it is as- 
sumed that something in the comet 
acts as a mirror and reflects solar 
radiation. Gases, composed of in- 
dividual atoms and molecules, do 



not have this reflection property, 
but aggregates, such as solids, do. 
Observations of radiation from 
comet Kohoutek with wavelengths 
longer than visible light (infrared 
radiation), have shown that the re- 
flecting bodies are small dust 
grains, no larger than one ten- 
thousandth of a centimeter in 
diameter. 

The spectra are so rich in emis- 
sion lines in the visible region 
that many spectral pictures of com- 
ets have never been thoroughly 
analyzed. The presence of emission 
lines indicates that comets contain 
gas as well as dust. Seventeen 
gaseous atoms and molecules that 
have emission lines in the visible 
spectrum have been positively 
identified in comets. Most of the 
molecules are highly reactive and 
do not survive long on earth, al- 
though they can be artificially pro- 
duced in a laboratory. Some of 
these are the carbon molecules C2 
and C;|. the nitrogen-hydrogeri 
molecules NH and NHo. the 
carbon-hydrogen molecule CH, 
and the water ion H-.O^. 

Recent technological advances 
have permitted the investigation 
of cometary radiation at wave- 
lengths both longer and shorter 
than those of visible light. Most 
wavelengths of ultraviolet radia- 
tion, which has a shorter wave- 
length than blue light, cannot be 
observed from the earth&quot; s surface 
due to absorption by atmospheric 
gases. Scientists surmounted this 
problem by using telescopes and 
spectrographs mounted on satel- 
lites or rockets that ascended above 
most of the atmosphere. The results 
were dram9tic. Emission of radia- 
tion from atomic hydrogen was dis- 
covered for the first time, and it

what it took to catch that pileated 
woodpecker tending her brood. 

The bittern, freezing on her nest 
to blend in, was easier. Dick Robinson, 
our bird man, merely waited the days 
out until the eggs were about to hatch 
and her maternal juices suppressed her 
flight reaction. 

Robinson, whose job with us is to 
tell Canadians how to get more out of 
their photography, has written a de- 
tailed and magnificently illustrated 
essay which leaves the impression 
that the way for a birder to under- 
stand wild birds and graduate from 
the numbers game of &quot;life lists&quot; is to 
photograph them. To follow his inge- 
nious suggestions is most time-

and those to whom time is given to be 
happily consumed. They appear in

you turn your mind to one of those

lAMOPPOSEDTO 
HAVING THE INTERIOR OF 

THE AUDI 5000 LOOK 
LIKE AN AIRPLANE COCKPIT 

AN INTERVIEW WITH HARTMUT WARKUSZ, HEAD OF STYLING 




Don&apos;t you like Warkusz: It&apos;s not what I like or don&apos;t 
dials and stark like— evervthing we do is tested and 

interiors? ^ 

proved. Our psychological testing 
showed that dark colors and cockpit type interiors 
make drivers more aggressive, less relaxed. One of our 
principal objectives was to make the driver calmer It is 
no good for you to go from a nice, calm, cheerful house 
right into an aggressive car 



Will this type of Warkusz: We believe so, because we 
^XZ^ studied the American market very 
carefully. Not to copy, but to take 
American tastes into consideration. The Audi 5000 is 
altogether European, but there is no reason why a 
European car can&apos;t be bright and roomy and comfort- 
able and quiet. A high performance European car does 
not have to look or sound like the cockpit of a plane. 



Should a car&apos;s 
interior be 
like a house? 



Warkusz: In some ways, yes. The old 
kind of intaiors with stark black leath- 
er and polished chrome everywhere 
is no longer appropriate for today&apos;s cars. We wanted 
to create a more modern living environment inside the 
car A car should be a pleasant, bright and comfortable 
place to be in. You should feel at home. Your living room 
at home isn&apos;t black all over, is it? 

No. But my living Warkusz: And we didn&apos;t just put wheels 
room doesn&apos;t q^ g living room and so we didn&apos;t de- 
sign the car only for the comfort of the 
driver The Audi 5000 holds all 5 people comfortably. 
The trunk is huge enough to hold all their luggage. 

The ventilating system is unique in that there are 
outlets to provide plenty of fresh air but not on any- 
body&apos;s neck. You can even have warm air on your feet 
and cool air on your face to keep you alert. For the sake 
of comfort and safety the rear passengers have head- 
rests, too. We have even gone so far as to be sure that 
the upholstery doesn&apos;t tear the fur out of a mink coat. 
Some fabrics we tested did just that. 



The lines do 
look European 



Warkusz: Lines are not European or 
American. Lines can be ugly or beauti- 
ful, but most importantly, lines are functional or not 
functional. The aerodynamic values of the Audi 5000 
make the air resistance very low. The drag coefficient is 
better than most other cars in our size category. Also, 
the aerodynamics made us lift up the tail of the can 
That&apos;s one reason why the trunk came out so big. 

For the same reason, we have complete instrumen- 
tation without two dozen unnecessary switches to dis- 
tract the driver with playthings. I am glad you like the 
lines, but they are more than lines to me. 

What would you Warkusz: I would want him to under- 
want an American stand the mature, functional design of 
stand^about it?^ &apos;^^&apos;^ &apos;^&apos;&quot;- &quot;^^^ pleasant, comfortable 
and quiet atmosphere of the interior. 
The high quality of the finish. And, the fact that it&apos;s the 
largest German car you can buy for the money — about 
*8,500: And I would want the American buyer to un- 
derstand that nothing about it is by chance.

From one form of energy comes strength 
to develop another And another 



Developing any source of energy 
—an oil field, a coal mine, a ura- 
nium deposit— takes a lot of time 
and money. 

Fortunately. Conoco has 
revenues from all these sources. 
And we pool them. So we have the 
flexibility to apply financing where 
it&apos;s needed. And the stability to 
continue this financing over long 
years of development. 



For instance, we&apos;ve plowed addi- 
tional money into coal— to increase 
coal production, mine safety 
and employment. 

Now coal and oil help fund 
our development of uranium— 
and research into new forms of 
energy, such as synthetic gas and 
gasohne, that aren&apos;t commerciaUy 
practical today but could be in 
the future. 



This year alone, we plan to 
spend more than $1 bilhon to develop 
more energy supphes. 

From the many forms of energy 
Conoco produces today comes the 
financial strength to produce the 
fuels of tomorrow.

Biata 



was found that comets are sur- 
rounded by clouds of this gas in a 
huge sphere much larger than the 
comet head. This gas is not seen 
at visible wavelengths — and cer- 
tainly not by the naked eye. These 
observations were first made in 
1970. Identification of the spec- 
tral lines of other atoms and mole- 
cules at ultraviolet wavelengths 
soon followed, including lines char- 
acteristic of atomic carbon and 
carbon monoxide. 

Where does the energy for these 
emission lines come from? Some 
sunlight is absorbed by cometary 
atoms and molecules and subse- 
quently reemitted. Detailed studies 
of comet spectra support the con- 
clusion that almost all the radiant 
energy from comets has its origin 
in sunlight. 

With the passage of comet Ko- 
houtek and other recent bright 
comets, the wavelength range of 
comet observations has been ex- 
tended to include wavelengths 
longer than the visible. We have 
already mentioned the infrared 
region, where wavelengths range 
from a ten-thousandth of a centi- 
meter to a hundredth of a centi- 
meter. Emissions have also been 
seen at microwave wavelengths 
that are on the order of a centimeter 
long. Among the molecules whose 



spectral lines have been seen at 
these wavelengths is the rather 
complex methylcyanide molecule, 
heretofore also observed in clouds 
of gas in interstellar space. Many 
other molecules that have no sig- 
nificant visible emission lines will 
presumably be observed by micro- 
wave telescopes in the future. 

Now that we have glanced at the 
spectroscopic information on com- 
ets, let us try to interpret it and 
attempt to unmask the nature of 
these familiar but obscure objects. 
The most fruitful theory of comet 
composition has been the &quot;dirty 
iceball&quot; theory devised by Fred 
Whipple, an astronomer at Har- 
vard University. This theory states 
that the gas of molecules and atoms 
is formed as sunlight heats a solid 
nucleus of &quot;ices,&quot; which measures 
about ten kilometers (six miles) 
in diameter, in a process known as 
sublimation. In other words, the 
nucleus is a frozen hunk of water 
ice, as well as the cold solids, 
or ices, of other chemicals such as 
methane, ammonia, and carbon 
dioxide. 

Why are these species originally 
frozen? Because comets come 
from a region of space far from the 
sun, near Jupiter and beyond, 
where bodies have temperatures 
below the freezing points of these 



gases, perhaps below -200°C. As 
comets approach the sun, their 
nuclear surface is softened up by 
the heat of sunlight and gases 
escape into the surrounding space. 
The comet dust, which escapes 
with the gas, is made of heavier, 
more rocklike material such as 
oxides of silicon (related to sand) — 
hence the name &quot;dirty iceball.&quot; 

The nucleus is presumably lo- 
cated in the center of the comet 
head. If only sublimation were in- 
volved, the gas and dust would re- 
main in a spherical head around 
the nucleus and comets would ap- 
pear to be balls of light. But comets 
have a tail. Something pushes the 
gas and dust away from the head. 

When bits of solar radiation, or 
photons, are absorbed by atoms, 
molecules, or dust particles, the 
absorption process resembles in 
some respects a collision between 
billiard balls. The photons are ini- 
tially moving away from the sun, 
and when an atom, molecule, or 
dust particle absorbs the photon, 
the absorbing object &quot;rebounds&quot; 
away from the sun. Similarly, elec- 
trons and protons escaping from 
the solar surface in the solar wind 
also collide with the comet gas and 
cause it to rebound. The net eifect 
is that atoms, molecules, and dust 
&quot;tail&quot; behind the comet nucleus.

It takes a while from the time a par- 
ticle leaves the nucleus to the time 
it has undergone enough of these 
collisions to be swept backward. 
Therefore, a region near the nu- 
cleus remains more or less spheri- 
cally symmetric. The reflection of 
light from dust in this region is 
what gives the appearance of the 
head. 

Finally, some comets actually 
have two tails because ions are 
pushed rapidly away from a 
comet&apos;s orbital path by the action 
of the magnetic field emanating 
from the sun. This leads to a visible 
&quot;ion tail.&quot; The dust is much less 
strongly affected by magnetic 
fields. Thus it trails behind the 
head in a different direction from 
the ions. Comet tails can sometimes 
stretch tens of millions of miles 
across the sky, but the whole show 
is produced by a tiny nucleus that 
is only a few miles in diameter 
and contains much less mass than 
the earth. That is why Whipple has 
called comets &quot;the greatest deceiv- 
ers in the solar system.&quot; 

The most important prediction 
of the dirty iceball theory is that 
molecules sublimating from the 
nucleus will absorb solar radiation 
as they stream outward in the head 
and that this absorbed energy will 
cause some of the molecules to 
fragment. One way the molecules 
may fragment is by splitting off 
one or more of their constituent 
atoms, a process called &quot;photo- 
dissociation.&quot; Molecules may also 
fragment by ejecting an electron to 
form a positive ion in a process 
known as &quot;photoionization.&quot; Thus 
the theory predicts that molecules 
that can form ices, or &quot;parent 
molecules,&quot; as well as their frag- 
ments and ions, should be present 
in the head and be observable 
through the characteristic emission 
lines of each molecule, ion, or 
fragment. 

A curious fact about the data on 
comets is that although emission 
lines of fragments and ions are 
observed, as previously men- 
tioned, emission lines of reasonable 
candidates for parent molecules are 
generally not observed. There are 
three exceptions: a microwave 
emission line of water was tenta- 
tively identified in comet Brad- 
field one evening in 1974, and emis- 
sion lines of hydrogen cyanide and 
methylcyanide were seen on sev- 
eral evenings from comet Kohoutek. 



The limited nature of these obser- 
vations is surprising, considering 
that emission lines of hydrogen 
atoms, hydroxyl radicals, hydroxyl 
ions, and water ions — all fragments 
of water^are commonly observed 
in comets. 

Similarly, observations hint that 
comets contain little or no ammonia 
or methane, even though their 
molecular fragments — nitrogen- 
hydrogen and carbon-hydrogen 
radicals and ions — are ubiquitous. 
Although part of the problem of the 
missing parent molecules is that 
atmospheric absorption interferes 
with the observation of many of 
their emission lines, they are still far 
more scarce than anticipated. If the 
expected parents aren&apos;t there, how 
is it their fragments are found in the 
comet head? 

Three possible solutions have 
been advanced. One is that our ob- 
servations are incomplete and 
eventually we shall observe water, 
carbon dioxide, and other parent 
molecules directly and in substan- 
tial abundance. Hence, most scien- 
tists still think that water is the best 
bet as one of the major comet 
molecules. 

The second possibility is that 
parent molecules don&apos;t really exist 
and that the fragments themselves 
are sublimated from the nucleus. 
This is generally discounted be- 
cause the fragments, especially the 
ions, are too reactive to be stored 
in the nucleus for very long. 

The third possibility is the 
most intriguing. It is that the frag- 
ments are not generated by the 
parent molecules they most closely 
resemble. In other words, nitro- 
gen-hydrogen, carbon-hydrogen, 
and hydroxyl radicals and ions 
may not arise directly from am- 
monia, methane, and water, but as 
products of chemical reactions 
.involving other parent molecules 
and their fragments. In support of 
this theory is the fact that some 
fragments in the head, such as the 
carbon molecule C3, cannot be 
made in abundance by any simple 
fragmentation process of a reason- 
able parent molecule but can be 
made by chemical reactions. Cal- 
culations have shown that chemical 
reactions will certainly be a domi- 
nant source of some fragments, 
although dissociation and ionization 
are undoubtedly the dominant 
source of others. 

The new awareness of the im- 



portance of chemistry in the comet 
head may hasten a reinterpretation 
of the spectra of the fragment spe- 
cies. Such a study would provide 
an idea of the molecules that left 
the nucleus and subsequently under- 
went photoionization, photodis- 
sociation, and chemical reactions. 
The failure to observe some parent 
molecules may simply mean that we 
are looking for the wrong ones. It 
has even been suggested that 
some of the unseen parent mole- 
cules are closely related to the 
organic chemicals that constitute 
living things and that this material 
was deposited on earth after escap- 
ing the tail of a comet. Some 
scientists have speculated that 
these molecules may have been in- 
volved in the origin of life on earth. 

We are still unsure about what 
molecules are present in comets, 
that is, what comets are made of. 
But the chemical approach is a 
significant step in the direction of 
solving this problem. Once we 
know what comets are made of, 
we will be better able to answer two 
other important questions: Where 
in the solar system do new comets 
come from? How are comets made? 

How will we investigate comets 
in the future? One exciting possi- 
bility is that a space probe might 
be sent directly to a comet, either 
passing through it or flying along- 
side and perhaps docking with the 
nucleus. Samples of comet mate- 
rial would then be directly ob- 
servable and might even be re- 
trieved and returned to earth. 
Halley&apos;s Comet is a possible target 
for such adventures during its 1986 
return. The impact on our knowl- 
edge of comets and of the solar 
system would be spectacular. If 
we probed a new comet, not only 
would the age-old question of 
comet composition be answered, 
but we would have in our hands 
material from the edge of the solar 
system, the portals of outer space. 
This material, probably undis- 
turbed since before the birth of the 
earth and the sun, would contain a 
record of the far distant past, a 
time otherwise inaccessible except 
in our imaginations.

What&apos;s in our name? 

You may be wondering why we call our 
newsletter balloon. There are two reasons. 

First, the balloonist has a unique vantage 
point — a wide, aU-encompassing view of the 
earth. So does balloon. Our correspondents 
are stationed around the globe (in Italy, 
France, Hong Kong, Australia and dozens of 
other countries), feeding us a constant stream 
of on-the-scene reports. They tell us — and 
you — about places, events and ideas you&apos;d 
literally never learn about anywhere else. It&apos;s 
all put together by balloon&apos;s editor, Richard 
Berman — a professional travel writer and cer- 
tified Ttavel Fanatic. 

Second, the spirit of ballooning — that soar- 
ing, joyous feeling of freedom and adventure 
precisely captures our editorial style. We think 
writing and reading about travel should be in- 
teresting as travel itself. So our articles and 
reports are exciting. Colorful. Fun to read. 
And just a bit offbeat. In sum, as exhilarating 
as a balloon ride. 




What&apos;s more, balloon is a pleasure simply 
to look at. Designed by one of New York&apos;s top 
art directors, its graphics are crisp and mod- 
ern, and its pages are filled with lush, on- 
the-spot photos. 

Once you see your first issue, we think 
you&apos;ll agree: balloon is the way to travel.

Imperiled Bats 

of Eagle Creek Cave

Mexican free-tailed hats 
face the twin threats of 
pesticides and harassment 



Eagle Creek Canyon forms part 
of the southwestern drainage for 
Arizona&apos;s rugged Gila Mountains. 
The canyon is hot, arid, remote; and 
an ideal place for the Mexican 
free-tailed bat to give birth and rear 
young. Small moths and beetles are 
abundant in the nearby Gila River 
valley, within easy foraging range 
for the bats. Moths make up better 
than 50 percent of the bat&apos;s diet. 
Other locally plentiful prey are 
termites, leaf hoppers, flies, and 
night-flying wasps. Another — and 
crucial — attraction for the bats is a 
large cave in one of the canyon 
walls. 

This cave, about a hundred feet 
above creek level, is entered 
through a large vertical slit that 
leads to a single, football-shaped 
chamber about 288 feet long. 65 
feet wide, and 80 feet high. The bats 
roost in a 6-foot-wide crack that ex- 
tends nearly one-third the length of 
the ceiling. 

Mexican free-tailed bats are gre- 
garious and their colonies have the 
highest population density of any 
mammal on earth. Two or three 
hundred can easily pack themselves 
into a square foot of ceiling space. 
Since they use the cave primarily 
for giving birth and rearing their 
young, the bats at Eagle Creek con- 
stitute a maternal colony. (Males 
make up only about 10 percent of 
the cave&apos;s bat population. The bulk 
of the males use other caves scat- 
tered throughout the surrounding 
area as roosting sites.) The bones 
of baby bats found in ancipnt guano 



deposits indicate that such cave- 
dwelling maternity colonies have 
had a long history. 

The earliest known bat fossils 
date back to the Eocene (36 to 53 
million years ago). Bats probably 
diverged from small mammals that 
lived in trees and foraged among the 
branches for insects. The develop- 
ment of a membrane between the 
fingers of these precursors of con- 
temporary bats enabled them to 
leap farther after insects and scoop 
up their prey as modern species do. 
An echolocation apparatus also 
evolved as a mechanism for catch- 
ing insects in the dark. Just how 
these adaptations evolved, and over 
what period of time, is not known, 
but together they enabled some an- 
cestral bats to exploit an arboreal, 
and eventually an aerial, insectivore 
niche more efficiently. (Fruit- and 
fish-eating bats probably evolved 
from insectivorous species.) 

The membrane that developed 
between their fingers was a mixed 
blessing for these small mammals, 
for while it enabled them to pursue 
insects more efficiently, it also 
drastically increased their body 
surface area, which in turn, in- 
creases heat loss. This factor, along 
with food availability, has been 
largely responsible for most bats 
today being restricted to warm cli- 
mates. Those that live in the temp- 
erate regions of the globe either 
migrate equatorially during the win- 
ter or become torpid. 

Mexican free-tailed bats, Tada- 
rida brasiliensis mexkana, range 
throughout the American South- 
west and Mexico. Their classifica- 
tion as a subspecies is based on 
their migratory behavior, that is, 
populations of these bats migrate 



between summering and wintering 
areas in the United States and 
Mexico. (Free-tailed bats are dis- 
tributed throughout North, Central, 
and South America, and some pop- 
ulations, or subspecies, do not 
migrate.) 

The bats of the Eagle Creek col- 
ony have short, trim ears, a stream- 
lined body, and long, narrow wings 
well adapted for fairly long flights. 
Banding studies have shown that 
they are capable of traveling at least 
forty-three miles in one night. The 
Eagle Creek colony spends the win- 
ter somewhere south of the Mexi- 
can state of Sinaloa, on the western 
side of the Sierra Madre. Although 
the exact location of their winter 
roost is not known, their seasonal 
migrations entgil minimum flights of 
800 miles. 

Frqm observations of other col- 
onies of free-tailed bats, research- 
ers have learned that breeding takes 
place in Mexico during February 
and March. The bats copulate while 
hanging from the ceiling of a cave. 
and the females develop vaginal 
plugs following mating. The gesta- 
tion period is from seventy-seven to 
eighty-four days. 

1 believe that fertilization triggers 
northward migration; other re- 
searchers think that food availabil- 
ity is the key. But all researchers 
agree that young bats develop most 
quickly when the ambient tempera-

ture is roughly 87°F. If the tempera- 
ture in the cave of a maternal col- 
ony rises above this, the young are 
likely to die from overheating. 
Free-tailed bats, especially the 
young, cluster and, therefore, have 
trouble remaining cool. During the 
summer, when most caves are sim- 
ply too hot for the young to survive, 
maternal colonies of free-tails in 
Mexico are only found at high eleva- 
tions (5,000 to 7,000 feet) along the 
central plateau or in the north- 
ernmost states. 

At Eagle Creek, free-tails don&apos;t 
winter over because despite the de- 
creased metabolism characteristic 
of hibernation, energy is still re- 
quired to maintain the bat. The 
amount of energy depends on the 
bat&apos;s body temperature during 
hibernation (which stays about 
1.8°F above the ambient tempera- 
ture). The lower the ambient tem- 
perature, the less energy required 



to maintain the animal through the 
winter. But the Eagle Creek cave 
does not get very cold during win- 
ter. I doubt whether the tempera- 
ture ever gets below 60°F at the 
ceiling of the cave. Thus, hibernat- 
ing bats would have to maintain a 
body temperature of at least 6rF 
over the winter, as they have no 
physiological mechanisms to lower 
their temperature below that of the 
surrounding air. My guess is that 
this is too high for the bats. Their 
energy reserves would give out be- 
fore food became available in the 
spring. While migration uses up en- 
ergy, food is available en route to 
replenish energy losses. 

The northward migration occurs 
from March to June, with the ma- 
jority of the bats arriving at Eagle 
Creek in May. In early June the 
pregnant females give birth to their 
single oflFspring or, in many cases, 
twins. The young have well-devel- 



oped toenails for clinging to the 
ceiling, a position they maintain 
until capable of flight. Those young 
that lose their grip fall to a sure 
death. The naked and blind young 
bats pack together, often apart from 
the adults. They develop rapidly 
and are able to fly as early as thirty- 
eight days after birth. 

Throughout the summer nights, 
the females forage for insects, re- 
turning before dawn to indiscrimi- 
nately nurse the young. No obvious 
effort is made by the mothers to 
insure that all the young get fed. 
The more aggressive young cling to 
any lactating female that lands 
nearby and suckle; those that don&apos;t, 
become weak and fall. 

As the adults leave the cave in 
the evening, they rise in a spiral- 
ing plume (which flattens out at 
about 1 ,000 feet), then disperse into 
distinct groups, flying at heights of 
50 to 100 feet. When they reach 



52 




their foraging areas in the Gila River 
valley, they flutter and dive in quick 
zigzags after moths and other prey. 
They scoop up the insects in their 
tail membrane or wings, then deftly 
transfer the prey to their mouth. 
The entire sequence is so fast that 
it can only be observed with a high- 
speed motion picture camera. 

During the day, the adults sleep 
on the ceiling, but individuals 
awake periodically and change 
positions within a cluster. As they 
fly to a new sleeping site, their 
wings circulate the air, cooling 
themselves and the others in the 
process. At any moment during the 
day, as many as 10 percent of the 
adults may be awake, chattering 
and moving about. The individuals 
engaging in this behavior rotate 
throughout the day — some of the 
sleepers become coolers, and the 
coolers go back to sleep. 

Little rice-sized pellets of guano.

mixed with a fine mist of urine, rain 
down from the tapestry of bats 
clinging to the ceiling. The pellets 
on the cave floor are crawling with 
the larvae of beetles of the genus 
Dermestes, which make their living 
by eating flesh, particularly the flesh 
of dead bats. In spring, when the 
bats return from their annual migra- 
tion to Mexico, there are few larvae 
present on the guano layer. The 
beetle eggs have lain in the guano 
during the eight months of fall, win- 
ter, and early spring, a period in 
which little food is available for a 
carnivorous beetle. Then, triggered 
perhaps by the urine from the newly 
arrived bats, the beetle eggs begin to 
hatch. They mature rapidly, passing 
through several larval stages before 
they metamorphose and mate. 

In June, the guano pellets lie un- 
crumbled because there are few 
beetles, but by August, the guano 
is covered with writhing larvae and 
adults. As these scavengers wander 
the cave searching for carrion they 
roll the pellets around, eventually 
pulverizing them. The fragments 
are worked into a dense mat held 
together by molted bat hairs and 



shed exoskeletons from the larvae. 

Shortly after the bats leave the 
cave in late September or early 
October, the adult beetles lay their 
eggs and then die. Within a week of 
the bats&apos; departure, all remaining 
carcasses on the cave floor have 
been picked clean. The cycle will be 
repeated when the bats return the 
next spring. The history of these 
annual cycles is visible in cores 
taken from the guano deposits; each 
annual layer of whole pellets forms 
an underpinning for a tough, dura- 
ble layer of completely fragmented 
guano. These layers can be sepa- 
rated and dated, and by analyzing 
them we determined that the bats of 
Eagle Creek are in trouble. Recent 
layers were considerably thinner 
than older ones, verifying a pro- 
gressive population decline that 
had been observed by earlier re- 
searchers. 

In the eariy 1950s, E. Lendell 
Cockrum of the University of Ari- 
zona estimated the bat population 
in the Eagle Creek cave at several 
million. The bat population is now 
hovering at about 100,000 and de- 
creasing by about 10 percent each 
year. Similar reductions in the 
colony of Mexican free-tailed bats 
at Carlsbad Caverns have also 
occurred. There is no evidence that 
the subspecies is increasing its popu- 
lation anywhere over its range. 

The primary culprit in the pre- 
cipitous decline of these bats all 
over the Southwest may be pesti- 
cides. As young bats maturate they

build up fat deposits, storing energy 
in preparation for the fall migration. 
Pesticide residues accumulate in 
the stored fat. J. Scott Altenbach at 
the University of New Mexico has 
recently determined that pesticide 
residues in the fat of young bats at 
Carlsbad Caverns are similar to 
those found in humans — too low to 
be toxic. My research group has 
found that the same low levels exist 
in the young of the Eagle Creek 
colony. 

Pesticides applied to irrigated 
crops in the Gila River valley are 
taken up by the larvae of small 
moths and other insects. Residues 
of these toxic substances accumu- 
late and persist through metamor- 
phosis, when the adult insects are 
eaten by bats. The residues, many 
of which are fat soluble, concen- 
trate in a bat&apos;s fatty tissue and in 
the fatty fraction of a female&apos;s milk. 
Lactating females actually have a 
lower body burden of fat-soluble 
pesticide residues than adult males 
or nonlactating females in the same 
population. The residues that the 
females excrete in their milk is ab- 
sorbed by the babies and stored in 
their fat deposits. 



During the strenuous fall migra- 
tion, the young bats burn up their 
fat deposits. As the fat disappears, 
the pesticide residues enter the cir- 
culatory system and localize in the 
brain. Levels of such toxic sub- 
stances in the brain may increase at 
least a hundredfold during migra- 
tion. Since these concentrations 
can be lethal, it is unlikely that 
many bats affected in this manner 
survive the longjourney to Mexico. 

Pesticides may have another 
deleterious eflFect on bat popula- 
tions by removing their food source. 
The use of poisons in foraging areas 
could destroy those insects that 
constitute a major portion of the 
bats&apos; diet. If staple insects become 
limited after baby bats are born, 
their mothers have only two alter- 
natives: abandon their young to 
seek more abundant food supplies 
for themselves or remain and 
starve. My observations of mater- 
nal behavior in bats lead me to 
believe that in such a circumstance 
the mothers would abandon their 
young. 

At the present time, food avail- 
ability does not seem to be a limit- 
ing factor for the Eagle Creek col- 
ony. But the population is only a 
fraction (3 to 5 percent) of what it 
was only twenty years ago. The 
biggest decline in the Eagle Creek 
bat population occurred before my 
research began, and may have been 
tied to insects being reduced in the 
area by pesticides. Cotton is the 
principal crop in the Gila River val- 
ley, and pests are controlled with 



aerial application of methylpara- 
thion and toxaphene. Over the past 
twenty years, a variety of fat- 
soluble pesticides have also been 
heavily used. 

Bat hassling is also taking a toil. 
One Saturday morning, a caravan 
of twelve vehicles passed our camp 
in Eagle Creek and continued down 
the canyon toward the cave. We 
heard gunshots, followed by a 
sprinkling of bats flying back and 
forth overhead. Twenty minutes 
later, the caravan resumed its pro- 
gression down the canyon. Near 
the cave entrance we found a 20- 
gauge shotgun cartridge and a .45- 
caliber shell, and the strong odor of 
gunpowder was pervasive. From 
where the shots were fired, no bats 
could have been hit because the 
roosting area is out of sight of the 
entrance. Apparently, these people 
had simply fired their weapons into 
the cave to panic the animals into 
flight. More than an hour after the 
shots, the bats were still returning to 
the cave. The animals flew in a loose, 
circling pattern near the entrance. 
We climbed the huge pile of guano 
searching for dead bats, but there 
were none. Three days later, how- 
ever, we found a pile of eighty-five 
dead baby bats being devoured by 
the dermestid beetles and their lar- 
vae. The stress caused by the dis- 
turbance of the gunshots may have 
been enough for the young to lose 
their grip on the ceiling. They could 
have fallen for some other reason, 
but we would not normally expect 
so many infant bats to die at one 
time. 

Mexican free-tailed bats need 
help to survive the twin threats of 
pesticide stress and human distur- 
bance. Preserving the privacy of 
maternity colonies and restricting 
the use of fat-soluble pesticides in 
their foraging area are the only ac- 
tions that will save them. D 



Ney Cave in Texas has the 
highest concentration of bats 

in the United States. Some 
25 million Mexican free-tails 

use the cave at densities of 
up to 300 per square foot.

The Natural History of Medieval Women 



They began to live longer, but they lost 
economic and social ground 

by David Herlihy 




ersed in reconstructing 
all dimensions of past 
human experience, many 
modern social historians 
have become especially 
nterested in women. 
Partly inspired by the 
contemporary feminist 
movement (whose ad- 
vocates have correctly 
pointed out that the his- 
^j tory of roughly half of hu- 
manity has been systematically slighted), these histo- 
rians also recognize that in the natural and social history 
of any society, women have unique and critical func- 
tions. They carry the new generation to term, sustain 
children in early life, and usually introduce the young to 
the society and culture of which they will be a part. 
Women begin the processes through which human 
cultures strive to achieve what their individual mem- 
bers cannot — indefinite life, immortality. 

Few historians are willing to accept the claims of 
sociobiologists, who find culture already programmed 
in genes and who subordinate cultural history to natural 
history. But most would agree that human societies and 
civilizations cannot be properly evaluated or ap- 
preciated without considering the basic biological expe- 
riences of their members. These crucial events — 
including the duration of life itself under various social 
and historical conditions, as well as the timing of 
nursing and weaning, sexual maturity, marriage and 
mating, reproduction, menopause, and aging — are 
often by no means parallel experiences for both men 
and women and can have radically different conse- 
quences for each sex. 

The biological experiences of women throughout the 
Middle Ages are interesting because of the length of 
this particular period: we can observe a thousand years 
of women&apos;s careers and the contours of their lives. Data 
concerning the Middle Ages are notoriously intractable 
— difficult to find, difficult to interpret. But medieval 
scholars advanced some general comments on the 
biology of women, and a few of these ideas have come 
down to us; even some precious statistical information 
that illuminates how women fared in the real world. 
Finally, some biographies, chiefly of saints and queens, 
support our rudimentary knowledge of women&apos;s situa- 
tions. All these sources have manifest gaps, but taken 
together, they present coherent pictures of medieval 
women. Although medievalists are often obliged to be 
jugglers and prestidigitators, they are not without pins 
or beans with which to play. 



In the Middle Ages, life expectancies apparently 
varied sharply, in accordance with epidemiological 
conditions. For unclear reasons, western Europe was 
practically free of epidemics from the sixth to the four- 
teenth century, when the infamous Black Death of 
1348-1349 introduced an epoch of recurrent and de- 
vastating plagues. From the thirteenth century on, we 
know the birth and death dates of many medieval 
nobles and townspeople, predominantly male, and can 
venture some estimates. In the plague-free years of the 
thirteenth century, people could expect to live be- 
tween 35 and 40 years. In the stricken generations 
including and immediately following the Black Death, 
life expectancies fell to only 17 or 18 years. It thereaf- 
ter slowly lengthened and averaged about 30 years 
during the fifteenth century. 

Life expectancies for women shifted up or down in 
phase with this general movement. But simultane- 
ously, a small, significant change was taking place. 
Women were beginning to survive better than men; 
they were acquiring an advantage in longevity that, in 
the Western world, they have not since relinquished. 

Medieval natural philosophers concluded that 
women&apos;s chances for life were improving. The biol- 
ogists of the ancient world — of whom the foremost was 
Aristotle — had affirmed that, saving unusual circum- 
stances, males of all species live longer than females 
(hard work or excessive sexual indulgence might frus- 
trate nature&apos;s intent and artificially shorten the male 
life span). Males represented the perfection of the 
human species; females were an imperfection of nature, 
albeit a happy one, in view of their essential contribu- 
tion to propagation. The defective females passed 
through all stages of life quicker than the male. They 
reached sexual maturity sooner, aged earlier, and were 
the first to die. The ancient biologists thought that 
specific humors determined a person&apos;s temperament 
and believed that women&apos;s temperaments, dominated 
by cold and dry humors, hurried them toward the cold 
and dry state of death. 

In the twelfth century, when a renaissance of learn- 
ing began in western Europe, scholars reexamined the 
biological writings of Aristotle and other classics. 
Initially, medieval natural scientists repeated without 
elaboration the ancients&apos; opinion that men, as perfect 
representations of the species, live longer than women. 
Then, in the thirteenth century, the foremost biologist 
of the age. Saint Albertus Magnus (Albert the Great), 
who died in 1280, treated the question of the relative 
longevity of the sexes in a novel fashion. In Albertus&apos;s 
view, the Philosopher, Aristotle, was indeed correct. 
Men live longer than women naniraliter, &quot;according

to the natural order.&quot; But women live longer than 
mtn per accidens, &quot;by accident,&quot; by which Albertus 
apparently meant under the distinctive conditions of 
his period. He gives three reasons for women&apos;s longer 
life expectancy: sexual intercourse is less demanding 
on women than on men; menstruation flushes impuri- 
ties from women&apos;s bodies; and women &quot;work less, and 
for that reason are not so much consumed.&quot; We can 
question what Albertus meant by the judgment that the 
demands of sexual intercourse or the purgative func- 
tions of menstruation were accidental, but his observa- 
tion that the burdens of labor lowered men&apos;s natural life 
expectancies is worth remembering. 

Subsequently, other medieval authors also con- 
cluded that women live longer than men. Some even 
occasionally pointed out that women must be the 
superior sex because they live longer and thus fulfill 
nature&apos;s intent better than males. Learned opinion 
shifted and the ancient belief in the greater life ex- 
pectancy of males was slowly abandoned. 

This change in scholarly attitudes corresponded 
with an actual improvement in life expectancies for 
women. From the opening centuries of the Christian 
Era, we have tens of thousands of funeral inscriptions, 
from visible standing monuments and from tomb- 
stones uncovered by archeologists&apos; excavations. These 
epigraphs give age at death and allow a rough calcula- 
tion of the duration of life according to sex. The evi- 
dence seems to confirm Aristotle&apos;s opinion that at 
their death, men in these populations of the late ancient 
era were four to seven years older than women. How- 
ever, there may be a bias in the data; presumably, 
the young wife who died prematurely was more likely 
to earn a memorial than the aged and forgotten widow. 
But we are certain that women were in short supply in 
ancient society, either through systematic infanticide 
of girls or through shorter life expectancies. The bio- 
logical experience of the women — or baby girls — of 
classical antiquity was not especially happy. 

Unfortunately, we have no comparable epigraphic 



evidence from medieval populations. The earliest 
surviving relevant data are sporadic surveys made by 
the great European monasteries, which wanted clear 
records of the rents they could expect from their lands. 
We have between fifteen and twenty of these studies, 
dating from the ninth century on and enumerating 
populations settled on particular estates or manors. The 
largest census was taken by the monastery of Saint 
Germain-des-Pres in Paris and covers lands that are 
now mainly Parisian suburbs. Monasterial surveys of 
the early medieval world characteristically show more 
men than women, with ratios as high as 130 men per 
100 women. Women continued to be in short supply. 

Of course, the monasteries may have counted males 
more carefully. Still, much indirect evidence suggests 
that women were both few and highly valued in early 
medieval society. The barbarian legal codes, passed 
down orally and finally redacted between the fifth and 
ninth centuries as Christianity spread and introduced 
literacy, characteristically imposed a fine, usually 
called a Wergeld, on anyone who caused a person&apos;s 
injury or death. The fines protecting women were 
usually as high as, and sometimes higher than, those 
protecting men, and women of childbearing age some- 
times enjoyed special value. Moreover, in marriage 
arrangements, the groom brought the dowry to the 
bride. The male or his family assumed the principal 
costs of setting up the new household. This reverse 
dowry suggests that grooms had to compete for rela- 
tively few brides. 

About 965, an Arab geographer, Ibrahim ibn-Iakub, 
described Slavic marriage customs, which, in many 
respects, were typical of all barbarian Europe. Ibrahim 
reported that the &quot;marital price&quot; required of grooms 
was so high that &quot;if a man has two or three daughters, 
they are as riches to him; if, however, boys are born to 
him, this becomes for him a cause of poverty.&quot; Nearly 
the same complaint would be widely heard again in 
Europe during the late Middle Ages (1350-1500), but 
the sexual references would be exactly reversed.

Month of February, from the Breviario Grimani, a 
manuscript in the Biblioteca Marciana, Venice. 

From the eleventh or twelfth century, the relative 
number of women in medieval society, and presumably 
their life expectancies, rose. A rough estimate of 
life expectancies for the urban and rural population 
of Pistoia in Italy in 1427 is 29.8 years for women; 
28.4 years for men. The shift is most apparent among 
the high nobility and in the towns. In Bologna in 1395, 
there were only 95.6 men for every 100 women; in 
fifteenth-century Nuremberg, there were 83.8 men per 
100 women. Even in cities where the sex ratio fa- 
vored men — as in Florence in 1427 — women grew more 
numerous in the progression up the scale of ages and 
held an absolute majority among the elderly. Although 
many older women may have migrated to the city, 
women probably also survived better under conditions 
of urban life. 

There are several reasons for women&apos;s improving 
chances of survival during the central Middle Ages 
(1000-1350). The establishment of strong governments 
and a stable political order lowered the level and 
reduced the incidence of violence. New ideals of 
chivalry restricted — although they by no means com- 
pletely ended— women&apos;s active participation in warfare 
as fighters or as victims. Women fare better under 
peaceful conditions, when they do not run the constant 
risk of attack, rape, or abduction. But the most decisive 
changes were economic. Primitive agricultural 
economies, with their low production levels, used 
predominantly the labor of women, children, and the 
aged. In a famous description written in a.d. 98, the 
Roman historian Tacitus observed that among the 
barbarian Germans, women and children maintained 



the household economy, while adult males gave them- 
selves over to war and indolence. This pattern probably 
was preserved well into the Middle Ages. But intensive 
cultivation requires heavy field work, which women 
cannot readily perform; peasant women in the late 
Middle Ages worked hard on their farms, but they were 
no longer alone. 

Finally, the new urban economy offered little em- 
ployment for women. They spun at home, prayed in 
convents, and labored as household servants, but they 
did not constitute a significant part of the urban labor 
force. Families considered their daughters burdens, 
unable to earn their keep. Girls were also burdens to 
prospective husbands, and so the terms of marriage 
turned against women. The reverse dowry all but 
disappeared, and the girl or her family had to meet the 
principal costs of marriage. Throughout the late Middle 
Ages, the social position of women visibly deterio- 
rated, but so also did the social demands and pres- 
sures laid upon them. For women, less participation in 
economic life and diminishing social importance meant 
better chances of biological survival. 

The other principal biological events in women&apos;s 
lives, menarche and menopause, are diflScult to ex- 
amine historically. Medieval medical writers, who 
abounded from the eleventh century on, commonly 
placed menarche at between twelve and fifteen years 
of age and menopause at fifty. But we have no way of 
knowing whether they were recording their own ob- 
servations or merely echoing the ancient authorities. 
Both Roman law and canon law of the medieval 
Church set the age of puberty and of binding marriage 
at twelve years for girls and fourteen years for boys. 
Saint Augustine, who lived from 354 to 430, con- 
tracted to marry a girl &quot;two years below the marriage- 
able age&quot;; presumably, she was ten. &quot;I liked her,&quot; 
he reports in his Confessions, &quot;and was prepared to 
wait.&quot; He was then thirty years old. Had his conver- 
sion to celibacy not intervened, the girl would have 
been married at age twelve or soon after, to a groom 
twenty years older. The pattern seems typical of 
Roman marriages within the privileged orders. 

The medieval canonical requirement that girls be at 
least twelve years old at the consummation of their 
marriage was a lower bound. There are many indica- 
tions that girls at menarche were closer to age fifteen 
than to age twelve. In the law of the seventh-century 
Visigoths, a girl was not considered capable of bearing 
children until age fifteen. In a manorial survey of the 
early ninth century, from the church of Saint Victor of 
Marseilles, girls are called &quot;marriageable&quot; only from 
age fifteen. The customs of Anjou in 1246 similarly give 
age fifteen as the date of presumed maturity for 
women. 

Still, the traditional estimate of age twelve for men- 
arche was not entirely unrealistic. To judge from mar- 
riage patterns, which we can discern from the four- 
teenth and fifteenth centuries on, rich urban girls 
tended to be very young at first marriage — younger 
than those of lower social station and younger even 
than peasant women. Chaucer&apos;s wife of Bath, a 
middle-class, urban woman, was first married at

age twelve, and many urban women were already 
mothers by age fifteen. Social factors were important 
here: the rich were apparently eager to settle the future 
of their daughters as early as possible. But the evi- 
dence also hints that menarche came sooner among 
rich women, and amenorrhea (abnormal absence or 
suppression of the menses) was presumably less com- 
mon among them. In consequence, rich women in 
marriage tended to be consistently more prolific than 
the poor. 

Some dietitians argue that girls must achieve a cer- 
tain critical amount of body fat to trigger menarche 
and also to sustain menstruation. The better diet and 
ease of living that rich Roman girls and their medieval 
counterparts enjoyed gave them low ages of menarche. 
close to the thirteenth year anticipated in Roman and 
canon law. Girls in the countryside and among the 
poor classes were probably at menarche closer to age 
fifteen — the year most commonly encountered in the 
barbarian codes, manorial surveys, and customary 
laws. Perhaps these same groups also experienced 
relatively early menopause. The laws of the Visigoths 
assume that a woman would no longer be fertile after 
age forty. Apart from what we have gleaned from legal 
sources, we can say little with certainty about these 
principal events in the female life cycle. 

To add flesh and features to our portrait of women, 
we can rapidly review the lives of three real people — a 
peasant, a queen, and a bourgeoise. Our peasant is a 
woman named Alpaix. She was eventually canonized 
in the late nineteenth century, and even during the 
Middle Ages, her sanctity was so well recognized that, 
unlike most peasant women, she attracted a biographer. 

Alpaix was bom about 1155 in a village near Sens 
in northern France. Her biographer says that her 
father, a poor man, &quot;earned his bread by the sweat of 
his face,&quot; by laboriously tilling the soil. Alpaix was the 
eldest child with several younger brothers. From an 
early age, she had to assist her father in the heavy 
work of cultivating the fields. As he drove his two 
oxen at the head of the plow, she marched alongside, 
goading the animals to more strenuous eflFort. When so 
ordered, she carried manure and sheep dung on her 
slight shoulders to the fields and gardens. Her young 
frame could not easily bear the weight, and her father, 
who seems to have felt no particular sympathy for her, 
lashed the burdens to her back. Besides her other 
chores, she had to lead the cattle and sheep to pasture 
and guard them as they grazed. 

All this she did willingly, even on Sundays and festi- 
vals, when other peasant girls gave themselves over 
to dancing and &quot;frivolous things.&quot; But then, at the 
age of twelve, she could no longer sustain the charges 
laid upon her. According to her biographer, &quot;the 
tender maiden could no longer bear such heavy labors. 
Rather, her entire insides were broken and torn from 
the magnitude of unrelieved work. Drawing deep sighs 
from the depths of her heart, with the color of her 
lovely face all marred, she finally gave external, visible 
signs of her internal suffering. What more can be said? 
Gripped by unyielding weakness, she remained for an 
entire year recumbent on her hard and bitter bed, made 



of straw, without mattress and sheets. . . .&quot; Ugly 
lesions appeared on her skin, and her body exuded 
such a repulsive odor that her family isolated her in a 
hut. For her sustenance, they&apos; delivered black bread 
daily to her door. But because she could no longer 
contribute to the household, her brothers demanded 
that no food be wasted upon her. Their heartless 
proposal implies that the favorable social position of 
the peasant woman was indeed linked to her labors. 

After a year of excruciating pain, Alpaix was visited 
in a vision by the Virgin Mary, who cured her of her 
sores and smell. But Alpaix never recovered the use of 
her limbs and remained bedridden the rest of her life. 
She took no food apart from Communion, and died in 
1211. Before the eyes of this ignorant, invalid peasant 
girl, spectacular visions paraded; she was allowed to 
contemplate the splendid court of heaven and terrifying 
scenes of hell. Her powerful visions gave her a reputa- 
tion for sanctity, and pilgrims began to find their way to 
her bedside. Eventually a biographer arrived and pre- 
served for modern historians an account of a girl&apos;s hard 
childhood in the medieval countryside. 

Our medieval queen was also acquainted with holi- 
ness; she is Blanche of Castile, mother of Louis IX, 
or Saint Louis, king of France. She was bom on March 
4, 1 188, in Palencia, Spain, the third daughter of King 
Alphonso VII and the granddaughter, through her 
mother, of Eleanor of Aquitaine, who had been, in 
succession, queen of France and of England. Blanche 
was taken to France, where on May 23, 1200, not long 
after her twelfth birthday, she married the French heir 
apparent, who would later reign as Louis VIII (1223- 
1226). The marriage was not consummated until 1205, 
when Blanche was sixteen years old. The delay proba- 
bly indicates, not her own retarded menarche, but the 
youth of her husband, only a few months older than 
she. 

According to diflFering sources, Blanche&apos;s marriage, 
which ended when Louis died in 1226, gave her either 
eleven or twelve children. Blanche&apos;s deliveries in- 
cluded one set of twins, born dead in 1215. The spacing 
of her children suggests that Blanche initially tried to 
nurse her babies, although the king&apos;s disposition and his 
absences on royal business may also have affected the 
rhythms of her births. Thus, three and a half years 
elapsed between the birth of her second baby, Philip 
(born September 9, 1209), and her next delivery on 
January 26, 1213, when the dead twins were born. No 
period of nursing followed here, and her next child, the 
future Louis IX, was born only fifteen months later. 
Another lengthy interval of two and a half years 
followed until the next child, presumably because 
Louis was being nursed by his mother. Thereafter, 
births in rapid succession (five or six of them in the eight 
years from 1219 to 1227) suggest that Blanche — now 
maturing and occupied with children, household, and 
the aflFairs of state — no longer suckled her babies but 
instead relied on wet nurses. Several tracts on nursing 
have survived from the thirteenth century, and the 
assumption in all of them is that the nurse was not likely 
to be the child&apos;s mother. 

Blanche&apos;s career illustrates the powerful position

that women could still attain among Europe&apos;s high 
nobility in the thirteenth century. Of course, given the 
shortage of males, many noble girls did not marry. 
Most of those who remained single were forced into 
the religious life and all but excluded from lay society. 
A woman lucky enough to marry, often did so very 
young, produced babies in rapid succession, did not 
nurse her own children, and was likely to be relieved of 
the risks and burdens of childbearing by her husband&apos;s 
early death. Women frequently figured prominently 
as administrators and regents for their often absent, 
or short-lived, husbands and sons. At this elevated so- 
cial level, a widow with children was not likely to 
remarry; rather, she would dedicate herself to defend- 
ing and advancing her children&apos;s interest. 

Blanche herself was eflfectively regent of France 
during the minority of her son Louis (1226-1234), and 
regent again during his absence on the ill-fated Egyp- 
tian crusade (1252). She dominated her son and tyran- 
nized her daughter-in-law; she even tried to prevent 
the royal couple from chatting together before retiring 
for the night. Surviving her husband by twenty-eight 
years, Blanche died at the age of sixty-four in Novem- 
ber 1254. 

The woman who for us perhaps best represents the 
medieval bourgeoise is Ale^sandra, daughter of Bardo 
dei Bardi. She was born in Florence in 1414. We know 
a good deal about her because a Florentine book dealer 
named Vespasiano da Bisticci wrote the story of her 
life. His work, probably the oldest surviving biography 



of a European woman who was neither a princess nor 
a saint, tells us, for example, that Alessandra grew to 
be the tallest young woman in Florence, delighted am- 
bassadors by her grace in promenading and in dancing, 
learned to read, and could do excellent needlework. 
She was engaged to be married at age fourteen, but 
for unknown reasons, the marriage was delayed until 
1432, when she was eighteen years old. She was close 
to the average age of first marriage (17.8 years) for 
Florentine women in 1427. We can make refined esti- 
mates because in that year, a large census was taken 
of the city. Alessandra&apos;s husband, Lorenzo, was the 
son of Palla di Nofri dei Strozzi, who in 1427 was Flor- 
ence&apos;s richest citizen. Then twenty-seven years old, 
Lorenzo was young by Florentine standards. The 
average age of first marriage for males in 1427 was 
29.9 years. As Lorenzo was the first-born son in Palla&apos;s 
family, he was probably permitted to marry somewhat 
earlier. His new wife quickly produced three children in 
four years — an indication that she was not nursing her 
own babies. 

Disasters then struck Alessandra&apos;s family. In 1434, 
her father, an opponent of the Medici family, was 
exiled. He was sixty-six years old at the time; Ales- 
sandra was twenty. This long generational distance of 
forty-six years between father and child seems typical 
of Florentine households. Alessandra&apos;s unmarried sis- 
ters, left without dowries, were desperate. &quot;What will 
become of us?&quot; they protested to their departing father. 
&quot;In whose care will you leave us?&quot; Amid the continu-

r-^ 



ing tumult of Florentine politics, Alessandra&apos;s husband, 
Lorenzo, was similarly exiled in 1438, freeing her, at the 
age of twenty-four, of the risk of further pregnancies. 
In 1427, the average age of mothers at the birth of their 
middle children was twenty-six, the fathers&apos; average 
age was forty. 

Lorenzo eked out a living as a tutor in the town of 
Gubbio, but in 1451 he was assassinated by a dis- 
gruntled student. He was forty-six at the time. Ales- 
sandra, now widowed, had to raise her children alone. 
Her biographer presents her as a model of dedication 
and sober deportment for young widows, of whom 
there were many in Florentine society. He mentions 
one other, Caterina degli Alberti, who was married at 
fifteen, bore two children over the next twenty-three 
months, lost her husband, and remained a widow for 
the following sixty years. Alessandra herself remained 
a widow for seventeen years, and died in 1468, at the 
age of fifty-four. 

The bourgeois woman, like the lady of the landed 
nobility, was very young at first marriage, and her 
groom was even older than among the nobles. She, 
too, bore her babies in rapid succession, did not 
herself nurse them, and through the death of her older 
husband, was more likely than the noblewoman to be 
free of the dangers of continual pregnancies. As a child 
bride married to a mature man, she probably had little 
influence on her husband and his generation. But as 
a young mother destined to have intimate and usually 
extended contact with her children, she could be a 



respected and influential figure for the young. Married 
women occupied a strategic position. As intermediar- 
ies between the distant generations of fathers and 
their children, they could readily shape the tastes and 
values of the young and thus profoundly influence the 
culture of the city. And widowhood seems to have 
suited women well. In Florence in 1427, more than half 
the adult population of women were widows. 

Both the biological and social experiences of women 
changed substantially during the long medieval cen- 
turies. In the overwhelmingly rural world of the early 
Middle Ages, women enjoyed a high social value and 
entered marriage under favorable terms. But the bases 
of their preferment seem to have been the taxing physi- 
ical labor they performed and the substantial contribu- 
tion they made to the peasant household. With the 
growth and transformation of the medieval economy — 
and in particular the rise of towns from the twelfth cen- 
tury on — women&apos;s participation in the domestic 
economy grew restricted. Daughters no longer made a 
father rich and the terms under which they entered 
marriage turned against them. But this partial exemp- 
tion of women from hard labor conferred some bene- 
fits: &quot;they work less,&quot; observed Albertus Magnus, 
&quot;and for that reason are not so much consumed.&quot; 
Women in modern Western history still enjoy some of 
the advantages and bear some of the penalties be- 
queathed to them by medieval society. We have yet to 
see what will happen to these advantages and penal- 
ties, in our own, rapidly changing times. D

Kites of 

Santiago Sacatepequez 



by Kenneth W. Smith 
photographs by Hans Namuth 






Held in a cemetery, this 
Guatemalan festival 
celebrates the living, 
not the dead. 



In November, strong winds 
sweep over the mountainside ceme- 
tery of Santiago Sacatepequez, a 
Maya community in Guatemala. 
Most days it is a lonely place, 
empty of all but crosses, tall weeds, 
and mausoleums. But on All Saints&apos; 
Day, November 1, the access road 
from town is jammed with cars as 
thousands of tourists, together with 
most of Santiago&apos;s residents, gather 
at the burial ground. At the ceme- 
tery entrance, vendors hawk the 
typical holiday foods — sweet rolls, 
sliced fruits, peanuts, and juices. 
Inside this sacred spot, the tourists 
cluster near the entrance, but the 
local people break up into family 
groups to eat, gossip, and eye the 
strangers — the men remaining on 
the periphery, drawn together as 
much by camaraderie as by the 
presence of aguardiente, a 90 proof 
moonshine made of wheat bran. 

Spectators and participants have 
gathered to witness an annual event 
unique in Guatemala, and perhaps 
the world, the flying of some thirty 
to thirty-five spectacular kites, each 
of which is ten to twenty feet in 
diameter. The kites rise in the wind 



— brilliant kaleidoscopes of colored 
tissue paper stretched taut over 
bamboo frames. 

To fly a kite with a diameter 
greater than twelve feet, four to six 
young men are required. Once a 
kite is airborne, they strain on the 
rope, give it slack, and then pull 
again, hoping for thermals that will 
lift the kite higher and higher in the 
air. With steady winds, each team 
of young men may keep a kite aloft 
for an hour or two before bringing 
it back to the ground. If the group 
succeeds in landing the kite without 
impaling it on one of the tombstone 
crosses, snagging it in a tree, or col- 
liding with another kite, it will be 
flown again and again until a mishap 
occurs or a tourist offers to buy it, 
perhaps for as much as $200. But 
accidents are frequent and by the 
end of the day, the somber cypress 
trees surrounding the graveyard are 
festooned with the shredded re- 
mains of unfortunate kites. By 
nightfall, the wind dies and the 
crowds disperse — the tourists to 
their homes or hotels in Guatemala 
City and the locals to the town 
where they continue their celebra- 
tions. The crowds converge again 
the following day — All Souls&apos; Day 
— to see the flying of the remaining 
kites. 

The first day of this worldwide, 
two-day Catholic celebration com- 
memorates the saints in heaven. 



69 




On All Saints&apos; Day, Santiago&apos;s 

living invite their ancestors&apos; 

spirits into their houses by 

placing marigolds over 

doorways and windows. 



and the second, the dead in purga- 
tory. As it is practiced in San- 
tiago, however, the ritual has little 
to do with heaven&apos;s saints and is 
focused almost exclusively on the 
underworld&apos;s dead, the ancestors of 
Santiago. Many of Santiago&apos;s 
people believe that at sunrise on 
November 1 , God releases the dead 
from the underworld and allows 
their spirits to visit the site of their 
previous life for twenty-four hours. 
This is a dangerous time for the 
living, for if the spirits feel they have 
not been graciously received by 
their families they may inflict crop 
failure, illness, accidents, or other 
woes upon their disrespectful pro- 
geny. 

Prudent families therefore rise 
with the sun on November 1, scat- 
ter marigold petals around their 
doorways, and place bouquets of 
marigolds above every door and 
window. These are signs to the 
spirits that they have not been for- 



gotten and that they are welcome to 
enter the homes of their descend- 
ants. Families also place marigolds 
on the household shrine, along with 
offerings of liquor, bread, water, 
fruit, a corn drink, and candles. 

Subsequently, each family makes 
an early morning visit to the ceme- 
tery and adorns the sunbaked 
earthen mounds of their ancestors&apos; 
graves with marigolds and cypress 
wreaths. This visit is always a poig- 
nant moment, for Santiago, like 
much of rural Central America, has 
an extremely high rate of infant 
mortality. Testimony to the para- 
sites, gastrointestinal diseases, mal- 
nutrition, and other illnesses that 
kill one-third of the children before 
they are five years old is provided 
by the tiny mounds that dot the 
graveyard. After decorating the 
resting places of their kin, each 
family prays. Reminiscing quietly, 
parents linger at their children&apos;s 
graves. Before returning home, 
they may set vigil candles and offer- 
ings of food near the mounds. In 
the afternoon, they return again to 
the cemetery, where by now 
throngs of tourists have gathered to 
watch the kite flying. 

The association of the sacred 
days, with their emphasis on death, 
and the kite flying has led observers 
to see religious significance in this 



secular activity. Guatemalan jour- 
nalists who annually cover the fes- 
tival assert in their stories and 
broadcasts that the flying of the 
kites is an effort to communicate 
with the dead, to drive malevolent 
spirits from the cemetery, or to 
carry messages to heaven. The 
tourists who come to Santiago are 
satisfied with this explanation be- 
cause it fits with their ethnocentric 
notion that the Maya peasant is 
superstitious and ignorant. How- 
ever, during the four years that I 
lived in Santiago, I never came 
across this interpretation from the 
people who actually built and flew 
the kites. Some of them laughed in 
response to my questioning and 
said that they had heard such 
stories only from tourists. 

The flying of small kites on All 
Saints&apos; Day has been traditional in 
Santiago, as well as in other Guate- 
malan and Mexican communities, 
since before the turn of the century. 
Before the 1940s, the custom in 
Santiago was limited to eighteen- 
inch kites flown by young boys. 
Use of the larger kites, which are 
found only in Santiago, originated 
about thirty-five years ago when 
three young men built a circular 
kite four feet in diameter. This kite 
attracted such attention that the 
following year, other youths formed 
teams to construct kites of the same 
size and larger. By the late 1940s, 
kites twelve to sixteen feet in diam- 
eter were common. To date, the 
largest kite constructed was 
twenty-eight feet in diameter, but it 
proved structurally unsound and 
collapsed of its own weight. 

This elaboration of a traditional 
custom is not itself to be explained 
as a historical accident. Kite flying 
is a prerogative of bachelorhood 
and may well be connected to the 
community&apos;s courtship customs. 
This link between kites and court- 
ing arises from the Victorian stand- 
ards imposed on Santiago&apos;s women. 



While women mourn their 

dead, the young bachelors of 

the village prepare to fly 

their huge, colorful kites.

An unmarried woman must be 
circumspect in her public behavior 
if she is not to be the object of sala- 
cious gossip. Ordinarily, she leaves 
her house only to go to market, 
attend mass, fetch water, wash 
clothes, and run family errands. 
Since the participation of women 
in all other festivals is confined to 
the church and the home, this festi- 
val is the only occasion when large 
numbers of Santiago women can 
converse anci drink in public for 
hours at a time. Because the tight 
reins on customary behavior are 
relaxed only during these two days. 
All Saints&apos; Day obviously has spe- 
cial implications for courtship. 

Any other time of the year, the 
only place young men and women 
can meet and socialize is in the 
street. These meetings usually take 
place at dawn before the men go to 
the fields or at dusk after they have 
returned. At these times of day, 
marriageable women invent numer- 
ous excuses to run errands, while 
solitary young men loiter self- 
consciously on street corners. Each 
hopes that his favorite woman will 
come out of her house and provide 
him with the chance to make a 
hurried, flowery speech that he has 
rehearsed in the fields. 

Given their limited opportunities 
to become acquainted with each 
other, young people have to rely on 
impressions created by formal 
speeches, verbal jibes, flashy cloth- 
ing, and, in the case of males, phys- 
ical strength. To impress a girl- 
friend, a suitor will often return 
from the fields with a huge load on 
his back and stagger through town 
in the vicinity of her house. 

Thus All Saints&apos; Day is a special 
time of the year when all the local 
suitors have the chance to impress 
Santiago&apos;s single women with their 
unique skills. Their colorful kites 
serve as whimsical advertisements 
to women of marriageable age. 



Pictures of a Santiago man 
and woman — and a welcome 
to tourists — decorate a 
kite about to he launched 
by its builders. 



Constructing a kite that will 
evoke public admiration and reflect 
well on the builders demands time, 
cooperation, skill, and money. 
Nearly every kite in Santiago is 
jointly constructed by a group of 
four to eight men. Five to seven 
weeks before All Saints&apos; Day, each 
group begins construction, which 
occurs at night after completion of 
the day&apos;s labor. The work sessions 
are leisurely affairs, the tedious and 
monotonous cutting and pasting 
lightened by competitive banter 
among the builders. The kite&apos;s size 
and colors are determined by con- 
sensus. 

A few simple materials are used 
to build the kite — sheets of colored 
tissue paper, cornstarch for paste, 
scissors, rope, felt-tipped pens, 
bamboo poles, and old clothing for 
the tail. The money expended for 
these materials, about $30, repre- 
sents a considerable financial out- 
lay, almost a month&apos;s salary, when 
measured against the earning power 
of the typical Guatemalan peasant. 
This is undoubtedly one reason 
why kites are made by groups 
rather than by individuals. 

An eighteen-inch circle of tissue 
paper serves as the kite&apos;s founda- 
tion. From this center, concentric 
rows of tissue-paper triangles and 
squares are pasted on each other, 
each row increasing the kite&apos;s diam- 
eter. With the fifth or sixth row, the 
kite is too large to be stretched out 
flat on the floor of the work space 
and must be doubled over so work 
can continue. After the final row is 
pasted on, the edge is folded back 
over a rope to create a reinforced 
border strong enough to hold the 
bamboo poles that converge, like 
spokes of a wheel, at the kite&apos;s 
center. 

The last steps in the building 
process include the pasting of 
streamers along the kite&apos;s edge and 
the addition of graphic symbols on 
its face. The use of graphics is a 
very recent innovation. Prior to the 
1960s, kites were decorated solely 
with triangles and squares. Today, 
most kites carry a motif or design. 
Perhaps the most common is the 
figure of a woman, wearing Santi- 
ago&apos;s traditional blouse and skirt 
and standing alone or with a San- 
tiago man attired in an army uni- 



form. Sometimes these figures 
cover three-fourths of the surface 
of the kite. Other popular symbols 
make up a highly incongruous list — 
roses, black widow spiders, rabbits, 
weapons, rockets, wrestlers, mon- 
keys, scorpions, tigers, and Teciln 
Uman (a Maya military hero). 

If there were any validity to the 
claim that thp kites serve to com- 
municate with the spirits, we would 
expect to see that theme expressed 
in the symbols. But such a mes- 
sage is not evident in the motifs of 
Santiago&apos;s kites. Rather, these mo- 
tifs reflect a preoccupation with 
heterosexuality, fertility, and mas- 
culine power. Sexuality and fertility 
are embedded in the folklore of the 
monkey, rabbit, rose, dove, black 
widow spider, and scorpion. Mon- 
keys are thought to be lascivious 
and sexually uncontrollable ani- 
mals and, like rabbits, are reputed 
to be extremely prolific. Roses are 
an integral part of the wedding 
feast. The dove represents love, 
soul, and the heart. The black 
widow spider and scorpion are in- 
directly linked to fertility because 
the folk antidote for their venom is 
the ingestion of a pregnant wo- 
man&apos;s excrement. The depiction on 
a kite of a Santiago woman and a 
soldier illustrates the preference the 
townswomen are said to have for 
suitors with military experience. 
Many of the other symbols — eagles, 
tigers, wrestlers, armaments — rep- 
resent masculinity. 

These elaborate kites are mostly 
a male courtship stratagem for win- 
ning the attention of marriageable 
women in Santiago&apos;s prudish so- 
ciety. As the flying of large, ornate 
kites is by no means an old custom, 
the probability that the event has a 
pronounced religious significance 
or is an effort to communicate with 
the dead is not likely. Indeed, a 
short time ago, kite flying itself was 
an insignificant part of All Saints&apos; 
Day celebrations. Now it has vir- 
tually taken over the celebrations, 
attracting spectators from far and 
wide. Thus, the tissue paper sym- 
bolism of the kites is probably more 
an affirmation of life and procrea- 
tion than it is a message to the dead. 
Whether kites have any similar 
function in our own culture is a 
rather different question. D

The Shark&apos;s Sixth Sense 

by Adrianus J. Kalmijn and Kenneth Jon Rose 



In addition to the usual 
complement of sense 
receptors, sharks have a 
special sensory capability 
that humans lack 



Three hundred million years ago, 
long before dinosaurs walked the 
earth, sharks were present. To- 
day, many other animals are long 
extinct, but sharks remain abundant 
and have hardly changed. They are 
not just remnants of some bygone 
era but are well adapted to our 
modern oceans. In part, their adap- 
tation may result from being en- 
dowed with an extraordinary sense 
that is among the most remarkable 
in the animal kingdom — sharks can 
find their prey and orient them- 
selves in the open sea by the de- 
tection of electric fields. 

More than forty years ago, Sven 
Dijkgraaf, a sensory biologist work- 
ing at the University of Utrecht 
in the Netherlands, began to 
suspect that sharks might have 
electrical sensitivity. His first 
clue came in 1934 when he noticed 
that in experiments with small, 
blindfolded sharks, they reacted to 
a rusty steel wire. When the wire 
was brought within approximately 
one foot of a shark&apos;s head, the fish 
would suddenly turn away. To 
establish whether sharks would 
react in a similar manner to a non- 
metallic object, Dijkgraaf repeated 
the procedure with a glass rod. 
The sharks ignored it until the rod 
actually touched their skin. Only 
then did they move rapidly away. 

The sharks&apos; reactions seemed 
to duplicate the experimental re- 
sults Dijkgraaf had read about in 
a paper published in 1917 by two 
Harvard University scientists spe- 



cializing in the sense organs of 
fish. Working with the common 
brown bullhead, a species of fresh- 
water catfish, the Harvard re- 
searchers had tested the response 
of blindfolded fish to metallic and 
nonmetallic objects. The catfish 
reacted then as Dijkgraaf s sharks 
did seventeen years later, respond- 
ing to the metallic rod when it came 
within a range of one to two inches 
and to the nonmetallic rod only on 
contact. In subsequent experi- 
ments, the two scientists showed 
that the reactions of the catfish 
were not due to movements of the 
hand-held metallic rods or to odor 
particles emanating from them, but 
were the result of electrical cur- 
rents given off by the metal ob- 
jects upon contact with water. Be- 
cause of the similarity of his re- 
sults to the Harvard studies, Dijk- 
graaf assumed that his small sharks 
were responding to the electric 
fields produced in the water by the 
rusty wire. 

In 1951, long after these early 
observations, a British sensory 
biologist named Lissmann studied 
those species of tropical fish of the 
Amazon and the Nile that have spe- 
cial organs that generate electric 
fields in their environments. He was 
less concerned with animals, such 
as electric eels and electric rays, 
that produce strong electrical dis- 
charges in order to stun their prey, 
than with species that create much 
weaker fields that are too feeble 
to be harmful either to their natural 
prey or to other animals. 

Lissmann found that many South 
American knifefish and weakly 
electric fish from the African con- 
tinent emit pulsed discharges con- 
tinuously throughout their lives. To 
explain the function of these fields.

he suggested that these fish probe 
their environs electrically. That 
is, they monitor their own fields 
and are able to detect nearby ob- 
jects through the distortions those 
objects cause in the electric fields 
the fish themselves generate. Liss- 
mann proposed that weakly electric 
fish such as the knifefish evolved 
from what he called a preelectric 
fish, meaning a primitive one lack- 
ing electricity-generating organs but 
possessing receptors sensitive to 
electric fields. Today, the concept 
of a hypothetical preelectric fish is 
quite believable, for we know that 
catfish and sharks are acutely sen- 
sitive to weak electric fields but 
lack the organs to create their own 
electrical milieu. 

Just how sensitive sharks are 
to weak electric fields has been 
demonstrated experimentally by 
Kalmijn. He found that within the 
frequency range of direct current 
up to about 8 hertz, sharks re- 
spond to fields of voltage gradients 
as low as a hundred-millionth of a 
volt per centimeter. That would be 
equivalent to the field of a flashlight 
battery connected to electrodes 
spaced a thousand miles apart in 
the ocean. Little wonder that this 
sensitivity is the highest known in 
the animal kingdom. 

Sharks owe their astounding sen- 
sitivity to electric fields to several 
hundred sensory organs in the head 
region called the ampullae of Lo- 
renzini. These organs are marked 
by pores in the skin of the animal&apos;s 
snout, leading to jelly-filled ducts 
that terminate in sensory cells. 
Scientists have known about the 
ampullae of Lorenzini for years, 
but their function had long been a 
mystery. Early researchers be- 
lieved the organs to be sensitive to 
pressure, perhaps informing the 
shark about water depth. But that 
hypothesis appeared to be falla- 
cious and was soon rejected. Later, 
the ampullae were found to be tem- 
perature sensitive, but this did not 
seem to be their function either. 
Finally in 1963, Dijkgraaf and Kal- 
mijn, who were then working to- 
gether, established that sharks use 
the ampullae of Lorenzini to de- 
tect weak electric fields. This 
discovery solved the mystery. 

Once the function of the ampullae 



had been correctly identified, a 
basic question still remained: How 
do sharks make use of their elec- 
troreceptive capability? 

Virtually every living creature 
unintentionally produces in water 
an electrical field so weak it can 
only be detected by the most sen- 
sitive instruments. This results 
from differences in the electrical 
potential of the skin, which varies 
from one bodily area to another. 
Because water is an electric con- 
ductor, these differences produce 
electrical currents. For example, 
in the fish that sharks take as prey, 
the mucous membranes lining the 
mouth and the gill epithelia in the 
pharynx create direct-current 
fields that fluctuate with breathing 
movements. These currents flow 
through the water along field lines 
around the animal and, in accord- 
ance with the laws of physics, be- 
come rapidly weaker and weaker 
with increasing distance from the 
animal. Even so, the voltage gradi- 
ents emanating from small fish and 
wounded crabs, the main diet of 
many sharks, produce, within a 
distance of about one foot, bio- 
electric fields well within the 
shark&apos;s sensory capabilities. 

These findings suggested that 
sharks may use their electrical 
sensitivity to locate their prey. 
In 1971, Kalmijn began laboratory 
experiments designed to test that 
hypothesis. He put a small, live 
flounder in a sandy-bottomed tank 
containing hungry sharks of the 
•species Scyliorhiniis canicnla. 
Flounder and other small fish are 
part of the normal diet of these 
sharks. The flounder swam to the 
bottom of the tank and buried itself 
in the sand. Then Kalmijn added a 
few drops of odoriferous liquefied 
fish extract to the water to arouse 
the sharks. (Sharks will go without 
food for days until they are moti- 
vated and attracted by its smell.) 
Excited by the odor of the extract, 
the sharks began frantically search- 
ing for food. When they came close 
to the buried flounder, they made 
well-aimed dives at it, uncovered 
it from beneath the sand, and de- 
voured it voraciously. Since the 
flounder was hidden and the fish 
extract was diffused throughout 
the tank, it would appear that the 



sharks must have used cues other 
than visual and olfactory ones to 
find their prey. Might the sharks 
have located the flounder by inter- 
cepting its electric field? 

Sharks not only have a keen 
sense of smell but, like most aquatic 
animals, they are also sensitive to 
minute movements in the water. 
They perceive these movements 
with microscopically small organs 
in the skin along a visible band, 
called the lateral line, that runs the 
length of the body. It was possible, 
then, that the sharks might have 
sensed the hidden flounder either 
by its odor or its movements. The 
next step was to make sure that the 
sharks had not sensed the hidden 
flounder merely by these means. 

An enclosure consisting of agar, 
a stifl&quot;, opaque, gelatinous sub- 
stance, was put around the flounder. 
Agar is a pretty good barrier to 
odors and water movements but 
permits the transmission of elec- 
trical fields. Under these experi- 
mental conditions the sharks con- 
tinued to make well-aimed attacks 
at the buried flounder from the 
same distance arid in the same 
frenzied manner as if the prey were 
not shielded by the agar. To make 
sure that the thick agar roof of the 
enclosure was really effective in 
stopping any possible odor from 
leaking out, the live flounder was 
exchanged for cut pieces of fish, 
which produce an even stronger 
odor but do not generate electric 
fields. If odor were to come 
through, the sharks would find the 
bait within minutes. Instead they 
swam over the agar chamber with- 
out showing the slightest interest 
in the food. Obviously the agar was 
odorproof. 

To establish beyond a doubt that 
the electric sense was the means 
by which the sharks had located 
the live flounder, the agar enclosure 
was covered with a plastic wrap. 
This served as an insulator that 
would contain any electrical field 
within the enclosure but would not 
impede any water movements and 
vibrations that might have passed 
through the agar. Under these con- 
ditions, not a single shark noticed 
the live flounder. Electricity clearly 
seemed to be the medium the sharks 
were using to find their prey.

As a final proof Kalmijn simu- 
lated the presence of the flounder in 
the tank by passing a weak electri- 
cal current between two electrodes 
buried in the sand. The eflfect was 
dramatic. Motivated by a few drops 
of fish extract spread in the tank, 
the sharks charged at the electrodes 
as if they were the real prey. They 
dug away the sand and bit them. 
Responding again and again when 
swimming over the electrodes in 
their search for food, the sharks 
left the site only after finding it 
really contained none. So tempting 
was the artificially generated elec- 
tric field, that when a piece of odor- 
producing fish was placed a short 
distance from the electrodes, the 
sharks, although attracted by the 
odor, continued to dive at the 
electrodes rather than at the fish. 

The aforementioned electrical 
tests were all conducted in the 
laboratory where the scientist can 
control the environment. However, 
captive sharks in a tank might 
react differently from sharks in 
their natural habitat, where many 
stimuli aflFect them. The authors. 



Kalmijn and Rose, therefore de- 
cided to verify the laboratory data 
by testing wild specimens roam- 
ing freely in the ocean, even though 
that would present many problems. 

Human beings swimming in the 
sea produce their own electric 
fields, which sharks can detect 
from distances of up to about three 
feet. The fields produced by metals 
carried or worn on the body, scuba 
gear^for example, are usually even 
stronger. Thus, when studying 
sharks in their natural environment, 
we would have to get close enough 
to work with them without intro- 
ducing electric fields from our bod- 
ies or from metallic equipment we 
might use in the water. 

During the summer of 1976, while 
fishing off Cape Cod, Massachu- 
setts, we learned that the smooth 
dogfish shark, Miistelus canis, reg- 
ularly frequents the shallow, in- 
shore waters of Vineyard Sound on 
its nightly feeding excursions. This 
predatory shark is a warm-season 
visitor from equatorial waters, 
which arrives north in May and 
returns south in late October or 



The feeding behavior oj dogfish 
sharks was observed in the 
waters off Cape Cod. This 
specimen, like others, was first 
attracted by the odor offish 
extract released through an 
opening in a plastic tube marked 
by white tape. The sharks then 
zeroed in on a set of live electrodes 
marked by red tape. 



shortly thereafter. It is an active 
bottom hunter, preying on small 
local fish as well as on crustaceans 
and other invertebrates. The fe- 
males reach an average length of 
slightly over three feet, the males 
are somewhat smaller. We decided 
to use this shark for a series of 
nocturnal studies. 

To observe the animals&apos; feeding 
behavior, we had designed a non- 
metallic field setup that would 
reproduce our laboratory tests in 
a natural setting. Using a triangu- 
lar pulley system, we ran a length 



^ 



79 



of rope and plastic tubing from a 
rubber raft to a bare patch of sand 
seven feet below us and back to 
the raft. In the center of this sys- 
tem was an opening in the plastic 
tube through which we could re- 
lease fish extract as an odor source. 
One foot to each side of that open- 
ing were two sets of electrodes that 
would simulate a flounder&apos;s electri- 
cal field. 

After dispersing several chunks 
of herring (a readily available 
substitute for flounder) over the 
area, we began to pump small 
amounts of liquefied fish through 
the tubing to attract the sharks. 
At the same time, we turned on one 
set of electrodes, leaving the other 
off as a control. The otherwise 



dark area was illuminated with an 
insulated underwater light and we 
made our observations through a 
glass-bottomed viewing box. The 
glow in the water extended for 
some twenty feet around the raft 
but, surprisingly enough, seemed 
neither to attract nor scare the 
sharks. 

The first animal to appear on 
the scene was an American eel at- 
tracted by the odor of the herring 
extract. It wandered in and nibbled 
at the odor source, ignoring the 
electrodes. Soon a much larger 
animal swam into the cone of light. 
It was Mustelus canis. Within min- 
utes, another shark appeared. 
Together they circled the illu- 
minated area, apparently trying to 



locate the odor-releasing, presumed 
prey. 

Gradually the sharks began to 
zero in on the odor source but be- 
fore reaching it, they suddenly 
turned sharply toward the cur- 
rent-passing electrodes, biting and 
thrashing at that portion of the 
rope. The hole from which the 
fish extract was emanating and the 
control, or &quot;dead,&quot; electrodes 
were ignored. During several nights 
of research, hundreds of sharks 
were observed, and all of them re- 
sponded in this way. 

These observations clearly dem- 
onstrate that sharks, roaming freely 
in their natural habitat, can detect 
and take their prey by the exclusive 
use of their electric sense. The 




80 



ii 



experiments also show that within 
the range of one foot, electrical 
fields override the vague odor cues 
that initially arouse and attract 
sharks from a distance of many 
yards. The odor of a wounded prey 
lingers in the water long after the 
prey has gone. Therefore, when 
following an odor trail, sharks ulti- 
mately depend on a more localized 
and precise cue to spot their prey 
accurately and . to seize it with 
one quick move. 

In addition to using its electric 
sense to find its prey, it is possible 
that sharks rely on this sense for 
other purposes as well. As al- 
ready noted, the smooth dogfish 
sharks we observed in the waters 
off Cape Cod migrate southward 



during the winter. They must there- 
fore be endowed with a good sense 
of direction. Kalmijn believes that 
this sense may be electrical and 
may derive from the animals&apos; am- 
pullae of Lorenzini. 

When a fish swims through the 
earth&apos;s magnetic field, an electrical 
field is induced. The polarity of 
these induction fields depends on 
the direction in which the animal 
is moving. Reception of these fields 
through the ampullae of Lorenzini 
may thus indicate to the animals 
the compass direction they are 
following. Sharks, in a manner of 
speaking, may have an internal 
electromagnetic compass. 

The shark&apos;s ability to orient with 
respect to the earth&apos;s magnetic 



field has already been demonstrated 
in laboratory experiments. To 
verify these new findings and ex- 
tend our earlier observations, we 
are currently outfitting a mobile, 
nonmetallic working platform (a 
modified Boston Whaler) for com- 
parative studies of the electric 
sense not only of shallow-water, 
bottom-dwelling sharks but also 
of the open ocean, pelagic species 
of the Cape Cod area. 

Although sharks have recently 
received a spate of bad publicity, 
most species are, in fact, harmless 
to humans. It is our contention 
that the shark should be respected, 
if not admired, as an ancient sur- 
vivor possessing a special sense 
not acquired by most animals. D

Who Runs the Grand Canyon? 

by Fred B. Eiseman, Jr. 



The National Park Service 
has given commercial 
operators a near monopoly on 
boating the Colorado River 

When Congress established Yel- 
lowstone National Park in 1872, 
would-be visitors had a problem. 
The country&apos;s first national park 
was so difficult to reach that only 
the rich and the ultra-adventure- 
some could get to the fabled gey- 
sers, let alone stay there and absorb 
the scenery. Yosemite presented a 
similar problem. President Lincoln 
signed over Yosemite to the state of 
California in 1864, and it became a 
national park in 1890. It, too, was 
virtually inaccessible, and only a 
few hardy individuals could enjoy 
the scenes vividly described by 
John Muir. 

Congress set aside these areas of 
natural beauty for the public so 
that, as Senator Trumbull of Illinois 
put it, no member of the land-grab- 
bing fraternity could &quot;plant himself 
right across the only path that leads 
to these wonders and charge every 
man that passes along between the 



Maneuvering through the white

River as it rushes down the Grand 
Canyon, a boatman struggles with

gorges of these mountains a fee of a 
dollar or five dollars.&quot; Guided by 
the sad example of Europe&apos;s natural 
wonders, purchased by the rich for 
use as their personal playgrounds. 
Congress wanted to insure that the 
public could visit and enjoy these 
areas and, at the same time, pre- 
serve them for future generations. 

But how could the common man 
enjoy areas that he could not get to? 
The solution was to allow private 
industry to provide means of access 
to the new parks and accommoda- 
tions for visitors in and around 
them. In 1916 when an act of Con- 
gress created the National Park 
Service, its first director, Stephen 
Mather, encouraged tourist-ori- 
ented companies (or concessioners 
as they came to be called by the 
park service) to provide transporta- 
tion and lodging for park visitors. 

Operating with little competition, 
concessioners built restaurants, 
cabins, trails, souvenir shops, ho- 
tels, and all the other conveniences 
that tourists were willing to pay for. 
The Santa Fe Railroad at Grand 
Canyon; the Union Pacific at Zion, 
Bryce, and the North Rim of the 
Grand Canyon; and the Great 
Northern in Glacier were among 
the early concessioners, and their 
successful enterprises earned hand- 
some profits. Spelled out in num- 
bers of visitors over the years, the 
national parks were an enormous 
success. 

In 1965 Congress passed the 
Concessions Act, which made offi- 
cial the previously informal agree- 
ments between the National Park 
Service and the concessioners. 
This legislation recognized the 



existence of concessioners and 
stated that their operations were 
proper if their services were appro- 
priate and necessary. The rest of 
the act concerned itself with such 
matters as franchise fees, posses- 
sory interest in concessioner-fi- 
nanced facilities on national park 
land, contract details, and other 
technical matters. The assumption 
seemed to be that concessioners 
were doing a great job and that 
their presence was an asset; indeed, 
the sine qua non for the success of 
the national parks. 

But things have changed in the 
past decade. On the cover of the 
first issue of a newsletter put out by 
river-running enthusiasts in the 
Denver area is a picture of the 
Grand Canyon captioned, &quot;For 
Sale: Contact the National Park 
Service.&quot; The National Park Serv- 
ice (NPS) has been taken to court 
three times in the last two years 
over the matter of its concessioner 
policy. Environmentalists and wil- 
derness enthusiasts are up in arms; 
angry letters go regularly to con- 
gressmen. What has happened? 

Two things. First, along with 
their financial success, concession- 
ers have acquired political power. 
Many of them have millions of dol- 
lars invested in their national park 
operations and are naturally con- 
cerned that their profitable opera- 
tions continue. Some of the biggest 
concessions have been bought up 
by large conglomerates. For exam- 
ple, Amfac, a Hawaii-based giant, 
now owns tjie South Rim Grand 
Canyon concession; Music Corpo- 
ration of America (MCA) operates 
the facilities at Yosemite; and TWA 



83 



runs the show at the North Rim of 
the Grand Canyon. Along with size 
and money goes pohtical clout. And 
along with political clout goes influ- 
ence in the operations of the Na- 
tional Park Service. 

Congressional hearings were held 
in 1974 and 1975 to determine 
whether MCA&apos;s influence on the 
operational policies of Yosemite 
National Park had benefited MCA 
rather than Yosemite. Among other 
things, the NPS was criticized for 
allowing concessioners to provide 
visitor services that were surely not 
necessary and hardly appropriate, 
to use the language of the Conces- 



Only group leaders and boat 

handlers need experience in

trip is private or commercial.

sions Act. For example, one Con- 
gressman wondered why MCA 
maintained a Pitch &apos;N&apos; Putt golf 
course in Yosemite; whether 
MCA&apos;s thirteen liquor-selling stores 
within the park contributed to the 
enjoyment of the natural scene; 
whether the filming in Yosemite of a 
television series by Universal Stu- 
dios (a subsidiary of MCA) was in 
the interests of the park; whether 
the park service&apos;s permission for 
Universal to paint some of Yo- 
semite&apos;s cliffs was in accord with 
the mandate that the park service 
should conserve the scenery for the 
enjoyment of future generations; 
whether it was good policy to book 
conventions in Yosemite&apos;s hotels, 
thereby making hotel rooms un- 
available for other tourists; and 
whether holding a Winter Wine Fes- 
tival in Yosemite was an appropri- 
ate national park activity. 

The point is well stated in Na- 
tional Parks for the Future, issued 
by the Conservation Foundation in 
1972: 



There was a time when concessioners 
were clearly needed to provide basic 
services for accommodations, food, 
and the like. Without them, the parks 
could not have become a reality to so 
many citizens. Today, however, the 
concessioner has a disproportionate 
influence on planning and policy mak- 
ing for the national parks. His objective 
is to generate as much demand for the 
services he provides as is possible. This 
is thoroughly understandable but it too 
often brings the people to the parks for 
the wrong reason. The predictable re- 
sult is that the concessioner makes a 
case for further facilities to accommo- 
date a market that he — not the parks — 
has created. In some cases these new 
facilities are utterly inappropriate. 

So this is one factor in the new 
protest movement — the power and 
political clout of the concessioners. 
The second is the enormous boom 
in outdoor recreation. In the old 
days many of the national parks 
were diiRcult to reach, visitors had 
no place to stay when they arrived, 
and nothing to eat except what they 
brought. Hence the need for con- 







&apos;&quot;■■^ &quot;»&gt;&apos;*&quot;

cessioners. But today paved high- 
ways lead at least to the edges of all 
national parks. Comfortable back- 
packs, air mattresses, and hiking 
boots are within the financial grasp 
of millions of outdoor enthusiasts, 
and the desire to use them increases 
yearly. Light, tasty, easily prepared 
dehydrated foods are available at 
any sporting goods store, and it is 
simple for a backpacker to carry a 
week&apos;s supply of food, together 
with a tent, sleeping equipment, 
and lightweight clothing. 

In other words, there has been a 
huge increase in the ability of the 
general public to reach hitherto in- 
accessible public lands and in the 
desire of people to enjoy these 
areas without the services of pro- 
fessional guides. 

As a result, many public lands 
are becoming overused, and envi- 
ronmental degradation is on the 
increase. Thus, the NPS and other 
administrators of public lands have 
imposed limitations to protect these 
areas. These restrictions have also 
reduced the distractions that result 
from too many people in one place 
at one time. Let us call these areas 
&quot;rationed,&quot; that is, permits from 
the managing agency are required in 
order to visit the area in question. 
The inevitable result has been com- 
petition for permits to rationed 
lands between concessioners and 
the outdoor enthusiasts who want 
to go there on their own, and to 
whom the whole idea of a &quot;group 
tour&quot; in a wilderness area is re- 
pugnant. 

This is something that neither 
Congress nor such seminal thinkers 
as Muir and Olmsted, whose en- 
thusiasm led to the national park 
concept, ever contemplated. There 
is no legislation to guide the NPS in 
how to handle this competition. Ap- 
parently, nobody foresaw the enor- 
mous success of the idea of protect- 
ing wilderness lands or the desire 
and ability of millions to visit them. 

An important example of this 
conflict is the situation relating to 
white-water boating down the 
Colorado River in Grand Canyon 
National Park. Alarmed by envi- 
ronmental damage along the can- 
yon shores of the river, the Na- 
tional Park Service set a limit on 
use. Having no data on which to 
base an intelligent carrying-capacity 
limit, it was decided, pending fur- 
ther studies, to simply hold the line 
at the actual use of the river in 1972.

Attacti Lat&gt;el 



In recreation circles, use is often 
measured in terms of user-days, 
one user-day being one person in 
ttie area for one day. For example, 
if three people are in an area for six 
days, eighteen user-days are attrib- 
uted to them. 

The competition for user-days is 
between the twenty-one conces- 
sioners who have been granted 
NPS permits to run river trips and 
a large number of private, noncom- 
mercial river runners who prefer to 
organize their own expeditions. 
The interests of the two groups 
differ considerably. 

Customers of concessioners need 
not apply for permits. All they must 
do is pay; necessities and services 
are provided by the concessioner. 
Such trips resemble the package 
tours offered by travel agencies, 
with fixed itineraries and rigid pro- 
cedures. Most concessioners use 
inflatable rafts powered by out- 
board motors. 

The park service requires private 
river trips to be participatory; re- 
sponsibilities and activities must be 
shared and no individual is allowed 
to profit from the venture or write 
off the cost of the equipment. Pas- 
sengers are charged only for their 
food and for transportation to and 
from the river — an expenditure far 
less than the commercial rate. Sur- 
veys indicate that private river 
runners are generally younger and 
less affluent than commercial pas- 
sengers. Noncommercial trips have 
fewer people, last longer, are less 
structured, allow more time for 
visiting canyon attractions, and use 
oars in place of outboard motors. 

In 1972 the twenty-one conces- 
sioners who held river-running per- 
mits consumed 89,000 user-days, 
and the private river runners had 
7,600 user-days — breaking down to 
92 percent for concessioners and 8 
percent for private parties. In the 
years since then, there has been an 
ever increasing demand for private 
permits. The 7,600 user-days al- 
lotted to private river runners has 
proved utterly inadequate. As a 
result, the NPS has set up a yearly 
lottery for the private river runners. 
Applications for permits must be 
received at National Park Service 
headquarters several months before 
the river-running season begins. 
Applicants must be the leaders of 
the groups (of no more than fifteen 
people) that wish to make the trip. 
They must satisfy the NPS that 



they have had adequate experience, 
that their equipment is safe, and 
that they understand the various 
regulations imposed on canyon 
travel. (Because it is considered 
unsafe for a person to make the 
trip alone, applications for indi- 
vidual use are rejected.) On the ap- 
pointed day of the lottery, the 
names of qualified group leaders 
are drawn at random until the 7,600 
user-day limitation is reached. In 
1977, there were 515 applications 
for private permits by qualified 
group leaders. Thirty-seven were 
chosen, filling the 7,600 user-day 
allocation. 

If each of the 515 applicants rep- 
resents a group of twelve people, 
then 6,180 people wanted to run the 
river. Since an average private trip 
might last about two weeks, this 
demand would represent about 
86,520 user-days — nearly the entire 
commercial allotment of 89,000, 
and more than eleven times the 
7,600 user-day allotment for private 
parties. 

The private river runners are out- 
raged. Many have the experience 
and expertise, and all have the 
strong desire to make this &quot;sock- 
dolager&quot; of all white- water trips; 
yet in order to go, they would have 
to hire the services of a conces- 
sioner to do for them what they are 
perfectly capable of doing for them- 
selves. Many concessioners do not 
fill up their trips during the season. 
Last spring, one disappointed appli- 
cant for a private trip decided to 
apply for space on a commercial 
trip. He was able to secure space on 
five of the first six trips that he in- 
quired about. 

River-running enthusiasts point 
out that these are public lands, 
originally reserved by the govern- 
ment for the use, without cost, of 
the general public. They ask. How 
does the present situation differ 
from the situation that Congress 
sought to avoid when parks were 
originally established? A strict 
reading of the Concessions Act 
indicates that concessioner services 
are hardly necessary today because 
enough people want to run the river 
on their own as there are user-days 
allowed by the National Park Serv- 
ice. Environmentalists fear this is 
just the first example of what could 
become a trend. Perhaps some day 
private canoeing, private burro 
packing, private scuba diving, or&apos;

Meanwhile, the twenty-one con- 
cessioners enjoy a $4,5 million in- 
dustry, with the apparent blessing 
of the NPS, River running in Grand 
Canyon has become an &quot;in&quot; activ- 
ity. Lindblad has offered tours 
complete with ice cream and 
shrimp. Playboy has sent its bun- 
nies down the river to be photo- 
graphed cm natiirel. Meanwhile, 
private river runners keep their feet 
dry and sizzle with rage. 

The National Park Service justi- 
fies its position on the grounds of 
lack of information. Since 1972 the 
agency has had an expensive re- 
search program to explore the river 
environment that it is supposed to 
be controlling. It states, justifiably, 
that it can scarcely impose a realis- 
tic carrying capacity on river use 
without scientific knowledge of the 
effects of human use. NPS even 
sponsored a study of river runners 
to determine demographic differ- 
ences between those who go on 
motorized trips and those who pre- 
fer rowing trips; attitudes toward 
crowding, group contact and inter- 
action; and the characteristics of 
commercial and private users. The 
park service says that it cannot 
make a meaningful allocation be- 
tween commercial and private 
users until the results of such re- 
search have been analyzed. Private 
users retort that the river research 
has not addressed the conflict of 
private versus commercial use, 
other than the brief and fragmentary 
study of demographic and attitudi- 
nal differences between the two 
groups. 

The concessioners claim that the 
private river runners are elitists 
who do not represent the general 
public. They claim that their cus- 
tomers are really the public — brick- 
layers, taxi drivers, doctors, and 
little old ladies who have neither 
the desire nor expertise to under- 
take the hazardous trip on their 
own. Concessioners claim credit 
for the popularity of the river run 
because their regular, safe, sched- 
uled trips fit neatly into a vacation 
package, including pickup upon 
arrival at the airport and delivery to 
either Las Vegas or the airport at 
the end of the trip. 

Private boaters talk about the 



88 



repugnance of offering nature at a 
price and of reducing one of the 
few remaining pristine white-water 
areas to the status of a Disneyland 
ride. Environmentalists point out 
the values that accrue to people 
who must plan their own trips, read 
their own maps, be self-reliant, 
and, in short, cope with nature on 
its own terms, rather than just pre- 
sent a credit card to the local travel 
agent and then be entertained for 
the duration. 

A commercial passenger pays 
between fifty and sixty dollars for 
every day spent on the river. Now, 
admittedly, this is a bargain. Where 
in the United States could one get a 
room (in this case a sleeping bag), 
three meals a day, transportation, 
and a guide for that price? But it is 
still cheaper to go privately. If one 
has the boats and other equipment, 
as most river runners do, the cost of 
a do-it-yourself river trip would be 
about one-tenth that of a commer- 
cial trip. Private boaters also point 
out that a good many of the com- 
mercial river trips are whirlwind, 
&quot;gee whiz&quot; runs offourorfive days 
in which about 250 miles of canyon 
are negotiated. They claim that con- 
cessioners make the most money 
when they push the maximum num- 
ber of bodies down the river in as 
short a time as possible. 

The National Park Service has 
been in a bind since 1972. If the 
agency were to increase the private 
allotment of user-days, the conces- 
sioners would scream and bring 
pressure to bear in Washington. 
This happened six years ago, when 
the NPS, after holding public meet- 
ings, issued a plan whereby the 
total allotment for river use would 
be drastically reduced over a period 
of several years and motors would 
be eliminated in a four-year phase- 
out. Concessioners appealed to 
their friends in Congress and the 
plan was blocked. 

On the other hand, if the NPS 
increases the commercial allot- 
ment, as the concessioners de- 
mand, the private sector would 
object even more loudly than they 
do now. The result, predictably, is 
that the NPS has done nothing; 
figuring, apparently, if they do 
nothing, they can do no wrong. This 
situation has continued for six 
years. 

In January, however, the long- 
awaited draft of a Colorado River 
Management Plan and an environ-

mental impact statement were re- 
leased by the National Park Serv- 
ice. The plan only contains pro- 
posals, subject to changes after 
public hearings and comments. In- 
dications are that a minimum of two 
years is needed before the plan in 
final form can be implemented. 

The new proposals attempt to re- 
solve the conflict over who runs the 
river by increasing the total number 
of user-days by 100 percent, chang- 
ing the ratio from 92:8 to 70:30, and 
eliminating motorized trips by 1981. 



The National Park Service 
requires that private river 
trips be participatory. All group 
members are supposed to share 
the expenses, activities, and 
tasks of an excursion. 



In its attempt to please everyone, 
the agency will please no one. Pri- 
vate users will continue to object to 
any arbitrary allocation: conces- 
sioners will object to the phase-out 
of motor use and a smaller percent- 
age of the total number of user- 
days; environmentalists will be ap- 
palled by the doubling of visitor use. 
Fur will fly, and the plan will prob- 
ably meet the same fate as the 1972 
proposals when political pressures 
are again applied. 

So, having exhausted their pa- 
tience, and with virtually no sup- 
port on the part of Congress, the 
private boatmen have taken various 
steps. The first of these was the 
organization in 1975 of the Wilder- 
ness Public Rights Fund by a group 
of outdoorsmen. WPRF petitioned 
the Department of the Interior to 
rectify the situation. Having failed 
in this quest, it filed suit against the 
National Park Service in Federal 













90 



«l 



District Court in San Francisco. 
The essence of this suit was that 
existing laws indicated that private 
recreationists have priority of right 
to use public lands, and that they 
should be given preference to per- 
mits in areas where use is rationed. 
The case was decided against 
WPRF, and they have appealed. 

A second lawsuit was filed by 
four river runners in Arizona. Their 
thesis was that any allocation be- 
tween private and commercial per- 
mits is illegal because it exceeds the 
authority of the Secretary of the 
Interior under the Organic Act that 
established the National Park Serv- 
ice in 1916. The suit further alleges 
that the decision of the NFS to limit 
use of the river to the 1972 level 
violated the Administrative Proce- 
dures Act because it was not sub- 
jected to public hearings and was 
not published in the Federal Regis- 
ter. And, finally, the plaintiffs

THE 

1978 

IVATURAL 

HISTORY 

PHOTOGRAPHIC 

COMPETITION 



This year, the Grand Prize of Natural History&apos;s photo- 
graphic competition will be two tickets for the American 
Museum of Natural History&apos;s Discovery Tour of Egypt. 
The three-week trip will include a two-day stop in London, 
followed by a leisurely cruise on the Nile from Cairo 
to Aswan, with an optional flight to Abu-Simbel. 

Besides the Grand Prize, the 1978 competition offers cash 
prizes totaling more than $3,000. The winning entries will 
be published in a special double issue of Natural History 
in August and will be exhibited at the American Museum of 
Natural History. 

The four categories for entries are broad enough to fit the 
interests of any photographer. They are: (1) The Natural 
World; (2) A Sequence of an Event in Nature; (3) Photo- 
micrography, including pictures with a scanning electron 
microscope; and (4) The Human Environment. First Prize 
in each category is $500. In addition, all entries are eligible 
for the following awards: Humor in Nature, $200; Urban 
Wildlife, $200; and ten Honorable Mentions at $100 each. 

The deadline is April 15, 1978. Please put your name and 
address on every entry and include a stamped, self-ad- 
dressed envelope — since we do want to return your pictures 
to you. 

To all, the best of luck!

stated that the ratio of use be- 
tween private and commercial per- 
mits violates the Fifth Amendment 
of the Constitution, which prohibits 
classification of citizens and differ- 
ent treatment of the several classes, 
as, for example, those who, by rea- 
son of wealth, can afford to hire a 
guide and those who cannot. This 
case was judged against the plain- 
tiffs and is now being appealed. 

The third suit was filed by the 
Sierra Club in September 1977. The 
basis of this suit is slightly different 
from the other two, which were 
based on legal, nonenvironmental 
grounds. The Club, on behalf of 
Grand Canyon National Park, is 
suing the NPS because the latter 
renewed the permits of all of the 
concessioners when they expired at 
the end of 1976, even though the 
service&apos;s own research indicated 
that environmental damage was 
being done by people running the 
river. The suit states that the re- 
quirement of the Organic Act is that 
the park service protect its lands 
undamaged for the enjoyment of 
future generations. No action has 
yet occurred on this lawsuit. 

So the situation stands. The Na- 
tional Park Service has interpreted 
its two legal victories as a broad 
mandate to allocate land use be- 
tween the private and commercial 
sectors. The plaintiffs hope that 
more scholarly thinking by Courts 
of Appeal will reverse lower court 
decisions and interpret the law 
according to their point of view. 
Private river runners have planned 
civil disobedience protest trips, but 
these have not come about because 
none of the media thought the cause 
interesting enough to cover. River- 
running groups, such as the one 
whose newsletter sarcastically 
offers the Grand Canyon for sale, 
urge their members to write to their 
congressmen. But few influential 
congressmen pay any heed to the 
relatively unorganized ranks of the 
private boaters. The concessioners 
are organized. Their passenger lists 
can produce thousands of identical 
messages to senators and repre- 
sentatives, singing the praises of 
the commercial services. The pri- 
vate boaters are a proud and inde- 
pendent lot who really don&apos;t care 
much for organizations, dues, and 
legislation. 

Meanwhile, the NPS goes its 
way, sniffing the bureaucratic 
winds and bending in the direction 



\- 



of the most powerful ones. Private 
recreationists fear for their future 
right to enjoy public lands on terms 
compatible with their own souls, 
and concessioners plump for further 
rights and privileges. 

The four Arizona plaintiffs, and 
others, have urged the adoption of a 
plan that would provide each person 
desiring a river-running permit an 
equal opportunity of receiving one. 
Under this plan everyone, be he or 
she a private or commercial pas- 
senger, would apply for a permit. 
These would be allocated by lottery 
up to the limit imposed on the 
river&apos;s use. And the winners would 
then be free to go by whatever 
means they wished. 

Objections have been raised to 
this method by the concessioners 
on the grounds that they would 
have no idea how many passengers 
to plan for during a river running 
season; consequently they would 
be forced out of business. Private 
people counter with the idea that 
there are too many concessioner 
companies as it is, and that having 
twenty-one river-running com- 
panies is like having twenty-one 
telephone companies that offer the 
same service. Concessioners point 
out that there is at least some differ- 
ence in their services because the 
nature and length of their trips and 
the types of boats they use differ. 
Private boaters object to the plan 
on the grounds that it is open to 
cheating, by both sides, inasmuch 
as one&apos;s chances for winning in the 
lottery would be enhanced by filing 
multiple applications or applying 
under false names or the names of 
friends who, if chosen, would yield 
up their places. 

Another proposal calls for 
amending»the Concessions Act in 
such a way as to specify that there 
must be no allocation between pri- 
vate and commercial use of any 
rationed (that is, permit-requiring) 
public lands under National Park 
Service jurisdiction. A good deal of 
political objection could be ex- 
pected if this were adopted. 

A satisfactory solution to the 
problem must involve the protec- 
tion of the canyon and the rights of 
those who use it. But such a solu- 
tion will never be reached if the 
National Park Service abdicates its 
role of leadership and education 
and continues to behave as if the 
opinions of concessioners reflect 
the opinions of the public. D

&quot;Nature tour&quot; has a special meaning 
when you travel with the only professional 
travel company specializing exclusively in 
nature tours. 

Questers&apos; approach in planning World- 
wide Nature Tours is to provide you with 
the broadest possible opportunity of ex- 
periencing for yourself the natural history 
and culture of each area we explore. With 
the leadership of an accompanying 
naturalist, we search out the plants and 
animals, birds and flowers ... rain forests, 
mountains, and tundra . . . seashores, lakes, 
and swamps of the regions we visit. We also 
studv the architecture, archaeology, 
museum collections, temples, and customs 
of the people. 

Varying in length from 4 to 36 days, Ques- 
ters Worldwide Nature Tours travel to vir- 
tually every part of the world. Groups are 
small, and early reservations are therefore 
suggested.

A Naturalist at Large 




Resisting Pollution 



We have no vaccine against 
it: our immune system 
evolved to stave off 
living creatures 

The human body&apos;s immune sys- 
tem, its prime defense mechanism, 
has evolved to a point of extraordi- 
nary sophistication. Its cells and 
secretions are capable of identify- 
ing, attacking, killing, and dispos- 
ing of such complex structures as 
bacteria, parasites, and malignant 
growths. It is prepared to recognize 
as foreign, proteins and carbohy- 
drates originating from an organism 
with a diflferent genetic makeup, 
whether human, animal, plant, or 
virus. Except in the case of identi- 
cal twins, it rejects organ trans- 
plants from other human beings. 
Organ transplants only became 
possible after we had learned how 
to suppress the immunological re- 
action with drugs and radiation. 
Transplant rejection, however, is 
still a common phenomenon. 

The immune system can effec- 
tively recognize threatening organ- 
isms or chemical compounds that 
it has never encountered before. In 
the past, biological aggression rep- 
resented a major threat to human 
well-being, but our evolutionary 
history has had handsome coopera- 
tion from scientific history. Our re- 
sistance to biological aggression 
has been immeasurably improved 
by better nutrition, improved living 
conditions, and advances in epi- 
demiological knowledge. Antibi- 
otics and vaccines now eifectively 
protect us against many diseases 
and viruses that once crippled or 
killed us, reducing the importance 
of biological aggression as a selec- 
tive mechanism. 

No sooner had we stabilized this 



balance in our favor, when our tech- 
nology shifted it by introducing 
new threats. Despite their extraor- 
dinary arsenals, our bodies seem 
ill-prepared for the twentieth cen- 
tury. They have difficulty fending 
off assaults from the legacy of the 
industrial revolution: smoke, radia- 
tion, food additives, polluted water, 
and industrial chemicals such as 
asbestos and vinyl chloride. 

Today, our bodies are e-xpected 
to ward off much greater quantities 
of pollutants in much purer form. 
These pollutants bypass not only 
the protective walls of the skin and 
mucosae but also the detoxification 
mechanisms of the liver and kid- 
neys. Some of the new organic 
chemicals that are being synthe- 
sized almost daily can cause can- 
cer, sterility, birth defects, damage 
to the nervous system, and respira- 
tory diseases such as emphysema. 
These poisons contaminate almost 
half of their victims in their places 
of work. Thus, if dye and rubber 
workers, coal and uranium miners, 
or textile and chemical workers de- 
velop cancer, these people are ill 
because their bodies cannot cope 
with their environments. 

Ironically, unlike living organ- 
isms, which are recognized and 
destroyed by the immune system, 
these industrial pollutants, which 
can overcome our natural defenses 
or actually damage them, are in- 
capable of reproducing themselves 
in our bodies. Pollutants are smaller n 
and simpler than proteins, carbohy- 
drates, and lipids, the major con- 
stituents of living matter. Proteins 
are made of chains containing hun- 
dreds of amino acids. Carbohy- 
drates result from the combination 
of many simple sugars. Lipids are 
made of several fatty acids with 
long chains. The new organic chem- 



94 



by Celso Bianco 



icals, however, are mostly hydro- 
carbon derivatives with short 
chains and benzene rings. Most of 
these rings contain halogens (fluo- 
rine, chlorine, bromine, and io- 
dine) and are rarely found in living 
matter. 

The human immune system can 
vanquish the highly complex flu 
virus, made of thousands of amino 
acids and nucleic acids. But we are 
susceptible to a simple chemical 
such as DDT, which is composed 
of only 14 carbons, 9 hydrogen and 
5 chlorine molecules. An impor- 
tant difference between flu virus 
and DDT is that the latter was not 
present in our environment until 
very recently, and consequently 
was not a selective pressure during 
the evolution of our immune sys- 
tem. Had we been exposed several 
million years ago to DDT and other 
recently synthesized chemicals, 
our cells might have developed 
means of breaking these substances 
into harmless byproducts. 

But the process of natural selec- 
tion took place in an environment 
: where the main threat to living or- 
ganisms came from other organ- 
isms. Physical and chemical con- 
jditions at a given site, such as the 
ocean floor or river waters, re- 
mained constant for long periods of 
time. Meanwhile, the area&apos;s popu- 
lation changed unceasingly. New 
arrivals continually appeared, 
bringing to the scene new tastes, 
properties, and abilities. Within the 
biological community, the survival 
of members already adapted to the 
physical milieu depended on the 
kind of relations they maintained 
with others. In the past, biological 
aggression — one creature against 
another — may well have predomi- 
nated over other forms of selective 
pressures. 



In order to survive, each organ- 
ism had to fix its own biological 
boundaries. To live, it had to take 
in beneficial elements such as food, 
oxygen, and water. But no poisons, 
no stranger organisms, could be 
allowed to trespass into an organ- 
ism&apos;s precisely structured bio- 
chemical self. At all times, each 
entity had to be able to discriminate 
between its own territory — its self 
— and its surroundings, or nonself. 
Our own line of demarcation be- 
tween self and nonself consists of 
the skin and the mucosae (the lining 
of the nose, lungs, mouth, and in- 
testinal tract). If individual organ- 
isms lacked this ability to define 
their own space, all forms living in 
a certain place could fuse into a 
huge blob, becoming indistinguish- 
able and entirely destroying the 
chances for a successful evolu- 
tionary process, which requires 
multiplicity and variability. 

Even the simplest life forms have 
developed alert and attack mecha- 
nisms that can accurately tell nutri- 
ents from enemies, allowing the 
former in and keeping the latter 
out. An amoeba, a unicellular ani- 
mal, is able to engulf several parti- 
cles found in its environment, but it 
will not ingest other amoebas. Rec- 
ognition structures on its exterior 
membrane enable this relatively 
primitive organism to avoid fusing 
with or eating its fellows. 

In higher animals, these discrimi- 
nating structures become much 
more organized and complex. The 
human immune system is made up 
of several blood serum proteins and 
cell types, including phagocytes, 
scavenger cells that resemble 
amoebas. All circulate throughout 
the body and fend off invading or- 
ganisms, the body&apos;s own dead cells, 
and some kinds of foreign matter. 




Authentic Indian 
Smoked Salmon! 

Cured over alderwood fires. 

Centuries ago, Pacific Northwest In- 
dians learned how to preserve fish by 
smokinji it for days over open fires. To- 
day, tlicy still harvest salmon from tradi- 
tional tribal fishing grounds and prepare 
it the same as their ancestors did. We feel 
very fortunate to have obtained a limited 
supply of this rare smoked salmon for you 
to try! 
Prepared by hand in a traditional way. 

.\fter the salmon is caught, skilled trib- 
al members clean and fillet each fish by 
hand. It&apos;s then smoked over alderwood 
fires. While still warm, the salmon is cut 
into thick chunks and carefully hand 
packed. Finally, the smoked salmon is 
vacuum sealed into 61/2 ounce si/e cans. 

.\fter tasting it yourself, you&apos;ll probably 
want to re-order more smoked salmon to 
give as a special gift to friends.

Their concerted action leads, in a 
successful immunological process, 
to the invader&apos;s destruction. 

The body&apos;s response to a com- 
monplace injury, such as a thorn 
prick, illustrates the immune sys- 
tem&apos;s beauty and complexity. A 
thorn (actually another organism&apos;s 
defense mechanism) could have 
wounded our earliest ancestors, 
gathering fruit in Africa, as easily 
as it could hurt a modern raspberry 
picker. (Russian biologist Elie 
Metchnikoif first discovered the 
immune system in the late nine- 
teenth century by using a thorn to 
prick a starfish.) The thorn punc- 
tures the defense barrier of the 
skin, allowing many microorgan- 
isms present in the environment 
to penetrate the body. The most 
common invaders are streptococci 
and staphylococci bacteria. Their 
entry triggers an immediate inflam- 
matory reaction. The sufferer feels 
pain and heat around the wound, 
which swells and reddens. Blood 
serum molecules react chemically 
with the invader and summon thou- 
sands of white blood cells into the 
lesion. Like the amoeba, polymor- 
phonuclear phagocytes recognize, 
engulf, and digest the invaders, or 
antigens. In the process, many 



A macrophage, or scavenger cell, 

has ingested a red blood cell, 

indicated by outline, and advances 

on other red blood cells that have 

been coated with antibody. 



phagocytes are killed by toxic sub- 
stances produced by the rapidly 
dividing bacteria. Dead cells, tissue 
debris, and bacteria form pus. 

In the second stage of an immu- 
nological reaction, another group 
of white cells known as B lympho- 
cytes migrates through the blood to 
the inflammation. On their exterior 
membranes, B lymphocytes carry 
antibody molecules that bind tightly 
to the antigen, as a lock fits around 
a key. Although each B lymphocyte 
carries a lock that will precisely fit 
one key, the vast population mov- 
ing through a normal human being 
can recognize at least one million 
different nonself antigens. Pro- 
grammed in DNA, these locks are 
passed from generation to genera- 
tion. We do not possess all these 
lymphocytes in great numbers at 
once, but if our system is con- 
fronted with an unfamiliar antigen, 
it will continue pulling out cells un- 
til it comes up with an effective 
antibody. 

When lymphocytes carrying the 
specific lock meet their correspond- 
ing antigen, they proliferate into 
daughter cells. This large, identical 
progeny starts secreting enormous 
amounts of the same antibody into 
the body&apos;s blood serum. These 
antibodies not only help combat the 
present infection but also remain 
effective in case the same invader 
appears again. This characteristic 
is what makes vaccination possible. 
Vaccine, an attenuated form of an 
antigen, induces protective anti- 
bodies, which remain in the blood 
ready to ward off higher doses of 
the invader.

V 



If the immune system must deal 
i with living cells larger than bac- 
I teria, it employs another group of 
lymphocytes, the T. In fact, B and 
T cells often cooperate. T lympho- 
cytes produce killer daughter cells 
that are largely responsible for de- 
stroying transplants and virus- 
infected cells. 
In the final stages of an inflam- 
, matory reaction, macrophages 
&apos; clear the way for new tissue 
growth. Macrophages are phago- 
cytic cells with lysosomes, small 
stomachs containing digestive en- 
i zymes that rid the body of its own 
1 damaged or dead cells. Macro- 
! phages also recognize and ingest 
I certain particles. 

Sometimes a biological invader is 
not cleared and the body becomes 
diseased, either because its immu- 
nological response is weak or be- 
cause the parasite (which like all 
living things is constantly evolving 
ways of surviving) has adapted it- 
self to avoid recognition or phago- 
cytic destruction. But when an 
immune reaction is successful, the 
body&apos;s battle is over within a few 
days. The foreign invaders have 
been killed, tissue damage has been 
repaired, and should the same bio- 
logical aggressor attack in the fu- 
ture, the body will be better pre- 
pared. If, however, the invader is a 
synthetic chemical such as DDT, 
the outcome is not so felicitous. To 
trigger the body&apos;s defenses, an in- 
vading molecule must be of a cer- 
tain minimum size. Much smaller 
than viruses or bacteria, DDT can 
slip past lymphocytes and macro- 
phages. It is not broken down by 
enzymes, and no antibody is 
formed against it. It is simply not 
recognized as an aggressor, as non- 
self. 
Because they are not broken 
j down, DDT and many other chemi- 
cals can enter the food chain. Be- 
sides their general toxic effect, cer- 
tain organic chemicals can directly 
attack the cells of the body&apos;s im- 
munological system. Hence they 
not only cause damage themselves 
but also interfere with immunologi- 
cal responses to other aggressors. 
Some chemicals that can work this 
way are dioxins, produced during 
the synthesis of preservatives and 
herbicides. Having no enzymes 
to break down dioxins, the body 
retains them for long periods. 

Some natural substances that 
phagocytic cells normally recog- 



nize can also cause disease when 
we are exposed to them in very 
large quantities. Lung macrophages 
can ingest some substances such as 
coal and silica but cannot degrade 
them. The scavenger cells die, and 
the lungs&apos; protective mechanisms 
— coughing and ciliary movements 
— sweep out small quantities. But 
industrial workers who breathe in 
excessive amounts of particulate 
matter can develop serious lung 
problems. 

Industrial pollutants constitute a 
selective pressure that we are phys- 
iologically unprepared to handle at 
present. Since some of these new 
materials affect our genetic ma- 
terial, they can cause mutations. 
Theoretically, over time, we could 
expect populations capable of re- 
sisting pollutants to appear within 
the human species. Unfortunately, 
there are inarguable objections to 
allowing nature to take its course. 
First, we do not want to deliber- 
ately bring deformed beings and 
monsters into the world; in any 
case, we have no guarantee that an 
immune population would indeed 
appear. If the pollutant is particu- 
larly strong or is present in great 
quantities, entire populations could 
be wiped out, leaving no resistant 
survivors — as has happened in 
some epidemics of smallpox, yel- 
low fever, and cholera. And sec- 
ond, evolution is a glacially slow 
process: a single change in an 
amino acid&apos;s position may easily 
take millions of years to become a 
species&apos; norm. Considering the rate 
at which new chemicals are being 
synthesized, we would be obliged 
to develop adaptive mechanisms in 
an impossibly short time. 

Evolution may provide an expla- 
nation for our inability to deal with 
pollutants, but it is not a feasible 
answer to their challenge. Rather 
than waiting for biological adapta- 
tion to a new environment, we must 
insure that the environment suits 
life. If we adapt the industrial rev- 
olution to life on earth, we can 
avoid a growing number of diseases 
caused by environmental factors. A 
preventive approach may be less 
spectacular, but our reward will be 
less disease and fewer deformities 
— in short, a better life.

Cajun Country 



Louisiana Cajuns/Cajuns De La 
LouisiANE, photographs by Turner 
Browne, text by William Mills. 
Louisiana State Universitv Press, 
$14.95; 101 pp., illus. 

The Louisiana Cajuns, a people 
whose ancestors first settled in 
southern Louisiana in the mid- 
eighteenth century, today inhabit 
the prairies and bayou country of 
the southwestern part of the state. 
Many of the Cajuns&apos; traditional cus- 
toms and much of their way of life 
remain well intact, and this book 
offers the reader a firsthand look at 
them. Although it is not apparent 
from its title, the book comprises a 
number of splendidly composed 
photographs by Turner Browne (a 
native of south Louisiana, now a 
professional photographer in Los 
Angeles), whose purpose was &quot;to 
get some good scenes on film be- 
fore they disappeared.&quot; The work 
contains, in addition, a lively intro- 
ductory essay by noted Louisiana 
poet William Mills, which provides 
background material for the photo- 
graphs. The text and photo captions 
are in both English and French, 
with the French texts rendered by 
James and Elisabeth Spohrer. The 
result is a fascinating volume that 
introduces the reader to the life, 
culture, land, and people of south 
Louisiana. 

The reader expecting to learn 
about the Cajuns in prose may be 
mildly disappointed, as Mills&apos;s in- 
troduction attempts only a brief 
resume of these people and their life 
ways. Yet his remarks seem more 
than adequate in providing a con- 
text in which to view Browne&apos;s 
photographs. Since the photo- 
graphs and captions actually make 
up the main body of the book, the 
latter can only be judged as a visual, 
pictorial contribution. Thus with 
Louisiana Cajuns. one finds neither 
an academic research monograph 
nor a journalistic photoessay, but 
rather a sensitive and searching

work of art that attempts to capture 
and preserve, through visual im- 
ages, what it means to be a Cajun. 

Turner Browne has clone his job 
well; his selection of photographs 
gives the reader an understanding 
of the unique social life and cultural 
customs of the Cajun people. Per- 
haps most distinctive among these 
customs is the Cajun penchant for 
the good times, captured in 
Browne&apos;s photographs of tradi- 
tional Mardi Gras celebrations still 
found in the rural villages of Church 
Point and Mamou. Similarly, the 
photos of Zydeco musician Clifton 
Chienier, performing before a wild, 
foot-stomping audience at the back- 
woods honky-tonk Jay&apos;s Lounge; 
or of Cajun accordionist Nathan 
Abshire dancing a little jig onstage 
before some 12,000 spectators at 
the first annual Acadian Music Fes- 
tival held in Lafayette in 1974; and 
of people dancing in the streets of 
Breaux Bridge at this little town&apos;s 
yearly Crawfish Festival — all give 
the feeling of the good time spirit 
for which the Cajuns are known. 
There are also some enjoyable pho- 
tographs of women competing in 
the annual muskrat-skinning con- 
test in Cameron&apos;s Fur and Wildlife 
Festival, the men&apos;s competition in 
the trap-setting contest, and the 
annual pirogue races held on Bayou 
Lafourche. 

Yet juxtaposed against this back- 
drop of merrymaking and revelry, 
Browne probes further to reveal the 
fundamental intensity and serious- 
ness of the Cajun people. His pho- 
tographs of the constant struggle to 
contain the treacherous floodwa- 
ters of Atchafalaya Swamp, which 
inundate roadways arid constantly 
threaten small rural towns and vil- 
lages; of the backbreaking work of 
a Cajun trapper pursuing valuable 
nutria pelts in the desolate marsh- 
lands of the Gulf of Mexico; or of 
men and women struggling with a 
three-hundred pound hog at an 
old-style, do-it-yourself country 
boucherie (&quot;butchery&quot;) tell of the 
unremitting toil that characterizes 
the Cajun way of life. Perhaps most 
revealing in this context is 
Browne&apos;s scene of a sizable cash 
deal between a Cajun trapper and 
his buyer, where the buyer admits 
that &quot;on a full day of buying I have 
to carry ten, twenty thousand dol- 
lars cash. ... I also carry two 
shotguns and a pistol.&quot; 

With his photos thus displayed. 



A wine worth 

discovering: The 

Christian Brothers 

California Claret. 

One of the most delight- 
ful red wines that we make at The 
Christian Brothers Napa Valley 
winery is our California Claret. 
This is a very dry wine with a 
pleasing clear red color as its name 
suggests. And, as with many of 
our wines, the name has a tradi- 
tional origin: it derives from the 




French word for clarity. In England 
claret is used as a name for the 
red wines of Bordeaux. 

However, our Claret is 
definitely a Califomian, and has 
a very contemporary taste and 
character all its own. And though 
it is one of our moderately priced 
table wines, we treat it with the 
same respect and care that goes 
into each of The Christian Brothers 
wines. Our Claret is made from 
our own selection of grapes, and 
after the wines are made, they are 
allowed to come to life in oak casks 
at their own leisurely pace before 
bottling. 

The econom- 
ical cost of our 
Claret will sur- 
prise you. I believe 
you will find it a 
good choice for 
daily use with cas- 
seroles, a roast, or a 
stew. It is available in the regular 
bottle and a new 1.5 liter metric 
magnum (50.7 fl. oz.) which we call 
our &quot;four-for-dinner&quot; bottle. It is 
a wine well worth discovering. If 
you would like to know more about 
our wines, you may write to me.

Browne shows how the unique 
natural environment of southwest- 
ern Louisiana — predominated as it 
is by vast expanses of water, 
swamps, marshlands, prairies, and 
geographic isolation — has de- 
manded a specific life style of its 
inhabitants, a life style not for those 
weak in heart or physical stamina, 
but one that requires strength, 
adaptability, and above all, a taste 
for adventure. Perhaps it is here 
that one finds the two sides that so 
vividly characterize the Cajuns&apos; 
traditional world view: The good 
times are always tempered by a 
serious, unfailing devotion to one&apos;s 
task, a cultural ethos undoubtedly 
influenced by the stern geography 



and climate of southern Louisiana. 
The cutting edge between work 
and play, between seriousness and 
good times, however, is probably 
best fused in the Cajun view of 
chance and the surreal. Games of 
chance abound in Cajun country, 
and Browne has provided a number 
of candid shots of sub rosa cock- 
fights and parallel quarter-horse 
racing in the rural areas; events, it 
might be pointed out, that scarcely 
enjoy the legal sanction of the state. 
In the same vein, Browne offers a 
number of thoughtful compositions 
of rural faith healers, fortune tell- 
ers, and even a woman practitioner 
of voodoo concocting a potion of 
salt, gunpowder, saifron, and dried

dog dung — undoubtedly to ward off 
some evil spirit, or gris-gris. Ai- 
tiiough plainly serious, the people 
in these photographs nonetheless 
seem placid, perhaps expressing a 
mindful awareness that games of 
chance and belief in the surreal pro- 
vide a means of dealing with uncer- 
tainty in more comprehensible 
terms. As Mills puts it: &quot;So [the 
Cajun] played games of chance and 
expressed ritualistically a cavalier 
disdain for hazard, somehow gain- 
ing a magic control over his fate.&quot; 
Finally, I think the book fulfills 
very well its primary goal of getting 
some &quot;good scenes on film before 
they disappeared.&quot; Yet I wonder if 
Browne is actually right about the 
inability of the Cajun people to 
withstand the leveling standardiza- 
tion of mass culture. The poise and 
sheer determination on the faces of 
his subjects; their effervescent en- 
thusiasm and love of life, displayed 
so brilliantly on film; and the tech- 
nologically untamable wilds of 
southern Louisiana&apos;s geography 
and climate suggest the Cajuns&apos; 
disappearance is no sure bet. Thus, 
more than any other photograph in 
the book, I think one in particular 
leaves Browne&apos;s prognosis in par- 
tial doubt, at least in my mind. This 
is the photo of Kenneth Richard, 
guitar in hand, sitting with his 
father, Felix, in the family room 
after Sunday dinner. Kenneth lis- 
tens intently to his father&apos;s old-time 
accordion, learning to play &quot;some 
of the almost forgotten music of his 
forefathers.&quot; No doubt Felix Rich- 
ard learned the music in much the 
same fashion, just as Kenneth will 
perhaps teach his own children 
someday. With this photograph, I 
think Browne himself tells us part 
of the reason why his prophecy 
may not prove correct. Neverthe- 
less, Browne has produced for us a 
compelling visual guide of the land 
and people of southern Louisiana. 
For those interested in a sensitive, 
truly authentic vision of the Cajuns 
of Louisiana, Browne&apos;s book offers 
a welcome clarity seldom achieved 
in works of this sort.

A Matter of Taste 



How to Cook a Snoek 



Recipes and food customs 
are true artifacts 
of a culture 



Miss Hildagonda Duckitt made 
her own soap from sheep&apos;s tallow. 
When hands on her farm In the 
Darling district of South Africa 
came down with jaundice, she 
steeped them a cup of dagga, or 
marijuana tea. For sore throats, the 
intrepid Hildagonda prescribed and 
herself prepared Hottentot fig 
gargle. She flourished about 1900 as 
a sort of Cape Colony Mrs. Beeton. 

Her two bestsellers — Hilda&apos;s 
Where is It? and Hilda&apos;s Diary of a 
Cape Housekeeper — record the 
whole delicious and polyglot range 
of the mixed, Creole cuisine that 
sprang up near Capetown in the 
nineteenth century. Nowadays, 
such Dutch-Malay specialties as 
sasaties (kebabs) and tameletjies 
(tangerine sweets) have, evidently, 
all but vanished from South African 
tables. Fortunately, Miss Duckitt 
could write, was published, and 
even reprinted in 1951. And so it 
was a matter of relative ease for 
Sheila Patterson to reconstruct the 
alimentary life of South Africa dur- 
ing colonial days. Other anthropol- 
ogists, examining cultures without 
written cookbooks, had to roll up 
their sleeves and cook with vil- 
lagers all over the world in order to 
gather contributions for Jessica 
Kuper&apos;s valuable new anthology. 
The Anthropologists&apos; Cookbook 
(Universe Books). 

Here is a book crammed with 
useful gleanings and nourishing in- 
sights into exotic cultures. Natu- 
rally, some of the foods will not 
appeal at all to American readers. 
Naomichi Ishige understands that 
roasted dog, even as prepared on 
Ponape in the Caroline Islands — in 
an earth oven, with breadfruit and 
pork — will horrify most of us. 
Ishige writes, however, that &quot;the 



dog did not taste as bad as its smell 
would have led one to believe . . . 
and, looked at through alien eyes, 
our attitudes [against eating dogs] 
can only seem to be a kind of fetish- 
ism.&quot; 

This is an extreme case, but it 
illustrates with particular clarity 
how food — and attitudes about 
food — separates one culture from 
another in ways that run far deeper 
than matters of taste, sensorially 
conceived. Claude Levi-Strauss, in 
an essay excerpted from L&apos;Origine 
des manieres de table (forthcoming 
soon in an English translation), re- 
calls that after the Normandy inva- 
sion of 1944, it became clear that 
&quot;American soldiers had a broader 
conception of the category of the 
rotten than the French; undef the 
impression that the Normandy 
cheese dairies stank of corpses, 
they sometimes destroyed the 
buildings.&quot; 

Professor Levi-Strauss is, of 
course, primarily interested in sym- 
bolically universal food customs 
and attitudes. Whether or not such 
universals do exist, and even if they 
do constitute, as Levi-Strauss as- 
serts, &quot;a culinary universe, which 
is a miniature reflection of the cos- 
mos,&quot; most of the information 
compiled for the Kuper anthology 
leads us firmly down to ground 
level. 

Isobel White gives an extraordi- 
narily vivid sense of her life among 
Australian aborigines in a detailed 
recipe for damper, a disk of bread 
baked in ash over wood coals. She 
begins, &quot;Retrieve your axe from 
whomever has borrowed it,&quot; and 
then describes building a campfire 
with local acacia pieces left over 
from woodworking. Step 2 starts, 
&quot;Find a large pan. This may be the 
hardest task of all. In a society 
unused to such items, there never 
seems any place to keep them in the 
native bough shelters. In any case 
no woman can refuse to lend hers to 
a neighbor or refuse to hand it to any

young child who wants it to maice 
play dampers of earth and water. 
Having found a pan and shaken off 
the sand or dirt put there by the 
child, put in some flour, some salt, 
and some baking powder (&apos;some&apos; 
means about 5 lb [2.5 kilos] flour, a 
couple of tbsp. baking powder . . . 
and the same of salt).&quot; Next, Ms. 
White discusses the problems of 
finding water or, for that matter, a 
bucket; of keeping children out of 
the flour; of remembering not to ask 
a man or boy to fetch water since 
water carrying is demeaning for 
males. Given these realities of 
aboriginal life, the actual mixing and 
kneading of a stiff dough into a large 
bicycle-size wheel two inches thick 
sounds relatively simple. Dogs, too, 
interfere. &quot;This anthropologist,&quot; re- 
marks Ms. White dolefully, &quot;once 
lost the whole of her supper while 
her back was turned for seconds.&quot; 
Not all anthropologists pursue 
fieldwork in such technologically 
primitive locations. But the thrust 
of anthropology toward what seems 
primitive by Western standards can 
push a researcher toward pre- 
modern survivals in more or less 
industrialized cultures. In contem- 
porary rural Spain, Susan Tax Free- 
man investigated the details of old- 
fashioned pig slaughter, called 
matanza. This was not a capricious 
enterprise; indeed, it yielded what 
seems to me the outstanding piece 
of research in the Kuper collection. 
Freeman was acute enough to see 
a cultural discontinuity between 
contemporary Spanish cities and 
farms in the specific area of pork 
cookery. No doubt there are many 
such gaps appearing in Spain&apos;s 
social fabric as the country be- 
latedly joins the rest of modern 
Europe and finally turns its back on 
the nineteenth century. But the 
matanza is an especially clever 
focus because it draws together ele- 
ments of preelectrical technology — 
dodges for dealing with an entire 
p&apos;lgenfamille and without refrigera-

tion — as well as providing urban 
cooks in Spain and elsewhere with 
information (largely isolated or lost 
from view) on how to cure hams 
without smoking, how to stuff the 
pungent chorizo sausage, and how 
to dry and preserve marinated pork 
ribs and loins. Many cultures have 
similar processes for meat preser- 
vation, but Spain developed its 
own, and it imparts a characteris- 
tic, Spanish country flavor to cer- 
tain dishes. This flavor is an artifact 
as surely as the Alhambra, and it 
should be conserved with as much 
care. 

It should be obvious, also, that 
recipes keep better than buildings, 
develop no dry rot, and do not 
crack or fade like a Velazquez. And 
anyone can prepare dried mountain 
ham (jainon serrano) at home since 
it does not require special smoking 
equipment. 

According to Freeman, you 
simply take a fresh leg of pork with 
the skin on, lay it on a bed of salt in 
a box or a basin with a hole for 
drainage, cover it with salt (coarse- 
grained, but not rock salt), and 
leave it uncovered in a cool, airy 
place for as many days as the leg&apos;s 



weight in kilograms. Then wash off 
the salt and press the leg under two 
cases of wine for five to twelve days 
(less pressing is needed if the condi- 
tions are especially dry). Coat the 
pressed ham with a paste of sweet 
paprika wetted with a small amount 
of vinegar. Hang on a meat hook for 
six months (the hole for the hook 
should be filled with ground black 
pepper and the knuckle should be 
generously coated with pepper to 
keep maggots away). (In areas 
where trichinosis is present, the 
meat should only be used in cooked 
dishes and never eaten raw.) 

All this was done by Spanish 
country folk with a minimum of 
ceremony. For elaborate food 
ritual, one may turn to Laos, where 
Alan Davidson, quoting F.H. 
Giles&apos;s account of the ceremonies 
performed before catching the giant 
catfish of the Mekong, mentions 
propitiatory rites for the spirit of 
the Golden Basin that required &quot;a 
procession of boats conveying 
swords, water gourds, trays of 
betel-nuts and leaves, pieces of 
silver and of beeswax, green coco- 
nuts, sweetmeats, candles, incense 
tapers, sandalwood flowers, a gong 



and two flutes, all to be offered to 
the Spirit with suitable music and 
incantations. 

&quot;One wonders,&quot; writes David- 
son, &quot;how the fishermen, preoccu- 
pied by the need to do everything 
right, could devote the necessary 
attention to the actual catching of 
fish. They would be further dis- 
tracted by the requirement that they 
should hurl abuse at each other 
throughout the fishing: &apos;O, bald- 
headed fool; O, ancients in thy 
dotage. A dog shall lie with thy 
mother. . . .&apos; &quot; 

Supposedly, the advent of motor- 
boats scared off the fish and ended 
the abundant conditions that en- 
couraged such a leisurely approach 
to fishing. Everywhere, the old 
chain of food transmission from 
farm to table has been disturbed 
and distorted. Built up at a glacial 
pace over centuries, food customs 
and recipes are the epitome of the 
traditional life in every culture. 
Their loss is not merely a sign of 
gastronomic decline, for if that was 
all it meant — inferior hams — who 
would seriously care. The prob- 
lem is one of social pathology.

Meydiha&apos;s Kisir 

(Based on Marianne and Jerry 
Leach&apos;s transcription of a Turkish 
cracked wheat dish.) 

12 scallions, white and green por- 
tions, trimmed and chopped 

2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely 
chopped 

6 tablespoons olive oil 



1 pound (about IVi cups) cracked 

wheat (bulgur) 
I tablespoon tomato paste 
!4 teaspoon cayenne if you like 
pungent tastes — or red pepper 
if you don&apos;t. (Note that the 
tomato paste and cayenne are 
a substitute for the liquefied 
tomato paste and chili pepper 
pulp found in southern Turkey. 
The substitution maintains 
some authenticity because red 
pepper and cayenne come from 
the same species as Turkish 
chili peppers.) 
Black pepper 
Salt 
4-8 ounces (1-2 bunches) parsley 
(preferably the flat-leaved, Ital- 
ian variety), finely chopped 
% cup lemon juice (juice of 3 
small lemons) 
Romaine lettuce 
3-i lemons, sliced into wedges 

1. Saute the scallions and garlic in 
the olive oil until the scallion 
pieces have softened but not 
browned. 

2. Combine the sauteed scallions, 
garlic, and olive oil with cracked 
wheat in a large pot. Stir until 



the wheat has been coated with 
the oil and absorbed it all. Pour 
5 cups of boiling water over the 
cracked wheat mixture. Bring to 
a boil, stir in tomato paste, re- 
duce heat, cover, and simmer 
slowly until water has been ab- 
sorbed and the wheat is soft and 
fluffy. This will take about 15 
minutes, but check beforehand 
so that wheat does not overcook 
and turn mushy. 
3. Stir in seasonings, parsley, and 
lemon juice. Cover and let stand 
until ready to serve. The flavor 
deepens the longer it stands. 
There is a limit to this if you 
wish to serve the kisir hot. It is 
quite palatable as a cold dish, 
but is traditionally served steam- 
ing on a bed of romaine leaves 
with lemon wedges. (Bulgur can 
be reheated. Just add a small 
amount of water and place, cov- 
ered, over very low heat.) 

Yield: 6 servings as a main course

The Eggshell&apos;s Story 

photographs by David Scharf 



From a distance, an egg looks elegantly simple. Its 
smooth, rounded surface encloses life&apos;s beginning, sug- 
gesting sustenance and a new day&apos;s start. But close 
examination shatters the egg&apos;s tranquil disguise. Under 
the power of a scanning electron microscope, an egg&apos;s 
surface resembles a vast field of broken ice. An even 
closer view turns out to be very dramatic: what was a 
hairline crack in the eggshell now appears to be a fis- 
sure dividing a small cathedral. The slight fault yawns 
away into a deep canyon. 

An egg&apos;s shell is not only a protective shield; it also 
allows the egg to breathe. If the egg&apos;s embryo is to sur- 
vive, oxygen must pass in, and the carbon dioxide 
metabolized inside must pass out, through the shell. 
Inside the shell, the yolk and white are bound together 
and enclosed by two swaddling membranes, made up 
of cobweblike fibers. The fibers of the outer membrane 
are firmly threaded through the cores of small knobs, 
or mammillae, which fuse to form the eggshell&apos;s inner 
layer, and the membrane is anchored like a fishing net 
to these knobs. The rough tips of the mammillae form 
a mossy looking surface that continues into the shell&apos;s 
outer layer. This part, the palisade layer, is composed 
of calcite, a crystalline form of calcium carbonate. 
Closely packed columns of these crystals, fitting to- 
gether like pieces of a puzzle, are further connected by 
a matrix of protein. Between the columns are air chim- 
neys ending in pores, which an unaided eye can see in 
the small depressions on an egg&apos;s surface. The shells of 
domestic hens&apos; eggs vary tremendously in thickness 
and number of pores, but generally the egg&apos;s broad end 
has more pores. 

Just before the egg is laid, it is polished off, like a 
dyed Easter ornament, by a cuticle coating. Depending 
on its parent, the egg may turn out speckled, pink, 
almost black, terra cotta, dull, porcelainlike, glossy, 
chalky, ridged, pitted, soapy, or even oiled for extra 
waterproofing. However, all eggs, from those of the 
tiny, fragile hummingbird to the tough, enormous 
specimens of the extinct elephant bird, require shells of 
the sturdy but porous nature revealed in these photo- 
graphs.

Celestial Events 

by Thomas D. Nicholson 

Sun and Moon In early March, the sun is south of the equatorial 
plane, moving eastward through the stars of Aquarius. It enters 
Pisces about March 12, crosses the equator on March 20 (the vernal 
equinox), and moves into Aries about April 19. As the sun&apos;s motion 
takes it rapidly northward, there is a marked increase in the duration 
of daylight and insolation in the Northern Hemisphere. 

The moon appears in the evening sky as a slender crescent, follow- 
ing the sun into the western horizon, on about the 10th or 11th of 
both March and April. It remains a prominent early evening object 
until the last week of both months. In March, first-quarter moon is 
on the 16th, full moon on the 24th, and last-quarter on the 31st. After 
the new moon of April 7, first-quarter is on the 15th, full moon on the 
22nd, and last-quarter on the 29th. Perigee moon is on March 5 and 3 1 , 
apogee on March 17 and April 14. 

Stars and Planets The trend of the planets to shift into prominence 
as evening stars continues in March and April. All except Pluto are 
above the horizon at sunset until mid-April, and even Pluto becomes 
an evening object on April 5. During the last two weeks of March, 
Mercury will be favorably placed from mid-evening to late twilight; 
Venus, much brighter and easier to see, will be nearby to serve as a 
guide. Look for Venus, bright and low in the west, from half an hour 
past sundown until dark. Mercury will be almost directly above it on 
the evening of the 15th; dimmer and more distant on subsequent 
nights. And, while Mercury becomes less prominent (you can&apos;t 
expect to see it after the end of March), Venus becomes more 
noticeable in the evening sky of April, appearing higher and setting 
later. 

Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn will be arrayed from right to left among 
the dominant constellations of the evening spring sky. At dusk in 
March, Jupiter, the brightest of the three, will be high in the south in 
Taurus. In April it moves into Gemini. Mars is to Jupiter&apos;s left until 
late March; then moves into Cancer. Saturn is farther to the left, in 
Leo, just to the right and a little brighter than the star Regulus. 

March 2: Mars resumes its direct (easterly) motion, shifting to the 
left relative to the bright stars of Gemini. 

March 12: Mercury and Venus are in conjunction today. 

March 16: Jupiter is near the moon this evening. 

March 18: Mars is near the moon tonight. 

March 20: Spring commences in the Northern Hemisphere at 6:24 
P.M., EST, when the sun arrives at the vernal equinox. 

March 24: A total lunar eclipse today will be visible in North 
America, but only in the extreme northwest. Mercury, at greatest 
distance to the sun&apos;s left, is favorably placed as an evening star. 

April 1: Mercury begins its retrograde motion. 

April 8: Venus is close to the crescent moon tonight. 

April 1 1: The occultation of Aldebaran by the crescent moon will 
occur in daylight over eastern Canada. Mercury, in inferior conjunc- 
tion, enters the morning sky. 

April 12: Jupiter is near the moon tonight. 

April 15: Mars is near the moon tonight. 

April 17: Saturn is near the moon tonight. 

* Hold the Star Map so the compass direction you face is at the bottom; then 
match the stars in the lower half of the map with those in the sky near the 
horizon. The map is for 11:20 p.m. on March 1; 10:25 p.m. on March 15; 
9:20 P.M. on March 31: and 8:25 p.m. on April 15; but it can also be used for 
an hour before and after those times.

Additional Reading 



Thoreau (p. 6) 

Much has been written about 
Thoreau but the two most recom- 
mended biographies are The Days 
of Henry Thoreau, by Walter Hard- 
ing (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 
Inc., 1965), and A Thoreau Profile. 
by Milton Meltzer and Walter Hard- 
ing (Concord: Thoreau Foundation, 
Inc., 1969), in paperback for $4.00. 
Most of Thoreau&apos;s works are avail- 
able at the Thoreau Lyceum, 156 
Belknap Street, Concord, Mass- 
achusetts 01742, which carries 
copies of Cape Cod, The Maine 
Woods, and A Week on the Con- 
cord and Merrimack Rivers, for 
less than $5.00 each. A good sam- 
pling of Thoreau&apos;s famous journals 
can be enjoyed by reading a $2.75 
paperback. The Heart of Thoreau&apos;s 
Journals, edited by Odell Shepard 
(New York: Dover Publications, 
Inc., 1960). 

Mexican Bats (p. 50) 

The Biology of Bats, edited by 
William A. Wismatt (New York: 
Academic Press, 1970), is a two- 
volume work: the first covers 
strictly biological topics; the 
second, ecological and behavioral 
ones. While working on the prob- 
lem of bite-free rabies transmission, 
Denny G. Constantine of the U.S. 
Public Health Service made a care- 
ful, five-year study of population 
fluctuations and group movement 
of Mexican free-tailed bats. This 
eflfort resulted in Activity Patterns 
of the Mexican Free-tailed Bat 
(Albuquerque: University of New 
Mexico Press, 1967), a pioneering 
book packed with data. Two works 
that represent Mexican-United 
States scientific cooperation on the 
question of migration of the Mex- 
ican free-tailed bat (an animal that 



knows no political boundaries) are: 
&quot;Migration in the Guano Bat,&quot; by 
R. B. Villa and E. L. Cockrum 
{Journal of Mammalogy, vol. 43, 
pp. 43-64), and &quot;Migration in the 
Guano Bat,&quot; by E. L. Cockrum 
(Miscellaneous Publication 51, 
University of Kansas Museum of 
Natural History, pp. 303-36). In 
&quot;Bat Mortality: Pesticide Poisoning 
and Migratory Stress,&quot; Kenneth N. 
Geluso and others have provided 
facts and figures on the effects of 
pesticide concentrations, combined 
with migration, on pre reproductive 
mortality rates among bats (5c/- 
ence, Octobers, 1976, pp. 184-86). 
The Life of the Cave, by D. E. 
Mohr and T. L., Poulson (New 
York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., 
1966), is a volume in the &quot;Our Liv- 
ing World of Nature&quot; series. Lav- 
ishly illustrated, the book covers 
everything from the geology, plants, 
and animals of caves to spelunking 
in them. 

Medieval Women (p. 56) 

Interest in women&apos;s studies has 
been sufficient to sustain the publi- 
cation in 1975 and 1976 of two 
notable volumes on the subject of 
medieval women. The first of these. 
The Role of Women in the Middle 
Ages, edited by Rosemarie T. 
Morewedge, was published in 
Albany by the State University of 
New York Press and includes bibli- 
ographic citations for each chapter, 
as well as some black-and-white 
illustrations. This book resulted 
from the sixth annual conference 
at the Center for Medieval and 
Early Renaissance Studies, held in 
Binghamton, New York, in 1972, 
and attended by representatives of 
different disciplines who shared a 
common interest. The second work. 



by Susan Mosher Stuard, is Women 
in Medieval Society (Philadelphia: 
University of Pennsylvania Press, 
$4.95 in paperback). This collection 
of journal articles has the addi- 
tional advantage of an introduction 
that Stuard prepared as a syn- 
thesis of the information contained 
in the articles. Each year, the Uni- 
versity of Saint Thomas in Houston, 
Texas, invites scholars to speak on 
historical topics, and these are pub- 
lished as the Smith Lectures. The 
Smith Lecture for 1971 was David 
Herlihy&apos;s Women in Medieval So- 
ciety, available for $1.50 from the 
History Department, University of 
Saint Thomas, 3812 Montrose 
Blvd., Houston. Texas 77006. 

Maya Kites (p. 68) 

Photographer Hans Namuth 
treats the eye to several pages of 
color photographs of Maya kites 
and three paragraphs of written in- 
formation in &quot;The Kites of Guate- 
mala&quot; {Architecture Plus, July/ 
August 1974, pp. 64-69). &quot;The 
Maya of Northwestern Guate- 
mala,&quot; by Charles Wagley, pp. 46- 
100 of volume 7 of the Handbook 
of Middle American Indians (Aus- 
tin: University of Texas Press, 
1969) is a synthesis of basic knowl- 
edge of Maya culture in the San- 
tiago area. The Harvard Chiapas 
Project, a study of the Maya, was 
one of the longest-running ethno- 
logical investigations ever made. 
Evon Z. Vogt published two nota- 
ble volumes as a result of this proj- 
ect. The Zinacantecos of Mexico: 
A Modern Maya Way of Life (New 
York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 
1970). a &quot;Case Studies in Cuhural 
Anthropology&quot; paperback for 
$3.95. and a big, thick volume en- 
titled Zinacantan: A Maya Com- 



116 



munity in the Highlands of Chiapas 
(Cambridge: Harvard University 
Press, 1969). These books are 
nicely illustrated with black-and- 
white photographs and diagrams. 
Both boast good bibliographies; the 
former also includes a &quot;Recom- 
mended Reading&quot; list. For informa- 
tion about Maya religious practices 
there is a chapter devoted to the 
topic in Octavio Paz&apos;s Labyrinth of 
Solitude: Life and Thought in Mex- 
ico (New York: Grove Press, 1962), 
a $3.95 paperback. 

Sharks (p. 76) 

Volume 3, part 3 of the Hand- 
book of Sensory Physiology, en- 
titled Electroreceptors and Other 
Specialized Receptors in Lower 
Vertrebrates [sic], by T. H. Bullock 
et al. , was edited by Alfred Fessard, 
and published by Springer- Verlag, 
New York, in 1975. Of the nine 
chapters in the monograph, six 
focus specifically on electric phe- 
nomena and make up the latest, 
most complete coverage of this field 
of study. 

The OflRce of Naval Research has 
sponsored E. S. Hodgson and 
R. W. Mathewson in their editing 
of The Sensory Biology of Elasmo- 
branchs, soon to be published by 
the U.S. Government Printing 
OflRce. Watch issues of the Monthly 
Catalog of United States Govern- 
ment Publications for the an- 
nouncement of its availability. This 
work will be an excellent source of 
information about people and facil- 
ities currently involved in actual re- 
search on shark sensory physi- 
ology. 

Eugenie Clark, who was instru- 
mental in creating the Cape Haze 
Marine Laboratory in Florida and 
served as its first director, wrote 



an account of that experience in 
The Lady and the Sharks (New 
York: Harper and Row Publishers, 
1969). Perry Gilbert, the present 
director of the laboratory (now 
known as the Mote Marine Labora- 
tory), contributed &quot;The Behavior 
of Sharks&quot; to Scientific American 
July 1962, pp. 60-68. General bio- 
logical information is abundantly 
provided in Henry B. Bigelow and 
W. C. Schroeder&apos;s Fishes of the 
Gulf of Maine (U.S. Fish and Wild- 
life Service, Fishery Bulletin, 1953, 
vol. 53), which includes a substan- 
tial section on sharks. More general 
information can be found in 
Richard H. Backus and Thomas H. 
Lineaweaver&apos;s Natural History of 
Sharks, $2.95 in a 1973 paperback 
edition from Doubleday and Co., 
New York. Richard Ellis&apos;s The 
Book of Sharks takes an anecdotal, 
pictorial approach to the subject of 
shark study. Published in 1976 by 
Grosset and Dunlap, Inc., New 
York, this coflFee-table-sized work 
boasts two-page color spreads of 
the author&apos;s shark paintings, as well 
as photographs of prominent shark 
specialists taken at work. 

River Running (p. 82) 

Several works provide a philo- 
sophical backdrop for the problems 
posed by river use and private 
versus commercial interests in our 
national parks. In 1974, the Conser- 
vation Foundation of Washington, 
D.C. produced a task force report. 
National Parks for the Future. 
Among other matters, this report 
addresses the question of overuse 
of the parks. Another proponent of 
the notion that Americans are lov- 
ing their wilderness areas to death 
is Roderick Nash, a river runner 
and author of Wilderness and the 



American Mind (New Haven: Yale 
University Press, 1973). His book 
includes a discussion of Grand 
Canyon&apos;s diflficulties and a bibli- 
ography. The history of policy 
making in the national parks of the 
United States can be approached 
through two sources. Our National 
Park Policy: A Critical History, by 
John Ise (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins 
Press for Resources for the Future, 
1961), is a scholarly, citation-filled 
work, particularly useful for ex- 
plaining the ideas in vogue at the 
time of the founding of the park sys- 
tem. A Special Supplement in the 
October 1976 issue of Natural His- 
tory, &quot;America&apos;s National Parks; 
Their Principles, Purposes, and 
Prospects,&quot; by Joseph Sax, is a 
summary that brings with it addi- 
tional bibliographic information. 

Most of the material directly re- 
lated to the question of river recrea- 
tion and commercial versus private 
river running is in the form of gov- 
ernment documents. In January 
1977, the U.S. Forest Service held 
a symposium on river recreation. 
The results, published as U.S. De- 
partment of Agriculture, Forest 
Service, General Technical Report 
NC-2S, Proceedings : River Recrea- 
tion Management and Research 
Symposium, may be obtained from 
the North Central Forest Experi- 
ment Station in St. Paul, Minne- 
sota. Bo Shelby and Joyce Nielsen 
of Human Ecology Research Ser- 
vices, Inc., submitted Private and 
Commercial Trips in the Grand 
Canyon, part 4 of the &quot;Colorado 
River Research Program&quot; series, 
under contract to the National Park 
Service in 1976. This publication 
(PB-267729) is available from the

Service in Washington, D.C.

In Saronno, all we think about 

is love. 




For it was here that Amaretto, 
the drink of love, began 450 
years ago. When a beautiful 
young woman created an 
extraordinary liqueur for the 
man of her heart. To be 
known for the way you make 
love in Italy. . . believe us, 
that is no small matter. 

So here in Saronno, we 
do not fool around with 
love. We still make Amaretto 
di Saronno as we have for 
centuries. We allow the 
flavor to develop until it is 
soft and full. We take our 
time — can love be hurried? 

Sip it as it is, on the rocks, 
in a mixed drink. Just bear 
in mind: only Amaretto 
di Saronno is originate. 
There are other amarettos 
you can buy. But true love 
comes only from Saronno.

* Just because I 

work for an oil company doesn&apos;t mean I 
like dirty beachesJ&apos; 




&quot;Some of my friends 
actually seem to think that 
anybody who works for 
an oil company likes dead 
birds and dirty beaches,&quot; 
says Gulf ^r .-^ 

Drilling 
Superinten- 
dent Bob 
Eslinger. 

&quot;Of course, I don&apos;t, 
any more than you do. 
But I like having a car 
and a warm house for my 
family. And those things 
take energy. 

&quot;I honestly think you 
can have both energy and 
a good environment, if 
you try to do things right. 
And a lot of things are 
being done right. 

Three out of 20,000 

&quot;For instance, since 
the early 1940&apos;s, the oil 
industry drilled 20,000 oil 



&quot;That&apos;s me, my wife 
Britt, and my son 
Erick at Matagorda 
Beach. We come here 
as often as we can.&quot; 



Gulf Oil Corporation 



and gas wells in the Gulf 
of Mexico — and has had 
only three major oil spills 
in all that time. That&apos;s a 
pretty good record. And 
in each case, after a year&apos;s 
time, you&apos;d never know 
there had been an oil 
spill. 

We&apos;re finding ways 

&quot;I&apos;m proud of my 
company — Gulf Oil — 
because I know firsthand 
a lot of the things Gulf 
does, and the precautions 
we take, to get the 




energy and preserve the 
environment. Like 
relandscaping old surface 
mines. And helping 
industry find ways to 
eliminate pollution. 

&quot;Probably you can&apos;t 
expect oil companies and 
environmentalists ever to 
agree completely. But you 
don&apos;t need complete 
agreement to make 
something work. 

&quot;Gulf and the other oil 
companies are making a 
lot of things work to get 
the energy we need and 
protect the environment. 
It&apos;s a tremendous 
challenge, and 1 think 
we&apos;re handling it pretty 
well.&quot;

Gulf people: 
meeting the challenge. 



&quot;I think you can have 
both energy and a good 
environment, if you 
try to do things right.&quot;

OMNrSTOPS. 



Motor Trend magazine 
thinks so. Whicli is why Dodge 
Omni became Motor Trend Car 
of the Year. 

Veteran car critics and 
testers have been reporting some 
very nice things about Omni. 
Like the confident feel of its 
front-wheel drive. And the kind of 
space front-wheel drive gives 
Omni&apos;s occupants. So, the 
nation&apos;s automotive press also 
thinks so. 

We think you&apos;re 
going to _ 



to know Omni prices start at just 
$3706* Which includes such 
standard items as an AM radio, 
vinyl body-side moldings, and 
whitewall radial tires. With a little 
judicious selection of options 
and trim packages, you can own 
an Omni like the one in the picture 
for just $41 35* 

For that kind of money, you 
get a lot of versatility. First of all, 
Omni is built for American-sized 
folks. There are four wide doors 




think 0mm s tops, too. Because 
Omni can get so much done. . . 
lots more in fact . . . than it did for 
the car experts. We say that 
because it will take thousands of 
miles around the town and out 
in the country to put Omni to its 
truest test. With you at the wheel.

■|^^w Now, car testers 

^H^ don&apos;t worry too much 
uacige a^Qut price. But you 
have to. So it&apos;s nice 

*Does not include taxes and destination charges 



for easy entry. There is a great big 
10.2-cubic-foot storage 
compartment when the rear seat 
is in place. Fold the seat down, 
and you get a cavernous 35.8- 
cubic-foot area that&apos;ll take on a 
surprising lot of cargo. Omni is 
roomier than you might expect. 
You can make your Omni 
roomier yet. More versatile. 
Order it with an optional 
factory-installed multipurpose 



carryall roof rack. With 
appropriate attachments, it&apos;ll 
handle bikes, skis, baggage, or 
other cargo up to 1 50 pounds. 
After all, the more you carry 
outside, the more you can carry 
inside. 

EFAESnMATES: 
30 MPG HIGHWAY/25 MPC CITY. 

Omni is also very obliging 
on gas mileage. EPA estimates 
are 38 MPG (highway )/25 MPG 
[city]. That&apos;s when your Omni is 
equipped with its standard 
1.7 litre engine and 
four-speed trans- 
mission and 3.3 
transaxle ratio. Your 
mileage may 
vary. Depends on how 
you drive, your car&apos;s 
condition, and its 
equipment. 
And California 
mileage is lower. 
With so much 
waiting for you 
to see, and try, 
and feel, 
why not get 
^ down 
to your 
Dodge 
Dealer&apos;s soon. 
We think you&apos;ll end up 
buying or leasing the car so 
many experts say is tops in its 
class for 1978.

Authors 



Doreen Buscemi, author of &quot;The 
Last American Parakeet,&quot; has been 
an avid birder since the age of 
twelve. She has an impressive life- 
list to her credit, much of it com- 
piled while hiking in the Everglades 
and the Appalachians, another fa- 



vorite pastime. A free-lance writer 
and photographer, and a full-time 
housewife, her primary concern has 
been the rapid disappearance of 
Florida&apos;s wildlife. Her articles have 
appeared in Family Health. Har- 
per&apos;s, and Country Gentleman. 





The ecology, social behavior, and 
evolution of small mammals have 
been virtually a lifelong research 
pursuit for Paul K. Anderson, a 
professor of zoology at the Univer- 
sity of Calgary. He writes that his 
doctoral thesis &quot;dealt with the op- 
eration of evolutionary processes 
in island populations of salaman- 
ders. Salamanders reproduce only 
once a year and social interactions 
are less evident than in small mam- 
mals, which may reproduce re- 
peatedly during an extended breed- 
ing season.&quot; This early revelation 
led Anderson to stalk the house 
mouse, a common and fecund ro- 
dent whose ecological and genetic 
population processes he has inves- 
tigated on the western Canadian 
prairies, in the Rocky Mountains, 
and on Great Gull Island in Long 
Island Sound, New York. 



&quot;I have spent most of the re- 
search phase of my scholarly life in 
peasant villages, agricultural towns, 
and industrialized urban ghettos 
where rural countrymen have been 
drawn seeking jobs as unskilled 
labor,&quot; writes David D. Gregory. 
Between 1966 and 1968, he studied 
the effects of massive emigra- 
tion in Andalusia. It was then that 
he first observed Holy Week in 
Seville. In addition, he traveled 
with Spanish villagers into the in- 
dustrialized societies of Germany 
and Switzerland. In 1975 Gregory 
witnessed the reverse of this trend: 
Spanish workers being forced out 
of western Europe by an economic 
recession and returning home. This 
year, Gregory, assistant professor 
of anthropology at Dartmouth Col- 
lege, is studying the effects of mi- 
gration on political organizations in 
southern Portugal and Spain.

Crafted in the Orient, 

of precious jade and solid gold ... 

THE PENDANT 

OF THE IMPERIAL HORSE 





To be issued only during 1978 -the Year of the Horse 
in the lunar calendar of the ancient East 



At the end of Buddha&apos;s time on earth, he summoned all the animals so 
that he might bid them farewell. And the first to arrive— among them, 
the horse— received a special reward for their devotion. For Buddha 
decreed that the eternal cycle of the years should henceforth bear their 
names in turn and reflect their influence. 

In this ancient lunar calendar, 1978 is the Year of the Horse. And so, 
in the spirit of this tradition, Franklin Mint of Hong Kong has created 
a beautiful new pendant— &apos;The Pendant of the Imperial Horse&apos;— in 14 
karat gold and jade . . . the precious stone revered throughout the Orient 
for its incomparable beauty. 

The image of the imperial horse is perfectly proportioned, and care- 
fully crafted of 14 karat gold. The pendant of precious jade, which bears 
this sculptured golden horse, is the especially desirable water-green 
color— providing a perfect background for the golden horse. 

Appropriately, &apos;The Pendant of the Imperial Horse&apos; will be crafted to 
order in the Orient by Franklin Mint of Hong Kong— the city that has 
been, for centuries, the gold and jade center of the East. The pendant is 
available exclusively from Franklin Mint of Hong Kong and its affiliates. 
It will not be offered for original sale through any other source. 

To acquire this classically beautiful pendant of jade and solid 14 karat 
gold, mail the coupon promptly, directly to The Franklin Mint, the U.S. 
affiliate of Franklin Mint of Hong Kong. Your pendant will be sent to you 
within 8 to 10 weeks.

Are you the kind of person

set 31 world records for Diesels. 

You&apos;ll also bethrilled to know 
the 1978 Rabbit comes with 
such things as an &quot;indepen-

manages to combine the 
stable tracking of a rigid rear 
axle with the smoothness of an 
independent suspension.

A Volkswagen Rabbit looks 
smaller than other cars, right? 
But inside, our engineers 
cleverly devoted 87% of the 
interior to functional room. 

Openthetrunk and (believe 
it or not!) there&apos;s more lug- 
gage space than a Cadillac 
Seville. 

Fold down the rear seat and 
(amazingly!) there&apos;s almost as 
much luggage space as 
some station wagons. 

Then open the door. Your

There&apos;s more people space 
than Chevy Monza, Datsun

able thing *3; a stroke of 
sheer genius: 

The seat belts 
actually put themselves on. 
No fumbling about on the 
floortrying to find them. 

No mumbling about what a 
pain normal seat belts are. 
It&apos;s like magic. 
Just close the door and 
they&apos;re on. 

This type of passive restraint 
system will be mandatory in 
1984. And only a Model &quot;L&quot; 
Rabbit has it now. 

Another stroke of genius: a 
cooling fan with brains.

When ifs freezing out and a 
fan isn&apos;t needed, our cooling 
fan knows enough to shut itself 
off. (That saves you noise and 
energy) 

When it&apos;s boiling out, our 
cooling fan has the good 
sense to keep running even 
after the car is shut off. (Be- 
cause that&apos;s an important time 
to protect your engine 
against overheating.) Then it 
automatically stops when the 
engine is cooled off. 

Last but least, 
a word about money. 

Happily, all Rabbits are 
frugal when it comes to money. 

The problem is, which Rabbit 
should you buy? 

A gas-powered Rabbit - 
which is a wonderful car to 
begin with. 

Or a Rabbit Diesel - which 
costsabout $200 more than our 
&quot;C&quot; and T gas models. 

What do you get for $200? 

For one thing, diesel fuel 
costs about IOC; a gallon less 
than gasoline.&apos; 

For another, a diesel engine 
never needs a major tune-up. 
Because there are no spark- 
plugs, points, condensers, or 
carburetors to tune. 

All this, and great mileage, 
too. 

A tough choice, to be sure. 

But then, a Rabbit is the only 
car in its class that gives you a 
choice at all. 

What could be more re- 
markable than that?

The Last American Parakeet 



by Doreen Buscemi 



In 1918, a Carolina parakeet 
died in the Cincinnati Zoo. 
Its remains have vanished, 
as has the species 



Striking green and yellow 
parakeets were once found over 
much of the eastern United States. 
Today, only sixty years after their 
extinction, their existence is re- 
membered mainly by ornithologists 
and bird lovers. Reams have been 
written about the passenger pigeon, 
the ivory-billed woodpecker, and 
other extinct and vanishing birds, 
but the last Carolina parakeet was 
not even accorded a place of honor 
in a museum. It died at the Cincin- 
nati Zoological Gardens in 1918, 
four years after the last passenger 
pigeon died there. The passenger 
pigeon was sent to the Smithsonian 
Institution where it is on display 
today, but no one knows what hap- 
pened to the skin of the last 
parakeet. 

Even while they lived, the birds 
were not studied closely. No 
trained ornithologist ever saw a 
nest and most of the information 
we have regarding their breeding 
and nesting habits has come from 
the observation of captive birds. 

A wedge-tailed bird slightly larger 
than a mourning dove, the Carolina 
parakeet was the only native rep- 
resentative of the parrot family to 
breed within the United States in 
recent times. The bird&apos;s body was a 
bright green; its head lemon yellow 
with an orange forehead. The spe- 
cies was divided into two geo- 



graphic races: Conuropsis caro- 
linensis carolinensis and C. c. ludo- 
viciana. The first was found mainly 
in the southeastern United States 
from Florida north to Virginia and 
west to Alabama; occasionally it 
ranged north to eastern Pennsyl- 
vania and New York. The second 
subspecies ranged from Mississippi 
and Louisiana north to Indiana and 
Ohio and west to the foothills of 
the Rocky Mountains. 

Parrots are usually tropical birds 
but the Carolina parakeet was an 
obvious exception. Ornithologist 
Alexander Wilson saw them &quot;in the 



^^- 




month of February along the banks 
of the Ohio, in a snowstorm.&quot; A 
flock of these hardy birds once ap- 
peared in midwinter at Albany, 
New York. They were frequently 
sighted in the north when snow 
covered the ground and other spe- 
cies had migrated. 

Although not migratory, Caro- 
lina parakeets traveled widely in 
search of food. Compact flocks 



numbering hundreds of birds could 
dart in and out of the densest tim- 
ber with ease. The flocks were 
beautiful in flight since the birds 
flew with inclinations of the body 
that displayed the brilliant greens 
and yellows of their plumage. While 
on the wing, Carolina parakeets 
kept up a constant chatter; one ob- 
server noted that their shrill cries 
could be heard for miles. 

&quot;On reaching a spot which af- 
fords a supply of food,&quot; Audubon 
wrote in his Ornithological Biog- 
raphy, &quot;instead of alighting at 
once, as many other birds do, the 
parakeets take a good survey of the 
neighborhood, passing over it in 
circles of great extent, first above 
the trees, and then gradually lower- 
ing until they almost touch the 
ground, then suddenly reascend- 
ing. they all settle on the tree that 
bears the fruit of which they are in 
quest, or in one close to the field in 
which they expect to regale them- 
selves.&quot; 

The original food of the Carolina 
parakeet, before the United States 
was widely settled, consisted al- 
most entirely of seeds, primarily 
those of cocklebur or thistle, but 
also those of various trees, most 
commonly of cypress, sycamore, 
and maple. Wild grapes, berries, 
nuts, buds, and flowers rounded 
out their diet. The birds were sel- 
dom far from the type of habitat — 
heavily wooded banks of rivers and 
streams or an extensive cypress 
swamp — that supported an abun- 
dance of these foods. 

Early morning hours would find 
the parakeets out feeding. They re-

tired to the deep woods during the 
hottest part of the day and then 
returned to the forest edge and 
nearby fields to forage in the late 
afternoon. An entire floct: would 
sometimes roost for the night in a 
large, hollow tree, the birds hang- 
ing by their powerful beaks and 
claws. 

Clumsy and slow on the ground, 
Carolina parakeets were acrobats 
in the trees. Using its beak, a 
parakeet could swing through the 
trees, moving about on branches 
that looked too slight to support it. 
This ability enabled the parakeet to 
reach almost any seed on a tree. 

Carolina parakeets are thought to 
have nested colonially in hollow 
trees — probably oak, cypress, or 
sycamore. There were also reports 
of large colonies building nests of 
sticks. The birds may have done 
both. When hollow trees were not 
present in sufficient numbers to ac- 
commodate a colony, the birds may 
have built their nests in the 
branches of trees. 

The close-grained eggs of the 
Carolina parakeet were glossy 
white and deeply pitted. There are 
two egg dates from the wild — both 
from Florida in the month of April. 
The number of eggs in a normal 
clutch — while not known for 
certain — is believed to have been 
two or three. In captivity, the birds 
were careless in the care and feed- 
ing of their young. As for the de- 
velopment and care of the young in 
the wild, there are no accurate re- 
cords. The Carolina parakeet was 
exterminated before it was ever 
really known. 

The extinction of the Carolina 
parakeet can be attributed to a 
variety of causes. For one thing, 
the birds had some commercial 
value; many were shot for the mil- 
linery trade. In the 1800s fashion- 
able women not only wore feathers 
on their hats, they often wore an 
entire stuffed bird. The colorful 
parakeets were ideal for this pur- 
pose. Professional hunters also cap- 
tured large numbers of parakeets 
and sold them as cage birds. The 
birds were edible and many early 
writers reported that the flesh was 
very tasty. Unlike passenger 
pigeons, the Carolina parakeet was 
never shot for the commercial food 
market, but they were commonly 
utilized as food by many settlers 
and farmers. 

Farmers considered the Carolina 



parakeet a destructive pest. If the 
birds had continued to eat wild 
seeds and fruit, as they did before 
the country was settled, they might 
not have been exterminated. But 
they developed a fondness for cul- 
tivated crops and fruits. Large 
flocks of parakeets would settle on 
a wheat field and eat much of the 
crop or they would fly into an or- 
chard and strip the fruit off the 
trees. Little was safe from the 
birds — in Florida, they even de- 
veloped a taste for oranges and 
bananas. Sometimes they didn&apos;t eat 
the seeds and fruit but only dam- 
aged the crop by snapping off the 
heads of wheat stalks or taking one 
bite out of a piece of fruit. Under 
the circumstances, one can un- 
derstand why farmers wanted to 
get rid of the birds. 

Perhaps the worst habit of the 
Carolina parakeet, at least in terms 
of its survival, was its concern for 
wounded members of the flock. 
The cries of an injured bird would 
bring the entire flock back to hover 
over the crippled individual. This 
brought the birds back into shoot- 
ing range and an entire flock was 
often decimated in this manner. In 
The Birds of Eastern North 
America. C.J. Maynard wrote that 
he frequently saw &quot;every indi- 
vidual in a flock killed one after the 
other, and the last bird betrayed as 
much anxiety for the fate of its 
prostrate friends ... as it did when 
the first fell.&quot; 

There were probably other, less 
tangible reasons for the extinction 
of the parakeets. The late Frank 
Chapman, curator of birds at the 
American Museum of Natural His- 
tory, believed that the parakeets 
were &quot;not equipped to withstand 
contact with civilization.&quot; 

Whatever the reasons, their 
numbers began to decline in the 
early nineteenth century. As early 
as 1832. Audubon reported that 
&quot;our parakeets are very rapidly 
diminishing in number; and in some 
districts, where twenty-five years 
ago they were plentiful, scarcely 
any are now to be seen.&quot; 

From that time on, the range of 
the Carolina parakeet gradually 
contracted. By the 1860s, the birds 
were still fairly common through- 
out the Gulf Coast States and the 
Mississippi and Arkansas River 
valleys, although they were gone 
from the rest of their range. The 
parakeet was restricted to Florida 



by the 1890s, with a few scattered 
reports of the birds in Kansas and 
Missouri. In isolated sections of 
southern Florida, the species hung 
on for another decade. There, 
Chapman saw the last wild flock 
near Taylor Creek, northeast of 
Lake Okeechobee, in April 1904. 
There were thirteen birds in the 
flock, and Chapman shot four. 

This was the last authenticated 
sighting of the Carolina parakeet 
and the official date for the extinc- 
tion of the species in the wild. 
Several birds lived on in captivity 
but the last of these died at the 
Cincinnati Zoo. 

For many years, there were re- 
ports of the Carolina parakeet 
being sighted, but none were ever 
verified. There is a possibility, 
however, that isolated flocks sur- 
vived after 1904 in some of the 
impenetrable swamps of the Deep 
South. Perhaps the most intriguing 
of these reports surfaced in the 
1930s in South Carolina, where 
George M. Melamphy was working 
on a wild turkey project in the vast 
Santee Swamp. While in his turkey 
blind, he reportedly sighted 
Carolina parakeets and ivory-billed 
woodpeckers on numerous occa- 
sions. He contacted Alexander 
Sprunt, Jr., of the National Audu- 
bon Society who, along with 
Robert P. Allen, undertook an in- 
vestigation in late 1936. Because 
the expedition was plagued by 
cloudy weather, rain, and mist, the 
investigators never had good light 
for observation. They did, how- 
ever, see a flight line of birds that 
appeared to be Carolina parakeets. 
On another occasion, Sprunt 
caught sight of a green bird he 
believed was a parakeet. 

Unfortunately, the existence of 
parakeets in the Santee Swamp was 
never verified even though the 
presence of the ivory-bill was defi- 
nitely confirmed. Years later, Allen 
doubted that parakeets were in the 
swamp, but Sprunt disagreed. It 
was his &quot;firm and considerable be- 
lief that the Carolina parakeet was 
in the Santee Swamp in 1936, a 
remnant of a population which 
probably had always lived there.&quot; 

We will never know for certain 
since shortly after the expedition, 
the Santee Swamp disappeared be- 
neath the Santee-Cooper Hydro- 
electric Project. That great river 
swamp, like the Carolina parakeet, 
is now gone forever. D

of its electronic exposure control system with 
its advanced, super-sensitive gaUium photo 
diodes, which reduces correct exposure 
setting to near-foolproof simplicity. And, 
as you sight through the big, brilliant 
viewfjnder, you feel the confidence that 
inspires Nikon users in their pursuit, of 
photography at its finest. ^^ 



You will find your confidence fully borne 
out by the wide-ranging, yet easy to use 
capabilities buiU into the Nikon FM and by 
the magnificent image quality of its Nikkor 
lens. And, these capabilities are easily 
expanded by the famous Nikon system which 
puts more than fifty-five lenses and hundreds 
of accessories, including a motor drive, at 
your disposal. 

The Nikon FM is one modern classic that 
is easy to afford. Let your Nikon dealer put 
one into your hands (you II find him in the 
. Yellow Pages). Ask him also about the 
traveling Nikon School. Or write for LitlPak

Did he expect 
too much from us? 



The eagle has always been a symbol 
of our highest standards: Pride. Honor. 
Honesty. And now both the eagle and 
what he represents are in danger of 
slipping away from us. 

At Whirlpool we believe we must 
all meet the challenge of protecting 
these standards. We feel it&apos;s so impor- 
tant to our way of life that everything 
we do is directed toward this goal. 

It starts with pride. Pride in our 
craftsmanship. We follow this basic 
rule: If we can&apos;t make something right, 
we won&apos;t make it at all. 

And then, most importantly, we be- 
lieve that once we sell something we&apos;re 
honor bound to stand behind it. 

We begin with a warranty our cus- 
tomers can read and understand. We 
feel that if we eliminate confusion we 
can create confidence. We believe 
that&apos;s important. 

We also have a special program. 
One that deals with a subject nobody 
likes to talk about: Service. We have to 
be honest about it— even the finest appli- 



ances need repairing at times. So at 
Whirlpool we&apos;ve developed a &quot;Design- 
For-Service-Program.&quot; It means that 
when we build a product we design it 
so it can be repaired quickly and easily. 
If you&apos;ve ever heard a repairman say, &quot;I 
can fix it, but it&apos;ll take a while to get at 
it,&quot; then you&apos;ll appreciate it all the more. 

Our Cool-Line&quot;- service is a toll free 
telephone service that&apos;s always there to 
help you. Try it: 800-253-1301. In Mich- 
igan: 800-632-2243. 

We have a Customer Satisfaction 
&quot;Call-Back Audit&quot; where we make ran- 
dom calls just to make sure a warranty 
claim or service call has been handled 
to your satisfaction. It&apos;s our way of 
checking up on ourselves. Making sure 
we&apos;re living up to our own standards. 

We have these services and we 
have more like them. But at Whirlpool

Bathybius Meets Eozoon 



Early evolutionists thought 
these imaginary creatures 
must exist, so they 
found them 

When Thomas Henry Huxley lost 
his young son, &quot;our delight and 
our joy,&quot; to scarlet fever, Charles 
Kingsley tried to console him with 
a long peroration on the soul&apos;s 
immortality. Huxley, who invented 
the word &quot;agnostic&quot; to describe 
his own feelings, thanked Kingsley 
for his concern, but rejected the 
preferred comfort for want of evi- 
dence. In a famous passage, since 
taken by many scientists as a motto 
for proper action, he wrote: &quot;My 
business is to teach my aspirations 
to conform themselves to fact, not 
to try and make facts harmonize 
with my aspirations. ... Sit down 
before fact as a little child, be pre- 
pared to give up every precon- 
ceived notion, follow humbly 
wherever and to whatever abysses 
nature leads, or you shall learn 
nothing.&quot; Huxley&apos;s sentiments 
were noble, his grief affecting. But 
Huxley did not follow his own dic- 
tum, and no creative scientist ever 
has. 

Great thinkers are never passive 
before facts. They ask questions of 
nature; they do not follow her hum- 
bly. They have hopes and hunches, 
and they try hard to construct the 
world in their light. Hence, great 
thinkers also make great errors. 

Biologists have inspired a long 
and special chapter in the catalog of 
major mistakes — imaginary animals 
that should exist in theory. Voltaire 
spoke truly when he quipped: &quot;If 



God did not exist, it would be 
necessary to invent him.&quot; Two re- 
lated and intersecting chimeras 
arose during the early days of evo- 
lutionary theory — two animals that 
should have been, by Darwin&apos;s 
criteria, but were not. One of them 
had Thomas Henry Huxley for a 
godfather. 

For most creationists, the gap 
between living and nonliving posed 
no special problem. God had simply 
made the living, fully distinct and 
more advanced than the rocks and 
chemicals. Evolutionists sought 
to close all the gaps. Ernst Haeckel, 
Darwin&apos;s chief defender in Ger- 
many and surely the most specula- 
tive and imaginative of early evolu- 
tionists, constructed hypothetical 
organisms to span all the spaces. 
The lowly amoeba could not serve 
as a model of the earliest life, for 
its internal differentiation into 
nucleus and cytoplasm indicated 
a large advance from primal form- 
lessness. Thus Haeckel proposed 
a lowlier organism composed only 
of unorganized protoplasm, the 
Monera. (In a way. he was right. 
We use his name today for the 
kingdom of bacteria and blue-green 
algae, organisms without nucleus 
or mitochondria — although scarcely 
formless in Haeckel&apos;s sense.) 

Haeckel defined his moneran as 
&quot;an entirely homogeneous and 
structureless substance, a living 
particle of albumin, capable of 
nourishment and reproduction.&quot; 
He proposed a moneran as an in- 
termediate form between the non- 
living and living. He hoped that it 
would solve the vexing question 
of life&apos;s origin from the inorganic. 



for no problem seemed thornier for 
evolutionists and no issue attracted 
more rear-guard support for crea- 
tionism than the apparent gap be- 
tween the most complex chemicals 
and the simplest organisms. 
Haeckel wrote: &quot;Every true cell 
already shows a division into two 
different parts, i.e., nucleus and 
plasm. The immediate production 
of such an object from spontaneous 
generation is obviously only con- 
ceivable with diflRcuIty; but it is 
much easier to conceive of the pro- 
duction of an entirely homogeneous, 
organic substance, such as the 
structureless albumin body of the 
Monera.&quot; 

During the 1860s, the identifica- 
tion of monerans assumed high 
priority on the agenda of Darwin&apos;s 
champions. And the more struc- 
tureless and diffuse the moneran, 
the better. Huxley had told Kings- 
ley that he would follow facts into 
a metaphorical abyss. But when he 
examined a true abyss in 1868, his 
prior hopes and expectations 
guided his observations. He studied 
some mud samples dredged from 
the sea bottom northwest of Ire- 
land ten years before. He observed 
an inchoate, gelatinous substance 
in the samples. Embedded in it 
were tiny, circular, calcareous 
plates called coccoliths. Huxley 
identified his jelly as the heralded, 
formless moneran and the cocco- 
liths as its primordial skeleton. (We 
now know that coccoliths are frag- 
ments of algal skeletons, which 
sink to the ocean bottom following 
the death of their planktonic pro- 
ducers.) Honoring Haeckel&apos;s pre- 
diction, he named it Bathybius

by Stephen Jay Gould 



Haeckelii. &quot;I hope that you will 
not be ashamed of your godchild,&quot;&quot; 
he wrote to Haeckel. Haeckel re- 
plied that he was &quot;very proud,&quot;&quot; 
and ended his note with a rallying 
cry: &quot;Viva Monera.&quot; 

Since nothing is quite so con- 
vincing as an anticipated discovery, 
Bathybiiis began to crop up every- 
where. Sir Charles Wyville Thomp- 
son dredged a sample from the 
depths of the Atlantic and wrote: 
&quot;The mud was actually alive; it 
stuck together in lumps, as if there 
were white of egg mixed with it; 
and the glairy mass proved, under 
the microscope, to be a living 
sarcode. Prof. Huxley . . . calls it 
Bathybiiis.&quot; (The Sarcodina are a 
group of single-celled protozoans.) 
Haeckel, following his usual pen- 
chant, soon generalized and imag- 
ined that the entire ocean floor 
(below 5,000 feet) lay covered with 
a pulsating film of living Bathybiiis, 
the Urschleim (original slime) of 
the romantic nature philosophers 
(Goethe was one) idolized by 
Haeckel during his youth. Huxley, 
departing from his usual sobriety, 
delivered a speech in 1870 and pro- 
claimed: &quot;The Bathybiiis formed 
a living scum of film on the sea- 
bed, extending over thousands 
upon thousands of square miles . . . 
it probably forms one continuous 
scum of living matter girding the 
whole surface of the earth.&quot;&quot; 

Having reached its limits of ex- 
tension in space, Bathybiiis oozed 
out to conquer the only realm left — 
time. And here it met our second 
chimera. A tale writ larger than life, 
tailor-made for Hollywood as 
&quot;Bathybiiis meets Eozoon.&quot; 



Fermentation: The miracle that turns 
the juice of the grape into wine. 




Although it is an oft-proclaimed 
truth that fine wine is a living 
growing thing, nowhere is this more 
evident than during that critical, and 
still somewhat mysterious, process 
called fermentation. 

Yeast : The Catalyst 

It is possible that a quantity of fine 
grapes crushed and left to them- 
selves in an open container will, 
in time, ferment and yield an 
acceptable wine. 

It is probable, however, that these 
same grapes will yield a wine not 
so pleasant. 

Which it will become depends on 
the vagaries of simple, one-celled 
plants called yeasts which are found 
naturally in the bloom on the skins 
of grapes. 

A Louis Pasteur Discovery 

Until 1864, wine-making was a 
matter of uncertainty. But then 
Louis Pasteur discovered that these 
yeasts were, indeed, the agents that 
caused fermentation. 

Equally important, he discovered 
that specific strains with desirable 
characteristics could be isolated and 
substituted for the wild yeast in the 
wine-making process, a major step 
toward predictable excellence. 

Today, our winemakers are 
devoted to the study of yeasts and 
to their improvement. Because no 
one yeast works equally well in 
every case, we are constantly 
striving to isolate the ideal yeast for 
the different varieties of wines. 

This development of the specific 
yeast which maximizes a grape&apos;s 
natural flavor potential is a primary 
study we have pursued for years. 

To achieve a wine of predictable 
excellence year after year, we devel- 
oped the first successful dehy- 
dration of pure wine yeast. The 
dehydrated form maintains the 
consistent purity from year to year 



and provides us with a &quot;cleaner&quot; 
wine that is truer in flavor and 
fragrance to the grape. 

Some Like It Cold 

During fermentation, heat is created. 
If we permit the fermenting juice 
or &quot;must&apos;&quot; to attain a temperature 
of only ninety degrees, the yeast can 
be injured. At one-hundred degrees, 
most yeast will die. 

Over the years, we have devel- 
oped precise cooling methods for 
keeping the fermenting liquid at the 
optimum lower temperature. This 
varies from grape to grape. For 
example, the Sauvignon Blanc, 
French Colombard, Chenin Blanc, 
Riesling or Chardonnay we use for 
our white wines are far more deli- 
cate and sensitive to temperature 
than their more robust red cousins. 

We determined that fermenting 
them at a cooler temperature slows 
the change from juice to wine and 
protects the delicacy of the resul- 
tant wine. 

In this cooled state, the juice can 
ferment as long as fourteen days 
rather than three or four. 

The Test Fermentation 

Knowing the precise moment to 
draw the wine is a combination of 
the skill and art of our winemakers. 
In some cases we actually take 
grape samples a few days before 
harvest and, on a small scale, 
proceed with fermentation. This 
gives us a preview of what to expect, 
and, we then make whatever adjust- 
ments necessary to produce the 
most consistently excellent wine. 

The Reason For All This Care 

It is only by utilizing all the skills 
gained in many years of work and 
study that we can achieve our intent: 
to bring you the finest wines that we, 
or anyone else, can provide.

Eozoon canadense. the dawn 
animal of Canada, was another 
organism whose time had come. 
The fossil record had caused Dar- 
win more grief than joy. He balked 
particularly at the Cambrian ex- 
plosion, the coincident appearance 
of almost all complex organic de- 
signs, not near the beginning of the 
earth&apos;s history, but more than five- 
sixths of the way through it (see 
my columns of November 1974 
and August/September 1976). His 
opponents took this explosion as 
the moment of creation, for not a 
single trace of Precambrian life had 
been discovered when Darwin 
wrote the Origin of Species. (We 
now have an extensive record of 
monerans from these early rocks, 
see my column of February 1977.) 
Nothing could have been more 
welcome than a Precambrian or- 
ganism, the simpler and more form- 
less the better. 

In 1858 a collector for the Geo- 
logical Survey of Canada found 
some curious specimens among the 
world&apos;s oldest rocks. They were 
made of thin, concentric layers, 
alternating between serpentine (a 
silicate) and calcium carbonate. Sir 
William Logan, director of the 
Survey, thought that they might be 
fossils and displayed them to vari- 
ous scientists, receiving in return 
little encouragement for his views. 

Logan found some better speci- 
mens near Ottawa in 1864, and 
brought them to Canada&apos;s leading 
paleontologist, J. William Daw- 
son, the principal of McGill Uni- 
versity. Dawson found &quot;organic&quot; 
structures in his microscope slides, 
most notably a canal system in the 
calcite, and identified the concen- 
tric layering as the skeleton of a 
giant foraminifer, more diifusely 
formed but hundreds of times larger 
than any modern relative. He 
named it Eozoon canadense. 

Darwin was delighted. Eozoon 
entered the fourth edition of the 
Origin of Species with Darwin&apos;s 
firm blessing: &quot;It is impossible to 
feel any doubt regarding its organic 
nature.&quot; (Ironically, Dawson him- 
self was a staunch creationist, prob- 
ably the last prominent holdout 
against the Darwinian tide. As late 
as 1897, he wrote Relics of Pri- 
meval Life, a book about Eozoon. 
In it he argues that the persistence 
of simple Foraminifera throughout 
geologic time disproves natural 
selection since any struggle for 



18 



existence would replace such lowly 
creatures with something more 
exalted.) 

Bathybiiis and Eozoon were des- 
tined for union. They shared the 
desired property of diffuse form- 
lessness and differed only in Eo- 
zoon&apos;s discrete skeleton. Either 
Eozoon had lost its shell to become 
Bailiybins or the two primordial 
forms were closely related as ex- 
emplars of organic simplicity. The 
great physiologist W. B. Carpenter, 
a champion of both creatures, 
wrote: 

If Bathybius . . . could form for it- 
self a shelly envelope, that envelope 
would closely resemble Eozoon. Fur- 
ther, as Prof. Huxley has proved the 
existence of Biithyhiii.s through a great 
range not merely of depth but of tem- 
perature, I cannot but think it probable 
that it has existed continuously in the 
deep seas of all geological epochs. . . . 
I am fully prepared to believe that 
Eozoon, as well as Bathybius, may 
have maintained its existence through 
the whole duration of geological time. 

A vision to titillate any evolutionist. 
The anticipated, formless organic 
matter had been found, and it ex- 
tended throughout time and space 
to cover the floor of the mysterious 
and primal ocean bottom. 

Before I chronicle the downfall 
of both creatures, I want to identify 
a bias that lay unstated and unde- 
fended in all the primary literature. 
All of the participants in the de- 
bate accepted without question 
the &quot;obvious&quot; truth that the most 
primitive life would be homoge- 
neous and formless, diffuse and 
inchoate. 

Carpenter wrote that Bathybius 
was &quot;a type even lower, because 
less definite, than that of Sponges.&quot; 
Haeckel declared that &quot;protoplasm 
exists here in its simplest and ear- 
liest form, i.e., it has scarcely any 
definite form, and is scarcely in- 
dividualized.&quot; Huxley proclaimed 
that life without the internal com- 
plexity of a nucleus proved that 
organization arose from indefinite 
vitality, not vice versa: Bathybius 
&quot;proves the absence of any myste- 
rious power in nuclei, and shows 
that life is a property of the mole- 
cules of living matter, and that 
organization is the result of life, 
not life the result of organization.&quot; 

But why, when we think about it, 
should we equate formless with 
primitive? Modern organisms en- 
courage no such view. Viruses are 



scarcely matched for regularity and 
repetition of form. The simplest 
bacteria have definite shapes. The 
taxonomic group that houses the 
amoeba, that prototype of slith- 
ering disorganization, also accom- 
modates the Radiolaria, the most 
beautiful and most complexly 
sculpted of all regular organisms. 
DNA is a miracle of organization; 
Watson and Crick elucidated its 
structure by building an accurate 
Tinkertoy model and making sure 
that all the pieces fit. I would not 
assert any mystical Pythagorean 
notion that regular form underlies 
all organization, but 1 would argue 
that the equation of primitive with 
formless has roots in the outdated 
progressivist metaphor that views 
organic history as a ladder leading 
inexorably through all the stages 
of complexity from nothingness to 
our own noble form. Good for the 
ego to be sure, but not a very good 
outline of our world. 

In any case, neither Bathybius 
nor Eozoon outlived Queen Vic- 
toria. The same Sir Charles Wyville 
Thompson who had spoken so 
glowingly of Bathybius as a &quot;glairy 
mass . . . actually alive&quot; later be- 
came chief scientist of the Chal- 
lenger expedition during the 1870s, 
the most famous of all scientific 
voyages to explore the world&apos;s 
oceans. The Challenger scientists 
tried again and again to find 
Bathybius in fresh samples of 
deep-sea mud, but with no success. 

When mud samples were stored 
for later analysis, scientists tradi- 
tionally added alcohol to preserve 
organic material. Huxley&apos;s original 
specimens of Bathybius had come 
from samples stored with alcohol 
for more than a decade. One mem- 
ber of the Challenger expedition 
noticed that Bathybius appeared 
whenever he added alcohol to a 
fresh sample. The expedition&apos;s 
chemist then analyzed Bathybius 
and found it to he no more than a 
colloidal precipitate of calcium 
sulfate, a product of the reaction 
of mud with alcohol. Thompson 
wrote to Huxley, and Huxley — 
without complaining — ate crow (or 
ate leeks, as he put it). Haeckel, 
as expected, proved more stub- 
born, but Bathybius quietly faded 
away. 

Eozoon hung on longer. Dawson 

defended it literally to the death in 

some of the most acerbic comments

On Photographing the Invisible 



To the naked eye, it was a Swedish 
80-ore postage stamp. A rarity, and 
very valuable. 

The camera, however, told quite 
another story. The stamp was a coun- 
terfeit. 

Faint traces of tampering that were 
hidden to the naked eye were revealed 
by the camera. Someone, somewhere, 
had ingeniously altered the stamp by 
chemically removing a surprint. The 
stamp was worthless. 




To the naked eye {left), the 
stamp was genuine. To the cam- 
era {right), it was a counterfeit, 
hlote the faint, dark traces of 
tampering now revealed in the 
upper section. 



What manner of exotic camera 
was this that could &quot;see&quot; the invisible? 

The lens: one of the 20 in the 
Hasselblad arsenal, the 105mm Zeiss 
UV-Sonnar f4.3. Designed for pho- 
tography within the ultraviolet portion 
of the electromagnetic spectrum, its 
costly quartz elements can detect 
radiations that are unseeable by the 
human eye. 

It has peered at objects in outer 
space, examined forgeries, laid bare 
the secrets of counterfeit money. Not 
a lens for everyone, obviously, but an 
indication of just how awesomely com- 
prehensive the Hasselblad System is. 

The camera: an otherwise per- 
fectly standard Hasselblad 500C/M, 



normally fitted with an 80mm Zeiss 
Planar f2.8 multi-coated lens. 

This is the basic model that allows 
you to tap into the vast Hasselblad 
System. It is one of the most bewilder- 
ingly versatile cameras the world has 
ever known. Yet so marvelously simple 
to operate that it often plays the part 
of the family snapshot camera. 

A True System. 

The Hasselblad System is a prodigious 
array of 4 cameras, 20 lenses, 8 view- 
finders, 9 film magazines, and over 
300 other accessories. Choose the right 
pieces, and your 500CA^ would be 
equipped for sports, aerial, architec- 
tural, and fashion photography. 

And portrait, landscape, medical, 
underwater, and news photography. 

And wildlife, laboratory, indus- 
trial, and child photography. 

And you would always have the 
right film in the camera at the right 
time. You can shift from color to 
black-and-white and back again to 
color— and resume shooting at pre- 
cisely the right frame— by popping in 
the protective dark slide and switch- 
ing film backs. 

The Camera with Nine Backs. 

There is a small button on the film 
backof every Hasselblad 500C/M. 
Slide it sideways with your thumb and 
the back will come away in your hand. 

The standard back holds 12 ex- 
posures. Each frame of film is 2% 
inches square, almost four times the 
area of a 35mm frame. {See box, below 
right, for actual size.) 

This IS only the beginning. There 
are eight other backs available : Backs 
that let you change to a 6 x 4.5cm for- 
mat... or a 4.5 X 4.5cm superslide 
format for showing in any 35mm 
projector. Backs that give you a choice 
of 1, 12, 16, 24, 70, or 500 exposures. 
A back that is a sheet-film adapter 



Even two backs for Polaroid film, so 
you can check composition, lighting, 
and exposure ahead of time. 

You begin to realize why eight out 
of ten top commercial photographers 
surveyed name Hasselblad as the 
medium-format camera used in their 
work. 

Retained Value vs. 
Obsolescence. 

In an age when machines spew out 
cameras in the tens and hundreds of 
thousands, when flashy new models 
thrust last year&apos;s marvels into early 
obsolescence, Hasselblad goes its own 
way. 

Planned obsolescence is taboo at 
Hasselblad. All but two of the acces- 
sories for the 500C/M will fit every 
Hasselblad made since 1957 (except 
the Super Wide C) . . . and will fit every 
future Hasselblad. 

The greater part of a year is spent 
on building each camera, much of it 
crafted by hand. And fully one quarter 
of the work force devotes its time to 
nothing but quality control. 

Little wonder, then, that a pre- 
owned Hasselblad commands such a 
high price ... if its owner can be per- 
suaded to part with it at all.

porcelain bird 

sculpture 
ever created 



This year the Notional 
Audubon Society will issue 
the first porcelain bird 
sculpture in its history. This 
important work of art will 
be created exclusively for 
individual collectors, 
by private commission 
only, and only by direct 
application to the Society. 

An announcement 
illustrating and describing 
the bird sculpture will be 
sent upon specific request.

Notional Audubon Society 



ever written by a scientist. Of one 
German critic, he remartced in 
1897: &quot;Mobius, I have no doubt, 
did his best from his special and 
limited point of view; but it was a 
crime which science should not 
readily pardon or forget, on the part 
of editors of the German periodical, 
to publish and illustrate as scientific 
material a paper which was so very 
far from being either fair or ade- 
quate.&quot; Dawson, by that time, was 
a lone holdout (although Kirk- 
patrick of last month&apos;s column re- 
vived Eozoon in a more bizarre 
form later). All scientists had 
agreed that Eozoon was a meta- 
morphic product of heat and pres- 
sure. Indeed, it had only been 
found in highly metamorphosed 
rock, a singularly inauspicious 
place to find a fossil. If any more 
proof had been needed, the dis- 
covery of Eozoon in blocks of lime- 
stone ejected from Mount Vesu- 
vius settled the issue in 1894. 

Bathybius and Eozoon. ever 
since, have been treated by sci- 
entists as an embarrassment best 
forgotten. The conspiracy suc- 
ceeded admirably, and I would be 
surprised if one percent of modern 
biologists ever heard of the two 
fantasies. Historians, trained in 
the older (and invalidated) tradition 
of science as a march to truth medi- 
ated by the successive shucking of 
error, also kept their peace. What 
can we get from errors except a 
good laugh or a compendium of 
moral homilies framed as &quot;don&apos;ts.&quot; 

Modern historians of science 
have more respect for such inspired 
errors. They made sense in their 
own time; that they don&apos;t in ours 
is irrelevant. Ours is no standard 
for all ages; science is always an 
interaction of prevailing culture, 
individual eccentricity, and empiri- 
cal constraint. Hence, Bathybius 
and Eozoon have received more 
attention in the 1970s than in all 
previous years since their down- 
fall. (In writing this column, I was 
guided to original sources and 
greatly enlightened by articles of 
C. F. O&apos;Brien [Isis, 1971] on Eo- 
zoon, and N. A. Rupke [Studies 
in the History and Philosophy of 
Science, 1976], and P. F. Rehbock 
[Isis, 1975] on Bathybius. The 
article by Rehbock is particularly 
thorough and insightful. Isis is the 
leading professional journal in the 
history of science.) 

Science contains few outright 



fools. Errors usually have their 
good reasons once we penetrate 
their context properly, rather than 
judge them according to our cur- 
rent perception of &quot;truth.&quot; They 
are usually more enlightening than 
embarrassing, for they are signs of 
changing contexts. The best think- 
ers have the imagination to create 
organizing visions, and they are 
sufficiently adventurous (or ego- 
tistical) to float them in a complex 
world that can never answer &quot;yes&quot; 
in all detail. The message provided 
by a study of inspired error is not a 
homily about the sin of pride, but a 
recognition that the capacity for 
great insight and great error are 
opposite sides of the same coin — 
and that the currency of both is 
brilliance. 

Bathybius was surely an inspired 
error. It served the larger truth 
of advancing evolutionary theory. 
It provided a captivating vision of 
primordial life, extended through- 
out time and space. As Rehbock 
argues, it filled a plethora of func- 
tions as, simultaneously, lowliest 
form of protozoology, elemental 
unit of cytology, evolutionary pre- 
cursor of all organisms, first or- 
ganic form in the fossil record, 
major constituent of modern ma- 
rine sediments (in its coccoliths), 
and source of food for higher life 
in the nutritionally impoverished 
deep oceans. When Bathybius 
faded away, the problems that it 
had defined did not disappear. 
Bathybius inspired a great amount 
of fruitful scientific work and 
served as a focus for defining im- 
portant problems still with us. 

Orthodoxy can be as stubborn in 
science as in religion. I do not know 
how to shake it except by vigorous 
imagination that inspires uncon- 
ventional work and contains within 
itself an elevated potential for in- 
spired error. As the great Italian 
economist Vilfredo Pareto wrote: 
&quot;Give me a fruitful error any time, 
full of seeds, bursting with its own 
corrections. You can keep your 
sterile truth for yourself.&quot; Not to 
mention a man named Thomas 
Henry Huxley who, when not in 
the throes of grief or the wars of 
parson hunting, argued that &quot;irra- 
tionally held truths may be more 
harmful than reasoned errors.&quot; 

Stephen Jay Gould teaches biol- 
ogy, geology, and the history of 
science at Harvard University.

Blackouts and Births 

by Janos Balog 



April marks the ninth month 
after New York City&apos;s 
1977 blackout. Can we 
expect a baby boom? 

April 1978 is the ninth month 
following the blackout that began in 
New York City during the evening 
of July 14, 1977. In early August 
1966, nine months after the black- 
out that began on November 9, 
1965, and lasted up to ten hours, 
New York City supposedly ex- 
perienced a &quot;baby boom,&quot; a 30 
percent increase in live births. Can 
we expect a similar boom in births 
this month? I think such an expec- 
tation is unrealistic because it is 
based on the assumption that when 
people are confronted by a dramatic 
historical or natural event that cur- 
tails their usual activities, copula- 
tion increases, resulting in a higher 
birth rate nine months later. (Birth 
occurs 270 days after the mother&apos;s 
last ovulation or 282 days from her 
last menstrual period.) Even if in- 
creased coitus does take place, it 
does not necessarily result in a 
higher birth rate. 

On August 10, 1966 (270 days 
after the 1965 blackout), the front 
page of the New York Times an- 
nounced that six hospitals in New 
York City had reported &quot;a sharp 
increase&quot; in births. At some hos- 
pitals, the baby boom continued 
for as long as a week. Various 
social scientists and doctors were 
asked to explain the phenomenon, 
and one sociologist opined, &quot;The 
lights went out and people were 
left to interact with each other.&quot; 

In a follow-up article on August 
1 1, the Times reported that embrac- 
ing couples had been found pre- 
served in the ashes of Pompeii, 
then quoted a new father who had 
been in New York during the 1965 
blackout: &quot;Everyone needed to 



be reassured.&quot; Births were re- 
ported normal in suburban New 
York, many of whose commuters 
had been stranded in the city. 

This story said that according 
to the National Office of Vital Sta- 
tistics, fertility rates rose sharply 
nine months after such national and 
international crises as Pearl Harbor 
and the outbreak of the Korean 
War. The relevance of this finding 
seems unclear because the agency 
also said that births had dropped 
nine months after President Ken- 
nedy&apos;s assassination. 

In 1970, statistician J. Richard 
Udry, using New York City De- 
partment of Health figures, tried to 
debunk the so-called baby boom. 
He reasoned that if an unusually 
large number of conceptions had 
taken place on November 10, 1965, 
almost all of the resultant births 
would have occurred between June 
27 and August 14, 1966. Therefore, 
that period would include a greater 
percentage of the year&apos;s births than 
the same period in other years. 
But as Udry checked births be- 
tween June 27 and August 14 in 
the five years preceding 1966, he 
found that 1966 had not been un- 
usual. From 1961 through 1966, 
August births consistently consti- 
tuted between 13.9 and 14.1 per- 
cent of the total annual number of 
live births. 

On August 10, 1966, there were 
455 live births, which was not par- 
ticularly unusual for the month, 
during which daily births ranged 
from a low of 344 to a high of 508. 
Udry concluded that the New York 
baby boom of 1966 was a fallacy 
but that statistical analysis is too 
bloodless to defeat the pleasing 
fantasy that &quot;when people are 
trapped by some immobilizing 
event . . . most will turn to copula- 
tion.&quot; He noted that nine months 
after the massive snowfall in Chi- 



cago in the winter of 1967, local 
hospitals were prepared for &quot;an 
avalanche of &apos;snow babies&apos; &quot; that 
never materialized. 

We can add to Udry&apos;s figures the 
possibility that on August 10, 1966, 
more births occurred at some New 
York hospitals because of unknown 
factors that brought to term an in- 
creased number of conceptions 
from dates other than November 
10, 1965. We know little about the 
mechanism that triggers labor, and 
besides, there is no real reason why 
a blackout, even if associated with 
increased coitus, should lead to 
significantly more conception, un- 
less, as one doctor facetiously 
suggested, people had trouble find- 
ing their contraceptives in the dark. 

We do know that sperm normally 
lives for about three days, and if 
we go by Kinsey&apos;s finding that the 
average married couple engages in 
coitus 2 to 2.5 times a week, we 
can assume that under normal 
marital conditions, the female 
genital tract is reasonably well 
saturated with sperm throughout 
the month, well prepared for the 
ovum whenever ovulation may 
occur. Chances are that an increase 
in coitus on a given day, even in a 
city of about IV2 million people, 
would not substantially increase the 
conception rate. 

But there was an increase in the 
birth rate in 1942, nine months 
after Pearl Harbor (December 7, 
1941), and this is often cited as 
proof that increased coitus does 
boost births. However, we must 
take into account the atmosphere 
of national emergency that pre- 
vailed at the time of Pearl Harbor. 
Young people who, complying with 
forties morals, had previously 
avoided premarital affairs, may 
have engaged in coitus because 
they anticipated the draft and al- 
most immediate separation. This

A fascinating 
adventure. 

&quot;Do not limit your thought to one 
brief life and one earth&apos;,&apos; Parama- 
hansa Yogananda said. &quot;You are here 
for only a little while, then depart for 
a dissimilar and fascinating world. 
Remember the vastness of the Spirit 
that dwells within you. Try to realize 
you are a divine traveler.&quot; 

The awakening of such an under- 
standing helps you to discover your 
true place in the great adventure of 
life. The key to this understanding 
is meditation. It shows you through 
personal experience that you are far 
more than a physical vehicle. 
Through steady practice of scientific 
techniques you perceive your body, 
mind, and feelings as but temporary 
instruments for the expression 
of your real nature— ever existing, 
ever conscious, ever new joy 

For more than half a century, Self- 
Realization Fellowship, founded by 
Paramahansa Yogananda, has of- 
fered a program of self-development 
that helps you achieve — through 
meditation and life-force control — 
energy, wisdom, peace, and inner 
happiness.

sort of doomsday coitus among one 
segment of the population could 
have contributed significantly to 
the higher birth rate nine months 
later. I doubt that there was an 
increased incidence of conception 
among Americans who were al- 
ready cohabiting. 

To understand why frequency of 
coitus and a high birth rate are 
not necessarily related, we must 
consider the physiology of pro- 
creation in human beings. By the 
early part of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, scientists had already de- 
termined that in order to conceive, 
a woman must first ovulate. But 
only relatively recently, in 1930. 
was the timing of ovulation estab- 
lished — midway through a wom- 
an&apos;s menstrual cycle or fourteen 
days before her next period. Given 
that most women ovulate regularly 
once a month, on a day that has 
nothing to do with the day or days 
of coitus, then on any day of the 
month, only one woman in twenty- 
eight is ovulating. In this case, a 
higher birth rate after dramatic 
events is diflRcult to accept. 

If the birth rate increases sig- 
nificantly on a specific day, how- 
ever, we must make two assump- 
tions: ovulation must have occurred 
in addition to normal, midcycle 
ovulation, and this paracyclic ovu- 
lation must have coincided with 
coitus. There are, in fact, many 
incidents of conception that do 
seem to have occurred outside of 
midcycle ovulation. The best 
known example is the high failure 
rate of the rhythm method. The 
pregnancy rate after rape is also 
relatively high, and studies from 
the two world wars indicate that 
the incidence of pregnancy result- 
ing from married soldiers&apos; one- or 
two-day leaves is above average, 
considering the number of wives 
likely to be ovulating in midcycle. 

These births may result from 
normal ovulation occurring on an 
unexpected day, early or late in 
the menstrual cycle, or from addi- 
tional ovulation during the same 
cycle. The normal human menstrual 
cycle is twenty-eight days, but no 
woman is always regular. Cycles 
as short as twenty-one days or as 
long as thirty-five are not unusual. 
The cycle starts with about five 
days of menstruation, followed by a 
proliferative, or follicular, phase; 
then a secretory, or luteal, phase 
that lasts until the next period. 

After midcycle ovulation, the 



ovum can probably be fertilized 
for only about one day. In most 
women, the time of ovulation is 
fairly constant. In women with 
irregular menstrual cycles, the date 
of ovulation is uncertain because 
the follicular phase lasts longer; 
the luteal phase, however, tends to 
remain about fourteen days long. 

When the follicular phase begins, 
the endometrium (the inner lining 
of the uterus) is thin and the ovary 
is inactive. The pituitary gland, 
situated in a small recess at the 
base of the skull, secretes gonado- 
tropic hormones that stimulate a 
follicle in one ovary to ripen. This 
Graafian, or maturing, follicle 
contains the ovum, surrounded by 
a group of smaller cells called 
granulosa cells. These multiply 
and secrete an estrogenic hormone 
that causes the endometrium to 
grow thicker. 

When ovulation occurs, the fol- 
licle discharges the ovum into the 
Fallopian tube, through which it 
travels to the uterus. After ovula- 
tion, the granulosa cells — which 
line the follicle that the ovum has 
left — accumulate yellow lipids and 
are known as lutein cells. The 
follicle, now called the corpus lu- 
teum, continues to secrete estro- 
gens and also begins to secrete 
progesterone, which induces the 
secretory phase in the endome- 
trium. If the ovum is fertilized, it 
embeds itself in the endometrium 
and starts to grow. If the ovum 
remains unfertilized and dies, the 
corpus luteum degenerates and 
ceases to produce hormones. At 
this point, all but the basal layer 
of the endometrium breaks down 
and is shed in menstruation. The 
endometrium&apos;s residual layer re- 
generates during the follicular 
phase of the next cycle. 

Although normal midcycle ovu- 
lation is occasionally early or 
late, clinical and experimental 
evidence suggests the existence of 
paracyclic ovulation. Some sup- 
porters of paracyclic ovulation 
postulate that it is provoked by 
psychosomatic influences, such as 
stress, and that since during coitus 
the female usually experiences 
some degree of mental and physical 
stress, human coitus may induce 
ovulation. In some animals, in- 
cluding the rabbit, the hare, and the 
rat, ovulation follows coitus.

ovulation exists, I am not con-

BMW WILL NEVER BUILD A 

aMn/ENTKHULLUXURYSEDAN 

BECAUSE NO ONE AT BMW 

COUU) BEAR TO DRIVE ONL 



INTRODUCING THE BMW 733i . 

In the sedate and somewhat stuffy 
world of the very expensive luxury sedan 
the BMW 733i is indeed rare. 

While most of the world&apos;s automakers 
are apparently quite content to produce 
solidly engineered, elegantly appointed, 
carefully crafted carnages for the gentry, 
we at the Bavanan Motor Works are not 

ig 1978 BMW of Norlh America, Inc 



so easily satisfied. 

Racing engineers by nature and by 
profession, it has long been our conten- 
tion that, while the pursuit of luxury is no 
vice, extraordinary performance is the 
only thing that makes an expensive car 
worth the money 

. So, while the BMW 733i provides all 
the creature comforts one could sanely 



require of an automobile— supple leather, 
full-power accessones, etc.— it provides a 
driving expenence so unusual, so exhila- 
rating it will spoil you for any other car 
A GAIN IN SIZE WITH 
NO SACRIFICE IN PERFORMANCE . 
The genius of the BMW 733i lies not 
in the fact that it is— by European stan- 
dards— large and luxunous. 




The technical feat involved here is 
that the engineers at BMW have man- 
aged to incorporate the aforementioned 
qualities into a car that retains the per- 
formance characteristics of a BMW 

Under the hood of the 733i is the 
same basic engine that powers the BMW 
race cars. A 3.3-liter, electronically fuel- 
injected masterpiece of engineering that 
the editors of Road&amp;Track magazine 
unequivocally call, &quot;...the most refined 
in-line six in the world.&quot; 

Its four speed manual transmission 
(automatic is available) slips precisely 
into each gear Its acceleration comes up 
smoothly, with the turbine-like whine pe- 
culiar to BMW. 

Its suspension system— independent 
on all four wheels, with a new and 
patented &quot;double-pivot&quot; front geometry 
—IS astonishingly quick and clean through 
the corners. 

And, rather than reduce or distort 



dnver &quot;road feel&quot;— as do the steering sys- 
tems found in many of today&apos;s passive 
luxury sedans— the suspension system of 
the BMW 733i is designed to provide the 
dnver, through the steenng wheel, with 
instant, precise information at all times, 
under all conditions. 

THE INTEGRATION OF MAN 
AND MACHINE . 

While the intenor of the conventional 
luxury sedan is deliberately planned to 
isolate the driver from the world outside, 
the road beneath and the mechanical 
functionings of the car, the intenor of the 
BMW 733i IS biomechanically engineered 
to literally include the driver as one of the 
functioning parts of the car 

The driver&apos;s seat is adjustable for both 
seat angle and height. 

All instruments and controls are stra- 
tegically positioned to help avoid even a 
split-second loss of concentration. 

Pedal direction and pedal pressure 



have been carefully balanced to reduce 
fatigue and facilitate effortless gear 
changing. 

So successfully is this integration of 
man and machine accomplished that, 
when you dnve the BMW 733i for the 
first time, you will expenence an almost 
total oneness with the car 

As the editors of Motor Trend maga- 
zine once observed, &quot;The reaction to a 
BMW IS always the same. The first time 
driver takes the wheel and after a few 
minutes no other automobile will ever be 
the same again.&quot;

intrigues you, call us anytime, toll-free,

vinced that it can be induced. Stress 
generally has a conserving eflfect on 
bodily functions, enabling a person 
to respond with greater efficiency 
to demanding stimuli. Amenorrhea 
in first-year college students (and 
in concentration camp inmates) 
shows that stress has anovulatory 
eflFects. Stress or the physical im- 
pact of coitus could hasten ovula- 
tion by rupturing a Graafian follicle , 
but could not hasten an unripe 
follicle&apos;s development so that it 
could produce an ovum. 

Paracyclic ovulation probably 
occurs at regular intervals, gov- 
erned by biorhythms that are still 
unfamiliar to us. This mechanism 
may differ entirely from that of 
midcycle ovulation. On the other 
hand, it may be marked by the same 
hormonal changes, but the hor- 
mones may occur in smaller quan- 
tities, so that their workings may 
be masked by those connected 
with midcycle ovulation. 

Although we know little about 
paracyclic ovulation, we do have 
some direct evidence of its exis- 
tence. During an autopsy on a 
female body, one investigator found 
two follicles of differing ages. One 
was freshly ruptured; the other was 
a corpus luteum. Obviously, two 
ovulations had occurred at separate 
times in the same month. Another 
researcher concluded from obser- 
vations made during surgical pro- 
cedures that ovulation can occur 
on any day of the follicular phase. 
And as recently as April 1977, 
there was a report of a patient with 
both an intrauterine and a tubal 
ectopic pregnancy. The intrauterine 
gestation was twenty-one days 
old and the tubal twelve. The pa- 
tient&apos;s doctors concluded that she 
must have ovulated twice during 
the same cycle. 

Indirect evidence of the existence 
of paracyclic ovulation is less pre- 
cise, yet worth considering. Con- 
ception during amenorrhea has 
been frequently reported but is 
actually weak support for para- 
cyclic ovulation. Conception in 
such instances may have resulted 
from either midcycle or paracyclic 
ovulation, whichever came first. 

A more positive argument is the 
claim of many pregnant patients 
that they conceived at a time other 
than that calculated by their doc- 
tors on the basis of the women&apos;s 
last menstrual periods. These 
reports have attracted little atten- 



tion; instead, the patients&apos; reliabil- 
ity has usually been questioned. 
Many births deviate from doctors&apos; 
estimated dates of confinement, 
perhaps because of human variety 
or perhaps because conception oc- 
curred at a different time from that 
indicated by the last menstrual 
period. 

Paracyclic ovulation would ex- 
plain the frequent discrepancy be- 
tween the laboratory test for fetal 
maturity, the estimated date of 
confinement, and the actual de- 
livery. According to one calcula- 
tion, the chance of conception on 
the fourth day of the menstrual 
cycle is as high as 10 percent. If 
conception can occur on the fourth 
day in 10 percent of all women, the 
estimated date of confinement 
could be incorrect by ten days in 
10 percent of all pregnancies. Thus, 
a baby born twenty days early, in 
the thirty-seventh week of gesta- 
tion, might incorrectly be consid- 
ered premature. These inaccuracies 
can have important clinical conse- 
quences: an inducement or Caes- 
arean section might be unneces- 
sarily postponed as premature. 

Another instance in which para- 
cyclic ovulation can cause mistakes 
is the practice of the rhythm 
method of birth control. A woman 
using the rhythm method monitors 
her basal body temperature and as- 
sumes that unless it drops slightly, 
indicating ovulation, she can en- 
gage in coitus without risk of preg- 
nancy. Unfortunately, this means 
of birth control is notoriously un- 
reliable. A British study concluded 
that rhythm&apos;s many failures are 
due to the occurrence of paracyclic 
ovulation, mainly in the follicular 
phase of a woman&apos;s cycle. 

If ovulation only occurs in mid- 
cycle, the distribution of births 
around the estimated date of con- 
finement, allowing for prematurity 
and postmaturity, should be a sym- 
metrical bell-shaped curve. Fifty 
percent of babies would be born 
on or before their due date, and 
50 percent on or after. But the 
great majority of babies are born 
earlier, rather than later, skewing 
the distribution curve to the left 
and confirming the British con- 
clusion that paracyclic ovulation 
(and conception outside the mid- 
cycle) occurs in the first two weeks 
after the menstrual period.

OPERATION DOUBLE 
IN THE MIIKATLANTK 



Even to the people who live on the 
East Coast, the Great American Forest 
is &quot;somewhere out West.&quot; So if you think 
the Mid-Atlantic States are mostly paved 
over, you&apos;re not alone. 

But the fact is, well over half of our 
forests today are east of the Mississippi. 
New Jersey, for example, is the most 
densely populated state in the Union. 
Yet more than half of it is still forested. 

The Mid-Atlantic forests have not 
only survived, they&apos;re thriving, thanks 
to the innate resiliency of Mother Nature. 

They&apos;re among the most varied and 
valuable forests in the world. With a 
wealth of hardwoods — more than 150 
species in all. And an abundance of fast- 
growing softwoods. 

These are the most-used forests in 
our country&apos;s history — reborn five times 
over in the last 250 years alone. 

In the 1700s they were pushed 
back to make way for the birth of a 



Operation Double Tree: Why 
it&apos;s needed and how it works. 

In the U.S. alone, the demand 
for wood and paper products is ex- 
pected to double in less than 50 years. 

Yet today, only about one-third of 
this country&apos;s total forest is used to 
grow repeated crops of timber 

INCREASED DEMAND AND LOSS OF 
COMMERCIAL FORESTLAND&apos; 



(MILLION ACRES) 



That works out to about one acre 
of trees for every man, woman and 
child. And each of those acres will 
have to be carefully managed to pro- 
vide a lifetime supply of wood products. 

Thus the reason behind Operation 
Double Tree — the forest industry&apos;s 
name for intensive forest management 
that can double the amount of wood 
grown on the nation&apos;s productive for- 
estland. And do it in such a way that 
everyone can share in the multiple 
benefits of the forest. Year after year

and hunt. And give us an unending supply 
of the hundreds of wood products we 
use every day. 

In multiple-use forests, all these 
things are possible. And that&apos;s 
the key to the success of 
Operation Double Tree. 

In a hardwood 
forest in West Vir- 
ginia, Westvaco 
Corporation i^ 



is proving that a commercial forest* can 
work to everyone&apos;s benefit. This is an 
example of practical conservation. 

Westvaco foresters have docu- 
mented the forest&apos;s physiography, soil 
and wildlife. Endangered or uncommon 
plants and animals are protected. High- 
lead cables are used to lift out harvested 
trees, which is easier on the soil. And 
whole-tree chippers turn unsightly log- 
ging debris into raw material for paper. 

The result is a forest that provides 
a larger harvest of wood for essential 
paper products and, at the same time, 
offers recreation and scenic beauty. 

A Better Quality Forest. 

Westvaco isn&apos;t the only hard-working 
forest products company in the Mid- 
Atlantic region. Georgia Pacific, Chesa- 
peake Corporation, Glatfelter, Interna- 
tional Paper and Hammermill Paper are 
just a few of the other companies work- 
ing to improve the quality of the forest. 
In Pennsylvania, the P.H. 
Glatfelter Company is 
not only improv- 
ing its ovra&gt;The two

Pennsylvania. The big 

difference is, the larger

area while the smaller one did not.

The Mid-Atlantic is the most densely populated re- 
gion in the country, yet much of it today is still forested 

: land, but showing private landowners 

how to improve theirs. In the last 15 

J years it&apos;s given away millions of seedlings 

1 to these landowners. This is an invest- 

i ; ment in the future for Glatfelter, since it 

S(, depends on these private forests for 

i- i most of its wood resources. 

I- &apos; I Like so many other 

1- &apos; , companies today, 

Glatfelter is 

looking in 

unlikely 

places 



for new sources of wood. More than a 
third of the chips it uses are sawmill 
waste that was left to rot up until a few 
years ago. 

Recycling New From Old. 

Recycling is one way to double our 
forest resources by using them twice. 
It&apos;s a particularly important concept in 
the densely populated Mid-Atlantic re- 
gion, where the demand for forest pro- 
ducts is high. 

One good example of recycling is 

the Garden State Paper Company in 

New Jersey, which turns yesterday&apos;s old 

newspapers into tomorrow&apos;s newsprint. 

In Pennsylvania, St. Regis Paper 

Company produces 350 

tons of recycled 

paperboard 

each day 



from used corrugated containers, old 
newspapers and office memos. 

So there&apos;s progress with Operation 
Double Tree in the Mid-Atlantic, and in 
forests all across the country. But we 
still have a long way to go. 





The hardwoods from this region provide a wealth of 
fine furniture. 



On the average, industry lands grow 
50 percent more wood than the lands 
owned by government and private indi- 
viduals. Yet, even here, there&apos;s room for 
improvement. 

But working together, all tim- 
ber growers — private owners, 
industry and government — can 
learn to make the most pro- 
ductive use of our remaining 
commercial forests. 

Industry has invested 
millions to make the con- 
cept a reality. But money 
isn&apos;t enough. 

Leaders and land- 
ovmers alike must under- 
stand the problem. And, 
more important, the solu- 
tion.

rape offer an excellent opportunity 
to study paracyclic ovulation. A 
post-World War II German study 
found that in such cases, 39 per- 
cent of all conceptions took place 
during the follicular phase, sup- 
posedly before midcycle ovula- 
tion; 20 percent during the luteal 
phase, supposedly after mid- 
cycle ovulation; and 8 percent dur- 
ing menstruation. If we accept the 
patients&quot; reports of the dates of 
rape and of their last menstrual 
periods, this study makes a strong 
case for the existence of paracyclic 
ovulation. 

We do not really know whether 
paracyclic ovulation is spontaneous 
or coitus induced. Supporters of 
human reflex ovulation believe 
that it is caused by nervous and 
biochemical interactions during 
coitus. Exogenous prostaglandin, 
supplied by the male&apos;s ejaculation, 
is thought to cause the ovary&apos;s 
smooth muscles to contract. These 
contractions, combined with coital 
pressure on the follicle, supposedly 
release the ovum. 

However, reflex ovulation re- 
mains controversial because with- 
out coitus ovulation can and does 
occur spontaneously every month. 
In animals that are reflex ovula- 
tors, the Graafian follicle ripens in 
a considerably shorter time. Coitus 
can hasten ovulation because a 
Graafian follicle on the brink of 
maturity is available more often. 

In a human, coitus would have 
to speed up the ripening of a Graaf- 
ian follicle — which normally re- 
quires about fourteen days to de- 
velop — so that conception could 
take place within twenty-four hours 
or so. If coital stress did release 
an ovum, there is a good chance 
that it would be unripe. Overripe 
ova, whether preovulatory because 
of delayed follicular rupture or 
postovuiatory due to delayed union 
with sperm, are known to result 
in fetal abnormalities. An unripe 
ovum may have the same unhappy 
consequences. But among babies 
conceived during the follicular 
phase, there is no increased in- 
cidence of abnormalities. 

Both midcycle and paracyclic 
ovulation definitely occur regard- 
less of coitus, and successful arti- 
ficial insemination outside of the 
midcycle has been reported. This 
is a strong argument against coitus- 
induced ovulation, unless any 
manipulation of female genitalia.

A 



including pelvic examinations, can 
trigger the neurohormonal reflex 
that induces ovulation. In cattle, 
such stimulation releases oxytocin, 
a hormone that induces cramping 
of smooth muscle, but no one has 
demonstrated that ovulation def- 
initely follows. 

One thought on the relation be- 
tween coitus and ovulation comes 
down to us from the ancient Chi- 
nese, who believed that if a woman 
remained passive or distracted 
during coitus, she could not con- 
ceive. We do not know whether 
such a woman would be preventing 
coitus-induced ovulation. She 
would certainly be avoiding or- 
gasm, which may facilitate sperm 
movement and relax the Fallopian 
tubes. But the element of truth in 
the Chinese belief is canceled out 
by the success of artificial insem- 
ination, the large number of multi- 
parous women who have never 
experienced orgasm, and pregnan- 
cies resulting from rape. 

Ovulation must be preceded by 
an increased output of gonado- 
tropic hormones, which presum- 
ably could be measured after 
coitus. But a 1974 study found that 
the levels of these follicle-stimulat- 
ing hormones remained the same 
after coitus, disproving, as far as 
I am concerned, the possibility of 
coitus-induced ovulation. Coitus 
may hasten ovulation, but cannot 
induce it. There is no reason to 
believe that increased coitus, even 
allowing for paracyclic ovulation, 
should lead to increased concep- 
tion. Hence, I predict no increase 
in the birth rate in New York in 
April 1978, nine months after the 
blackout of July 14, 1977. 

Of course, as we saw in the case 
of Pearl Harbor, we will have to 
allow for exogenous factors. The 
1965 blackout took place in the 
winter, whereas the 1977 incident 
befell the city during a record- 
breaking heat wave. Without air 
conditioning, many people may 
have preferred to sleep alone. Since 
the New York City Department of 
Health&apos;s Bureau of Records and 
Statistics plans to monitor births in 
April, we will soon know for a 
second time — in figures, at least — 
whether high birth rates after black- 
outs are reality or rumor.

The Serendipitous Mouse 

by Paul K. Anderson 



A breeding strategy in which 
many surplus offspring are 
available to emigrate to 
man-altered environments 
has helped make the house 
mouse a human commensal 

Human environmental disturb- 
ances over the past few centuries 
have wreaked havoc on many life 
forms, propelling some species 
toward extinction. But a handful 
have actually benefited from man&apos;s 
interference with natural ecosys- 
tems. Such species have in recent 
times increased in numbers, ex- 
panded their geographic distribu- 
tions, and established populations 
in habitats that are physically and 
biologically different from those of 
their ancestors. 

I have studied such an animal — 
the house mouse — to learn what 
about its biology permitted its ex- 
ceptional exploitation of opportu- 
nities arising out of the changing 
conditions of the recent past. 

House mice still inhabit the arid 
steppes of central Asia where the 
species is believed to have evolved. 
There, like many another rodent, 
they forage for small seeds and 
insects. Presumably it was in this 
ancestral region that house mice 
first established a closer associa- 
tion with man than have other seed- 
gathering rodents. The oldest re- 
mains of house mice have been 
found in association with human 
fossils in Pleistocene deposits on 
the floors of Crimean caves. 

The ability of house mice to co- 
exist with human beings — to exploit 
man-altered and man-created habi- 
tats and to disperse by riding man&apos;s 
vehicles — has led to the establish- 
ment of populations under physical 
conditions, and in association with 



38 



groups of other species, vastly dif- 
ferent from those of the ancestral 
steppe. House mice now inhabit 
coconut groves on Guam (13°27&apos; 
north latitude) and penguin rook- 
eries on Macquarie Island (54°30&apos; 
south latitude). They shelter in the 
equatorial lava flows of the Gala- 
pagos and in the concrete laby- 
rinths of the world&apos;s large cities. 
Some populations inhabit cold- 
storage plants where the tempera- 
ture is always well below freezing 
and the darkness nearly continu- 
ous, others occupy the hot tropical 
deserts of north-central Australia, 
and still others the mist-shrouded 
cliffs of the Shetland Islands. 

The colonizing ability of the 
house mouse is, of course, not un- 
limited. For example, over large 
continental areas the species is 
most likely to be found in recently 
or perennially disturbed locales, 
such as agricultural fields, and less 
likely to become established where 
the native vegetation is undis- 
turbed. But numerous other small, 
omnivorous rodents have not 
shown any similar expansion, and 
my research premise has been that 
house mice are exceptional colon- 
izers. 

I first began to study house mice 
in 1959, in two quite dissimilar en- 
vironments. One population inhab- 
ited Great Gull Island, site of an 
abandoned army fort, off the north- 
ern tip of Long Island and about 
seven miles south of New London, 
Connecticut. The seventeen-acre 
island was covered with grassland 
and scattered shrubs; its shore- 
line stabilized by a covering of trap- 
rock. There are no permanent hu- 
man inhabitants. I also studied two 
groups of mice in elaborate labora- 
tory population cages, which I had 
constructed at Columbia Uni- 



versity&apos;s Nevis Biological Station. 
Each population cage had a floor 
area of 288 square feet. 

One objective of the population 
cage study was to investigate the 
possibility that the structural com- 
plexity of occupied space signifi- 
cantly influences the behavior and 
population dynamics of house mice. 
At the time, there was a good deal 
of interest in the hypothesis that the 
size of mouse populations is limited 
by physiological (adrenal stress) 
responses to high density. I sus- 
pected that in previously published 
experiments the space in which 
mice had been confined was not 
sufficiently complex in structure to 
permit the animals to interact nor- 
mally. If this was so, the behavioral 
and physiological phenomena at- 
tributed to a density of a particular 
number of mice per square foot 
probably reflected abnormal social 
interactions, rather than a normal 
response to crowding. With this in 
mind, I built each cage eight-stories 
high, with 128 compartments. 
Forty-eight compartments opened 
to externally attached nest boxes, 
while the remaining eighty con- 
tained supplies of food and water. 
All of the compartments were inter- 
connected, but in such a way that 
movement through the cage re- 
quired many twists and turns, and 
small mice had access to passages 
too small for larger mice. 

I censused my cages every three 
weeks and recorded the location of 
the nest box occupied by each indi- 
vidual. Initially, the population of 
each cage was held at 66 weaned 
individuals (excess mice were ran- 
domly removed at the end of each 
census). If each cage had been a 
simple open pen with the same floor 
area, behavioral and physiological 
evidences of crowding would have

These granaries on the Canadian 
prairie each maintain a steady 
population of about ten mice 
by emigration of the young 
and rejection of immigrants. 



been predicted for such a popula- 
tion density. In the complex, struc- 
tured cages this did not occur. 

My next step was to allow the 
population in one cage to double in 
size, while maintaining the complex 
environmental structuring. In this 
cage of 132 weaned individuals, be- 
havior, reproduction, and longevity 
remained normal. In the second 
cage the population was held at the 
original level of 66 mice, but hinged 
partitions between the compart- 
ments were, swung up against the 
ceiling, converting the 128 small 
compartments into 16 long, narrow 
rooms. The mice responded by an 
increase in the frequency of aggres- 
sive interactions, such as chasing 
and fighting. The death rate and the 
frequency of escapes from the cage 
rose rapidly and drastically, and 
both were concentrated in the ju- 
venile age group. 

By allowing the population in the 
first cage to double, I reinforced my 
argument that structural complexity 
in the habitat was important to the 
normal operation of mouse society. 
By simplifying the environment in 
the other cage, I demonstrated the 
same point in another way. Also, 
simplifying the environment (in- 
creasing the effective density) re- 
sulted in social pressure against 
juvenile mice, which responded by 
attempting to leave the cage. 

Other interesting observations of 
house mouse behavior were im- 
portant to an understanding of the 
social structure of this species. 
Even within the small space of the

mice are potential colonizers.

island, three of four annual 
litters were nonreproductive . 



cages, the mice were active only in 
a part of the available space; that is, 
they had home ranges. Also, with 
few exceptions, two adult males 
never occurred simultaneously in a 
nest box. Each adult male patrolled 
and defended a territory and the 
nest boxes within it. 

During the three years in which 
I worked on Great Gull Island, the 
yearly average of resident house 
mice was about 140, with early 
spring numbers as few as 76 and 
late summer highs up to 497. Since 
the social structure in the Great 
Gull Island environment was sim- 
ilar to that observed in the cages, 
this illustrates the considerable 
range of population density over 
which house mice can maintain a 
particular set of social behaviors. 
The significance of this social struc- 
ture becomes clearer when ob- 
served in the island context. 

On Great Gull Island the mice 
occupied the grassland and the 
boulder-covered shoreline, shun- 
ning the abandoned fortifications 
and ruined buildings. Food sources 
were widely scattered. In summer, 
seeds and insects were available in 
the grassland. The year-round 
staple, and the only major winter 
food source, was the amphipod 
crustacean population in the beach 
wrack. 

Through live trapping and re- 
cording the tracks of toe-clipped 
individuals, the movements of indi- 
vidual mice on the island were 
mapped. Adults of each sex occu- 
pied stable home ranges, about 50 
yards across, which they defended 
as territories. Fighting between 
mice was infrequent. There was 
only occasional overlap of home 
ranges among adult females and 
practically none among the home 
ranges of adult males. Home range 
occupancy had a seasonal pattern, 
apparently in response to food 
availability. By early spring the 
home ranges of overwintering mice 
had contracted to the shoreline. 
Each range subsequently expanded 
into the grassland by early summer. 

Reproduction begins on Great 
Gull Island in May and lasts into 
September. As the young mice ma- 
ture they pass through a wandering 
stage in which they may travel the 
entire 2,400-foot length of the island 



in a single night. I interpret this as 
the more normal outcome of the 
kind of social pressures that were 
triggered when I simplified the pop- 
ulation cage environment. On the 
island it had some interesting con- 
sequences. 

Males that had survived the win- 
ter were occupying breeding terri- 
tories by May. Young were born 
almost entirely in such territories. 
Most of the mice born in spring and 
summer, especially the males, 
ended their wandering phase in 
certain areas of the island where 
reproduction never occurred. The 
areas where the wanderers accumu- 
lated could therefore be viewed as 
&quot;behavioral sinks,&quot; which ab- 
sorbed the bulk of the young born 
in the early and middle portions of 
the breeding season. Since they 
failed to reproduce, these young 
were a &quot;surplus&quot; population in the 
island context. 

The breeding adults died off each 
winter and were replaced. It ap- 
pears that the replacements came, 
not from the wanderers accumu- 
lated in the behavioral sinks, but 
from the late-season litters; it also 
appears that the replacements were 
those members of last-born litters 
that had not only overwintered suc- 
cessfully but had also inherited 
parental home ranges. Such inherit- 
ance has been observed in a seed- 
storing race of house mice that in- 
habit eastern Europe. There a 
year&apos;s supply of weed seeds is 
stored in an earth-covered hillock 
by the parents and inherited by 
some of their last-born young. 

There is genetic evidence for this 
kind of home-range inheritance on 
Great Gull Island. In 1957, a Co- 
lumbia University research group 
headed by L.C. Dunn released six 
male house mice at the eastern end 
of the island; each was a carrier 
for the same mutant allele. This 
allele had not been found in the 
resident island population. A 
mouse inheriting this allele from 
both parents dies before birth, but 
a carrier male transmits the allele 
to 95 percent of his offspring. At 
least one of the introduced carrier 
males bred successfully, for in the 
fall of 1959 I discovered that the 
introduced allele was common 
among a group of mice at the is- 



41 




land&apos;s eastern end. What was most 
interesting, however, was that it 
was common only in that group, 
despite the island-wide wandering 
of the spring- and summer-born 
young. The restricted distribution 
of the allele persisted at least 
through 1967, probably because the 
mice that carried the population 
through the winter and bred the 
next season were exclusively those 
that had inherited the parental 
home ranges and not those that 
wandered. 

To gain a little more insight into 
the spatial distribution of reproduc- 
tive activity, I plotted the locations 
of natal sites, together with the 
home ranges of breeding adult 
males and females. This produced a 
pattern of small breeding groups, 
each occupying a favorable section 
of habitat. In contrast, nonbreeders 
were concentrated in a major be- 
havioral sink in the center of the 
island (an area of dense, damp 
grass), with a few scattered in inter- 
stices among the breeding group 
areas. 

It may seem wasteful of repro- 
ductive effort for a Great Gull 
Island female to produce four litters 
when the offspring of the first three 
merely drift into behavioral sinks 
and die without reproducing. In a 
non-island situation, however, 
these individuals would have been 
potential colonizers. Thus, at least 
75 percent of the reproductive effort 
would have been devoted to coloni- 
zation. Departure of the wanderers 
also insured that a relatively low 
population density was maintained 
at the parental site, even though 
food might be temporarily abun- 
dant. 

I had an opportunity to explore 
these phenomena further in 1961 
when I moved to the University of 
Calgary. Calgary is at the western 
edge of the Canadian prairie grain- 
lands, and there I found well-defined 
breeding groups of house mice with 
unlimited food supplies. The grain, 
which is brought in from the fields 
in late summer and early fall, is 
traditionally stored in small, 
wooden granaries 12 to 14 feet on a 
side. When filled to the eaves with 
loose grain in which the mice can- 
not burrow, such a building pro- 
vides a structurally simple space, a 



virtually unlimited food supply, and 
protection from predators, wind, 
and precipitation. Grain may be 
stored in such a building for a 
period varying from a few months 
to several years, during which pe- 
riod a colonizing house mouse pop- 
ulation enjoys great security and 
reproduces continually, even dur- 
ing the coldest days of the Canadian 
winter. Based on the structurally 
simple population cage experiments 
of the 1950s, population growth 
should continue under these condi- 
tions until halted by abnormal be- 
havior and physiological stress at a 
level of about 1 ,000 mice per gra- 
nary. In fact, the number of mice in- 
habiting such buildings, even after 
several years, is about ten. The cru- 
cial difference is that the mice have 
an opportunity to emigrate. 

Further, each granary is de- 
fended by the resident adults as a 
shared group territory. Immigra- 
tion, even of mice from another 
granary as little as three feet away, 
is not tolerated. Intruders experi- 
mentally introduced into a granary 
are attacked and ejected if they do 
not escape on their own before 
being discovered. 

These characteristics of the gra- 
nary populations, with their readily 
recognizable boundaries, display 
more clearly what was happening 
in the grassland of Great Gull Is- 
land. Specifically, I suggest that 
house mice organize themselves, to 
the extent a given situation will 
permit, into small and exclusive 
breeding groups that maintain low 
density by sending surplus indi- 
viduals out to colonize and by re- 
pelling would-be immigrants. This 
behavioral structuring of house 
mouse populations occasionally 
breaks down, for example, in lab- 
oratory pens where there is no op- 
portunity for emigration. Under 
these circumstances, it is not sur- 
prising to find that behaviors that 
usually function to stimulate emi- 
gration have pathological social 
and physiological consequences. 
(Breakdown of social structuring 
has also been reported in free-living 
populations. While the circum- 
stances are not clear, such break- 
downs have usually been observed 
in large areas of superabundant 
food, such as agricultural fields.) 



No habitat is perpetually secure. 
Even a granary population faces 
eventual disaster. When grain is 
removed the abundant food supply 
suddenly vanishes. The security 
provided by the full granary with 
its closed doors is lost as the doors 
of the emptied building are left 
open to access by cats, dogs, pred- 
atory birds, skunks, and weasels. 

I refer to the house mouse as a 
serendipitous animal. Serendipity 
is an apparent aptitude for making 
fortunate discoveries accidentally. 
The environments exploited so ef- 
fectively by the house mouse share 
a high degree of unpredictability: 
granaries may be emptied; agricul- 
tural fields harvested. Steppes are 
subject to drought, grazing, and 
fire. Then again, granaries are sud- 
denly filled with grain, fields are 
planted, and steppes sometimes 
abound in seed crops. 

Behaviors that maintain small, 
discrete populations in favorable 
habitats, while generating large 
numbers of emigrants, are well 
suited to this kind of unpredictabil- 
ity. The nature and timing of both 
catastrophes and opportunities for 
colonization are unpredictable. Its 
population structure makes the 
serendipitous mouse well suited for 
making the &quot;fortunate discoveries&quot; 
required for its populations to sur- 
vive catastrophe and exploit oppor- 
tunity. But there may be some- 
thing more than ecological seren- 
dipity involved. 

Over time, a small inbreeding 
population gains a unique genetic 
identity. This is a consequence of 
the small number of original colon- 
ists, the persistent exclusion of im- 
migrants that might introduce al- 
leles, and the small number of 
individuals making up the breeding 
population. Many years ago, the 
population geneticist Sewall Wright 
pointed out that if a species was 
made up of numerous small, re- 



Livestock pellets afford an ample 

food supply for rodents. However, 

because they cannot burrow in 

the loose pile, the storage area 

supports few mice.

productively exclusive groups, it 
would be capable of maximally 
rapid evolutionary change. As in- 
breeding in isolation reduces the 
genetic diversity within groups, it 
increases the diversity between 
groups. The path of evolutionary 
specialization taken by each small 
group would be influenced by 
chance, both in the selection of the 
original founders and the results of 
their matings, and many novel com- 
binations of inherited characteris- 
tics would ensue. 

House mouse population struc- 



ture, particularly as represented in 
the prairie granaries, approximates 
Wright&apos;s model. Among the many 
genetically diverse small popula- 
tions generated, the species would 
have a high potential for producing 
some that were especially well 
equipped, genetically, to survive a 
disaster or exploit a novel oppor- 
tunity. Since chance is very much 
involved in the generation of the 
assortment of available popula- 
tions, this would represent an 
&quot;evolutionary serendipity.&quot; 
In a situation such as 1 have just 



postulated, a given population 
would be competing with other, 
perhaps less well adapted popula- 
tions in establishing &quot;daughter&quot; 
colonies. This implies group selec- 
tion, a frequently resurrected but 
generally unpopular concept among 
evolutionary theorists. A critical 
question is whether the emigrants 
leaving a small breeding group tend 
to mate preferentially with mem- 
bers of their own group. Despite 
several years of experiments, that 
question cannot yet be confidently 
answered. □

Semana Santa in Seville

Holy Week ceremonies in this 
Spanish city recall ancient 
Greek and Roman rites 
of spring 

Each spring during Holy Week, 
from Palm Sunday to Easter Sun- 
day, the Roman Catholic city of 
Seville in southern Spain transforms 
itself into Jerusalem at the time of 
Christ&apos;s passion and death. Week- 
long processions commemorate 
Jesus&apos; death, and his mother&apos;s suf- 
ferings and glory. In ritually reliving 
these holy events, Seville&apos;s citizens 
also emulate pre-Christian Greek 
and Roman rites that welcomed 
back Proserpina and other god- 
desses of spring. The Holy Week 
processions honor both Christ and 
Mary, but the Virgin is the more 
important figure. 

Unlike many other northern Med- 
iterranean cities, Seville keeps its 
past very much alive. Occupied by 
Moorish invaders for 500 years, the 
city rose to prominence in the 1500s 
as Spain&apos;s &quot;port of the Indies,&quot; 
through which all the gold and silver 
from the New World of the Ameri- 
cas passed into Europe. Seville re- 
mains the cultural, symbolic capital 
of Spain&apos;s eight southern Andalu- 
sian provinces. 



During Holy Week, Seville&apos;s 
religious brotherhoods parade 
with their sacred images. Left, 
each brotherhood has at least 
one image of the Virgin. 



Religious processions — public af- 
firmations and demonstrations of 
faith — are common throughout the 
Mediterranean, but none equals the 
flamboyant pageantry of Seville. 
From midafternoon on Palm Sun- 
day to eleven in the evening on 
Holy Saturday, phases of Christ&apos;s 
passion are reenacted in various 
versions of the Stations of the Cross, 
a Roman Catholic penitential prayer 
ritual for Lent. In the traditional 
Stations of the Cross, participants 
recite prayers and meditations and 
sing hymns at fourteen stations, 
each representing a stage in Christ&apos;s 
progress from Pilate&apos;s chambers, 
through the streets of Jerusalem 
with his cross, to Mount Calvary, 
the site of his crucifixion and death. 

In Seville, during Holy Week, 
each of the city&apos;s fifty-three reli- 
gious brotherhoods (cofradias) de- 
parts from its neighborhood church, 
on a prearranged day at a desig- 
nated hour, and parades through 
the streets with life-sized poly- 
chrome figures that represent the 
suflFering Christ alone, the Virgin in 
glory or in suffering, or New Testa- 
ment tableaux, such as the young 
Christ instructing the elders in the 
temple. Most brotherhoods have at 
least two images, one Christ and 
one Virgin. While some of these 
hundred-odd figures are of recent 
origin, made by artisans commis- 
sioned by the brotherhoods, many, 
including one known as &quot;the Sainted 
Christ of the True Cross,&quot; date 
to the 1500s. Most images require 
between twenty-four and thirty-six 
bearers. Some figures weigh nearly 
two tons and must be carried by 
forty-eight men. 



Each procession retraces the 
Stations of the Cross from the steps 
of the brotherhood&apos;s church to the 
last station, &quot;The Cross in the 
Field,&quot; erected in the fourteenth 
century at the northeastern en- 
trance to the old walled city. Then 
the procession winds back to the 
center of Seville; near the court- 
house it passes before the crimson- 
draped reviewing stand crowded 
with wealthy gentry and important 
political personages. The proces- 
sion enters Seville&apos;s great Gothic 
cathedral and, in front of the main 
altar, receives a blessing from the 
cardinal, a bishop, or a priest. 
Afterward, the procession returns 
to the street and heads toward its 
home church. Most processions 
take at least six hours; some last as 
long as ten or twelve hours. 

The climax of Holy Week occurs 
during the predawn hours on Good 
Friday. At that time, joining the 
other parading Christs and Virgins, 
Seville&apos;s two most charismatic 
images emerge from their sanctu- 
aries: the Macarena Virgin, a 200- 
year-old image named for a Roman 
estate where the Virgin supposedly 
appeared in the early Christian era, 
and the image of El Gran Poder, 
meaning Christ the King. 

As spectators wait along the unlit 
streets marking the route off/ Gran 
Poder, the darkness is punctuated 
by glowing cigarette tips. The scent 
of flowers and incense mixes with 
the scent of the onlookers&apos;s sweat 
and perfume. The street underfoot 
is slippery with wax from dripping 
candles carried in previous proces- 
sions.

Macarena Virgin pauses beneath 
a balcony, a singer greets her 
with a saeta, a song of praise. 



lence the shuffling crowd. A row of 
candles, their flames flickering in 
the spring wind, lights up the dark 
turn in the street as the first figures 
of the double file of marchers, 
dressed as penitents and bearing 
large wooden crosses, come into 
view. The penitents wear black silk 
tunics and belts of woven esparto 
grass. Their heads are concealed by 
soft black hoods, some are bare- 
foot, and a few drag heavy chains 
linked to their ankles. Nazarenos 
(marchers performing less arduous 
penance) dress in similar tunics, but 
their heads are crowned with high 
conical hoods, whose shape dates 
back to the Inquisition. In his right 
hand each Nazareno carries a large, 
thick candle; his left hand is pressed 
against his mask so that he can see 
through the eye slits. 

Penitents who walk in the fore- 
front of the procession, farthest 
from the image, are the newest 
members of the brotherhood. The 



47 




oldest members walk closest to the 
image, which is borne on a large 
wooden platform transformed by 
artisans into a gilded baroque sup- 
port. Its corners are embellished by 
four large golden lanterns and velvet 
curtains hang from its sides, con- 
cealing the porters (costaleros) un- 
derneath. On a thick carpet of red 
carnations symbolizing the blood of 
Christ stands the polychrome image 
of El Gran Poder. The cadaverous 
statue — robed in royal purple, 
crowned with thorns, eyes closed — 
drags a cross toward Calvary. Like 
all Seville&apos;s representations of the 
suifering Christ, whether scourged 
or crucified, the image of El Gran 



48 



Poder simulates a dying man m 
minute detail. 

A steward (capataz) clad in a 
black suit walks beside the plat- 
form. Acting as a stage manager, he 
strikes three times a small silver 
knocker attached to the front of the 
support. The heavy baroque struc- 
ture stops, and one of the steward&apos;s 
assistants raises the velvet curtains 
and passes a jug of water to the por- 
ters below. Packed in rows six by 
six, they will carry the platform 
on their shoulders for at least six 
hours. They wear working clothes, 
with wide cloth belts wrapped 
tightly around their stomach mus- 
cles. Wool blankets cushion their 



heads against the hard platform. 
Occasionally, a brother will vol- 
untarily carry an image in the Holy 
Week ceremonies, but the invisible 
machinery that moves Holy Week 
is the porters, working-class men 
who are not members of the broth- 
erhood. Porters were traditionally 
recruited from the ranks of the 
stevedores who worked the Seville 
docks; nowadays they are chosen, 
organized, and trained by the stew- 
ard (a professional who works for 
the brotherhood), who also acts as 
intermediary in collective bargain- 
ing for Holy Week fees between the 
porters and the brothers. Porters 
are paid $50 to $65 apiece to carry 







the saints. Accord must be reached 
before a brotherhood&apos;s images can 
join the procession. 

After the procession of El Gran 
Poder passes and the street is again

hoods that hide penitents&apos; 
identities from all but God.

engulfed in darkness, the crowd dis- 
perses and heads for the light and 
warmth of the nearest cafes. There 
the spectators consume wine, beer, 
cognac, or coffee, and snacks of 
shrimp, fish, or sugary pastries to 
sustain them through the remaining 
hours of other processions. 

The somber passage of El Gran 
Poder inspires awe and prompts the 
faithful to contemplate Christ&apos;s 
sacred sufferings and death, but the 
appearance of the Macarena Virgin 
precipitates an explosion of joy. In 
Andalusia, in the past four hundred 
years, there has been a successive 
rise and fall in the popularity of dif- 
ferent images of Mary. None, how- 
ever, has caught the imagination of 
Andalusians as much as the Maca- 
rena. Throughout the year, many 
young couples marry before her 
image to enjoy special blessings 
and good luck. In 1908, Queen Vic- 
toria Eugenia dedicated her son to 
the Macarena. She has been be- 
queathed estates and titles — held 
in her name by the brotherhood — 
and in 1975, her net worth, not 
counting her basilica in Seville, 
was more than one million dollars. 

In 1977, when the Macarena left 
her basilica at one o&apos;clock on Good 
Friday morning, 700,000 spectators 
were waiting to view her triumphal 
procession through the city. During 
her twelve hours in the street, she is 
accompanied by a brotherhood 
dressed in white tunics and green 
hoods, bands playing both religious 
and popular music, and an elite 
guard of men dressed as Roman 
soldiers. En route to the cathedral, 
the Macarena&apos;s porters will stop in 
one of Seville&apos;s many plazas and de- 
light the crowd by making her image 
move to the bands&apos; rhythms. The 
dancing movement produces hys- 
teria and pandemonium in the 
crowds. Elsewhere, the Macarena 
will come to rest in a narrow street, 
and the music and spectators will 
fall silent as a man or woman ap- 
pears on a balcony to spontaneously

sounding cry of adoration addressed 
only to the Virgin. 

On the train of your mantle, 
goes my charmed heart, like 
a rose of gold, between 
carnations and lilies. 

Behind Holy Week&apos;s display of 
passionate devotion lies the social 
power of Seville&apos;s religious frater- 
nities {hennandades) and brother- 
hoods (cofradias), both of which 
date from the Middle Ages. Each 
fraternity is a group of men asso- 
ciated with a parish church and its 
images. The group functions as a 
sort of lay order, encouraging its 
members&apos; spiritual growth, promot- 
ing the worship and celebration of 



-f 



its cult images, and performing 
charitable works. In 1977, 70,000 of 
the 281 ,000 men in Seville belonged 
to religious fraternities. Cofradias 
are made up of those members of 
fraternities who parade with the 
fraternities&apos; images during Holy 
Week. One Sevillano in six belongs 
to a cofradia. 

Each fraternity abides by a char- 
ter originally approved by the Span- 
ish authorities of the Roman Cath- 
olic Church. But in recent years, a 
considerable degree of antagonism 
has marked relations between the 
fraternities, which jealously guard 
their independence, and the reli- 
gious authorities, who are embar- 
rassed by the brotherhoods&apos; extrav- 
agant expenditures in their images&apos; 




honor. The archives of most her- 
mandades are full of vituperative 
lawsuits between the members and 
the ecclesiastic hierarchy involving 
property title and jurisdiction over 
images. 

Besides functioning as religious 
organizations, fraternities and 
brotherhoods also partially define 
the city&apos;s structure. Until the 1700s, 
Seville was divided into guilds, 
groups of artisans who lived and 
worked in specific city streets, and 
the fraternities were composed of 
men who shared similar class back- 
grounds and professions. Today, 
while the guild system has become 
a network of barrios, class structure 
is still strong. Some fraternities and 
brotherhoods admit members of 



only one class; others accept both 
working- and middle-class mem- 
bers. The class and ethnic nature of 
the fraternities is best described in 
the membership rules, unmodified 
since 1661, ofthefraternity of Santa 
Caridad: 

He [the candidate] and his wife must 
be old Christians of pure and honored 
generation, without Moorish, mulatto, 
or Jewish lineage, never convicted by 
the Holy Office of the Inquisition, nor 
a new convert to the Holy Faith, nor the 
descendant of any of these. They may 
not have base or lowly employment. 
They should not have been castigated 
by ordinary justice for ignominious 
offenses. They must be sufficiently 
capable to exercise the offices of the 
Holy Fraternity. . . . And they must 



have sufficient income or property to 
sustain the quality of their person. 

Members of a fraternity generally 
live in one barrio. By participating 
in the rites of fraternities and 
brotherhoods, in particular the pro- 
cessions of Holy Week, memljers 
delineate barrios and establish ties 
with other neighborhoods. 

The intense reverence in which 
the fraternities hold their images, 
especially those of the Virgin, arises 
from their importance as stand-ins 
for supportive human relationships 
that an Andalusian frequently lacks 
at times of personal crises or even 
in the rounds of daily life. Besides 
the images&apos; social value in binding 
together people who share their de- 




votion, the sacred figures are im- 
portant to individual faithful. In 
northern Spain, images attract gen- 
eralized devotion, but Andalusians 
regard them as trusted confidants. 
Some statues are accorded miracu- 
lous powers and are thought capa- 
ble of curing illness or infertility. 

While Andalusians realize that 
there is only one Christ and one 
Mary, each is represented in vari- 
ous forms: personifications of im- 
portant moments in their lives, 
images accorded particular devo- 
tion by certain religious orders, or 
images associated with local 
shrines. Similarly, in the classical 
Mediterranean, the Greek and Ro- 
man faithful gave their gods and 
goddesses multiple forms. Southern 
Europe has never really broken 
away from Hellenism&apos;s many 
deities or converted fully to Judeo- 
Christian monotheism and its at- 
tendant illusion that the human ego 
is permanent and singular. In Spain, 
a more sophisticated polytheistic 
psychology exists, taking into con- 
sideration the human personality&apos;s 
multiple facets and its diverse, con- 
tradictory needs. 

During Holy Week, Andalusians 
turn this internal religious experi- 
ence into a public event. They con- 
sider the Virgin, unlike Christ, a 
spiritual reality who is loving, lov- 
able, and can be brought down to a 
human level. Indeed, one day dur- 
ing the week before Holy Week, the 
Macarena&apos;s image is lowered from 
its shrine to the basilica floor, so 
that the faithful can approach and 
kiss her hand. And while El Gran 
Poder is addressed solemnly, 
Andalusians sing to the eyes, lips, 
and breasts of the Macarena. She 
is equal and accessible. 

To materialize Christianity and 
exaggerate its symbols, Andalu- 
sians turn to a sensate realism in re- 
ligious art. Unlike Germany or 
Italy, where baroque and rococo 
are now considered stages in the 
history of art, southern Spain con- 
tinues to delight in these styles of 
flowing, twisting movement and 
florid polychrome colors. This is an 
art of propaganda, which over- 
whelms the viewer with luxurious 
and theatrical effects. 

A stranger visiting Seville during 
Holy Week might easily be con- 



vinced that the entire population 
joins in communal, unanimous ado- 
ration of the fraternities&apos; images. In 
fact, an undercurrent of dissent 
exists and surfaces periodically. 
Since the late 1930s, the wealthy 
landowners who control most of 
southern Spain have slowly mech- 
anized their farms and the rural 
population has migrated to Seville 
in search of work. As a result, the 
city&apos;s population has increased by 
400 percent in the last seventy-five 
years. Migration is not only under- 
mining the barrio structure, the 
basis of the fraternities&apos; power; it is 
also weakening devotion to re- 
ligious symbols. In October 1973, 
the bishop of Seville declared, 
&quot;Now only 30 percent of the dio- 
cese maintains habitual contact 
with the Church, and the rest are 
not Christian actors but spectators; 
likewise, one can say that anti- 
clericalism is being embraced in 
Seville, equally among the wealthy 
as among the working class.&quot; 

Since Franco&apos;s death in 1976, 
Spanish politics have been liberal- 
ized, and church and state have be- 
come increasingly separate, as they 
were during the brief period of the 
Second Republic in the early 1930s. 
The effect, if any, on Holy Week in 
Seville is not yet clear. During Holy 
Week in 1932, when anticlerical 
feeling ran very high, only one 
brotherhood dared leave its church. 
Its image of Christ was bombarded 
with rubbish in the streets, and pro- 
testers shot at the Virgin as she 
entered the cathedral. In 1933, no 
processions braved the opposition, 
and in 1934 only three brotherhoods 
ventured out. Throughout 1935, 
militia desecrated a number of 
images in their shrines. Frequently, 
anticlericals attacked neighboring 
barrios&apos; images while simultane- 
ously defending their own statues. 
On February 12, 1936. shortly be- 
fore the outbreak of the Civil War, 
the Macarena was surreptitiously 
removed from her basilica and con- 
cealed in a private home. 

In the 1970s, the strongest critics 
of Holy Week proceedings have 
been young worker-priests, who 
are scandalized by the fraternities&apos; 
expenditures. The gilded structures 
upon which the Christ images rest 
are valued at from $34,000 to 




$51,000, while the Virgins&apos; sup- 
ports are worth between $68,000 
and $85,000. The Virgins&apos; mantles, 
embroidered in gold and silver 
thread, cost about $51,000 apiece, 
and some Virgins have as many as 
twelve. Crowns of gold encrusted 
with precious stones cost $68,000. 
Flowers, candles, and the porters&apos; 
salaries amount to between $12,000 
and $17,000 per fraternity. Mem- 
bers contribute these huge sums out 
of their own incomes. The worker- 
priests, who feel the monies should 
be spent on social services, protest 
that the Holy Week spectacle is 
a slap in the face to the city&apos;s many 
unemployed. But no one protests 
other expensive festivals elsewhere 
in Spain, such as the running of the 
bulls during San Fermin — a Basque 
spring festival in the northern prov- 
ince of Navarra — or the Fallas of 
Valencia — another week-long 
spring festival. 

In Seville, Holy Week continues 
because the fraternities and brother- 
hoods are in great part the city&apos;s 
cultural, social, and economic life. 
They have kept alive the artistry 
and craftsmanship in silver, gold, 
wax, and embroidery that have dis- 
appeared elsewhere in Spain. The 
fraternities&apos; expenditures have sup- 
ported Seville&apos;s small businesses 
and strengthened tourism. Yet the 
love and devotion with which the 
fraternities organize processions 
year after year quickly contradict 
the falsehood that Holy Week con- 
tinues only for the sake of tourists. 
Holy Week&apos;s future will not be de- 
termined by politics or economics, 
but by Seville&apos;s children, who be- 
come involved in the ceremonies 
early in life. Weeks after Easter 
Sunday, children at play reenact the 
Holy Week processions by taking 
a kitchen table from their homes, 
draping it with a bedspread, crown- 
ing it with a wooden cross, and 
carrying it once again through the 
city streets. D 



Holy Week is followed by the 

Feria de Sevilla, a horse fair 

during which the city resounds 

with gypsy song and dance.

Seeds in Flight 

Seeds dispersed by the wind travel in varied, delicate 
constructions, portrayed in an architect&apos;s drawings 

Illustrations and text by Willard K. Martin 




Many of us grow up associating summer with 
clouds of tiny dandelion seeds launched by our own 
breath. Summer&apos;s passage into fall is marked by dried 
milkweed pods, which split their sides and pour 
out dozens of silken parachutes, miniature air drops 
that carry the plant&apos;s seeds. Dandelion and milkweed 
are examples of flowering plants whose seed 
dispersal depends, not on animals or water, or even 
exclusively on the plant&apos;s own exploding mechanisms, 
but on the seeds&apos; buoyancy and on the varying 
movements of air. 

Seeds are vital to a plant species&apos; survival 
because they carry embryonic plants. Over a span of 
four hundred million years, certain seeds have 
evolved a great variety of wind-catching dispersal 
devices — disks, propellers, wings, parachutes, 
and gliders — some of which have provided models for 
aeronautical inventors and engineers. In fact, 
working designers frequently refer to &quot;organic form,&quot; 
without recognizing how many architectural and 
engineering structures are based on natural ones. 

The ovary of the flower contains the developing 
seeds, along with features that insure their packing, 
protection, and distribution. Some distribution 
features rely on animal, bird, and insect carriers; 
others enable the seed to float, sail, spin, or parachute 
through the air. The dispersal of the earliest 
airborne seeds was probably aided by elongated fibers 
extending from the ovary. These fibers caught 
the wind and substantially extended the seeds&apos; 
dispersal range. Seeds with greater flight potential 
had better chances of survival and subsequently 
passed on their traits, while limited flyers perished in 
the shadow of their parent plant. 

Some seeds are so light that they need no 
mechanism to help catch the wind. For instance, 
a million orchid seeds weigh only about two grams. 
Because they are so light, these microscopic seeds 
drop very slowly in air and are widely distributed 
by wind currents and jet streams, which carry them 
to great heights and distances. 

Many heavier seeds depend on carriers made of 
a network of tiny hairs — silky plumes or tufts — 
that trap air and keep the seed buoyant. Formed on 
the fruit of the plant, these appendages, which 
make up the pappus, come in a variety of shapes and 
sizes. Some are composed of hollow tubes; others 
are feathery bristles. Some seeds, especially those 



of trees, shrubs, and climbers, have parallel rows 
of appendages bonded into flat planes, or wings. 

Certain flying seeds — of the maple, elm, ash, tulip 
tree, and most of the cone-bearing trees, including 
fir, pine, and hemlock — depend on one-winged 
propellers, or samaras. They use the eccentric wing, 
or autogyrating, principle of flight, in which the 
single wing turns by means of its own forward motion. 
All flying seeds have fixed, or constant, centers 
of gravity. This stability aids flight and, consequently, 
dispersal. 

In a maple key, for example, the seed is enclosed 
in a hard covering that extends into an eccentric 
wing. A wing operating according to the autogyrating 
principle revolves automatically around its center 
of gravity. But a maple seed, placed at one end of the 
wing, puts the samara off-balance, slowing its 
descent. When the wind detaches the seed from 
the tree, the maple key describes a spiral flight, the 
single wing rotating around a central axis, 
counterbalanced by the seed&apos;s weight. The key, 
influenced by a current of air, spins like a propeller 
or windmill. In even a slight wind, a samara can 
cover considerable distances.

Pod of Hakea platysperma, or pincushion tree 

Some seeds, such as those of the pincushion tree 
(Hakeci platysperma), an Australian evergreen shrub, are 
simply sandwiched in the center of a membranous 
halo, or wing. Circular dispersal devices are not 
as aerodynamic or as stable as the bull thistle&apos;s parachutes or 
the maple&apos;s winged seeds. Nevertheless, circular devices 
can travel great distances in favorable winds. Seeds 
surrounded by flat, membranous structures are extremely 
light, allowing them to float gracefully on the least 
whisper of air. 

Hakea platysperma has a heavily insulated seedpod, in 
which two seeds, each surrounded by a membrane, develop back 
to back. The outer half of each seed is attached to each 
half of the pod by numerous spinelike projections. As 
the spines dry out and shrink from the pod, its halves open 
and the seeds are lifted by the first strong breeze.

Part of a seed cluster of Ailanthus altissima, 
or tree of heaven 



Ailanthus and catalpa trees have other kinds of rotating 
mechanisms, in which the seed is located at the hub of a 
two-bladed flying propeller. Each blade tip of the ailanthus 
propeller is warped; consequently, the seed rotates 
backward as it falls forward. Thus its motion is slowed, 
enabling it to stay aloft longer and travel farther. Because the 
seed is not quite centered in the blade, the propeller not 
only rolls but also follows a broad spiral flight path.

Fruit of Ecballium elaterium, or squirting cucumber. 



The squirting cucumber actually fires its seeds into the air. 
The plant&apos;s elongated, egg-shaped fruits hang from its 
vertical stalk at an angle, forming a trajectory that maximizes 
the seeds&apos; range. Fruits and stalk are connected by cells 
whose walls eventually separate to form a basal opening 
through which the seeds are released. As a fruit develops, 
hydrostatic pressure increases inside it, and its inner, elastic 
layer becomes very tightly stretched. (A small puncture 
in the ripe fruit releases a tiny squirt.) Interior pressure and 
disturbance, caused by movements of wind or passing 
animals or people, combine to weaken the fruit&apos;s attachment 
to the stalk. The fruit&apos;s seeds then squirt explosively 
from the basal opening. When I bisected several spent 
fruits, each of which normally contains roughly forty seeds, 
I could not find any seeds. Evidently, the plant&apos;s mechanism 
is so efficient that every seed is ejected.

Cone of Pinus sabiniana, or digger pine. 

The seed of the digger pine has a short, blunt wing that 
needs strong winds to travel. As the tree&apos;s large cones slowly 
mature and lose their moisture, the cone scales open and 
release the heavy seeds over several months. Each scale has 
a layer of coarse, dark, granular tissue, and another layer 
of very light, dense material. For the scales to open, the 
coarse layers must expand while the light layers contract. 
This entire mechanism rotates around a hingelike 
connection to the cone&apos;s core.

Pappus and seed of Cirsium vulgare, 
or bull thistle. 

The pappus transports the seeds of thistles, dandelion, milkweed, 
sycamore, cottonwood, and goatsbeard. In the bull thistle 
and the dandelion, the seed is suspended below the pappus, 
giving the whole apparatus greater stability in flight and 
insuring that, upon landing, the seed will come in contact with 
soil. Shaped like spherical parachutes, the bull thistle&apos;s 
pappus rolls and tumbles in the slightest breeze. It dips, then 
rises again on the next breath of updraft, spanning broad 
distances in a few minutes and reaching considerable altitudes. 
Clockwise, from left, an immature bull thistle flower 
becomes a mature blossom. The dying flower disperses pappus 
and seeds, and the pappus — a parachute of feathery hairs — 
releases a seed.

The Big Blast at Santorini 

by Stephen Sparks and Haraldur Sigurdsson 



Whether or not this volcano 
effected the downfall of the 
Minoan civilization, it is 
typical of the major eruptions 
that break out every few 
thousand years 

Since the dawn of history, human 
beings have been fascinated by the 
destructive potential lying within a 
volcano. A small number of erup- 
tions have become celebrated be- 
cause of the havoc they wreaked 
upon those who lived in their vicin- 
ity. In 1973 an eruption on the 
island of Heimaey, oflF the southern 
coast of Iceland, buried a small but 
important fishing port and dis- 
rupted the country&apos;s economy for 
a short while. The 1902 eruption of 
Mount Pelee, on Martinique, de- 
stroyed the town of Saint-Pierre, 
killing its 28,000 inhabitants. The 
eruption of Vesuvius in a.d. 79 
buried Pompeii without a trace, 
thereby preserving for posterity a 
complete Roman town and its way 
of life. Many people now believe 
that the paroxysmal eruption of the 
volcanic Aegean island of Santorini 
in the late Bronze Age may have 
destroyed the ancient Minoan civi- 
lization. 

The Minoans, who excelled in 
architecture, pottery, sculpture. 



The steep cliffs of the island of 
Thera, largest remnant of the B.C. 
Santorini eruption, show successive 
layers of volcanic pumice and 
ash. Each hand represents a 
separate eruption. The satellite 
photograph at right was made at an 
altitude of 570 miles. The red areas 
are vegetation; many of the small 
white areas are clouds. 

-.&apos;, A Sugar 



and painting, controlled a powerful 
empire centered on Crete, with 
communities — including Santorini 
— scattered throughout the Aegean 
islands. They were a great seafar- 
ing people whose economic power 
derived from trading. By 1500 B.C. 
the Minoans were at the height of 
their prosperity and strength, but 
sometime between 1500 and 1400 
B.C. a sudden reversal in their for- 
tunes took place. Archeological 
evidence indicates widespread de- 
struction and abandonment of 
many Cretan towns and palaces, 
most of which were never reinhab- 
ited. Although a few palaces were 
rebuilt, the Minoan civilization 
never fully recovered. From about 
1400 B.C. onward, the Minoans 



were dominated by Mycenaean 
Greece and soon thereafter left the 
stage of history. 

The cause of the Minoan decline 
has been a subject of vigorous de- 
bate and speculation. The theory 
that the Minoan civilization col- 
lapsed as a consequence of an 
immense volcanic eruption on San- 
torini, some eighty miles north of 
Crete, was first proposed in 1939 
by a Greek archeologist, Spyridon 
Marinatos. The theory had few 
adherents until two crucial pieces 
of evidence demonstrated that San- 
torini had indeed been the site of 
one of the largest volcanic erup- 
tions on the earth in the last 10,000 
years. First, geologists Dragoslav 
Ninkovich and the late Bruce C.

Heezen, from the Lamont-Doherty 
Observatory of Columbia Uni- 
versity, discovered in 1965 a very 
widespread, thick layer of volcanic 
ash in cores of sediment taken from 
the bottom of the Aegean and Med- 
iterranean seas. This ash was iden- 



tified as coming from Santorini. 
Second, in 1967 the remains of 
a large Minoan town were found on 
Santorini, buried like Pompeii be- 
neath great thicknesses of volcanic 
ash. Archeological evidence soon 
established that the town, called 



Akrotiri, had been destroyed and 
buried by a huge eruption between 
1500 and 1450 B.C. 

The great Bronze Age eruption of 
Santorini is of interest not only for 
its possible archeological signifi- 
cance but also as a natural phenom- 




II 



enon in itself. It is one of the most 
recent examples of a type of grand- 
scale eruption that has occurred 
repeatedly throughout the earth&apos;s 
geologic history. On Santorini the 
erosive effects of time, which over 
millions of years often alter and 



deform the products of eruptions, 
have not yet had a chance to de- 
stroy the vital evidence. For this 
reason the Santorini eruption has 
attracted studies by many geolo- 
gists, geophysicists, and volcanoi- 
ogists. In 1975 we were part of a 



team of scientists — led by the late 
Norman Watkins, a geophysicist at 
the University of Rhode Island 
School of Oceanography — that 
studied the Santorini eruption by 
sampling sediments taken from the 
bottom of the sea floor. 




These Minoan frescoes, unearthed in the exeuvutions at Akrotiri. 
have been painstakingly restored and are now on display 
at the National Archeological Museum in Athens.

that additional frescoes and 

artifacts will be found. 



Our study was concerned with 
understanding the processes that 
cause such a destructive concentra- 
tion of energy in locaHzed parts of 
the earth&apos;s crust and in estabUshing 
how these eruptions work. We con- 
centrated on a group of five islands, 
known collectively as Santorini, 
which are the remnants of the vol- 
cano that erupted. After spending 
some time on the islands, we joined 
an international team of a dozen 
scientists gathered at Iraklion on 
Crete. We were to spend twenty 
days on the University of Rhode 
Island oceanographic research 
vessel, Trident, collecting samples 
from the sea bottom north and 
southeast of Crete. We had already 
learned much about the eruption 
from observations during field- 
work on the islands; now the team 
planned to examine the millions 
of tons of eruption-produced ash 
that eventually fell into the sea. 

A present-day traveler reaching 
Santorini by boat, as we did on the 
Trident, sees a very diiferent sight 
from that which a Minoan sailor 
would have seen before the vol- 
canic eruption. In 1500 B.C. a single 
island occupied the whole area of 
the present group of five. There 
would have been a steep volcanic 
mountain in the island&apos;s north, 
rising to perhaps 3,000 feet above 
sea level, and a gently sloping 
plain would have spread across 
the southern half of the island. The 
upper slopes of the mountain would 
have been covered with dark 
chunks of lava, while the lower

slopes were probably covered with 
vineyards that surrounded the town 
of Akrotiri on the south coast. 

Today the whole area is frag- 
mented. The center of the original 
island was partly destroyed by the 
volcanic explosions of the great 
eruption and then, weakened, sank 
beneath the sea, forming a huge 
caldera, or circular cavity, about 
2,500 feet deep and 6 miles in diam- 
eter. Three crescent-shaped is- 
lands, with monumentally steep 
cliflFs, rim the vast caldera. The 
shattering of the original island 
permitted the sea to pour into the 
caldera, filling it to a depth of about 
1,200 feet. (The rest of the caldera 
is above sea level.) Since the initial 
major eruption, periodic and com- 
paratively mild eruptions at vents 
located in the center of the caldera 
have led to the formation there of 
two small new islands. 

The earliest recorded mild erup- 
tion took place in a.d. 726. Accord- 
ing to Greek mythology, however, 
when Jason and the Argonauts 
sailed past Santorini, they were 
pelted with rocks thrown by a giant 
called Telos, whose feet appar- 
ently melted to form rivers of liquid. 
This may be the oldest extant 
description of a volcanic eruption. 
The last eruption occurred in 1950 
on Nea Kameni, one of the new 
islands and the currently dominant 
volcanic vent. Its active, sulfurous 
fumaroles belch yellow incrusta- 
tions of sulfur over the 1950 crater, 
a reminder of the latent power in 
the otherwise placid landscape. 

The caldera is an imposing sight. 
The towering cliflfs on the remain- 
ing eastern half of the original ex- 
ploded volcano, now known as 
Thera, plunge steeply into the blue 
Aegean. The cliffs themselves are 
streaked with horizontal bands of 
dark lava and layers of volcanic 
pumice, rock, and ash, colored 
from white to cream to brick red. 
These layers represent the products 
of many individual eruptions that 
accumulated over hundreds of mil- 
lennia to create the original vol- 
cano. The snow-white ash of the 
uppermost layer covers the island 
like icing on a cake. These white 
ash layers are the volcanic products 
of the great eruption. 

The volume of rock missing from 



the caldera exceeds fifteen cubic 
miles. In the study of other caldera- 
forming eruptions, a relationship 
between caldera size and the vol- 
ume of matter ejected by the vol- 
cano has emerged. Although our 
knowledge of caldera formation 
does not permit us to assert that the 
volume of material apparently 
missing from this caldera is the 
exact equivalent of the volume of 
material ejected in the Santorini 
eruption, there is a clear indication 
that by any standard Santorini was 
a very large upheaval. 

A great deal about the eruption 
can be deduced by examining the 
layers of white ash and porous 
pumice rock on the islands border- 
ing the caldera. To the uninitiated, 
the layers of debris may look sim- 
ilar, but to specialists they are dis- 
tinctive — each one records a diflFer- 
ent phase of the great eruption. The 
lowest layer, for example, is com- 
posed of large pumice blocks. By 
measuring the largest of these 
blocks, hurled from the volcano to 
many points on the islands, we can 
find approximately where the origi- 
nal vent was situated. This is be- 
cause with any volcano, the size of 
the ejected blocks decreases with 
increasing distance from the vent. 

The opening phase of the Santo- 
rini eruption consisted of a violent 
continuous blast of gas, fragmented 
lava, pumice, and ash expelled 
vertically into the atmosphere from 
a vent about one mile west of the 
present-day town of Thera. This 
phase may have lasted for a few 
days. Laboratory studies of sam- 
ples of the material ejected indicate 
the temperature of the lava was 
more than 800°C (1470°?). The 
initial speed of this mixture ex- 
ceeded 1,200 miles per hour. 
Blocks of rock measuring about 
three feet in diameter were torn 
from the vent wall and flung as far 
as a mile away. 

As the hot mixture rose like a 
huge jet, cold air was dragged into 
the column. The cold air was 
heated by contact with the hot ash 
particles and expanded rapidly. 
The augmented mixture ascended 
through the atmosphere to heights 
of twenty miles or more, reaching 
the stratosphere. Because the great 
power of the volcano was directed 



upward into the sky, the fallout of 
the fragments would have been 
relatively slow. But the column 
reached so far up into the heavens 
that the colossal volume of debris 
within it would have spread widely 
over the land and sea. 

The physics of the rising column 
is similar to smoke rising above a 
fire or issuing from a factory chim- 
ney. As the column rises, more and 
more air is absorbed, steadily dilut- 
ing and expanding the mixture. 
Atmospheric winds blow the mix- 
ture in a vast plume over tens of 
thousands of square miles. Fine ash 
can be transported many hundreds 
of miles and some of the dust can 
remain in the atmosphere for many 
years. 

This type of paroxysmal volcanic 
activity is often termed &quot;Plinian&quot; 
after the description by Pliny the 
Younger of the eruption of Vesu- 
vius. Both Akrotiri on Santorini 
and Pompeii were buried by lower 
layers of coarse pumice blocks 
several feet thick, which were over- 
lain by much finer ash deposits. 
These coarse pumice beds are re- 
markably similar in the two towns. 
In both, the pumice fragments get 
progressively larger toward the 
tops of the layers. This finding is 
thought to reflect an increase in the 
energy of the explosions within the 
volcano. Vesuvius and Santorini 
are representative of a great many 
volcanoes that show evidence of 
repeated Plinian eruptions in their 
history, each eruption followed by 
periods of dormancy lasting hun- 
dreds or thousands of years. The 
great eruption that formed Crater 
Lake in Oregon 6,000 years ago, for 
example, opened with a Plinian 
blast. 

The layers above the pumice bed 
found on Thera today give evidence 
of a dramatic change in volcanic 
activity. The top layer is predomi- 
nantly fine-grained ash formed by 
the pulverization of pumice. Such 
layers are formed when water and 
hot magma come into contact. In 
these situations the mixture be- 
comes extremely explosive and the 
lava is minutely fragmented by 
intense detonations. We interpret 
the ash layer as evidence that vast 
quantities of seawater poured onto 
the red-hot magma. 



75 



From the scientific point of view, 
the Phnian and water/magma explo- 
sions and activity are spectacular 
forms of volcanism, but they are by 
no means the most destructive or 
lethal volcanic phenomena. In a 
second type of eruption that oc- 
curred on Santorini in the last 
paroxysmal stages, a mixture of in- 
tensely hot gas and incandescent 
solid material shot into the air in an 
eruption cloud a few miles above 
the vent. The intensity of the erup- 
tion at this stage was so great that 
the cloud literally collapsed under 
its own weight, sending dense ava- 
lanches of pumice and ash cascad- 
ing down the volcano&apos;s flanks. 
Such mixtures of hot gas and vol- 
canic fragments move over the land 
at terrifying speeds. In historic 
eruptions of this kind known to be 
much smaller than that of Santorini, 
speeds of up to 130 miles per hour 
have been recorded. We estimate 
that in eruptions of the magnitude 
of Santorini, speeds of 200 to 400 
miles per hour are possible. 

The result of these colossal ava- 
lanches on Santorini was to spread 
thick accumulations of pumice and 
ash over the whole island, burying 
the town of Akrotiri to a depth of 



about one hundred feet. This type 
of burning, hurricanelike eruption 
probably killed the population _of 
Pompeii with its searing heat and 
buried the town under a layer of 
ash. The even fiercer avalanches of 
destruction on Santorini left behind 
the great snow-white cliffs visible 
on Thera today. Paradoxically, a 
spectacular treasure of Minoan art 
was preserved amid the violence. 
Excavations of villas at Akrotiri 
have unearthed some of the finest 
examples of Minoan frescoes found 
anywhere. As with Pompeii, a dis- 
aster has allowed us to appreciate 
the life style of an ancient civiliza- 
tion. 

Although studies on the island of 
Thera are of great value, the cruise 
on the Trident was our main 
method of examining the effects of 
the eruption. The vast bulk of the 
ejected ash was dispersed by the 
wind and fell into the sea to form a 
layer that was subsequently buried 
by sediment washed into the water 
by rivers in what is now Greece, 
Turkey, and Crete. During the 
cruise we collected cores of soft 
sediment from the sea bottom. Sev- 
eral feet of sediment were recov- 
ered, and sandwiched within it. 




about three to eight inches from the 



top, we found a distinctive white 
layer of ash in many of the cores. 
In the laboratory we were able to 
establish that this ash, which is 
distinguished by its unique chemi- 
cal composition from all other vol- 
canic ashes in the region, came 
from the great eruption on Santo- 
rini sometime between 1500 and 
1450 B.C. 

The cores collected during our 
cruise have been the basis of a great 
many other fascinating studies. 
Sea-floor sediment accumulates 
very slowly on the time scale of 
human life. Only a few inches of 
mud may pile up every thousand 
years, so a foot-long core usually 
records oceanic events that stretch 
back tens of thousands of years. 
During this time span, several gla- 
ciations may occur. The skeletal 
remains of microscopic organisms 
that become buried in the sediment 
change according to the water tem- 
perature. The sediments in cores 
reflect these changes in subtle 
ways: for example, the ratio of the 
two isotopes of oxygen O&apos;* and O&apos;^ 
changes during glaciations and 
makes it possible to determine the 
age of a particular core level.

of Ash Thickness 

Each contour represents the 
average thickness of 
volcanic ash from Santorini 
foimd in sea-floor cores.

Black mud in our cores, rich in 
organic matter and dead deepwater 
organisms, indicated periods when 
the sea downwind of Santorini be- 
came completely stagnant, like an 
enormous pond with no circulation. 
Layers of volcanic ash deeper in 
the cores than that identified as 
coming from the great Santorini ex- 
plosion showed that other large 
eruptions had occurred in this area 
tens of thousands of years ago. 
Some of these deep layers were 
also from Santorini and we were 
able to correlate them with the 
great bands of pumice found today 
in the caldera cliflFs on the island of 
Thera. Other layers are from other 
volcanic islands in the Aegean, 
such as Nisyros and Yali near the 
Ibrkish coast. 

One important result of our cor- 
ing provided a great deal of infor- 
mation on the correlation of ash 
thickness with distance from the 
islands of Santorini. From these 
data we constructed a chart, called 
an isopach map, with contour lines 
that join sites of equal ash thick- 
ness. This map enabled us to deter- 
mine the wind direction during the 
great eruption, a principal factor in 
controlling the quantity of ash that 
fell at a particular place. We found 
that the wind had blown the ash to 
the east-southeast; therefore only 
the eastern half of Crete was cov- 
ered with ash. 

How did the great eruption affect 
the Minoans living on Crete and 
throughout the Aegean? Although 
the eruption probably lasted for at 
least several days, its immediate 
impact would have been confined 
to Santorini itself. High-altitude 
winds, however, carried ash of sub- 
millimeter size toward Crete and, 
as the eruption continued, a fine 
rain of ash fell over much of the 
eastern part of the island. At the 
time, the bulk of the population 
lived in the eastern half of Crete. 
Where the ash fell thickest, crops 
were probably destroyed and we 
could expect the ashfall to have 
been a considerable nuisance to the 
Minoans. But we doubt whether 
such a moderate shower of ash 
would by itself have been suffi- 
ciently catastrophic to destroy an 
entire civilization. On the other 
Aegean islands, however, such as 



Karpathos and Rhodes, and on the 
south coast of Turkey, the ashfall 
was considerably thicker. Commu- 
nities at those locations may have 
suffered much greater losses. 

After an eruption of the magni- 
tude of Santorini, the volcano was 
weakened to its root and the sub- 
terranean chamber, from which 
the vast quantities of lava origi- 
nated, was empty. The volcano 
then collapsed inwardly on itself 
and the present-day caldera was 
formed. We can learn a great deal 
about the probable effects of this 
collapse from modern studies of 
caldera formation. In 1968, for 
example, a great caldera approxi- 
mately seven miles square and a 
thousand feet deep formed in the 
Galapagos Islands over a nine-day 
period. Some 675 earthquakes ac- 
companied that collapse, and 75 of 
them approached a magnitude of 5 
on the Richter scale. Each of the 
larger quakes resulted from a drop 
in the crater floor of approximately 
thirteen feet. Santorini&apos;s caldera is 
much larger than that of Galapagos 
and we can speculate that the ac- 
companying earth tremors there 
were correspondingly larger. Earth- 
quakes in the sea, of course, can 
form tidal waves and the backlash 
of the sea rushing into a newly 
formed pit must have a similar 
effect. Thus it seems likely that at 
Santorini both large earthquakes 
and large tidal waves would have 
accompanied the caldera collapse 
over a period of days or weeks. 

Even moderate-sized tidal waves 
hitting the northern shore of Crete 
could have destroyed the Minoans&apos; 
ships, the basis of their economy. 
In antiquity, boats were usually 
beached, and waves of the rela- 
tively modest height of those gen- 
erated by the 1883 Krakatoa erup- 
tion — about forty feet — would have 
undoubtedly destroyed a great 
many boats. A seafaring society 
would have suffered tremendously 
from these tidal waves. Whether 
they were sufficiently destructive 
to have wiped out the Minoan civi- 
lization, we cannot say. But arche- 
ologists have found pieces of the 
same vase in different rooms of 
excavated houses on Crete, indi- 
cating that catastrophic flooding 
probably accompanied the waves. 



Many people inevitably ask 
whether a great eruption such as 
that of Santorini is likely to occur 
again. Eruptions of that size do not 
happen very often on the human 
time scale, but are common events 
on a geologic time scale. The 
older ash layers in our cores dem- 
onstrate, as already mentioned, that 
Santorini and other Greek islands 
have had several large-scale erup- 
tions in their history. In Japan 
about twenty eruptions of compa- 
rable size have occurred in the last 
40,000 years. In New Zealand such 
eruptions take place every 2,000 to 
3,000 years. 

Eruptions considerably larger 
than Santorini&apos;s have also oc- 
curred. One ash layer in our cores 
from the Aegean Sea is now known 
to have come from an ancient vol- 
cano close to Naples. The same ash 
layer is found in cores throughout 
the eastern Mediterranean from 
Italy to Cyprus. Probably about 
one hundred cubic miles of ash 
were ejected during this cataclys- 
mic event, yet the eruption took 
place only 30,000 to 40,000 years 
ago. This eruption dwarfs even 
Santorini&apos;s. An area within a radius 
of fifty miles of present-day Naples 
was deluged with enormous masses 
of mixed gas and volcanic solids 
burying the land to a thickness of 
one hundred feet. Our cores show 
that the ashfall from this colossal 
prehistoric event was more than 
two inches of uncompacted mate- 
rial in the Aegean Sea and on Crete, 
a band slightly thicker than the San- 
torini ash layer. It is sobering to 
remember that Naples is 750 miles 
from Crete, whereas only about 80 
miles separate that island from 
Santorini. 

Probably a few eruptions of com- 
parable magnitude to Santorini 
have occurred since the Bronze 
Age, but they have taken place in 
remote and inaccessible parts of the 
world and records of them are 
either scanty or nonexistent. We 
estimate conservatively that at 
least one or two eruptions of San- 
torini&apos;s size may occur every thou- 
sand years. Thus far, mankind has 
been lucky that few eruptions of the 
scale of Santorini have occurred 
near centers of concentrated popu- 
lation or advanced civilization. D

Books in Review

When Ignorance is Bliss 



The Encyclopaedia of Igno- 
rance, edited by Ronald Duncan 
and Miranda Weston-Smith. Per- 
gamon Press, $30.00 hardcover; 
$20.00 paperback, 433 pp. 

This review is a warning. The 
Encyclopaedia of Ignorance is a 
bad book that will give very little 
pleasure to anyone. The idea be- 
hind it is sound, the title is fascinat- 
ing, but the execution is so poor 
that the book is almost a complete 
disaster. 

Fixing the blame is easy. There 
is ample evidence that the two 
editors know next to nothing about 
the task they undertook — to have 
leading scientists each give &quot;his 
personal views in simple language 
on those questions which seem to 
him to be most important for the 
future of Mankind.&quot; 

This idea sounds remarkably 
easy to carry out: simply pick up 
the phone and ask the leading sci- 
entist in each field to write a brief 
essay from the depths of his or her 
wisdom about the frontiers of re- 
search. But only someone who is 
totally unacquainted with the na- 
ture of scientists and science writ- 
ing can retain a belief in such sim- 
plicity. A brief consultation with 
any editor who has worked with 
scientists is enough to make one 
aware of a large number of pitfalls. 

To start with, only a few scien- 
tists know how to write for the 
public — and the definition of &quot;pub- 
lic&quot; includes other scientists. Most 
physicists today know very little 
about biology, and solid-state 
physicists often need an introduc- 



tion to the concepts used in, say, 
astrophysics. To write for the 
public, one must provide a good 
deal of background information, 
define terms and concepts care- 
fully and fully, lead the reader 
along slowly, and explain points of 
controversy in full, including the 
facts supporting each point of view. 

Most scientists are accustomed 
to writing only for other scientists 
in their own narrow field. There is 
a formula for this sort of writing 
that makes life easy for the writer 
but not the reader. The scientist 
assumes that the reader is equipped 
with a full knowledge of the sub- 
ject. The background given is mini- 
mal. The jargon of the field is used 
with little or no attempt at defini- 
tion. Other scientists are referred 
to by last name only; for further 
information, the reader is referred 
to other papers, often in journals 
known only in the field. The scien- 
tist slips easily into mathematical 
formulas when they are necessary 
to carry along the flow of the argu- 
ment. If the scientist is interested 
in one narrow aspect of a broad 
field, most of the paper will be 
devoted to that narrow point. And 
if the scientist has a theory in an 
area of controversy, that theory 
will be supported passionately. 

If the editor is not dealing with 
Solomon Snyder or Jeremy Bern- 
stein or Stephen Jay Gould or any of 
the other, small number of scien- 
tists who know how to write for the 
public, iron discipline is needed to 
keep the contributor in line. Any 
attempt by the scientist to dust off 
a published scientific paper with- 



out change must be rejected ruth- 
lessly. Attempts to sneak in scien- 
tific terms without definition must 
be suppressed without mercy. (It 
can be argued that the art of giving 
definitions easily is half of science 
writing.) The scientist must not be 
allowed to ride his or her hobby- 
horse; all sides of an issue must be 
presented. Jargon must be driven 
out of the article completely. 

The eflFort to turn a typical scien- 
tific paper into a piece of intelligible 
science writing for the public is 
exhausting — so much so that most 
editors prefer not to deal with sci- 
entists at all. When an article does 
appear under a scientist&apos;s name, it 
often is the result of a long and 
careful collaboration between the 
scientist and an editor who has put 
in many hours of work to turn out 
a readable but accurate account. 

There are many dangers in this 
process, and the editors of The 
Encyclopaedia of Ignorance have 
not escaped a single one. This is not 
surprising, since neither seems 
qualified for the job. Ronald Dun- 
can is described as &quot;the well- 
known poet and playwright.&quot; 
Miranda Weston-Smith is described 
simply as &quot;the granddaughter of 
the great cosmologist E. A. Milne.&quot; 
One can picture the cocktail party 
at which some publisher thought 
it might be a lark to turn this proj- 
ect over to them. It was a mistake. 

Now to particulars. The first 
section, on the physical sciences, 
can be briefly described as a total 
loss. It is possible to make a list of 
some of the more interesting ques- 
tions in the physical sciences today.

Once there was a great American fronlier in the West Cheap 
fertile land and nol many people lo work it, opened up wonderful 
opportunities for generations of Americans, and immigrants loo. 
Many prospered, many grew wealthy profiling from the develop- 
ment of the land and the nation&apos;s expansion 

THOSE DAYS ARE SADLY GONE EXCEPT — YES EXCEPT 
FOR ONE PUCE — THE VAST TEMPERATE ZONE OF VIRGIN 
LAND IN THE STATE OF SANTA CRUZ. BOLIVIA. 

AREA TEEMS WITH ACTIVITY AND NEW WEALTH 

The Bolivian fronlier is bustling with activity: vasi new farming 
areas are being opened up for cotton, soya beans, and corn, 
pasture lands in the north are being developed as cattle ranches; 
new oii and gas discoveries are being made, mineral exploration 
is going lonward; and plans are underway for a steel mill complex 
using natural gas for energy with estimated reserves of 40 billion 
tons of iron and manganese. 

A REPORT BY THE BOLIVIAN — UTAH STATE/USAID STUDY 
TEAfvl IN 1972 CONCLUDED. . &quot;THE EASTERN PLAINS OF 
BOLIVIA SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE WORLD&apos;S 
OUTSTANDING POTENTIALS FOR AGRICULTURE DEVELOP- 
MENT.&quot; THIS POTENTIAL CAN BE YOUR &quot;GROUND FLOOR&quot; 
OPPORTUNITY. 

All of these aclivities are centered around the City o( Santa Cruz 
de la Sierra, the booming capital of the State of Santa Cruz and 
Bolivia&apos;s second largest city. Santa Cruz de la Sierra was founded 
over 400 years ago. but it was connected to the outside world by 
little more than an ox can trail until a paved road was completed 
in 1955 Then oil and natural gas were discovered, making 
Bolivia more than sell sufficient in petroleum (gasoline is just 40 
cents a gallon in Santa Cruz) The oil and gas discoveries were 
followed by the boom in cotton. Today. Santa Cruz is a major 
producer of oil, natural gas, cotton, sugar, rice, corn, wheat and 
cattle. There is a petroleum refinery, 16 cotton gins, 5 edible oil 
extraction plants, 4 sugar mills and a burgeoning industrial park. 
There are plans for a cement mill, a can-making factory, a paper 
mill and a major textile plant. 

The State Government of Santa Cnjz has an average income of 
$20 million from oil royalties and has used this money wisely to 
encourage the industries and services needed for full rapid 
development. Santa Cruz de la Sierra has grown more than five 
fold from 42,476 in 1950 lo 255,566 in 1976, and is expected to 
reach over 800,000 by the turn of the century. 

This is still a frontier city, yet according to the New York Times 
of 4 December 1974 &quot;Unlike any other Bolivian city, Santa Cruz 
has a large and growing middle class . .&quot; Speaking of Santa 
Cruz, the Financial Times of London said: &quot;The Crucenos are 
renowned for Iheir independent mentality. The old world colon- 
naded streets echo to a cowboy philosophy of free enterprise and 
survival of the fittest. This is a place where people can gel things 
done&apos; is something you hear at every turn.&quot; (8 February 1977). 

People who want to &quot;get things done&quot; have been coming to the 
Stale of Sania Cruz First there was the Japanese immigration 
from Okinawa, and today 30 mites north of Santa Cruz de la Sierra 
is Ihe prosperous agricullural colony centered around the new 
Bolivian town of Okinawa. Then m Ihe 1960&apos;s the first large wave 
of English speaking Menoniles arrived, mostly from Manitoba, 
Canada and later more (rom Paraguay and fvlexico. This well 
known religious farming group, generally called Pennsylvania 
Dutch in the United Slates, were seeking rich fanning lands in a 
country where Ihey could live in peace with a minimum of 
governmental inlerference in their community affairs. They came 
to Sania Cruz, Bolivia&apos; 

Today there are about 11,000 Menonites in various farming 
communities. They are virtually self sufficient, raising their ov^^n 
fruits and vegetables, dairy products, poultry, beef and pork, plus 
large acreages devoled to cash crops, mostly soya beans, wheat 
and corn 

The Bolivian GovernmenI has indicated a willingness to accept 
European farmers from Rhodesia, Namibia and South Africa to 
setlle in its unpopulated areas, and this new immigration is just 
beginning While the foreign immigraiion has been going on, 
many industrious Bolivians fromother areas have also settled in 
Santa Cruz, 



According to the Wall Street Journal. Bolivia&apos;s economy 
shows strong elements of stability. {Feb 8, 1977) &quot;The mlla- 
tion rate . is infinitesimal by Latin standards&apos;&quot; (June 3, 1977) 
and &quot;Consumer prices rose 4 6% from 1975 lo 1976&quot; (The 
Times, Dec. 13, 1977) 

ENTERPRISING PEOPLE WANTED 

Bolivia is looking for enterprising people to help develop its 
resources. There is a generous tax incentive program for agri- 
cultural enterprises and there are boundless new business oppor- 
tunities in supplies and services to the burgeoning activity and 
populalion, Santa Cruz is well served by both Stale and loreign 
banks, including the First National Bank of Boston and the Bank of 
America. 

The State of Santa Cnjz is Bolivia&apos;s richest and biggest, with a 
populalion of around 700,000 and a third of the country&apos;s area. 
The population of Santa Cruz is growing al twice the rate of the 
rest of Bolivia, which has a tolal population of 4.7 million. Santa 
Cruz IS estimated to have 65 million acres of useable land, but 
only 2 million are being farmed. The land is the real wealth of 
Santa Cruz, and this is where Ihe opportunities are greatest 

&quot;As far as the eye can see. it&apos;s one vast area of potential farm 
land broken only by stands of virgin timber,&quot; Wall Street Jour- 
nal. (3 June, 1976). 

VIRGIN LANDS 

The Anglo Bolivian Land and Cattle Company has conducted a 
thorough search of the best undeveloped agricultural lands m 
Santa Cnjz We have screened hundreds of offers of undeveloped 
land and accepted only those with completely clear legal title, 
suitable soils, acceptable rainfall, and good access to the city of 
Santa Cruz de la Sierra. 

This IS heavily forested land, classified by ecologists as &quot;tem- 
perale dry to moist forest &quot; There is a sufficient rainfall of at least 
40 inches most years, mainly from November through March. 
Once cleared of forest and properly prepared, this land is ideal 
for cotton, soya beans, corn, wheat, pineapples and peanuts This 
IS not jungle land or tropical rain forest, such as is being cleared 
in parts oTthe Amazon oasin, Ecologists and soil scientists have 
serious doubts aboul the advisability of cleanng tropical rain 
forest for grazing and agriculture, but the temperate wooded 
lands of Santa Cruz are ideal for agricultural development. 

LAND READY FOR WORKING 

The undeveloped land can be immediately cleared for agri- 
culture, or just partially cleared, and in either case farmed 
individually or leased lo a tenant. Alternatively the land can be 
left in its natural state lor recreational use and value prowth. A 
small site can be cleared for a house Construction ofa simple 
but adequale dwelling cosls less than $5 per square foot. 

ACCESS TO SUPPLYS&amp;MARKETS 

All of the lands selected by Anglo Bolivian Land and Cattle 
Company are alongside or near major road projects or exist- 
ing railroads and have adequale road access 

LAND VALUES INCREASING 

In Ihe past, prime undeveloped land in Santa Cruz has ap- 
preciated between 15 to 20 percent annually There is, of course, 
no guarantee that this rate of increase in value will continue. 
Developed land generally has a far greater appreciation, and the 
ma|or opportunily is m improving the undeveloped land 

It must be remembered, though, that this is a frontier The 
weather is generally quite mild, bul it does sometimes get hot in 
the summer, and even down lo the low forties (Fahrenheit) during 
the winter There are insects Ihal bite The roads can occasionally 
be muddy during Ihe rainy season and dusty during the dry 
Transportation is mostly by four wheel drive vehicles and trucks. 

FERTILE SOIL — ABUNDANT GAME 

But ihis land has its own rewards. The soil is fertile, and the 
forest IS populated by a wide variety of game animals and birds 
the collared and while lipped peccary, white tailed and brochet 
deer, Iree turkeys, partridge, grouse and dove. Most of the other 
species are protected under Bolivian law including the jaguar, 
puma, ocelot, margay, brown capuchins, grey lox, coali and par- 
rots. The bird lite is prolilic. 



AN INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE 

Buying undeveloped land in Santa Cruz affords you the oppor- 
tunity of being a modern day pioneer helping to solve the Earth&apos;s 
growing food problem while profiting from your work, talent and 
enterprise. Furthermore, with good land management, you can 
also preserve much of Ihe native fauna and flora For the less 
active, it provides the basis for an appreciating investment with 
the added possibility of recreational use for second home 
development, camping, hunting and nature study 

It&apos;s something to think about for your children s future — any- 
thing Irom 160 acres to a solid square mile of land for them lo 
develop. This is an outstanding opportunity for them to learn 
about pioneering life m a developing country, 

EASY TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS 

Travelling lo Santa Caiz from Ihe United States is very simple 
Just come lo Miami and then board a Lloyds Aereo Boliviano 
Boeing 727 direcl to Santa Cnjz de la Sierra, which has its&apos; own 
international airport (and plans (o build a bigger one yet)i in Santa 
Cnjz you can stay at the modern Holiday Inn, Los Tajibos. or any 
number of other pleasanl hotels 

WE INVITE YOU TO VISIT US IN SANTA CRUZ 

Once you are in Sania Cruz, you&apos;ll probably want to explore the 
rest ol fascinating Bolivia the thriving capital of La Paz; the un- 
touched colonial cityof Sucre, the famous mining center of Potosi, 
once the largest City in the Western Hemisphere: the delightful 
flowering city of Cochabamba. the beautiful Lake Ticicaca. and 
many virtually unexplored Inca archiological sites. 

MODERN FRONTIER OPPORTUNITY 

During the days of the American frontier, the pioneer v/as of- 
fered a quarter of a square mile — 160 acres — under the Home- 
stead Act for clearing and planting the land, and building a suit- 
able dwelling. Today, in the State of Santa Cruz, you can pur- 
chase and secure clear tiiie to a 160 acre homestead for just 
$2,950, with a low down payment of $295 and the balance pay- 
able over two years with 6 percent interest on the unpaid balance 
This works out to monthly payments of $117.67. with a total of 
$169. 1 1 in interest over the two year period. Larger tracts, up to a 
solid square mile — 640 acres, are priced at £9.950 with $995 
down and the balance in three years with 6 percent interest on the 
unpaid balance, making a monthly payment of $272 43, with a 
total of $852 42 in interest over the three year period. Naturally, 
these tracts can be purchased for cash, or prepaid at any time 
without penalty 

We are so sure ol these values, that we are willing to offer you a 
full money back guarantee, both principal and interest, if you visit 
Santa Cruz within one year of purchase and are dissatisfied for 
any reason. 

If you are interested in business opportunities in Santa Cnjz. we 
are currently seeking buyers or investors for cotton farming, beef 
fattening and cattle breeding ventures.

Will the universe expand forever or 
will it begin to contract? How do 
supernovae occur? What are the 
chances of communicating with 
other intelligent species in the gal- 
axy? What is the energy source of 
quasars? And so on. 

None of these questions is dis- 
cussed at any length in the first 
section; most of them are not dis- 
cussed at all. Just as distressing as 
the omissions is the clear indication 
that the editors do not know the 
difference between important and 
unimportant topics. Abdus Salam, 
one of the great names in physics, 
writes an excellent article on 
the nature of matter — a topic of 
major importance — that is only a 
page and a half long, while more 
than nine pages are spent on a de- 
tailed discussion of the atomic nu- 
cleus, which is of interest to spe- 
cialists only. 

Confusion reigns. John Wheeler 
is allowed to reprint a highly tech- 
nical scientific paper on the micro- 
structure of matter, which hardly 
anyone without an advanced de- 
gree in physics can understand. 
One is surprised to see the same 
subject discussed more understand- 
ably and more briefly only a few 
pages later by Paul Davies. One 
contributor, Thomas Gold, is per- 
mitted to write exactly four para- 
graphs on his chosen subject, rela- 
tivity and time. Almost all the 
articles are heavy with mathemat- 
ics, and nothing is defined for the 
sake of the ordinary reader — noth- 
ing at all. 

Someone who knows a great deal 
already and works very hard may 
get some useful information out of 
the first section. The same informa- 
tion can be gotten more easily from 
many other sources. 

The second section, on the life 
sciences and earth sciences, is 
better, but only by comparison. It 
has one completely successful ar- 
ticle, by John Maynard Smith, on 
the limitations of evolutionary 
theory, and several others that are 
worth reading. But again, the evi- 
dence of poor editing and ignorance 
of the subject matter are every- 
where. 

Three of the most exciting sub- 
jects in the life sciences are slow 
viruses, recombinant DNA re- 
search (or gene splicing, if you 
will), and brain chemistry. The first 
two are not mentioned at all; the 
third is mentioned only in passing.

Just to show how the editors 
handle their subjects, on page 367 
a brain chemical is spelled &quot;en- 
kephaline&quot; and defined as &quot;a natu- 
rally occurring substance in the 
brain&quot; that &quot;has narcotic prop- 
erties.&quot; It is spelled &quot;enkephalin&quot; 
and defined as &quot;a specific opiate 
receptor in the brain&quot; on page 372. 

The first writer has the spelling 
wrong and the definition right, 
while the second writer has the 
spelling right and the definition 
wrong. A reader is entitled to won- 
der about the level of expertise 
shown by an editor who will allow 
such an obvious inconsistency to 
get into print. A reader is also al- 
lowed to wonder about the level of 
knowledge of an editor who de- 
votes more space to a discussion of 
the unanswered questions of leaf 
structure and function than to a dis- 
cussion of the unanswered ques- 
tions of immunology. Leaf struc- 
ture may be interesting; immunol- 
ogy is a matter of life and death. 

One could go on and on. Why 
have Ewan Cameron and Linus 
Pauling been allowed to present 
their enormously controversial (to 
be as polite as possible about it) 
theory that vitamin C prevents 
cancer? Why has a literary gentle- 
man whose only listed qualification 
is &quot;a strong interest in the philo- 
sophical implications of the life 
sciences&quot; been allowed to write a 
paper based on the untenable state- 
ment that the Darwinian view of 
evolution has been discredited? 
Why is a writer allowed to get away 
with a sentence like this: &quot;A frag- 
ment of the toxin, known as frag- 
ment A, which has a molecular 
weight of 24,000 D and is released 
from the complete toxin by trypsin 
and dithreitol, has been shown to 
catalyse the transfer of adenosine 
diphospho-ribose from diphospho- 
pyridine nucleotide (NAD) coen- 
zyme to an enzyme known as elon- 
gation factor 2 (EF2, aminoacyl 
transferase I), translocase IL&quot; 

That last sentence gives the gen- 
eral flavor of the book. Not much 
more need be said, except that even 
in these days of high book prices, 
$20.00 seems excessive for two 
paperback volumes (one volume in 
hardcover) that total 433 pages and 
are generous with white space.

Hunting the Elusive Vela Pulsar 



Time, patience, and the 
newest equipment were 
needed to track down this 
dim object 

After eight years of searching, 
astronomers have finally detected 
a second optical pulsar. The first 
was found in 1969 in the Crab 
nebula. By now, almost everyone 
has heard of pulsars, those strange 
sources of evenly spaced beeps, or 
&quot;pulses,&quot; of radio waves, which 
were discovered in 1967. They are 
interpreted as being highly magne- 
tized, rapidly spinning compact ob- 
jects — so-called neutron stars. A 
typical neutron star may be smaller 
than New York City, yet contain 
as much matter as our sun and 
possess a magnetic field stronger 
than any yet produced in the labora- 
tory. A neutron star can be formed 
by the collapse of the central core 
of a massive star in its death throes, 
during a supernova explosion. As 
the neutron star spins, it sends 
radio waves into space in narrow 
beams that sweep around like the 
rotating beacon of a lighthouse. 
When a pulsar beam strikes the 
earth, we observe a radio pulse. 
Hence the interval between succes- 
sive pulses is the rotation period of 
the neutron star. 

As soon as the discovery of pul- 
sars was announced, optical astron- 
omers — myself among them — be- 
gan to search for visible light 
flashes from these objects. Many 
pulsars were examined without 
success until astronomers at the 
University of Arizona detected light 
from the pulsar in the Crab nebula. 
These optical pulses came from a 



dim star in the center of the nebula 
which appears on many photo- 
graphs and had even been men- 
tioned in 1942 as the possible rem- 
nant core of the supernova that pro- 
duced the nebula. The pulses had 
never been noticed because they 
come about 60 times a second (the 
Crab pulsar has a spin period of 
1/30 of a second, but has two nearly 
equally spaced pulses in each 
period). Thus, the Crab pulsar is 
much like a fluorescent light bulb 
that runs on the normal 60-cycle 
alternating current: it flashes on and 
oif but so rapidly that to the human 
eye and brain, and of course on a 
photographic time exposure, it 
seems to be a steady source of light. 
(This doesn&apos;t happen with an in- 
candescent bulb because the tung- 
sten filament doesn&apos;t have time to 
cool during the brief instant the 
alternating current goes to zero.) 

The characteristic that distin- 
guished the Crab pulsar from all the 
others we had unsuccessfully moni- 
tored was its rapid pulse period. 
The others had periods of from 
about V-x second to 2 seconds. 
Radio observations showed that 
these intervals were gradually 
lengthening. The effect is almost 
imperceptible, but over astronom- 
ical periods of time, it can change 
a fast pulsar into a slow one. The 
spinning neutron stars are slowing 
down, and theorists suggested that 
as part of the process they also lose 
the power to produce visible pulses. 

Given the above suggestion, we 
turned our attention to the second- 
fastest of the then-known pulsars. 
This object is PSR 0833-45, the Vela 
pulsar, named for its location in 
Vela X, a scattered nebulosity pro- 



duced in a supernova explosion 
that occurred some 10,000 to 30,000 
years ago. Located deep in the 
southern sky, PSR 0833-45 is only 
barely accessible to Northern 
Hemisphere observatories and 
hence had been neglected until its 
special importance as a fast pulsar 
became apparent in early 1969. 

The Arizona group had noted 
that the light of the Crab pulsar was 
blue. With this as a clue, they ex- 
amined photographs of the Vela 
pulsar region that were made in 
light of different colors with a 24- 
inch telescope at the Cerro Tololo 
Inter-American Observatory in 
Chile. The available radio measure- 
ment of the Vela pulsar position 
was of limited accuracy; thus it 
was necessary to study a small box 
in the sky, surrounding this posi- 
tion, known as the &quot;error rec- 
tangle.&quot; They found only one no- 
tably blue star in the rectangle and 
reported a tentative &quot;suggestion of 
faint nebular wisps emanating from 
the star,&quot; but admitted that these 
were so faint that their nature was 
uncertain. Nevertheless, they pro- 
posed the error rectangle blue star, 
later named &quot;K,&quot; as a likely candi- 
date for the visible-light counterpart 
of the Vela pulsar. Of course, con- 
firmation would require the detec- 
tion of optical pulses from the star. 

The hunt for the Vela pulsar then 
went into full swing. In the first 
quarter of 1969, observations were 
made by groups at Cerro Tololo and 
at the McDonald Observatory in 
Texas, the Mount Stromlo Observa- 
tory near Canberra, Australia, and 
the Radcliffe Telescope in Pretoria, 
South Africa. Several observers 
established that the light of star K is

riot pulsed and that if any optical 
pulsar was present in the Vela re- 
gion, its magnitude must be so faint 
as to be beyond the range of stand- 
ard observatory atlases, such as the 
Palomar Observatory Sky Survey. 

In March 1969, radio astronomers 
in Australia and at the Jet Propul- 
sion Laboratory (JPL) in California 
were astounded to find that the 
gradually slowing beat of the Vela 
pulsar had abruptly quickened and 
then slowed down again. This 
event, the first known pulsar 
&quot;glitch,&quot; has been attributed to a 
&quot;starquake,&quot; or surface disturb- 
ance in the neutron star, although 
the true cause remains uncertain. 
In any case, the discovery of 
glitches was to have a significant 
implication for subsequent optical 
searches. 

The &quot;hunting season&quot; for the 
Vela pulsar runs from December to 
March, as the object is then best 
placed for optical observation. Ac- 
cordingly, there were no more 
searches until December 7, 1969, 
when a Hale Observatories astro- 
physicist turned the powerful 200- 
inch telescope on Palomar Moun- 
tain in the direction of Vela. The 
purpose was to monitor the small 
error rectangle corresponding to a 
new determination of the pulsar&apos;s 
radio position, as reported by JPL 
radio astronomers. The new posi- 
tion was found by analyzing the 
times at which the radio pulses 
were received, rather than by map- 
ping the Vela region with the JPL 
radio telescope. A pulsar position 
determined in this manner is called 
a &quot;timing position.&quot;

cision of the new position and its

consequent small error rectangle, 
no optical pulses were observed, 
leading to the conclusion that the 
pulsar must be no brighter than the 
24th magnitude, or at least 100 
times fainter than the star K. The 
Palomar measurements were very 
difficult to make, since the pulsar is 
only observable from that location 
for a short time each night and then 
only under fine atmospheric condi- 
tions near the horizon, where they 
usually are poor. After this work, 
the hunt shifted to observatories in 
the Southern Hemisphere, where 
Vela is better placed for optical 
study. 

Until 1970, the apparatus used to 
search for light from the pulsar had 
as its principal component a photo- 
electric photometer, a device that 
measures the intensity of light from 
only one location at a time. All of 
the observations had been made 
with this kind of equipment and all 
of them had failed. During 1969, I 
discussed the status of the search 
with my colleague Hong-Yee Chiu, 
an authority on neutron stars. We 
concluded that a new approach was 
required, one that would enable us 
to search for the pulsar at a large 
number of adjacent sky locations 
simultaneously. In effect, we de- 
cided to search an area wider than 
the reported radio error rectangles, 
but without requiring an impractical 
amount of telescope time to study 
the many individual stars in the 
region one at a time. 

The period between the radio 
pulses of the Vela pulsar is about 
89 milliseconds (thousandths of a 
second) and the duration of each 
pulse is only 1/20 of that period. 
What Chiu and I wanted to do was 
to take about twenty evenly spaced 
pictures of the pulsar region during 
such a period and see if an other- 
wise invisible star &quot;turned on&quot; 
during one of the exposures. The 
difficulty was that such an exposure 
time (about 41/2 milliseconds) is so 
short that a photograph — even if 
made with the world&apos;s largest tele- 
scope — would not record the fainter 
stars. We had to be able to make a 
time exposure in which the camera 
shutter would open once every 89 
milliseconds and remain open for 
just 4&apos;/2 milliseconds. Further, we 
needed at least twenty such photo- 
graphs, each properly phased with 
respect to the others, so that each 
interval of 4&apos;/2 milliseconds within 
the basic 89-millisecond period

would be covered by a separate time 
exposure. Then we would be sure to 
catch the pulsar (if it were bright 
enough) in one of the pictures. Chiu 
designed an electromechanical 
system — the &quot;pulsar hunter&quot; — for 
this task and we mated the system to 
an image-intensifier camera de- 
veloped by Roger Lynds of the Kitt 
Peak National Observatory in 
Arizona. This camera converts faint 
starlight to much brighter green 
light that can be photographed with 
a short exposure time. 

After successful field tests at Kitt 
Peak, in which we made a photo 
sequence showing the Crab pulsar 
blinking on and oflf, we took the 
equipment to Cerro Tololo. There, 
during four nights in January 1970, 
we obtained dozens of photographs 
of the Vela pulsar region with the 
pulsar hunter mounted on a 60-inch 
telescope. No star answering to the 
expected description of the pulsar 
(flashing on once in each series of 
about twenty photographs) was 
found. But one tantalizing starlike 
object did appear on two pictures 
in one series. The two exposures 
were separated by about 8 milli- 
seconds within the pulsar period. 
The object appeared at the same 
spot on each of them, but it was not 
visible on the single exposure that 
was taken between the two or on 
any of the other photographs. If this 
was the Vela pulsar, then it had a 
double optical pulse, rather than a 
single one as observed with radio 
telescopes. We eventually decided 
that the object was probably caused 
by a temporary electrical instru- 
ment flaw, as it would otherwise 
have appeared in one of our other 
photo series. 

Our photographs established that 
the Vela pulsar must be fainter 
than magnitude 24.8. As a further 
effort, Lynds took seventy-five of 
our finest exposures and pain- 
stakingly superimposed them to ob- 
tain a composite print showing the 
faintest possible stars. This com- 
posite, much better than previous 
pictures of the Vela pulsar region, 
showed that the nebular wisps sus- 
pected near star K by the Arizona 
astronomers did not exist. The 
search had to go on. 

In the late summer of 1970, a 
leading Italian pulsar theorist com- 
pleted a calculation indicating that 
the light of the Vela pulsar might 
be of the 25th magnitude, or slightly 
fainter than the value our observa-

tions had reached. In May 1971, 
radio astronomers made new meas- 
urements of the positions of nine 
pulsars with the interferometer 
radio telescope at the National 
Radio Astronomy Observatory 
(NRAO) in Green Bank, West Vir- 
ginia. In eight cases, they found 
the positions to be in good agree- 
ment with those determined by 
timing the reception of radio pulses. 
The single exception was the 
Vela pulsar. If the NRAO posi- 
tion was correct, then the pulsar 
was situated outside the timing 
position error rectangle that the 
Palomar observer had studied. Chiu 
and I were therefore right to have 
studied a larger area with the pulsar 
hunter even though the pulsar 
proved too faint for us to record. 

In late August 1971, the JPL 
radio astronomers observed a 
second glitch in the radio pulses 
from Vela. This suggested a pos- 
sible explanation for the discrep- 
ancy between the timing and the 
NRAO positions. Perhaps smaller 
glitches had occasionally occurred. 
If unrecognized, they would not be 
taken into account in the determina- 
tion of the timing position derived 
from the arrival times of the radio 
pulses, and this position would 
therefore be wrong. On the other 
hand, critics of the NRAO work 
pointed out that the pulsar was 
necessarily observed very close to 
the horizon at Green Bank, and 
hence the NRAO measurements 
might be unreliable. 

A star, &quot;C,&quot; had appeared on 
our composite photo near the 
NRAO position and was the subject 
of observation by Barry Lasker of 
the Cerro Tololo staff during the 
1972 pulsar season. Using a pho- 
tometer and the 60-inch telescope, 
he also surveyed several positions 
on the south side of the error rec- 
tangle corresponding to the NRAO 
position. However, due to the 
time-consuming nature of the pho- 
tometer method, the northern half 
of the rectangle was neglected. No 
pulses were detected from C, or 
from the other observed locations. 
In retrospect we know that had the 
survey been extended to the north- 
ern part of the rectangle, in all prob- 
ability the pulsar would have been 
found. 

In February 1973, physicists at 
the Goddard Space Flight Center 
discovered gamma rays from the 
Vela pulsar with an instrument 



carried on the SAS-2 satellite. Sur- 
prisingly, they found that there are 
two gamma-ray pulses per pulsar 
period, as contrasted with the single 
radio pulse. I got out our 1970 ob- 
servations and studied the apparent 
double-pulsed star that we had re- 
jected as a pair of instrumental 
flaws. However, the spacing of the 
purported optical pulses was quite 
different from that of the gamma- 
ray pulses, so I again rejected the 
optical images. 

In the meantime, two University 
of Sydney scientists had set out to 
resolve the discrepancy between 
the timing and the NRAO position 
for the Vela pulsar. With the aid of a 
large antenna at the Molonglo Radio 
Observatory in New South Wales, 
they determined a supposedly more 
accurate position, close to a star 
designated &quot;A&quot; that had been 
briefly studied at Cerro Tololo. On 
February 25, 1973, star A was again 
observed at Cerro Tololo but no 
evidence of pulsed light was found. 
The hunt for the Vela pulsar now 
seemed at a dead end. Three radio 
observatories had provided posi- 
tions for the pulsar, each position 
had been studied by optical astron- 
omers, and no optical pulses had 
been found. The search was aban- 
doned until early 1975, when a large 
new reflector, the 4-meter tele- 
scope, had been erected at Cerro 
Tololo and was under test. 

As part of the tests, Lasker 
photographed the Vela pulsar 
region in three colors of light. A 
faint blue star termed &quot;M&quot; was 
found even closer to the Molonglo 
position than A. Four hours of 
photometer monitoring of this star 
with the 60-inch telescope failed to 
reveal optical pulses. Nevertheless, 
Lasker proposed M as the latest and 
best candidate for the Vela pulsar 
with the suggestion that if its blue 
light was unpulsed, the light must 
then correspond to the actual glow 
of the hot neutron star surface, 
rather than to the beamed pulses 
that arise from plasma in the star&apos;s 
magnetic field. 

In March 1975. a group of Aus- 
tralian radio astronomers, including 
one from Sydney, began a new 
observing program. This time, two 
large radio telescopes were inde- 
pendently directed at the pulsar, 
and the results were averaged to get 
the best possible measurement. By 
the time this work was completed 
in the fall of 1976. a 3.9-meter re- 



90 



flector telescope was in operation 
in Australia. In January 1977, an 
Austraiian-Britisii team of astron- 
omers led by P. T. Wallace used 
this telescope and an improved type 
of photometer to optically search 
the latest radio position. At four 
locations in the error rectangle, 
they monitored the light from a tiny 
area of the sky, and from two of the 
areas, which happened to overlap, 
light pulses from Vela were at long 
last detected. The Vela pulsar had 
been optically measured. Star M is 
in the area of overlap but whether 
M is the pulsar is not confirmed. 

In contrast to the Crab pulsar, 
which emits simultaneous pulses in 
the radio, optical. X-ray, and 
gamma-ray wavelength regions 
twice in each period, the Vela pul- 
sar has one radio pulse, two optical 
pulses, and two gamma-ray pulses, 
but no detectable X-ray pulses. Of 
the five pulses that it does produce, 
none are generated simultaneously. 
The brightness of the pulsar, a time- 
averaged magnitude of 25, is just 
what the Italian theorist Franco 
Pacini had predicted in 1970. Allow- 
ing for their respective distances 
from the earth and correcting for the 
diflFerent amounts of interstellar 
dust absorption, this means that the 
true brightness of the Vela pulsar 
is 20,000 times less than that of the 
Crab pulsar. Star M, being in the 
right position, may well be the Vela 
piilsar, but if so, there is a discrep- 
ancy in some of the measurements. 
Alternatively, the pulsar may be 
invisible on existing photographs. 

Although the brightness of the 
Vela pulsar was correctly calcu- 
lated, its second optical pulse and 
the nonsimultaneity of the pulses in 
diiferent wavelength regions were 
not predicted. Formerly, we knew 
of only one optical pulsar — that in 
the Crab nebula — and hence felt 
free to draw analogies from it. Now 
that we have two optical pulsars 
with unaccountably diflFerent prop- 
erties, any extrapolations drawn 
from them are a priori questionable. 
Once again, a major observational 
discovery has left us more puzzled 
than we were before it was 
achieved.

unusually effective, unusually inexpensive 
telescope anyone can use to get into this 
exciting hobby The Astroscan 2001 gives 
you a window on the world beyond that 
which you have ever known. 

We&apos;ve devoted more than two years 
of concentrated engineering and product 
development to produce this special instru- 
ment. Our objectives were simple but chal- 
lenging. The newest Edmund Scientific tele- 
scope had to: • give bright, clear views of 
the stars, the planets, the moon • be light- 
weight for extreme portability; convenient 
for hikes, bike trips, vacations • be simple to 
set up and use so anyone, even a young child, 
could enjoy the exciting hobby of astronomy 
• and, most important, be affordable! 

The result of this intensive program is 
Astroscan 2001, a telescope so different and 
so precise even professional astronomers 
have raved about it. And at just $149.95 it&apos;s 
one of the best telescope buys available. 

The 2001 is a classic Newtonian reflector 
telescope, using the same basic optical de- 
sign&apos; as the largest observatory instruments.

A Matter of Taste 



by Raymond 



— T 

i Sokolov I 



As a Matter of Fat . . . 



Edible fats and oils are 
essential to our cuisines 

From the window in the place 
where I work, above the ware- 
houses of Manhattan&apos;s commercial 
meat market, I see a tallow firm&apos;s 
big trucks hauling away loads of 
fat. In New Jersey, they will dump 
their white, greasy cargo into vats 
and heat it to 230°F, until the pro- 
tein within the fatty mass coagulates 
and can be strained away (at home, 
on a smaller scale. Grandma did the 
same thing, passing around the 
savory cracklings, little knotted- 
brown treasures of flavor), leaving 
the plain fat to be saponified with 
lye. As soap in scented bars, the 
suet comes back to town. 

On this industrial scale, or in 
Grandma&apos;s traditional hands, fat 
has a value . But it is a quirk of mod- 
ern life that fat, which was once a 
prized part of meat, is now dis- 
dained, shunned as poison. The 
warriors of the IliaJ barded the 
sacrificial viands of their &quot;equal 
feast&quot; with rich envelopes of fat. 
The author of the first book of 
Samuel counsels: &quot;. . .to obey is 
better than sacrifice, and to hearken 
than the fat of rams [15:22].&quot; But 
we treat fat as garbage because our 
sedentary, long lives spent in over- 
heated buildings no longer require 
the calorific stoking that fat fuels in 
the body. 



Fat is the ideal source of food 
energy. With an average potential 
of 9.3 calories per gram, fat pro- 
duces roughly twice the energy of 
proteins or carbohydrates. The 
body absorbs and stores 94 to 98 
percent of ingested fat — under the 
skin in unglamorous rolls of pudge; 
some say, in cholesterol plaques on 
progressively hardening artery 
walls. The plaques may cause heart 
attacks (although recent evidence 
casts doubt on the cholesterol/cor- 
onary theory). Obesity certainly 
strains the heart. In a desk-bound 
culture, we don&apos;t need the energy 
people once did who chopped wood 
all winter. Preventive medicine, by 
prolonging life spans, has also in- 
creased the prevalence of degenera- 
tive disease, has given the heart 
time to break down under its bur- 
den of adiposity. And so, even if it 
turns out that low-cholesterol diets 
do not reduce the accumulation of 
arterial plaques (as butter lovers 
learned with pleasure from a report 
late last year), gobbling fat with 
abandon will still be a nutritional 
mistake. 

The trouble is that the traditional 
diet or cuisines we have inherited 
from the past depend heavily on 
fats, technically and for their flavor. 
The fear of frying felt by modern 
dieters may have a basis in nutri- 
tional fact, but our taste buds tell us 
that food sauteed without butter or 



oil on nonstick surfaces is insipid. 
How else can we achieve the crisp- 
ness of deep-fried potatoes or dump- 
lings or fish if not by &quot;surprising&quot; 
these foods in the high heat that 
deep fat conducts? Boiling water 
will only transmit its maximum 
temperature of 212°F. But corn oil 
permits the instantaneous submer- 
sion of breaded salmon escalopes 
into a medium that is uniformly 
conducting heat at 375°. Done 
properly, deep-frying does not soak 
food in fat. On the contrary, appro- 
priately high temperatures seize the 
outside of the food, brown it, and 
leave the inside heated — cooked 
through but never overcooked. 
This makes deep-frying the opti- 
mum method for such delicate 
foods as fish, which are so easily 
damaged by slower heating tech- 
niques. The amount of oil that per- 
meates correctly fried food, while 
not negligible, is far less than the 
sight of a full, working, smoking 
fryolator at a fast-food counter 
might suggest. 

In contemporary America the 
overall prejudice against fat has un- 
fortunately subverted taste well 
beyond the point that dietary cau- 
tion demands. My children cut 
away delicious pieces of browned 
fat at the edge of chops. Chefs, 
similarly, are turning their backs on 
roux (flour browned in butter) to 
thicken sauces. Readers recoil in

—CHICAGO TRIBUNE 

All around you. wherever you and your family go, an in- 
/\credible. &quot;&apos;stranger-than-fiction&quot; story is unfolding ... a 
story of rare drama and fascination, yet one which few people 
are trained to observe and understand. It&apos;s the remarkable, on- 
going story of Life on Earth — and now it&quot;s opened up for you 
and your family to enjoy in a marvellous new volume from 
Newsweek Books. 

Clams that have feet and jump . . . fish that &quot;walk&quot; on 
river bottoms . . . spiders that eat birds . . . ants that keep 
aphids like we keep cows, milking them regularly for food — 
these are just a few of the wonders you&apos;ll learn about in &quot;Life 
on Earth.&quot; From the simplest plant forms to the incredible in- 
sect world to the unbelievable denizens of the sea — from birds 
to reptiles to jungle and forest creatures ... a dazzling variety 
of life forms is yours to savor in glorious color photos and 
illuminating te.xt. 

This big sweeping volume tells you (and the young stu- 
dents in your family) how living things are structured — how 
they adapt, evolve, reproduce and pass on their hereditary 
characteristics. And, vitally important for everyone who can 
be reached with the message, it dramatizes the necessity of 
preserving our ecology and preventing the exploitation of the 
past. 

At just $19.95, this superb volume will be a delightful 
addition to the library of anyone who loves plants and nature, 
history, folklore, or just beautiful books. .Available at fine 
bookstores everywhere. Or order direct with the coupon — 
money back if not completely pleased.

; horror from pie crust recipes that 

I use lard, which is not only the tra- 

I ditional American way with pie 

crusts, but also a superior route to 

flakiness than butter. 

The national antilard bias is part 
of a generalized aversion to unfa- 
miliar animal fats (and cuts of meat) 
that has sprung up in a culture 
utterly divorced from agricultural 
life and fixated on a very limited 
number of cattle products. The 
trend has rapidly led in the last 
twenty years to the point where 
hamburger, steak, and butter are 
practically the only acceptable solid 
animal foods. 

Few children today have ever 
seen lard or know that it is rendered 
pork fat. How many adults, even, 
are aware that suet (once highly 
prized) is the hard fat from the loins 
and from around the kidneys of beef 
cattle? Worse yet, a seemingly 
authoritative general cookbook 
published only a few years ago 
advised junking the delicious fat 
that tries out of geese and ducks 
during roasting. 

This constriction of knowledge 
brings with it a narrowing of plea- 
sure. Fats from different sources 
taste and act diflferently. I cannot 
say what Middle Eastern food 
would taste like if prepared in the 
ancient manner, with fat from the 
tails of sheep. But there is no ques- 
tion in my mind that the French 
were right to call duck and goose 
fats les graisses nobles. To test 
this, save the drippings from your 
next duck and use them to make that 
very unctuous pate of the Loire 
region called rillettes (recipe be- 
low). The fat is the key ingredient, 
as I was told when I was introduced 
to this apparently primitive spread 
at a press conference inside the 
Paris headquarters of the Banque 
Rothschild. At the world-famous 
Troisgros restaurant in Roanne, in 
France&apos;s Beaujolais country, they 
serve an extremely rarefied thrush 
pate also based on duck fat. 

In simpler times, the complex 
individuality of the various fats — 
their separate identity — was part of 
life. This vanished diversity is still 
enshrined in their names, which 
sprang up separately in languages 
that usually share cognates. Lard, 
for instance, may go back to a 
Greek term for fattened meat, but 
that meat was not always pork. 
English speakers must simply have 
needed a special word for rendered 



pork fat and fastened on &quot;lard.&quot; In 
France, confusingly, lard means 
fatback or, in the phrase lard de 
poiirine, a version of bacon. When 
the French want to say &quot;lard,&quot; 
they fall back on a curious and 
antique word, saindoux. which is a 
combination oi doii.x (soft or gentle) 
and a reflex of the Latin sagina, 
meaning, at various periods: stuff- 
ing, food, a fattened animal, and 
obesity. One authority adds that 
sain once meant the fat of the wild 
boar. 

Meanwhile, in Spain, lard was 
named manteca, on etymological 
grounds now shrouded in mystery. 
One thing is clear, lard was once, 
if it is not still, the preeminent ani- 
mal fat in the Hispanic world. Lard 
has given its name to butter: mante- 
qiiilki (butter) is the diminutive of 
manteca. 

These are not just linguistic curi- 
osities. The disappearing diversity 
of fats and oils may indeed have 
been the most crucial determining 
factor in the development of tradi- 
tional cuisines. Waverley Root, in 
his classic The Food of France, 
divided France into gastronomic 
sections defined by the particular 
fat each preferred: butter for the 
capital region, olive oil for Pro- 
vence, goose fat for the southwest, 
and so on. But underneath this fatty 
pluralism lies an essential unity. 
Butter, lard, suet, goose fat, duck 
fat, peanut oil, palm oil, and canned 
vegetable shortening are all mem- 
bers of one chemical group. 
Whether they are pressed from 
seeds or rendered from porcine leaf 
fat or churned from milk, edible 
fats and oils are all basically organic 
chemicals that come about when 
the acid glycerol is linked with one 
or more of the so-called fatty acids. 
This chemical hybrid is a kind of 
ester called glyceride. In edible 
fats, the glyceride molecule typi- 
cally has three long, straight fatty 
acid chains with even numbers of 
carbon atoms and is, therefore, a 
triglyceride. (Monoglycerides and 
diglycerides are closely related to 
fats and oils and are used as addi- 
tives in packaged food products to 
improve texture and increase shelf 
life.) 

The carbon chains of the fatty 
acids are bonded on both sides with 
hydrogen atoms. If all the possible 
carbon bonds are occupied by hy- 
drogen atoms, the fat is said to be 
saturated. If one or more of the

positions is empty — has no hydro- 
gen atom — then the fat is called un- 
saturated. Generally speaking, 
saturated fats are the ones that 
have been tagged as the villains in 
the cholesterol theory of heart 
disease. 

Whether this is true or not. the 
structure of the fatty acid chains 
does determine the difference be- 
tween fats and oils. Acids with 
fewer than 10 carbon atoms or with 
more than 10 carbon atoms but only 
one unsaturated hydrogen position 
are oils, that is, they remain liquid 
at ordinary temperatures. Fats 
solidify. 

Chemical structure also affects 
fats&apos; resistance to spoilage. The 
unsaturated fatty acids are more 
vulnerable to oxidation. Saturated 
fatty acids do not oxidize as easily 
and, therefore, are less subject to 
the malodorous condition we per- 
ceive as rancidity. Natural vitamin 
E in fats inhibits this process, but 
heat, light, and contact with copper 
and iron will all hasten rancidity. 
Refrigeration ought to have ended 
this problem for modern shoppers. 
But erratic, long supply networks 
sometimes bring spoiled butter to 
market. You can detect rancidity, 
even through paper wrapping, if 
you smell the butter before you 
buy it. 

Once you have the butter home, 
you can preserve it for weeks at a 
stretch in a freezer running, as it 
should, at 0°F. Or you can stabilize 
butter in the old fashioned way, 
through clarification. Here, there 
are two standard methods: one 
pure and French; the other less re- 
fined, more flavorful and Indian. 
Either one removes the cheesy milk 
solids that react so easily with bac- 
teria and that burn at a lower tem- 
perature than clarified butter. 

In the French method, melt but- 
ter and let it stand undisturbed for 
a half hour. By then, the milk solids 
will have settled. Spoon the clear 
butter into a clean container. 

In the Indian method, which pro- 
duces a nutty-brown substance 
called ghee, simply simmer the 
butter until the milk solids all burn 
and fall to the bottom of the pan. 
When the top of the butter has 
cleared, spoon it into a clean con- 
tainer. It will be much easier to 
make ghee or to clarify butter in the 
French manner, if you work with a 
pound of butter or more at a time. 
The quantity forestalls burning and 



also economizes your time. Either 
ghee or clarified butter can be 
heated to higher temperatures than 
regular butter. 

Now it is also true that neither 
ghee nor clarified butter can be 
heated nearly to the point that pea- 
nut and other vegetable oils can 
attain before they start to smoke 
and break down. But the taste of 
food sauteed in butter is incompa- 
rable, and that is the point of today&apos;s 
sermon — old-fashioned fats in all 
their variety broaden the enjoyment 
of human life. Join me then in a pro- 
test against two scientific travesties 
against fat: the spray-on, tasteless, 
no-stick butter substitute and, that 
ultimate betrayal of butterfat, ultra- 
pasteurized heavy cream, which 
has had its structural knees broken 
and will not expand properly when 
whipped. And while you wait for 
real cream to come back, enjoy — 
in moderation — the natural fats that 
are still around.

George Gaylord Simpson 

Concession to the Improbable 

An Unconventional Autobiography 

When a scientist of George Gaylord Simpson&apos;s stature turns to autobiography, his 
narrative becomes a sourcebook for the history of research in his fields during his 
lifetime. As entertaining as it is wise and informative, this book is an engaging 
portrait of an incredibly full and committed life. lUus. $15.00 

G. Evelyn Hutchinson 

An Introduction to Population Ecology 

Hutchinson, one of the founders of this growing and exciting field, presents a 
sophisticated study of the ways in which populations come to live together in 
biological communities. Blending mathematical analysis with observations of the 
life cycles of plants and animals, he discusses the questions of mortality, natality, 
and the genesis of stable age-structures, unispecific populations, competition, and 
ecological niche, both in theory and in practice. 141 illus. $17.50

Additional Reading 



Carolina Parakeet (p. 10) 

Arthur Cleveland Bent&apos;s Life 
Histories of North American 
Cuckoos, Goatsuckers, Humming- 
birds, and Their Allies, 2 vols. (New 
York: Dover Publications, Inc., 
1940, $4.00 each in paperback) is 
a reprint of a United States Na- 
tional Museum Bulletin on birds. 
Volume 1 has an extensive bibliog- 
raphy and devotes fourteen pages 
to some of the last field data on 
Carolina parakeets. Faith McNulty 
discusses political and ecological 
reasons why not all endangered ani- 
mals are saved in The Whooping 
Crane (New York: E. P. Dutton 
and Company, Inc., 1966). Birds in 
Peril: A Guide to the Endangered 
Birds of the United States and 
Canada, by John P. MacKenzie 
(Boston: Houghton Mifflin Com- 
pany, 1977), and James C. Green- 
way&apos;s Extinct and Vanishing Birds 
of the World (New York: Dover 
Publications, Inc., 1967, $5.00 in 
paperback) are sobering but infor- 
mative books on currently en- 
dangered bird species. 

House Mice (p. 38) 

Studies of the population biology 
of house mice, by British scientists 
motivated by the need to store great 
quantities of grain during World 
War II, are the basis for much of 
Peter Crowcroft&apos;s book Mice All 
Over (Chicago: Chicago Zoological 
Society, 1973). Both this book and 
hxsLife of the Shrew (London: Max 
Reinhart, 1957) are amusing, inter- 
esting, and scientifically sound. 
John B. Calhoun of the National 
Institute of Mental Health used rats 
and mice to produce models of hu- 
man behavior under the stress of 
population density. His &quot;Popula- 
tion Density and Social Pathology&quot; 
appeared in the February 1962 issue 
of Scientific American (pp. 139- 
48). J. H. Myers and C. J. Krebs 
used population statistics in an at- 
tempt to relate fluctuations of popu- 



lation, aggressive behavior, and 
genetic factors in &quot;Population Cy- 
cles in Rodents&quot; (Scientific Ameri- 
can, June 1974, pp. 38-46). &quot;Ge- 
netic Variation in Wild House 
Mice: Where Natural Selection and 
History Meet,&quot; by R. J. Berry 
(American Scientist, January-Feb- 
ruary 1978, pp. 52-60), discusses 
genetic variety in wild mouse pop- 
ulations on a Welsh island. 

Holy Weelt in Seville (p. 44) 

Two general books on Spain and 
Spanish values are People of the 
Sierra (2nd edition), by Julian Pitt- 
Rivers (Chicago: University of 
Chicago Press, 1972, a $3.45 paper- 
back), and Gerald Brenan&apos;s South 
from Granada (New York: Octagon 
Books, 1976). One of the best an- 
thropological studies of Spanish 
religious themes is Person and God 
in a Spanish Valley, by William 
Christian (New York: Academic 
Press, Inc., 1972). James Mich- 
ener&apos;s Iberia: Spanish Travels and 
Refiections (New York: Fawcett 
World Library, Crest Books, 1976, 
$2.50) offers a good overview, but 
is incorrect in some details. An 
informative book on Franco Spain, 
somewhat dated but very enjoy- 
able, is The Face of Spain, by 
Gerald Brenan (New York: Octagon 
Books, 1976). 

Seeds (p. 56) 

Nature as Designer: A Botanical 
Art Study, by Bertel Bager (New 
York: Van Nostrand Reinhold 
Company, 1966), and William M. 
Harlow&apos;s Art Forms from Plant Life 
(New York: Dover Publications, 
Inc.. 1974, in paperback) reveal 
through striking black-and-white 
photos the elegant geometric forms 
and structures of plants. Structure, 
Form and Movement, by Heinrich 
Hertel (New York: Van Nostrand 
Reinhold Company, 1966), is an 
illustrated technical work that re- 
lates biology and engineering. It 



covers birds, insects, fruits, and 
fish, and the chapter on seeds dis- 
cusses the flight paths of 
anemochores. A fast-moving work 
on the functions of plants, with a 
good bibliography, is Plant and 
Planet, by Anthony Huxley (New 
York: The Viking Press, Inc., 1975). 
Amply illustrated. The Amazing 
Seeds, by Ross E. Hutchins (New 
York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 
1965), includes information on size, 
shape, germination, methods of 
dispersal, and dormancy of seeds. 

Santorini Volcano (p. 70) 

The Santorini Volcano and the 
Desolation of Minoan Crete, fiy 
Denys Lionel Page (London: So- 
ciety for the Promotion of Hellenic 
Studies, 1970), is a concise study 
with a good bibliography and many 
maps and illustrations. Three chap- 
ters of Dorothy B. Vitaliano&apos;s Leg- 
ends of the Earth: Their Geologic 
Origins (Bloomington: Indiana Uni- 
versity Press, 1973) discuss San- 
torini. A more scientific work, 
&quot;Volume and Extent of the Minoan 
Tephra from Santorini Volcano: 
New Evidence from Deep-sea Sedi- 
ment Cores,&quot; by N. D. Watkins et 
al., containing information gathered 
on the Trident research expedition, 
appeared in the January 12, 1978, 
issue of Nature (pp. 122-26). Two 
illustrated articles in National Geo- 
graphic are &quot;Thera, Key to the 
Riddle of Minos&quot; by Spyridon 
Marinatos (May 1972. pp. 702-726) 
and &quot;The Isles of Greece: Aegean 
Birthplace of Western Culture.&quot; by 
Melville Bell Grosvenor (August 
1972, pp. 147-93). The End of At- 
lantis, by J. V. Luce (New York: 
Bantam Books. Inc., 1978), is one 
of the best books available on the 
Santorini volcano and its legends. 
Volcanoes, by Peter Francis (New 
York: Penguin Books, 1976, $4,95), 
is a general paperback book on&apos; the 
subject.

The conservation of river turtles 
is the major concern of Edward O. 
Moll, a herpetologist at Eastern 
Illinois University. Fieldwork has 
taken him to Mexico, Central 
America, and most recently, to 
Malaysia, where he had the support 
of the New York Zoological So- 



ciety, the World Wildlife Fund, and 
the Fauna Preservation Society. 
This summer he expects to help 
Malaysia&apos;s Fisheries Department 
develop management plans for river 
and sea turtles. Moll, who runs in 
10,000-meter to marathon-length 
races, lives in Charleston, Illinois. 




G. Causey Whitlow became in- 
volved in the study of small un- 
gulates during a sabbatical year at 
the University of Malaya. There he 
was able to study the smallest un- 
gulate in the world — the lesser 
mouse deer. A native of Great Brit- 
ain, Whittow is professor of physi- 
ology at the University of Hawaii&apos;s 
School of Medicine and Kewalo 
Marine Laboratory. His current re- 
search deals with the thermal ecol- 
ogy of the Hawaiian monk seal and 
the basking behavior of the green 
sea turtle. Whitlow&apos;s major long- 
term interest is the biology of trop- 
ical sea birds. His last article for 
Natural History. &quot;Night Shift for 
Sloths and Other Sluggards,&quot; ap- 
peared in the January 1977 issue. 



Colin l\irnbull first became in- 
terested in prisons and their in- 
mates when he taught anthropology 
for three years at the Virginia state 
penitentiary. TurnbuU, formerly as- 
sociate curator of African ethnology 
at the American Museum of Natural 
History, is the author of The Moun- 
tain People, The Lonely African, 
and The Forest People, works that 
resulted from his African fieldwork. 
For his article on capital punish- 
ment, he visited prisons in Virginia, 
Georgia, Florida, and California 
and now envisions a future research 
project on rehabilitative educa- 
tional programs in prisons. Born in 
London and educated at Oxford, 
TurnbuU is at present visiting pro- 
fessor of anthropology at George 
Washington University.

AFTER 280 YEARS OF 

DEALING WITH ROYALTY. 

WE&apos;VE LEARNED A LITTLE 

SOMETHING ABOUT TASTE. 

p The shop of Bcrrx; BRothers&amp;Rudd, L^., wine 

merchants, has been a British land- 
mark foR nearly three centuries. For 
years, kings, queens, dukes and 

nobles froM all over the world have 
sought advice or\ the best wines to 

klhe Tasting Room &quot;-^ &apos; xV iV &apos; _ i 1_ 

at Berry bros.^&amp;Rudd, Ltd. scrve Wit K cKe ir sumptuous me als. 
On many occasions. Berry BrolheRS&amp;Rudd, Lt^. 
were asked to suggest a Scotch Whisky of equal Merit. 
Unable to recommend one with wholehearted enthu&quot; 

siasm, they created Cutty Sark Scots Whisky. The first 
Scotch ever made by wine experts to please the most 
demANding of palates. 

The result is a Scotch with a delicate bouquet 
and a quality of smoothness whicH is quite siNgular. 

Of course, you don&apos;t have to be of noble birth 

I to appreciate Cutty Sark Scots Whisky. All that is re- 
quired is noble taste.

&quot;George Edwards was among the 
first to illustrate various Malagasy 
lemurs, including the little-known 
mongoose lemur, which I was inter- 
ested in studying,&quot; writes Sarah 
Blaffer Hrdy. &quot;This led me to 
search for his books. Once I found 
them, I fell prey to their charm. It is 
a dream of mine to see Edwards&apos;s 



work reproduced and once again 
made generally available.&quot; Hrdy, a 
postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Uni- 
versity, is analyzing research gath- 
ered from six seasons of fieldwork 
on Hanuman langurs in India. Her 
most recent book. The Langurs of 
Abu, was published last year by 
Harvard University Press. 




Edmund Carpenter, anthropolo- 
gist, film maker, writer, and teacher, 
is an authority on Indian and Es- 
kimo art and society. Throughout 
his travels, ranging from the Arctic 
and Siberia to New Guinea and 
Micronesia, he has observed the 
importance of secrecy in the sacred 
art and music of many native 
groups. For the past four years. 
Carpenter has been working at the 



Museum fiir Volkerkunde in Basel, 
Switzerland, on a twenty-volume 
publication of the unfinished work 
of the late Carl Schuster, which 
traces contemporary signs, sym- 
bols, and other motifs back to 
paleolithic cultures. The first nine 
volumes will appear next year. Car- 
penter&apos;s &quot;Art of the Northwest

OPERATION DOUBLE 




IN NEW ENGLAND. 



i 



If any one word describes the for- 
ests of New England, it&apos;s one used more 
by poets than foresters: eternal. 

For the surprising fact is, the for- 
ests look much as they did when the first 
Pilgrims landed 350 years ago. 

Then, as now, the trees covered 
virtually all of New England. A varied, 
colorful, and uniquely beautiful forest. 

Today, much of that land is still for- 
ested. In fact, 80 percent of New England 
is commercial forestland.* 

The New England forest endures 
because, unlike coal or oil, trees are a 
renewable resource. And that&apos;s impor- 
tant, not only for the endless variety of 
products we need from the forest — lum- 
ber for houses, pulp, paper, packaging 
and by-products — but for the forest itself. 
A cool, green haven for wildlife in the 
spring. And, in the fall, a dazzling show 
of color that draws thousands of tourists. 

The good news is, the New England 
forest is not just being maintained, it&apos;s 
actually expanding. And that&apos;s where 
Operation Double Tree comes in. 



Operation Double Tree: Why 
it&apos;s needed and how it works. 

While the world demand for 
wood is increasing, the amount of 
productive land available for growing 
trees for harvest is shrinking.

In the U.S. alone, the demand 
for wood and paper products is ex- 
pected to double in less than 50 years. 

Thus the reason behind Opera- 
tion Double Tree — the forest indus- 
try&apos;s name for intensive forest man- 
agement that can double the amount 
of wood from the nation&apos;s productive 
forestland. And do it in such a way 
that everyone can share in the mul- 
tiple benefits of the forest.

Fbrestry Mith Yankee Ingenuity. 

Yankee ingenuity naturally lends it- 
self to the challenge of an idea like Double 
Tree. 

Ted Childs is a good example. One 
hundred years ago his land in Connecticut 
was cut over for charcoal and left to 
waste. But with a great deal of skill, hard 
work and time, Childs has brought the 
forest back. 

Today his Great Mountain Tree 
Farm® is one of the most magnificent 
examples of New England forest. A pan- 
oply of over 100 kinds of trees, covering 
an area about the size of a large city. It&apos;s 
a forest that offers something for every- 
one: a field lab for university students. 
A recreation area for local residents. A 
refuge for wild turkeys. And a source of 
everything from maple syrup to Christ- 
mas trees. 

Sharing The All-purpose Forest. 

The technology that makes a suc- 
cess story like Childs&apos; possible was de- 
veloped by government and industry for- 
esters. Today those foresters are sharing 
their hard-earned knowledge with each 
other, and with the tree farmers. Even 
with people who own just ten acres.

here 92 percent of actual size. Both 
are 16 years old. The difference is, 
the small one grew in a crowded 
thicket, while the large one grew in 
a field just up the road where the 
seedlings were planted to give each 
one plenty of room to grow.

The idea behind Opera-

to grow more trees faster, 
but to use more of every

So there&apos;s progress with Operation 
Double Tree in New Eng- 
land, and in forests 
across the coun- 
try. But we still 
have a lon^

On the average, industry lands grow 
50 percent more wood than the lands 
owned by government and private indi- 
viduals. Yet, even here, there&apos;s room 
for improvement. 

Overall, the American forest is only 
half as productive as it could be. And 
this low productivity is a waste of one of 
our most valuable natural resources. But 
working together, all timber growers — 
private owners, industry and govern- 
ment — can learn to make the most pro-

This View of Life

Were Dinosaurs Dumb? 



Their 100 million years 
of success belies the 
common belief 

When Muhammad Ali flunked his 
army intelligence test, he quipped 
(with a wit that belied his perform- 
ance on the exam): &quot;I only said 
I was the greatest; I never said I 
was the smartest.&quot; In our meta- 
phors and fairy tales, size and 
power are almost always balanced 
by a want of intelligence. Cunning 
is the refuge of the little guy. Think 



of Br&apos;er Rabbit and Br&apos;er Bear; 
David smiting Goliath with a sling- 
shot; Jack chopping down the bean- 
stalk. Slow wit is the tragic flaw of 
a giant. 

The discovery of dinosaurs in the 
nineteenth century provided, or so 
it appeared, a quintessential case 
for the negative correlation of size 
and smarts. With their pea brains 
and giant bodies, dinosaurs became 
a symbol of lumbering stupidity. 
Their extinction seemed only to 
confirm their flawed design. 

Dinosaurs were not even granted 



the usual solace of a giant — great 
physical prowess. God maintained 
a discreet silence about the brains 
of behemoth, but he certainly mar- 
veled at its strength: &quot;Lo, now, his 
strength is in his loins, and his force 
is in the navel of his belly. He 
moveth his tail like a cedar. . . . His 
bones are as strong pieces of brass; 
his bones are like bars of iron [Job 
40:16-18].&quot;&quot; Dinosaurs, on the 
other hand, have usually been re- 
constructed as slow and clumsy. In 
the standard illustration, Bronto- 
saurus wades in a murky pond be-

cause he cannot hold up his own 
weight on land. 

Popularizations for grade school 
curricula provide a good illustration 
of prevailing orthodoxy. 1 happen 
to have my third grade copy (1948 
edition) of Bertha Morris Parker&apos;s 
Animals of Yeslerday. stolen, I am 
forced to suppose, from P.S. 26, 
Queens (sorry Mrs. Mclnerny). In 
it, boy (teleported back to the 
Jurassic) meets brontosaur: 

It is huge, and you can tell from the 
size of its heiid that it must be stu- 
pid. . . . This giant animal moves about 
very slowly as it eats. No wonder it 
moves slowly! Its huge feet are very 
heavy, and its great tail is not easy to 
pull around. You are not surprised that 
the thunder lizard likes to stay in the 
water so that the water will help it hold 
up its huge body. . . . Giant dinosaurs 
were once the lords of the earth. Why 
did they disappear? You can probably 
guess part of the answer — their bodies 
were too large for their brains. If their 
bodies had been smaller, and their 
brains larger, they might have lived on. 

Dinosaurs have been making a 
strong comeback of late, in this age 
of &quot;I&apos;m OK. you&apos;re OK.&quot; Most 
paleontologists are now willing to 
view them as energetic, active, and 
capable animals. The Brontosaurus 
that wallowed in its pond a genera- 
tion ago is now running on land, 
while pairs of males have been seen 
twining their necks about each 
other in elaborate sexual combat 
for access to females (much like the 
neck wrestling of giraffes). Modern 
anatomical reconstructions indicate 



strength and agility, and many 
paleontologists now believe that 
dinosaurs were warmblooded. 

The idea of warmblooded dino- 
saurs has captured the public imagi- 
nation and received a torrent of 
press coverage. Yet another vindi- 
cation of dinosaurian capability has 
received very little attention, al- 
though I regard it as equally signifi- 
cant. I refer to the issue of stupid- 
ity and its correlation with size. The 
revisionist interpretation, which I 
support in this column, does not 
enshrine dinosaurs as paragons of 
intellect, but it does maintain that 
they were not small brained after 
all. They had the &quot;right-sized&quot; 
brains for reptiles of their body 
size. 

I don&apos;t wish to deny that the flat- 
tened, minuscule head of large- 
bodied Stegosaurus houses little 
brain from our subjective, top- 
heavy perspective, but I do wish to 
assert that we should not expect 
more of the beast. First of all (as I 
wrote in an early column, January 
1975), large animals have relatively 
smaller brains than related, small 
animals. The correlation of brain 
size with body size among kindred 
animals (all reptiles, all mammals, 
for example) is remarkably regular. 
As we move from small to large ani- 
mals, from mice to elephants or small 
lizards to Komodo dragons, brain 
size increases, but not as fast as 
body size. In other words, bodies 
grow faster than brains, and large 
animals have low ratios of brain 
weight to body weight. In fact.

brains grow only about two-thirds 
as fast as bodies. Since we have no 
reason to believe that large animals 
are consistently stupider than their 
smaller relatives, we conclude that 
large animals require relatively less 
brain to do as well as smaller ones. 
If we do not recognize this relation- 
ship, we are likely to underestimate 
the mental power of very large ani- 
mals, dinosaurs in particular. 

Second, the relationship between 
brain and body size is not identical 
in all groups of vertebrates. All 
share the same rate of relative de- 
crease in brain size, but small mam- 
mals have much larger brains than 
small reptiles of the same body 
weight. This discrepancy is main- 
tained at all larger body weights. 
■ Put these two facts together — all 
large animals have relatively small 
brains, and reptiles have much 
smaller brains than mammals at 
any common body weight — and 
what should we expect from a nor- 
mal, large reptile? The answer, of 
course, is a brain of very modest 
size. No living reptile even ap- 
proaches a middle-sized dinosaur 
in bulk, so we have no modern 
standard to serve as a model for 
dinosaurs. 

Fortunately, our imperfect fossil 
record has for once not severely 
disappointed us in providing data 
on fossil brains. Superbly pre- 
served skulls have been found for 
many species of dinosaurs, and 
cranial capacities can be measured. 
(Since brains do not fill craniums 
in reptiles, some creative, although 
not unreasonable, manipulation 
must be applied to estimate brain 
size from the hole within a skull.) 
With these data, we have an easy 
test for the conventional hypothesis 
of dinosaurian stupidity. We should 
agree, at the outset, that a reptilian 
standard is the only proper one — it 
is surely irrelevant that dinosaurs 
had smaller brains than people or 
whales. We have abundant data on 
the relationship of brain and body 
size in modern reptiles. Since we 
know that brains increase two- 
thirds as fast as bodies as we move 
from small to large living species, 
we can extrapolate this rate to di- 
nosaurian sizes and ask whether 
dinosaur brains match what we 
would expect of living reptiles if 
they grew so large. 

Harry Jerison (Evolution of the 
Brain and Intelligence, Academic 
Press, 1973) studied the brain sizes 



often dinosaurs and found that they 
fell right on the extrapolated rep- 
tilian curve. Dinosaurs did not have 
small brains; they had just the 
right-sized brains for reptiles of 
their dimensions. So much for Ms. 
Parker&apos;s explanation of their de- 
mise. 

Jerison made no attempt to dis- 
tinguish among various kinds of 
dinosaurs; ten species distributed 
over six major groups scarcely pro- 
vide a proper basis for comparison. 
Recently, James A. Hopson of the 
University of Chicago gathered 
more data and made a remarkable 
and satisfying discovery (Annual 
Review of Ecology and Sys- 
tematics. vol. 8, 1977). 

Hopson needed a common scale 
for all dinosaurs. He compared 
each dinosaur brain with the aver- 
age reptilian brain we would expect 
at its body weight. If the dinosaur 
falls on the standard reptilian curve, 
its brain receives a value of 1.0 
(called an encephalization quotient, 
or EQ — the ratio of actual brain to 
expected brain for a standard rep- 
tile of the same body weight). Dino- 
saurs lying above the curve (more 
brain than expected in a standard 
reptile of the same body weight) 
receive values above 1.0, while 
those below the curve measure less 
than 1.0. 

Hopson found that the major 
groups of dinosaurs can be ranked 
by increasing values of average 
EQ. This ranking corresponds per- 
fectly to inferred speed and agility 
in locomotion, which, in turn, re- 
flect behavioral complexity in feed- 
ing (or avoiding the prospect of be- 
coming a meal oneself). The giant 
sauropods, Brontosaurus and its 
allies, have the lowest EQ&apos;s — 0.20 
to 0.35. Presumably, they moved 
fairly slowly and without great ma- 
neuverability. They escaped preda- 
tion by virtue of their bulk alone, 
much as elephants do today. The 
armored ankylosaurs and stego- 
saurs come next with EQ&apos;s of 0.52 
to 0.56. These animals probably en- 
gaged in mostly passive defense, 
relying upon heavy armor. But the 
clubbed tail of ankylosaurs and the 
spiked tail of stegosaurs indicate 
some active fighting and increased 
behavioral complexity. 

The ceratopsians are next at 
about 0.7 to 0.9. Hopson remarks: 
&quot;The larger ceratopsians, with their 
great horned heads, relied on active 
defensive strategies and presum- 



ably required somewhat greater 
agility than the tail-weaponed 
forms, both in fending off predators 
and in intraspecific combat bouts. 
The smaller ceratopsians, lacking 
true horns, would have relied on 
sensory acuity and speed to escape 
from predators.&quot; The ornithopods 
(duckbills and their allies) rank as 
the brainiest herbivores, with EQ&apos;s 
from 0.85 to 1.5. They relied upon 
&quot;acute senses and relatively fast 
speeds&quot; to elude carnivores. Flight 
seems to require more acuity and 
agility than standing defense. In- 
deed, among ceratopsians, the 
small, hornless, and presumably 
fleeing Protoceratops has a higher 
EQ than the great three-horned 
Trice ratops. 

Carnivores have higher EQ&apos;s 
than herbivores, as in modern ver- 
tebrates. Catching a rapidly moving 
or stoutly fighting prey demands a 
good deal more upstairs than pluck- 
ing the right kind of plant. The 
giant theropods (Tyrannosaurus 
and its allies) vary from 1.0 to 
nearly 2.0. Atop the heap, quite ap- 
propriately at its small size, rests 
the little coelurosaur Stenonycho- 
saurus with an EQ well above 5.0. 
Its actively moving quarry, small 
mammals and birds perhaps, must 
have posed a greater challenge in 
discovery and capture than Tricera- 
tops afforded Tyrannosaurus. 

I would never want to make a 
gross claim that brain size equals 
intelligence or, in this case, behav- 
ioral range and agility (I don&apos;t know 
what intelligence means in humans, 
much less in a group of extinct 
reptiles). We know that variation in 
brain size within a species has pre- 
cious little to do with brain power 
(humans do equally well with 900 
or 2,500 cubic centimeters of brain). 
But comparison across species, 
when the differences are large, 
seems reasonable. I do not regard 
it as irrelevant to our achievements 
that we so greatly exceed koala 
bears — much as I love them — in 
EQ. This sensible ordering among 
dinosaurs also indicates that even 
so coarse a measure as brain size 
counts for something. 

If behavioral complexity is one 
consequence of mental power, then 
we might expect to uncover among 
dinosaurs some signs of social be- 
havior that demand coordination, 
cohesiveness. and recognition. In- 
deed we do, and it cannot be acci-

for people who read and 
read a lot called QPB. It 
features great books by 
great writers in full-size, 
quality softcover editions 
The saving: up to 65% over

by its cover, why pay for 
the cover? 



QPB has a very simple 
philosophy. 

It&apos;s a book club for people 
who love to read and collect 
important works of fiction 
and nonfiction, but are 
stunned by current book- 
store prices.

CEED 

&quot;\ USED TO DESIGN 
RACING CARS BUT THE 

AUDI 5000 W\S 
A BIGGER challenge: 

AN INTERVIEW WITH FERDINAND PIECH, AUDI 5000 PROIECT DIRECTOR 




Sir, how long 
did you design 
racing cars? 



And you say 
designing 
a passenger car 
was more of 
a challenge? 



Piech: Ten years in all. I brought six 
cars from the drawing board to the 
race track and all six went on to win 
world championships, it was all very exciting. 

Piech: It was for me. A racing car can 
be designed to last for a few races 
only. But a passenger car obviously 
has to be designed to do much more 
and to last much longer In addition 
to excellent performance and handling I had to con- 
sider things like room, comfort and price. 

What about Piech: 1 was determined from the be- 

the price? ginningtoprovethatalargeGerman 

luxury sedan could be produced for under 59,000.&apos;&apos; 

Piech: No. I don&apos;t think so. It was a 
question of eliminating unnecessary 
things. The greatest example of that 
is our five-cylinder engine. Five cyl- 
inders, because a four was too small 

for the weight of the car, and a six was too extreme. 

Designing the perfect engine for the vehicle can hardly 

be called making a compromise. 

Your racing back- Piech: Yes, yes. Very much so. The 
ground? Did it ^gy (hg ^udi 5000 handles, for in 

come in handy? 



Well, you 
succeeded with 
price, but did that 
mean you had to 
compromise a lot? 



Is it possible to 
build a car with a 
soft, mushy ride, 
and still retain 
great responsive 
handling? 



Stance. The ride is not in the least bit 
mushy. Our suspension, our rack-and-pinion steering 

&apos;■&apos;Suggested 1978 retail price under $9,000 PO.E,, transp , local taxes, and dealer delivery charges, additional. Come test-drive the Audi 5000 at your local Porsche -I- Audi dealer 



and our weight distribution have a lot to do with that. 
Which is why we suggest that people pick a rainy or 
snowy day to take a test drive. This car is at its best 
when the weather is at its worst. 

Piech : No, not at all. They are exactly 
opposite. Some people feel that a soft, 
mushy ride is luxurious. We, the en- 
gineers at Audi, do not. We think it&apos;s 
tiring because you seem to be cor- 
recting the car&apos;s handling so often. We believe that a 
truly luxurious car is one that does what you want it to 
do when you want it to do it. That&apos;s why we engineered 
the Audi 5000 to be so precise and responsive. 

Piech: Like everything else, there are 
good things and bad things. The 
good things we tried to incorporate 
in the Audi 5000. More comfort. More room. To be 
quiet. To give it cruise control as standard equipment. 
And you can order a powerful, American type air con- 
ditioning system for your places like Florida. 

Piech: 1 would say they can now buy 
a European car that was designed 
with American needs in mind. What 
we have tried to build is the one car 
that&apos;s the best of both worlds. I hope 
that doesn&apos;t sound, ah, what do you say . . . corny? 



What do you 
think of 
American cars? 



Quickly, what 
would you say 
to convince 
Americans to buy 
an Audi 5000?

Archaeopteryx 

dental that these signs were over- 
looked when dinosaurs labored 
under the burden of a falsely im- 
posed obtuseness. Multiple track- 
ways have been uncovered, with 
evidence of more than twenty ani- 
mals traveling together in parallel 
movement. Did some dinosaurs live 
in herds? Particularly intriguing is 
the Davenport Ranch sauropod 
trackway where small footprints lie 
in the center and larger ones at the 
periphery. Could it be that some 
dinosaurs traveled much as some 
advanced herbivorous mammals, 
with large adults at the borders 
sheltering juveniles in the center? 

In addition, the very structures 
that seemed most bizarre and use- 
less to older paleontologists — the 
elaborate crests of hadrosaurs, 
the frills and horns of ceratopsians, 
and the nine inches of solid bone 
above the brain of Pachy- 
cephalosaurus — now appear to 
gain a coordinated explanation as 
devices for sexual display and com- 
bat. Pachycephalosaurs may have 
engaged in head-butting contests 
much as mountain sheep do today. 
The crests of some hadrosaurs are 
well designed as resonating cham- 
bers; did they engage in bellowing 
matches? The ceratopsian horn and 
frill may have acted as sword and 
shield in the battle for mates. Both 
for its intrinsic complexity and for 
the elaborate social system that 
such behavior implies, we would 
scarcely anticipate finding it in a 
group of animals barely muddling 
through at a moronic level. 

But the best illustration of dino- 



saurian capability may well be the 
fact most often cited against them, 
namely their demise. Extinction, 
for most people, carries many of 
the connotations attributed to sex 
not so long ago — a rather disrep- 
utable business, frequent in occur- 
rence but not to anyone&apos;s credit and 
certainly not to be discussed in 
proper circles. But, like sex, extinc- 
tion is an ineluctable part of life. It 
is the ultimate fate of all species, 
not the lot of the unfortunate and 
ill-designed. It is no sign of failure. 

The remarkable thing about dino- 
saurs is not that they became ex- 
tinct, but that they dominated the 
earth for so long. Dinosaurs held 
sway for 100 million years while 
mammals, all the while, lived as 
small animals in the interstices of 
their world. After 70 million years 
on top, we mammals have an excel- 
lent track record and good pros- 
pects for the future, but we have 
yet to display the staying power of 
dinosaurs. 

People, on this criterion, are 
scarcely worth mentioning — 5 mil- 
lion years perhaps since Australo- 
pithecus, a mere 50,000 for our own 
species. Homo sapiens. Try the 
ultimate test within our system of 
values: Do you know anyone who 
would wager a substantial sum, 
even at favorable odds, on the prop- 
osition that Homo sapiens will last 
longer than Brontosaurusl

^This is the set where they shot Wello, Dolly!&apos; 
What you can&apos;t see is us pumping oil behind it.&quot; 



&quot;One of the strangest 
places I ever produced 
oil,&quot; says Gulf Production 
Superintendent Eddie 
Culbertson, &quot;was right 
here in Los Angeles in 
the back lot of the 20th 
Century-Fox studio. 




&quot;We showed them how they could 
have their oil and their movies.&quot; 

&quot;They found a big oil 
field right under a perma&apos; 
nent set being used for 
shooting the movie 
&apos;Hello, Dolly!&apos; in 1969. 

The indirect 
approacli 

&quot;How do you get at the 
oil without disturbing 



the set, the streets, or 
the buildings? With a 
technique called 
directional drilling. The 
oil is under the city as far 
away as one mile from 
the surface location of 
the drill sites, which are 
hidden by the scenery. 
&quot;Directional drilling 
has other advantages. 
You can drill 20 or 30 
wells from one drill site 
instead of filling the land- 
scape with oil derricks. 
Or you can drill for some 




offshore oil without 
putting the drilling rig 
right in the water. 

Keep America 
beautiful 

&quot;Sometimes it&apos;s a real 
challenge getting the oil 
without spoiling the 
landscape. Directional 
drilling is one way to do 
it. There are many more. 

&quot;Getting the oil out 
and preserving the envi- 
ronment is a challenge, 
but I&apos;d say we were 
meeting it very well.&quot;

ness of heart toward tapeworms. 
But when the World Health Organi- 
zation (WHO) calls, all parasites 
are equals regardless of race or 
region. And so I found myself in the 
central highlands of Irian Jaya, In- 
donesian New Guinea, the WHO 
consultant sent to advise on the 
control of a pig-transmitted tape- 
worm that was sending the Ekari of 
Enarotali into epileptic convul- 
sions. Once again I was about to 
learn that in problems of public 
health, expert but alien reason is 
usually not reasonable to the peo- 
ples of another culture. 

To the peoples of New Guinea 
the pig is more than pork. Through- 
out the large island, man and pig 
have a relationship that is intimate 
beyond domesticity. The pig is a 
quasi-family member, a source of 
food, and ultimately a gift to pro- 
pitiate the spirit world. The great, 
gory festivals during which great 
numbers of pigs are consumed are 
held to gain prestige, to pay oflF ob- 
ligations, or to celebrate a success- 
ful battle. 

At other times the pig is in con- 
stant demand for ritual slaughter. 
One or more must be killed at the 
birth of a child or in any unfortunate 
circumstance or other perceived 
emergency requiring sacrifice to 
gods and ancestor spirits. Ritual 
slaughter represents something 
more than paying the premium for 
the insurance of spiritual good will; 



22 



it reflects the absolute belief that 
life and sanity require harmony 
with the spirit world. Pig sacrifice is 
a major means of attaining that har- 
mony. Thus, the introduction of the 
pig tapeworm. Taenia solium, into 
New Guinea was both a medical and 
cultural disaster. 

Pig and man share not only more 
habits than we like to admit but also 
two helminth parasites, the nema- 
tode Trichinella spiralis, the cause 
of trichinosis, and the tapeworm 
Taenia solium. Trichinosis, once a 
common infection in the United 
States, can be an unpleasant, even 
fatal, disease but the tapeworm is 
the villain of this piece. 

Tapeworms belong to the class 
Cestoidea, gutless flatworms that 
absorb nutriment directly through 
the integument. In a sense a tape- 
worm is a communal chain of indi- 
viduals that keep in touch by means 
of common lateral nerve cords. 
Each mature segment in the chain 
comes complete with male and 
female sexual organs and an excre- 
tory pore to dispose of metabolic 
wastes. 

The &quot;head&quot; of the tapeworm, a 
segment referred to as a scolex, has 
specialized structures, or suckers, 
augmented in some species with 
hooks, to anchor the worm to the 
host&apos;s intestinal wall. The scolex is 
also the germinal center from which 
all other segments of the tape arise. 
Near the scolex the segments are 
sexually immature; in the middle of 
the chain they are sexually func- 
tional; and at the terminal portion, 
gravid — mere sacs of eggs. The 
gravid segments separate and either 



disrupt and release their eggs inside 
the bowel or are passed whole with 
the feces. 

To develop completely, tape- 
worms require one or more inter- 
mediate hosts . When a pig swallows 
the egg of a Taenia tapeworm, the 
egg hatches within the pig&apos;s intes- 
tine but the worm does not develop 
to the adult &quot;tape.&quot; Instead, the 
microscopic embryo penetrates the 
intestinal wall and enters a small 
vein. Circulating blood carries the 
embryo to various parts of the pig 
where it will develop into a cysti- 
cercus, a bladderlike form with an 
invaginated structure that will 
eventually become the scolex. The 
tapeworm develops no further until 
a human ingests pork containing the 
cysticercus. Now safe in its final 
home, the scolex pops out, attaches 
to the human intestinal wall, and 
the worm begins to grow to its full 
complement of segments. 

Most adult tapeworms have a 
strict host-specific relationship; 
only man can serve as definitive 
host (the host for the sexually ma- 
ture stage) of Taenia solium and its 
close relative Taenia saginata. 
Taenia solium is known as the 
pig tapeworm and Taenia saginata 
as the beef tapeworm because the 
cysticerci are found in those ani- 
mals. 

Transmission of the disease oc- 
curs when infected humans defe- 
cate where cows or pigs feed. The 
animals ingest the eggs, which de- 
velop into cysticerci; and the cycle 
is completed when humans eat un- 
dercooked pork or a tasty steak tar- 
tare. One highly important diflfer-

ence between the pig tapeworm and 
the beef tapeworm is that humans 
can also act as intermediate hosts 
for the pig tapeworm. If a person 
swallows an egg of the beef tape- 
worm, the worm embryo would die 
in that unsuitable host. But when a 
human ingests an egg of the pig 
tapeworm, the bladder stage of the 
parasite can develop into a disease 
known as cysticercosis. 

While the harboring of a twenty- 
foot tapeworm may not be a pleas- 
ure (except perhaps that you could 
refer to yourself in the imperial 
style as &quot;We&quot;), most infections 
cause little discomfort. Those har- 
boring a tapeworm are often un- 
aware of the beast within, unless 
they notice segments in their stools. 

It is not worms, but the cysticer- 
cus that can be devastatingly patho- 
genic. After hatching from the egg 
and entering the blood system, the 
embryo frequently flows to the 
brain where it grows into the 
bladder form. In time, an inflam- 
matory reaction can lead to such 
neurological disorders as epileptic- 
like convulsions and bizarre per- 
sonality changes mimicking 
psychosis. These pathogenic mani- 
festations often do not appear until 
two to five years after a person has 
contracted the infection. The condi- 
tion is like a time bomb inexorably 
ticking away in the brain. 

In 1971, two physicians at the 
small Enarotali general hospital 
reported a bewildering &quot;epidemic&quot; 
of severe burn cases among the 
Ekari. Some of the twenty-five to 
thirty cases each month were so 
bad that limbs had to be amputated. 
All patients gave similar accounts. 
While sleeping, they had been over- 
come by an epileptic seizure and 
had fallen unconscious into the 
household fire. 

Enarotali is piercingly cold at 
night. The village sits on the shore 
of one of the Paniai (Wissel) lakes 
at an altitude of 5,000 feet, sur- 
rounded by the wild barricade of 
the east-central mountain range. 
Hardly overdressed for this cli- 
mate, the local Ekari men wear only 
a long gourd penis sheath and the 
women a brief string girdle. To 
ward ofl&quot; the night chill, they build 
a fire in the center of rude thatch 
huts and sleep on bunks around the 
fire. 

The hospital staff had treated 
burn accidents before 1971 but 
never on this scale. The frequency 



of epileptiform attacks was also 
new, giving rise to the suspicion 
that some new infectious agent had 
been introduced. 

The pathogen came to light dur- 
ing a survey for intestinal parasites 
by a team of scientists from the 
Department of Parasitology of the 
University of Indonesia School of 
Medicine in Jakarta. Along with the 
usual intestinal zoo, they were as- 
tonished to find that 8 percent of the 
fecal samples were positive for the 
eggs of the tapeworm Taenia. Al- 
though many parasitological sur- 
veys had been carried out in New 
Guinea for many years, this finding 
was the first instance of taeniasis. 
Moreover, the technique of micro- 
scopic examination of fecal speci- 
mens has a low diagnostic sensi- 
tivity for this parasite. Undoubt- 
edly, many more cases existed. For 
example, in one African study 6 
percent of the stools showed tae- 
niasis, while autopsy examinations 
indicated that more than 60 percent 
of the population had the tape- 
worm. 

Subsequent clinical examinations 
of the Ekari revealed cysts under 
the skin, a sign of heavy, dissemi- 
nated cysticercosis, and the dis- 
covery of the deadly, pearly glob- 
ules of the cysticerci studded in the 
brain of a patient who had died of 
the disease confirmed the cause of 
the neurological syndrome. Sero- 
logical tests recently performed by 
my Indonesian colleagues and me 
indicate that, at present, at least 25 
percent of the Ekari adults and 
children have cysticercosis. 

But where did the parasite come 
from? How was it introduced into 
such a remote, isolated area? Re- 
construction of historical events 
indicates that the tapeworm came 
unseen, riding the anticolonial 
wave; the vehicles of transport 
were men and pigs. 

In 1969 the United Nations di- 
rected the peoples of West New 
Guinea to choose whether to join 
the Republic of Indonesia. The 
Ekari were uncertain, to say the 
least, about the change in regime, 
and during the plebiscite, or shortly 
thereafter, the Indonesians sent 
troops to Enarotali to help the vote 
along. Some of the soldiers came 
from Bali. Indonesia&apos;s President 
Suharto softened the military action 
by sending a gift of pigs. The pigs 
came from Bali, since pig rearing in 
mostly Muslim Indonesia is largely 



concentrated on the Hindu island. 
Whatever the political and social 
advantages of the gift, the medical 
results were an unforeseen tragedy. 
The pig tapeworm has been en- 
demic in Bali for at least 60 years. 
A favorite Balinese dish is an un- 
dercooked pork preparation in 
which the cysticerci are cleverly 
disguised by the legendary spices of 
the Indies. However, the Balinese 
are fastidiously clean in their per- 
sonal habits and so while the tape- 
worm infection is prevalent, cysti- 
cercosis is almost nonexistent. In 
contrast, the Ekari have Stone Age 
toilet habits and when the tape- 
worm came from Bali, they became 
infected via meat and human feces. 

Transcultural tapeworm traflfic 
hasn&apos;t been confined to Bali-New 
Guinea and I should like to digress 
for a moment to recount a some- 
what similar occurrence much 
closer to home. Now that it is epi- 
demiological history, the story is 
rather amusing. It might be entitled 
&quot;A Tapeworm Tale of Two Cities,&quot; 
with a cast of characters that in- 
cludes the fish tapeworm, Scandi- 
navian fishermen, and Jewish 
grandmothers of New York City. 

The fish tapeworm is big, up to 
forty-five feet in length, and its 
name, Diphyllobothrium latum, fits 
its size. The historical endemic fo- 
cus of D. latum is Scandinavia, 
where the infected fishermen defe- 
cate in the lakes. The first interme- 
diate host, a copepod, eats the eggs. 
A freshwater fish, the second inter- 
mediate host, eats the copepod. A 
wormlike larva devejops in the 
muscles of the fish, and humans be- 
come infected by eating a Nordic 
version of sashimi. 

When Scandinavian fishermen 
came to the United States during 
the nineteenth-century wave of 
immigration, many settled in the 
lake region of Minnesota and Wis- 
consin where they began to ply 
their trade (and habits). Shortly 
thereafter the fish in these lakes 
became infected. 

Commerce in live fish took place 
regularly between the Midwest and 
New York City at least until the late 
1930s. I recall that during my boy- 
hood in New York almost every 
market had a large holding tank full 
of live pike, pickerel, and carp. The 
chief customers were Jewish house- 
wives who magically transformed 
the fish into an ethnically ambro- 
sial concoction called gefilte fish.

Basically, gefiite fish is an amal- 
gam of minced fish, pressed into 
balls, and boiled until done. &quot;Until 
done&quot; is the tricky part. The grand- 
mothers of that time, to whom the 
thermometer was considered high 
technology, would sample the fish 
until it was cooked just right. The 
early samples were still quite raw 
and if infected, contained a viable 
larval worm. In this way, several of 
the nice old ladies of Gotham un- 
wittingly acquired a forty-foot Scan- 
dinavian immigrant in their diges- 
tive tracts. The introduction offish 
inspection, sanitary practices, and 
thermometers, along with the grad- 
ual demise of the traditional Jewish 
grandmother&apos;s instinctive culinary 
arts have made D. latum infections 
rare in the United States. 

But to return from New York to 
highland New Guinea. By 1973 the 
main epidemiological factors gov- 
erning the transmission of tape- 
worm disease were known, but the 
problem of control remained. In 
technically advanced countries, re- 
frigerating the pork for the proper 
length of time kills the cysticerci. 
Although this is impossible in primi- 
tive Enarotali, an elfective method 
would be to cook the carcass thor- 
oughly. Unfortunately, the tradi- 
tional Ekari barbecue doesn&apos;t allow 
for this. The Ekari throw the dead 
pig on the fire just long enough to 
warm it up. One reason for this 
hasty cooking is that, except for the 
big feasts, when an Ekari knobbles 
a pig, he wants it to be all his. 
Neighbors are not customarily in- 
vited for dinner. The Ekari kills his 
pig secretly — or as secretly as a pig 
can be butchered — in the dead of 
night, following the kill with a quick 
turn on the fire. A fast-food meal 
takes place in stealth and gloom. 
(This and other traits have not en- 
deared the Ekari to anthropologists 
who have described them as greedy, 
avaricious, and &quot;primitive capital- 
ists.&quot;) 

The affliction of cysticercosis 
would seem a compelling enough 
reason for a change in cooking prac- 
tice. With incontestable logic, the 
health educator from Jakarta, a 
dedicated woman trained at one of 
America&apos;s more prestigious schools 
of public health, tried to teach the 
new methods with all the zeal of a 
Cordon Bleu instructor. So there 
we were, the educator educating, 
the doctor expounding on the vir- 
tues of sanitation, and the Ekari 



26 



nodding in pleasant agreement. 
After all, under the circumstances, 
who in his right mind could reject 
this appeal to common sense? Then 
one night it all fell apart and the 
cultural gap yawned into an abys- 
mal chasm. 

I was sitting by the fire drinking 
wine with the village elders. 
Through the translator, the chief 
expressed his bitterness that the 
disease introduced by foreigners 
had corrupted the tribe&apos;s pigs and 
religion. Then came the real 
shocker for me when he said: &quot;We 
are not blind. We can see the seeds 
that give us the illness in the pig 
flesh. But no one lives forever and 
if we must die, then we must die. 
Life is no longer of pleasure. We 
are only half men. The Indonesians 
will not let us make the warfare that 
gave us manhood. I no longer care 
if I eat the corrupt pig flesh. 

&quot;Even if this were not so, we 
still could not do as you say. You 
tell us not to eat the infected pig, 
to be careful, to cook it long. How 
can we do this? If a child is born at 
night we must sacrifice a pig im- 
mediately, there is no time to look 
and see if it has the seeds. The pig 
must be killed and eaten at once. 

&quot;When the missionaries brought 
us the coughing sickness many 
years ago [a pertussis epidemic in 
1956], we rose in anger. This time 
we have no heart to do so.&quot; 

After he concluded, the wine was 
passed around again. I couldn&apos;t re- 
member ever feeling so lonely and 
helpless. 

After I left Enarotali I flew to 
Jayapura, the provincial capital, to 
discuss the situation with the gover- 
nor. He was highly sympathetic 
and concerned, particularly since 
we had clear evidence that the in- 
fection had now spread to many 
parts of Irian Jaya. After going over 
the possible remedies and the diffi- 
culty in implementing them, he re- 
marked, as I was about to leave the 
governor&apos;s mansion, &quot;You know 
they are not like you and me. They 
are very primitive and it is ex- 
tremely difficult to change their cus- 
toms even for their better health.&quot; 
I was about to agree when I noticed 
that we were both smoking ciga- 
rettes.

ONE OF THESE CAMERAS WAS MADE 

JUST FOR YOU. 
HERE&apos;S HOW TO TELL WHICH ONE. 



If you&apos;ve considered buying a 35mm sin- 
gle lens reflex camera, you may have 
wondered how to find the right one out 
of the bewildering array of models and 
features available. 

And you have good reason to wonder, 
since the camera you choose will have a 
lot to do with how creative and reward- 
ing your photography will be. 

Of course, what you pay for your 
camera is important. But it shouldn&apos;t be 
your only consideration, especially since 
there are very expensive cameras 




and shoot simplicity. The difference is in 
the kind of creative control you get. 

For landscapes, still lifes, portraits and 
the like, you&apos;ll want an afierture-prioricy 
camera. It lets you set the lens opening, 
while it sets the shutter speed automati- 
cally. 

This way, you control depth-of-field. 
TTiat&apos;s the area of sharpness in front of 
and behind your subject. Many profes- 
sional photographers believe that depth- 
of-field is the single most important 



the lens opening automatically. 

Minolta makes both types of auto- 
matic camera. The Minolta XG-7 is 
moderately priced and offers aperture- 
priority automation, plus fully manual 
control. The Minolta XD-1 1 is some- 
what more expensive, but it&apos;s the 
world&apos;s only 35mm SLR with both aper- 
ture and shutter-priority automation, 
plus full manual. The XD-11 is so 
advanced that during shutter-priority 
operation it will actually make exposure 



n(« 



Minolta makes all kinds of 35nini SLR&apos;s, 

so our main concern is that you get 

exactly the right camera for your needs. 

Whether that means the Minolta XD-1 1, 

the most advanced camera in the world. 

Or the easy-to-use and moderately priced Minolta XG-7. Or the very economical 

Minolta SR-T cameras. 




that won&apos;t give you some of the 
features you really need. So before 
you think about price, ask yourself how 
you&apos;ll be using the camera and what 
kind of pictures you&apos;ll be taking. Your 
answers could save a lot of money. 
How automatic 
should your camera be? 
Basically, there are two kinds of auto- 
matic 35mm SLR&apos;s. Both make use of 
advanced electronics to give you per- 
fectly exposed pictures with point, focu 



factor in creative photography. 

At times you may want to control the 
motion of your subject for creative 
effect. You can do this with an aperture- 
priority camera by changing the lens 
opening until the camera sets the shutter 
speed necessary to freeze or blur a mo\&apos;- 
ing subject. Or you can use a shutter- 
(rriority camera, on which you set the 
shutter speed first and the camera sets 




corrections that you fail to make. 
Do you really need an 
automatic camera? 

Without a doubt, automation makes 
fine photography easier. But if you&apos;re 
willing to do some of the work yourself, 
you can save a lot of money and get pic- 
tures that are every bit as good. 

In this case, you might consider a 
Minolta SR-T These are semi-automatic 
cameras. They have built-in, through- 
the-lens metering systems that tell you 
exactly how to set the lens and 
shutter for perfect exposure. 
You just align two indicators in 
the viewfinder. 

What should you expect 

when you look into 
the camera&apos;s viewfinder?

you can save some money. 



your subject. Not just in the center, but 
even along the edges and in the comers. 
All Minolta SLR&apos;s have extraordinarily 
bright finders, so that composing and 
focusing are effortless, even in dim light. 
And with a Minolta there&apos;s never a 
question about focusing. You&apos;ll find 
focusing aids in every Minolta view- 
finder that make it 
easy to take criti- 
cally sharp pictures. 

Information is 
another thing you 
can expect to find 
in a well-designed 
viewfinder. Minolta 
believes that you 
should never have 
to look away from 
the finder in order 
to make camera 
adjustments. So 
everything you need 
to know for a perfect picture is right 
there in a Minolta finder. 

In the Minolta XD-11 and XG-7, 
red light.emitting diodes tell you 
what lens opening or shutter speed is 
being set automatically and warn against 
under or over-exposure. In Minolta 
SR-T cameras, there are two pointers 
which come together as you adjust the 
lens and shutter for correct exposure. 
Do you need an auto winder? 
If you like the idea of sequence photog- 
raphy, or simply want the luxury of 
power assisted film advancing, an auto 
viander may be for you. Minolta auto 
winders will advance one picture at a 
time, or continuously at about two pic- 
tures per second. And they give you 
advantages not found in others, like up 
to 50% more pictures with a set of bat- 
teries and easy attachment to the camera 
without removing any caps. Optional 
auto winders are available for both the 
Minolta XD-11 and XG-7, but not for 
Minolta SR-T cameras. 

How about electronic flash? 
An automatic electronic flash can be 
combined with any Minolta SLR for 
easy, just about foolproof indoor pho- 
tography without the bother of flash- 
bulbs. For the XD-11 and XG-7, 
Minolta makes the Auto Electroflash 
200X. It sets itself automatically for cor- 
rect flash exposure, and it sets the cam- 
era automatically for use with flash. An 
LED in the viewfinder tells when the 
200X is ready to fire. Most unusual: the 
Auto Electroflash 200X can 
fire continuously in perfect 
synchronization with Minolta / \ y 
auto winders. Imagine hcinK / » ^ 

able to tikt d &apos;^e^uer^ce of 36 / |\ \ I 



flash pictures without ever taking your 
finger off the button. 

\fou should be comfortable 
with your camera. 

The way a camera feels in your hands 
and responds to your commands can 
make a big difference in the way you 
take pictures. 




The electronic viewfinder: light emitting 
diodes tell you what the camera is 
doing automatically to give you correct 
exposure. 



The Minolta XD-11 and XG-7, for 
instance, are compact, but not cramped. 
Lightweight, but with a solid feeling of 
quality. Controls are oversized and posi- 
tioned so that your fingers fall naturally 
into place. And the electronically con- 
trolled shutters in these advanced auto- 
matic cameras are incredibly smooth 
and quiet. 

Minolta SR-T&apos;s give you the heft and 
weight of a slightly larger camera, but 
with no sacrifice in handling conve- 
nience. As in all Minolta SLR&apos;s, &quot;human 
engineering&quot; insures smooth, effortless 
operation. 

Are extra features important? 
If you&apos;re going to use them, there are 
a lot of extras that can make your 
photography more creative &apos; 

and convenient. 
Depending on the 
Minolta model you 
choose, you can 
select from a num- 
ber of special fea- 
tures. For instance, 
some models let you 
take multiple expo- 
sures with pushbutton ease 
(even with an auto winder). 
Other available extras include a 
window to show that film is 
advancing properly, a handy 
memo holder that holds the end 
of a film box to remind you of 
what film you&apos;re using, and a self-timer 
that delays the release of the shutter 



so you can get into your own pictures. 

What about the lens system? 
Just about every 35mm SLR has a lens 
&quot;system.&quot; But it&apos;s important to know 
what the system contains. It should be 
big enough to satisfy your needs, not 
only today, but five years from today. 

TTiere are almost 40 
interchangeable 
lenses available for 
Minolta SLR&apos;s, 
ranging from 
7.5mm fisheye to 
1600mm super-tele- 
photo, including 
macro and zoom 
lenses and the 
smallest 500mm 
lens in the world. 
And since inter- 
changeable lenses 
should be easy to 
change, the 
patented Minolta bayonet mount lets 
you remove or attach them with less 
than a quarter turn. 

What&apos;s next? 
After you&apos;ve thought about how you&apos;ll 
be using your camera, ask your photo 
dealer to let you try a Minolta. Handle 
the camera for yourself Examine its fea- 
tures and the way Minolta has paid close 
attention to even the smallest details. 
And by all means, compare it with other 
cameras in its price range. You&apos;ll soon 
see why more Americans buy Minolta 
than any other brand of SLR. For litera-

A Naturalist at Large 



by William K. Hartmann 



End of a Small Wonder 



The seventeen-year rise 
and fall of a volcanic 
crater field in Hawaii 

The world is full of age-old geo- 
logic wonders that have been turned 
into natural parks and are visited 
and enjoyed by droves of sightseers. 
Less familiar are young geologic 
features that have comparable inter- 
est, but form and then vanish in a 
matter of decades. Such a place is 
Kapoho, a small village at the east- 
ernmost tip of the island of Hawaii. 

On January 13, 1960, a volcanic 
eruption began near Kapoho along 
a fissure extending northeast from 
the Hawaii Volcanoes National 
Park. As lava flowed toward the 
village, its 287 inhabitants were 
evacuated. On January 28, the lava 
entered the village. The houses of 
lightweight wooden construction, 
all that is needed in the mild 
Hawaiian climate, burned to the 
ground. Only tangled metal sheeting 
from the corrugated iron roofs re- 
mained among the volcanic cinders. 
The lava flows reached the shore 
about a mile away and destroyed 
the beach homes there before 
splashing into the sea. By the time 
the eruption ended on February 6, 
lava had covered 1,925 acres, of 
which 400 were new land added to 
the island of Hawaii. 

The last stages of the eruption 
built a large cinder cone, 420 feet 
high, later named Puu Laimana. 
This cone ejected a vast quantity of 
cinders, which blanketed more than 
55 acres to a depth greater than five 
feet and created a strange panorama 
resembling a gray snowscape. The 
final phase of the eruption threw out 
showers of lava blocks, including 
pieces a few feet across. These 
chunks shot high into the air, then 



thundered down on the cinder field, 
leaving a landscape pocked with im- 
pact craters, each surrounded by a 
raised rim of displaced cinders. Ex- 
cept for the blue Hawaiian sky, the 
low scudding clouds, and the distant 
horizon of green foliage undamaged 
by the volcanic fireworks, the tab- 
leau looked like a scene on the 
moon. 

In the early sixties, as United 
States scientists studied the lunar 
surface in preparation for our first 
manned landings, the similarity of 
Kapoho to the moon did not go un- 
noticed. In 1964, as part of the prep- 
aration, the first close-ups of the 
moon were obtained by a Ranger 
spacecraft carrying television cam- 
eras. The last photographs trans- 
mitted before the unmanned space- 
craft crash-landed revealed a lunar 
landscape of rolling craters and 
occasional rocks. The late Gerard 
Kuiper, an astronomer at the Uni- 
versity of Arizona and an experi- 
menter on the Ranger team, ana- 
lyzed these photographs of the 
moon&apos;s crater field and noted the 
resemblance to the Kapoho crater 
field. He subsequently became in- 
terested in the Kapoho site and 
utilized the Kapoho photographs in 
some of his lunar reports to NASA. 

Kuiper believed that most of the 
relatively small lunar craters (from 
about five to fifty feet or more in 
diameter) resulted from the collapse 
of granular soil and cinders into sub- 
surface cavities in lava flows. Other 
scientists, however, believed that 
these small depressions, called sec- 
ondary craters, resulted from the 
low-speed impact of debris thrown 
out of larger craters that had been 
caused by the crash of meteorites. 
This latter theory has apparently 
been confirmed by data from the 
Apollo flights. The Kapoho crater 



field, in spite of being fundamen- 
tally volcanic, has almost exactly 
the same properties as those hy- 
pothesized for the secondary impact 
craters formed in the loose lunar 
dust. For this reason, in 1967 I 
made the first of several visits to 
the Kapoho site to pursue my lunar 
research with Kuiper. 

The whole region was dotted with 
shallow, flat-floored craters from 
about a foot and a half to five feet in 
diameter. Lying in many of these 
depressions were the irregular lava 
rocks that had produced them. 
Other craters contained no visible 
rocks, but excavation uncovered 
buried rocks. This established that 
these craters had been formed by 
the impact of lava fragments. In 
addition, I found a few examples of 
another type of crater with a conical 
floor. These proved to be drainage 
craters, that is, features formed by 
the hourglasslike seepage of surface 
cinders into cavities in the under- 
lying lava flow — in conformance 
with Kuiper&quot; s theory of lunar cra- 
ters. So Kapoho was a test-bed for 
both crater theories. But the basic 
cause of the similarity between the 
lunar and Kapoho craters was that, 
in both instances, a layer of granu- 
lar soil had been bombarded by 
flying rock debris. 

When I returned to the Kapoho 
crater field in 1968, I found it was 
changing to a nonlunar appear- 
ance. Whereas formerly the field 
was a cindery gray, by 1968 the 
craters had developed mysterious 
ringlike white markings on their 
rims. The whole area looked like a 
series of thin white doughnuts. Ap- 
parently, moisture caught in the soil 
during rainfall percolated back up 
to the crater surface during dry 
periods. The moisture contained

CUSTOMER INFORMATION FROM GENERAL MOTORS 



WHY WE&apos;RE INTRODUCING 
ADTOMimC SAFETY REITS NOW 

WILL YOU LIKE THEM? WILL YOU CHOOSE THEM? WE NEED TO KNOW. 



In May we will make 
automatic safety belts avail- 
able as an option on the 
Chevrolet Chevette. We&apos;re 
doing this now because we 
need to know how well you 
like them and whether you&apos;ll 
choose them. 

Not enough people use 
the safety belts that are now 
standard equipment in every 
car. So the government has 
directed that some form of 
passive restraint, such as air 
cushions or automatic safety 
belts, be built into every car 
by 1984. 

The automatic safety 
belt is very easy to use. 
When the door is opened, 
the safety belt automatically 
moves out of the way so that 
the passenger has room to 



sit down. As the door is 
closed, the safety belt auto- 
matically fits around the 
passenger Knee bolsters are 
built into the instrument 
panel to help limit forward 
movement during an acci- 
dent. In addition, regular lap 
belts can be fastened to sup- 
plementthe automatic safety 
belts. 

We also have plans to 
offer air cushions in some of 
our future cars, because they 
have advantages in conven- 
ience and appearance. And 
we are working hard to im- 
prove them. 

On the other hand, auto- 
matic safety belts have 
these advantages: they are 
lighter, which helps gas mile- 
age; their cost is relatively 
low, and they would be easy 
to replace. 

We&apos;d like you to try the 
new automatic belts and 
judge them for yourself. 

How many people order auto- 
matic safety belts, and what 



they think of them, will help 
us plan our cars for the 1980&apos;s. 
That&apos;s why we&apos;re offer 
ing the option of automatic 
safety belts now, so you can 
tell us how to design these 
cars the way you want thenx

our continuing effort to give cus- 
tomers useful information about 
their cars and trucks and the 
company that builds them.

Ferns grow around a volcanic 
rock in a Hawaiian cinder field. 
The craters that once existed 
here have been obliterated. 



salts and other materials in solution, 
which were deposited in the process 
of evaporation. Since the evapora- 
tion rate was greatest on the raised 
crater rims, deposits of light-colored 
evaporites built up in those spots. 

Still another, but probably re- 
lated, surprise came in 1968 when I 
found grasses were growing in the 
evaporite rings marking the crater 
rims. One might have predicted that 
plants would spring up in the crater 
centers, where water would be 
likely to collect — a situation often 
found in desert craters. But here, 
rings of grass had sprouted in the 
cinders of the lava rims. Perhaps 
there was too much water in the 
crater centers. Or perhaps the evap- 
orites or the water-flow rates on the 
rims provided a more favorable 
environment. 

The development of vegetation 
in the cinder fields continued into 
the seventies, with plants taking 
root in all sorts of microenviron- 
ments. Clusters of flowering plants 
grew in pockets of rich volcanic 
soil, and ferns peeked out from 
under some of the large lava boul- 
ders. On the outskirts of the cinder 
field, professional orchid growers 



took advantage of the new soil to 
cultivate beds of flowers. 

Over the years, as water and vol- 
canic gases passed upward through 
the cinders, leaving behind colored 
residues of evaporites and subli- 
mates, many parts of the surface of 
the Kapoho crater field became 
bonded into a crusty orangish layer. 
As if keeping pace with space ex- 
ploration, Kapoho was being trans- 
formed into an analogue of another 
extraterrestrial object — the red 
planet. This was later confirmed by 
Viking photographs taken on the 
surface of Mars, which showed that 
its dusty soil is marked by crustlike 
flaky material at the surface. Many 
scientists believe that this thin, 
so-called duracrust is the result of 
the cementing of Martian dust par- 
ticles by sulfates and other materials 
deposited when moisture evapo- 
rated from the Martian soil. There 
is no known surface water in liquid 
form on Mars. But there is presumed 
to be a small amount of water in 
other forms and other places — 
locked in the Martian rocks and as 
ice under the soil. Current evidence 
indicates that this limited supply 
may vaporize from the soil into the 
air and be transported back again 
during day-night cycles, forming 
the Martian duracrust layers in the 
process. 

In the mid-seventies, there were 
disturbing rumors of one more 
change at Kapoho. The crater field 
was being destroyed. I had known 
about the orchid beds planted on 



the fringes of the cinder area and 
was aware that some cinder and ash 
quarrying had been done, but these 
activities took place too far from 
the central crater area to have 
caused any damage. 

During a quick stopover in 1975 
I was therefore astonished to dis- 
cover that although the cinder field 
seemed to have the same general 
contours as before, the craters were 
almost invisible. Only about a dozen 
could be seen instead of the former 
hundreds. A few motorcycle tracks 
aroused my suspicion. Could motor- 
cyclists have wiped out the craters 
that had formerly covered several 
acres of cinders? 

A more extended visit in 1977 
convinced me that this is exactly 
what had happened. Motorcycle 
tracks now etch one side of the cone 
where a crater field had been prom- 
inent. Another side of the cone has 
been transformed into a race track 
delineated by a set of old tires and 
completely furrowed by wheel 
marks. Late-afternoon lighting, 
which had once revealed a lunarlike 
landscape, now shows only the 
grooves of tire tracks. A geologist 
colleague who visited the area in 
November 1977 told me that he 
climbed to the summit of the Ka- 
poho cone and could find no por- 
tion of the entire crater field left 
unscarred by motorcycles. 

The Kapoho landscape, with its 
unearthly craters, ghostly rusting 
building roofs, and unpredicted nat- 
ural changes, was a fascinating 
place to visit from year to year. It 
was almost completely ignored by 
tourists driving by on an adjacent 
highway, including those interested 
in natural history, yet it was of 
value. I mourn its passing. 

What lessons, if any, can be 
drawn from Kapoho&apos;s fate? First, 
the world is full of small-scale natu- 
ral wonders, but they have to be 
noticed if they are to contribute to 
our enlightenment. Second, these 
sites deserve better than to be 
ground into dust. During its short 
lifetime Kapoho was such a region; 
it even played a humble role in one 
of the great adventures of human 
history — the lunar landings. I for 
one wish it could have been saved 
and watched for a few more years.

Drumming Along the Perak 

by Edward O. Moll 



The riverbank beat of the 
tuntong has diminished, but 
this Malaysian terrapin and 
its prized eggs may be making 
a comeback — with help from 
its main predator 



By early December the annual 
monsoon torrents have subsided on 
the west coast of Malaysia. As the 
Perak River recedes, its beaches 
and sand islands, inundated for 
weeks, begin to reappear, creating 
the right conditions for the renewal 
of a centuries-old event — the nest- 
building and egg-laying activity of 
the tuntong. 

Soundlessly, a female tuntong 
with a shell length of some twenty 
inches, her back glistening in the 
moonlight, emerges from the river. 
With neck fully extended, she ex- 
amines the open stretch of sand be- 
fore her. A few feet away another 
female comes out of the water, fol- 
lowed by another and another, until 
thirty or more line the riverbank. 
Boldness increases with numbers, 
and the herd begins to lumber hesi- 
tantly across the sand. Intermit- 
tently, one will stop and press its 
snout to the sand as if trying to 
sense the perfect nest site. Some 
may begin to dig, but more often 
than not, they move on after throw- 
ing sand over their shells several 
times with their limbs. One site after 
another is rejected, but finally the 
search ends and the tuntong begin 
digging their nests. 

The eifect of the digging is daz- 
zling. Moonlight reflects off the 
arched streams of sand being 
thrown up in all directions, trans- 
forming the beach into a silvery 
fountain. The display continues for 
some thirty minutes before digging 
subsides. After a short lull while the 
eggs are laid, the show resumes 
with a spectacular auditory sequel 
to the visual display. Each female 
now fills the hole and compacts the 



sand by dropping her 40-pound hulk 
upon it. The resultant &quot;tun tonk&quot; 
sound has given rise to this turtle&apos;s 
Malay name, tuntong. As the tun- 
tong drum the sand, the sound drifts 
along the Perak, announcing as it 
has for years the annual tuntong 
nesting ceremony. It is a sound 
eagerly awaited by Malaysians, who 
have long cherished tuntong eggs. 

The tuntong, or river terrapin 
(Batagur baska), is a member of the 
Emydidae, a family that includes 
freshwater turtles and terrapins. 
Batagur inhabits southeastern Asia, 
along with seventeen other emydid 
genera and a variety of turtles and 
tortoises of other families. The co- 
existence of so many close relatives 
is possible because of their exten- 
sive adaptive radiation into a vari- 
ety of habitats. Some left the water, 
the ancestral habitat, to live terres- 
trially. Others became largely am- 
phibious, dwelling on the forest 
floor as well as in the small streams, 
pools, and swamps that abound in 
rain forests. Still others frequented 
larger bodies of water — the rivers 
and few lakes of the region. Finally, 
a few, such as the tuntong, which is 
probably descended from a line of 
exclusively freshwater turtles, en- 
croached upon the sea turtles&apos; do- 
main — the ocean. 

For the most part, tuntong in- 
habit estuaries and the adjacent 
areas of seacoast, an environment 
to which they are well adapted. 
Their slender snouts, powerful 
hind limbs, and broadly webbed feet 
bespeak riverine habits. Their ser- 



rate jaws tell of a largely herbivo- 
rous diet, and their high-domed, 
seamless, massively buttressed 
shells presumably discourage pre- 
dation by carnivores such as the 
saltwater crocodile. 

Throughout most of the year, the 
tuntong of the Perak live along 
those parts of its banks and tribu- 
taries that are affected by the tides. 
As the tide rises, the tuntong move 
upriver, frequently into small, but 
productive, tributaries. Here they 
forage until ebb tide when the cur- 
rent carries them downstream. Al- 
though the extent of their daily 
movements is poorly understood, 
males have home ranges of up to 
eight river miles and females two 
miles. Juveniles, being more seden- 
tary, seldom move along more than 
a quarter-mile stretch of river. 

The tuntong usually graze on the 
stems, leaves, and fruits of river- 
side plants. On the Perak River, the

fruit of the berembang(5o««(?rar/a), 
a widely distributed mangrove, is a 
dietary staple. Most feeding occurs 
at high tide when vegetation is ex- 
posed and fruits from low-hanging 
limbs dangle in the water, but 
tuntong will eat whenever food is 
available. I once witnessed a small 
troop of long-tailed macaques drop- 
ping berembang fruit out of a tree 
into the river. Beneath the tree, sev- 
eral large tuntong had assembled to 
devour the choice fruit. Mollusks, 
crustaceans, and fish form a small 
but frequent dietary supplement. 

When and where courtship and 
mating take place are not known. 
Males in the Perak River are in 
breeding coloration by September, 
and since they do not accompany 
females on their nesting migration 
in November, mating presumably 
occurs sometime in between. 
Perak River females and juveniles 
vary from shades of olive gray to 



green and brown. When the males 
are not in breeding condition, their 
coloration resembles that of females 
but is somewhat darker, particularly 
on the shell. As the monsoon season 
approaches, the male&apos;s head, neck, 
and legs turn jet black. In sharp con- 
trast, the iris changes from a yellow- 
ish cream color to pure white. 

With the subsiding of the mon- 
soons in November, the females, 
driven by some unknown stimulus, 
assemble and begin their annual 
journey upstream to nest. As the 
river narrows, the bank vegetation 
— coconut and nipa palms and man- 
groves — gives way to less salt-toler- 
ant species. Along some stretches, 
the large, profusely branched, nar- 
row-leaved trees of the gallery for- 
est, or neram, still overhang the 
river. Where the neram has been 
cut, feathery clusters of bamboo 
and lalang grass have replaced the 
trees. Beyond the river&apos;s banks. 



rubber and oil palm estates have 
taken the place of the neram. 

Sand gradually replaces mud on 
the bottom of the river, and some 
fifty miles from the river&apos;s mouth, 
large sand banks and islands, essen- 
tial for tuntong nesting, emerge 
from the water. For the next three 
months, the females lay their eggs 
here, emerging from the river in 
staggered waves. 

The tuntong&apos; s reproductive pat- 
tern, similar to that of other large 
aquatic turtles occupying sizable 
bodies of water, includes seasonal, 
communal nesting on ancestral 
sites, where each female lays sev- 
eral large clutches of small eggs in 
carefully constructed, covered 
nests. This survival strategy is ex- 
travagant but simple: lay enough 
eggs enough times and some will 
survive to carry on the species. The 
repetition of this pattern, however, 
is its greatest failing, for predators

become as attuned to the cycle as 
the turtles themselves. In this age of 
television, what armchair naturalist 
has not accompanied Jacques 
Cousteau or Mariin Perkins to wit- 
ness the carnage that takes place on 
a turtle-nesting beach? 

Many turtle species have evolved 
far less wasteful methods of per- 
petuating their kind, but being small 
and unspectacular, they make poor 
television stars. A host of small, 
specialized species, including some 
mud turtles, Malayan box turtles, 
and spiny hill tortoises, have 
evolved a reproductive pattern that 
largely avoids considerable preda- 
tion. Characteristics of this success- 
ful pattern include long, poorly de- 
fined nesting seasons and solitary, 
as opposed to communal, nesting. 
A female lays only a few eggs, 
which are so large that they may 
barely squeeze through her shell 
opening. Hatchlings from such 
eggs, being larger, are less subject 
to predation and a small yolk plug 
attached to their belly provides suf- 
ficient food to carry them through 
the hazardous early weeks of life. 

Why the reproductive patterns of 
Batagur and other large turtles did 
not evolve along this seemingly 
more sensible route is difficult to 
answer. Despite the apparent dis- 
advantages, the tuntong&apos;s reproduc- 
tive pattern has adaptive values best 
recognized by examining its parts. 
First, most nestings take place en 
masse. Prior to World War II, hun- 
dreds of tuntongs nested together; 
now groups of even thirty to fifty 
are rare. Anyone attempting to 
locate clutches of eggs can readily 
understand the advantages of group 
nesting. Locating a solitary nest 
would present no problem to an ex- 
perienced egg collector. The in- 
creased traffic on the beach due to 
group nesting, however, thoroughly 
obliterates any clues to individual 
nests. 

Nesting behavior, elaborate and 
surprisingly variable, is another 
adaptive trait. When tuntongs nest, 
they excavate both a body pit and 
an egg cavity. A body pit is simply 
a large depression, varying from a 
few inches to more than three feet, 
which the turtle makes with both its 
fore and hind limbs. After finishing 
the pit, the turtle digs a six- to 



twelve-inch-deep egg cavity within 
it. Body pits are characteristic of 
sand-nesting turtles, and at least 
one function attributed to them is to 
protect the eggs from extreme sur- 
face temperatures. The great varia- 
bility in pit depths may also benefit 
the species by increasing a nesting 
area&apos;s capacity. Large numbers of 
turtles on a small beach frequently 
destroy each other&apos;s nests, but 
when the nests are at a variety of 
levels, fewer are ruined. 

The number and size of eggs laid 
are closely linked adaptive features. 
The body capacity of a female turtle 
limits the volume of reproductive 
material at any one time. This 
creates a dilemma, for while there 
are advantages to producing both 
large numbers of progeny and well- 
developed, large individuals, the 
two goals conflict. A turtle&apos;s clutch 
size and egg size represent an adap- 
tive compromise evolved over eons 
of time. In the case oi Batagur, the 
average clutch size of twenty-six 
eggs is somewhat smaller than ex- 
pected for a large turtle with this 
type of reproductive pattern. The 
mean egg size, some one and a half 
by two and a half inches, is some- 
what larger than expected. Larger 
hatchling size is particularly impor- 
tant to tuntongs because the hatch- 
lings must make the long, hazard- 
ous journey back to the river mouth 
soon after leaving the nest. In this 
instance, the advantages of large 
eggs outweigh the advantages of 
extra numbers. 

Tuntongs have developed an 
elaborate procedure for covering 
their nests. Whereas digging the pit 
and laying the eggs require some- 
what less than an hour, covering the 
eggs may exceed two hours. After 
laying, the turtles scrape sand into 
their holes and pack them down. 
They then begin moving toward the 
river, throwing sand behind them 
with all four legs. Some six to eight 
feet away from its nest, each turtle 
usually digs a false body pit, then 
continues to move away, always 
throwing sand backward over its 
trail. After the false — and occasion- 
ally turned-back — trails have been 
intricately laid out, the turtles enter 
the water. 

At most nesting areas throughout 
their range, man and tuntong have 



evolved specific relationships. But 
nowhere has this association been 
more colorful than on Malaysia&apos;s 
Perak River, where the collecting of 
tuntong eggs was long the royal pre- 
rogative of the sultan of Perak. Sir 
Frank Swettenham, an early British 
official assigned to Perak State, pre- 
served the splendor of this event in 
a short sketch he wrote at the turn 
of the century, when tuntong herds 
numbered in the thousands. Near 
the end of every year, the sultan&apos;s 
men arrived at the most popular 
nesting sites, particularly at a large 
sand island known as Pasir Telor 
(&quot;egg sand&quot;), to guard against 
poachers. 

The turtles reputedly laid at three 
intervals. After the first, the guards 
removed the eggs and delivered 
them to the sultan. The eggs of the 
next laying were kept in situ for the 
royal party. The last eggs laid were 
left in the sand to hatch and main- 
tain the population, a far-sighted 
conservation measure for the late 
1800s. 

The riverine dwellers looked for- 
ward to the pomp and excitement 
surrounding the second laying. On 
the morning following this laying, a 
messenger traveled to the sultan&apos;s 
palace some fifty miles upriver, 
while other guards busied them- 
selves locating the nests by probing 
the sand with long, pointed wood 
poles. A twig stuck into the sand 
marked the nest sites. Upon receiv- 
ing word of the tuntong nesting, the 
sultan called his family and neigh- 
boring chiefs and their families to- 
gether for the two-day trip. The 
procession, comprising some fif- 
teen to twenty large houseboats, 
together with a number of bamboo 
rafts carrying some 150 egg collec- 
tors, must have been imposing. 
Swettenham described the boats as 
&quot;graceful and picturesque barges. 
. . . over the stern half of the boat is 
built a palm-thatched covering on 
a slight wooden frame, while cur-

tains secure privacy.&quot; The owner 
and his family and friends rode 
within the enclosure on a floor of 
mats and cushions. The crew occu- 
pied the vessel&apos;s forward half — with 
the exception of a steersman who 
sat high in the stern so that he could 
see over the cabin. 

The boats were draped with 
colorful flags and many carried 
gongs and drums. The most gaily 
decorated boat carried the sultan&apos;s 
principal wife. The covered portion 
was &quot;decorated with six scarlet- 
bordered white umbrellas.&quot; Two 
additional umbrellas with black and 
silver fringes were held by guards 
who stood throughout the day shad- 
ing the stateroom entrance. A royal 
musician seated in the bow played 
an antique silver trumpet. 

The royal ladies of the party dug 
up the nests. On the morning after 
their arrival at Pasir Telor, these 
ladies, dressed in their smartest gar- 
ments and wearing their costliest 
jewels, disembarked with a crowd 
of attendants for the digging cere- 
mony. The beach became a blaze of 
&quot;brilliant-colored silks, of painted 
sarongs, cloth-of-gold scarves, and 
embroidered gauze veils; of bright 
sunshades, gold bracelets, neck- 
laces, and bangles; of curious 
jeweled brooches, massive hair- 
pins, and rings flashing the light of 
diamonds and rubies.&quot; Each lady 
chose a twig-marked nest and with 
little apparent regard for her costly 
garments dug through the sand with 
her hands. Onlookers maintained a 
friendly rivalry over which lady 
would find the largest clutch. The 
competition continued throughout 
the morning until the heated sand 
finally forced the parties back to the 
shelter of the boats. There the cele- 
bration continued with swimming 
and feasting on turtle eggs. 

Today, eggs are no longer re- 
moved by the sultan&apos;s party but 
rather by collectors who hold li- 
censes for the various nesting areas

along the Perak. To obtain a license, 
each collector must agree to give 
one-third of his eggs to the sultan 
and one-third to the Perak Game 
Department. 

Collectors maintain that the koel, 
a scarlet-eyed, glossy black mem- 
ber of the cuckoo family, leads the 
tuntong each year up the Perak 
River to the nesting beaches. Hence 
the bird&apos;s first melodious calls re- 
sounding over the Perak in late 
October or early November signal 
the licensee to prepare the nesting 
beaches. 

Beliefs about the tuntong tend to 
be highly localized although similar- 
ities to other areas do exist. On 
northern Malaysia&apos;s Kedah River, 
egg collectors await the arrival of 
the &quot;raja tuntong,&quot; a turtle with a 
pure white head and a crimson 
stripe between its eyes, which re- 
putedly leads the tuntong upriver to 
their nesting areas. This turtle, how- 
ever, is actually a difiTerent species, 
a painted batagur {Callagur bor- 
neoensis). 




On the Perak River, licensees 
clean the beaches of lalang grass 
and sedges to expose the large 
tracts of open sand necessary to at- 
tract tuntong. At one time, large 
areas of open sand probably oc- 
curred naturally on the riverbanks, 
but silt from years of forest clearing 
and tin mining has increased the 
organic matter in the sand to a point 
where vegetation now flourishes. 
Ironically, the Perak tuntong have 
become dependent upon humans 
for survival, for they could not last 
long without suitable nesting 
beaches. 

Once they have cleared the beach 
of vegetation, the men build conical 
sand hillocks to attract tuntongs to 
the site. A bamboo post, its upper 
end split and frayed to hold a cup, is 
often placed in the center of the 
mound, making the total height of 
the structure some five to six feet, 
about half of which is sand. Various 
odoriferous substances, such as 
charcoal or incense, are burned in 
the cup. Some collectors pour whis- 



40 




key over the sand to enhance its 
drawing power. 

Whether the sand mounds ac- 
tually attract tuntongs to a beach is 
debatable but not completely dis- 
missible. Tuntongs seem to seek 
out beaches with high profiles for 
nesting and certainly the mounds in- 
crease the beach&apos;s height. During 
nesting, I have observed that one or 
more turtles always attempted to 
lay on or near a mound. Even when 
only one or two turtles nested, they 
frequently chose the immediate 
vicinity of a mound although the 
entire beach was open. Such be- 
havior, of course, may be the result 
of the pressure of natural selection 
to nest near the highest point of a 
beach, the area usually safest from 
flooding. 

With the beach prepared, the men 
await the arrival of the turtles; at 
their appearance, each licensee at- 
tempts to lure the herd to his beach. 
A typical ploy is to anchor bunches 
of bananas and other fruits in the 
river near the beach for the turtles 
to eat. Or at night, the men sit in 
blinds and pound bricks and rocks 
on the sand in an attempt to dupli- 
cate the sound made by the nesting 
tuntong. When I studied the turtles. 



one man went so far as to construct 
an apparatus consisting of a con- 
crete slab suspended by an inner 
tube from the roof of a shed. One 
edge of the slab just touched the 
ground. By stepping on the slab 
with the proper rhythm, a man 
could closely duplicate the drum- 
ming of the tuntong. Although no 
solid evidence exists that this sound 
attracts the turtles, there is some 
indication that they can hear it; if 
one turtle begins drumming, an- 
other one usually follows suit. 

The egg collectors do not disturb 
the nesting turtles. At dawn, the 
collectors probe the sand on the 
nesting beach with pointed sticks. 
Despite the female&apos;s elaborate 
cover-up efforts, experienced col- 
lectors can usually judge where the 
buried eggs lie. To ascertain the 
exact location, they force their 
poles into the sand to a depth of two

to three feet. If, upon removal, a 
small ball of sand and yolk clings to 
the point, then a branch is stuck in 
the hole to mark the spot. Members 
of the collector&apos;s family follow 
along to dig up the valuable cache. 
At times when nesting has been par- 
ticularly heavy and most clues to 
individual nest sites are obliterated, 
collectors resort to hoes and dig up 
the entire beach in their egg hunt. 

Tlintong eggs are a special deli- 
cacy in Malaysia and are highly 
favored over sea turtle or fowl eggs, 
bringing three to four times the 
price. No doubt much of their popu- 
larity stems from their reputed 
aphrodisiac properties. Whatever 
the reason, all collected eggs are 
quickly sold to the large numbers of 
villagers who line the beaches hop- 
ing to purchase several eggs. 

Recent declines in tuntong num- 
bers indicate that the eggs have be- 
come too popular and the harvest- 
ing too efficient. Before World War 
II some 450,000 to 650,000 eggs 
were collected annually ; now 20 ,000 



42 



eggs is an exceptionally good har- 
vest. The tuntong&apos;s problems, how- 
ever, are far more widespread than 
mere overexploitation of their eggs. 
Their downfall apparently began 
with World War II. Prior to this 
time eggs were collected only by 
the sultan&apos;s men, his family, and 
friends. Female tuntongs were pro- 
tected, and many eggs were left in 
the sand to replenish the popula- 
tion. During the Japanese occupa- 
tion, however, eggs and adults alike 
were eaten and the tuntong popula- 
tion decreased markedly. It has 
never recovered, and the odds of it 
ever doing so become more formi- 
dable every year. 

Despite protection by law, adults 
are still regularly killed, many at the 
hands of Malaysian fishermen. Be- 
cause hooks can be lost and nets 
damaged whenever terrapins are 
unintentionally caught, angered 
fishermen frequently slit the turtles&apos; 
throats before throwing them back. 
Equally destructive are the unli- 
censed egg collectors who capture 
females during the nesting season 
and use various forms of torture to 
make them lay their eggs. If these 
measures are unsuccessful they 
often cut open the turtle and discard 
all but the eggs. Other turtles are 
captured and sold for food by 
poachers. Malays are forbidden by 
their Islamic religion to eat turtle 



flesh, but the Chinese, who make 
up 39 percent of the population of 
West Malaysia, provide a ready 
market for the meat. 

Perhaps even more destructive to 
the ultimate survival of the tuntong 
is the steady deterioration of its 
habitat. Siltation from mining and 
industrial pollution, due to insecti- 
cides and wastes from the oil palm 
industry, are steadily reducing the 
river&apos;s carrying capacity. Long 
stretches of bank have been cleared 
of vegetation, despite existing laws 
to the contrary. Many fertile tribu- 
tary streams have been dammed for 
roads and irrigation projects. 

On the positive side, the Malay- 
sian government has always been 
conservation-minded and is one of 
the most progressive and enlight- 
ened Southeast Asian countries in 
this regard. In 1967 its game depart- 
ment took over an ineflFective hatch- 
ery operation begun in the 1950s, 
and under a new program, some 
7,000 yearlings have been released 
into the Perak River. A recent cen- 
sus shows that the river&apos;s tuntong 
population contains approximately 
25 percent juveniles. While small, it 
is healthy and shows excellent 
growth potential. The hatchery pro- 
gram seems to be working, but this 
conclusion cannot be confirmed un- 
til many new females begin show- 
ing up on the nesting beaches. 

With the coming of December, 
the drumming of the tuntong will 
again resound along the banks of the 
Perak. The trumpets, brightly deco- 
rated boats, and bejeweled ladies 
with their fancy silks will be gone. 
The drumming will be softer now. 
for the turtles number in the hun- 
dreds rather than in the thousands. 
Still the drumming persists — and 
with it, the hope that the herds will 
someday regain their former mag- 
nificence so that future generations 
will have the opportunity to marvel 
at the tuntong&apos;s annual nesting

Short Ungulates 

by G. Causey Whittow 



In the rain forest, small 
deer and antelopes are swift 
and solitary. On the plains, 
they dissipate body heat and 
conserve water with efficiency 

Most hoofed animals are large; in 
fact, some of the largest land ani- 
mals are ungulates. Giraffes and 
rhinoceroses are well-known ex- 
amples of the height and bulk at- 
tained by some ungulate species, 
but there are many others that are 
conspicuous by any standard of 
measurement. The larger ungulates 
are also highly visible because they 
tend to congregate in herds on open 
grassland. 

At the other end of the size scale 
is a variety of diminutive, incon- 
spicuous, and little-known species. 
Many of the smallest ungulates, 
such as the lesser mouse deer and 
royal antelope, are wary creatures 
that live a mainly solitary existence 
in the forests of tropical Asia and 
Africa. 

All ungulates probably de- 
scended from forest mammals simi- 
lar in many respects to the small 
antelopes and mouse deer of today. 
The spread of some of the early 
forest mammals into grassland 
would have favored an increase in 
their body size. Because large ani- 
mals are endowed with a small sur- 
face area in relation to their body 
mass, in open grassland they would 
gain relatively less heat from solar 
radiation. In addition, the body 
tissues of a big animal can store 
more metabolic heat. The alterna- 

k-dik Eliol Porter 



tive to storing heat in this way is 
losing it to the environment. 

In a hot climate, significant body 
heat may be lost only through evap- 
oration of water, either by panting 
or sweating. Consequently, heat 
storage saves precious body water, 
which can be difficult to replace 
because water sources are often 
widely separated and periodically 
scarce on the plains. Heat stored 
during the day is lost at night, when 
temperatures are lower, by such 
nonevaporative means as convec- 
tion, conduction, and radiation. 

The camel is the classic example 
of an animal that saves water by 
storing heat during the day and re- 
leasing it at night. However, heat 
storage is widespread in the larger 
ungulates. Some species, such as 
Thomson&apos;s gazelle, have special 
vascular arrangements to keep the 
brain cool, while allowing the tem- 
perature of the rest of the body to 
rise to levels that would damage 
sensitive brain tissue. In this way, 
large amounts of heat may be 
stored, the magnitude of the stor- 
age being directly related to the in- 
crease in body temperature. 

Small mammals are particularly 
susceptible to dehydration because 
of their relatively large body surface 
areas from which water may be lost. 
Also, their comparatively high 
metabolic rates increase their oxy- 
gen requirements. The relatively 
greater amount of oxygen is ac- 
quired by augmented respiratory 
activity. An inevitable consequence 
of increased respiration is a greater 
rate of evaporation from the respira- 



tory tract and a further loss of body 
water. 

The mouse deer of Southeast 
Asia, the related water chevrotain 
of Africa, and the Indian chevrotain 
are found only in tropical rain 
forests. These tiny ungulates enjoy 
one of the most equable climates in 
the world. Mainly nocturnal, they 
rarely emerge from the forest cover 
into open sunlight. On the forest 
floor, they experience little in the 
way of daily temperature changes; 
seasonal changes in such an en- 
vironment are also minor. A recent 
experiment conducted in Malaysia 
revealed that the lesser mouse deer 
was not particularly well adapted, 
physiologically, to either heat or 
cold. The mouse deer has thin, 
poorly insulated limbs, very little 
fat, and a sleek coat; it is clearly not 
designed for cold climates. How- 
ever, when experimenters exposed 
the mouse deer to daytime condi- 
tions prevailing outside the forest, 
the animal became distressed. This 
was probably because mouse deer 
never encounter the hotter environ- 
ment outside the forest and have 
not adapted to such conditions. 

Some small antelopes, however, 
do inhabit extremely dry, semidesert 
country. Guenther&apos;sand Kirk&apos;s dik- 
diks live in this type of environment 
in East Africa. Both species are so 
well adapted to arid conditions that 
they can survive without drinking, 
deriving their water from the small 
amount contained in the vegetation 
they eat and from that produced in 
the body by metabolism. They are 
also able to produce very dry feces

and a highly concentrated urine, 
resulting in a considerable saving 
of body water. When dik-diks were 
deprived of water in an experi- 
mental situation and simultaneously 
exposed to high temperatures, they 
restricted their panting response so 
that water loss from the body by 
way of the respiratory tract was 
curtailed. Not surprisingly, this re- 
sulted in an increase in the animals&apos; 
body temperature. However, pro- 
vided that the body temperature 
does not rise to lethal levels, there 
is an advantage in a high body tem- 
perature during exposure to heat: 
the temperature diflFerence between 
the animal and its environment is 
increased, thereby permitting 
greater loss of heat from the animal 



to its surroundings by nonevapora- 
tive pathways of heat loss, which 
do not involve the loss of body 
water. 

In the dik-diks, duikers, and suni 
of East Africa, and also in the 
mouse deer of Malaysia, panting 
rather than sweating is the major 
avenue of heat loss from the body 
during heat stress. In contrast, the 
large ungulates characteristically 
pant and sweat, but of the two, 
sweating is the more important 
means of losing heat. This differ- 
ence seems to be related to body 
size. There are limits to the rate at 
which a large animal can move its 
relatively heavy chest and respira- 
tory apparatus during panting, and 
this restricts the amount of heat that 








The lone Kirk&apos;s dik-dik, above, 
may be found feeding in proximity 
to other ungulates, but is 
generally solitary except during 
the breeding season. Steinboks,

without any moisture other than 
that obtained from dew and 
plant material. These animals

may be lost that way. Small animals 
have fewer such limitations and 
may attain very high respiratory 
frequencies during panting, losing 
commensurately large amounts of 
heat. 

Adaptation to a drier, more open 
environment is associated with 
structural as well as physiological 
changes in small ungulates. The 
anatomy of their multichambered 
stomach, for example, seems to re- 
flect both the moisture content of 
their food and the relative availa- 
bility of water in the habitat. 
Mouse deer eat fruits and leaves 
with a high water content, and 
water is readily available in the 
tropical rain forest. One of the 
stomach chambers, the omasum, is 
missing in the mouse deer. Believed 
to play a part in the absorption of 
water from ingested food, the 
omasum is, presumably, unneces- 
sary in the mouse deer. The small 
African oribi, on the other hand, 
lives in arid country, and its diet 
has a relatively low water content. 
The large omasum of the oribi may 



indicate the importance of absorb- 
ing water from food as a conserva- 
tion measure. This antelope re- 
sembles the large ungulates of open 
grassland, which characteristically 
have a well-defined omasum. 

Dik-diks in the Serengeti give 
birth to their young twice a year, 
in June and December. The fawns 
born in June arrive at the beginning 
of the long dry season, a testament 
to the adaptability of these animals 
to dry conditions. The adaptations 
of some of the small ungulates to a 
drier environment were probably a 
factor in the emergence of the un- 
gulates from the cover of the forest 
onto the open plains and their sub- 
sequent adaptive radiation. Addi- 
tional information on the thermal 
biology and water relationships of 
the small ungulates may provide us 
with further insights into the evolu- 
tion of the large ungulates of open 
grassland. 

Meanwhile, the future of small 
ungulates, while not assured, is 
brighter than that of many of the 
large, conspicuous ungulates of

should therefore be less susceptible 
to extinction than the larger, more 
specialized species of the open 
grassland. Their small size, noc- 
turnal habits, and solitary nature — 
the reasons for their obscurity to- 
day — may be their salvation in the 
future. □

Death by Decree 

An anthropological approach to capital punishment 



by Colin Turnbull 



Anthropologists, particularly when in the field, try 
to be as detached as possible, eschewing value judg- 
ments, looking at social institutions in their context. 
Sometimes I think they become too detached and lose 
sight of their own social values and responsibilities. 
Sometimes I think they become detached from human- 
ity itself. Yet anthropology is as much a humanity 
as a science, if not more so. If we are dealing ex- 
clusively with society as a system of interrelated social 
institutions, then we can achieve a greater legitimate 
measure of detachment, and indeed we should. But we 
are also dealing with human beings and with human 
values, and we have to recognize that human emotions 
and the need for their expression are powerful forces 
in shaping the structure of any society. To be truly 
holistic, which is one of our claims, we must be sub- 
jective as well as objective in our quest for truth and 
meaning. It is not always a comfortable quest, least 
of all when dealing with an issue such as capital 
punishment. 

In all societies and all legal systems, and certainly 
in our own, persons are distinguished from things. 
To persons we attribute inalienable human rights. The 
institution of slavery was justified, even by Christian 
moralists, by the simple denial of that basic tenet. We 
classified one group of persons as things and from that 
moment on had no moral obligation to them as 
humans. Joseph Towles, a black American anthro- 
pologist, who has some experience of what it is to be 
treated as a thing, recently pointed out to me the 
similarity of the process as applied to slaves and as 
applied to prisoners, particularly those on death row 
today. He was thinking not only of the deprivation 
suffered by, and the injury done to, the slaves but 
also of the deprivation and injury experienced by the 
masters. (It is now recognized that the institution of 
slavery eroded the most basic human values through- 
out the system, brutalizing and dehumanizing both 
slave and master.) As an anthropologist, he was seek- 
ing a structural comparison that would at least explain, 
although not necessarily justify, the brutalization and 



dehumanization that take place on death row, recog- 
nizing that the tragedy is as great for those in authority 
as for those subject to it and that, as with slavery, the 
effects permeate society throughout, threatening our 
very understanding of the word humanity. 

One frequently heard argument is that those on 
death row are not human. They are often referred to 
as savages, beasts, subhuman, beyond redemption, 
animals. The word animal is of particular significance 
to the anthropologist who knows that in many &quot;primi- 
tive&quot; societies this is the word used most often to 
distinguish people from &quot;nonpeople,&quot; or &quot;the 
others.&quot; Exactly the same concept of exclusivity 
underlies racism, religious factionalism, economic 
warfare, political chauvinism, and other similar 
characteristics that exist in our modern society, how- 
ever much we wish it were otherwise. 

We cannot avoid recognizing that this concept 
permeates our society just as strongly as the belief 
that to classify persons as things is wrong. Why then 
do we legitimize it in our prison system? Look at the 
process for a moment if you deny it is so. On entry 
into prison, a prisoner&apos;s name is taken away from him. 
He is bathed; often his hair is cut. He is disinfected, 
given a prison uniform, and deprived of contact with 
the outside world, the world of the living. It is a ritual 
death of his entire being as a human, comparable in 
remarkable detail to initiation rituals in which children 
who are candidates for adulthood are similarly 
separated from their earlier existence, from family 
and friends. Their names are taken from them, and 
they are ritually cleansed and given new uniforms 
appropriate to their limbo state, until they are ready 
for induction as the reborn, the final rite being a ritual 
of rebirth into adulthood. On death row, however, the 
process is reversed. The candidate enters as a man, is 
systematically separated from all that manhood is, and 
placed in limbo until the moment of induction into his 
new status, death. To the structuralist, the process 
makes sense. As a humanist, however much I may 
despise a man who commits murder, I am still

bothered about taking away his humanity. Taking his 
life is bothersome enough; taking his humanity not 
only seems logically unjustified (unless we can show 
that he has no human qualities) but far more impor- 
tant, it legalizes the dangerous concept that under 
certain circumstances — those convenient to society — 
we may classify certain groups of persons as things 
and treat them accordingly. Disposable things. 

However, let us set about finding the reason for 
this concept through an examination of the process. 

My research has only begun; like all fieldwork it 
is intensely involving: at times it depresses; at times it 
inspires. As a humanist I am as much concerned with 
the families of murder victims, with the lives of the 
prison officials, with those who pass sentence and 
those who implement it, as with the lives of the con- 
demned men and women, their families, and the life of 
society at large. This is not an argument for or against 
capital punishment. It is an attempt to understand 
and to provoke the kinds of questions we all ought to 
be trying to answer. Field research spreads like a 
weed, and like a weed it occasionally blossoms into 
flower. Let me give an example so that you can see 
what I mean. 

In the field I enter an African village, and in my 
notebook I hastily sketch an outline of the village — 
the disposition of houses and meeting places. Later I 
supplement these sketches with information about who 
lives where. I have no idea what the significance will 
be, I only know that, more likely than not, it will be 
significant. 

So my first visit to death row produced a sketch of 
a dark, cramped, unventilated basement. There was 
one corridor, with the ten cells facing each other. 
Directly behind them was the chamber housing the 
electric chair. Such light as there was came from an 
inadequate supply of electricity; ironically, across one 
end of the corridor ran a huge thick cable carrying an 
ample supply to the chair. 

The next death row I saw was light and airy, up on 
the second floor. There were some ninety cells (my 
notes would tell me exactly, but that is close enough 
for the moment), in two double rows, each back to 
back, so that each cell looked out only on a heavily 
barred and empty corridor and through that to the 
sunny skies of the world beyond. The electric chair 
was on the ground level, where another, smaller 
double row of cells, similarly back to back, housed 
men within one week of execution. At the time, these 
cells were empty; the second floor was full. 

A third was similar in most respects to the second 
example, except that beyond the empty corridor there 
were no windows letting in a flood of sunlight; instead 
yet another heavily barred corridor was patrolled by 
armed guards, and behind that was a high wall topped 
by windows that let in some diffused daylight. And 
there was no large waiting area way down below (this 



was the top floor), just two tiny cells, barely large 
enough for a cot, in which the condemned spent their 
last night prior to taking the short walk to the gas 
chamber a few feet away. But there was another, more 
curious difference in the last instance: up on the top 
floor, each empty corridor was spaced with television 
sets, one to every three cells, and each cell had a 
control. 

These sketches corresponded to my initial sketches 
of an African village. I began to look for significance 
and instantly I was drawn in several different direc- 
tions, which is why it is impossible to do more than be- 
gin to tell the story in such a short account. The signifi- 
cance lay not just with the obvious difference in the 
quality of living conditions: the amount of fresh air, 
the adequacy of natural light, the sanitation, and the 
degree of isolation (the back-to-back cells each had a 
buttress that projected about three feet beyond the 
inner cell door, so that from one cell you could not 
even see the outstretched arm of the person next door). 
The architecture and furnishings also had to do with 
security and, in this connection, inmate morale, as well 
as with the antiquity of the building, which gave little 
leeway to prison authorities who might have wished 
for a different design, different living conditions. 

A connection was made in my mind between security 
and morale. I began to look, for instance, at the varied 
functions of television. For those prisoners who were 
not semicatatonic, that is, those who were not lying 
on the cold floor of their cell staring at me with un- 
blinking eyes but not seeing, not moving a muscle as I 
tried to engage their attention, television provided 
entertainment and relaxation. But the TV sets also 
served a much less obvious function; they bound 
inmates who could not even see each other into social 
units, within which there was cooperation, caring, and 
understanding. Each unit came to its own agreement 
as to which shows to watch and when. These units 
were rather like sublineages; the lineage as a whole 
manifests itself during exercise periods when half of 
one row at a time is taken to the roof for exercise. 
The television also served to anesthetize, as indeed it 
does in our living rooms. It drained the energy and 
sapped the will to think. It thus functioned (which is 
not to say that it was necessarily installed for this 
purpose) to take away the will to live. A man about 
to die surely has something better to do with his time 
than watch &quot;I Love Lucy.&quot; For this very reason, a 
number of inmates refused television. 

The small basement death row, with cells facing 
each other, with all its disadvantages (it is one of the 
oldest buildings in the country still in use as a peni- 
tentiary) at least afforded the possibility of continual 
visual communication, but for many years the men 
were forbidden to talk above a whisper in an attempt 
to minimize any interaction. It had the disadvantage 
of being in such proximity to the death chamber that

One frequently heard argument 
is that those on death row are not human. 




53 




the sound and smell of death was ever present, 
whereas in other prisons the men were removed from 
that, at least until the final week or day. 

The physical layout also related to the mental condi- 
tion and attitude of the guards, whose mental health 
and very lives are endangered by the system. That 
line of inquiry then sets the anthropologist off on yet 
another track. In one case the wage level for the guards 
was at the legal minimum. The job thus attracted those 
who could not get jobs elsewhere, it was a last resort. 
Few joined the prison service out of any sense of 
responsibility, concern, or interest. Consequently, the 
educational level and morale were low. Induction 
involved ground rules, learning the physical layout of 
the prison, and training in combat duty. There was 
no attempt to help the guard approach the extremely 
difficult task of maintaining appropriate human rela- 
tions: keeping the necessary and correct distance, not 
falling into the trap of being either too friendly or 
too brutal. Understandably, those who err on the side 
of compassion (an unpopular term among prison 
officials) soon collapse under the strain and resign or 
are hospitalized. Those who survive do so by inuring 
themselves against the conditions, which leads rapidly 
to brutalization. 

In accepting the assignment to write on capital 
punishment I immersed myself as much as possible in 
the reality so studiously avoided by those who support 
the institution, and about which even those who 



oppose it often seem so ignorant. I met and talked 
at length not just with men (and one woman) on death 
row in four states but also with their guards and with 
those who would ultimately be involved in their 
execution: wardens, lawyers, judges, families. The 
families of victims are harder to reach, but they have 
been considered just as fully. There is no shortage of 
testimony to the effect that whereas their initial reac- 
tion is to demand vengeance, they ultimately suffer 
from the knowledge that they are responsible for an 
ever widening circle of tragedy. Even more depressing 
than talking with humans waiting to be put to death 
was talking with that minority of guards who claimed, 
vigorously, that capital punishment, with all its horror, 
is both right and good, that the criminals deserve even 
worse. There were those who said they were eager to 
volunteer to be present and would enjoy the sight and 
smell and sound of a murderer being put to death. 
They were sometimes more graphic than that and took 
care to communicate their feelings to the condemned. 
But whereas I might formerly have dismissed them as 
inhuman savages, I now know too much. I can only 
wonder that not more are forced, in self-defense, to 
become brutalized in this way. If I feel any anger and 
contempt it is not for them, it is for the frightening 
number of allegedly decent. God-fearing citizens who 
express similar sentiments from the comfort of their 
firesides, often refusing adamantly to face the facts. 
Tragedy touches all who are affected by the death

penalty, even the most innocent or those merely ful- 
filling their duties and trying to uphold law and order. 
It is measurable in broken families, ill-health, alco- 
holism, mental breakdown, hospitalization, and for 
those who survive these ills, in a brutalization born of 
desperation. 

As an anthropologist I cannot avoid remarking on the 
absence of such a phenomenon in primitive society, 
where the death penalty is generally not given for of- 
fenses against individuals, but only for oflFenses that 
threaten the total society. We would call it treason, but 
in small-scale societies, &quot;blasphemy&quot; would be a bet- 
ter word, referring to any act that could invoke the 
wrath of the divine against the entire society. Even 
then, such an act, being more in the nature of a sin than 
a crime, cannot be corrected by punishment alone. 
Since the offense was against God, punishment should 
be left to God; thus we get the invocation of &quot;super- 
natural sanctions.&quot; Atonement is imperative and pos- 
sible, for the focus is positive, on the good of the total 
society, rather than negative, on the mere destruction 
of a single offender; this requires divine intervention 
rather than punishment. Where it exists in such so- 
cieties, the death penalty is then a part of the ritual 
process of appealing to the divine and is totally devoid 
of the violent demand for retribution found in our 
society. 

This article is written, then, in the hope of creating 
a wider concern about something that touches us all 



and involves not only our rights but our most basic 
human values. It relates to the wider violence that 
increasingly pervades our lives and against which we 
are increasingly inured. 

The first step in classical anthropological observa- 
tion and analysis is descriptive ethnography — to ob- 
serve and describe without academic or personal prej- 
udice. This is where anthropologists demand of them- 
selves an objectivity that is as complete and free of 
value judgments as possible. This is also where our 
holistic concept is important, for since we are unen- 
cumbered by theoretical considerations at this stage, 
we have no preconceptions as to what might be 
significant or insignificant — we observe and note ev- 
erything around us, however trivial it might seem at 
the time, for we are interested in the total social 
system, not just one part of it. 

In this case, although I am concerned with capital 
punishment as an institution and its interrelationships 
with other institutions, I am also concerned with the 
value system within which it operates and therefore 
interested in opinions, which are value statements, 
regarding it. As an observer then, without initial judg- 
ment concerning capital punishment itself, I look at: 

(1) the common arguments for capital punishment; 

(2) the common arguments against capital punishment; 

(3) the nature of capital punishment. 

Only then am I in a position to assess and interpret 
the role of the institution in our society and determine 
just how far it affects the lives of every one of us in 
that society. 

The arguments for capital punishment: 

1 . It is a deterrent 

2. It prevents recurrence 

3. It is a moral duty 

4. It is more economical than life imprisonment 

5. It is kinder than life imprisonment 

6. Those sentenced to death are only the worst 
offenders and are beyond rehabilitation 

7. Those sentenced to death are beyond humanity and 
therefore deserve no consideration as such (a 
counterargument to &quot;cruel and unusual punish- 
ment&quot;) 

8. &quot;We don&apos;t know what else to do, and we have to do 
something,&quot; an argument first stated to me by a 
prominent judge who, as a lawyer, had successfully 
won the restoration of the death penalty in one 
state, yet was willing to concede all arguments 
except this one. 

The arguments against capital punishment: 

1. It is not a deterrent. Here again it is necessary to 
stress that the best-informed opinion within the 
legal system is, at best, divided, since the argument 
is as impossible of proof as it is of disproof. Every 
murder committed where subject to the death 



55 



penalty is positive proof that in that case the penalty 
was not a deterrent. Clinton Duffy, who as warden 
of San Quentin witnessed ninety executions and 
dealt with many of the most hardened criminals in 
the country, said of the death penalty, &quot;It is not a 
deterrent to crime .... I have yet to meet the 
man who let the thought of the gas chamber stop 
him from committing murder.&quot; Hard data sup- 
port this view. There has been a slightly higher 
murder rate in some states having a death penalty. 
The abolition or introduction of the penalty does 
not make any significant difference in the rate of 
commission of capital crimes; in any case, such 
fluctuation can only be assessed in relationship to 
other considerations as well, such as a changing 
social context. The only valid rational verdict on 
deterrence, then, is &quot;not proved.&quot; 

2. It does not necessarily prevent recurrence. The only 
validity of the &quot;prevention&quot; argument for the death 
penalty is that in killing a murderer we prevent the 
possibility of that one man murdering again. Of the 
more than four hundred men and women on death 
row at this moment or of the thousands executed in 
this country recently (about four thousand in the 
last forty years) few had committed more than one 
murder or showed evidence they were likely to do 
so. The great majority were crimes of the passion of 
a single moment, and although such people need to 
be restrained, confinement would do that as well as 
execution and would seem more appropriate. 

3. It is not a moral duty. Those who try to justify cap- 
ital punishment on moral grounds can only cite 
ancient Hebraic law (&quot;Eye for eye. . . .&quot;) which, in 
itself, is susceptible to different interpretations and 
was in any case applicable in a totally different con- 
text some two thousand years ago. Further, the 
major churches have argued strongly against cap- 
ital punishment. The significant discrepancy be- 
tween church leadership and the extent to which it 
is followed by nominal adherents has to be ex- 
plained, and the explanation is probably that the 
churches, no more than other anti-capital punish- 
ment bodies, have failed to come up with an effec- 
tive alternative or even with effective arguments 
other than a direct moral commitment. 

4. It is not more economical, necessarily, to execute 
a criminal than to keep him in confinement for life. 
The cost to the state of a capital offense trial and of 
all the subsequent appeals is exorbitant, as is the 
added cost of maintaining a prisoner on death row 
for what might be many years of appeal. Summary 
execution would of course reduce that cost and 
would add something to the possibility of the 
penalty acting as a deterrent, but is unacceptable 
under our present concept of justice and due proc- 
ess. For those unwilling to accept that anyone in 



authority would consider mere economics in an 
issue of such gravity, I cite the recent case where 
the warden of a state penitentiary asked for legaliza- 
tion of lethal injection as a means of execution be- 
cause it would cost only one dollar per head! 
Against that kind of thinking there is no refutation. 

5. It is not &quot;kinder&quot; than keeping a man in prison for 
life unless prison conditions are admittedly in- 
humane. In any case, it is inconsistent to invoke 
&quot;kindness&quot; in this one respect, yet ignore it when 
it comes to consideration of the extreme depriva- 
tion, physical and psychological, under which pris- 
oners live on death row. There might be an argu- 
ment for giving a choice, but that would be legaliz- 
ing suicide in the same sense that execution legal- 
izes murder. 

6. It has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed by 
prison officials that those sentenced to die are not 
beyond rehabilitation. Faced with this extreme 
crisis, many prisoners often reflect on life and 
sociality in a way they might never have done other- 
wise. In cases where such men have had their sen- 
tence commuted they sometimes become model 
prisoners and form a constructive and stable ele- 
ment of the general prison population. It is almost 
as though, by accident, we have discovered the 
secret of rehabilitation, in rather a drastic way. 
Such data might be of the greatest significance in 
the wider area of prison reform and rehabilitation. 
Murderers and other prisoners I have talked with 
frequently express a deep frustration at being denied 
the possibility of making effective atonement. 
Punishment alone is not atonement. 

7. The experience of prison wardens alone demon- 
strates that convicted murderers may, at least, have 
human potential. That is a negative way of stating 
the issue, which is of much greater significance. I 
refer to the concept of justice found in most primi- 
tive societies, where an offender is judged not only 
for that offense but also for his positive attributes. 
Even a murderer, after all, might be a good father, 
an admirable husband, a cooperative and produc- 
tive craftsman, and a devoutly religious person. 
In executing that part of him that is &quot;bad&quot; we 
also execute the good. Even if that had to be so, 
then should we not continue to grant the condemned 
person the right to be treated as a human being until 
the moment of his death, and give him the oppor- 
tunity to prepare for and meet his death with the 
decency and dignity our law demands for all human 
beings? 

8. We may not know what else to do, but there is no 
way that we can demonstrate that nothing else can 
be done. We have examples of alternatives even 
within our own country, let alone in foreign coun- 
tries that have completely abandoned the death

penalty. We cannot declare that an equally eflFective 
solution to murder is impossible, since one cannot 
logically deny the existence of that which is not 
known. If successful alternatives have been found 
in other societies and if we value the sanctity of all 
human life, even that of humans who have com- 
mitted crimes, then we are logically bound to search 
for such alternatives. Regrettably, it is both easier 



and cheaper not to do so, and this places in question 

whether our stated human values are any longer 

valid. Such a quest for an alternative is within our 

intellectual ability and our financial capability; it is 

merely a matter of choice and will. 

While the above constitute refutations of arguments 

in support of capital punishment, opponents of capital 

punishment have two irrefutable arguments. The first

is the possibility of mistai&lt;e. We know that innocent 
victims have been executed; fortunately, others con- 
demned to death have been found innocent prior to 
execution. And we have to face the very real possibility 
that other mistakes have never been discovered be- 
cause following execution, the incentive for costly 
investigation to prove innocence is largely gone; in 
nearly all instances the cases of those who maintained 



their innocence until the moment of death are dropped 
at that time. 

The other irrefutable argument against capital pun- 
ishment is the existence of two prime factors — caprice 
and selectivity — that effectively determine who shall 
die and who shall not. Let me cite three of the most 
obvious demonstrations of this process at work. The 
proportion of black Americans on death row is totally 




,0? W- 9^-^.^- 



59 



inconsistent not only with their numbers in relation to 
the total population but with the numbers of all con- 
victed murderers, black or white. Furthermore, al- 
though more than half the murder victims in the United 
States are black. Dr. Riedel, of the University of Penn- 
sylvania, has shown that in 87 percent of the cases 
where the death penalty was given, the victim was 
white. And there is virtually a total absence of persons 
of any wealth, even moderate, on death row. The 
penalty clearly selects poor and black, those least able 
to afford the expert defense such a charge necessitates 
and whose guilt is most likely to be accepted without 
protest by the general public. Finally the death penalty 
discriminates heavily against males. Few women have 
faced a capital charge, and fewer still have been exe- 
cuted. 

The nature of capital punishment 

Even in description the approach of anthropology is 
dual — or should be. As a science it looks for organiza- 
tion, structure, consistency; it is involved with the 
total dynamics. As a humanity it is concerned with 
values and with people. In this latter respect we have 
to deal with whether capital punishment is cruel and 
unusual. One might think that this issue is the province 
of lawyers, and to some extent it is, but their proper 
concern is legality rather than humanity. And their dis- 
cussion as to whether the nature of capital punishment 
is cruel and unusual invariably ends in a split vote. 
Note that a majority of one is all that is required for a 
decision, and it is on such an evenly divided opinion 
that the lives of people now awaiting execution depend. 
What firm of engineers would accept such a close 
margin of opinion on the stress factor in their construc- 
tion of a bridge or building? What firm of stockbrokers 
would accept such a basis for undertaking a major 
financial enterprise? It is not the lawyers who are to 
blame, still less the prison officials who have to imple- 
ment the law. It is those who make the law, and in a 
democracy that means the general public. One might 
hope that religious leaders, if they felt deeply enough 
that this was an issue of moral significance, would be 
more active in oflFering guidance to the public. But the 
responsibility still lies with the people, and either the 
people are apathetic or else they often act blindly out 
of an ignorance of the facts, which are difficult to 
reach. When we consider the issue of humanity then, 
let us be clear that we do so not out of misguided 
sympathy for the criminal alone but out of concern for 
all those touched by the crime — which means all of us. 

But one last caution before I describe death row, 
before we look at the actual process. The word cruel, 
as in cruel and unusual punishment, is a dangerous 
red herring, for it implies motivation, intent. We are 
safer to focus on humanity and inhumanity, each of us 
defining these words in light of our own beliefs, but 



also in light of the ideals of civilization. For instance, 
one would think it undeniably cruel to execute a man 
following one or more previous attempts that had been 
thwarted by failure of the equipment. There is a com- 
mon belief that in such an event the condemned 
person&apos;s life is spared. Not at all. Here again, caprice, 
the caprice of commutation, comes in, and no rules 
have been established to guide such a decision, which 
then rests on whim. Willie Francis did not die at his 
first scheduled execution because the electric chair 
failed. There was an outcry against a second attempt. 
Learned arguments showed that no cruelty was in- 
volved since there was no intent nor, presumably, was 
it unusual since it is the inherent nature of mechanical 
equipment to fail. The next time the mechanical equip- 
ment did not fail. One of the first men to be electro- 
cuted in New York State (the first state to use elec- 
tricity) was being buried when he returned to life. He 
was brought back and electrocuted more successfully. 
The very first man executed in the new chair at Au- 
burn, New York, was pronounced dead after seventeen 
seconds, but he then showed signs of life and more cur- 
rent was applied. This was regrettable because the 
prolonged charge caused the flesh to burn and one 
argument for the new device had been that it was so 
quick it would not mar the body. It still burns the flesh 
and several charges are still necessary before death 
occurs. 

The technology 

The technology used for execution today is, to say 
the least, far below our technological capability. This 
is not a gratuitous swipe at technology or at the system. 
It is an observation of fact. In none of the four lawful 
modes of execution, not counting the yet unused drug 
now being legalized in a few states, is death instanta- 
neous. In all, the body is mutilated, least so in the gas 
chamber, where about seven minutes elapse before the 
outside stethoscope registers cessation of heartbeat. 
We are not sure at just what point consciousness is 
lost, just when the incredible pain ceases. We have 
nearly all suflFered from minor electrical shock, a mere 
110 volts as against 2,300; or from smoke inhalation 
if only from an unwilling log fire; or from mild asphyx- 
iation when momentarily we choke on some morsel 
of food. None of those sensations is pleasant. When a 
man or woman is hanged, death occurs after eight to 
ten minutes. In hanging, death is rarely caused by the 
breaking of the neck; medical evidence indicates quite 
the contrary, strangulation causes death. Warden 
Clinton DuflFy reveals that when a body is cut down 
and the mask is removed, &quot;the side of the face has 
been torn open in more cases than not.&quot; He also re- 
ports that even after the doctor has certified death, the 
body is left hanging for another ten or fifteen minutes, 
just in case. The same method was used in England, 



60 



where the most careful studies had been made on how 
best to achieve death through hanging. Before the im- 
portance of the distance through which weight fails 
was recognized, a drop of six to eight inches was con- 
sidered adequate. Prior to that there had been discus- 
sion as to where the knot of the noose should be 
placed, and whether it should be drawn tightly (a knot 
pulled fairly tightly beneath the ear was thought to 
lessen the length and pain of strangulation). But then it 
was recognized that the longer drop was more effec- 
tive, and sometimes as much as eighteen inches was 
used. The problem that worried authorities then was 
that the head was often torn oflF, depending on the 
weight of the body. Eventually, just before the turn of 
the century, the Home Office set down a regular scale 
of drops calculated according to the weight of the vic- 
tim and allowing some latitude to the executioner; this 
was meant to insure that death was as rapid as possible 
without tearing the head off, plainly a gruesome sight 
for witnesses. So the victim strangled to death, but 
his head remained on his body. 

Shooting is probably quick enough, but it does dis- 
figure and death is not necessarily instantaneous. The 
gas chamber is usually the least disfiguring, if the slow- 
est; it effectively causes death by asphyxiation and 



there is no record that it ever failed. There is, however, 
a relatively long waiting period after the victim has 
been strapped into the chair. During this time he or she 
can hear the machinery being set in motion, the suction 
valves and vents at work, the introduction of acid gur- 
gling up into the basin beneath the chair, the movement 
of the levers that release the cyanide pellets, the drop 
of the pellet into the acid, and the subsequent hiss as 
the pellet dissolves and the gas is released. Only at the 
point that the gas reaches the lungs (and this depends 
on how long the victim holds his breath) does con- 
sciousness begin to fade. The only disfiguration is some 
discoloration of the face and marks made by the re- 
straining straps if the victim struggles. I do not know if 
earplugs are allowed to reduce the unpleasant sound 
effects; a blindfold or face covering is allowed, but 
elsewhere I have been told (in a prison that executes 
by electrocution) that no sedatives are allowed &quot;be- 
cause the criminal has to be fully aware of what is 
happening to him.&quot; 

Then why cover the face? Clinton Duffy suggests an 
answer. In many cases, the witnesses who by law must 
be present, as well as the officials (perhaps as many as 
thirteen or fourteen), become sick: some vomit, some 
pass out, and the sight of what happens to the face 



If we inform ourselves 
about the reality,

to live with it.

would be too much to bear. He explains that witnesses 
to a hanging are dismissed after the drop, before the 
victim is cut down and the hood removed, revealing the 
torn face. (Some medical authorities say that such tear- 
ing should not take place, but that following death by 
strangulation there is considerable concentration of 
blood at the surface, and given the angle of the head 
with the noose clinched up behind the left ear, this gross 
discoloration will appear on one side of the face.) 

However, the worst results obtain with electrocution. 
Originally a verb was coined and it was said that a crim- 
inal was &quot;Westinghoused,&quot; since it was Westinghouse 
equipment that won the battle of Auburn (a battle be- 
tween rival commercial interests) and was first used 
there, on August 6, 1890. The first equipment I saw 
had the uncomfortably familiar name General Electric 
inscribed attractively across the case. I have not felt 
the same about any electrical equipment since, but 
someone has to build the machinery, and it is built to 
the very best specifications. Twenty-three hundred 
volts, or thereabouts, is generally prescribed, adminis- 
tered in alternation with charges of up to 1 ,000 volts in 
some cases. After eight cycles of 2,250 volts followed 
by 1 ,000 volts, a total of two minutes electrocution, the 
heart may not have stopped, and further cycles may 
have to be administered. Even if one two-minute cycle 
proves adequate, there may be considerable burning, 
causing both smoke and the smell of burning flesh. For 
this reason, the death rooms I have seen have the 
witness boxes glassed in so that at least the smell does 
not penetrate. However, sound may be piped in, so 
that the witnesses hear all that is going on, and not all 
victims go to their death quickly and without protest, 
for this incredibly inefficient technology demands pro- 
tracted preparation of the victim, even in the chair. 
Prior to that the head is shaved to insure good contact, 
so are other parts of the body to which contacts have 
to be applied, most often one leg (contacts on both legs 
can short across, causing even more burning). Then the 
victim is strapped tightly into the chair: legs, arms, 
chest, and head. A brine solution must be applied, al- 
though there is some disagreement about this — it re- 
duces burning but some say that it also reduces the 
efficiency that would be achieved by direct metal to 
skin contact. Next, the execution order is read, last 
words solicited, and with everything ready, the equip- 
ment is tested, which involves the victim hearing the 
opening and closing of the electrical contacts and 
switches and the hum of the generator. Only then is the 
current transferred from the test circuit to the chair, 
and the two-minute death dance begins. The head is 
held rigidly by a leather cap and chin strap; the eyes, 
which may come out of their sockets, are masked. 
Urine, inevitably, is released. One chair, in a prison I 
visited, has a cunningly devised hinged back, with a 
wedge placed at the opening at the top, so that as the 



62 



victim&apos;s body strains at the straps, the wedge slips 
down keeping them tight throughout. 

When the body is removed it is frozen in a grotesque 
position and is taken to what is known in one prison as 
&quot;the sandbag room,&quot; where it is straightened so that it 
can be fitted into a coffin. The more progressive pris- 
ons — or those that can aflFord the improvement — have 
an exhaust vent above the chair to remove as much of 
the smell as possible. In the case of multiple executions, 
this is of little comfort to the next in line since the smell 
of burning flesh is singularly pervasive. Nor of course is 
it of much comfort to prison officials who have to be 
around the chair or to witnesses where there is no odor- 
proof witness room. The sight and sound alone are 
enough to threaten one&apos;s sanity. 

Let me say here that I have not witnessed an electro- 
cution. But I have spoken at length with those who 
have and with those who are waiting to die and who 
know every detail I have described and more. I have 
seen two men hanged. And I have been on a dank base- 
ment death row where the cells in which condemned 
men wait to be put to death back directly onto the death 
chamber, separated by one thin wall. There are two 
corridors, one at each end of that death row, and both 
connect with the death chamber. There is no ventila- 
tion. Prospective candidates for electrocution can see 
the chair during their incarceration; in fact, such an 
opportunity is sometimes oflFered by kindly authorities. 
There is no way that the smell and sound cannot per- 
meate that death row, and on a damp day the smell is 
rank, even if there has not been an execution for 
months — some say years. When I was last there, it had 
all been freshly painted in readiness for the next execu- 
tion, so all one could smell was paint, and hopelessness. 

Once every two weeks, into that basement, came 
the executioner (usually the captain of the guard, but 
in some states, an unknown, hooded outside volun- 
teer). As described by every inmate I interviewed, the 
procedure was for the executioner to first walk through 
death row itself, which was not at all necessary for he 
could have passed directly into the death chamber. 
But he wanted to be seen. He would talk to a prisoner 
but never look him in the eyes. Then he went about 
his task, testing the equipment. One inmate lived 
fourteen years, another ten years, others for seven 
and eight years knowing what was waiting for them. 
Every two weeks they heard the throwing of switches, 
the whine of the generator, fluctuating from a dull, 
low hum to a high-pitched squeal. (One of these 
men I know had three times been served his ritual 
&quot;last supper,&quot; had had his head shaved three times. 
Now, with his sentence commuted owing to one of the 
many technical fluctuations in the on/off game, he 
keeps his head shaved at all times.) The inmates could 
hear &quot;Mad Jack,&quot; as they called the executioner, 
clump out of the chamber, into the dark alleyway and 



i

telling arguments against capital punishment.

64 



up the steps that led into the sunlight of the main yard, 
with its green lawns and flowerbeds. Mad Jack was 
eventually hospitalized and forced into early retire- 
ment. Guards, who merely have to sit at one end of 
death row and, with the prisoners, wait, become alco- 
holics. Divorce is common among guards. Like the 
inmates, they see individuals led out one morning, 
sometimes from pools of vomit, urine, and feces, con- 
trol over which has been lost through fear. At such 
times, some guards exhort the condemned to &quot;take his 
medicine like a man,&quot; although until then they referred 
to him only as an animal. They hear the screams of 
protest (or the whines of sobbing or the silence), hear 
the generators start their song, and then smell that 
smell. (Incidentally, lights do not dim all over the 
prison these days, in most cases the electric chair is on 
a separate circuit.) 

All this horror, a result of the technology, is surely 
one of the most telling arguments against capital pun- 
ishment, for the strain and stress, the alcoholism, 
broken families, and mental breakdown reach out be- 
yond the confines of the prison. So does the brutaliza- 
tion that mars the lives not only of inmates but of all 
those touched by the death penalty, the same brutaliza- 
tion that enables me to write this account in the comfort 
of my home, while good and kindly friends, whom I 
have come to know and respect, wait to sit in that 
chair. If we inform ourselves about the reality, then we 
have to live with it, and the only way to do that is either 
to suffer or to steel ourselves against it, a hardening 
process that makes us that much less human. I have 
met judges and wardens and lawyers who have not 
been able to sleep, even though they claim to believe 
in the death penalty. And I have lunched with guards 
almost above the death chamber and heard them say 
how they look forward to the next execution, how they 
will enjoy the smell of burning flesh. If this is not in- 
humanity, I do not know what is. So much for our 
value of &quot;compassion.&quot; 

There is more — so much more — but this has to be 
enough. What sense does capital punishment make? It 
exists in this particular form and therefore, the anthro- 
pologist says it is likely to have reason, to make sense, 
somehow to be necessary for the survival of our so- 
ciety. Perhaps so, but I refuse to admit there is no 
alternative, for that would be to admit there is an end 
to humanity. I think back to the final reasoning of the 
judge who successfully fought to have the death 
penalty reinstated: What else can we do? 

There is a desperate situation. Murder seems to have 
almost become a pastime. We all want to feel safe on 
the streets, safe in our homes. We are not in authority, 
so we have the right to demand of those who are that 
&quot;something be done.&quot; I have just described what they 
do. The deliberate taking of human life is sensational, 
perhaps the most dramatic act that can be performed, 



total and irrevocable. It is permeated with religious 
and ritual elements: the last supper, the gowned and 
hooded executioner in one state; in another, the com- 
pulsory walk down &quot;the last mile&quot; (in this case, an 
outside corridor, actually only a few yards long, during 
which the condemned person is commanded to look 
upward and see the sky above for the last time); the 
formal reading of the death warrant; the presence of a 
congregation of witnesses. An anthropological study 
could be done of the ritual elements alone. 

We need to break many more barriers, to get much 
more information through free and frank interviews 
with all concerned before we can attempt any signifi- 
cant analysis. That I, an academic, was given such 
free access to prisons in the states of Virginia, Georgia, 
Florida, and California is evidence of concern on the 
part of correctional authorities. But one clue, for me, 
lies in this ritual element, which is the only way that 
all the horror, an essential part of the institution, 
makes sense. It then appears in the nature of a sacri- 
fice, but one that is not truly public. This dramatic, 
awesome ritual offering, is made precisely at a time 
when we have no other recourse, when we do not 
know what else to do. At such a time, in primitive 
society, the gods are invoked. When man recognizes 
his impotence, he falls back on the unknown. Then 
even caprice makes sense, and the execution of inno- 
cent people becomes immaterial from a functionalist 
point of view (although never, I hope, from a human, 
moral point of view). For all that is demanded is a 
token, a ritual sacrifice. 

All other considerations aside, our system is su- 
premely inefficient. We are only accomplishing the dis- 
posal of a number of human beings, many of whom are 
perfectly good people who may have, in a moment of 
passion, committed a single crime; some may even be 
totally innocent. We do this in a way that is singularly 
barbaric, enormously expensive to the public at large, 
and more particularly, detrimental to the mental and 
physical health of all those involved. And while we do 
all this in the name of society at large, the focus is kept 
firmly on the individual crime and the individual crimi- 
nal, who is disposed of without any opportunity for 
atonement. If the entire process were more public; in- 
deed if judge and jurors were compelled to participate 
in the execution, and if their attention as well as the 
attention and concern of the rest of society were fo- 
cused on the need for goodness in society instead of the 
mere sordid destruction of one individual, then perhaps 
something might be accomplished by capital punish- 
ment. 

But if we were that concerned with the well-being of 
society, there would be little or no need for capital 
punishment in the first place. Meanwhile it persists 
merely to provide the public with the illusion that 
something is being done. 



65 



The alternatives 

One of our often stated values is progress, and in 
both the prevention of crime and our manner of deahng 
with criminals, it is difficult to find much evidence of 
progress. Each step we take seems to be countered by 
a step on the other side. 

A cross-cultural perspective points up possibilities, 
some of which are being incorporated into the more ad- 
vanced thinking within our jural and penal systems. 
Most such studies, however, deal with small-scale 
societies, and the transfer of concepts from one con- 
text to the other is not easy; they serve better as indi- 
cators, prompting us to ask the right questions about 
our own system. For instance, in most such societies 
there is the total absence of anything corresponding to 
our police force and little that corresponds to our legal 
system. Yet there is order and justice in measure that 
we could envy. Two important diiferences should be 
noted. The first is that the focus is not on the nature of 
the act, be it murder, theft, adultery, or whatever, so 
much as on the social implications of the act. Hearings 
(rather than &quot;trials&quot;) involve consideration of motiva- 
tion and social result; the welfare of the society at 
large, rather than that of the individual, is being con- 
sidered. Thus while any of those acts is normally 
&quot;wrong,&quot; there is always the question of degree. With 
us, extenuating circumstances are secondary; else- 
where they are primary and &quot;sentencing&quot; is corre- 
spondingly focused on the welfare of society. Under 
our legal system it is focused more on the crime itself 
and on an appropriate penalty. Although we give the 
name Department of Corrections or Department of Re- 
habilitation to constituted bodies, they serve rather to 
punish. Elsewhere judgment serves society by empha- 
sizing restitution rather than retribution. A thief is 
made to work until he has restored the value of what he 
has stolen or destroyed. A murderer cannot restore the 
life of the individual, but with the focus on social impli- 
cation, that is not primary; what is primary and pos- 
sible is that he fulfill the social obligations of the person 
he has killed. If he has killed a married man with a 
family, he must in some way care for the wife and the 
children, and this may even go as far as his being 
adopted into that family as a server — an institution 
sometimes mistaken for slavery. At the same time the 
public is made aware of the individual&apos;s potential for 
murder, so that appropriate caution may be exercised 
or restraints imposed. Sometimes a second oflFense is 
met by the death penalty. 

In the United States a few states have actually im- 
plemented comparable programs with restitution as 
the goal. In Minnesota such a program was shown to 
produce, among other benefits, a lower rate of recidi- 
vism, according to a study made by the National Coun- 
cil on Crime and Delinquency. The same source cites 
another program in California where offenders are 



required to work for their victims (or for the com- 
munity) in lieu of a jail sentence, thus not only vastly 
reducing the cost to the state but also providing ma- 
terial assistance where needed. And in a similar pro- 
gram in Michigan involving less than a hundred of- 
fenders, the state saved some $400,000. The rate of 
recidivism is always lower, a much more significant 
benefit in the long run. So far, these and the more 
common work-release programs found elsewhere are 
for lesser felonies, but they all suggest a major area of 
exploration in our search for alternatives to the death 
penalty. For some time, life imprisonment has been an 
accepted alternative. The common objections were 
that it cost too much and was not a severe enough 
punishment. 

Among those in authority there is a widespread de- 
sire to improve conditions, to implement well-tested 
programs such as those outlined above and, for crim- 
inals who cannot be safely returned to the outside 
world, to provide opportunities within prisons for gain- 
ful employment at union wages. From those wages, 
however, deductions would be made for board and 
lodging, for restitution to victims and/or their families, 
and for maintenance of the offender&apos;s family, removing 
them from welfare. This would not only save enormous 
sums of money, but would also provide those condi- 
tions that would make for more effective rehabilitation. 
There is no question of making such prisons into 
hotels. Those who voice this complaint know little 
or nothing about life in confinement and little or noth- 
ing about criminals. For if we expect them ever to be 
fit to return to society, their conditions of confinement 
must be consistent with our concept of humanity. This 
means, at the very least, allowing the prisoner the 
respect and dignity due all human beings. 

Ultimately, we are forced to face that gut-level ques- 
tion that contributes to the highly emotional nature of 
most discussions of capital punishment. Is the mur- 
derer human or has he in a sense resigned from the 
human race and thus deserving of no human con- 
sideration? To answer this question, we have to face, 
without flinching, the grim realities of all that is 
involved in the death penalty; to recognize that it is not 
merely the criminal we are considering, it is all those 
others, and finally, ourselves. And until we face the 
harsh facts of what happens on death row and in the 
execution room, in the witness room and in the offices 
and homes of prison officials, lawyers, and judges, we 
are not entitled to have an opinion and call it reasonable 
or just.

The Fierce and Fatherly 
Siamese Fighting Fish 



Ounce for ounce, a male Siamese 
fighting fish has to be one of the 
most pugnacious coldblooded ver- 
tebrates known. Strongly terri- 
torial, he will attack an intruding 
male, a female in his vicinity under 
the wrong circumstances, and his 
own reflection. With fins outspread, 
body taut, and gill membranes ex- 
panded like the hackles of an en- 
raged rooster, this roughly 1%-inch- 
long carnivore will nip and bite 
until his adversary beats a retreat or 
exhaustion forces a temporary 
break in the engagement. Such fe- 
rocity is related to the breeding 
strategy of this species, in which 
the male has exclusive responsibil- 
ity for raising the young. Somewhat 
paradoxically, a key element of the 
paternal duties is diligent and deli- 
cate handling of the hatchlings. 

The Siamese fighting fish, Betta 
splendens, lives in ponds and small, 
sluggish streams, canals, and 
ditches throughout much of Thai- 
land and eastern Kampuchea (Cam- 
bodia). Unable to obtain suflRcient 
oxygen through its gills, and thus 
dependent on atmospheric air for 
survival, the fish periodically rises 
to the surface, expels a bubble of 
impure air, and gulps a fresh mouth- 
ful, which is utilized through an 
auxiliary respiratory apparatus. 

In the male, bubble blowing 
serves as more than a way of rid- 
ding himself of bad air. A mucous 
secretion strengthens the walls of 
the bubbles, giving them a longer 
life and keeping them in a relatively 



compact mass that is the basis of the 
bubble nest constructed by the male 
at the time of breeding. 

The fish spawn at all times of the 
year. If the male accepts an ap- 
proaching egg-laden female into his 
territory, an intricate courtship and 
breeding ritual follows. Resplend- 
ent in the bright colors that were 
triggered by the process of estab- 
lishing a territory, building a nest, 
and accepting a mate, the male 
curves his body into a C shape into 
which the drabber female snuggles. 
Stimulated by the embrace, she 
releases from 400 to 500 eggs over a 
period of several hours. 

The partners swim after the 
downward-drifting eggs, catching 
them in their mouths. Each egg is 
carried to the nest floating on the 
surface and then spit into the mass 
of bubbles. The female&apos;s role in 
breeding ends at this point, and she 
is chased away by the male, who 
maintains a constant guard over the 
rapidly developing eggs. 

After hatching, the young huddle 
under the remnants of the bubble 
nest for safety. Those unable to 
maintain their position are retrieved 
by the watchful male, who feeds 
actively during this time but, unHke 
many other fishes, refrains from 
making a meal of his offspring. He 
has ample opportunity to do so 
because not only are the fry fairly 
stationary in their sanctuary, but 
the male repeatedly takes them into 
his mouth and then blows them out 
accompanied by new bubbles. This 



seems to insure that the hatchlings 
receive sufficient oxygen and also 
repairs rents in the nest. 

The young live for a few days on 
the nourishment provided by ab- 
sorption of their yolk sacs, followed 
by a period of ten to twelve days 
during which they prey on micro- 
scopic crustaceans. They are then 
developed enough to begin a life of 
voracious predation on mosquito 
larvae. 

The fish have been kept in cap- 
tivity in Southeast Asia for hun- 
dreds of years, not for their poten- 
tial use in mosquito control, but for 
their ferociousness. Thais and 
Cambodians have selected strains 
of Siamese fighting fish for aggres- 
siveness and stamina. These short- 
finned varieties are pitted against 
each other and will fight for hours 
until one of the combatants is van- 
quished. Wagering on the outcome 
is the name of the game, and the 
sport is so popular that some resi- 
dents of Bangkok make a living by 
raising mosquitoes. The larvae 
are sold as food to owners of fight- 
ing fish. 

Siamese fighting fish were intro- 
duced to Europe in the 1890s for 
the aquarium trade and reached the 
United States a few years later. 
Fish fanciers on the two continents 
have concentrated on developing 
strains with a brilliant variety of 
colors and long, crepelike fins. The 
photographs on the following pages 
demonstrate their success.

Stationed beneath the bubble 
nest he has assembled, a 
brightly colored and highly 
territorial male is approached 
from below by a diiller-hiied 
female who is ready to spawn. 



Accepting her as a mate, the male 
bends into a C shape. The female 
slips into the curve of his body, and 
they begin their mating embrace. 



Stimulated by the contact, the 
female releases the first batch of 
400 to 500 eggs, which are 
fertilized by the male&apos;s milt. 




Unwrapping himself from 
the embrace, the male chases 
the eggs, which are drifting 
toward the bottom. 



The female is still releasing eggs 
as the male busily gathers them 
up in his mouth one at a time 
and transports them to the nest. 



The male spits an egg into the 
nest as his mate chases after 
others still loose in the water. 
When all the eggs are in plape 
he will chase her away. Hours 
later, right, the male mouths the 
developing fry, forms new bubbles 
around them to insure that they 
are sufficiently oxygenated, and 
repositions them in the nest.

George Edwards: 
Depictor of ^^Nondescripts 

A leading zoological illustrator of the eighteenth century 
won acclaim for his keen observation, remarkable 
fidelity, and publishing firsts. Oblivion followed 

by Sarah Blaffer Hrdy

&quot;// is exceeding hard to discover 
what Truth is in a World of 
Falsehood and Controversy, where 
all of us suck in Error with our 
Milk. Is not the great Part of the 
World taught to believe, that their 



Senses are Lyars? . . . but it is 
a fixed and firm Article of my 
private Faith, that God hath given 
us our Senses as a Touchstone of 
Truth and that whatever Writing, 
Tradition, or bold Assertion, 



advances any Opinion, that 
directly and flatly contradict the 
Senses, which God hath given us 
to judge by, are absolute False- 
hoods and ought to be rejected by 
all Mankind.&quot; 




The Little Indian King-Fishers (Indian small blue kingfisher) 



In these words, one of the fore- 
most zoological illustrators of his 
day, George Edwards, summed up 
his personal philosophy. A small- 
town English boy who was only 
serendipitously led to a career in 
zoology, Edwards believed that we 
are reared ingesting falsehood right 
along with our mother&apos;s milk. For a 
period that spanned the greater part 
of the eighteenth century, he did his 
best to remedy the situation by pro- 
ducing illustrations so accurate and 
handsome that his contemporary 
Linnaeus referred to them as &quot;an 
ornament to the age in which we 
live.&quot; In seven volumes published 
between 1743 and 1764, a host of 
animal species were described for 
the first time by eyes self-con- 
sciously free of misperceptions. In 
recompense for these labors — as 
Edwards himself foresaw — he 
gained almost total obscurity. 

Although Edwards had a large 
following during his lifetime, his 
contributions were quickly eclipsed 
by rapid advances in scientific illus- 
tration and taxonomic classifica- 
tion. In some cases, however, a 
century or more elapsed before Ed- 
wards&apos;s observations on the be- 
havior of various species could be 
confirmed by field biologists. By 
that time his name was long for- 
gotten and his work locked away in 
rare book rooms.

At the time of Edwards&apos;s birth, in 
1694, commerce was one of the few 
routes to advancement for a young 
person from a bacicground that to- 
day might be thought of as lower 
middle class. For seven years, the 
young George Edwards learned 
business in the home of a London 
merchant. Halfway through his ap- 
prenticeship, Edwards&apos;s life was 
profoundly altered by the happen- 
stance of where his bedroom was. 
An eminent physician, a relative of 
Edwards&apos;s master, died and be- 
queathed to the London tradesman 
a vast collection of books. These 
were stored in a spare room next to 
the bedroom assigned to Edwards, 
and for almost three years the 
young man spent all of his eve- 
nings — and sometimes the greater 
part of his nights— reading, with the 
result that he developed 

a very disadvantageous Tbrn of Mind, 
for I could not think of confining 
myself to Business, which probably 
would have raised my Fortune in the 
World. My Head was filled with a con- 
fused Mixture of Voyages, Travels, 
Astronomy, Experimental Philosophy, 
Natural History, Painting, Sculpture, 
and many other Things which gave me 
an Inclination to visit Foreign Parts, in 
order to convince my Senses of some 
Things, which yet had only been con- 
ceived by the Mind. 

When his apprenticeship expired 
in 1716, the twenty-two-year old 
gave up any hope of a commercial 
career in order to see the world. 
Between the years 1716 and 1720, 
a footloose Edwards visited Hol- 
land, Norway, and France, seizing 
every opportunity to inspect the 
foreign landscape, often at consid- 
erable risk. The countryside was 
rough and local inhabitants unac- 
customed to the idiosyncracies of 
bird watchers. In Norway, during 
Charles XII&apos;s siege of Friedrich- 
stadt, Edwards was captured by 
Danish soldiers who took him for a 
spy. He later adopted a beggar&apos;s 
disguise to escape the depredations 
of highwaymen. This innocent de- 
ception nearly backfired, however, 
when one of his field trips coincided 
with a French edict to secure all 
vagrants and ship them oiFto Amer- 
ica to help settle the Mississippi 
valley. Edwards narrowly escaped 
by pretending to comply, &quot;which 

he Maucauco (ring-tailed lemur) 



[later] gave me the Opportunity to 
give them the Slip.&quot; This escapade 
marked the end of his travels, since 
&quot;by dabbling a little in the Grand 
Game of Mississippi ... I was dis- 
abled from continuing so long in 
France as I designed.&quot; 

While traveling, Edwards made 
sketches of what he saw. Back in 
England, he devoted himself full 
time to a new career as an artist. He 
later wrote, &quot;I applied myself 
pretty close to drawing and colour- 
ing, and what principally pleased 
me was copying strictly after Na- 
ture; and amongst Natural Objects, 
Birds happened at first to fall most 
my Way, and getting a few Draw- 
ings of these together, raised in me 
an Ambition to obtain a Collection 
as great as was in my Power.&quot; He 
apparently sold enough drawings to 
support himself, although since he 
had no formal training, his first, 



self-taught efforts were probably 
fairly crude. Nevertheless, he grad- 
ually acquired a number of pro- 
moters. Among his early patrons 
was Sir Hans Sloane. physician- 
naturalist, president of the College 
of Physicians, and one of the great 
collectors of his day. 

In 1733 Sloane recommended Ed- 
wards for the position of librarian 
of the college, a post that he was 
to occupy throughout most of his 
long career. This post meant not 
only financial security and an apart- 
ment, but access to one of the finest 
natural history libraries of the day, 
and, perhaps most important, 
entree into the private collections of 
a privileged class obsessed with the 
assemblage of rare creatures. In 
Sloane&apos;s gardens alone, Edwards 
could observe at firsthand reindeer 
from Lapland browsing amid por- 
cupines and chipmunks, African

crested cranes, a wide variety of 
Chinese birds, and a wolverine from 
Canada that he was the first to draw 
and describe for publication. 

Exotic menageries and collec- 
tions of curiosities were de rigueur 
for any sophisticate who aspired to 
be a person of learning. Creatures 
from all over the British Empire 
could be found in the gardens of 
courtesans and socialites or as mas- 
cots behind the counter at local 
taverns and coffee houses. One of 
Edwards&apos;s loveliest drawings, of 
the zebra-striped hoopoe (Upupa 
epops), was made at Slater&apos;s coffee 
house in Chelsea. Sea captains and 
privateers returned to England with 
clinging and slithering cargoes, 
many earmarked for Edwards. A 
cage full of handsome yellow- 
headed linnets came to Edwards 
from a captured Spanish galleon. 



He again prospered from piracy 
when Capt. Laurence Shirley (later 
the fourth earl of Ferrers) captured 
from a French prize a number of 
birds intended for Madame Pompa- 
dour. 

The earliest records of zoological 
collections in far corners of the 
earth are often due to Edwards&apos;s 
scholarly habit of carefully noting 
the source and, when possible, the 
locale where collected for each of 
his specimens. Edwards kept a 
number of pets himself, including a 
colony of ring-tailed lemurs from 
Madagascar. He availed himself of 
a wide range of sources, some ex- 
otic and some closer to home. Dur- 
ing a particularly harsh London 
winter, for example, he found a wild 
swan on sale in the London Market, 
took it home, and drew it. 

The outrageous fashionability of 




The Hen Bustard (great bustard) 



collecting rare animals was a pro- 
fessional windfall for the man who 
strove to represent living creatures 
in fastidious detail and who prided 
himself on being the first to illus- 
trate members of a given species — 
to draw what he referred to as 
&quot;nondescripts.&quot; In 1743 Edwards 
published the first volume of his 
Natural History of Uncommon 
Birds, illustrating fifty-one species 
of birds and two mammals, many of 
which had never been described. 
Three more volumes followed be- 
tween 1747 and 1751. By the fourth 
volume. Edwards was feeling his 
fifty-seven years and wearily imag- 
ined that this would be his last. 
Considering it the most perfect of 
his productions on natural history, 
he dedicated it to God. 

Fortunately, Edwards&apos;s personal 
decision to close shop did not stem 
the flow of living, stuffed, and bot- 
tled creatures that were sent to him 
from all over the world by the ener- 
getic medley of aristocrats, pirates, 
hunters, amateur bird watchers, and 
fellow naturalists who had come to 
admire his work. To accommodate 
them, and in part to repay his sup- 
pliers, Edwards embarked on what 
he considered a miscellaneous 
series, the gorgeous three volumes 
entitled Gleanings of Natural His- 
tory, which were published between 
1758 and 1764. The volumes com- 
bined Edwards&apos;s drawings, descrip- 
tive texts, and essays on a variety 
of topics, including bird migrations, 
tidal waves, and recommendations 
on social policy. These essays were 
later combined and published as a 
single volume. After his death, a 
separate volume on the study of fos- 
sils was also published. 

In retrospect, several features of 
the Gleanings and the History of 
Uncommon Birds stand out on the 
landscape of British natural history 
in the eighteenth century. First, of 
course, was Edwards&apos;s conviction 
that &quot;what is well done after nature 
itself will always be valuable.&quot; 
Artistic method became the servant 
of his determination to describe his 
subjects with utmost accuracy. 
With pride, Edwards reminds read- 
ers that most of his subjects have 
been drawn either from life or from 
actual specimens. Body measure- 
ments and weights were included 

The Albatross (albatros

&quot;&apos;• ■■&quot;-- ■ 




The Gerbua (Egyptian jerboa)

in the text where possible. Almost 
all of the copper plates in Edwards&apos;s 
later work were etched by him, 
lessening the likelihood of error. 
Only four of the illustrations in the 
Gleanings were farmed out to hired 
engravers. To insure accurate de- 
piction of the subject&apos;s coloring, he 
provided a model drawing for each 
species and personally supervised 
the coloring of each print. In antici- 
pation of his death, his correctly 
colored models were deposited in 
the British Museum, in the Royal 
College of Physicians, and with his 
publisher, Robson, so that the orig- 
inals could be consulted in the pro- 
duction of subsequent editions of 
his work. 

Despite these precautions, Ed- 
wards could do little to insure ac- 
curacy among his imitators. While 
he drew from life, many others 
simply copied Edwards; some art- 
ists, such as the American painter- 
clergyman Jonathan Fisher, vir- 
tually built their artistic careers on 
the practice. The imitators ranged 
from such eminent figures as the 
French naturalist Buffon to a host 
of anonymous craftsmen who deco- 
rated the chinaware and fancy cloth 
of the day with Edwards&apos;s designs. 
The famous Chelsea Porcelain Fac- 
tory issued a whole series of figures 
based on Edwards&apos;s birds. Predict- 
ably, his chief grievance with such 
copies was that they were &quot;gen- 
erally so miserably lamed and dis- 
torted that the judicious Part of the 
World can form but a mean Opinion 
of the Work from which they are 
plounder&apos;d.&quot; 

The painstaking eiforts that Ed- 
wards made to insure accuracy in 
his own drawings and written de- 
scriptions, as well as his meticulous 
documentation of sources, made 
him intolerant of naturalists with 
lower standards. Scarcely a page in 
the History of Uncommon Birds 
passes without some disparagement 
of his countryman Eleazer Albin. 
&quot;Albin on birds need not be exam- 
ined, seeing his figures [of the bus- 
tard] are copied from the Paris 
Academy, and his description from 
[the early British ornithologist] Wil- 
loughby.&quot; Although sensitive to the 
concept of priority, if a given spe- 
cies had been previously drawn by 
Albin, Edwards would sometimes 



continue to regard it as technically 
a &quot;nondescript&quot; because he found 
&quot;so much inaccuracy.&quot; 

For the American-based orni- 
thologist Mark Catesby — Ed- 
wards&apos;s close friend, provider of 
specimens, and the fellow artist 
who taught him how to etch draw- 
ings onto copper plates — Edwards 
reserved his highest praise: &quot;I 
should not have presumed to repub- 
lish anything that was directly the 
same with what has been published 
by Mr. Catesby, because I know 
myself to be not capable to add any 
Amendments to what he has done.&quot; 
Edwards also considered &quot;very 
useful&quot; the work of the French 
ornithologist Brisson, whose book, 
Ornithologie, was published in 
Paris in 1760. Even these favorites, 
however, did not completely escape 
critical appraisal. Edwards felt that 
&quot;as will happen to every Compiler 
that hath not long and carefully 
studied the Subjects he treats of,&quot; 
Brisson suflFered from &quot;frequent 
Repetitions of the same identical 
Species of Birds under different 
Names.&quot; His single criticism of 
Catesby was that his friend&apos;s lav- 
ishly illustrated coffee table produc- 
tions would be inaccessible to the 
ordinary reader. 

Edwards had an educator&apos;s con- 
cern for communicating accurate 
information to the general public. 
An unusually fine but &quot;very pom- 
pous&quot; natural history published in 
Amsterdam by Albertus Seba in 
1734 was largely dismissed by Ed- 
wards, who illustrated in his own 
works many species presented by 
Seba because he considered that 
this &quot;great and very expensive 
work&quot; was unlikely ever to be read 
by his countrymen. In the interest 
of accessibility, Edwards published 
all of his work in English and in- 
cluded in each volume the entire 
text translated into French. He did 
his own engraving to reduce the 
price of his work and insure accu- 
racy. Occasionally, because of the 
size of a subject, illustrations had 
to be greatly reduced. In these 
cases, Edwards would artfully in- 
clude as part of the composition 
an inset showing a life-sized claw 
or feather or a detail of the head or 
body. In the case of his rhinoceros, 
a small inset to the left of the body 



illustrates the fleur-de-lis shape of 
the animal&apos;s extruded penis. 

Also remarkable was Edwards&apos;s 
concern with the attributes and ad- 
aptations of animals that went be- 
yond typology. In addition to size, 
appearance, and detailed observa- 
tions on sexual dimorphism, he 
noted, wherever possible, the origin 
of his subjects, the habitats they 
lived in, their diets, behaviors, and 
temperaments. 

To Edwards must go the credit 
for such ethological coups as pub- 
lishing the first accounts of the 
origin of the extraordinary booming 
sound of the ruffed grouse, which 
the bird makes by beating its wings 
at high speed; of prey catching and 
meat eating among various prosim- 
ians and New World monkeys; and 
of paternal care of offspring among 
marmosets. Marmosets were com- 
mon in some European circles at 
this time, when the flutfier species 
of these miniature South American 
monkeys were worn as live adorn- 
ments to scurry in and out of billow- 
ing sleeves and bouffant hairdos. 

Edwards paid careful attention to 
what he saw and continually tested 
current notions against observa- 
tions of the natural world. In his 
short essay on the disappearance of 
birds in winter, for example, Ed- 
wards laid out three views current 
in the eighteenth century and 
weighed the evidence in favor of 
each. One hypothesis, dating back 
to Aristotle and Pliny, held that 
birds used their short legs and 
strong claws to spend the winter 
hanging upside down, clustered to- 
gether in mines and grottoes and in 
cliffs beside the sea. More widely 
held was the view that birds, and in 
particular swallows, retired under- 
water to sleep out the winter. Of 
this preposterous suggestion, Ed- 
wards wrote that it was &quot;at first 
Sight too amazing and unnatural to 
merit Mention, if it was not that 
some of the Learned have been 
credulous enough to deliver, for 
Fact, what has the strongest Ap- 
pearance of Impossibility.&quot; Ed- 
wards&apos;s main objection, which he 
considered conclusive, was the lack 
of any avian apparatus for breath- 
ing underwater. He discredited the 
first hypothesis, which &quot;would 
make Sleepers&quot; of birds, by point- 



79 



u^satSBSaUtSSS^m 



ing out that such hibernating birds 
were never encountered. 

Rejecting the first two hypothe- 
ses, Edwards leaned toward the 
third opinion, that migrating birds 
&quot;move nearer the Sun, where they 
can find a Continuance of their 
natural Diet, and a Temperature of 
Air suiting their Constitutions.&quot; He 
cited observations of European 
swallows to support this interpreta- 
tion. Proponents of the &quot;sleeper&quot; 
hypothesis had suggested that birds 
&quot;retire to Holes under Ground, hol- 
low Trees, etc.&quot; because they are 
&quot;so fat they cannot fly at the times 
they disappear.&quot; Edwards argued 
instead that such fatness was ac- 
tually &quot;a providential Provision to 
enable them to take a Flight of 
many Days without being quite 
exhausted and spent.&quot; 

I have long been puzzled by how 
this man — who to all appearances 
was utterly conventional — was able 
to look on the world with so fresh a 
vision. The only answer that has 
suggested itself to me is a curious 
one: Edwards&apos;s humility. So mod- 
est was this man about his own 
assumptions and education that he 
took almost nothing for granted 
except what he could see with his 
own eyes. This is not to say that 
Edwards underestimated his own 
worth or failed to recognize the high 
quality of his illustrations. His writ- 
ings contain realistic appraisals of 
his merits relative to those of his 
predecessors. Nevertheless, piety 
and humility pervade his writing: 

In the course of my works, I have 
generally had the advantage of working 
from real nature, many of my subjects 
being living and in high perfection, and 
others well preserved in order to be im- 
ported to us from foreign parts: and, if 
my figures fall short of nature, as they 
certainly must, it is not for want of care 
in me, or infinite difference between the 
Great Creator of natural productions, 
and the presumptuous weak creature, 
who dared to essay an imitation of the 
works of the Omnipotent. Sometimes, 
being for a moment thoughtless of the 
Great Source of nature, I have vainly 
fancied my faint imitations other works 
in some degree complete; but, on the 
least recollection, a slow, aweful, ma- 
jestic voice seemed to reprove me thus: 
Vain and presumptuous wretch! dost 
thou imagine, thy faint endeavours can 
bear the least comparison with the 



works of Him that created thee and all 
things? 

In 1744 Edwards became a candi- 
date for election to the Royal Soci- 
ety, the most prestigious intellec- 
tual &quot;club&quot; of the day. The routine 
procedure was to read out loud the 
names of nominees at ten consecu- 
tive meetings before taking a vote. 
A week after he was nominated, 
Edwards inexplicably withdrew. 
We can only speculate as to the 
reasons. Perhaps he could not af- 
ford the dues. In a catalog detailing 
the natural history items sold from 
the estate of the late earl of Bute, a 
meticulous buyer wrote in sepia ink 
beside each purchase what was bid 
for it. As late as 1794, when the 
auction took place, an Edwards 
engraving could be bought for a 
shilling or two. My own hunch, 
however, was that Edwards did not 
feel himself worthy. Six years later 
Edwards was awarded the gold 
medal donated by Sir Godfrey Cop- 
ley, which the Royal Society pre- 
sented annually to the author of a 
new discovery in art or nature. A 
few years after that — perhaps con- 
vinced at last of his eligibility — he 
accepted election to the Society. 

Edwards&apos;s strong sense of per- 
sonal modesty was probably in- 
tensified by the social distance that 
separated him from his associates. 
He reminisces how, after his old 
patron and friend Sir Hans Sloane 
retired to his estate in Chelsea, &quot;he 
requested as a favor to him (though 
I embraced his request as an honour 
done to myself) that I would visit 
him every other week, in order to 
divert him for an hour or two, with 
the common news of the town . . . 
and news of the Royal Society.&quot; 
Edwards was in fact with Sloane 
the day he died. But despite their 
intimacy, barriers of class and re- 
membered patronage could never 
be completely erased. For each 
visit, Sloane carefully reimbursed 
his friend for his traveling expenses. 

Virtually no clues exist to tell us 
what Edwards himself thought of 
his social circumstances. Apart 
from the account of his early educa- 
tion and young manhood, he makes 
no mention of his family. Robson 
tells us that at his death of cancer at 
the age of eighty, Edwards, who 



never married, bequeathed his 
modest fortune to his two spinster 
sisters, who lived together. There 
are no hints in Edwards&apos;s record of 
any life beyond the one he de- 
scribes for us: a career spanning 
sixty years, singlemindedly dedi- 
cated to the accurate representation 
of the natural world. We are left to 
wonder what motivated such a 
man. Was he impelled by an obses- 
sion (as Edwards himself feared in 
moments of self-doubt), exalted by 
reverence for the Almighty&apos;s crea- 
tions (as he sometimes hoped), or 
did he modestly persevere in the 
diligent application of his talents 
simply because it was a contribu- 
tion he felt he could make? 

Whatever the motivation for his 
labors, its fruits are eloquently de- 
scribed for us by Linnaeus. Al- 
though the two never met, there 
was enormous mutual admiration 
between them. Linnaeus had some 
of Edwards&apos;s engravings on display 
in his study and used his descrip- 
tions to identify new species. Ed- 
wards, in turn, was one of the first 
naturalists in Britain to recognize 
the importance of Linnaeus&apos;s work. 
In later editions of Edwards&apos;s vol- 
umes, a list was appended by Lin- 
naeus giving the Latin names for all 
the species depicted. In a letter to 
his colleague, Linnaeus wrote, 
&quot;Nothing can more conduce to the 
advancement of solid natural 
knowledge than such beautiful and 
excellent figures, accompanied by 
such exact descriptions.&quot; In con- 
gratulating Edwards for &quot;the beau- 
tiful and innumerable rare birds, 
beyond what any other person has 
seen, or is likely to meet with ... in 
which nothing is wanting to the 
birds but their song,&quot; Linnaeus 
optimistically, and euphorically, 
predicted that &quot;even these will sing 
your praise, as long as birds or men 
endure.&quot; But, as usual, Edwards&apos;s 
own vision was more accurate than 
that of his contemporaries when he 
modestly ended the Preface to vol- 
ume one of his Gleanings of Natu- 
ral History by reserving judgment 
on what the fate of his work should 
be. &quot;I cannot pretend to judge,&quot; he 
wrote, &quot;but I submit it to the Crit- 
ics, Correctors, Reformers, Trans- 
lators, Regravers, and lastly to 
obscurity and utter oblivion.&quot; D

Pebbles Out in Space 



Asteroids are shown by new 
research to be rocky bodies, 
larger and darker than 
expected, and composed of 
several types of material 



The asteroids, or minor planets, 
are faint starlike objects that slowly 
traverse our night sky. They are 
small planetary bodies orbiting the 
sun between Mars and Jupiter in a 
ring referred to as the asteroid belt. 
Their nature was unknown right up 
to the early 1970s, but in the past 
five years powerful new methods 
have been applied to their study, re- 
vealing an astounding amount of 
new data. The asteroids are about 
30 percent larger than early esti- 
mates suggested, and the first de- 
tailed spectra have indicated at least 
half a dozen diflFerent surface rock 
types. A distinct trend in planet type 
is found on crossing the main aster- 
oid belt, and data from several dif- 
ferent investigations suggest that 
the belt has suffered many destruc- 
tive collisions during its history. 
The Trojan asteroids, which share 
the orbit of the planet Jupiter, are 
exceptionally dark bodies probably 
composed of primitive material of 
very great age. 

During the eighteenth century, a 
number of astronomers had noted 
and speculated about the apparent 
gap in the planetary system between 
Mars and Jupiter. Plans were afoot 
at the turn of that century to organ- 
ize visual searches for the missing 
planet but these were forestalled by 
the Italian mathematician and as- 
tronomer Guiseppe Piazzi. who 
discovered the first minor planet. 
1 Ceres, on January 1, 1801. The 
search group later added 2 Pallas, 



3 Juno, and 4 Vesta by 1807. A fifth 
minor planet was added in 1845 and 
300 were known by 1890. The intro- 
duction of photographic methods in 
1891 opened the floodgates and 
hundreds of faint asteroids were 
rapidly located. 

An asteroid is identified by its 
orbit. Once this is known accurately 
its position at any time in the past or 
future can be computed. Early com- 
putations involved lengthy and 
tedious work by hand and many 
asteroids were lost because of lim- 
ited computing capacity. Only the 
advent of the high-speed electronic 
computer in the past twenty years 
has enabled astronomers to keep 
track of all the bodies with well- 
determined orbits. After receiving 
a preliminary designation in order 
of discovery, asteroids are given a 
permanent number when their orbit 
is accurately known. The latest is 
minor planet 2,042, numbered at the 
end of 1977. Once numbered, the 
original discoverer then has the 
first option on naming the asteroid. 
In addition to the more than 2,000 
numbered asteroids, there are about 
2,000 others that have either been 
lost or have not yet had their orbits 
accurately determined. 

The bulk of the known minor 
planets, perhaps 95 percent, lie in 
the main belt and have periods of 
from two to six years. Their orbits 
are ellipses of low eccentricity, and 
the asteroids at the well-defined 
inner edge of the belt are strongly 
concentrated in the solar system 
plane. The scatter of the orbits, 
especially in inclination, increases 
on moving outward through the belt 
and the outer edge is rather diffuse. 

A survey by the McDonald Ob- 
servatory in Texas in 1958 obtained 
statistical data on asteroids brighter

than magnitude 16, and the Palomar- 
Leiden survey in 1970 extended this 
down to below magnitude 20. These 
surveys indicate that the total num- 
ber of minor planets brighter than 
magnitude 21.2, corresponding to a 
diameter of about one mile, is some 
480,000. The total mass involved 
here is about 0.0004 earth masses, 
or about twice the mass of the 
largest asteroid, 1 Ceres. That is 
rather a small total and explodes the 
myth that the minor planets are the 
fragments of a terrestrial-style 
planet that disintegrated. 

Distinct gaps occur in the fre- 
quency distribution of asteroid or- 
bit sizes. These Kirk wood gaps, 
named after their discoverer, occur 
at periods that are precise fractions 
of Jupiter&apos;s orbital period — so- 
called commensurabilities. The 
gaps are due to gravitational per- 
turbations by Jupiter, which recur 
repeatedly at the same orbit posi- 
tion for asteroids with commensu- 
rate periods. About ten such gaps 
have been swept clear by Jupiter. If 
the orbital elements of the minor 
planets are freed from the effects of 
long-term perturbations, then a 
number of distinct groupings of the 
orbits stand out. Called Hirayama 
families, these groups may each be 
the scattered fragments from a dis- 
ruptive collision between two large 
asteroids at some time in the past. 
Ten main families are recognized 
and a number of diffuse ones sus- 
pected. In all, about one-third of all 
known asteroids are members of 
such family groupings. 

With accurate orbits for so many 
asteroids available, a detailed 
model of the main belt can now be 
constructed. Are the minor planets 
mainly bits that have always existed 
much as they are now or are they

The Daffodil Mixture llial Is Beally a Mixture 
The Price ? Dinner for two plus JU5 wine . 



&apos;The Works&apos; is unique because it is made up only of 
fine named Daffodil varieties of recent origin, not a seed- 
ling in the lot. Each of these top-grade, double-nosed 
bulbs will bloom the first year. &apos;The Works&apos; has a long 
season of bloom because it contains all classes of Daf- 
fodils, except miniatures. And these classes are carefully 
balanced among Trumpets, which have yellow, golden, 
bi-color, or pink blossoms; Flatcups, in great variety, 
with flaring petals and heavily-ruffled flat cups; mem- 
bers of the Poetaz group, some of them doubles; Cy- 
clamineus Hybrids having shorter stems holding smaller 
flowers; and Triandrus Hybrids with clusters of bloom 
on each stalk. This is a delightfully informal way to 
naturalize Daffodils and it may amaze you to see so 
many kinds you&apos;ve never seen in bloom — unless you&apos;ve 
been to Holland. 

Daffodils, as you may know, are nearly indestructible 
perennials — they seem to last as long as Peonies, which 
is almost forever. A planting of Daffodils naturalized 
here 43 years ago still blooms gloriously, but is now 
more extensive, for the bulbs are great self-propaga- 
tors. Pick blooms for indoor bouquets. What more could 
one ask? 

You wouldn&apos;t expect a mixture of named-variety Daf- 
fodils, double-nosed, to sell for less than $36.00 a hun- 
dred, and it doesn&apos;t. But $36.00 is less than the price of 
other good mixtures. &apos;The Works&apos; is sold only by the 100 
(for 500 to one address deduct 5%; for 1,000 deduct 
10% ) . For prepaid handling and shipping charges 
please add 10% if east of the Mississippi, 15% to Gulf 
states and west of The River ( these bulbs weigh about 
20 lbs. per 100) . Conn, residents add sales tax. 

Please order from this advertisement. If you garden 
regularly and would like to have a complimentary sub- 
scription to our nationally known Gardening Publica- 
tions Service during 1979, please note it on your bulb 
order. The Service is sold by subscription for $5.00 a 
year, but is sent without charge to active customers. It

principally pieces resulting from the 
destructive collisions of a few large 
minor planets? Detailed computa- 
tions during the past few years im- 
ply that the asteroid belt is indeed 
in a highly fragmented state. The 
belt appears to have originated as a 
system of perhaps fifty large bodies 
in the 50- to 500-mile size range. 
These accreted during the forma- 
tion of the solar system and began 
at once to suffer mutual collisions. 
This hypothesis suggests that only 
a few of the larger asteroids are 
still intact bodies from the original 
distribution. The notion seems to be 
borne out by the periodic light vari- 
ations of most asteroids. The con- 
stantly changing light output is most 
likely due to the rotation of irregu- 
larly shaped objects, fragments 
from collisions. The Viking space- 
craft photographs of the Martian 
moons Phobos and Deimos demon- 
strate the appearance of typical 
irregular asteroidal bodies. The 
shapes can be extreme, as in the 
case of 433 Eros, which is a spindle- 
shaped rock about 5 by 10 by 20 
miles that tumbles along its orbit 
with a period of about 5.3 hours. 

Up to 1970, the only available 
data on asteroid diameters were 
from direct measurement of the 
tiny disks of the four largest bodies 
using some of the world&apos;s largest 
telescopes. With image sizes only 
just above the limit of resolution, 
these diameters were at best esti- 
mates of size. Diameters for smaller 
bodies were rough estimates based 
on their brightness relative to the 
measured four. In 1970, however, as- 
tronomers applied two completely 
new approaches to asteroid diame- 
ters. The first involves a study of 
the polarization of sunlight reflected 
by an asteroid at different phase 
angles. Polarization becomes nega- 
tive for small phase angles but rises 
linearly at angles greater than about 
15°. Laboratory studies of pow- 
dered terrestrial, lunar, and meteor- 
itic rocks show that the slope of 
this rising branch is closely corre- 
lated with the albedo, or reflectiv- 
ity, of the sample. Moreover, the 
relation is completely independent 
of mineral grain size or other physi- 
cal effects. The absolute magnitude 
of an asteroid, coupled with the 
albedo deduced in this way, imme- 
diately gives the minor planet diam- 
eter. 

The second technique makes use 
of asteroid brightness in both the

visible and the infrared. The visible 
brightness is light reflected by the 
asteroid; the infrared brightness 
arises from light absorbed and sub- 
sequently reradiated as heat. The 
ratio of these two yields the albedo, 
which again gives the asteroid size. 
These two powerful, independent 
new techniques are both based on 
firmly established theory. Studies 
of the brightest asteroids require 
only modest astronomical tele- 
scopes. The use of very large tele- 
scopes enables hundreds of aster- 
oids to be studied. 

The initial results from both meth- 
ods were consistent but startling. 
Deduced albedos vary from 1 .9 per- 
cent for 95 Arethusa to 37.7 percent 
for 44 Nysa. In general, though, the 
190 asteroids studied so far divide 
into two main groups. The low- 
albedo group was unexpected and is 
probably produced by a carbon-rich 
surface material. The other group 
appears to have albedos corre- 
sponding to siliceous minerals. 

The asteroids studied so far tend 
to be the brightest ones that either 
have high albedos or are situated in 
the inner part of the asteroid belt. 
If these effects are allowed for. it is 
clear that carbonaceous asteroid 
surfaces are the commonest type 
and become more frequent moving 
outward through the belt. At the 
inner edge, about 50 percent are 
dark bodies but this figure steadily 
increases to fully 95 percent at the 
outer edge. As a result, when the 
dozen largest asteroids are listed, 
the few large bright objects are 
joined by many unfamiliar dark dis- 
tant objects. There are now 112 



minor planets with diameters of 
fifty miles or more and, after selec- 
tion effects have been allowed for, 
it is clear that 88 percent of these 
are carbonaceous. One serious con- 
sequence of these results is a much 
larger concentration of substantial 
bodies toward the outer edge of the 
belt than previously suspected. The 
maximum density of the belt must 
therefore lie somewhere beyond 
three astronomical units (AU). 

During their history the minor 
planets may or may not have suf- 
fered internal melting, depending 
on the amount of radioactive mate- 
rial present in each body. The larger 
the body, the more likely melting 
would have been. If the whole planet 
melted and differentiated, then a 
metallic core with a small layer of 
stony iron material would be en- 
cased in a thick basaltic outer shell. 
Partial melting is, however, more 
likely and would lead to a small 
metallic body at the center of a 
large, stony iron core, overlain with 
silicates and topped with a thick 
layer of unaffected primitive car- 
bonaceous materials. The spectral 
data show that there are many red- 
dish asteroids with siliceous sur- 
faces in the 25- to 125-mile size 
range and some investigators have 
suggested that these are the stony 
iron cores of differentiated asteroids 
that have lost their thick mantles in 
collisions. The hard core would not 
be so easily fragmented. These bod- 
ies prevail in the inner part of the 
belt where collisions would have 
been more common. Probably the 
only fully differentiated asteroids 
that still survive intact are 1 Vesta 



84 



and possibly a few other bright 
objects. 

The Apollo and Amor group are 
asteroids traveling in eccentric 
ellipses that carry them sunward 
among the terrestrial planets. Many 
pass close to the earth and more 
than twenty are now known. Sur- 
prisingly, this group contains the 
only asteroids with spectra closely 
resembling the normal chondritic 
meteorites — the commonest type of 
meteorite fall. These bodies may 
have originated as small debris de- 
flected from the main asteroid belt 
or they may be the degassed extinct 
rocky nuclei of short-period comets. 
A number of these objects could be 
reached by spacecraft relatively 
easily. They offer an opportunity of 
manned exploration using only 
modified Apollo equipment. 

The Trojan asteroids, named after 
the heroes of the two camps in the 
Trojan War, exist in fairly stable 
libration, or oscillating, orbits with 
Jupiter. They occupy one corner of 
an equilateral triangle with the sun 
and Jupiter, on either side of the 
giant planet, but can oscillate con- 
siderably to either side of these 
mean positions. Up to 1974, only 
sixteen were known, but a recent 
survey has revealed several thou- 
sand faint Trojans. These minor 
planets are remarkable in having 
exceptionally dark, rather reddish 
surface materials unlike any of the 
main belt asteroids. 

II is now clear that primitive ma- 
terials that condensed directly from 
the primordial solar system gas and 
dust cloud may still survive intact 
in some of the minor planets. 
Manned and unmanned missions to 
recover samples from these bodies 
are now underactive discussion. Of 
particular interest would be rock 
from the surfaces of the Trojan or 
carbonaceous main belt planets. 
The asteroids may turn out to be the 
Rosetta stones of the solar system 
with their primitive materials re- 
vealing a vast amount of fresh in- 
formation on the early days of solar 
system history.

Celestial Events 

by Thomas D. Nicholson 



Sun and Moon The sun moves through the stars of Aries from 
the beginning of May until the 14th, then moves into Taurus, where it 
remains until late June. By mid-May, it is so far north that the dura- 
tion of daylight ( 14 hours and 23 minutes) is near its maximum for the 
year. The moon is a morning crescent in early May (and again in 
early June). The evening crescent will appear near Venus about the 
8th or 9th of May, and the moon will remain an evening object until 
the last week. The evening crescent will also show up about June 8, 
again near Venus. 

Phases in May are new moon on the 6th, first-quarter on the I5th, 
full moon on the 22nd, and last-quarter on the 28th. New moon will 
recur on the 5th of June, first-quarter on the 13th, full moon on the 
20th, and last-quarter on the 27th. 

Stars and Planets May is a great month for evening planets. Venus 
and Jupiter are in the west at sundown. Venus, the brighter, will ap- 
pear first. In early May, Venus is near the star Aldebaran (in Taurus), 
and Jupiter is higher to its left. Venus moves swiftly toward Jupiter, 
however, and the distance between them closes perceptibly from 
night to night. They come together on the 28th, and thereafter Venus 
is higher and to the left as they separate again. 

While Venus plays &quot;catch up&quot; with Jupiter, Mars is doing the 
same with Saturn, higher and to the left in the evening sky. In early 
May. Mars is midway between Pollux and Castor (the twin stars of 
Gemini) and Regulus (in Leo). Saturn, meantime, is near Regulus, to 
its right and above — and brighter than — the star. Mars is moving left 
(east) much more rapidly than Saturn, closing the distance between 
them each night. It passes Saturn very closely on June 4, with Regu- 
lus still nearby. The moon adds to the group from May 13 to 15 and 
again on the evening of June 11. 

May 5: The Eta Aquarid meteor shower (only 20 per hour, but 
often quite bright) reaches maximum. 

May 8: The moon covers Aldebaran (an occultation) in daylight 
over much of northeastern North America. 

May 8-11: The crescent moon is near Venus and Jupiter. 

May 9: Mercury is at greatest elongation (distance from the sun) in 
the morning sky, but not well placed for viewing. 

May 11: The moon is at apogee (farthest from earth). 

May 13-15: The moon (near first-quarter) passes below Mars and 
Saturn (and the nearby star Regulus) on these evenings. 

May 24: The moon is at perigee (nearest earth). 

May 28: Venus is in conjunction with Jupiter and moves from right 
to left past it. 

June 4: Mars is very close to Saturn and moves past it from right to 
left. Regulus is nearby to the left of the two planets. 

June 7: The crescent moon is near Jupiter, perhaps our last chance 
to see the planet as an evening star in this cycle. 

June 8: The moon is at apogee and passing south of Venus.

Silent Music 
and Invisible Art 



by Edmund Carpenter 



Unlike Westerners, 

the people of some cultures 

preserve their mysteries 



To Western man, &quot;silent music&quot; 
is a contradiction in terms. &quot;Invis- 
ible art&quot; seems equally absurd, im- 
possible, like the child of a barren 
woman. Even inaccessible art, al- 
though conceivable, seems some- 
how wrong, especially if deliber- 
ately inaccessible. 

Roberto Matta, the surrealist, 
once put a painting on the six in- 
terior sides of a box, which he then 
sealed. And Walter de Maria pro- 
posed that a great cylinder be 
buried in a mountain overlooking 
Munich, its entrance concealed and 
never revealed. But Matta found no 
buyer and de Maria no backer. Art, 
we feel, demands viewers, and 
music, listeners. 

I heard of an incident in the 1950s 
when a number of drug patients, 
many of them jazz musicians, were 
deprived of their instruments as 
punishment for some minor infrac- 
tion of hospital rules. They sat 
about listlessly until a saxophonist 
picked up his invisible instrument 
and began to play silently; soon all 
the others joined in. 

We call this mime, not music. 
Music is something we hear and 
share. Yet in many tribal societies, 
silent music is cultivated, even in- 
stitutionalized. Singers sometimes 



plug both ears, converting sound 
into inner vibration. Or they may 
play small musical instruments in- 
side their closed mouths. 

Among North American Indians, 
silent music was the essence of the 
spirit quest. At puberty a boy went 
apart from his fellows and fasted for 
a time in the wilderness. If he was 
the proper sort, a spirit took pity on 
him, bestowing special powers, 
principally in the form of songs. 
These remained his personal prop- 
erty, never to be revealed, save just 
before death — and even then, not 
always. 

In days of torment and doubt, he 
sang alone or silently to evoke his 
guardian&apos;s help, singing again when 
relief was granted. He also gave 
thanks by painting or carving 
images addressed to his guardian. 
These were hidden in inaccessible 
places — on cliff walls facing the sky 
or in forbidden caves facing dark- 
ness. They were never intended to 
be seen by the living. 

Most were small, but a few — 
probably clan efforts — were im- 
mense, laid out on mountaintops or 
scraped from desert floors. One is 
reminded of the tale of the giant so 
huge he is invisible. From the ground 
nothing can be seen save meaning- 
less lines of rock and earth. Only 
when seen from the sky do these 
lines become coherent. Now, from 
airplanes, we see what was once 
reserved for spirits. 

In Canada, such earth sculptures 



are generally geometric, but along 
the Mexican-United States border, 
many are anthropomorphic, often 
depicting a male and female in 
coitus. Here, as elsewhere in the 
tribal world, such pairs probably 
represent the original tribal an- 
cestors in &quot;primordial copulation&quot;; 
the monument thus represents the 
origin of the tribe and, by exten- 
sion, the beginning of the world. 

Such pregnant images were far 
too potent for mortal eyes. So were 
the contents of medicine bundles. 
Some medicine bundles were never 
opened, not even by their owners, 
who already knew what lay within. 
They had been entrusted with songs 
and formulas that now resided in 
fetishes concealed within the 
bundles. Any exposure, certainly 
any public exposure, could only 
diminish these powers. 

We often think of communication 
as the transfer of knowledge from a 
knower to a nonknower. In a tribe, 
where all who are entitled to know, 
already know, such transfer is 
meaningless; the sharing of knowl- 
edge threatens both its ownership 



A Haida Indian rattle, from 

British Columbia, circa 1840, 

became a mere blur when 

shaken and was hidden away 

when not in use.

n 



and the very nature of that knowl- 
edge. Even when an object is 
brought forth publicly, it may be ex- 
posed in such a way it cannot really 
be seen. Among the Haida Indians, 
finely detailed rattles become mere 
blurs when rapidly shaken at 
crowded, firelit ceremonies. And 
among the Salish, when a spindle 
whorl is spun, its complex design 
disappears; when not in use, it is 
hidden away. 



We Westerners treat art as public 
property. We display it with maxi- 
mum clarity, in every possible 
medium, hoping for the largest pos- 
sible audience. Our museums boast 
of crowds who come to see art and 
buy reproductions to take home. 

American Indians treated art dif- 
ferently. Only a small part of their 
art was intended for public display. 
Clan and house objects were collec- 
tively owned, of course, but even 



they were displayed only on appro- 
priate occasions, by appropriate 
persons, in appropriate ways, be- 
fore select audiences. Residents in 
Indian villages spent their lives 
surrounded by hidden art; each saw 
only those treasures and heard only 
those songs he was entitled to see 
and hear. 

Art inspired by visions was even 
less accessible. Private visions, like 
private songs, remained private.

Public exposure diminished their 
power and made them vulnerable to 
theft, so they were carefully con- 
cealed. 

Still, the possessor was tempted 
to hint about the visions. One meth- 
od was pictorial shorthand, which 
produced abstract designs no 
stranger could decipher. Meaning 
was reserved for owners and when 
they died, was forever lost. 

Among the Salish, according to 




anthropologist Wayne Suttles, &quot;the 
vision was the unique experience of 
the individual,&quot; a source of skill 
and status. Its owner kept its exact 
nature secret, perhaps until old age. 
But he might hint at it in the winter 
dance, by word or movement. Any 
other representation was &quot;vague, 
ambiguous, covert.&quot; 

&quot;Clearly,&quot; Suttles reported, 
&quot;there were limits on the repre- 
sentation of visions (&apos;guardian 



spirits&apos;). In native theory, everyone 
(or every male perhaps) ought to 
&apos;train&apos; and have a vision. But it was 
dangerous to reveal too much about 
it. If you talked about it, you could 
&apos;spoil&apos; it; it might leave you or even 
make you sick or it could be taken 
away from you by an enemy 
shaman. Yet eventually you wanted 
others to know that you &apos;had some- 
thing.&apos; Probably all [ethnologists 
who have worked on the Northwest 




Aerial photographs reveal old 
Indian sculptures that are almost 
indiscernible on the ground. The 
serpent mound, left, in Adams 
County, Ohio, is from the Adena 
Culture. The human figure, above, 
is on the desert floor at Blythe, 
California. The circular lines 
were made by modern vehicles.

Coast] have heard hints and half- 
revelations about what people 
&apos;have.&apos; [Being possessed] by a song 
at the winter dance is, of course, 
evidence that you &apos;have something&apos; 
and the words of the song and the 
movements of the dance may hint at 
what it is. But it must be tempting 
to hint in other ways, though dan- 
gerous to go too far.&quot; 

In some tribes, visions were 
never concretely represented. Else- 



where they were portrayed, but 
with constraints that affected artis- 
tic expression. One effect was a ten- 
dency to make images that were 
essentially in-visible. When you 
look outward, you see nature. But 
when you look inward, you see 
those invisible forces that under- 
lie nature, including human nature. 
This is the insight of the blind seer. 
It is also the method of the modern 
scientist who insists that reality is 



not in appearances, but in the laws 
that govern them. 

Eskimo artists concern them- 
selves with both natural appear- 
ances and inner realities. As hunt- 
ers they observe nature carefully, 
and as artists they match their carv- 
ings with nature. Some carvings are 
so accurate, so detailed, that one 
can tell, say, a common loon from 
a red-throated loon. 

But when these artists depict

The cave paintings of prehistoric 
Europe, dating from 35,000 to 
10,000 B.C., are examples 
of secret art. Probably painted 
by torchlight, most are situated 
deep in caves and presumably 
had ritual significance. The 
horse, left, is in a cave at 
Lascaux, France; the bison, 
below, is on the ceiling of a cave 
at Alt amir a, Spain.

inner reality, art becomes making, 
not matching, and images become 
surrealistic. As one Netsilik woman 
said, &quot;We believe that people can 
live a life apart from real life.&quot; 

The Danish ethnographer Knud 
Rasmussen tells of asking Anarqaq, 
an Eskimo shaman, to draw spirit 
visions: &quot;He would sit for hours

getting the vision fixed in his mind, 
and only when this was done would 



he attempt to put it into form. 
Sometimes the recollection of the

Ritual words can be more im- 
portant than visions. Sometimes 



they are a source of artistic inspira- 
tion or the basis for skill and status. 
And sometimes they are the power 
behind certain ceremonies, incanta- 
tions, rites. The efficacy of ritual 
paraphernalia and protective de- 
signs often depends on them. Like 
visions and silent music, ritual 
words are privately owned by indi- 
viduals who keep them to them- 
selves.

do you carve a word? One way is to 
use an acoustic model: make the 
eye subservient to the ear by pat- 
terning space acoustically. An es- 
sential feature of sound is that it fills 
space. We say, &quot;The night shall be 
filled with music,&quot; just as the air is 
filled with fragrance. The concert- 
goer closes his eyes. 

Auditory space has no favored 
focus. It is a sphere without fixed 
boundaries, space made by the 
thing itself, not space containing 
the thing. It is dynamic, always in 
flux, creating its own dimensions 
moment by moment. 

Alaskan Eskimo mask makers 
were inspired by songs heard in 
dreams. Each design, obedient to 
an inner impulse, creates its own 
dimensions, asserts its own iden- 
tity, unhampered by external re- 
straints. Used once, each mask was 
then burned. 

Japanese and Tibetan Buddhism 
are full of esoteric paintings and 
images not supposed to be seen. 
Certain Buddhist mandala must be 
destroyed almost as soon as they 
are completed. 

In the Japanese secular art of 
bonseki, the artist is required to de- 
stroy his sand paintings after about 
two weeks. Navaho sand paintings 
qualify as &quot;sand mandalas&quot; with 
the same requirements. In fact, 
sand paintings in many parts of the 
world are generally erased as a final 
step in their production. Chants as- 
sociated with them are kept secret. 

Rituals and sacred dances are im- 
permanent art forms, and often the 
articles produced for them are de- 
stroyed at the close of the perform- 
ances. This custom is so wide- 
spread as to suggest great antiquity. 

Among the Eskimo, carvings are 
rarely saved. When spring comes 
and igloos melt, old habitation sites 
are littered with waste, including 
beautifully designed tools and tiny 



A Kuskokwim Eskimo mask is 
based on a song heard 
in a dream. By carving a song, 
an Eskimo could keep the 
original experience secret, 
yet hint at its existence. 



carvings, not deliberately thrown 
away, but with even greater indif- 
ference, just lost. 

To the Eskimo, a carving, like a 
song, isn&apos;t a thing. When you feel a 
song within you, you sing it; when 
you sense a form emerging from the 
ivory, you release it. As the carver 
holds the unworked ivory lightly in 
his hand, turning it this way and 
that, he whispers, &quot;Who are you? 
Who hides there?&quot; And then: &quot;Ah, 
Seal!&quot; He rarely sets out to carve, 
say, a seal, but picks up the ivory, 
examines it to find its hidden form, 
and if that is not immediately appar- 
ent, carves aimlessly until he sees 
it, humming or chanting as he works. 
Then he brings the form out; the 
hidden seal emerges. It was always 
there. He didn&apos;t create it, he re- 
leased it; he helped it step forth. 

Eskimo are more interested in 
the creative activity than in the 
product of that activity. Art to them 
is a transitory act, a relationship. 

Hidden art takes many forms: an 
insignia on the inner side of an Eliz- 
abethan finger ring; entire In- 
donesian temples concealed be- 
neath stone structures; paintings on 
the inside of a mummy case, facing 
the deceased. 

I once saw a gold brooch whose 
form was abstract, until you blew 
on it, at which point its spinning 
parts formed the letters KKK, for 
Ku Klux Klan. 

Small cabins on the banks of the 
Rhine belong to families whose fish- 
ing rights date from medieval times. 
During Fastnacht, a three-day 
winter festival, cabins are left un- 
guarded. An unidentified artist 
selects one and covers its inner 
walls with pornography. When the 
owner returns, he may simply lock 
the door or he may invite friends. 
Either way, tradition requires that 
the paintings remain for one year; 
then they are eradicated . Such paint- 
ings generate wide speculation. Ru- 
mors abound. Old tales are revived. 
Yet only a few people actually see 
anything. 

A tribe has been defined as a 
community where everyone shares 
all information simultaneously. But 
surely not all information? Even 
the smallest band of tribesmen 
keeps secrets and enjoys mysteries, 
and art is a favorite hiding place for 



both. Tribal art is filled with puzzle- 
pictures and visual puns and cryptic 
messages in cartoon shorthand. No 
stranger deciphers even the first 
layer of these many ambiguities. 

Perhaps we should redefine a 
tribe as a group whose shared 
knowledge permits communication 
through secrecy. We, who have lost 
this ability, create instead the ulti- 
mate in accessibility as a substitute 
for the network of tradition. 

We love to solve mysteries. Our 
children, when visiting their grand- 
mother, head first for the attic, to 
open trunks. I was fascinated to 
learn that a safe deposit in Basel 
can be opened only by its owner, 
even if it lies dormant for a thou- 
sand years. Fascinated but skepti- 
cal: could any Westerner, even a 
Swiss, resist a mystery for a thou- 
sand years? 

Recently a museum collection of 
African fetishes, each sealed in 
leather shrouds, proved too tempt- 
ing; the curator X-rayed them, thus 
satisfying his curiosity while pre- 
serving their bindings. 

If there is an Indian mound in the 
neighborhood, we open it. I doubt 
that a single known mound in North 
America has escaped violation. 
Nearly forty years ago, as an arche- 
ologist, I asked a landowner for 
permission to open a burial mound. 
He refused on the grounds that he 
respected the mystery. I was disap- 
pointed but I never forgot, or con- 
demned, his decision. 

When American Indians burn 
their sacred treasures, rather than 
sell them to us, we are disap- 
pointed and puzzled, and that puz- 
zlement derives partly from respect. 

Perhaps the real message of tribal 
art is not its form or its beauty, but 
its reminder of the gift of privacy. 

I accept that there are mysteries 
best left unsolved — that some an- 
swers must forever elude outsiders. 
I was once very close to several Es- 
kimo friends but I gave up hope we 
could ever come to know each 
other completely. If I had come to 
know them completely, I would 
have become an Eskimo; I would 
have lost my own identity, and this 
I did not choose to do. 

&quot;We wed ourselves to the mys- 
tery,&quot; not to conquer it or be con- 
quered by it, but to greet it. D

A Matter of Taste

Slippery Characters 



A shocking congeries of facts 
about current morays 

Eels get a very bad press. Part 
of the stigma stems from pure igno- 
rance. In the Great Lakes region, 
eels have been tarred with the same 
brush as their look-alikes, the lam- 
preys. Lampreys are not eels at all, 
but eellike fish, which until recently 
menaced the survival of more con- 
ventional table fish such as Lake 
Michigan whitefish. Leaving aside 
that the dread lamprey itself has 
been prized as food for eons in Bor- 
deaux (and that these ugly preda- 
tors could have been eaten by 
Michiganders instead of merely 
killed for bounty by the environ- 
mentalists who recently succeeded 
in decimating them), it is particu- 
larly unfair that the eminently pal- 
atable true eels of the order Anguil- 
liformes should have been confused 
with lampreys and made to bear the 
burden of yet another prejudice, 
that eels are electric. True eels are 
not electric (electric &quot;eels&quot; are re- 
lated to carp), and they are notably 
delicious. 

This is not some eccentric quirk 
of taste that I developed during my 
misspent life. Almost the entire 
civilized world votes with me on the 
eel question. Let us begin with the 
ancient Greeks, who so doted on 
the eels of Lake Copais in Boeotia 
that Aristophanes was able to build 
an entire comedy around the predi- 
lection. The Achaniians involves a 
separate peace struck by private 
citizens whose craving for Copaic 
eels and other exotic delicacies was 
so strong that they declared a per- 
sonal armistice during the Pelopon- 
nesian War. 



In Germany, whenever you turn 
around, someone offers you smoked 
eel, as if it were his virgin daughter 
and you were the luckiest man in 
the world to be getting such a treat. 
Spanish groceries in New York 
carry tins of baby eels, officially 
known as elvers. In England, one of 
the few surviving British dishes of 
universally high quality is jellied 
eels. Any seafood restaurant has 
this remarkable, refined dish. The 
Japanese and Chinese devour eels 
with abandon. And knowledgeable 
New Yorkers, fleeing the city for a 
weekend in the Hamptons, will stop 
at one of the roadside stands to buy 
locally speared and smoked eel. 

Then, ensconced beside the 
dunes, they can squeeze a little 
lemon on that tender and unfishy 
flesh, all white around the central 
bone. The meat forks away easily, 
and downed with a shot of cold 
vodka, eel is as good as food gets. 
And there are millions of eels 
swarming and writhing in our local 
waters, waiting to slither into our 
nets. So why do we spurn Anguilla 
rostratal Because we have allowed 
irrelevant characteristics of eel 
anatomy and physiology to repel us. 

Eels look like big worms. They 
evolved without the bony skeletons 
of the less primitive, more conven- 
tional teleost fish. They breath with 
gills and have backbones like other 
fish, but eels are long and sinuous. 
They are apparently scaleless, have 
no pelvic fins, and lack dorsal 
spines. Their tails are pointed, not 
forked, and they slink through the 
water (this undulating movement 
gave rise to the 1920s expression: 
&quot;She&apos;s the eel&apos;s hips&quot;). 

Also, eels are slimy. This mucous 



100 



by Raymond Sokolov 



exudation is extremely useful to 
eels because it retains moisture on 
their skin surface, allowing them to 
respirate through the skin. That 
means that eels can survive on land 
for periods as long as two days. The 
Irish ichthyologist Christopher 
Moriarty, in his Eels: A Natural 
and Unnatural History, says: 

I usually place my captives at once in 
anaesthetised water in the bottom of a 
large dustbin. Otherwise they have a 
disheartening way of leaping out of a 
small boat or hiding beneath the floor- 
boards. Freshwater eels on migration 
will leave the water if they meet a bar- 
rier and can make long journeys through 
wet grass. Little eels wriggle through 
damp moss in preference to trying to 
swim up a waterfall and there are rec- 
ords of eels crawling out on land to 
forage. 

Moriarty also points out that the 
ability of eels to survive without 
much oxygen makes them power- 
fully resistant to water pollution. 
Moriarty does not say so, but it is 
obvious that this faculty makes eels 
good bets to survive as food fish in 
our coastal waters and industrially 
polluted rivers long after more pic- 
turesque species hit bottom. 

Perhaps the one truly alarming 
aspect of the eel is its still myste- 
rious life cycle. The eels most famil- 
iar to Americans and Europeans 
spawn in the Sargasso Sea, that 
vast Atlantic seaweed wasteland 
better known as the Bermuda Tri- 
angle. The actual mating procedure 
is not well understood, and the in- 
stinctual drive that sends the Euro- 
pean common eel (Anguilla an- 
guilla) on a migratory circuit of 
thousands of miles through open 
ocean is a largely unexplained phe-

nomenon. Warm water, which is 
abundant in the southern Atlantic, 
seems to be at the heart of the 
enigma. Depth also counts, but no 
one knows why. 

Eel reproduction has excited 
much fantastic commentary. Aris- 
totle asserted that eels were sexless 
and arose out of mud through spon- 
taneous generation. One reason for 
this apparently bizarre notion is the 
eel&apos;s minute ovary, so tiny that it is 
barely visible to the naked eye. 
Even today, when the basic facts of 
eel sexual anatomy are known, sex- 
ing little, transparent elvers is a 
chancy business. Older, bigger eels 
are an easier bet, but maturation in 
eels is not a straightforward matter. 
Population density seems to affect 
the statistical balance between male 
and female fish. Some fish do not 
mature at all if water conditions are 
unfavorable. Perhaps the only, 
easily documented fact in the eel 
life cycle is the animal&apos;s age. Like 
trees, the eel&apos;s otoliths — balancing 
organs at the base of its skull — 
develop annual rings observable by 
microscope. The otoliths prove that 
eels can age, with sinuous grace, to 
a silvery eighty-five. 

For the fisherman or cook, these 
anguillan arcana are not of prime 
importance. When eels swarm, men 
can net or spear them with relative 
ease. Then the trouble begins. Dis- 
patching eels quickly is necessary 
but not fun. Some people chill them 
to death, but the classic method is 
to cover them with salt; the result- 
ant release of slime is followed by 
suffocation. After the slime is 
scraped olf, eels can be smoked 
with the skin on. For other cooking 
preparations, skinning is a bother- 
some essential. In one method, the 
head is nailed to a board, a cut is 
made around the neck, and the skin 
is pulled oflF toward the tail in one 
tubular piece. It is also possible to 
cut the head away, except for a 
point of attachment to the skin. 
Then, holding the exposed flesh at 
the neck with one hand and pulling 
down on the head with the other, 
the head and skin can be completely 
detached. 

Given a skinned, cleaned eel, 
cooking the fish is a simple aflFair. 
Just cut an eel into inch-long seg- 
ments, dredge in flour, and fry until 
brown. There are also various 
classic recipes; unfortunately, the 
greatest is impractical for most 
people. Too many herbs, unusual in 



American gardens, must go into the 
famous green sauce for the Belgian 
anguilles au vert. But if you have a 
source for fresh chervil, sorrel, and 
tarragon, you should not fail to try 
the version of the dish in Nika Ha- 
zelton&apos;s The Belgian Cookbook. 
The other outstanding culinary 
treatment of eel is a French stew 
called matelote (see recipe), which 
comes in several regional varia- 
tions, all of which involve a wine- 
based broth. Around the Seine, 
carp and other river fish are added. 
Red wine is more usual than white, 
which seems to be used only in An- 
jou. In Provence, the catigau is a 
wineless stew of eel, leeks, and 
tomato. 

In Italy, the eels of Comacchio on 
the Adriatic are marinated and spit 
roasted, then served with mostarda, 
fruits preserved in mustard. Italians 
also stew eel in vegetable or white 
wine broth, with characteristic 
Italian seasonings. Indeed, most 
cultures cook eel as they would 
other delicate, white fish. Moroc- 
cans bake large pieces of conger 
with such typically Moroccan fla- 
vorings as orange-flower water, 
sugar, raisins, and saffron. New 
Englanders layer eel, potatoes, and 
onions in a casserole. In Chile, 
where conger is the most popular of 
all fish, it is baked with tomato, 
limas, potatoes, and corn. 

For a completely original ap- 
proach to eel, one goes to England, 
where they poach pieces of eel in 
seasoned broth and then reduce the 
broth until it gels like an aspic when 
chilled. Sometimes the cook has to 
add gelatin to the reduction, but 
natural eel broth is usually gelatin- 
ous enough, and very tasty. 

Finally, there is the question of 
eel connoisseurship. Of the dozens 
of edible species, which eels are the 
best? Is it environmentally noxious 
to consume elvers? Are long eels 
more delicious and tender than 
short ones? Some authorities prefer 
long eels; others advise us to opt for 
those of medium length. As with all 
debates about food quality, these 
controversies cannot be easily re- 
solved in definite terms and depend 
to a large extent on individual taste. 
Local supply will, practically speak- 
ing, solve most of these problems 
for you. Only a few species are 
usually available. As for length, it 
is hard to know what people mean 
when they propagandize in vague 
language for &quot;long&quot; eels. After all, 



102 



the range is very great. Eels can 
commonly attain more than a yard 
from nose to tail. And there are 
reports of veritable sea serpents. 
The biggest, almost certainly facti- 
tious, was Pliny&apos;s monster from the 
Ganges, a 200-foot eel. It is perhaps 
pedantic to wonder what such a 
behemoth could have tasted like, 
but practical eel gastronomy is not 
a farfetched subject. Eels are a rare 
instance of a food source of the 
highest order that has never been 
sensibly exploited. There should, I 
mean, be an eel in your future.

l&apos;/i-2 pounds pan-ready fish, if 
you are ordering from a fish 
market) 
V2 pound mushrooms 
2 tablespoons lemon juice 

Boiling water 
V2 cup golden raisins 
6 small triangles thin white 
bread, crusts removed 

1 . Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter 
in a heavy saucepan. Add the 
onions, carrots, garlic, and flour, 
and cook, stirring, over medium- 
low heat until the vegetables are 
coated with a deep golden layer 
of flour. This will take about 10 
minutes. Do not allow flour to 
burn or it will be bitter. 

2. Stir in the water, the wine, and 
the cognac to make a smooth 
sauce. Add the bouquet garni, 
the clove, salt, and pepper. 
Bring to a boil, cover and sim- 
mer 45 minutes. Stir occasion- 
ally. 

3. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a 
skillet. Brown the eel pieces 
quickly on all sides. Remove the 
fish and keep warm. Reserve 6 



whole mushrooms for garnish; 
chop or slice remaining mush- 
rooms. Add chopped and whole 
mushrooms to butter remaining 
in the skillet. Add lemon juice. 
Saute mushrooms five minutes. 

4. Pour boiling water over raisins. 
Let stand 3 minutes. Drain. 

5. Strain sauce into a clean sauce- 
pan. Add the eel, cover the pan, 
and cook gently 10 to 30 min- 
utes, until the fish is opaque all 
the way through and flakes 
easily. The exact time will de- 
pend on the diameter of the eel 
pieces. 

6. Fry the bread triangles in the 
remaining butter. Drain on paper 
towels. 

7. Add the chopped mushrooms 
and raisins to strained sauce. 
Arrange the eel pieces on a plat- 
ter, spoon over some of the 
sauce and serve the rest sepa- 
rately. Garnish the platter with 
the whole mushrooms and bread 
triangles.

The Mythic Indian 



The White Man&apos;sIndian: Images 
OF THE American Indian from 
Columbus to the Present, by 
Robert F. Berkhofer, Jr. Alfred A. 
Knopf, $15.00: 261 pp.. illus. 



In 1646, one of his &quot;praying In- 
dians&quot; posed a question to the 
Massachusetts missionary John 
Eliot: &quot;Why do you call us In- 
dians?&quot; The answer, of course, is 
deceptively simple: Columbus had 
erred and believed his landfall was 
somewhere in the Spice Islands of 
the Indies (a vast and vague geo- 
graphical area that stretched from 
Japan to India). Even after subse- 
quent explorations corrected Co- 
lumbus&apos;s error in geography, Euro- 
peans continued to refer to the na- 
tive inhabitants of the New World 
as Inciios (Spanish), Indiens 
(French), Indianer (German), and 
our English Indians. 

But the seemingly ingenuous 
question requires a much more pro- 
found reply, one that does, in fact, 
represent the major thesis of Berk- 
hofer&apos;s book: Europeans, and later 
White Americans, maintained the 
erroneous name because Indians 
are an artificial construct of Euro- 
American attitudes, beliefs, and 
prejudices. Berkhofer makes an ex- 
cellent case for the semantic dis- 
tinction between &quot;Indians&quot; and 
&quot;Native Americans&quot; — the former 
as stereotype; the latter as the liv- 
ing, breathing human beings with 
diverse cultures who were the only 
inhabitants of the hemisphere prior 
to 1492. The distinction might ap- 
pear self-evident to us nowadays, 
but for five centuries it almost never 
occurred to those Euro-Americans 
who perceived, observed, evalu- 
ated, and even judged the natives 
with whom they came in contact. 

A basic paradox of this construct 
is that White American attitudes 



have had little relationship to the 
cultures the particular stereotyped 
Indians came from. Apache warrior 
and Cherokee Christian were 
treated with the same blind brutal- 
ity. In short, the artificial construct 
of the Indian was the constant in 
the Americas. The variable was the 
White American attitude, which 
changed from time to time and from 
place to place; the attitude had al- 
most nothing to do with how well 
or how badly Reds responded to 
Whites. Enemies of the Whites were 
deprived of their lands, their fam- 
ilies killed, their cultures destroyed 
— just as were those regarded as 
friends. So the real question that 
might have been asked of Eliot (and 
of all the generations since) is: Why 
do you think of us as you do? 

That Euro-Americans even con- 
sidered the artificial construct oithe 
Indian as existing in the first place 
is grotesque. Native Americans 
never formed a single culture nor 
did they use any single term to refer 
to themselves. At least two thou- 
sand different cultures flourished in 
the Americas at the time of Colum- 
bus. They were distinguished by a 
multiplicity of customs, a rich 
variety of values and beliefs, and 
numerous unrelated languages, 
each with many dialects. By classi- 
fying these many peoples as &quot;In- 
dians,&quot; Whites grossly oversimpli- 
fied the social, cultural, arid linguis- 
tic differences among those so 
labeled. And so we got the bewilder- 
ing array of contrasts: &quot;Noble 
Savage&quot; and &quot;Bloodthirsty Red 
Man&quot;; the stolid yet emotional 
Indian who could be both cunning 
and childlike; both the &quot;innate&quot; 
conservationist and the &quot;natural&quot; 
blight on the wilderness. The sad 
truth is that for nearly five centuries 
one stereotype or another of the 
Indian has been more real to Whites 
than have the actual Native Ameri-

After nailing down these points — 
and doing so with all the intellec- 
tual rigor of a legal brief — Berkhofer 
devotes the remaining 165 pages of 
his book to documenting the per- 
sistence and the perpetuation of the 
artificial construct: in the attitudes 
of divines and anthropologists, in 
literature and art and popular cul- 
ture (film included), and finally in 
governmental policies. He dis- 
cusses, at a breathless pace, the folk 
attitudes that preadapted European 
explorers and settlers to accept the 
stereotype, the &quot;scientific&quot; impri- 
matur given these folk beliefs by 
the distinguished taxonomist Lin- 
naeus, the distortion of Darwinian 
evolution in its application to native 
cultures, and the emergence of dif- 
ferent images of Native Americans 
in the writings of churchmen, 
hacks, and even classic novelists. 

The final section of the book, 
and the longest, summarizes the po- 
litical relations between Whites and 
Reds: the extermination through 
famine, disease, and dislocation of 
countless millions of Native Amer- 
icans (which, amazingly, the author 
regards as possibly a &quot;myth&quot;), the 
removal of all eastern Indians to 
west of the Mississippi, the growth 
of the reservation idea — everything, 
down to the recent Second Battle 
of Wounded Knee and the current 
militancy of the American Indian 
Movement. This partial catalog of 
topics could not possibly capture 
the author&apos;s whirlwind of ideas, 
speculations, and truths (alas, occa- 
sionally half-truths) that gives this 
small book an extremely high spe- 
cific gravity. In many ways it is an 
admirable exposition — written in 
biting, ironic, and aphoristic prose 
— to sustain an indisputably valid 
thesis. 

But what a penalty the author 
pays for his brevity! For example, 
he mentions what sociological and 
psychological jargon refers to as 
the &quot;negative reference group.&quot; He 
wisely states that when the Puritans 
projected &quot;their own sins upon 
people they called savages, then 
the extermination of the Indian be- 
came a cleansing of those sins from 
their own midst as well as the de- 
struction of a feared enemy.&quot; A 
telling point, which is then dropped 
almost never to reappear. 

The reader is left largely ignorant 
of the distortions caused by Franz

Boas, who presided over American 
anthropology during its formative 
half-century, and his students who 
bequeathed to us inept field 
methods, naive observations, and 
facile conclusions. How could 
Berkhofer possibly gloss over Her- 
man Melville&apos;s &quot;Metaphysics of 
Indian-hating&quot; in The Confidence- 
Man, something certainly crucial to 
his thesis? Or ignore the immense 
influence of the editor and poet 
William CuUen Bryant whose much- 
read &quot;The Prairies&quot; (1832) cheer- 
fully described the bleak western 
lands to which the eastern Indians 
were removed as &quot;a little Venice&quot;? 
Why does he largely ignore Robert 
Montgomery Bird&apos;s Nick of the 
Woods, which went through thirty 
printings in several decades and 
molded the Indiophobic attitudes of 
Poe, Twain, Theodore Roosevelt, 
and in fact three generations of 
White Americans? Washington 
Irving&apos; s Sketchbook receives men- 
tion in passing — but where is the 
same Irving who pictured Indians as 
thieving, lazy rascals, wily maraud- 
ers without mercy, in Astoria, a 
book that John Jacob Astor vir- 
tually dictated to him? And as Irv- 
ing later confessed, paid &quot;liberally 
for the time and trouble&quot; to justify 
Astor&apos; s rape of the western fur 
lands and of the Native American 
cultures that occupied them. 

These are a few, only a very few, 
of the crucial omissions. Sins of 
commission — that is, actual distor- 
tions — although fortunately few, 
can also be found throughout the 
book. For example, on page 96 
Berkhofer repeats the substance of 
an extraordinary statement made 
ten pages earlier: &quot;As White settle- 
ment proceeded across the Missouri 
River and the Indian Wars receded 
ever more westward, the Indian lost 
his place as an important subject in 
what we might call elite or formal 
art and literature.&quot; Berkhofer thus 
dismisses from our intellectual his- 
tory such classic authors and their 
works as Twain&apos;s Pudd&apos;nhead Wil- 
son and Tom Sawyer (complete 
with the stereotype of &quot; Injun Joe &quot;) , 
Hart Crane&apos;s major work The 
Bridge, the short stories and The 
Torrents of Spring of Hemingway, 
D. H. Lawrence&apos;s The Plumed Ser- 
pent, William Faulkner&apos;s The Bear 
(considered by some his most per- 
fect work). La Farge&apos;s Laughing 
Boy, Conrad Richter&apos;s Light in the 
Forest, and Robert Lowell&apos;s Old

Glory — to list just a few. And cer- 
tainly the author&apos;s view of con- 
temporary attitudes about Native 
Americans must be askew when he 
regards modern novels with Indian 
themes — such as Thomas Berger&apos;s 
Little Big Man, Ken Kesey&apos;s Otxe 
Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest, and 
even House Made of Dawn by Na- 
tive American Scott Momaday — as 
merely &quot;countercultural.&quot; 

In summary, this book reads like 
a terse outline for a much grander 
work that the author assuredly is 
qualified to write. Indeed, that is 
pretty much what it is: the book 
consists mainly of ideas the author 
has already summarized in chapters 
for the Smithsonian Institution&apos;s 
Handbook of North American In- 



dians, now in preparation. For 
those who cannot wait for the entire 
volume in which these essays will 
appear, the present slim book under 
consideration represents a unique 
purchase, for nothing exactly like it 
exists between one set of covers. 
But for approximately the same 
dollar investment, other readers 
might want to put together their 
own paperback library of books 
that cover much the same ground 
in considerably greater detail and 
variety: Savagism and Civilization, 
by Roy Harvey Pearce; The Return 
of the Vanishing American, by 
Leslie Fiedler; both The Indian in 
America and The Indian and the 
White Man, by Wilcomb Washburn;

One of the most impressive exhibits at the 
American Museum of Natural History is 
not on public display. As a matter of fact, 
only a small fraction of the rare artifacts 
and specimens in our collections can be 
seen in our exhibit halls. In the Museum&apos;s 
laboratories, storerooms, corridors and 
vaults are millions upon millions of items 
that add up to one of the most detailed rec- 
ords extant of the condition of life on earth 
from the very beginning — exhibits of infi- 
nite value to the scientific community and 
the vt-orld at large. 

We make it our business to keep portions of 
these collections in circulation with scien- 
tists, scholars, schools, other museums and 
institutions. Study of this material has often 
had profound influence in such fields as 



medicine, environmental control and oil 
exploration. And, of course, we maintain 
the largest museum of its kind in the world . 
It attracts more than two million visitors a 
year — people of all ages who come here to 
learn and to enjoy the renewing experi- 
ence of discovery. 
To keep our doors open to eager minds and 
our collections moving around to those 
most interested in protecting the quality of 
life we share, we urgently need the support 
of businesses and individuals in New York 
and elsewhere. Like other institutions in 
New York City, the Museum&apos;s funds have 
been cut back drastically. Your contribu- 
tion to the American Museum of Natural 
History will help us continue to provide 
answers to questions that need asking.

The &apos;Hintong (p. 36) 

Although there are many herpe- 
tology books, only a few include the 
tuntong, Batagur baska. Among 
them are Peter Pritchard&apos;s Turtles 
of the World (Jersey City: T. F. H. 
Publications, Inc., 1966), an illus- 
trated natural history with a good 
bibliography; The World of Am- 
phibians and Reptiles, by Robert 
Mertens (New York; McGraw-Hill 
Book Co., Inc., 1960), which takes 
an ecological and ethological ap- 
proach; and a summary of F. D. 
Maxwell&apos;s findings on Batagur in 
Karl P. Schmidt and Robert F. In- 
ger&apos;s Living Reptiles of the World, 
published in 1975 by Doubleday and 
Company, Inc. &quot;With a Casting 
Net,&quot; a short article about the turtle 
egg-collecting parties of Malaysian 
royalty at the turn of the century, is 
reprinted in Stories and Sketches by 
Sir Frank Swettenham, selected by 
William R. Roff (Kuala Lumpur: 
Oxford University Press, 1967). A 
short article, &quot;River Terrapin,&quot; by 
Mohd. Khan bin Momin Khan, on 
the West Malaysian Game Depart- 
ment&apos;s plans for the conservation of 
Batagur appeared in the July 1977 
issue of Nature Malaysiana. 

Small Ungulates (p. 44) 

Much of what is known about the 
behavior and ecology of small ungu- 
lates is contained in The Behavior 
I of Ungulates and Its Relation to 
Management, volumes 1 and 2, 
edited by V. Geist and F. Walther, 
and published in 1974 by the Inter- 
national Union for Conservation of 
Nature and Natural Resources, 
Morges, Switzerland. Paper no. 8, 
by Richard D. Estes, and paper no. 
10, by V. Geist, both in volume 1, 
are particularly important. P. J. 
Jarman&apos;s &quot;The Social Organization 
of Antelope in Relation to Their 
Ecology&quot; (Behaviour, 1974, pp. 
215-67) and K. L. Tinley&apos;s &quot;Dikdik 



Madoqua kirki in South West Af- 
rica: Notes on Distribution, Ecol- 
ogy, and Behavior,&quot; (Madoqua, 
1969, pp. 1-33) are technical but 
have good bibliographies. Portraits 
in the Wild, by Cynthia Moss (Bos- 
ton: Houghton Mifflin Company, 
1975), is a readable review of the 
material on the dik-dik. Rennie 
Bere&apos;s Antelopes (New York: Arco 
Publishing Co., Inc., 1971) is a 
beautifully illustrated work. Two 
papers that discuss the water me- 
tabolism and thermal biology of Af- 
rican and Asian small ungulates are 
&quot;The Water Metabolism of a Small 
East African Antelope: The Dik- 
dik,&quot; byG. M.O. Maloiy (Proceed- 
ings of the Royal Society of London,

by G. Causey Whittow et al. (Com- 
parative Biochemistry and Physi- 
ology, Series A, vol. 56A, pp. 
23-26). 

Capital Punishment (p. 50) 

Capital Punishment: The Inevi- 
tability of Caprice and Mistake, by 
Charles L. Black, Jr., traces the 
decision-making process behind the 
application of the death penalty and 
argues that the system is without 
standardization. This paperback 
was published in 1974 by W. W. 
Norton and Company, Inc., New 
York. Deathwork, by James 
McLendon (Philadelphia: J. B. 
Lippincott Company, 1977), al- 
though a novel, is an accurate, hour- 
by-hour account of the last three 
days of a man on death row. A 
serious study, with extensive notes, 
facts, and cases covering the law, 
capital punishment as a deterrent, 
and the death penalty in America, is

1977). Although out of print. Capi- 
tal Punishment, edited by Grant S. 
McClellan, is a good collection of 
articles that appeared in popular 
news magazines such as Time and

George Edwards (p. 72) 

The first four volumes of George 
Edwards&apos;s work (published in Lon- 



don between 1743 and 1751) were 
printed at the College of Physicians 
in Warwick-Lane under the title 
A Natural History of Uncommon 
Birds. The last three volumes (1758- 
1764) were entitled Gleanings of 
Natural History. Beautifully illus- 
trated, these rare books are worth 
seeking out. Elsa Allen&apos;s &quot;The His- 
tory of American Ornithology Be- 
fore Audubon&quot; (Transactions of the 
American Philosophical Society. 
New Series, vol. 41, 1951) studies 
ornithology and ornithologists from 
Aristotle to Audubon and has an 
extensive bibliography. &quot;George 
Edwards, F.R.S. (1694-1773): An

Silent Music (p. 90) 

Princeton University Press has 
just published three volumes on the 
work of Ananda K. Coomara- 
swamy, the great Indian metaphysi- 
cian and art historian. Volume 2, 
Coomaraswamy : Selected Papers 
of Metaphysics, edited by Roger 
Lipsey, has a chapter on the Vedic 
doctrine of &quot;Silence.&quot; 

The theme of Edmund Carpen- 
ter&apos;s Eskimo Realities (New York: 
Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 
1973) is that art is integrally tied to 
Eskimo life and survival. Silence 
(Middletown: Wesleyan University 
Press, 1961) is a collection of lec- 
tures and essays by John Cage. The 
work is a rhythmic composition of 
disconnected, unconventional 
thoughts using, and concerning the 
uses of, silence and noise, nothing 
and something, indeterminacy and 
change in art, music, and poetry. 
The Eternal Present, by Siegfried 
Giedion, which features cave paint- 
ings, was published in 1964 by 
Princeton University Press.

At the Museum 



When a New York artist sculp- 
tured a Stegosaurus from snow on 
the Museum&apos;s lawn last March, he 
didn&apos;t realize that the 26-foot 
mammoth would be an appropriate 
herald for the Museum&apos;s spring 
show, opening May 24. Ice Age Art 
will be the first comprehensive sur- 
vey of the earliest and longest 
(35,000 to 10,000 B.C.) movement in 
art history — the paintings, engrav- 
ings, and sculpture of Stegosaurus&apos; 
cave-dwelling human contempo- 
raries before they settled down to 
farming and village life. 

The show&apos;s organizer, Alexander 
Marshack of Harvard&apos;s Peabody 
Museum, and the Museum&apos;s Ex- 
hibition and Graphics Department 
have assembled photographs of 
paintings and engravings from more 
than one hundred paleolithic caves 
in France, Spain, and Italy, includ- 
ing some of the best-known cave 
paintings from Lascaux in south- 
west France. Photographs are now 
most art lovers&apos; only means of ap- 
preciating Lascaux, since the caves 
have been sealed to protect the 
paintings from destructive bacteria. 

According to Marshack, &quot;Every- 
one knows about cave paintings, 
but few people realize that there are 
all kinds of other evidence of the 
sophistication of paleolithic so- 
ciety.&quot; In order to draw a three- 
dimensional portrait of Ice Age 
people, Marshack has collected 
photographs of their physical en- 
vironment — the steep, narrow river 
valleys of southwest France where 
Cro-Magnon man&apos;s remains were 
discovered. From American, 
French, Russian, and Czechoslo- 
vakian museums, Marshack has 
borrowed a few rare original pieces, 
as well as many casts of prehistoric 
jewelry, ceremonial objects, musi- 
cal instruments — including bone 
flutes with full octaves — and stat- 
uettes of plump, faceless fertility 
goddesses, among them a cast of the 
Venus of Willendorf, the oldest 
known sculpture of a human figure, 
dated to 25,000 B.C. 

To make these casts look indis- 
tinguishable from their ivory, bone, 
horn, or limestone originals, two 
young designers, Dennis O&apos;Brien 



and Liza Donnelly, set to work in 
the Exhibition Department with 
molds, wax, sandpaper, picks, and 
oil washes. Since many pieces have 
been engraved over and over, per- 
haps during communal rites, 
O&apos;Brien worked from Marshack&apos;s 
microphotographs of the originals. 

Marshack began examining Ice 
Age art under microscopes and 
ultraviolet and infrared light after he 
noticed that some markings on a 
paleolithic bone tool handle ap- 
peared to be, not decorative, but 
calendric — records of phases of the 
moon. Marshack has established 
that Ice Age people could measure 
time and therefore were aware of 
the cycles of plants, animals, and 
seasons. They were also intelligent, 
observant natural historians: cave 
paintings document more than fifty 
animal species, frequently noting 
age, sex, and seasonal behavior. 
Other paintings depict fantastic 
beasts, ancestors of populations in 
medieval bestiaries or mammals 
now extinct in Europe — musk ox, 
ibex, chamois, and the woolly mam- 
moth that inspired the snow beast 
on the Museum lawn. For the show, 
Marshack has found a mammoth&apos;s 
skin, revealing that the animal was 
not snow white but rust red. 

Prehistoric people also drew each 
other. In portraits found mostly in 
France at La Marche, the subjects 
are far from brutish looking; they 
wear shirts of ivory beads, not 
just animal skins. Leafing through 
a portfolio depicting men with ret- 
rousse noses, beards, mustaches, 
and caps; women with headbands, 
elaborately dressed hair, and 
jewelry; old people praying and 
young people dancing, Marshack 
noted, &quot;These people looked like 
us, acted like us, used symbols as 
we do. Their society was probably 
as complex as ours.&quot; 

While we can place paleolithic 
people among appropriate flora, 
fauna, and geography — and even 
envision their faces — we cannot 
decipher Ice Age myths, symbols, 
and rituals. We still do not under- 
stand the purpose or meaning of 
cave art. We only know that it does 
not resemble the art of any primi- 



tive culture. Marshack feels that his 
studies and the Museum&apos;s survey 
of Ice Age art simply teach us 
how to ask better questions about 
prehistory. 

On Mother&apos;s Day, May 14, at 3:00 
P.M., Margaret Mead will speak on 
parenthood in the Museum audi- 
torium. Curator emeritus of ethnol- 
ogy. Mead, herself a grandmother, 
has devoted much of her long career 
to studies of parents and children. 
In her autobiography. Blackberry 
Winter, she writes that she never 
assumed that her strong commit- 
ment to scholarship negated her 
equally strong desire for mother- 
hood. Since many women would 
like to emulate Mead&apos;s successful 
meshing of work and child rearing, 
her thoughts on parenthood are wel- 
come. Admission for Participating, 
Donor, and Life Members is two 
tickets for $5.50, and $5.50 per 
ticket for Associate Members and 
the public. For information regard- 
ing advance ticket sales call (212)

&quot;There is nothing permanent except change.&quot; 

Heraclitus 



The Greek philosopher said it 
2500 years ago. And all the changes 
since then have proved him right. 

Consider America&apos;s energy situa- 
tion: As petroleum becomes harder 
to find, we are turning to that old 
standby— coal. But today Conoco is 
producing coal with technology that 
yesterday&apos;s miners never dreamed of. 

For example, working together, our 



petroleum and coal engineers have 
developed an underground pipeline 
system that mixes coal with water 
and pumps it out of the mine, safer 
and faster. 

We&apos;re also working on ways to 
change coal into other useful forms, 
such as synthetic gas and oil. 

And since America&apos;s need for en- 
ergy will continue to grow, Conoco 



is active in other fields as well— from 
producing uranium to developing 
oil from tar sands. 

At Conoco, we don&apos;t just adapt to 
change; we help shape it.

Authors 



Philip C. Hammond has directed 
archeological expeditions to Petra, 
Hebron, and most recently to Tell 
el-Shuqafiyah in Egypt. Currently 
professor of anthropology at the 
University of Utah, he holds a 
bachelor of divinity degree in 
biblical literature from Drew Uni- 
versity and a doctorate in Near 
Eastern archeology from Yale Uni- 
versity. Hammond has written 
widely on religious and archeologi- 
cal subjects for various journals, 
including Natural History. 





Michael Gochfeld combines the 
profession of biomedical research 
with an interest in avian behav- 
ioral ecology. As a teacher of en- 
vironmental medicine at Columbia 
University School of Public 
Health, he includes in his investi- 
gations the effects of pollutants on 
sea bird populations. In one project 
he has focused on the tern colonies 
at Long Island&apos;s Jones Beach. He 



considers the intrusion of humans 
into the colonies to be as much of a 
pollutant as chemicals or debris. In 
addition to terns, Gochfeld is study- 
ing the behavioral ecology of other 
colonial sea birds, as well as the 
population structure of brown- 
headed cowbirds. 

Photographer -geologist -natural- 
ist Allen Rokach is a staff photogra- 
pher for the Algemeiner Journal and 
supervisor of photography at the 
New York Botanical Garden. Ro- 
kach, who taught geology at the City 
University of New York, also serves 
as an instructor at the New School 
for Social Research, the American 
Museum of Natural History, and 
the Camera Club of New York. His 
articles and photographs have ap- 
peared in leading national publica- 
tions. 




Traditional fishing in the Car- 
ibbean is one of several in- 
vestigative fields that interest 
anthropologist John C. Cordell. A 
postdoctoral fellow at the Depart- 
ment of Genetics, Stanford Medical 
Center, Cordell first visited north- 



eastern Brazil&apos;s poverty-stricken 
fishing centers in 1963. Besides his 
research and writing on the 
fisheries, he has helped to establish 
rural health-care centers in Bahia 
and conducted research on Chinese 
acupuncture and herbal medicine. 



On Photographing the Invisible 



To the naked eye, it was a Swedish 
80-ore postage stamp. A rarity, and 
very valuable. 

The camera, however, told quite 
another story. The stamp was a coun- 
terfeit. 

Faint tracesof tampering that were 
hidden to the naked eye were revealed 
by the camera. Someone, somewhere, 
had ingeniously altered the stamp by 
chemically removing a surprint. The 
stamp was worthless. 




To the naked eye (left), the 
stamp was genuine. To the cam- 
era {right), it was a counterfeit. 
Note the faint, dark traces of 
tampering now revealed in the 
upper section. 



What manner of exotic camera 
was this that could &quot;see&quot; the invisible? 

The lens: one of the 20 in the 
Hasselblad arsenal, the 105mm Zeiss 
UV-Sonnar f4.3. Designed for pho- 
tography within the ultraviolet portion 
of the electromagnetic spectrum, its 
costly quartz elements can detect 
radiations that are unseeable by the 
human eye. 

It has peered at objects in outer 
space, examined forgeries, laid bare 
the secrets of counterfeit money Not 
a lens for everyone, obviously, but an 
indication of just how awesomely com- 
prehensive the Hasselblad System is. 

The camera: an otherwise per- 
fectly standard Hasselblad 500C/M, 



normally fitted with an 80mm Zeiss 
Planar f2.8 multi-coated lens. 

This is the basic model that allows 
you to tap into the vast Hasselblad 
System. It is one of the most bewilder- 
ingly versatile cameras the world has 
ever known. Yet so marvelously simple 
to operate that it often plays the part 
of the family snapshot camera. 

A True System. 

The Hasselblad System is a prodigious 
array of 4 cameras, 20 lenses, 8 view- 
finders, 9 film magazines, and over 
300 other accessories. Choose the right 
pieces, and your 500C/M would be 
equipped for sports, aerial, architec- 
tural, and fashion photography. 

And portrait, landscape, medical, 
underwater, and news photography. 

And wildlife, laboratory indus- 
trial, and child photography. 

And you would always have the 
right film in the camera at the right 
time. You can shift from color to 
black-and-white and back again to 
color— and resume shooting at pre- 
cisely the right frame— by popping in 
the protective dark slide and switch- 
ing film backs. 

The Camera with Nine Backs. 

There is a small button on the film 
back of every Hasselblad 500C/M. 
Slide it sideways with your thumb and 
the back will come away in your hand. 

The standard back holds 12 ex- 
posures. Each frame of film is 2!4 
inches square, almost four times the 
area o/a35mm /rame.(See box, below 
right, for actual size.) 

This IS only the beginning. There 
are eight other backs available: Backs 
that let you change to a 6 x 4.5cm for- 
mat. ..or a 45 X 4.5cm superslide 
format for showing in any 35mm 
projector. Backs that give you a choice 
of 1, 12, 16, 24, 70, or 500 exposures. 
A back that is a sheet-film adapter 



Even two backs for Polaroid film, so 
you can check composition, lighting, 
and exposure ahead of time. 

You begin to realize why eight out 
of ten top commercial photographers 
surveyed name Hasselblad as the 
medium-format camera used in their 
work. 

Retained Value vs. 
Obsolescence. 

In an age when machines spew out 
cameras in the tens and hundreds of 
thousands, when flashy new models 
thrust last year&apos;s marvels into early 
obsolescence, Hasselblad goes its own 
way. 

Planned obsolescence is taboo at 
Hasselblad. All but two of the acces- 
sories for the 500CA4 will fit every 
Hasselblad made since 1957 (except 
the Super Wide C) . . . and will fit every 
future Hasselblad. 

The greater part of a year is spent 
on building each camera, much of it 
crafted by hand. And fully one quarter 
of the work force devotes its time to 
nothing but quality confol. 

Little wonder, then, that a pre- 
owned Hasselblad commands such a 
high price ... if its owner can be per- 
suaded to part with it at all.

In Memoriam 

Some photographers whose pic- 
tures appear in Natural History are 
responding to assignments or re- 
quests; others take an active role in 
finding and photographing interest- 
ing subjects, and thereby spur our 
editors to recruit articles to go with 
the photographs. 

Gail Rubin was one of the latter — 
imaginative, active, always finding 
new things to record with her cam- 
era. A former New York City fash- 
ion photographer who moved to 
Israel, Gail, in her visits to our 
office, often left behind sets of pic- 
tures that eventually became beau- 
tiful additions to the magazine. Her 
evocative desert wildlife photo- 
graphs for &quot;Ibex in Israel&quot; (January 
1978) and her abstract close-ups 
for &quot;Eucalyptus Bark&quot; (December 
1977) are good examples. 

And we are in her debt for this 
issue, too, since some of her pic- 



tures taken in Jordan moved us to 
commission the article on &quot;Petra of 
the Nabataeans.&quot; 

Dawn light in the Levant — where 
Gail chose to pursue her life as a 
photographer — has a special qual- 
ity. On a morning in March she 
walked along the beach of a nature 
sanctuary in Israel, searching for 
wildlife to photograph. That she 
should discover, instead, a party of 
terrorists who had landed secretly, 
that they should question her and 
decide she would be dangerous to 
them if allowed to live, and that 
events from that moment on — in 
Israel and then Lebanon — would 
become more destructive and 
bloodier and bloodier is one of 
those ironies that tax human un- 
derstanding. 

Gail Rubins well-used cameras 
were found in the sand next to her 
body.

Death Be Not Strange 

by Peter A. Metcalf 



As anthropologists learn to 
see other peoples&apos; ways as 
natural, customs closer to 
home begin to seem exotic 



The popular view of anthropology 
is that it is concerned with faraway 
places, strange peoples, and odd 
customs. This notion was neatly 
captured by a nineteenth-century 
wit who described the field as &quot;the 
pursuit of the exotic by the eccen- 
tric.&quot; In recent decades many 
anthropologists have tried to shake 



this image. They see the exotic as 
dangerously close to the sensational 
and, therefore, a threat to the re- 
spectability of a serious academic 
discipline. They argue that anthro- 
pology has solid theoretical bases, 
and that some anthropologists rou- 
tinely work in cities right here in 
America. And they are right. 
Nevertheless, anthropologists are 
as much involved with the exotic as 
ever, and I think that this concern 
actually works to scholarship&apos;s ad- 
vantage. 

This continuing involvement is a 
result of the characteristic modus 



operandi of anthropologists. First, 
we seek out the exotic, in the sense 
of something originating in another 
country or something &quot;strikingly or 
excitingly different,&quot; as my Web- 
ster&apos;s puts it. Second, we try to fit 
this alien item — culture trait, cus- 
tom, piece of behavior — into its 
social and cultural context, thereby 
reducing it to a logical, sensible, 
even necessary element. Having 
done that, we feel that we can 
understand why people do or say or 
think something instead of being 
divorced from them by what they 
say, think, or do.

stretching from Kashmir to Nepal, soaring 
five miles skyward, the Himalayas loom... 
hurled to the top of the world by the colli- 
sion of two continents over 40 million years 
ago. This colossal mountain range has an 
eerie beauty, both terrifying and irresisti- 
ble to men. Many have tried to conquer 
its cruel summits. Few returned alive. 

But now, guided by outstanding writers and 
photographers, you can traverse these 
awesome peaks and chasms. They await 
you in The Himalayas, first book in a glori- 
ous geographic adventure series from 
Time-Life Books. And it&apos;s yours to examine 
for 10 days free! 

You&apos;ll scale Annapurna with Herzog and 
Lachenal, share their nerve-jangling de- 
scent and learn the terrible price of their 
triumph. You&apos;ll explore the wonderlands at 
the base of the Himalayas— where 90°F 
heat evaporates the drenching rain— 250 
inches a year— into steaming mists. 

You&apos;ll meet the denizens of this primeval 



landscape. Griffon vultures that soar like 
jetliners up 25,000 feet. Yeti, the &quot;Abomi- 
nable Snowman, &quot;still a mystery to science. 
Described as half-bear, half-ape, the crea- 
ture is said to have the strength to pull the 
horns off a yak. 

The Himalayas is only the beginning of 
THE WORLD&apos;S WILD PLACES. Future vol- 
umes will take you to still other remote, 
unearthly climes. In The Amazon, you&apos;ll 
face head-hunting Jivaro Indians. In The 
Sahara, you&apos;ll dig in against a colossal 
desert sandstorm. In Soviet Deserts and 
Mountains, you&apos;ll explore a Martian-like 
waste so severe it&apos;s called Barsa Kel&apos;mes 
—&quot;place of no return.&quot; You&apos;ll see the won- 
ders and terrors of Australia&apos;s Greaf Bar- 
rier Reef.

Seems like Omni was built 
for mom. To help her with her 
chores and errands. To pick up 
the gals for fun and games. And 
do it all without messing up her 
fuel budget.

According to EPA estimates, 
Omni is rated 41 MPG [highway] 
and 27 MPG [city] when eduipped 
with its standard 1.7 litre engine, 
four-speed manual transmission, 
and 3.3 transaxle ratio** That&apos;s 
very efficient going, even though 
mom&apos;s mileage may vary 
according to her car&apos;s 
condition and 
the way

Dodge Omni has four wide- 
opening doors. And for any mom 
who&apos;s had to deal with a brace 
of grocery bags, or a bunch of 
kids, or just the general ins and 
outs of a day on the go , . . those 
four doors become important. 

Then there&apos;s Omni&apos;s 
hatchback. Open it up, and you&apos;re 
confronted with a special storage 
compartment covered

[A California 

mom&apos;s mileage is lower.] 

And there&apos;s a lot more for 
moms to like about Omni. It&apos;s 
easy to handle and park, thanks 
to its front-wheel drive and 
precise rack-and-pinion steering. 
It has comfortable seating. There

DODGE 

OMNI. 

ITDOESITAU. 



Sir James Frazer, whose classic 
study of primitive religions, The 
Golden Bough, was first published 
in 1890, provides an excellent ex- 
ample of the eccentric in pursuit of 
the exotic. For him, the process of 
reducing the mysterious to the com- 
monplace was the very hallmark of 
scientific progress. Like many 
anthropologists of his time, Frazer 
assumed that some societies were 
superior and others inferior, and 
that anthropology&apos;s main task was 
to describe how the latter had 
evolved into the former. To Frazer, 
Europe&apos;s technological achieve- 
ments were proof of social, intel- 
lectual, and moral superiority. The 
dominance of the West represented 
the triumph of science, which in 
Frazer&apos;s evolutionary schema, 
superseded even the most rational 
of world religions. Science&apos;s clear 
light was to shine far and wide, 
driving superstition, the super- 
natural, and even God himself back 
into shadows and dimly lit corners. 

But Frazer might have found a 
second aspect of the anthropolog- 
ical modus operandi less to his 
taste. In the course of making sense 
ofsomeone else&apos;s behavior or ideas, 
we frequently begin to observe our 
own customs from a new angle. 
Indeed, this reflexive objectivity is 
often acclaimed as one of the great 
advantages of our methods and 
cited as a major justification for the 
long, expensive physical and 
psychic journeys that we make, 
seeking out societies far removed 
from our own cultural traditions. 
Less often remarked upon, how- 
ever, is that the exotic possesses 
its own reflexive quality. As we 
learn to think of other peoples&apos; 
ways as natural, we simultaneously 
begin to see our own as strange. In 
this sense, anthropologists import 
the exotic, and that, I suppose, puts 
us on the side of the angels. 

An incident that occurred about 
four years ago during my field- 
work in north-central Borneo 
brought home to me the depth and 
subtlety of anthropologists&apos; in- 
volvement with the exotic. I was 
working with the Berawan, a small 
tribe comprising four communities, 
each made up of several hundred 
people living in a massive wooden 
longhouse. The four longhouses 
stand beside the great rivers that 
are the only routes into the interior 
of Borneo. Berawan communities 
live on fish and on rice planted in 



clearings cut anew in the rain forest 
each year. In the late nineteenth 
century, which was a stormy period 
of tribal warfare, each longhouse 
was a fortress as well as a home, 
and the Berawan look back with 
pride on the military traditions of 
that era. 

Among the things that interested 
me about the Berawan were their 
funeral rites, which involve what 
anthropologists call &quot;secondary 
burial,&quot; although the Berawan do 
not usually bury the dead at all. 
Full rites consist of four stages: the 
first and third involve ritual prep- 
aration of the corpse; the second 
and fourth make up steps in storage 
of the remains. The first stage, 
lasting two to ten days, consists of 
rites performed immediately after 



death. During the second stage, the 
bereaved family stores the corpse 
in the longhouse or on a simple plat- 
form in the graveyard. This storage 
lasts at least eight months and 
sometimes for several years if the 
close kin cannot immediately afford 
to complete the expensive final 
stages. Third, if the corpse has been 
in the graveyard, the family brings 
it back to the longhouse, where it is 
kept for six to ten days, while the 
family lavishly entertains guests 
who have been summoned from far 
and wide. Finally, the remains are 
removed to a final resting place, an 
impressively proportioned mauso- 
leum. 

Within this four-part plan, details 
of the corpse&apos;s treatment vary con- 
siderably. During the first storage

stage, the family may place the 
corpse in large earthenware jars or 
in massive coffins hewn from a 
single tree trunk. For secondary 
storage, the family may use valu- 
able glazed jars or the coffin left 
over from the first stage. During 
the third-stage rites, the family may 
take out the bones of the deceased 
and clean them. As the corpse de- 
composes, its secretions may be 
collected in a special vessel. Some 
neighbors of the Berawan re- 
portedly consume liquids of de- 
composition mixed with rice — a 
variety of endocannibalism. 

For anthropologists, this intimate 
interaction with the corpse is cer- 
tainly exotic. For Americans not 
professionally trained in the niceties 
of cultural relativism, Berawan 
burial is no doubt disgusting: keep- 
ing corpses around the house, 
shuttling them between the grave- 
yard and the longhouse, storing 
them aboveground instead of bury- 
ing them, manipulating the bones, 
and, to Western eyes, paying maca- 
bre attention to the process of decay 
itself. My Berawan informants were 
aware that some phases of their 
ritual bothered Europeans. They 
soon learned, moreover, that I had 
a lot of questions about their 
funerals. One of the pleasures of 
working in Borneo is that people 
soon begin to cross-examine their 
interviewer. They are as curious 
about the stranger as he or she is 
about them. So before long, they 
began to quiz me about the death 
ways of my country. 

On one memorable occasion, dur- 
ing a lull in ritual activity, I re- 
sponded to one of these questions 
by outlining American embalming 
practices — the treatment of the 
corpse with preservative fluids and 
its display in an open coffin. I was 
well into my story, concentrating 
on finding the right words to de- 
scribe this unfamiliar topic, when I 
became aware that a sudden silence 
had fallen over my audience. They 
asked a number of hesitant ques- 
tions just to be sure that they had 
understood me correctly and drew 
away from me in disgust when they 
found that they had. So shocked 
were they that I had to backtrack 
rapidly and change my story. The 
topic was never broached again. 

At the time, I did not understand 
why American embalming practices 
had so unnerved the Berawan. 
Now, having thought about the 



meaning of Berawan death rituals, 
I think that I do understand. 

The death rituals of central 
Borneo early attracted the interest 
of explorers and ethnologists. In 
1907, Robert Hertz, a young stu- 
dent of French sociologist Emile 
Durkheim, wrote an essay about 
these rites that has become a 
classic. Never having set foot in 
Borneo, Hertz relied on the ac- 
counts of travelers. Had he not 
been killed during the First World 
War, he might well have undertaken 
firsthand research himself. Never- 
theless, his analysis is still routinely 
cited in discussions and compari- 
sons of funeral customs. Yet, oddly. 
Hertz&apos;s central thesis has received 
very little attention. Hertz hypothe- 
sized that peoples who practice 
secondary burial have certain be- 
liefs about the afterlife, namely, 
that the fate of the body provides 
a model for the fate of the soul. 

Since Hertz did not know of the 
Berawan, they provided me with 
an appropriate test case for his 
hypothesis. I collected data on 
everything related to Berawan 
death rites: the people involved, 
mourning practices, related rituals, 
myths and beliefs, and so on. I also 
pressed my informants for interpre- 
tations of rituals. All the material 
I accumulated revealed a consistent 
set of ideas very similar to those 
described by Hertz. The Berawan 
believe that after death the soul is 
divorced from the body and cannot 
reanimate the already decaying 
corpse. However, the soul cannot 
enter the land of the dead because 
it is not yet a perfect spirit. To be- 
come one of the truly dead, it must 
undergo a metamorphosis. As the 
body rots away to leave dry bones, 
so the soul is transformed slowly 
into spirit form. As the corpse is 
formless and repulsive until putre- 
faction is completed, so the soul is 
homeless. It lurks miserably on the 
fringes of human habitation and, in 
its discomfort, may affect the living 
with illness. The third stage of the 
mortuary sequence, which Hertz 
called the &quot;great feast, &quot;&quot; marks the 
end of this miserable period. The 
soul finally passes to the land of the 
dead, and the mortal remains of the 
deceased join those of its ancestors- 
in the tomb. 

But before this happy conclusion 
is reached, the hovering soul is 
feared because it may cause more 
death. Even more dread surrounds

HOW TO REDUCE RUST 

YOU MAY BE WASHING THE WRONG SIDE OF YOUR CAR. 



Spring is a perfect time 
to do something about rust. 

Rusting is a year-round 
problem, and corrosive con- 
ditions have become a lot 
worse in the last five years. 

If you live where salt is 
used to melt ice on the roads, 
that is speeding up corrosion 
on your car. If you live in the 
country, it&apos;s the calcium 
chloride that&apos;s spread on dirt 
roads to hold down dust. 
And corrosive chemicals in 
the air are causing rust in 
every part of America. 

We&apos;re doing something 
to help prevent rust on the 
new cars we&apos;re building. 
Meanwhile, you can do 
something about reducing 
rust on your car. 

It&apos;s important to wash your 
car often. Use a mild soap 
and lukewarm or cold water. 

Please don&apos;t neglect 
the underside of your car. 
The worst rusting happens 
from the inside out. Thaf s 



because salt, slush, and 
even mud tend to collect in 
the crevices underneath the 
car, in the door creases, and 
inside the fenders. Moisture 
gets trapped in those places 
and causes rust. So try to 
wash the underside of your 
car, too. In winter, if you can, 
and at the first opportunity 
in spring. Even if if s only a 
few times a year, that would 
help some. 

If your car gets dented, 
scratched, or chipped, try 
to get it repaired as soon 
as possible. Even a &quot;small&quot; 
scratch is bad. Because once 
a car starts to rust, the dam- 
age spreads fast. The paint 
around a dent or scratch can 
look okay, but rust is spread- 
ing underneath. In the long 
run, it&apos;s cheaper to fix the 
car right away. 

A lot of people think that 
parking a car in a heated 
garage during the winter 
will help prevent rust. But 
it&apos;s just the opposite. Cold 
slows down the rusting pro- 
cess, as it does most chem- 
ical reactions. 



We&apos;re doing more now to 
protect GM cars from rust. 
For one thing, we&apos;re using 
more rust-resistant mate- 
rials, including different 
types of zinc-coated steel, in 
places where rust usually oc- 
curs. Also, our new paint 
primers and the way we 
apply them are designed to 
provide a thorough finish, 
even on some parts of the 
car you can&apos;t see. 

Our goal is to protect 
your car so that it lasts 
longer and gives you the 
most value. And fighting 
rust helps.

the body itself, caused not by the 
process of rotting, for that releases 
the soul of the deceased from the 
bonds of the flesh, but by the possi- 
bility that some malignant spirit of 
nonhuman origin will succeed in re- 
animating the corpse. Should this 
occur, the result will be a monster 
of nightmarish mien, invulnerable 
to the weapons of men, since it is 
already dead. 

I once witnessed an incident that 
dramatically demonstrated how real 
is the Berawan fear of reanimated 
corpses. Toward sunset, a group of 
mourners and guests were chatting 
casually beside a coffin that was be- 
ing displayed on the longhouse 
veranda in preparation for primary 
storage. Suddenly there was a tap- 
ping sound, apparently from inside 
the coffin. The noise could have 
come from the house timbers, con- 
tracting in the cool of the evening, 
but the people present saw a diflFer- 
ent explanation. After a moment of 
shock, the women fled, carrying 
their children. Some panic-stricken 
men grabbed up what weapons were 
handy, while others tied up the 
coffin lid with yet more bands of 
rattan. Calm was not restored until 
later in the evening when a shaman 
investigated and declared that noth- 
ing was amiss. 

We can now see why American 
mortuary practices so shock the 
Berawan. By delaying the decom- 
position of corpses, we commit a 
most unnatural act. First, we seem 
to be trying to trap our nearest and 
dearest in the unhappiest condition 
possible, neither alive nor in the 
radiant land of the dead. Second, 
and even more perverse and terrify- 
ing, we keep an army of undecom- 
posed corpses, each and every one 
subject to reanimation by a host of 
evil spirits. For the Berawan, 
America is a land carpeted with 
potential zombies. 

After a couple of years of field- 
work, and an application of the 
ideas of Hertz and others, I can 
offer a relatively full account of 
Berawan death ways: what they 
express about Berawan notions of 
life and death; how they are ma- 
nipulated by influential men in their 
struggles for power; how they relate 
to their sense of identity, art forms, 
and oral history. Meanwhile, I have 
also explored the literature on 
American death ways — and have 
found it wanting. For the most part, 
it is restricted to consideration of 



psychological variables — how peo- 
ple react to death, either the 
possibility of their own or that of 
close relatives and friends. None 
of these studies begins to explain 
why American funerals are the way 
they are; why they differ from 
British funerals, for instance. 

Jessica Mitford, author of The 
American Way of Death, tried to 
explain the form that American 
funerals take by arguing that they 
are a product of the death industry&apos;s 
political power. But Mitford&apos;s 
theory does not explain the tacit 
support that Americans give to this 
institution, why successive im- 
migrant groups have adopted it, or 
why reform movements have failed. 

I have tried to relate American 
practices to popular ideas about the 
nature of a fulfilling life and a proper 
death. Despite these intellectual 
eflForts, I am left with a prickly 
sense of estrangement. For, in fact, 
I had spared my Berawan friends the 
more gruesome details of embalm- 
ing: replacement of the blood with 
perfumed formaldehyde and other 
chemicals; removal of the soft 
organs of the chest and abdomen 
via a long hollow needle attached to 
a vacuum pump; injection of inert 
materials. I did not mention the 
American undertaker&apos;s elaborate 
restorative techniques: the stitching 
up of mutilated corpses, plumping 
out of emaciated corpses with extra 
injections of waxes, or careful cos- 
metic care of hands and face. Nor 
did I tell the Berawan about the 
padded coffins, grave clothes rang- 
ing in style from business suits to 
negligees, and other funeral para- 
phernalia. Had I explained all this, 
their shock might have been trans- 
formed into curiosity, and they 
might have reversed our roles of 
social scientist and informant. 

In the meantime, something of 
their reaction has rubbed off on me. 
I have reduced the celebrated mor- 
tuary rites of remote and mysterious 
Borneo to a kind of workaday 
straightforwardness, only to be 
struck by the exotic character of an 
institution in our very midst.

Thecieam. The crop. 



Olympus introduced the OM-1 and 
startled the world of photography with the 
creation of the compact SLR, Today the OM 
System is still the cream of the crop. 

Because while others have emulated 
our compact design, OM cameras continue to 
offer features others can&apos;t. 

The OM-1 Becomes #1. 

Enter the OM-1. Suddenly the SLR 
camera is 33% smaller and lighter, yet incredibly 
rugged to meet the demands of professional 
wear and tear Miraculously the viewfinder is 70% 
brighter and 30% larger for faster, easier compos- 
ing and focusing. 

And suddenly, the OM-1 became the #1 
selling compact SLR. Its metering system is de- 
signed to give complete control to professionals 
and photojournalists. No distractions, blinking 
lights, or obscured images in the viewfinder 

A Quiet Revolution. 

Olympus created a unique shock 
absorber and air damper system to eliminate 
noise and vibration, for sharper, unobtrusive 
photography Especially vital for long tele shots 
and macro/micro photos. 

The Biggest Smallest System. 

More than 280 components, all com- 
pact design, include 13 interchangeable screens 
so you can meet any photographic challenge. 
Ingeniously designed to change in seconds 
through the lens mount. And more compact 



lenses than any other system, each a marvel of 
optical design and performance, 

Olympus &quot;Unlocks&quot; Motor Drive. 

OM-1 is still unsurpassed in its con- 
tinuous-view motor drive capability: 5 frames per 
second. And a Rapid Winder that fires as fast 
as 3 shots a second! With no mirror&quot;lock-uo.&quot; 
regardless of lens used. 

Enter The OM-2. Automatically. 

It&apos;s the fully automatic OM, with major 
differences from a// other automatics! The only 
SLR with &quot;off-the-film&quot; light measurement for 
those photographers demanding the ultimate 
innovation in automatic exposure control. Which 
means each frame in motor drive or rapid winder 
sequences is individually exposure-controlled. 
And it makes possible the unique Olympus 310 
Flash whose exposure duration is controlled by 
the camera&apos;s metering system. 

And of course, the OM-2 shares every 
other innovation and system component with 
the OM-1.

&quot;\ USED TO DESIGN 
RACING CARS BUT THE 

AUDI 5000 W\S 
A BIGGER challenge: 

AN INTERVIEW WITH FERDINAND PIECH,AUDI 5000 PROIECT DIRECTOR 




Sir, how long 
did you design 
racing cars? 



And you say 
designing 
a passenger car 
was more of 
a challenge? 



Piech: Ten years in all. I brought six 
cars from the drawing board to the 
race track and all six went on to win 
world championships. It was all very exciting. 

Piech: It was for me. A racing car can 
be designed to last for a few races 
only. But a passenger car obviously 
has to be designed to do much more 
and to last much longer In addition 
to excellent performance and handling I had to con- 
sider things like room, comfort and price. 

What about Piech; 1 was determined from the be- 

the price? ginningtoprovethatalargeGerman 

luxury sedan could be produced for under S9,000.* 

Piech: No. I don&apos;t think so. It was a 
question of eliminating unnecessary 
things. The greatest example of that 
is our five-cylinder engine. Five cyl- 
inders, because a four was too small 

for the weight of the car, and a six was too extreme. 

Designing the perfect engine for the vehicle can hardly 

be called making a compromise. 

Your racing back- Piech: Yes, yes. Very much so. The 
ground? Did it ^^y f^g ^^^^ ^QQQ handles, for in- 
come in handy? -^ .j,. ... .1 1 . 

stance. I he ride is not in the least bit 
mushy. Our suspension, our rack-and-pinion steering 



Well, you 
succeeded with 
price, but did that 
mean you had to 
compromise a lot? 



Is it possible to 
build a car with a 
soft, mushy ride, 
and still retain 
great responsive 
handling? 



and our weight distribution have a lot to do with that. 
Which is why we suggest that people pick a rainy or 
snowy day to take a test drive. This car is at its best 
when the weather is at its worst. 

Piech: No, notat all. They areexactly 
opposite. Some people feel that a soft, 
mushy ride is luxurious. We, the en- 
gineers at Audi, do not. We think it&apos;s 
tiring because you seem to be cor- 
recting the car&apos;s handling so often. We believe that a 
truly luxurious car is one that does what you want it to 
do when you want it to do it. That&apos;s why we engineered 
the Audi 5000 to be so precise and responsive. 

Piech: Like everything else, there are 
good things and bad things. The 
good things we tried to incorporate 
in the Audi 5000. More comfort. More room. To be 
quiet. To give it cruise control as standard equipment. 
And you can order a powei&quot;ful, American type air con- 
ditioning system for your places like Florida. 

Piech: 1 would say they can now buy 
a European car that was designed 
with American needs in mind. What 
we have tried to build is the one car 
that&apos;s the best of both worlds. I hope 
that doesn&apos;t sound, ah, what do you say., .corny? 



What do you 
think of 
American cars? 



Quickly, what 
would you say 
to convince 
Americans to buy 
an Audi 5000?

Flaws in a Victorian Veil 



Was America&apos;s premier 

naturalist a paragon 

of restraint and wisdom? 



The Victorians left some magnifi- 
cent, if lengthy, novels. They also 
foisted upon us a literary genre 
probably unmatched for tedium and 
inaccurate portrayal: the multivol- 
umed &quot;life and letters&quot; of eminent 
men. These extended encomiums, 
usually written by grieving widows 
or dutiful sons and daughters, mas- 
queraded as humbly objective ac- 
counts, as simple documentation of 
words and activities. If we accepted 
these works at face value, we would 



have to believe that eminent Vic- 
torians actually lived by the ethical 
values they espoused. Lytton 
Strachey&apos;s Eminem Victorians put 
this fanciful proposition to rest 
more than fifty years ago. 

Elizabeth Cary Agassiz — emi- 
nent Bostonian, founder and first 
president of RadcliflFe College, and 
devoted wife of America&apos;s premier 
naturalist — had all the right creden- 
tials for authorship (including a de- 
parted and lamented husband). Her 
Life and Correspondence of Louis 
Agassiz turned a fascinating, can- 
tankerous, and not overly faithful 
man into a paragon of restraint.

WITH WHAT MINOLTA KNOWS ABOUT CAMERAS 

AND WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT YOURSELF, 
WE CAN MAKE BEAUTIFUL PICTURES TOGETHER. 



If you&apos;ve considered buying a 35mm 
single lens reflex camera, you may have 
wondered how to find the right one 
out of the bewildering array of models 
and features available. 

And with good reason, since the 
camera you choose will have a lot to 
do with how creative and rewarding 
your photography will be. 

What you pay for your camera 
shouldn&apos;t be your only consideration, 
especially since there are some very 
expensive cameras that won&apos;t give you 
some of the features you really need. 
So ask yourself how you&apos;ll be using the 
camera and what kind of pictures 
you&apos;ll be taking. Yjur answers could 
save a lot of money. 

How automatic 
should your camera be? 
Basically, there are two kinds of auto- 
matic 35mm SLR&apos;s. Both use advanced 
electronics to give you perfectly 
exposed pictures with point, focus and 
shoot simplicity. TTie difference is in 
creative control. 

For landscapes, still lifes, portraits 
and the like, you&apos;ll want an aperCure- 
prrioricy camera. It lets you set the lens 
opening, while it sets the 



shutter speed automatically. 

This way, you control depth-of-field. 
That&apos;s the area of sharpness in front of 
and behind your subject. Many pro 
photographers believe that depth-of- 
field is the most important factor in 
creative photography. 

At times you may want to control 
the motion of your subject. You can do 
this with an aperture-priority camera 
by changing the lens opening until the 
camera sets the shutter speed necessary 
to freeze or blur a moving subject. Or 
you can use a shutxer-priority camera, on 
which you set the shutter speed first 
and the camera sets the lens automati- 
cally. 

Minolta makes both types of auto- 
matic cameras. The Minolta XG-7 is 
moderately priced and offers aperture- 
priority automation, plus fully manual 
control. The Minolta XD-11 is some- 
what more expensive, but it offers all 
the creative flexibility of both aperture 
and shutter-priority automation, plus 
full manual control. The XD-11 is so 
advanced that during shutter-priority 



operation it will actually make exposure 
corrections you fail to make. 

Do you really need an 
automatic camera? 
Automation makes fine photography 
easier. But if you do some of the work 
yourself, you can save a lot of money 
and get pictures every bit as gcxxl. 

In this case, you might consider a 
Minolta SR-T These are semi-auto- 
matic cameras. They have built-in, 
through-the-lens metering systems that 
tell you exactly how to set the lens and 
shutter for perfect exposure. You just 
align two indicators in the viewfinder. 

What to expect when you look 
into the camera&apos;s viewfinder. 
The finder should give you a clear, 
bright view of your subject. Not just in 
the center, but even along the edges 
and in the comers. Minolta SLR&apos;s have 
bright finders, so that composing and 
focusing are effortless, even in dim 
light. And focusing aids in Minolta 

Minolta makes ali kinds of 35mm SLR&apos;s, 
so our main concern is that you get 
exactly the right camera for your rweds. 
Whether that means the ad\&apos;aru:ed Minolta 
XD&apos;l I. Or the easy-to-use ar\d moderately 
priced Mirtolta XG-7. Or the very economi- 
cal Mirwlta SR-T camera.s. 





Automatic sequence 

photography is easy 

when you combine a 

Minolta XD- 11 or 

XG-7 with optional 

Auto Winder and Electmflash 200X. 

viewfinders make it easy to take criti- 
cally sharp pictures. 

Information is another thing you 
can expect to find in a well-designed 
finder. Everything you need to know 
for a perfect picture is right there in a 
Minolta finder. 

In the Minolta XD-11 and XG-7, 
red light emitting diodes tell you what 
lens opening or shutter speed is being 
set automatically and warn against 
under or over-exposure. In Minolta 
SR-T cameras, two pointers come 
together as you adjust the lens and 
shutter for correct exposure. 

Do you need an auto winder? 
You do if you like the idea of sequence 
photography, or simply want the lux- 
ury of power assisted film advancing. 
Minolta auto winders will advance one 
picture at a time, or continuously at 
about two per second. With advan- 
tages not found in others, like up to 
50% more pictures with a set of batter- 
ies and easy attachment to the camera 
without removing any caps. Optional 
auto winders are available for both the 
Minolta XD-11 and XG-7, but not for 
Minolta SR-T cameras. 

How about electronic flash? 
An automatic electronic flash can be 
added to any Minolta SLR for easy, 
just about foolproof indoor photog- 
raphy without the bother of flashbulbs, 
For the XD-1 1 and XG-7, Minolta 
makes the Auto Electroflash 200X. It 
sets itself automatically for flash expo- 
sure, and it sets the camera 
automatically for use with 
flash. An LED in the view- 
finder signals when the 
20QX is ready to fire. Most 



unusual: the Auto Electroflash 200X 
can fire continuously in perfect 
synchronization with Minolta auto 
winders. Imagine being able to take a 
sequence of 36 flash pictures without 
ever taking your finger off the button. 
You should be comfortable 
with your camera. 
The way a camera feels in your hands 
can make a big difference in the way 
you take pictures. 

The Minolta XD-1 1 and XG-7, for 
instance, are compact, but not 
cramped. Lightweight, but with a solid 
feeling of quality. Oversized controls 
are positioned so that your fingers fall 
naturally into place. And their elec- 
tronically controlled shutters are 
incredibly smooth and quiet. 

Minolta SR-T&apos;s give you the heft 
and weight of a slightly larger camera, 
but with no sacrifice in handling con- 
venience. As in all Minolta SLR&apos;s, 
&quot;human engineering&quot; 
insures smooth 
effortless 
operation. 
Are extra 
features 
important? 
If you use 
them, there 
are a lot of 

extras that can make your 
photography more creative and 
convenient. Depending on the Minolta 
model you choose, you can get: multiple 
exposures with pushbutton ease 



(even with an auto winder). A window 
to show that film is advancing prop- 
erly. A handy memo 
holder that holds the 
end of a film box to 
remind you of what 
film you&apos;re using. And 
a self-timer 
What about the lens 

system? 
TTie SLR you buy 
should have a system 
of lenses big enough 
to satisfy your needs, 
not only today, but 
five years from today. 
The patented Minolta bayonet mount 
lets you change lenses with less than a 
quarter turn. TTiere are almost 40 
Minolta lenses available, ranging from 
7.5mm fisheye to 1600mm super-tele- 
photo, including macro and zoom 
lenses and the world&apos;s smallest 
500mm lens. 




The etectrtmic i&lt;ieu/finder: LED&apos;s tell 
you what the camera i.s doing automati- 
cally to giiv you correct exposure. 







The match-needle viewfiruier: just 
align tu-o indicators for correct ex- 
posure. Because you&apos;re doing some of 
the work, you can sa^e some money. 

What&apos;s next? 

Think about how you&apos;ll use your 
camera and ask your photo dealer 
to let you try a Minolta. Compare 
it with other cameras in its price 
range. You&apos;ll soon see why more Ameri- 
cans buy Minolta than any other 
brand of SLR. For literature, write

Statesmanship, wisdom, and recti- 
tude. 

I write this column in the struc- 
ture that Louis Agassiz built in 1859 
— the original wing of Harvard&apos;s 
Museum of Comparative Zoology. 
Agassiz, the world&apos;s leading student 
of fossil fishes, protege of the great 
Cuvier, left his native Switzerland 
for an American career in the late 
1840s. As a celebrated European 
and a charming man, Agassiz was 
lionized in social and intellectual 
circles from Boston to Charleston. 
He led the study of natural history 
in America until his death in 1873. 

Louis&apos;s public utterances were 
always models of propriety, but I 
expected that his private letters 
would match his ebullient personal- 
ity. Yet Elizabeth&apos;s book, ostensi- 
bly a verbatim report of these let- 
ters, manages to turn this focus of 
controversy and source of restless 
energy into a most measured and 
dignified gentleman. 

Recently, in studying Louis Agas- 
siz&apos;s views on race, I discovered 
several interesting discrepancies 
between Elizabeth&apos;s version and the 
original letters. Elizabeth simply 
expurgated the text and didn&apos;t even 
insert ellipses to indicate her dele- 
tions. Harvard has the original let- 
ters, and a bit of sleuthing on my 
part turned up some spicy material. 

But first, Agassiz&apos;s public stance 
on human races. During the decade 
before the Civil War, Agassiz ex- 
pressed strong opinions on the 
status of blacks and Indians. As an 
adopted son of the north, he re- 
jected slavery, but as an upper-crust 
Caucasian, he certainly didn&apos;t link 
this rejection to any notion of racial 
equality. 

Agassiz presented his racial atti- 
tudes as sober and ineluctable de- 
ductions from first principles. Spe- 
cies are static, created entities (at 
his death in 1873, Agassiz stood vir- 
tually alone among biologists as a 
holdout against the Darwinian tide). 
They are not placed upon the earth 
in a single spot, but created simul- 
taneously over the entire range of 
their habitation. Related species are 
often placed in separate geographic 
regions, each adapted to prevailing 
environments of its own area. Since 
human races met these criteria be- 
fore commerce and migration mixed 
us up, each race is a separate bio- 
logical species. 

Thus, America&apos;s leading biologist 
came down firmly on the wrong side 



of a debate that had been raging in 
America for a decade before he ar- 
rived: Was Adam the progenitor of 
all people or only of white people&apos;? 
Are blacks and Indians our brothers 
or merely our look-alikes&apos;? In logic, 
separate needn&apos;t mean unequal, as 
the victors in Plessy v. Ferguson 
argued in 1896. But, as the winners 
in Brown v. the Topeka Board of 
Education maintained in 1954, a 
group in power always conflates 
separation with superiority. In fact, 
I know of no American &quot;polyge- 
nist&quot; — as advocates of separate 
species called themselves — who did 
not assume that whites were sepa- 
rate and superior. 

Agassiz insisted that his defense 
of polygeny had nothing to do with 
political advocacy or social preju- 
dice. He was, he argued, merely a 
humble and disinterested scholar: 

It has been charged upon the views 
here advanced that they tend to the sup- 
port of slavery. ... Is that a fair objec- 
tion to a philosophical investigation? 
Here we have to do only with the ques- 
tion of the origin of men; let the politi- 
cians, let those who feel themselves 
called upon to regulate human society, 
see what they can do with the results. 
. . . We disclaim all connection with any 
question involving political matters. . . . 
Naturalists have a right to consider the 
questions growing out of men&apos;s physi- 
cal relations as merely scientific ques- 
tions, and to investigate them without 
reference to either politics or religion. 

Despite these brave words, Agas- 
siz ends this major statement on 
race (published in the Christian 
Examiner. 1850) with some definite 
social recommendations. First he 
affirms the doctrine of separate and 
unequal: &quot;There are upon earth dif- 
ferent races of men, inhabiting dif- 
ferent parts of its surface . . . and 
this fact presses upon us the obliga- 
tion to settle the relative rank 
among these races.&quot; The resultant 
hierarchy is self-evident: &quot;The in- 
domitable, courageous, proud In- 
dian — in how different a light he 
stands by the side of the submis- 
sive, obsequious, imitative negro, 
or by the side of the tricky, cunning, 
and cowardly Mongolian! Are not 
these facts indications that the dif- 
ferent races do not rank upon one 
level in nature.&quot; Finally, if he 
hadn&apos;t made his political message 
clear by generalization, Agassiz 
ends by advocating specific social 
policy — thus contravening his origi- 
nal pledge to abjure politics for the

pure life of the mind. Education, he 
argues, must be tailored to innate 
ability; train blacks in hand work, 
whites in mind work. 

What would be the best education to be 
imparted to the different races in conse- 
quence of their primitive ditFerence. . . . 
We entertain not the slightest doubt that 
human affairs with reference to the 
colored races would be far more judi- 
ciously conducted if, in our intercourse 
with them, we were guided by a full con- 
sciousness of the real differences exist- 
ing between us and them, and a desire 
to foster those dispositions that are emi- 
nently marked in them, rather than by 
treating them on terms of equality. 

Since these &quot;eminently marked&quot; 
dispositions are submissiveness, 
obsequiousness, and imitation, we 
can well imagine what Agassiz had 
in mind. 

Agassiz had political clout, 
largely because he spoke as a scien- 
tist, supposedly motivated only by 
the facts of his case and the abstract 
theory they embodied. In this con- 
text, the actual source of Agassiz&apos; s 
ideas on race becomes a matter of 
some importance. Did he really 
have no ax to grind, no predisposi- 
tion, no impetus beyond his love 
for natural history? The deleted 
passages from Life and Correspon- 
dence shed considerable light. They 
show a man with strong prejudices 
based primarily on immediate vis- 
ceral reactions and deep sexual 
fears. 

The first passage, almost shock- 
ing in its force, even 130 years later, 
recounts Agassiz&apos;s first experience 
with black people (he had never en- 
countered blacks in Europe). He 
first visited America in 1846 and 
sent his mother a long letter detail- 
ing his experiences. In the section 
on Philadelphia, Elizabeth Agassiz 
records only his visits to museums 
and the private homes of scientists. 
She expunges, without ellipsis, his 
first impression of blacks — a vis- 
ceral reaction to black waiters in a 
hotel restaurant. In 1846 Agassiz 
still believed in human unity, but 
this passage exposes an explicit, 
stunningly nonscientific basis for 
his conversion to polygeny. For the 
first time, then, without ellipsis: 

It was in Philadelphia that I first found 
myself in prolonged contact with ne- 
groes; all the domestics in my hotel 
were men of color. I can scarcely ex- 
press to you the painful impression that 
I received, especially since the senti- 
ment that they inspired in me is contrary 



to all our ideas about the confraternity 
of the human type and the unique origin 
of our species. But truth before all. 
Nevertheless, I experienced pity at the 
sight of this degraded and degenerate 
race, and their lot inspired compassion 
in me in thinking that they are really 
men. Nonetheless, it is impossible for 
me to repress the feeling that they are 
not of the same blood as us. In seeing 
their black faces with their thick lips and 
grimacing teeth, the wool on their head, 
their bent knees, their elongated hands, 
their large curved nails, and especially 
the livid color of the palms of their 
hands, I could not take my eyes off their 
faces in order to tell them to stay far 
away. And when they advanced that 
hideous hand towards my plate in order 
to serve me, I wished I were able to de- 
part in order to eat a piece of bread else- 
where, rather than to dine with such 
service. What unhappiness for the white 
race — to have tied their existence so 
closely with that of negroes in certain 
countries! God preserve us from such a 
contact! 

The second set of documents 
comes from the midst of the Civil 
War. Samuel Howe, husband of 
Julia Ward Howe (author of The 
Battle Hymn of the Republic) and a 
member of President Lincoln&apos;s In- 
quiry Commission, wrote to ask 
Agassiz his opinion about the role of 
blacks in a reunited nation. During 
August 1863, Agassiz responded in 
four long and impassioned letters. 
Elizabeth Agassiz bowdlerized 
them to render Louis&apos;s case as a 
soberly stated opinion (despite its 
bizarre content), derived from first 
principles and motivated only by a 
love of truth. 

Louis argued, in short, that races 
should be kept separate lest white 
superiority be diluted. This separa- 
tion should occur naturally since 
mulattoes, as a weak strain, will 
eventually die out. Blacks will leave 
the northern climates so unsuited to 
them (since they were created as a 
separate species for Africa); they 
will move south in droves and will 
eventually prevail in a few lowland 
states, although whites will main- 
tain dominion over the seashore and 
elevated ground. We will have to 
recognize these states, even admit 
them to the Union, as the best solu- 
tion to a bad situation; after all, we 
do recognize &quot;Haity and Liberia.&quot; 

Elizabeth&apos;s substantial deletions 

display Louis&apos;s motivation in a very 

diflferent light. They radiate raw fear 

and blind prejudice. She systemat-

All binoculars magnify, but not all render objects visible under poor 
lighting conditions. It tal&lt;es binoculars withi ttie light transmission, image 
quality, resolution and color fidelity of Zeiss to bring the bird in the bush 
into view with every detail as real and accurate as the bird in the hand. 

So if you&apos;re the kind of naturalist to whom identification accuracy is 
important, Zeiss is important to you. You&apos;ll especially appreciate the Zeiss 
high degree of light transmission-87% compared with 50% of most other 
binoculars. You&apos;ll find this especially helpful in the woods, where light is 
subdued at best. 

Best of all, all Zeiss binoculars are guaranteed for life— the only binoc- 
ular carrying such a guarantee.

Henry E. Gardiner 



if. 




ically eliminates three itinds of 
statements. First, she omits the 
most denigrating references to 
biacics: &quot;In everything unhke other 
races,&quot;&quot; Louis writes, &quot;they may 
but be compared to children, grown 
in the stature of adults, while retain- 
ing a childlike mind.&quot; Second, she 
removes all elitist claims about the 
correlation of wisdom, wealth, and 
social position within races. In 
these passages, we begin to sense 
Louis&apos;s real fears about miscege- 
nation. 

I shudder from the consequences. We 
have already to struggle, in our prog- 
ress, against the influence of universal 
equality, in consequence of the diffi- 
culty of preserving the acquisitions of 
individual eminence, the wealth of re- 
finement and culture growing out of 
select associations. What would be our 
condition if to these difficulties were 
added the far more tenacious influences 
of physical disability. Improvements in 
our system of education . . . may sooner 
or later counterbalance the effects of the 
apathy of the uncultivated and of the 
rudeness of the lower classes and raise 
them to a higher standard. But how 
shall we eradicate the stigma of a lower 
race when its blood has once been al- 
lowed to flow freely into that of our 
children. 

Third, and of greatest signifi- 
cance, she expunges several long 
passages on interbreeding that place 
the entire correspondence in a dif- 
ferent setting from the one she fash- 
ioned. In them, we grasp Louis&apos;s in- 
tense, visceral revulsion toward the 
idea of sexual contact between 
races. This deep and irrational fear 
was as strong a driving force within 
him as any abstract notion about 
separate creation: &quot;The production 
of half-breeds,&quot; he writes, &quot;is as 
much a sin against nature, as incest 
in a civilized community is a sin 
against purity of character. ... I 
hold it to be a perversion of every 
natural sentiment.&quot; 

So strong is this natural aversion 
that abolitionist sentiment cannot 
reflect any innate sympathy for 
blacks but must arise because many 
&quot;blacks&quot; have substantial amounts 
of white blood and whites instinc- 
tively sense this part of themselves: 
&quot;I have no doubt in my mind that 
the sense of abhorrence against 
slavery, which has led to the agita- 
tion now culminating in our civil 
war, has been chiefly if uncon- 
sciously fostered by the recognition 
of our own type in the offspring of 
southern gentlemen, moving among 



us as negros [sic], which they are 
not.&quot; 

But if races naturally repel each 
other in matters sexual, how then 
do &quot;southern gentlemen&quot; take such 
willing advantage of their bonded 
women? Agassiz blames the mu- 
latto house slaves. Their whiteness 
renders them attractive; their black- 
ness, lascivious. The poor, innocent 
young men are enticed and en- 
trapped. 

As soon as the sexual desires are awak- 
ening in the young men of the South, 
they find it easy to gratify themselves by 
the readiness with which they are met 
by colored [mulatto] house servants. 
[This contact] blunts his better instincts 
in that direction and leads him gradually 
to seek more spicy partners, as I have 
heard the full blacks called by fast 
young men. One thing is certain, that 
there is no elevating element whatever 
conceivable in the connection of indi- 
viduals of different races; there is 
neither love, nor desire for improve- 
ment of any kind. It is altogether a 
physical connection. 

How a previous generation of 
gentlemen overcame their aversion 
to produce the first mulattoes, we 
are not told. We cannot know in de- 
tail why Elizabeth chose her dele- 
tions. I doubt that a conscious de- 
sire to convert Louis&apos;s motives 
from prejudice to logical implica- 
tion prompted all her actions. Sim- 
ple Victorian prudery probably led 
her to reject a public airing of any 
statement about sex. In any case, 
her deletions did distort Louis 
Agassiz&apos; s thought and did render his 
intentions according to the falla- 
cious and self-serving model fa- 
vored by scientists — that opinions 
arise from dispassionate surveys of 
raw information. 

These restorations show that 
Louis Agassiz was jolted to con- 
sider the polygenist theory of races 
as separate species by his initial, 
visceral reaction to contact with 
blacks. They also demonstrate that 
his extreme views on racial mixing 
were powered more by intense sex- 
ual revulsion than by any abstract 
theory of hybridity. 

Racism has often been buttressed 
by scientists who present a public 
facade of objectivity to mask their 
guiding prejudices. Agassiz&apos;s case 
may be distant, but its message 
rings through our century as well. 

Stephen Jay Gould teaches biology, 
geology, and the history of science 
at Harvard University.

modern classic. 

This classic quality takes a new form in 
the compact Nikon FM. Smaller and lighter 
than any previous Nikon, it conveys the 
unmistakable feel of Nikon precision. You 
become quickly aware of its perfect balance 
in your hands and of its swift, smooth 
responsiveness— qualities that make the FM 
a joy to handle. You can rely on the accuracy 
of its electronic exposure control system with 
its advanced, super-sensitive gallium photo 
diodes, which reduces correct exposure 
setting to near-foolproof simplicity. And, 
as you sight through the big, brilliant 
viewfinder, you feel the confidence that 
inspires Nikon users in their pursuit of 
photography at its finest. 



You will find your confidence fully borne 
out by the wide-ranging, yet easy to use 
capabilities built into the Nikon FM and by 
the magnificent image quality of its Nikkor 
lens. And, these capabilities are easily 
expanded by the famous Nikon system which 
puts more than fifty-five lenses and hundreds 
of accessories, including a motor drive, at 
your disposal. 

The Nikon FM is one modern classic that 
is easy to afford. Let your Nikon dealer put 
one into your hands (you&apos;ll find him in the 
Yellow Pages). Ask him also about the 
traveling Nikon School. Or write for LitlPak

A Matter of Taste 



by Raymond Sokolov 



Montezuma&apos;s Bequest 



Spanish conquistadors 
found the Aztecs 
drinking chocolate 



Yes. It took four men, all four a-blaze 
with gorgeous decoration, and the chief 
of them unable to exist with fewer than 
two gold watches in his pocket, emula- 
tive of the noble and chaste fashion set 
by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy 
chocolate to Monseigneur&apos;s lips. One 
lacquey carried the chocolate pot into 
the sacred presence; a second, milled 
and frothed the chocolate with the little 
instrument he bore for that function; a 
third, presented the favoured napkin; a 
fourth (he of the two gold watches), 
poured the chocolate out. It was impos- 
sible for Monseigneur to dispense with 
one of these attendants on the chocolate 
and hold his high place under the admir- 
ing Heavens. Deep would have been the 
blot upon his escutcheon if his choco- 
late had been ignobly waited upon by 
only three men; he must have died of 
two. 

Charles Dickens, A Tale of 
Two Cities. Chapter VII 

In the twenty years since I first 
read that luxurious description of 
an eighteenth-century French 
chocolate ritual, it has stuck in my 
mind as a prime example of how, in 
modern times, privileges and expe- 
riences once open only to aristo- 
crats and millionaires have spread 
and turned into commonplace en- 
joyments for ordinary people. 
Chocolate today is no longer a spe- 
cial food. The poorest urchins gob- 



ble it unceremoniously in candy 
bars and junk pastries. It snaps, 
crackles, and pops in breakfast 
cereals. Perhaps the last time any 
civilized human .being thought of 
chocolate as a rare commodity was 
in Europe during World War II, 
when American GIs won the hearts 
and minds of French children by 
passing out Hershey bars. Hitler 
had not been able to change the fact 
that chocolate came only from 
tropical countries not under Nazi 
domination. 

Now produced almost anywhere 
in the world with a mean annual 
temperature of 80° F, chocolate was 
originally &quot;discovered&quot; by the 
Spanish conquistadors in Mexico. 
Montezuma&apos;s household reportedly 
went through 2,000 jars a day. It 
spread quickly to Europe, in the 
form the Aztecs used, as a bev- 
erage. &quot;Chocolate&quot; is a corruption 
of the Nahuatl word chocolatl (a 
combination of the Aztec root for 
chocolate and the word for water). 
It took a while longer for solid 
chocolate confections to work their 
way into the Western menu. In any 
case, chocolate consumption seems 
to have developed somewhat later 
in England than on the Continent. 
The first reference to beverage 
chocolate in the Oxford English 
Dictionary dates to 1604. Despite 
his immense working vocabulary, 
Shakespeare did not mention 
chocolate at all. Pepys went to a 
coffeehouse in 1664 &quot;to drink joco- 
latte&quot; and found this still novel 



drink &quot;very good.&quot; Confectionary 
chocolate does not crop up in Eng- 
lish until 1659. 

Like many foods imported to 
Europe at high cost from the New 
World, chocolate confused people. 
This is why we have inherited the 
barbaric word &quot;cocoa,&quot; the result 
of an ignorant blurring of &quot;coco- 
nut&quot; with the generic term for the 
chocolate plant, which is, properly, 
&quot;cacao.&quot; Cacao reflects the 
Nahuatl word for the seeds or beans 
from which we get chocolate — 
cacahuatl. Today, its vernacular 
descendant, cocoa, is normally ap- 
plied to powdered, partly defatted 
chocolate and to the drink made 
from it. This is one time when it 
might make sense to put the scien- 
tific name into general use. Lin- 
naeus chose well. Theobroma 
cacao not only pays tribute to Aztec 
beginnings but also the genus name, 
meaning &quot;divine food,&quot; reflects 
chocolate&apos;s high place in everyone&apos;s 
estimation. 

At any rate, chocolate does grow 
on trees. T. cacao is fairly short, 
rarely exceeding twenty-five feet, 
and produces clusters of small 
flowers both on its main branches 
and, strangely, on its trunk. Nor- 
mally, each cluster of flowers turns 
into a single fruit in the form of a 
purplish yellow pod, 7 to 10 inches 
long and 3 to 4&apos;/i inches in diameter, 
with a hard rind marked by ten ele- 
vated longitudinal ribs. Inside the 
pod are five cells, each containing

No camera, no matter how 
expensive, fast or well-made it is, 
can perform better than the film 
inside it. That&apos;s why we recom- 
mend high-speed Kodacolor 400 
film for today&apos;s high-speed 
35 mm cameras. Kodacolor 400 
film is so fast and versatile, you 
can get the kind of color prints 
you couldn&apos;t get before, without a 
flash. You can stop speeding ath- 
letes in their tracks, shoot in 
museums, theaters and arenas, 
and snap away from before dawn 
through high noon to after 
dusk. All in clear, sharp, beautiful 
color prints with a grain that&apos;s 
surprisingly fine. 

So if you want to get it and 
get it right in existing light, just 
add 400 to 35. Because if you 
didn&apos;t compromise on your 
camera, you certainly shouldn&apos;t 
compromise on your film. 




Kodacolor 400 film is so fast, you can 
take stop-action 35 mm pictures indoors 
and outdoors, without a flash. More natural- 
looking pictures, because you&apos;re using 
existing light instead of altering the light.

five to twelve seeds embedded in 
soft, light-pink acid pulp. 

The seeds are the valuable part of 
the plant, the source of chocolate. 
The Aztecs bagged them in standard 
quantities and used the bags as a 
form of currency. It takes five years 
before a cacao tree will fruit — five 
years of steady warmth, good rain- 
fall, and shade. In the tropical areas 
suitable for cacao, shade is the rar- 
est of these necessary conditions, 
and rows of cacao are commonly 
interplanted with shade plants, such 
as bananas and cassavas, or perma- 
nent shade trees, such as the coral 
tree, known fittingly as mad re del 
cacao. 

Once the cacao pods are ripe, 
they are broken open and the seeds 
are extracted. In the first step of 
processing, the seeds are allowed to 
ferment or &quot;sweat&quot; for up to twelve 
days. This destroys the mucilage 
on them, reduces their bitterness, 
and lets their color change to a cin- 
namon brown. Next, the seeds are 
dried and cured, after which they 
are roasted in rotating iron drums at 
260° to 280° F. This develops the 
chocolate aroma, converts natural 
starch to dextrin, and further re- 
duces bitterness. Finally, the seeds 
are crushed and winnowed to re- 
move the shells and germs. The re- 
sult is a rich, dark sort of edible 
gravel called cocoa nibs. 

To make chocolate from nibs, 
manufacturers add sugar and flavor- 
ings such as vanilla. By then, the 
chocolate has become a semiliquid 
mass, which can be molded into tab- 
lets and sold to small, greedy chil- 
dren who like to smear it on their 
hands and faces, as well as to adults 
who restrain their avarice only long 
enough to convert chocolate into a 
mousse. 

Such chocolate is considered too 
rich to drink, and so hydraulic 
presses squeeze out some of the fat, 
or cocoa butter, before beverage 
chocolate is pulverized into cocoa. 

The leftover cocoa butter is, of 
course, not thrown away. It is par- 
ticularly valued in the pharmaceuti- 
cal and cosmetic industries because 
it is solid at room temperature but 
hquid at body heat (98.6° F). 

Not only the fat but also the 
shells of cacao seeds have a use. 
They can be brewed with water to 
make an ersatz coflFee, miserabile. 
or they can be fed to cattle. The 
shells also contain theobromine, a 
bitter, white crystalline compound. 



which is closely related to caflFeine 
and whose salts and derivatives are 
valued as diuretics. 

Cooks, however, are primarily in- 
terested in less exotic byproducts of 
T. cacao, various types of commer- 
cially available chocolate, which are 
oflRcially defined in this country. 
The cocoas, for instance, are rated 
according to their fat content. 
Breakfast cocoa has a minimum of 
22 percent; regular cocoa contains 
between 10 and 22 percent; and low- 
fat cocoa is less than 10 percent fat. 

Chocolate regulation is more 
complex. Sweet chocolate must 
contain at least 15 percent choco- 
late liquor or plain processed choco- 
late. Milk chocolate must have 10 
percent chocolate liquor and 12 per- 
cent whole-milk solids. In some 
varieties, the milk-solid component 
can run as high as 22 percent. Sugar 
content ranges widely for the vari- 
ous types of chocolate. Semisweet 
chocolate is usually 40 percent 
sugar, by weight. Instant cocoa can 
contain 80 percent sugar. Further- 
more, virtually all commercial 
chocolate has been manipulated 
structurally so that it will perform 
specific tasks more efficiently and 
attractively. For example, choco- 
late used to coat ice cream com- 
monly has vegetable oil instead of 
cocoa butter worked into it. 

Chocolate processing, in one way 
or another, dates almost from the 
beginning of its consumption. Ac- 
cording to such sixteenth-century 
observers as Fray Bernardino de 
Sahagiin, Aztec aristocrats mixed 
chocolate with honey or purple 
flowers. In modern Mexico, where 
grind-your-own-chocolate places 
still exist — and probably reflect 
antique custom — the method of 
manufacture also involves a simple 
form of admixture and processing. 
Diana Kennedy writes: 

The townswomen and the peasants 
from the countryside [of Oaxaca] buy 
their kilos of cacao beans, and a certain 
quantity of sugar and almonds to go 
with them, depending on what they can 
aiford — if they are very poor, then they 
buy fewer cacao beans and almonds and 
more sugar. Each woman picks up a 
zinc tub, which she places under one of 
the several grinding machines around 
the store. The cacao and almonds are 
poured into the hopper, and very soon a 
satiny, tacky chocolate sauce oozes out 
of the spout — which has been sprinkled 
with sugar so that none will stick and be 
wasted — and falls onto the pile of sugar 



in the tub below. The women have 
brought with them two large wooden 
spoons to mix it all well together, and 
some even have brushes so that not one 
speck of the valuable chocolate is left 
sticking to the metal. Then the choco- 
late is carried to another machine for a 
second grinding — this time with the 
sugar — and it is at this point that you 
persuade someone to let you stick your 
finger in and try. It is then carried home 
and set to dry in small molds in the sun. 

Mexican chocolate, even that 
available commercially in this coun- 
try, is a wonderful blend of similar 
elements. I am partial to a kind 
flavored, in the style of Hispanic 
chocolate everywhere, with cinna- 
mon. This is the oldest known 
flavoring for chocolate. I first 
learned of the cinnamon-chocolate 
combination reading Elizabeth 
David&apos;s Spices, Salt and Aromatics 
in the English Kitchen, in which she 
gives a recipe for a cinnamon- 
spiked, egg-white souflfie called 
&quot;chocolate chinchilla.&quot; She also 
laments the triumph of vanilla over 
cinnamon as the principal flavoring 
of commercial chocolate. More re- 
cently. Miss David has wrung her 
distinguished hands about chocolate 
once again. In her new and extra- 
ordinary English Bread and Yeast 
Cookery, she laments the passing of 
the &quot;crude, rather gritty chocolate&quot; 
of thirty years ago. &quot;Chocolate 
processing techniques have reached 
so fine a stage that the remembered 
texture has gone, and with it some 
of the character.&quot; To soothe the 
appetites of lovers of Elizabeth 
David and/or chocolate. I append a 
slightly adapted version of her 
recipe for chocolate rolls. 

Otherwise, it seems pointless to 
run through the overly familiar 
chocolate repertoire, limited as it is 
almost entirely to delicious, but 
completely domesticated, desserts: 
puddings and cakes and icings; 
malteds, candies, and other sweets. 
Two exceptions come to mind. That 
Mexican extravaganza turkey in 
mole poblano contains one small 
piece of chocolate in a rich, chili- 
spiced sauce. Also, some versions 
of pumpernickel bread take their 
dark color from chocolate, without 
taking on the flavor of chocolate 
any more than does the Aztec tur- 
key dish. Finally, however, lest you 
think I am only interested in re- 
cherche uses of chocolate, I want 
to make a plug for the frozen, 
chocolate-covered bananas sold by

For the foreseeable future, no one 
form of energy can meet all our needs. 

We don&apos;t have enough domestic

today. Nuclear energy, at least in this 
century, can&apos;t generate all our 
electricity. 

So the energy we need must come 
from a combination of sources. 



At Conoco, we produce the key 
fuels— oil, natural gas, coal and 
uranium. And what we learn in the 
process helps us develop new 
sources as well. 

We&apos;re working on ways to produce 
oil from tar sands and ways to change 
coal into synthetic gas and oil. We&apos;re 
also working on methanol, derived 



from coal or natural gas, as an alter- 
native to present-day liquid fuels. 
Because mankind needs more 
than one form of energy, we need to 
make more than one kind of effort.

The most remarkable collection of world coins ever assembled 

Coins of all Nations 

A complete and comprehensive collection containing a fascinating 
mint-fresh coin from every coin-issuing country in the world 




Limit: One collection per person 
Subscription deadline: June 30, 1978 

You have the unprecedented opportunity 
to acquire a collection of world coins 
unlike any that has ever been issued 
before. A collection that includes offi- 
cial monetary coins from the coin-issuing 
nations of the world— with each coin 
sealed in its own individual cachet, post- 
marked in the country of issue, 

This extraordinary collection will pro- 
vide every member of your family with 
a fascinating way to learn about nations 
and peoples in every part of the world — 
through their unique coinages. It will be 
a thoroughly pleasurable experience as 
well as an educational adventure. And 
in years to come, this distinctive coin 
collection is certain to become a prized 
family possession. 

By arrangement with government 
officials throughout the world 

To assemble the Coins of All Nations 
collection. The Franklin Mint is making 
special arrangements with the central 
banks or monetary authorities of more 
than 150 coin-issuing nations — and with 
the postal authority of each of those 
nations as well. Every nation that reg- 
ularly mints and issues coins will be 
represented in this collection, except 
where government regulations prohibit. 
The result will be a comprehensive col- 
lection of uncirculated mint-fresh coins 
that otherwise could only be assembled 
if one were to actually travel to every 
coin-issuing country in the world. 
The essential facts about the collection 
are these: 

• A single, mint-fresh coin from each of 
the nations in the world that issues 
coins will be included in this collection. 

• Each coin will be sealed in its own 
individual cachet, which has been 
designed and produced especially for 
the collection. 

• Each cachet will be officially stamped, 
date-canceled and postmarked in the 
country that issued the coin — and in 
the city where its treasury is located. 

• The entire collection will be issued in 
a single, limited edition — available by 
direct subscription only. 

This historic collection will not be 
made available through any dealers, 
retail stores or even from national banks 
here or abroad. It may be acquired only 
directly from The Franklin Mint and 
only until the world-wide deadline of 
June 30, 1978. 

Fascinating coins from distant lands 

Each coin will be both attractive and 




interesting in itself. The 50 Centavos 
piece of Mexico , bearing the portrait of 
the heroic Cuauhtemoc, last of the Aztec 
rulers. The 5 Paisa coin of Pakistan, an 
unusual four-sided coin with the star 
and crescent of the Moslem faith. The 
Papua New Guinea 1 Kina coin, depict- 
ing the rare sea crocodiles native only 
to this lush Pacific |and. The 2 Dollar 
coin of Hong Kong, featuring the famous 
coinage portrait of Queen Elizabeth II 
by Arnold Machin. The 50 Ore coin of 
Sweden, designed around the crowned 
monogram of King Gustaf VI Adolf. And 
the 5 Drachmai coin of Greece, bearing 
the image of the Greek philosopher 
Aristotle. More than 150 coins in all, 
each one telling a fascinating story. 

These monetary coins from all over 
the world will form a remarkable collec- 
tion. They will include coins of many 
shapes— round, square, triangular, oc- 
tagonal, even one with twelve sides. And 
coins minted in a wide variety of metals 
—as many as ten different coin metals in- 
cluding silver, bronze, copper and brass. 

Custom-designed albums provided 

To enable each subscriber to protect and 
display his collection, a set of hardbound 
library albums will be included. In addi- 
tion, authoritative reference information 
will accompany each cachet, describing 
the coin carried in that cachet and pro- 
viding background data about the coun- 
try that issued it. 

As a subscriber, you will receive your 
collection at the convenient rate of three 
cachets per month — sent to you in a 
protective mailing package. The price 
for each will be just $5.50. This includes 
the mint-fresh coin, the cachet, the

Petra of the 
Nabataeans 

by Philip C. Hammond 



New excavations suggest 
that Nabataean builders 
borrowed Pompeiian styles 



For years, tourists by the thou- 
sands have filed through the Siq, a 
narrow, twisting mountain gorge, to 
reach the ruins of Petra in the 
Jordanian desert. In this ancient 
Nabataean city, exquisitely detailed 
architectural splendors, such as the 
Treasury of the Pharaoh and the 
Palace Tomb, have been cut out of 
the sandstone cliffs. But these re- 
mains have provided visitors with 
only half a picture of the complex- 
ity of Petra. While previous excava- 
tions had cleared tombs and graves, 
the dwellings, and hence the life 
styles of the people, were left to the 
imagination. Excavations over the 
past four years, however, have re- 
placed theory with substance. 

Petra, the capital city of the 
Nabataeans, has long been a choice 
archeological site. The earliest his- 
tory of the area ties it to the biblical 
Edomites and the execution of 
10,000 of them by King Amaziah of 
Judah. Centuries later, the region 
was populated by the Nabataeans, 
originally sea pirates, then land 
brigands and desert nomads, and 
later, traders, who by the first cen- 
tury B.C. controlled the territory 
from the northern tip of the Red Sea 
to the northern tip of the Dead Sea. 
They also controlled the caravan 
routes to China, India, Syria, and 
Egypt. By the beginning of the 
Christian Era the influence and 
power of the Nabataeans under 
Aretas IV (9 b.c.-a.d. 40) sur- 
passed that of all other people in 
the area. 



Even after the Romans had sub- 
jugated the surrounding regions, 
the Nabataeans, while nominally 
under Rome&apos;s control, avoided 
their intervention and taxes for 
almost a century and a half. But in 
A.D. 106 the Roman emperor Trajan 
managed to cross the Transjordan- 
ian desert and enter Petra. The con- 
quest broke the Nabataean trade 
empire and, with it, the Nabataean 
spirit. Although the Byzantines re- 
stored a tomb for Christian worship, 
and the Crusaders later built a 
fortress outside the city&apos;s entrance, 
Petra&apos;s importance ended and all 
mention of it in historical records 
ceased. 

Not until the nineteenth century 
did interest in the city revive, this 
time due to explorers, adventurers, 
and later, to archeologists, rather 
than to conquerors. As word of 
Petra&apos;s glories reached beyond the 
barren land surrounding it, visitors 
began coming to the site to view the 
monuments left by the Nabataeans. 
In 1929, the first serious archeolog- 
ical expedition began excavating 
the site. Almost a half-century later 
the excavations continue — a tribute 
to Petra&apos;s complexity and past im- 
portance. 

Virtually all excavations to date 
have concentrated on the discovery 
and cataloging of structures and 
artifacts. The study we began four

Decorated with inlaid marble 
and hard, painted plaster, the 
Qasr Bint Far&apos;un (Castle of 
the Daughter of the Pharaoh) 
was a Nabataean temple for 
the worship of Dhushara. 







years ago, however, focused on the 
Nabataeans as people. Supported 
by the University of Utah and the 
Jordanian government, and backed 
by funding from a Saudi Arabian 
businessman, excavations began at 
two sites chosen as a result of the 
first electronically instrumented 
survey of the area. The first site re- 
vealed a series of domestic struc- 
tures dating from the first to the 
mid-eighth century a.d. — the peak 
period of Nabataean and Late Ro- 
man occupation at Petra. The 



second site concealed a huge re- 
ligious building of skillful design and 
architecture that dated to the days 
of the major Nabataean kings. Con- 
veniently for archeological analysis, 
two earthquakes had long ago 
sealed the remains under tons of 
rubble and silt. 

Now, four years later, the history 
of the first area has been reduced to 
919 &quot;levels&quot; — the depositional evi- 
dence of the successive stages of 
its use (and disuse); its buildings, 
rebuildings, destructions, change 
of function, decoration, and re- 
decoration; and all the events that 
took place through time. Tied to 
these levels are artifacts represent- 
ing the archeologists&apos; accidental 
recovery of items made or used by 
the inhabitants. 

The description of each level and 
every artifact has been cataloged. 
But this is only the beginning of 
modern archeological processing. 



! 
for the meaning of these data must &apos; 

be sought. Why was an item there? 
What was it used for? Why did a 
wall buckle and fall? Where did a 
particular artifact come from? What 
was the purpose of enclosed space? 
In short, everyday life must be re- 
constructed from all of the data so 
that the processes of occupation 
can be understood. 

The presence of their pottery 
fragments at the lowest building 
levels indicates that the Nabataeans 
were the first to occupy the tower- 
ing sides and bed of the wadi, even 
though the biblical Edomites had 
lived earlier on top of one of the 
mountains ringing Petra&apos;s valley. 
The chronological position of the 
recovered pottery and the archi- 
tectural skill evident in the design 
of the earliest buildings suggest 
that the Nabataeans settled along 
the wadi bed quite some time after 
having first entered the area. The

urban center of Petra itself was 
probably settled at the end of the 
first century B.C. or early in the 
next century. 

A number of rebuildings, modifi- 
cations, and other manipulations of 
enclosed space tell us that one do- 
mestic building complex was used 
for a long period, changing from 
time to time to fit family needs and 
finances. Like most homes of the 
Middle East today, this early com- 
plex was probably surrounded by a 
fence wall. Inside the wall, at least 
part of the area was left open to the 
sky as a work area with a large 
hearth. As further evidence of this, 
excavators found a large grinding 
mortar propped against the stair- 
way leading up to the house. The 
floor of the courtyard was of clay, 
as were the interior floors of the 
house. Adjacent to the court, but 
within the house proper, was a 
pantry, set off by a clay-lined 



Gail Rubin 

closet. The house&apos;s interior walls 
were plastered, with some traces of 
paint still visible. The recovery of 
a dog&apos;s skeleton, crouched in a 
niche in the courtyard wall, may 
indicate that even then urban fam- 
ilies kept dogs either as pets or for 
security. The dog was apparently 
killed by falling debris when an 
earthquake overtook this first 
dwelling. 

Seemingly undaunted by disaster, 
another family of Petra built their 
home on the site, using the ruined 
walls of the earlier structure as the 
foundation for a new series of 
rooms. Throughout the first three 
centuries of the present era, the 
area was continuously occupied, 
again with changes dictated by need 



and living habits, until a severe 
earthquake struck in a.d. 350. That 
such continuity existed seems un- 
interesting until one realizes that 
when the armies of Trajan marched 
into Petra in a.d. 106 — seventy 
years after most of the rest of the 
Middle East had fallen to Roman 
forces — a mass exodus was be- 
lieved to have taken place. Some

Petra&apos;s defensibility , location, 
and water supply made it a major 
crossroads of trade from the 
fourth century B.C. through the 
first century A.D. 



archeologists believed that Petra&apos;s 
decline as a trading empire had 
begun even earlier, but our evi- 
dence completely contradicts these 
theories and even suggests a high 
level of private economic prosperity 
as late as the mid-fourth century. 
A pre-A.D. 350 coin hoard found in 
1976 also indicates that consider- 
able solvency continued. As an- 
other indication of prosperity, 
archeologists discovered the re- 
mains of a wooden closet that ap- 
parently disgorged its contents of 
imported dinnerware on the floor 
when the earthquake struck. That 
the residents could import such lux- 



The Monumental Gate on the 
Colonnade Street was erected to 
honor the visit of a Roman emperor. 
Like other structures at Petra, 
it was first attributed to the 
Romans, but archeologists now 
believe the Nabataeans built it. 



uries is another indication that Petra 
had not been reduced to poverty! 

After that time, however, the site 
was abandoned until the early 
eighth century, when it was used as 
a cemetery. A Christian church was 
probably built nearby. With the 
Islamic conquest, Petra ceased to 
be important; the Christian resi- 
dents were probably few in number 
and easily converted to the new 
faith. 

Architectural remains thus sup- 
ply information regarding continued 
occupations and the general use of 
the area. The contents of the levels 
permit even closer glimpses of life 



in those times. A statuette found in 
1975 suggests the housewife of the 
day — a woman dressed in a long 
robe, her long hair in a braid flow- 
ing down her back. The hearth in 
the courtyard was probably used in 
good weather. The large mortar 
found propped against the stairway 
was kept at hand for grinding grain 
to be made into bread. Fragments 
of pottery cups, bowls, plates, stor- 
age jars, cooking pots, and jugs tell 
us what could be expected in a well- 
run household of the day. Although 
relatively few represent luxury 
wares, the number and variety of 
vessels suggest an abundance to 
meet the serving, storage, and 
cooking needs of a fairly affluent 
family of that period. The location, 
of the house itself, in the very cen- 
ter of the city, reaffirms this. No 
evidence was forthcoming to sug- 
gest that the Roman occupation of 
Petra led either to the mass exodus 
of the population or to a marked 
decline in their standard of living. 
Expansions and changes in the 
architecture likewise reflect the 
same stability. 



Excavation of the cella of the 

Temple of the Winged Lions and 

the domestic site nearby suggests 

Petra was prosperous for at least 

300 years after Roman occupation.

Faintly hinted at, although diffi- 
cult to prove, is an air of femininity 
in the recovered remains. Jewelry, 
spindle whorls, needles, grinding 
stones, beads, and bone-tool frag- 
ments, along with the domestic na- 
ture of ceramic materials, empha- 
size the lack of male presence. A 
single die, with an unusual order of 
spots, is virtually the only artifact 
found with a masculine connota- 
tion. In a culture in which the cara- 
van traffic required prolonged ab- 
sence of a large proportion of the 
male population, any &quot;domestic&quot; 
situation may well have taken on a 
feminine complexion. 

Religion is another facet of life 
reflected in the material remains of 
the domestic site. Symbols of the 
worship of Dhushara, the ancient 
desert god of the people, and his 
acquired consort, Atargatis, the 
Syrian fertility goddess, would be 
expected. One would also expect

signs of Christianity to turn up in 
levels associated with the later 
Byzantine period. But we encoun- 
tered no Christian iconography at 
all, just evidence of the continua- 
tion of an indigenous cult — a minia- 
ture incense altar, a large house 
altar, and idols (some with glass 
eyes and one with copper eyes set 
in plaster) all reflect North Arabian 
cults, while other bits and pieces of 
cultic materials are more identifi- 
able with the Dhushara cult than 
any other. 

Religion is the focus of the sec- 
ond area being excavated, the Tem- 
ple of the Winged Lions. Although 
two other Nabataean temples have 
previously been excavated — at Et- 
Tannur on the old King&apos;s Highway 
and at Wadi Ramm in the eastern 
desert — this temple represents the 
first religious structure found un- 
derground and preserved in such a 
manner as to provide detailed infor- 
mation on its architecture, develop- 
ment, and decoration. 

Excavation of the building began 
in 1974 and its nature was identified 
by the end of that season. Each 
season has brought architectural 
surprises and individual finds that 
have confirmed the building&apos;s im- 
portance. The discoveries have 
added to the clarification of another

aspect of the formal religious life of 
the Nabataeans. 

Even in 1974 the cultic nature of 
the structure became clear as frag- 
ments of &quot;winged lions&quot; (ranging 
from ferocious-looking beasts to 
pussycat types) came to light and 
gave it its popular name. The floor 
plan was obvious, even though only 
a part of the structure had been un- 
covered. Two lines of columns 
ingeniously meshed, with semi- 
engaged columns flanking niches 
along the walls, divided the struc- 
ture into a vast hall with bays on 
each side and a built-up area in the 
center. 

By the end of the 1975 season, 
we had further determined that 
this area was an altar platform ap- 
proached by a stairway facing the 
wide front entrance. Paved floors 
and marble-faced lower walls were 
evidence of the richness of con- 
struction. But their opulence fades 
into relative insignificance before 
the splendid plaster decoration of 
the building, as evidenced by thou- 
sands of fragments of moldings, 
frescoes, affixes, and other decora- 
tive elements. On every side, color 
abounded from ceiling to floor. 

All of the side niches excavated 
in 1975 had been destroyed, so little 
sense could be made of the nature 
of the fresco panels. An &quot;eye- 
idol,&quot; with its Nabataean inscrip- 
tion almost complete, had toppled 
in front of one such niche, however. 
The inscription at its base pro- 
claimed that it had been placed in 
the temple in honor of &quot;the goddess 
of Hyn the son of Nybth.&quot; By the 
first century a.d., Atargatis, the 
consort of Dhushara, was the out- 
standing female deity, as the late 
Nelson Glueck had proved at Et- 
Tannur. Hence, this temple — 
obliquely across the wadi from the 
temple of Dhushara (known today 
as the Qasr Bint Far&apos;un) — could 
probably be assigned to her. 

In 1976, excavations on the 
southwest side of the temple were 
completed. Because of the direc- 
tion in which the temple wall had 
fallen, partially preserved wall 
niches and traces of the frescoes 
remained //; situ or in larger slabs 
on the floor. One of the finds was a 
portrait bust of a male, too faint to 
discern features, but giving an idea

of the commemorative type in- 
volved. From sections of the west- 
em wall, we assembled fragments 
showing figures clad in Greco- 
Roman dress very similar to that 
seen in the ritual scenes discovered 
at Pompeii. 

The rear side of the altar plat- 
form produced a closet with stone 
slab shelves at one end, probably 
for the storage of ritual parapherna- 
lia. Unfortunately, the closet had 
been cleared out sometime after the 
destruction of the temple. Rust 
stains at the front and a slot for an 
iron gate suggest that access to the 
platform was barred. 

At the end of that season another 
discovery further strengthened the 



attribution of the temple to Atar- 
gatis. In the main doorway area, we 
uncovered a carnelian ring-seal, 
perfectly preserved down to 
scratches on its sides from the 
prongs that once held it. Engraved 
on the seal was a nude goddess, 
wearing a polls crown (one repre- 
senting the wall of a city, usually 
showing the front gate) and riding a 
dolphin — the same figure has been 
found at both Et-Tannur and at 
Wadi Ramm. 

With the entire interior of the 
temple exposed, the 1977 season 
might have been somewhat anticli- 
mactic, but such was not the case. A 
surface survey in 1976 had strongly 
indicated that the temple had a

flanked both sides of the building, 
with their floors carried by massive 
arches. Flat, porchlike spaces ap- 
peared along the structure&apos;s front, 
with tremendous piles of fallen 
debris, including an entire column 
of more than a yard and a half in di- 
ameter. A marble-faced stairway, 
presumably leading to a landing at 
the level of the temple, ranalongthe 
outside of the western exterior wall. 
Entrance to the front of the build- 
ing, 450 feet from the bottom of the 
hill, was probably gained by this 
stairway, which was carried on a 
series of side arches. 

Holes in the front building blocks 
of the temple show that slabs of 



marble veneer had once faced it. 
Column drums, capital fragments, 
decorative carvings, and other ar- 
chitectural fragments strewn along 
the hill attest to the spectacle this 
building must have presented as 
worshipers made their way upward 
to its huge doors. 

In addition to cultic artifacts, we 
recovered a mass of data from this 
structure, showing how the building 
was put together. Hundreds of 
pounds of plaster fragments pointed 
to mass production of moldings and 
other elements, which were then 
affixed to stone by dozens of iron 
spikes and tiny copper tacks. Holes 
through the centers of column 
drums indicated how these massive 
stones were raised into place; dif- 
ferent cements and plasters showed 
technical skills to fit different build- 
ing needs; fragments of ceiling plas- 
ter, bearing the marks of cord- 
wrapped reeds, indicated interior 
finishing techniques; fragments of 
wood suggested methods of roof- 
ing; saw marks and engraved lines 
on stone fragments illustrated cut- 



ting and finishing methods; Naba- 
taean letters carved on stone blocks 
were used as a key for the trans- 
ferral of the architect&apos;s plans to the 
actual building operation; and in- 
triguing bonding devices showed a 
knowledge of stress. 

Information about Nabataean 
technology peaked in 1977 with the 
discovery, in one of the rooms 
formed by the side arches, of a 
complete painter&apos;s workshop — with 
raw pigments ready to be ground, 
plaster-strengthening material, and 
mixed plasters in red, green, blue, 
black, and white left in the bottom 
of pots. Some forty vessels were in 
the workshop cache, as well as mix- 
ing pots, funnels, and sieves.

manner of decoration, and the spe- 
cifics of building were generally 
known throughout the Hellenized 
Roman world of the first century 
A.D., but certain decorative details 
seem too specific to be accidental. 
Inscriptions attest that the far-flung 
commercial interests of the Naba- 
taeans had reached Roman Italy by 
the end of the first century B.C., and 
perhaps the commercial centers of 
Pompeii and Herculaneum were on 
the trade route as well. A lavishly 
painted tomb at El-Barid, adjacent 
to Petra, has been classified as 
Pompeiian and the decorative mo- 
tifs of the temple reflect a similar 
influence. Yet another Pompeiian- 
style plaster, painted to look like 
marble, shows up here, as does a 
preference for the colors in wall- 
fresco decoration found in later 
periods at Pompeii, along with very 
suggestive ritual scenes. Thus, 
direct or mediated influence may 
well be involved since Pompeii was 
at its height at about the same time 
that the Nabataean king Aretas IV 
was expanding his building opera- 
tions throughout Petra. We have 
attributed the construction of the 
Temple of Winged Lions to that 
monarch on the basis of stratig- 
raphy, numismatic and epigraphic 
evidence, pottery, and the eco- 
nomic situation. 

The discoveries made at the tem- 
ple complex reflect to a large extent 
the prosperity of the Nabataean 
empire. Good fortune continued 
after the reign of Aretas IV, but 
excavations have uncovered evi- 
dence that power was diminishing. 
Sometime during the reign of Are- 
tas&apos;s successor, Malichus I (a.d. 40 
to 70), the temple was refurbished 
with freshly plastered and painted 
columns and restored frescoes. But 
during this time, Rome was begin- 
ning to tighten the net around the 
Nabataean kingdom. That may be 
why the fresco panels were painted 
in only one color, unlike earlier 
frescoes with &quot;foreign&quot; motifs. 

Excavations showed that at a 
later period the roof of the temple 
burned and fell in. Although there 
apparently was no major damage, 
no attempt was made to rebuild the 
roof, suggesting a low period in the 
site&apos;s history. This situation fits 
into the final years of Rabbel II 



(a.d. 70 to 106) when Roman con- 
striction of trade routes must have 
affected the Nabataean economy, 
causing the king to desert his capi- 
tal and take up residence at Bosra 
in Syria. Respect for the sanctity 
of the temple site is obvious, but 
also obvious is apathy in restoring 
such a lavish structure. 

The earthquake of a.d. 350 was 
the final blow to the temple. Many 
of Petra&apos;s buildings crumbled and 
were never restored. Another 
earthquake in the mid-sixth century 
leveled the remaining structures. 
Fortunately for us, these catastro- 
phes preserved many artifacts and 
signs of the area&apos;s former use under 
the tons of rubble. 

Taken together, the two areas of 
excavation reflect both economics 
and natural disaster acting upon a 
population. At the same time, they 
provide other information — the 
eclecticism of Nabataean culture, 
the tremendous engineering and 
architectural skills, and the impact 
of the kingdom&apos;s main occupation, 
international trade, upon the life of 
the capital city. 

Such internationalism could 
hardly have been expected from a 
band of nomadic wanderers, as the 
Nabataeans appear to have been in 
the earliest historical accounts we 
have of them. But the occupation of 
Petra, the expansion of caravans, 
and the ability of these people to 
adapt to new technology and com- 
mercial possibilities forged them 
into a political and social body of 
major importance in Middle East- 
ern history. Recent knowledge of 
Chinese trade routes suggests that, 
along with the luxury products of 
Arabia (especially frankincense and 
myrrh), Egypt, Persia, and India 
(whose trade routes were linked to 
those of the Nabataeans), the 
wealth of ancient Cathay may also 
have moved westward, carried by 
Nabataea&apos;s caravan princes — mid- 
dlemen of the ancient world. D

Terns in TVaffic 



by Michael Gochfeld 



Sea birds can nest near 
people, if they are 
not harassed, stomped, 
or run over by cars 

Until the middle of the 
nineteenth century, common 
terns were abundant on Long 
Island, nesting each spring 
and summer on beaches, in 
grassy swales between dunes, 
on rocky bars, and on smaller 
offshore islands. But as New 
York City grew and expanded 
to Long Island, the stability of 
these large bird populations 
came to an end. Egging par- 
ties ravaged nesting sites, and 
market gunners and sports 
hunters killed thousands of 
terns, as well as other water 
bird species. 

Systematic exploitation of 
the remaining tern popula- 
tions to provide feathers for 



the Parisian millinery trade 
nearly gave the coup de grace 
to the species. From 1880 to 
about 1920, the shrieking cries 
of terns were rarely heard on 
Long Island. The strict con- 
servation law of 1913 came 
none too soon. The species 
had survived commercial 
exploitation on only a few 
remote islands, such as Gar- 
diners Island off the eastern 
tip of Long Island. Such iso- 
lated colonies provided stock 
from which the rest of Long 
Island, and much of the Atlan- 
tic coast, was repopulated. 

The recovery was gradual, 
but by the late 1950s the 
species was again widespread 
on Long Island, nesting from 
Brooklyn to Montauk. The 



revival was not to last, how- 
ever. Once again, man was 
responsible for the bird&apos;s de- 
cline, as the postwar boom in 
housing gobbled up suitable 
nesting areas. Although Long 
Island&apos;s reduced tern popula- 
tions are now more-or-less 
stable, the species still knows 
little peace. The weekend 
flotilla of pleasure and fishing 
boats in Great South Bay, for 
example, is a phenomenon 
that no breeding tern popula- 
tion can escape, except by 
leaving the area. Picnickers 
equipped with Frisbees, dogs, 



photographs by Allen Rokach 



baseballs, and even motor- 
cycles occupy every island 
and sand bar. 

Nevertheless, some nesting 
habitat still remains on Long 
Island — on sandy areas amid 
beach grass and seaside 



goldenrod, on spoil banks, 
and in salt marshes. But if the 
birds are to breed on solid 
ground, they must do so in 
protected places, such as the 
American Museum of Natural 
History&apos;s Great Gull Island 



and parts of Jones Beach 
State Park. 

I have conducted my re- 
search at two large colonies: 
at West End Beach in Jones 
Beach State Park and at Cedar 
Beach, twelve miles to the 



Common terns are excellent, 
almost tireless, fliers and 
spend many hours of the day 
aloft. They skim the ocean 
waves, often snatching 
small fish on the wing. 



east. Both areas are less than thirty 
miles from New York City. In re- 
cent years, each colony has had 
more than 2,000 pairs of nesting 
common terns (Sterna hirundo). 
The older colony, at West End 
Beach, is adjacent to a large public 
parking lot. On weekends and warm 
summer days, thousands of cars — 
carrying as many as 10,000 beach- 
goers — use the access road that 
curves through the colony. I have 
long been intrigued by the co- 
existence of birds and beachgoers, 
for one cannot help wondering how 
any wildlife could thrive amidst 
such bustling human activity. 

Common terns have one nesting 
peculiarity in their favor. They 
avoid unvegetated outer beaches 



(the areas most frequented by sun- 
bathers and swimmers) in favor of 
patches of beach grass and golden- 
rod. The least tern (Sterna albi- 
frons), a smaller species that pre- 
fers open, sandy beaches, is now 
considered threatened in the east, 
and the Pacific coast race is endan- 
gered — its numbers diminished by 
human recreational activities 
within its colonies and, perhaps, by 
pesticides as well. 

Human beachgoers also have 
strong preferences. They crowd 
together close to restaurants, rest- 
rooms, and other facilities. Seen 
from the air, the dispersion of hu- 
mans near the parking lot on West 
End Beach produces a bell-shaped 
curve characteristic of a &quot;normally 



distributed&quot; population. Only a few 
people frequent the dunes and 
beaches away from the parking lot 
and facilities, thus leaving the bird 
colony relatively free of human in- 
truders. The main contact between 
birds and people is the almost con- 
stant stream of automobile traffic 
on the road through the colony. On 
any summer day, however, in- 
stances of human intrusion into the 
colony do occur, and it is important 
to examine how birds and intruders 
react to each other. 

Common terns usually produce a 
clutch of three well-camouflaged 
brown and speckled eggs. The nest 
itself is a simple indentation in the 
ground, embellished during the in- 
cubation period with straw or bits of 




II 



shell. An uninitiated human in- 
truder or natural predator cannot 
easily see the eggs. Once one knows 
what to look for, however, hun- 
dreds of nests can be found in a 
short time. 

On rare occasions, people come 
to such colonies to collect eggs 
for food in the tradition of some 
European and South American cul- 
tures. Although such activities are 
strictly illegal, they do take place 
and can entirely eliminate a breed- 
ing population of birds. Fortunately 
the West End Beach colony, despite 
its accessibility, has not been sub- 
ject to egging. Vandalism, however, 
does occur. Footsteps are often 
seen leading into the colony and 
ending at a nest containing a broken 



egg. Perhaps this is due to a mis- 
placed foot or to simple curiosity — a 
desire to see what is inside an egg. 
But sometimes, the footsteps lead 
to a pile of wantonly broken eggs. 
Much rarer is the vandal who de- 
liberately kills the chicks. Some 
vandals have been known to enter 
a colony and shoot or stone the 
adult birds; in one case a person 
drove a beach buggy through a col- 
ony in an apparent attempt to de- 
molish nests. The colony at Breezy 
Point in Brooklyn was destroyed by 
vandals in 1972 when it contained 
2,000 pairs of common terns. A bird 
bander who periodically checked on 
the fortunes of that colony arrived 
one day to find the beach grass 
ablaze. Two adolescents told him 



The typical nesi of the common 
tern is only a scrape in the 
ground lined with plant and wood 
debris. But the birds are 
adaptable nesters, and on Great 
Gull Island in Long Island Sound, 
a colony nests among the traprocks 
of the shoreline. Because they 
avoid open, sandy beaches, the 
birds are less harassed by people 
than some other tern species.

that they had set the fire to see what 
the birds would do. As might be 
expected, the birds left. They joined 
the more secure colonies at West 
End and Cedar beaches. 

By nesting near a heavily used 
public area, the West End Beach 
terns may gain some protection 
from such destruction. Not only are 
the birds more or less in the public 
eye, but the area is regularly pa- 
trolled by police who chase in- 
truders out of the colony. During 
my work there, 1 have frequently 
been hailed by irate passers-by 
wanting to know why I am disturb- 
ing the birds. Such public interest, 
always encouraging and occasion- 
ally sobering to the field biologist, 
also affords protection to the terns. 
In addition, the State Park Commis- 
sion has placed signs outside the 
nesting area warning would-be 
trespassers to keep out. 

Nevertheless, there is still in- 
terference — by fishermen taking a 
shortcut to the bay and by curious 
visitors and photographers, not to 
mention biologists. Such disturb- 
ances entail some risk of direct 
damage to eggs or young, but their 
principal harm is that they keep 
adult birds away from their nests. 

The terns are not entirely help- 
less, however. In places where 
they are accustomed to human in- 
trusion, the birds lose their fear and 
do not hesitate to attack. They 
generally begin their defense when 
they sight someone approaching the 
colony. Usually a single bird or 
small group sounds the alarm, flying 
directly toward the intruder and 
uttering a particularly harsh, gut- 
tural call. At West End Beach, the 
entire colony of up to 5,000 common 
terns and 300 black skimmers nor- 
mally reacts to an intruder by rising 
in a swirling, screaming mass. The 
effect is startling and tends to turn 
away the uninitiated. 



Landing at its nest, a common 
tern prepares to settle down 
and incubate the clutch of 
speckled eggs. Cats, rats, gulls, 
and other predators take a toll 
of unguarded eggs and young. 



Within thirty seconds most of the 
terns will have resettled on their 
nests. Subsequent disturbances 
during the day produce only local 
reactions — 50 to 200 terns circling 
overhead and darting downward at 
the intruder while uttering the at- 
tack calls. Frequently, the birds 
discharge their foul-smelling, semi- 
liquid cloacal contents with remark- 
able accuracy. This proves aesthet- 
ically displeasing to most people, 
but it apparently does not deter 
natural predators. 

A few terns — more aggressive 
than the rest — may actually strike 
an intruder. These birds usually fly 
a steep, U-shaped path, diving for 
the head, pecking it vigorously, and 
rising up again to repeat the attack. 
An individual bird will strike re- 
peatedly every 2.7 to 3.2 seconds 
for a minute or two. When several 
birds are involved, a person could 
receive twenty to sixty blows a 
minute. The ferocity and frequency 
of attacks mount during the incuba- 
tion period, peaking when the eggs 
are hatching. On one June day, I 
estimated that I was struck more 
than 10,000 times; on most days in 
June, several thousand strikes is a 
typical reward for studying terns. 

The force of a tern&apos;s strike can 
draw blood, and protective head- 
gear is essential. A soft hat with an 
object on the top may divert the 
birds&apos; attention. During my field- 
work, I have worn pith helmets, 
but the birds poked holes through 
them after only three weeks of 
wear. I now use a plastic hard hat 
whose surface is heavily scarred 
and chipped from the numerous 
pecks it has received. Such aggres- 
sive defense must be viewed as a 
compromise between opposing se- 
lective forces, for on rare occa- 
sions a bird can injure itself by 
striking too hard. The greater risk 
of such aggression, however, is that 
a bird&apos;s eggs and chicks are un- 
protected when it joins an attack, 
and its nest may be subjected to 
predation or exposure. John 
Emlen, one of the progenitors of 
the study of behavioral ecology, 
has termed such behavior &quot;aggres- 
sive neglect.&quot; 

The effectiveness of the tern&apos;s 
aggressive defense is diflficult to 
measure, but one definite result is 



that it prevents many people from 
entering large colonies such as 
those at West End and Cedar 
beaches. Most individuals beat a 
hasty retreat as soon as the terns 
begin their attack. In smaller col- 
onies, the aggression is less in- 
tense, the umbrella of diving and 
screaming terns is less cohesive, 
and the deterrent effect is much 
diminished. 

The terns are also quick to mob 
such avian intruders as gulls and 
hawks that fly over a colony&apos;s air 
space, particularly if they are lower 
than seventy-five feet. Relatively 
few gulls, however, prey on tern 
eggs or chicks, at least in the two 
colonies I have studied. A Finnish 
biologist, Risto Lemmetyinen, has 
found that crows frequently at- 
tempt to prey upon young terns 
but are harshly attacked and driven 
oif by the aggressive adults. 

Although hawks and owls patrol 
the barrier beach at Jones Beach 
from time to time, they are rare 
during the summer. Foxes, rac- 
coons, opossums, skunks, and 
weasels, all potential predators, 
have been observed on the beaches 
in recent years. Rabbits are the only 
undomesticated species that passes 
through the nesting area with any 
frequency. The terns retaliate by 
vigorously mobbing the inoffensive 
animals, which dash frantically 
back and forth in an effort to avoid 
strikes. Yet, when dogs wander into 
the colony, the terns will mill about 
overhead, calling loudly but not 
attacking. Dogs can severely dam- 
age a tern colony, particularly once 
the chicks have hatched. Cats and 
rats also take a toll of both eggs and 
chicks. 

Other bird species take advan- 
tage of the terns&apos; aggressiveness, 
which can be taken as a sign of its 
effectiveness. Black skimmers, for 
example, regularly nest in tern col- 
onies, as do several duck species — 
mallards, old squaws, and tufted 
ducks. Apparently the nesting suc- 
cess of these species is enhanced 
by proximity to the terns. 

In most tern colonies the heavi- 
est losses occur when the chicks 
are only a few days old and vulner- 
able to predators. But owing to the 
lack of predators in the West End 
colony, the chicks pass through this

stage with a high rate of success. 
Tragedies abound a month later, 
however, when the chicks are 
learning to fly and crowd the access 
road to the beach&apos;s parking lot. 
Ordinarily, terns at this stage of de- 
velopment frequent open beaches 
and exercise their wings while their 
parents fish in the ocean beyond. 
At West End Beach, the smooth 
road serves as a substitute runway; 
during July and August hundreds 
of chicks rest on it and jump and 
flap along it to improve their flight 
capabilities. The learning process 
often ends suddenly and fatally as 
cars traveling to and from the beach 
unavoidably run over the birds. On 
a single day, there may be twenty or 
thirty squashed birds on the road 
and others with broken wings stand- 
ing helplessly on its edges. In one 
season, 1,400 fledglings, more than 
50 percent of the young, were killed 
in this manner. 

Paradoxically, fewer young birds 
are killed when the traffic is great- 
est. During these times — humid 
weekends in July — the constant 




60 



stream of cars crowds the birds off 
the road and the death toll is mini- 
mal. The mortality rate could be 
reduced by erecting drift fences 
along the road or placing bumps on 
it to slow traffic. Park officials are 
sympathetic to the perpetuation of 
the colony, and we hope they will 
institute such measures. 

When terns are repeatedly 
thwarted in their attempts to raise 
young, they move to another site. 
The failure of the West End Beach 
colony to grow appreciably in re- 
cent years may be due in part to the 
high numbers of fledglings killed. 
Some adults may have given up on 
the site and moved elsewhere. 

Although the tern populations on 
Long Island have remained stable in 
recent years, the dearth of suitable 



nesting habitat implies that the birds 
cannot tolerate too much more dis- 
ruption before they begin to decline. 
The terns in disrupted colonies have 
been forced to nest in marginal 
habitat such as salt marshes. Terns 
have long nested in salt marshes in 
both Europe and North America, 
but until a few years ago researchers 
did not realize that at least one-third 
of Long Island&apos;s terns used this 
habitat, which is still abundant 
along the island&apos;s shores and is 
relatively free from disturbance by 
humans. 

These birds make their nests on 
sea wrack — flat mats of dead cord 
grass. In some places, they lay their 
eggs on the partially flattened stems 
of salt marsh hay. This habitat, 
however, is a poor alternative to the 




more traditional beach colony sites. 
Tides frequently flood the mats of 
dead vegetation, which may break 
apart and drift away. Almost every 
salt marsh colony I have visited 
shows signs of significant flood 
damage. When disturbed, chicks 
may run ofiTthe edge of the mat. fall 
into the mud or water, and perish. In 
a few cases where the mats are on 
higher islands, rats thrive and make 
short work of eggs and young. 

On Lane&apos;s Island just west of 
Shinnecock Inlet, Paul and Fran- 
cine Buckley, on a survey for the 
National Park Service, found a 
thriving colony of common and 
roseate terns nesting on wrack. 
During subsequent annual visits to 
the colony, I have found abun- 
dant signs of rat damage and have 
observed that productivity is now 
essentially zero. The number of 
tern pairs has declined from 1,500 
to only 500. Roseate terns, a spe- 
cies that seeks dense cover for 
nesting, are particularly vulnerable 
to rats and have been almost en- 
tirely eliminated from Lane&apos;s 
Island. 

The future of terns on Long Is- 
land is grim if the salt marsh nest- 
ing option should become the only 
one available. Banding studies have 
documented that at least some of 
these birds have come from beach 
colonies. The productivity of marsh 
colonies is very close to zero, 
while beach colonies usually pro- 
duce one to two young per nest in 
most years. The move to salt 
marshes must be viewed as an 
alarm sounding the poverty of 
more suitable habitat on Long Is- 
land, and the few remaining, pro- 
tected beach colony sites must be 
considered vital to the perpetuation 
of the species , even though the birds 
suffer some harassment by humans 
and risk death by cars. D 



Waving their clothes to send 
nesting terns into flight, a group 
of youngsters typifies the problem 
of harassment at West End Beach. 
Such fun and games can cause the 
birds to abandon their nests.

Swamp Dwellers of Bahia 

by John Cordell 



The introduction of modern 
fishing gear has altered 
the once stable society 
of northeast Brazil 

The susceptibility of northeastern 
Brazil to natural catastrophe weighs 
heavily on its population, mostly 
peasants trapped in a semifeudal 
land-tenure system that is unable 
to absorb continuous generations of 
unskilled sharecroppers. To endure, 
many peasants must become mas- 
ters at the economics of scarcity. 

The government relied for years 
on the supposed richness of Ama- 
zonas&apos; soil to provide a paradise for 
poverty-stricken peasants. Govern- 
ment officials predicted that the 
construction of the Transamazon 
Highway would induce peasants by 
the millions to flock to the rain 
forests, settle a new frontier, and 
begin a new life. But the plan did 
not work. Discouraged by Ama- 
zonas&apos; thick forests and poor soil, 
many of the pioneers returned to 
their traditional homes in the north- 
east. The northeast, however, 
already had a traditional frontier 
of its own, a vast mangrove swamp 
stretching from the semiarid north 
coast of the state of Ceara to the 
southern part of the state of Bahia. 
In this biologically and culturally 
transitional world, modem Brazil 
ends. It is replaced by a backwash 
area, home to an agglomeration of 
swamp dwellers whose lives are 
bound far more to the rhythms of 
the tides than to a booming indus- 
trial economy. 

The swamps, richly stocked with 
aquatic life, are owned by no one: 
historically, they have served as 
an escape hatch for the popula- 



tion of the northeast. Anyone who 
has lost out in the wider economic 
order is free to enter them and en- 
gage in a combination of subsis- 
tence pursuits — fishing, slash-and- 
burn farming on the laurel-forested 
swamp border, or the collecting of 
forest products and the hunting and 
trapping of exotic birds. 

Many swamp fishermen spend a 
part of their early lives as migrant 
wage laborers on nearby sugar plan- 
tations. Near the coast, however, 
much of the agricultural wealth is 
in tree crops, such as rubber, which 
do not require intensive labor. 
Nowadays there is little steady wage 
labor, and every morning the un- 
employed form long lines outside 
the palm oil, textile, and copra fac- 
tories. When all else fails and infla- 
tion cuts deep into their meager 
savings, these people head for the 
swamps. 

Unlike some financially poor but 
culturally independent tribesmen, 
the marginal peasant in Brazil is 
always at the mercy of an encom- 
passing financial system. Even the 
swamp offers no escape from this 
dependency. To exploit the re- 
sources of the swamp, people must 
still have some cash on hand for 
such indispensable purchases as 
matches and kerosene. The latter is 
highly regarded as an insecticide 
and, when mixed with seawater, as 
a purgative for the infestations of 
tropical parasites that abound in 
these latitudes. 

Swamp-dwelling communities are 
characterized by roof-high shell 
middens, which grow up around the 
rudimentary palm-thatched shel- 
ters. As the fishermen shift season- 
ally to new gathering areas, the 
middens are all that remain. The 



rewards of swamp living are the 
accumulation of basic household 
provisions — fruits and berries; man- 
grove roots, which can be woven 
into baskets; palm fronds for sleep- 
ing mats; and mangrove bark from 
which a dye is extracted for fish- 
nets. Tidal creeks provide eels, 
guppies, and crabs for baiting the 
longlines, while mud flats and shal- 
lows produce an assortment of 
mussels, clams, and oysters, which 
usually can be marketed to maintain 
a small cash reserve. The men cut 
tucuma, or palm fiber, for the drag- 
lines of their large nets, and poles 
for fish corrals and mangrove fences 
(traps that catch fish in the ebb 
tide). They also spend long hours 
gathering firewood and preparing 
charcoal for the cold and windy 
nights of the wet season. 

On an unprecedented scale the 
coastal poor penetrated one of 
Brazil&apos;s most inhospitable habitats. 
In the city of Recife alone, more 
than 100,000 people inhabit a 
swamp slum that sprawls over the 
mud flats of the Capiberibe River. 
Long a temporary refuge in times 
of job and food scarcity, swamp 
living has become a permanent way 
of life. At the same time, fishing 
activity has centered increasingly 
on the resources of the swamp it- 
self, rather than on net fishing in 
estuarine waters, until recently a 
profitable occupation that served to 
organize the communities. Many 
fishermen who used to fish the 
estuaries from canoes now work 
exclusively as crab scavengers and 
shellfish collectors, occupations 
that, in the structured Brazilian so- 
ciety, are considered to be among 
the lowliest. 

In towns outside the swamps.

people make no attempt to conceal 
their disdain for swamp dwellers. 
When I was studying livelihood 
patterns in the swamps, 1 was often 
reminded that where the street 
ends, so do the people. Swamp 
settlements, however, are by no 
means homogeneous. They have 
better and worse neighborhoods, a 
class system within a class system.

Stark neighborhoods nicknamed 
Bolivia and Brasilia are made up 
almost entirely of ragged crab 
gatherers and shellfish collectors, 
whose crude lean-tos or incom- 
pletely walled mud shelters are in 
marked contrast to the tile-roofed 
stucco houses of the remaining net- 
fishing neighborhoods. 

During my stay, a residue of the 
most versatile net-hauling special- 
ists continued to fish the estuary, 
although less for the market than 
for home consumption and less with 
their nets than with traps and trot- 
lines that could be operated inde- 
pendently with low upkeep. 

Hunger and disease are rampant 
in the swamp communities. No 
sooner had I moved into a house in 
one of the more populated swamp 



districts than a woman collapsed 
and died at my front door. An au- 
topsy revealed less than a thimbleful 
of water in her stomach. The quest 
for food is an endless and anxious 
daily improvisation; to procure the 
bare necessities people must be 
constantly on the alert. Roving 
bands of children forage for crabs 
in the swamps or beg in the town. 
They sleep in one place, eat in an- 
other, and find some garment of 
clothing in still another. Common 
health problems, which ordinarily 
could be easily taken care of, de- 
velop into long sicknesses. Among 
the most impoverished fishing and 
swamp families, the infant mortality 
rate ranges from 39 to 90 percent. 
Fishermen suflFer widely from ab- 
scessed teeth and gangrenous infec- 



tions that result from untreated fish 
bites and coral cuts. To satisfy their 
need for calories, children and preg- 
nant women develop a craving for 
soap or laundry starch. Because 
illness often leads to abandonment, 
women-centered households are 
becoming the norm in many of the 
swamp communities I visited — a 
departure from the standard of the 
extended family of rural Brazil. A 
number of people, mostly men of 
indeterminate age, simply live alone 
in the swamp, oblivious of their 
past and seemingly indifferent to 
their present pitiful condition. 

The scale of swamp colonization 
is difficult to estimate because cen- 
sus takers ignore these neighbor- 
hoods. Although personal registra- 
tion is required by law in Brazil,

swamp settlers cannot aflFord the 
fees to renew their identity cards, 
and many let them lapse. A birth 
certificate can be obtained for five 
dollars from a doctor. But how 
many of these people know or can 
afford a doctor? Nor can they afford 
weddings or burials. The dead are 
usually dumped unceremoniously 
into the swamp. 

Despite this bleak picture of de- 
culturation, swamp dwelling ap- 
pears to be a fairly recent social 
transition. Although dislocated en- 
vironmentally, fishermen remain 
psychologically oriented toward an 
earlier, more favorable life style, 
which was possible under the tradi- 
tional system of estuarine net fish- 
ing — a system that has changed in 
the past eighteen years owing to the 
economic impact of modernization. 

In 1960, fishing from rafts and 
canoes — the principal inshore pat- 
tern in the northeast — was cata- 
pulted into an era of speculation 
and technical innovation. Entre- 
preneurs, as hungry to open up new 



J 



markets as the land-starved peas- 
antry was to sell its labor, intro- 
duced nylon nets manufactured in 
Japan. According to tests con- 
ducted by the United Nations Food 
and Agriculture Organization, fish 
catches were far larger with nylon 
nets than with more traditional fiber 
nets. Nylon nets were promoted in 
the swamps as part of a moderniza- 
tion scheme to increase the supply 
of fish to urban markets in the 
northeast. Accordingly, a fishery 
improvement agency was estab- 
lished, chiefly to educate peasant 
fishermen in the use of modern gear 
and motorized vessels and to re- 
organize the traditional guilds into 
cooperatives. 

The plan looked good on paper. 
As an incentive to increase produc- 
tivity, large quantities of nylon nets 
were made available to private in- 
vestors who could arrange attrac- 
tive financing through the Banco do 
Brasil. These investors would also 
act as middlemen, selling the nets 
directly to fishermen or farming 



!j«Y.

them out on a profit-sharing basis. 
To insure that the fishermen used 
the new equipment, the middlemen 
introduced nets that most closely 
resembled traditional beach seines 
(gill nets particularly adapted to 
stingray fishing) and mullet nets 
(which either encircle a school or 
drift with the tidal current). 

The decision to promote techno- 
logical innovation proved to be a 
costly mistake. For the fish of the 
local estuary — especially stocks of 
shrimp, flounder, and snook — the 
finely meshed nylon beach seines 
were a deadly adversary. Even in 
clear water, fish cannot see nylon 
and the 2-cm mesh traps fry as well 
as adult fish. When the use of nylon 
nets became widespread throughout 
the swamps, as many fish died and 
rotted in the tidal creeks as were 
caught and sent to market. 

Fishermen, too, had trouble with 
nylon; some went blind mending 
the almost transparent filaments. 
But nylon&apos;s impact was felt most 
in the traditional net-fishing neigh- 



66 




borhoods since it changed the entire 
incentive system and flow of au- 
thority in fishing. 

Swamp fishermen have approxi- 
mately 135 square miles of water- 
way available to them at different 
seasons. This area is divided into 
an inner fishing ground of tidal 
creeks and rivers, and an outer 
ground that includes the main 
estuary, tidal inlets, the surf zone, 
and fringing reefs. Traditionally, 
fishing in the mangrove swamps and 
adjacent waters was limited not by 
the size of the area but by the fisher- 
men&apos;s perceptions of time. As in 
other maritime cultures, time was 



marked by both the recurrence of 
the seasons and the constancy of 
the tides. 

During spring, for example, a 
six-i&lt;not tidal current sweeps up 
and down the estuary, strongly 
aflFecting the efficacy of the diflFer- 
ent types of nets. The same current 
might impede the efficiency of one 
type if used against the tidal flow, 
increase the efficiency of another, 
and preclude the use of a third. 
Fishermen classified the grounds 
according to the varying tides along 
the course of the estuary and chose 
their fishing spots and methods on 
a day-by-day basis, always allowing 
for the mechanical influence of daily 
and fortnightly tidal rhythms. 

An understanding of lunar perio- 
dicity and its effect on the move- 



ments and concentration of marine 
organisms was also crucial to suc- 
cess; through such knowledge, 
fishermen could pinpoint the migra- 
tory patterns of the more highly 
valued species — white and yellow 
catfish, bluerunner, and gray 
mullet. 

Mastery of lunar-tide reckoning 
was thus essential for successful 
fishing in the swamps, and appren- 
ticeships to acquire this knowledge 
were judiciously controlled by cap- 
tains of the fishing canoes, in the 
long run, possession of this knowl- 
edge was a prime factor in control- 
ling fishing pressure. Following the 
lunar-tide calendar not only helped 
the fishermen synchronize boat 
movements and the choice of fish- 
ing methods according to biweekly 



and daily tide fluctuations, it was 
also an important element in conser- 
vation. The precise work routines 
established by fishing captains — 
and dictated by lunar periodicity — 
assured the continuing availability 
of estuarine stocks. To a swamp 
fisherman, a fishing spot is not 
purely geographical, but rather a 
temporary locale whose productiv- 
ity is determined by the lunar phase. 
Since the tide goes through two 
complete cycles (spring to neap and 
back to spring) every twenty-eight 
days, each day in the cycle opens 
up a different set of fishing spots in 
the estuary. The lunar-tide calendar 
is a precise index of changes in 
fish behavior. 

Given these natural limits to the 
expansion of estuary fishing, it was 




I&quot;&quot; 1*^&quot;

&apos;&quot;&apos;**&apos;:— _, 



not surprising to find that fishermen 
established definite property claims 
over lunar-tide fishing space, claims 
that firstborn sons and apprentices 
inherited. Because these territories 
always changed according to the 
lunar phase, charges of overex- 
ploitation by certain individuals or 
villages did not conform to the 
common-property theories ordinar-

ily used by anthropologists to ex- 
plain overexploitation in both open 
ocean and inshore fisheries. In the 
absence of a formal legal system to 
prevent encroachment, fishermen 
relied on a cooperative ethic and an 




informal procedure for airing dis- 
putes called olho do povo, literally, 
&quot;the community eye.&quot; 

Liquid capital is almost nonexist- 
ent in swamp towns, so to make 
ends meet, fishermen fell back on 
elaborate borrowing/lending net- 
works. Fishing etiquette involved a 
constant flow of small favors and 
gifts — towing in from the fishing 
grounds, lending bait, transporting 
the sacred wood of the white man- 
grove for use as a house beam, sell- 
ing to a fish hawker on credit, or 
sharing premium water spaces dur- 
ing spawning runs. 

Kinship and godparenthood rela- 
tions further tied fishing captains to- 
gether in friendship circles, which 



minimized disputes and legitimized 
territorial claims. Thus, by integrat- 
ing daily observations of lunar-tide 
influence with elements of Portu- 
guese, African, and Indian maritime 
lore, the isolated swamp communi- 
ties built up an adaptive, stable sys- 
tem for fishing a tropical estuary. 
The system not only provided fresh 
fish for a limited market of sea and 
river ports but also assimilated and 
socialized new generations of fish- 
ermen in a reciprocal economy sup- 
ported by cooperative fishing 
etiquette. 

Introduction of the nylon nets 
changed all this. In less than a dec- 
ade, this four-century-old tradition 
disintegrated. Although the nylon 



nets were originally intended for 
purchase by traditional captains, 
they eventually rejected the innova- 
tion, not out of inherent conserva- 
tism, but because they could not 
meet the loan-repayment schedules. 
Consequently, the nets fell into the 
hands of wealthy middlemen — 
factory bosses, plantation owners, 
and textile merchants — who could 
afford to speculate in fishing. Many 
fishermen, already indebted to 
these entrepreneurs, were drawn 
into an easily exploitable pool of 
cheap labor. 

Over the next few years, a highly 
competitive nylon-net-fishing en- 
clave grew up across the river from 
the traditional community where I 




lived. Fishermen who had never 
been apprentices were put in charge 
of 30-foot dugouts. Discontinuing 
the customary system of dividing 
catches among crew members, 
nylon net bosses paid crews fixed 
wages, which although minimal by 
most standards, nonetheless ap- 
pealed considerably to the security- 
minded peasant fisherman. Rent- 
free quarters were provided in a 
local factory compound. Between 
1960 and 1965, 70 to 110 nylon net 
crews, using more than 600 new 
nets, were added to the traditional 
fishing system. But in the long run 
the aiiticipated replacement of fiber 
nets by nylon ones did not occur. 
Rather, too many nylon nets were 
added for the few water spaces 
available to accommodate them. 

Fishery biologists generally agree 
that because of wide species distri- 
bution and the existence of plank- 
tonic larvae, overexploitation of 
stocks by traditional gear is un- 
likely. Under conditions of low 
population density, swamp commu- 
nities had fished the same grounds 
since colonial times without having 
to shift their settlements because of 
resource depletion. Local waters 
are cyclically replenished by pelagic 
schools that seek out the sheltered 
reaches of the mangrove to feed and 
spawn. 

In the ensuing struggle for control 
of the fishing grounds, the tradi- 
tional ratio of fishermen to water 
spaces was shattered and the sys- 
tem of territorial claims disinte- 
grated. The fishery reverted to the 
status of common property with all 
the attendant drawbacks of over- 
capitalization and overfishing. Cut- 
throat competition followed, with 
boats cast adrift on the tide and nets 
dynamited or slashed with ma- 
chetes. The nylon drift nets set at 
night and allowed to float in the 
main channel were particularly 
hazardous to other set gear, easily 
snagging in the traditional trotlines 
and stingray nets. 

Since they did not own their own 
equipment and were employed by a 
nonfishing power base, nylon net 
fishermen were willing to take 
greater risks and felt little respon- 
sibility for their actions on the fish- 
ing grounds. Economic warfare 
eventually took its toll. Traditional 



net fishermen were increasingly 
lured into high-risk stratagems they 
could not afford. Some decided to 
set aside their remaining equipment 
and wait out the strife. 

With the advent of nylon nets, 
overall production briefly increased 
but in time catches began to decline. 
Nylon net crews were laid off. Tra- 
ditional captains, too, were forced 
to let their crews go and shift their 
operations to the recesses of the 
swamp itself: working small fish 
corrals with their wives, moon- 
lighting as fish hawkers, combing 
the tidal flats alone with hand-cast 
nets, or scavenging for crabs, which 
to a net-fishing captain are animals 
hardly worth eating. 

Lunar-tide fishing will soon be a 
lost art in Bahia as more and more 
energy is directed to individual, 
rather than community, survival. 
Whether the extreme phase of de- 
culturation found in this segment of 
the Brazilian peasantry will be off- 
set by a corresponding assimilation 
of new values, skills, and opportu- 
nities is still an open question. 
Highly specialized fishing knowl- 
edge, however, need not always be 
lost through speculative moderniza- 
tion. There is an alternative^pre- 
serving the traditional system and 
then building on that established 
base. Prior to the introduction of 
nylon nets, fishing captains in the 
swamps had partially solved the 
perennial problem of controlling 
access to the fishery by using a rigid 
fishing space tenure system that 
challenges usual common property 
theories. A strict cooperative ethic 
and long-term apprenticeship ar- j, 
rangements further reinforced their 
territorial claims. Today most 
swamp fishermen live lives of de- 
spair, while entrepreneurs, who 
have no long-term stake in the wel- 
fare of the fishery, have captured 
the swamp&apos;s most marginal sub- 
sistence resources, traditionally the 
reserve of the poor. D

Plants in the 

Hostile 

Atmosphere

The cells of land-dwelling 
plants must avoid 
death by desiccation 

The basic life processes of trees 
and herbs are essentially the same 
as those of the smallest, most primi- 
tive plants, the single-celled algae. 
Although they differ vastly in size 
and are separated by hundreds of 
millions of years of evolution, both 
the tree and the algal cell manufac- 
ture their own food through photo- 
synthesis, obtain their chemical 
energy through respiration, and 
synthesize living protoplasm by vir- 
tually identical enzymes and mecha- 
nisms. So similar are these organ- 
isms that even in its internal struc- 
ture a single green cell from the leaf 
of a tree is nearly identical to a sin- 
gle algal cell. Both contain a char- 
acteristic nucleus, chloroplasts (the 
organelles that function in photo- 
synthesis), mitochondria (the cellu- 
lar sites of respiration), and as- 
sorted other, smaller organelles. 
Furthermore, each green cell from a 
leaf can perform its life functions in- 
dependently, just as do the solitary 
algal cells. But if all basic life proc- 
esses in plants take place in algal- 
like cells, how is it that trees diflFer 
so obviously from microscopic 
algae?

The answer is related not to how 
the cells function but to where they 
live on our planet. Algal cells live in 
aquatic environments, which pro- 
tect against instant desiccation, 
while the cells of land plants must 
cope with the ever present danger 
of death by desiccation. Any unpro- 
tected living cell, plant or animal, 
placed in air will completely dry up 
and die within about thirty seconds. 
This means that all cells, of all living 
organisms, are strictly aquatic crea- 
tures. A terrestrial organism is 
merely a protective shell filled with 
up to millions of normally aquatic 
cells. Viewed in this light, a tree is a 
&quot;vegetable skyscraper&quot; that pro- 
tects, and suspends, within its epi- 
dermal layers (the shell) millions of 
algallike green cells in an environ- 
ment nearly as aquatic as that of the 
algal cell even though the hostile 
atmosphere may be but fractions of 
an inch away. 

Other than the basic chloro- 
phyll-containing photosynthetic 
cells (chlorenchyma) and a rela- 
tively few cells specialized for re- 
production, all the myriad dififerent 
cells and tissues in a plant function 




Transverse section of a growth ring in Pinus lawsonii (Lawson pine) 



to create the required aquatic 
microenvironment, that is, they 
allow the plant to overcome the 
adversities imposed by the dry at- 
mosphere or by competing or- 
ganisms. Natural selection has re- 
sulted in a wide variety of trees, 
shrubs, and herbs — each a remark- 



able feat of engineering, each a 
self-contained &quot;vegetable high-rise 
apartment building&quot; that houses the 
chlorenchyma cells. And like self- 
contained apartment communities 
that house people, the vegetable 
high-rise must be equipped with 
life-support systems to provide for 



7ft 



its occupants. To better appreciate 
these systems, let us first examine 
the basic requirements for sustain- 
ing plant life and the difficulties 
encountered in the land environ- 
ment. 

What type of aquatic microenvi- 
ronment is needed for the basic 



chlorenchyma cell to function prop- 
erly? Only a very delicate balance 
of sunlight, temperature, mineral 
nutrients, and the atmospheric 
gases carbon dioxide and oxygen 
will suffice. Too little sunlight will 
not allow sufficient photosynthesis, 
while too much will cause heat or 




Transverse section of a vascular bundle in the leaf of 
Ammophila breviligulata (beach grass) 



radiation damage. In the same man- 
ner, too few mineral nutrients se- 
verely limit growth, while excessive 
amounts of certain minerals are tox- 
ic. At certain times carbon dioxide 
must be absorbed and oxygen elim- 
inated, while at other times the 
reverse must take place. Freezing 
temperatures will cause damaging 
ice crystal formation, while exces- 
sively high temperatures will de- 
stroy sensitive cellular compo- 
nents. 

Few such balanced environments 
occur naturally, and it is to these 
locations — predominantly the sur- 
face waters of our planet or con- 
stantly moist soil surfaces — that the 
algae are restricted. Only near the 
interface of the water and the at- 
mosphere can sunlight reach the 
cells and sufficient gas exchange 
occur. Because gases diffuse very 
slowly through liquids, plant life in 
stagnant water may be restricted to 
within a few feet or less of the 
surface. By contrast, in actively 
aerated water, plant life can extend 
to the submerged edge of dark- 
ness — more than 200 feet deep in 
the clearest waters. Nevertheless,

when one considers the immense 
thickness of the planet and its at- 
mosphere, these surface waters are 
but a minute film. 

The aquatic microenvironments 
created internally by the plants ex- 
tend the plant cells&apos; life zone verti- 
cally many feet from the surface of 
the planet — more than 300 feet in 
the case of the tallest trees. Since 
the natural life zone for plant cells 
consists only of the top quarter-inch 
or so of constantly moist soil (a rare 
soil condition at best), land plant 
architecture dramatically increases 
the habitable space by many, many 
times. Each plant is literally an 
aquatic oasis within the desert of the 
atmosphere, an oasis inhabited by 
the algallike cells. And since ter- 
restrial animals are dependent on 
the food and oxygen produced by 
the algallike cells through photosyn- 
thesis, each plant is an oasis that 
supports animal life as well — 
ourselves included. 

Maintaining an aquatic micro- 
climate within a structure as 
highly branched as a tree is a prob- 
lem to challenge the best of en- 
gineers. Not only must every leaf 
cell receive a continuous water sup- 
ply from the root system, but every 
root cell must concurrently obtain 
photosynthetic products from the 
leaves. Since the aerial portion of 
some trees is more than 300 feet 
long and the roots an additional 200 
feet, the transport pathway may 
stretch in excess of 500 feet. If the 
lengths of all stem and root 
branches, plus the veins of the 
leaves, are added, the intercellular 
highway system in a single tree is 
thousands of miles long. Fur- 
thermore, imagine the mechanical 
difficulties associated with support- 
ing a skyscraper the shape of a tree. 
What unique architectural spe- 
cializations does the vegetable 
high-rise possess, and how do they 
compare with the designs of our 
mechanical engineers? 

Structural support is a major re- 
quirement for any dwelling. With- 
out support the smallest vegetable 
enterprise protruding vertically an 
inch or more into the atmosphere 
would be toppled by the strong 
force of gravity and the shearing 
force of winds. In the absence of 
foraging animals or of competition 



for space and light with other 
plants, a prostrate herb might (and 
some do) survive admirably; how- 
ever, the 300 to 400 million years of 
land plant evolution have resulted in 
a tremendous species diversity that 
makes survival difficult for all 
plants because of intense competi- 
tion for raw materials and real es- 
tate. Although diminutive plants 
still have a place in nature, the 
space race for plants, like that for 
humans, clearly resulted in con- 
struction of the vegetable sky- 
scraper. Such high-rise architecture 
contains increased office space 
(leaves) and also towers above the 
herbaceous congestion that com- 
petes for the available sunlight. 

The supportive tissues, or gird- 
ers, that make such architecture 
possible consist of specialized elon- 
gate cells with greatly reinforced 
cell walls. Unlike an animal cell, 
each plant cell is surrounded by a 
supportive shell, or cell wall, made 
of cellulose and a mixture of other 
carbohydrates, protein, and in some 
cases, lignin. This enclosing shell 
acts as an exoskeleton for each cell 
and constitutes the skeletal system 
of all plants. By contrast, the higher 
animals have an endoskeleton of 
bone and cartilage that acts as a 
framework on which to hang the 
many individually nonsupported 
animal cells. 

The specialized supportive cells 
in plants have cell walls constructed 
much like reinforced concrete. Both 
contain long solid rods that are 
carefully oriented within a sur- 
rounding matrix of congealed mate- 
rial. In a plant cell wall the solid rods 
are long thin needles of cellulose 
called microfibrils; in concrete the 
rods are steel. For added strength in 
a given direction, the cellulose 
microfibrils are aligned in parallel 
array within a single layer of the 
wall. Most thick walls have several 
layers, and the different layers often 
have the cellulose microfibrils 
oriented at diflferent angles for mul- 
tidirectional strength. (The same 
engineering principle is often used 
when pouring concrete.) The cel- 
lulose rods are embedded within a 
gluelike matrix consisting of 
amorphous carbohydrate (hemicel- 
luloses and pectins), protein, and 
often lignin (a complex polymer 



especially characteristic of wood). 
But whereas concrete is a congealed 
solid (of cement and sand or gravel), 
the matrix of the cell wall is a colloid 
with a thick gellike consistency, 
held together as a mesh by chemical 
bonds between the various con- 
stituents. The wall&apos;s fluid nature 
imparts a desirable resiliency to the 
structure — thus wood is less brittle 
than most concrete. The quality of 
the final product is attested to by the 
thousands of uses to which we put 
lumber and wood products. 

Several types of cells within the 
plant possess supportive walls like 
those above, the most common 
being sclerenchyma fiber cells and 
xylary (water-conducting) cells. 
The long and needlelike fiber cells 
occur in bundles; when exploited by 
man, they are called commercial 
fibers. Economically important ex- 
amples of such fibers include flax 
for making linen; hemp for cordage; 
jute for cordage or textiles; and 
ramie for textiles. Fiber cells are 
also a major component of many 
hardwoods, such as oak and walnut, 
and contribute much to their struc- 
tural properties. 

While only a few fiber bundles 
may suffice to support a small her- 
baceous plant, the wood of shrubs 
and trees contains enormous quan- 
tities of supportive tissue. How- 
ever, wood, or secondary xylem, 
serves another major function in 
maintaining the land-based plant, 
that of establishing aquatic continu- 
ity with the soil. Thus wood is a 
mixture of supportive tissue, such 
as fibers, and water-transporting 
tubes, or xylary cells. 

Xylary cells vary greatly in size 
and shape: one extreme resembles 
the elongate fiber cell, while the 
other is shaped like a wooden barrel 
open at both ends. Some barrel- 
shaped xylary elements can be quite 
large; in oak lumber they are macro- 
scopically visible as the familiar 
&quot;pores.&quot; But regardless of size, all 
functional xylary cells are dead, 
hollow, and arranged in continuous 
files to form the complex water-pipe 
system of the skyscraper, which 
extends throughout every leaf, 
branch, and root and is continually 
being added to in every growing 
region of the plant — all this without 
interrupting consumer service. 



Just as buildings have a second 
plumbing system, the sewer system, 
to transport products away from 
active sites of synthesis, so plants 
have a second system, the phloem, 
for transporting (in this case desir- 
able) metabolic products such as 
sugars and amino acids from sites of 
manufacture to sites of cellular con- 
struction or storage. Unlike xylary 
cells, phloem cells are living and 
contribute little to the structural 
support of the entire community. 
Nevertheless, they are the major 
conduit for food transport through- 
out the plant body. Together, the 
xylem and phloem constitute the 
circulatory, or vascular, system of 
the plant, and each reaches to 
within several cells of every cell in 
every leaf or branch of the plant. 
Upon reaching these terminal fau- 
cets, the vein endings, the trans- 
ported materials must be either 
handed from cell to cell or must dif- 
fuse through the cell walls in order 
to reach the individual cells. This is 
not unlike the terminal circulatory 
system in animals where minute 
capillaries release the transported 
materials, which must then pass by 
diflFusion to the individual surround-

ing cells, while at the same time 
cellular products must diffuse back 
into the capillary system. 

But while the higher animal vas- 
cular system continuously recircu- 
lates the same fluids — the arteries 
carrying blood from the heart and 
the veins carrying blood back to the 
heart — the sap of a plant is not con- 
tinuously recirculated. The plumb- 
ing systems of the plant, the xylem 
and the phloem, operate largely in- 
dependently of each other, are not 
interconnected, and carry diflFerent 
substances. The xylem sap and 
phloem sap can move in the same 
direction or in opposite directions in 
a given tissue depending on the par- 
ticular nutritional requirements of 
the tissue. Furthermore, the direc- 
tion of flow can change with the 
time of day or the season of the 
year. The supply and demand of the 
tissues involved, not a central heart, 
regulates the direction of flow. 

Plants also differ markedly from 
animals in other ways. Plant circu- 
latory systems do not transport 
oxygen (O-J and carbon dioxide 
(CO.&gt;) to or from the tissues and 
plants do not have lungs to perform 
atmospheric gas exchange. Never- 
theless, exchange of both oxygen 
and carbon dioxide with the at- 
mosphere is as important to plants 
as to animals. 

During the day, carbon dioxide 
must be absorbed by the green cells 
for conversion into sugars and, ul- 
timately, all the other organic 
molecules that make up the plant 
body. Concurrently, the oxygen, a 
byproduct of photosynthesis, must 
be released from the tissues because 
high concentrations of oxygen in- 
hibit photosynthesis. During the 
night, gas exchange in plants is 
similar to that in animals because 
the process of cellular respiration is 
the same for both groups. Oxygen is 
taken into the cells and used in the 
oxidation of organic molecules such 
as sugars in order to release the 
chemical energy that operates all 



life processes. Carbon dioxide, a 
product of respiration, is thus re- 
leased from the tissues. 

Like animals, plants perform res- 
piration at all times of the day or 
night since chemical energy is con- 
tinuously required. However, while 
the green plant is photosynthesizing 
during the day. the net gas exchange 
is in favor of the photosynthetic 
process (uptake of COj with release 
of Oj). Only at night when photo- 
synthesis is not occurring does net 
gas exchange reflect the respiratory 
process (uptake of O2 with release 
of CO..). Thus, energetically, pho- 
tosynthesis and respiration are 
roughly the reverse of each other. 
During photosynthesis the energy in 
sunlight is captured to manufacture 
sugars and oxygen, and during res- 
piration, oxygen is utilized to com- 
bust the sugars and release chemical 
energy. Since animals cannot per- 
form photosynthesis, all animal life 
is totally dependent on green plants 
for continual replenishment of the 
oxygen supply and for all primary 
food production. 

Providing a means for this neces- 
sary gas exchange is perhaps the 
most serious problem faced by the 
land plant because our vegetable 
skyscrapers must not only provide 
for exchange of gases with the at- 
mosphere but also protect the 
aquatic microenvironment from the 
severe drying effects of this same 
atmosphere. Because these two 
considerations are directly at odds, 
no perfect solution is possible — 
there must be a compromise be- 
tween unavoidable transpiration 
(water loss) and adequate levels of 
gas exchange. The actual degree of 
compromise varies from species to 
species, depending on such factors 
as the amount of available water, 
the temperature and drying eflFects 
of the outside atmosphere, and the 
growth rate necessary for survival 
(growth being limited by reduced 
gas exchange). Furthermore, these 
factors may change daily, often 
hourly, making the land environ- 
ment even more challenging for our 
aquatic invader. 

The plant&apos;s adaptation to these 
formidable difficulties is the 
epidermis, a remarkable, normally 
single layer of cells that carefully 
controls the degree of compromise 
through the use of millions of 
microscopic, adjustable ventilation 
pores, or stomates. The stomates of 
most plants consist of a slitlike pore 



80 



I 



formed between two kidney-shaped 
guard cells. It is the unique property 
of guard cells that they can expand 
or contract, thus opening or closing 
the ventilation pore in a valvelike 
manner. Equally amazing is that 
these minute guard-cell pairs func- 
tion like minicomputers, detecting 
and balancing the effects of all in- 
teracting factors, such as the sever- 
ity of water loss, availability of 
internal water, concentration of 
carbon dioxide in the tissues, and 
whether the plant is in light or 
darkness. 

All of this information is inte- 
grated simultaneously (not electron- 
ically, but chemically) so the green, 
algallike cells that inhabit our high- 
rise community are always pro- 
vided with the best compromise 
between water loss and gas ex- 
change. Furthermore, all the sto- 
mates of a leaf act in unison even 
though there are from several 
thousand (in grass plants) to more 
than one hundred thousand sto- 
mates (in certain oak trees) on each 
square centimeter of leaf surface 
(usually the lower surface). The 
efficiency of this complex water/gas 
exchange control system is appar- 



ent from the abundance and univer- 
sal location of vegetation on our 
planet. 

Below the stomatal ventilation 
pores is a ramifying system of ven- 
tilation ducts, called intercellular 
spaces. With rare exceptions, all 
cells in the entire plant body, from 
the leaves to the roots, border on 
the interconnected ventilation duct 
system, just as do all rooms of a 
building. This is necessary to 
achieve adequate gas exchange; 
otherwise the cells would suffocate 
and die. Hydrophytes have espe- 
cially acute gas exchange problems. 
Because gases diffuse very slowly 
through water, the ventilation sys- 
tem in many hydrophytes is greatly 
expanded by aerenchyma tissue, in 
which the air-filled ventilation ducts 
often occupy more volume of the 
plant body than do the cells. Archi- 
tecturally, aerenchyma is a beauti- 
ful blend of complexity and geo- 
metric regularity that rivals any- 
thing man-made. 

Thus the interior of the land plant 
is a very unusual aquatic micro- 
environment. The surface of every 
cell is covered by a saturating film 
of water; yet every cell is adjacent 



to the air-filled ventilation spaces 
that facilitate rapid exchange of car- 
bon dioxide and oxygen. The dry- 
ing effects of the air in the ventila- 
tion spaces are minimized, how- 
ever, because the air&quot;s relative 
humidity is maintained at nearly 100 
percent. Should excessive water 
loss cause the relative humidity to 
drop, even slightly, the stomatal 
valves will close, partially or com- 
pletely, until the water balance is 
reestablished within the leaf. 

The stomatal regulators in the 
epidermis, together with the sup- 
portive and vascular tissues, make 
up the major life-support systems 
for plants that have invaded the at- 
mosphere. This invasion of the land 
is exactly the reverse of man&apos;s con- 
struction of underwater cities 
within domes or tubes in order to 
extend an atmospheric environment 
into the normally aquatic environ- 
ment. Many of the same engineer- 
ing principles apply to both. 

The similarities between natural 
systems and man&apos;s solutions to en- 
gineering problems should demon- 
strate to all of us that humanity can 
benefit greatly by studying the laws 
of nature. D

Now You See It; Now You Don&apos;t 



The first-known long-period 
variable star, discovered 
more than 300 years ago, 
continues to baffle 
astronomers 

Almost four centuries of study 
have determined many properties 
of Mira and other long-period vari- 
able stars, but the process that 
causes cyclic changes in their bright- 
ness is still uncertain. Recent work 
indicates that shock waves, travel- 
ing outward through these huge 
stars from pulsating regions deep 
inside, may trigger transparency 
changes that make the stars seem 
to alter in size. 

Mira, the first-known long-period 
variable star, was discovered by a 
German astronomer-clergyman, 
David Fabricius, in August 1596; 
at least, that&apos;s when the star be- 
came known to Western science. 
But according to one interpretation 
of an old cuneiform text, Mira&apos;s 
curious habit of alternately fading 
from view and reappearing may 
have been recognized by the ancient 
Babylonians. Fabricius knew only 
that he had found a fairly bright — 
and yet apparently uncataloged — 
star in the constellation Cetus the 
Whale, and that it faded from view 
over the next two months. Since he 
had trained under the great Danish 
astronomer Tycho Brahe, famous 
for his study of a &quot;new star&quot; that 
appeared in 1572 and then vanished 
forever, Fabricius probably thought 
that Mira was a similar object. In 
February 1609, however, he must 
have changed his mind when he 
glimpsed Mira again. 

Other persons must also have 
seen the star in the interim because 
we now know that it varies period- 
ically in brightness, reaching a 
&quot;maximum light,&quot; which is readily 
visible to the unaided eye, once 
every eleven months. Further, the 
noted Vranometria, an accurate 
and beautiful sky atlas printed in 
1603, shows Mira as a dim star in 



the neck of Cetus, labeled only by 
the Greek letter omicron and with- 
out any notation that the compiler 
of the atlas knew the star was 
unusual. 

As its remarkable properties were 
established, omicron Ceti was often 
called Mira (abbreviated from stella 
mira, Latin for &quot;wonderful star&quot;). 
Sometimes, however, it was de- 
scribed as &quot;The Periodical Star in 
Collo Ceti [the whale&apos;s neck].&quot; 
That&apos;s how the noted astronomer 
Sir William Herschel referred to the 
star in a series of late eighteenth- 
century reports to the Philosophical 
Society of Bath in England. I am not 
sure that whales have necks in the 
usual sense, but, then as now, as- 
tronomers were not required to 
include zoology among their quali- 
fications. 

Herschel found that Mira&apos;s in- 
tensity at its periodic maximum 
brightness was itself variable; in 
some years the star became much 
brighter than in others. On one rare 
occasion, it actually rivaled the 
first-magnitude Aldebaran, the 
bright red star in the head of Taurus 
the Bull. Herschel tried to study 
Mira telescopically at those times 
when it faded from naked-eye view. 
In 1780, at two o&apos;clock on an Au- 
gust morning, he &quot;looked with a 
compound eye piece that takes in a 
very large field of view, and exam- 
ined every very small star near the 
place of the periodical star but 
could not find it.&quot; One month later 
to the day, he was able to discern 
the star by unaided vision and easily 
trained his telescope on it. He wrote 
of this observation that Mira had a 
deeper red color &quot;than any I re- 
member to have seen before among 
the fixt Stars.&quot; 

The red color was an important 
clue to Mira&apos;s physical properties, 
for red stars are cool ones. Today 
more than three thousand similar 
stars have been found, with periods 
of cyclic brightness-change ranging 
from fewer than 150 to more than 



1,000 days (thus, the term &quot;long 
period,&quot; which distinguishes these 
from other kinds of variable stars 
that undergo more rapid fluctua- 
tions). They are identified as a vari- 
ety of red giant stars, with diameters 
far larger than that of the sun, but 
with roughly equal mass. The mass 
of a red giant star such as Mira is 
concentrated in a small, dense core, 
but the thin outer layers extend so 
far outward that, were the star 
placed at the center of our solar 
system, it would engulf the planet 
Mars, well beyond the orbit of the 
earth. Much effort has been ex- 
pended in attempting to explain the 
brightness variations in long-period 
variable stars, although such inves- 
tigations often ignored Herschel&apos;s 
important finding that the maxima 
were unequal. 

These investigations required 
evermore sophisticated techniques, 
including spectroscopy, the analy- 
sis of starlight to determine the 
temperature and chemical compo- 
sition of a star and to estimate 
motions in its atmosphere by means 
of the Doppler eflFect; interferom- 
etry, a method for measuring the 
apparent diameter of a bright star; 
and infrared photometry, the meas- 
urement of a star&apos;s infrared radia- 
tion. The first spectrogram of a 
long-period variable star (Mira, in 
fact) was obtained at Harvard in 
1885, and Mira&apos;s diameter was 
measured at Mount Wilson Obser- 
vatory in 1919. Infrared measure- 
ments were also carried out at 
Mount Wilson, beginning in 1921. 

From the many spectrograms 
made since 1885, we have learned 
that gases in the atmosphere of 
Mira move up and down over the 
eleven-month cycle of brightness 
changes. This finding gave no sup- 
port to an early theory that ascribed 
the brightness variations to the 
growth and dissipation of starspots 
on Mira, an idea patterned after the 
observed sunspot cycle of our sun. 
Nor was there any hard evidence

for a proposal that the brightness 
changes were due to rotation of the 
star. For the purposes of this theory, 
Mira was imagined to have a dis- 
torted and changing shape and to be 
on the brink of splitting in two, to 
form a binary star. Instead, the ob- 
servation of rhythmic motions sug- 
gested that Mira was pulsating, like 
the better-studied variable stars of 
shorter period, called cepheids. 

A pulsating star bulges in and 
out; in the absence of complicating 
effects, it is coolest (and therefore 
faintest) when it is largest since 
expansion cools the gas. A possible 
drawback in applying this explana- 
tion to Mira was the knowledge 
from Herschel&apos;s studies that Mira&apos;s 
visible light changes by a factor of 
250 or more from maximum to 
minimum in a typical eleven-month 
cycle. By contrast, the pulsation 
theory predicts a change of only a 
factor of 40. This objection, how- 
ever, appeared to be satisfied by the 
discovery of strong and variable 
absorptions of light due to the tita- 
nium oxide molecule, which is abun- 
dant in the atmospheres of Mira and 
other long-period variable stars. 

When a gas is heated above a 
certain temperature, its molecules 
break up into their component 
atoms, which rejoin each other to 
form molecules again when the gas 
cools below that temperature. The 
spectra of Mira taken at different 
times in its cycle showed that the 
titanium oxide absorptions were 
stronger (indicating that more mole- 
cules were present) when the star 
was in its cool, dim phase. The ab- 
sorptions were much weaker (im- 
plying the presence of far fewer 
molecules) when the star was hot 
and bright. 

In addition, when the star is 
cooler, solid particles of &quot;stellar 
dust&quot; may form from the gas at high 
altitudes in Mira&apos;s atmosphere, 
much as water vapor condenses to 
form cirrus clouds of tiny ice crys- 
tals at the colder levels of the earth&apos;s

atmosphere. The stellar dust tends 
to evaporate when the star gets 
hotter. Thus, the dust, too, cuts oflF 
more of the star&apos;s outward stream- 
ing light when the star is cool and 
absorbs less when the star is hot. 

The molecules and the dust, to- 
gether with the basic warming and 
cooling of the pulsating star, were 
thought to explain Mira&apos;s full factor 
of 250 light variations. While not 
accorded the status of a proven 
theory, this pulsation hypothesis 
became the leading explanation for 
the brightness changes of long- 
period variable stars. 

Interferometry measurements 
showed that, when bright, Mira has 
a diameter about 460 times that of 
the sun. Since the technique was 
not applicable when Mira became 
faint, diameters were inferred from 
infrared photometry done at differ- 
ent times during the eleven-month 
cycle. These observations were 
readily performed even when Mira 
was faintest, for the Mount Wilson 
astronomers discovered that the 
infrared light of the star changes 
by a factor of only 2&apos;/i during a cycle, 
fully 100 times less than the visible 
light. 

Unfortunately for the survival of 
the pulsation theory, these measure- 
ments showed that instead of being 
largest approximately when cool- 
est, Mira was largest relatively soon 
after reaching its maximum bright- 
ness and hottest temperature. An- 
other objection to the pulsation the- 
ory is the variability in Mira&apos;s in- 
tensity at maximum light, as noted 
by Herschel. Stars definitely knowji 
to be pulsating, such as the ceph- 
eids, have changes that generally 
repeat with high precision, like the 
swings of a pendulum, and we 
should expect no less from Mira if 
it is pulsating. 

The final blow to the pulsation 
theory was a detailed analysis, pub- 
lished last year, of the motions of 
the gas in three long-period variable 
stars. This study by George Waller- 
stein, a leading expert on stellar 
atmospheres at the University of 
Washington, examined the follow- 
ing point: If a star is pulsating, the 
observed motions (found by spec- 
troscopy) must correspond to the 
changes in the diameter of the star, 
as implied by infrared photometry. 
Further, the motions must proceed 
at such speeds that what goes up 
will come down before it goes up 
again in the next cycle. Wallerstein 



found that none of the three stars he 
studied satisfied both of these con- 
ditions. This raised the specter that 
the apparent size changes of long- 
period variable stars do not corre- 
spond to actual changes in the diam- 
eters of the stars but are an illusion 
caused by the manner in which we 
perceive the diameters. (The man- 
ner of perception is as follows: We 
measure the temperature and infra- 
red brightness of a star, then calcu- 
late how large a surface at the given 
temperature is required to produce 
the observed brightness.) 

Wallerstein&apos;s findings are in 
agreement with what is known as 
the shock wave theory. According 
to this theory, the observed changes 
in size are due to shock waves that 
travel outward from the deep inte- 
rior of a long-period variable star, 
rather than to pulsations of the ob- 
served outer layers. A shock wave 
is a disturbance that travels through 
a medium (in this case, the hot gases 
of the star) at a speed that exceeds 
the speed of sound in that medium. 
Like the consequences of sonic 
booms from fast-moving jet planes, 
the effects of shock waves are not 
the same on every occasion. This 
agrees with the observation that the 
brightness of Mira has different 
peak values in different cycles. 

It has been suggested that the 
shocks are produced by periodic 
nuclear explosions in the core, but 
this idea is not confirmed by de- 
tailed computations. A more likely 
possibility is that the core and a 
surrounding zone, deep inside the 
star, are pulsating in the manner of 
a cepheid variable star, but these 
pulsations are screened from view 
by the overlying layers of gas. As 
the pulsations travel outward they 
move through regions of decreasing 
density and become more powerful 
disturbances, just as a small deflec- 
tion near the handle of a bullwhip 
becomes a violent snap when it 
reaches the whip&apos;s tip. 

The outward-moving and intensi- 
fying disturbance becomes a shock 
wave when it reaches a certain up- 
per level of the star. It heats the gas 
far above that level, thus contribut- 
ing to the brightness changes that 
we observe. The upper layers of the 
star, however, are not pulsating, 
since the pulsations have given way 
to shock waves. Instead, they are 
reacting to the increased heating oc- 
casioned by the periodic arrivals of 
the shocks. According to the shock 



wave theory, the dominant reaction 
is a decrease in the number of mole- 
cules and dust grains caused by the 
heating. Immediately after maxi- 
mum temperature occurs, the at- 
mosphere begins cooling, dust and 
molecules form in abundance again, 
and the atmosphere becomes more 
opaque. With increased opacity we 
are unable to see to as great a depth 
as previously; as a result, the star 
seems to be bigger. Actually, it is 
the star&apos;s visible extent that has 
varied because the upper layers 
have changed from transparent to 
opaque. 

The shock wave theory appears 
to be an adequate explanation for 
the properties of a long-period vari- 
able star, as established by exten- 
sive past observations, although it 
may not be the last word on the 
subject. However, recent studies 
with infrared and radio telescopes 
have revealed a whole new set of 
unexpected phenomena. For ex- 
ample, despite its enormous size, 
Mira is found to be dwarfed by its 
own giant circumstellar shell of gas 
and dust, like a small light bulb at 
the center of a large globular lamp- 
shade. This shell may be produced 
by the pressure of Mira&apos;s light, 
which conceivably drives stellar 
dust outward from the star just as 
the pressure of sunlight pushes the 
dust tail of a comet in the direction 
opposite the sun. Or the material 
may be driven outward by the shock 
waves. 

Water vapor, hydroxyl (OH), and 
silicon monoxide molecules in the 
shell appear to beam intense radio 
waves via naturally induced maser 
processes, which remain undupli- 
cated in earthly laboratories. Also 
present in the shell are carbon 
monoxide molecules aglow with 
radio waves, stimulated by the in- 
fluence of infrared light from the 
star, just as certain minerals glow in 
the dark when illuminated by ultra- 
violet light. Studying these marvel- 
ous phenomena will keep us busy 
for years to come and explanations 
may still be incomplete in 1996, 
when astronomers celebrate the 
four hundredth anniversary of 
Fabricius&apos;s discovery of the won- 
derful star in the neck of the Whale.

Celestial Events 

by Thomas D. Nicholson 



Sun and Moon The sun is in the constellation Taurus until June 21 , 
in Gemini until July 20, in Cancer until August 10, and in Leo there- 
after. It arrives at the summer solstice at 1:10p.m., EST, on June 21, 
the longest day (from sunrise to sunset) of the year and the beginning 
of summer in the Northern Hemisphere. The earliest sunrise occurs 
on June 14, however, and the latest sunset on June 28. On July 5, 
when the earth arrives at aphelion, the sun will be at its greatest dis- 
tance from the earth, about 94&apos;/i million miles. 

The moon will go through change early in each month this summer. 
The evening moon (as a crescent) will appear about the beginning of 
the second week — growing, brightening, and remaining later until full 
moon occurs after midmonth; then waning, dimming, and rising later 
as a morning moon through about the last week. Lunar phases are:

Stars and Planets The evening planets, so prominent earlier this 
year, will now become less conspicuous. In early June, you will still 
find Venus (the brighter) and Jupiter close together and well placed 
in the sunset sky, with Mars, Saturn, and the star Regulus (all in Leo) 
higher, to the left, and very close to each other. But during June, 
Jupiter sets earlier each night and soon disappears as an evening star. 
Venus, meantime, is still brightening and shifting farther from the sun 
and also moving to a part of its orbit unfavorable for evening viewing. 
Mars, now only half as bright as Saturn, is also moving swiftly east- 
ward, away from Saturn. It moves into Virgo before the end of July. 
But Saturn will not be alone for long. Venus moves close to it in early 
July, passing it on the 10th. In mid-August, Venus catches up to Mars. 

June 4: Mars and Saturn are in conjunction. 

June 7-8: The moon moves past Jupiter and Venus. 

June 11: Saturn, Mars, and Regulus are very close above the moon. 

June 12: Mars is in conjunction with Regulus. 

June 14: Mercury, in superior conjunction, enters the evening sky. 
All eight planets are now evening stars (above the horizon at sunset). 

June 21: Summer begins at 1:10 p.m., EST, north of the equator. 

July 8-10: On these evenings, Venus, Saturn, and Regulus will be 
exceptionally close, with Mars not far to their left, low in the 
western sky after sundown. 

July 18: Saturn passes Regulus tonight, moving from the star&apos;s 
right (where it has been since January) to its left. 

July 19: Perigee moon occurs only six hours before full moon. 

July 21: Mercury is at its greatest distance to the left of the sun. 

July 29: The Delta Aquarid meteor shower will reach maximum 
this morning (about 20 per hour). 

August 7: The crescent moon is very close to Venus and Mars to- 
night, covering both planets in turn. 

August 10-14: Best days for viewing the Perseid meteor shower. 
Maximum (about 50 per hour) will be on the 12th. 

* Hold the Star Map so the compass direction you face is at the bottom; then 
match the stars in the lower half of the map with those In the sky near the 
horizon. The map is for 1:20 p.m. on June 1; 12:25 p.m. on June 15; 11:25 
P.M. on June 30; 10:25 p.m. on July 15; 9:20 p.m. on July 31; and 8:25 p.m. 
on August 15; but it can also be used for an hour before and after those 
times.

The War Between Indians 
and Animals 



by Calvin Martin 



Early Canadian fur traders 
reaped a bonanza because 
some eastern tribes revenged 
themselves against wildlife 

Over the past five centuries the 
American Indian has been called 
everything from &quot;noble savage&quot; to 
&quot;besotted alcoholic&quot; — epithets that 
say as much about the conscience of 
contemporary white society as they 
do about the state of the Indian. So 
it was that in the heat and froth of 
the 1960s environmental movement, 
yet another title — &quot;ecological In- 
dian&quot; — was conferred on the ideal- 
ized native American, who was 
paraded out before an admiring 
throng and hailed as the high priest 
of the Ecology Cult. According to 
law professor Rennard Strickland, 
&quot;It is not an accident that the idea 
of ecology and the ideal of the In- 
dian should emerge simultaneously 
as national issues, &apos; &apos; and former Sec- 
retary of the Interior Stewart Udall 
concurred. Both Indian activist 
Vine Deloria, Jr., and Kiowa novel- 
ist N. Scott Momaday urged white 
Americans to &quot;adopt Indian ways 
to survive.&quot; 

Critics of the ecological Indian 
were quick to respond. In 1972 the 
frontier historian W. H. Hutchinson 
expressed a strongly negative opin- 
ion in his &quot;Dissenting Voice Raised 
Against the Resurrection of the 
Myth of the Noble Savage.&quot; A past 
master of sarcasm and metaphor, 
Hutchinson blasted the dewy-eyed 
romantics who would claim for the 
Indian such a delicate ecological 
conscience &quot;as to make the Sierra 
Club seem an association of strip 
miners by comparison.&quot; Nature, as 
he cogently put it, &quot;is not a benign 
bovine with a teat for every questing 
mouth!&quot; Hutchinson went on to say 
that the Indian revered nature be- 



cause he had no other choice; that 
he perceived nature as being con- 
trolled by supernatural forces that 
he was obliged to propitiate if he 
hoped for success in life; failure to 
perform the proper rituals, adhere 
to taboos, and conduct ceremonials 
was tantamount to inviting disaster. 
We ought to dry our eyes and recog- 
nize that the Indian was above all a 
self-centered pragmatist when it 
came to land use. 

Hutchinson ended his assault 
with a troubling question: &quot;If the 
Amerind was a truly dedicated 
ecologist, why did he so succumb to 
the artifacts offered him by Euro- 
peans that he stripped his land of 
furs and pelts to get them?&quot; His 
answer: &quot;He did so because he was 
only human. The white man oflfered 
him material goods — iron and 
woolens and gewgaws and alcohol 
— which he could not resist. These 
riches, which is what they were, 
gave his life an expanded dimension 
it had never known before. No 
power on earth could keep him from 
getting these things by raid or trade, 
once he had been exposed to them. 
To ask him to have refrained from 
making his material life fuller and 
richer is to ask him for far more than 
we ever have asked of ourselves.&quot; 
Hutchinson had identified the eco- 
logical Indian&apos;s Achilles&quot; heel. 

Hutchinson&apos;s response is essen- 
tially that of most other ethnohis- 
torians who have pondered the In- 
dian&apos;s role in the fur trade — the 
most notorious and unequivocal 
case of resource abuse by native 
North Americans. There can be no 
denying that the native hunter was 
the principal agent of wildlife de- 
struction in most theaters of the fur 
trade, particularly in Canada where 
whites operated mainly as brokers 
rather than as hunters and trappers. 
In Canada, where the evidence 



against the Indian is most damaging, 
there were, in fact, mitigating cir- 
cumstances that make the Subarctic 
Indian&apos;s motive in wildlife extermi- 
nation considerably less crass than 
scholars such as Hutchinson have 
conceded. Without denying the es- 
sential validity of Hutchinson&apos;s 
statement that Indians were initially 
impressed with the items proffered 
them by Europeans — and at the risk 
of being accused of ennobling the 
&quot;savage&quot; once more — I would give 
a somewhat different, localized ver- 
sion of what happened when all 
those marvelous items of Old World 
origin first reached the native hunt- 
ers of eastern Canada. 

Put succinctly, the fur trade 
throughout eastern Canada was a 
paradox. Native hunters felt a sense 
of spiritual kinship with major game 
animals, including those sought for 
their pelts — a relationship tempered 
by genuine awe and fear of these 
powerful animal beings and their 
spiritual wardens, or game bosses. 
Historic evidence seems to cor- 
roborate the modern ethnographer&apos;s 
claim that Subarctic Indians have 
traditionally been obsessed by the 
responsibilities of the hunter and 
the hunted toward one another. In- 
cluded among these responsibilities 
has been the understanding between 
man and animal that game can be 
harvested only in modest quantities. 
Animals have always considered 
immoderate slaughter to be pre- 
sumptuous. According to present- 
day tribesmen and their early his- 
toric ancestors, game animals vol- 
untarily surrender themselves to be 
slain by the needy hunter. The in- 
junction against overkill could not 
be circumvented by disposing of the 
animal remains in a manner pleasing 
to the slain beast, after which re- 
generation would normally occur. 
Such procedures worked only when 



92 



, the hunter restricted his talce to a 
reasonable quota agreed upon be- 

; tween his spirit being and that of the 
animal he yearned for, and com- 
municated with, in his dreaming, 
singing, drumming, and sweating 
-all of this prior to the actual 
hunt. 

Subarctic hunters also considered 
animals to be persons with whom 
humans could talk and enjoy other 
forms of social intercourse, includ- 
ing the right to harvest these &quot;ani- 
mal persons&quot; on a limited basis. In 
sum, man and animal have tradi- 
tionally had a relationship of mutual 
courtesy: intelligent animal beings 
and intelligent human beings had 
contracted long ago not to abuse 
one another. Animals took oflFense 
not only when they were slaugh- 
tered in excessive numbers but also 
when they were subjected to other 
forms of disrespect: when humans 
failed to address them by the proper 
titles of endearment or when their 
remains were defiled by being 
thrown to the dogs or when their 
flesh was consumed by menstruat- 
ing women. Humans, in their turn, 
were offended when animals re- 
fused to be taken in their traps or 
otherwise eluded the famished 
hunter and his family. Whenever 
one side transgressed the bounds of 
propriety the other side unleashed 
its arsenal of weapons to chastise 
the offenders and bring them back 
into line. For their part, animals 
could punish humans by fleeing 
their hunting areas, rendering their 
weapons impotent, or afflicting 
them with disease. 

The paradox emerges in the early 
records, which describe how 
Canadian Indians hunted fur 
bearers and other mammals with 
abandon. One would think that their 
hunting ethic would have precluded 
the orgiastic destruction of wildlife. 



Fermentation: The birth 
of a fine red wine* 




Despite the wealth of sophisticated 
equipment available today, there is no 
substitute for the judgment and care of a 
dedicated winemaker 

At no time is this more apparent than 
during the critical days of fermentation, 
for it is at this stage, the birth of the wine, 
that taste, character, aroma, body and 
color are in large part determined. 

Our Winemaker&apos;s Role 

Consider just a few of our wine- 
maker&apos;s responsibilities during the 
vinting of a fine red wine, such as our 
Zinfandel. 

When the grapes arrive at our crusher, 
a State Agricultural Inspector measures 
sugar content and physical condition. 
But, in addition, our winemaker checks 
and tastes for grape quality. 

If our winemaker feels a particular lot 
of grapes does not measure up to our 
requirements, he will reject them. 

Those grapes which he approves 
move directly to our &quot;crusher-stemmer&quot; 
which removes the stems and then 
gently &quot;crushes&quot; the fruit. 

The Right Yeast 

Since fermentation results from the 
natural interaction of yeast with the 
sugars and acids in the juice, the selec- 
tion of the right yeast from the many 
available to our winemaker is crucial. 

Not only is it up to the winemaker to 
determine the proper yeast strain to 
begin the process of fermentation, but he 
must also select the precise quantity. Too 
little, and the juice will ferment too slowly 
and the wild yeasts naturally present on 
the skins may again become active. Too 
much, and the juice will ferment too 
rapidly and develop a &quot;yeasty taste!&apos; The 
winemaker must select exactly the right 
yeast, in exactly the proper quantity, to 
yield a wine whose flavor is true to the 
grape, with all the desirable taste charac- 
teristics in balance. 

The Constant Vigil 

Now begins a vigil that will remain 
unbroken for 72 to 96 hours. 

Because fermentation creates heat, 
temperature must be carefully con- 
trolled — otherwise the delicacy of the 
wine may be irrevocably destroyed. 
Through years of experience we have 
determined that 70 to 75 degrees F is the 
ideal for a red wine of true excellence. 



and this is the maximum Gallo wine- 
makers permit. 

As the liquid ferments in the presence 
of the skins, each passing hour brings 
changes in flavor, in color, in aroma, and 
in body which the winemaker monitors 
constantly, partially with sophisticated 
instruments, but primarily through his 
own highly developed sense of taste and 
smell. At each tasting, our winemaker 
must be able to call to mind all the 
various vintages of his past and how they 
tasted at each particular stage. He must 
mentally compare them and predict 
precisely how this Zinfandel will taste 
when fully mature. This talent we have 
found to be more than an acquired skill; 
it is, rather, a rare gift. 

Flavor: Skin Deep and More 

As the juice ferments, skins and pulp 
float to the top, forming a &quot;cap&quot; vital to 
the wine&apos;s development. This is because 
the skins are the repository of the cells 
which eventually determine the charac- 
ter of the finished wine. 

If the wine is to achieve its true peak of 
flavor, color, body and aroma, the cap 
must not be permitted to dry out and 
harden. Therefore, we designed a system 
that circulates the fermenting wine over 
the entire surface of the cap. The wine- 
maker must determine exactly how 
often and for what duration the ferment- 
ing wine will be circulated over the cap. 
These are critical decisions — too much 
circulation will draw less desirable flavors 
from the skins, too little will cause the 
wine to be lacking in body and color 

When his tasting tells him the wine is 
fermented to the precise degree that 
augurs a superb Zinfandel, he halts the 
process by lowering the temperature. He 
then has the wine carefully drawn off and 
removed to the cooperage for aging. 

Now, finally, the wine can rest. And so, 
for the moment, can our winemaker 

Our Goal 

The same meticulous attention to 
detail so evident during the fermentation 
process is given at every step of our 
winemaking process. Here at the winery 
of Ernest and Julio Gallo, our purpose is 
to bring you the finest wine that skill and 
care can produce.

But that ethic was apparently sus- 
pended during the heyday of the 
Canadian fur trade. The Indian de- 
scribed in these records is pecul- 
iarly hostile toward animals: he 
hunts the beaver and other large 
game with a vengeance; his mood is 
vindictive. Furthermore, he has 
clearly lost touch with much of the 
spirit world that sustained him prior 
to the coming of Europeans. Some- 
time in the early contact period, 
nature — the universe — seems to 
have become inarticulate and the 



dialogue between human persons 
and animal persons ceased, at least 
temporarily. The French surgeon- 
botanist Sieur de Diereville con- 
veyed in 1708 the essence of this 
sentiment in some wretched verse 
on the art of beaver hunting: 

They [the natives] take precautions 

in regard to all 
The varied needs of life. The Indian 

race. 
Well qualified to judge the point, 

because 
Of its familiarity with all their arts. 



Believe that they [beaver] have been 

endowed 
With an abounding genius, and hold 

too 
It is pure malice that they do not talk. 

Or as the Recollet priest Chres- 
tien Le Clercq explained it in 1691, 
the Micmac Indians who still in- 
sisted that the beaver had &quot;sense&quot; 
and formed a &quot;separate nation,&quot; 
maintained that they &quot;would cease 
to make war upon these animals if 
these would speak, howsoever lit-

tie, in order that they might learn 
whether the Beavers are among 
their friends or their enemies.&quot; 
Near the turn of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, surveyor David Thompson 
and fur trader Alexander Henry, the 
Elder, encountered Cree and Ojib- 
wa in southern Manitoba and the 
upper Great Lakes region who re- 
ferred to some sort of conspiracy of 
animals against mankind for which 
the beaver, at any rate, were &quot;now 
all to be destroyed.&quot; Together with 
these cryptic remarks on the overt 
antagonism between man and ani- 
mal, there is considerable explicit 
and inferential evidence proving 
that the man-animal relationship 
had gone sour. 

Indian hunters now tracked game 
remorselessly; no thought was 
given to the animals&quot; welfare as the 
beaver and other fur bearers were 
hounded to near extinction in parts 
of the north woods. What made the 
Indian apostatize? I believe the an- 
swer lies in the devastating impact 
of diseases on these people. 

The early records contain fre- 
quent references to eastern Cana- 
dian Indians, in common with na- 
tive Americans throughout the 
hemisphere, being decimated by a 
variety of Old World contagions, 
most significantly, smallpox, in- 
fluenza, and plague. Folkloric and 
circumstantial evidence place the 
arrival of these diseases well before 
the date of first recorded European 
contact. In all likelihood coastal 
Indians were exposed to deadly 
bacteria and viruses carried by Bris- 
tol, Norman, Basque, and other 
European fishermen who were 
working the various banks off the 
Canadian Maritimes some years be- 
fore the Genoan-born merchant 
John Cabot &quot;discovered&quot; and offi- 
cially took possession of the area for 
the English king, Henry VII, in 
1497. Transmitted by infected na- 
tives, the diseases rolled inland. 
And the death rate was appalling. In 
the early seventeenth century the 
Jesuit Pierre Biard recorded that the 
Micmacs &quot;are astonished and often 
complain that . . . they are dying 
fast, and the population is thinning 
out.&quot; Similar testimonials occur 
throughout the Jest/it Relations and 
other early records of New France. 
The victims had never encountered 
these diseases until the Europeans 
arrived, and the high mortality was 
due to the natives&quot; lack of adequate 
immunological protection.

Eastern Canadian Indians have 
always interpreted major illness as 
punishment for some sort of trans- 
gression, generally meted out by 
oflFended wildlife spirits. Fitting the 
ethnographic and historic records 
together, I conjecture that prior to 
sustained contact with whites, who 
subsequently would be correctly 
suspected of being responsible for 
this calamity, the eastern Canadian 
aborigine followed conventional 
logic and blamed these mysterious, 
devastating epidemics on angered 
wildlife. Here was the &quot;con- 
spiracy&quot; of animal against man 
alluded to by Cree and Ojibwa 
sources: wildlife had decided, for 
some obscure reason, to direct their 
most potent weapon against man, 
who now felt himself imperiled by 
their terrible wrath. Wildlife had 
broken the compact of mutual cour- 
tesy. The dialogue between man 
and animal became acrimonious 
and then simply ended for many 
individuals. 

Such was the emotion-charged 
setting that European traders and 
missionaries penetrated in the 
seventeenth and eighteenth cen- 
turies. Gently urging the Indians to 
furnish furs for the European mar- 
ket and renounce their &quot;supersti- 
tions&quot; for the sake of the Gospel, 
the Europeans could not have found 
a more receptive audience. The In- 
dians were predisposed to respond 
positively to both requests. Their 
spiritual complex a shambles, they 
now turned on their former col- 
leagues, the game, with a vengeance 
and an improved hunting tech- 
nology. The Indians were, as some 
Micmac aptly phrased it, literally 
making war upon the beaver. 

The Canadian Indian may well 
have been a conservationist of ani- 
mal resources as long as he consid- 
ered them articulate and congenial 
beings — a hunting ethic that has 
been revived in this century by 
Indians in many parts of Canada. 
The message for those environmen- 
talists who have looked to the 
Indian for spiritual inspiration, how- 
ever, is not encouraging. The north- 
ern hunter conserved animals only 
when the two engaged in courteous 
dialogue. It is unlikely that Western 
societies will ever duplicate this 
particular, functionally conserva- 
tionist vision of the universe. Na- 
ture, it seems to me, will be forever 
deaf and dumb in the presence of 
Judeo-Christian societies. D

Hand-hewn Homes 



The Log Cabin, by Alex W. 
Bealer and John O. Ellis. Bane 
Piihlishiiig, distributed by Crown 
Publishers, $17.95 hard-cover; 
$^.95 paperback, 192 pp., illus. 

Simple, durable, symbol of the 
American frontier, the log cabin is 
thought of as a New World phe- 
nomenon. But like Americans 
themselves, the log cabin&apos;s ante- 
cedents are to be found in Europe 
— most likely in prehistoric Scan- 



dinavia. There, in forests similar to 
those of North America, abundant 
logs were easily available for the 
construction of simple dwellings 
strong enough to keep out the 
elements and last for generations. 
The basic log cabin was built of 
horizontal logs, notched and fitted 
at the corners and chinked with 
clay or moss to make them 
weathertight. A strong shingled 
roof with a chimney completed 
the structure. A simple cabin could 



be built by a man of modest skills 
using a minimum of tools — the 
American ax and the froe, a wedge- 
shaped cleaving tool. 

By the mid-eighteenth century, 
with the push westward, the log 
cabin was to be found in almost 
every settlement, but while the 
method of construction remained 
the same, the design changed and 
was adapted to suit the needs of the 
builder so that each cabin had its 
own character. Most houses had

additional log buildings that served 
as barns, corncribs, or storage 
sheds, and often the entire complex 
of buildings was surrounded by rail 
fencing. The greatest advantage of 
the log house, aside from the avail- 
ability of the building material, was 
that with the help of friends and 
neighbors an adequate home could 
be built in a day or two. And for 
people moving into previously un- 
settled areas, immediate shelter 
was a matter of survival.

The authors of this book on 
wilderness homes have assembled 
an impressive array of photographs 
to illustrate the remarkable variety 
of this seemingly simple form of 
construction. And if their detailed 
descriptions on how such homes 
are built are not enough to make 
you try it yourself, they have been 
thoughtful enough to provide a list 
of the better-known manufacturers 
of log cabin kits.

Additional Reading 



Petra (p. 42) 

Iain Browning uses many pic- 
tures, diagrams, maps, and tables in 
iiis study of the tombs, artifacts, 
ruins, and writings of the Naba- 
taeans: Petra (Park Ridge: Noyes 
Press, 1973). The book reviews the 
origins and history of Nabataea, dis- 
cusses the historians of Petra, and 
describes what the site is like to- 
day. A massive archeological trea- 
tise, Petra: Its History and Monu- 
ments (London: Country Life, 



1925), by Sir Alexander Kennedy, 
contains more than 200 pictures re- 
produced in photogravure. In 
Deities and Dolphins: The Story of 
the Nabataeans (New York: 
Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, Inc., 
1965), Nelson Glueck studies the 
Nabataeans&apos; relationship to Arabia 
and the Fertile Crescent and to the 
Mediterranean littoral. His book, 
based on excavations at Khirbet 
Tannur, covers the history, econ- 
omy, art, architecture, language. 




and religion of the Nabataeans and 
includes an extensive bibliography, 
plans, and maps. Philip C. Ham- 
mond has written many books and 
articles (with bibliographies) on 
Petra and the Nabataeans. Among 
them are The Nabataeans: Their 
History. Culture and Archaeology, 
volume 37 of &quot;Studies in Mediter- 
ranean Archaeology&quot; (Lund: 
Astr0ms, 1973), &quot;Petra&quot; {Biblical 
Archaeologist, vol. 23, 1960, pp. 
29-32), and &quot;Rose-Red City of 
Petra&quot; (Natural History, February 
1964, pp. 15-25). 

Terns (p. 54) 

When Michael Harwood spent a 
summer doing bird research at the 
American Museum of Natural His- 
tory&apos;s research station on Great 
Gull Island he kept a journal, which 
grew into The View from Great 
Gull (New York: E. P Dutton and 
Co., Inc., 1976). Spirit of Survival: 
A Natural and Personal History of 
Terns, by John Hay, president of 
the Cape Cod Museum of Natural 
History, covers the nesting, breed- 
ing, courtship, and specialized 
habits of terns and discusses tern 
survival. A basic book for serious 
students is Arthur C. Bent&apos;s Life 
Histories of North American Gulls 
and Terns (New York: Dover Pub- 
lications, Inc., 1921). Natural His- 
tory recently had two articles on 
terns: &quot;Late-blooming Terns,&quot; by 
Paul A. Buckley and Francine G. 
Buckley (April 1976, pp. 46-55) and 
&quot;The Early Warning of the Terns,&quot; 
by Helen Hays and Robert W. Rise- 
brough (November 1971, pp. 38- 
47). &quot;Pollutant Concentrations in 
Abnormal Young Terns from Long

Swamp Dwellers of Bahia (p. 62) 

Raft Fishermen: Tradition and 
Change in the Brazilian Peasant 
Economy (Bloomington: Indiana 
University Press, 1970) and The 
Brazilian Peasantry (New York: 
Columbia University Press, 1975) 
are two works by Shepard Forman 
that grew out of the author&apos;s travels 
throughout Brazil. The latter dis- 
cusses the problems of &quot;masters 
and slaves,&quot; starvation, politics, 
religion, and social protest in Bahia. 
In Sharecroppers of the Sertao: 
Economics and Dependence on a 
Brazilian Plantation (Stanford: 
Stanford University Press, 1971), 
Allen W. Johnson regards the eco- 
nomic life of resident plantation 
laborers in the state of Ceara, 
Brazil, as an ecological adaptation. 
In Obstacles to Development in 
Latin America (Garden City: 
Doubleday and Company, Inc., 
1970), economist Celso Furtado 
uses Brazil as a particular case to 
direct the reader&apos;s attention to ex- 
ternal factors that perpetuate under- 
development. Josue de Castro, au- 
thor of Death in the Northeast 
(New York: Random House, Inc., 
1966), describes his book as &quot;a 
sociological study by one who is 
committed to a partisan and pro- 
gressive point of view.&quot; Two 
articles on lunar-tide fishing sys- 
tems are &quot;The Lunar-tide Fishing 
Cycle in Northeastern Brazil&quot; 
(Ethnology. 1974. pp. 379-92) and 
&quot;Traditional Time Reckoning and 



Resource Utilization&quot; {Micro- 
nesica, December 1976, pp. 211- 
46). Economic Development and 
Cultural Change published &quot;The 
Population Question in North- 
eastern Brazil: Its Economic and 
Ideological Dimensions,&quot; by Her- 
man E. Daly, July 1970, pp. 536-74. 

Plant Cells (p. 74) 

Two articles on the structure of 
land plants have appeared in Scien- 
tific American: &quot;Roots,&quot; by 
Emanuel Epstein (May 1973, pp. 
48-58), and &quot;The Mechanical De- 
sign of Trees,&quot; by Thomas A. 
McMahon (July 1975, pp. 92-102). 
Trees: Structure and Function, by 
Martin H. Zimmermann and Claud 
L. Brown (New York: Springer- 
Verlag Inc., 1975), delves more 
deeply into the subject. &quot;The Adap- 
tive Characteristics of Desert 
Plants,&quot; by Otto T. Solbrig and 
Gordon H. Orians (American Scien- 
tist. July-August 1977, pp. 412-21), 
discusses the economics of the 
photosynthesis of evergreen shrubs, 
succulents, drought evaders, and 
phreatophytes and their ecological 
distribution in the desert. 

Indians and the Fur Trade (p. 92) 

The special relationship of the 
Montagnais-Naskapi of Canada to 
their spiritual world; their use of 
divination, magic, medicine, and 
charms; and their concept of the 
soul and the universe are the sub- 
jects of Frank G. Speck&apos;s Naskapi: 




The Savage Hunters of the Labra- 
dor Peninsula (Norman: University 
of Oitlahoma Press, 1977). Indians 
in the Fur Trade: Their Role as 
Trappers, Hunters, and Middlemen 
in the Lands Southwest of Hudson 
Bay, 1600-1860 (Toronto: Univer- 
sity of Toronto Press, 1974), by 
Arthur J. Ray, concentrates on the 
effects of the fur trade on native 
Americans. Much of the informa- 
tion was gathered from the Hud- 
son&apos;s Bay Company&apos;s microfilm 
collection. In The Fur Trade in 
Canada: An Introduction to Cana- 
dian Economic History, by Harold 
Innis (Toronto: University of 
Toronto Press, 1930, rev. ed. 1970), 
the fur trade is described as the pri- 
mary cause for the expansion of set- 
tlement in Canada. Innis traveled in 
the fur trade territories and re- 
searched original documents and 
records. Exploring the Northwest 
Territory: Sir Alexander Macken- 
zie&apos;s Journal of a Voyage by Bark 
Canoe from Lake Athabasca to the 
Pacific Ocean in the Summer of 
1789 (Norman: University of Okla- 
homa Press, 1967) was recorded by 
the director of the Northwest Fur 
Company while exploring what 
came to be known as the Mackenzie 
River System. Full of detailed de- 
scriptions of the customs, dress, 
and habits of native Americans, the 
journal has a historical introduc- 
tion by the editor, T. H. McDonald, 
and a bibliography. Winner Take 
All: The Trans-Canada Canoe 
Trail, by David Lavender (New 
York: McGraw-Hill Book Com- 
pany, 1977), is the story of the 
struggle of the Hudson&apos;s Bay Com- 
pany, the Northwest Company, In- 
dians, French, and Scots to control 
the fur trade along the 4,000 miles of 
interlocking waterways that span 
the continent. The Beaver, journal 
of the Hudson&apos;s Bay Company, 
Winnipeg, Manitoba, is full of infor- 
mation on Canadian Indians. In 
1965 it ran a series of articles, &quot;The 
Story of the Canadian Fur Trade,&quot; 
in four issues, spring through win- 
ter. A standard reference for eth- 
nologists is The Indians of Canada, 
by Diamond Jenness (Toronto: Uni- 
jversity of Toronto Press, 1963).

Wtien ttie Fauna Preservation Society was formed in 
1903 its first project and first success was persuading 
tfie British Colonial Office to establisfi game reserves in 
Uganda and ttie Sudan. Ttiis fielped prevent the extinc- 
tion of the northern white rhino and introduced Africa&apos;s 
first unified conservation programme at a time when 
animals there were being slaughtered indiscriminately. 
In the 75 years since the Fauna Preservation Society has 
helped save endangered species throughout the world, 
in operations perhaps best typified by the eleventh-hour 
rescue in 1 963 of what may have been the last three 
wild Arabian oryx. 

As the world&apos;s oldest international conservation soci- 
ety, the FPS has a long-standing reputation for sound 
scientific groundwork, the ability to get direct results 
quickly, and having grants available when they are 
needed, rather than months or years later. 

Oryx, the Society&apos;s respected journal, presents ong- 
inal research, news and comment on wildlife presen/a- 
tion and is sent regularly to members in 77 countries. 

We would like to expand our membership in North

At the Museum 



Although most schools are on 
summer holiday, the Hayden Plane- 
tarium continues to buzz with ex- 
cited children. Many have probably 
seen Star Wars and Close Encoun- 
ters of the Third Kind at least twice, 
but are still captivated by the size, 
weight, and complexity (29,000 
parts) of the Planetarium&apos;s projec- 
tor. As the show begins, children 
cheer when the New York City 
skyline appears on the rim of the 
domed screen overhead. And while 
the projector turns and the night sky 
brightens on the dome, some chil- 
dren can be heard challenging 
others to spot a UFO (unidentified 
flying object). 

Mark Chartrand, chairman of 
the Hayden Planetarium, has been 
listening, and he has written the 
new show, UFOs and IFOs (June 
29 through November 20), with 
children and adults in mind. The 
Planetarium receives occasional 
phone calls reporting UFO sight- 
ings, and Chartrand says that 
according to the Gallup Poll, one 
American in ten has sighted a UFO. 
Since some of these people are 
bound to turn up in the Planetarium 
audience, the show will describe 
how UFOria came about, what sort 
of sightings people report, what can 
really appear in the sky. 

Chartrand believes that most 
sightings are of familiar objects — 
planets, balloons, aircraft, reenter- 
ing satellites, meteors, atmospheric 
illusions — seen under unfamiliar 
circumstances. IFOs (identified 
flying objects) are mistaken for 
UFOs because &quot;today, many of us 
are isolated from the sky. If you live 
in a city, you can&apos;t even see it very 
well. And unlike our ancestors, we 
don&apos;t have to be aware of the 
moon&apos;s phases in order to sustain 
ourselves, to plant and harvest at 
the right times.&quot; 

Eighteen years ago, psycho- 
analyst Carl Jung speculated that 
&quot;the worldwide rumor about flying 
saucers&quot; began as a psychological 
reaction to the possibility of space 
travel. He saw in UFOs &quot;a golden 
opportunity to see how a legend is 
formed.&quot; The Planetarium show 
will re-create some legendary sight- 



ings, including one incident that oc- 
curred in the late 1940s, when pilots 
in an airplane over Alabama 
thought that they were being buzzed 
by a UFO. The object turned out to 
be a meteor passing over them. 

Some historians pinpoint the 
birth of contemporary interest in 
UFOlogy as June 24, 1947, when a 
pilot in a private plane encountered 
nine disklike objects, &quot;flying 
saucers,&quot; near Mount Rainier. 
Chartrand, however, says that re- 
ports of sightings go back thousands 
of years. One of the earliest may be 
recorded in the Old Testament, the 
Prophet Ezekiel&apos;s vision of four 
flying wheels with rims &quot;full of eyes 
round about them. ...&quot; 

Since film makers have been re- 
sponsible for this year&apos;s excitement 
over UFOs, the Planetarium will, 
appropriately enough, be the setting 
for a summer lecture course on 
&quot;The Universe of Science Fiction 
Film,&quot; to be held on five Tuesday 
evenings from July 1 1 to August 8. 
The moderator, Ben Bova, novelist 
and editor of Analog, will introduce 
each film and lead a general discus- 
sion after the showing. The debate 
will concentrate on ideas and prob- 
lems raised in the films, not on film 
making technique. The program of 
six films includes two classics in the 
annals of spectacular special ef- 
fects, 2001: A Space Odyssey {\96») 
and The Fantastic Voyage (1966); in 
the latter a group of scientists re- 
duced to the size of microbes jour- 
ney through a man&apos;s body to re- 
move inoperable cancer cells from 
his brain. 

Two other films take the classic 
science fiction view of the scientist 
as an irresponsible meddler in dan- 
gerous matters. In Dr. Cyclops 
(1940), a mad, nearsighted scientist 
uses a chemical potion to reduce 
people and animals to puppet size. 
The Invisible Man (1933) is based 
on H.G. Wells&apos;s tale, in which a 
scientist experimenting with an 
Indian drug becomes both invisible 
and insane, setting out to rule the 
world as a frighteningly powerful 
invisible terrorist. Another film. 
The Forbin Project (1970), is based 
on D.F. Jones&apos;s novel, Colossus, 



in which scientists&apos; inventions cor- 
rect their makers&apos; mistakes: a 
supercomputer in the Pentagon 
connects with another in the 
Kremlin, and the two enforce world 
peace. Probably the most provok- 
ing film on the agenda is Invasion 
of the Body Snatchers (1956), in 
which huge seedpods drain sleeping 
humans of their likenesses and 
minds, leaving zombielike replace- 
ments who intone chilling state- 
ments, such as &quot;love, ambition, 
desire, faith — without them, life is 
so simple.&quot; 

Film course sessions will start at 
7:00 P.M. and end at about 10:30 p.m. 
Tuition is $30. and there will be no 
single admissions. For further infor- 
mation, call the Planetarium at (212) 
873-1300, extension 300 or 206. 

Other Events 

Saturday, June 3, from 11:00 
A.M. to 4:30 P.M. and Sunday, June 
4, from noon to 4:30 p.m. the 
Museum will present a weekend 
Festival of Nature Films. There will 
be several speakers, including Kjell 
Sandved, who specializes in film- 
ing tiny beings. Sandved will pre- 
sent Curious Creatures and Mini- 
monsters in the Museum au- 
ditorium at 3:00 p.m. on Sunday. 

On four consecutive Wednesday 
evenings, June 7, 14, 21, and 28, 
&quot;How Yukong Moved the Moun- 
tains,&quot; a series of films made in the 
People&apos;s Republic of China by Joris 
Ivens and Marceline Loridan, will 
be shown in the Museum audi- 
torium at 7:00 p.m. The series con- 
centrates on the everyday life of the 
mainland Chinese, and studies the 
city of Shanghai, rehearsals at the 
Peking circus and opera, and people 
at work — in stores, craft shops, 
fishing villages, and oil fields. 

On June 17 and 18, from 1:00 to 
4:30 P.M. the Museum will present 
a Japanese Weekend, featuring 
films, theater, and dance per- 
formances. 

Unless otherwise noted. Museum 
events are free to Members and to 
those who have paid the Museum&apos;s 
discretionary admission fee.

SOMEHOW SCOTCH 

BOTTLED ELSEWHERE 

ISN&apos;T QUITE THE SAME. 

ContraRV to popular belief, many More brands of Scotch 
are bottled in America than in Scotland. They are bulk- 
shipped and boHled here, often using municipal water. 

The makers of CuKy Sark, however, Remain adamant 
on the subject of Scottish Scotch. 

To this day, CuHy SaRk is distiiied, blended, and 
bottled in Scotland, using the water of Loch Katrine. 
This results in a Scots Whisky of uncomMon smoothness 
which is worth every penny you pay for it. 

To recognise genuine Scots Whisky, you need look 
no fuRther thaw the very jop of the label on a bottle of 
Cutty Sark. 

It spells out exactly what you&apos;re geiiing right there 
in black and yell ow.

Morning mist rises to reveal an islet off the north shore of Lake Superior, 
the biggest, deepest, cleanest, and — /&quot; some ways — most fragile of the 
Great Lakes. Photograph by Paul von Baich. A special section on these 
lakes begins on page 46. 



Authors 



English-born Clifford H. Morti- 
mer, formerly director of the Scot- 
tish Marine Biological Association, 
has been a limnologist and director 
of the Center for Great Lakes Stud- 
ies at the University of Wisconsin- 
Milwaukee since 1966. On his first 
visit to the Great Lakes region in 
1953, Mortimer was intrigued by 
the &quot;evidence of internal wave mo- 
tions in temperature records of 
water intakes of cities bordering on 
the Great Lakes.&quot; His article in this 
special Great Lakes issue demon- 
strates his interest in the hydro- 
dynamics of large lakes. 




Eugene F. Stoermer writes: &quot;I 
really enjoy the type of old- 
fashioned botanical exploration that 
terrestrial botanists did one 
hundred or more years ago and find 
the same sense of discovery is still 
available working on microscopic 
communities in the depths of the 
lakes.&quot; A research algologist at the 
University of Michigan&apos;s Great 
Lakes Research Division, Stoermer 
has taken extended research cruises 
on all the Great&apos; Lakes. In his work 
on freshwater algal communities, he 
views the lakes &quot;as a vast, uncon- 
trolled experiment that has been 
carried out over the past few dec- 
ades. We are trying to reconstruct 
what has happened and determine 
the causes.&quot; 




Born in Czechoslovakia, Sergej 
Postupalsky emigrated to the United 
States in 1952 and was a draftsman 
in the automotive industry for 
twelve years. Stimulated by reports 
of declines in bald eagle popula- 
tions, he began doing ornithological 
fieldwork in 1960. Postupalsky has 
worked as a wildlife biologist for 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
the Canadian Wildlife Service, 
and the Michigan Department of 
Natural Resources and is now pre- 
paring his Ph.D. dissertation, on 
bald eagles and ospreys, at the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin. 



On Photographing the Invisible 



To the naked eye, it was a Swedish 
80-ore postage stamp. A rarity, and 
very valuable. 

The camera, however, told quite 
another story. The stamp was a coun- 
terfeit. 

Faint tracesoftampering that were 
hidden to the naked eye were revealed 
by the camera. Someone, somewhere, 
had ingeniously altered the stamp by 
chemically removing a surprint. The 
stamp was worthless. 




To the naked eye (left), the 
stamp uias genuine. To the cam- 
era (right), it was a counterfeit. 
Note the faint, dark traces of 
tampering now revealed in the 
upper section. 



What manner of exotic camera 
was this that could &quot;see&quot; the invisible? 

The lens: one of the 20 in the 
Hasselblad arsenal, the 105mm Zeiss 
UV-Sonnar f4.3. Designed for pho- 
tography within the ultraviolet portion 
of the electromagnetic spectrum, its 
costly quartz elements can detect 
radiations that are unseeable by the 
human eye. 

It has peered at objects in outer 
space, examined forgeries, laid bare 
the secrets of counterfeit money. Not 
a lens for everyone, obviously, but an 
indication of just how awesomely com- 
prehensive the Hasselblad System is. 

The camera: an otherwise per- 
fectly standard Hasselblad 500C/M, 



normally fitted with an 80mm Zeiss 
Planar f2.8 multi-coated lens. 

This is the basic model that allows 
you to tap into the vast Hasselblad 
System. It is one of the most bewilder- 
ingly versatile cameras the world has 
ever known. Yet so marvelously simple 
to operate that it often plays the part 
of the family snapshot camera. 

A True System. 

The Hasselblad System is a prodigious 
array of 4 cameras, 20 lenses, 8 view- 
finders, 9 film magazines, and over 
300 other accessories. Choose the right 
pieces, and your 500CA1 would be 
equipped for sports, aerial, architec- 
tural, and fashion photography. 

And portrait, landscape, medical, 
underwater, and news photography. 

And wildlife, laboratory, indus- 
trial, and child photography. 

And you would always have the 
right film in the camera at the right 
time. You can shift from color to 
black-and-white and back again to 
color — and resume shooting at pre- 
cisely the right frame— by popping in 
the protective dark slide and switch- 
ing film backs. 

The Camera with Nine Backs. 

There is a small button on the film 
backof every Hasselblad 500C/M. 
Slide it sideways with your thumb and 
the back will come away in your hand. 

The standard back holds 12 ex- 
posures. Each frame of film is 2H 
inches square, almost four times the 
area o/a35mm /rame.(Seebox,below 
right, for actual size.) 

This IS only the beginning. There 
are eight other backs available: Backs 
that let you change to a 6 x 4.5cm for- 
mat... or a 4.5 x 4.5cm superslide 
format for showing in any 35mm 
projector Backs that give you a choice 
of 1, 12, 16, 24, 70, or 500 exposures. 
A back that is a sheet-film adapter. 



Even two backs for Polaroid film, so 
you can check composition, lighting, 
and exposure ahead of time. 

You begin to realize why eight out 
of ten top commercial photographers 
surveyed name Hasselblad as the 
medium-format camera used in their 
work. 

Retained Value vs. 
Obsolescence. 

In an age when machines spew out 
cameras in the tens and hundreds of 
thousands, when flashy new models 
thrust last year&apos;s marvels into early 
obsolescence, Hasselblad goes its own 
way. 

Planned obsolescence is taboo at 
Hasselblad. All but two of the acces- 
sories for the 500C/M will fit every 
Hasselblad made since 1957 (except 
the Super Wide C) . . . and will fit every 
future Hasselblad. 

The greater pan of a year is spent 
on building each camera, much of it 
crafted by hand. And fully one quarter 
of the work force devotes its time to 
nothing but quality confol. 

Little wonder, then, that a pre- 
owned Hasselblad commands such a 
high price ... if its owner can be per- 
suaded to part with it at all.

Ronald L. Stuckey has success- 
t&apos;lilly combined his interests in his- 
tory and botany in many articles on 
the origins, changes, and geograph- 
ical relationships of aquatic flower- 
ing flora. A professor of botany at 
Ohio State University, Stuckey 
conducts research during the sum- 
mer at the Franz Theodore Stone 
Laboratory, Put-in-Bay, Ohio, 
where he collected the data used 
in his article in this issue. He also is 
studying the history of botanical 
exploration in the Ohio Valley from 
1800 to 1850. 




Author of the article on atmos- 
pheric pollution in the Great Lakes, 
Jon \. Parker is an ecologist in 
Argonne National Laboratory&apos;s 
Division of Environmental Impact 
Studies. Before undertaking his 



current fieldwork on Lake Michi- 
gan, Parker conducted research on 
trace element contamination in the 
aquatic ecosystems of Idaho&apos;s 
Lake Coeur d&apos;Alene and on Mas- 
sachusetts Bay. 





Like many of the authors in this 
issue, Steven A. Spigarelli is deeply 
concerned about the environment 
of the Great Lakes, both as scientist 
and outdoorsman. An ecologist at 
the Radiological and Environmental 
Research Division at Argonne Na- 
tional Laboratory in Illinois, 
Spigarelli is a fisherman, hunter, 
and camper on vacations and 
weekends. He writes, &quot;1 am con- 
vinced that natural habitats and wil- 
derness areas play a role in human 
social development. I am also con- 
cerned about the future of basic 
ecological research. The present 
trend is toward narrow, applied, 
site-specific studies that contribute 
very little to an understanding of 
ecosystem processes and func- 
tions.&quot;

Stanford H. Smith was a fish 
biologist with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service for twenty-eight 
years and is widely respected as an 
authority on the history of fish 



communities in the Great Lakes. 
Smith earned his Ph.D. degree from 
the University of Michigan, where 
he is now adjunct professor of natu- 
ral resources. 




&quot;I became interested in the story 
of the decline of the old-time fisher- 
men through my long association 
with commercial fishermen on the 
Great Lakes,&quot; writes Russell 
McKee. A former newspaper re-

another scientist who is able to 
combine his avocations — diving, 
fishing, and boating — with his voca-

recent study was a survey of con- 
taminants in fish at the mouths of 
all streams entering Lake Supe- 
rior,&quot; he writes. &quot;The crew aver-

KING COBRA 

The King Cobra... the largest venomous snake on earth. It can deliver more venom than 
any other snake— enough poison to kill a 5-ton elephant in a matter of hours! The 
sensors in its flicking, forked tongue alert it instantly to the presence of 
prey. Its lethal venom is discharged through short, hollow teeth... while - r&apos;^ | 

its double-hinged jaw and elastic throat permit it to consume prey 
much larger than itself. 

The King Cobra— deadly, mysterious— is just one of the fascinating 
creatures you&apos;ll meet in Reptiles&amp;Amphibians, your introductory \ 
volume in the Wild, Wild World of Animals library— based on the 
popular TV series from Time-Life Television. • &apos;..., 

Reptiles&amp;Amphibians will bring you face-to-face with some of the world&apos;s most 
elusive, dangerous, and useful creatures... all in their own way vital to mankind 
in keeping the balance of nature. You&apos;ll discover: 

Flying Snake of Borneo, actually capable 
of &quot;flight&quot; between trees up to 40 yards apart. . . 

Anaconda, a constrictor which grows to a length of 
more than 25 feet (one such snake was reported to have 
devoured a five-foot caiman— whole!) . . . 

Gila Monster, which hangs onto its prey with such 
tenacity, it sometimes can only be torn loose with pliers . . . 

Racer Snake, which can easily outdistance a man over rough 
terrain by means of a complex serpentine locomotion . . . 

Crocodile, slowly driven toward extinction by its own cannibalism 
of its young . . . and man&apos;s greed for its hide. 

Eastern Diamondback, responsible for more deaths in the U.S 
Cuban knight anole is the giant of the ^ jj j^ ^ combined . . . 

genus at 18 inches.

This View of Life 



by Stephen Jay Gould 



The Great Scablands Debate 



How could so vast 
an area of eastern 
Washington change so 
much in so little time? 

The introductory paragraphs of 
popular guidebooks usually tout 
prevailing orthodoxy in its purest 
form — dogma unadulterated by the 
&quot;howevers&quot; of professional writ- 
ing. Consider the following from 
our National Park Service&apos;s auto 
tour of Arches National Park: 

The world and all it contains is in a 
continuous process of change. Most of 
the changes in our world are very tiny 
and so escape our notice. They are 
real, however, and over an immense 
span of time their combined effect is to 
bring about great change. If you stand 



at the base of a canyon wall and rub 
your hand on the sandstone, hundreds 
of grains of sand are dislodged. It 
seems like an insignificant change, but 
that&apos;s how the canyon was formed. 
Various forces have dislodged and 
carried away grains of sand. Some- 
times the process is &quot;very fast&quot; (as 
when you rub the sandstone) but most 
of the time it is much slower. If you 
allow sufficient time, you can tear down 
a mountain or create a canyon — a few 
grains at a time. 

As the primary lesson of geology, 
this pamphlet proclaims that big 
results arise as the accumulated 
effect of tiny changes. Time, geolo- 
gy&apos;s inexhaustible resource, per- 
forms all the miracles. 

Yet, when the pamphlet turns to 
details, we encounter a different 



scenario for erosion in Arches. We 
learn that a balanced rock known 
as &quot;Chip Off the Old Block&quot; fell 
during the winter of 1975-76. Be- 
fore and after photographs of the 
magnificent Skyline Arch receive 
the following commentary: &quot;It re- 
mained thus for as long as man 
knew the arch, until, late in 1940, 
the block of stone fell, and Skyline 
was suddenly twice its former size.&quot; 
The arches form by sudden, inter- 
mittent collapse and toppling, not 
by imperceptible removal of sand 
grains. Yet gradualist orthodoxy is 
so entrenched that the authors of 
this pamphlet failed to note the in- 
consistency between their own fac- 
tual account and the stated theory 
of their introduction.

If you want to get more 
out of your 35mm camera, put 
Kodacolor 400 film into it. 
Kodacolor 400 film is so fast and 
versatile, you can get the kind 
of color prints you couldn&apos;t get 
before, without a flash. You 
can freeze the action in midair, 
midstride or midgallop, shoot in 
museums, theaters and arenas, 
and capture the sun from when 
it&apos;s barely a promise to when it&apos;s 
almost a memory. All in clear, 
sharp beautiful color prints with 
a grain that&apos;s surprisingly fine. 

So if you want to get it right 
in existing light with a film that&apos;s 
as fast as your camera, just add 
400 to 35. And you&apos;ve got it right. 



S% ^-&quot;&quot;&apos; 




With Kodacolor 400 film, you can take 35mm 
pictures indoors, without a flash. More natural-looking 
pictures, because you&apos;re using existing light instead 
of altering the light.

orthodo.xy before in this column 
(May and June-July 1977), in gen- 
eral and biological terms. I have 
argued that gradualism is a cul- 
turally conditioned prejudice, not 
a fact of nature, and I have made 
a plea for pluralism in concepts of 
rate. Punctuational change is at 
least as important as imperceptible 
accumulation. 

In this column, I tell a local, 
geologic story. But it conveys the 
same message — that dogmas pJay 
their worst role when they lead 
scientists to reject beforehand a 
counterclaim that could be tested 
in nature. 

Flow basalts of volcanic origin 
blanket most of eastern Washing- 
ton. These basalts are often cov- 
ered by a thick layer of loess, a fine- 
grained, loosely packed sediment 
blown in by winds during the ice 
ages. In the area between Spokane 
and the Snake and Columbia rivers 
to the south and west, many spec- 
tacular, elongate, subparallel chan- 
nelways are gouged through the 
loess and deeply into the hard ba- 
salt itself. These coulees, to use 
the local name, must have been 
conduits for glacial meltwaters, for 
they run down gradient from an 
area near the southern extent of 
the last glacier into the two major 
rivers of eastern Washington. The 
channeled scablands — as geologists 
designate the entire area — are puz- 
zling as well as awesome, and for 
several reasons: 

1. The channels connect across tall 
divides that once separated them. 
Since the channels are hundreds of 
feet deep, this extensive anasto- 
mosis indicates that a prodigious 
amount of water must once have 
flowed over the divide. 

2. As another item favoring chan- 
nels filled to the brim with water, 
the sides of the coulees contain 
many hanging valleys where tribu- 
taries enter the main channels. (A 
hanging valley is a tributary chan- 
nel that enters a main channel high 
above the main channel&apos;s modern 
stream bed.) 

3. The hard basalt of the coulees is 
deeply gouged and scoured. This 
pattern of erosion does not look like 
the work of a gentle river in the 
gradualist mode. 

4. The coulees often contain a 
number of high-standing hills com- 
posed of loess that has not been 
stripped away. These are arranged 



as if they were once islands in a 
gigantic braided stream. 
5. The coulees contain discon- 
tinuous deposits of basaltic stream 
gravel, often composed of rock 
foreign to the local area. 

Just after World War I, Chicago 
geologist J Harlen Bretz advanced 
an unorthodox hypothesis to ac- 
count for this unusual topography 
(yes, that&apos;s J without a period, and 
don&apos;t ever let one slip in, for his 
wrath can be terrible). He argued 
that the channeled scablands had 
been formed all at once by a single, 
gigantic flood of glacial meltwater. 
This local catastrophe filled the 
coulees, cut through hundreds of 
feet of loess and basalt, and then 
receded in a matter of days. He 
ended his major work of 1923 with 
these words: 

Fully 3,000 square miles of the Co- 
lumbia Plateau were swept by the gla- 
cial flood, and the loess and silt cover 
removed. More than 2,000 square 
miles of this area were left as bare, 
eroded rock-cut channel floors, now 
the scablands, and nearly 1,000 square 
miles carry gravel deposits derived 
from the eroded basalt. It nas a debacle 
which swept the Columbia Plateau. 

Bretz&apos;s hypothesis became a 
minor cause celebre within geo- 
logic circles. Bretz&apos;s stout and 
lonely defense of his catastrophic 
hypothesis won some grudging ad- 
miration, but virtually no support 
at first The &quot;establishment,&quot; as 
represented by the United States 
Geological Survey, closed ranks in 
opposition. They had nothing better 
to propose, and they did admit the 
peculiar character of scabland to- 
pography. But they held firm to the 
dogma that catastrophic causes 
must never be invoked so long as 
any gradualist alternative existed. 
Instead of testing Bretz&apos;s flood on 
its own merits, they rejected it on 
general principles. 

On January 12, 1927, Bretz 
bearded the lion in its lair and pre- 
sented his views at the Cosmos 
Club, in Washington, D.C., before 
an assembled group of scientists, 
many from the Geological Survey. 
The published discussion clearly in- 
dicates that a priori gradualism 
formed the basis for Bretz&apos;s glacial 
reception. I include typical com- 
ments from all detractors. 

W, C. Alden admitted &quot;it is not 
easy for one, like myself, who has 
never examined this plateau to

broadest possible opportunity of experienc- 
ing for yourself the natural history and 
culture of each area we explore. With the 
leadership of an accompanying naturalist, 
we search out the plants and animals, birds, 
and flowers ,,, rain forests, mountains, and 
tundra .:, seashore, lakes, and swamps of 
the regions we visit. We also study the ar- 
chitecture, archaeology, museum collec- 
tions, temples, and customs of the people. 

The current Directory of Worldwide 
Nature Tours describes 32 tours varying in 
length from 4 to 36 days and going to virtu- 
ally every part of the world. Included are 
Mexico, Peru, Hawaii, Alaska, Ladakh, Sri 
Lanka, Galapagos, Patagonia, Iceland, Scot- 
land, and Switzerland. Tour parties are 
small, the pace leisurely, and itineraries 
unusual.

supply ofiFhand an alternative ex- 
planation of the phenomena.&quot; 
Nonetheless, undaunted, he con- 
tinued: &quot;The main difficulties seem 
to be: (I) The idea that all the chan- 
nels must have been developed 
simultaneously in a very short time; 
and (2) the tremendous amount of 
water that he postulates. . . . The 
problem would be easier if less 
water was required and if longer 
time and repeated floods could be 
allotted to do the work.&quot; 

James Gilluly, this century&apos;s 
chief apostle of geologic gradual- 
ism, ended a long comment by 
noting &quot;that the actual floods in- 
volved at any given time were of 
the order of magnitude of the pres- 
ent Columbia&apos;s or at most a few 
times as large, seems by no means 
excluded by any evidence as yet 
presented.&quot; 

E. T. McKnight offered a grad- 
ualist alternative for the gravels: 
&quot;This writer believes them to be 
the normal channel deposits of the 
Columbia during its eastward shift 
over the area in preglacial, glacial, 
and postglacial times.&quot; 

G. R. Mansfield doubted that &quot;so 
much work could be done on basalt 
in so short a time.&quot; He also pro- 
posed a calmer explanation: &quot;The 
scablands seem to me better ex- 
plained as the effects of persistent 
ponding and overflow of marginal 
glacial waters, which changed their 
position or their places of outlet 
from time to time through a some- 
what protracted period.&quot; 

Finally, O. E. Meinzer admitted 
that &quot;the erosion features of the re- 
gion are so large and bizarre that 
they defy description.&quot; They did 
not, however, defy gradualist ex- 
planation: &quot;I believe the existing 
features can be explained by assum- 
ing normal stream work of the an- 
cient Columbia River.&quot; Then, more 
baldly than most of his colleagues, 
he proclaimed his faith: &quot;Before a 
theory that requires a seemingly 
impossible quantity of water is 
fully accepted, every effort should 
be made to account for the existing 
features without employing so 
violent an assumption.&quot; 

The story has a happy ending, 
at least from my point of view, 
for Bretz was delivered from the 
lion&apos;s lair by later evidence. Bretz&apos;s 
hypothesis has prevailed, and vir- 
tually all geologists now believe 
that catastrophic floods cut the 
channeled scablands. Bretz had 



found no adequate source for his 
floodwaters. He knew that the 
glaciers had advanced as far as 
Spokane, but neither he nor anyone 
else could imagine a reasonable way 
to melt so much water so rapidly. 
Indeed, we still have no mechanism 
for such an episodic melting. 

The solution came from another 
direction. Geologists found evi- 
dence for an enormous, ice-dammed 
glacial lake in western Montana. 
This lake emptied catastrophically 
when the glacier retreated and the 
dam broke. The spillway for its 
waters leads right into the chan- 
neled scablands. 

Bretz had presented no really 
direct evidence for deep, surging 
water. Gouging might have pro- 
ceeded sequentially, rather than all 
at once; anastomosis and hanging 
valleys might reflect filled coulees 
with gentle , rather than raging, flow . 
But when the first good aerial 
photographs of the scablands were 
taken, geologists noticed that sev- 
eral areas on the coulee floors are 
covered with giant stream bed rip- 
ples, up to 22 feet high and 425 feet 
long. Bretz, like an ant on a Yale 
bladderball, had been working on 
the wrong scale. He had been walk- 
ing over the ripples for decades but 
had been too close to see them. 
They are, he wrote quite correctly, 
&quot;difficult to identify at ground level 
under a cover of sagebrush.&quot; Ob- 
servations can only be made at 
appropriate scales. 

Hydraulic engineers can infer 
the character of flow from the size 
and shape of ripples on a stream 
bed. V. R. Baker estimates a maxi- 
mum discharge of 752,000 cubic 
feet per second in the scabland 
flow channels. Such a flood could 
have moved 36-foot boulders. 

I could end here with a cardboard 
version of the story much to my 
liking: Perceptive hero suppressed 
by blinded dogmatists stands firm, 
expresses his allegiance to fact 
over received opinion, and eventu- 
ally prevails by patient persuasion 
and overwhelming documentation. 
The outline of this tale is surely 
valid: gradualist bias did lead to an 
out-of-hand rejection of Bretz&apos;s 
catastrophic hypothesis, and Bretz 
(apparently) was right. But, as I 
read through the original papers, I 
realized that this good guy-bad guy 
scenario must yield to a more com- 
plex version. Bretz&apos;s opponents 
were not benighted dogmatists.

They did have a priori preferences, 
but they also had good reasons to 
doubt catastrophic flooding based 
on Bretz&apos;s original arguments. 
Moreover, Bretz&apos;s style of scien- 
tific inquiry virtually guaranteed 
that he would not triumph with his 
initial data. 

Bretz proceeded in the classic 
tradition of strict empiricism. He 
felt that adventurous hypotheses 
could only be established by long 
and patient collecting of informa- 
tion in the field. He eschewed 
theoretical discussion and worried 
little about the valid conceptual 
problem that so bothered his ad- 
versaries: Where could so much 
water come from so suddenly? 

Bretz tried to establish his hy- 
pothesis by toting up evidence of 
erosion in the field, piece by patient 
piece. He seemed singularly unin- 
terested in finding the missing item 
— a source for the water — that 
would render his story coherent. 
For this attempt might involve 
speculation without direct evidence, 
and Bretz relied only upon fact. 
When Gilluly challenged him on 
the absence of a source for the 
water, Bretz simply replied: &quot;I be- 
lieve that my interpretation of 
channeled scabland should stand or 
fall on the scabland phenomena 
themselves.&quot; 

But why should an opponent be 
converted by such an incomplete 
theory? Bretz believed that the 
southern end of the glacier had 
melted precipitously, and no sci- 
entist could imagine a way to melt 
ice so quickly. (Bretz tentatively 
suggested volcanic activity under 
the ice, but quickly abandoned the 
theory when Gilluly attacked.) 
Bretz stayed in the scablands, while 
the answer sat in western Montana. 
Glacial Lake Missoula had been 
in the literature since the 1880s, 
but Bretz did not make the con- 
nection — he was working in other 
ways. His opponents were right. 
We still do not know a way to melt 
so much ice so quickly. But the 
premise shared by all participants 
was wrong: the source of the water 
was water. 

Events that &quot;cannot happen&quot;&quot; 
according to received wisdom 
rarely gain respectability by a sim- 
ple accumulation of evidence for 
their occurrence; they require a 
mechanism to explain how they 
Clin happen. Early supporters of 
continental drift ran into the same 



difficulty that Bretz encountered. 
Their evidence of faunal and lith- 
ological similarities between con- 
tinents now widely separated 
strikes us today as overwhelming, 
but it failed in their time because 
no reasonable mechanism had been 
proposed for moving continents. 
The theory of plate tectonics has 
since provided a mechanism and 
established the idea of continental 
drift. 

Moreover, Bretz&apos;s opponents 
did not rest their case entirely on 
the unorthodox character of Bretz&apos;s 
hypothesis. They also marshaled 
some specific facts on their side, 
and they were partly right. Bretz 
originally insisted upon a single 
flood, while his opponents cited 
much evidence to show that the 
scablands had not formed all at 
once. We now know that Lake Mis- 
soula formed and re-formed several 
times as the glacial margin fluctu- 
ated. In his latest work, Bretz 
called for eight separate episodes of 
catastrophic flooding. Bretz&apos;s op- 
ponents were wrong in inferring 
gradual change from the evidence 
of temporal spread: catastrophic 
episodes can be separated by long 
periods of quiescence. But Bretz 
was also wrong in attributing the 
formation of the scablands to a 
single flood. 

I prefer heroes of flesh, blood, 
and fallibility, not of tinseled 
cardboard. Bretz is inscribed on my 
ledger because he stood against a 
firm, highly restrictive dogma that 
never had made any sense: the em- 
peror had been naked for a century. 
Charles Lyell, the godfather of 
geologic gradualism, had pulled a 
fast one in establishing the doctrine 
of imperceptible change (see my 
column of February 1975). He had 
argued, quite rightly, that geologists 
must invoke the invariance (uni- 
formity) of natural law through time 
in order to study the past scientifi- 
cally. He then applied the same 
term — uniformity — to an empirical 
claim about rates of processes, ar- 
guing that change must be slow, 
steady, and gradual, and that big 
results can only arise as the accumu- 
lation of small changes. 

But the uniformity of law does 
not preclude natural catastrophes, 
particularly on a local scale. Per- 
haps some invariant laws operate to 
produce infrequent episodes of sud- 
den, profound change. Bretz may 
not have cared for this brand of 



philosophical waffling. He probably 
would brand it as vacuous non- 
sense preached by an urban desk 
man. But he had the independence 
and gumption to live by a grand old 
slogan from Horace, often es- 
poused by science but not often 
followed: Niillliis addktus jurare 
in verba magistri, &quot;I am not bound 
over to swear allegiance to any 
master.&quot; 

My tale ends with two happy 
postscripts. First, Bretz&apos;s hypoth- 
esis that channeled scabland re- 
flects the action of catastrophic 
flooding has been fruitful far be- 
yond Bretz&apos;s local area. Scablands 
have been found in association 
with other western lakes, most 
notably Lake Bonneville, the large 
ancestor of a little puddle in com- 
parison — Great Salt Lake, Utah. 
Other applications have ranged 
about as far as they can go. Bretz 
has become the darhng of planetary 
geologists who find in the channel- 
ways of Mars a set of features best 
interpreted by Bretz&apos;s style of 
catastrophic flooding. 

Second, Bretz did not share the 
fate of Alfred Wegener, dead on 
the Greenland ice while his theory 
of continental drift lay in limbo, 
or of Schubert, buried in a pauper&apos;s 
grave so long before Fischer- 
Dieskau could sing his songs to an 
adoring world. J Harlen Bretz pre- 
sented his hypothesis sixty years 
ago, but he has lived to enjoy his 
vindication. He is now well into his 
nineties, feisty as ever and justly 
pleased with himself. In 1969, he 
published a forty-page paper sum- 
marizing a half century of con- 
troversy about the channeled scab- 
lands of eastern Washington. He 
closed with this statement: 

The International Association for 
Quaternary Research held its 1965 
meeting in the United States. Among 
the many field excursions it organized 
was one in the northern Rockies and 
the Columbia Plateau in Washington. 
. . . The party . . . traversed the full 
length of the Grand Coulee, part of the 
Quincy basin and much of the Palouse- 
Snake scabland divide, and the great 
flood gravel deposits in the Snake 
Canyon. The writer, unable to attend, 
received the next day a telegram of 
&quot;greetings and salutations&quot; which 
closed with the sentence, &quot;We are 
now all catastrophists.&quot;

ogy, geology, and the history of 
science at Harvard University. 



The new classic compact from Nikon. 

You can take as much pride in its breeding 

as in its performance. 



Every new Nikon has a reputation to live itp 
to. The reputation for superior, reliable 
performance that Nikon has earned as the 
camera used hy the overwhelming majority 
of today&apos;s top professionals . . . that has made 
Nikon a modern classic. 

This classic quality takes a new form in 
the compact Nikon FM. Smaller and lighter 
than any previous Nikon, it conveys the 
unmistakable feel of Nikon precision. You 
become c/uickly aware of its perfect balance 
in your hands and of its .swift, smooth 
responsiveness— qualities that make the FM 
a joy to handle. You can rely on the accuracy 
of its electronic exposure control system with 
its advanced, super-sensitive gallium photo 
diodes, which reduces correct e.xposure 
setting to near-foolproof simplicity. And, 
as you sight through the big, brilliant 
viewftnder, you feel the confidence that 
inspires Nikon users in their pursuit of 
photography at its finest. &apos;~ 



You will find your confidence fully borne 
out by the wide-ranging, yet ea.sy to use 
capabilities built into the Nikon FM and by 
the magnificent image quality of its Nikkor 
lens. And, these capabilities are easily 
expanded by the famous Nikon .system which 
puts more than fifty-five lenses and hundreds 
of accessories, including a nu&gt;tor drive, at 
your dispo.sal. 

The Nikon FM is one modern cla.ssic that 
is easy to afford. Let your Nikon dealer put 
one into your hands (you&apos;ll find him in the 
Yellow Pages). Ask him also about the 
traveling Nikon School. Or write for LitlPak

In Bell&apos;s &quot;Photophone,&quot; sunlight 
was bounced from a reflector througl 
a lens to a mechanism that vibrated ii 
response to speech. This caused the 
light beam to vary in intensity. At thi 
receiving end, a selenium detector 
translated these variations into 
electrical current to recreate speech 
through a telephone receiver.

77 years before we 
invented the laser, 
Professor Bell had a 
perfect application for it 



In 1880, only four years after 
he invented the telephone, 
Alexander Graham Bell received 
a patent for a remarkable idea — 
using light, rather than wire, 
to carry phone calls. 

Professor Bell built an experi- 
mental &quot;Photophone&quot; that 
transmitted his voice over a 
beam of sunlight. It didn&apos;t work 
very well, however. 

Sunbeams are scattered by 
air, rain and fog. In any event, 
the sun doesn&apos;t always shine. 
The Photophone, unfortunately, 
was an idea whose time had not 
yet come. 

A new kind of light 

By the 1950&apos;s, scientists again 
were looking for a way to use 
light for communications. 

In September, 1957, Charles 
Townes, a Bell Labs consultant, 
and Bell Labs scientist Arthur 
Schawlow conceived a way of 
producing a new kind of light — 
extremely intense, highly direc- 
tional, and capable of carrying 
immense amounts of information. 

Townes and Schawlow 
received a basic patent on their 



invention — the laser. 

Since then. Bell Labs scien- 
tists have invented hundreds 
of lasers, including many firsts — 
gas and solid-state lasers capable 
of continuous operation, high- 
power carbon dioxide lasers, 
liquid dye lasers that produce 
pulses shorter than a trillionth 
of a second, and tiny semi- 
conductor lasers that work 
reliably at normal temperatures. 
Some of these, no larger than 
grains of salt, may emit light 
continuously for 100 years. 

Getting the light to the 
end of the tunnel 

While we were developing 
lasers to generate light, we also 
looked for a way of shielding it 
and guiding it for long distances 
and around curves. 

Extremely transparent glass 
fibers, perfected at Bell Labs 
and elsewhere, provide the 
answer. These hair-thin fibers 
can carry light many miles 
without distortion or the need 
for amplification. 

In 1977, the Bell System took 
lightwave communications out 



of the laboratory and put it to 
work under the streets of dowm- 
town Chicago. The system, the 
first to carry phone calls, 
computer data, and video signals 
on pulses of light, is working 
successfully. 

Spin-off 

Laser light is now used in 
many other ways — to perform 
delicate eye surgery, detect air 
pollution, read product codes 
at supermarket checkouts, and 
do a variety of manufacturing 
tasks. Western Electric, the 
Bell System&apos;s manufacturing 
and supply unit, was the first 
company to put the laser to 
industrial use back in 1965. 
Hundreds of applications in 
many industries have followed. 

Sometimes, it takes a lot of 
work and a long time to make a 
bright idea — like Professor 
Bell&apos;s — a reality. Often, the 
things we invent, such as the 
laser, benefit not only Bell System 
customers, but society in general.

A Matter of Taste 



by Raymond Sokolov 



Behind the Tines 



The fork placed a barrier 
between fingers and food 

Fingers were made before forks, 
but so were knives and spoons. The 
fork as we know it — a small and 
manageable utensil for individual 
use, with four (or sometimes three) 
tines — did not appear anywhere in 
Europe, except as a curiosity, 
before the sixteenth century. And 
the history of its spread from Italy 
northward parallels fundamental 
changes in the history of Western 
manners and civilization that took 
place after the Reformation. 

This is a disrupting notion, as 
upsetting as the knowledge that 
Louis XIV ate with his hands until 
he was an old man. He was prob- 
ably the last French monarch to 
plunge his royal fingers into serving 
platters, but we have it on the 
authority of an eyewitness, Mme. 
de Montpensier, that he did so. And 
from all sorts of other evidence we 
know that Louis was in the main- 
stream (in fact the only stream) of 
European prandial history. 

The ancients certainly did not eat 
with forks. When Horace wrote, 
&quot;You can drive Nature away with a 
fork, but she will come right back,&quot; 
he meant something like a pitch- 
fork. The word &quot;fork&quot; comes from 
the Latin furca, a large, double- 
pronged affair big enough to give 
its name to an instrument of tor- 
ture, really a bifurcated yoke set 
over the victim&apos;s neck. His arms 
were lashed to the two tines. A 
furcifer, or fork-bearer, was a ras- 
cal, the sort of rogue who had car- 



ried or ought to carry afurca around 
because of his misbehavior. When 
the seventeenth-century British 
traveler Thomas Coryate returned 
home from Italy and ate with a 
silver fork, his friends, scandalized 
by such newfangled decadence, 
dubbed him &quot;furcifer.&quot; 

In Jacobean England, diners still 
preserved medieval manners. The 
most refined people felt no repug- 
nance at touching food. This may 
seem a small thing, but it stands 
for a very great difference in con- 
sciousness between prefork and 
postfork cultures. This is the thesis 
(at least, in part) of a recently trans- 
lated work in social history, Nor- 
bert Elias&apos;s The Civilizing Process: 
The History of Manners (Urizen, 
$15). Originally published (1939) in 
German in Switzerland, Elias&apos;s 
documentary study of the develop- 
ment of modern civilization shows 
how the idea of shame evolved and 
slowly changed every European&apos;s 
threshold of disgust in his relations 
with others. Elias quotes from a 
chronologically arranged series of 
texts on manners, which demon- 
strate the gradual growth of embar- 
rassment over such matters as sex, 
excretion, nose-blowing, and flatu- 
lence since the Middle Ages. Table 
manners are Elias&apos;s richest case in 
point. And the fork is at the center 
of his argument. 

&quot;People who ate together in the 
way customary in the Middle 
Ages,&quot; Elias writes, &quot;taking meat 
with their fingers from the same 
dish, wine from the same goblet, 
soup from the same pot or the same 



plate . . . such people stood in a 
different relationship to one another 
than we do.&quot; Normal conduct then 
would be, by today&apos;s standards, 
&quot;embarrassing or at least unattrac- 
tive&quot; because it allowed direct 
contact with &quot;something that had 
been in contact with the mouth or 
hands of someone else.&quot; 

No one can doubt that the mod- 
em Western bias against eating with 
the hands is a cultural artifact. In 
the Middle East, for instance, the 
normal way to bring food to the 
mouth is with the right hand (the 
left is considered unclean because 
it is in exclusive use as an adjunct 
to excretion). Innumerable other 
cultures do not employ special 
eating utensils. But, as Elias 
proves, the peculiar, fork- wielding 
refinement of the West is a histori- 
cal, as well as a cultural, phenom- 
enon. In a sixteenth-century book 
of etiquette, Erasmus observed: 
&quot;Some put their hands into the 
dishes when they are scarcely 
seated.&quot; His idea of good manners 
was to wait one&apos;s turn instead of 
lunging at the serving dish with the 
hands. Erasmus also counseled 
against hunting around in the serv- 
ing dish for the best piece. The 
refined person, he said, used only

them on one&apos;s coat. Such were the 
strictures of correct dining about

CUSTOMER INFORMATION FROM GENERAL MOTORS 



HOW WEIGHT AFFECTS GAS MILEAGE 

THE SAVINGS CAN BE DOUBLED IF WEIGHT IS REMOVED IN THE DESIGN STAGE. 



A designer can reduce the 
exterior dimensions of a car 
by a few inches and turn it 
into a major improvement in 
gas mileage. That&apos;s because 
smaller is usually lighter, and 
a lighter car doesn&apos;t need as 
much gasoline to go a given 
distance as a heavier one. 

It&apos;s really a process of 
multiplication, and it works 
like this: once the exterior 
dimensions are trimmed, the 
bumpers won&apos;t have to be 
quite as big, the frame won&apos;t 
have to be quite as long, and 
so on. This saves weight, and 
the savings begin to multiply. 
Wheels, axles, as well as 
other components, can often 
be smaller. 

We used the multiplier 
effect when we designed our 
current 1978 midsize cars. To 
illustrate how this works: if 
you were to take 100 pounds 
of golf clubs out of your 
trunk, you might, depending 
on the car, save about five 
gallons of gas in 10,000 miles. 



But if you take the same 100 
pounds out of a car in the 
design stage, you won&apos;t need 
as large an engine, transmis- 
sion, and other components 
to get good performance. So 
you can make components 
smaller and more than dou- 
ble the gas savings. That&apos;s 
what we try to do. 

In redesigning our cars to 
take advantage of this effect, 
we made extended use of 
lighter, highly durable mate- 
rials such as aluminum and 
plastic, adding up to an 
average weight-saving of 685 
pounds. As a rule of thumb, 
this could save on the 
average about 75 gallons of 
gas in an ordinary year of 
driving (10,000 miles). 

But weight isn&apos;t the only 
thing that affects mileage. 
Tire inflation pressures are 
important, so are lubricants. 
And an engine has to be 
properly maintained: one 
defective spark plug can 
knock down mileage by as 
much as ten percent. And 
remember, keep a light foot 
on the gas pedal; the way you 
drive may still be the most 
important thing of all. 

So far, in our new resized 
cars, we&apos;ve been able to 
reduce weight while still 
meeting all the safety stan- 
dards. In these new cars more 



corrosion-resistant materials 
are used. Routine mainte- 
nance schedules have been 
stretched out, and the need 
for certain kinds of mainte- 
nance has been eliminated 
entirely. We&apos;ve done this, in 
our opinion, with no sacrifice 
in passenger comfort or use- 
able space in the trunk. 

Most important is the 
simple fact that saving 
weight saves gasoline. 

Our goal is to build cars 
that are more and more effi- 
cient, to design them to meet 
our customers&apos; needs, and to 
sell them at prices the av- 
erage American can afford. 
That&apos;s the only way we can

ADDRESS- 



a treatise on manners stated that 
a child &quot;must not lift meat to his 
mouth now with one hand and now 
with the other, like Httle children 
who are learning to eat; he should 
always do so with his right hand, 
taking the bread or meat decently 
with three fingers only.&quot; 

By the end of the seventeenth 
century, a modern reticence creeps 
into this robust etiquette. Antoine 
de Courtin, in his Noiivcait Iraile de 
civilite. says that &quot;if everyone is 
eating from the same dish, you 
should take care not to put your 
hand into it before those of higher 
rank have done so.&quot; Courtin also 
suggests wiping the spoon before 
serving oneself, &quot;there being peo- 
ple so delicate that they would not 
wish to eat soup into which you had 
dipped it after putting it into your 
mouth.&quot; 

Clearly, the world was now ready 
for the fork and for the protection 
against contamination from human 
hands that it could provide. In a 
song written between 1640 and 
1680, the Marquis de Coulanges 
wrote: 

In times past, people ate from the 
common disti and dipped their bread 
and fingers in the sauce. 

Today everyone eats with spoon and 
fork from his own plate, and a 
valet washes the cutlery from time 
to time at the bufiFet. 

Even if the song celebrated an 
extreme instance of the new civil- 
ity, by 1729, an etiquette manual 
published in Rouen declares flatly 
that &quot;at table you should use a 
napkin, a plate, a knife, a spoon, 
and a fork. It would be entirely 
contrary to propriety to be without 
any of these things while eating.&quot; 

Fork etiquette developed rapidly 
in the eighteenth century. Today, 
we still eat in much the same way 
as our revolutionary ancestors. The 
only subsequent changes have been 
matters of detail: the uses of spe- 
cially shaped salad forks, oyster 
forks, fish forks, and even those 
throwbacks to the premodern, two- 
tined fork, fondue forks (see recipe 
below). 

Now it would be unthinkable to 
dispense with forks at any normal 
meal; one can imagine making do 
without a knife or a spoon, but a 
fork, never. 1 can remember, when 
I was eleven, how funny it seemed 
that another child my age ate his 
dinner only with a spoon. How

Innovation. Imitation. 



Olympus innovated the concept of the 
compact SLR, The introduction of the OM-1 startled 
the world of photography by putting so many 
big ideas into such a small iDody 

And after Olympus did the thinking, 
others did the following. 

Today the OM cameras still stand ahead 
of the pack with exclusive features. 

OM-1: The #1 Innovation. 

Enter the OM-1 . Suddenly the SLR 
camera is 33% smaller and lighter, yet incredibly 
rugged to meet the demands of professional wear 
and tear Miraculously the viewfinder is 70% 
brighter and 30% larger for faster, easier compos- 
ing and focusing. 

And suddenly the OM-1 became the 
#1 selling compact SLR. Its metering system is 
designed to give complete control to professionals 
and photojournalists. No distractions, blinking 
lights, or obscured images in the viewfinder 

A Quiet Innovation. 

Olympus created a unique shock 
absorber/air damper system to eliminate noise and 
vibration, for sharper unobtrusive photography 
Especially vital for long tele shots and macro/micro 
photos. 

The Motor Drive Innovation. 

OM-1 is still unsurpassed in its continuous- 
view motor drive capability: 5 pictures per 
second. And a rapid winder that fires as fast as 
3 shots a second! With no mirror &quot;lock-up,&quot; regard- 
less of lens used. 



The Biggest System Innovation. 

OM-1 is part of the world&apos;s most complete 
compact system. More than 280 components, 
all compact design, including 13 interchangeable 
screens so you can meet any photographic chal- 
lenge. Ingeniously designed to change in seconds 
through the lens mount. And more compact 
lenses than any other system, each a marvel of 
optical design and performance. 

The Automatic Innovation: The OM-2. 

It&apos;s the fully automatic OM, with major 
differences from all other automatics! The only 
SLR with &quot;off-the-film&quot; light measurement for 
those photographers demanding the ultimate 
innovation in automatic exposure control. Which 
means each frame is individually exposure- 
controlled even in motor drive or rapid winder 
sequences. And it makes possible the unique 
Olympus 310 Flash whose flash duration is con- 
trolled by the camera&apos;s metering system. 

And of course, the OM-2 shares every 
other innovation and system component with 
the OM-1. 

We Wrote The Book On Compacts. 

The OM System story is detailed in our 
full color in-depth brochure, yours free for writing

civilized. But how historically 
narrow of me. Perhaps, too, at that 
age, I was still close enough to hav- 
ng learned to hold and use a fork 
properly that I took a parvenu&apos;s 
pride in my own ability to hold one, 
not like a &quot;stick,&quot; but between the 
fingers. I have, however, always 
rebelled at the fussy American cus- 
tom of switching the fork from the 
left to the right hand after cutting. 
There is no logic to this chore- 
ography, and as a left-hander I am 
happy to claim the company of all 
Europe in my disdain for it. To her 
credit. Amy Vanderbilt also takes a 
permissive view of the matter. 

She is even willing to permit us to 
eat certain kinds of foods with our 
fingers, although reluctantly. Arti- 
choke leaves, in the Vanderbilt 
system, are to be pulled &quot;dexter- 
ously&quot; through the teeth. Bacon is 
finger food only if very crisp. Shoe- 
string potatoes, &quot;if really dry and 
impossible to eat with fork, may be 
eaten in the fingers.&quot; And so on. 
Vanderbilt&apos;s fussiness stems from 
the same historical impulse Elias 
traces to the sixteenth century. She 
wants, as much as possible, to put 
a flatware barrier between food and 
hands. The best reason for this 
delicacy has, to a great extent, dis- 
appeared with the universal adop- 
tion of serving implements. 

Still, there is a good modern 
reason for keeping our hands out 
of our food as much as possible. 
Cleanliness, for its own sake, is 
the only current justification for 
forks. Even this notion, however, 
goes back to the Renaissance, 
when, Elias notes, the very words 
for &quot;proper&quot; and &quot;improper&quot; in 
French (propre and impropre) came 
to mean &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;unclean.&quot; 

Nevertheless, the fork rule is 
relaxed in two eating situations that 
symbolize the conditions of life out- 
doors. We eat corn on the cob with 
our hands not only because it is 
simpler to do so, but also because 
it is preeminently a food of the 
fields, ideally consumed only min- 
utes after picking and before natural 
sugars evanesce. Small game birds 
also should be picked apart with 
the fingers both for practicality and 
because partridges and grouse, 
however elegant, remind us of the 
premodern and even preagricultural 
era when hunters gathered around 
a fire and ripped apart their quarry 
hot from the spit. Fried chicken is 
an intermediate case. This domes-

Where on earth 

will more gas energy 

come from? 



The land. The sea. The sun, 



America still has huge 
amounts of gas available from 
conventional underground 
sources. These include the vast 
new Alaskan gas fields, and gas 
recoverable with new deep 
drilling techniques. 

Energy experts say that 
when the next century arrives, 
we can still be getting as much 
gas out of the ground as we do 
right now. 

We not only can do it— we 
must. No other energy is now 
available in quantities large 
enough to do all the jobs that 
gas does. 



Some of the largest 
underground deposits lie deep 
beneath the ocean. Exploratory 
drilling has already begun on 
the Atlantic&apos;s outer continental 
shelf, an area that has been 
virtually untapped till now. 

Drilling under the ocean 
floor is difficult, but the tech- 
nologies have been developed 
and proven in the Gulf of 
Mexico. Twenty percent of our 
gas supply now comes from 
offshore, mainly the Gulf. 

Drilling platforms are also 
at work off the Pacific coast 
and in the Gulf of Alaska. 



Plant life has always cap- 
tured energy from the sun— now 
there may be a way to turn that 
energy into natural gas. The gas 
industry and the U.S. Department 
of Energy are working on test 
projects with fast-growing sea- 
weed, one of the most efficient 
solar converters known. 

Vast beds of this seaweed 
would be turned into gas by a pro- 
cess called biomass conversion. 
It&apos;s experimental now but in the 
21st century could make a real con 
tribution to energy supply. Wise 
energy use will 
help, too. ACiAA^i^&quot;o^^&apos;*

LCD Alarm 

Chronograph 

The accuracy of the Greenwich 
observatory...with greater spUt- 
second precision than the finest 
Swiss stopwatch...plus the 
convenience of a 24-hour personal 
alarm reminder system. 



This new LCD Chronograph is truly extraordinary. It 
does more, and does it better, than any other watch. 
With a strong, bold appearance that reflects this un- 
common ability. The only little things about it are its 
thickness and its selling price, which is a real break- 
through at $200.00 less than you&apos;d pay for the only 
other watch even close to its functions and uses. 
Quartz Crystal Time. . . It gives you accuracy to ± 60 
seconds a year. A year! Quartz Crystal accuracy that 
would have been considered sensational per month in 
early micro»electronic watches. Accuracy which is still 
not available in many digitals that sell for $500 or 
$1,000.00! 

Electronic Calendar... so, you always have exactly 
the right time on display — without pushing a button — 
in hours, minutes and running seconds. Then, at the 
touch of a button you can replace the seconds with the 
date or the day of the week, with the electronic calen- 
dar adjusting automatically for the number of days in 
any month. And you just light up the face to see 
perfectly when its dim or you re in the dark. 

24 Hour Alarm 

You can set this alarm for any minute of any hour of 
the day or night. In all, 1440 positions are possible. 

To wake you, remind you of an appointment, phone 
call or meeting (or to break one up that&apos;s been going 
on too long). The alarm will sound at the same time 
each day, unless you deactivate or change it. It will call 
you with an insistent, modulated beep, for a full minute 
unless you shut it off with a touch of the button sooner; 
and you can check to see if the alamn is set. 

Is it any wonder that of all the features available in 
digital watches, a wrist alarm like this is the one that&apos;s 
most wanted? Really it&apos;s important enough to warrant 
your buying a new watch. And remarkable as it may 
seem, with this offer from Douglas Dunhill, it&apos;s like 
getting the alarm free! 

Three Different Chronographs 

As to the chronograph, its precision is so fine, it 
borders on the infinitesimal. Splitting each second into 
a hundred parts! Actually you have three different 
chronographs, or stop action modes of measuring. So 
you can time any event in its entirety, slopping during 
pauses or breaks in the action. You can time an event, 
like a race, from beginning to end. getting the finishing 
time of each participant in the race, or interim times, 
for the quarter, say. while timing of the event con- 
tinues. 

And you can time portions of a continuing event, 
like each lap in a relay race or segment of a complex, 
continuing manufacturing operation. 

All this, with a few of the possible uses, is explained 
in detail below. Even from this brief description, 
though, the extraordinary sophistication of the mi- 
crocomputer chip of the LCD Alarm Chronograph is 
apparent. 

An Extraordinary Value 

Right now, probably the only watch with all these 
features, its incredible accuracy, multiple function 
chronograph and wrist alarm, is the Seiko. And it 
regularly sells for $200.00 more! $299.95, even 
though the Seiko Chronograph is accurate to only a 
tenth of a second. 



This extraordinary value is what convinced us, and 
we&apos;re one of the nation&apos;s oldest and largest mail mer- 
chandising firms, to secure the exclusive marketing 
rights. (After exhausting testing by our quality control 
experts.) We explained there was no way you would 
walk into a store and select a new brand from an 
unknown manufacturer. 

How could you possibly be expected to appreciate 
its quality? Would you be in any position to understand 
and evaluate its virtually unique 3-function chrono- 
graph? Would you believe a sales clerk who told you It 
was really a finer, more accurate fully electronic, solid 
state watch than many that sell for as much as 
$1,000,00? 

Wear it for 30 Days — 
Without Risk or Obligation 

With us, buying by mail, you not only get all the 
facts, enjoy significant savings made possible by

3 Way Chronograph 

The micro* electronic revolution has turned the 
chronograph from a bulky pocket watch or cumber- 
some wrist watch for specialists into a sleek, super 
sophisticated instrument that&apos;s become the preferred 
timepiece for doctors, pilots, motion picture photog- 
raphers, sound and efficiency engineers, skiers and 
sportsmen, and ever-increasing number of executives 
and others who enjoy split second accuracy and the 
ability to command time to stand still. 

No other instrument, at any price, gives you greater 
precision than the 1/IOOth of a second accuracy of the 
LCD Alarm Chronograph or greater flexibility In timing 
an event from a fraction of a second to one full hour. 
Add Time... is the stop watch mode you&apos;ll use for 
everything from timing a phone call to the length of a 
meeting; how long your car&apos;s been at a parking meter, 
the time you&apos;ve been njnning, jogging or exercising, 
even the time It takes for a quarterback to set up and 
throw. Then, because you can stop it when necessary 
and start counting again when the action begins 
again, you&apos;ll use it to prepare your speeches, time 
games or other events in which you want the actual 
accumulated times exclusive of any breaks In the 
action. 

SplitTime...ls the mode you&apos;ll use to get the time for 
the 1/4 and 1/2, 3/4 in a race, and the individual times 
of each contestant across the finish line. Think of it! 
Stopping for split times does not stop the timing of the 
event itself from continuing. It&apos;s actually stopped and 
running at the same time, so you can use It to figure 
out the time of pit stop, for example, and still get the 
over-all running time of the race. 
Lap Time ... is even more ingenious. It stops to mea- 
sure an event and simultaneously starts again from 
zero. In a relay race, for example, you stop the 
chronograph the instant the runner passes the baton; 
this gives you his time while the lap timer automatically 
starts counting the next runner&apos;s time. Similarly, in a 
football game, you can get the exact time it takes a 
punter to kick the ball, the time the balls in the air. and 
then the time of the njn back of the punt. Any event, 
from a rocket launch to a production process, can be 
split into its component parts this way. Separating the 
time of elements that cannot be separated In any other 
way! 

Within minutes you&apos;ll be able to use each of these 
modes of operation perfectly. Within days, find innu- 
merable uses in both business and your personal life.

ticated megapartridge is more ac- 
cessible if you pick it up and gnaw 
— and if it is properly fried, it is 
fairly clean to eat. 

Finally, I want to mention a 
related problem in dining etiquette, 
overlooked by Elias and perhaps 
too leniently dealt with by Vander- 
bilt: cherries. Vanderbilt, like any 
sensible person, allows us to pop 
cherries into our mouths whole, 
with the fingers. The trouble comes 
later. Can it possibly be polite to 
spit the pits into the cupped hand 
and put them back on the plate? 
Vanderbilt says so, but who has not 
felt embarrassed at ejecting some- 
thing from the mouth at the dinner 
table? What could be more medie- 
val and unattractive? The solution 
to this predicament was reportedly 
arrived at not long ago by a can- 
didate for a fellowship at Oxford&apos;s 
prestigious All Souls College who, 
at a formal dinner that was the final 
hurdle before his appointment, 
looked about him furtively, his 
mouth full of cherry stones, know- 
ing that the assembled dons were 
coldly watching him squirm on the 
horns of the dilemma they had 
maliciously contrived, and, with 
Erasmian aplomb, swallowed the 
pits. He was elected to All Souls 
and lived to enjoy his sinecure. 

Compared to that feat, the ques- 
tion of which fork to use for which 
dish is child&apos;s play. Simply work 
from the outside in. Silverware set 
above the plate is for dessert. When 
in doubt, watch your hostess or 
some other figure of propriety. But, 
above all, never ask. An excessive 
concern with forks is a mark of the 
provincial, as well as a sign of 
puerile interest in the decadent 
phase of an antique shift in man- 
ners. The best rule is: Get fed, 
stay as clean as you can, and at- 
tract no attention. 

Nika Hazelton&apos;s 
Basic Cheese Fondue 

(Slightly adapted from Mrs. 
Hazelton&apos;s The Swiss Cookbook) 

1 pound imported Swiss cheese, or 
half Emmentaler and half 
Gruyere, shredded or diced, or 
the equivalent in slices, finely 
cut 

3 tablespoons flour, or I&apos;/i table- 
spoons cornstarch 

1 garlic clove 

2 cups dry white wine 

I tablespoon lemon juice 



3 tablespoons kirsch (or brandy, 

gin, or whisky) 

Nutmeg, pepper, or paprika to 

taste 
2 loaves Italian or French bread, 

cut in cubes so that there is crust 

on one side of each cube 

1. Dredge the cheese lightly with 
the flour or cornstarch. 

2. Rub the fondue pot with garlic. 

3. Pour in the wine and set over 
moderate heat. 

4. When air bubbles rise to the 
surface, add lemon juice. Then 
add the cheese by handfuls, stir- 
ring constantly, in figure eights, 
with a wooden fork or spoon until 
the cheese is melting. 

5. Add the kirsch and spices, stir- 
ring until blended. 

6. Set over a low flame at the table. 

7. Spear the bread cubes with long- 
handled, two-tined forks, push- 
ing the tines through the soft 
side and into the crust, to anchor 
them. Dunk and swirl in the 
fondue. 

Yield: Four servings 

Note: The fondue must be kept 
barely bubbling at the table. Regu- 
late the flame accordingly. As the 
fondue is consumed, you may have 
to turn the flame, off and on to 
achieve a low enough heat. If the 
fondue should become lumpy or 
separate, put it back on the stove, 
stir it thoroughly with a wire whisk 
and add V2 teaspoon cornstarch 
diluted in a little wine. Immature 
cheese tends to form threads. If 
the fondue becomes too thick be- 
cause of the continuous cooking 
and evaporation of the liquid, it can 
be thinned by adding some warmed 
wine. If the mass does not amal- 
gamate, add V2 teaspoon diluted 
cornstarch. 

In Switzerland, in a restaurant, 
whoever drops the first bread cube 
into the pot pays for the meal. In 
private homes, this is perhaps the 
appropriate moment to contemplate 
the mechanical superiority of four- 
tined over two-tined forks. Hazel- 
ton asserts that, in a pinch, metal 
skewers or even knitting needles 
can be substituted for fondue forks. 
Crede expertae, but if you try these 
desperate measures, watch out for 
falling bread.

THE SIERRA CLUB PROUDLY PRESENTS ITS FIRST PORCELAIN PLATE COLLECTION . . . 

ctiowers ofthe^Ajnencanwilaermss 

Twelve collector&apos;s plates by the world-famous artist Jeanne Holgate. 
Crafted of fine porcelain and individually bordered in pure 24 karat gold. 




Plate shown smaller than actual 7^/*&quot; size. 



This is the first collection of its 
kind ever issued by the Sierra Club, 

and it is available in exceptionally 

limited edition— by subscription only. 

The subscription deadline is 

August 31, 1978. 



The flowers of the American wilderness are 
among the most beautiful of our natural 
treasures. Delicate, graceful and vibrant, 
they have the power to stir the heart as 
well as the senses. Yet so elusive is their 
beauty that it is a rare artist indeed who can 
capture it with accuracy and realism. 

But now, the Sierra Club, America&apos;s fore- 
most conservation organization, has com- 
missioned one of the most gifted artists of 
our time— Jeanne Holgate— to do exactly that. 
In its very first collection of porcelain plates. 

An acclaimed artist whose style combines 
uncompromising accuracy with a mastery of 
form and color, Jeanne Holgate works di- 
rectly from the living flower. Thus, she is 
able to depict each wildflower exactly as it 
is in nature. So completely true to life that 
the tiny creatures she so joyfully portrays 
approaching her flowers are never a surprise 
to the viewer. For this is where the bum- 
blebee and the grasshopper truly belong. 

The result is a collection of beautiful 
works on porcelain— so lifelike that each is 
aglow with the inner beauty of the flowers 
themselves. A collection that will bring the 
beauty of our country&apos;s wildflowers into the 
home, where it can be enjoyed— year after 
year— by every member of the family. 

The delicate size enhances 
each original design 

There will be twelve porcelain plates in this 
historic Sierra Club collection. Each will 
measure 7%&quot; in diameter, a size chosen 
especially to enhance the delicate beauty of 
its subject. And every design will delight the 
eye with its clear and uncomplicated beauty. 
Each of the twelve plate designs will por- 
tray the loveliest wildflowers of a different 
region of our country, from the enchanting 
Lady&apos;s Slipper Orchid of the New England 
woods to the California Poppy that grows in 
profusion along Pacific shores . . . and from 
the charming forget-me-not that brightens 
the Alaskan plains to the graceful Water 
Lily, glory of the Florida Everglades. 





Thus, together, the complete collection 
will portray America&apos;s most distinctive and 
beautiful wildflowers— in a form destined to 
remain forever fresh and fascinating. 

Crafted of the finest porcelain 

Each plate in the Sierra Club collection will 
be individually crafted of fine Bavarian por- 
celain, prized throughout the world for its 
whiteness, its translucence and its enduring 
strength. And every plate in the collection 
will be individually decorated with a rich 
border of pure 24 karat gold. 

The Sierra Club has appointed Franklin 
Porcelain, a division of The Franklin Mint, 
as the sole issuing authority for this, its first 
collection of porcelain plates. And only those 
plates which meet the most demanding qual- 
ity standards will be accepted for issuance. 

Limiting the edition of fine porcelain plates 

By order of the Sierra Club, Flowers of the 
American Wilderness will be produced and 
issued only by direct subscription. The total 
number of plates to be issued will be sharply 
and permanently restricted in the manner 
long ago established to assure the rarity of 
the finest porcelain plates. Thus, there is an 
absolute limit of just one subscription per 
person, and the total edition of the collection 
will be forever limited to the exact number of 
subscriptions entered by the official deadline. 

As a subscriber, you will receive your 
plates at the convenient and systematic rate 
of one each month for a year. The issue price 



for each fine porcelain plate is just $39, and 
a display stand will accompany each plate. 

A legacy of beauty 

As fine porcelain to display in your home 
... as a collection of original works by a 
world-renowned floral artist . . . and as the 
first collection of porcelain plates ever issued 
by the Sierra Club, this will be a most re- 
warding acquisition. 

And, because a truly worthwhile posses- 
sion retains its appeal forever, this collection 
will also be far, far more. A legacy from 
you, to be passed along from parent to child, 
down the generations. A legacy that will- 
again and again— inspire a love of beauty and 
an appreciation of America&apos;s proud natural 
heritage in all who come to possess it. 

But please keep in mind that the Sierra 
Club&apos;s Flowers of the American Wilderness 
plate collection is available for only a limited 
time. To subscribe, complete the application 
below and mail it by August 31, 1978. 

There is no need to send any payment 
now. But please be sure your Subscription 
Application is postmarked no later than 
August 31st. 

JEANNE HOLGATE&apos;s work is a permanent 
part of the great floral art collections of the 
world— including those of the Carnegie-Mel- 
lon University&apos;s Hunt Botanical Library, the 
British Museum, and the personal collection 
of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen 
Mother of Great Britain. She is the only 
artist ever awarded successive gold medals 
by the Royal Horticultural Society.

Notes From a 
Rice Paddy 



If the climate is right, even an 
amateur farmer can grow 
enough of this life-sustaining 
commodity to feed a family 

Rice is the main food for half the 
world&apos;s population. There are thou- 
sands of varieties of rice. All are 
crops of warm climates and only a 
few new types produce well where 
the mean temperature is 70°F (or 
higher) for less than four months of 
the year. 

In the United States, rice culture 
began in South Carolina in 1694, but 
almost all of our rice is now grown in 
limited regions of Arkansas, 
California, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
and Texas. The nutritive value of 
milled rice is about that of potatoes, 
but in the rough, or unhulled, form 
at everyday temperatures, rice can 
keep for several years — much 
longer than raw potatoes. 

Yields around the world vary 
widely, from only 1,000 pounds per 
acre on unfertilized plots dependent 
on fluctuating rainfall to more than 
6,000 pounds per acre where plant 
variety is matched to optimum con- 
ditions of soil, water, and tempera- 
ture. United States production in 
1976 was nearly 13 billion pounds 
from 2.8 million acres, for an aver- 
age yield of 4,600 pounds per acre. 
More than half of our production is 
exported — major customers include 
South Korea, South Africa, the 
Arab countries of the Mideast, and 
some western European nations. 

In the United States, commercial 
production is energy intensive and 
usually employs chemical aids. Rice 
seed is either sown by airplane in 
flooded fields or planted with grain 
drills in fields drained for planting 
and subsequently flooded. Weed- 
control herbicides such as 2,4-D 
are commonly applied by airplane. 



Fields are drained again before 
harvest and allowed to dry suffi- 
ciently for combines to be used. 
Rice is hulled in centrally located 
mills — the largest process as much 
as a billion pounds in a year. Milling 
nowadays is often preceded by spe- 
cial processing, which first places 
rough rice under vacuum to remove 
air from the hull and kernel; then 
steams it under high pressure. This 
practice, akin to parboiling, drives 
some vitamins and minerals from 
the rice hull into the kernel, 
thereby producing a more nutri- 
tious, longer-lasting final product. 
Milled rice is often further enriched 
with vitamins and minerals before 
being packaged for distribution to 
markets. 

Civilizations tend to be only as 
strong and enduring as their agricul- 
tural bases — it is accordingly an 
understatement to say that we 
should be concerned with what is 
going on in U.S. agriculture. Com- 
mercial rice culture in the United 
States illustrates many features of 
our total agricultural system. It in- 
volves extensive use of fossil fuels 
to power machinery, to fertilize, 
and to control insect and plant 
pests. Most of us are better fed than 
former populations. But our tech- 
nological agriculture has also intro- 
duced harmful synthetics into the 
environment and replaced crop 
rotation with chemicals, resulting 
in the loss of humus and increased 
erosion of sloping lands. 

Our systems for the preservation 
and widespread distribution of agri- 
cultural products have given us 
year-round access to many hereto- 
fore seasonal foods, but some of us 
miss the flavor of fresh, naturally 
ripened produce, which is seldom 
available nowadays.

How small should 
a compact be? 



At 11 ounces and 3 inches high, 
Custom Compact binoculars by 
Bushnell give you more resolution and 
light gathering per ounce than other 
compacts at any 
price! Resolution is 
that critical capability 
of defining the sharp 
detail you require for 
bird identification, 
and light gathering 
determines your 
ability to see that 
detail clearly under 
varying light 
conditions. 

Used by the astro- 
nauts in space flights, 
Bushnell&apos;s Custom Compacts achieve 
this high ratio of performance-to-weight 
and size through an electronically 
computed, camera quality optical 




system combined with precision 
tolerances and rugged construction. 
They are available in 6x25 or 7x26, and 
feature close focus down to 12 feet, 

long eye relief for full 
field with eyeglasses, 
and U.V. filters for 
glare control. 

At 11 ounces and 
3 inches high, 
Custom Compact 
binoculars by 
Bushnell are not the 
smallest compacts 
available. But we feel 
they&apos;re precisely as 
small as a compact 
binocular should be.

Bushnell Give us a look 



Our energy-intensive farming has 
been associated with social changes 
— there are fewer farmhands in the 
nation now and more unemployed 
workers in the cities. Since our 
agricultural methods rest signifi- 
cantly on the depletion of nonre- 
newable resources, they resemble 
some other features of our socio- 
economic structure in that they 
probably cannot be sustained over 
the long term. 

My maternal grandfather was a 
farmer and rancher in south Texas, 
so I was exposed to commercial 
agriculture as a youngster during 
the early 1940s. After ten years of 
adult life in Norman, Oklahoma 
(population about 60,000), and with 
our two sons out of high school, my 
wife, Lottie, and I agreed that we 
should try living on a farm. 

Our 220-acre farm is mostly pas- 
ture. The original part of our house 
was built by a family of Choctaw 
Indian descent, which claimed 80 
acres when the Indian lands in 
Oklahoma were allocated to indi- 
viduals at the start of this century. 
I use a lot of old, but still functional, 
farm equipment that is not in great 
demand by full-time farmers. Most 
of it was purchased for about 15 per- 
cent of the cost of new equipment. 
Our farm income, which is derived 
principally from honey sold to 
health food stores, amounts to less 
than $1,000 per year. My agricul- 
tural experiments consequently de- 
pend for their support on my in- 
come as a meteorologist. 

We have some cows and calves, 
chickens and ducks, a productive 
apiary, a fine garden, a developing 
orchard, and a lovely creek. Some 
of the numerous wild animals share 
our produce, but they, in turn, 
are kept in check or at bay by our 
dogs and cats and by various ad hoc 
strategies. There is plenty of work, 
but we get some important help 
from a friendly neighbor. We take 
much pleasure in our animals and 
get much satisfaction from farm life. 
And we are learning. 

For example, after three seasons 
of experimentation, I have devel- 
oped a system of rice cultivation 
that produces a good yield with very 
little labor and no commercial fertil- 
izers, pesticides, or herbicides. My 
paddy is a 734-square-foot oblong 
plot in which water normally stands 
after heavy rains, making it unsuit- 
able for common garden crops. The 
topsoil is a dark loam, underlain by

How to tell original 
prints from cheap reproductions. 



Buying original prints is an excellent way for the novice 
to make a modest investment in beautiful works of art. 
The buyer had better beware, however. . 
As more and more attention is being given to art as an 
investment, more and more dealers are trying to pass off 
cheap reproductions as fine art. 

At the Original 
Print Collectors 
Group, we sell only 
fine original works to 
a growing number of 
people whoare enthu- 
siastic about buying 
good art at moderate 
prices. 

One of our pri- 
mary concerns is to 
educate our cus- 
tomers, so that they&apos;ll 
be able to discrim- 
inate and get true 
value for their money. 
A few pointers, then 
about original prints: 
Original prints, whatever the process used to create them, 
are &quot;hand-pulled&quot; under the artist&apos;s supervision, or by the artist 
himself. This means that any work produced photographically 
or by another purely mechanical process is not an original 
print. 

If you examine a print under a magnifying glass and dis- 
cover a regular pattern of small dots, you will know immedi- 
ately that it is not an

original work. 

If the print is a seri- 

graph (produced by a 

silkscreen process), the 

ink will seem rather like 

paint and appear to be 

sitting upon (rather 

than absorbed into) the 

paper. 

Etchings and en- 
gravings will produce 

a physical impression on 

the paper itself. 

Contemporary origi- 
nal prints will always be 

signed in pencil by the 

artist himself, to indicate 

personal supervision 

and approval of the 

individual print. 

Original prints are always produced in limited editions, 

at the most several hundred copies. If thousands of copies are 

available, then the 
work is almost cer- 
tainly not original. (In 
most cases, to assure 
that the integrity of 
their work is not vio- 
lated, artists will 
destroy the plate after 
the edition has been 
produced.) 

The print will 
have a figure on its 
border, indicating the 
number of prints pulled and the number of the individual print 
in the sequence. 

For example, the figure 50/100 means that the edition 
has been limited to 100, and that this is the 50th print pulled. 




Louis Toffoli&apos;.s original lithograph 
Femmes a la Potiche. Signed limited 
edition of 125. 




Peter Max&apos;s original lithograph Man With Umbrella. 
Signed limited edition of 300. 

Is the edition limited and is the print numbered? 
Did the artist personally sign the individual work? 



There&apos;s a lot more to be learned about buying original 
prints, more than we can tell you on this page. 

But if you&apos;ll send for our free color brochure, we&apos;ll be 
happy to tell you more, and show you the quality and variety 
of the prints we offer. 

They include limited edition etchings, serigraphs and 
lithographs by both contemporary and traditional artists 
with international reputations. Some examples: Calder, 
Chagall, Dali, Delacroix, Picasso and Renoir. 

If you decide to buy a print, we&apos;ll frame it handsomely 
and send it to you with a full money back guarantee. If 
you&apos;re not satisfied for any reason, you simply return your

a slightly pervious clay. An irriga- 
tion system provides water from 
Finn Creek, made perennial by an 
upstream water-retention and flood- 
control project built in 1965 by the 
Soil Conservation Service. 

In late winter or early spring I 
spread about 200 pounds of old cow 
manure on the paddy and plow it 
into the soil with the residue from 
the previous rice crop. For uniform 
distribution of water to the new 
crop, I level the paddy with a rake, 
boards, and a level indicator. Plant- 
ing sprouts instead of ungerminated 
seed gives the rice a start over un- 
germinated weed seeds. So I place 
wet rough rice from the previous 
crop in a covered can on top of a 
hot-water heater. The seed sprouts 
very rapidly and is ready to plant in 
a few days. About two pounds of 
seed corresponds to the usual plant- 
ing rate of a little more than one 
hundred pounds per acre. I use a 
Rototiller just before planting; this 
eliminates started weeds and pro- 
vides an appropriate seedbed. The 
slightly sprouted rice is broadcast 
carefully by hand, raked gently to 
hide it from birds, and then watered 
to provide a shallow cover. Planting 
time in central Oklahoma is from 
May 1 to May 10. 

I have heard that the planting of 
germinated seed is practiced in the 
Philippines, but the traditional 
Oriental method of rice growing in- 
volves cultivating the seedlings in 
separate beds and then transplant- 
ing them. With the transplanting 
method, two or sometimes three 
crops a year can be grown in the 
same rice paddy if the climate is 
suitably warm. Transplanting estab- 
lished plants gives the rice a strong 
advantage over weeds, which then 
grow only poorly in the shade of 
the larger rice plants. The airplane 
method of seeding is very fast, of 
course, but probably not adapted to 
the use of tender sprouted seed. In 
most commercial practice, the rapid 
natural ascendancy of sprouted or 
transplanted rice over weeds, 
coupled with some manual labor for 
residual weed control, is traded for 
weed control by chemical methods. 
The planting of germinated seed is 
probably a good method for small- 
scale farming in the United States, 
since in most of the country the 
warm season is not long enough for 
two rice crops and weeds can be 
particularly troublesome when 
the germination of unsprouted rice

seed is delayed by cool weather. 
Rice is a beautiful plant and 
grows rapidly during Oklahoma&apos;s 
typically hot July and August. In 
1977, my paddy required only one 
major weeding, which 1 did in about 
two hours with feet kept bare so 
the rice plants could be felt and not 
trampled. A major weed is barnyard 
grass, which resembles rice until 
the seed stalks appear, but which 
is a slightly darker green, has a 
diminutive or absent ligule, instead 
of the conspicuous pubescent ligule 
of rice, and stems that are reddish 
at the base, while those of rice are 
nearly white. A broad-leaved aquatic 
weed with shallow roots is also 
common in my paddy, but it is 
easily pulled up and eaten by our 
ducks. During midsummer, the 
water surface shows tints of blue, 
indicative of nitrogen-fixing blue- 
green algae. The paddy is not a sig- 
nificant source of mosquitoes, 
which are apparently controlled by 
the numerous frogs attracted during 
the summer growing season. 

I harvest the rice when the kernels 
show the first signs of falling from 
their panicles, about September 20 
in Oklahoma. My harvest date has 
been insensitive to the planting 
date, depending instead on the 
variety of rice used. Birds are not 
a serious pest unless the rice stalks 
are blown down, or lodged, by a 
severe storm; the stalk is not stiff 
enough to give even small birds a 
good perch. I harvest the rice by 
hand in about an hour by succes- 
sively gathering together all the 
stalks I can embrace and cutting 
them oflT with a knife. After the 
harvested stalks have dried for a 
few weeks in a large wooden tray 
in the barn, I remove more than 
95 percent of the grain in about 
fifteen minutes by striking the mass 
of stalks with the flat of an ordinary 
pitchfork. The grain falls to the bot- 
tom of the tray, and the stalks with 
unthreshed grain are worked overby 
eager chickens. 

The unpalatable rice hulls cling 
closely and tenaciously to the ker- 
nels. Hulling consequently repre- 
sents a major obstacle for the small 
rice grower. The Oriental pounding 
and rubbing methods involving a 
hollowed-out log seem ill-adapted to 
our ways, although not having guid- 
ance in such arts, I have probably 
not given them a fair trial. Another 
technique, small, electrically pow- 
ered rice hullers used for test- 



44 



ing grain sampled from commercial 
lots, seems expensive for the small 
farmer (huller prices started at 
about $600 in 1976). In my first hull- 
ing method I used a tray lined with 
carborundum paper and rubbed the 
rice with a similarly coated wooden 
block, but this procedure is pain- 
fully slow and produces some un- 
desirable grit. 

In 1976 I purchased, for $143 
delivered, a Java hand-operated 
huller manufactured in England. 
This small, sturdy machine, which 
should last for decades, yields five 
to ten pounds of milled rice per hour 
in an easygoing operation by one 
person, including simple winnowing 
of the outturn mixture of kernels 
and separated hulls. The final prod- 
uct — brown rice, since only the 
outer husk is removed from most 
kernels — cooks in twenty minutes. 
The amount to be eaten in a month 
is all that should be milled at one 
time because brown rice is vulner- 
able to attack by insects and its oil 
can become rancid (of course, these 
risks are minor if the rice is refrig- 
erated). 

My paddy, although poorly 
leveled in 1977 owing to an error. 



provided 55 pounds of rough rice 
after threshing, which corresponds 
to a yield of about 3,200 pounds 
per acre. Approximately two-thirds 
of my total came from the half 
paddy that was better watered, so 

I anticipate a yield of 70 to 75 
pounds with better leveling. But 
even 55 pounds is more than ade- 
quate for a family of four, since the 
annual per capita consumption in 
the United States is only IV2 pounds 
of milled rice, derived from about 

I I pounds of rough rice. 

Some additional notes. My rice is 
Nova 66. I judge that given suitable 
land and sufficient water of good 
quality, the manual method of plant- 
ing rice sprouts is practical for a 
small farm family cultivating up to an 
acre of paddy. This carries implica- 
tions of a significant financial return 
on labor, since the current retail 
price of rice in health food stores is 
more than 500 per pound. 

If an acre is planted, a small com- 
bine would be an appropriate aid, 
and the Java huller would need a 
simple conversion to belt drive to 
mill about thirty pounds of rice per 
hour. Deep water is not necessary 
on rice plants, although depths of 



six inches provide strong control of 
weeds. But a minimum water depth 
of an inch or two is required to keep 
the paddy continuously wet until 
the rice kernels are well filled out. 
I watered for forty minutes every 
second or third day during the hot, 
dry summer of 1977 and estimate 
that less than $1.50 was spent on 
electricity for my one-horsepower 
pump throughout the season. 

Overfertilizing will result in lush 
vegetative growth and lodging of 
the stalks. I now apply cow manure 
once before planting and leave the 
rest to the algae. The U.S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture and other agen- 
cies provide instructions for achiev- 
ing maximum yields by fertilizing 
during midseason. The benefits of 
commercial processing can be ap- 
proached by parboiling rough rice 
and redrying before hulling. This 
practice is common in many of the 
less-developed countries where rice 
is grown in small plots for local use.

Ironies of the Great Lakes 





The Great Lakes of North America are ironical nat- 
ural phenomena, often described in metaphor or in 
wonder. Herman Melville chose metaphor when, in 
Moby Dick, his Ishmael portrays the lakes to an in- 
credulous Spaniard: &quot;Those grand fresh-water seas 
of ours,&quot; Ishmael brags with Jacksonian pride, &quot;pos- 
sess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of the 
ocean&apos;s noblest traits. . . .&quot; The wandering sailor 
is unable to describe these strangely misplaced seas 
without identifying their &quot;wild barbarians,&quot; &quot;ancient 
and unending forests,&quot; and &quot;Borean and dismasting 
blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave&quot; — 
qualities more closely associated with Cape Horn than 
with inland lakes. 

Ecologist Eugene F. Stoermer, an author in this 
issue who has studied the Great Lakes for many years, 
turns to wonder. He first saw Lake Michigan when he 
was six. &quot;It looked very impressive and mysterious 
then to a farm boy from Iowa,&quot; he says, &quot;and, in some 
respects, is even more so today.&quot; 

The irony, the mystery, and the metaphor are in- 
spired by the truth that, despite their size and power, 
the Great Lakes are filled with fresh water. Once so 
lacking in chemicals that it was as pure as rain, lake 
water remains remarkably clean and continues to de- 
fine aquatic life in special ways: layering and unlayer- 
ing itself in a seasonal cycle; encouraging only certain 
plant and animal life; responding sometimes like and 
sometimes unlike salt water to such natural forces as 
the earth&apos;s rotation and temperature changes. 

A second irony about the Great Lakes is that soon 
after the European discovered ways to exploit them, he 
unknowingly began to accelerate the water&apos;s slow, 
natural aging. The lakes were all things to all people — 
wells, cooling agents, platforms for transportation 
and recreation, sources of food, dumps for waste. 
Only recently have scientists been able and encour- 
aged to discover the complex ways in which rapid 
aging has degraded the once-pure, apparently infinite 
resource. This special issue is a research report on 
the unfolding natural history of the Great Lakes. 

For more than a generation, the alarm &quot;the lakes are 
dying&quot; has rung through popular discussions of the 
status of the Great Lakes. The authors in this issue, 
however, share a deep respect for the continuing good 
health of the lakes, as well as a cautious optimism 
about the future. CliflFord H. Mortimer (like Ishmael, 
a user of metaphors) writes: &quot;The play has changed 
and some actors have left, but there has been an en- 
couraging resilience in the show&apos;s response to various 
threats to its continuance.&quot;

Props and Actors on a Massive Stage 

A number of chemical, physical, and biological processes 
keep the Great Lakes&apos; annual &quot;play&quot; in production 

by Clifford H. Mortimer 



In the Great Lakes, the life cycles of individual or- 
ganisms provide a number of fascinating, although 
brief, scenarios. But together, all the agents of change 
among the plants, birds, and fish become a full-length 
play on the massive stage of the Great Lakes basin. 

Several important props must be described before 
we get to the play&apos;s narrative. One is the relative shal- 
lowness of the lakes, scraped out some 10,000 to 
15,000 years ago by receding ice sheets. Another is the 
size of these inland seas, so enormous that the earth&apos;s 
rotation plays, through the Coriolis force, a major role 
in the dynamics of the Great Lakes, as it does in the 
oceans. And because the lakes all outflow either into 
each other or into the Saint Lawrence River and differ 
in surface size and in volume, they all have different 
water residence times. 

The geology of the lakes affects both their water 
quality and the principal land uses in their catchments. 
Land uses are primarily determined by bedrock and 
the related soil, both of which show strong north- 
south contrasts in the lake basin. In the north, the Lake 
Superior catchment and much of the Lake Huron 
catchment lie on igneous rocks of the Canadian Pre- 
cambrian Shield. The rocks of these &quot;upper&quot; lakes 
weather slowly, adding few nutrients to nurture either 
land or aquatic plant life. In the south, most of the 
drainage into Lake Michigan and the &quot;lower&quot; lakes — 
Erie and Ontario — comes from glacial drift deposits 
that cover sedimentary rocks. These yield a rich nutri- 
ent soup. With relative ease, early settlers cultivated 
the soils around Lakes Michigan, Erie, and Ontario, in 
contrast to the difficulty of farming the thin, infertile 
soils of the north. Human settlement and land use 
responded to the north-south diflFerences. More people 
settled in the south, further increasing the amount of 
nutrients — to poisonous levels — in the lower lakes. 

The water in each lake reflects the diflFerences in 
these geologic and land-use characteristics, as com- 
parisons between Lake Ontario and Lake Superior 
point up. The salt content of Lake Ontario&apos;s oflFshore 
waters is 170 parts per million; that of Lake Superior&apos;s 
is 35 parts per million. Sufficient light is available for 
photosynthesis to a depth of 55 feet in Lake Ontario&apos;s 
oflFshore waters; to a depth of 125 feet in Lake Supe- 
rior&apos;s oflFshore waters. Measurements of salt content 
and transparency for Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Erie 
fall between those of Superior and Ontario. Lake Hu- 
ron&apos;s Saginaw Bay — one of the most polluted areas in 
the lakes — has a salt content of 240 parts per million 
and a transparency of only 20 feet. The concentrations 
of two important nutrient salts, phosphate and nitrate, 
show even more striking diflFerences. 



In order to grow, the plant life of the lakes requires 
energy from light, as well as nutrients. The turbidity 
and color of the water, which vary greatly with the 
season and location, determine penetration of sunlight 
into the lakes. In general, the lakes with the least nutri- 
ents have the greatest transparency. 

With those props — the geochemical characteristics 
of the Great Lakes basin — the curtain can go up on the 
seasonal cycle in winter. Except in shallow Lake Erie, 
which may freeze over, wind and wave action combine 
to break up temporarily formed ice sheets on the oflF- 
shore waters of the lakes. Well stirred by the wind, 
the waters cool down to several degrees below the 
40°F temperature of maximum density. Friction along 
the shoreline imposes resistance to stirring, but due to 
the large size of the lakes, the bottoms offer little re- 
sistance. As the water slowly warms up in the early 
spring, however, layering of waters by temperature — 
called thermal stratification — develops and terminates 
the mixing. 

Thermal stratification begins when the water near 
shore warms up first and, as it reaches 40°, becomes 
denser than the colder, well-mixed oflFshore waters, 
whose temperature is typically 36°. As the nearshore 
water heats up, it divides into layers, with the densest 
40° water at the bottom and with stratifications of 
warmer, hence less dense, water resting on top of each 
other. The nearshore and the oflFshore water masses 
become separated from each other by a narrow, nearly 
vertical curtain of water, called the &quot;thermal bar.&quot; 
As the oflFshore waters gradually heat up in spring, the 
thermal bar migrates out into the lake. 

We used to think that the thermal bar remained 
stable vertically as it advanced oflFshore because it 
drew warmer and colder water into it from both sides. 
But, exposed as the Great Lakes are to wind action, 
this seems unlikely. We now know that the stabilizing 
factor is the Coriolis force arising from the earth&apos;s rota- 
tion. In the Northern Hemisphere, this force always 
directs a current ninety degrees to the right of its initial 
flow. Here, this force tends to counter an oflFshore- 
aimed current (caused by the temperature diflFerence 
between nearshore and offshore waters), creating a 
state of equilibrium at the surface and in deep water. 

Upon this moving stage, and controlled by its 
mechanics, the first act of the year&apos;s biological pro-

controlled by the ratio of two depths: the depth from 
the surface to which photosynthetically usable light 
energy penetrates (the photic layer), and the depth 
from the surface to which active, turbulent stirring is 
maintained by winds and currents (the mixed layer). 
If the photic layer is shallow and the mixed layer deep, 
photosynthesizing algal cells (principally silicate- 
requiring diatoms in the spring) will spend, on aver- 
age, much less time in the light. They therefore grow 
at a slower rate than they would if the photic layer 
were deeper or the mixed layer shallower. 

In the lakes in spring, a surface water sample taken 
on the inshore side of the thermal bar, where the mixed 
layer is rendered shallow by stratification, is a green 
suspension of diatoms, while an oflFshore sample from 
the deep mixed layer remains clear. The causes of this 
striking difference have more to do with the mechanics 
of turbulence than with the availability of light or of 
nutrients, both of which are relatively plentiful at that 
time of year. 

At the end of the thermal bar phase in June, lakes 
over almost the whole basin become stratified. Excep- 
tions are Lake Superior, in which cold oifshore pools 
of water persist well into the summer, and the western 
end of Lake Erie, which is too shallow to stratify. The 
water column separates vertically into two more or 
less distinct layers. A warm upper layer, well mixed by 
wind action, overlies a cold layer separated from it by 
a relatively thin interfacial zone — the thermocline — in 
which temperature decreases (and density increases) 
with increasing depth. 

The thickness of the upper mixed layer (usually 
about sixty feet) and the mean depth and shape of the 
thermocline are determined by the fluctuating tide of 
battle between the vertical fluxes of wind-induced 
momentum (product of mechanical energy) and of 
buoyancy (product of thermal energy). This also oc- 
curs in small lakes and oceans. But in a large lake the 
thermocline at any moment is far from level. Turbulent 
motions below the thermocline are weaker than those 
in the upper mixed layer and are largely driven by 
thermocline oscillations. At the same time, the vertical 
density gradient, in the thermocline interface, virtually 
cuts the lower layer off from exchange with the upper 
layer and with the atmosphere. But that barrier is not 
impassable. 

Soon after stratification has become fully established 
across the open waters of the lakes (in early summer), 
essential nutrients in surface oflFshore waters become 
progressively depleted because algal growth there is 
limited to the surface illuminated layer and nutrient 
replenishment from below is impeded at the thermo- 
cline. Until recently, most limnologists held the &quot;clas-

sical&quot; view that nutrient supplies, available in lower 
layers, cannot be drawn upon until the isolating eflFect 
of the thermocline barrier is progressively destroyed 
in the fall. In fact, elaborate and expensive pollution- 
effect models, designed for lake management, have 
been based on this theory. 

By slowly lowering a sampling pump through the 
water column at an offshore station in Lake Michigan, 
we have recently discovered that there are large con- 
centrations of chlorophyll a in layers only a few meters 
thick just below the thermocline during late summer 
and fall. The concentrations are sometimes much 
greater than those usually found at the surface in sum- 
mer. They are produced by species of phytoplankton, 
specially adapted to photosynthesize at very low light 
intensities, that escape the summer starvation in the 
upper layer by operating below the thermocline in a 
thin layer into which just sufficient light penetrates 
from above. The algae in this layer therefore walk a 
tightrope between nutrient limitation on the upper side 
and light limitation on the lower. 



Production continues until late September when 
the thermocline has sunk below the level at which 
sufficient light remains. Until that happens, production 
in that narrow subthermocline layer nourishes a com- 
munity of vertically migrating, grazing zooplankton — 
notably the opossum shrimp, Mysis relicta — and also 
fish foraging in turn upon the grazers. We don&apos;t yet 
know if this active subplay within the larger drama of 
the whole basin production goes on in other basins — 
Lake Superior, for example. 

After August, the surface layer cools and becomes 
denser. Winds more easily mix the less buoyant 
waters. More subthermocline water, with higher nutri- 
ent content, mixes into the upper layer, and the ther- 
mocline recedes deeper. Finally, an &quot;overturn&quot; in 
early December destroys stratification and the phase 
of full winter mixing begins. 

After September, as the thermocline descends and 
the upper mixed layer erodes to successively lower 
layers, the nutrient concentrations at the surface begin 
to rise toward their winter maximums. Also the lower 
layers, previously more or less excluded from contact 
with the atmosphere, can take a deep breath of atmos- 
pheric oxygen. 

Phosphorus clearly plays the role of the limiting 
nutrient, falling below the limits of detection in mid- 
summer. Nitrogen is another universally essential 
nutrient, and silica is needed by diatom plankton, im- 
portant as primary producers in lakes. In the large 
lakes, upward transport of nutrients and downward 
transport of oxygen are not confined entirely to the 
season of stratification breakdown. Such transports 
occur episodically throughout the summer by way of 
localized &quot;mixing windows&quot; through the thermocline 
barrier. 

The stratified lake — the cold lower layer and warm 
upper layer — is acted upon by several forces: first, 
wind applied at the water surface; second, gravity in 
the form of buoyancy associated with the stratifica- 
tion; and third, the deflective force of the earth&apos;s rota- 
tion. The two layers engage in a hydrodynamic pas de 
deux in which the interface between them slowly un- 
dulates. The most dramatic up and down flappings 
occur near shore with upwelling-downwelling motions. 
These motions are storm induced and, in turn, gen- 
erate large waves across the whole thermocline blanket. 

The phytoplankton community — the &quot;grass&quot; of the 
system — produces living material by making use of 
light energy and nutrients. The secondary producers 
(zooplankton) graze upon the grass and, in turn, pro- 
vide food essential for young fish and some adult fish 
as well. Predator fish appear at the apex of the produc-

tion pyramid, feeding upon the smaller, plankton- 
eating fish. All three parts of the food chain interact 
concurrently. In addition, detritus of the living matter 
is recycled. 

Many steps in the demolition sequence require 
oxygen. In this, the organic cycles in lakes and oceans 
do not differ from those on land. Aquatic cycles, 
however, are often distinguished by some degree of 
vertical separation of the phases of production and 
breakdown. This separation is brought about by the 
combined effects of stratification, gravity, and vertical 
variation in intensity of turbulent transport, and by 
the confinement of most primary production to sur- 
face illuminated layers. 

Water turbulence is strongly suppressed in the den- 
sity gradient of the thermocline, and thus much of the 
material entering the demolition cycle sinks through as 
a continuous &quot;snowfall&quot; to become trapped in lower 
layers or in bottom sediments. Therefore much of the 
oxygen-demanding demolition occurs, and most of the 
regenerated nutrients are released, below the thermo- 



cline. The thermocline also bars atmospheric oxygen 
from the lower layers. The consumption of oxygen 
below the thermocline can therefore be used to esti- 
mate rates of biological production for the whole 
basin, although sporadic leakages across the thermo- 
cline do introduce errors into estimates for large lakes. 
When oxygen uptake is used to estimate production 
intensity, it must be noted that oxygen concentration 
below the thermocline barrier is determined not only 
by the rate at which organic matter snows down from 
above but also by the volume of the subthermocline 
compartment. Hence, in Lake Superior, with a low 
production rate and large subthermocline volume, the 
decrease in oxygen concentration during the stratified 
season is extremely small. In the central basin of Lake 
Erie (high production, small volume), the concentra- 
tion falls to low levels (zero in some places) by mid- 
August. In the deeper eastern basin, however, the 
concentration does not fall below 50 percent satura- 
tion, although the total consumption is not much less 
than that in the central basin. Contributing to the heavy

demand for oxygen in Lake Erie, most evident below 
the thermocline in the central basin, is massive 
&quot;blooming&quot; of algae near the surface and subsequent 
transport of that material through the thermocline to 
end up in decaying mats on the bottom. 

Past records of the oxygen-uptake rate may also be 
used to document the history of increasing biological 
production in Lake Erie and other lakes. Lake Erie 
records show strong correlation with regional popula- 
tion growth and, more directly, with input of the limit- 
ing nutrient, phosphorus. 

By the measures we have examined here — chloro- 
phyll production and oxygen uptake — Lake Erie is 
very much alive, despite newspaper reports to the 
contrary. In fact, for many years the commercial fish 
catch has been the highest per unit area of any of the 
lakes, remaining within the range of 16,000 to 29,000 
metric tons from 1961 to 1976. However, the species 
composition has changed dramatically as a result of 
pollution and the progressive disappearance of sub- 
thermocline oxygen in the central basin. That disap- 
pearance led to extinction offish species that lay their 
eggs in the deep, and other species have had to be 
withdrawn from the market because of dangerously 



high levels of chemical contamination (for example, 
mercury in walleye). However, perch production con- 
tinued at near-record levels. Overfishing is the prob- 
able cause of recent decreases. 

In general, the Great Lakes ecosystem has survived 
quite well despite the various and sometimes conflict- 
ing uses humans have made of the lakes&apos; resources. 
The play has changed and some actors have left, but 
there has been an encouraging resilience in the show&apos;s 
response to various threats to its continuance. One 
example is the flourishing sport fishery based on arti- 
ficial introduction of predator fish replacing the orig- 
inal stocks lost to lamprey depredation. In recent years, 
however, one particular threat has emerged, against 
which the large size and biological resilience of the 
lakes may be no protection. That threat, which looms 
larger every year, is the introduction of man-made 
poisons. The effects, only partly known and con- 
trolled, are potentially far more devastating than nutri- 
ent pollution or addition of waste heat from electric 
power stations. Indeed, additional fertility or heat 
sometimes increases fish production, as exemplified 
by Lake Erie, the Green Bay arm of Lake Michigan, 
and other polluted regions. 

But what profit is there in higher production if the 
fish are too contaminated to eat or if the gene pools of 
valuable species have been lost forever? The swelling 
tide of diverse interactions between chemical tech- 
nology and the aquatic environment is a relatively re- 
cent phenomenon. Although much chemical contamin- 
ation occurs at very low concentration levels, the 
frightening features of these developments are per- 
sistence, that is, very slow breakdown rates in the 
aquatic environment; accumulation in particular links 
of the biological chain, for example, predator fish; 
and the introduction of new compounds every year. 

The most important questions before us are. Can we 
devise effective early-warning systems to detect where 
the blows are coming from, and can we find ways to 
ward them off? The urgent task is to apply our collec- 
tive and, in the case of the lakes, binational inventive- 
ness not only to progress in chemical and other tech- 
nologies but also to progress in prediction and control 
of the repercussions of that inventiveness on nature. 
Some parts of this chain of inland seas called the Great 
Lakes are more affected and more threatened than 
others. But local damage reverberates in other places 
and at other times. A precious natural resource will 
be diminished and may even be destroyed for future 
generations unless an awakened and educated public 
insists upon, and is willing to pay for, enlightened 
public planning and management now. D

The Blue-Green Algae Keep Coming 

Lake Superior is the last stand for some microscopic 
floras that were once found throughout the lakes 

by Eugene F. Stoermer 



The conclusion that &quot;Lake Erie is dead,&quot; which we 
have been hearing for almost a generation, tells us 
rhore about the speaker&apos;s point of view than about the 
subject. From a narrow, strictly technological perspec- 
tive, the statement is wrong: Lake Erie today is meas- 
urably more productive of living material than it has 
been for many years. But the environmentalist&apos;s broad 
perspective sees an ecosystem such as a large lake as 
analogous to a living organism and leads him to con- 
clude that Lake Erie is &quot;dead&quot; in the way that an or- 
ganism that has lost several vital functions is dead. To 
the environmentalist, survival of large ecosystems de- 
pends upon the retention of their functional integrity. 

In the case of the Great Lakes, several primary and 
vital functions of the ecosystem have undergone signif- 
icant alteration. Of these functions, the most basic is 
the production of phytoplankton, the microscopic 
algae that are the first link of the food chain, which 
leads through zooplankton to the lakes&apos; fish and, even- 
tually, to human populations. This algal flora is to the 
lakes what grass is to the prairie: it converts the radi- 
ant energy of sunlight and mineral elements into or- 
ganic products that are used by higher organisms. 
Conditions that aflFect the life processes of algae must 
eventually affect other organisms. 

Once a high-quality and almost perfectly exploitable 
system, the Great Lakes have undergone progressive 
degradation in the past three hundred years. When we 
consider that Europeans have been present in the re- 
gion for that time, our understanding of the lakes&apos; 
fundamental properties is surprisingly primitive. One 
reason for this is that logistical problems hindered re- 
search. The lakes are huge and subject to dangerous 
storms. Scientists wishing to work on them faced, at 
best, a very expensive and, at worst, an occasionally 
unpleasant task. 

Another reason is that even when resources were 
available, people tended to study a problem alone, 
rather than its fundamental cause. Only during the past 
thirty years, when certain problems reached cata- 
strophic levels, have funds become available to mount 
the comprehensive investigations necessary to study 
these inland seas. 

Thus our understanding of the basic characteristics 
of the Great Lakes is based partly on reconstruction of 
past states. Scientists are sure, however, that several 
physical characteristics of the lakes have aflFected the 
algal flora. Originally, the lakes&apos; waters were as pure 
as rainwater. This was because the lakes&apos; drainage is 
small compared to their surface area and because much 
of the basin is composed of bedrock types that are 
highly resistant to leaching — the igneous and meta- 



morphoric rocks of the Canadian Shield. Very poor in 
dissolved salts, the lakes&apos; water quality was nearly that 
of distilled water. Of the major nutrients essential for 
algal growth, only nitrogen was present in excess. The 
waters were originally poor in silica and, especially, in 
phosphorus. The term &quot;oligotrophic&quot; well describes 
the nutrient-poor, oxygen-rich state of the pristine 
Great Lakes. 

Another characteristic of the lakes — perhaps the 
most striking — is their sheer physical mass. Taken 
together, they constitute one-fifth of the total standing 
freshwater on the earth&apos;s surface. One consequence of 
this great mass is that the lakes have a tremendous 
heat-storage capacity, which causes their heating and 
cooling to lag considerably behind heating and cooling 
of the surrounding land. The cooling effect of the water 
delays spring flowering in orchards and vineyards 
until after the last frost, and the warming effect of these 
liquid heat engines retards the autumn frosts and per- 
mits fall fruit maturation. Similarly, evaporation given 
up during the winter creates the great snow belts 
around the lakes. 

More significant for algae, this heat-storage capacity 
restricts the dispersal of nutrients in two ways, each 
closely related to water temperature. One mechanism 
for the restriction of nutrients is the springtime thermal 
bar, a barrier created by the convergence of cold and 
warm water. Freshwater reaches its maximum density 
at approximately 40°F. During the spring, the near- 
shore waters are warmed to above the temperature of 
maximum density, while the great mass of deep off- 
shore water is below the temperature of maximum 
density. At the convergence of these water masses 
there develops a narrow zone of maximum density 
water, which sinks and, like a curtain, separates the 
two water masses. This curtain — the thermal bar — re- 
stricts to the shoreline materials fed to the lake by 
streams during the early spring growth period. 

The lakes&apos; heat-storage capability also constrains 
mixing during the summer. In the past, the few min- 
erals that existed in offshore waters were taken up by 
phytoplankton, which then settled during the summer 
months to the cold, dense level, about 60 feet deep, 
called the hypolimnion. The surface waters — the epi- 
limnion — were warmed considerably in the summer 
and tended to float on the hypolimnion. Light pene- 
trated through the lakes&apos; highly transparent waters to 
the upper part of the nutrient-rich hypolimnion, where 
plant growth was stimulated. Light, temperature, and 
nutrient conditions in this zone remained compara- 
tively stable throughout the entire year. 

Another significant characteristic of the Great Lakes 



59 



region is its relative youth. The Laurentian Great 
Lakes were formed only about 10,000 years ago, dur- 
ing the last retreat of the Pleistocene glaciers. By com- 
parison. Lake Baikal, in the Soviet Union, is probably 
50 million years old. Thus, the Great Lakes&apos; organ- 
isms have not had the time to become highly adapted 
to their environment. They lack the resiliency to en- 
vironmental perturbations that is typical of organisms 
in more ancient bodies of water. 

Finally, the location and shape of the Great Lakes 
have influenced the algae populations. North to south, 
the basin lies across the boundary between two major 
climatic regimes, extending from the lower margin of 
the northern boreal forest into the upper part of the 
humid temperate region. The lakes extend the geo- 
graphical range of boreal organisms into the temperate 
climates. Because of their thermal characteristics, the 
lakes also furnish an extension of temporal range of 
certain populations adapted to the low temperatures of 
the Pleistocene climate. The lakes&apos; east to west orien- 
tation was an invitation to early settlers, providing 
water transportation to the rich natural resources in 
the Midwest. This combination of accessibility, on- 
shore natural resources, and clear water led, in turn, to 
concentrations of industry and populations — which fed 
their wastes right back into the lakes. 

Those characteristics produced a distinctive set of 
algal assemblages. As best as can be reconstructed, 
the dominant phytoplankton in the offshore waters of 
the Great Lakes were particularly well adapted to con- 
ditions of low levels of nutrients, relatively cold water 
temperatures, and limited light. The most abundant 
type of algae were diatoms, which were favored by 
the low temperature and the low phosphorus level. 
Unlike other plants, diatoms are dependent upon sili- 
con dioxide, which forms their walls. The diatoms 
were extremely diverse; the number of species in the 
Great Lakes was approximately the same as the num- 
ber of species of vascular plants growing on the sur- 
rounding shores. 

As far as we know, these planktonic floras, free 
floating throughout most of their life cycles, were 
quite similar in offshore waters throughout the lakes, 
despite some differences in water chemical conditions. 
Some areas were more productive than others, and 
differences between nearshore and oflfshore algal flora 
were due to diflferences in nutrient loadings. Large, 
shallow embayments — western Lake Erie, Lake Hu- 
ron&apos;s Saginaw Bay, Lake Michigan&apos;s Green Bay — 
all tended to have floras similar to those found on 
smaller lakes, with their nutrient-rich streams and shal- 
low water readily mixed by wind action. These embay- 



ments produced a great many primary producer organ- 
isms and, in turn, many fish. The fish encouraged 
human settlement. 

As long as the nutrients stayed close to shore, off- 
shore algae levels and types remained quite stable. In 
the winter, the mid-lake water temperature was at or 
below 40°; consequently, there was some mixing be- 
tween levels. Since the organisms in this water mass 
had a good chance of being carried below the depth of 
effective light penetration, winter survival depended 
upon their ability to survive limited light. During the 
summer, they also lived in deep water, so in a way, 
the hypolimnion was a year-round refugium for Great 
Lakes algae and provided a constant food base for 
other organisms as well. 

This rather conservative system seems to have pre- 
vailed until the incursion of nutrient pollutants — espe- 
cially phosphorus — into the middle of the lakes. The 
addition of large amounts of phosphorus, which is what 
scientists call a limiting factor because it is so impor- 
tant to growth in the lakes, stimulated algal growth 
and, consequently, algal uptake of other nutrients. 
Eventually, the available silicon was depleted, and the 
competitive advantage switched from diatoms to phys- 
iological groups that do not require silicon for growth, 
such as green and blue-green algae during the summer. 

When phosphorus loadings increased further, nitro- 
gen levels in the water diminished. At this point blue- 
green algae, which alone can utilize nitrogen from the 
atmosphere, developed a great advantage over algae 
that drew nitrogen from the water. This explains the 
rapid enlargement of the algal biomass at the surface 
and the change from diatom to blue-green algal dom- 
inance. Large populations of blue-green algae are gen- 
erally undesirable because they produce nuisance 
blooms and are poor food sources for zooplankton. 

As the surface became more densely populated, 
water transparency was reduced. Eventually, the 
deepwater refugium in the upper part of the hypolim- 
nion became so shaded that the indigenous diatom 
population could no longer survive. Zooplankton pop- 
ulations feeding in the epilimnion prospered at the ex- 
pense of deepwater species as a consequence of this 
change in the food base. This change, in turn, favored 
invading fish species, such as the alewife, at the ex- 
pense of the indigenous chub, cisco, and lake herring. 

The conservative system that had prevailed, with 
algal productivity taking place almost constantly 
through much of the water column, was now replaced 
by a seasonal cycle of blooms and crashes — massive 
die-offs — of surface algal assemblages. 

Exotic populations have also increased at the ex-

pense of the indigenous species as levels of sodium, 
chloride, and sulfate have increased in the water. At 
present, we cannot accurately evaluate the effects of 
these changes against the background of the very 
large modifications resulting from nutrient pollution. 
They are, however, of concern since these nutrients 
are not removed from the water to an appreciable ex- 
tent by biological activity. Once introduced to a sys- 
tem they remain until flushed out. 

The lakes most affected by this major alteration in 
algae populations are Erie and Ontario. Both have lost 
significant elements of their indigenous flora, replaced 
by large populations of species that thrive under high 
nutrient loadings and some degree of salinification. 
Lake Michigan is in transition; although severe nutri- 
ent imbalance occurs there during summer stratifica- 
tion, some indigenous populations still exist in this 
lake&apos;s offshore waters. Some of the populations 
that dominate in Lakes Erie and Ontario now have a 
foothold in Lake Michigan&apos;s nearshore waters. North- 
ern Lake Huron has undergone only slight modifica- 
tion, in part because of nutrients transported from 
Lake Michigan, but the flora of the southern half of 
Lake Huron is substantially modified as a result of 
materials arising from Saginaw Bay, one of the most 



highly disturbed regions within the Great Lakes sys- 
tem. Lake Superior is the last stand of some of the ex- 
tremely sensitive organisms once found throughout 
the lakes. Local areas in Lake Superior, such as the 
Duluth embayment, now contain many of the blue- 
green species found in the lower lakes. 

Because of its relatively small volume, Lake Erie&apos;s 
nutrient loading problems may be the easiest to solve 
with current technologies. Reversing the trend toward 
salinification may prove more difficult, however. It 
is doubtful that Lake Ontario&apos;s conditions can be im- 
proved under currently envisioned control measures. 
Lake Michigan is at a very critical stage, and its future 
will affect that of Lake Huron, into which it flows. 
Lake Superior is the least modified of all the lakes, 
but it is quite possibly the most fragile system. 

The current efforts to limit phosphorus inputs to the 
lakes by improving sewage treatment and reducing the 
phosphorus content of detergents or banning them en- 
tirely will undoubtedly help reverse the trend of water- 
quality degradation in the lakes. Some of the effects 
of these actions are just now becoming apparent. How- 
ever, the modifications of the system that have re- 
sulted from long-term misuse will not be immediately 
undone. □

The Bald Eagles Return 

A higher birthrate and new management techniques 
justify guarded optimism about the bird&apos;s future 

by Sergej Postupalsky 



Before man altered the environment, a pair of bald 
eagles inhabited every five or ten miles of Great Lakes 
shoreline. This population density held for the south 
shore of Lake Superior until as recently as twenty-five 
years ago, but today no more than two dozen pairs of 
bald eagles remain along the entire Great Lakes 
shoreline. They are about equally divided between 
Lakes Erie and Superior, where an encouraging in- 
crease in reproduction appears to have begun about 
seven years ago. 

To maintain their population, bald eagles must pro- 
duce, on the average, a minimum of 0.7 young per pair 
each year. But for many years this rate of reproduction 
was not reached, except in the western part of Michi- 
gan&apos;s Upper Peninsula in some years in the 1960s. 

As an ornithologist, I found the study of bald eagles 
extremely frustrating until recently. In late winter or 
early spring, I would observe the eagles return to their 
aeries and refurbish them with new sticks and grass. In 
March and April, I would see one of the pair sitting low 
in the nest, apparently incubating eggs. By late April or 
May, however, the adults would be gone, leaving no 
young in the nests. This fruitless cycle was repeated 
year after year. One after the other, the breeding sites 
were deserted as the old eagles died off and no mature 
birds took their place. 

This pattern was more pronounced near the Great 
Lakes. While from 37 to 66 percent of pairs nesting on 
inland lakes, reservoirs, marshes, and rivers were able 
to raise young, only about 10 percent of pairs occupying 
aeries near the Great Lakes produced eaglets. 

The onset of reproductive failures, which affected 
other raptors and fish eaters besides the bald eagle, 
coincided with the introduction of the pesticide DDT 
after World War II. The unrestricted dispersal of this 
compound led to its accumulation in many of the 
world&apos;s ecosystems, especially in aquatic ones. Al- 
though its use in the United States had declined well 
before it was banned in 1972, DDT greatly affected the 
bald eagle because of the bird&apos;s longevity and its 
position as the terminal link in a long aquatic food chain. 
Although no pesticide data for recent eagle eggs are 
available to test whether the improving nest success is 
attributable to decreasing contamination, several 
studies show that residues of DDT and its metabolites 
(breakdown products) have been declining in some 
birds and in Great Lakes fish. Still, the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service reports no decrease in pesticide bur- 
dens in dead bald eagles through 1974. 

Not until the late 1960s was the precise cause of 
reproductive failure identified. Although DDT had been 
a prime suspect all along, more than two decades of 



painstaking research demonstrated that it was DDE, a 
metabolite of DDT, that interfered with the formation of 
eggshells in the female bird and caused her to produce 
eggs with abnormally thin or soft shells. The more DDE 
in the female&apos;s system, the thinner the shells she 
produced. These shells usually cracked or were 
crushed during incubation. The extremely thin-shelled 
bald eagle eggs from the Great Lakes aeries were found 
to be heavily contaminated with DDE, as well as other 
pollutants. Scientists were therefore not surprised at 
the near-zero breeding success of bald eagles nesting 
closest to the Great Lakes, the bodies of water contain- 
ing the most DDT. 

The ratio of 0.7 fledged young per pair was attained or 
exceeded by bald eagles in Michigan&apos;s Upper Peninsula 
in eleven of the last seventeen years. Eagles in the 
state&apos;s Lower Peninsula consistently produced below 
this level until 1970 and above it since then. More 
recently, the Lower Peninsula&apos;s bald eagle population 
has increased slightly, from fewer than two dozen pairs 
to the twenty-six pairs identified in 1977. At least eight 
new pairs of eagles have become established since 1974 
in parts of Michigan where bald eagles had not nested 
for more than a decade. There were eighty-seven pairs 
of eagles in Michigan in 1977. Still, reproduction has 
been spotty in the narrow eastern portion of the Upper 
Peninsula. 

The first indication of recovery of the species near 
the Great Lakes occurred in 1971, on Lake Erie&apos;s 
Canadian shore. In the past seven years, more eaglets 
have been raised there than in the preceding decade, 
even though fewer pairs have been present recently. 
On the Ohio side of Lake Erie, after a hiatus of two 
years during which no eagles fledged, between one 
and three young have been reared annually since 1973. 
Nevertheless, the population of approximately ten 
pairs of bald eagles at the western end of Lake Erie is 
one of the most endangered groupings of the species. 
At least three adult eagles have been shot on the On- 
tario side of the lake in recent years, and three adults 
are known to have been electrocuted on power 
transmission lines on the Ohio side since 1974. A small, 
isolated population cannot sustain such attrition of 
breeding-age birds much longer as dead mates are al- 
most impossible to replace. 

No signs of improved nesting success were noted at 
Lake Superior until 1977, when five nests on the south 
shore produced a total of six young. One breeding 
site had young last year for the first time in at least 
seventeen years, even though a pair had been present 
every year and had attempted breeding in most years. 
In 1969 the remains of a shell-less egg were found in 



62 



this pair&apos;s nest, and in 1970 the same nest contained 
an intact egg with a shell nearly 40 percent thinner 
than normal, pre-DDT eagle eggs. These develop- 
ments, although encouraging, do not mean that the 
bald eagle is now out of danger in the Great Lakes. 
I suspect that most, if not all, of the successful 1977 
nesters were young females raised in the interior, where 
DDT has had considerably less effect than on the Great 
Lakes. Most occupied Lake Superior eagle nests are 
situated near the healthy interior population in the 
western Upper Peninsula of Michigan and in northern 
Wisconsin. Will these birds continue to breed success- 
fully after they have fed on Great Lakes fish for an 
extended period of time? 

The bald eagle&apos;s gain in population since the ban- 
ning of DDT justifies guarded optimism about the 
species&apos; future in the Great Lakes area and elsewhere. 
To be sure, other factors, once overshadowed by the 
&quot;thin eggshell syndrome,&quot; continue to affect the 
eagles — especially man-caused mortality and the de- 
velopment of lakeshore habitat for human uses. Now 
that the threat of DDT appears to be abating, manage- 
ment efforts must concentrate on preserving and en- 
hancing sufficient breeding habitats to perpetuate 
healthy, growing eagle populations. At the same time, 
we must remain alert to the effects of toxic substances 
released into the environment. 

The provision of artificial nest structures is one of 



several promising techniques available to wildlife 
managers. We have known for several years that bald 
eagles will use such platforms, which were accepted 
recently in Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Idaho. 
But it was not until the summer of 1977 that successful 
nesting by bald eagles in man-made nests was reported 
— five eagles fledged from two platforms in Michigan. 

The success of man-made nests opens up several 
possibilities for nest-site manipulation. Artificial nests 
may prove useful as replacements for structurally weak 
nests, allowing pairs to remain in good breeding areas 
even when natural sites are at a premium. They may 
also attract new pairs to suitable, but currently unoc- 
cupied, breeding habitats and to other places lacking 
natural nest sites. In addition, the chances of successful 
nesting may be improved by moving nests that are 
exposed to human activity to secluded sites nearby. 

Other manipulative management techniques have 
been tried with the bald eagle. Captive-bred nestlings 
have been released into endangered populations 
through fostering to wild pairs or through the hacking 
technique of falconry. Eggs have been transferred from 
healthy populations to nests of contaminated, non- 
productive pairs; injured and rehabilitated eagles have 
been released; and uncontaminated food has been 
provided in the winter. At least some of these tech- 
niques hold promise for the recovery of the bald 
eagle of the Great Lakes. D

The Decline of Lake Plants 

Human activities over the past eighty years have contributed to 
a 50 percent decrease in the aquatic flora of an Ohio harbor 

by Ronald L. Stuckey 



At their present state of knowledge about aquatic 
flowering plant species composition, botanists cannot 
make definite statements about the causes of changes in 
lake flora. The best we can do is analyze probable 
causes. We can, however, be considerably more defi- 
nite in measuring these alterations. Eighty years ago, 
forty different aquatic flowering plants flourished in 
Put-in-Bay harbor, in western Lake Erie, then one of 
the most diverse communities of these plant species in 
the United States. Today, only half these species sur- 
vive, and of these, several are rare and in danger of 
disappearing from the harbor altogether. 

Scientists can analyze the changes and trace the 
decline of aquatic flowering plants in the Put-in-Bay 
area because of existing historical records. Dried speci- 
mens of these plants have been preserved in museums 
and herbariums for the past eighty years. Together 
with associated data from the area, these specimens 
make up one of the most complete records of aquatic 
flowering plants for a given locality in North America. 
•Among the first comprehensive surveys of aquatic 
flowering plants in the United States were those made in 
western Lake Erie in 1898 by Adrian J. Pieters, as part 
of the United States Fish Commission&apos;s investigation of 
the biology of the Great Lakes. Pieters did his most 
thorough field work at Put-in-Bay; as the headquarters 
for his survey, it was the most accessible of the several 
areas that he studied. His paper &quot;The Plants of Western 
Lake Erie, with Observations on their Distribution,&quot; 
published in 1901, is regarded by botanists as a classic. 

A contemporary of Pieters, a high school science 
teacher named Edwin L. Moseley, recorded the plants 
of western Lake Erie and Put-in-Bay harbor. In the 
twentieth century, several botanists have studied the 
aquatic flowering plants at Put-in-Bay. During the 
summer months of 1967 through 1970, I conducted 
fieldwork at Put-in-Bay, and by comparing the results of 
my work with the record assembled by Pieters, 
Moseley, and others, I was able to trace the change in 
the abundance of the aquatic plant species over the 
previous seventy years. During the past ten years, the 
aquatic flora has changed very little in the area studied. 

Put-in-Bay harbor is a semicircular inlet on the 
north shore of South Bass Island, Ohio, which is four 
miles offshore, about halfway between Cleveland and 
Toledo, Ohio. The harbor is protected on the north by 
Gibraltar Island, which reduces wave and wind action 
from that direction, and is divided into three 
subinlets — the main harbor. Squaw Harbor, and 
Fishery Bay. A small body of water called Terwilliger&apos;s 
Pond extends inland from Fishery Bay. 

My study indicates that since Pieters&apos;s work, drastic 



U 



changes have occurred in the aquatic flowering flora at 
Put-in-Bay. Pieters reported forty species of sub- 
mersed, floating-leaved, and emersed rooted plants. Of 
these, eight were never reported in later surveys, and 
by 1949 fourteen species had disappeared. Twenty 
species remained in the 1967-70 survey, but only one of 
these is considered to be abundant. Of the remaining 
nineteen, nine are considered to be rare (few in number 
at one or two study sites); eight are occasional (few in 
number at three or more sites); and two are common (in 
large numbers at most sites). Comparison of the present 
information on abundance for each species with data 
given by Pieters in 1901 shows a gradual decrease in 
abundance for the surviving species. 

Descriptions of Squaw Harbor by several botanists 
summarize the changes that have taken place in Put- 
in-Bay&apos;s flora since the turn of the century. Pieters 
wrote: &quot;The bottom of this bay varies much, being 
stony in some places and muddy in others. The water 
is turbid, and it is usually impossible to see plants more 
than two to three feet below the surface. 

&quot;Squaw Harbor is bordered by a narrow strip of 
rushlike plants. These plants are limited abruptly on the 
land side by the rocks and on the other side by a depth of 
from 2 to 2.5 feet of water. Toward the east Sagittaria 
rigida [rigid arrowhead] forms a prominent group, 
extending about thirty feet from the shore and finding its 
limit of depth in about 2.5 feet of water. . . . This species 
also occurs on the other shore with Scirpus laciistris [S. 
aciitus, hard-stem bulrush], but is not as abundant as 
on the east side.&quot; Of the original forty species at Put- 
in-Bay, Pieters noted twenty-nine in Squaw Harbor. 

In 1934, Lewis H. Tiffany wrote that the water in 
Squaw Harbor was shallow and much protected from 
winds and might become choked with aquatic plants in 
late summer. Fifteen years later, in 1949, Earl L. Core 
noted that the mud bottom in Squaw Harbor continued 
to slope gradually and was &quot;still covered with a dense 
mass of vegetation.&quot; He also noted an appreciable 
increase in turbidity and further observed that &quot;the 
shores of Squaw Harbor are now almost completely 
lined with boat docks and more continue to be built. 
This has almost eliminated the narrow strip of rushlike 
plants that fringed the shores in 1898. Only occasional 
plants of Scirpus validus [soft-stem bulrush] and S. 
americanus [three-square] still occur. Sagittaria rigida 
. . . has now apparently completely disappeared ... [It 
was] present as late as 1940 [but] its disappearance may 
have been partly due to the high water of 1943-48 and 
partly due to increasing activity about the numerous 
docks in the locality. . . . Carex comosa [sedge] has 
likewise disappeared. . . . The &apos;thick growth&apos; of Dian- 



67 



thera [Justicia] americana [water willow] along the 
south shore has completely disappeared.&quot; Still, vari- 
ous submersed species remained abundant. 

Finally, my field work revealed that even the sub- 
mersed species had declined considerably in Squaw 
Harbor. Core had noted thirteen species, but I could 
find only seven of them. Small colonies of seven 
emersed species along the shoreline that were present 
in 1967 had disappeared by 1970, following a sudden 
rise in lake water level and increased boat traffic. 

Botanists&apos; records tell the same story about the plants 
in the main harbor and Fishery Bay. In 1949, Core 
wrote of the main harbor that &quot;almost nothing grows in 
this area today, perhaps because of the increased 
turbidity and activity of boats.&quot; By the late 1960s, few 
plants were found at all in the main harbor. In Fishery 
Bay, Core wrote, plants &quot;are now scattered in patches, 
the location of which apparently varies from year to 
year. No significant difference was noted in the inven- 
tory of species, which Pieters reported. . . . However, 
Pieters recorded those species as &apos;abundant&apos; or &apos;com- 
mon&apos; in 1898, whereas they can scarcely be so regarded 
at the present time, except near the shores.&quot; Although 
there were two newcomers to Fishery Bay since 1949, 
abundance and number of plant species were reduced 
by the time of my own fieldwork in the late 1960s. 

Several environmental conditions may be responsi- 
ble for changes in the aquatic flowering flora at Put-in- 
Bay. One is the effect of high water. Records of the 
water levels of the Great Lakes show that Lake Erie&apos;s 
level fluctuates from two feet to four feet about every 
ten years. If aquatic plants are sensitive to these 
changes in water level, then we should see changes in 
species composition and abundance over time. Those 
species that are tolerant of a sudden rise in water level 
have mechanisms that allow them to survive during 
high water. For example, the flowering rush (Butomiis 
umbellatus) changes form. On a mud flat, it is a stout, 
erect plant with many bright pink flowers. Submersed, 
it remains a vegetative plant, with limp, three-angled 
leaves, which does not flower. The white water lily 
{Nymphaea tuberosa) and the yellow spatterdock 
{Niiphar advena) grow longer petioles in response to 
high water levels, thus enabling their broad leaves 
to float on the water surface or project above the 
water surface, respectively. On the other hand, cattails 
(Typha angiistifolia, T. latifolia), common arrowhead 
{Sagittaria latifolia), and bur reed (Sparganium 
eurycarpuin) are drastically affected by a sudden rise in 
water level; a rise of as little as one or two feet can 
partially or totally eliminate them from a pond or marsh. 
They apparently have no vegetative mechanism to 



allow for survival in deep water. The disappearance of 
certain species during high-water times is usually only 
temporary, and when water levels go down, exposing 
shorelines and mud flats, these species will return, 
having survived as seeds in the mud and sediments for 
many years. The dynamic and fluctuating water-level 
conditions that occur in the Lake Erie marshes provide 
a major explanation for the great diversity of species 
there, compared with natural inland lakes and inland 
marshes, which have more stable water levels. 

Changes in water temperature also appear to affect 
aquatic flora. Of the twenty species no longer present in 
Put-in-Bay harbor, eleven occur principally in cool- 
water habitats mostly to the north of Lake Erie. Of the 
twenty species identified by Pieters that still survive in 
the harbor, fourteen have widespread distributions, 
extending both to the north and to the south of Lake 
Erie, as well as throughout the eastern United States or 
North America. The northern species apparently are 
less tolerant of the warmer water conditions that have 
developed recently , especially in the shallow bays , than 
are the widespread species. Of the eleven northern 
submersed species inventoried by Pieters, only one, 
Richardson&apos;s pondweed {Potamogeton richardsonii), 
survives at Put-in-Bay. 

Another significant cause of the decline in Put-in- 
Bay&apos;s submersed flora is the increased turbidity of the 
water. Pieters noted in his 1898 study that the water in 
and around the harbor was less clear than that of other 
sampling sites. One writer, who worked at the harbor in 
the early 1940s, pointed out that many of the rows of 
vineyards on the island were laid out in the same 
direction as the slope of the land and perpendicular to 
the shoreline. This layout, along with cultivation be- 
tween the rows, facilitated extensive erosion. A local 
newspaper noted in 1898, the same year that Pieters did 
his survey, &quot;that there was no end of complaint about 
mud and water standing ankle deep in the vineyard 
rows&quot; — mud that made its way into the water of the 
harbor. In general, the more turbid the water, the less 
effective the penetration of light, which in turn retards 
photosynthesis to the extent that the plants do not 
produce enough food to live. 

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Bernard S. Meyer 
and his students studied the relationship of turbidity, 
depth, and apparent photosynthesis in six selected 
submersed species in western Lake Erie&apos;s island area. 
They measured the compensation point — where no net 
photosynthesis occurs — and found that with continued 
turbidity through the years, the compensation point 
remains close to the surface. Consequently, plants with 
high light requirements will not produce enough food 



68 



and eventually will die. A comparison of the results of 
their studies with the present abundance of these same 
six species in Put-in-Bay harbor showed that over the 
years increased turbidity — due to erosion, dredging, 
and shoreline construction — has caused the reduction 
or elimination of those species, such as flexed naiad 
{Najas flexilis) and waterweed (Elodea canadensis), 
determined by Meyer and his students to have shallow 
compensation points and high requirements for light. 
Conversely, wild celery (Vallisneria americana) had a 
compensation point below thirty feet, meaning that it 
could carry on photosynthesis in dim light and grow at 
the greatest depths. Of the original forty species, it is by 
far the most abundant species in the bay. 

My work at Put-in-Bay also suggested that turbidity 
may be a limiting factor. In 1967, Terwilliger&apos;s Pond, 
which is connected to the harbor by a narrow inlet 
from Fishery Bay, had five submersed species in the 
shallow water along the northwest bank. These species 
were still there in the summer of 1968, but in greater 
abundance and in the company of three additional 
species. At the pond&apos;s west end, which had shallow, 
relatively clear water, no submersed species were 
present in 1967, but I found five in 1968. However, with 
the one- to two-foot rise in Lake Erie&apos;s water level in the 
summer of 1969, considerable erosion occurred along 
the south bank of the pond. By the summer of 1970, at 
least two feet of the bank had washed away, causing 
increased turbidity in the pond&apos;s water. I found no 
species of submersed aquatic plants anywhere in Ter- 
williger&apos;s Pond that summer. 

Besides high water, warmer water, and water turbid- 
ity, other reasons for the reduction and elimination of 
aquatic flowering plants at Put-in-Bay are the de- 
creased oxygen content of Lake Erie and man&apos;s in- 
creased use of the harbor for recreation. The first 
factor is well documented. Many of the northern spe- 
cies that are especially sensitive to warm water and 
turbidity are also more tolerant of well-oxygenated 
ponds and lakes than of the eutrophic conditions fre- 
quently found in Lake Erie during the summer. 

The effect of human activities on the Great Lakes is 
becoming better known, and Put-in-Bay, which has 
become a major resort town, has been particularly 
affected by cultural change. Many tourists arrive by 
sail and power vessels; consequently, the harbor is 
now lined with docks to accommodate them. Continued 
and increasing use of motorboats tears and uproots 
submersed plants. Exhaustgases and engine oil, as well 
as sewage dumped into the water, have detrimental 
effects on the plants. The harbor has been dredged in 
many places to permit access by larger boats and 



retaining walls have been constructed along the 
shoreline. Formerly ideal shallow-water habitats, with 
bottoms gradually sloping from the shore to deep water, 
have been virtually eliminated and replaced with deep, 
muddy channels. Aquatic species with narrow ecologi- 
cal tolerances and with distribution limited to these 
once-shallow, once-less-turbid areas have been de- 
stroyed. But other species with wider ecological toler- 
ances have survived or colonized in areas more dis- 
turbed by man&apos;s actions. 

The depletion of flowering aquatic plants at Put-in- 
Bay is well illustrated when compared with the flora of 
the ponds on Lake Erie&apos;s islands. Based on the original 
records, thirty species of submersed, unattached float- 
ing aquatic flowering plants occurred in Put-in-Bay 
harbor and the isolated ponds on the islands. Five 
species were common to both habitats. Of the ten spe- 
cies that were restricted to the isolated ponds, all con- 
tinue to survive there today, whereas only five of the 
fifteen that were restricted to Put-in-Bay continue to 
survive. In other words, ofthose ten submersed species 
that have disappeared from the area, all inhabited only 
bays. The ponds that still survive are essentially the 
same today as they were eighty years ago, influenced by 
humans, at most, by surface wash from adjacent 
cultivated fields. By contrast, it is evident that the 
changes brought about by human activity in Put-in-Bay 
harbor have had a profound influence in bringing 
about the decline of the submersed aquatic flora. 

Similar changes have occurred at another northern 
United States lake. Lake East Okoboji, Iowa, where 
twenty-six of forty-four species identified in a 1915 
study had disappeared by 1961. The reduction in the 
submersed species was, as at Put-in-Bay, especially 
striking, for of twenty-three species, eighteen were lost. 
The botanists who did the 1961 fieldwork identified 
several causes for the lake&apos;s loss of plants, among them, 
intense use of the surrounding land for agriculture and 
other exploitation of the lake and its shores. These 
human activities led to increased siltation, turbidity, 
and nutrient content in the water. Comparisons of 1922 
studies of the plant life in University Bay, Lake Men- 
dota, Wisconsin, with 1966 studies indicate that al- 
though conditions there apparently are not as drastic 
as they are in Lake East Okoboji or at Put-in-Bay, 
similar conditions could develop. The pattern may re- 
peat itself: species of aquatic flowering plants whose 
ecological tolerances are narrow will mostly dis- 
appear as clear, cool, well-oxygenated water becomes 
turbid, warm, and poorly oxygenated. Such changes 
should be taken as warnings if man intends to maintain 
high diversity in the flora of lakes and bays. D

Pollutants from the Sky 

Airborne toxic elements are one of the 

biggest — and most baffling — problems for the lakes 

by Jon I. Parker 



Among the most important and least understood pol- 
lutants of the Great Lakes ecosystem in the past cen- 
tury are trace elements from atmospheric fallout. Trace 
elements — chemical elements, such as mercury, cad- 
mium, copper, zinc, and lead, that are present in the 
water at extremely low concentrations — may be highly 
toxic to aquatic biota. Some trace elements, such as 
zinc, are essential for the normal metabolism of biota, 
but the margin between required and toxic levels is fre- 
quently narrow. 

Wind-raised soil dust, automobile exhausts, and 
cement and steel manufacturing all contribute trace ele- 
ments to the atmosphere. However, the combustion of 
fossil fuels, particularly coal, probably is the major 
anthropogenic source of atmospheric trace elements to 
the Great Lakes. Coal-fired power plants presently 
provide about 80 percent of the basin&apos;s fossil fuel gen- 
erating capacity. Increasing demands for electricity 
and a greater dependence on coal as the major power- 
plant fuel suggest that trace element pollution in the 
Great Lakes will increase. 

Some of the trace elements from combustion, such 
as mercury, cadmium, and copper, can kill aquatic 
organisms at concentrations of several parts per million 
parts of water and cause more subtle effects at lower 
concentrations. Planktonic algae suffer reduced photo- 
synthetic rates and planktonic animals show reduced 
reproductive capacity at trace element concentrations 
in the parts per billion range. These responses could 
result in undesirable changes in species composition in 
the lakes. For example, the level of copper in Lake 
Michigan exceeds the toxicity threshold for certain 
types of freshwater algae. Algal microfossils from the 
sediment of Lake Michigan show that dramatic shifts 
have occurred in species composition during the past 
one hundred years — possibly because of the toxic ef- 
fects of trace elements. 

In addition, some combinations of trace elements 
behave synergistically, that is, an organism&apos;s response 
to a mixture of elements is greater than the sum of its 
responses to the individual elements. While the present 
concentration of any single trace element in the Great 
Lakes may not be hazardous, the cumulative effects 
of all trace elements may be causing subtle impacts. 
Furthermore, a few trace elements, for example, mer- 
cury, accumulate in the tissue of aquatic organisms. 
Predators may concentrate large doses of toxic mate- 
rials by eating contaminated prey. Some fish have be- 
come so affected by mercury and other toxic sub- 
stances in lake waters that restrictions on human con- 
sumption have been imposed. 

In coal-fired power plants, trace elements are mobi- 



lized during high temperature combustion. About 70 
percent of many trace elements is partitioned to the 
flue gas; less than 30 percent goes to the solid wastes. 
Efficient collection devices, called electrostatic pre- 
cipitators, can remove 95 to 99 percent of the fly ash, 
along with its adsorbed trace elements, from the flue 
gas. The collected fly ash is subsequently diverted back 
into the solid waste. A small fraction of the trace ele- 
ments escape to the atmosphere as vapors and as con- 
stituents of the microscopic fly ash particles that es- 
cape collection. 

The solid wastes — bottom ash, boiler slag, and fly 
ash from the precipitators — and sludge from flue-gas 
desulfurization equipment, called scrubbers, fre- 
quently are sluiced (with water from the power plant) 
into ash disposal ponds. Sometimes water in the ponds, 
highly enriched with trace elements leached from the 
solid wastes, seeps through the pond wall or is dis- 
charged into local waterways. In one case, pond efflu- 
ent raised the arsenic level in a receiving stream above 
recommended water-quality standards. In 1975, the 
United States electric utility industry produced about 
50 million tons of solid waste that was rich in trace ele- 
ments. A recent assessment projected an increase to 
130 million tons of solid waste per year by 1980. This 
source of trace elements may become increasingly 
important in future lake pollution. 

Currently, the smaller fly ash particles and the 
vapors that exit the stacks are the major source of 
power plant derived trace elements to the Great 
Lakes. They pollute the atmosphere downwind from 
the power plants. Subsequent fallout, both wet and 
dry. deposits the trace elements on the land and water 
surfaces of the Great Lakes basin. 

Usually, soil and vegetation effectively retain trace 
elements on the land. But in areas where the deposition 
is accompanied by acidic rainfall due to air pollutants, 
such as oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, the acid reduces 
the soil&apos;s capacity to retain the trace elements, which 
run ofiF into local waterways. This can result in severe 
water pollution. For example, in some Adirondacks 
lakes in New York, acidic rainfall has introduced suffi- 
cient quantities of aluminum to cause the extermination 
of brook trout in 90 percent of the affected lakes. Al- 
though certain areas along the northern margin of the 
Great Lakes basin may also become affected in this 
way, most of the soil and water in the basin has a high 
acid-neutralizing capacity and similar effects are un- 
likely in the Great Lakes as a whole. 

Direct deposition on the surface of the lakes prob- 
ably provides the major input mechanism for trace ele- 
ments in the lakes. Most of the heavy industry and 



70 



Power plants as far inland as this one 

in Lansing, Michigan, spread trace 

elements that may end up in the lakes. 



about 60 percent of the basin&apos;s coal-fired generating 
capacity is located along the southern margin of the 
lakes, and the prevailing southwesterly wind transports 
stack emissions from these sources out over the lakes. 
Most of these emissions will fall out within 35 miles of 
the source. The zones of maximum deposition are 
probably the lake surfaces northeast of such large, in- 
dustrial cities as Chicago, Gary, and Cleveland. 

Furthermore, atmospheric fallout is greater over 
water than over land because air turbulence is most 
intense when the water temperature is higher than the 
overlying air temperature. This situation occurs over 
the Great Lakes throughout most of the year, particu- 
larly during the fall, winter, and early spring. Greater 
demand for electricity during this cooler period of the 
year requires increased fuel combustion. Consequently, 
stack emissions increase during cooler months when 
atmospheric conditions are conducive to trace element 
deposition. 

While there have been no direct measurements of 
trace element fallout over all the Great Lakes, two 
separate Lake Michigan investigations concluded that 
the atmosphere contributes a large fraction of the 
annual load of certain trace elements compared with 
natural inputs from tributary streams. 

This should lead to higher concentrations of trace 
elements in the waters of the Great Lakes ecosystem. 
But generally speaking, the concentrations in the Great 
Lakes do not reflect the increased inputs , and most of the 
highly toxic trace elements are present at less than ten 
parts per billion. These levels do not exceed estimates of 
the average concentration in surface waters of the 
United States. Apparently, water chemistry, biological 
activity, and sedimentation interact to transfer trace 
elements from the water to the sediment. Recent 
measurements at Argonne National Laboratory re- 
vealed that the upper sediment layers in Lake Michigan 
contained two to four times higher concentrations of 
such trace elements as zinc and lead compared with 
sediment deposited about one hundred years ago. 
Similar trends have been observed in other lakes. The 
enriched elements in recent sediments are common in 
emissions from fossil-fuel combustion. 

A few cases of above normal trace element levels in 
Great Lakes&apos; biota have been reported, including ele- 
vated levels of cadmium, chromium, copper, and 
arsenic in certain fish species from Lakes Michigan and 
Huron. In another instance, apparently higher sele- 
nium levels were found in zooplankton from Lake 
Michigan. The area of highest concentration appeared 
immediately downwind from the Chicago-Gary metro- 
politan area. Fortunately, instances of toxic trace ele- 



(E) Robert P Carr 




ment accumulation in commercially important fish 
species from the lakes have been rare. 

Recently, the rates of deposition of some trace ele- 
ments in Great Lakes&apos; sediment appear to be declining. 
This suggests that input rates are also declining and 
that efforts to comply with the Clean Air Act (1963) and 
its amendments are reducing the emission rates. How- 
ever, this apparent decline may be offset by substantial 
increases in the basin&apos;s fossil-fired electric generating 
capacity in the near future. The future demands for 
electricity in the basin may require increasing the total 
generating capacity, from the present level of 62 billion 
watts to about 400 billion watts by the year 2020. Coal 
will play a significant role in meeting this demand. A 
recent assessment of increased coal use in the Midwest 
indicates at least a doubling of coal-fired generating 
capacity in the basin by 2020. 

In anticipation of this trend, the electric utility com- 
panies in the basin are investing substantially in coal 
mining and transportation and acquiring ten- to thirty- 
year contracts for delivery of large quantities of coal. 
For example, Detroit Edison Company is currently 
constructing a large coal-handling terminal near 
Duluth, Minnesota, to transfer coal shipped by unit 
train from the Plains states to large ships for transport

to new power plants in the Detroit region. Coal ship- 
ments on the Great Lakes are expected to double ton- 
nage by the year 2000. A large coal-fired power plant is 
being planned southwest of Chicago. Coal for this plant 
will be barged on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers. 
Recent advances in barging efficiency and a lengthen- 
ing of the barging season by improved ice-breaking 
techniques will expedite the flow of coal to the region. 
The expected growth of coal-fired generating capac- 
ity in the basin may be constrained through enforce- 
ment of the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act. 
These set more stringent limits on emission of particu- 
late materials and oxides of sulfur and nitrogen and 
establish zones that are to be protected against signifi- 
cant deterioration in air quality. If stack gas cleaning 
technologies cannot achieve compliance with the regu- 
lations, then alternative power-generation methods 
may be developed. In areas where air quality is poor, 
restrictions may be imposed on siting of new plants. 

Improved controls may reduce each plant&apos;s particu- 
late emissions by half, but if the total generating capac- 
ity is doubled, there will be no reduction in the basin&apos;s 
total emissions. Furthermore, the present regulations 
do not specifically limit the quantity of highly toxic 
trace elements adsorbed on the particulates nor do they 
limit the emission of trace element vapors. Increased 
coal combustion in the future could cause increases in 
the emission of such elements as mercury, selenium, 
chlorine, and bromine. 

Further pollution by atmospheric trace elements 
probably will occur in the Great Lakes. While the im- 
pact on water quality may be minimal, the biota and 
sediment should be routinely monitored in the future to 
detect any changes in community structure related to 
trace element pollution. □

Legacy of a Thirsty Society 



Water intakes and cooling systems kill 
billions of plants and fish daily 

by Steven A. Spigarelli 



The demand for Great Lakes water is enormous and 
growing — and increasingly destructive of aquatic life. 
Some thermal electric power plants along the lake 
shores generate up to 2,200 megawatts of electricity 
and use inshore water at a rate as high as 2.6 billion 
gallons per day for condenser cooling. The single 
largest municipal water intake at Chicago withdraws 
approximately 900 million gallons per day. 

The Great Lakes Basin Commission projects that as 
the human population of the region doubles between 
1970 and 2020, the demand for Great Lakes water will 
increase tenfold (from 12 to more than 100 billion 
gallons per day). Today, up to 0.1 percent of the in- 
shore waters are used every day for cooling purposes. 
By 2000, that daily figure probably will exceed 1 per- 
cent in Lake Michigan and 3 percent in Lake Ontario. 

Every day, billions of small animals and plants and 
thousands of larger fish are killed or injured by intakes 
and cooling systems. During peak reproductive pe- 
riods, billions of juvenile fish and millions of adult fish 
are killed daily. An electric utility study has estimated 
the numbers of fish eggs and larvae entrained at some 
power plants on Lake Michigan at greater than 5 billion 
alewife, 1 15 million smelt, and 1 million yellow perch. 
Extrapolation of these figures to all power plant and 
municipal water intakes provides estimates of egg and 
larval mortalities on the order of 15 billion alewife, 600 
million smelt, and 1.5 million yellow perch. 

The alewife, an exotic immigrant from the Atlantic 
Ocean, has become one of the most important fish in 
Lake Michigan. It has undergone huge population fluc- 
tuations in the past few decades. In the summer of 
1965, millions of these small, shadlike fish died during 
their inshore spawning migrations, leaving massive 
piles rotting on the shores. Dead alewives clogged mu- 
nicipal and industrial water intakes, and large power 
plant generators burned out or were shut down be- 
cause of reduced intake flows. Mortality was even 
greater in 1966 and 1967 when one-third to one-half of 
the total alewife population died oflF. 

Despite the extreme fluctuations in its population, 
the alewife continues to be the most abundant fish in 
Lake Michigan. As the primary forage fish for salmon 
and trout, which are stocked annually, the alewife is 
the key to successful management of exotic salmonid 
stocks. 

Recent studies by the Great Lakes Fishery Labora- 
tory indicate that the standing crop biomass (total 
annual weight) of alewife remained relatively stable in 
Lake Michigan from 1970 until recently. But scientists 
are now concerned about new pressures on the alewife 
population from increasing stocks of salmonids, as 



well as by increased mortalities at water intakes. Stud- 
ies at Argonne National Laboratory estimate that, at a 
minimum, about 37 percent of the total alewife bio- 
mass in Lake Michigan dies annually owing to three of 
the many stresses related to man&apos;s activities. This 
estimate includes 33 percent due to predation by 
stocked salmonid fishes, 3.5 percent in the commercial 
harvest, and 0.3 percent due to impingement of large 
alewives on intake screens. Approximately 42 million 
alewives, totaling 2.7 million pounds, were killed on 
Lake Michigan intake screens in 1975. This figure may 
be relatively small, but we do not know what levels of 
mortality constitute a threat to various species. 

Several other Lake Michigan fish populations may 
be aflfected by water intakes, the most likely being the 
rainbow smelt and the yellow perch. Pqpulations of 
both species have fluctuated greatly over the past few 
decades, probably as a result of intense fishing and the 
eflfects of the alewife fluctuations. A minimum of 55 
percent of the standing crop biomass of smelt dies an- 
nually in Lake Michigan — 42 percent by predation, 
4 percent by commercial fishing, 9 percent by sport 
fishing, and 0.3 percent by impingement on intake 
screens. Yellow perch are not very abundant in Lake 
Michigan except in eutrophic areas such as Green 
Bay. About 2 million pounds of yellow perch are 
caught annually by commercial and sport fishermen, 
and of that amount, about 13,000 pounds are killed 
through impingement at water intakes. 

The losses of adult and juvenile fishes at water in- 
takes vary in the other Great Lakes. In Lake Ontario, 
alewife, smelt, sculpin, and white perch are the most 
common fishes affected by intakes, with impingement 
kills of adult fish as high as 5 million per year at large 
power plants. We have no estimates of lake wide mor- 
talities of adult or juvenile fishes. The instability of 
Lake Ontario&apos;s fish populations and the projected 
increases in the lake&apos;s water use are of great concern 
to ecologists. 

Lakes Huron and Superior both have low human- 
population densities and low levels of industrialization 
in their watersheds; thus, they have few water intakes. 
Major changes in native fish communities have appar- 
ently been due to invasion by exotic species, overfish- 
ing, and natural habitat alterations. By the year 2000, 
less than 0.5 percent of the inshore waters of these 
lakes will be used by power plants. 

Lake Erie, because of its shallowness, has always 
been atypical and has experienced more rapid changes 
than the other Great Lakes. Recent studies at power 
plants on Lake Erie show high kill rates of yellow 
perch, gizzard shad, white bass, and alewife. An

EPA-sponsored study has estimated that up to 10 
million yellow perch larvae were destroyed yearly by 
one large plant in the western basin of Lake Erie. 

Water intakes damage aquatic organisms in several 
ways. Water and its entrained organisms enter intake 
structures at velocities that vary from less than 0.5 to 
more than 5 feet per second, depending on the intake 
design. Velocity is a critical factor since free-swim- 
ming fish have size-related swim speeds and escape 
potentials; thus, at faster flows, higher numbers and 
larger organisms are overcome and trapped by intakes. 
At most intakes, water is filtered through a wire screen 
with %-inch openings that keep debris from entering 
the pumping system. Large adult fish are impinged on 
the screen, collected, and hauled to disposal sites. 

Smaller organisms, such as plankton and juvenile 
fish, pass through the screen to secondary filters in a 
municipal intake or to the circulating water system and 
condenser tubes in power plants. Circulating water 
pumps create several stresses on organisms — pressure 
changes, cavitation, and shear forces — while impeller 
blades cause direct mechanical damage. In the one-inch 
condenser tubes, water temperature rises as much as 
twenty degrees in a few minutes and the water often 
becomes supersaturated with atmospheric gases. Both 
rapid temperature changes and supersaturation of gases 
can kill organisms. In addition, biocidal chemicals, such 
as chlorine compounds, are injected into the intake 
water to control bacterial slimes. These chemicals are 
toxic to organisms entrained in the water. 

Most Great Lakes power plants pass water through 
a cooling system only one time, then discharge the 
heated water directly into the lake, where it cools. A 
few power plants use closed-cycle cooling devices, 
such as cooling towers, which recirculate the water. 
These devices can substantially reduce the volume of 
intake water and the numbers of entrained organisms. 
Since most water intakes on the Great Lakes have no 
provision for fish to bypass the screens and return to 
the lake, all fish that enter intakes are impinged on the 
screens and killed. Small organisms that pass through 
intake screens coincidentally with biocide treatment 
are also killed. Those that pass through the circulating 
system and condensers have a variable chance of sur- 
vival, but scientists usually assume 100 percent mor- 
tality. All aquatic organisms entering municipal water 
intakes are killed since the entire flow is filtered and 
treated with biocides. 

Power plant intake effects can be mitigated in sev- 
eral ways. One is to reduce the rate of water flow at 
intakes. At some modern power plants, the large vol- 
umes of water used to cool condensers were consid- 



ered necessary to meet water quality standards for 
temperature at discharge. But extensive studies have 
indicated that high discharge temperatures have little 
impact on populations of Great Lakes organisms. If 
intake flow rates are decreased where possible, dis- 
charge temperatures will increase, but the numbers of 
organisms affected will decrease. A reasonable way to 
mitigate total power plant effects on aquatic organisms 
might be to balance the effects of discharge tempera- 
ture against those of flow. 

Cooling towers, ponds, and canals can reduce cool- 
ing water requirements by allowing recirculation of 
cooled water. But these devices have some drawbacks: 
they are expensive to build, their environmental effects 
are not well understood, and there is limited land avail- 
able for the necessary facilities. In addition, cost-bene- 
fit analyses of cooling towers, the most efficient of 
these systems, continue to show alternative methods 
of cooling to be less favorable than the once-through- 
process (on the Great Lakes). Alternatives will com- 
pare more favorably if new impact assessment meth- 
ods project unacceptable (from a social or biological 
standpoint) losses of biota or changes in ecosystem 
function due to once-through cooling. 

Another way to reduce intake effects is to vary in- 
take flows to take advantage of periods of low abun- 
dance in affected organisms. This approach requires 
detailed knowledge of the distribution and life cycles 
of biota and extensive coordination of production 
schedules within the power generation network. 

The problem of fish being impinged on intake 
screens could be reduced through modifications to 
existing intakes and better planning of new facilities. 
Among the schemes that have been tested — with little 
success — are fish repellents and behavioral barriers 
such as electrical and air-bubble screens, and under- 
water sounds and lights. Fish protection devices 
(bypasses, louver systems, and horizontal traveling 
screens) seem to hold promise for returning fish to 
the lake before they are impinged. A third method of 
reducing impingement and entrainment, fine-meshed 
screens, will soon be tested at Great Lakes sites. 

Finally, proper siting of water intakes, based on de- 
tailed knowledge of the distribution of organisms and 
of the performance of different intake designs is a cru- 
cial first step in alleviating the harmful effects of water 
intakes at new power plants. Although the present 
levels of fish and plankton kills through impingement 
and entrainment may not be ecologically significant, 
projections of rapid increases in water use indicate the 
need for new ways to mitigate future ecological effects 
of cooling systems on the Great Lakes. D

The Salmon May Make It 

Hatchery -produced fingerlings thrive and 
grow, but will they ever spawn naturally? 

by Stanford H. Smith 



The catastrophic changes in Great Latces fish stocks 
during the past century illustrate the fragility of fish 
communities in oligotrophic lakes (cool, clear lakes 
rich in dissolved oxygen) aiFected by human population 
growth and technology. The earliest descriptions of the 
Great Lakes reported major spawning runs of sal- 
monines (trout and salmon) and other kinds of fish in 
estuaries and tributaries. But since the mid-nineteenth 
century, one of the two most abundant salmonines, the 
lake trout, was significantly reduced or reached near- 
extinction in various lakes; and the other, the Atlantic 
salmon, became extinct in Lake Ontario by 1890. 

The Atlantic salmon was once the dominant pisci- 
vore in Lake Ontario, but was not found in the other 
lakes because of the upstream barrier of Niagara Falls. 
The lake trout was originally abundant in Lake Ontario 
and was also the climax predator in fish communities 
of the other deepwater lakes — Superior, Michigan, and 
Huron. 

Individually and collectively, four factors disrupted 
the formerly stable and productive fish communities in 
the lakes: intensive exploitation by fishermen; extreme 
modification of drainage basins and tributaries, par- 
ticularly through deforestation; establishment of ma- 
rine species, primarily the alewife and the sea lamprey, 
by invasion or introduction; and cultural eutrophica- 
tion, or progressive physical and chemical modification 
of lake environments. 

The effects of drainage modification that were un- 
favorable for Atlantic salmon permitted establishment 
of the sea lamprey, which in turn was a major factor in 
the severe reduction of lake trout. The natural repro- 
duction of lake trout and other salmonines declined 
drastically in Lake Ontario in recent decades, a period 
of rapid cultural eutrophication. 

The term &quot;cultural eutrophication&quot; includes physi- 
cal and chemical changes, natural and unnatural, which 
occur at much greater than natural rates and result in 
increased plant nutrients and decreased oxygen. Both 
processes contribute to a deterioration of water quality 
in the sense that they are detrimental to the presence 
and productivity of useful aquatic life, including desir- 
able fish, or favor destructive or obnoxious aquatic life. 
The ways in which cultural eutrophication causes the 
decline or disappearance of deepwater fish are poorly 
understood or unknown. Species of fish have, how- 
ever, declined or disappeared in the same sequence in 
different lakes or regions of lakes during periods of ac- 
celerated changes in water quality or temperature — in 
both the presence and absence of commercial fisheries 
and other inimical factors. 

Considering the geographical location of the Great 



Lakes, such declines might be expected. The southern- 
most of the large oligotrophic lakes of the Northern 
Hemisphere, the Great Lakes are at or near the south- 
ern end of the range of many species typical of a cold- 
water environment or of large oligotrophic lakes — 
Atlantic salmon, lake trout, lake whitefish, lake her- 
ring, deepwater cisco, and deepwater sculpin. It 
seems natural that such species would become rare or 
disappear in once oligotrophic bodies of water that now 
have eutrophic chemical and morphometric character- 
istics (Lakes Erie and Saint Clair, and Green and Sagi- 
naw bays) or that remain essentially oligomorphic but 
have eutrophic water quality (Lake Ontario). Signifi- 
cantly, the families or species with a more northerly 
range or those associated with colder water are among 
the first to decline or disappear. The Atlantic salmon, 
until the late nineteenth century the dominant species 
in Lake Ontario, was the first of these. 

The Atlantic salmon was fished intensively in Lake 
Ontario because it was easily taken during spawning 
migrations. Yet it was used less wastefully than other 
fish because of its excellent quality as food and its high 
economic value. The salmon were a primary source of 
protein for the early settlements and military outposts, 
and the value of salmon runs sometimes determined the 
value of land. When the salmon declined about 1850, 
the fishermen, thinking the lake had been fished out, 
moved to other lakes or turned to other professions, 
leaving behind deserted lakefront fishing communities. 
But the fish stocks failed to recover despite strong pro- 
tection and persistent introductions of hatchery fish. 

As the Atlantic salmon disappeared, so did the for- 
ests. The two events probably were closely related. 
The virgin forests were once described as &quot;so thick-set 
with trees and so dense . . . that a savage might skulk

from the Hudson to Lake Erie without exposing him- 
self to the glare of the sun.&quot; But in the early and mid- 
nineteenth century, the forests were cut to clear land 
for agriculture and to provide lumber, fuel, tanners&quot; 
bark, charcoal, and potash for industry. The cutting 
started in the eastern area, and in 1897, one observer 
described the western New York drainage area of Lake 
Ontario as &quot;almost totally deforested.&quot; The drainage 
of swamps for farmland and the construction of dams 
for water-powered mills, together with deforestation, 
turned the &quot;living streams&quot; and rivers, which had 
flowed cold and clear throughout the year, into streams 
with reduced summer flow that was sometimes warm, 
sluggish, or intermittent. Many were severely polluted 
by wastes from the mills. Pollution and reduced flows 
adversely affected most streams where Atlantic salmon 
spawned, but runs of salmon also disappeared in some 
streams unaffected by these factors. One factor that 
affected every stream in the drainage was the increase 
in stream temperature due to the loss of the forest 
cover. 

Studies have demonstrated the importance of water 
temperature in successful reproduction of salmon. Be- 
tween 1944 and 1947, the Province of Ontario con- 
ducted intensive research on Atlantic salmon planted in 
Duffin Creek, a tributary of Lake Ontario that had been 
a good salmon stream in the mid-nineteenth century, 
but where years of introductions had failed to reestab- 
lish a spawning run. This study showed that two major 
causes of mortality were inadequate shelter to protect 
young salmon from predation and high water tempera- 
tures in the lower portions of the stream. &quot;Those 
tributary streams in which lethal summer temperatures 
destroyed the salmon populations . . . lacked any 
appreciable amount of shade, whereas those streams 
with suitable temperatures had a larger proportion of 
shaded sections.&quot; Conditions other than temperature 
and shelter for juvenile salmon were considered &quot;of 
minor or no importance in salmon survival.&quot; 

A 1960s study of salmonid streams in forested and 
deforested areas of Oregon — which is at the same lati- 
tude as the Lake Ontario basin and receives compa- 
rable solar radiation — showed that before the forest 
was cut, stream temperatures for July, August, and 
September averaged 5I.8°F, with a diurnal fluctuation 
of from 47.1° to 56.6°. Following forest removal, the 
average temperature was 59.1°, with a diurnal fluctua- 
tion of from 48.5° to 75°. Juvenile Atlantic salmon, 
which usually spend two years in a stream following 
hatching, have maximum food conversion at about 
53° and have been observed thriving in streams with 
temperatures of about 55°. These temperatures are

within the range for streams in forested areas, but they 
are considerably below the warmer temperatures of 
those streams after forest removal. Thus, unfavorable 
stream temperatures, primarily as a result of forest 
removal, may have been a controlling factor leading to 
the decline and eventual extinction of Atlantic salmon 
in Lake Ontario and, later, may have prevented reestab- 
lishment of the fish in the lake&apos;s drainage basin. 

The loss of the Atlantic salmon and the related envi- 
ronmental modifications were apparently the triggering 
mechanisms for a sequence of changes in fish stocks 
that started in Lake Ontario and spread throughout the 
Great Lakes. The most significant of these events was 
the establishment in the late nineteenth century of 
major populations of alewives and sea lampreys — 
marine species that spawn in streams and spend their 
adult life in the ocean, but which can complete their 
life cycle in the freshwater of the Great Lakes. 

The alewife, the first marine invader to become con- 
spicuously established in Lake Ontario, was described 
as being abundant when it was first observed in 1873. 
Its most probable route from the Atlantic was through 
the Hudson River and the Erie Canal. The alewife 
might have reached Lake Ontario earlier via the Saint 
Lawrence River, but experience in the upper Great 
Lakes has shown that the alewife probably cannot be- 
come established or thrive in the presence of an abun- 
dant large piscivore such as the Atlantic salmon. Thus 
the Atlantic salmon may have been a deterrent to the 
entrance of the alewife via the Saint Lawrence River. 

Alewives apparently negotiated the Erie Canal&apos;s 
locks and spillways with difficulty since not until 1868 
(forty-three years after the canal&apos;s opening) was their 
presence noticed in the Oswego River drainage below 
the Finger Lakes. Even before becoming established in 
the Finger Lakes, some alewives were undoubtedly

moving downstream in the Oswego River into Lake 
Ontario, where they remained unnoticed until 1873. At 
the time of this movement, Atlantic salmon were de- 
creasing rapidly. 

Experience in the other Great Lakes has shown that 
in the absence of a large population of piscivores, ale- 
wives that become established in a large deepwater 
lake can increase rapidly and become the most abun- 
dant species in less than twenty years. When the ale- 
wife overpopulates a lake, major changes occur in the 
growth, condition, and age structure of its population. 
At high population density, the alewife suffers mass 
mortalities from cumulative stresses. 

Food competition appears to be the mechanism by 
which the alewife dominates other species. The ale- 
wife&apos;s ability to reduce or eliminate all large plankton 
from a lake may deprive other, larger species of the 
food necessary for their survival. Among the fish even- 
tually affected by the alewife&apos;s spread west, from Lake 
Ontario through the upper lakes, were the lake herring 
and emerald shiner (shallow-water planktivores), the 
rainbow smelt and yellow perch (facultative plankti- 
vore-piscivores), and the deepwater cisco and deep- 
water sculpin (deepwater planktivores). The deepwater 
fish were prey for the lake trout. 

The most conspicuous change in fish communities of 
the Great Lakes came with the invasion and establish- 
ment of the sea lamprey, which followed the domina- 
tion of Lake Ontario by the alewife. The parasitic sea 
lamprey feeds primarily on large fish, such as the lake 
trout, that live in its preferred deepwater environment. 



The causes of the sea lamprey&apos;s incursion from the 
Atlantic are not yet fully understood. Although a sea 
lamprey was identified in Lake Ontario as early as 
1835, a population of lampreys was not established in 
the lake until the 1880s. Evidence strongly suggests 
that the sea lamprey came into the Lake Ontario drain- 
age basin via the Erie Canal from the Mohawk-Hudson 
River drainage, which enters the Atlantic in a region 
where the species, historically, was very abundant. 
The sea lamprey, like the alewife, was first reported in 
the Finger Lakes, where it was abundant by 1870. The 
lampreys could have progressed upstream through the 
river and canal system either by swimming or by at- 
taching themselves to the hulls and rudders of boats. 
The question is why it took so long for this to take 
place, since the Erie Canal was opened in 1825. 

The sea lamprey&apos;s inability to sustain itself in the 
Lake Ontario drainage basin until the mid-nineteenth 
century, when it became populous in Cayuga Lake, 
may be related to the decline of the Atlantic salmon at 
about the same time. The increased water temperature 
in Lake Ontario&apos;s tributaries caused unfavorable con- 
ditions for the reproduction of Atlantic salmon, but it 
could have created favorable conditions for the repro- 
duction of the sea lamprey. To reproduce successfully. 
Atlantic salmon require cold stream conditions; 
warmer stream conditions are required to stimulate sea 
lamprey spawning migrations and to produce condi- 
tions that result in successful development of eggs. 

We know through recent experience with sea lam- 
preys that there is a critical relationship between tem- 
perature and reproductive cycle. Sea lampreys usually 
enter spawning streams warmer than 40°F; their 
spawning migration is stimulated by temperatures be- 
tween 50° and 65°, and spawning itself is stimulated by 
temperatures between 52° and 75°. Peak spawning ac- 
tivity usually occurs in water with a temperature of 
about 60°, almost 5° above the ideal water temperature 
for Atlantic salmon. Laboratory studies using constant 
temperatures show that nearly all successful hatching 
of sea lampreys occurs in the narrow temperature 
range between 60° to 70°, with high survival of eggs to 
hatching limited to an interval of two or three degrees 
in the middle of this range. Under the fluctuating tem- 
peratures of natural stream conditions, hatching suc- 
cess ranges from 0.4 to 7.8 percent, which is consid- 
erably below the survival rate of 78 percent that can be 
obtained in laboratory conditions. 

Studies of lakes in the Oswego River drainage basin 
confirm that sea lamprey reproduction is correlated 
with water temperature. Lakes with thriving lamprey 
populations have streams with temperatures in the 60°

to 70° range. Lakes without lampreys have tributaries 
whose temperatures are well below that range during 
the sea lamprey reproductive period in the spring and 
early summer. In addition, evidence indicates that if a 
lamprey does not spawn in one stream because the 
water is too cold, it will not spawn in another stream 
that it might move to, even if the water in the new 
stream is of the right temperature. So there is much evi- 
dence to support the assumption that deforestation and 
the resultant change in stream conditions were the 
dominant factors facilitating the invasion and establish- 
ment of the sea lamprey and, concurrently, contribut- 
ing to the extinction of the Atlantic salmon and the pro- 
liferation of the alewife. 

Once established in Lake Ontario, the sea lamprey 
and the alewife were able to reach the upper Great 
Lakes by moving through the Welland Canal, which 
bypasses Niagara Falls between Lakes Ontario and 
Erie. In the upper Great Lakes the lamprey caused a 
decline of lake trout as drastic as that of the Atlantic 
salmon in Lake Ontario. Because the lamprey did not 
become established in Lake Ontario until after the fish- 
eries had declined and fishermen had moved to other 
lakes, the seriousness of its threat did not cause alarm. 
Research needed by fishery managers to stem or coun- 
teract effects of the sea lamprey was not initiated until 
1946 — more than eighty years after the invasion from 
the Atlantic and more than fifty years after problems 
caused by the lamprey on the Great Lakes had been 
recognized in the Finger Lakes and Lake Ontario. 

That research led to the development of a selective 
toxicant that would kill young lampreys in the spawn- 
ing streams but, when carefully applied, would have 
little or no adverse effect on other species. Between 
1958 and 1972, all known lamprey-producing tributaries 
of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Ontario were

treated with the larvicide TFM (3-trifluoromethyl-4- 
nitrophenol). 

The adult lamprey population was reduced to 20 per- 
cent of peak abundance after all streams of Lake Supe- 
rior had been treated once with TFM, and to less than 
10 percent after the streams had been treated twice. By 
the late 1960s, the lake trout had attained or surpassed 
prelamprey abundance in areas of intensive stocking. 
Conditions are still in a state of flux, but the sea lam- 
prey population, which persists under present control 
technology, continues to cause substantial lake trout 
mortality. Indications are that even with sea lamprey 
control, the lake trout population would collapse if lake 
trout stocking were ended. 

Sea lamprey control and lake stocking have, in com- 
bination, made conditions more favorable for the sea 
lamprey by doing for it what many humans would 
like to have done for themselves. These programs have 
created a controlled, uncrowded population of lam- 
preys with plenty of freedom and an abundance of 
food for all. Under control, the lampreys have all the 
favorable conditions that fostered their initial popula- 
tion explosion, and in addition, they have recovered 
from the stresses that accompanied peak population 
density. Compared with the time of maximum popula- 
tion density of lampreys in Lake Superior, the less 
dense populations of lamprey ammocoetes (larvae) in 
streams are growing faster and are younger and larger 
when they transform into adults. The adult lampreys 
are also growing more rapidly and maturing at a larger 
size. The larger adult females produce more eggs, and 
the proportion of females in spawning runs has reached 
about 80 percent, compared with about 30 percent at 
peak abundance. These conditions suggest that sur- 
vival of larval and adult sea lampreys has improved and 
that reproductive capability has increased. Control has 
been intensified in recent years to counter the more 
favorable conditions for sea lampreys, and to keep 
their &quot;controlled&quot; level low enough to maintain favor- 
able conditions for stocking and maintaining large 
populations of lake trout and other salmonines. 

In recent decades, cultural eutrophication has be- 
come an added factor that has limited natural popula- 
tions of lake trout, which have become less abundant 
or have disappeared in such greatly enriched areas as 
the southern portions of Green and Saginaw bays and 
all of Lakes Erie and Ontario. Apparently, natural lake 
trout reproduction ended in Lake Ontario about 1950 
and naturally produced lake trout were virtually extinct 
by 1960. This disappearance could not be attributed to 
the sea lamprey, which had been well established for 
the preceding eighty years. Lake trout persisted and

even became quite abundant during the period between 
1910 and 1930, when lampreys were common. Also, 
commercial and recreational fishing were greatly re- 
duced or absent, particularly in the deeper areas where 
trout lived. Other deepwater species, such as the deep- 
water Cisco, lake herring, and deepwater sculpin, also 
became extinct or nearly so after lake trout declined. 

These species are characteristically found in oligo- 
trophic lakes, but apparently Lake Ontario, as well as 
other lakes where they disappeared, became so en- 
riched through cultural eutrophication that reproduc- 
tion was inhibited. The enriched lake environment, 
however, still seems to be satisfactory for adult lake 
trout and other salmonines, which can be raised in 
hatcheries and released as juveniles. 

In both highly enriched and little enriched areas, the 
introduction of hatchery-reared Pacific salmon and 
lake trout has been very successful following sea lam- 
prey control. Recent introductions of Atlantic salmon, 
however, have not been similarly successful, indicat- 
ing that some factors of the lake environment may be 
inimical for their adult life in the Great Lakes today. In 
the absence of adequate natural reproduction, artificial 
propagation apparently makes it possible to maintain 
thriving populations of lake trout and some other spe- 
cies of salmonines, such as coho and chinook salmon, 
rainbow-steelhead trout, and brook and brown trout, 
under present lake conditions, provided sea lamprey 
abundance is simultaneously controlled. 

The only salmonine that seems to be thriving through 
natural reproduction is the small pink salmon, which 
was unintentionally introduced into Lake Superior in 
1956. The pink salmon has now established substantial 
spawning runs in all regions of Lake Superior and is 
spreading into Lakes Michigan and Huron. It is still 
uncertain if this fish will be able to pass through the 
rich, shallow waters of Lake Erie, which is not ideal 
salmonine environment, and to reproduce and thrive in 
the enriched waters of Lake Ontario. 

Apparently, an abundance of salmonines can be 
maintained in the presence of the sea lamprey if ad- 
vanced cultural eutrophication does not cause water 
quality to become less favorable. This represents only 
partial restoration of the fishery productivity of the 
Great Lakes, however, because species such as the 
deepwater cisco, lake herring, and deepwater sculpin, 
which once constituted some 80 to 90 percent of the 
pounds of fish in the Great Lakes, cannot be mass- 
produced by known hatchery techniques and will con- 
tinue to remain at low abundance or absent in many 
areas until the restoration of water quality that will per- 
mit them to reproduce and thrive. D

&quot;You&apos;ll Always Get Home&quot; 

Until recently, families with inherited knowledge 
offish behavior dominated Great Lakes fishing 

by Russell McKee 



In one way, the commercial fisheries on the Great 
Lakes have changed very Mttle over the past century. 
The tonnages of fish taken from the lakes by commer- 
cial fishermen one hundred years ago, fifty years ago, 
and today are almost identical, with an average catch 
over the century of 1 13 million pounds per year. In only 
twelve of those years has the annual average fallen 
below 100 million pounds. That remarkably stable rec- 
ord was brought about by tough, knowledgeable, often 
fractious fishermen who, if not among our earliest nat- 
uralists, have long been an important natural element 
of the Great Lakes ecosystem. Although their numbers 
are dwindling, their importance continues. 

The record does not show how many were actively 
fishing a century ago, but by 1900 the total was esti- 
mated at about 6,000 fishermen on the United States 
sideof the lakes. In 1917, the number peaked at 10,000, 
then began a slow but steady decline. It was never that 
high on the Canadian side and has declined there as 
well. Today the total stands at only about 2,000, divided 
almost equally between the United States and Canada. 

Commercial fishermen of the Great Lakes today or, 
for that matter, of the past are difficult to typify. Yet 
they have common backgrounds and bonds that place 
them as a group among our most aware and well- 
informed users of the outdoors. This does not mean 
that they do not have blind spots or failings, that they 
have been completely virtuous in their use of the fishery 
or that they are necessarily better protectors of the 
environment than others. But they experience so much 
of the natural world in their daily work that they hold as 
common what most people today may never learn in a 
lifetime of outdoor search. 

Present-day fishermen are, almost to a man, de- 
scendants of commercial fishermen whose fathers were 
also descendants of fishermen. In the years following 
the Civil War, cities rose in the Great Lakes region, 
built largely of pine and hardwoods cut from the vast 
forests of the area. The lakes were the highway for 
shipment of this lumber, and the shorelines were the 
natural sites for the cities then being built. Commercial 
fishermen thrived because the development of many 
small ports and several large cities around the lakes 
gave them both a base of operations and hungry mar- 
kets to supply. In the upper lakes region, for example, 
where agriculture provided only thin subsistence, log- 
ging camps and lumber towns needed a daily source of 
protein, which commercial fishermen were able to sup- 
ply. Iron and copper miners around the west end of 
Lake Superior also needed fish, as did the booming 
cities of Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, Cleveland, 
Buffalo, and Toronto. 

A nineteenth-century lake trout catch

By the turn of the century, the fishing industry had 
become well established as a group of small, family 
enterprises. Typical upper lakes ports might support 
half a dozen fishing families, and because these were 
mostly small towns (and remain so today), the fisher- 
men of each community knew each other well. Thus, 
while they competed for fish on the lakes and for 
markets on shore, they also had to live together, which 
produced what might be described as an extended 
family held together by a mutually competitive spirit 
and daily use of a common marketplace and a common 
fishing ground. Consequently, once commercial fishing 
became established, it also became a very stable social 
institution. In this small town push and shove, nobody 
got rich, but fishing families thrived, outsiders were 
kept out, and gaining the respect of other fishermen was 
a goal worthy of a life&apos;s work. 

A member of such a clan had to have a wide range of 
practical knowledge and skills. He had to be skilled in 
the construction, handling, management, and repair of 
boats. He had to know his lake intimately. He had to be 
a storekeeper, salesman, and market manager. And he 
had to be a weatherman. Fogs, blizzards, and ice 
storms sweep off the shores and across these lakes 
with blinding speed, and someone preoccupied with 
lifting nets or untangling lines can suddenly find him- 
self locked in a small, white, very angry room. At that 
point the brainpan must call forth from memory a highly 
detailed chart of the entire area surrounding the boat, 
including islands, shoals, channels, and the nearest 
safe haven. 

One fisherman from Saginaw Bay recalled a story 
about an old-timer, a one-armed fisherman named 
Harvey Dutcher, who took a gathering of local young- 
sters on his small, sail-powered fishing boat one Fourth 
of July and dropped them on an island a dozen miles 
out in the bay. They would have a picnic while he 
fished, and he would pick them up on his return. But in 
the afternoon a storm came up and fog blanketed the 
bay. Soon, worried parents gathered at the dock, where 
visibility was zero. The world around them was noth- 
ing but howling white walls. Darkness fell and anxiety 
rose. Toward nine that evening the wind dropped, but 
seas in that dishpan bay remained violent. Suddenly, 
near midnight, without sound or warning, Dutcher&apos; s 
little vessel, loaded with kids and tugged along by one 
small sail, eased out of the fog and snuggled up next to 
the pier. A collective sigh of relief rose from the par- 
ents, but Dutcher himself shrugged off his pinpoint 
landing as routine. &quot;Jest listen to the shore sounds,&quot; 
he said, &quot;and watch the water under you. Hell, that 
ain&apos;t much to do. You&apos;ll always get home.&quot;

family (Peter is second from

Others haven&apos;t been so aware or, in many cases, so 
lucky. A single storm in 1913 swallowed seventy-one 
Great Lakes ships, including nine 500-footers. Nearly 
three hundred lives were lost in that storm. Dozens of 
ore boats and cargo vessels have been lost over the 
years, while countless small craft of the size used by 
commercial fishermen have simply disappeared. Most 
fishermen working today can tell of at least one relative 
taken by the lakes. They have all had boats smashed, 
nets swept away, docks and fish houses torn up or 
bowled over. Those who survive were born with — or 
developed — wits enough to ride these waters with a 
deep and abiding respect. 

Above all else, the successful fisherman knows how 
the fish think, where they travel, where they lurk in 
schools, when they might be likely to rise from twenty 
fathoms to fifteen. That may not seem much of a dif- 
ference, but it is enough to bankrupt a man if he 
doesn&apos;t know the answer. 

&quot;Somehow those old-timers can always tell where 
the fish are going to be,&quot; says Ken Loftus, a fisheries 
director for Ontario&apos;s provincial government. &quot;It&apos;s 
often difficult for them to tell you how they know, but 
dammit they know. There are a lot of wise old dogs out 
there.&quot; 

In short, like the medieval guildsman, the Great 
Lakes fisherman has secret knowledge. He holds a 
bounty of natural wisdom locked in his head, some 
passed on from his father, some drawn from even 
earlier generations. By contrast, anyone who ever 
came to this business with no background did so at a 
severe and dangerous disadvantage. Fish are a cash 
crop and fishermen must live on their daily income, so 
an outsider who does not know the territory or the fish 
could starve before he is well started in the business. 
All of which produces in the survivors a central vein 
of blunt practicality and an absolutely undentable core 
of personal independence. 

This practicality shows up in the boats these men 
designed for their work. Virtually all these boats are 
different, yet most are much alike in their appearance. 
And nothing beats a 1930s Great Lakes gill net fish tug 
for ugliness. They look like 39-foot outhouses plunked 
down lopsided on 40-foot dishpans. They perch so high 
on the water you expect them to turn turtle at the first 
puff of wind. Their small, beady-eyed windows look out 
suspiciously on the lakes, as though glaring at ancient 
enemies. As a class, they have gathered more scales 
over the years than all the fish they seek. When painted, 
which is seldom, the color is inevitably a gray not found 
on any color chart; when repaired, which is often, the 
standard materials are pie tins and tar or tar paper and 



91 



roofing nails or window glass and plywood. And they 
are durable. 

But looks are one thing and work is another. For 
use in commercial fishing, these tough little boats 
incorporate a full range of practical virtues. Although 
perched high on the water, they are amazingly stable 
craft. Sleet and snow cannot ice the nets stored inside. 
A five-ton following sea slapping that blunt stern simply 
means a faster passage home. The small windows and 
durable materials are inexpensive and long lasting. And 
no fisherman was ever expected to love his boat for its 
looks. What he designed and built was what he needed 
for his work, and it is a tribute to the canny ways of his 
forebears that the design of the twenties and thirties is 
still used in the few steel tugs now being built. 

But the old guard of fishermen is thinning out, and 
few new recruits are coming into the business. Thirty- 
five years ago. Bob Lang started a wholesale operation 
at Hancock, Michigan, called Lake Superior Fisheries. 
I asked him how many fishermen in his area had learned 
the business from their fathers. &quot;Every one of them,&quot; 
he said without hesitation. 

&quot;And how many have sons working now to take over 
those businesses?&quot; 

&quot;Not one. Not a one. Zero. Back when I started 
here in 1943, there were five wholesalers and more 
than twenty fishermen working this end of Lake Supe- 
rior. Everybody had sons in the business then. Today 
Fm the last wholesaler and we&apos;re down to ten fisher- 
men. Most of them are getting on in years, and not one 
has a son working on the boats. Things don&apos;t look too 
good for the future, what with pesticides and mercury 
keeping fish off the market, and all the kids going oflF to 
college or taking good-paying jobs in the city. And 
government restrictions are cutting the daily hauls in 
favor of sport fishing. Maybe things will pick up, but 
it doesn&apos;t look too good right now.&quot; 

Roy Jensen, at Escanaba on northern Lake Michi- 
gan, takes a more optimistic view. His grandfather 
Jensen and an uncle named Hansen came from Den- 
mark in the 1890s and started a fish business at Esca- 
naba. Roy&apos;s father entered the business soon after the 
turn of the century, and Roy himself began on the boats 
as a youngster in 1931. Then the company converted 
to wholesaling fish caught by other fishermen, and for 
a long time Hansen and Jensen was one of the major 
Great Lakes contributors to the Chicago. Detroit, and 
eastern United States markets. Last year, Roy and his 
wife, Feryne, closed the company and retired. There 
was no one to take it over, and restrictions on fishing 
were too severe to continue. But he feels that times 
will change and that the present decline in fishing activ-

ity means fish stocks are building steadily in tfie latces. 
&quot;There are some young fishermen coming into the 
business,&quot; he says. &quot;If they can get started, they&apos;ll be 
able to make a good living. 1 think better days are 
coming.&quot; 

Leonard Dutcher, at Point Detour on northern Lake 
Huron, is another fisherman with deep roots in the 
industry. He says he recently found a family tree that 
traces his Great Lakes ancestry back seven genera- 
tions to the late eighteenth century. &quot;They were all 
fishermen.&quot; he says, &quot;every one of them. Lve fished 
since 1 was sixteen years old. when my grandfather 
Peter Dutcher had the company. My dad, Clarence, 
eventually bought out my grandfather, and then I 
bought the company from my father in 1963.&quot; 

Leonard, however, does not have a son to take over 
after he retires. &quot;I&apos;m out on the lake at least four days 
a week, and we&apos;re probably the oldest family setting 
trap nets on the entire Great Lakes system. I know my 
family may not continue with the business here, but 1 
think things are going to pick up for others. The lakes 
need commercial fishermen. Sport fishermen can&apos;t take 
nearly enough fish to keep the harvest up where it 
should be. And we need those fish as a food source, so 



I think fishing&apos;s going to improve some time soon.&quot; 
Maybe so. Maybe there will be a rebirth of fishing 
activity when the alphabet soup of chemical pollutants 
clears from these waters and research leads us to better 
harvesting methods. But even if that happens, the fish- 
ermen of the future are clearly going to be a far differ- 
ent breed from the 2,000 old-timers now spinning out 
their destinies on the lakes. The new wave of fisher- 
men won&apos;t come from the old families because the old 
families are dying out or drifting off. They will find 
their hauls with electronic fish finders and will have no 
need to memorize every hump and hummock of the 
lake bottoms over which they travel. Radar will protect 
them from ore boats in the fog, and Loran will lead 
them electronically to safe harbors. Their boats will 
carry corporate names, and crews will be unionized. 
They&apos;ll work for weekly salaries and get computer- 
printed paychecks. Boards of directors will sit at pol- 
ished mahogany tables and decide where and when 
and how much each boat will work and produce. There 
will be profits, of course, from start to finish, and 
hardly anyone will ever notice that there have also 
been some losses. Not important, just 2,000 names 
gone from lakes surrounded by millions of people. D

The Computerized Ecosystem 

The widely misunderstood tool of mathematical modeling 
helps ecologists answer many questions about the lakes 

by Wayland R. Swain 



Several years ago, a group of scientists associated 
with the Environmental Protection Agency prepared a 
mathematical model of Lake Erie. The model was de- 
signed to predict the extent of anoxia (oxygen dep- 
rivation) in the lake as a result of increased nutrient 
loads from sewage treatment plants, factories, the 
atmosphere, and farms. For a number of years, sci- 
entists had been concerned with the accelerated rate 
of eutrophication of Lake Erie brought about by the 
discharge of the wastes of human activity. Lake Erie 
had become so highly productive of undesirable nui- 
sance algae and so depleted of oxygen in its lower 
layers that the popular press was moved to report 
that the lake was dying. 

The modelers considered many agents and processes 
in their mathematical simulation of how the lake eco- 
system worked. Through a complex series of equa- 
tions, they were able to mimic in a computer the sea- 
sonal cycle of the lake. 

Use of the model simulating Lake Erie&apos;s aging proc- 
ess suggested that the size of the area of anoxia ap- 
peared to be related directly to the extent of nutrient 
loading into the lake. But in 1975 the anoxic area was 
found to be markedly smaller than predicted by the 
model. To all appearances, the efforts of ecologists 
and environmentalists were having a major effect, 
even though the model suggested that the lake&apos;s im- 
provement was so rapid and drastic as to be unbe- 
lievable. The press now began to herald the &quot;rebirth&quot; 
of Lake Erie, and some scientists grudgingly admitted 
that the lake apparently was improving, despite what 
the model had predicted. 

As public awareness heightened, pressure for com- 
plete answers to the question of the vitality of Lake 
Erie grew. When Great Lakes modelers examined 
1975 inputs, they discovered that nutrient loadings 
were similar to those of previous years and that, with 
a single exception, all important variables had re- 
mained significantly unchanged. 

The single altered variable was temperature. Spring 
arrived much earlier in 1975 than it had in previous 
years and without the fresh winds that usually accom- 
pany its coming. As a result of the early rapid warm- 
ing and minimal mixing, only a small portion of the 
lake&apos;s water made up the warmer surface layer that 
floats in the cold, deep water. The greatly increased 
fraction of deep water was freshly charged with oxygen 
after the recent spring overturn, in which the entire 
lake was mixed. Consequently, in 1975 a vastly in- 
creased amount of oxygen was available to satisfy the 
needs of respiring algae, decomposing plant matter, 
and the sediment. The excess of oxygen in deep waters 



gave an impression of a vast improvement in the 
amount of available oxygen in the entire lake, which in 
turn suggested that the lake had improved consider- 
ably over previous years. Ultimate confirmation of the 
interpretation of the 1975 &quot;recovery&quot; of Lake Erie 
as a result of an anomaly in climate was achieved in 
1976 and 1977, when spring came at its normal time, 
more water was warmed, and Lake Erie returned to its 
usual state of widespread anoxia. 

The cause of this apparent, short-lived improvement 
in Lake Erie&apos;s condition would probably still not be 
understood if the tool of mathematical modeling of 
environmental simulation had not been available. Yet, 
despite its merits, no other scientific technique may 
be as widely misunderstood by both scientist and lay- 
person as is this one. 

Much of the problem seems to lie in the absence of a 
common language about modeling. Since the language 
of mathematical simulation is unknown to the general 
public, to many managers, and even to a good propor- 
tion of the scientific community, the subject seems to 
generate feelings of apprehension and distrust. 

The language that we have shared since childhood 
suggests that a model is a physical reality, a represen- 
tation (usually in miniature) of an object. Often, this 
representation shows the construction, or is a copy, of 
the original. But while most of us can understand that 
meaning of &quot;model,&quot; very few of us have been ex- 
posed to the concept of numerical simulation and the 
function it is intended to perform. 

Reduced to its essence, a mathematical model is 
more than a simple organization of coefficients, equa- 
tions, and computer programs — although those are the 
ways in which the measurements in the model are 
expressed and calculated. A model is a dynamic con- 
ceptual framework, a continually growing numerical 
idea, and if you will, a vision of the future. The en- 
vironmental modeler conceptualizes a mathematical 
scheme in which he is able to measure existing states 
of the environment, to evaluate how those states are 
interrelated in the ecosystem, and to look forward in 
time and envision the state of the environment for 
future generations. 

Just as human perception grows with the acquisition 
of increasingly more information, ecological modeling 
is a dynamic process. A scientist defines quantities of 
substances, events, and creatures in numerical short- 
hand (for ease of understanding). The modeler working 
with the Great Lakes system must develop a wide 
understanding of many disciplines in order to concep- 
tualize the major processes at work. Because these 
processes are so tightly interwoven with living systems 



95 



(and because of the enormity of space and time scales), 
simple empirical and intuitive approaches are not ade- 
quate. The analytic approach must be iterative, grow- 
ing, and dynamic if it is to include large amounts of 
new information. 

A typical modeling program might begin in the Great 
Lakes with the simplest of all approaches — the mass 
balance model. &quot;Everything has to go somewhere,&quot; 
say the laws of conservation of energy and matter. The 
mass balance model is meant to define the manner in 
which a given amount of a substance goes from one 
place to another or from one physical or chemical state 
to another. This model can be used to analyze the 
change in concentration of a Great Lakes pollutant 
over time by considering ( I ) the amount of the pollutant 
added to the system from all sources; (2) the residence 
time of the water in the system; (3) the length of time 
the pollutant remains in the water; (4) the internal loss 
rate of the pollutant to the sediment and to organisms; 
and (5) the rate at which the pollutant is swept out of 
the lakes. The lakes may be regarded as a single, con- 
tinuously stirred system, or they may be broken up into 
subdivisions either by area or by depth. Even the sim- 
plest models quickly develop an insatiable appetite 
for data, and additional information can expand the 
horizons and refinement of the model. As the con- 
ceptual system of the model becomes more compli- 
cated, the amount of data and number of solutions in- 
crease rapidly. In the larger environmental models, 
which relate many complex ecological events, a com- 
puter often must solve simultaneous algebraic equa- 
tions for several hundred unknown entities. 

Before a model can be used for prediction, two final 



steps — calibration and verification — must be per- 
formed. Calibration involves comparing measured 
data with calculated model results, then making ad- 
justments in the model until the measured and cal- 
culated data match. Scientists then verify the model by 
matching calculated values with a set of independent 
data that were not used to develop the model. Once 
calibrated and verified, the model may be used to 
simulate the impacts of various alterations in the eco- 
system and to anticipate outcomes. 

In the future. Great Lakes modeling and simulation 
efforts can be expected to provide answers to prob- 
lems that cannot be effectively attacked in a more 
traditional way. One of these areas of current scientific 
concern is that of such toxic and carcinogenic mate- 
rials as pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, plasti- 
cizing compounds, and polynuclear hydrocarbons. 

Among the questions that mathematical modeling 
should be able to answer are. What are the origins of 
these materials? How do they affect the ecosystem? 
What is their fate? How do they affect the food chain? 
If banned immediately, how long will they persist? 

If one takes into account the many effects of stratifica- 
tion and other aspects of the seasonal cycle, retention 
time for water and pollutants in these huge inland seas 
varies from three (for Lake Erie) to five centuries (for 
Lake Superior). Thus, management of toxins and 
pollutants concerns the distant future as much as it does 
tomorrow. The answers to these and other questions 
about the lakes, when provided by mathematical 
models of the environment, can supply managers with 
the information necessary to adopt effective control 
policies. D

IF YOU&apos;RE GOING TO BUY AN 

EASY-TO-USE CAMERA, MAKE SURE 

ITS REALLY EASY TO USE. 



Like many of the new. compact 35mm reflex 
cameras, the l\/linolta XG-7 is automatic You 
simply point, focus and shoot. The XG-7 sets 
the shutter speed up to 1 /1000th of a sec- 
ond. And you get perfectly exposed pic- 
tures, automatically. 

But easy operation is more than just auto- 
matic exposure. Here&apos;s what to look for 
when you compare cameras at your photo 
dealer 

Easy focusing. The XG-7&apos;s viewfinder is 
big and bright, even in the corners Your 
subject snaps into critical sharpness. 

It&apos;s easy to be creative. You can make the 
automatic exposure setting brighter or 
darker for creative effects. 

An easy-to-understand electronic view- 
finder. Light emitting diodes tell how the 
XG-7 is setting itself and warn against under- 
or over-exposure 

An easy-to-see electronic sell-timer. The 
self-timer lets you get into your own pic- 



tures It&apos;s a large flashing light mounted on 
the front of the camera. The flashing speeds 
up when the picture is about to be taken. 
An easier-to-use auto winder. It automati- 
cally advances film, 
as fast as two pic- 
tures a second You 
attach the optional 
Auto Winder G with- 
out havmg to remove 
(or lose) any caps 
from the XG-7 

The easier-to-be- 
creative flash. The 
optional Minolta Auto 
Electroflash 200X 
synchronizes contin- 
uously with the 
winder. This feature 
allows you to take a sequence of up to 36 
flash pictures in about 18 seconds. 
The important &quot;little&quot; extras. The XG-7 




has a window that shows when film is ad- 
vancing properly. A memo holder holds the 
end of a film box as a reminder. There&apos;s even 
an optional remote control cord. 

Fast, easy handling. The way a camera 
feels has a lot to do with how easy it is to use. 
Is it comfortable or awkward? Are the con- 
trols placed where your fingers naturally fall, 
or are they cramped together&apos;&apos; The tvlinolta

WIINIVERS OF THE 

1978 

IVATURAL HISTORY 

PHOTOGRAPHIC 

COMPETITION 



In her best-selling book On Photography. Susan 
Sontag notes that &quot;photography entered the scene as 
an upstart activity, which seemed to encroach on and 
diminish an accredited art: painting.&quot; She says that 
Baudelaire, the French poet of the mid-nineteenth 
century, called photography painting&apos;s &quot;mortal 
enemy.&quot; Although one winner in the 1978 Natural 
History Photographic Competition does take photo- 
graphs that he consults when painting, most photog- 
raphers, like most artists nowadays, worry less about 
producing a faithful replica of a subject than about im- 
posing their own standards upon it. Photographs illus- 
trate their takers&apos; precise views about light, texture, 
shadow, color, and form. 

Americans, perennial travelers who left their roots 
elsewhere, are particularly enthusiastic about photog- 
raphy. It has been one way to grasp the spread of a new 
continent. &quot;You take a camera in your hands,&quot; said 
one entrant, &quot;and you start to see pictures every- 
where.&quot; Perhaps this is why so many of 1978&apos;s winners 
are professional photographers or use cameras as tools 
in their daily work. Some had to travel far to find beau- 
tiful images; others found that pictures came to them 
between nine and five. 

The three judges who selected this year&apos;s winners — 
from 400 slides and prints culled from approximately 
40,000 entries — professed astonishment at their awe- 
some power to award the Grand Prize that would send 
the winner all the way to Egypt from his Minnesota 
home. The 1978 judges were: Gene Thornton, con- 
tributing editor of A/7 News and photography critic for 
the New York Times, who is writing an introductory 



history of photography: Arthur Rothstein, one of the 
first photographers for the Farm Security Administra- 
tion, director of photography for Look magazine, and 
now director of photography for Parade, a color sup- 
plement to 125 newspapers; and Cornell Capa, direc- 
tor of the International Center of Photography. 

The judges agreed that Frederick J. Thompson de- 
served the Grand Prize for the dramatic story told 
in his sequence of photographs of the Rice Lake forest 
fire. In September 1976, Thompson was on a three- 
day solo canoe trip on the Isabella River, in the Bound- 
ary Waters Canoe Area of northern Minnesota&apos;s 
woods. Since he produces educational visual material, 
largely concerned with ecology and local history, 
Thompson had his camera with him. &quot;I was on my 
return trip after having fought another forest fire 
about seventy-five miles north of this one. When I 
spotted a wisp of smoke I was livid, thinking that it 
was someone&apos;s campfire. There was a burning ban 
on; the woods were tinder dry. In 1976, a terribly dry 
year, forest fires occurred almost weekly for a while. 

&quot;The Rice Lake fire was a sleeper, started by light- 
ning but smoldering for several days before blowing 
up. Within a half hour after I spotted it, the fire was 
crowning in the tree tops. I felt totally helpless; I was 
at least five hours of paddling from my van. And while 
I knew that the Boundary Waters Canoe Area is a fire- 
regenerative system, I was horrified to think that the 
fire would burn to the Isabella River and destroy a 
place that I had come to love.&quot; 

When Thompson returned the following spring, 
however, he was able to photograph a reasonably

happy conclusion to the story: by burning off the land, 
the Rice Lake fire had destroyed life, but had also 
brought it back to the woods. 

Another view of the American north woods came to 
Steven Benson during an ice-fishing trip on Anchor 
Bay, Lake Saint Clair, Michigan. One overcast day, he 
photographed three fishers using a plastic sheet as a 
windbreak. Benson thought that his image of the three 
staring in silent concentration at a small hole had less 
to do with ice fishing than with &quot;an existential sensibil- 
ity.&quot; Isolated by their plastic sheet from their sur- 
roundings and from Benson&apos;s camera, &quot;all three men 
seem to share the same fate.&quot; Benson&apos;s use of stark 
black-and-white film contributes to, and points up, 
his fishermen&apos;s icy loneliness. 

Barbara Doran took this year&apos;s only other prize- 
winning black-and-white photograph in the Denver 
airport over Thanksgiving, when she had three 
hours to kill before catching a plane. Her solution was 
to watch others absorbed in pay TV. In the man-made 
environment of Denver&apos;s airport, Doran found an 
image that she related to nocturnal woodlands in other 
parts of Colorado. &quot;Each person was initially drawn to 
the TV as helplessly as deer are mesmerized by car 
headlights. The entire time I watched, the overweight 
girl sat in the same slouched position, never stirring, 
eyes fixed on the side of the TV that I couldn&apos;t see.&quot; 

Charlie E. Rogers, an entomologist specializing in 
the biology of pests, was traveling for his work when 
he photographed a classic Kansas image — fields of 
sunflowers grown for vegetable oil. Back home in 
Texas, Rogers had been working on developing a breed 
of sunflower that would resist the sunflower moth and 
other insects that cause diseases. 

Three other scientific researchers also took prize- 
winning photographs in the regular course of their in- 
vestigations. Biologist Jim Breeding says he&apos;ll &quot;take a 
picture of anything,&quot; but his photomicrograph of a 
cross section of a kitten&apos;s muscles associated with the 
femur required considerable slide preparation and 
planning. This kind of photography permits Breeding 
to combine &quot;three personal fascinations&quot;: the micro- 
scope&apos;s ability to reveal the body&apos;s hidden workings; 
the use of dyes to demonstrate a physical structure&apos;s 
biochemical functions; and finally, the camera&apos;s abil- 
ity &quot;to probe, capture, and relate color, function, and 
design.&quot; 

Joan Hudson and Gerald Carner, research technolo- 
gist in the electron microscope facility and associate

professor of entomology at Clemson University in 
South Carolina, respectively, have been experiment- 
ing with a new technique for photographing live spe- 
cies. Garner had a colony of aphids that he was using 
in research on the transmission of virus diseases. Hud- 
son used the vacuum within the electron microscope&apos;s 
chamber to immobilize a green peach aphid nymph on 
a mustard leaf and operated the microscope at low 
voltage to avoid damaging the insect. 

Like Joan Hudson, Kjell Sandved, a Norwegian 
photographer who came to work at the Smithsonian 
Institution eighteen years ago, likes to study life in 
miniature. He is known for his nature photography 
and his documentaries of small creatures — notably the 
film Curious Creatures and Mini-monsters. But this is 
the first time that he has entered a photography con- 
test. He crept out on a tree branch to photograph his 
&quot;cow-faced&quot; orchid, which he found near the Amazon 
River in Brazil, where high humidity fosters a wide 
variety of insects and orchids. 

At the opposite end of the world, in Alaska, Tom 
Bean works for the National Parks Service as a sea- 
sonal naturalist at Glacier Bay National Monument, an 
area of protected inland waterways. Last summer. 
Bean and a friend did some kayaking in the bay and 
came upon three humpback whales feeding. When 
these whales surface, they take a breath before sound- 
ing, or making a deep dive, and as they dive, their tails 
rise at the last moment. &quot;We paddled out amongst the 
whales, so close that mist from their breath fogged up 
my lens. Because visibility was very poor, we worried 
that the whales would come up under us and capsize

the kayak. But they paid us no attention, probably be- 
cause they have acute hearing and we beat our pad- 
dles against the kayak to warn them we were there.&quot; 
Americans have used their wanderings as a means 
of collecting photographs. Sometimes the search does 
not have to lead many miles. Kingdon Lane, who de- 
signs photographic and electronic equipment, found 
his two owls — &quot;I was lucky to get one behind the 
other&quot; — on a trip to New York&apos;s Staten Island Zoo. 
Giles Gates specializes in photographing animals, but 
&quot;since nature photographs don&apos;t always sell, I do some 
carpentry as well. I was doing some photo work on 
ground squirrels and cactus wrens at the Maricopa 
County Zoo in Phoenix, Arizona, and as 1 passed the 
small flamingo pond, I noticed the form and color of 



one resting bird.&quot; At the San Diego Zoo, Forrest G. 
Moyer, a pediatrician who often uses photography to 
record medical histories, found his orangutan perched 
&quot;on the highest point of his enclosure, snoozing in the 
sun and viewing his public. He must be used to photog- 
raphers, for he seems to pose deliberately.&quot; 

During more extensive traveling, according to one 
contestant, photography can help initiate conversa- 
tion: &quot;If you aim a camera at someone you can&apos;t help 
communicating with him or her.&quot; In a small village 
in Yemen, Evelyn Scott had to communicate with a 
sidelong glance. Aware that &quot;the men of Yemen are 
reluctant to have their women&apos;s pictures taken,&quot; Scott 
photographed one striking villager with a right-angle 
mirror attachment.

Nikos Anastasakos also seized what the White

he was struck by the &quot;patterns of light and form de- 
lineated by the poplars along the shore&quot;&quot; of Dal Lake 
in Kashmir, India. Everett C. Johnson and some fellow 
photographers were overtaken by an unexpected 
March snowstorm during a sugar maple festival in 
southwest Virginia. Johnson&apos;s entry skillfully included 
a member of the group walking along &quot;a pleasing S- 
shaped curve.&quot;&quot; 

Others know just what they want. Sculptor-photog- 
rapher James Gardner moved to the country when 
his wife took a teaching job in New York State&apos;s Cat- 
skill Mountains. Gardner found that he could never 
return to the city again and has been concentrating 
on photographing several mountain trees in all sea- 
sons. He caught one tree&apos;s changing foliage on a clear 
autumn day. Paul Sher, a pathologist and free-lance 
photographer, set off down the Anhinga Trail in Ever- 
glades National Park. His entry was a sequence of an 
anhinga feeding. &quot;Unlike other birds, the anhinga 
does not have oil glands, so it can submerge itself in 
water. It spears a fish with its beak, surfaces, flips the 
fish off its beak, and swallows it head first to avoid 
catching spines in its long throat.&quot;&quot; 

Sher and the three other First Prize winners in the 
four categories of the 1978 competition each won $500. 
The ten Honorable Mention prizes were $100 each, 
and the special award for Humor in Nature was $200. 
The 1978 Grand Prize was two tickets on the Ameri- 
can Museum of Natural History&quot;s Discovery Tour of 
Egypt next winter. The three-week trip will include a 
two-day stop in London, followed by a leisurely cruise 
up the Nile River from Cairo to Aswan, with an op- 
tional flight to Abu Simbel. All 1978 prizewinning 
photographs will be displayed in special exhibitions — 
at the American Museum of Natural History in Sep- 
tember and at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, 
Washington, in November. 

For the 1979 Natural History Photographic Com- 
petition, the categories will be: The Natural World; 
A Sequence of an Event in Nature; Photomicrography, 
including pictures with a scanning electron micro- 
scope; and The Human Environment. There will be 
special awards for Humor in Nature and Urban Wild- 
life. Details concerning the rules, the prizes, and the 
deadline will be announced early next year.

Letters 



Death by Decree 

I am troubled by Colin 1\irnbuirs 
&quot;Death by Decree,&quot; which ap- 
peared in your May 1978 issue. It 
is neither calm nor objective, al- 
though it pretends to be both. 
Mr. Turnbull says — after an emo- 
tional prelude setting out the essen- 
tial inhumanities of capital punish- 
ment, to his mind — that &quot;this is not 
an argument for or against capital 
punishment.&quot; Not only is this 
undercut before it is set out, for 
the bias is already clear, but (1) the 
arguments marshaled in favor of 
capital punishment are tersely and 
at times pejoratively stated, while 
those arguments that &quot;refute&quot; the 
positive ones are very elaborately 
developed; and (2) the pro side is 
remarkably thinly stated. Mr. Turn- 
bull draws, for example, on the re- 
sources of the humanities as well as 
on anthropology and law — but only 
to emphasize the negative position 
from which he is writing. Might 
there not be some obligation to 
see what can be learned from, say, 
the sociobiologist? 

The law has had a good deal of 
varied experience in this whole 
area; might it be useful to see what 
has been learned about redeem- 
ability, about rehabilitation, and 
about the comparable experiences 
of other criminological systems 
than our own, in which the notion 
of reforming those guilty of serious, 
life-threatening crimes has not been 
entertained? Clinical psychology 
has some useful and deeply perti- 
nent insights into the pros and cons 
of rehabilitation too. 

Unlike Mr. Turnbull, I happen to 
be persuaded — although I once held 
contrary views — that capital pun- 
ishment is both desirable and nec- 
essary, given the realities of our 
society and also given our ex- 
tremely limited abilities and re- 
sources in dealing with the anti- 
social. Rather than lean quite so 
heavily on talk of our essential 
&quot;humanity,&quot; I would myself prefer 
to deal with our unavoidable &quot;ani- 



mality,&quot; our decisive and ineradi- 
cable links with other mammalian 
species. But more important than 
any of this, and than any of my 
own opinions, I would prefer that 
any writing on so important a sub- 
ject as capital punishment deal with 
its subject, and with its readers, 
fairly and honestly. 

Burton Raffel 

University of Denver 

Denver, Colorado 

The article has moved us deeply. 
The author has done a magnificent, 
scholarly treatment of his subject. 
His humanity of spirit is inspiring. 
To use his superb talents in so daring 
a way is truly edifying. It has left an 
emotional impact that one cannot 
easily dismiss. 

Rosemary Parker 
Kansas City, Missouri 

As an effective writer (or even 
an anthropologist, as he claims 
himself to be), Colin Turnbull 
should either go soak his head in 
a wisening solution or consult the 
nearest headshrinker. 

John L. Price 
Bozeman, Montana 

This is to protest using the pages 
of Natural History to print articles 
such as Colin Tbrnbull&apos;s &quot;Death by 
Decree.&quot; Mr. Tlirnbull is entitled to 
one vote on capital punishment, like 
everybody else. He is not entitled to 
a soapbox on a topic in which he has 
no more concern than any other 
citizen. 

If you believe this letter is moti- 
vated by my convictions about capi- 
tal punishment, you miss the whole 
point. I have very mixed feelings on 
the subject and would write exactly 
the same letter, perhaps more sure 
of my position, if TUrnbull had writ- 
ten in favor of capital punishment. 

I believe professors should not 
overreach themselves. 

Jonathan D. Sauer 
University of California, 
Los Angeles, California 



Simply, thankyou for your article 
on capital punishment. My respect 
for your magazine and editorial 
policies, already high, has in- 
creased. 

Joyce M. McDonough 
Williamsburg, Maryland 

Congratulations on the superb 
article on the death penalty. 

Anton J. Dubrick 
Peoria, Illinois 

I don&apos;t know the details of Colin 
Turnbull&apos;s research design and data 
that lead him to conclude that the 
families of victims initially &quot;de- 
mand vengeance,&quot; and &quot;ultimately 
suffer from the knowledge that they 
are responsible for an ever widen- 
ing circle of tragedy.&quot; For at least 
some families, neither conclusion 
holds. What happens to the mur- 
derer is a function of the criminal 
justice system, and the penultimate 
suffering is the absence of the 
murdered person. The death pen- 
alty can be both part of a ritual 
process and not devoid of demands 
for retribution among such peoples, 
for example, as the Navajo, Joluo, 
and Western Apache. Indeed, to 
speak of our own society as one in 
which the death penalty involves 
a &quot;violent demand for retribution&quot; 
is too simplistic and misleading. 

Turnbull&apos;s characterization of 
ethnography as nearly value-free, 
unencumbered by theoretical con- 
siderations, lacking preconceptions 
of significance, and so on is sim- 
ilarly simplistic and misleading. 
Surely he is aware that increasing 
numbers of anthropologists do not 
view the ethnographic process in 
such fashion. 

His &quot;neutral&quot; list of arguments 
for and against capital punishment 
is conditioned by his research de- 
sign, his data, and his personal 
values. For example, in his discus- 
sion of the prevention of recur- 
rence argument, he states that few 
of those either presently on death 
row or executed over the past forty 



116 



years &quot;showed evidence they were 
likely&quot; to kill again. What is the 
nature of that evidence? Is there 
not a difference between premedi- 
tated murder and, as Turnbull puts 
it, &quot;crimes of the passion of a single 
moment&quot;? The existing law cer- 
tainly recognizes such differences, 
shouldn&apos;t the anthropologist? Is 
Hirnbull prepared to risk the re- 
lease through parole of a murderer 
who might kill again? Here, I sug- 
gest, is an issue for all of us to con- 
sider. I don&apos;t think current knowl- 
edge enables anything more than 
an informed guess. 

There is no question but that the 
criminal justice system is less than 
perfect. So are all human institu- 
tions. And so are all human beings. 
But when Turnbull says that deci- 
sions about the death penalty are dif- 
ficult and that lawyers do not unan- 
imously agree on whether it is 
cruel and unusual, what he is really 
saying is that decisions on matters 
we consider important are not 
made on the basis of unanimity in 
our society, in contrast to some 
other societies. Our principle is 
majority rule. 

Turnbull speaks of &quot;perfectly 
good people&quot; who, &quot;in a moment 
of passion, committed a single 
crime.&quot; Here again he misleads the 
reader. He does not distinguish be- 
tween premeditated murder and 
other kinds recognized in the law 
which do not carry the death pen- 
alty. He also ignores the victim, the 
family, andfriends— whom this &quot;per- 
fectly good&quot; person has doomed, 
in the one case, to death, and in the 
others, to endless bereavement and 
grief. Can a person be perfectly 
good and be guilty of murder at the 
same time? What if one of these 
perfectly good persons is released 
and commits another single crime 
of murder in another moment of 
passion? He speaks of atonement. 
How? For whom? How can a mur-

The importance of timely 
harvesting to fine wines. 




One of the most important times 
of the year for any winery is the 
harvest season. 

In order to make the best possible 
wine, we want to crush our grapes 
only at the very peak of their matur- 
ity. Our experience, of course, tells us 
approximately when each varietal 
grape will reach that point, but it is 
important that we know precisely 
when the grapes will reach that 
critical point of maturity. 

Field Tests 

In order to determine that critical 
point, about three weeks before 
estimated maturity, our field men 
take samples of grapes from the 
vineyards for testing. 

From representative rows of vines, 
about 200 individual grapes are 
collected. They are taken from both 
sides of the row — from the top of the 
vines, from the bottom, and from 
both the inside and the outside. 

These individual grapes together 
make up one sample which our field 
man &quot;juices&quot; on the spot. 

He then makes his own sugar test 
of the juice, puts it in a cold box and 
sends it to our laboratory for more 
exact sugar testing, plus acid and pH 
analyses. 

Laboratory Analyses 

Some wineries test only in the 
field, but we feel this is too crucial a 
time in the making of fine wines to 
not follow through with as much care 
as possible. 

These on-going analyses are each 
presented to meetings of the 
winemaker and the field man for 
their judgments. They pinpoint the 
exact time of maturity — that impor- 
tant moment when the complex 
flavor characteristics of the grape are 
at their peak. 

From the results of these tests, our 
field men then schedule deliveries 



from our growers. Because of vary- 
ing types of soil within a given 
vineyard certain areas may mature 
earlier If the vineyard is a large one, 
these areas are picked first. 

The Harvest Itself 

Usually an entire varietal crop is 
picked within a one to two week 
period, allowing for differing times of 
maturity in the various areas. 

Since we believe that, in order to 
capture the crop&apos;s optimum quality, 
grapes should be crushed within 
four hours after picking, all our 
grapes are scheduled for delivery to 
the winery no later than three hours 
after picking. 

Final Inspection 

When grapes are delivered to any 
winery, a State Inspector is standing 
by to check the sugar content and 
physical defects. 

But what is more unusual is that 
we have the winemaker — the man 
responsible for that particular 
wine — also standing by to check on 
quality. 

We know of no other winery that 
does this. 

Even though other knowledge- 
able people have passed a particular 
load of grapes, if the winemaker for 
any reason feels that they^re not 
perfectly suited for his wines, he can, 
and does, reject them. 

Our Purpose 

The care we take at harvest time is 
typical of all our efforts to achieve 
our goal. 

Here at the winery of Ernest and 
Julio Gallo, our purpose is to bring 
you the finest wine that skill and care 
can produce.

society&apos;s practice of adopting the 
murderer &quot;as a server&quot; be consid- 
ered in our society is cruel sophis- 
try. As an anthropologist, he should 
know that such cultural transplants 
are not workable in the absence of 
a supporting sociocultural context. 
In our society, I would suggest, 
the life of the individual is primary, 
and that, among other features of 
our culture, accounts for Ttirnbull&apos;s 
and others&apos; real concerns about the 
death penalty. And that is why our 
criminal justice system provides for 
the death penalty when the murder 
is not a crime of the moment, but 
is premeditated. 

Gilbert Kushner 

University of South Florida 

Tampa, Florida 

I thought that social scientists, 
even British ones, had set aside an 
overweaningly maudlin concern for 
real criminals and adopted a more 
realistic view of evil men and the 
torment their acts cause innocent 
victims. So I was dismayed to read 
Colin Tlirnbuirs pathetic anecdotal 
piece. 

Those who choose to break the 
social contract are usually prepared 
to accept the consequences of their 
acts — hence, punishment does not 
equal deterrent — and society 
should not be chided for exacting 
a penalty, even if that penalty be 
death. 

Turnbull wastes sentimentality 
on coldblooded murderers . While he 
rhapsodizes about his &quot;good and 
kindly friends&quot; suffering on death 
row, I think of the good and kindly 
friends of the victims who now lie 
dead of a brutalization far less sane 
and sanctioned than the prison and 
the electric chair. I am surprised 
that an anthropologist does not 
understand that penalties for 
wrongdoing are knit into the fabric 
of all cultures and that brutaliza- 
tions on either side do not cancel 
out each other.

Strange 
Doings 
on lo 



This large satellite of 
Jupiter is the most curious 
of all that planet&apos; s thirteen 
moons 

Small bodies in the solar system 
have become increasingly interest- 
ing objects for research in recent 
years. By small bodies I mean 
planetary satellites, the asteroids, 
comets, meteorites, and even small 
planets, such as Pluto and the newly 
discovered object lying between 
Saturn and Uranus. These bodies 
were probably formed at the same 
time as the rest of the solar system 
and by the same processes, but 
they are much less likely to have 
changed during the ensuing 4.5 
billion years. The inner planets, for 
example, have been reorganized or 
differentiated by interior melting 
through the release of nuclear and 
gravitational energy, a process that 
would not occur in the same way 
for smaller bodies. Similarly, fluid 
envelopes, whether atmospheres or 
oceans, erode and modify the sur- 
faces of Earth, Mars, and &apos;Venus, 
but smaller bodies do not have a 
strong enough gravitational field to 
hold down such envelopes. We may 
therefore hope that these small 
bodies, and particularly their sur- 
faces, present primitive material 
that is closely related to events that 
took place when the planets were 
formed. 

Jupiter has thirteen known satel- 
lites, four of which are moon-sized 
bodies easily seen through a small 
telescope. These are the Galilean 
satellites, named after their discov- 
erer, who first observed them al- 
most 370 years ago. This complex 
system of satellites is strongly rem- 
iniscent of a miniature solar sys- 
tem, with Jupiter replacing the sun 
at the center. It is difficult to avoid 
concluding that the processes of 
formation were the same for both

systems, so that one provides a 
primitive microcosm of the other. 

The innermost — and strangest — 
of the Gahlean satelhtes is lo. Its 
disk, about one arc-second in diam- 
eter, can only be resolved under 
quiet atmospheric conditions. A 
few shadowy features have been 
recorded, including dark-reddish 
polar caps. The mass of lo has been 
measured by standard astronomical 
techniques, yielding a mean density 
similar to the moon&apos;s. That was 
almost the extent of our knowledge 
from the first 350 years of research. 
But modern techniques of spec- 
troscopy and radio astronomy, to- 
gether with planetary probes, are 
adding new data that may ultimately 
lead to a deep understanding of the 
satellite, its surface, and the particle 
environment of Jupiter. 

The first remarkable property of 
lo is its ability to modify radio 
waves emitted from Jupiter in the 
decametric band (somewhat lower 
in frequency than the commercial 
FM band). The discovery of these 
radio emissions in 1955 was, at the 
time, one of the most unexpected 
results to come from the new tech- 
niques of radio astronomy. But 
even more surprising was a later 
claim by an Australian mete- 
orologist that the emission in- 
tensity was related to Io&quot;s position 
in its orbit. The meteorologist&apos;s in- 
terest was in the condensation of 
terrestrial clouds, which only adds 
to the bizarre character of this chap- 
ter of the lo story. 

What does this tell us about lo? 
To answer that question we need a 
theory of the radio emission that 
involves the properties of the satel- 
lite. The most generally accepted 
hypothesis assumes that lo con- 
ducts electricity and thereby inter- 
acts with Jupiter&apos;s magnetic field. 
Incidentally, that Jupiter, like the 
earth, should have a strong mag-

netic field was required to explain 
other features of the planet&apos;s radio 
emission. This conclusion was con- 
firmed by measurements made on 
the Pioneer 10 spacecraft, which 
flew past Jupiter in December 1973. 
The same mission showed that 
lo was an electrical conductor or, 
at least, that its atmosphere was. 
Radio waves forming the communi- 
cation link between the earth and 
the spacecraft were disturbed as 
the spacecraft passed behind the 
satellite. The manner of the dis- 
turbance indicated that lo has an 
ionosphere, an electrically conduct- 
ing atmospheric layer similar to the 
region of the earth&apos;s atmosphere 
responsible for reflecting radio 
signals across the Atlantic. We did 
not need Pioneer 10 to tell us this, 
however, for a few months before,

eries about lo was made by my 
associate Robert Brown, a plan- 
etary physicist at Harvard. He 
found that lo was emitting the 
yellow light of sodium (the same 
emission was used in past decades 
for street lighting). This discovery 
made possible the speculation that 
lo had an ionosphere in which the 
electrons were formed by sunlight 
striking atoms of sodium or that 
other atoms, particularly hydrogen 
atoms, should coexist with the 
sodium in lo&quot;s orbit. 

lo&apos;s sodium cloud has been in- 
tensively researched for five years 
(it was soon established that the 
emission was not restricted to the 
disk of the satellite itself but spread 
some distance from it in an ex- 



122 



tended cloud). Most recently one 
of my graduate students completed 
a study of pictures of the cloud. 
Making a picture was a diflRcult 
task that involved the scattering of 
light inside the telescope itself. 
Telescopes are imperfect. A point 
source of light is seen as a finite 
image surrounded by a faint corona. 
With a bright source such as Jupi- 
ter, the corona is overwhelmingly 
strong compared to the weak so- 
dium emission. It is one thing to 
separate the sodium light with an 
elaborate spectrograph ; it is far more 
difficult to distinguish between so- 
dium light and scattered Jupiter 
light in a photographic image. 

My student succeeded in taking 
pictures of the cloud by imprinting 
a characteristic signature of the 
sodium light in the form of closely 
spaced grid lines crossing the 
cloud&apos;s image; a computer was 
then used to separate the striped 
sodium image from the unwanted 
scattered light. What emerged was 
a picture of a banana-shaped cloud 
of light pointing forward from the 
satellite (with respect to its motion 
in its orbit) a distance of about three 
Jupiter radii and oriented slightly 



inward toward the planet. (The cir- 
cumference of lo&apos;s orbit is equal to 
approximately thirty-seven Jupiter 
radii.) The width of the banana, that 
is, the brightest part of the cloud, 
called region B, is of the order of 
one-third its length. There are 
other, weaker emissions at greater 
distances. 

From such pictures we can make 
many inferences. For example, the 
velocity of the majority of the so- 
dium atoms leaving the satellite is 
about one and a half miles per 
second, fast enough for them to 
escape from lo&apos;s weak gravitational 
field. The atoms survive about fif- 
teen hours and then disappear from 
the cloud. A preponderance of 
atoms is emitted from the trailing 
side — paradoxically, atoms from 
the trailing side end up ahead of lo, 
and those from the leading side end 
up behind. Finally, the outflow of 
sodium from lo — even if it has con- 
tinued throughout the age of the 
solar system — is so small that it 
could be supplied by a layer of 
sodium-bearing rocks only about 
ten feet thick. 

The consensus about what is 
happening on lo is as follows. The 



sodium is originally combined in 
some compound on the surface. 
High-energy protons, that is, 
charged nuclei of hydrogen atoms, 
circulating in the Jupiter radiation 
belts, strike lo&apos;s surface and cause 
atoms to sputteroff into space. These 
atoms are neutral, that is, they have 
lost none of their outer electrons. In 
this condition they can scatter sun- 
light in the characteristic yellow 
light of sodium. Exactly why the 
emission comes mainly from the 
trailing side is unclear — presumably 
an interaction between the protons 
and Jupiter&apos;s magnetic field is in- 
volved, perhaps related to the 
mechanism governing the mod- 
ulated radio emission previously 
discussed. 

Although the sodium atoms can 
escape from lo, they are now cap- 
tured by the much stronger gravita- 
tional field of Jupiter, and they 
move around the planet, more or 
less in the same orbit as lo, but 
diffusing slowly away from it. 

The size of the cloud is limited 
by the lifetime of the neutral so- 
dium. About fifteen hours are re- 
quired to diffuse three Jupiter radii 
forward in the orbit and in that time

the probability is that the sodium 
will lose an electron by collision 
with a charged particle in Jupiter&apos;s 
environment. When this happens, 
the sodium will cease to emit its 
characteristic yellow light. 
Moreover, Jupiter&apos;s magnetic field 
will interact strongly with an elec- 
trically charged sodium atom and 
move it rapidly out of its orbit to 
some other place in the Jupiter sys- 
tem. 

The story of the sodium atoms 
from this point onward is only 
partly understood. Eventually, the 
charged sodium atoms will recom- 
bine with electrons to form neutral 
atoms, which would once again 
scatter yellow light, but elsewhere 
than in the lo cloud. 

I will now move on to two other 
topics that may or may not be re- 
lated to the foregoing. One is lo&apos;s 
extraordinary brightness. An object 
may be bright because it is large, 
because it is close to the sun, or 
because it reflects strongly. It is not 
difficult to narrow the choice for lo. 
In the red and infrared spectrum, 
lo reflects more strongly than 
would a sphere covered with per- 
fectly white, diffusely scattering 
material. White or even pale solid 
surfaces are rare in the solar sys- 
tem. The surface reflectivity of 
Mars is about 15 percent. The ter- 
restrial oceans reflect about 6 per- 
cent of the light falling on them. 
Mercury and the moon reflect little 
more than the terrestrial oceans, 
and some regions of both are as 
dark as black paint. The overall 
reflectivity of the earth is close to 
40 percent because the planet is 
half covered with clouds. Venus 
and the giant planets have high 
reflectivities for the same reason. 
Even though we think of lo as hav- 
ing an atmosphere, it is far too thin 
to form clouds. We might most 
reasonably have guessed that lo 
would reflect darkly like the moon 
and Mercury, rather than more 
strongly than a &quot;perfect&quot; reflector. 

I put perfect in quotes because 
we must consider another factor. 
We only view lo in what amounts 
to back-reflected light. The Sun-Io- 
Earth angle is always small because 
Jupiter is far from both the sun and 
the earth. If light could somehow 
be constrained to return along the 
path of incidence, then a small 
reflection could produce a brilliant 
object, witness the glint of a distant 
mirror. But a mirror would not

produce the steady brilliance of lo 
because the satellite rotates and 
we would see an intermittently 
flashing beacon, which is not the 
case. 

The only plausible suggestion 
made so far to explain lo&apos;s bright- 
ness is that its surface is covered 
with cat&apos;s-eyes, the type of reflec- 
tor often used on traffic signs. The 
essence of a cat&apos;s-eye is a reflecting 
cube corner, which has the prop- 
erty of returning light in almost 
exactly the direction from which it 
comes. Although this is an improb- 
able proposal for lo, it is all that we 
have to go by, and lo is such a 
peculiar object that it just might 
have cat&apos;s-eyes composed of crys- 
talline deposits on its surface. 

My final topic is sulfur, which 
has been detected in ionized form 
just inside lo&apos;s orbit. The sulfur 
may have nothing directly to do 
with lo, but it was discovered in 
connection with investigations of 
the satellite, so we may take it to 
be part of lo&apos;s story. The reader 
hardly needs to be told that this 
discovery was unexpected. Every- 
thing about lo seems to be so. Re- 
gardless of how it got there, this 
ionized sulfur emission serves an 
extremely useful function: it allows 
us to infer the density and tempera- 
ture of electrons trapped in the Ju- 
piter environment. 

Jupiter&apos;s radiation belts are the 
only ones we have been able to 
investigate, other than those around 
the earth, and measuring them is 
a high priority for space missions. 
Until we have an orbiter in place 
around Jupiter, however, these 
measurements will be transitory; 
yet changes brought about with 
time constitute one of the most 
powerful investigatory tools at our 
disposal. Meanwhile, observations 
of the sulfur emission enable us to 
supplement sparse spacecraft data 
and to place short periods of in- 
tensive measurements in a historical 
context. The problem of imaging 
the sulfur cloud over short periods 
of time from the earth&apos;s surface is 
at least ten times more difficult 
than for sodium. That is our next 
target in an investigation that, year 
by year, seems to open up new pos- 
sibilities for understanding theouter 
solar system.

Additional Reading 



Great Lakes — General Reading 

Louis Agassiz wrote one of the 
first natural histories of the Great 
Lakes, Lake Superior: Physical 
Character, Vegetation, and Ani- 
mals, Compared with Those of 
Other Similar Regions (Boston: 
Gould, Kendall and Lincoln, 1850), 
which can still be found in many 
libraries. In Superior: Portrait of a 
Living Lake (New York: Harper 
and Row, 1970), Arno Karlen has 
combined excerpts from journals, 
diaries, and other writings, dating 
from 1650 to 1880, with Charles 
Steinhacker&apos;s large, color photo- 
graphs. The five volumes of &quot;The 
American Lakes Series,&quot; edited 
by Milo M.-Quaife (Indianapolis: 
Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc.), can usu- 
ally be found under the individual 
authors: Harlan Hatcher, Lake 
Erie, 1945; Arthur Pound, jLaA:e On- 
tario, 1945; Grace Lee Nute, Lake 
Superior, 1944; Milo M.-Quaife, 
Lake Michigan, 1944; and Fred 
Landon, Lake Huron, 1944. 

Some popular, anecdotal his- 
tories are: The Long Ships Passing: 
The Story of the Great Lakes, by 
Walter Havighurst, illustrated by

House, Publishers, Inc., 1960); and 
Clever F. Bald&apos;s Michigan in Four 
Centuries (New York: Harper and 
Row, rev. ed. 1961). 

The influence of the conflict be- 
tween the elements and human ac- 
tivities — cities, industries, fishing. 



shipping, and mining — on the en- 
vironment can be seen in The Faces 
of the Great Lakes, photographs by

children&apos;s book about the adven- 
tures of a woodcarving of an Indian 
on its way to the ocean in a minia- 
ture canoe. 

Two periodicals for the general 
reader are Inland Seas: Quarterly 
Journal of the Great Lakes Histori- 
cal Society and The Michigan Nat- 
ural Resources Magazine (a bi- 
monthly). The latter had a particu- 
larly interesting article, &quot;Who 
Owns the Great Lakes?&quot; by Jack 
D. Bails (May-June 1975, pp. 5-9). 

Props and Actors (p. 50) 

Three paperback books by G. E. 
Hutchinson under the general title 
A Treatise on Limnology (New 
York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 
1957) cover the subject extensively. 
Volume I consists of Geography 
and Physics of Lakes and Chem- 
istry of Lakes; volume 2 is an Intro- 
duction to Lake Biology and the 
Limnoplankton. R. G. Wetzel&apos;s

Limnology (Philadelphia: W. B. 
Saunders Company, 1975) is an 
undergraduate text that devotes 64 
of its 743 pages to a bibliography. 

Algae (p. 59) 

A recent collection, Coupling of 
Land and Water Systems: Ecologi- 
cal Studies, Volume 10, edited by 
A. D. Hasler (New York: Springer- 
Verlag, Inc., 1975), contains re- 
ports on the influences landscapes 
have on water bodies and water 
quality and the feedback processes 
through which aquatic systems act 
on land. One chapter on &quot;Silica and 
Nitrate Depletion as Related to 
Rate of Eutrophication in Lakes 
Michigan, Huron, and Superior&quot; 
(pp. 277-98), by C. L. Schelske, 
studies the causes of plankton 
changes in the upper Great Lakes. 

Twelve years earler. Limnology 
in North America (Madison: Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin Press, 1963), a 
multiauthored work edited by 
D. G. Frey, attempted to bring to- 
gether important topics in limnol- 
ogy. On pages 535 through 558 of 
this volume, &quot;The Saint Lawrence 
Great Lakes , &quot; by A . M . Beeton and 
D. C. Chandler, discusses plankton 
and briefly summarizes the litera- 
ture on Great Lakes research from 
1850 to 1966. An article on changes 
in Lake Michigan&apos;s ecosystems, 
&quot;Eutrophication, Silica Depletion, 
and Predicted Changes in Algal 
Quality in Lake Michigan,&quot; by 
C. L. Schelske and E. F. Stoermer, 
appeared in the July 30, 1971, issue 
of Science. Scientific American 
(November 1966, pp. 94-104) pub- 
lished &quot;The Aging Great Lakes,&quot; 
by C. F. Powers and A. Robertson, 
an article on the physical and biolog- 
ical processes that will eventually 
cause the extinction of the Great 
Lakes. Three scientific papers on 
eutrophication in the Great Lakes 
are: &quot;Phytoplankton Assemblages 
as Indicators of Water Quality in the 
Laurentian Great Lakes,&quot; by E. F. 
Stoermer {Transactions of the 
American Microscopic Society, 
vol. 97, 1978, pp. 1-16); &quot;A Sum- 
mary and Comparison of Nutrients 
and Related Water Quality in Lakes 
Erie, Ontario, Huron, and 
Superior,&quot; by H. F H. Dobson, M. 
Gilbertson, and P. G. Sly (Journal of 
the Fisheries Research Board of 
Canada, vol. 31, pp. 731-38); and

plankton and Primary Production in 
the Laurentian Great Lakes,&quot; by 



R. A. Vollenweider, M. Munawar, 
and P. Stadelmann (Journal of the 
Fisheries Research Board of 
Canada, vol. 31, no. 5, pp. 739-62). 

Bald Eagles (p. 62) 

Although out of print, Eagles, 
Hawks and Falcons of the World, 
by Leslie H. Brown and Dean Ama- 
dou (New York: McGraw-Hill Book 
Co., 1968), is available in some li- 
braries. This biology of birds of 
prey is in two volumes with many 
color plates. Eagles of the World 
(New York: Universe Books, 1976) 
describes physical and behavioral 
characteristics, development of 
young, and the need for conserva- 
tion. A nontechnical work on the 
biology and current status of bald 
eagles is Autumn of the Eagle, by 
George Laycock (New York: 
Charles Scribner&apos;s Sons, 1973). 
How DDT affects eggshells is ex- 
plained in a Scientific American ar- 
ticle, &quot;Pesticides and the Reproduc- 
tion of Birds,&quot; by David B. Peakall, 
April 1970, pp. 72-78. &quot;The Bald 
Eagle Bicentennial Blues,&quot; by 
David R. Zimmerman (Natural His- 
tory, January 1976, pp. 8-16), con- 
tinues the story, adding gunshot to 
the list of eagle killers. The mini- 
mum productivity figure of 0.7 
young per pair per year comes from 
&quot;Comparative Productivity of Six 
Bald Eagle Populations&quot; (Transac- 
tions of the Thirty-eighth North 
American Wildlife and Natural Re- 
sources Conference, vol. 38, pp. 
96-106), by Alexander Sprunt, IV, 
et al. &quot;A Great Lakes Tragedy,&quot; by 
Michael Gilbertson (Nature 
Canada, January-March 1975, pp. 
22-25), also addresses the effects of 
pesticides and other toxicants on 
fish-eating birds. 

Decline of Lake Plants (p. 66) 

In his article, Ronald Stuckey 
mentions his fieldwork in Put-in- 
Bay&apos;s harbor. The study resulting 
from this fieldwork, in which he 
compares his findings with the rec- 
ords of Pieters, Moseley, and other 
botanists, was published in 1971 in 
the Ohio Journal of Science (vol. 
71, no. 6, pp. 321-42) as &quot;Changes 
in Vascular Aquatic Flowering 
Plants During 70 Years in Put-in-Bay 
Harbor, Lake Erie, Ohio.&quot; Refer- 
ences to publications of the other 
botanists can be found at the end of 
the Ohio Journal of Science article. 
Two books on aquatic plants are 
Common Marsh, Underwater and 



Floating-leaved Plants of the 
United States and Canada, by Neil 
Hotchkiss (New York: Dover Publi- 
cations, Inc., 1972), and The Biology 
of Aquatic Vascular Plants, by 
C. D. Sculthorpe (New York: St. 
Martin&apos;s Press, Inc., 1967). 

Pollutants from the Sky (p. 70) 

The chemical and physical char- 
acteristics of six cores from Lake 
Erie are described in &quot;Cultural Im- 
pact on the Geochemistry of Sedi- 
ments in Lake Erie,&quot; by A. L. W. 
Kemp et al. (Lake Erie in the Early 
Seventies. Journal of the Fisheries 
Research Board of Canada. Spe- 
cial Issue, vol. 33, no. 3, pp. 440- 
62). &quot;Records of Lead Deposition 
in Lake Michigan Sediments Since 
1800,&quot; by D. N. Edgington and 
J. A. Robbins, can be found in En- 
vironmental Science and Tech- 
nology (vol. 10, pp. 266-74). 

Thirsty Society (p. 76) 

The complete Proceedings of the 
Second Federal Conference on the 
Great Lakes was produced by the 
Public Information Office of the 
Great Lakes Basin Commission. 
The purpose of this 1975 conference 
was to determine the current status 
and future needs of research related 
to the impact of energy conversion 
on the Great Lakes. 

Salmon (p. 80) 

Scientific background can be 
found in three reports written by 
Stanford H. Smith: &quot;The Future of 
Salmonid Communities in the 
Laurentian Great Ldkes&quot; and 
&quot;Factors of Ecologic Succession in 
Oligotrophic Fish Communities of 
the Laurentian Great Lakes&quot; were 
published in the 7oMr«fl/ off /je Fish- 
eries Research Board of Canada, 
vol. 29; &quot;Application of Theory and 
Research in Fishery Management of 
the Laurentian Great Lakes&quot; ap- 
peared in Transactions of the 
American Fisheries Society (vol. 
102, no. 1). In 1971, a symposium on 
&quot;Salmonid Communities in Oligo- 
trophic Lakes&quot; was held to study 
eutrophication, fisheries exploita- 
tion, and the introduction of exotic 
fish species. The proceedings, com- 
piled by H. A. Regier and K. H. 
Loftus, ran in the Journal of the 
Fisheries Research Board of Can- 
ada (vol. 29, no. 6, pp. 611-986). 

&quot;You&apos;ll Always Get Home&quot; (p. 88) 

The findings of a sixty-year study 



136 



on the problem of fluctuations in 
fish abundance are summarized in 
The Western End of Luke Erie and 
its Ecology, by T. H. Langlois (Ann 
Arbor: Joseph W. Edwards 
Brothers, Inc., 1954). Two reports 
available from the Great Lakes 
Fishery Commission are &quot;Commer- 
cial Fish Production in the Great 
Lakes, 1867-1960&quot; and &quot;Techni- 
cal Report No. 3&quot; (1962). 

Computerized Ecosystem (p. 95) 

For a general introduction to 
solving biological problems in 
mathematical terms see Maynard J. 
Smith&apos;s Mathematical Ideas in 
Biology (New York: Cambridge 
University Press, 1968). A classic 
first published in 1924, Elements of 
Mathematical Biology, by A. J. 
Lotka (New York: Dover Publica- 
tions, Inc., 1957), is still an excel- 
lent source of ideas. Two current 
books on environmental modeling 
are R. V. Thomann&apos;s Systems 
Analysis and Water Quality Man- 
agement (New York: McGraw-Hill 
Book Co., 1974) and Systems Ap- 
proach to Water Management, by 
A. K. Biswas (New York: McGraw- 
Hill Book Co., 1976).

Celestial Events 

Thomas D. Nicholson 

Sun and Moon The sun is moving east through the stars of Cancer 
in early August, entering Leo on the lOth, passingjust below the star 
Regulus on the 23rd, and nearing the planet Saturn on the 27th. On 
September 16. the sun moves into the constellation Virgo, where it 
remains until the end of October. On September 23. it crosses above 
the earth&apos;s equator, from north to south, at 4:26 a.m.. EST. On the 
27th, day and night will be equal, that is, the interval from sunrise to 
sunset will be twelve hours. 

New moon occurs near the beginning of each month and full moon 
near midmonth. resulting in an evening moon the first half of 
August and September; a morning moon the last half. Phases are:

Stars and Planets Evening planets are poor this summer, in con- 
trast to our spectacular spring. Mars and Venus are still evening stars, 
but Mars is dim and sets too early. Venus is bright and easily seen in 
the sunset glow but appears low and sets early. Daytime viewing of 
Venus is good from late August to early October. Jupiter shows up as 
a bright morning star by late August and gets better in September; 
Saturn rises before dawn by late September. Mercury is also a morn- 
ing star for the first ten days of September. 

August 7-8: Be sure to look at the crescent moon. Venus, and 
Mars this evening, shortly after sundown. You will seldom see the 
moon closer to Venus. It covers the two planets during the night. 

August 10-14: Look for the famous Perseid meteor shower any 
night, from about midnight on. Best on the 12th (up to 50 per hour), 
but you should see 20 or more shower meteors per hour, some very 
bright, two or three mornings before or after the 12th. 

August 14: Venus and Mars are in conjunction. 

August 17-18: The perigee moon will enhance the effect of the 
spring tide associated with the full moon of the 18th. 

August 18: Mercury enters the morning sky. 

August 27: Saturn becomes a morning star. 

August 29: Venus is at greatest elongation (distance from the sun) 
as an evening star. 

September 4: Mercury is at greatest elongation in the morning sky. 

September 5-6: The crescent moon passes near Mars and Venus. 

September 16: Harvest moon. 

September 21-22: The occulation of Aldebaran by the moon is 
visible in North America beginning shortly after 6:00 a.m.. EST. 

September 23: Autumn begins in the Northern Hemisphere. 

September 26: The moon is near Jupiter this morning. 

September 30: Mercury enters the evening sky. 

October 2: Partial solar eclipse in southern Europe and Asia. 

October 3: Venus is at greatest brilliancy. 

October 4: Venus is near the moon tonight. 

October 16: Hunter&apos;s moon.

From September 13 through 17, 
the Museum will hold its second, 
annual Margaret Mead Film Fes- 
tival. Inaugurated last September 
in honor of Mead&apos;s seventy-fifth 
birthday year, the 1978 festival will 
include more than one hundred 
anthropological films. They will be 
shown continuously in various 
parts of the Museum on Saturday, 
September 16, and Sunday, Sep- 
tember 17, and will be free to all 
visitors who pay the Museum&apos;s 
discretionary admission fee. 

The 1978festival will honor Argen- 
tine filmmaker Jorge Preloran. In a 
ticketed series on the evenings of 
September 13 through 15, Preloran 
will show several of his films and 
discuss his work. Margaret Mead 
will join Preloran on two nights and 
Malcolm Arth, curator of education 
at the Museum, will moderate all 
three evenings. 

Jorge Preloran was born in Ar- 
gentina forty-five years ago but 
learned his filmmaking craft at 
UCLA. Until Imaginero (&quot;The 
Image Man&quot;), which he regards as 
one of his two most important films, 
was first shown publicly in Buenos 
Aires in 1969, he enjoyed almost no 
professional recognition. &quot;For 
most of my life.&quot; he explains, &quot;I 
had been very unsociable. I was 
asthmatic until 1 was 22. I went to 
the United States to study [architec- 
ture and filmmaking] and was al- 
ways alone. 1 was married briefly 
for a couple of years, then lived 
alone for eleven years, mostly 
traveling about in a Jeep, making 
film portraits of rural people in re- 
mote parts of Argentina. 

&quot;In 1960, when I was making my 



early films on folklore in Argen- 
tina, I was convinced that my ap- 
proach was completely objective, 
that I was not becoming involved 
at all, but remained always a neutral 
observer.&quot; But since Preloran 
began making films about individ- 
uals, he has found that he can no 
longer pretend to cool objectivity. 
&quot;I cannot make documentaries 
about individuals whom I do not 
love and respect. The involvement 
with the character, his family, the 
stress under which they live, the 
problems and anguish of their daily 
routine sooner or later permeate 
my own life and make the films 
totally subjective.&quot; Preloran be- 
lieves in making a film for his sub- 
jects and has no wish to present 
so-called primitive peoples in a 
manner palatable to sophisticated 
audiences. 

During the ticketed screenings, 
Preloran will show his 1978 film, 
Zerda&apos;s Children, about a wood- 
cutter and his family of ten chil- 
dren, and The Warao (1974), a por- 
trait of a Venezuelan Indian tribe, 
hunters and fishermen who live in 
stilt huts along the Orinoco River&apos;s 
waterways. Both films, which Pre- 
loran calls &quot;documents of human 
geography,&quot; attempt to describe 
how people survive in a particular 
region. Preloran will also show 
Imaginero. a portrait of Hermo- 
genes Cayo, an Indian folk artist 
living in the high, barren plateau of 
the Puna, in northwestern Argen- 
tina near the Bolivian border; Cayo 
carved religious images — shrines, 
saints. Virgins, Christs — from cac- 
tus root, and his brightly painted 
work, combining Inca and Spanish

as &quot;giving a voice to remote rural 
people who have none&quot; and feels 
that the more important part of 
Imaginero is the self-revelation on 
the sound track — Cayo himself de- 
scribing his life. 

Another Preloran work, Araii- 
canians of Riica Choroy (1971), 
a film portrait of an Indian tribe, 
will be part of the Museum&apos;s un- 
ticketed weekend program. Films 
shown in Museum areas with 
seating — the Auditorium, Educa- 
tion Hall, and the Hall of Asiatic 
Mammals — will concentrate on 
three themes: Ceremonies and 
Celebrations, Families, and Per- 
sonalities. The last will include 
portraits of individuals from many 
cultures. Preloran&apos;s film fits this 
category, as does a film portrait of 
Margaret Mead made last Septem- 
ber by Jean Rouch, the French 
ethnographic filmmaker honored 
by the 1977 festival. Rouch took 
advantage of his visit to New York 
to film Mead in her office, walking 
through the Museum and along 



Central Park, and talking of her 
Museum career and her life. 

Mead herself will present two 
special programs in the Audito- 
rium. On Saturday, a forum on 
trance will include films of cere- 
monies involving trance in Bali and 
Indonesia, as well in the South 
Bronx. Her Sunday program, 
&quot;Truth and Fact in Film,&quot; will 
ponder whether presentation of 
&quot;facts&quot; is the best cinematic 
method of arriving at &quot;truth.&quot; 

The best way to learn about the 
film weekend is to pick up a pro- 
gram, which includes complete list- 
ings of films and times and several 
short articles about the festival. 
Programs for the second annual 
Margaret Mead Film Festival will 
be available at Museum informa- 
tion desks starting the first week 
in August. Series tickets for the 
three evenings with Jorge Preloran 
cost $15 ($13 for Participating, 
Donor, and Life members, and for 
students with an ID card). For 
ticket information, call (212) 873-

SOMEHOW SCOTCH 

BOTTLED ELSEWHERE 

ISN&apos;T QUITE THE SAME. 

ContraRV to popular belief, manv More brands of Scotch 
are bottled in America than ir\ Scotland. They ^re bulk- 
shipped and boHled here, often using municipal water. 

The makers of CuHy Sark, however. Remain adamant 
on the subject of Scottish Scotch. 

To this day, Cubty SaRk is distitted, blended, and 

bottled in Scotland, using the water of Loch Katrine. 
This results in a Scots Whisky of uncomMon smoothness 
which is worth every penny you pay for it. 

To recognise genuine Scots Whisky, you need look 
no fuRther thaw the very jop of the label on a bottle of 

Cutty Sark. 

It spells out exactly what you&apos;re geiiing right there 

in black and yellow.

ordinary &quot;points/condensor&quot; system 
could give you trouble. 



IVIore 5-speeds. Toyota 

offers more models with

other manufacturer. 

Another example of 

traditional Toyota operating

More convenience. The

than a sedan, but also 
features a special split, fold-

than the national fleet standard for all 

cars. In 1978 EPA tests the Corolla SR-5 is 

rated at 38 mpg highway, 28 mpg city. These 

1978 EPA ratings are estimates. Your mileage 

will vary depending on your driving 

habits and your car&apos;s condition and

all brakes, . . heat. And they resist fade. 
That&apos;s why they are standard on every Toyota. 



More now. Right now. We can&apos;t tell you when, but all prices will 
probably go up including car prices. So if you&apos;re thinking about

Or mixologist Robert Lanza&apos;s lesson: 

&quot;Creating an interesting drink 
requires the titillation of the senses. 



not the least of which is sight . . . On

Trained in linguistics, John 
Baugh writes that &quot;this training has 
considerably influenced the manner 
in whica further search into the roots 
of her field. Her &quot;fieldwork&quot; was 
carried out mainly in the manu- 
script rooms of British museums 
and libraries, examining English 
bestiaries. A professor of zoology, 
Lauber has done laboratory re- 



search on the influence of light on 
the endocrine and reproductive 
systems in birds and mammals. 
One of her research projects on 
intraocular pressure in owls re- 
quired that she keep twelve great 
horned owls for study. &quot;The birds 
wouldn&apos;t take mice,&quot; she says. 
&quot;They demanded chicken cut up in 
fryer-sized pieces and served on a 
tray — and hissed if the service 
wasn&apos;t fast enough.&quot;

The original, indispensable 

KUJGE BAG 

The &quot;No-Waiter&quot; 

A six piece set in one easy to carry-on 
... for overnight or around tlie world. 



Two time TV Emmy Award Winner Stan Hart: &quot;Ttie Kluge 
Bag is the best. Tlie only piece of luggage I ever use. &quot; 

Pennsylvania cattleman Robert Johnson: &quot;For quality, 
convenience, organization, the Kluge Bag tops any set of 
luggage I&apos;ve ever used. &quot; 

DRG Record Company President Hugh Fordin: &quot;One 
carry-on piece sure beats three or four check-in bags. I&apos;m 
delighted. &quot; 



Here&apos;s the famous original you&apos;ll see on the Concorde, 
the shuttle to Washington, the commuter out of 
O&apos;Hare. The Kluge Bag. The only combination over- 
nighter and fortnighter in the world. 

And the only bag that&apos;s as easy to carry to the last 
airline gate with a complete wardrobe as it is with a 
single change of clothing. 

A &quot;no waiter&quot; you never check in. Never have to wait 
for at the baggage counter 

Extra Comfort and Convenience 

You&apos;ll use the Kluge Bag like a week-ender, too, 
because it&apos;s just as easy to carry on and a whole lot 
better Better because nothing gets wrinkled or 
creased . . . because you have extra room for all the 
reports and papers you need, the tennis things you 
may or may not use, the sweater you&apos;d like to be able 
to knock around in at night, and to bring back anything 
from reports to a new suit you pick up on your trip. (You 
can prove it yourself at our hsk!) 




Beautifully Organized 

The almost infinite flexibility is the result of an or- 
ganization system designed by Peter Kluge, an inter- 
national businessman, who travels constantly, from 
Chicago to Dallas, New York, Los Angeles, to Europe 
and the ((Middle East, never sure if he&apos;ll be away two 
days or two weeks, or of the clothing he&apos;ll need. 

So, in one lightweight, compact, easy-to-carry 
handle or shoulder bag you get (1) a garment bag that 
holds two suits, (2) a pullman case, (3) a week-ender 
(4) a tote-tennis bag, (5) a toilet-accessories kit, (6) a 
laundry-wet stuff bag . . . plus a full-size portfolio. 
Compartmentalized for easy access to your shirts, 
ties and belts; shoes and socks; underwear; suits, 
slacks and jackets; sportswear, sweater, bathrobe; 
business reports and papers. Anything and every- 
thing you need. 




One Vs. Two, Three or Four 

You can&apos;t even begin to compare the ease and 
convenience of the Kluge (rhymes with huge) Bag with 
the bulky, heavy, loaded-down check-in luggage you 
usually carry on trips of three, four or more days. 

The Kluge Bag alone easily outcarries a garment 
bag, a weekender or pullman plus a dispatch case. It 
not only looks better, weighs less, it&apos;s also much easier 
to carry and leaves your hands free to get your wallet 
or ticket. Most important of all, only the Kluge Bag is 
always ready when you are to get off the plane. 

Top Quality Construction 

Simply there&apos;s no other piece of luggage anything 
like this. Beautifully made of top-quality cellulose 
rayon, the material that&apos;s most often used in expensive 
luggage today because it&apos;s as strong as it is light, and 
sponges clean in an instant to retain its beauty 
through years of use and abuse, the Kluge Bag is 
available in natural canvas color with rich brown piping 
and in striking solid black diamond and brown trim. 

Outside there are three sectional zippers, so you 
can get to anything in a second, with security snap 
locks and an over-all snap lock safety strap, plus 
comfortable carrying handles and the adjustable, 
burden-bearing shoulder strap. 

Inside, a fold-up rigid bottom supports everything 
you can carry in the zippered main compartment. The 
fittings and details are 
equally impressive, like 
a tie rack, a fitted com- 
partment for toiletries, a 
zippered compartment 
for valuables, pockets 
for cards, notes, keys 
and more. Plus a huge 
volume portfolio. Every- 
thing you need to make 
packing and traveling 
for days or weeks 
easier and faster than 
it&apos;s ever been before. 



Yet fully packed the Kluge Bag is just 18&quot; high by 23&quot; 
long and 12&quot; deep. 

Only $40.00! 

Most extraordinary of all, though, is the price. At $90 
and $100. which is the price you&apos;d probably have to 
spend in a fine retail store, the Kluge Bag would be an 
excellent value. At $40.00 it&apos;s absolutely unbeatable. 

A price that&apos;s possible because we&apos;re one of the 
largest mail merchandisers in the United States — 
able to commit for an entire manufacturing run, and to 
eliminate salesmen, distributors and retailers and 
their costs by selling direct. 

No Risk Trial 

Now we invite you to judge the Kluge Bag for 
yourself — for 30 days without risk or obligation. You 
must be convinced that it&apos;s the finest, most useful, 
convenient and versatile piece of luggage on the mar- 
ket today, a time and trouble saver, the perfect piece 
for every trip, or return it to us for a complete refund.

Genetic Crossroads 



by Laurence E. Karp 



The way genes meet at 
the moment of fertilization 
helps determine whether 
a normal individual 
will be born 



No single event in any mam- 
mars existence is as momentous as 
the brief process of fertilization. 
Much more than the penetration of 
an egg by a spermatozoon, fertil- 
ization consists of a series of deli- 
cately timed developments and 
interactions between the male- and 
female-derived units of heredity. 
During fertilization, an individual&apos;s 
capacity for normal existence is 
determined. 

The steps involved in fertilization 
must proceed according to a strict 
schedule; when it varies, the new 
individual is permanently damaged. 
The harm can be lethal, resulting in 
miscarriage. Individuals who sur- 
vive lesser injuries suffer various 
forms of birth defects. 

Every normal mammal has gam- 
etes, or reproductive cells, whose 
primary function is to maintain and 
transmit to the next generation the 
normal number of chromosomes 
for the species. Each gamete must 
come to contain one-half of the 
characteristic chromosome number; 
otherwise each generation would 
have twice as many chromosomes as 
the previous one. Meiosis, or reduc- 
tion division, is the process by which 
the chromosomal number is reduced 
by one-half. 

In the sperm, meiosis consists of 
replication of the chromosomes fol- 
lowed by two chromosomal arid 
cellular divisions. Thus, a single 
human gametic stem cell contain- 
ing 46 chromosomes ends up as 
four mature sperm, each with 23 
chromosomes. Throughout the 
male&apos;s reproductive life span, from 
puberty to senescence, spermato- 
genic stem cells are constantly 
dividing, entering into meiosis, and 
forming functional spermatozoa. 



In the egg, the basic principle of 
meiosis is the same, but the process 
is somewhat more complex. All the 
ovogenic stem cells initiate the 
meiotic process while their female 
bearer is herself still a fetus. They 
replicate their chromosomes, then 
enter and remain in a period of 
arrest until the bearer reaches pu- 
berty. Then, each month, shortly 
before ovulation, one or two ova 
enlarge, develop, and complete the 
first meiotic division. 

Although the chromosomes in 
the egg cell&apos;s nucleus divide 
equally, the division of the cell&apos;s 
protoplasm, which is the cell&apos;s ma- 
terial outside the nucleus, is any- 
thing but equitable. The egg cell 
retains almost all the protoplasm, 
only a tiny bit going to form the first 
polar body, a cell that soon degen- 
erates and whose only apparent 
purpose is to serve as a means of 
eliminating unneeded chromosomal 
material. At this point, after the first 
meiotic division and before the sec- 
ond, ovulation occurs, expelling the 
ovum into the Fallopian tube. Here, 
the female gamete awaits the arrival 
of its male partner; it will not com- 
plete the second meiotic division 
unless it is first penetrated by a 
sperm. 

No one knows exactly how 
sperm make their way from the 
vagina through the uterus and into 
the Fallopian tube. Once sperm 
touch the egg, they wriggle their 
way toward and into its suriound- 
ing zona pellucida, or jelly coat. 
Although veritable armies of 
spermatozoa invade the zona, or- 
dinarily only one sperm cell attains 
its goal. The first sperm to get 
through the zona pellucida arranges 
itself parallel to the surface of the 
egg, lying against it rather than 
head-on. Then the sperm fuses with 
the membranes surrounding the 
egg. Actually, the egg cell, which 
is much larger than the sperm, en- 
gulfs the contents of the sperm, and 
the sperm chromosomes enter the 



egg protoplasm. Simultaneously, 
the egg extrudes a number of tiny 
pellets, called cortical granules, 
into the zona pellucida. These 
pellets probably make the egg im- 
permeable to other spermatozoa. 

Once the sperm has penetrated 
the egg and entered the protoplasm, 
forming a one-celled embryo, two 
major processes begin and progress 
simultaneously. The sperm head 
transforms into the male set of 
chromosomes, and the egg chromo- 
somes resume and complete their 
second meiotic division. During the 
first process, the earliest visible 
change in the sperm head is swell- 
ing. The hereditary material of the 
spermatozoon, which has been 
very tightly coiled in the sperm 
head, is now looser and begins to 
look less dense. Concurrently, the 
sperm somehow activates the fe- 
male chromosomes, which start to 
separate into two groups. As the 
sperm head continues to swell, 
finally developing into the male 
pronucleus (the collected male- 
derived chromosomes), the two 
groups of egg chromosomes sep- 
arate widely. Finally, one group is 
pinched off in a bit of protoplasm; 
although this second polar body de- 
generates and fragments more 
slowly, it eventually suffers the 
same fate as the first. By forming 
the second polar body, the human 
egg has at last reduced its chromo- 
some number to 23, or half the 
normal human number of 46. These 
23 chromosomes then form the 
female pronucleus. 

The male and female pronuclei, 
progenitors of a two-celled embryo, 
gradually approach each other. At 
this early stage, the individual 
chromosomes are metabolically 
very active, synthesizing new nu- 
cleic acids . In preparation for the first 
embryonic cell division, the 23 
male-derived and 23 female-derived 
chromosomes are replicating them- 
selves. The two groups of chromo- 
somes continue their centripetal

movement and finally merge near 
the center of the cell. The replicated 
chromosomes then separate and 
move to opposite poles; as they do, 
the protoplasm divides at the mid- 
line, forming a two-celled embryo. 
Each cell contains a nucleus, made 
up of 46 chromosomes, now elon- 
gated and invisible. These chromo- 
somes will again replicate, then 
shorten and become visible, and 
each of the two cells will divide, 
formingafour-celled embryo, and so 
on and on until by this process all the 
cells of the human body have 
formed. Every cell will possess the 
correct number of 46 chromosomes. 
The sex of this new individual 
is determined at the time of fertil- 
ization. Of the 46 chromosomes in 
the normal human complement, 44, 
called autosomes, are identical in

hamster egg, with the first 
and second polar bodies and

males and females: the other two 
are the sex chromosomes. Females 
have two large chromosomes called 
Xs, while males have one X and a 
small chromosome called a Y. The 
genes for male sex determination 
are thought to be carried on the Y 
chromosome; thus, an embryo with 
a Y develops into a male, and an 
embryo without a Y becomes a 
female. 

Sex determination is a function 
of the sperm. Since ovogenic stem 
cells have XX sex-chromosome 
constitutions, all mature eggs 
possess 22 autosomes and one X. 
Spermatogenic stem cells are of an 
XY makeup, so a spermatozoon 
will contain 22 autosomes and 
either an X or a Y. An X-bearing 
sperm penetrating an egg produces 
a 46, XX female, while penetration 
by a Y-bearing sperm results in a 46, 
XY male. 

Because the fertilization process 
is both complex and delicately 
timed, there is ample opportunity 
for its mechanisms to malfunction. 
This happens frequently. Two 
French embryologists recently esti- 
mated that fully half of all human 
embryos conceived may be de-

multiple time zone technology! 



World 
Traveler 

79 



Anew dimension in time 
comes packaged in the shape 
of our impeccably styled Commodore 
World Traveler Chronograph Alarm. 
Within its sculptured case is an array of 
the most desired time measuring 
features ever programmed into a watch 
so realistically priced. We know, 
because Contemporary has made it its 
business to search out the most inno- 
vative electronic values for its readers. 
Place it on your wrist, and at once you 
will recognize its extraordinary power to 
command time in a dozen ways. 
The World Traveler keeps track of any 
two domestic or world time time zones, 
concurrently. It is a timepiece tor that 
singular man whose office may be in any 
city, but who measures bottom line pro- 
fit by the activities of his factory abroad. 
A glance at his watch tells him that it is 
10:48 PM, Tuesday, the 7th, when he 
boards a plane for his overseas flight. 
Touching just one button instantly shifts 
the watch from its local time mode to the 
preselected second city time. A flag 
appears beneath the alternate time zone 
symbol II. The display now shows that it 
is 5:48 AM, Wednesday, the 8th. The 
customary confusion associated with 
the International Date Line is a thing of 
the past. The watch will remain in the 
alternate time zone until, at the touch of 
a button, he returns it to his home time. 
And, when he does so, the exact hour, 
minute, day of the week, and date or 
second will reappear.

Peace Of Mind Accuracy... 
Anywhere In The World 

The inherent oscillation of a gem cut 
quartz crystal assures the World 
Traveler&apos;s precision to within ±5 
seconds each month. Its powerful per- 
formance logic is equally guaranteed by 
the miracle of a tiny solid state 
microprocessor brain. 



The only 2-zone 

Chronograph Alarm 

with a $200 face for 

determining world time. 



2-Zone Automatic Calendar 

Liquid crystal readout, apart from 
assuring thousands of hours of battery 
life, delivers &quot;always on&quot; readability. 
Bold figures continuously show hours, 
minutes and day of the week. Touch a 
button and the World Traveler enables 
you to also read either running seconds 
or date. If it&apos;s Tuesday in Chicago, and 
Wednesday in your alternate time zone, 
your watch will maintain the respective 
days, dates and times, concurrently, 
with uncanny precision. A backlight 
enhances visibility for evening wear. 
A Personal Alarm In Both Time Zones 
It&apos;s easy to consider your World 
Traveler as two distinctive timepieces 
in one because each set of data is 
independent, yet simultaneously con- 
trolled. If you have set an alarm for 7 AM 
local time, the watch will automatically 
sound, lor one full minute, at this time 
every day while in this zone, unless 
changed or shut off. If you switch to the 
alternate time zone, you can preset the 
24-hour alarm just as easily. In either 
case, it emits a clear, electronic beep 
precisely at the preset moment, to 
remind you to make that call, or attend 
that meeting. With your personal alarm 
World Traveler, you will never have to 
rely upon awake-upcall again. 
A Powerful Chronograph 
The World Traveler is not two 
timepieces in one.../f&apos;s three. And, in its 
chronograph mode it exhibits an entirely 
different personality. It&apos;s a recreational 
or business tool. With it, sailing 
enthusiasts can be at the starting line 
within a fraction of a second of the final 
gun. TV quarterbacks and season ticket 
holders can enjoy clocking ball release 
plays and punt &quot;hangtimes&quot; with 
professional precision. At swim meets, 
track events, races, you can keep tabs 
on your team or your youngster, with 
tenth of a second accuracy. You can 
measure piecework and production time 
with equal exactness. 

Stopwatch. This mode counts action 
time only. Time any activity, from a track 
event to a telephone call, from start to 
finish. Begin an exercise and start the

When you resume, push the button and 
the clock begins at the precise moment 
you left off. You measure total exercise 
time exclusive of non-action time. 

Split Time. In this mode, you can stop 
the watch face to record interim time 
while the internal clock keeps running. 

After several seconds, the watch face 
automatically resumes its count, 
without having skipped a beat. 
It&apos;s A World Time Machine 

From its world timetable face you can 
instantly determine the time for any one 
of the 24 international cities displayed.

TOURS 




&quot;Nature tour&quot; has a special meaning when 
you travel with Questers. We are theon/y pro- 
fessional travel company specializing exclu- 
sively in nature tours. Our approach in plan- 
ning Worldwide Nature Tours is to provide 
you with the broadest possible opportunity of 
experiencing for yourself the natural history 
and culture of each area we explore. With the 
leadership of an accompanying naturalist, we 
search out the plants and animals, birds and 
flowers ... rain forests, mountains, and tun- 
dra . . . seashores, lakes, and swamps of the 
regions we visit. We also study the architec- 
ture, archaeology, museum collections, tem- 
ples, and customs of the people. 

Varying in length from 9 to 36 days, Ques- 
ters Worldwide Nature Tours travel to virtu- 
ally every part of the world. Groups are small, 
and early reservations are therefore sug- 
gested. Listed below is a sampling of the 33

Human spermatozoa (1,500X) 

fective because of fertilization 
errors. Basically, fertilization er- 
rors consist of faulty chromosomal 
movements, so that the embryo 
contains an abnormal number of 
chromosomes, either too many or 
too few. Because chromosomes are 
linear aggregations of genes, a new 
organism with an inappropriate 
number of chromosomes has an ex- 
cess or a deficiency of genes. Since 
the genes of a developing embryo 
signal to its organs when and how 
to form, a genetic imbalance means 
that the developing embryo will be 
subjected to abnormal genetic de- 
velopmental signals, leading to mal- 
formation or to death and subse- 
quent abortion. 

Although the ultimate causes of 
chromosomal errors about the 
time of fertilization are not at all 
clear, we can describe what hap- 
pens. Sometimes, the penetrating 
sperm head fails to activate the 
egg chromosomes to complete the 
second meiotic division. Then the 



...... 6 




embryo contains only one pronu- 
cleus with one set of functioning 
chromosomes. This condition is 
called androgenesis. The reverse 
situation, where the spermatozoon 
does activate the female-derived 
chromosomes, but then fails to 
swell and undergo pronuclear de- 
velopment, is termed gynogenesis. 
Cells that contain only one set of 
chromosomes, either male or fe- 
male, are called haploid. 

Both androgenesis and gyno- 
genesis are lethal states. When half 
the genes are missing, little em- 
bryonic development is possible, 
and the individual usually succumbs 
before completion of more than a 
few cell divisions. No androgenetic 
orgynogenetic mammals have been 
found born alive. 

Like too few sets of chromo- 
somes, too many are also deleteri- 
ous. Embryos may come to con- 
tain three, rather than two, sets 
and this state is called triploidy. In

The Royal Dutch Horticultural Society invites you to acquire 

The Flowers of Holland 
Thimble Collection 



For just $9-75 each — twelve exquisite collector&apos;s thimbles 

in fine porcelain, hand-decorated in 24 karat gold, 

portraying the best-loved flowers of The Netherlands. 



Strictly limited edition. 
Subscription deadline: October 31, 1978. 

The flowers of Holland are admired the world 
over for their color, beauty and vigor. And, 
through the centuries, the great Dutch paint- 
ers have created some of the loveliest of all 
floral art. 

In this tradition, The Royal Dutch Horti- 
cultural Society has authorized from Franklin 
Porcelain, Amsterdam, a unique new series — 
The Flowers of Holland Thimble Collection 
—twelve collector&apos;s thimbles of fine porcelain, 
created by the internationally renowned artist 
Ronald Van Ruyckevelt. 

The beauty of flowers— in fine porcelain 

Each thimble is small enough to cradle in the 
palm of your hand. And yet even the tiniest, 
most delicate features of the flowers portrayed 
are captured in the living colors of nature. The 
botanical name of each flower— in elegant 
script — will be incorporated into the design. 
The finishing touch will be a 24 karat gold 
border— skillfully applied by hand. This ex- 
traordinary collection thus represents a veri- 
table gallery of flower art in miniature— still 
further enhanced by the delicate translucency 
of fine porcelain. 

Yours to arrange as you like 

Merely to touch one of these graceful thimbles 
is to sense with subtle pleasure the rich smooth- 
ness of finely-glazed porcelain. To examine 
one with a careful eye is to see the familiar 
thimble transformed into an object of true 
beauty. As a subscriber to The Flowers of 
Holland Thimble Collection, you will be able 
to set out the thimbles one by one (or in small 
groups) on an occasional table, in a china cabi- 
net -- or in the special display frame provided — 
where you may enjoy their charm to the full. 

Timeless loveliness in limited edition 
These beautiful thimbles are available only as 
a collection— and only in limited edition. Each 
subscriber will receive a Certificate of Au- 
thenticity, attesting to the edition limits, and 
an informative folder on the flowers portrayed. 

The Flowers of Holland Thimble Collection 
is available exclusively through Franklin 
Porcelain. The price of each thimble will be

some cases, tripioidy can be traced 
to fatilty action on the sperm&apos;s part. 
Normal spermatozoa undergo two 
meiotic divisions and then contain 
a single set of 23 chromosomes at 
maturity. Should one of the divi- 
sions fail to take place in a develop- 
ing sperm cell, it will end up with 
46 chromosomes. Fertilization by 
this kind of sperm will produce a 
triploid embryo with two paternal 
sets of chromosomes and one ma- 
ternal set. The same abnormality 
can also result from double penetra- 
tion, when a second spermatozoon 
manages to enter the egg proto- 
plasm before the cortical granules 
render the ovular surface impene- 
trable. 

Tripioidy can also originate in 
the egg. As in sperm maturation, 
either the first or the second mei- 
otic division can fail, and the first or 
the second polar body will not 
form. The embryo would possess 
two maternal sets and one paternal 
set of chromosomes. 

Generally speaking, an excess of 
genetic material is less disruptive to 
an embryo than a deficiency, and 
triploid organisms usually develop 
further than haploid individuals. 
Nevertheless, the ultimate fate of 
the vast majority of triploids is abor- 
tion, often by the third month of 
pregnancy, but sometimes later. 
Chromosome counts in aborted 
embryos have indicated that as 
many as one percent of all human 
conceptuses may be triploid. A very 
occasional human triploid embryo 
develops far enough to be born at 
term. But these severely malformed 
individuals are either stillborn or 
succumb within a few hours or 
days. 

Another common type of chro- 
mosomal error at fertilization in- 
volves excess or deficiency of 
single chromosomes, so that the 
embryo contains either 47 or 45 
chromosomes. This state is known 
as aneuploidy. It can arise in an egg 
or a sperm through an aberration of 
chromosomal movement at either 
the first or second meiotic divi- 
sion or the first embryonic cleav- 
age. At all three stages, when the 
chromosomes line up preparatory 
to division, they arrange them- 
selves so that the members of each 
chromosomal pair are directed to- 
ward opposite poles of the cell. At 
division, exactly half the chromo- 
somes are included in each of the 
two new cells. Sometimes, how- 



18 



ever, the members of a particular 
chromosome pair fail to divide and 
therefore travel together to the 
same cell. This cell will then contain 
one chromosome too many, while 
the other cell will be shortchanged 
by one chromosome. Should such a 
reproductive cell eventually take 
part in fertilization, the embryo will 
also be chromosomally long or 
short. 

The 46 chromosomes of a normal 
individual are made up of 23 pairs; 
one member of each pair is derived 
from the sperm and one from the 
egg. An aneuploid embryo with 47 
chromosomes has 22 pairs and one 
triad; the extra chromosome is 
derived from the abnormal sperm 
or egg. Such embryos are called 
trisomic. The reverse aberration, 
monosomy, consists of the posses- 
sion of 22 pairs of chromosomes 
and one singleton, for a total of 45. 
As is the case with triploidy and 
haploidy, deficiency is more dele- 
terious than superabundance, and 
most monosomic embryos never 
develop far enough to permit clin- 
ical recognition of the pregnancy. 
They degenerate so early that the 
menstrual period is usually not even 
delayed. The exception is 
monosomy for the sex-determining 
chromosomes, which may result in 
either a recognized miscarriage or 
the live birth of a sterile female with 
short stature and a variety of physi- 
cal defects. Most trisomic embryos 
develop as far as the second or third 
month of pregnancy before they are 
aborted. Nevertheless, trisomy for 
a few chromosomes is compatible 
with live birth and, in some cases, 
with prolonged postnatal survival. 
Most of these individuals suffer se- 
vere physical and mental defects. 
The most common trisomic condi- 
tion is the well-known Down&apos;s syn- 
drome, or Mongolism, caused by 
trisomy for chromosome number 2 1 . 

Some more exotic types of 
chromosomal errors can also occur 
at fertilization. Studies of mouse 
eggs undergoing meiosis have 
shown that a small number of eggs 
fail to split at the first division into 
a large egg and a small polar body. 
Instead, they divide into two equal- 
sized cells, each containing one set 
of maternal chromosomes. Human 
hermaphrodites have been discov- 
ered, roughly half of whose cells 
contain a male set of chromosomes 
and half a female set. Such persons 
may have originated in the double 



BROTHER TIMOTHY&apos;S NAPA VALLEY NOTEBOOK 




How to tell the taste of 
a ^\ilite wine by its name. 

Each noble white varietal wine grape has a distinct personality and 
&apos; character that it brings to the taste of its wine. In The Christian 
Brothers Napa Valley cellars, we make our wines in such a way as to bring 
out the ultimate in these varietal characteristics. Thus, the 
name of the grape on our Napa Valley bottlings is the key 
to the taste of our wine. 

Chenin Blanc, the charming grape used in the 
Loire Valley, has developed even more of its wonderfully 
fruity quality here in the Napa Valley vineyards. Our 
bottling is a delicate balance of natural 
sweetness and dryness. This is a wine to offer with salads 
and chicken dishes. 

The Christian Brothers Pinot Chardonnay, on the 
other hand, is exquisitely dry and full-bodied. This is a 
white wine to serve at an important dinner with white 
meats or fish. It is fully matured and ready to drink when 

it leaves our cellars, but you may wish to put it down in 
your own cellar for it continues to improve in the bottle. 
A slow, cool fermentation in stainless steel cooperage 
has made our Napa Valley Johannisberg Riesling a very 
dry wine that is especially good served with ham or veal. 
These are just three of our bottlings. As with all our 
wines, they are allowed to mature at their own leisurely 
pace, and blended in our own traditional way so that each time you open a 
bottle, you will enjoy all of the goodness of the grape.

fertilization of an egg and its giant 
polar body by an X-bearing sperm 
and a Y-bearing sperm. 

All haploids, almost all triploids, 
and the majority of aneuploids are 
spontaneously aborted. However, 
some aneuploids are able to survive 
birth, and their serious physical 
and mental defects constitute a 
major financial and emotional bur- 
den to most of the families in- 
volved. For unknown reasons, the 
chance that a woman will bear a 
child with trisomy increases with 
her age. Under the age of thirty, 
the incidence of trisomy in any 
pregnancy is less than one in a 
thousand births. This climbs to one 
in two hundred by thirty-five, one in 
fifty at the age of forty, and one in 



fifteen for women of forty-five. 
Women over thirty-five produce 
only 1 5 percent of all babies, but 50 
percent of all mongoloids. Until 
recently, nothing could be done 
about this, but, thanks to the de- 
velopment of amniocentesis within 
the past few years, fetuses with 
chromosomal defects can be de- 
tected early enough in pregnancy to 
permit the gestation to be termi- 
nated. Amniocentesis can be per- 
formed about sixteen weeks after 
the mother&apos;s last menstrual period. 
In this procedure a needle is in- 
serted through the mother&apos;s abdom- 
inal wall into the amniotic sac within 
the uterus, and a small volume of 
amniotic fluid is aspirated into a 
syringe. The fluid contains cells that

have been sloughed off the fetus&apos;s

mistakes happen. Researchers have 
been able to artificially accomplish 
the complicated natural process of 
fertilization, which can take place in 
laboratory vessels as well as in 
Fallopian tubes. In vitro (literally, 
&quot;in glass&quot;) fertilization has been ac- 
complished in several animal spe- 
cies, including humans. (At this writ- 
ing scientists have just witnessed 
the birth in England of a healthy 
female, the first human to be con- 
ceived in vitro.) Meiosis and ovula- 
tion can be triggered and accurately 
timed by injections of gonadotropic 
hormones. Hence eggs can be re- 
covered from the ovary via surgical 
procedures, just prior to the time at 
which ovulation would occur. The 
egg, which has gone through the 
first meiotic division, is placed in a 
plastic dish filled with nutrient cul- 
ture medium. Then a suspension of 
sperm is pipetted into the dish, and 
for the next several hours, the mix- 
ture is maintained under strictly 
controlled conditions of atmo- 



sphere, temperature, and pH 
(alkaline-acid balance). Fertiliza- 
tion is presumed to have taken place 
when male and female pronuclei can 
be seen via the microscope. Many 
artificially fertilized eggs will divide 
and develop up to the point where 
implantation normally would occur. 
In some animal species, notably the 
mouse, these embryos have been 
placed into the uteri of hormonally 
prepared females, and some have 
implanted and been born alive as 
normal offspring. 

Experiments with animals such 
as the mouse have shown that fer- 
tilization has not evolved in an or- 
derly way at all. Presumably, the 
process would be simpler, in lower 
animals, with varying degrees of

This picture and the following letter ar- 
rived unsolicited. 

Dear Kodak: 

Thank you for inventing Kodachrome 64 
film. It saved my marriage. 

For six years I had been trying to capture 
the enclosed photo in Colorado&apos;s Rocky 
Mountain National Park. Optimum lighting 
required shooting on a clear afternoon around 
June 21, when the sun is farthest north in the 
sky. I needed freshly-fallen snow for a con- 
trasting background. I also needed a stiff 
wind blowing from the west so that, if a 
friendly large bird happened by, it could fly 
in the direction I desired. The wind would 
give the bird extra lift to fly fairly slowly. 
But too hard a gale would ground my feath- 
ered subjects. 

With a 300 mm lens, I had to maintain 
significant depth of field while shooting at a 



speed fast enough to freeze the bird&apos;s mo- 
tion. I insisted on Kodachrome film for its 
unbeatable color and absence of signifi- 
cant grain. But Kodachrome II film&apos;s ASA 
of 25 did not give me enough flexibility to 
combine all these requirements success- 
fully, despite years of futile attempts. 

After losing two previous models, I 
solved the problem of coaxing a model 
into this picture by marrying the prettiest 
rock climber I could find. But as years 
passed. Donna tired of ascending this rock. 
She could endure the bitter wind at 12,000 
feet. But the fresh snow always melted to 
refreeze as a sheet of ice over her route up 
the clifl:. And I pointed out that a protect- 
ing rope would spoil the photo&apos;s drama. 

Finally, Donna delivered an ultimatum. 
She would climb the clifl&apos; once more. If I 
did not get my picture this time, I must 
choose: give up the photo or give up her. 

I had been working on this photo for 
six years. I had been married only four. 
What choice would any dedicated photog- 
rapher make? 

But for the first time, I was using 
Kodachrome 64 film. The extra speed of 
this great film gave me the flexibility 
needed to capture at last a photo of the 
quality I had envisioned. Thank you, 
Kodak, for saving my marriage. 
Sincerely, 
Kent Dannen 
Estes Park, Colorado 

The lady, it now turns out. was help- 
ing bring in some income. We have 
purchased the right to use the picture 
to suggest to others the possibility of 
imaginative originality in family pho- 
tography, even without getting that 
close to Long&apos;s Peak, the tallest in 
Rocky Mountain National Park. Two 
additional points: 

1. Matching Mr. Dannen&apos;s enthusi- 
asm for Kodachrome film, some other 
serious photographers are just as en- 
thusiastic about Kodak Ektachrome 64, 
200. and 400 films. The latter two pro- 
vide even more speed and are less de- 
manding in their processing require- 
ments. You can even process them at 
home. Might be fun. Ask your dealer. 

2. The bird is a Clark&apos;s nutcracker 
(Nucifraga Columbiana). The species 
nests below treeline but obviously can 
be lured above it by 
memory of past rewards 
from an extended hu- 
man arm. There&apos;s a sec- 
ond on the rock. See it?

A Matter of Taste 



by Raymond Sokolov 



Shell Game 



Crayfish, along with their 
lobster kin, are highly prized 
for their delicate flesh 

Salivating in anticipation of what 
lay ahead, I recently entered a small 
restaurant on Manhattan&apos;s East 
Side, but as soon as I had had a 
moment to look around, I knew 
that something was radically wrong. 
The tank in the window was empty. 
A woebegone waitress explained 
wretchedly that last winter&apos;s severe 
weather had decimated the crayfish 
supply. This was, of course, pri- 
marily a tragedy for crayfish, but 
for the restaurant, which had just 
opened and was supposed to spe- 
cialize almost entirely in dishes fea- 
turing the delicate and flavorful 
flesh of Orconectes limosiis, it was 
also no picnic. For my part, the bad 
news was just one more ironic slap 
delivered by those malignant spirits 
who seem always to be snatching 
my favorite shellfish from my 
mouth. 

The crawdad harpies see to it that 
I arrive in New Orleans or Lyon 
just as these elusive minilobsters 



go out of season. For some un- 
known reason, crayfish, which 
abound in many American rivers, 
are harvested almost exclusively 
in Louisiana, where crawfish (as 
they are locally known) are a major 
preoccupation of life between No- 
vember and July. In New York, the 
crayfish lover must either haunt 
specialty shops or go through the 
contortions of mail ordering. There 
are other, more extreme alterna- 
tives: one can fly to Los Angeles 
for a very expensive snack of im- 
ported European crayfish (Astacus 
astaciis) at the Scandia Restaurant 
or one can go fishing. 

At any rate, I hope nearly every- 
body will, at some time or other, 
have a chance to taste or to cook 
crayfish, that is, if we do not have 
a repeat of last winter. Assuming 
normal weather and the continua- 
tion of a form of life that goes back 
in time to at least the Jurassic 
Period, we stand at the brink of 
gastronomic opportunity. We must 
prepare our minds for that day 
when crayfish swim into our ken by 
looking closely at what is known 




about them, as creatures and as 
food. 

Zoologists classify crayfish 
among the arthropod invertebrates 
in the crustacean class, which 
means that they are distantly re- 
lated to spiders and scorpions but 
more closely and obviously con- 
nected with such invertebrate, 
water-breathing, segmented ani- 
mals — with hard outer carapaces 
and two antennae — as lobsters, 
shrimps, and crabs. These large, 
edible crustaceans are grouped in 
the order Decapoda because they 
have five pairs of appendages 
arrayed on either side of the thorax 
(the middle segment, between the 
head and tail). Sometimes the pair 
closest to the head develop into 
claws, or pincers, called chelae. 
There are some 8,500 species of 
decapods, which makes them as 
various in their evolutionary adap- 
tation as birds. 

Despite all this diversity, deca- 
pods are similar enough for the 
commonly eaten varieties to be fre- 
quently confused with each other. 
Their vernacular names are a 
tangled web of etymologically re- 
lated terms that usually predate 
scientific observation. The word 
crayfish, for example, is the Eng- 
lish reflex of the French ecrevisse, 
which in turn derives from an 
ancestral term that appears in Old 
High German as krehiz. or &quot;crab.&quot; 
Crawfish is not only an American 
regional form of crayfish but is also 
applied to the so-called spiny lob- 
sters (family Palinuridae), which 
lack large claws, have antennae 
longer than their bodies, exhibit 
spiny processes on the carapace, 
and are also known as sea crayfish 
(although they may grow almost 
twice as long as the European cray- 
fish&apos;s maximum of ten inches) and 
langoustes. Langouste derives from 
the Latin locusta. which the 
Romans applied both to locusts and 
lobsters. Lobster itself also de- 
scends from locusta, a confusion

Faithfully re 





that is easy to understand, just as 
it is not too hard to see why the 
deepwater hmgoiistine, or langos- 
tino (Nephrops norvegicus), which 
has pincers, but grows smaller in 
body size than the langouste, is also 
known as the king, or Norway, 
lobster. 

For the gastronome, these over- 
lapping misnomers actually make a 
certain amount of common sense, 
since, to the taste buds, there is a 
general family relationship between 
the highly prized muscle tissue of 
the claws and tails (abdomens) of all 
the edible decapods. They taste dif- 
ferent, of course, but their overall 
similarity makes it perfectly feasible 
to interchange one decapod with 
another in recipes. If the cook pays 
attention to obvious variations in 
cooking times required for, say, 
crayfish and lobsters, it is not only 
possible but traditional to prepare 
them in conceptually identical ways 
— in bisques, boiled, and so on. (In 
many cases, crabs and shrimps can 
also be substituted for their fellow 
crustaceans.) 

Nevertheless, I feel sure that 
in a blind tasting I could distinguish 
the meat of these kindred arthro- 
pods from slight differences in tex- 
ture, size, flavor, and grain. But I 
doubt that, their different lengths 
aside, I or anyone else could tell 
apart, by palate alone, the short 
(maximum five inch) American 
crayfish from its European cousin. 
Ecologically, however, the two 
species are crucially distinct. The 
European crayfish is extremely 
sensitive to pollution, requires very 
clean water, feeds at night on plant 
and animal material, and otherwise 
hides in holes in river banks. The 
American crayfish is much hardier, 
can withstand dirty water, feeds 
round the clock, and does not bur- 
row. Most important of all, the 
American crayfish is immune to 
crab plague, the fungus that nearly 
extirpated Astacus astaciis starting 
in 1870 and continues to infect the 
effete Old World decapod to this 
day. OrcDiu&apos;cics liiuosiis was suc- 
cessfully introduced into European 
rivers in 1890 and still flourishes. 

Even if someone could convince 
me that one type was superior to 
the other, I would still be delighted 
to come by a supply of either kind. 
I would not mind the tedium of 
shelling several dozen little tails. I 
would happily pull apart fifty to a 
hundred young crayfish to produce

a cup of meat. And with machines 
that do the job of mortar and pestle, 
I don&apos;t need prepicked crayfish fat 
(a convenience food extracted from 
the heads in Louisiana and sold 
frozen as a substitute for pounded 
shells in making sauces) to coax me 
into cooking crayfish. 

1 do know one shortcut that I will 
be glad to use. It avoids the tradi- 
tional method of removing the cray- 
fish&apos;s tiny, filthy gut. Old French 
recipes insist that you pull out, 
&quot;castrate,&quot; this offending organ 
with a knife, just before cooking 
and while the crustacean is still 
alive. Today, the French chefs Paul 
Bocuse and Michel Guerard put 
crayfish in skim milk for twelve 
hours before cooking them, and 
the crayfish purge themselves. If 
the tails are eventually served 
shelled, it is easy to remove the 
guts by pinching them between 
thumb and forefinger and pulling 
them out starting at the top, or head 
end, of the tail. 

Otherwise, crayfish cuisine 
comes down to two basic tech- 
niques that resemble the two funda- 
mental approaches to lobster. You 
can plunge crayfish into boiling 
water or you can saute them. 

Boiling can be utterly simple. 
The water need only be salted. But 
the two leading crayfish regions, 
France and New Orleans, have de- 
veloped their own, more sophisti- 
cated flavoring methods. The 
French method, called a la nage 
(&quot;swimming&quot;), uses a court bouil- 
lon: a cooked broth of vegetables, 
seasonings, and wine (see recipe 
below). New Orleans follows more 
or less the same procedure, but the 
court bouillon is much spicier and 
does not involve wine. Standard 
cooking times in both versions are 
ten to twelve minutes. Overcooking 
toughens the flesh. But letting the 
finished crayfish &quot;relax&quot; for a few 
minutes at room temperature 
tenderizes it still further. 

Boiled crayfish lend themselves 
to many other uses, such as 
garnishes for other dishes or served 
cold en huisson. which is to say, 
impaled by their tails on a special 
tiered metal device that when fully 
loaded with crayfish looks like a 
pink, dodecapodal bush. 

Sauteing crayfish can be more 
cumbersome than boiling. It also 
forces you to fry a living crus- 
tacean, but at least you do not have 
to slice the crayfish crosswise

beforehand the way you must slice 
a lobster before sauteing it. Cray- 
fish are smaller and go into the pan 
whole. The end, at any rate, comes 
quickly, and who is to say that 
crayfish bordelaise (sauteed with 
finely chopped vegetables in butter, 
then flamed in white wine and 
cognac) is not a more noble end for 
a crayfish than twenty years of 
skulking in riparian burrows or 
scuttling along polluted stream bot- 
toms until it dies of natural causes? 

Sauteed crayfish can also be 
sublimated into crayfish Nantua by 
reserving the tail meat and using 
the shells and other debris to make 
a brilliant red-orange sauce (pulver- 
ize shells and debris, force through 
a fine strainer, and combine with 
bechamel). 

New Orleans fills crepes with 
sauteed crayfish or stuffs crayfish 
shells with chopped, sauteed meat 
or bakes it in a pie. France, typ- 
ically, puts crayfish into mousses 
and souffles, compound butters, 
and bisques. 

The latest wrinkle in French 
crayfish cookery comes from the 
genius of the &quot;new cuisine,&quot; 
Michel Guerard, and it is so com- 
plex it will make you smile at the 
nouvelle cuisine&apos;s claims of sim- 
plicity. Basically, Guerard takes 
cooked crayfish tails and wraps 
them inside very thin slices of bass 
so as to make tiny bundles, which 
are then briefly baked in a tomato- 
crayfish sauce and served sur- 
rounded by a floral pattern made 
with blanched leaves of Brussels 
sprouts. You would hardly think 
that such an exquisitely refined dish 
began as a ten-legged creature 
foraging in a turbid creek. 

Crayfish (or Lobster) a la Nage, 
Michel Guerard 

2 medium carrots, scraped and cut 

in thin rounds 
1 leek, only the white part, cut in 

thin rounds 

1 celery rib, sliced crosswise 

4 small white onions, peeled and 

sliced 

2 shallots, peeled and sliced 

5 cups water 

2 tablespoons kosher salt 

5 lemon peels 

2 unpeeled garlic cloves 
25 green peppercorns 

1 whole clove 

A bouquet garni — 6 parsley 
sprigs, !/2 bay leaf, 1 small 



fresh fennel stalk, and 1 sprig 

of thyme tied together 
1 cup dry white wine 
20 crayfish weighing about 2 

ounces each (or 1 five 2-pound 

lobster) 
I tablespoon freshly chopped 

parsley 

1. Put the carrot, leek, celery, 
onion, and shallot slices in a 
large stainless steel pot. Add the 
water, salt, lemon peels, cloves, 
green peppercorns, whole clove, 
and bouquet garni. 

2. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and 
simmer uncovered, very gently 
so that the water merely shud- 
ders, for 30 minutes. The vege- 
tables should remain a bit firm. 

3. Pour in the white wine, boil for 
30 seconds. Discard the bouquet 
garni. Let cool and reserve until 
you are ready to cook the shell- 
fish. (This court bouillon can be 
stored in the refrigerator and 
reused several times for boiling 
shellfish, so long as you reboil it 
every few days.) 

4. When you are ready to prepare 
the shellfish, bring the court 
bouillon to a boil, uncovered. 

5. If you are using lobster, crack 
the claws with the back of a 
heavy knife to facilitate remov- 
ing the meat after cooking. 

6. Plunge the crayfish (or lobster) 
into the boiling court bouillon. 
The crayfish will be done in 2 
minutes. The lobster will take 14. 
(Guerard believes in slightly 
undercooking crayfish and lob- 
sters. Make sure yours are at 
room temperature if you follow 
these directions. Conventional 
times would be 10 to 12 minutes 
for crayfish, 20 for the lobster.) 

7. Drain the crayfish and pile them 
in a bowl. Sprinkle with parsley. 
Or split the lobster lengthwise 
with a large knife. Remove the 
claws and take the meat out of 
the shell. Remove the intestinal 
pouch from the lobster&apos;s head 
and discard. Arrange the lobster 
pieces on a serving platter. 
Cover them with vegetables 
from the court bouillon. Moisten 
with a cup of cooking liquid. 
Sprinkle with parsley. 

Yield: Two servings

ONE OF THESE CAMERAS WAS MADE 

JUST FOR YOU. 
HERE&apos;S HOW TO TELL WHICH ONE. 



If you&apos;ve considered buying a 35mm sin- 
gle lens reflex camera, you may have 
wondered how to find the right one out 
of the bewildering array of models and 
features available. 

And you have gcxxi reason to wonder, 
since the camera you choose will have a 
lot to do with how creative and reward- 
ing your photography will be. 

Of course, what you pay for your 
camera is important. But it shouldn&apos;t be 
your only consideration, especially since 
there are very expensive cameras 




and shoot simplicity. TTic difference is in 
the kind ot creative control you get. 

For landscapes, still lifes, portraits and 
the like, you&apos;ll want an apenure-priortty 
camera. It lets you set the lens opening, 
while it sets the shutter speed automati- 
cally. 

This way, you control depth-of-field. 
That&apos;s the area of sharpness in front of 
and behind your subject. Many profes- 
sional photographers believe that depth- 
of-field is the single most important 






Minolta make.s all kinds of 35nun SLR&apos;s, 

so our main concern is that you get 

exactly the right camera for your needs. 

Whether that means the advanced 

Minolta XD-11. Or the easy-to-use and 

moderately priced Minolta XG-7. Or the very&apos; economical Minolta SR-T cameras. 




the lens opening automatically. 

Minolta makes both types of auto- 
matic camera. TTie Minolta XG-7 is 
moderately priced and offers aperture- 
priority automation, plus fully manual 
control. The Minolta XD-11 is some- 
what more expensive, but it offers 
both aperture and shutter-priority auto- 
mation, plus full manual. The XD-1 1 
is so advanced that during shutter- 
priority operation it will actually make 
exposure corrections you fail to make.

that won&apos;t give you some of the 
features you really need. So before 
you think about price, ask yourself how 
you&apos;ll be using the camera and what 
kind of pictures you&apos;ll be taking. Your 
answers could save a lot of money. 
How automaric 
should your camera be? 
Basically, there are two kinds of auto- 
matic 35mm SLR&apos;s. Both make use of 
advanced electronics to give you per- 
fectly exposed pictures with point, focus 



liwfr^ 



factor in creative photography. 

At times you may want to control the 
motion of your subject for creative 
effect. You can do this with an aperture- 
priority camera by changing the lens 
opening until the camera sets the shutter 
speed necessary to freeze or blur a mo\&apos;- 
ing subject. Or you can use a shuttCT- 
prioricy camera, on which you set the 
shutter speed first and the camera sets 







Do vou really need an 
automatic camera? 

Without a doubt, automation makes 
fine photography easier. But if you&apos;re 
willing to do some ot the work yourself 
you can save a lot ot money and get pic- 
tures that are every bit as good. 

In this case, you might consider a 
Minolta SR-I^ These are semi-automatic 
cameras. They have built-in, through- 
the-lens metering systems that tell you 
exactly how to set the lens and shutter 
for perfect exposure. You just 
align two indicators in the 
viewfinder. 

What should you expect 

when vou look into 
the camera&apos;s viewfinder? 
The finder should, ot course, 
giN-e you a clear, bright view of 



.Automatic sequence photography 
is easy when \ou comhine a Minolta 
XO-l 1 or \G-7 with optional Auto 
Winder and Electroflash 200X. 



Specifications subfect to cttange without notice 



your subject. Not just in the center, but 
even along the edges and in the comers. 
All Minolta SLR&apos;s have bright view- 
finders, so that composing and focusing 
are effortless, even in dim light. And 
with a Minolta there&apos;s never a question 
about focusing. You&apos;ll find focusing 
aids in every Minolta 35mm SLR view- 
finder that make it 
easy to take criti- 
cally sharp pictures. 

Information is 
another thing you 
can expect to find 
in a well-designed 
viewfinder. Minolta 
believes that you 
should never have 
to look away from 
the finder in order 
to make camera 
adjustments. So 
everything you need 
to know for a perfect picture is right 
there in a Minolta finder 

In the Minolta XD-11 and XG-7, 
red light emitting diodes tell you 
what lens opening or shutter speed is 
being set automatically and warn against 
under or over-exposure. In Minolta 
SR-T cameras, there are two pointers 
which come together as you adjust the 
lens and shutter for correct exposure. 
Do you need an auto winder? 
If you like the idea of sequence photog- 
raphy, or simply want the luxury of 
power assisted film advancing, an auto 
winder may be for you. Minolta auto 
winders will advance one picture at a 
time, or continuously at about two pic- 
tures per second. And they give you 
advantages not found in others, like up 
to 50% more pictures with a set of bat- 
teries and easy attachment to the camera 
without removing any caps. Optional 
auto winders are available for both the 
Minolta XD-11 and XG-7, but not for 
Minolta SR-T cameras. 

How about electronic flash? 
An automatic electronic flash can be 
combined with any Minolta SLR for 
easy, just about foolproof indoor pho- 
tography without the bother of flash- 
bulbs. For the XD-11 and XG-7, 
Minolta makes the Auto Electroflash 
200X. It sets itself automatically for cor- 
rect flash exposure, and it sets the cam- 
era automatically for use with flash. An 
LED in the viewfinder tells when the 
200X is ready to fire. Most unusual: the 
Auto Electroflash 2CX)X can 
fire continuously in perfect 
synchronization with Minolta 
auto winders. Imagine being 
cfi a sequence of 36 



flash pictures without ever taking your 
finger off the button. 

You should be comfortable 
with your camera. 
The way a camera feels in your hands 
and responds to your commands can 
make a big difference in the way you 
take pictures. 




The match-needle viewfinder: just ali^n 
two indicators for correct exposure. 
Because you&apos;re doing some of the \vori&lt;, 
you can save some money. 



The electronic viewfinder: light emitting 
diodes tell you what the camera is 
doing automatically to give you correct 
exposure. 



The Minolta XD-1 1 and XG-7, for 
instance, are compact, but not cramped. 
Lightweight, but with a solid feeling of 
quality. Controls are oversized and posi- 
tioned so that your fingers fall naturally 
into place. And the electronically con- 
trolled shutters in these advanced auto- 
matic cameras are incredibly smooth 
and quiet. 

Minolta SR-T&apos;s give you the heft and 
weight of a slightly larger camera, but 
with no sacrifice in handling conve- 
nience. As in all Minolta SLR&apos;s, &quot;human 
engineering&quot; insures smooth, effortless 
operation. 

Are extra features important? 
If you&apos;re going to use them, there are 
a lot of extras that can make your ^~ 
photography more creative S-T 

and convenient. 
Depending on the 
Minolta model you 
choose, you can 
select from a num- 
ber of special fea- 
tures. For instance, 
some models let you 
take multiple expo- 
sures with pushbutton ease 
(even with an auto winder). 
Other available extras include a 
window to show that film is 
advancing properly, a handy 
memo holder that holds the end 
of a film box to remind you of 
what film you&apos;re using, and a self-timer 
that delays the release of the shutter 



so you can get into your own pictures. 
&apos;What about the lens system? 

Just about every 35mm SLR has a lens 
&quot;system.&quot; But it&apos;s important to know 
what the system contains. It should be 
big enough to satisfy your needs, not 
only today, but five years from today. 

There are almost 40 
interchangeable 
lenses available for 
Minolta SLR&apos;s, 
ranging from 
7.5mm fisheye to 
1600mm super-tele- 
photo, including 
macro and zoom 
lenses and the 
smallest 500mm 
lens in the world. 
And since inter- 
changeable lenses 
should be easy to 
change, the 
patented Minolta bayonet mount lets 
you remove or attach them with less 
than a quarter turn. 

What&apos;s next? 
After you&apos;ve thought about how you&apos;ll 
be using your camera, ask your photo 
dealer to let you try a Minolta. Handle 
the camera for yourself Examine its fea- 
tures and the way Minolta has paid close 
attention to even the smallest details. 
And by all means, compare it with other 
cameras in its price range. You&apos;ll soon 
see why more Americans buy Minolta 
than any other brand of SLR. For litera-

The Politics of Black 
Power Handshakes 



by John Baugh 



Deciding when to use this 
in-group grasp may be more 
complicated than performing 
the grasp itself 

The scene is a public swimming 
pool in a black working-class neigh- 
borhood in Los Angeles, on the 
opening day of the summer season. 
The staff members, some black 
from the local community and some 
white from other communities, are 
making and reestablishing acquaint- 
ances. In a typical reunion, two 
black staff members greet each 
other with this dialogue: 

Howard: &quot;Hey babe, what&apos;s hap- 
pening? It&apos;s been a while.&quot; 

Douglas: &quot;Well, you know how 
it is. Always slow and not enough 
dough.&quot; 

Howard: &quot;I heard that.&quot; 



While they talk, Howard and 
Douglas use the black power hand- 
shake, which, in this neighborhood, 
consists of three separate grasps 
executed in rapid order. 

A white staff member, Dave, 
then approaches. He lives outside 
the local community, and neither 
Howard nor Douglas knows him. 
They greet him with some hesita- 
tion: 

Dave: &quot;Hi, I&apos;m Dave.&quot; 

Howard: &quot;How you feeling, my 
man? I&apos;m Howard — and — and 
this here is Douglas.&quot; 

Douglas (nodding toward Dave 
in recognition): &quot;What&apos;s happen- 
ing?&quot; 

Dave: &quot;Not much. Tell me, have 
you guys ever worked here be- 
fore?&quot; 

Dave offers his hand to Howard 



for a black power handshake, with 
his forearm vertical. But Howard 
raises his arm, with the forearm 
horizontal, and grasps Dave&apos;s hand 
in the traditional, standard hand- 
shake. When they release hands, 
Dave offers his hand to Douglas at 
hip level for the standard hand- 
shake, which Douglas returns quite 
naturally. 

In American society, as well as 
throughout many of the world&apos;s 
cultures, the handshake is a display 
of solidarity and ritualized access in 
most everyday, face-to-face en- 
counters. A handshake takes place 
after two people acknowledge each 
other, move close together, and 
execute a series of verbal and/or 
gestural cues. Either individual 
may initiate the handshake. 

Like spoken or sign language, a 




Several types of nonstandard handshakes are exchanged in this 
gathering in a Los Angeles park.

Voice in the Wilderness 



&quot;Some people say j . 
we need more Wilderness, 
but you can go for 15 days 
in this area without seeing 
another person.&quot; r^ 

Bob Rears understands the Wilderness as few 
people do. He spends much of his free time 
backpacking in Idaho&apos;s forests. 

&quot;When I&apos;m not teaching school or spending 
time with my family, I come up here just to be

And alone is what Bob often is. In Idaho&apos;s 
vast Wilderness areas, he can go for weeks at a. 
time without seeing another soul. 

In an effort to measure the attitudes of 
people who, like Bob Rears, live close to the 
Wilderness, the Idaho Forest Council inter- 
viewed residents of the state last year. 

They found that 72% of the general public 
^■questioned felt there was no need to expand 
■ • Jdaho&apos;s Wilderness (about 14% of Idaho&apos;s 
national forestland).*This is the opinion of 
people living in a timber-rich state.

handshake has a meaning trans- 
mitted in a clear, defined way, with 
its own &quot;grammatical&quot;&quot; structure. 
Hand-to-eye gestures, in which one 
person sees and interprets the offer 
of a hand by another person, can be 
articulated and decoded in much 
the same way as mouth-to-ear utter- 
ances. And just as conversation 
requires knowledge of a common 
language, handshakes require 
knowledge of shared norms. 

Recently, many black Americans 
have developed and used elaborate 
new handshakes that demonstrate 
solidarity under special circum- 
stances. The use of exclusionary 
handshakes is by no means a radical 
or new phenomenon. Fraternal or- 
ganizations have often devised in- 
group handshakes, some of which 
are secret. What makes the black 
power handshake so interesting is 
that its use has extended well be- 
yond a small group to the point of 
being politicized. 

This handshake is used contin- 
ually in public by many blacks, and 
it has been exposed through the 
mass media and spectator sports to 
whites who have had little contact 
with Afro-Americans. Some whites 
use the black power handshake 
in their more intimate circles as 
a symbol of group cohesiveness. 

More difficult than performing an 
elaborate in-group handshake is 
knowing when to use it. This deci- 
sion can place special demands on 
the participants. At the pool, two 
old friends, the blacks Howard and 
Douglas, used the black power 
handshake as a public display of 
solidarity and intimacy. But when 
they met Dave, in a situation in 
which the criteria of familiarity and 
racial homogeneity were not met, 
they used the standard handshake. 



During a four-year period, I ob- 
served and analyzed more than six 
hundred handshakes performed at 
the Los Angeles municipal pool 
where Howard, Douglas, and Dave 
worked. (These names are pseudo- 
nyms.) At least one participant in 
each handshake was a resident of 
the local black community. The 
exchanges cited earlier were typical 
of the patterns that developed. In 
general, insiders greeted each other 
with the black power handshake 
and they greeted outsiders with the 
standard handshake. Yet the deci- 
sion was not always that cut and 
dried. Sometimes, deciding which 
handshake to use demanded quick 
judgment. For people who actively 
employed more than one hand- 
shake style, each occurrence of this 
social ritual required a definition of 
the situation — a decision about 
which norm satisfied the immediate 
social requirements. 

The use of handshakes between 
two antagonists, formerly friends, 
illustrates how involved this deci- 
sion may be. Richie and TJ, con- 
sidered to be friendly, had been 
assigned to seats at the same table 
at a wedding reception. Yet they 
were no longer friends. Richie had 
been dating Diane, but Diane be- 
came interested in TJ, whom she 
began to date on the sly. As is often 
the case, Richie was one of the last 
to know about Diane&apos;s change of 
heart. He lost face and subse- 
quently became the subject of mild 
ridicule. To complicate matters, 
rivalry between Richie and TJ was 
not new, since they had been on the 
same football and track teams in 
high school. Diane eventually 
broke off with Richie and began to 
talk openly about the possibility of 
marrying TJ.

Notionol Audubon Society 



Eight young black adults, includ- 
ing Richie and TJ, gathered around 
the table at the wedding reception. 
All five men, with the exception of 
the two rivals, exchanged the black 
power handshake when they 
greeted each other. When Richie 
and TJ used the standard hand- 
shake with hesitation, and when 
their smiles turned to solemn, pene- 
trating glances, the other guests 
became alerted to the antagonism. 
In the context of the social situa- 
tion, in which use of the black 
power handshake was common, 
exchange of the standard hand- 
shake by two persons assumed to 
be friends indicated that something 
had gone awry in their relation- 
ship. This changing of norms might 
be the equivalent of one man refus- 
ing to shake hands with another 
man in a white, middle-class gath- 
ering. 

The two examples I have pro- 
vided illustrate how a choice of 
handshakes is made in meetings 
between friends, strangers, and 
enemies. But what does use of the 
black power handshake mean in 
more complex situations involving 
blacks and whites? Once just an 
expression of solidarity within 
black cliques, the black power 
handshake now serves a much 
broader population as well. Its use 
in different situations by white and 
black staflF members at the pool 
reflects the politicization of the 
black power handshake and its ef- 
fect on interracial relations. 

Carl was a 22-year-old white life- 
guard from outside the community 
and was fairly well-to-do compared 
with most of the local blacks. Ron- 
ald was a 28-year-old black com- 
munity aide at the pool. Until re- 
cently unemployed, Ronald acted 
as a mediator iDetween the black 
users of the pool and the staff of 
predominantly white lifeguards. 
Although his job required consider- 
ably more physical work than was 
demanded of a lifeguard, Ronald&apos;s 
salary was much lower than Carl&apos;s. 

Carl had contacts with people 
who could provide audio equipment 
at exceptionally low prices. After 
news of this &quot;connection&quot; spread 
by word-of-mouth, some of the 
young black men in the local com- 
munity reluctantly began to ap- 
proach him about arranging for 
purchases. At first, Carl appeared 
not to be interested since he did 
not want his access to stolen stereo 



equipment widely publicized, but 
when Ronald offered to serve as a 
middleman, Carl agreed. The first 
test of the arrangement came when 
Ronald asked for a car stereo for 
his own use. Expecting used equip- 
ment, Ronald was delighted when 
Carl delivered a brand new unit. 
Ronald offered the black power 
handshake to Carl and said, &quot;We 
got the making of a real good thing 
here.&quot; Carl smiled and nodded in 
agreement as they shook hands. 
Ronald then began to distribute the 
equipment, upping the price so he 
made a modest profit. 

Ronald continued to use the 
black power handshake when he 
greeted Carl, once in front of two 
other black men from the local 
community who were also inter- 
ested in the audio equipment. Each 
of Ronald&apos;s friends initiated the 
black power handshake when they 
met Carl, presumably as a gesture 
of good will. Sometimes Ronald in- 
vited Carl to stop by his house 
after work, and Carl accepted at 
least twice. In all, I observed the 
two exchanging black power hand- 
shakes eight times, generally at a 
sale of stereo equipment. 

From Ronald&apos;s point of view, 
these handshakes helped to main- 
tain good will in the business rela- 
tionship. Carl, however, could 
easily have interpreted these ges- 
tures of good will as signs of per- 
sonal friendship. As it turned out, 
conflicts arose because of Carl&apos;s 
misinterpretation of his relationship 
with Ronald. 

One day, Ronald and two of 
Carl&apos;s black customers were loung- 
ing with some friends in the shade 
of a tree on a patch of grass near the 
pool parking lot, &quot;sipping wine and 
killing time.&quot; Carl nonchalantly 
approached and asked for a glass of 
wine. In the group were several 
men who did not know Carl at all, 
including one man who recently 
had been released from county jail, 
where racial boundaries are never 
crossed. These men simply did not 
acknowledge Carl&apos;s presence. Ron- 
ald and the other customers 
snubbed Carl as well. Carl then 
confronted Ronald directly and 
asked, &quot;What&apos;s happening?&quot; The 
blacks remained silent. Carl then 
said, &quot;Hey, Ronald, what&apos;s hap- 
pening?&quot; 

Ronald (in a monotone): &quot;Ain&apos;t 
nothing happening.&quot;

ance named D): &quot;Is it okay if I have 
a sip of your wine?&quot; 

D (hesitating): &quot;Well uh, uh, 
Y&apos;see— t&apos;tell — t&apos;tell you the truth, 
I really don&apos;t know — [raising his 
voice and smiling] besides — it just 
ain&apos;t sanitary and shit to go drinking 
behind people, specially when you 
don&apos;t know where they been putting 
their mouths.&quot; 

The group laughed while they 
poured wine for each other. 

Ronald: &quot;Naw, man — it don&apos;t 
look like we got enough to go round 
— You know how it is with poor 
folks, you got to sip it slow and 
make it last.&quot; 

The group continued to laugh 
while Carl, eyes downward, turned 
and walked away. Carl no doubt 
felt betrayed. In his relationship 
with Ronald and the other two cus- 
tomers, he had never before en- 
countered the apparent hostility 
that the group had just directed at 
him. 

From that point forward, Ronald 
ignored Carl, which only accentu- 
ated the difficulties caused by 
Carl&apos;s misplaced familiarity, and 
which probably added to Carl&apos;s 
sense of being betrayed. Carl&apos;s un- 
happiness carried over into work. 
Eventually, the pool manager 
called the two in to discuss their 
bad feeling and the detrimental 
impact the conflict was having on 
the other workers. Both men denied 
that any such problem existed. 

Ronald: &quot;Naw, man, me and 
Carl is tight, ain&apos;t we?&quot; 

Carl: &quot;Yeah, we&apos;ve been friends 
all summer long. I don&apos;t know 
where you got the idea something 
was wrong.&quot; 

Boss: &quot;I got it from the way you 
two have been acting. Listen, if 
you&apos;re friends or enemies makes no 
difference to me, but if you&apos;re on 
this job, I don&apos;t want to see or feel 
any tension.&quot; 

Ronald: &quot;No way, we&apos;ve been 
getting along good.&quot; 

Carl: &quot;Yeah, right.&quot; 

Ronald rose from his chair and 
walked over to shake hands with 
Carl — using the standard hand- 
shake. 

Boss: &quot;Okay, then, but I don&apos;t 
expect this staflF to fall apart. When 
you&apos;re on the job, you work to- 
gether, because if you can&apos;t we&apos;ll 
have to consider some unpleasant 
alternatives.&quot; 

Ronald: &quot;You don&apos;t got a thing 
to worry about.&quot; 



Boss: &quot;Oh, I&apos;m not worried. You 
can believe that.&quot; 

The boss turned to his paper work 
and Ronald and Carl left. 

Here, Ronald used the standard 
handshake for much the same rea- 
son that Richie and TJ used it at the 
wedding reception: the gesture was 
made in appeasement, to defuse 
the situation. However, the hand- 
shake did not end the misunder- 
standing. Tensions continued be- 
tween the two men, and the audio 
equipment transactions ended. 

Although every handshake has its 
own individuality, owing to the 
great variety of people greeting each 
other in many different social situa- 
tions, there appear to be common 
forces working on people who have 
a choice of handshakes to use. Ex- 
change of the black power hand- 
shake demonstrates an especially 
strong personal or circumstantial 
bond both to the participants them- 
selves and to any observers. Use of 
the more common standard hand- 
shake does not signify such a strong 
relationship, and the standard 
handshake is used much less selec- 
tively than is the black power hand- 
shake. 

Allegiance to a group may be 
confirmed or denied by the use or 
disuse of a particular handshake, as 
Carl&apos;s experience indicates. Once 
nonmembers start to use a special 
handshake, however, the grip loses 
its potency as a symbol. This is why 
the politicization of the black power 
handshake, which has spread well 
beyond the Afro-American commu- 
nity, has led to the invention of 
increasingly expressive and even 
more elaborate handshakes. In 
many ways, the development of 
handshakes is similar to the use of 
slang words, which, as social situa- 
tions change, are invented, dis- 
seminated, dropped from the ver- 
nacular, and then rediscovered. 

Since few other human rituals 
provide such highly articulated and 
observable mutual behavior, the 
study of handshakes might help us 
to identify ongoing changes in the 
norms of various cultures. The 
existing evidence suggests that 
handshakes serve important func- 
tions in American society. In the 
community that I studied, the 
choice of handshakes symbolized 
and directly affected personal rela- 
tionships of at least seven people. 
The indirect effect was probably 
much greater. D

than any previous Nikon, it conveys the 
unmistakable feel of Nikon precision. You 
become quickly aware of its pet feet balance 
in your hands and of its swift, smooth 
responsiveness -c/uali ties that make the FM 
a joy to handle. You can rely on the accuracy 
of its electronic exposure control system with 
its advanced, super-sensitive gallium photo 
diodes, which reduces correct exposure 
setting to near-foolproof simplicity. Arid, 
as you sight through the big, brilliant 
viewfinden you feel the confidence that 
inspires Nikon users in their pursuit of ,^ 
photography at its finest. • 



You will find your confidence fully borne 
out hy the wide-ranging, yet easy to use 
capabilities built into the Nikon FM and by 
the magnificent image c/uality of its Nikkor 
lens. And, these capabilities are easily 
expanded by the famous Nikon .system which 
puts more than fifty-five lenses and hundreds 
of accessories, including a motor drive, at 
your disposal. 

The Nikon FM is one modern classic that 
is easy to afford. Let your Nikon dealer put 
one into your hands (you&apos;ll find him in the 
Yellow Pages). Ask him also about the

In Bell&apos;s &quot;Photophone,&quot; sunlight 
was bounced from a reflector through 
a lens to a mechanism that vibrated in 
response to speech. This caused the 
light beam to vary in intensity. At the 
receiving end, a selenium detector 
translated these variations into 
electrical current to recreate speech 
through a telephone receiver. 



11 years before we 
invented the laser, 
Professor Bell had a 
perfect application for it 



In 1880, only four years after 
he invented the telephone, 
Alexander Graham Bell received 
a patent for a remarkable idea — 
using light, rather than wire, 
to carry phone calls. 

Professor Bell built an experi- 
mental &quot;Photophone&quot; that 
transmitted his voice over a 
beam of sunlight. It didn&apos;t work 
very well, however. 

Sunbeams are scattered by 
air, rain and fog. In any event, 
the sun doesn&apos;t always shine. 
The Photophone, unfortunately, 
was an idea whose time had not 
yet come. 

A new kind of light 

By the 1950&apos;s, scientists again 
were looking for a way to use 
light for communications. 

In September, 1957, Charles 
Townes, a Bell Labs consultant, 
and Bell Labs scientist Arthur 
Schawlow conceived a way of 
producing a new kind of light — 
extremely intense, highly direc- 
tional, and capable of carrying 
immense amounts of information. 

Townes and Schawlow 
received a basic patent on their 



invention — the laser. 

Since then. Bell Labs scien- 
tists have invented hundreds 
of lasers, including many firsts — 
gas and solid-state lasers capable 
of continuous operation, high- 
power carbon dioxide lasers, 
liquid dye lasers that produce 
pulses shorter than a trillionth 
of a second, and tiny semi- 
conductor lasers that work 
reliably at normal temperatures. 
Some of these, no larger than 
grains of salt, may emit light 
continuously for 100 years. 

Getting the light to the 
end of the tunnel 

While we were developing 
lasers to generate light, we also 
looked for a way of shielding it 
and guiding it for long distances 
and around curves. 

Extremely transparent glass 
fibers, perfected at Bell Labs 
and elsewhere, provide the 
answer. These hair-thin fibers 
can carry light many miles 
without distortion or the need 
for amplification. 

In 1977, the Bell System took 
lightwave communications out 



of the laboratory and put it to 
work under the streets of down- 
town Chicago. The system, the 
first to carry phone calls, 
computer data, and video signals 
on pulses of light, is working 
successfully. 

Spin-off 

Laser light is now used in 
many other ways — to perform 
delicate eye surgery, detect air 
pollution, read product codes 
at supermarket checkouts, and 
do a variety of manufacturing 
tasks. Western Electric, the 
Bell System&apos;s manufacturing 
and supply unit, was the first 
company to put the laser to 
industrial use back in 1965. 
Hundreds of applications in 
many industries have followed. 

Sometimes, it takes a lot of 
work and a long time to make a 
bright idea — like Professor 
Bell&apos;s — a reality. Often, the 
things we invent, such as the 
laser, benefit not only Bell System 
customers, but society in general.

Women&apos;s Brains 



Biological measurements of 
intelligence are &quot;irrelevant 
and highly injurious&quot; 

In the prelude to Middlemarch, 
George Eliot lamented the unful- 
filled lives of talented women: 

Some have felt that these blundering 
lives are due to the inconvenient in- 
definiteness with which the Supreme 
Power has fashioned the natures of 
women: if there were one level of 
feminine incompetence as strict as the 
ability to count three and no more, the 
social lot of women might be treated 
with scientific certitude. 

Eliot goes on to discount the idea 
of innate limitation, but while she 
wrote in 1872, the leaders of Euro- 
pean anthropometry were trying to 
measure &quot;with scientific certitude&quot; 
the inferiority of women. An- 
thropometry, or measurement of 
the human body, is not so fashion- 
able a field these days, but it domi- 
nated the human sciences for much 
of the nineteenth century and re- 
mained popular until intelligence 
testing replaced skull measurement 
as a favored device for making in- 
vidious comparisons among races, 
classes, and sexes. Craniometry, or 
measurement of the skull, com- 
manded the most attention and re- 
spect. Its unquestioned leader, 
Paul Broca (1824-80), professor of 
clinical surgery at the Faculty of 
Medicine in Paris, gathered a 
school of disciples and imitators 
around himself. Their work, so 
meticulous and apparently irrefut- 
able, exerted great influence and 
gained a high reputation as a jewel 
of nineteenth-century science. 

In 1861, an epochal debate ex- 
tended over several meetings of the 
Anthropological Society of Paris, 



founded two years earlier by Broca. 
Louis Pierre Gratiolet read a paper 
denying that brain size played a 
measurable role in establishing de- 
grees of intelligence among humans. 
(Gratiolet, a royalist, was no egali- 
tarian. He merely sought other 
measures for the inferiority of blacks 
and women — earlier closing of the 
skull sutures, for example.) Broca 
and his disciples attacked and routed 
poor Gratiolet. Brain size had its 
limitations and exceptions, but it 
served as a good general index of 
intelligence. And guess who, in Bro- 
ca&apos;s words, won out? 

In general, the brain is larger in mature 
adults than in the elderly, in men than 
in women, in eminent men than in men 
of mediocre talent, in superior races 
than in inferior races. . . . Other things 
equal, there is a remarkable relation- 
ship between the development of intel- 
ligence and the volume of the brain. 

Broca&apos; s work seemed particu- 
larly invulnerable to refutation. 
Had he not measured with the most 
scrupulous care and accuracy? (In- 
deed, he had. I have the greatest 
respect for Broca&apos;s meticulous 
procedure. His numbers are sound. 
But science is an inferential exer- 
cise, not a catalog of facts. Num- 
bers, by themselves, specify noth- 
ing. All depends upon what you do 
with them.) Broca depicted himself 
as an apostle of objectivity, a man 
who bowed before facts and cast 
aside superstition and sentimental- 
ity. He declared that &quot;there is no 
faith, however respectable, no in- 
terest, however legitimate, which 
must not accommodate itself to the 
progress of human knowledge and 
bend before truth .&quot; &quot; Women , like it or 
not, had smaller brains than men 
and could not equal them in intelli-

gence. This may reinforce a com- 
mon prejudice in male society, but 
it is also a scientific truth. L. Man- 
ouvrier, the one member of Broca&apos;s 
school who rejected the inferiority 
of women, wrote with feeling about 
the burden imposed upon them by 
Broca&apos;s numbers: 

Women displayed their talents and their 
diplomas. They also invoked philo- 
sophical authorities. But they were op- 
posed by numbers unknown to Con- 
dorcet or to John Stuart Mill. These 
numbers fell upon poor women like a 
sledge hammer, and they were accom- 
panied by commentaries and sarcasms 
more ferocious than the most misog- 
ynist imprecations of certain church 
fathers. The theologians had asked if 
women had a soul. Several centuries 
later, some scientists were ready to 
refuse them a human intelligence. 

Broca&apos;s argument rested upon 
two sets of data: the larger brains of 
men in modem societies, and a 
supposed increase in male superior- 
ity through time. His most exten- 
sive data came from autopsies per- 
formed personally in four Parisian 
hospitals. For 292 male brains, he 
calculated an average weight of 
1,325 grams; 140 female brains av- 
eraged 1,144 grams for a difference 
of 181 grams, or 14 percent of the 
male weight. Broca understood, of 
course, that part of this difference 
could be attributed to the greater 
height of males. Yet he made no 
attempt to measure the effect of 
size alone and actually stated that it 
cannot account for the entire differ- 
ence because we know, a priori, 
that women are not as intelligent as 
men (a premise that the data were 
supposed to test, not rest upon): 

We might ask if the small size of the 
female brain depends exclusively upon 
the small size of her body. Tiedemann 
has proposed this explanation. But we 
must not forget that women are, on the 
average, a little less intelligent than 
men, a difference which we should not 
exaggerate but which is, nonetheless, 
real. We are therefore permitted to 
suppose that the relatively small size of 
the female brain depends in part upon 
her physical inferiority and in part upon 
her intellectual inferiority. 

In 1873, the year after Eliot pub- 
lished Middlemarch, Broca meas- 
ured the cranial capacities of pre- 
historic skulls from L&quot; Homme Mort 
cave. Here he found a difference of 
only 99.5 cc between males and 
females, while modern populations 
range from 129.5 to 220.7. To- 



pinard, Broca&apos;s chief disciple, ex- 
plained the increasing discrepancy 
through time as a result of differing 
evolutionary pressures upon domi- 
nant men and passive women: 

The man who fights for two or more in 
the struggle for existence, who has all 
the responsibility and the cares of to- 
morrow, who is constantly active in 
combating the environment and human 
rivals, needs more brain than the 
woman whom he must protect and 
nourish, the sedentary woman, lacking 
any interior occupations, whose role is 
to raise children, love, and be passive. 

In 1879, Gustave Le Bon, chief 
misogynist of Broca&apos;s school, used 
these data to publish what must be 
the most vicious attack upon 
women in modern scientific litera- 
ture (no one will ever beat Aris- 
totle). I do not claim his views were 
representative of Broca&apos;s school, 
but they were published in France&apos;s 
most respected anthropological 
journal. Le Bon concluded: 

In the most intelligent races, as among 
the Parisians, there are a large number 
of women whose brains are closer in 
size to those of gorillas than to the most 
developed male brains. This inferiority 
is so obvious that no one can contest it 
for a moment; only its degree is worth 
discussion. All psychologists who have 
studied the intelligence of women, as 
well as poets and novelists, recognize 
today that they represent the most in- 
ferior forms of human evolution and 
that they are closer to children and 
savages than to an adult, civilized man. 
They excel in fickleness, inconstancy, 
absence of thought and logic, and inca- 
pacity to reason. Without doubt there 
exist some distinguished women, very 
superior to the average man, but they 
are as exceptional as the birth of any 
monstrosity, as, for example, of a 
gorilla with two heads; consequently, 
we may neglect them entirely. 

Nor did Le Bon shrink from the 
social implications of his views. He 
was horrified by the proposal of 
some American reformers to grant 
women higher education on the 
same basis as men: 

A desire to give them the same educa- 
tion, and, as a consequence, to propose 
the same goals for them, is a dangerous 
chimera. . . . The day when, misun- 
derstanding the inferior occupations 
which nature has given her. women 
leave the home and take part in our 
battles; on this day a social revolution 
will begin, and everything that main- 
tains the sacred ties of the family will 
disappear. 

Sound familiar?

AUTOMATIC 
TELEPHONE 
DIALER 
F0R*99 

Rapidial&quot; works on any line with any phone. 
Automatically dials any of 20 numbers in 
its memory in one second. And you can use 
its super fast Touchtone® pad instead of the 
rotary dial on your phone. 




Here&apos;s the speed and convenience the industry 
said couldn&apos;t and wouldn&apos;t be available at this 
low price until sometime in the future. A highly 
sophisticated, full capacity, solid state mi- 
croprocessor made to the most exacting 
standards and warranteed for one full year 
against defects in quality and workmanship. 

Some Favorable Comparisons 

The closest you can come to the Rapidiaf&quot; is 
the Telephone Company&apos;s Touch-a-matic®, 
which handles 15 numbers compared with 
Rapidial&apos;s 20, and must be leased for $9.00 a 
month plus tax plus installation of $105.00. 
(The 32 memory unit is almost $20 a month 
plus $132.00 to install.) 

The next lowest price Is $130.00, for a 16 
number dialer with no keyboard, so it has to be 
programmed through the telephone. A cum- 
bersome technique that limits the use of the 
unit to numbers put In memory. 

You can go up the line, from $150 to $400, 
and you won&apos;t find an easier to use, more effi- 
cient or versatile unit. Rapidial, for example, 
has a built-in speaker to tell you if the line&apos;s 
busy, and when your party&apos;s on the line. So, 
with Rapidial you only pick up the receiver 
when someone answers.

Some Surprising Uses 

Frequently Called Numbers We always as- 
sumed you&apos;d put your 20 most frequently called 
numbers into memory — including, probably, 
your emergency numbers. And that&apos;s exactly 
the way many people use it. Delighted with the 
time and trouble they save with automation. 
Numbers You Always Look Up Others find 
using it in exactly the opposite way even more 
advantageous. They store important but less 
frequently used numbers. Numbers they al- 
most always had to look up before. 
Inter-Offlce For many, the greatest conven- 
ience is using Rapidial primarily for inter-office 
calls — so they don&apos;t have to stop to look up the 
extensions. 



Daily Schedule Caller Still others use Rapidial 
as a memo caller. Each morning they pencil in 
the names of the people they have to call that 
day, and enter their numbers into memory. 
When the call&apos;s completed, they just wipe off 
the naand his school, we must rec- 
ognize that his statements on the 
brains of women do not reflect an 
isolated prejudice toward a single 
disadvantaged group. They must be 
weighed in the context of a general 
theory that supported contempo- 
rary social distinctions as biologi- 
cally ordained. Women, blacks, 
and poor people (as well as children 
and criminals) were always men- 
tioned together, but women bore 
the brunt of Broca&apos;s argument be- 
cause data on women&apos;s brains were 
more readily available. Women 
were denigrated on their own 
accord, but they also stood as sur- 
rogates for other disenfranchised 
groups. We have seen the juxtaposi- 
tion in quoted statements of Broca 
and Le Bon. Consider another from 
one of Broca&apos;s disciples in 1881: 
&quot;Men of the black races have a 
brain scarcely heavier than that of 
white women.&quot; This juxtaposition 
extended into many other realms of 
anthropological argument, particu- 
larly to claims that, anatomically 
and emotionally, both women and 
blacks were like white children — 
and that white children, by the 
theory of recapitulation, repre- 
sented an ancestral (primitive) 
adult stage of human evolution. I

&quot;The Physicist&apos;s 
Fire&quot;^ 




Hot, even, slow-burning, easy to start, 

is how TIME described the simple, elegant 
fire designed by research physicist Lawrence 
Cranberg. (Science Section, Dec. 22, 1975). 

Place logs on the patented Texas Fire- 
frame® grate to form a slot-shaped cavity 
that faces you. Ignite paper in the cavity. 

Eureka! The fire takes hold quickly, bums 
evenly, steadily in the cavity. That means 
the cavity throws a beam of radiant energy at 
you, so the fire is hot but fuel-efficient. 

Texas Fireframe&apos;s height-adjustable arms 
give you easy set-up and a new option for 
control of the fire. The arms lock by friction. 

From Scientific American 

(August, 1978, pp. 142-146) 
&quot;Cranberg&apos;s conception of the radiation 
pattern from his. log holder is correct . . . 
little of the radiated heat was lost upward to 
the overhang or the chimney . . . nearly all 
of it must have been coming out into the 
room.&quot; 

&quot;The burning was slower with this ar- 
rangement, and flames . . . were uniform 
across the length of the slot (cavity) and 
required no rotation or stirring of the logs.&quot; 

From Texas Fireframe Mail 

&quot;Your Fireframe performs very well in- 
deed. It easily held the first floor of our house 
at 70°F — with 20° outside — with no help 
from the central heating system,&quot; Carl M.

fire is going.&quot; R. D. Keith. Olympia, Wa.

do not regard as empty rhetoric the 
claim that women&apos;s battles are for 
all of us. 

Maria Montessori did not confine 
her activities to educational reform 
for young children. For several 
years she lectured on anthropology 
at the University of Rome, and she 
wrote an influential book entitled 
Pedagogical Anthropology (Eng- 
lish edition, 1913). She was not an 
egalitarian. She supported most of 
Broca&apos;s work and the theory of 
innate criminality proposed by her 
compatriot Cesare Lombroso. She 
measured the circumference of 
children&apos;s heads in her schools and 
inferred that the best prospects had 
bigger brains. But she had no use 
for Broca&apos;s conclusions about 
women. She discussed Manouv- 
rier&apos;s work at length and made 
much of his tentative claim that 
women had slightly larger brains if 
proper corrections were made. 
Women, she concluded, were in- 
tellectually superior to men, but 
men had prevailed heretofore by 
dint of physical force. Since 
technology has abolished force as 
an instrument of power, the era of 
women may soon be upon us: &quot;In 
such an epoch there will really be 
superior human beings, there will 
really be men strong in morality 
and in sentiment. Perhaps in this 
way the reign of women is ap- 
proaching, when the enigma of her 
anthropological superiority will be 
deciphered. Woman was always the 
custodian of human sentiment, 
morality and honor.&quot; 

This represents one possible 
antidote to &quot;scientific&quot; claims for 
the constitutional inferiority of cer- 
tain groups. One may affirm the 
validity of biological distinctions 
but argue that the data have been 
misinterpreted by prejudiced men 
with a stake in the outcome, and 
that disadvantaged groups are truly 
superior. In recent years, Elaine 
Morgan followed this strategy in her 
Descent of Woman, a speculative 
reconstruction of human prehistory 
from the woman&apos;s point of view — 
and as farcical as more famous tall 
tales by and for men. 

I prefer another strategy. Mon- 
tessori and Morgan followed Bro- 
ca&apos;s philosophy to reach a more 
congenial conclusion. I would 
rather label the whole enterprise of 
setting a biological value upon 
groups for what it is: irrelevant and 
highly injurious. George Eliot well 



appreciated the special tragedy that 
biological labeling imposed upon 
members of disadvantaged groups. 
She expressed it for people like 
herself — women of extraordinary 
talent. I would apply it more widely 
— not only to those whose dreams 
are flouted but to those who never 
realize that they may dream — but I 
cannot match her prose. In conclu- 
sion, then, the rest of Eliot&apos;s prelude 
to Middlemarch: 

The limits of variation are really much 
wider than anyone would imagine from 
the sameness of women&apos;s coiffure and 
the favorite love stories in prose and 
verse. Here and there a cygnet is reared 
uneasily among the ducklings in the 
brown pond, and never finds the living 
stream in fellowship with its own oary- 
footed kind. Here and there is bom a 
Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, 
whose loving heartbeats and sobs after 
an unattained goodness tremble off and 
are dispersed among hindrances in- 
stead of centering in some long- 
recognizable deed. 

Stephen Jay Gould teaches biol- 
ogy, geology, and the history of 
science at Harvard University.

A Fluke of 
Nature 

I&apos;m a larmer. And the story I tell you Is 
the absolute truth, as Incredible as 
It may seem. 

It all started in a grove owned by Dr. 
Webb, our family doctor. One of tfie 
men who was picking fruit in the doc- 
tor&apos;s orchard came up to the Webb 
house holding six of the strangest 
grapefruit anyone had ever seen! A 
single branch of an ordinary grapefruit 
tree had produced these six unusual 
fruit. 

These were big grapefruit, unusually 
big. And they had a faint red blush on 
their sl&lt;in. When Dr. Webb sliced open 
the grapefruit, the fruit was a brilliant 
ruby red in color. 

Doctor Webb decided to taste this 
strange new grapefruit. The fruit was 
perfect, juicy and luscious. It wasn&apos;t 
sour like other grapefruit either — it 
was naturally sweet without sugar. 

For some reason, we&apos;ll never know why, 
nature had chosen to produce an 
entirely new kind of grapefruit here in 
our Magic Rio Grande Valley. It was 
incredible — men had labored for years 
to produce the ideal grapefruit, and 
had failed. But suddenly on a single 
branch of one tree in one grove. Mother 
Nature had done it all herself! 

YOU CAN IMAGINE THE EXCITEMENT 

From the fruit on that one branch, 
grove after grove now produces our 
own Texas Ruby Red Grapefruit. When 
I say, &quot;not one man in a thousand has 
ever tasted this grapefruit.&quot; — you 
can easily understand why. 

To begin with, Ruby Reds are rare, 
&quot;/ou can look for them in stores, but I 
doubt if you&apos;ll find one. &quot;Vou may find 
pink grapefruit, but seldom if ever do 
you see the genuine Ruby Reds. 

So you start with the rarity of Ruby 
Reds, and to get to ROYAL Ruby Reds 
you have to get rarer yet. Only 4 to 5 
percent of the entire crop will qualify 
as a &quot;Royal Ruby Red.&quot; 

Each Royal Ruby Red weighs a pound 
— or more! Each has a rich red color, 
flowing juices, luscious naturally sweet 
flavor, and the ability to stay this way 
for many weeks. 

Why, we won&apos;t even consider harvesting 
a grove until I&apos;ve checked out the 
fruit for tree-ripened maturity myself. 
I check for &quot;natural sugar, &quot; low acid 
balance and high juice content. I check 
to see that the fruit is plump and meaty, 
and I even check to see that the skin is 
thin. Not only does each factor have to 
check out, but all the factors have to 
be in a proper relationship to each 
other before I&apos;ll harvest a grove. 

And when we pick the fruit we&apos;re just 
as fussy. Every one of us takes a 
&quot;picking ring&quot; when we harvest. If the 



A new grapefruit discovery may 
change your concept of fruit 




This is a picture of the actual harvest of 
this season&apos;s first Ruby Reds. 

fruit is small enough to pass through 
this ring — we don&apos;t pick it! It simply 
isn&apos;t big enough to qualify as a Royal 
Ruby Red! 

Even after picking there are other care- 
ful inspections each fruit must pass 
before I&apos;ll accept it. I size the fruit. And 
I grade it for beauty. Sometimes the 
fruit will be wind scarred. I wont accept 
it. Or sometimes it will have a bulge 
on the stem end that we call &quot;sheep 
nose.&quot; I won&apos;t accept it. You can see I 
really mean it when I say I accept only 
perfect Royal Ruby Reds. 

When I realized that the Royal Ruby 
Reds were the ultimate fruit, I decided 
to form a club and sell only to my club 
members. In this manner I can control 
my production to insure that nobody 
will be disappointed 

But before I ask you to join my club, I 
want you to sample my Royal Ruby 
Reds for yourself, at no cost to you 
whatsoever. Let me send you a box 
prepaid of 16 to 20 Royal Ruby Reds. 
Place four of them in your refrigerator 
until they are thoroughly cool. Then cut 
them in half and have your family sample 
this unusual fruit. 



Here I am holding 
the four Royal 

Ruby Reds I want 
to send to you 

free for answering 

this advertisement. 




V / 



You decide whether or not Royal Ruby 
Reds are everything I say. You deter- 
mine whether or not eating a Royal 
Ruby Red is the fantastic taste experi- 
ence I promise. 

You decide. I&apos;m confident that you and 
your family will want more of this superb 
fruit-and on a regular basis, too. If the 



four Royal Ruby Reds make you say 
&quot;yes,&quot; then keep the remaining fruit. 
Otherwise return the unused fruit (at 
my expense) and you wont owe me a 
single penny. 

But you are never going to know just 
how wonderful genuine Royal Ruby 
Reds are unless you place your order 
right quick. 

This way you are sure to receive your 
package containing 16 or 20 Royal 
Ruby Reds for you and your family to 
sample a few days before Christmas. 
But since the supply is strictly limited 
it&apos;s important to place your order now. 

SEND NO MONEY NOW 

I&apos;ll put the bill for $10.95 for this first 
shipment on the top of the box. That&quot;s a 
saving of $5.00 off the regular price of 
$1 5.95. All delivery charges are prepaid 
by me. Remit only after my Ruby Reds 
have proved themselves, otherwise you 
don&quot;t owe a thing. 

Now suppose you do like Royal Ruby 
Reds — suppose you love them — can 
you be sure of getting more? 

You surely can. By saying &quot;&quot;yes&quot;&quot; to my 
first shipment you have the privilege of 
automatically joining my Winter Fruit 
Club Please be assured you pay noth- 
ing In advance. But each month during 
the winter l&quot;ll ship you a $15.95 pack 
of 16 to 20 orchard fresh, hand select- 
ed, hand picked Royal Ruby Reds. 

Every Royal Ruby Red you receive will 
pass my tough tests. Each will weigh a 
pound or more. Safe delivery is guar- 
anteed. This fruit is picked, packed and- 
shipped each month, December through 
April. 

You pay only after you have received 
each shipment. And you may skip or 
cancel any shipment, simply by telling 
me your wishes. 

HERE&apos;S HOW TO ORDER 

Call my toll-free number below, or send 
your name and address to me at the 
address below. 

Remember it obligates you to nothing, 
except making a taste test of the best 
grapefruit that has ever been grown. 
And this taste test is on me! 

Of course, as you can well imagine, 
when I say supplies are limited — Tm 
not kidding! There&quot;s just so many club 
members I can accept before I must 
close my membership this year. 

So to taste this &quot;miracle&quot; grapefruit, 
and have the opportunity to savor it 
each month during the growing season, 
be sure to place your order at no obli- 
gation today.

Emergence of the Green Darner 




Text and photographs by Jon Farrar 



Most of the world&apos;s 5,000 known 
species of dragonflies are tropical. 
Of the mere 400 found in North 
America, one of the most wide- 
spread is the green darner, Anax 
Junius. Its three-inch-long body, 
four-inch wingspan, emerald-col- 
ored thorax, bluish abdomen, and 
yellowish green face all make the 
adult green darner a conspicuous 
member of the continent&apos;s insect 
fauna. 

These large dragonflies mate and 
lay eggs primarily during the late 
spring and early summer. A female 
whose eggs have been fertilized will 
seek a body of still freshwater. 
Having found a suitable location, 
she will hover just above the sur- 
face. She then lands on a plant 
stem, backs down until her abdo- 
men is just beneath the surface, and 
using her raspy ovipositor, lays the 
eggs in the stem of an aquatic plant. 
The young hatch two weeks later, 
immediately wriggle free of their 
chitinous sheaths, and enter a lar- 
val stage that lasts up to a year. For 
a few days, the nymphs draw 
nourishment from a yolk sac re- 
tained in their abdomen. When this 
provision has been absorbed, they 
begin their lives of voracious pre- 
dation. 

All during the summer and early 
fall, camouflaged in greens, browns, 
and subtle stripes, the nymphs lie 
in wait among aquatic vegetation 
until some victim comes within 
range of their prehensile labium, a 
modified lower lip festooned with 
sharp teeth. The nymphs have 
catholic tastes and will attempt to 
seize almost anything that is smaller 
than themselves, but the larvae of 
mayflies and mosquitoes are their 
dietary staples. The nymphs are 
also cannibalistic and often prey on 
each other. In turn, fish and frogs 
make meals of the nymphs, and 
their mortality rate is high. 

Few nymphs are mature before 
the onset of winter. Most enter a 



period of dormancy between their 
ninth to thirteenth instar, remaining 
inactive in the soft bottom mud 
until the following spring, when the 
warming of the water and a re- 
newed abundance of food enable 
them to complete their maturation. 
The stage is now set for one of 
nature&apos;s most splendid spectacles 
— emergence. 

For a number of days before the 
nymph is ready to leave the water, 
gross morphological changes take 
place. The nymph gradually dark- 
ens in color, from a mossy green to 
an opaque brown; the wing sheaths 
swell until they stand above the 
abdomen, an outward sign of the 
massive growth of powerful flight 
muscles; the compound eyes pro- 
gressively enlarge until they meet 
in the center of the head; and as the 
tissues of the specialized labium 
degenerate, new mouthparts form 
to suit the adult&apos;s feeding habits. 

Behavioral changes also take 
place as the time of transformation 
approaches. The nymph becomes 
listless and does not feed for several 
days. It moves nearer the water 
surface, toward shore and the 
water plants suitable for its impend- 
ing climb into an aerial world. For a 
night or two before emergence, the 
nymph will perch on a rush or 
cattail, its head and thorax above 
the water because it must now take 
in oxygen directly. Finally the time 
for emergence arrives, usually an 
hour or two after dark, and the 
nymph leaves the water for the last 
time. 

Some dragonfly species crawl up 
only a few inches above the water 
on the plant they have selected, 
but the green darner often ascends 
much higher. The nymph climbs 
slowly, anchors its tarsal claws, 
and swings its abdomen violently 
from side to side, testing its grip 
and insuring sufficient room for 
wing expansion. For the next hour 
the nymph remains motionless, be- 



lying the great changes going on 
under the larval skin. The thorax 
swells, the skin splits, and the head 
follows quickly until the emerged 
adult hangs head down, supported 
only by the abdomen, which re- 
mains in the larval shell. For about 
thirty minutes the adult hangs, wait- 
ing for its extended legs to harden 
and dry before righting itself. In a 
spasmodic thrust the green darner 
pulls itself up, grasps the remaining 
anterior portion of larval skin, and 
extricates its abdomen. 

Blood surges through the body, 
and the crumpled wings begin to 
unfold; in less than half an hour they 
will expand and begin to dry. This 
is one of the most critical phases of 
emergence. Buffeting winds, a fall, 
or another nymph climbing the 
same plant can irreparably damage 
the expanding wings. Under ideal 
conditions the wings will harden 
and be ready for flight within three 
hours after the larval skin first rup- 
tured. 

Dragonflies are more susceptible 
to predation during emergence than 
at any other time in their life 
cycle, but for the green darner, 
nocturnal emergence offers some 
protection from predators. By dawn 
the newly adult green darner is 
ready for its maiden flight. The first 
one or two weeks of the adult green 
darner&apos;s life are spent away from 
water while the gonads and mature 
coloration develop. Males return 
to the water first and vigorously 
defend feeding and mating terri- 
tory. For several weeks the adults 
will feed and mate on the wing and 
the female will deposit her eggs, 
thus beginning a new cycle. 



Before emergence into adult form, 
the nymph seizes its underwater 
prey with a prehensile lower lip.

Having reached the top of a cattail, 

the nymph remains motionless for 

about an hour while many internal 

changes take place. The skin 

around the swelling thorax splits 

open (I) and the head and thorax 

pop out. For the next thirty minutes, 

the adult, supported by its 

abdomen, dangles from the plant 

(2) while its legs harden and dry. 

The adult then rights itself (3) and 

extracts its abdomen from the larval 

skin. As blood pumps through the 

body, the wings begin to unfold 

and expand (4). In less than half 

an hour, they start to dry and 

harden (5). Within three hours

Under and Around a Prairie 
Dog Town 



by Harvey L. Gunderson 



Gregarious and tenacious, 
these burrowing rodents have 
survived persecution by 
humans, predation, and 
a rigorous climate 

A magnificent grassland once 
spread over the major part of cen- 
tral North America. From the 
edges of the eastern deciduous 
forest to the foothills of the Rockies, 
from Texas to Saskatchewan, the 
flat terrain was covered with un- 
dulating grasses on whose supple 
surface cloud patterns raced ahead 
of the wind. On seeing the waving 
grass stalks, Willa Gather wrote that 
the whole country seemed to be 
running. 

The tallgrass that dominated 
the eastern portion of the grass- 
land was the first glimpse of the 
prairie for the nineteenth-century 
pioneers who pushed west in 
search of farmland. The tallgrass 
was plowed under and the Corn 
Belt was born. Farther west there 



Munching on a plant near its 
burrow, a black-tailed prairie dog.

which account for its pear shape, 
will carry the prairie dog through

foraging is impossible. Dotting the

were vast seas of midgrass and 
shortgrass, which became known 
as the Great Plains. Farmers turned 
ranchers, and the grasses nur- 
tured millions of cattle. 

The transformation of the 
grassland into farmland and range- 
land was not total, however. Al- 
though only small patches of the 
eastern prairie&apos;s tallgrass remain as 
relicts, and the Indian and buffalo 
have been pushed aside, much 
about the land has survived. It is 
still a place of extreme weather: 
searing winds in summer, blasts of 
frigid air in winter, and erratic pre- 
cipitation throughout much of the 
year. Large patches of grassland 
still dot the Great Plains, and 
many grassland animals, adapted to 
the rigorous conditions, still carry 



out the routines of their existence. 

A conspicuous survivor of the 
shortgrass faunal community char- 
acteristic of the Great Plains be- 
fore the arrival of the white 
settlers is the black-tailed prairie 
dog. Poisoned and shot by ranchers, 
farmers, and local, state, and federal 
pest-control agents as part of a mas- 
sive extermination effort that 
stretched over many decades, the 
nearly foot-long rodents have been 
greatly reduced from their former 
numbers, which ranged into the 
hundreds of millions. Nevertheless, 
the black-tailed prairie dog is still 
common in many parts of its primary 
range, from Texas north into 
Canada. 

This gregarious mammal lives in 
large-scale communities, com-

monly known as prairie dog towns. 
One series of such towns, reported 
by the biologist C. Hart Merriam 
in 1901, was a veritable mega- 
lopolis, covering an estimated 
25,000-square-mile area and con- 
taining a total (possibly exag- 
gerated) of 400 million animals. 
The prairie dog no longer occurs 
in such numbers, but persecution 
of the animal because of its grass- 
eating and hole-digging habits has 
eased, and a gradual appreciation 
of the species has developed in 
some quarters. In Lubbock, 
Texas, a city park contains part of 
an original prairie dog town. 

Members of the squirrel family, 
prairie dogs are consummate bur- 



rowers. Burrow systems range from 
about twelve to more than a 
hundred feet in length, and some 
reach down to a depth of fourteen 
feet. The burrows connect two, and 
rarely three, ground holes, which 
are surrounded by mounds. One 
mound is low and up to five feet in 
diameter; the other is narrow and up 
to three feet high. The low, wide 
mounds are dome shaped; the nar- 
row, high mounds are shaped like 
craters. 

The burrows are excavated from 
the low-mounded hole and com- 
pleted with the construction of the 
high mound around the second 
hole at the other end. The low 
mounds contain subsoil material, 
while the high mounds are con- 
structed of surface soil, grass, and 
burrow debris compacted into a 
hard surface by the prairie dogs. 
From the low-mounded hole the 
burrow angles downward, but 
from the crater-shaped mound the 
burrow plunges straight down, 
with an enlargement, or &quot;turn- 
around&quot; ledge, three to five feet 
below the surface. From there the 



prairie dog can &quot;scold&quot; terres- 
trial predators too large to enter 
the burrow and return quickly and 
easily to ground level after the 
danger has passed. 

Passageways are from four to 
ten inches in diameter. Off these 
passageways, the prairie dogs 
hollow out a number of chambers. 
Those used for nesting are about 
twelve inches high and eighteen 
inches long and are carpeted or 
filled with grass. Other chambers 
serve as food-storage sites. 
Earthen plugs abound in the tun- 
nels. They are a sanitary device, 
serving to seal off scats and dead 
prairie dogs. The arrangement of 
the plugs also results in a more 
complex burrow system, which 
may aid the prairie dog to escape 
some of the predators that do en- 
ter the burrows. 

The black-tailed prairie dog has 
a host of predators. One, the 
black-footed ferret, is no longer 
much of a threat because it is 
extremely rare. Now on the En- 
dangered Species List, this large 
ferret would enter prairie dog bur- 



58 



rows in search of its main prey. 
Avian predators include prairie fal- 
cons, which prey on the young; 
golden eagles; and red-tailed 
hawks. Bobcats, badgers, and 
coyotes hunt prairie dogs on the 
ground; bull snakes and rattle- 
snakes prey on them on the ground 
and in the burrows. Rattlesnakes 
feed mainly on the young and prob- 
ably take an occasional adult. 

Prairie dogs do most of their 
repair work on the mounds follow- 
ing a rain, when the soil surround- 
ing a burrow entrance can be 
packed. First, the prairie dog 
cleans the passageways by push- 
ing debris ahead of itself to the 
mouth of the burrow, then kicking

kicking away soil with its hind

Lubbock, Texas. 



it away from the hole with its hind 
feet. Then the animal hunches up 
on all fours and uses its nose as a 
triphammer to pack the moist 
material. Soil is added, and the 
sun bakes the mixture into a hard 
structure. 

The mounds are attractive to 
other prairie inhabitants. In the 
past, bison used them for wallow- 
ing; they would paw and horn the 
mound into fragments, then wal- 
low in the dust. Burrowing owls 
are closely associated with prairie 
dog towns and nest in passage- 
ways in unoccupied parts of the 
town. Rattlesnakes hibernate in 
the burrows during the winter. A 
variety of insects frequent the 
mounds, particularly on spring and 
summer mornings, and in turn, at- 
tract horned larks, lark buntings, 
and meadowlarks, which feed on 
the insects and use the mounds as 
watch and song posts. 

The burrows and mounds are 
engineering feats that make possible 
the prairie dog&apos;s survival on the 
plains. The mounds minimize the 
inundation of burrows during the 



flash floods that occur on the 
hardpan plains and serve as ob- 
servation posts from which the 
prairie dogs can see approaching 
predators. 

The burrow system also helps 
the prairie dog cope with the en- 
vironmental stress produced by 
the climatic extremes of the mid- 
continental plains. Maxwell Wil- 
comb, an entomologist working on 
prairie dog burrows and their in- 
sect inhabitants, has emphasized 
the stability of both temperature 
levels and relative humidity in the 
burrows as compared with those 
at ground level. Taking measure- 
ments during both the summer 
and winter, he also found con- 
siderably higher relative humidity 
in the burrows. 

In late June, temperatures one 
inch above the ground surface 
varied from 77° to 99°F; three feet 
within a prairie dog burrow the 
variation was from 80° to 89°F. 
The temperature range was not 
only narrower but also cooler.

ranged from 39 to 85 percent one 
inch above the ground surface; 
three feet inside the burrow the 
range was from 80 to 95 percent. 
Thus the range of relative humidity 
was narrower and higher inside 
the burrow. 

In late December, again over a 
two-day period, Wilcomb repeated 
his measurements. The tempera- 
ture one inch above the ground 
varied from 25° to 44°; three feet 
inside the burrow the variation 
was only from 42° to 48°. The 
temperature range was not only 
much narrower within the burrow, 
but also much warmer than the 
outside air. The relative humidity 
of the outside air over the same 
period varied from 52 to 89 per- 
cent; inside the burrow the varia- 
tion was only 89 to 95 percent. 
Again, the range was narrower in 
the burrow, and significantly, the 
humidity was much higher than 
that of the outside air. The bur- 
rows not only moderate the harsh 
temperatures of the plains but. 



more important, help the prairie 
dog conserve some of the body 
water normally lost through res- 
piration. This increases the ani- 
mal&apos;s ability to survive with a 
minimum of drinking water, a 
scarce item in its environment. 

Underground storage of food also 
helps the prairie dog to be indepen- 
dent of free-standing water. Plant 
material is hygroscopic and the air 
pressure in the burrows is subat- 
mospheric. As the humid interstitial 
air in the soil is drawn into the side 
chambers, the stored food plants 
soak up a great amount of moisture. 
When a prairie dog eats in its bur- 
row, it also consumes water. 

Although prairie dogs are active 
in winter, the shortened daylight 
hours and periods of extreme 
weather reduce the time available 
for feeding. The fat reserves ac- 
cumulated during the summer and 
fall and the plant material stored 
underground are important factors 
in enabling the prairie dog to sur- 
vive this period. The animals 
spend much of their time under- 
ground in the deepest nest cham- 
bers, which have been well in- 
sulated with plant material. 

For a mammal living in a con- 
fined space such as a burrow, the 
supply of oxygen is limited and 
the amount of carbon dioxide ex- 
cessive. In some species, such as 
the pocket gopher, whose burrow 
openings are plugged (a closed 



system), physiological changes 
probably occur, enabling the ani- 
mal to cope with carbon dioxide 
concentrations ten to sixty times 
higher than that of the outside 
atmosphere. Although elevated 
carbon dioxide levels and de- 
pressed oxygen levels lower 
metabolic activities, not much is 
known of their efiPects on pocket 
gophers. In a prairie dog burrow, 
the ventilation system produced 
by dissimilar burrow entrances at 
opposite ends of the passageways 
provides a sufficient supply of 
oxygen and prevents the concen- 
tration of carbon dioxide. When 
lighted candles are dropped into 
prairie dog burrows, the smoke is 
discharged exclusively from the 
opening with the high, crater- 
shaped, chimneylike mound. The 
convection current induced by 
the shape of the mounds permits 
exchange rates of oxygen and 
carbon dioxide that are adequate 
for the respiratory needs of the 
animals. 



Rising on its hind legs to its full 

length, an adult prairie dog gives 

vent to a territorial call. The 

upward stretch is fast and strong, 

and Juveniles often fall on their 

backs when they first try it.

A black-tailed prairie dog town 
is a iiighly organized entity. Each 
town is a discrete unit, separated 
by unoccupied areas, rocky ter- 
rain, or a vegetationai barrier. 
Nevertheless, the inhabitants of 
several nearby towns are often 
within sight of each other and 
have frequent contacts. 

Towns are divided into two or 
more adjacent units called wards, 
separated from each other by 
topographical or vegetationai fea- 
tures, such as a hill, stream bed, 
or trees. Social exchange between 
the animals in adjoining wards is 
frequent. Wards, in turn, are made 
up of coteries, the smallest closed 
social units of prairie dog society. 



A coterie consists of a cohesive 
group of individuals that defend a 
territory of about 0.6 of an acre. 
(For prairie dogs, the territory and 
the home range — the area used for 
feeding and reproductive behavior 
— are the same.) The coterie is 
based on the communal use by all 
its members of the burrow systems 
within the territory. Bonds be- 
tween individual prairie dogs are 
reinforced by behavioral responses 
that serve to mold them into an 
organized social unit. 

The composition of a coterie 
varies widely, but the average is 
one male, several females, and a 
half dozen young, not necessarily 
all related. One male dominates 



the coterie, even though other 
males may be members. The so- 
ciety is patriarchal, and the mating 
system is polygynous, that is, one 
male mates with several females. 
There is one breeding season a 
year, February and March. The 
young, usually about four, are 
born after a gestation period of 
from twenty-eight to thirty-five 
days. Young prairie dogs remain 
in the coterie until their second 
year, at which time they begin 
wandering. New colonies and 
range extensions are created by 
those young that survive this period 
of greatest mortality and by explor- 
ing adults that may be trying to 
evade the constant pestering by the 




r 



young in the established coterie. 

To maintain this highly inte- 
grated social system, especially 
within the coterie but extending 
to other coteries, and even wards, 
in the case of approaching preda- 
tors, an effective system of com- 
munication has developed. The 
system is based on tactile, olfac- 
tory, visual, and vocal cues: the 
first three function primarily within 
the coterie; vocal communication 
extends beyond the coterie. 

The most frequent method of 
identifying members of the coterie 
is the &quot;kiss.&quot; Whenever two indi- 
viduals meet, they approach each 
other with mouths open and teeth 
bared; they then touch mouths. 



If the individuals recognize each 
other, the encounter is peaceful. 
If they don&apos;t, they lie down on 
their bellies, wag their tails, and 
slowly creep toward each other. 
The resident prairie dog then usu- 
ally routs the interloper. In this 
manner, the integrity of the coterie 
is maintained. 

Grooming is another form of 
communication that enhances 
group cohesion. The young are 
particularly responsive to groom- 
ing and continually pester other 
individuals for attention. They are 
usually not denied and are among 
the most pampered juveniles in 
the animal world. 

Vocalization is one of the strik- 



Hunting prairie dugs during the

National Park, South Dakota, a

characteristic of prairie dog towns 
and the animals&apos; vocal alert system 
mean that the coyote is usually 
unsuccessful. The more successful 
terrestrial predators are those that 
can enter the burrows. Bison 
(bottom left) are fond of breaking 
up prairie dug nu)unds with 
their hums and hoofs and then 
wallowing in the rubble. Often, 
burrowing owls (below) can be 
found nesting in abandoned 
burrows in the deserted sections 
of prairie dog towns.

ing features of a prairie dog town. 
The most common is the nasal 
warning bark, which is accom- 
panied by a flick of the tail . The bark 
varies in frequency and intensity 
depending on the degree of the 
danger. The territorial call is 
another distinctive vocalization. 
When giving this call the prairie dog 
thrusts its body upward to the 
length of its hind legs, points its 
nose in the air, and stretches its 
forelegs out. The upward stretch is 
quick and powerful, and youngsters 
flip over backward the first few 
times they try it. 

Visual and vocal communication 
are made more effective by the 
manipulation of vegetation. Short 
grasses and forbs predominate in 
established prairie dog towns be- 
cause the animals remove tall 
vegetation. This clears the view, 
particularly for a prairie dog 
perched on a mound, and an ap- 
proaching coyote, for example, can 
be quickly spotted. The nearest 
prairie dog immediately begins vo- 
calizing, and the warning signals 
spread throughout the town. The 
vocal alerts minimize the danger 



and reinforce the social cohesion of 
the town. 

Prairie dogs feed primarily on 
plants but are opportunistic 
enough to take many insects dur- 
ing spring and summer. During 
late spring, summer, and fall, they 
eat mostly foxtail barley, grama 
grass, bufifalo grass, white pig- 
weed, yellow wood sorrel, and 
other plains grasses. Stems, 
leaves, seeds, and seed heads are 
consumed. In the late fall they 
will eat clumps of prickly pear. 
Their habit of trimming the taller 
grasses around their burrows en- 
courages the growth of forbs, 
which they also consume. The 
forbs, which often have a more 
luxuriant growth than grasses, ac- 
tually increase the vegetative mass 
per given unit area, thereby in- 
creasing the prairie dog&apos;s food 
supply. This diet turns the slender 
prairie dogs of summer into pear- 
shaped sacs of fat during the fall. 
The stores of fat enable them to 
survive the hazards of winter, 
when at times of severe weather 
they cannot emerge from their 
burrows for several days. 



Despite great persecution by 
humans, the prairie dog. believed 
to have been more numerous at 
one time than the now extinct 
passenger pigeon, did not suffer 
the same fate. The prairie dog&apos;s 
adaptations have been finely 
honed and tempered to mesh with 
a demanding environment. This 
medium-sized rodent, with its 
towns and social organization, 
should remain a feature of the 
central North American plains for 
generations to come. D 



Mutual grooming (right) is an 

important type of tactile 

communication among prairie 

dogs. This behavior functions 

primarily within the coterie and 

serves to reinforce social 

bonds. Juveniles are particularly 

responsive to grooming and 

pester adults for attention. Their 

constant demands can so irritate 

an adult that, at times, a youngster 

is roughly shoved away {below}.

There are some new exhibit ideas in our 
sparliling Hall of Minerals, Gems and 
Meteorites. Visitors are actually encouraged 
to touch many openly displayed specimens. 
One unusual exhibit makes you feel that 
you&apos;ve happened on a fantastic gem deposit. 
A multi-screen presentation tells the story of 
copper and its many uses, clearly and con- 
cisely. And, the lighting throughout is ingeni- 
ously hidden to dramatize the colors of the 
assembled 6,000 natural beauties. 

Yet our visitors themselves remain among the 
most impressive exhibits seen in the Mu- 
seum. We attract more than two million a 
year. People of all ages, who come here to 
learn and enjoy the renewing experience of 
discovery. We&apos;re proud to provide this oppor- 
tunity for so many. 

Wis&apos;re also proud of our other, less visible, ac- 
tivities. We house laboratories for over 200 
wJentists and assistants whose basic research 



has often had profound influence in en- 
vironmental control, medicine and oil explo- 
ration. Our library of 300,000 volumes is 
readily available to students, scholars and in- 
stitutions. Our educational programs for the 
public, such as the African-American and 
Caribbean studies, reach out to thousands in 
the metropolitan area. Our tremendous store 
of rare artifacts and specimens is circulated 
to scientists, schools and other museums. 

Like many cultural institutions, the Mu- 
seum&apos;s funds from government have been cut 
back drastically. To keep our programs 
viable and our doors open to eager minds, we 
urgently need the support of businesses and 
individuals in New York and elsewhere. Your

It&apos;s not unusual for visitors to see Margaret 
Mead here and there in The American 
Museum of Natural History. It has been 
home base for the famous anthropologist 
for most of her distinguished career. Here 
we see her in the Discovery Room, a new 
area in the Museum where children are en- 
couraged to learn by the feel and shape of 
different objects. 

These children are among the more than 
two million visitors we attract every year 
— school groups, families, couples, individ- 
uals. In themselves, they are one of our 
most impressive exhibits. They&apos;re drawn 
here by the desire to learn, and they leave 
having enjoyed themselves in the process. 

Overall, our business could be described as 
collecting and disseminating information 



about the condition of life on earth. We 
share this information not only with the 
public in our exhibit halls, but with college 
students who come here to work with the 
scientists in our laboratories, and with 
other museums and scientists all over the 
world who borrow from our collections of 
rare artifacts and specimens. 

Our funds, like those of many other cul- 
tural institutions, have been cut back con- 
siderably. To keep our doors open to eager 
minds and our collections in circulation, 
we need the support of businesses and indi-

Ceramics of the Canelos Quichua 

by Dorothea S. Whitten and Norman E. Whitten, Jr. 



In a changing environment, 
these people use ecological 
knowledge, dreams, spirits, 
and hallucinogens to guide 
their pottery-making 
tradition 

Before sunrise, Laica sat down 
on a split bamboo mat and readied 
for the cool, damp clay at her side. 
During the night she had dreamed 
of water and of her husband, 
Taruga, trekking north to hunt 
game for the coming annual cere- 
mony. Pungent smoke from the 
glowing wood fire penetrated the 
swirling, chilly mists that rose from 
the surrounding jungle hills. 

She concentrated on her dream 
visions, seeking to integrate them 
with her knowledge of the environ- 
ment. Segments of mythic episodes 
came to mind, and from them she 
selected images to guide her pot- 
tery making: Quilla, the roguish 
moon; Jilucu, the moon&apos;s sister- 
lover; and the Palu, the poisonous 
snake whose bite spells shamanistic 
death. The images became more 
vivid as she recalled songs about 
them and softly repeated these to 
her children while thinking of what 
she would create: a half-moon in the 
form of a cornet, a pregnant potoo 
bird, drinking bowls with her spe- 
cial designs, and a joined pair of 
deadly bushmasters. 

This contemporary scenario re- 
flects an ancient Upper Amazonian 
tradition that has been maintained

by the Canelos Quichua of east- 
central Ecuador. It is a tradition 
that acts as a buffer against the 
cataclysmic changes brought by 
foreign influences. The Canelos 
Quichua inhabit tropical rain for- 
ests from the foothills of the Andes, 
east to the hills and swamps near 
the present border of Peru. Annual 
rainfall here averages between 150 
and 200 inches. 

The indigenous people of this re- 
gion have experienced numerous 
disruptions for well over a century. 
In the late nineteenth century the 
Amazonian rubber boom reached 
this area, bringing a rush of Euro- 
peans. In the 1930s, oil exploration 
teams from Royal Dutch Shell pene- 
trated the jungles, and colonists 
cleared land near Puyo and planted 
sugar cane. In 1941, during the 
Peru-Ecuador war, Peruvian sol- 
diers invaded southeastern Ec- 
uador. Since the 1950s a widening 
web of roads — its progress always 
followed by colonists — has be- 
gun to snake through the jungles. 
And then in the 1960s and 1970s, the 
oil exploration teams returned. 

In this changing environment, 
the Canelos Quichua, like other 
indigenous societies of the Ecua- 
dorian tropics, strive to maintain 
their ancient traditions while seek- 
ing a firm position for their ex- 
panding population. The 10,000 
Canelos Quichua, many of whom 
have intermarried with Achuara 
Jivaroans, a neighboring people, 
practice swidden agriculture on 
three- or four-acre plots. Their basic 
crops — manioc, plantain, taro. 
palm, maize, peanut, and sweet 
potato — grow to vertical layers of 
vegetation, replicating the natural 
forest ecosystem, which forms a 
canopy that breaks and diffuses 
rainfall, filters sunlight, and pro- 
vides a root lattice to retard leaching 
of vital nutrients. Before the soil 
becomes exhausted, men fell trees. 



creating another plot and allowing 
the first to return to forest. The 
people complement their carbohy- 
drate resources with animal protein 
acquired through hunting, fishing, 
and the collecting of insects, larvae, 
land snails, tortoises, turtles, eggs, 
and river crustaceans. 

The dietary staple, however, is 
chicha, a yeasty, gruellike drink 
made from cooked, masticated 
manioc. This food drink, rich in 
carbohydrates, also contains vege- 
table proteins that are increased 
through fermentation. 

The Canelos Quichua have inte- 
grated their subsistence base with 
their social organization. The rais- 
ing of manioc, for example, is rep- 
resentative of the fundamental

male-female division of labor: men 
clear land; women plant manioc. 
Women are also responsible for 
harvesting the crop, but may re- 
ceive help from men. Making 
chicha, however, is strictly wom- 
en&apos;s work. 

Women also maintain the Upper 
Amazonian tradition of making both 
decorated pottery, which they use 
for storing and serving chicha , and 
blackened pottery, which is used for 
a variety of cooking and serving 
uses. The pottery-making tradition

Manioc (cassava) supplies 
carbohydrates for the Canelos 
Qiiichiia and other peoples of 
the tropical forest. Women,

roots from the ground, skin

is strongly tied to personal experi- 
ence, familial integrity, ideology, 
and knowledge of the environment. 
Basic to the ideology of the 
Canelos Quichua is a learning 
process through which knowledge 
and vision are integrated. They 
think of knowledge as specific in- 
formation acquired from any 
source. That manioc yield de- 
creases after two plantings, that 
caterpillars pupate into moths, and 
that government officials seldom 



listen to Indians when discussing 
the Upper Amazonian ecosystem 
are all considered retrievable 
pieces of useful information. 

To the Canelos Quichua. vision 
comes primarily from dreams. 
They believe it is important to 
awaken after dreaming, so as to 
sift the jumble of images into an 
analyzable symbol system that re- 
lates past knowledge to present, 
observed behavior. A flash of in- 
sight in which one realizes the rela- 
tion of dream content to previous 
knowledge also provides vision. 

The Canelos believe in a bio- 
sphere of spirits: the master ones 
are Amasanga, the forest spirit; 
Nunghui, the pottery clay-garden 
soil spirit; and Sungui, a water 
spirit. Visions and the spirit world 
are closely tied. The Canelos Qui- 
chua use the powerful hallucinogen 
datura to enter this spirit world. The 
drug propels the taker into a six- 
to twelve-hour-long series of 
heightened visual and sensory 
episodes. Hallucinations continue 
sporadically for one to three days, 
as the taker resumes interactions 



with other humans in his usual sur- 
roundings. 

The ceramic-making tradition, 
carried on only by women, reflects 
the synthesis of knowledge and 
vision. Girls and young married 
women learn techniques of hand 
building, painting, and firing from 
their own or their husbands&apos; 
mothers. The decorative style, 
however, develops with a woman&apos;s 
growing knowledge and vision of 
her world. Once or twice during 
her lifetime, she may seek a deeper 
vision of the spirit universe by 
taking datura. 

Husbands play an important but 
secondary role in the pottery-mak- 
ing tradition by helping to mine 
clay and by acquiring special 
stones used for making dyes and for 
burnishing. Mining itself is exciting, 
challenging, and grueling. Once or 
twice a year a small group of related 
women, together with their hus- 
bands and children, walk for a day 
or more through the rugged, hilly 
terrain to a clay pit or riverbank site 
ostensibly known only to them. 
There they dig with hands,

machetes, and sticks for a supply of 
nearly pebble-free clay, which they 
carry home on their backs — 100 
pounds for a woman, 150 for a 
man — with the aid of tumplines. 

During mining, the women and 
men talk animatedly, their stories 
and jokes punctuated by ringing 
laughter. An undercurrent of ex- 
citement buoys them as they watch 
for special stones. Particularly 
prized are water-polished stones, 
certain textured rocks, and min- 
eral-ore fragments that yield black 
and red dyes used to decorate pot- 
tery. Small, smooth stones are 
highly valued by both men and 
women, who use them to burnish 
drumheads and pottery respec- 
tively. The Canelos believe that a 
spirit that facilitates the merger of 
earth and water lives in such stones. 

After the trek home, the women 
dry out lumps of clay by plastering 



them to the split palm or bamboo 
walls of their houses until they are 
of a workable consistency. The rest 
of the clay is stored in damp leaves. 
The potter then kneads the partially 
dried clay until it is of uniform 
plasticity and free of all tiny peb- 
bles. After separating the prepared 
clay into small chunks, the potter, 
usually helped by a daughter, uses 
a turtle-shaped wooden board to roll 
out coils eight to twelve inches 
long and one to two inches in diam- 
eter. They build up a supply of coils 
so that they can work on several 
initial pieces. 

To begin a mucahua, the tradi- 
tional drinking bowl, the potter 
rolls the end of a coil into a small 
circle and presses it flat against the 
board to form the base. Walls are 
built up by pinching the coil against 
the base, and then continuing the 
pinching process of coil against 



coil. When the walls are several 
inches high, the woman smooths 
the coils with swift upward strokes 
of her fingers. After she evens the 
walls, she thins, widens, and shapes 
them with a calabash scraper, then 
puts the vessel aside on a split 
bamboo mat or rack to dry, and 
repeats the process on her next 
mucahua. 

A daughter or daughter-in-law 
normally assists in producing the 
modest assortment of bowls needed 
for household use. Such help indi- 
cates serious apprentice status. If 
the intent is to produce a large vol- 
ume of pottery for use in an up- 
coming ceremony, the potter&apos;s sis- 
ters may work alongside her daugh- 
ters and daughters-in-law. Initially, 
the mood is quiet as they think of 
songs about the spirit inspirations 
of their creations. As work pro- 
ceeds, they become more conver-

sational, sharing news of recent 
events, discussing prospective mar- 
riage alliances for their children, 
and joking about clandestine love 
affairs. Younger children gather 
around to watch, sometimes mak- 
ing small animal figures out of a 
ball of clay. Occasionally, the 
women take a chicha break to re- 
lieve the fatigue that comes from 
sitting for hours on cold earthen 
floors with scant bamboo covering. 
When the first miicahua is dry 
enough to hold new coils, the pot- 
ter levels its top by biting it, spit- 
ting out small pieces of clay as she 
goes. Biting produces a remark- 
ably even wall top and serves to 
score and moisten it for joining the 
next coil. After finishing the coil- 
ing, scraping, and paddling, the 
potter again evens off the top by 
biting and then smooths the tooth 
marks with a scraper, her fingers. 




or sometimes a moistened maize 
leaf. 

The women potters also use the 
coiling method to make vessels for 
storing chicha. These are much 
larger than mucahuas — sometimes 
two feet or more in diameter — and 
strong enough to hold the ten to 
twenty gallons of chicha mash 
placed in them weekly for five to ten 
years. Potters also create figurines 
from which to serve chicha during 
special ceremonies. These may take 
the form of fish, animals, or birds. 
Representations of humans or 
spirits are rare, but do occur. 
Examples include the form of a 
&quot;cougar man,&quot; who dances and 
drums at ceremonies; the forest 
spirit; the garden soil-pottery clay 
spirit; an oil company worker; or a 
masked wrestler seen on a cinema 
poster. Rarer still is a replication of 
an ancient human burial urn 
adorned with four versions of a 
human head, each decorated as an 
Achuara Jivaroan&apos;s painted face. 

Each ceramic is left to air-dry for 



A ceramic fer-de -lance, left,

a day or so, before being covered 
with slip — a clay thinned to a 
creamy consistency — usually white 
but sometimes pink or red. It is 
again air-dried until leather hard, 
then burnished with a smooth 
stone. 

As pieces are drying, a woman 
will assemble her decorating equip- 
ment, sorting through the precious 
rock dyes she has attained from 
many sources and kept hidden 
since her last pottery manufacture. 
She chooses rocks that will yield 
various shades of red, black, and 
white when powder scraped from 
them is mixed with water. To the 
Canelos Quichua, a multicolored 
but predominantly red spectrum 
represents the domain of Sungui, 
master spirit of water life. Black 
and red are manifestations of 
Nunghui, spirit of garden soil and 
pottery clay. 

A potter uses several delicate 
brushes with different-size tips, 
which she makes by fastening small 
locks of her own and her daugh- 
ters&apos; hair to little sticks. She names 
each brush according to its size and 
the color it will hold. She prepares 
the rock dyes in a stone vessel 
hollowed by years of grinding, then 
settles down on the floor to paint 
her special designs on the first 
mucahua, thinking of songs that 
relate mythic episodes to her day- 
to-day life. 

First, she follows the tradition 
of adorning the bowl with a heavy

red line representing a female 
motif. She may know of several 
hundred base designs for the line, 
but she will choose from about 
thirty of her favorites, any one of 
which may be used to symbolize 
different aspects of the spiritual 
world. One zigzag motif, for exam- 
ple, may represent a winding river, 
which is Sungui&apos;s domain, or the 
spirit Nunghui manifested as a 
harmless brown snake. 

Next, and again traditionally, 
she emphasizes the red-line design 
with fine black lines that stand for a 
male motif. These lines — painted 
either parallel to, surrounding, or 
radiating from the base design — 
signal a complex set of associations 
of husband-wife and brother-sister 
relationships. Fundamental to these 
relationships are combined con- 
cepts of warmth, togetherness, and 
ultimate continuity of male and 
female clan essence through 
women. 

The decorations a woman paints 
on her ceramics are traditional in 
color and base design, but the 
choice and presentation of certain 



motifs expresses her individual in- 
tegration of knowledge with vision. 
During the burnishing and decorat- 
ing processes, a woman imparts 
three souls to each ceramic piece. 
The first is that of Nunghui. The 
burnishing stone, a representation 
of Nunghui&apos;s domain, symbolizes 
toads and frogs, basic to acquisi- 
tion of male shaman power. This 
process is also symbolic of the 
power of Sungui. The second soul, 
that of the woman herself, repre- 
sents the synthesis of knowledge, 
vision, and technique acquired 
through the process of learning. 
The third soul derives from the 
woman&apos;s household, a microcosm 
of the enduring biosphere. 

Immediately after decorating the 
last of her miicalutas. the potter 
stokes a fire and makes a simple 
firing frame by chipping out the 
bottom of an old pot to form an 
opening slightly smaller than that 
of the rim of the mucohiia to be 
fired. She then sets this frame up- 
right over the logs and places the 
newly painted nuicahua inside it. 
inverted over the hole. The inii-

Right, women are responsible for

and sometimes make their own 

small clay objects. Older girls 

become apprentices to their 

mothers or mothers-in-law. 



cahtta is first covered with warm 
ashes and then heated gradually 
with hot ashes and glowing sticks. 
After twenty-five to thirty min- 
utes, the fire reaches a temperature 
of more than 1500° F. Within thirty- 
five minutes the frame is 
removed — with a pair of machetes 
held tonglike — and placed on the 
floor. The glowing pot is removed in 
the same manner and gently low- 
ered to a log stool. When the bowl is 
cool enough, the potter rubs a wad 
of shinc/iiillu. a tree resin, quickly 
over the entire bowl. The resin

deepens the colors, some trans- 
formed by firing, to their permanent 
intensity. 

Canelos Quichua ceramics are 
used continually in daily life. Upon 
waking, a woman stokes the smol- 
dering fire, procures water from a 
nearby stream, and boils it. She 
then mixes a handful of freshly 
fermented manioc mash into a 
mucahua of hot water and serves 
the tangy, yeasty drink to her hus- 
band. As men and women drink 
chicha in these predawn hours, 
they engage in animated discus- 
sion, relating the dreams they had 
just before awakening. They attempt 
to separate and integrate observa- 
tions drawn from their encounters 
of the day before with the night&apos;s 
dreams. The mythic images of for- 



est, soil, and water spirits are 
evoked by the designs on the bowls 
from which they drink. By refer- 
ence to these images, they reaffirm 
their own strength and purpose, 
resolving yesterday&apos;s problems and 
reaching today&apos;s decisions. 

As the day wears on, the Cane- 
los Quichua continue to serve and 
drink chicha — in their houses, on 
their jungle plots, or in the forest. 
Although calabashes and aluminum 
bowls are readily available, the 
Canelos still prefer to use their 
handmade ceramics to serve and 
store chicha. 

Men making long jungle treks or 
canoe trips carry one or two deli- 
cate miicahiias with them. Women 
choose particular mucahuas for 
serving chicha to guests. The more 




ViclorEnglebert 



important the guest, the finer the 
piece. Today, near Puyo, where in- 
trusion by outsiders is frequent, a 
woman may deny that she uses 
ceramic serving ware if she regards 
a visitor as a threat to her house- 
hold or clan integrity. 

Once or twice each year, the 
Canelos Quichua hold ceremonies 
that symbolize the relationship of 
their enduring culture to a changing 
world. Prior to such ceremonies 
women make an impressive array 
of ceramics, often taking over the 
entire household for their produc- 
tion. During this period, men con- 
duct a special hunt for tapir, pec- 
cary, deer, and monkey, which 
they smoke in the forest and then 
bring home. 

Preparations complete, a three- 
day ceremony begins with the men 
beating drums to signal the thun- 
der of forest spirit Amasanga. 
Women dance in imitation of Nung- 
hui and pour chicha into the 
mouths of participants, intention- 
ally spilling much of it on the 
drinkers. Continuous drumming, 
plus a deluge of chicha, calls forth 
imagery of the encompassing power 
of the water spirit Sungui, whose 
presence is evoked to express re- 
sistance to further destruction of the 
Upper Amazonian ecology. 

As the ceremony moves toward 
a crescendo, women serve more 
and more chicha from ceramic fig- 
urines representing fish, symbolic 
of Sungui&apos;s domain, and from rep- 
tile figurines, symbolic of Ama- 
sanga, Nunghui, and Sungui. 

Ceramic images of recent en- 
vironmental intrusions are also 
brought forth, such as a hard hat, 
shaped like those worn by petro- 
leum company workers but 
adorned with an ancient reptilian 
design, and a jukebox complete 
with the name of the colonists&apos; 
weekend saloon. As men and 
women drink chicha from these 
ceramic representations of a chang- 
ing world , they think of the predawn 
song of the paspanchii bird, which, 
to them, means &quot;evil is coming but I 
am ready to meet it.&quot; By simulta- 
neously confronting the new with 
the ancient, the Canelos Quichua 
seek to maintain their sense of ordfer 
in a radically changing environ- 
ment. D

An Owl Hunt 



by Jean K. Lauber 



The roots of modern science 
can be detected in the work 
of medieval artists 



The decline of science in western 
Europe after the classical period, 
and the relative vacuum that re- 
mained in its wake, have been doc- 
umented by historians of science. 
After genuflection to Aristotle, 



Two owls, left, one clutching 
a mouse in its talons, 
illustrate a twelfth-century 
bestiary. Below, an owl mobbed 
by smaller birds appears 
in an early Psalter. 



biological scientists have custom- 
arily dismissed the Middle Ages 
as a 1,000- to 1,500-year period 
that contributed virtually nothing 
to biology. The record is slightly 
better in botany because of the 
interest in plants as medicinals. 
Zoology, however, is usually not 
thought to have even begun as a 
distinct field of study until well 
after the Renaissance. 

Some would place the beginning 
of true zoological study with Leo- 
nardo da Vinci&apos;s boundless curiosity 
and well-tuned sensitivity to the 
natural world; some with the scien- 
tific method of Descartes and 
Francis Bacon or with the ency- 
clopedic naturalists such as Gesner; 
and some zoologists would not 
really feel at home with any pro- 
genitor predating John Hunter and 



Cuvier in the late eighteenth and 
early nineteenth century. 

Yet the roots of this modern 
science lie in the Middle Ages. 
The science historian Lynn White, 
Jr., suggests that the evidence for 
the origins of zoology might be 
found in places where scientists 
have seldom looked: 

It is strange that historians of science 
have paid so little attention to the 
development of the visual arts. Art, 
like science, normally deals with the 
objects of our physical environment, 
and both art and science therefore pre- 
sumably reflect any modification of 
attitude toward that environment. In 
view of the fact that the first stirrings 
of Western scientific curiosity are 
detected in the twelfth century, it is 
surely no coincidence that historians of 
medieval art have discovered a related 
change in the modes of aesthetic ex-

pression beginning about the year 1 140. 
The transition from Romanesque to 
Gothic charts the passage from an 
age indifferent to the investigation of 
nature to one deeply concerned with it. 

My own search for the roots of 
my field, zoology, began as a study 
of English bestiaries and soon de- 
veloped into an absorbing &quot;owl 
hunt.&quot;&quot; It took me to illuminations 
in 800-year-old manuscripts, to 
woodcarvings in Gothic cathedrals, 
and to a charming twelfth-century 
poem, &quot;The Owl and the Nightin- 
gale.&quot; In literature and naturalistic 
ail, in oral folklore and folk medi- 
cine, especially of the twelfth to 
fifteenth centuries, I found evidence 
that there were indeed those who 
were carefully observing the nat- 
ural world and recording their ac- 
curate perceptions of its inhabit- 
ants many centuries before zo- 
ology emerged as a recognizable 
discipline. 

I define a zoologist as one who 
is interested in animals, who care- 
fully and sympathetically observes 
and who accurately records what 
he learns about his subject. The 
methods of twentieth-century bi- 
ologists differ vastly from those of 
preceding centuries because new 
tools are available to us. But the 
philosophy upon which the study 
of nature is founded is not new: 
indeed, as the owl record wil 
show, it is far older than previously 
supposed. 

In Judeo-Christian tradition, owls 
were unclean. They were predators 
and carrion eaters, and they lived 
in desolate places. In the Old Testa- 
ment (Leviticus, chapter II) is the 
charge: 

And these are they which ye shall have 
in abomination among the fowls; they 
shall not be eaten, they are an abom- 
ination; the eagle, and the ossifrage. 



and the osprey, . . . And the white 
owl, and the cormorant, and the horned 
owl, . . . 

Presumably one had to know 
fowls and their habits well, in 
order to hold the right ones in 
abomination! 

In classical Greece, on the other 
hand, the owl was sacred to Athena, 
the warrior goddess of superior 
wisdom, who was also thought to 
be capable of seeing in the dark. 
Athene iioctiui. the little owl that 
bears the name of the goddess, is 
so common in southern Greece that 
there is a saying, &quot;bringing owls to 
Athens,&quot;&quot; with a meaning rather 
like &quot;carrying coals to Newcastle.&quot;&quot; 
Coins of the period had the head 
of Athena on one side: on the other 
was the little owl. Indeed, the coins 
were popularly known as &quot;owls&quot;&quot; 
or &quot;owl eyes.&quot;&apos; 

The intellectual decline that 
began with the Roman takeover 
might be said to be paralleled by a 
deterioration in the reputation of 
the owl. Pliny tells us what the 
Romans thought of owls: 

The scritch owl betokeneth always 
some heavy news, and is most exe- 
crable and accursed in the presaging 
of public affairs. He keepeth ever in 
the deserts, and loveth not only such 
unpeopled places, but also those that 
are horribly hard of access. In truth, 
he is the very monster of the night, 
neither crying, nor singing out clear, 
but uttering a certain groan of doleful 
moaning. And, therefore, if he be seen 
either within cities or otherwise abroad 
in any place, it is not for good, but 
prognosticateth some fearful misfor- 
tune. 

From Pliny also come indications 
about the usefulness of the owl to 
the medical practitioner, and it is 
worth remembering that recorded 
folk medicine reflects a much older 
tradition than its time. What Pliny 



records was probably common 
belief in his day — he would not 
have seemed so credulous to his 
contemporaries. 

A recipe for pains in the sinews: 
&quot;a horned owPs head, taken in 
honey, with root of a lily.&quot; Cat- 
aracts are cured by &quot;the fresh gall 
of the axio, a kind of owl whose 
feathers twitch like ears&quot;&quot; (or you 
can use &quot;the heads and tails of 
mice reduced to ash, or pounded 
snails, or a viper burned alive in 
a new earthenware jug&quot;&quot;). For 
drunkenness, &quot;the eggs of an owl 
shall be given for three days in 
wine,&quot;&quot; and owls&quot; eggs or the blood 
of an owl chick are effective in 
making the hair curly. 

Another popular belief recorded 




^ 




lo: 



by Pliny was that owls hatch tail 
first because the weight of the head 
turns the egg wrong way up, and 
the chick thus &quot;presents its hinder 
parts for the mother to cherish.&quot; 
To catch an owl, you should fix it 
with your eyes, then walk slowly 
around its perch three times, and 
the owl will twist its head otf. 

Some of this Roman and pre- 
Roman folklore was carried over 
into Britain with the conquest. 
Other beliefs and legends involving 
the owl were common throughout 
Europe, but their origin is lost to 
us. For instance, a farmer who 
persuaded an owl to live in his barn 
felt himself privileged to have ac- 
quired a guardian spirit and, in- 
cidentally, a good mouse catcher. 
One can still see barns with an 
&quot;owl place&quot; built in under the 
eaves. 

Many of these legends were af- 
fected by Christianity, which 
gained such a strong hold on the 
medieval world. Of the few books 
circulating during the Middle Ages, 
one of the most popular, other than 
the Bible, was the bestiary. The 
bestiary was based on a fifth-cen- 
tury Greek or Alexandrian natural 
history, the Physiologtis, a catalog 
describing the attributes of some 
fifty animals, including the owl. 
During ensuing centuries, the 
bestiary was copied and recopied 



by medieval scholars, sometimes 
rendered into verse, often illus- 
trated (especially in the English 
versions), and frequently embel- 
lished by the monks who did the 
copying and illustrations. 

To understand what happened to 
the animal descriptions in the 
written record, it is important to 
remember that this was an age of 
faith. As the Roman Empire deteri- 
orated, the Church stepped in to 
provide the only social order and 
stability that were to be available 
for many centuries. The prevailing 
temperament, fostered by the 
Church, was otherworldly: the 
emphasis was on eternal salvation. 
It suited the purposes of the Church 
to instruct its unlettered people by 
use of picture books and fables. 

In this context, the bestiary 
evolved into a series of accounts 
of what animals symbolized, what 
moral lesson was depicted by the 
real or supposed attributes of each 
creature. Saint Augustine even 
went so far as to say that what 
mattered was not whether an ani- 
mal existed, but what it meant. 
Every part of an animal that was 
red symbolized the blood of Christ; 
the hatching of eggs was a reminder 
of the Resurrection; the predator 
and his prey represented the mortal 
struggle against the forces of sin; 
the nurturing of the young was a 



mirror of the love of God for his 
people. The bestiarist did not ignore 
or deny nature — he read into nature 
what the Church wished its people 
to know. 

The treatment of the owl in bes- 
tiaries typifies this allegorical 
process. From a twelfth-century 
bestiary: &quot;The owl Noctua, is so 
called because it flies at night. It 
cannot see by day, because its sight 
is weakened by the rising splendor 
of the sun. Owls thus represent the 
Jews, who refuse redemption. They 
love darkness more than light.&quot; An- 
other twelfth-century account car- 
ries this &quot;reasoning&quot; one step 
further: it avers that, since the 
Jews are backward, the owl also 
flies backward! 

The owl is described as a dirty 
bird that pollutes its own nest, 
frequents ruins and graveyards, 
and foretells doom. If an owl hoots 
near a sick person&apos;s house for 
three nights, that person will die. 
The screeching of an owl portends 
evil for a child that is born or means 
that a maiden will lose her virginity. 

By the thirteenth century, the 
bestiary had grown to include about 
150 animals, and the English ver- 
sions, at least, distinguished be- 
tween Noctua, the night owl; Bubo, 
the eagle owl; and Nicticorax, the 
night raven, also a kind of owl. 
This suggests that several different

kinds of owls were known to occur, 
although which of the now recog- 
nized species were intended is not 
clear. Five species of owls are 
native to Britain (the tawny, long- 
eared, short-eared, barn, and in the 
north, the snowy), the eagle owl is 
listed as a rare visitor, and the 
little owl, Athene, was introduced 
in the nineteenth century. 

In popular belief, owls were 
thought to drink the oil from church 
lamps, a story that may have arisen 
as the fabrication of some sacristan 
attempting to explain the rapid dis- 
appearance of the valuable oil. 
This story is repeated in the text 
accompanying a charming woodcut 
in a late-fifteenth-century incu- 
nabulum entitled Hortiis Sanitatiis 
(&quot;Garden of Health&quot;). The book is 
primarily an herbal, listing the 
medicinal and culinary values of 
plants, but it includes almost one 
hundred entries on animals and 
even a section on rocks. 

A number of accounts have dealt 
with the zoologically accurate ob- 
servation that an owl is sometimes 
mobbed by smaller birds. Aristotle 
described the scene as involving 
admiration of the owl. And a fable 
of Aesop described the small birds 
as coming to seek wisdom from the 
owl, who had earlier warned them 
to beware of the hunter with the 
arrow: he would one day fit the 
arrow shaft with their own feathers 
and kill them with it. (The wise 
owl in legend was also the first to 
see the danger of mistletoe, which 
would be used in making birdlime 
to trap small birds.) But most mob- 
bing scenes clearly depict the 
smaller birds as defending their

many creatures to be found on

&quot;Monk&apos;s Sketchbook.&quot; The monk 
who carved the owl, above right,

to ridicule a pompous bishop.

space against the invader, who is 
unaccustomed to being abroad in 
daylight. The allegory was drawn: 
the owl represents Christ, who was 
&quot;despised and rejected of men.&quot; 
Similarly, owl skins were nailed to 
barn doors by German farmers 
seeking protection against light- 
ning. The parallel with the Cruci- 
fixion is apparent. 

A twelfth-century poem clearly 
indicates that, beneath these alle- 
gorical overtones, the true reason 
for the mobbing was understood. 




Courtauld Institute ot Art 

The nightingale, a traditional en- 
emy, taunts the owl: 

I know how cruelly you attack 
Small birds who cannot fight 

you back; 
At every opportunity 
You peck and tear them wantonly. 
And that is why all birds 

detest you. 
Why when they find you they 

molest you. 
Screeching and crying as 

they chase 
And mob you till you leave 

the place. 
Even the tiniest of tits 
Would gladly tear you into 

bits! 
For you are loathsome through 

and through 
And wholly hateful to the view. 

The Owl and the Nightingale, 

translated from Old English by 

Brian Stone 

Indeed, the mobbing phenom- 
enon was put to use in the service 
of man: bird baiting was a standard 
form of hunting, and a stuffed owl 
was often used to decoy songbirds 
to a branch smeared with sticky 
birdlime. How else could four and 
twenty blackbirds — apparently the 



requisite number for one pie — have 
been captured? 

The mobbing scenes depicted in 
manuscript illuminations and wood- 
carvings display a sense of propor- 
tion and a degree of naturalism 
unusual for the art of earlier cen- 
turies. In a delightful miniature 
from a twelfth-century manuscript, 
the magpie is clearly recognizable 
as the leader of the attack and can 
almost be heard protesting to the 
indifferent owl. The branch on 
which the birds are perched has a 
pleasing curve, although its leaves 
are stylized and botanically unrec- 
ognizable. Two of the attackers are 
truly airborne. The background is 
in the geometric &quot;diapered&quot; pattern 
supposed to represent stars in the 
sky. 

About the middle of the twelfth 
century, man&apos;s attitude toward the 
natural world began to change, and 
art historians detect a trend toward 
greater naturalism in art. This was 
the time of transition from the 
Romanesque (Norman) to the 
Gothic style in architecture. The 
Carolingian churches had been 
decorated with rigid, stylized rep- 
resentations of plants, but now 
there was a new freedom: the stone- 
mason seems to have had the very 
plant before him and to have tried 
to represent it accurately. In the 
foliated capitals of the early twelfth 
century, &quot;one cannot be sure that 
the Romanesque sculptor was even 
thinking of leaves when he chiselled 
his boldly ornamental patterns.&quot; 
But by the end of the twelfth cen- 
tury, &quot;the flora begins to become 
indented, lobed, elaborated, but it 
is still abstract.&quot; And then 
&quot;about 1205 one finds intricately 
carved grape leaves ... at Char- 
tres; . . . and by about 1230 many 
species are clearly recognizable.&quot; 

There were small hints of change 
in the climate of the times, al- 
though there was certainly no wide- 
spread intellectual movement. The 
spokesmen for the new order were 
rebels who dared to challenge the 
authority of the Church (while 
working within it) and were prob- 
ably fortunate not to have ended 
at the stake. The evidence for the 
new naturalism is not to be found 
in the written record, which could 
never have been abundant at a time 



105 



when every manuscript had to be 
laboriously copied by hand. The 
evidence is mostly in folklore and 
literature and art, where modern 
historians of science have seldom 
looked. 

The medieval naturalist shows 
that he knew the place of the owl 
in animal classification: the claws 
and the strong, hooked beak — the 
key taxonomic characters used 
today — are never missed by the 
artist. A thirteenth-century bestiary 
owl vies with the somewhat 
flowery script for the viewer&apos;s at- 
tention. The feathers are stylized, 
the stance a bit too horizontal — 
but the claws are entirely realistic. 
The beak even shows the external 
nares, and the artist was apparently 
so intent on showing the true shape 
of the beak that he even pictured 
the curve in a front-view portrait of 
the face (an artistic technique used 
by Picasso in more recent times)! 

The twelfth-century poet cited 
earlier also knew the key charac- 
teristics of his bird. In a final ex- 
change with the nightingale, the 
owl accuses her opponent of unfair 
tactics in calling forth the song- 
birds to defend her, rather than 
submitting their debate to impartial 
adjudication as agreed at the outset. 
Owl points out that she, too, could 
summon an even more formidable 
array of defenders: 

For birds with claws all sharp and 

bent 
And great hooked beaks for tearing 

meant 
Are my relations, all of whom 
If I requested help, would come. 

Other aspects of owl morphology 
were carefully and accurately re- 
corded: the flat face with large 
eyes and binocular vision, the 
cheek whiskers at the fringe of the 
face mask, the ear tufts, the upright 
stance. Sometimes these prominent 
features are caricatured for em- 
phasis, as in the face mask of a 
Norwich Cathedral carving or the 
ear tufts of a fifteenth-century min- 
iature, in which the head feathers 
parallel the outspread wings, and 
the bird seems to be posing briefly 
for the viewer before takeoff. 

Habitat selection by the owl was 
known to medieval scholars: the 
preference for ivy and oak, the use 



of another bird&apos;s nest. In a wood- 
carving at Saint David&apos;s Church in 
Pembroke, an owlet seems about 
to try his wings from a perch 
among entirely realistic ivy. 

Although ecology is a twentieth- 
century term and a modern dis- 
cipline, the medieval naturalist 
knew the owl&apos;s ecological niche. 
This bird is a cat with wings. A 
hunting scene in the border of a 
fourteenth-century romance shows a 
remarkably catlike owl sitting at 
the top of a tree (but, interestingly, 
not the target of the archer). When 
the poet&apos;s owl boasts about the 
service she performs for the church; 
one imagines a barnyard mouser 
(feline) having the same pride in 
her profession: 

Nightly in God&apos;s holy house 
And in the barns, I hunt the 

mouse. 
I love to cleanse of filthy mice 
The church, beloved beyond all 

price. 
If I can stop it, I declare 
That nothing vile shall enter there. 

The owl belongs with the preda- 
tors; it is often shown with its 
captured prey. One of two owls in a 
twelfth-century bestiary stands on a 
mouse that can almost be heard ut- 
tering its last squeal, and a beautiful 
choir-stall woodcarving at Norwich 
Cathedral has an owl with a rodent 
in its beak. Owl pellets were known, 
although La Fontaine, the French 
Aesop, apparently thought they 
were mummified mice: one fable 
describes how an owl that had 
caught more mice than it could eat 
saved the rest in the bottom of a 
hollow tree, having first nipped off 
their paws so they couldn&apos;t run 
away! 

In popular tradition, the owl has 
had a somewhat unsavory reputa- 
tion as a bird of ill omen and is 
associated with the occult. One 
commonplace observation is that if 



you are afraid of something, you 
can take the edge off your fear by 
poking fun at the source of your 
apprehensions. So the owl, ma- 
ligned throughout much of the long 
history of his association with man, 
was at times an object of derision. 
An owl in a Windsor Cathedral 
carving is a case in point. In Gothic 
churches, most of the choir-stall 
embellishment was done by master 
craftsmen, but the misericord carv- 
ings were often done by the monks. 
Apparently the monks sometimes

tseized the opportunity to caricature 
Ithe bishop: the Windsor owl has a 
Ivery avian body, but the face mask 
fdisplays the carefully groomed 
vhiskers of, one imagines, a some- 
[what pompous superior. Even the 
[archbishop and cardinals were not 
I immune: a delightful miniature from 
[a fourteenth-century manuscript 
[has a fairly realistic, if slightly 
[supercilious, owl wearing a red hat. 
In a fourteenth-century Italian 
[manuscript miniature, the owl&apos;s ear 
Itufts are represented as donkey&apos;s 



ears and the tail is an ivy leaf. The 
bird seems to prance across center 
stage with one wing poised, owl 
eyes in his donkey face watching 
for the reaction of the viewer. In 
German tradition today, the owl 
occupies something of the same 
niche as the ass, representative of 
a stupid or foolish fellow. 

But despite these humorous rep- 
resentations, the owl record shows 
that many medieval artists saw the 
familiar bird as an object of interest 
and beauty and presented it ac- 



curately. This record, from as early 
as the twelfth century, shows us the 
first evidence of a modern scientific 
approach in biology: the careful, 
systematic, and sympathetic obser- 
vation of animals, plants, and nat- 
ural phenomena. Textbooks of 
zoology did not exist during the 
Middle Ages, but there were intelli- 
gent observers of nature during that 
long, silent period. To find these 
kindred spirits, we must look to the 
folklore, the humanistic literature, 
and the art of the times. D

The Modern Look 
of Ice Age Art 



by Gerald Oster 



Although made thousands of 
years ago, cave paintings 
and figurines of this early 
period seem quite up-to-date 

One of the world&apos;s most famous 
art treasures, the Ice Age wall and 
ceiling paintings of the prehistoric 
cave of Altamira in northeastern 
Spain, was generally considered a 
fraud when discovered in 1879. A 
typical reaction was that the poly- 
chrome scenes of bison were exe- 
cuted by a French artist who 
happened to be visiting the Span- 
ish nobleman and amateur arche- 
ologist whose twelve-year-old 
daughter first noticed the paint- 
ings. A prominent French arche- 
ologist of the period, Gabriel de 
Mortillet, spoke for his peers 
when he stated that &quot;primitive 
man could not have painted with 
that slightly mediocre air of 
modernity.&quot; Indeed, the paintings 
of Altamira do have a modern 
appearance and could pass for 
nineteenth- or twentieth-century 
Western art.

Ice Age (more specifically. Upper 
Paleolithic) paintings exists in the 
Lascaux cave in southwestern 
France. This cave was found in 
1940 by four schoolboys who were 
searching for a lost dog. Like 
Altamira, the Lascaux cave pri- 
marily contains animal paintings 
that are thought to be associated 
with the hunt. The paintings con- 
sist of many overlays executed 
during diflFerent eras. Archeologists 
who have analyzed the Lascaux 
paintings have, to some extent, 
traced the evolution of the various 
styles employed. 

Less spectacular than the paint- 



ings of Altamira and Lascaux are 
the small Ice Age ivory carvings 
and clay sculptures excavated by 
archeologists at sundry sites ex- 
tending from Spain to the Ukraine. 
Many of these portable objects, 
known as mobiliers, have decora- 
tions that were evidently adopted 
by Neolithic man and were sub- 
sequently passed on to the ancient 
Greeks, the Vikings, and even- 
tually to modern generations. Thus 
we are the inheritors of Ice Age 
art. Some mobiliers, the so-called 
Venus statuary, are abstractions of 
women that could be mistaken in 
a photograph for sculpture by 
such contemporary masters as 
Brancusi, Arp, Lipchitz, or 
Moore. (Engravings, photomurals 
of cave paintings, and carvings of 
prehistoric Europe will be on dis- 
play at the American Museum of 
Natural History through the middle 
of January 1979.) 

In their search for naturalism, 
the artisans of the Upper Paleo- 
lithic period (sometime between 
20,000 and 10,000 B.C.) used artis- 
tic devices known as depth clues. 
Those early craftsmen must have 
wrestled with a problem faced by 
artists from the time of the Italian 
Renaissance down to the present, 
namely, how to give a three- 
dimensional, spatial feeling to 
illustrations on a two-dimensional 
surface. Like present-day art stu- 
dents, the artists of the Ice Age 
appear to have known those tricks 
of the trade that create an illusion 
of depth in a painting. Some of the 
paintings in Lascaux, for example, 
contain depth clues referred to as 
interposition and perspective. In 
other paintings, the roundness of 
the backs and bellies of animals

found in Austria.

is suggestfed by the subtle use of 
shading and color. In a few cases, 
the natural curvature of the cave 
surface was used to enhance the 
illusion of roundness. 

Perhaps the simplest depth clue 
to execute is interposition. If the 
image of one object overlaps that 
of another, the overlapping figure 
appears to be in the foreground 
and the overlapped figure in the 
background. This effect is 
achieved, for instance, with a 
group of reindeer in a painting at 
Lascaux. Many of the animal fig- 
ures at Lascaux were overlapped 
because they were painted during 
different eras. But all the animals 
in the reindeer group seem to have 
been rendered at about the same 
time; in terms of style and size, 
they are the same. The over- 
lapping of these animals manages 
to suggest a herd and at the same 
time gives a three-dimensional 
feeling. 

The reindeer of Lascaux illus- 
trate still another depth clue, 
namely, perspective. In the rein- 
deer painting the depth clue is that 
of twisted perspective. If a rein- 
deer was shown in strict profile, 
only one horn would be visible. 
This is the technique used in some 
of the animal drawings at Lascaux. 
If, on the other hand, the artist 
wanted to show that a reindeer 
has two horns and at the same 
time wanted to keep the animal&apos;s 
muzzle in profile, two horns would 
have to be drawn on the profile in 
&quot;twisted profile.&quot; The artists who 
painted the reindeer at Lascaux 
evidently wished to show the full 
magnificence of the antlers while 
keeping the animal&apos;s body in pro- 
file. The resultant use of twisted 
perspective suggests the dynamism

wall painting in the Lascaux 
cave were made during different 
eras. The reindeer in the

of a moving herd and creates the 
impression that the reindeer are 
turning their heads. This two- 
aspect representation has its mod- 
ern counterpart in portraits pro- 
duced by Picasso about 1940. 

Perspective of a technically even 
more advanced level was also 
achieved by Ice Age artists. Some 
of the Lascaux bulls and many of 
the Altamira bison are shown in 
three-quarter perspective. In some 
cases the bison appear to be charg- 
ing close to the observer. Their 
front hoofs are larger than their 
rear ones in accordance with the 
standard rules of perspective. 

Examples of shading to enhance 
the impression of an animal&apos;s 
roundness are seen in the bison 
paintings of Altamira. Instead of 
sharply delineating the outline of 
the animal, the edges are softened 
with gradations of gray to suggest 
the manner in which shadow ap- 
pears around a circular object. 
The use of gradation of shading in 
the manner employed by Ice Age 
artists is also a feature of Euro- 
pean art, particularly of the realist 
school of nineteenth-century 
France as exemplified in the work 
of Courbet. 

An extension of the use of 
gradients to achieve solidity is the 
application of gradations of color. 
This technique can be seen at 
Lascaux where the bodies of some 
animals are painted in subtle 
shades of yellow, brown, and red. 
The color-gradient technique em- 
ployed to impart solidity is a fea- 
ture of some of the paintings made 
by Cezanne in his later period, 
about 1875 to 1900; art historians 
acknowledge him as the first mod- 
em artist to deliberately use this 
technique. 

Textural effects were achieved 



In the search for naturalism, 

this painting of a horse from 

the Lascaux cave relies on 

outlining and shading, two 

devices still in use. The pigment 

in the horse&apos;s mane was applied 

with a blowpipe, producing 

a soft, matted effect. 



by Ice Age painters in a variety 
of ways. One method, widely em- 
ployed in the caves of the Dor- 
dogne Valley in southwest France, 
is the application of pigment by 
means of a blowpipe. That tech- 
nique, as applied to the mane of 
a horse at Lascaux, gives a soft 
texture to the hair as if the mane 
were matted. 

Cave paintings, no matter where 
found, seldom show human repre- 



sentations. But there are many 
examples of Ice Age figurines that 
represent women. These objects 
are of fired clay or are carved 
from lignite or ivory. The exag- 
gerated emphasis on breasts, but- 
tocks, and vulva have suggested to 
archeologists that the figures are 
fertility charms. Sometimes the 
female form was completely ab- 
stract, represented as a round 
stone disk with a single cleavage. 




112 



Archeologists usually attribute 
this trend to the abstract to a late 
development in the history of Ice 
Age art. A similar trend can be 
found in Chinese calligraphy and 
in European painting and sculp- 
ture of the past hundred years. 

Much has been written about 
the motivation of the artists of 
Altamira and Lascaux. Were they 
propelled by some deep religious 
conviction or were their paintings 



a form of self-expression, art 
created for art&apos;s sake? As with any 
other work of art, Ice Age painting 
stands on its own. Motivation is not 
relevant to the products of crea- 
tion. Clearly, artists of the Ice Age 
were keen observers of animals in 
the wild. Their paintings were often 
executed with superb skill. The 
means they employed showed that 
in many cases they were masters of 
sophisticated techniques, some of 



which were rediscovered by a new 
generation of artists late in the 
nineteenth-century. 



Gerald Oster, a professor of 
biophysics at the Mount Sinai 
School of Medicine of the City 
University of New York, is also 
a part-time artist. He has created 
a mathematical art form known as 
moire patterns.

Oceans, Glaciers, 
and Mists 



by Richard Goody 



In one or another of its 
three forms, water plays a 
key role on Venus and Mars 
as well as on Earth 

There is little need to dwell on 
the unique importance of water for 
our own planet. Water covers some 
75 percent of the earth&apos;s surface; 
can exist in liquid, solid, or vapor 
form; and continually reshapes the 
small fraction of the earth&apos;s surface 
that rises above the oceans. Water 
is a crucial element in our meteor- 
ology, both as a source of heat 
released during condensation and 
as the substance forming the clouds 
that control the solar radiation 
reaching the planet&apos;s surface. As a 
chemical it is a powerful solvent, 
is highly reactive, and plays an 
essential part in many familiar proc- 
esses. Above all, it is singularly 
important for biology, forming the 
bulk of most animal and vegetable 
tissues. Few life forms carry more 
than two or three days supply of 
this essential substance and all 
credible theories of the origin of life 
involve the presence of liquid 
water. 

For more than a decade we have 
known that water vapor exists in 
the atmospheres of Mars and Venus 
and probably also in the outer 



A satellite picture of the Arctic 
Ocean shows a large crack in 
the thin skin of ice. Water in 
this region falls in the form 
of ice but precipitation is 
very low. From a climatic 
point of view, the North Pole 
might be considered a desert.

solar system. The amounts detected 
are small, less than a thousandth of 
an inch if formed into a condensed 
layer, as compared with an inch or 
two on the earth. Nevertheless, the 
presence or absence of water can be 
almost as important for other 
planets as for our own, and I shall 
use it as a unifying topic, a text 
for the day, which transcends the 
classical divisions between studies 
of the earth and studies of other 
planets. 

When I first began to write this 
article I was overwhelmed by the 
amount of material and the range of 
intriguing ideas that might interest 
the general reader. I have been 
selective and will present only a 
few topics to illustrate two general 
propositions: first, that many more 
facets of terrestrial behavior than 
are obvious depend upon water; 
second, that an overall view of the 
role of water on Venus, Mars, and 
Earth can be rewarding. 

With respect to the first, I will 
deal with two unfamiliar ideas 
about the earth that are important 
for climatic change — the distribu- 
tion of heat by ocean currents and 
the way in which permanent ice 
sheets function in a global context. 

Let me start with the fundamen- 
tal cause of atmospheric and 
oceanic motions — at least in the 
middle latitudes — namely, the 
transport of heat from the tropical 
regions, where most sunlight is 
deposited, to the polar regions, 
where the average annual insolation 
is small. For Earth, approximately 
half of this transport is associated 
with the movement of water, either 
in the atmosphere or by means of 
ocean currents. The division of the 
oceans into basins in conjunction 
with the earth&apos;s rotation leads to 
concentrated motions known as 
currents. The best known to the 
North Atlantic community is the 
Gulf Stream, which is largely re- 
sponsible for making northern 
Europe habitable. I wish to direct 
attention, however, to two other 
currents, the Peruvian Coastal Cur- 
rent and the Tropical Counter Cur- 
rent. 

The most important feature of 
Peruvian coastal waters is the up- 
welling of cold, plankton-rich ant- 
arctic water, which creates one of 
the bases of the Peruvian economy 
(fish, guano, and related products) 
and is responsible for the coastal 
climate. The cold coastal waters 



and the accompanying stratus 
clouds give rise to a cool desert — 
watered only by the few rivers 
flowing from the mountain ranges. 

Tropical water, on the other 
hand, contains less nutrient, and 
evaporation from the warm waters 
often leads to torrential rains. Soon 
after Christmas each year, the 
boundary between the Tropical 
Counter Current (which flows close 
to the equator from west to east) 
and the Peruvian Coastal Current 
typically moves southward to about 
2°S, in a phenomenon called El 
Nino (&quot;the child&quot;). But on some 
occasions (most recently in 1972- 
73) the boundary strays as far south 
as Lima (14°S). This flow of warm 
water results in an ecological dis- 
aster. Fish die and putrefy, dis- 
coloring ship hulls. The fishing in- 
dustry is brought to a halt and the 
guano industry is affected. At the 
same time, the coastal strip, con- 
taining most of Peru&apos;s production 
and agriculture, is subject to dis- 
astrous flooding and erosion. This 
phenomenon demonstrates how de- 
pendent we can be on minor per- 
turbations in the state of the oceans. 

Among the inner planets, only 
the earth has liquid water on its 
surface. Mars is too cold and Venus 
is too hot for oceans to exist, at 
least at the present time. I will 
therefore turn to my second ex- 
ample of water-dependent terres- 
trial behavior, involving the flow of 
ice sheets rather than liquid water. 

As has already been pointed out, 
one function of atmospheric mo- 
tions in the middle latitudes is to 
transport heat toward the poles. In 
doing so, these movements usually 
also transport water. This is be- 
cause the intimate contact between 
atmosphere and oceans insures that 
the air is close to saturation with 
respect to water. The water content 
of saturated air increases very 
rapidly with temperature so that 
warm air is moist and cold air is 
dry. Much of the heat exchange 
between the equator and the poles 
is caused by the mixing of warm — 
and moist — tropical air with cold — 
and dry — polar air, with water 
generally moving poleward in the 
same direction as heat. The heat 
carried to the poles is radiated away 
into space. The water, however, 
must precipitate and we must there- 
fore identify the process responsible 
for carrying the water away. 

Large amounts of water are not

involved. The precipitation in the 
polar regions is about an inch a year, 
so that, climatically speaking, the 
poles are deserts and among the 
driest areas on the earth. The water 
falls in the form of ice. This does 
not create a problem in the Arctic 
Ocean basin since the Gulf Stream 
penetrates there and keeps it liquid 
except for a thin surface skin of ice. 
The precipitation thus simply aug- 
ments to a trivial degree the return 
flow from the Arctic Ocean to the 
global ocean system. 

The Antarctic continent is more 
interesting since the precipitation 
there occurs on what is now a land- 
mass. The falling ice collects at 
a rate of one or two miles in 100,000 
years. The antarctic icecap has 
built up to about two miles above 
sea level, but the downward slope 
toward the periphery is enough for 
glacial flow to make a reverse cir- 
cuit, returning water to the oceans 
in the form of ice calving from 
the continental ice shelf. The flow 
of ice from the shelf is at the rate 
of about 300 feet per year. 

This water cycle, involving mete- 
orological, glaciological, and ocean- 
ographic flows, is not only intriguing 
but also probable for any planet far 
enough from the sun for ice to form 
at the poles and whose atmosphere is 
saturated with water vapor. At one 
time it looked as if the Martian 
atmosphere might be saturated, at 
least at nighttime, in which case a 
similar water cycle might be ex- 
pected. The precipitation at the 
poles would be a few hundredths of 
an inch per year, and elevation 
differences as great as five miles 
could build up with a glacial flow of 
about fifty feet per year from poles 
to equator. 

I now doubt whether this happens 
on Mars, but its possibility was one 
reason for the Viking lander re- 
search with which I was associated. 
Nevertheless, there is a growing 
consensus that there are large 
amounts of ice below the Martian 
surface. This ice may not be visible 
since it would be covered by dust 
and debris, just as ice below the 
arctic tundra is covered with soil 
and vegetation. 

Since water is so important in the 
inner solar system, it is proper to 
inquire. Where did it come from? 
To answer this question we must 
turn to the early history of the solar 
system. Geologists and geochemists 
present a consistent picture of the

1979 is the eighth year in which we 
operate our extremely successful 
cruises in privately chartered ships to 
the Galapagos Islands o(f Ecuador; 
and we are the only company which 
offers leisurely cruises designed lor 
the discerning traveler who is inter- 
ested in ecology, wildlife and photog- 
raphy. 

All other cruises have become shorter 
and superficial, in order to cram as 
many people as possible into the ships&apos; 
schedules. 

For budget-minded travelers we repeat 
our popular 

^Discover 
Galapagos 

cruises in the 60-passenger mv 
Iguana&apos;, accompanied by our own 
cruising staff including a physician 
and an eminent naturalist leader who 
gives talks and leads us in the field: 

March 25 to April 10. 1979 

with Dr. Robert C. Szaro 

US Fish and Wildlile Research Center, 

Laurel. Maryland 

October 28 to November 13. 1979 

with Dr. Jack L. Throp 

Director 0/ the Honolulu Zoo. Hawaii 

We consider a few days insufficient at 
these unique islands and provide ten 
full days there, with ample time for 
daily shore expeditions under expert 
guidance and including visits to Tower 
island with its frigatebird colonies, not 
reached on any cruises other than 
ours. 

Before these cruises, we spend three 
days in Quito. Ecuador&apos;s lovely capi- 
tal, with excursions in the Andes, and 
then make the spectacular road jour- 
ney to Ihe coast. 



We also offer intimate cruises tor

earth-moon system slowly evolving 
from an event that took place about 
4.5 billion years ago — the con- 
densation of the solar system from 
a rotating disk of hot plasma, which 
probably had the same average 
composition as the sun and stars 
have today. 

To describe this cosmic mix in the 
simplest terms we may separate the 
elements into three general groups 
ranked according to abundance: 
first, hydrogen and helium, the 
lightest elements; then, oxygen, 
nitrogen, and carbon, classed with 
others under the term volatiles; and 
finally, iron, magnesium, and 
silicon, classed as refractories. Hy- 
drogen and helium are between 100 
and 1,000 times as abundant as the 
volatiles, which are, in turn, about 
10 times as abundant as the refrac- 
tories. Water (a compound of hy- 
drogen and oxygen) and carbon 
dioxide (a compound of carbon and 
oxygen) belong with the second, or 
volatile, group. 

Accepted theory states that as 
the plasma gradually cools, the first 
elements to condense — in the form 
of small dust particles — will be the 
refractories. The dust particles 
should collect quickly into planetes- 
imals (small, solid bodies) and the 
planetesimals into planets, whose 
composition will depend upon the 
temperature of condensation, but 
some mixture of refractories, sim- 
ilar to the observed composition of 
the inner planets, is likely. 

The planets will circulate through 
the remaining plasma, consisting 
principally of hydrogen, helium, 
and volatiles. At this point, the 
gravitational field of the planet will 
become effective and the planet can 
accrete a gaseous envelope from 
the gases. 

If all of these ideas are cor- 
rect — and they are strongly sup- 
ported by a wide range of evidence 
— we can assume that at an early 
stage the inner planets had primi- 
tive atmospheres that consisted 
mainly of hydrogen and helium. 
Since the present atmospheres are 
completely different, we must as- 
sume that subsequent events 
wrought major changes. From a 
variety of possibilities, one is de- 
rived from our recent understand- 
ing of the moon, which indicates 
that an intense meteoritic bombard- 
ment took place between 4.5 and 
3.9 billion years ago. The bombard- 
ing meteorites probably condensed

COLD! 



It&apos;s 10° outside . . . Even getting colder. So you bundle up in layers 
and layers of heavy clothes. First with long underwear . . . then 
bulky, restrictive thermalwear on top. 

Oh, you were warm, all right. Like in a 
Turkish bath. Because you began to perspire 
from all your activity. And perspiring in that 
mountain of clothes is like perspiring in a 
plastic bag! The perspiration is locked in. 
So there you are. Wet and miserable. 

But now, at last, Damart has solved 
the problem. Because Damart invented 
underwear that keeps you warm, dry 
and comfortable no matter how cold it 
is or how long you stay out. Under- 
wear that&apos;s soft and light so you can 
move easily. Underwear that lets the 
perspiration evaporate through so you 
always stay warm and dry next to your 
skin. 

Damart does this with a new miracle 
fabric — Thermolactyl. It not only re- 
tains and reflects your natural body 
warmth, it&apos;s knitted to let perspiration 
out! No other underwear does this! 
Damart Thermolactyl is so comfortable 
that the Mount Everest climbing expedition 
wears it. So does the Mt. McKinley Bicen- 
tennial Expedition and the U.S. Bobsled 
Team. Damart is also worn by the Chicago 
Bears Football Club, New England Patriots 
and Philadelphia Eagles.

River Safari 
in Borneo 

with visits to wildlife reserves and 
archaeological sites in Java and Bali 

APRIL 1 10 23,1979 
SEPTEMBER 2 TO 24. 1979 

Nine days are spent touring West and 
Central Java, including a three-day 
visit to the splendid Ujung Kulon 
Nature Reserve, followed by a train 
journey to the Borobudur, the world&apos;s 
greatest religious monument, which 
we see at sunrise. 

We then fly to Borneo, to cruise for 
one week on the Mahakam river and 
its tributaries, striking deep into the 
Dayak country with its remarkable 
wildlife, where we attend village cer- 
emonies and sleep one night in a 
native longhouse. The tour ends with 
two days of well-earned comforts on 
the island of Bali, and is escorted 
by an accomplished leader.

in the outer solar system under 
colder circumstances than did the 
inner planets and therefore may 
have contained substantial quanti- 
ties of ices formed from the volatile 
elements and their compounds: 
water, methane, ammonia, and mix- 
tures thereof. This bombardment 
would have completely removed 
the primitive atmospheres of the 
planets and replaced the crusts 
with meteoritic debris. 

This brings us back to the ques- 
tion. Where did the present atmos- 
pheres of the inner planets come 
from, particularly the water? The 
late William Rubey, a well-known 
American geologist, offered an 
answer thirty years ago when he 
pointed out that there is a resem- 
blance between magmatic gases of 
several kinds, that is, gases within 
molten rock material, and the 
present atmosphere. It is possible 
that existing volcanoes, fumaroles, 
steam wells, and geysers may now 
be recycling material in our atmos- 
phere. Nevertheless, we believe 
that Rubey&apos;s hypothesis — that 
water, carbon dioxide, and other 
volatiles all come from the earth&apos;s 
crust — is essentially correct. More 
speculatively, the earth&apos;s crust may 
have formed from the same mete- 
oritic bombardment that shaped 
the lunar surface. 

If this picture is valid, it offers 
the basis for a most important, 
unifying hypothesis for the atmos- 
pheres of the inner solar system, 
namely, that their similarities and 
differences may be accounted for 
in terms of the same scenario in- 
volving tectonic processes releasing 
from the crust the same basic mix- 
ture of volatiles. Other evidence 
leads us to believe that both Mars 
and Venus are tectonically active, 
as is the earth, but the amount and 
rate of emission could vary from 
planet to planet. 

In case the adventurous nature 
of this hypothesis is not apparent, 
I should remind the reader of the 
large differences between these 
three inner planets in chemical 
composition, surface temperature, 
pressure, cloudiness, and many 
other aspects. I would like to dis- 
cuss two of these — surface tem- 
perature and chemical composition 
— in more detail. 

In &quot;Climate and the Planets&quot; 
(Natural History. January 1978), I 
described the runaway greenhouse 
effect caused by atmospheric water 



vapor and carbon dioxide. As these 
gases are slowly emitted from the 
crust, the sequence of events that 
follows will depend on the initial 
temperature of the planet, which 
depends, in turn, on the planet&apos;s 
proximity to the sun. For the 
coldest planet. Mars, the emitted 
water remains on the surface in 
the form of ice with only small 
amounts in the atmosphere in vapor 
form. That there is some water ice 
on Mars is certain: the residual 
summer polar caps are confidently 
identified as such. The possibility 
of much larger amounts of water 
bound up with the surface rocks 
must also be considered. 

For the earth, the hypothesis 
predicts that more water than on 
Mars will remain in the atmosphere 
in the form of vapor but that the 
bulk of it will condense as liquid 
to form the oceans. That picture 
is so familiar it does not need to 
be emphasized. For Venus we con- 
cluded that all the water should 
remain in the atmosphere and that 
the screening effect for thermal 
radiation would greatly elevate the 
surface temperature, perhaps ex- 
plaining why the surface of Venus 
is now at a dull red heat. 

Thus, the same sequence of 
events that we have hypothesized 
leads to different physical states for 
the water and different surface 
temperatures on the inner planets. 
These two factors, in turn, can 
greatly influence the chemical his- 
tory of the atmosphere subsequent [ 
to its emission since different chem- 
ical and photochemical reactions 
will operate under different phys- 
ical conditions. This chemical his- 
tory is a long and complex story, 
involving among other things the 
influence of living organisms in our 
own atmosphere. We believe that 
we understand a few of the proc- 
esses involved, but we are a long 
way from accounting for the com- 
plete chemical history of any 
planet. If we do succeed, it may 
only serve to disprove our hypothet- 
ical, unified view of the inner 
planets. 

One part of the story, however, 
can be isolated, namely, the escape 
of chemical species from the 
evolved planet back into space. 
The rate of escape depends prima- 
rily on two factors — the gravitational 
field of the planet and the tem- 
perature of the atoms at the height, 
or level, above the surface from

which they can escape to space. 
Both factors differ from planet to 
planet: the former depends on the 
planet&apos;s mass; the latter, upon its 
closeness to the sun and the chem- 
ical composition of its atmosphere. 

Before going further, let us pose 
a relevant question. If Venus&apos;s high 
surface temperature is related to the 
emission of tectonic water, where 
is that water now? There are small 
amounts of vapor in the Venusian 
atmosphere but they are trivial 
compared with the amount ex- 
pected from our general hypothesis. 
Exposure of water vapor to sunlight 
can change the problem since the 
water will dissociate into its com- 
ponents, hydrogen and oxygen. It 
is possible that oxygen has reacted 
with the planet&apos;s surface material 
but where, then, is the hydrogen? 
One possible answer is that it may 
have escaped from the planet back 
into interplanetary space. 

For matter to escape from a 
planet, whether it be an atom or a 
spacecraft, its velocity must exceed 
the planet&apos;s escape velocity, about 
six and a half miles per second for 
Venus. For a given velocity, the 
energy of a body is proportional 
to its mass. Thus, for a given 
energy, the lighter the atom, the 
larger the velocity and the greater 
the probability that it can escape 
into space. The energy source is the 
thermal agitation of the atoms at 
the so-called escape level. This is 
the altitude, high in the atmosphere, 
from which an outgoing atom will 
find no others with which to col- 
lide. It is therefore the height 
from which atoms can escape if 
they have the necessary velocity. 
The temperature at Venus&apos;s escape 
level is about 300°K. At this tem- 
perature about one hydrogen atom 
in ten million can exceed the escape 
velocity and hydrogen can leak 
away in a period that is short com- 
pared with the age of the solar sys- 
tem. For oxygen, however, with 
sixteen times the atomic mass of 
hydrogen, the proportion of atoms 
with the escape velocity is so small 
that the species is, from our point 
of view, permanently bound to the 
planet. 

Turning again to Mars, I would 
like to mention some recent work 
related to our attempts to under- 
stand the subsurface reservoirs of 
water on that planet. Prior to the 
Viking mission we had measure- 
ments from ground-based tele- 



scopes indicating that the amount 
of water in the Martian atmosphere 
changed rapidly during the day, 
reaching a maximum at midday. 
We were able to show that this 
water could not all condense in the 
soil but must appear in part in the 
atmosphere in the form of a ground 
mist, starting at about 2:00 a.m., 
and lasting into the morning or pos- 
sibly until midday. Given the 
ground-based telescopic results, it 
appeared inevitable that the Viking 
lander would find itself in a moder- 
ately thick mist in the early morn- 
ing. 

As the spacecraft approached 
the planet, it took pictures of the 
morning terminator, that is, the 
dividing line between the unillumi- 
nated and illuminated parts of the 
planet&apos;s disk at dawn. One early 
picture showed the white mists we 
had anticipated along the termina- 
tor. This observation was never 
repeated, however, and when we 
eventually managed to have the 
lander cameras switched on in the 
morning, the landscape, to our 
chagrin, was as stark and clear as 
at any other time of day. 

Fortunately, a colleague per- 
severed and, using the lander cam- 
era in another mode, was able to 
show that there was indeed a mist 
at the predicted times, but that it 
was ten times thinner than we had 
predicted. The reason turned out to 
be a simple one, namely, the 
ground-based measurements were 
incorrectly interpreted; what was 
observed was, in effect, an optical 
illusion. Our theoretical under- 
standing was sound but the atmos- 
phere contained far less water 
near the ground than we had ex- 
pected. 

So, one more element fell into 
place in our understanding of water 
on Mars. We know something 
about the evaporation-condensa- 
tion processes in the polar caps; 
why the rare ice clouds form as and 
where they do; and how water con- 
denses in, and evaporates from, 
the Martian soil. We do not yet 
know how much subsurface ice 
there is, how deep it lies, how it 
flows — if it does — or if there are 
conditions under which it could 
have been liquid in some previous 
epoch. Nevertheless, the puzzle is 
slowly coming together. D

Why the 

Metropolitan Museum reproductions 
make superb presents 

Ihese reproductions are the only copies of the Museum&apos;s collections made 
exclusively by and for the Metropolitan Museum itself. 

f/S Because they can be made directly from the original works of art under 
Museum supervision and because the craftsmanship is of the highest quality, 
every copy is remarkably faithful to the spirit of the original. 

J5 The selection is surprisingly wide: ancient jewelry in gold and silver; 
Oriental and European porcelain; early American glass in crystal and rare 
colors; bronze from Egypt, Greece, China, and the medieval world; silver, 
pewter, brass, and pottery from Colonial America. 

^ The prices range from $7.50 for a Greek fourth-century B.C. golden dol- 
phin to $520.00 for an eighteenth -century Chinese export porcelain tea service 
decorated in a bold floral design of twenty-seven colors. 

SJ New pieces are added constantly, and the Museum publishes special 
catalogues of these every few months; the 116-page full-color Christmas 
Catalogue is now being issued. In addition to the reproductions, this year&apos;s 
catalogue illustrates new Christmas cards, stained glass, art books of particular 
interest, prints of rare Chinese and Japanese paintings, snowflakes, stars, and 
bells in gold and silver, together with more than one hundred other unusual 
presents including the 1979 Calendar, A Treasury of Far Eastern Art.

A Tale of Technology 
Gone Sour 



The Pesticide Conspiracy, by 
Robert van den Bosch. Doiihlcclciv&amp;Co.. $8.95: 192 pp. 

&quot;The idyllic world of beetles and 
butterflies has largely slipped away 
as I have become increasingly in- 
volved in the roaring pesticide con- 
troversy; a vicious, nerve-wracking 
imbroglio that has turned my en- 
tomological niche into a veritable 
hornet&apos;s nest,&quot; writes Robert van 
den Bosch in The Pesticide Con- 
spiracy. &quot;What is most saddening 
is that ... I have turned into a 
ruthless gut-fighter in a slugfest 
without rules or a semblance of 
fair play.&quot; 

This is a gut-fighter&apos;s book, one 
that will surely offend not only its 
wide range of targets but also more 
detached observers in the scientific 
world. What is one to think of a 
well-known scientist who salts his 
text with words like &quot;greed,&quot; 
&quot;rape,&quot; &quot;revulsion,&quot; and &quot;fools&quot; 



as freely as other entomologists 
might use &quot;labium&quot; or &quot;ecdysis&quot;? 
Indeed, what is one to think of a 
professor who openly compares the 
administrators of the great uni- 
versity that shelters him to &quot;a flock 
of frightened barnyard chickens&quot;? 
A van den Bosch could only 
appear and survive in California, 
where such elements as its varied 
history of pest control, the frenetic 
scramble to peddle chemicals to 
willing growers, and a state uni- 
versity system geared to accommo- 
date radicals of every stripe pro- 
duce a highly volatile social mix. 



Plagued by pests and chemical 
salesmen. California cotton 
growers applied pesticides in 
excessive dosages. The results were 
the irruption of new pests and 
spiraling costs.

cultists who shy from any taint ot 
chemicals with the same honor 
John the Baptist displayed for 
Salome&apos;s charms. &quot;We need pesti- 
cides,&quot; van den Bosch insists. 

But he studied at the University 
of California under men for whom 
the triumphs of biological pest con- 
trol before World War II still shone 
as both a monument and a promise. 
He became a specialist at the uni- 
versity in integrated pest control, 
where chemicals are but one aspect 
of a complex ecological process 
that depends on nature to do much 
of the work, holding pesticides, in 
reserve for the occasional but in- 
evitable moments when natural 
controls break down. &quot;The insects 
are their own worst enemies,&quot; he 
writes. 

Believing that pest control is a 
science and a process, van den 
Bosch watched in disbelief as his 
discipline fell under the control of 
those who saw it only as a sub- 
stance — a chemical whose sale and 
application would solve all of hu- 
manity&apos;s pest problems. For van 
den Bosch, success in dealing with 
those problems hinges on the out- 
come of the struggle between the 
ecologists and the salesmen. 

As its title implies, this is a 
cynical book. Its thesis is that cor- 
ruption lies everywhere in the pest 
control field — is, in fact, its very 
bone and sinew. There are no 
heroes. Van den Bosch&apos;s own dis- 
cipline is no better than the rest of 
them, and he quotes without demur 
a young colleague&apos;s definition of an 
entomologist as &quot;a dumb biolo- 
gist.&quot; He finds the Entomological 
Society of America rotten with the 
influence of the chemical compa- 
nies; its members beguiled by hos- 
pitality suites, fishing holidays, and 
for the more &quot;deserving&quot; among 
them, industry minigrants. 

In this book, chemical salesmen 
are &quot;rip-off artists,&quot; their execu- 
tives are &quot;Mafia capi,&quot; agricul-

tural commissioners are &quot;in collu- 
sion&quot; with the salesmen, the United 
States Department of Agriculture&apos;s 
officials spend most of their energy 
truckling to politicians who are 
themselves a part of the &quot;pesticide 
Mafia,&quot; and the land-grant uni- 
versities are mostly anachronisms 
whose viewpoint excludes all of 
society&apos;s interests except that of 
the powerful agribusiness pressure 
groups. 

Well, what about it? Is van den 
Bosch paranoid or an eco-freak 
bursting irresponsibly out of 
academe&apos;s closet? The tone is 
abusive, almost scurrilous at times, 
but the book&apos;s substance is difficult 
to challenge. This is not a compila- 
tion of public records, with an in- 
terpretation slapped onto it, but the 
outcry of a qualified entomologist, 
with a body of solid work behind 
him, recounting his experiences 
and perceptions while carrying out 
his duties at the University of Cali- 
fornia at Berkeley. 

Although he has made many 
enemies, van den Bosch maintains 
a reputation for fierce honesty. If 
one believes his account of the 
various meetings and incidents that 
make up the bulk of this book — 
and I do — then one must indulge 
in complicated semantics to char- 
acterize the participants as other 
than he does. Sometimes his at- 
tack seems indiscriminate. But on 
the strength of his firsthand ob- 
servations, it is apparent that an 
agreement exists between agri- 
business and many public officials 
to apply chemicals at undiminished 
levels, whatever the environmental 
costs, while suppressing scientific 
evidence that might lead to alterna- 
tive strategies. 

Van den Bosch lays his founda- 
tion well. The first part of his book 
seems to go over some of the 
ground covered by Rachel Carson, 
being a recital of pesticide-related 
disasters, costs, and potential haz- 
ards. The point is, however, that 
nearly all of these incidents have 
taken place in the years since Silent 
Spring was written, so that its les- 
sons seem to have been absorbed 
only by people who do not use 
pesticides in any case. It is sober- 
ing to learn that in the United States 
today we apply more than twice 
the amount of pesticides that we 
did in 1962, the year of Silent 
Spring&apos;s publication. 

Drawing mainly on his experi- 



Since 1972. when we started our

ence in California, but substantiat- 
ing it with reports gathered from 
elsewhere, van den Bosch demon- 
strates that the excessive use of 
chemicals has not only failed to 
solve agriculture&apos;s pest problems 
but has created a host of new ones; 
insects that were never considered 
significant pests before have sud- 
denly irrupted in uncontrollable 
numbers as chemicals wiped out 
the parasites and predators that 
previously held them in check. 
The result is that growers now lose 
twice as much of their crop as they 
did in pre-DDT days, although they 
use twelve times the amount of 
pesticides, at great cost to them- 
selves and ultimately to consumers. 

Greed is the arch villain here. 
Excessive spraying is built into the 
politics and economics of the cotton 
crop, which is plagued by a wide 
variety of pests. In the past, gov- 
ernment subsidies &quot;hooked&quot; grow- 
ers on the intensive use of chemi- 
cals because subsidies were based 
on average yields — the higher the 
average yield over a number of 
years, the higher the subsidy. 
Growers were thus encouraged to 
apply chemicals, even at dosages 
they knew to be uneconomical, for 
the sake of higher subsidies in the 
long run. 

Van den Bosch, although disap- 
proving of many of the pest control 
practices he saw around him, attrib- 
uted them mostly to ignorance until 
the middle 1960s, when he and 
other entomologists were com- 
missioned to test the Shell Chemi- 
cal Company&apos;s new product Azo- 
drin® against the cotton boUworm. 
For three summers he and his col- 
leagues worked on the project. At 
the end of that time they felt they 
could not recommend its use. 

&quot;At the company&apos;s invitation I 
presented a seminar on our joint 
Azodrin® study to the Shell re- 
search staff,&quot; van den Bosch 
writes. &quot;In this lecture 1 fully dis- 
cussed the material&apos;s shortcomings 
and the reasons why the University 
of California could not recommend 
it. I thought that this took care of 
the matter, but how naive I was: 
Two seasons later approximately 
one million acres of California cot- 
ton were treated with Azodrin®.&quot; 

It was the beginning of his meta- 
morphosis into a gut-fighter. His 
dream of integrated pest control,

fields and drawing up a spraying

schedule only when the levels of in- 
festation demanded it, faded 
quickly. Salesmen, rather than 
scientists, began to prescribe the 
treatment for California&apos;s pest 
problems. Billboards, radio com- 
mercials, and the editorial pages 
of farm magazines (dependent on 
chemical ads for their existence) 
urged growers to spray early and 
often. The alternative, the huck- 
sters promised, was ruin. 

Instead, van den Bosch watched 
a number of growers ruined by 
pests their own gullibility had cre- 



ated and by the resultant spiraling 
chemical costs. Clearer heads tried 
to enact legislation requiring the 
examination and licensing of pest 
control advisers. The chemical 
lobby moved in, however, and sub- 
mitted its own bill under which 
pesticide salesmen become li- 
censed advisers through an ab- 
surdly simple examination.

great state of California. The sales-

achieved respectability that they 
have formed an organization, the 
Council of California Agricultural 
Pest Control Advisers.&quot; 

Van den Bosch recounts a num- 
ber of incidents when he or his 
colleagues were harassed by the 
chemical lobby, politicians, or 
college administrators. In one such 
case, the university put obstacles in 
van den Bosch&apos;s path when he 
tried to fulfill a contract with the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
to study the efficacy of &quot;&quot;cosmetic 
spraying&quot; on fruit. This is a waste- 
ful procedure, designed simply to 
prevent minor blemishes on the 
peel. The chemical lobby, working 
through its friends in the university, 
nearly scuttled the contract. Of the 
confrontation, van den Bosch 
writes: 

&quot;&quot;The contract appears to have 
been an embarrassment to the 
University. I regret this, not be- 
cause it brought me into confronta- 
tion with University administration 
but because it provided a very 
disturbing insight into the way the 
University is entangled in agri- 
politics. On the other hand, it is 
this sort of thing that reinforces 
my determination to battle against 
the cancerous encroachment of 
such politics into my discipline 
and into the workings of the Uni- 
versity of California and similar 
institutions.&quot; 

Because van den Bosch has 
chosen to write subjectively, I 
would like to have read in just a 
little more detail about the passion 
that drove him to study insects in 
the first place and the day-to-day 
process of putting together and 
carrying out an integrated pest 
control program, since insects, 
whatever grief they bring us, are 
fascinating creatures in their own 
right. But, in this book, van den 
Bosch does not have his sights on 
bugs. He is loaded for bigger game, 
and his blunderbuss inevitably 
scores many direct hits.

Bios 



Sex and the Soybean 



To reproduce, the soybean 
must bloom at exactly 
the right time 



The soybean is not innocent of 
sex. Unlike higher animals, which 
carry formed sex organs through- 
out their lives and use them only 
sporadically for reproduction, 
plants make their sex organs, flow- 
ers, only shortly before reproduc- 
ing. Plants form flowers at a time 
during the annual weather cycle 
that will guarantee successful pro- 
duction of progeny. Like other, 
higher plants, the soybean has 
adopted a variety of biological 
mechanisms to insure that its flow- 



ers form at the right time of year. 
For most of its life, the soybean 
vegetates, producing only roots, 
stems, and leaves. Through the 
process of photosynthesis, the 
plant nourishes itself, making car- 
bohydrate from carbon dioxide in 
the air and water in the soil, with 
the aid of sunlight absorbed by 
chlorophyll and other pigments in 
bodies called chloroplasts. Each 
cell of the soybean leaf has be- 
tween fifty and one hundred of 
these active green bodies, and the 
total amount of carbon fixed can 
be prodigious. By cooperating with 
Rhizobiiim, a bacterium present in 
almost all fertile soils, the roots of 
the soybean plant are able to fix 



atmospheric nitrogen gas, convert- 
ing it to ammonia, which then finds 
its way into amino acids and pro- 
teins. This process of nitrogen fix- 
ation occurs in nodules, warty pro- 
tuberances of the root formed after 
Rhizobiiim cells invade root hairs. 
Neither the soybean plant nor the 
bacterium is capable of fixing nitro- 
gen on its own; only the symbiotic 
association of the two in the nodule 
makes this process possible. 

Each active Rhizobiiim contains 
a small circle of deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) in addition to its regular 
circular chromosome; this smaller 
circle, called a plasmid, contains 
the genes for nitrogen fixation (nif). 
as well as other genes controlling

nodule growth. Introduced into 
the soybean root cell when the 
bacteria invade through a root hair, 
the nif genes become active and 
synthesize the enzymes that make 
nitrogen fixation possible. This tidy 
cooperation enables the soybean 
plant to grow independent of nitrog- 
enous fertilizer and even to enrich 
the nitrogen supply of the soil. So 
sensitive is the symbiotic nitrogen 
fixation system that it turns off 
when nitrogenous fertilizer is added 
to the soil, as if the plant switches to 
conserve energy when already fixed 
nitrogen is available. 

With its food assured through 
photosynthesis and its nitrogen 
supplied through direct fixation,

the soybean plant is well on its 
way nutritionally. All it needs is 
water and mineral elements such as 
potassium and phosphate; these 
are usually available in a fertile 
soil or can be easily and inex- 
pensively supplied in fertilizer. 
These properties, together with a 
high bean yield, have made the 
soybean harvest one of America&apos;s 
most bountiful and the soybean one 
of the most profitable export crops. 
Virtually nonexistent in the United 
States in 1940, soybean acreage 
now about equals that of corn. 

But the soybean plant cannot 
complete its life cycle without a 
dramatic change from the vegeta- 
tive habit. The plant is of little use 
as a crop until it produces beans, 
and to make beans it must first 
make flowers. Like all life proc- 
esses, a plant&apos;s transition from the 
vegetative to the sexual habit — 
flowering — is genetically deter- 
mined. Some varieties of soybeans. 



such as Agate or Batorawka, will 
flower when they reach a certain 
age or stage of maturity without re- 
lying on environmental conditions. 
Others, such as Peking or Biloxi, 
require short days before they can 
initiate their sexual stage. Each 
short-day type of soybean has a 
certain critical photoperiod. a 
length of day beyond which it will 
not flower. 

Thus, as the days become pro- 
gressively shorter in the fall, a date 
just below the critical day length 
eventually arrives and the soybean 
flowers. This photoperiodic re- 
quirement insures that the plant 
will be large and vigorous before 
it flowers; presumably, it has 
grown and vegetated from May to 
August, and now has enough leaves, 
root nodules, and other vegetative 
organs to support a large crop of 
fruit. The date of the photoperiod 
also guarantees that flowering and 
fruit-set will be complete before 



134 




Rare in 1940, soybeans now occupy nearly as much acreage as corn 



jjl.the first frost. There are soybean 
varieties with photoperiods to suit 
a wide diversity of agricultural 
regions. 

The photoperiodic control of 
flowering was discovered in the 
United States in 1920, but despite 
more than half a century of in- 
tensive research all over the world, 
the intimate biochemical details of 
the process are still not understood. 
Since the late 1930s, scientists have 
known that the soybean uses the 

^dark rather than the light period of 
the day to measure its photoperiod. 
Thus, if the critical photoperiod 
turns out to be fourteen hours, the 
true control is ten hours of unbro- 
ken darkness. The critical dark 
period is effective whether it is sur- 
rounded by four or fourteen hours 
of light. To some degree, dark-time 
measurement is controlled by the 
state of phytochrome, a pigment 
discovered in 1959 that governs the 
plant&apos;s response to light. When

Night length generally controls flowti^ 



exposed to sunlight, this pigment 
becomes active; when stored in 
darkness, it decays back down to its 
original, or ground level, state. 
Another component of photo- 
periodic timing, besides the 
hourglass scheme of phytochrome 
activation and decay, is the still- 
unknown generator of biological 
rhythms. 

Although the buds of the plant 
change suddenly from producing 
leaves to forming flowers, the vege- 
tative leaves of the plant, rather 
than the buds, perceive the photo- 
periodic stimulus. A short-day 
Biloxi soybean that has been kept 
vegetative by exposure to long days 
can be made to flower by the simple 
trick of tying a black bag over the 
leaves for enough hours to add up 
to an uninterrupted long night of at 
least the critical length. Even if all 



Jl 




the plant&apos;s leaves except one are 
trimmed off, exposure of the re- 
maining single leaf to the right 
photoperiod will result in prompt 
conversion of the distant bud to the 
flowering habit. This experiment 
indicates that some substance 
formed in the leaf moves to the bud 
and influences its behavior. This 
substance, the hypothetical repro- 
ductive, or sex, hormone of plants, 
has been given the name florigen, a 
hybrid term formed by combining 
the Latin word for &quot;flower&quot; with 
the Greek term for &quot;giving rise to.&quot; 
Simple grafting experiments con- 
firm the existence of florigen. If a 
flowering plant of Biloxi soybean 
is grafted onto a vegetative plant 
that has been maintained on long 
day, then both the receptor and the 
donor will develop numerous 
flower buds. For this experiment

to succeed, there must be a true 
union of tissue between donor and 
receptor, implying that florigen can 
move only through living cells. By 
varying the duration of living-cell 
contact between donor and re- 
ceptor, the experimenter can cal- 
culate that the floral stimulus 
moves from leaf to bud through the 
stem at a rate of one to several 
centimeters per hour, or approxi- 
mately the rate at which sugar 
moves through the phloem tissue of 
the plant&apos;s conducting system. If 
the experiment is done well, then 
a flowering short-day plant can in- 
duce a vegetative long-day plant to 
flower, and vice versa. Florigen 
appears to be common to all types 
of flowering plants. 

The graft transmission of florigen 
is most dramatically displayed

when only a single induced leaf is 
grafted from a donor to a receptor 
plant, the union forming along the 
diagonally bisected leafstalk, or 
petiole. This single donor leaf can 
be effective even if only a small 
fraction of its leaf blade area re- 
mains. The floral hormone must be 
a very eflFective compound, since 
only very tiny quantities of ma- 
terial could move from the small 
donor leaf tab through the plant to 
the distant bud. 

The sensitivity of the leaf sys- 
tem regulating florigen synthesis is 
shown by the fact that only a 
momentary flash of light during the 
long dark period is enough to com- 
pletely interrupt the flowering 
process. This tiny amount of light 
energy, perceived by phytochrome, 
is not enough to grossly transform 
many molecules through direct 
photochemical effects. Hence, a 
very little of some effective sub- 
stance must be affected. Even the 
intensity of bright moonlight may 
alter the flowering response, which 
gives some support to old theories 
of planting by the light of the full 
moon. At the next lunar cycle, a 
long-day plant would be made to 



flower as a result of the extra bright 
moonlight, while the flowering of a 
short-day plant would be prevented 
or partially inhibited. 

One curious bit of quantitative 
hocus-pocus is especially baffling. 
Although a few minutes difference 
in day length — actually night length 
— can make a complete difl&apos;erence 
in flowering behavior, one single 
photoinductive day length is not 
enough to cause flowering in soy- 
beans, even though it is enough in 
some other plants. For floral initia- 
tion, soybeans require a minimum 
of four successive short days. If 
two short days are followed by one 
long day and then two more short 
days, the arithmetic is incorrect for 
the soybean; four correct short 
days must follow without interrup- 
tion. Perhaps each successive cor- 
rect photoperiod leads to the syn- 
thesis of a little bit of florigen that 
is still not enough to cause the 
plant to change over to the sexual 
habit; only four correct photope- 
riods allow the buildup of the re- 
quired amount of florigen. Perhaps 
florigen is somewhat unstable, de- 
caying rapidly under unfavorable 
photoperiodic conditions. If so, 



then even if three successive photo- 
periods generated almost enough 
florigen to initiate flowering, this 
quantity would all disappear after 
only one unfavorable photoperiod, 
and the plant would have to start 
all over again to receive its four 
day lengths in a row. Once the 
critical level of florigen is attained, 
however, the florigen-producing 
reaction is self-sustaining. 

The physiological evidence for 
the existence of florigen is so sound 
that presumably it could be isolated 
from masses of properly induced 
leaves, those exposed to the cor- 
rect photoperiod. But despite 
many attempts by able investigators 
over the past forty years, no un- 
ambiguous success has been 
achieved. In the interim, numerous 
other plant hormones regulating 
growth — including auxins, gibber- 
ellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, 
and ethylene — have been isolated 
and characterized. Why the special 
difficulty with florigen? There are 
several possible answers: florigen 
may be difficult to extract, un- 
stable once extracted, or difficult 
to reintroduce properly. Again, 
florigen may not be a single sub-

How small should 
a compact be? 



At 11 ounces and 3 inches high, 
Custom Compact binoculars by 
Bushnell give you more resolution and 
light gathering per ounce than other 
compacts at any 
price! Resolution is 
that critical capability 
of defining the sharp 
detail you require for 
bird identification, 
and light gathering 
determines your 
ability to see that 
detail clearly under 
varying light 
conditions. 

Used by the astro- 
nauts in space flights. 
Bushnell&apos;s Custom Compacts achieve 
this high ratio of performance-to-weight 
and size through an electronically 
computed, camera quality optical 




system combined with precision 
tolerances and rugged construction. 
They are available in 6x25 or 7x26, and 
feature close focus down to 12 feet, 

long eye relief for full 
field with eyeglasses, 
and U.V filters for 
glare control. 

At 11 ounces and 
3 inches high. 
Custom Compact 
binoculars by 
Bushnell are not the 
smallest compacts 
available. But we feel 
they&apos;re precisely as 
small as a compact 
binocular should be.

stance, like the other hormones, 
but a mixture of substances that 
are separated from each other in 
the leaf extract during the purifica- 
tion procedure. Florigen transport 
does seem to follow sugar-transport 
patterns in the plant, and the neg- 
ative effects of noninduced leaves 
(not given a photoperiod that leads 
to flowering) are manifest only if 
they are located between the flori- 
gen-producing leaves and the bud 
to be influenced. Therefore su- 
crose, the major transport sugar of 
plants, could have an influence on 
flowering habit. In some plants 
that have remained vegetative be- 
cause of incorrect photoperiod, 
simple defoliation can cause flow- 
ers to appear. The leaves may have 
inhibited flowering because their 
export of sucrose to the bud blocked 
the transport of florigen to an in- 
duced leaf. 

The hunt for florigenically active 
chemicals proceeds in many labora- 
tories, partly because of the po- 
tential practical importance of such 
substances. At present, pineapples 
can be chemically induced to 
flower by ethylene or ethylene- 
generating systems. Similarly, 
gibberellins can induce some long- 
day plants to flower. In tissue cul- 
ture experiments, sucrose is some- 
times an important factor in the 
appearance of flower buds. But 
the true nature of elusive, trans- 
missible, universally active florigen 
remains mysterious.

JL/ isten to what a noted professional astronomer recently said about the value of amateur astronomy: 
&quot;Today&apos;s amateur astronomer, while engaging in a truly fulfilling endeavor, stands on the threshold of the 
final frontier of discovery — the Universe itself — and thereby participates in one of the few areas where 
non-professionals can make a lasting and vital contribution to the field of science.&quot; 



you&apos;ve ever stood 
in awe beneath a 
star-filled sky and wondered about the why 
of it all, thrilled to the stark drama of a 
solar eclipse, or been held spellbound by a 
dazzling meteor display, you are not alone. 
If you&apos;ve ever wanted to know more about 
the workings of our vast Universe and the 
new insights and discoveries that are con- 
stantly changing our perspective of the 
heavens, then STAR&amp;SKY is the maga- 
zine for you. 

In the pages ot STAR&lt;&amp;SKY you will 
learn, not only about the latest research 
taking place at the world&apos;s largest observa- 
tories, but how a worldwide network of 
amateur astronomers contributes to our 
knowledge of the Universe: Did you know 



that the majority of new comets each year 
are discovered by and named for amateur 
astronomers? That amateurs do much of 
the important legwork in solar, meteor, 
and variable star observation? That ama- 
teurs have long been in the forefront of 
telescope design innovations? Or that many 
of today&apos;s amateurs are making stunning 
photographs of deep-sky objects that rival 
those of the most sophisticated obser- 
vatories? 

In each issue of STAR&amp;SKY we&apos;ll 
bring you thought-provoking articles by 
distinguished astronomers and astronomy 
journalists. Full-color photographs of 
planets, nebulae, galaxies, and other 
wonders of deep space. And news of fast- 
breaking astronomical discoveries. 

We&apos;ll provide you with easy-to-read 



maps and timetables to help you follow 
the ever changing spectacle of the night- 
time sky. Offer tips on the best telescope 
buys. Even show you how to build your

Deep in the Heart 
ofthe Milky Way 



New discoveries are being 
made about an energetic 
source of radio emissions in 
the region of Sagittarius 

Radio astronomers exploring the 
central region of our Milky Way 
galaxy have discovered an unusual 
source of radio waves. Because of 
the thick dust clouds that lie be- 
tween the earth and the galactic 
center, the source cannot be seen 
or photographed in visible light. 
Hence the theories that have been 
proposed to explain the source are 
speculative at best. 

The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, 
a vast, pinwheel-shaped system of 
several hundred billion stars, which 
also includes nebulae, star clus- 



ters, and interstellar gas and dust. 
The earth is situated in one of the 
arms of the pinwheel. at a distance 
of about 33,000 light-years from the 
center. If we were situated high 
&quot;above&quot; the pinwheel, we would 
be able to look down at its center 
with an unobstructed view. Since 
that is not possible, most of what 
we have learned until now about 
the central regions of galaxies has 
come from looking away from our 
own pinwheel toward other galaxies 
located millions of light-years 
away. 

Optical telescopes and radiotele- 
scopes have shown that in many 
cases these galaxies have a bright 
point at their centers, where stars 
are strongly concentrated and 
where powerful radio emissions are

generated. Such tiny, energetic re- 
gions are icnown as galactic nuclei. 
Not all galaxies have them, and it is 
not clear whether the unusual radio 
source at the center of the Milky 
Way is a related object. 

For many years astronomers 
have known that the center of the 
Milky Way is in the direction of the 
constellation Sagittarius. Early ra- 
diotelescope studies showed, more 
specifically, that the center lies in 
the direction of a fairly large radio 
source known as Sagittarius A. 
When improved equipment allowed 
radio observers to map Sagittarius 
A in greater detail, the radio source 
was found to consist of several 
smaller sources that are not neces- 
sarily related to each other. The 
location of the center was narrowed 
down to a small region of radio 
emission within Sagittarius A that is 
known as Sagittarius A West, or 
&quot;Sgr A West&quot; for short. Since 
1974, marked progress in the study 
of this region has been made 
through the application of several 
variations of an experimental tech- 
nique known as radio interferom- 
etry. ■ 

Put simply, radio interferometry 
consists of observations made with 



The small radio source at the 
nucleus of the Milky Way is 
the red spot on the right side 
of this computer-produced 
diagram. The yellow spots 
around the source are ionized 
hydrogen nebulae. The blue 
spot and the diagonal bands 
are secondary recordings of 
instrumental origin. The 
colors correspond to 
different intensities of radio 
waves. The diagram is based 
on measurements made with 
the giant new interferometer 
near Socorro, New Mexico.

two or more radiotelescopes that 
are pointed simultaneously at the 
same spot in the sky. The signals 
received by the individual tele- 
scopes are electronically combined 
to produce the desired measure- 
ments. The primary purpose of ra- 
dio interferometry is to reveal finer 
details than those discernible with a 
single radiotelescope. 

Interferometry, in effect, pro- 
vides a &quot;higher resolution,&quot; or 
sharper &quot;view,&quot; of celestial radio 
sources than otherwise possible. 
For observations at a given radio 
wavelength, the larger the radio- 
telescope, the higher the resolution. 
However, even the world&apos;s largest 
single-dish radiotelescope, the 
1,000-foot &quot;Big Ear&quot; at Arecibo, 
Puerto Rico, provides only very 
coarse resolution as compared with 
the fine celestial details that can be 
photographed with very small vis- 
ible-light telescopes, such as those 
sometimes advertised in the pages 
of this magazine.

two ordinary, 85-foot-diameter, 
dish-shaped radiotelescopes lo- 
cated five miles apart, for example, 
will provide twenty-six times higher 
resolution than Arecibo&apos; s Big Ear. 
In fact, such an interferometer 
achieves a resolution equal to that

eter. In other respects, the inter- 
ferometer is no match for a five- 
mile-diameter dish, but that kind of 
dish is beyond present technology

due to the expert leadership but be- 
cause they combine a trek on foot in 
the Annapurna region with a trek on 
elephant back through the Terai 
jungle, and a canoe trip on the Rapti 
River. Between the treks, first class 
hotel accommodations are provided; 
and the expedition ends with five 
days in Northern India, visiting Delhi, 
Agra and Jaipur.

radiotelescope at Westford, Mas- 
sachusetts, with one at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory&apos;s tracking 
station in Goldstone, California, or 
even antennas on opposite sides of 
the earth, as when the United 
States and the Soviet Union use 
their respective radiotelescopes on 
a common study. 

The existence of a tiny radio 
source at the center of the Milky 
Way was discovered in February 
1974, when astronomers Bruce 
Balick, of the University of Cali- 
fornia, Santa Cruz, and Robert L. 
Brown, of the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory in Green 
Bank, West Virginia, used a new 
radio interferometer to observe Sgr 
A West. The small source they 
found within Sgr A West had a di- 
ameter of less than 1 ,000 astronom- 
ical units. 

One astronomical unit (AU) 
equals the average distance from the 
earth to the sun — about 93 million 
miles. A size of 1,000 AU may 
thus sound large, but in fact it is 
small by the usual standards of the 
radio astronomer. Distant radio 
sources are frequently measured 
in light-year units, that is, the 
distance that light travels through 
space in a period of one year — 
about 5.8 trillion miles. The size of 
the galactic nucleus source, as the 
Balick-Brown radio source has 
come to be called, is less than the 
distance light travels in one week. 
Their measurements indicated, 
furthermore, that a more powerful 
interferometer was required in 
order to see just how small the 
source really is. 

In May 1975, a more powerful 
technique, known as VLBI (Very 
Long Baseline Interferometry) was 
applied to the galactic nucleus 
source by four observers from Cal- 
Tech, led by K.Y. Lo. In the VLBI 
technique, observations are made 
with radiotelescopes so far apart 
that a radio link may not perform 
satisfactorily. The signals received 
by each antenna are therefore re- 
corded on magnetic tape at the 
antenna site, along with precise 
information on the time at which 
the signals are received. After the 
observations are completed, the 
data on the tapes are combined in 
an electronic computer, and the 
timing data are used to insure that 
signals recorded simultaneously 
are properly combined.

antennas, one of 130-foot diameter 
at the Owens Valley Radio Observ- 
atory near Mount Whitney and 
another of 210-foot diameter lo- 
cated about 150 miles away at the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory&apos;s Gold- 
stone tracking station. With these 
antennas, the observers found that 
the nucleus source was at least five 
times smaller than the size esti- 
mated by Balick and Brown. Spe- 
cifically, they discovered that the 
source&apos;s diameter is no more than 
200 AU, or only about two and 
one-half times the diameter of 
Pluto&apos;s orbit around the sun. 

A real breakthrough in under- 
standing the galactic nucleus source 
came in 1976, when three radio 
astronomers from the University of 
Manchester reported an elaborate 
study made at three radio wave- 
lengths with three different inter- 
ferometers. The Manchester team 
discovered that the diameter of the 
nucleus radio source seems to 
depend on the wavelength at which 
it is observed. They found further 
that the measured diameters follow 
a so-called wavelength squared law, 
meaning that if the diameter is 
measured first at one wavelength 



and then at another that is, say, 
two times longer, the second di- 
ameter will be four times as large 
as the first one. If a measurement 
is then made at a third wavelength 
that is three times as long as the 
first one, the observed diameter 
will be nine times as great. 

The Manchester astronomers 
pointed out that when radio waves 
travel through an ionized region — 
a part of space filled by gas that 
is electrified and heated by the 
action of ultraviolet light from hot 
stars — they are disturbed by the 
presence of turbulent clumps and 
irregularities in the distribution of 
the ionized matter. The net eflFect 
is to smear out the waves, so that 
a small radio source will appear 
larger than its true size as perceived 
by a distant observer. 

This process, called interstellar 
scattering, is analogous to the 
smearing effect of turbulent air in 
the earth&apos;s atmosphere on the 
passage of light waves from the 
stars. When examined at high mag- 
nification in a large telescope, the 
images of stars are found to be 
blurred by this effect, so that they 
resemble patches of light instead of 



tiny points. Thus, the Manchester 
team concluded that the true size of 
the galactic nucleus source was 
smaller than indicated by previous 
observations. In particular, they 
estimated the true size of the source 
was about 100 AU. or half as large 
as the value suggested by the 
CalTech group in 1975. 

The Manchester team was cor- 
rect in concluding that the galactic 
nucleus source was smaller than 
indicated by the available observa- 
tions, but their estimate of 100 AU 
was still too large. 

The next major study, by four 
scientists at the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory, showed 
that the source contained a bright 
central core with a diameter of 
only 10 AU, about equal to the 
diameter of Jupiter&apos;s orbit around 
the sun. Using a transcontinental 
interferometry system, the NRAO 
observers found that the galactic 
nucleus source consists of the 
bright core of 10 AU in size, sur- 
rounded by a radio wave &quot;halo&quot; 
of about 100-200 AU. 

According to a later interpreta- 
tion of the transcontinental inter- 
ferometry results, the core and halo

of the radio source can be com- 
pared to the appearance of the full 
moon when observed through a 
layer of thin clouds. The moon is 
then seen as a bright object sur- 
rounded by a fainter, but much 
larger, halo caused by the action of 
ice crystals and water drops in the 
clouds scattering, or reflecting, the 
moonlight. Thus, the core of the 
observed radio source is the true 
source and its observed size cor- 
responds to the intrinsic size of the 
object, while the halo consists of 
radio waves that have been scat- 
tered by the intervening ionized 
gas. 

The Manchester scientists as- 
sumed that the observed interstellar 
broadening was produced by ion- 
ized regions located along the line 
of sight between the earth and the 
galactic nucleus. A recent analysis 
of available observations at all 
wavelengths, however, shows that 
the zone in which the broadening 
occurs must actually lie at the far 
end of the line of sight from the 
earth, close to the nucleus. This 
analysis by Donald C. Backer of 
the University of California, Berke- 
ley, a world authority on inter- 



stellar scattering, shows that the 
region where the radio waves are 
scattered must be within about 300 
light-years of the nucleus and must 
consist of turbulent clumps of ion- 
ized gas with an average size of not 
much more than a half mile. 

The latest findings on the galactic 
nucleus source appear to confirm 
Backer&apos;s analysis and to place the 
region of broadening precisely at 
the end of the line of sight to the 
nucleus. The findings, which were 
reported this year by Brown and 
Lo, together with Kenneth Johns- 
ton of the Naval Research Labo- 
ratory in Washington, D.C., are 
based on measurements made with 
a giant interferometer still under 
construction on the Plains of San 
Agustin, west of Socorro, New 
Mexico, but already in partial 
operation. According to these re- 
sults, the radio source is actually 
immersed in a dense zone of ion- 
ized gas, with properties consistent 
with those deduced by Backer as 
necessary to produce the observed 
broadening. Thus the broadening 
occurs in the immediate surround- 
ings of, or even coextensively with, 
the galactic nucleus source itself. 



The broadening of the galactic 
nucleus source as observed with 
radio interferometers from Earth 
has now been explained. But the 
nature of the source itself remains 
in doubt. It differs in certain 
marked ways from the nuclei of 
other galaxies that also show 
intense radio emissions. In partic- 
ular, the total radio energy from 
the nucleus of the Milky Way is 
much less than that produced in 
nuclear sources of other galaxies, 
but the amount of energy produced 
per unit volume of space is actually 
higher. Speculation that the source 
is a young supernova, a pulsar, 
a giant black hole, or an unusual 
binary star remains unconfirmed. 
Fortunately, since the nuclear 
source was discovered less than 
five years ago, many avenues of 
investigation remain open and 
surely further study will unlock at 
least some of the secrets at the 
heart of the Milky Way.

Celestial Events 

by Thomas D. Nicholson 



Sun and Moon The sun is barely past the autumnal equinox at the 
beginning of October, in the part of the ecliptic (its apparent path on 
the sky) where it is moving southward most rapidly. It will be in the 
constellation Virgo for the whole month, moving into Libra at the 
beginning of November. In Virgo, the sun moves steadily south until, 
by the end of the month, it is more than halfway from the equatorial 
plane to its most southerly position. The effect will be clearly 
noticeable in the shortening periods of daylight. 

An evening moon appears in the first week of October and again 
in November, getting larger and brighter and remaining visible later 
each night until full moon about midmonth. In the last half of October 
and November, the moon wanes, rising later at night and setting 
later during daylight. In October, new moon is on the 2nd, first- 
quarter on the 9th, full moon on the 16th, and last-quarter on the 
23rd. Another new moon occurs on October 31, and in November 
the first-quarter moon is on the 7th, full on the 14th. 

Stars and Planets Although Venus is at greatest brilliancy early in 
October, it is not well placed as an evening star. Mars and Mercury, 
also evening planets, are too low to be seen. The best planets this 
fall are Jupiter and Saturn, both morning stars. Jupiter rises about 
midnight, a very bright object between the Gemini (the twin stars 
Pollux and Castor), which rise earlier, and Regulus (in Leo), which 
rises later. Toward morning, Saturn will also enter the sky, rising 
after Regulus, and appearing well up in the southeast at dawn. 

October 3: Venus reaches greatest brilliancy as an evening star. It 
has been brightening as it approaches the earth before moving in 
between the earth and the sun. But it is also turning its sunlit face 
away from the earth, causing it to become dimmer in the weeks 
ahead as it approaches the end of its cycle as an evening star. 

October 4: If the western sky is clear after sundown, look for 
Venus below and to the right of the crescent moon. 

October 16: The full moon this month is known as the hunter&apos;s 
moon. Its position and path cause bright moonlight to be available 
during the early evening for several nights in succession. 

October 17: Venus becomes stationary relative to the stars and 
begins to move westward as it passes between the earth and the sun. 

October 21: The Orionid meteor shower reaches maximum. Al- 
though not very productive (up to 25 per hour at maximum), its 
meteors are often swift and bright. 

October 24-25: Jupiter is the bright object near the waning moon 
from midnight until dawn. 

October 27: Saturn is the object near the crescent moon in the east 
at dawn this morning. Jupiter is higher and brighter and to the right. 

November 4: The Taurid meteors reach maximum, but they are 
sparse, brief, and dim. 

November 7: Venus, at inferior conjunction, becomes a morning 

star. 

November 15: The moon covers the bright star Aldebaran begin- 
ning at about 10:00 p.m. and ending about 11:30 p.m., EST (times 
vary with location). The event will be visible throughout North 
America, but binoculars will be necessary to see Aldebaran when it 
is near the edge of the bright full moon. 

• Hold the Star Map so the compass direction you face is at the bottom, 
then match the stars in the lower half of the map with those in the sky near 
the horizon. The map is for 11; 15 p.m. on October 1: 10;20 p.m. on October 
15; 9:15 p.m. on October 30: and 8:20 p.m. on November 15; but it can also 
be used for an hour before and after those times.

Prairie Dogs (p. 56) 

In Must They Die: The Strange 
Case of the Prairie Dog and the 
Black-Footed Ferret (Garden City: 
Doubleday and Co., 1971), Faith 
McNulty vividly describes the hor- 
rors and politics of the gov- 
ernment-enforced program of pred- 
ator and rodent control, which has 
further reduced in number the nearly 
extinct black-footed ferret. Two 
books by David F. Costello cover 
the characteristics, behavior, and 
ecological role of the prairie dog: 
The World of the Prairie Dog 
(Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott Co., 
1970) and The Prairie World (New 
York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co., 
1969). A classic scientific study by 
John A. King, &quot;Social Behavior, 
Social Organization and Population 
Dynamics in a Black-tailed Prairie- 
dog Town in the Black Hills of 
South Dakota,&quot; can be found in 
Contributions from the Laboratory 
ofVertebrate Biology of the Univer- 
sity of Michigan (no. 67, April 1975, 
pp. 1-123). Carl B. Koford&apos;s 
&quot;Prairie Dogs, Whitefaces and Blue 
Grama,&quot; another scientific account, 
was published by the Wildlife Soci-

To study the subject in greater 



depth, see Sacha Runa: Ethnicity 
and Adaptation of Ecuadorian 
Jungle Quichua (Urbana: University 
of Illinois Press, 1976), written by 
Norman E. Whitten, Jr., with the 
assistance of Marcelo F. Naranjo, 
Marcelo Santi Simbafia, and 
Dorothea S. Whitten. The Upper 
Amazon, by Donald W. Lathrap 
(New York: Praeger Publishers, 
1970), studies people of the Upper 
Amazon Basin, emphasizing their 
migrations and cultural develop-

has a bibliography. Ethnographic 
data in The Jivaro: People of the 
Sacred Waterfalls (Garden City: 
Doubleday /Natural History Press, 
1972) were gathered in the field by 
the author, Michael J. Harner. His 
book is a broad introduction to the 
culture of a people who in the years 
1956-57 did not yet have regular 
contact with whites. Other books, 
which may be somewhat hard to 
find, are Sarayacu Quichua Pot- 
tery, by Patricia Kelley and Carolyn 
Orr (Dallas: Summer Institute of

Owl Hunt (p. 100) 

The Magic of Owls, by Jozefa 
Stuart (New York: Walker and 
Co., 1977), is a beautifully illus- 
trated paperback of owl art through 
the ages. It includes French cave art 
from 35,000 years ago; owls from 
the Chou Dynasty of China, 3,000 
years ago; Egyptian pieces; Eskimo 



carvings; and much more. Brian 
Stone&apos;s translation of The Owl and 
the Nightingale, the twelfth- 
century Old English poem quoted in 
&quot;An Owl Hunt,&quot; was published as a 
paperback by Penguin Publishing 
Company in 1972. The Bestiary: A 
Book of Beasts, by Terence H. 
White (New York: G. P. Putman&apos;s 
Sons, 1960), is an illustrated transla- 
tion, with commentary, of a 
twelfth-century bestiary. An enter- 
taining and informative book, 
Birds, Beasts, and Men: A 
Humanist History of Zoology, by H. 
R. Hays (Baltimore: Penguin Books 
Inc., 1973), has a section on the 
Middle Ages and a bibliography. 
Tony Angell&apos;s Owls (Seattle: Uni- 
versity of Washington Press, 1974) is 
a large, colorful natural history. Its 
biology is sound and it too has a 
bibliography. Another illustrated 
book. Owls: Their Natural and Un- 
natural History, by John Sparks and 
Tony Soper (New York: Taplinger 
Publishing Co., 1970), devotes a 
chapter to owl lore. 

Ice Age Art (p. 108) 

The Abbe Henri Breuil was one of 
the most distinguished scholars of 
Upper Paleolithic art. His Four 
Hundred Centuries of Cave Art 
(Montignac: Centre d&apos;Etudes et 
de Documentation Prehistoriques, 
1952) is recommended to anyone 
interested in the subject. Alexander 
Marshack, a leading authority on 
the Upper Paleolithic period, was a 
scientific consultant for the Ameri- 
can Museum of Natural History&apos;s 
lee Age Art exhibit, which will run 
through mid-January 1979. His The 
Roots of Civilization: The Cog- 
nitive Beginnings of Man&apos;s First

Art, Symbol and Notation (New 
York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., 
1972) analyzes engravings, mobil- 
iers and other carvings, and cave 
paintings. This large book has an 
annotated bibliography. Palaeo- 
lithic Cave Art, by Peter J. Ucko 
and Andree Rosenfeld (New York: 
McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1967), is 
an illustrated critique of some of 
the theories of the origin of cave 
art. Magln Berenguer gives a per- 
sonal account of one discovery of 
cave paintings and discusses the 
controversies concerning the au- 
thenticity of Altamira in Prehistoric 
Man and His Art: The Caves of 
Ribade sella (Park Ridge: Noyes 
Press, 1975). The Threshold of 
Civilization, by Walter A. Fair-

Scribner&apos;s Sons, 1975), is an il- 
lustrated interpretation of Ice Age 
artifacts found in Tbrkey, Czecho- 
slovakia, and the French Riviera. 
In this book, which includes draw- 
ings, diagrams, and a bibliography, 
Fairservis offers an analysis of the 
evolutionary development of hu- 
man cultures into civilizations.

Errata: The August-September 
1978 issue contains two inaccurate 
captions. The plant in the lower 
right-hand corner on page 66 of 
&quot;The Decline of Lake Plants&quot; is an 
arrow arum, not an arrowhead. In 
&quot;The Salmon May Make It,&quot; the 
fish under attack by the lamprey on 
page 85 is a rainbow, not a lake, 
trout. 



Fermentation: The miracle that turns 
the juice of the grape into wine. 




Although it is an oft-proclaimed truth 
that fine wine is a living, growing 
thing, nowhere is this more evident 
than during that critical, and still 
somewhat mysterious, process 
called fermentation. 

Yeast: The Catalyst 

It is possible that a quantity of fine 
grapes crushed and left to them- 
selves in an open container will, in 
time, ferment and yield an accept- 
able wine. 

It is probable, however, that these 
same grapes will yield a wine not so 
pleasant. 

Which it will become depends in 
large measure on the vagaries of 
simple, one-celled plants called 
yeasts which are found naturally in 
the bloom on the skins of grapes. 

A Louis Pasteur Discovery 
Until 1864, wine-making was a mat- 
ter of uncertainty. But then Louis 
Pasteur discovered that these yeasts 
were, indeed, the agents that caused 
fermentation. 

Equally important, he discovered 
that specific strains with desirable 
characteristics could be isolated and 
substituted for the wild yeast in the 
wine-making process, a major step 
toward predictable excellence. 

Today, our winemakers are de- 
voted to the study of yeasts and to 
their improvement. Because no one 
yeast works equally well in every 
case, we are constantly striving to 
isolate the ideal yeast for the differ- 
ent varieties of wines. 

This development of the specific 
yeast which maximizes a grape&apos;s 
natural flavor potential is a primary 
study we have pursued for years. 

To achieve a wine of predictable 
excellence year after year, we devel- 
oped the first successful dehydration 
of pure wine yeast. The dehydrated 
form maintains the consistent purity 
from year to year and provides us 
with a &quot;cleaner&quot; wine that is truer in 
flavor and fragrance to the grape. 



Some Like It Cold 

During fermentation, heat is created. 
If we permit the fermenting juice or 
&quot;must&quot; to attain a temperature of 
only ninety degrees, the yeast can be 
injured. At one-hundred degrees, 
most yeast will die. 

Over the years, we have devel- 
oped precise cooling methods for 
keeping the fermenting liquid at the 
optimum lower temperature. This 
varies from grape to grape. For 
example, the Sauvignon Blanc, 
French Colombard, Chenin Blanc, 
Riesling or Chardonnay we use for 
our white wines are far more delicate 
and sensitive to temperature than 
their more robust red cousins. 

We determined that fermenting 
them at a cooler temperature slows 
the change from juice to wine and 
results in protecting the delicacy of 
the resultant wine. 

In this cooled state, the juice can 
ferment as long as fourteen days 
rather than three or four. 

The Test Fermentation 

Knowing the precise moment to 
draw the wine is a combination of 
the skill and art of our winemakers. 
In some cases we actually take 
grape samples a few days before 
harvest and, on a small scale, pro- 
ceed with fermentation. This gives 
us a preview of what to expect, and, 
we then make whatever adjustments 
necessary to produce the most con- 
sistently excellent wine. 

Our Purpose 

The precise control of fermentation 
is but one of the many steps which 
our winemakers have mastered in 
order to achieve our goal. Here at 
the winery of Ernest and Julio Gallo, 
our purpose is to bring you the finest 
wine that skill and care can produce.

At the Museum 



Visitors who came to see anthro- 
pological films at the Margaret 
Mead Film Festival in early Sep- 
tember left with some idea of the 
Museum&apos;s connection with New 
Guinea. The 1978 festival included 
Mead&apos;s and Gregory Batcson&apos;sBath- 
ing Babies in Three Cultures, in 
which one bathing sequence takes 
place in New Guinea&apos;s Sepik River. 
Another festival offering, Jean 
Rouch&apos;s film portrait of Margaret 
Mead, shows Mead walking 
through the Hall of the Peoples of 
the Pacific, which is currently being 
moved and reinstalled under her 
direction. She conceived the idea of 
the hall in 1928 and began working 
seriously on the project in 1946. The 
hall, devoted to the peoples of In- 
donesia, the Philippines, Australia, 
Melanesia, Polynesia, and Micro- 
nesia, first opened in 1971 and held 
a fraction of the Museum&apos;s Oceanic 
collection. 

Ornithologists, mammologists, 
and herpetologists from the Mu- 
seum have made expeditions to 
New Guinea, and Mead herself has 
worked with three tribes — the 
Manus. the Mountain Arapesh, and 
the Mundugumur. &quot;In December 
1931,&quot; she recalls in her autobiog- 
raphy. Blackberry Winter, &quot;we 
came to Arapesh and began the 
fieldwork that was to give me a 
completely new insight into the 
nature of sex roles in culture and 
into the ways in which innate dif- 
ferences of temperament and cul- 
ture are related.&quot; 

The fruits of Mead&apos;s labors on 
the Hall of the Peoples of the Pa- 
cific cannot be appreciated before 
1980, when the hall will reopen. 
Meanwhile, in Gallery 77 on the 
Museum&apos;s first floor, Papua New 
Guinea: Then and Now, a special 
exhibit on view through mid- 
October, describes one part of the 
South Seas. 

This exhibit honors the third an- 
niversary of the political independ- 
ence of Papua New Guinea, which 
comprises the eastern half of the 
island of New Guinea, as well as 
six hundred offshore islands in the 



western corner of the South Pacific. 
Papua New Guinea is home to more 
than a thousand tribes, most of 
which still lead rural, village lives. 
According to Paulias Nguna Ma- 
tane. Ambassador to the United 
States and Permanent Representa- 
tive of Papua New Guinea to the 
United Nations, the point of the 
exhibit of artifacts, slides of flora 
and fauna, and tapes of birdsong 
and music is to give Westerners 
some knowledge of Papua New 
Guinea beyond what they remem- 
ber from World War II or South 
Pacific. Matane was pleased to find 
that his home region is already de- 
picted in a diorama in the Museum&apos;s 
Hall of Oceanic Birds. 

Exhibit visitors who want to 
study Papua New Guinea will see 
enormous carved wooden figures, 
tapa cloth made from bark, musical 
instruments, headdresses, masks, 
jewelry, and craftwork. They can 
stand inside a full-size replica of a 
conical, thatched roundhouse, the 
traditional home of some Papuan 
Highlanders. And they can learn 
about the importance of the sea to 
local tribes by inspecting an out- 
rigger canoe from the Papuan coast 
or a lagatoi. a double-hulled canoe 
with a hand-stitched sail of banana 
leaves. 

Beginning the last week of Sep- 
tember, there will be nine perform- 
ances in the auditorium, free with 
Museum admission, of traditional 
music, drama, and dance from 
Papua New Guinea. The perform- 
ers will be the Raun Raun Theatre 
Company, presenting drama from 
the Highlands; the Mekeo Dancers 
from the coast, who, wearing five- 
foot feather headdresses, dramatize 
folk tales; and the Asaro Mudmen, 
ghostly figures in clay masks, from 
the eastern Highlands. The perform- 
ances in October will take place on 
Sunday, October 1, at 2:00 p.m. and 
Wednesday. October 4, at 7:00 p.m. 

Other Events 

On Sunday, October 8. at 3:00 
p. M . in the auditorium , the Big Drum 



Nation Dance Company will pre- 
sent a program of ritual dance and 
drumming from Carriacou. On fes- 
tive occasions, the people of this 
small Caribbean island may drum, 
dance, and sing until sunrise. Tick- 
ets are $4 for Associate Members 
and the public. Participating, 
Donor, and Life Members may pur- 
chase up to six tickets at the special 
price of two tickets for the price of 
one. For further information, call 
the Membership Office at (212) 
873-1327. 

On Wednesday evening, October 
18, at 7:30 p.m. in the auditorium, 
Howard Topoff of the Museum&apos;s 
Department of Animal Behavior 
will lecture on &quot;Army Ants: Huns 
and Tartars of the Insect World.&quot; 
Topoff, who was the curator in 
charge of the Museum&apos;s 1974 ex- 
hibit of a colony of 500.000 ants, 
will discuss the behavior of these 
insects, beloved of science fiction 
film and story. Admission will be 
free to Participating, Donor, and 
Life Members; $2 for Associate 
Members and the public. 

Last winter, Stephen Jay Gould 

published Ever Since Darwin (New 
York: W. W. Norton and Co.), a 
collection of essays that he has 
written since 1974 for his Natural 
History column, &quot;This View of 
Life.&quot; Gould lectures as felicitously 
as he writes, with a fine sense of 
theater as well as scientific history. 
At Rockefefler University in New 
York, he opened a talk on evolu- 
tionary theory by showing a Stein- 
berg drawing of the tree of evolu- 
tion, topped by the American eagle. 
Gould followed up with a nine- 
teenth-century engraving of the tree 
of life, complete with bark, leaves, 
and branches heavily weighted with 
various species. On November 15, 
at 7:30 p.m., Gould will give an 
equally entertaining and knowl- 
edgeable lecture in the Museum&apos;s 
auditorium. Admission will be free 
to Participating, Donor, and Life 
Members; $2 for Associate Mem- 
bers and the public.

&quot;This is reclaimed land. The coal is out,

&quot;For centuries, the Navajo

Land Reclamation Supervisor. 
&quot;Their whole livelihood depends 
on it, as it has for centuries.

&quot;But this land is some of the best 
coal-producing country in America. 
So the Navajo nation, which 
owns the land, leased part of it to 
Gulf&apos;s subsidiary. The Pittsburg&amp;Midway Coal Mining Co. 

&quot;Now it&apos;s one of P&amp;M&apos;s most 
productive mines. It&apos;s producing

&quot;It&apos;s my job to put things back 
pretty much the way they were be- 
fore mining started. 

&quot;As much as possible, we try to 
restore the character of the land, 
the general contours, and espe- 



cially the drainage patterns. 

&quot;When we&apos;re finished, it&apos;s as 
good grazing land as it ever was — 
sometimes better. 

&quot;It&apos;s a real challenge, getting 
out the coal we need, without 
destroying the land, which we 
need just as much. I&apos;m a Navajo

Capturing 
Wildlife in 
the Porcelain 
Jungle. 



&quot;You can see into the heart of the 
sculptor by watching his hands.&quot; 

As she toured the porcelain jungle, 
Annabel remembered the words of her 
great ancestor, who founded the legendary 
Aynsley China Works in Stoke-on-Trent 
over 200 years ago. 

She kept her eyes on the hands of the 
artist who modelled a noble Aynsley eagle. 
(The Queen of England later carried it to 
Boston to celebrate America&apos;s bicentennial. ) 

She watched the hands of the deep- 
etcher, who made every stroke come ali\&apos;e 



with the firing of the bisque 

She studied the hands of the painter as 
he captured wildlife with color so natural, 
it challenged the senses. 

&quot;How you .all must love God&apos;s crea- 
tures,&quot; said Annabel, who knew so well 
that the sculptor&apos;s hand was a messenger 
of the heart.

Dennis Werner is holding a belt 
rattle of peccary hoofs, made by the 
Mekranoti Indians who live in the 
Amazon forest in central Brazil. Of 
the eight weeks he spent trekking 
with the Mekranoti, he reports, &quot;I 
was a bit disappointed that I had to 
eat garden produce; I had hoped for 
meals of exotic fruits and wild 
roots.&quot; After spending more than a 
year in Brazil, Werner is now a 
doctoral candidate at the Graduate 
Center of the City University of 
New York and an adjunct lecturer at 
Hunter College. Like many of his 
colleagues, he is interested in both 
science and music. In his free time 
he plays the harpsichord. 



Because he is both a herpetologist 
and a physician, Sherman A. Min- 
ton, Jr., probably hears about 
freakish snakebites more than most 
professionals. A virtual subspe- 
cialty of his is snakes that have 
bitten other herpetologists. (He 
sends no information as to whether 
he himself has ever been bitten.) A 
professor of microbiology at the 
Indiana University School of 



Medicine, Minton has been doing 
research on the serological relation- 
ships of snakes, particularly ven- 
omous species; the neutralizing abil- 
ities of antivenins; and the human 
influence on the distribution of am- 
phibians and reptiles. Before as- 
suming his post at Indiana, he was 
professor of microbiology at the 
Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Cen- 
ter in Karachi, Pakistan.

In the course of researching his 
Ph.D. dissertation on a California 
fishing community. Jack Stuster 
found that he did not understand 
any of the radio messages transmit- 
ted by the fishermen. His curiosity 
about the significance of the trans- 
missions led to his article in this 
issue on communication in West 
Coast fishing fleets. An an- 
thropologist with a consulting firm 
in San Francisco, Stuster earned his 
degrees at the University of 
California, Santa Barbara. His in- 
terest in fishing is not limited to 
academic study; he helped organize 
and then managed a cooperative fish 
market in Santa Barbara during the 
time he wrote his dissertation.

For untold centuries, the Indian was 
America&apos;s nobility — sovereign over 
our great land from sea to sea. 
Now, to appropriately fionor this 
unique and remarkable heritage, the 
Museum of the American Indian- 
dedicated to the preservation of all things 
connected with the native peoples of the 
Americas— will present an exceptionally 
comprehensive special exhibition devoted 
to the history and cultures of these peoples. 
On the occasion of this splendid exhibition, 
the Museum announces its first collection of 
original sculpture: &apos;The Noble Americans.&apos; 
The complete collection will consist of 
12 full-figure pewter sculptures, each a 
work of art in its own right, portraying the 
majestic Indian men and women who once 
ruled this land. 

Iroquois. . . Seminole . . . Pawnee ... Sioux .. . 
Blackfoot. . . Mandan . . . Navajo. . . Arapaho. . . 
Hopi. . .Tlingit. . .Chippewa. . .Apache. The 
ringing names of the American Indian tribal 
nations are today well-known all over the 
world. But the images behind the names are 
less familiar And in &apos;The Noble Americans&apos; 
collection, American Indian men and 
women will be revealed to us as real people 
—just as they might have been seen in 
tribal life and ceremonial rituals, long ago. 
Each will be an extraordinary example of 
sculpture in the round, with truly excep- 
tional quality of detail. Indeed, this may 
well be the most significant collection of 
sculpture ever created portraying the 
American Indian in all his native glory. 




Authoritative portrayals based on 
authentic sources 

Each figure will be individually sculptured 
and cast in fine pewter, to the Museum&apos;s 
commission, by the artists and craftsmen of 
The Franklin Mint, renowned for their 
works of art in both fine and precious 
metals. And to assure that each sculptured 
figure is wholly authentic in every detail, 
the Museum has drawn upon its vast col- 
lection of objects connected with the 
anthropology of the American Indian. 

As a result, each figure in the collection 
is as distinctive and individual as were the 
tribes themselves. The delicate feathering 
of the mounted Sioux chief&apos;s bonnet, and 
the individual bone beads of his breast- 
plate. ..the intricate decorative fringe of the 
Arapaho&apos;s deerskin shirt, as he raises his 
arms to evoke the powers of The Great 
Spirit. . .the pliant birch hoop which secures 
the rawhide head of the Chippewa&apos;s drum 
...the lavish artistry of the Tlingit chief&apos;s 
elaborate costume — all appear in sharp and 
distinct outline. And the twelve sculptures 
together form a heroic panorama of our 
land&apos;s first inhabitants — &apos;The Noble 
Americans.&apos; 

These splendid figures— each meticu- 
lously cast and hand-finished — possess to 
the full the intriguing charms of perfectly 
proportioned sculpture. Each figure will be 
approximately 3&apos;- inches in height. Each 
will stand on its own sculptured pewter 
base. And each base will carry the collec- 
tion&apos;s title, the name of the Indian tribal 
nation that sculpture represents, and the 
hallmark of The Franklin Mint. 

The Museum&apos;s experts and scholars will 
supervise the preparation of the informa- 
tion reference folders that will accompany 
these sculptures, describing in detail the 
activity each figure portrays, the historic 
costume and regalia, and the role each 
played in the life and ritual of the tribe. 

To be produced in limited edition, 
solely for subscribers 

&apos;The Noble Americans&apos; collection is avail- 
able only by direct subscription. And there 
is an absolute limit of one collection per 
subscriber. Therefore, the total edition will 
be forever limited to the exact number 
of valid subscription applications post-

20, 1978. 

The sculptures in this historic collection 
will be issued at the rate of one every other 
month, beginning in December 1978. The 
issue price is $70 per sculpture, payable in 




two equal monthly installments of $35. 
Thus, each subscriber will be able to

limited edition sculpture on a convenient 
monthly basis.

Saga of Steller&apos;s Sea Cow 

by Delphine Haley 



The largest sea mammal of 
its kind was last reliably seen 
in 1768. Some sketchy Soviet 
sightings suggest it snrvives 

The Steller&apos;s sea cow is the only 
North Pacific sea mammal to be- 
come extinct in historical times. 
Discovered in the winter of 1741- 
42, when explorer Vitus Bering&apos;s 
crew was shipwrecked on an island 
that would later bear their leader&apos;s 
name, this giant marine herbivore 
was literally devoured into oblivion 
because of its beeflike meat and 
sweet-tasting blubber. For twenty- 
seven years following its discovery, 
the sea cow was a major food source 
for Russian hunters seeking sea 
otter fur across the North Pacific. It 
lived only in the shallow waters off 
Bering and Copper Islands, in the 
Commander Islands some 100 miles 
east of Siberia in the Bering Sea. 
Slow-moving and unsuspicious, it 



grazed on seaweeds until its disap- 
pearance about 1768. 

Georg Wilhelm Steller, the Ber- 
ing expedition&apos;s naturalist and sur- 
geon, was among the first to notice 
the sea cow. It resembled an over- 
turned boat until it moved, when it 
revealed a huge, spindle-shaped 
body as much as twenty-five feet 
long, ending fore and aft with a 
disproportionately small, bristly 
muzzled head and a large, laterally 
lobed tail. We are indebted to Steller 
for the only scientific description of 
the sea cow — one of many species 
that bear his name. 

The Steller&apos;s sea cow, along with 
the dugong and manatee, is a mem- 
ber of the order Sirenia. Although 
superficially resembling the mod- 
ern whales and seals, the sirenians 
are actually descended from a pig- 
sized primitive ungulate, Moeri- 
theriiim, which led a hippolike 
existence in the Upper Eocene 



some fifty million years ago. Oddly 
enough, its modern descendants, 
aside from the aquatically adapted 
sirenians, are the hyrax and the 
elephant. 

Sirenians share a fusiform shape, 
a heavy-boned frame for stability, 
a horizontally flattened tail, a 
tough, wrinkled hide, bristly hairs 
around the lips, and a preference 
for coastal waters and estuaries 
where aquatic vegetation is abun- 
dant. They lack both an external 
ear and a dorsal fin. Two families 
— the manatee (Trichechidae) of the 
tropical Atlantic and Caribbean and 
the dugong (Dugongidae) of the 
Indian Ocean and East African and 
Indo-Malaysian waters — are the 
order&apos;s present representatives. 

The sea cow, a dugongid, was the 
only recent family member to adapt

to the cold waters of the north. To 
accomplish this, it evolved distin- 
guishing traits, which Steller de- 
scribed. The sea cow was by far the 
largest sirenian, up to twenty-five 
feet in length. Its weight is confus- 
ing, for Steller records it at &quot;200 
pud,&quot; or 4.5 tons, and &quot;1,200 pud,&quot; 
or 26.8 tons. (Marine mammalogist 
Victor ScheflFer, using a clay model 
of the sea cow, has calculated its 
weight at 7 tons for a sea cow some 
twenty-five feet long.) Four inches 
of fat — nine in some places — 
provided insulation from the cold, 
and an inch-thick hide furnished 
protection from the abrasions of ice 
and surf-pounded rocky coasts. Its 
hairless, black, elephantlike 
hide — sometimes marked with 
white spots and zones — displayed a 
very rough cuticle, particularly 
around the head, eyes, ears, 
breasts, and under the forelimbs. 
The hide was uneven, full of 
grooves, wrinkles, and funnel- 
shaped lesions, or pits, gnawed out 
by a parasitic amphipod later named 
Cyamus rhytina. Seagulls were 
known to sit on the sea cows&apos; backs 
and feed on these parasites. 

Steller&apos;s descriptions of the sea 
cow and other North Pacific sea 
mammals were published posthu- 
mously in 1751 by the Saint Peters- 
burg Academy of Science under the 
title De Bestiis Marinis. He related 
the creature to the one called mana- 
tee by the Spaniards in America 
and sea cow by the English and 
Dutch. In noting its ungulate char- 
acteristics, he wrote. 

These animals, like cattle, live in herds 
at sea, males and females going to- 
gether and driving the young before 
them about the shore. They are occu- 
pied with nothing else but their food. 
The back and half the body are always 
seen out of the water. They eat in the 
same manner as the land animals, with 
a slow forward movement. They tear 
the seaweed from the rocks with the 
feet and chew it without cessation. . . . 
During the eating they move the head 
and neck like an ox, and after the lapse 
of a few minutes they lift the head out 
of the water and draw fresh air with a 
rasping and snorting sound after the 
manner of horses. 

The sea cow had several unusual 
physical features. Instead of teeth, 
two flat plates — one attached to the 
upper jaw, another to the lower — 
served as chewing organs. (Sub- 
sequent examination of the plates 
identified them as horny, tubercle- 



•&gt;i /.

filled structures.) Indented with 
wavy canals, the chewing plates 
fitted together for efficient mashing 
of seaweed. According to Steller, 
the sea cow&apos;s lips were &quot;double and 
divided into internal and external 
lips,&quot; the protruding exterior upper 
lip being fourteen inches wide and 
fringed with thick bristles. In spite 
of its huge size, the animal&apos;s lidless 
eyes were no larger than those of a 
sheep. Nor was there any trace of an 
external ear; instead, within the 
wrinkles of the skin, there was an 
opening &quot;hardly large enough for 
the insertion of a pea.&quot; The two- 
foot-long forelimbs were used for 
moving about in the shallows or for 
supporting the enormous body on 
slippery rocks. Most peculiar to 
Steller were the clawless forefeet, 
which he said resembled horses&apos; 
hoofs, except that they were &quot;fur- 
nished underneath with many short 
and closely set bristles like a scratch 
brush.&quot;

Bering Sea 









A few weeks before leaving Ber- 
ing Island in August 1742, Steller 
was able to dissect a sea cow that 
had been caught a few days pre- 
viously. The specimen, a female, 
measured twenty-four feet in length 
and twenty feet at its greatest cir- 
cumference. Its heart weighed 36&apos;/2 
pounds; the stomach stretched six 
by five feet and was so stuffed with 
seaweed that four strong men with 
a rope could scarcely move it. The 
length of the intestinal tract, from 
pharynx to anus, was 5,968 inches, 
or almost twenty times the animal&apos;s 
length. Steller took forty-seven 
measurements as he charted an 
anatomical map of the external and 
internal organs. In a brief descrip- 
tion, he said the bones seemed sur- 
prisingly large and dense. 

Steller noted the sea cows&apos; be- 
havior as he watched them during 
his nine-month stay on the island. 



He described their preference for 
shallow and sandy places along the 
shore, particularly at the mouths of 
freshwater streams where they 
sometimes came in so close that he 
stroked their backs. They pastured 
in family groups — a male, a female, 
and a &quot;little tender one&quot;; the adults 
always keeping the calf in front or, 
when traveling in a group, guarding 
it in the midst of the herd. Steller 
believed they were monogamous, 
with mating usually in early spring 
and most of the single newborns 
appearing in autumn after a pre- 
sumed gestation of more than a 
year. 

The sea cow&apos;s docile disposition 
and slow-moving habits, its (pre- 
sumed) low reproduction rate and 
limited distribution were its undo- 
ing. In addition, its single-minded 
appetite for certain seaweeds made 
it heedless of all danger. One could 



safely row a boat into their midst 
while they grazed with heads un- 
derwater. Furthermore, even an in- 
jured sea cow would do little more 
than move out from the shallow 
water and return later, apparently 
bewildered. Aware of these habits, 
the Bering crew set out in the calm 
seas of May to capture and kill the 
delicious food source floating 
offshore. Their early attempts 
failed, but in June 1742 they hooked 
a sea cow from a boat and pulled it in 
by rope, a feat requiring the efforts 
of forty men on land. En route the 
beast struggled and moaned softly. 
On subsequent occasions, when 
one of the herd was hooked, its 
companions tried to rescue the cap- 
tive by pressing on the rope or 
upsetting the boat with their backs. 
Once landed, the immense animal 
was carved into sections. The resul- 
tant steaks were described as &quot;ex- 
ceedingly savory&quot;; even more de- 
licious to the malnourished crew 
was the fat, which tasted like sweet 
almond oil. 

Several weeks after the first sea 
cow was killed, the crew set out in a 
rebuilt boat for their Russian 
homeland. They took with them a 
supply of sea cow fat and salted 
meat, and news of a fortune to be 
made in sea otter, fox, and seal 
furs — with a food source in the sea 
cow. For the next twenty-seven 
years, successive fur-seeking ex- 
peditions slaughtered the sea cow. 
According to Steller&apos;s biographer. 
Leonhard Stejneger, the animal 
was rarely killed outright; instead, 
the wounded sea cow usually died 
slowly of its wounds. Only one out 
of five killed was actually con-

Slimed. In 1768 the last sea cow 
was killed, as recorded by explorer 
Martin Sauer. 

Stejneger, after one and a half 
years on Bering Island, determined 
that if the fifteen river mouths 
where the sea cows congregated 
were visited by herds of only fifteen 
or twenty animals, they would have 
seemed abundant, even though the 
total population may not have been 
more than a few hundred. He esti- 
mated the population on Bering 
Island in Steller&apos;s time at fewer 
than 1 ,500 and concluded that those 
animals seen after 1768 were stray 
female narwhals. As for the cause of 
the rapid disappearance, he wrote in 
an article in The American Natu- 
ralist. 1887: 

There can hardly be any doubt that 
these animals were the last survivors 
of a once more numerous and more 
widely distributed species, which had 
been spared to that late date because 
man had not yet reached their last re- 
sort. It is, then, pretty safe to assume 
that this colony was not on the in- 
crease, and that, under the most favor- 
able circumstances, the number of sur- 
viving young ones barely balanced the 
number of deaths caused by the dan- 
gers of the long winters. Under this 
supposition, every animal killed by a 
new agency — in this case by man — 
represents one less in the total number. 



Sea cow &quot;sightings&quot; since 1768 
have been the subject of much dis- 
pute, yet they persist — fueled per- 
haps by the wish that somehow 
Steller&apos;s beast has managed to sur- 
vive. Expeditions in 1772 and 1783 
failed to find any sea cows. This 
probably came as no surprise, for 
in 1755 a petition had been filed 
with authorities in Kamchatka by 
Peter JakovleflF, a mining engineer, 
requesting that sea cow hunting be 
restricted because the animals had 
already disappeared from Copper 
Island and would soon be gone 
from Bering Island. Some investi- 
gators extended the sea cow&apos;s de- 
mise beyond 1768. Among them 
was Norwegian explorer A.E. Nor- 
denskiold, who visited Bering Island 
for five days in 1879. While there, 
he spoke with three natives who 
stated that they had seen animals of 
this description as late as 1854. 

Even in recent years, there have 
been reports of sea cows in the 
North Pacific. In July 1962, a So- 
viet research vessel near Cape 
Navarin, northeast of the Kam- 
chatka Peninsula, came within 300 
feet of six very large, unusual- 
looking dark-skinned animals feed- 
ing offshore. They had relatively 
small heads and bifurcated upper 
lips, which, perhaps because of 



their thick whiskers, seemed to pro- 
ject beyond their lower lips. The 
animals, twenty to twenty-seven 
feet long, maintained a tight forma- 
tion, swam slowly, dived at regular 
intervals for short periods, and 
emerged high out of the water. A 
similar animal was seen in the same 
area on the following day. In an 
article in the Soviet scientific jour- 
nal Priroda, the authors (A. A. Ber- 
zin, E.A. Tikhomirov, and V.I. 
Troinin) state that this sighting was 
only the most recent of several that 
had been reported in the region. To 
show that such reports were not 
impossible, they added that since 
the 1950s two completely new 
marine mammal species had been 
discovered — the ginkgo-toothed 
whale and the Gulf of California 
porpoise. 

As anticipated by the authors, 
the sea cow sighting was chal- 
lenged, also in Priroda (1965), by 
Soviet zoologist V.G. Heptn^r, 
who labeled it another in a trend of 
reporting Loch Ness-like creatures. 
He noted a gap of 194 years be- 
tween the last trustworthy sea cow 
sighting (1768) and the Cape Na- 
varin report (1962), and asked, 
could such a visible animal, one 
whose back was usually exposed 
and on which seagulls often

Leonluud Stejneger&apos;s reconstruction of a Steller&apos;s sea cow shows it 

being measured for the first time 



perched, an animal that grazed near 
shore and left behind heaps of sea- 
weed piled on the beach, have been 
overlooked all this time? Since the 
Soviet regime, he added, the faunal 
components of the region have 
been thoroughly known; and even 
earlier, when Russians and Ameri- 
cans hunted in the region, the sea 
cow was never mentioned. 

In 1977 the sea cow surfaced 
again in an article in Kamcliatsky 
Komsomolets. a newspaper in Pet- 
ropavlovsk, Kamchatka. It de- 
scribed a sighting by fishermen in 
Anapkinskaya Bay, a region south 
of Cape Navarin. The author, Vlad- 
imir Malukovich of the Kamchatka 
Museum of Local Lore, inter- 
viewed one of the fishermen, who 
described an &quot;unknown animal on 
a tidal belt&quot; that was neither seal 
nor sea lion. The translation reads: 
&quot;Its skin was dark, its extremities 
were flippers, its tail forked like a 
whale. A slight outline of round ribs 
was noticeable. We approached the 
animal, touched it and were sur- 



prised as its head bore an unusual 
form and its snout was long.&quot; 
When shown a drawing of a Steller 
sea cow, the fisherman stated that 
this was the animal — the same tail, 
fore flippers, and head — and he was 
surprised to learn that it presum- 
ably no longer existed. 

Edward Mitchell, research biolo- 
gist for the Canadian Department 
of Fisheries, has suggested that the 
unknown animal may have been a 
stray northern elephant seal. This 
large pinniped, whose usual range 
extends from Baja California to 
northern British Columbia, would 
fit the description: large in size, 
dark in color, and having a promi- 
nent snout. Its bipartite tail, if com- 
pressed, might have resembled a 
forked tail. The northern elephant 
seal has shown a tendency to wan- 
der thousands of miles from its 
normal centers of abundance. It has 
been seen at Prince of Wales Island, 
Alaska; at Midway Island in the 
mid-Pacific; and at Ugamak Island 
in the Aleutians, an area not far

from the sea cow&apos;s former grazing 
grounds in the Bering Sea. 

Nonetheless, Mitchell believes 
that the extinct status of the Steller&apos;s 
sea cow is a presumption. He says: 
&quot;There simply haven&apos;t been ex- 
haustive inventories of marine ver- 
tebrates so that one could state 
unequivocably that this or any spe- 
cies does not survive.&quot; Rather than 
speculate further, he suggests that 
it would be a simple, albeit costly, 
effort to survey the area by ship. 
&quot;While a lack of sightings may not 
resolve the issue,&quot; he says, &quot;a con- 
firmed sighting or a capture cer- 
tainly would.&quot; 

Aside from such reports, the sad 
fact remains that there is no hard 
proof that the Steller&apos;s sea cow sur- 
vived, at least for very long, past 
1768. Beyond this, the evidence is 
insubstantial — as elusive as the 
North Pacific mists. However un- 
wittingly, it looks like humans 
struck the last blow and Steller&apos;s 
giant browser perished — the victim 
of human appetites. D

This View of Life 



by Stephen Jay Gould 



The Panda&apos;s Peculiar Thumb 



When nature uses a Tinkertoy 
approach, evohition&apos; s role 
becomes more apparent 

Few heroes lower their sights in 
the prime of their hves; triumph 
leads inexorably on, often to de- 
struction. Alexander wept because 
he had no new worlds to conquer; 
Napoleon, overextended, sealed his 
doom in the depth of a Russian 
winter. But Charles Darwin did not 
follow the Origin of Species (1859) 
with a general defense of natural 
selection or with its evident exten- 
sion to human evolution (he waited 
until 1871 to publish The Descent of 
Man), but with his most obscure 
work, a book entitled: On the Vari- 
ous Contrivances by Which British 
and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilized 
by Insects (1862). 

Darwin&apos;s many excursions into 
the minutiae of natural history — he 
wrote a taxonomy of barnacles, a 
book on climbing plants, and a 
treatise on the formation of vegeta- 
ble mold by earthworms — won him 
an undeserved reputation as an old- 
fashioned, somewhat doddering de- 
scriber of curious plants and ani- 
mals who had one lucky insight at 
the right time. A rash of Darwinian 
scholarship has laid this myth firmly 
to rest during the past twenty years. 
Before then, one prominent scholar 
spoke for many ill-informed col- 
leagues when he judged Darwin as a 
&quot;poor joiner of ideas ... a man 
who does not belong with the great 
thinkers.&quot; 

In fact, each of Darwin&apos;s books 
played its part in the grand and 
coherent scheme of his life&apos;s 
work — demonstrating the fact of 



evolution and defending natural 
selection as its primary mechanism. 
Darwin did not study orchids solely 
for their own sake. Michael Ghise- 
lin, a California biologist who finally 
took the trouble to read all of Dar- 
win&apos;s books (see his Triumph of the 
Darwinian Method. University of 
California Press), has correctly 
identified the treatise on orchids as 
an important battle in Darwin&apos;s 
campaign for evolution. 

Darwin began with an important 
evolutionary premise: continued 
self-fertilization is a poor strategy 
for long-term survival. With self- 
fertilization, offspring carry only the 
genes of their single parent, and 
populations do not maintain enough 
variation for evolutionary flexibility 
in the face of environmental change. 
Thus, plants bearing flowers with 
both male and female parts usually 
evolve a mechanism to ensure 
cross-pollination. Orchids have 
formed an alliance with insects. 
They have evolved an astonishing 
variety of &quot;contrivances&quot; to attract 
insects, guarantee that their sticky 
pollen adheres to the visitor, and 
ensure that the attached pollen 
comes in contact with female parts 
of the next orchid the insect visits. 

Darwin&apos;s book is a compendium 
of these contrivances, the botanical 
equivalent of a bestiary. And like 
the medieval bestiaries, it is de- 
signed to instruct. The message is 
paradoxical but profound. Orchids 
manufacture their intricate devices 
from the common components of 
flowers, parts usually fitted for very 
different functions. If God had de- 
signed a beautiful machine to reflect 
his wisdom and power, surely he 
would not have used a collection of 



parts generally fashioned for other 
purposes. Orchids were not made 
by an ideal engineer; they are jury- 
rigged from a limited set of available 
components. Thus, they must have 
evolved from ordinary flowers. &quot; 

Thus, the paradox: Our text- 
books like to illustrate evolution 
with examples of optimal design — 
nearly perfect mimicry of a dead 
leaf by a buttei&quot;fly or of a poisonous 
species by a palatable relative. But 
ideal design is a lousy argument for 
evolution, for it mimics the postu- 
lated action of an omnipotent 
creator. Odd arrangements and 
funny solutions are the proof of evo- 
lution — paths that a sensible God 
would never tread but that a natural 
process, constrained by history, 
follows perforce. No one under- 
stood this better than Darwin. Ernst 
Mayr has shown how Darwin con- 
sistently turned to organic parts and 
geographic distributions that make 
the least sense for his defense of 
evolution. Which brings me to the 
giant panda and its &quot;thumb.&quot; 

Giant pandas are peculiar bears, 
members of the order Carnivora. 
Conventional bears are the most 
omnivorous representatives of their 
order, but pandas have restricted 
this catholicity of taste in the other 
direction — they belie their order by 
subsisting entirely on bamboo. 
They live in dense bamboo forests 
at high elevations in the mountains 
of western China. There they sit, 
largely unthreatened by predators, 
munching bamboo ten to twelve 
hours each day. 

As a childhood fan of Andy 

Panda, and a former owner of a 

stuffed toy won by some fluke when

SOME OF THE 

NEW COMPACT AUTOMATIC CAMERAS 

SEEM VERY EASY TO USE. 

UNTIL YOU START USING THEM. 



There&apos;s more to an easy-to-use camera than 
automatic exposure. Yet that&apos;s what most of 
the new 35mm reflex cameras are: auto- 
matic, but hard to use. 

Here&apos;s why the Minolta XG-7 makes fine 
photography both automatic and easy 

It&apos;s easy to take perfectly exposed pic- 
tures. Just point, focus and shoot The elec- 
tronic shutter in the XG-7 sets itself auto- 
matically up to 1 / 1 000th of a second. 

But it&apos;s hard to take an over-exposed pic- 
ture. On automatic operation, the shutter 
locks to prevent over-exposures. It also 
locks when your batteries are too weak. 

Easy focusing. The XG-7&apos;s viewfinder is 
big and bright, even in the corners. Your 
subject snaps into critical sharpness. 

It&apos;s easy to be creative. You can make the 
automatic exposure setting brighter or 
darker for creative effects. 

An easy-to-understand electronic view- 
finder. Light emitting diodes tell how the 
XG-7 is setting itself and warn against under- 
or over-exposure. 



An easy-to-see electronic self-timer. 

The self-timer lets you get into your 
own pictures. It&apos;s a large flashing light 
mounted on the front of the camera. The 
flashing speeds up to let you know when the 
picture is about to be taken

America without 
Wilderness is 
as unttiinlcable as 
America witliout 
forest products. 

At Potlatch, we&apos;re tree farmers and wood 
converters. That&apos;s our business. 

But when we aren&apos;t working, many of us 
are also campers, hikers, hunters, fishermen. 
That&apos;s our recreation. 

So we can appreciate from firsthand expe- 
rience the need for Wilderness. 

The question is: how much is enough? 

In search of an answer, the Idaho Forest 
Council interviewed residents of the state last 
year. 

They found that 72% of the general public 
questioned felt there was no need to expand 
Idaho&apos;s Wilderness (about 14% of the state&apos;s 
national forestland). This is the opinion of people 
living in a timber-rich state. 

So perhaps, better than most of us, they 
understand there must be both working forests 
and Wilderness. 

Today, government and industry agree that 
the demand for forest products will nearly 
double in just 42 years. 

Setting aside unrealistlcally increased 
areas for Wilderness diminishes any chance of 
meeting America&apos;s growing need for forest 
products. 

Wilderness. Forest products. Potlatch 
believes that with balance we can have all we 
need of both.

expertly led by capable mountaineers: 

LadakhTrek 

JULY AND SEPTEMBER, 1979 

These expeditions include a trek 
through the lovely valleys and moun- 
tains of Kashmir into the remote 
country of Ladakh. which was until 
recently closed to visitors. Before and 
after the trek, first class hotel and 
houseboat accommodations are pro- 
vided in Delhi and Srinagar. 

Inga 
Trek in Peru 

JULY, AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, 1979 

These expeditions provide the stir- 
ring experience of walking along the 
ancient Inca trail from Cuzco high 
above the lovely Urubamba Valley, at 
a leisurely pace over three passes 
and through fabulous Andean scenery 
to fvlachu Picchu, the most dramat- 
ically spectacular archaeological site 
in the world. Before and after the 
trek, first class hotel accommoda- 
tions are provided in Lima and Cuzco. 

Himalayan 
Trek in Nepal 

FEBRUARY AND NOVEMBER, 1979 

These expeditions are unique not only 
due to the expert leadership but be- 
cause they combine a trek on foot in 
the Annapurna region with a trek on 
elephant back through the Terai 
jungle, and a canoe trip on the Rapti 
River. Between the treks, first class 
hotel accommodations are provided; 
and the expedition ends with five 
days in Northern India, visiting Delhi. 
Agra and Jaipur. 



Please send tor detailed brochures of 
these treks — we also specialize in 
cruises in the Galapagos Islands and 
the Hebrides, safaris to Rajasthan and 
East Africa and adventure tours to 
French Guiana and other unusual

all the milk bottles actually tumbled 
at the county fair, I was delighted 
when the first fruits of our thaw with 
China went beyond Ping-Pong to 
the shipment of two pandas to the 
Washington zoo. I went and 
watched in appropriate awe. They 
yawned, stretched, and ambled a 
bit, but they spent nearly all their 
time feeding on their beloved bam- 
boo. They sat upright and manipu- 
lated the stalks with their forepaws, 
shedding the leaves and consuming 
only the shoots. 

I was amazed by their dexterity 
and wondered how the scion of a 
stock adapted for running could use 
its hands so adroitly. They held the 
stalks of bamboo in their paws and 
stripped off the leaves by passing 
the stalks between an apparently 
flexible thumb and the remaining 
fingers. This puzzled me. 1 had 
always learned that a dexterous, 
opposable thumb stood among the 
hallmarks of human success. We 
had maintained, even exaggerated, 
this important flexibility of our pri- 
mate forebears, while most mam- 
mals had sacrificed it in specializing 
their digits. Carnivores run, stab, 
and scratch. My cat manipulates 
me in the psychological sense, but 



he&apos;ll never type or play the piano. 

So I counted the panda&apos;s other 
digits and received an even greater 
surprise: there were five, not four. 
Was the &quot;thumb&quot; a separately 
evolved sixth finger? Fortunately, 
the giant panda has its bible, a 
monograph by D. Dwight Davis, 
late curator of vertebrate anatomy 
at Chicago&apos;s Field Museum of Nat- 
ural History. Probably the greatest 
work of modern evolutionary com- 
parative anatomy, it contains more 
than anyone would ever want to 
know about pandas {The Giant 
Panda, a Morphological Study of 
Evolutionary Mechanisms). Davis 
had the answer, of course. 

The panda&apos;s thumb is not, 
anatomically, a finger at all. It is 
made from a bone called the radial 
sesamoid, normally a very small 
component of the wrist. In pandas, 
the radial sesamoid is greatly en- 
larged and elongated until it almost 
equals the true digits in size. The 
radial sesamoid underlies a pad on 
the panda&apos;s forepaw; the five digits 
form the framework of another pad, 
the palmar. A shallow furrow sepa- 
rates the two pads and serves as a 
channelway for bamboo stalks. 

The panda&apos;s thumb comes

equipped not only with a bone to 
give it strength but also with mus- 
cles to sustain its agility. As with the 
radial sesamoid, these muscles did 
not arise de novo; like the parts of 
Darwin&apos;s orchids, they are familiar 
bits of anatomy remodeled for a new 
function. The abductor of the radial 
sesamoid (the muscle that pulls it 
away from the true digits) bears the 
formidable name abductor pollicis 
longus (&quot;the long abductor of the 
thumb&quot; — pollicis is the genitive of 
polle.x. Latin for &quot;thumb&quot;). Its 
name is a giveaway. In other carni- 
vores, this muscle attaches to the 
first digit, or true thumb. 

Does the anatomy of other carni- 
vores give us any clue to the origin 
of this odd arrangement in pandas? 
Davis points out that ordinary bears 
and raccoons, the closest relatives 
of giant pandas, far surpass all other 
carnivores in using their forelegs for 
manipulating objects in feeding. 
Pardon the backward metaphor, but 
pandas, thanks to their ancestry, 
began with a leg up for evolving 
greater dexterity in feeding. 
Moreover, ordinary bears already 
have a slightly enlarged radial 
sesamoid. 

In most carnivores, the same 



D. L. Cramer 



muscles that move the radial 
sesamoid in pandas attach exclu- 
sively to the base of the pollex, or 
true thumb. But in ordinary bears, 
the long abductor muscle ends in 
two tendons: one inserts into the 
base of the thumb as in most carni- 
vores, but the other attaches to the 
radial sesamoid. Two shorter mus- 
cles also attach, in part, to the radial 
sesamoid in bears. &quot;Thus,&quot; Davis 
concludes, &quot;the musculature for 
operating this remarkable new 
mechanism — functionally a new 
digit — required no intrinsic change 
from conditions already present in 
the panda&apos;s closest relatives, the 
bears. Furthermore, it appears that 
the whole sequence of events in the 
musculature follows automatically 
from simple hypertrophy of the 
sesamoid bone.&quot; 

The radial thumb of pandas is a 
complex structure formed by 
marked enlargement of a bone and 
an extensive rearrangement of mus- 
culature. Yet Davis argues that the 
entire apparatus arose as a me- 
chanical response to growth of the 
radial sesamoid itself. Muscles 
shifted because the enlarged bone 
blocked them short of their original 
sites. Moreover, Davis postulates

that the bigger radial sesamoid may 
have been fashioned by a very sim- 
ple genetic change, perhaps a single 
mutation affecting the timing and 
rate of growth. 

In a panda&apos;s foot, the counterpart 
of the radial sesamoid, called the 
tibial sesamoid, is also enlarged, 
although not so much as the radial 
sesamoid. Yet the tibial sesamoid 
supports no new digit, and its in- 
creased size confers no advantage, 
so far as we know. Davis argues that 
the coordinated increase of both 
bones, in response to natural selec- 
tion upon one alone, probably re- 
flects a simple kind of genetic 
change. Repeated parts of the body 
are not fashioned by the action of 
individual genes — there is no gene 
&quot;for&quot; your thumb, another for your 
big toe, or a third for your pinky. 
Repeated parts are coordinated in 
development; selection for a change 
in one element causes a correspond- 
ing modification in others. It may be 
genetically more complex to enlarge 
a thumb and not to modify a big toe, 
than to increase both together. (In 
the first case, a general coordination 
must be broken, the thumb favored 
separately, and correlated increase 
of related structures suppressed. In 
the second, a single gene may in- 
crease the growth rate in a field reg- 
ulating the development of digits.) 

The panda&apos;s thumb provides an 
elegant zoological counterpart to 
Darwin&apos;s orchids. An engineer&apos;s 
best solution is debarred by history. 
The panda&apos;s true thumb is commit- 
ted to another role, too specialized 
for a different function to become an 
opposable, manipulating digit. So 



the panda must use parts on hand 
and settle for an enlarged wrist bone 
and a somewhat clumsy, but quite 
workable, solution. The radial 
thumb is, to use Michael Ghiselin&apos;s 
phrase, a contraption, not a lovely 
contrivance. But it does its job and 
excites our imagination all the more 
because it builds on such im- 
probable foundations. 

Darwin&apos;s orchid book is filled 
with similar illustrations. The marsh 
Epipactis. for example, uses its 
labellum — an enlarged petal — as a 
trap. The labellum is divided into 
two parts. One, near the flower&apos;s 
base, forms a large cup filled with 
nectar — the object of an insect&apos;s 
visit. The other, near the flower&apos;s 
edge, forms a sort of landing stage. 
An insect alighting on this runway 
depresses it and thus gains entrance 
to the nectar cup beyond. It enters 
the cup, but the runway is so elastic 
that it instantly springs up, trapping 
the insect within the nectar cup. The 
insect must then back out through 
the only available exit — a path that 
forces it to brush against the pollen 
masses. A remarkable machine but 
all developed from a conventional 
petal, a part readily available in an 
orchid&apos;s ancestor. 

Darwin then shows how the same 
labellum in other orchids evolves 
into a series of ingenious devices to 
ensure cross-fertilization. It may 
develop a complex fold that forces 
an insect to detour its proboscis 
around and past the pollen masses 
in order to reach nectar. It may 
contain deep channels or guiding 
ridges that lead insects to both nec- 
tar and pollen. The channels some- 



times form a tunnel, producing a 
tubular flower. All these from a part 
that began as a conventional petal in 
some ancestral form. Yet nature can 
do so much with so little that it 
displays, in Darwin&apos;s words, &quot;a 
prodigality of resources for gaining 
the very same end. namely, the 
fertilization of one flower by pollen 
from another plant.&quot; 

Darwin&apos;s metaphor for organic 
form reflects his sense of wonder 
that evolution could fashion such a 
world of diversity and adequate de- 
sign with such limited raw material: 

Although an organ may not have been 
originally formed for some special pur- 
pose, if it now serves for this end we are 
justified in saying that it is specially 
contrived for it. On the same principle, 
if a man were to make a machine for 
some special purpose, but were to use 
old wheels, springs, and pulleys, only 
slightly altered, the whole machine, 
with all its parts, might be said to be 
specially contrived for that purpose. 
Thus throughout nature almost every 
part of each living being has probably 
served, in a slightly modified condition, 
for diverse purposes, and has acted in 
the living machinery of many ancient 
and distinct specific forms. 

We may not be flattered by the 
metaphor of refurbished wheels and 
pulleys, but consider how well we 
work. Nature is, in biologist Fran- 
9ois Jacob&apos;s words, an excellent 
tinkerer, not a divine artificer. And 
who shall sit in judgment between 
these exemplary skills&apos;?

for the best possible exposure. And, you enjoy 
this automatic certainty with any of nearly 60 
Nikkor lenses — optics unrivalled in sharpness, 
in color fidelity, in variety, in sheer excellence. 

You know you are handling a Nikon when you 
put the FE to your eye. Only a Nikon responds 
with quite the same swift, smooth precision. The 
compact FEfits your hands comfortably, its full- 
size controls right under your fingers. The image 
you see in the viewfinder is bright and clear. 
As you compose your photo, complete exposure 
information is also visible in the finder. You are 
in constant control of every picture, confident 
that you&apos; II never miss any of those special 
events in your life. mf 



But there&apos;s more to the FE than automatic 
simplicity. This is a full-featured camera, 
complete with full manual controls that let you 
add creative effects and visual impact to your 
photography. Multiple exposures, where images 
are blended into one another, are accomplished 
with surprising ease. An optional high speed 
motor drive can advance thefdm automatically 
or create breathtaking action sequences. There 
is also an ingenious Nikon SB-IO automatic 
flash that actually adjusts the camera for the 
correct synch setting. Choose a Nikkor telephoto 
lens to bring distant scenes closer. ..or a Nikkor 
wide angle lens to expand your view. . . . 

Don &apos;t wait another day to experience the 
Nikon FE. See your Nikon dealer (he&apos;s in the 
Yellow Pages). And, ask him also about the 
travelingNikon School. Or, write to Dept. N-2,

Lesson 
from a dyii^ 

breed. 



Extinction is a dreadful word. Like 
Donne&apos;s bell, it doesn&apos;t ring. It tolls. And 
it&apos;s tolling for the eagle now, which puts 
us in danger, too. 

We&apos;re in danger of losing the living 
synnbol of our highest standards: Pride. 
Honor. Honesty. To lose the eagle 
would be sad. To forget him would be 
tragic. 

At Whirlpool we believe it&apos;s our 
duty to remember. Remember what 
these standards mean to us. In our lives. 
And in our business. 

We start with pride. To make some- 
thing of quality is a challenge these 
days. An appliance is either quality 
built or it isn&apos;t. And if it isn&apos;t good 
enough for us, we know it&apos;s not good 
enough for you. 

The test of honor and honesty 
comes after the sale. We believe a cus- 
tomer should always be treated like a 
customer. Now, or years from now. 
With this in mind, we&apos;ve developed 
several ways of extending our services 
for as long as anyone needs them. 



For example, we have Cool-Line® 
service. A toll free phone number you 
can call with any problem or question. 
Try it. We&apos;re glad when people do. (800) 
253-1301. In Alaska and Hawaii, (800) 
253-1121. In Michigan, (800) 632-2243. 

And if you ever do need service, 
just call Tech-Care&apos; service. It&apos;s our 
nationwide franchised service . . . from 
a group of service technicians who 
know what they&apos;re doing. And who will 
be happy to come out and help you 
whenever you need them. They&apos;re in 
the Yellow Pages. 

Or our warranty. It&apos;s written clearly, 
simply. It can be read, understood and 
used with confidence. We feel that&apos;s 
the way a warranty should work. 

These services are really exten- 
sions of our way of thinking. Our way 
of life. They represent our standards: 
Pride. Honor. Honesty. 

They may be in danger. They may 
be impractical. But at Whirlpool, we 
believe it&apos;s our duty to keep them very 
much alive.

Since 1972, when we started our 
tours, cruises and expeditions for ad- 
venturous travelers, many people 
have asked us for a safari in East 
Africa; we did not wish to compete 
with others in this field and waited 
until we could offer a program which 
is unique and has been carefully sur- 
veyed to provide the outdoor living 
that inspired Hemingway&apos;s novels— 
the true way to appreciate Africa, Its 
people, and its wildlife. 

We now invite twelve intrepid travel- 
ers to see Africa as did the explorers 
before the tourists came, on our

A Matter of Taste 



by Raymond Sokolov 



Root Awakening 



Although unfamiliar outside 
the tropics, manioc provides 
subsistence to millions 



&quot;Once upon a time men had neither 
sweet manioc nor fire. An old woman 
was given the secret of the first by the 
ants; and her friend, the nocturnal swal- 
low . . . would obtain fire for her 
(keeping it hidden in his beak), so that 
she could cook the manioc, instead of 
heating it by exposure to the sun or by 
putting it under her armpits. 

&quot;The Indians found the old woman&apos;s 
manioc cakes excellent and asked how 
she prepared them. She replied that she 
simply baked them in the heat of the 
sun. The swallow, amused by this false- 
hood, burst out laughing, and the In- 
dians saw flames coming from his 
mouth. They forced it open and took 
possession of the fire. Since then noc- 
turnal swallows have had gaping 
beaks.&quot; 

Tacuna myth. 

Quoted by Claude Levi-Strauss 

in The Raw and the Cooked. 

Manioc — the staff of life for some 
200 million people in the tropics — is 
probably the most mysterious and 
misunderstood of all important 
foods. In one form or another, this 
prolific, easily cultivated plant sup- 
plies the bulk of food energy for the 
masses of Brazil and black Africa. 
Whole cuisines are built on ManUiot 
ulilissima (alias M. escidenta); as 
fufu or gari or farofa, it is the tropi- 
cal world&apos;s cornflakes and potato 
chips and bread all rolled into one 
indispensable, all-purpose, univer- 
sal starch. But I will bet that almost 
no readers of this magazine think 
they have eaten or even seen it. 

Actually, manioc, in the proc- 
essed form of tapioca, does occa- 
sionally appear on American tables. 



And anyone who pays attention to- 
tropical produce sold to Hispanic 
customers in New York and other 
North American cities with Carib- 
bean enclaves will have noticed 
those bulky, tuberous, whitish 
vegetables that are called yuca in 
Spanish and cassava in English. 
This chaos of nomenclature un- 
doubtedly adds to the confusion 
surrounding a remarkable plant. 

By the time the Portuguese dis- 
covered manioc among the indig- 
enous Tupinamba peoples of the 
Brazilian coast, this shrubby peren- 
nial of the spurge, or Euphor- 
biaceae, family had been under cul- 
tivation in this hemisphere for mil- 
lenniums. Manioc roots are de- 
picted on 4,000-year-old Peruvian 
pottery. It is called yuca in Aztec 
and Maya chronicles and was prob- 
ably domesticated in Mesoamerica. 
The other vernacular names for M. 
utilissima are all pre-Columbian, 
from Arawak, Carib, or other tribal 
languages in tropical America. 
Tapioca seems to have always ap- 
plied to the cooked starch; yuca 
may have referred only to the edible 
product; and mainuca (the Carib 
form of manioc) to the whole root. 
At any rate, modern usage reflects 
the accidents of colonial occupa- 
tion. Anglophone Africa says cas- 
sava; Spanish speakers settled on 
yuca; the French say manioc; 
Asians call all forms of manioc 
tapioca. Everyone agrees, how- 
ever, that Manihot is an extremely 
poor source of nutrition. It is 
roughly one percent protein, half as 
rich as potatoes. The rest is almost 
entirely starch, but that is the point. 

Like the potato in the diet of the 
Irish in the nineteenth century, 
manioc makes life for millions pos-

Brand New. 
LCD 

Alarm ^ 
Chronograph 



This spring and summer, our LCD Alarm 
Chronograph was a njnaway best seller It&apos;s 
sold out in fact. For this reason, we&apos;ve improved 
it. Made It even bolder and more exciting, with 
•extra convenience features and for less money! 
How? By placing one of the largest watch 
orders in our history. . . and passing the quan- 
tity savings along to you. 

Truly Extraordinary 

This new LCD Alarm Chronograph is truly 
extraordinary. It does more and does it better 
than any other watch. With an impressive, 
dramatic appearance that reflects its uncom- 
mon ability. 

Remarkable Value 

The only thing about it that&apos;s not extravagant 
is its price. It&apos;s actually over $200.00 less than 
the nationally advertised watch that comes 
close to its usefulness and accuracy 





Quartz Crystal Time... The LCD Alarm 
Chronograph gives you accuracy to ± 60 sec- 
onds a year Quartz crystal accuracy that would 
have been considered sensational per month in 
earlier micro-electronic watches. And is still not 
available in models selling for as much as 
$500.00 to $1000.00. 

The Electronic Calendar. .. So you always 
have exactly the right time on display — the 
hours, minutes and running seconds, plus the 
day of the week. Then, at a touch, you can 
replace the time with the month and date. Of 
course, the electronic calendar adjusts au- 
tomatically for the number of days in ttie month. 
Then, so you can see when it&apos;s dim or you&apos;re in 
the dark, the face lights up. 

Correct 
date is 
August 8th 

24 Hour Alarm 

Of all the features available in digital watches 
today, an alarm system like this is the one that&apos;s 
most wanted. And no wonder It will wake you; 
remind you of your appointments, phone calls 
and meetings (or break one up that&apos;s been 
going on too long). It&apos;s really important enough 
all by itself to warrant your getting a new watch. 

You can set this alarm for any minute of any 
hour. Day or night. In all, 1440 positions are 
available — easily and instantly Then, unless 
you change or deactivate it, the alarm will 
sound for a full minute at the same time every 
day With an insistent, though pleasant, beep. 
When the alarm is set, an A appears on the 
face. To check the time it&apos;ll go off, |ust touch the 
alarm button. 



Set to 
ring at 
11:45P.IWl. 





The Chronograph System 

As to the chronograph, or split-second timer 
it&apos;s precision is so fine, it borders on the in- 
finitesimal. Imagine, it enables you to time an 
event for up to an hour to one-hundredth of a 
second . . . and beyond that, for a full 24 hours, 
to the second! On top of which, you can time an 
event in memory keeping the regular time of 
display until you need the chronograph 
readout. Then, as you&apos;ll see in the explanation 
to the far right, the chronograph measures or 
stops time, in an extraordinary variety of ways. 

This exceptional versatility makes the LCD 
Alarm Chronograph with its highly sophisti- 
cated micro-computer chip the ideal instrument 
for doctors, pilots, motion picture directors and 
photographers, sound and efficiency en- 
gineers, sportsmen of course, and every 
executive who wants the ability to command 
time to stand still. 

Only $70 

Right now, only the Seiko among nationally 
advertised brands has all these features. And it 
regularly sells for $299.95. Well over two 
hundred dollars more — even though its 
chronograph is accurate to only a tenth of a 
second. 

This incomparable value (proved after 
exhaustive quality control tests) is what really 
impressed us. And we&apos;re one of the oldest and 
largest mail merchandisers in America. 

30 Day Trial 

What is more, buying by mail, you can prove 
all this to your own satisfaction without risking 
one cent. You have thirty days to put the LCD 
Alarm Chronograph to the test — to confirm it 
won&apos;t gain or lose five seconds a month, prove 
the convenience of the alarm, satisfy yourself 
that the LCD Alarm Chronograph is as useful 
as it is easy to operate, fi/lore, to compare it with 
any watch at any price, and to send it back for a 
complete refund if the value is not as great as 
we say, if it doesn&apos;t arouse the admiration and 
fascination of your friends, win your own plea- 
sure and satisfaction. 

SilveHone or gold plated 

So order your LCD Alarm Chronograph to- 
day The price, including shipping, handling, 
insurance and a handsome gift case is just 
$70.00 with chrome case and stainless steel 
bracelet, or $80.00 in gold plated case and

The Multi-Function Chronograph System 

No other instrument, at any price, gives you greater 
precision than the 1/IOOth of a second accuracy of the 
new LCD Alarm Chronograph, or greater versatility 
and flexibility in timing an event from a fraction of a 
second to 24 hours. Only with the micro-electronic 
revolution could you have a multi-function chronog- 
raph, a chronograph that can be put in memory, in a 
sleek, thin, superbly styled timepiece like this. 



l54- IM85 



Timed to 

54 minutes and 

14.85 seconds 



#1 Add Time ... is the stop watch mode. You&apos;ll use it 
to time everything from a phone call to the length of a 
meeting. How long your car&apos;s been at a parking meter, 
the time you&apos;ve been jogging or exercising, even the 
time it takes a quarterback to set up and throw. With 
Add Time, you can stop when necessary like a time 
out in basketball, and start again when the action 
begins. Try it the next time you prepare a speech. 
#2 Split Time... is the mode you&apos;ll use to get the time 
of each contestant across the finish line, or to get the 
time for the V4 or the Vi or any interim. On Split Time 
the chronograph is actually stopped and running at 
the same time, so you can use it to figure the time of a 
pit stop, for example, and still get the over-all time of 
the race. 

#3 Twin Timing... Most extraordinary of all, you can 
actually combine these functions, using your chrono- 
graph as both a stopwatch and split timer. For exam- 
ple, a television producer would start timing a show, 
he then stops and starts the chronograph to get the 
time of the commercial, writes down the figure, and 
starls the chronograph again, which jumps ahead to 
the total elapsed time. With an ordinary or analog 
stopwatch, you&apos;d need two sets of hands to do this — 
and would probably have to pay more for just a stop- 
watch than for the LCD Alarm Chronograph. 

You&apos;ll find the chronograph so easy to use, you&apos;ll 
master it in minutes, and in days find innumerable 
business and personal uses. Take 30 days to prove it 
to yourself. 



Be sure to specify white or gold. You&apos;ll have the pre- 
cise time, absolute control over time, plus ample warn- 
ing when it&apos;s time to do anything. And the pride that 
comes with wearing a watch that&apos;s second to none.

sible because it provides cheap, 
abundant food energy. Protein, 
vitamins, and other vital nutriments 
must come from other sources. This 
is why most meals in tropical Africa 
consist of lumps of cassava paste or 
porridge dipped in protein-rich 
sauce. If such meals are only a sub- 
sistence diet, they do at least pro- 
vide subsistence. And there is also 
good evidence that people brought 
up on manioc love it and regard its 
innumerable cooked forms with all 
the fussiness and appetite that we 
reserve for lobster or for very thin, 
pounded white veal. 

Nontropical peoples like us don&quot;t 
know much about manioc because 
it doesn&apos;t grow in our climate. But 
in the zone bounded roughly by the 
30th parallels, north and south, it 
flourishes in the poor soil of rain 
forests. It resists locusts and other 
pests. It requires only the most 
cursory care and the simplest agri- 
cultural skills. Since it grows fast 
and is a plant for all seasons, it is 
ideally adapted to the seminomadic. 
slash-and-burn horticulture of 
aboriginal Amazonia and West 
Africa. Manioc cuttings mature in 
only a few months to plants aver- 
aging nine feet in height. Their roots 
swell into tuberous enlargements 
one to two feet long and two to six 
inches across. These weigh up to 
ten pounds, and a single plant can 
produce fifty pounds of edible root 
in stump-studded, crudely culti- 
vated dooryard plots. But there is a 
catch. 

Manioc is often toxic. Some 
plants generate lethal doses of prus- 
sic (hydrocyanic) acid. No doubt 
this faculty protects the plant from 
animal and insect attacks. The 
poison is not present in undisturbed 
plants. Small sacs under the peel 
or bark exude a milky latex when 
the bark is cut. This white juice 
contains a cyanogenetic glucoside 
(manihotoxine), which breaks down 
into prussic acid, glucose, and ace- 
tone. The natural enzyme linase 
frees the acid, and its action can be 
promoted by soaking the root in 
water, by cutting up the root to in- 
crease contact between linase and 
the acid, or by heating (but not 
above 75°C [167°F], since higher 
temperatures kill the linase). Once 
the acid has been liberated into the 
air by one or several of these 
methods, the manioc is safe to eat. 

Preliterate manioc consumers 
discovered how to handle poison- 



ous manioc. They also noticed that 
some plants were not toxic and so 
they assumed, as did botanists until 
recently, that there were two basic 
varieties of manioc, &quot;sweet&quot; and 
poisonous. More careful study has 
shown that the observed difference 
is not genetic; it comes from the en- 
vironment. Researchers have found 
that clones from poisonous plants 
will grow up sweet in new settings 
and vice versa. Indeed, the nature 
of manioc is so adaptable that vari- 
etal names have only limited value, 
for clones vary significantly under 
diverse conditions. Perhaps, then, 
we should not smile too broadly at 
the fanciful vernacular names for 
manioc used by the Yoruba of West 
Africa. The high-yielding onigbese 
duro gbowo (&quot;Creditor, wait to be 
paid&quot;) and the quick-cooking alejo 
duro ndanci (&quot;Stranger, wait, and I 
cook&quot;) are probably more prac- 
tical designations, because they de- 
scribe specific results, than more 
technical descriptions that imply 
something about future generations 
of plants from the same parent. 

Despite such diversity, manioc 
roots of all kinds are processed in 
the same basic ways once they have 
been detoxified. They are pounded, 
pressed, strained, ground, and dried 
to form meal, flour, starch, and 
stock. Meal is the principal prod- 
uct. In Brazil a wooden bowl of 
raw fariiilui de mandioca is served 
at every meal as a condiment for 
rice or beans, and it is still made by 
a process not far removed from the 
original Indian technology. The pri- 
mordial method involved grating 
the peeled root with a flat, stone- 
studded piece of wood and then 
pressing it in a tipiti, a cylindrical 
basket whose diameter and volume 
shrink when the ends are pulled. 
The pressed manioc is sieved and 
then toasted over a fire in a shallow 
pan. 

True manioc flour is made from 
dried root that is pulverized. To 
obtain starch, both Indians and non- 
Indians put grated, pressed manioc 
in water, stir, and let the starch 
settle. If the starch is sifted while 
damp and then toasted, it clumps 
into tapioca balls. Raw starch is 
used in laundries and for sizing new 
clothes. 

The toxic, milky liquid, a by- 
product of all these processes (vari- 
ously known as cassareep and 
manipuera), can be made safe by 
heating and used as a sauce base.

But now, he has trouble dialing a telephone. 



It&apos;s a shame. 

But there will be thousands of 
people this Christmas who won&apos;t 
even hear the voices of loved ones 
over the phone. 

Simply because it&apos;s hard for 
them to dial a phone. 

Well, now there&apos;s a remarkable 
device that can help them. An 
automatic telephone dialer that 
eliminates the need to look up and 
dial numbers. 

It&apos;s called a Code-A-Phone® 
Electronic Dialer. And it&apos;s as easy 
to use as flipping a light switch. 

Because to make a call, all you 
have to do is punch one button. 
The Electronic Dialer automatically 
picks the right phone number 
from the lopre- selected numbers 



stored in its electronic memory, 
and dials it. Whether it&apos;s local or 
lone distance. 

You can simpKfy it still further

Or you can pre-program numbers 
into the memory, such as your 
own number and emergency 
numbers, before giving it as a gift. 

And the Electronic Dialer is as 
convenient as it is easy to use. 
Two models have a built-in 
speaker that lets you hear your call 
go through before you pick up the 
receiver. One model also has an 
LED digital display that actually 
lets you see the number you&apos;re

So this Christmas, give the ones 
you love an Electronic Dialer. It&apos;ll 
make it easier for them to enjoy 
another precious gift.

TOURS 




■/Viji 



&quot;Nature tour&quot; has a special meaning when 
you travel with Questers. We are the on/y pro- 
fessional travel company specializing exclu- 
sively in nature tours. Our approach in plan- 
ning&apos; Worldwide Nature Tours is to provide 
you with the broadest possible opportunity of 
experiencing for yourself the natural history 
and culhire of each area we explore. With the 
leadership of an accompanying naturalist, we 
search out the plants and arumals, birds and 
flowers , . . rain forests, mountains, and tun- 
dra ... seashores, lakes, and swamps of the 
regions we visit. We also study the architec- 
ture, archaeology, museum collections, tem- 
ples, and customs of the people. 

Varying in length from 9 to 36 days, Ques- 
ters Worldwide Nahire Tours travel to virtu- 
ally every part of the world. Groups are small, 
and early reservations are therefore sug- 
gested. Listed below is a sampling of the 33 
destinations offered in 1979:

Finally, like all other starchy sub- 
stances, manioc can be fermented. 
Amazonian women and children 
chew the manioc to impregnate it 
with saliva and hasten the fermen- 
tation along. Although manioc beer 
probably has no future as a bever- 
age in industrial societies, whole 
roots and manioc meal are worth 
trying as alternatives to more fa- 
miliar starches. Toasted meal, 
called farofa in Brazil and gari in 
West Africa, is a real treat locally 
available at Hispanic and Brazilian 
specialty shops. Perhaps the best 
way to try it is in a gritslike recipe, 
imoyo eba, brought to Nigeria by 
ex-slaves returning to their home- 
land from Brazil, following the 
same route as manioc itself. 

First, the manioc meal should be 
toasted in a pan lightly greased with 
oil. Stir constantly. Then sprinkle 
this gari into a simmering pot con- 
taining IVi cups of chicken stock 
and 4 tablespoons of tomato paste. 
Cook briefly, until firm. Toasted 
meal can also be stirred into scram- 
bled eggs or mixed with chopped 
hard-boiled eggs, onion, and garlic 
to make a stuffing for poultry. You 
might try heating pork gravy, 
beaten egg, and gari to produce a 
sort of tropical Yorkshire pudding. 

If all else fails, you can fall back 
on tapioca. Most American markets 
supply only instant tapioca, finely 
ground pellets also called grists. 
The old-fashioned pearl tapioca 
makes a nice change. These larger 
granules (or the smaller ones) can 
be thickened with wine or fruit juice 
or, in a particularly lush variation, 
with coconut milk (see recipe). 

Pearl tapioca must be soaked in 
double its volume of water for at 
least an hour or until the water is 
absorbed. Nothing, of course, pre- 
vents you from buying a whole root 
from a tropical fruit and vegetable 
grocer, chopping it, soaking it, 
grating it yourself in a processor, 
and making your own cassava flat 
bread. But if you are going to em- 
bark on so strenuous an act of sym- 
bolic solidarity with the Third 
World (where more practical, but 
similarly inclined. First World 
botanists are now trying to develop 
high-protein strains of manioc) you 
should at least be careful you do not 
mistakenly buy a casaba — a melon 
named after a place in Turkey — or a 
yucca — a member of the lily family 
whose bloom is the state flower of 
New Mexico. 



Nigerian Coconut Milk Tapioca 

(Adapted from A West African 
Cookbook, by Ellen Gibson Wilson) 

1 fresh coconut 

3 tablespoons minute tapioca 

2 tablespoons sugar 

&apos;4 teaspoon nutmeg or allspice 
&apos;/a teaspoon salt 

1. To make coconut milk: 

A. Preheat oven to 325°. 

B. Punch holes in the coconut 
eyes and drain off the liquid 
into a bowl. Reserve liquid. 

C. Heat coconut in oven for 25 
minutes. This may crack the 
shell enough to break the nut 
apart, but if more help is 
needed, tap the shell with a 
hammer. (Throwing the 
coconut onto a cement floor 
also does the trick.) Remove 
the husk and pare the brown 
coating from the meat. 

D. Grate the coconut meat 
finely or cut it into small 
pieces and shred in a blender 
or processor. Collect in a 
bowl. 

E. Pour 1 cup boiling water 
over the grated coconut. Let 
stand 20 minutes. Strain 
through a cloth or fine sieve, 
squeezing or pressing to ex- 
tract all the liquid and flavor. 
Add this liquid to the re- 
served natural milk. 

F. Return grated meat to the 
bowl and pour another cup 
of boiling water over it. Let 
stand another 20 minutes and 
squeeze or press in a cloth 
or sieve as before. Add re- 
sultant liquid to the other, 
reserved liquid. Discard 
grated meat. (You can sub- 
stitute cups of prepared 
grated coconut, but the yield 
will be somewhat smaller. 
One frest coconut should 
yield about 2 cups of milk.) 

2. Mix coconut milk with all other 
ingredients and let soak for 
about 5 minutes. 

3. Set over moderate heat for 6 to 
8 minutes, stirring constantly. 

4. Pour into a bowl or serving 
J dishes. 

5. Eat hot with cow&apos;s milk for 
breakfast or chill for dessert. 

Yield: 2 to 3 servings

Trekking in the Amazon Forest 

Text and photographs by Dennis Werner 



Laden with possessions and 
produce, Brazil&apos;s Mekranoti 
Indians spend much of the 
year traveling en masse 
through the jungle 

Full of thorny palms, stinging 
ants, scorpions, and poisonous cat- 
erpillars, the Amazon forest of the 
southern part of the Brazilian state 
of Para seems less than inviting to 
most travelers. Yet the Northern 
Kayapo Indians who inhabit this 
region spend a considerable amount 
of time wandering about in the for- 
est. Not only is the forest cool, since 
the sun rarely penetrates the thick 
canopy of broad leaves and hang- 
ing lianas, but materials for baskets 
and ropes are never more than 
twenty feet away, and food, mostly 
animal, is also available. 

Local game consists mainly of 
small animals — macaws, armadil- 
los, pacas (a species of large ro- 
dent), and monkeys. On very rare 
occasions hunters come across a 
herd of peccaries or a fat tapir. Al- 
though not as plentiful as the 
Indians would like, the local fauna 
has so far been adequate. For the 
Indians, the Amazon is neither a 
hell nor a paradise. 

In the forests to the west of the 
Iriri River lies a community of 
about three hundred Northern 
Kayapo Indians, called the Mekra- 
noti. Their village is built in a circle 
of square, thatched houses — one- 
room for the most part — surround- 
ing a clearing of hard clay. In the 
middle of this plaza is the men&apos;s 
house, which serves as a meeting 
place, a factory for manufacturing 
weapons or ceremonial gear, a 
social club, and a transient hotel for 
bachelors or married men whose 
wives have just given birth. 

At least two or three times a 



year, at irregular intervals, the 
Mekranoti pack up their posses- 
sions, their pet birds and dogs, and 
their children, and leave their vil- 
lage en masse. Heavily weighed 
down with pots, guns, infants, and 
baskets of food, they spend the 
next three weeks to three months 
wandering about the tropical forest. 
Almost every day the entire group 
abandons its day-old camp and 
moves to a new location, often only 
a half-hour&apos;s walk away. 

This behavior is not unusual 
among hunters and gatherers, so- 
cieties that bring collected foods 
into camp every day and thus avoid 
storing or carrying large quantities 
of comestibles. The Mekranoti, 
however, are not hunters and gath- 
erers but swidden agriculturists. 
When they depart on trek, they 
carry huge bundles of cultivated 
manioc root and manioc flour, 
sweet potatoes, and bananas, often 
making return trips to village and 
forest gardens to replenish dwin- 
dling supplies. While on trek, the 
Mekranoti gather and eat a great 
variety of wild fruits and tubers, 
but they probably have never man- 
aged to survive on wild foods alone. 

Today, even though the Indians 
can wander in a huge tract of forest, 
abounding in diverse and often un- 
classified flora, they consume only 
a few wild products in any quan- 
tity — Brazil nuts available year- 
round, tubers found in mountain- 
ous areas in the dry summer months 
from June through August, and 
agai. a rainy season palm berry. 
But these products cannot provide 
the essential calories that only gar- 
den staples can supply. Yet despite 
this lack of wild vegetable foods, 
the Mekranoti often go on long trips 
lasting several months, requiring 
them to haul heavy loads of garden 
produce. 



While greater contact with con- 
temporary Brazil may eventually 
destroy Mekranoti trekking pat- 
terns, the practice is still quite 
strong. Although even the oldest 
Indian cannot remember a day 
when he did without Western 
goods, the village&apos;s first peaceful 
contact with modern civilization 
occurred only in 1954. Previously, 
the Mekranoti raided other Indian 
and Brazilian settlements for guns, 
pots, and chickens. Fighting con- 
tinued for years after 1954, and as 
recently as 1967, the Mekranoti 
were still raiding their traditional 
enemies, the Kreen Akrore. 

Since 1966, the almost continu- 
ous presence of missionaries or 
government personnel in the Mek- 
ranoti village seems to have damp- 
ened the group&apos;s bellicosity. Never- 
theless, they are still a long way 
from integration into contemporary 
Brazilian society. Only one Indian 
speaks any Portuguese, none can 
handle money well, and most have 
a great deal of difficulty counting 
above six. The group&apos;s traditional 
social structure, ceremonies, and 
means of subsistence, including 
trekking, are still very much alive. 

The Mekranoti have not yet 
clashed with Brazil&apos;s development 
of the Amazon Basin and continue 
to enjoy unhindered and exclusive 
access to the vast area of tropical 



Most treks are part of 

ceremonies that end in 

elaborate festivities when 

the Mekranoti return to their 

village. At right, a child

forest that they have been calling 
home for the past twenty years. 
They have limited their recent trek- 
king activities to the confines of 
this region although there is no 
apparent pressure to do so. 

Before 1954, their raiding activ- 
ities took them much farther afield 
than they now need to go. In 1947, 
one party traveled as far east as the 
Araguaia River to attack the Tapi- 
rape Indians, while another section 
wandered westward to the Tapajos 
River — a distance of almost 500 
miles. During these lengthy trips 
the Indians subsisted on garden 
produce stolen from other Indian or 
Brazilian settlements. 

But today, FUNAI (the Brazilian 



Indian Foundation) gives them 
Western products in exchange for 
artifacts and Brazil nuts collected 
by the younger men on special ex- 
peditions. Since the Mekranoti no 
longer need to rob their neighbors, 
they have settled down to some 
extent, breaking the monotony of 
daily routine with what they prob- 
ably consider trips around the 
corner. 

The Mekranoti go off on trek 
during both the wet season and the 
short dry season. During the year 
I recently spent with these Indians 
there was not a drop of rain from 
June 17 until August 17. The small 
tributary that supplied the village 
with drinking and bathing water 



dried up into a stagnant pool. When 
the rains do come, they are torren- 
tial, flooding large areas of the land 
around the village for much of the 
year. 

Gardens must be burned and 
planted just before the rainy season 
begins about September. A few 
crops, notably corn, ripen early, 
but are quickly exhausted. The 
period of greatest productivity be- 
gins with the following dry season, 
when the Kayapo staples — manioc, 
bananas, and sweet potatoes — be- 
gin to dominate the gardens&apos; three- 
or four-year life span. 

Although the Mekranoti can 
choose from a greater variety of 
foods during the wet season, they 



44 




feel that they eat better during the 
dry season when their most-prized 
food — sweet potato — matures. 
Also, because the small game in the 
region is both easier to find and 
easier to approach during this sea- 
son, hunters are significantly more 
likely at this time to return from a 
hunt with meat to feed their fam- 
ilies. The easiest method of hunt- 
ing — using modern flashlights to 
find game at night — ^works only 
during the dry season. Finally, 
abundant fishing catches are pos- 
sible only when the streams are low 
and Indians can poison fish by beat- 
ing timbo vines in the water. For all 
these reasons the Indians call the 
dry season tiniex kciin, literally, the 



&quot;good time,&quot; as opposed to na 
kum, the &quot;rainy time.&quot; 

On treks during the wet season, 
the Mekranoti&apos;s daily movements 
between campsites are shorter. The 
Indians have more trouble making 
paths and walking through flooded 
land and must construct lean-tos as 
protection from the rain. In the dry 
season the distances between en- 
campments are greater, but walk- 
ing is easier, and the Indians are 
content to spend the night without 
shelter, sleeping on leaves scat- 
tered on the ground. 

The Kayapo also organize diflfer- 
ent kinds of treks for diiFerent pur- 
poses, distinguishing above all 
between ceremonial and noncere-

monial expeditions. Most Kayapo 
festivals involve a series of events 
lasting several months and are 
sponsored by parents who want to 
bestow special names on their chil- 
dren aged five to twelve. After the 
sponsoring relatives and the village 
chief decide on a ceremony, and 
the requisite masks — if any — are 
made, relatively low-keyed activi- 
ties go on for a month or two. 
Village members take part in 
masked dances, early morning and 
evening sings, and occasional ritual 
processions — the three signs that a 
ceremony is in progress. A festi- 
val&apos;s close, however, calls for a 
day-long spectacle. 

To feed all participants, the Mek- 
ranoti require a large supply of 
tortoises, for which they must go 



out on trek. And so, for about a 
month before the end of a Kayapo 
ceremony, the village empties out 
while everyone goes to the forest to 
gather and rack up as many tor- 
toises as possible. 

A typical day during a ceremo- 
nial trek starts about four in the 
morning when the men go to the 
camp men&apos;s house to begin their 
singing. Kayapo songs consist of 
heavily accented, regular rhythms, 
usually accompanied by rocking 
motions and ending with the Ka- 
yapo cadence, a sighing, semi- 
voiced, downward slide. The men 
sing in deep voices with occasional 
falsetto barks scattered haphaz- 
ardly throughout the melodic line. 

As the first patches of dawn 
appear through the forest canopy. 




Above: In camp, a woman prepares 

a meat pie from grated manioc 

and game. Right: When camping 

during the dry season, families 

sleep on leaves in the open air. 



the morning sing comes to a close. 
Usually the men calculate the start 
of sings fairly accurately by ob- 
serving the night sky, but when the 
moon is too new, singing may be- 
gin as early as one-thirty or as late 
as five-thirty. A sing ends with a 
series of yelps and exhortations 
addressed to men who have failed 
to appear that morning, such as, 
&quot;Wake up! Do you want the Kreen 
Akrore to attack you in your 
sleep?&quot; The men return to their 
respective families for a morning 
meal of cold sweet potatoes or 
other leftovers from the previous 
evening. Packing begins shortly 
thereafter and most people have 
abandoned their temporary homes 
by seven or seven-thirty. 

Occasionally there is some con- 



48 




fused argument over the site of a 
new camp, but construction usually 
begins with little delay. A camp 
consists of two or more long lean- 
tos that face each other. The men 
often help put up the basic frame, 
but construction generally falls to 
the women, who spend the next 
three or four hours gathering wild 
banana and palm leaves to finish 
the shelters. 

By noon most of the structures 
are up and some women have al- 
ready left their children with rela- 
tives while they chop wood for the 
large communal oven or for the 
small household fires that keep 
people warm at night. A few women 
gather Qf a; berries or wild bananas. 
Many busily make repeated trips to 
the previous day&apos;s encampment to 



fetch the garden supplies to feed 
the traveling village. Still other 
women lounge idly on their sleep- 
ing mats or calmly paint one of their 
children in delicate striped-line de- 
signs, the body decoration for 
which the Kayapo are famous. This 
routine continues for the afternoon, 
broken occasionally by a chilling 
Mekranoti wail, provoked by 
events ranging from an old wo- 
man&apos;s remembrances of things past 
to a fatal machete accident. Often 
such a wail welcomes back a young 
man who, having lost his way in the 
forest the previous day, has just 
returned to camp. 

While the women build the 
houses, most of the men take off 
individually for the forest and a 
long day of hunting. A few younger 



men clear paths on which the fam- 
ilies must travel, and some elders 
help transport garden produce or 
butcher game as the hunters return 
one by one. A successful hunter 
may return early, give his catch to 
the ceremonial sponsor, and relax 
for the rest of the day. Unlucky 
hunters are apt to return just before 
dusk. 

After a bite to eat at home, the 
men like to congregate for an eve- 
ning&apos;s gossip or singing in the men&apos;s 
house. While the ceremonial spon- 
sor provides food for the male as- 
semblage, some of the younger 
men rack up the tortoises brought 
in that day. In the men&apos;s house, 
stories of the day&apos;s hunting, tales of 
past military adventures, deals 
with FUNAI officials, and even 





arguments about inflation of the 
Brazilian cruzeirocontinue well into 
the night. 

At night back in the village, re- 
spected Kayapo elders customar- 
ily saunter about the central plaza, 
telling stories and lecturing people 
to be good to each other. On trek 
some of the less prestigious elders 
try their hand at this traditional 
oratory. Sometimes they are 
laughed down, but they may gain 
enough respect to continue their 
haranguing in the main village. The 
men seated in the men&apos;s house 
often seem to ignore the elders&quot; 
preaching, but occasional com- 
ments and questions reveal the 
audience&apos;s attentiveness. Later, 



loud hoots from the men&apos;s house 
signal the breakup of the meeting 
and the end of the day. 

While this pattern of ceremonial 
trekking is still most common, the 
Mekranoti recently have begun to 
alter their wandering strategies. 
More frequently, only the men go 
out to collect tortoises. Women are 
reluctant to expose their children 
to the dangers of the forest and to 
abandon the medical services that 
a resident FUNAI nurse offers. 
The men also seem somewhat re- 
luctant to go on trek. Many of them 
attempt to excuse themselves by 
complaining of sickness and in- 
juries, but eventually they find 
themselves cajoled into joining an 



expedition. When only the men go 
out looking for tortoises they may 
divide themselves into their men&apos;s 
societies — the Mekranoti village 
has two such civic political frater- 
nities — and take off in two direc- 
tions. If the women and children do 
not accompany them, the men 
travel much faster and are certain 
to return sooner. 

But regardless of who does the 
trekking, the last few days of a 
Kayapo ceremony remain the 
same. As the women and children 
go on ahead to the main village, the 
men stay in the forest to paint their 
bodies and prepare the racks of tor- 
toises for a grand procession into 
the central plaza. After delivering 



■ 



.so 




this heavy cargo to the ceremonial 
sponsors, the men proceed to the 
men&apos;s house or to their own homes 
where the long process of body 
decoration begins. Having bathed, 
everyone in the village is first 
painted with black, long-lasting, 
genipap dye. Red urucii mixed with 
palm nut oil follows, giving the In- 
dians&quot; skin an attractive sheen. 

After these initial preparations, 
Indians who have inherited the 
privilege add ornaments — eggshells 
or feathers glued on the body, intri- 
cate headdresses, necklaces or 
bracelets. Once decorated, the 
Mekranoti spend most of the final 
days of a ceremony showing off 
their finery in periodic processions 



around the men&apos;s house. Usually, 
an exhausting all-night parade 
around the village — complete with 
singing, the rhythm of rattles, and 
stomping dances — brings the cere- 
mony to a dramatic close. 

Although most treks are cere- 
monial, the Mekranoti, who spend 
about a quarter of their time out on 
trek, also take to the forest for 
other reasons. Usually they cite 
some locally unavailable, but es- 
sential, item as a reason for a non- 
ceremonial trek, but there are other 
excuses, such as friendly visits to 
relatives in neighboring commu- 
nities, which may be as far as 150 
miles away. Generally, the daily 
routine of these treks resembles 



that of the ceremonial journeys. 
The most important distinction 
between the two types of treks has 
to do with community relations. 
Normally, when in the village, mar- 
ried men live with their wives&apos; ex- 
tended families. When out on non- 
ceremonial treks, a man will travel 
with this same set of relatives. On 
ceremonial treks, however, people 
sleep next to a very different group. 
The night before such treks, the 
male sponsors, of whom there is 
always more than one, go to the 
men&apos;s house and call upon their 
male relatives, both real and Active 
(through choice or inheritance), to 
help them collect the tortoises 
needed to climax the ceremonies.

The process looks very much like 
a choosing up of softball teams. 
Husbands are accompanied by 
their wives and children. Since 
everyone has a different set of Ac- 
tive kinsmen, every ceremonial 
trek puts families together differ- 
ently — a novel way for tribesmen 
to become better acquainted with 
their fellows. 

While I was in the village, about 
half the population took off on a 
three-month trek in search of palm 
nuts for hair oil, while the other half 
spent a few weeks traveling to a 
larger river to fish. Another trek 
fetched a kind of resin that the 
women needed to paint designs on 
children&apos;s shaved heads. All of 



these expeditions lasted at least 
several weeks, but there were also 
shorter trips away from the village. 
Individual families often took off 
for a few days to get meat. Several 
times, the men left the village to 
collect masking materials or to 
chase herds of peccaries. These 
shorter trips were not like treks 
because they did not involve carry- 
ing garden produce. But the longer 
excursions were every bit as diffi- 
cult as the ceremonial treks. 

Since the Mekranoti so willingly 
expend great energy carrying 
around garden produce, trekking 
must provide benefits greater than 
a few bottles of hair oil. Recently, 
some anthropologists have argued 



that trekking, where it occurs, is a 
response to meager sources of pro- 
tein. Although the Amazon River 
and some of its major tributaries 
are renowned for their generous 
stocks of fish and the richness of 
the surrounding wildlife, this great 
natural wealth is not found in the 
remote areas of the Amazon Basin 
away from the fertile flood plains of 
the major rivers. 

Where the Mekranoti live, fish 
and game are relatively scarce, and 
garden products — sweet potato, 
banana, manioc — are notoriously 
low in vegetable proteins. While 
they are a good source of some 
proteins, Brazil nuts alone, or in 
combination with starchy produce.

TTT r &apos;;&apos;!n!:^ &apos;! TTi, !%.&apos;&gt;V&gt;/ 



cannot supply the Mekranoti with 
the proteins that only animal 
sources can provide. The Kayapo 
must roam over great distances to 
capture game to satisfy their basic 
dietary requirements. Trekking is 
necessary, regardless of the work 
required. 

While in the village, Indians eat 
meat about six out of ten days, but 
on trek this average climbs to about 
nine out of ten. This difference is 
due largely to the greater amount 
of time hunters on trek spend 
searching for game. When living at 
home, men hunt about nine hours 
a week, but out in the forest this 
average soars to twenty-eight hours 
a week. Hunters bring back game 
on about half the days they go out. 



This figure remains the same on 
trek and at home, even though 
competition over a day&apos;s hunting 
territory is much greater while on 
trek. And so considerably more 
meat is captured and consumed 
while traveling out in the forest. 
Thus far, this procurement strategy 
has protected the Mekranoti from 
protein deficiencies, but their nu- 
tritional future may depend on con- 
tinuing freedom to wander over 
large tracts of land. 

Although protein plays an impor- 
tant role in the origin of Mekranoti 
trekking, it cannot explain why 
these Indians did not try to reach 
game in easier ways. They could 
have simply spread out, planting 
gardens and building houses 



53 



n 




throughout the jungle. Then each 
family could live off the resources 
of its own local territory. But the 
Kayapo prefer to live in large vil- 
lages where trekking is the only 
way to reach scattered wildlife. 

Perhaps the desire to stick to- 
gether comes from the tradition of 
Kayapo warfare. The Mekranoti 
explain the raids they carried on 
before 1967 as a means of revenge, 
looting, or kidnapping. (One old 
Brazilian man, a middle-aged Tapi- 
rape woman, and three young 
Kreen Akrore who were kidnapped 
as youngsters still live in the Mek- 
ranoti village.) Although the Mekra- 
noti have calmed down in the last 



ten years, they are periodically sub- 
ject to fears that some day the 
Kreen Akrore will return to avenge 
the 1967 raid. 

In the past, when such fears were 
stronger, the village often moved to 
a more distant, safer location. This 
terror of enemy retaliation ac- 
counts for the Kayapo desire to 
congregate in large villages rather 
than dispersed residences. Fear 
may also have been responsible for 
the Mekranoti&apos;s former reluctance 
to send only men out on treks, 
leaving the women defenseless. As 
cooperation replaces violence be- 
tween Kayapo and other peoples, 
trekking habits may give way to 



other adaptations to the tropical 
environment. 

Although protein scarcity and 
warfare may account for Kayapo 
trekking, they do not explain why 
the Mekranoti remain together 
when they trek, while their rela- 
tives in the savanna regions of cen- 
tral Brazil break up into smaller 
groups at these times. Mekranoti 
men on trek must compete for hunt- 
ing territories, while savannagroups 
send hunters off in different direc- 
tions. The Mekranoti have failed to 
adopt this easier method because 
they are unable to use the small 
local streams, which are choked 
with water plants and dead trees; 
thus, they are obliged to travel over- 
land. Anyone who has waded for 
hours through knee- to waist-high 
waters can appreciate the work re- 
quired to hack a path through low- 
land tropical forest. Since the Mek- 
ranoti spend almost two hours a day 
transporting bundles alone, a good 
path is of utmost importance. By 
traveling together, the Mekranoti 
can save time cutting trails. Al- 
though the Mekranoti have to keep 
hunters in the same area, this dis- 
advantage is easily offset by the 
work saved on path making. 

Three factors — protein scarcity, 
warfare, and difficulty of transpor- 
tation — have dictated the Mekra- 
noti style of trekking. Today, game 
is still dispersed and the making of 
paths is as difficult as ever, but 
warfare has disappeared. Now, 
before organizing an excursion, the 
Indians take into consideration 
such new factors as government- 
sponsored medical services and the 
sale of Brazil nuts to FUNAI. Nev- 
ertheless, as long as treks provide 
basic needs, the Mekranoti will 
keep traveling. D

Beware: Nonpoisonous Snakes 



by Sherman A. Minton, Jr. 



Many species formerly 
thought harmless to 
humans are inflicting 
some nasty bites 

During the summer of 1957, I 
collected a slender, three-foot-long 
green snake near a rural hospital in 
Costa Rica. On my return to the 
United States, I gave the snake to a 
friend, also a physician-herpetolo- 
gist. A few nights later 1 received a 
phone call from him. 

&quot;About that snake you gave me, 
are you sure it&apos;s harmless?&quot; 

&quot;Well, I&apos;m sure of the identifica- 
tion, and all the books say so.&quot; 

&quot;I&apos;m glad to hear that because it 
bit me a few minutes ago, and my 
hand&apos;s beginning to swell.&quot; 

Unable to think of any sensible 
plan of action, we did nothing. In a 
few hours the swollen hand re- 
turned to normal, leaving us re- 
lieved but puzzled. 

The snake was Leptophis alicie- 
tiilla, a member of a well-known 
genus of tropical American tree 
snakes sometimes called parrot 
snakes. They are classified as 
aglyphous colubrids, a loose, 
hodgepodge grouping of snakes 
whose teeth are not grooved or 
otherwise modified for injecting 
venom. The scientific world has al- 
ways considered snakes of this type 
harmless to humans. 

There is a growing body of evi- 
dence, however, that this is not al- 
ways so. In 1960 the late Arthur N. 
Bragg, a herpetologist best known 
for his studies on spadefoot toads, 
reported pain and swelling of his 
hand, lasting several days, after he 
had been bitten by a western hog- 
nose snake. In 1973 a sixteen-year- 
old boy had similar symptoms after 
being bitten by an eastern hognose 
snake. Hognose snakes are con- 
sidered not only harmless but also 
exceptionally inoffensive; Bragg 
therefore believed the bite was a 
feeding rather than a defensive 
response, since he had been han- 



56 



dling frogs just before he was bitten. 

In 1954 and 1966, West Indian 
racers were incriminated in cases 
of envenomation (fang punctures, 
with local or general signs of venom 
having been injected), one of them 
accompanied by swelling that 
spread to the entire arm. During 
this period, there was also a report 
of mild envenomation by Ahaetulla 
papuae, an arboreal snake of New 
Guinea, and another of a venomous 
bite by a parrot snake from western 
Mexico. These colubrids had all 
been considered harmless. 

The most serious cases of poison- 
ing by a colubrid have been caused 
by a plentiful and familiar snake of 
the Far East, Rhabdophis tigriniis. 
In some regions of Japan, large 
numbers of this snake, known as 
yamakagashi, are used for food. 

My first intimation of this snake&apos;s 
venomous nature came from a re- 
port sent me in 1969 by a California 
physician. His patient, an amateur 
snake keeper, had been bitten on 
the finger while offering food to a 
captive snake. Within a few min- 
utes his finger swelled and he de- 
veloped a severe headache. Later, 
his gums began to bleed; bleeding 
from a small razor cut could not be 
stopped; he had pain over his kid- 
neys; and there was blood in his 
urine. These alarming symptoms 
subsided about forty-eight hours 
later. In my reply to the physician, 
I wrote, &quot;The case report ... is 
downright spooky. Assuming the 
facts, including the identification of 
the snake, are correct, it is unique 
and very hard to explain. It is the 



Common to much of North 

America, the garter snake is 

considered to be innocuous. 

But a California youngster

bitten b\ one. 



most severe case I know of apparent 
envenomation by a colubrid without 
rear fangs.&quot; 

A few years later, herpetologists 
M. B. Mittleman and R. C. Goris 
reported two serious cases of 
yamakagashi envenomation from 
their own experience, plus a third 
case reported in 1932 in a provin- 
cial Japanese medical journal. The 
most striking features of these cases 
were the loss of the normal clotting 




i 



power of the blood and resultant 
hemorrhages. The patients re- 
covered, but their illness was as 
severe as that caused in many cases 
by the bites of rattlesnakes and 
other unquestionably venomous 
species. Japanese workers have re- 
cently reported other severe yama- 
kagashi bites and are generally cau- 
tious in handling the snake. 

Meanwhile, reports of poisoning 
by other presumably nonvenomous 



colubrid snakes continue to come 
in. A Russian herpetologist has 
reported two cases of envenoma- 
tion by a mountain racer, Coluber 
ravergieri, a widely distributed 
snake of western Asia and the 
Middle East. A few years ago I was 
called by a herpetologist who was 
having severe pain and swelling fol- 
lowing the bite of a large South 
American snake sometimes known 
as cobra de Paraguay. In 1975 



newspapers throughout the nation 
carried accounts of a California 
youngster who had been hospital- 
ized following the bite of a garter 
snake. I talked with one of the 
physicians involved in the care of 
this patient, and we agreed that 
envenomation was the most likely 
explanation for the symptoms ob- 
served. 

In all these cases, the question 
must be asked, Is this truly a case

of venom poisoning? Infection is 
possible in any wound where the 
skin is broken, but in these cases 
symptoms developed much too 
quickly for bacteria or fungi to 
have multiplied and caused disease. 
Bragg proposed, and then refuted, 
the idea that his symptoms might 
have arisen from amphibian skin 
toxins that were on his hands or on 
the snake&apos;s teeth. Because most of 
the persons who have had appar- 
ently venomous bites by nonven- 
omous snakes have been herpetol- 
ogists or others who have been re- 
peatedly bitten by snakes, there is 
the possibility that some sort of 
allergy to snake saliva is involved. 
In some instances this could explain 
a few of the symptoms; but others, 



especially hemorrhages and non- 
clotting blood, are not usually mani- 
festations of an allergic reaction. 
The most logical hypothesis that re- 
mains is that bites of a variety of 
snakes traditionally considered 
nonvenomous may be followed in 
certain cases by symptoms of 
venom poisoning. 

The realization that it is no longer 
possible to make a clear-cut distinc- 
tion between venomous and non- 
venomous snakes is a matter of 
practical concern for those who 
work with snakes and those who 
must diagnose and treat snake 
bites. A fundamental question of 
the evolution of venom in snakes is 
also raised. 

Although many snakes do engulf 



small prey alive, their success as 
limbless reptiles depends to no 
small degree on their ability to 
attack and subdue larger animals. 
To do so, they have evolved two 
basic methods — constriction and 
injection of venom. Constriction is 
presumably the phylogenetically 
older method since it is used by the 
primitive boas and pythons, and no 
evidence of venom has been found 
in this group of snakes. 

An alternative to constriction is 
the evolution of highly toxic oral 
secretions and an eflfective mech- 
anism for injecting them. Hollow or 
deeply grooved fangs and special- 
ized venom glands have evolved in 
three lines of snakes: one com- 
prises the widely distributed vipers

and pit vipers with long and highly 
movable fangs; a second includes 
the cobras, mambas, coral snakes, 
and sea snakes with generally 
shorter, less movable fangs; and a 
third, small group is made up of the 
mole vipers whose long fangs are 
used one at a time in a stabbing 
manner. There is no question as to 
the venomous nature of these 
snakes, although by no means are 
all dangerous to humans. 

This leaves some 1,400 species of 
snakes of the group known as colu- 
brids in which venom apparatus of 
varying degrees have developed. In 
some of these snakes, one or more 
pairs of grooved teeth in the rear 
of the upper jaw are associated with 
a well-developed venom gland. A 
few of these snakes are unquestion- 
ably dangerous; indeed, two 
eminent herpetologists are among 
their victims. In 1957 the bite of a 
boomslang, an African tree snake, 
killed Karl P. Schmidt of Chicago&apos;s 
Field Museum, and in 1975 Robert 
Mertens of the Senckenberg 
Museum in Frankfurt am Main, 



Unquestionably dangerous, the 
green mamba, left, has movable 
fangs that are modified for 
the injection of a highly toxic 
venom. The parrot snake, below, 
is not similarly equipped, 
so this tree-dwelling coliibrid of the 
American tropics had been thought 
harmless to humans. No more. 



West Germany, died from the bite 
of another African tree snake, the 
twig snake. 

Other species with this sort of 
venom apparatus, such as the 
mangrove snake. Natal black 
snake, culebra de cola corta, and 
mboi-obi, have inflicted venomous 
but nonlethal bites on humans. 
Most other colubrid species have a 
clear record, although some are re- 
garded with suspicion since their 
venom is quite eifective in killing 
prey. 

Enlargement of teeth in the rear 
of the upper jaw without the pres- 
ence of venom-conducting grooves 
is characteristic of many colubrid 
snakes. Among species that have 
teeth of this sort are the hognose 
snakes, the parrot snakes, the 
yamakagashi, and the West Indian 
racers. Other colubrids, such as the 
African house snakes and south 
Asian wolf snakes, have enlarged 
but ungrooved teeth in the front of 
the upper jaw; still others, such as 
the North American rat snakes and 
king snakes, have teeth of fairly uni- 
form size. The feeding habits of 
snakes suggest that long teeth in 
the front of the upper jaw may be 
an advantage in capturing feathered 
or scaly prey such as small birds 
and lizards; long teeth in the rear of 
the jaw are better for holding less 
agile but more tenacious prey such 
as amphibians or other snakes. 

Most of the venom in colubrid 
snakes seems to be secreted by 
Duvernoy&apos;s gland, located in the 
upper lip or at the angle of the 
mouth. This gland was found in 163 




Paul A Benson; Animals, Animals 



of 180 species examined in a study 
by Aaron Taub; however, there was 
considerable variation in its size 
and structure even among closely 
related species. Very little is known 
of the chemistry of colubrid 
venoms. Some are known to con- 
tain enzymes, such as phospholip- 
ase A and arginine esterase, that are 
common in the venom of poisonous 
snakes. Boomslang venom inter- 
feres with blood clotting and causes 
hemorrhaging by much the same 
mechanism as many viper venoms. 
Saliva of the yamakagashi seems to 
have the same effect. Saliva of the 
West Indian racers has the proper- 
ties of weak viper venoms. 

My studies on boomslang venom 
indicate the presence of at least five 
protein components, some of which 
are in the venom of many pit vipers. 
A neurotoxin similar in action to 
the a-bungarotoxin in the venom of 
the krait (a highly poisonous elapid) 
has been reported in the venom of 
Blanding&apos;s tree snake (a colubrid). 
While the biochemical evidence is 
ambiguous, the typical signs of 
colubrid poisoning in man — pain, 
swelling, and hemorrhages — are 
more like the symptoms of viper 
bites. 

A baffling aspect of colubrid 
poisoning is the lack of close re- 
lationships among the incriminated 
species. The snakes come from 
every continent except Australia, 
which has few colubrids. The two 
most dangerous species, the boom- 
slang and the twig snake, are 
African tree snakes that some au- 
thorities consider closely related, 
but their presumed Asian relatives, 
tree snakes of the genus Dryophis, 
have never been reliably identified 
as causing human injury. 

The yamakagashi belongs to the 
group of natricine snakes that are 
the dominant snakes of the North- 
ern Hemisphere (except in highly 
arid regions). Until quite recently, it 
was included in the genus Matrix, 
along with such familiar and wide- 
spread species as the banded water 
snakes of eastern North America, 
the European grass snake, and the 
checkered keelback, or paddy 
snake, of southern Asia. The North 
American garter snakes are also 
close relatives. Many of these 
snakes bite readily if disturbed, yet 



59 



only the yamakagashi has caused 
serious poisoning. The California 
garter snake bite case, however, 
indicates that some other species 
may be venomous to an extent. 
There are also some bits of evi- 
dence, morphological and bio- 
chemical, that hognose snakes are 
somewhere on the evolutionary line 
that produced the vipers. Venom- 
ous saliva has apparently evolved in 
several lines of colubrid snakes. 

Prior to about 1950, there were 
very few reports of colubrid en- 
venomations in the medical or her- 
petological literature. Since then 
they have been increasing steadily. 
I attribute this, first, to the great 



increase in the number of persons 
who keep and handle snakes as part 
of their professions or avocations. 
Nearly every reported case of col- 
ubrid envenomation has involved 
handling a snake in captivity or 
catching it by hand in the field. With 
the possible exception of the 
boomslang, colubrids must hold on 
an appreciable time (several sec- 
onds) in order to inject venom. The 
sort of quick defensive bite inflicted 
by a snake that is accidently stepped 
on or brushed against would not 
result in envenomation. Also inter- 
esting is that in at least a couple of 
serious colubrid bites, the snake 
was being offered food. Perhaps a 




bite stimulated by the presence of 
food is more likely to cause venom 
injection than one stimulated by 
fright or anger. 

Another factor is the increasing 
availability of exotic snakes in the 
United States and Europe. A ma- 
jority of colubrid bites have been 
caused by tropical species that 
were not generally available, par- 
ticularly to amateurs, until fairly 
recently. 

Although most of these bites in- 
volve nothing worse than a few 
hours of discomfort and some anxi- 
ety, the potential for serious 
trouble exists with a few known 
species, and the list is probably not 
complete. Medical advice should be 
obtained whenever a person de- 
velops unexpected symptoms after 
being bitten by a supposedly non- 
venomous snake. A physician can 
discover evidence of internal hem- 
orrhage, abnormal blood clotting, 
and other warnings of severe poi- 
soning and take measures to coun- 
teract them. Nevertheless, treat- 
ment of severe bites remains far 
from satisfactory. No antiserum is 
available for most colubrid snakes, 
and significant cross-protection 
with antivenins for pit vipers and 
other unrelated snakes is doubtful. 

The first snake I ever saw was a 
garter snake my father killed near 
the small southern Indiana town 
where I grew up. My father be- 
longed to a generation that killed 
all snakes on the assumption that 
even if they were not poisonous, 
they could not be distinguished 
from kinds that were. I don&apos;t advo- 
cate a return to that attitude, but I 
would suggest a little more caution 
in handling reputedly harmless 
snakes. □

Where &quot;Mabel&quot; May Mean &quot;Sea Bass&quot; 



by Jack Stuster 
photographs by Stephen Frisch 



Some West Coast fishermen 
form offshore radio networks 
to share encoded information 
about fishing conditions 

Always in a vulnerable economic 
position, independent commercial 
fishermen on the West Coast of the 
United States frequently modify 
their traditional values of competi- 
tion, individualism, and self- 
reliance when they are at sea. Many 
form cooperative networks to share 
information about fishing condi- 
tions. These alliances take several 
different forms, and the type of 
fishing that crews do and the tech- 
nologies that are available tend to 
affect the amount and type of coop- 
eration. Not all fishermen who try 
to acquire information about fish- 
ing grounds do so with great 
success. Yet many of the more 
successful crews find up to one-half 
of their total catch on the basis of 
information transmitted by radio, 
either from intercepted or deci- 
phered calls or from calls by fellow 
members of organized groups. 

The fishermen least likely to 
share information at sea are those 
who catch fish in stationary gill nets 
or with set lines, or who trap crabs 
and lobsters. Although the territo- 
riality and the suspicion of the New 
England lobstermen are not dupli- 
cated by West Coast trappers, 
competition for fish and for bait is 
equally severe. Each season has its

Cruz Island. Right, a fisherman

for communication offshore. 



quota of accusations — often justi- 
fied — of stealing from traps. The 
proliferation of &quot;trap barons,&quot; 
fishermen with as many as 500 
traps, contributes to the rancor. 

California&apos;s trapper fishermen 
work alone. Although some fisher- 
men may hunt down concentrations 
of bottom fish in drag boats (called 
trawlers on the East Coast), most 
skippers tend to minimize their risks 
by fishing over relatively smooth, 
sandy bottoms rather than dragging 
their nets over potentially more 
productive, yet gear-destructive, 
rock piles. They match this conser- 
vatism in strategy with a minimum 
of talk about fishing conditions, 
both at sea and ashore, although 
skippers enjoy friendly conversa- 
tion over the radio or on the pier 
about nonbusiness matters. 

Trapper strategy fishermen take 
great care to preserve the secrecy 



of a &quot;hot spot,&quot; to the point of 
practicing deception. Asked why 
he is working the same area so 
persistently, a dragger skipper may 
answer that he is trawling for a lost 
net. When he lands a full load of 
fish the next day, he may excuse 
himself by claiming an exception- 
ally lucky tow over a ground well 
known to all crews. Trappers may 
talk vaguely of fishing &quot;up the 
coast&quot; and &quot;down the coast&quot; if 
fishing is poor. They may give out 
misleading or, at best for their com- 
petitors, no information. A dragger 
that had been consistently landing 
large loads of sole was followed to 
its grounds by another vessel. 
When the crew of the first boat 
dropped nets into the water, the 
second crew quickly followed suit. 
For the next hour, the two draggers 
continued slowly on the same 
course until the lead boat quickly 



L 





retrieved its nets, which were just 
below the water&apos;s surface, and sped 
away. By the time the deceived 
crew had hauled in their gear from 
a depth of 400 fathoms, the lead 
dragger was beyond radar range 
and could not be traced. 

Lack of cooperation among these 
crews is both common and under- 
standable, since their primary con- 
cern is to protect the secrecy of rich 
grounds. Hunter strategy fisher- 
men, however, often have good 
reason to exchange information 
about fishing conditions on the 
water. These crews troll with nets 
or stalk with hooks or harpoons, 
literally hunting down migratory 
schooling fish, such as sea bass, 
salmon, albacore, and swordfish. 
These fish appear in coastal waters 
with limited regularity and pre- 
dictability over a period of time as 
short as a month and an area as 
large as several thousand miles. 
Since a boat can be in only one 
place at a time, a fisherman who 
shares information with other boats 
has an advantage over a crew that 
works independently. 



Trapper strategy fishermen tend 

to be more individualistic than 

hunters, rarely sharing information 

about fishing conditions. The 

trappers include shellfishermen. 

above, and gill netters. who 

set stationary nets, right. 




The recent development of ex- 
cellent electronic equipment has 
facilitated sharing of information at 
sea. Depending upon the scope of 
the fishing enterprise, a vessel may 
carry as many as eight radios and 
electronic navigation devices. 
These include single sideband, 
VHF, AM-band, and citizens&quot; band 
radios, as well as radio direction 
finder, depth sounder, Loran, and 
radar. Some boats also carry spare 
gear for each instrument. Speakers 
for the radios are located in the 
pilothouse and on deck so they may 
be monitored continuously by the 
skipper from all working stations. 

Use of this electronic equipment 



has allowed the development of 
three kinds of cooperative arrange- 
ments among West Coast hunter 
strategy fishermen. Two affiliation 
groups are formal: one, which 
fishermen call a &quot;code group,&quot;&quot; in- 
volves between two and twenty 
vessels, and the other, referred to 
as a &quot;running partnership,&quot;&quot; in- 
volves two vessels. The third group 
is an ad hoc communication rela- 
tionship between two vessels at 
sea. 

In a code group, about a dozen 
boats seem to be the optimum size 
for maximum solidarity and in- 
formation sharing. More boats, all 
converging on one &quot;spot offish,&quot; 



66 




could force a school to sound or 
scatter. Members may be distrib- 
uted over as mucii as 50,000 square 
miles of open sea. The primary 
purpose of the grouping is to share 
exclusive information concerning 
fishing conditions. A well-struc- 
tured, long-standing code group 
might include twelve medium-to- 
large albacore trollers from diflFer- 
ent ports. Their skippers, good 
friends over the radio, may not 
know each other face to face for 
several seasons. Boats have code 
names, such as &quot;Lord Nelson,&quot; 
&quot;Gramps,&quot; or &quot;Fish Wagon,&quot; and 
each skipper possesses a closely 
guarded glossary of the codes used 



in communications, including a 
schedule of hails, or calls, that could 
be made or expected. 

The members are obliged to 
share all information about their 
catches and fishing conditions, and 
they are expected to pass along in- 
formation obtained by monitoring 
the radio transmissions of vessels 
not members of the code group. 
Using nonmembers in this way 
allows the group to cover a wide 
area with no waste of time. Secrecy 
is all-important, and security meas- 
ures may include codes, scheduled 
calls on preselected radio channels, 
and the use of exotic radio fre- 
quencies, foreign languages, and 



scramblers, which garble a trans- 
mission for everyone except the 
intended receiver. 

The codes may take several 
forms. The message, &quot;Mabel wants 
you to go to an anniversary,&quot; might 
mean that sea bass (&quot;Mabel&quot;) are 
running off Point Conception (&quot;an 
anniversary&quot;). A group might mis- 
lead nongroup members by trans- 
mitting catch figures that are an 
agreed upon fraction of actual fig- 
ures. A message such as &quot;We&apos;re 
going to eat spaghetti tonight&quot; 
could indicate a successful catch. 
Italian- or Portuguese-speaking 
fishermen often use their language 
or a dialect, and foreign languages

are also spoken on shore both by 
fishermen and by fish buyers to 
hmit eavesdropping. Use of a for- 
eign language sometimes may be 
counterproductive. One particu- 
larly successful swordfish hunter, 
of whom it is said, &quot;He even con- 
siders the time of day to be a 
secret,&quot; rarely exchanges informa- 
tion with vessels other than those 
owned by his brothers and son. But 
other fishermen know that when 
he is speaking Portuguese on the 



68 



radio, chances are that he has found 
good fishing. A generation ago, the 
primary languages on the northern 
California fishing grounds were 
Italian and Portuguese, but these 
languages are now generally used 
to impose secrecy. Fewer sons of 
old-time fishermen are going to sea, 
and in recent years, recruits to 
West Coast fisheries have increas- 
ingly been the college-educated 
sons of English-speaking, middle- 
class families. 



The location of the transmitting 
vessel must be given if the informa- 
tion is to have any value to the 
receiving vessels. This position 
may be given circuitously, for 
example, &quot;I&apos;m 100 miles south of 
where I was three days ago when we 
talked&quot; or &quot;I&apos;m where we had those 
300-fish days two seasons ago.&quot; At 
times, the position is given in code, 
which might mislead crews not in 



Code groups, running partnerships, 
and ad hoc communication networks 
are important to swordfishermen, 
who must literally hunt down their 
prey, fish by fish. Knowing where 
fish are running greatly increases 
chances of a successful catch. 




the group. Other crews could at- 
tempt to locate the transmitting ves- 
sel by homing in on it with their 
radio direction finders, but an RDF 
cannot determine distance. Con- 
ceivably, two or three nonmembers 
could cooperate and take bearings 
from different known locations in 
order to get a fix on the transmitting 
boat. 

&quot;Running partners&quot; are two 
boats that usually hail from the 
same port, although vessels from 
diflFerent ports might rendezvous on 
their way to the grounds. These 
alliances typically are made on the 
basis of friendship, usually between 
fishermen of equal ability. The pri- 
mary goal is to share information 
on the whereabouts offish, but the 
running partnership is also useful 
as a safety measure when fishing 
oflFshore, especially when vessels 



/ 



are &quot;running&quot; between major con- 
centrations of fishing fleets. 

Unlike members of code groups, 
who come together briefly to fish 
runs, or &quot;hot spots,&quot; and then dis- 
perse to hunt for fish schools else- 
where, running partners tend to 
fish in proximity for an extended 
period of time. Some fishermen fish 
with the same partners for years at a 
time; others switch partners several 
times a season. Running partners 
are usually members of the same 
code group. 

A few hunting strategy fishermen 
prefer to fish alone either all or part 
of the time, and at sea they rarely 
communicate with other fishermen. 
Some may engage in offshore in- 
formation sharing that is not as well 
organized as that in code groups 
and running partnerships. I once 
overheard the following, unplanned 



converstion between two northern 
California salmon trollers. A fisher- 
man hailed a friend in Italian one 
evening and after giving his location 
and discussing personal matters, he 
said (still in Italian), &quot;We&apos;re getting 
ready to make some wine . The grapes 
are ripe and if you want to pick up 
some barrels, you&quot;d better get up 
here.&quot; 

Masked by the preceding trivia 
and by the reference to &quot;wine 
making&quot; was the valuable informa- 
tion that the speaker&apos;s crew had 
been catching a quantity of large 
salmon — since only the largest fish 
are split and packed in barrels by 
buyers to be processed into lox. 
Understanding the message, the 
second fisherman ran all night up 
the coast and caught more than 
$1,000 worth of salmon the next 
day. What the ad hoc aflRliates may 





lack in structure and continuity, 
they matte up in creativity and 
spontaneity. 

Actually, only a small percentage 
of the total volume of radio trans- 
mission between fishing vessels at 
sea contains valuable information. 
The successful fishermen are those 
who develop working, cooperative 
networks and who have a highly 
developed capacity to filter out 
significant information from the 
constant barrage of trivia. Their 
radios, equipped with scanners that 
automatically search the bands for 
transmissions, blare out hundreds 
of conversations over deck and 
pilothouse speakers. Information is 
often detected by fishermen sensi- 
tive not only to what is being said 
but also to who is talking and the 
speaker&apos;s tone of voice. Identifying 
the fisherman is important in judg- 



ing the veracity of the information. 
The tone of voice might indicate the 
conditions near the vessel — a 
speaker who is short of breath, for 
instance, may be working hard in a 
school of fish. Some fishermen, 
listening to the many hours of trans- 
missions concerning weather, 
equipment, family, and friends, 
never do develop the proper inter- 
pretive skills. These people exuber- 
antly chase illusive &quot;radio fish&quot;&quot; all 
season long. 

The hunter&quot;s reliance upon, and 
the trapper&quot; s rejection of, coopera- 
tion are both rational choices based 
upon the nature of their fishing 
strategies and technologies. It is in 
the hunter&apos;s self-interest to share 
information about fishing condi- 
tions, just as it is in the trapper&quot;s 
self-interest to be secretive about 
grounds. But on shore, both types

of fishermen are reluctant to coop- 
erate. Individualism, apparent 
thinning out of fish resources, and 
occupational hazards contribute to 
competitiveness between fishermen 
in the unstable marketplace. Buy- 
ers frequently have employed col- 
lusion, price fixing, retaliation, and 
indenturing loans to keep fishermen 
in a vulnerable economic position. 
For these reasons, cooperative 
activity on the beach is of a diflFer- 
ent order from what it is at sea. D

The TKumphant Trumpeter 



by Paul A. Johnsgard 



Once reduced to a few bevies, 
this magnificent swan is 
on the road to recovery 



Largest of all the swans and 
heaviest of North American birds, 
the trumpeter swan is on the in- 
crease. Once common and wide- 
spread over much of the western 
United States, the bird was a winter 
resident of the lower reaches of the 
Mississippi Valley, Louisiana, and 
Texas. During the last century, 
however, trade in swanskins — used 
to make powder puffs and writing 
and drawing quills — and the sale of 
eggs to collectors had a heavy im- 
pact on the species. In the period 
from 1853 to 1877, for example, 
London sales of trumpeter swan- 
skins imported through the Hud- 
son&apos;s Bay Company totaled nearly 
18,000, an average of about 750 
per year. Destruction of their 
prairie habitat and increased dis- 
turbance also took a heavy toll of 
these shy birds. By the time the 
species came under the complete 
protection of the Migratory Bird 
Treaty Act in 1918, many ornithol- 
ogists believed that the species was 
doomed to extinction. 

Population surveys in the early 
1930s gave estimates of from 37 to 
97 surviving trumpeter swans, 
nearly all of them in Yellowstone 
National Park and the nearby Red 
Rock Lakes area in southwestern 
Montana. At that time, a large 
breeding population in Alaska was 
overlooked because it was believed 
that those birds were whistling 



72 



swans, a species closely related to 
the trumpeters. Since the realiza- 
tion in 1954 that trumpeter swans 
nested in Alaska, surveys have indi- 
cated that there are now at least 
3,000 in that state. In addition, 
about 150 trumpeters survive in the 
marshes of western Alberta. 

But in the 1930s, conservation- 
ists did not know how many birds 
existed north of the Canadian 
border, and the outlook for the spe- 
cies within the contiguous United 
States was grim. 

The establishment of Red Rock 
Lakes Migratory Waterfowl Refuge 
in southwestern Montana in 1935 
was doubtless the most significant 
factor in protecting the last rem- 
nant of breeding trumpeter swans 
south of Canada. The nucleus of 
birds at that refuge provided other 
parks and refuges with trumpeters 
to establish new flocks. The first 
such transplant was conducted in 
1938, when four cygnets were 
placed on the National Elk Refuge, 
near Jackson, Wyoming. Six addi- 
tional birds were released there in 
1939 and 1941, and the first breed- 
ing occurred in 1944. Thereafter, 
nesting took place nearly every 
year, although no more than two

Trumpeter swans fly over Grand 
Telon Nalional Park, possibly 
in search of waters suitable for 
nesting. During a recent six-year 
period, the swans nested at 
eight sites within the park. 



nests were ever reported in any 
single year. 

Presumably from these nestings, 
trumpeter swans colonized abutting 
Grand Teton National Park a few 
years after its establishment in 
1950. (The protection from disturb- 
ance by ranching and other, related 
activities formerly in the area 
probably made colonization pos- 
sible.) 

One of the first areas to be occu- 
pied was Christian Pond, a thirty- 
acre marsh near Jackson Lake 
Lodge. Breeding occurred on that 
pond as early as 1954, and nesting 
attempts have been made every 
year since. During the eight-year 
period from 1969 through 1976, at 
least eighteen cygnets were raised 
by a pair using Christian Pond. 
Whether the same pair was in- 
volved every year is not certain, 
but it is possible: swans are long- 
lived; some have survived in cap- 
tivity for more than thirty years. 

Other areas in the park have also 
been used by trumpeter swans for 
nesting. In the six-year period be- 
tween 1970 and 1975 a total of eight 
different sites had nests. Yet during 
that entire period only forty-three 
cygnets are known to have been 



reared, including those from Chris- 
tian Pond. Considering that the 
usual clutch is four to six eggs, the 
reproductive success of the seven 
known pairs in the park each year 
was extraordinarily low; the aver- 
age for all pairs was less than one 
young successfully raised per year. 

Trumpeter swans have now been 
breeding in Grand Teton National 
Park for at least twenty-five years; 
yet the number of breeding pairs 
has not increased measurably in the 
last ten years. The question that 
arises is. What could be responsible 
for this bird&apos;s low reproductive 
rate and nonincreasing population 
in the park? 

The reproductive potential of the 
trumpeter swan is typical of swans 
in general and might be considered 
a model for large waterfowl. Al- 
though some refuge-raised trum- 
peters have bred when they were 
approaching the end of their third 
year, wild birds often do not breed 
until their fourth year as a result of 
competition for suitable nest sites 
with older and already established 
pairs. Thereafter, the birds attempt 
to nest every year for as long as 
they live. The survival rate for 
trumpeter swans in the wild is still 



unknown, but in the related Bewick 
swan of Eurasia, it is about 85 per- 
cent per year. Likewise, the Eura- 
sian whooper swan, often consid- 
ered conspecific with the trumpeter, 
has an estimated annual survival 
rate of 83 percent. The potential 
longevity of trumpeter swans should 
result in a large number of offspring 
over their lifetimes. Why then is 
Grand Teton National Park not 
afloat in trumpeter swans? 

To answer that question, one 
must examine not only the environ- 
ment in terms of its carrying capac- 
ity for swans but also the efficiency 
of the swans&apos; reproductive efforts. 

Studies on the biology of trum- 
peter swans indicate that their re- 
productive needs are fairly simple. 
Territories of breeding pairs are al- 
most always large to insure an ade- 
quate food supply for the adults and 
as many as six young. Rarely is a 
territory established on a pond or 
lake of less than five acres, and in 
Grand Teton National Park, as well 
as at Red Rock Lakes Refuge, the 
average territorial size is about 
thirty acres. Some marshes or small 
lakes as large as one hundred acres 
may be defended from intrusion by 
other pairs, particularly if the 
shoreline is open enough for un- 
obscured vision. Both the white 
plumage and the extremely loud 
vocalizations of the trumpeter swan 
have apparently evolved as devices 
for proclaiming large territories by 
maximizing individual conspic- 
uousness. 

Other considerations besides a 
minimum water area are important 
in determining what constitutes 
acceptable nesting habitat. First, 
water levels should be stable, 
avoiding the possibility of the 
nest&apos;s exposure to territorial preda- 
tors as a result of dropping levels or 
of flooding caused by a rise in water 
level. Second, much or all of the 



74 



water in a territory should be from 
one to three feet deep, to allow for 
subsurface foraging while swim- 
ming, and the water should be quiet 
and wave-free, with an abundance 
of emergent, floating, and sub- 
merged plants. The emergent plants 
are primarily of value as cover and 
as foundation material for the nest, 
while the submerged and floating 
plants provide an adequate food 
supply for these large herbivores. 
Given these considerations, that 
Grand Teton National Park does 
not have more nesting swans is not 
surprising. Many of its waters are 



deep, clear lakes, formed by glacial 
action, that oflFer little food or cover 
for the birds. Christian Pond, how- 
ever, as well as several of the other 
regular nesting sites in the park, is 
beaver formed, and its level is con- 
trolled by beaver dams. Like the 
moose, which feeds extensively on 
aquatic plants, and the greater 
sandhill crane, which nests in or 
around beaver impoundments, the 
presence of trumpeter swans in 
Grand Teton National Park is 
closely tied to the abundance and 
distribution of beavers. 

A very high mortality of eggs or 




cygnets is the probable reason for 
the low reproductive rales. To avoid 
overestimating cygnet production, 
the National Park Service&apos;s annual 
count of swan families in the park 
is usually made in late August or 
early September, when the young 
birds are nearly fledged. Therefore, 
there has been no way of knowing 
if most mortality occurs prior to 
hatching or sometime thereafter. 
But during three summers spent in 
the park, 1 never saw a full brood 
of six cygnets and rarely saw more 
than two, even shortly after hatch- 
ing. This would suggest that most 
mortality happens early, probably 
before the young are one to two 
weeks old. In any attempt to under- 
stand what the causes of such cyg- 
net or egg mortality might be, the 
breeding logistics for a bird the size 
of a trumpeter swan have to be 
considered. 

Trumpeter swans typically build 
large, mounded nests in marshes, 
well away from shore, in water 
about one to two feet deep. These 
nests are often constructed of bul- 
rushes, cattails, or other emergent 
vegetation; at times beaver lodges 
or muskrat houses are also used. A 
week or more may be spent build- 
ing a new nest or refurbishing an 
old foundation. Egg laying then 
begins and continues for ten days 
until a full clutch has been de- 
posited. Incubation begins with 
the last egg and lasts an average 
of 36 to 40 days. Finally, the young 
birds have an extremely long fledg- 
ing period, estimated at from 91 to 
122 days in the Montana- Wyoming 
population. Thus, a minimum of 
142 days, and perhaps as much as 
173 days, are required from the 
time nest construction begins until 
the young fledge. Since the frost- 
free period in the Grand Teton 
National Park area is less than 80 
days, the bird&apos;s long reproductive

cycle poses certain risks: the eggs 
might be fatally chilled before they 
hatch; the young cygnets might 
freeze before they develop ade- 
quate temperature regulation; and 
the water might freeze over before 
the juveniles fledge and thus lose 
their vulnerability to coyotes and 
other predators. 

I believe this environmental fac- 
tor is primarily responsible for the 
low reproductive success of trum- 
peter swans in the Grand Teton area. 
Originally adapted to breeding on 
prairie marshes in areas where the 
frost-free period is often 200 days 
or longer, trumpeters often suc- 
cumb under the severe strains of 
breeding in montane areas. Even in 
southeastern Alaska, where the 
largest population of trumpeter 
swans now exists, the frost-free 
period is more than 120 days and 
thus far less likely to be a mortality 
factor. In Alaska, 80 to 85 percent 
of the cygnets survive at least to the 
age of two months. 

If there is a lesson to be learned 
from this, it is that future releases 
of trumpeter swans into refuges 
should be done with some attention 
to the climatic characteristics of the 
area. A release in 1960 at Lacreek 
National Wildlife Refuge in South 
Dakota has been perhaps the most 
successful of the trumpeter trans-

numbers well over one hundred 
birds, and the swans have spread

South Dakota and three in Ne-

been made in Minnesota and Ne-

periods of at least 130 days.

The History of Bloodletting 

by Matthew J. Kluger 




&quot;Bloodletting is not only the most powerful and important, 
but the most generally used, of all our remedies. Scarcely a 
case of acute, or indeed of chronic disease, occurs, in 
which it does not become necessary to consider the&lt;property of having recourse to the lancet. ...&quot; 

Marshall Hall 

On the Morbid and Curative 

Effects of the Loss of Blood, 1830 



Pierpont Morgan Library 

I first became aware of Marshall Hall&apos;s 
thoughts on bloodletting about ten years 
ago, when I was investigating various as- 
pects of hibernation in bats. Hall was the 
first investigator to observe, back in 1832, 
that many species of temperate-zone bats 
are capable of undergoing frequent periods 
of torpor, allowing their body temperatures 
to drift downward toward the environmental 
temperature. 

A widely respected scientist who pub- 
lished papers on many subjects. Hall was 
capable of writing, &quot;It sometimes requires 
no little boldness to abstain from the use of 
the lancet.&quot; Like most physicians and scien- 
tists of the early nineteenth century. Hall 
would have considered bloodletting an eflFec- 
tive treatment for apoplexy, angina pectoris, 
asthma, vomiting blood, bruises, coughs, 
tuberculosis, contusions, diseases of the hip 
and knee joints, deafness, delirium and 
lunacy, dropsy, epilepsy, dizziness, gout, 
whooping cough, hydrocephalus, head- 
aches, inflammation of the eyes and lungs, 
drunkenness, lethargy, lumbago, measles. 



numbness of the limbs, ophthalmia, 
pleurisy, palsy, defective perspiration, 
rheumatism, insomnia, sciatica, shortness 
of breath, sore throat, and chest pains — 
among other troubles. 

Western doctors&apos; advocacy of bloodlet- 
ting was firmly rooted in the Hippocratic 
doctrine of humors, which was based largely 
on the theory advanced by Empedocles, a 
Sicilian-born philosopherofthe fifth century 
B.C., that the human body is composed of 
the four elements — earth, air, fire, and wa- 
ter. Other early natural scientists, especially 
Hippocrates in the fourth century b.c, ex- 
panded Empedocles&apos; elements into the four 
humors of the body — blood, phlegm, yellow 
bile, and black bile. The humoral theory of 
disease maintained that illness occurred 
when the body produced one of the four 
humors in excess. Then the body&apos;s defenses 
came into action. The patient&apos;s elevated 
body temperature, or fever, &quot;cooked&quot; the 
excess humor, separating it from the other 
humors so that the body could eliminate it. 

The physician could help the patient by 
performing two procedures. First, to assist 
the body in cooking the excess humor, the 
physician could warm the patient externally 
or give medicines that would raise the body 
temperature. This form of fever therapy has 
been advocated by physicians for thousands 
of years. For example, Rufus of Ephesus, a 
first-century physician, wrote, &quot;1 think that 
you cannot find another drug which heats in 
a more penetrating manner than fever; for 
this reason it is a good remedy for an 
individual seized with convulsions, and if 
there were a physician skillful enough to 
produce a fever, it would be useless to seek 
any other remedy against disease.&quot; Rufus 
advocated the use of fever as a therapeutic 



78 



y-r 




agent for epilepsy, convulsion, tetany, 
asthma, melancholia, certain skin diseases, 
and other medical problems. 

The second form of therapy available to 
the physician involved assisting the body to 
evacuate the cooked humor by purges that 
induced bowel movements, emetics that 
induced vomiting, sudorifics that induced 
sweating, or by bleeding. The humoral 
theory of disease greatly simplified the prac- 
tice of medicine by reducing major classes 
of drugs to those which warmed, cooled, 
purged, and so on, and by narrowing major 
therapies that did not call for medicines to 
the regulation of external temperature and to 
the removal of blood. Because of the great 
influence Hippocrates and his disciples had 
on Western medicine, these practices con- 
tinued throughout the Middle Ages and the 
Renaissance. Not until the 1800s did scien- 
tific investigators begin to actively 
scrutinize many of the ancient scholars&apos; 
medical theories. 

By that time, bloodletting took several 
forms, the most common being cupping and 
venesection, or phlebotomy. According to 
Thomas Mapleson, whose official title in 
1813 was Cupper to His Royal Highness the 
Prince Regent, bloodletting could be divided 
into two categories — general and topical. 
General bloodletting involved the cutting of 
a vein or, more rarely, an artery. From this 
wound, the blood flows freely. In topical 
bloodletting, slight, superficial incisions 
-&apos;(scarification) were made scarcely deeper 
:&apos;than the skin. Blood did not flow readily 



from these types of incisions unless the 
physician applied some form of suction. 
Mapleson says that 

Hippocrates takes notice of two kinds of instru- 
ments for the purpose of eliciting blood after the 
operation of scarifying. The first a small gourd, or 
cucurbit, furnished with two orifices, one of a 
sufficient size to include the scarification, the 
other small; by applying the mouth to the latter, 
the air was sucked out, and a partial vacuum 
formed; it was then closed by means of a bit of 
wax, till a proper quantity of blood was obtained. 
The other, of similar form and size, was con- 
structed of brass, but with only one aperture. In 
this a vacuum was produced by inserting a piece 
of burning flax or linen previously to applying it to 
the skin; a method very analogous to that which is 
employed for making a vacuum in the cupping 
glass at the present day. Hippocrates mentions 
also the application of exhausted cucurbits over 
the orifices made by leeches. 

As in all medical endeavors, controver- 
sies arose over the efficacy of various treat- 
ments. Here the cuppers opposed the 
phlebotomizers. Blood obtained during 
phlebotomy is entirely venous. It has not 
reached the heart and is partly deoxygen- 
ated, having passed through body tissues, 
giving up nutrients and picking up wastes. 
On the other hand, blood collected by cup- 
ping generally consisted of a mixture of both 
arterial, or oxygenated, blood and venous 
blood. Mapleson, a strong advocate of cup- 
ping, said that &quot;the crimson and purple color 
may be clearly distinguished as the two 
kinds of fluids mingle in the glass. I have 
observed that the more abundantly the arte- 
rial blood appears, the more benefit is gen- 
erally derived from the operation.&quot; Others, 
including Benjamin Rush, a leading physi- 
cian in colonial America, were strong advo- 
cates of venesection. 

The amount of blood that was let varied 
but could be substantial. Patients commonly 
were &quot;bled to faintness&quot; or lost &quot;1.5 liters 
[almost 50 ounces] of blood.&quot; Therapies 
that involved the withdrawal of such large 
amounts of blood were bound to draw some

regime du corps, a doctor lets blood;

detractors, but they seem to have been 
surprisingly few. One was William Cobbett, 
who likened Rush&apos;s famous bloodletting 
cure to &quot;one of those great discoveries 
which have contributed to the depopulation 
of the earth.&quot; Rush sued for libel: Cobbett 
was convicted and fined $8,000. 

Another form of cupping, dry cupping, did 
not entail external blood loss. By placing the 
cucurbit over the intact skin and evacuating 
some air, the physician could still induce 
some local swelling, which would shift bad 
humors from one region of the body to 
another. In the mid-l800s, Junod, a French 
physician, devised giant cupping, in which 
the patient was made to faint by sitting with 
his lower extremities in rarefied air. This

position shifted large volumes of blood away 
from the upper part of the body toward the 
lower regions. Fainting probably resulted 
from the decreased flow of blood to the 
brain. 

Various forms of bloodletting have been 
used until recent times, even in so-called 
developed countries. How extensive this 
practice is at present is uncertain, although it 
is still used by physicians to treat several 
blood-related disorders, including poly- 
cythemia vera, a disease of unknown cause 
characterized by an enormous increase in 
the number of red blood cells. Because of 
the blood&apos;s expanded volume and increased 
viscosity, patients suffering from this dis- 
ease experience headaches and dizziness. 
Venesection quickly returns the red-blood- 
cell mass and blood volume to normal and is 
often used as a treatment. Venesection is 
also often effective in treating hemo- 
chromatosis, a disease in which the body&apos;s 
stores of iron become excessive, leading to a 
variety of symptoms, often including heart 



failure and liver damage. Since most of the 
body&apos;s stores of iron are in the hemoglobin 
molecules within the red blood cells, 
periodic removal of blood often returns the 
patient&apos;s iron stores to normal. 

Thus, from the time of Hippocrates, 
Western medicine had a basis — albeit of 
questionable soundness — and the technol- 
ogy for removing blood as a therapy for most 
diseases. While bloodletting cannot be 
traced back before written history, the prac- 
tice predates Hippocrates by thousands of 
years. It went on in India and China, and 
some six thousand years ago, Babylonians 
were using forms of bloodletting. Their 
rationale could have been based on observa- 
tions of sick individuals who vomited, occa- 
sionally with blood, or on observations of 
other causes of blood loss, such as wounds 
or menstruation. Ancient physicians could 
have been attempting to simulate and assist 
natural methods of evacuating the body. 

The Greeks may have adopted bloodlet- 
ting from the Egyptians. According to 
Mapleson, the Egyptians believed that the 
water of the Nile, their chief source of 
potable water, was converted directly into 
blood once it was drunk. This apparently 
stemmed from the belief that at the com- 
mand of the Lord, Moses turned the waters 
of the Nile into blood. As a result, Egyptians 
believed they had a plethora of blood and 
periodically bled themselves to remove 
some of this excess. Bloodletting was also 
known to American Indians. In the early 
1800s, Lionel Wafer, an English ship&apos;s sur- 
geon, described a ritual practiced by 
Panamanian Indians of the Isthmus of Da- 
rien. 

The patient is seated on a stone in a river, and one 
with a small bow shoots little arrows into the 
naked body of the patient, up and down, shooting 
them as fast as he can and not missing any part. 
But the arrows are guarded, so that they pene- 
trate no farther than we commonly thrust our 
lancets; and if by chance they hit a vein which is 
full of wind, and the blood spirts out a little, they 
will leap and skip about, shewing many antic 
gestures, by way of rejoicing and triumph. 

Wafer then showed these primitive people 
how phlebotomies were performed in more 
advanced countries like England. &quot;I bound 
up her arm with a piece of bark, and with my 
lancet breathed a vein . . . and I drew off 
about 12 ounces and bound up her arm, and 
desired she might rest till the next day; by 
which means the fever abated and she had 
not another fit.&quot; This demonstration appa- 
rently gained Wafer great local fame. 

Was bloodletting, one of the most ancient 
therapeutic procedures, indirectly respon- 
sible for the origin of modern experimental 
medicine? Today, a cornerstone of most

HOW TO SAVE ON AUTO INSURANCE 

A GOOD DRIVING RECORD CAN LOWER YOUR PREMIUMS. SO CAN HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES. 



In many parts of the 
country the average cost of 
car insurance has risen over 
50% in the past five years. 

LiabiHty insurance pro- 
tects you against the claims 
of others. Its cost, like that of 
any insurance, is based on 
what the insurance company 
has to pay in claims plus its 
overhead. And the cost of 
everybody&apos;s individual liabil- 
ity insurance is inflated by 
large court settlements and 
exaggerated claims. 

Although liability insur- 
ance is required by law in 
many states, in light of the 
trend toward higher settle- 
ments, you should be sure 
that your coverage is ade- 
quate. 

But in the &quot;voluntary&quot; 
parts of your car insurance- 
collision and comprehensive 
(fire and theft)— that cover 
physical damage to your own 
car, there are some things 
you can do to lower your 
insurance bill. 

Safe drivers pay lower 
premiums for both liability 
and collision coverage. In- 
surance rates are set that 
way because drivers with a 
good past history are less 
likely to have accidents in the 
future. Many insurance com- 
panies define &quot;safe drivers&quot; 
as those with two or less 



moving traffic violations and 
no &quot;chargeable, at fault&quot; ac- 
cidents within the past three 
years. Their premiums may 
be as much as 25% lower. 

You can often cut your 
premiums for collision and 
comprehensive by 25% to 
50% by raising your deduct- 
ible. Many people still choose 
full-coverage comprehensive 
and $100 deductible collision 



value of your car on the used- 
car market, and your own 
financial situation. If your 
car is more than five years 
old, it may not pay to buy any 
collision insurance. If you do 
have an accident, casualty 
losses over $100 that are 
not reimbursed by insurance 
coverage are tax deductible, 
in many instances, providing 
you itemize your tax return.

experimentation is tiie use of large sample 
sizes and the science of statistics to analyze 
and interpret these data. A book published 
in 1 836 entitled Researches on the Effects of 
Bloodletting in Some Inflammatory Dis- 
eases, by Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis, 
was largely responsible for promoting the 
science of statistics. The older experimental 
literature was filled with anecdotal evidence 
or with data composed of a series of isolated 
observations with little regard for sample 
size, replicability, and reliability. This type 
of science makes colorful reading but is 
problematic in practice. 

Suppose an investigator was interested in 
determining the effects of drug X on the 
blood pressure of patients suffering from 
hypertension. If he or she used only a couple 
of individuals in the study, the results could 
not be used to generalize about this drug. 
Suppose drug X reduced the blood pressure 
in both individuals. Assuming that the ad- 
ministration of placebos led to no change in 
blood pressure, does this prove the drug 100 
percent effective in reducing blood pres- 
sure? If ten individuals were tested, the drug 
might be effective in only six out of ten 
cases, or 60 percent. When the sample size is 
increased to one hundred, a fairly respecta- 
ble sample size in most clinical trials, more 
meaningful data will be obtained. If drug X 
reduces blood pressure in sixty-four of the 
one hundred cases, the investigator can 
state with reasonable confidence that the 
drug is effective in reducing blood pressure 
in approximately two-thirds of cases of 
hypertension. As the sample size is in- 
creased, the investigator can place more 
faith in the replicability of these data. It is 
not surprising that in the first experiment, 
two out of two individuals could have re- 
sponded favorably simply by chance. If both 
individuals had failed to respond, this poten- 
tially helpful drug might have been dis- 
carded before its beneficial effects were 
discovered. 

Yet the concept of using large sample sizes 
and employing statistics to analyze data was 
not commonly accepted until fairly recently. 
Louis was primarily responsible for the 
advancement of medicine out of the anec- 
dotal and into the modern experimental era. 
In his book, dedicated to Marshall Hall, he 
defied the contemporary medical establish- 
ment by asserting that bloodletting had little 
effect on the progress of pneumonia: &quot;The 
results of my researches on the effects of 
bloodletting in inflammation, are so little in 
accordance with the general opinion, that it 
is not without a degree of hesitation I have 
decided to publish them.&quot; Louis was fairly 
confident of his assertions because he had 
employed what he called the &quot;numerical 
method.&quot; He used a large sample size and 
even divided his experimental population 
into different age brackets. Louis presented 



much data that indicated that blood- 
letting — generally meaning the removal of 
thirty to forty-five ounces during two or 
three sessions — sped the course of recovery 
in patients suffering from pneumonia. Those 
bled within the first four days remained ill an 
average of 15&apos;/2days and those bled after the 
fourth day remained ill an average of 1814 
days. However, 44 percent (eighteen out of 
forty-one) of the patients bled during the first 
four days died, whereas only 25 percent 
(nine out of thirty-six) of those that were 
bled after the fourth day died. Louis be- 
lieved that these differences, which accord- 
ing to modern analysis turn out to be statisti- 
cally significant, might be attributable to the 
differences in ages between those bled early 
and those bled at later dates. Unfortunately, 
Louis&apos;s study lacked control subjects — 
patients suffering from pneumonia who were 
not bled. However, in those days, when 
there was a general belief in the benefits of 
bloodletting, an experiment that denied the 
patient the right to be bled would have been 
highly unethical. 

Summarizing his study, Louis wrote &quot;that 
bloodletting has a happy effect on the prog- 
ress of pneumonitis . . . other things being 
equal, four or five days sooner than those 
bled at a later date.&quot; He also concluded 
&quot;that pneumonitis is never arrested at once 
by bloodletting&quot; and &quot;that age exerts great 
influence on the rapidity of the progress . . . 
of pneumonitis.&quot; While these findings might 
seem to support advocates of bloodletting. 
Louis&apos;s work was the first experimental 
demonstration that the practice was not a 
rapid panacea and that, at best, it had little 
effect on the speed of recovery. Indeed, 
Oliver Wendell Holmes — novelist, poet, his- 
torian, and physician — considered Louis&apos;s 
findings one of the most important contribu- 
tions to practical medicine of the nineteenth 
century. &quot;This was not a reform — it was a 
revolution,&quot; Holmes proclaimed. 

Perhaps more important than Louis&apos;s 
specific observations was his defense of the 
use of large numbers, which allowed the 
collection of significant data. Louis noted 
that &quot;it is difficult to collect a sufficient 
number of cases of any one disease, which 
shall be identical&quot; but emphasized that this 
documentation is essential in scientific in- 
vestigations. Furthermore, he added, the 
individuals used in a study must &quot;be per- 
fectly equal in age, and mathematically simi- 
lar in strength, stature and flesh. . . . We are 
constantly told of the experience of ages in 
medicine; but how can this experience be 
embodied, if those who write, instead of 
saying I have seen so many and so many 
times, merely say I have often seen, or 
seldom seen? If there is a means of embody- 
ing the experiences of ages, it is the numeri- 
cal method.&quot; While Louis was not the first 
to use statistics, he certainly exerted a major 



82 



m 



influence on the direction of biomedical 
research. 

Despite Louis&apos;s book and subsequent ar- 
ticles confirming that bloodletting had little 
effect on the course of non-blodd-related 
diseases, patients suffering from poly- 
cythemia vera, hemochromatosis, and other 
blood-related disorders could benefit from 
the periodic loss of blood. In instances of 
other diseases, rapid loss of substantial 
amounts of blood could have harmful ef- 
fects, including increased stress on the 
heart, potentially leading to cardiovascular 
shock. The patient would lose proteins such 
as hemoglobin, albumin, and antibodies. 
Loss of hemoglobin could result in hypoxia, 
or decreased oxygen in body tissues, espe- 
cially during periods of activity. 

There are, however, certain non-blood- 
related disorders in which bloodletting 
might have had some benefit. For example, 
removal of blood might have tired a patient 
or induced somnolence, certainly a cure for 
delirium or insomnia. Bloodletting also 
could have served as a placebo for psycho- 
somatic disorders, much as sugar pills do 
today. 

The loss of blood could also have com- 
bated many bacterial infections. In order to 
grow, most bacteria require iron in trace 
amounts. Blood contains substantial 



amounts of iron, tied up in hemoglobin and 
transferrin, a plasma protein with a strong 
affinity for iron. The body may respond to 
infection by reducing the level of iron that 
would be available to pathogenic micro- 
organisms. The host decreases its absorp- 
tion of iron from the gastrointestinal tract 
and stores considerable amounts of the iron, 
which had been bound to transferrin, in the 
liver. In iron-poor environments, many 
pathogenic bacteria grow more slowly. The 
infected organism&apos;s fever temperature 
further reduces bacteria growth. At an ele- 
vated temperature, the bacteria appear to be 
even more sensitive to reduced levels of 
iron. Over several days, loss of blood in the 
amounts prescribed in bloodletting would 
likely result in a greater decline in serum iron 
levels, further decreasing the growth rate of 
pathogenic microorganisms that require 
iron. Hence, in some cases, the potentially 
harmful effects of loss of substantial 
amounts of blood might have been counter- 
balanced by the reduction in iron that would 
feed invading microorganisms. Some time 
will elapse before this hypothesis can be 
tested, for I suspect that in these Proxmirian 
times, I would have difficulty obtaining a 
grant to study &quot;The Effect of Bloodletting 
(Venesection or Cupping) on the Survival 
Rate of Bacterially Infected Mammals.&quot; D

How the West Was Won 



by Gerald Carson 



Barbed wire made it 
possible to occupy the 
treeless western prairie 

It probably happened a thousand 
times. A &quot;mover&quot; from one of the 
old eastern states halted his wagon, 
with old &quot;crumpled horn&quot; tied on 
behind, somewhere in central In- 
diana where the timber thinned out. 
He climbed a bur oak tree for a look 
ahead toward the Illinois country 
and gazed to the west with a rush of 
emotions — astonishment, excite- 
ment, a lift of the spirits, a sense of 
awe sometimes mingled with anx- 
iety and fear. For the settler, this 
man from the forested east, saw a 
level, almost treeless land of un- 
dulating prairie grass tall as a horse 
and rider, reaching to the far hori- 
zon: a fertile, virgin land filled with 
promise — and threat. The phe- 
nomenon was without precedent in 
the pioneer&apos;s life or the lives of his 
ancestors. 

Some thought the scene monot- 
onous; others found it strange but 
beautiful. The analogy of a great, 
green sea was often invoked by 
travelers of the period from 1830 to 
1860. The wind stroking and swing- 
ing the tall bluestem grass of the 
meadowland brought to mind 
waves; the occasional, isolated 
groves, or &quot;bushes,&quot; seen shim- 
mering in the distance suggested 
sailing ships moving under full 
canvas. 

This was the middle border, the 
tallgrass prairie, the future Corn 
Belt. It covered 70 percent of Illi- 
nois and parts of Michigan, ran 
west to Minnesota, and curved 
south into large portions of Mis- 
souri and Kentucky; it was well 
watered and incredibly rich in its 
soil, but timber for housing and 
fences ranged from skimpy to non- 
existent. And, farther west, begin- 
ning approximately at the 98th 
meridian and stretching to about the 
120th meridian, lay the shortgrass 



plains with their dense sod of buf- 
falo grass and blue grama: a tree- 
less country, a new environment, 
deficient in rainfall, with a distinc- 
tive plant and animal life, con- 
trolled by the range cattle industry. 
Farmers had to have fences. Un- 
til the settlers reached the prairies of 
the Middle West, fencing materials 
of one sort or another had usually 
been ready at hand, not the product 
of industry, but simply a byproduct 
of clearing the land for agriculture. 
Stone hauled by oxen from the 
fields formed the rock walls of New 
England and eastern New York. 



Laying up a good dry wall took 
time, labor, skill. It was exhausting 
work and required, according to 
folklore, a gallon of rum for every 
rod offence. Timber was also abun- 
dant — at first — yielding logs for 
houses and barns and sometimes 
for split rails to top the rock walls. 
Farther south the earliest fences 
were made of brush moved to the 
edge of a clearing, a frail barrier 
followed later by stump fences, 
post-and-rail fences, and laid-up rail 
fences, the ends of the rails resting 
across each other in zigzag patterns, 
sometimes held together at the cor-

There wasn^t anything special 
going on that day 

(except Mrs. Emmons taking a picture of Moses Mitchell at his mill) 

Possibly tomorrow or the next day or next Sunday will be a very ordinary day 
in your own life. So much the better. Suppose you just decided to take your 
camera and use it to share one of your ordinary 1978 days with someone— 
perhaps a descendant— who will be born in, say, 2030. An unusual kind of gift. 
Think about it. Then do it. 



Like Chansonetta Stanley Emmons&apos;, 
your little project may open out beyond 
a single day.* You won&apos;t need 5&quot; x 7&quot; 
glass plates and the big Century camera 
with tripod that the proprietor&apos;s hand- 
some son William doubtless carried to 
the mill for Netta that day in 1902. 
William, wearing his best hat. then held 
little Hazel True very, very still for the 
long exposure. 

A widow in reduced circumstances, 
Netta probably obtained her plates for 
free from her devoted twin brothers, 
F. E. and F. O. Stanley, who owned a 
photographic plate factory. (We later

purchased it from them, freeing them 
to switch from plates to automobiles. 
Their second product achieved wider 
fame than their first. It was known as 
the Stanley Steamer.) An equally de- 
voted daughter hand-tinted Netta&apos;s pic- 
tures. 

Of course, you wouldn&apos;t need an artis- 
tically inclined daughter if you wanted 
your photographs in color. About half- 
way between 1902 and today 
Kodachrome film came out and pro- 
ceeded to improve continuously to this 
day in all ways, including longevity of 
the colors. 

If you wanted to project the color of 
your world as far into the future as 
Moses Mitchell&apos;s world lies in the past, 
we would suggest you have your 



Kodachrome film properly processed 
and kept in a place that you can count 
on to stay cool, dark, and just natu- 
rally low in humidity. 

There is also another way to make 
great photographs— Netta&apos;s way, where 
there is no color to lean on and no dyes 
to fade a bit as the generations pass. 
That is, black-and-white photography! 
We still make fine products like Kodak 
Panatomic-X film and the faster Kodak 
Plus-X and Tri-X films for little girls 
who just can&apos;t hold as still in shady 
places as Hazel True did.

With The New Telescope That&apos;s Popularizing Astronomy 



The amazing popularity of motion pic- 
tures such as Star Wars and Close Encoun- 
ters and TV programs like Star Trek, Space 
1999 and Logan&apos;s Run confirm the fact that 
Americans are looking skyward as never 
before. Astronomy is the NEW HOBBY of 
the 70&apos;s! 

And now there&apos;s good news for would-be 
space watchers, it&apos;s Edmund Scientific&apos;s 
new Astroscari&quot; 2001,an unusual looking, 
unusually effective, unusually inexpensive 
telescope anyone can use to get into this 
exciting hobby. The Astroscan 2001 gives 
you a window on the world beyond that 
which you have ever known. 

We&apos;ve devoted more than two years 
of concentrated engineering and product 
development to produce this special instru- 
ment. Our objectives were simple but chal- 
lenging. The newest Edmund Scientific tele- 
scope had to: • give bright, clear views of 
the stars, the planets, the moon • be light- 
weight for extreme portability; convenient 
for hikes, bike trips, vacations • be simple to 
set up and use so anyone, even a young child, 
could enjoy the exciting hobby of astronomy 
• and, most important, be affordable! 

The result of this intensive program is 
Astroscan 2001, a telescope so different and 
so precise even professional astronomers 
have raved about it. Andat just$169.95ifs 
one of the best telescope buys available. 

The 2001 is a classic Newtonian reflector 
telescope, using the same basic optical de- 
sign as the largest observatory instruments. 
Light from distant celestial objects enters 



through an optically-coated window, is re- 
flected and focused by a A&apos;A&quot; highly- 
polished parabolic mirror, reflected onto a 
secondary flat-surfaced mirror and through 
a 28mm magnifying eyepiece, to your eye. 
The fine optics in Astroscan are better than 
those found in the world&apos;s best cameras. 

With the Astroscan&apos;s wide field you can 
see more stars and features in a single 
view than possible with most other scopes. 
And, Astroscan&apos;s amazing light-gathering 
ability permits views of stars so faint they&apos;re 
invisible to the naked eye. 

Astroscan weighs just over 10 pounds 
and is only 17 inches long. The attractively 
styled 2001 body is ruggedly constructed of 
high-impact red styrene. Its uniquely de- 
signed aluminum mount and fingertip focus- 
ing&apos; enables anyone to set up and use this 
fine instrument in minutes. 

The Edmund Scientific Astroscan 2001 is 
available now for immediate shipment You 
can order yours today with the coupon be- 
low. Use the Astroscan under the Edmund 
30-day unconditional guarantee. Experience 
the spectacular views awaiting you wher- 
ever you go. If you and your family are not 
completely satisfied with this exciting tele- 
scope, simply return it for a full refund. Ex- 
pand your world today. Order now.

ners by slanting posts and variously 
known as worm, snake, or Virginia 
fence. 

The American diaspora that de- 
bouched from the eastern wood- 
lands onto the prairie has provided 
a dramatic and traumatic instance 
of the struggle of man versus en- 
vironment. It has engaged the at- 
tention of writers on social history, 
sociology, agriculture, and anthro- 
pology. They have noted the cul- 
tural shock; the inadequacy of 
available tools in the new setting; 
the attitudes, laws, and customs 
that had to be modified to meet the 
new situation; the wrenching ad- 
justments; the improvisation that 
settlers of eastern origin had to 
make. In the process of occupying 
the land, fencing became a major 
obstacle to settlement. Indeed, dur- 
ing the Civil War, an Iowa journalist 
declared, &quot;The subject offences is 
as important as that of ironclads.&quot; 

The fencing problem was critical 
for the prairie farmer but not en- 
tirely new. A growing scarcity of 
timber, the rising cost of labor for 
splitting rails, and fence mainte- 
nance became topics of earnest dis- 
cussion and concern in the older 
states between the 1830s and 1850s. 
As early as the 1790s, George 
Washington was expressing his dis- 
satisfaction with timber fences and 
had begun to experiment with 
hedges and ditches. An anecdote is 
told of John C. Calhoun that he 
complained vigorously about the 
census of 1850 because it left out 
the most important product of 
domestic industry. 



86 




&quot;What is that?&quot; a friend inquired 
anxiously. 

&quot;Fences, fences,&quot; Calhoun re- 
plied. &quot;They cost more and are of 
more importance to us as an agri- 
cultural people than any other de- 
partment of domestic industry.&quot; 

On the plains of the Middle West 
every idea that held the least prom- 
ise was tried: mud fences with a 
cap-and-stake fence on top of the 
balk; ditch-and-bank fences, which 
stock quickly trampled into useless- 
ness. Hedges, or &quot;life fences,&quot; en- 
joyed a vogue. These were made of 
Cherokee rose, hawthorn, honey 
locust, red cedar, cottonwood, 
white willow, and bois d&apos;arc, or 
Osage orange, which grows rapidly 
and has long, sharp thorns. The 
popularity of this last species, from 
about 1840 through 1870, was called 
various things by skeptics — a 
&quot;mania,&quot; a &quot;prairie humbug,&quot; or 
&quot;hedge fever.&quot; Osage orange is a 
southern plant; its hardiness in 
northern climates was questionable. 
Furthermore, constant trimming 
was needed or the hedge became 
trees, easily penetrated by cattle. 

The great hopes held out by ad- 
vocates of the hedge fence were 
dashed as the defects of the Osage 
orange became apparent. Although 
the initial cost of a hedge fence was 
low, it required from three to five 
years to get a good growth, and 
prairie fires could always destroy 
the small plants. Sheep and small 
animals ate the bark and leaves, and 
once set, a hedge fence could not be

Board fences were common in 
the upper Mississippi Valley after 
the railroads had tapped the piner- 
ies of Wisconsin and Minnesota, 
but there were limits set by dis- 
tance, freight costs, and diminish- 
ing supply. Many pioneers who 
could reach timber without too long 
a trip preferred to &quot;haul and maul,&quot; 
that is, make rails. This was pos- 
sible in limited areas where the 
bluflFs and flood plains of rivers and 
streams provided the raw material. 

But wooden rails also had their 
disadvantages. They required much 
labor and were subject to fire, rot, 
and theft. The Virginia zigzag was 
an easy mark for a type of vagrant

hog called, in Illinois, the &quot;prairie 
racer,&quot; which would root, burrow, 
and squirm until it had got its sharp, 
pikelike nose under the bottom 
rails so it could start heaving the 
fence down. 

According to an estimate made 
by the American Aghculturist in the 
pre-barbed-wire days, maintaining 
rail fencing absorbed one-twelfth of 
the total annual labor on a farm. 
Necessary, yes, but nonproductive 
work. For the country as a whole, 
in the 1860s the cost of fencing for 
crop agriculture ran about twice the 
value of the land. This gives some 
idea of the pressure behind the 
search for some big innovation, 
some solution that had not been 
thought of before, that would re- 
sult in fencing capable of con- 
trolling unruly animals, simple in

Structure, cheap in cost, and prac- 
tical for the ordinary farmer to 
erect. 

The search turned to a product of 
industry, smooth wire. Made of un- 
galvanized iron, the wire had to be 
painted to avoid rust, was not uni- 
form in tensile strength, snapped 
in cold weather, and sagged in hot. 
It held no terrors for cattle. Live- 
stock learned to loosen the posts 
and to lean on the wire until it gave 
way. Allan G. Bogue, a specialist in 
the economic history of the West, 
has expressed what happened with 
humorous realism: &quot;Cattle and 
horses viewed the wire fences . . . 
with friendly tolerance; after they 
had scratched out their winter coats 
upon them, they found easy pas- 
sage. Pigs scorned them utterly.&quot; 

The urgent, nationwide search 
for a better form of fencing con- 
tinued. Farmers, mechanics, and 
tinkerers began to experiment with 
ways to attach sharp prongs, 
thorns, or barbs to the wire. De- 
spite technical deficiencies in draw- 
ing, annealing, and tempering wire, 
it did have some of the desired 
qualities. It took up no room, ex- 
tracted nothing from the soil, cast 
no shade, was immune to wind

and snowdrifts, was durable and 
inexpensive. 

No one person invented barbed 
wire — many individuals contrib- 
uted, usually gropingly, to the 
gradual unfolding of the concept. A 
number of eastern men took out 
patents in the 1860s, but their 
models proved to be impractical 
and, in any event, could not be 
machine manufactured. The wire 
that met the specifications was the 
work of practical men of the West 
who lived close to the problem, 
especially three men — Joseph F. 
Glidden, Jacob Haish, and Isaac 
L. Ellwood — who all lived in or near 
De Kalb, Illinois, a village on the 
edge of the prairie country. Accord- 
ing to Ellwood, the three visited the 
De Kalb county fair in 1873 and saw 
there an exhibit of a strip of wood 
about sixteen feet long with the 
sharp points of brads sticking out of 
it. The notion was to hang it as a 
visible repellent on a smooth wire 
fence. 

&quot;All three of us,&quot; Ellwood said, 
&quot;stood looking at this invention . . . 
and I think that each one of us at 
that hour conceived the idea that 
barbs could be placed on wire in 
some way instead of being driven

It&apos;s 10° outside . . . Even getting colder. So you bundle up in 
layers and layers of heavy clothes. First with long underwear . . . 
then bulky, restrictive thermalwear on top. 

Oh, you were warm, all right. Like in a Turk- 
ish bath. Because you began to perspire from 
all your activity. And perspiring in that 
mountain of clothes is like perspiring in a 
plastic bag! The perspiration is locked in. 
So there you are. Wet and miserable. 

But now, at last, Damart has solved the 
problem. Because Damart invented un- 
derwear that keeps you warm, dry and 
comfortable no matter how cold it is or 
how long you stay out. Underwear that&apos;s 
soft and light so you can move easily. 
Underwear that lets the perspiration 
evaporate through so you always stay 
warm and dry next to your skin. 

Damart does this with a new miracle 
fabric — Thermolactyl. It not only retains 
and reflects your natural body warmth, 
it&apos;s knitted to let perspiration out! No 
other underwear does this! Damart Ther- 
molactyl is so comfortable that the Mount 
Everest climbing expedition wears it. So 
does the Mt. McKinley Bicentennial Expedi- 
tion and the U.S. Bobsled Team. Damart is 
also worn by the Chicago Bears Football 
Club, New England Patriots and Philadelphia 
Eagles.

into the strip of wood.&quot; Haish, a 
local lumber dealer and contractor, 
developed an S barb in his car- 
penter shop. Glidden, who lived on 
his farm west of town, made his 
first barbs in his kitchen, using an 
old-fashioned wall coffee mill that 
had been adapted by a local black- 
smith for the work of twisting the 
prongs. The handle was turned, 
according to a generally accepted 
story, by Glidden&quot; s wife, Lucinda. 
At first, Glidden put barbs on a 
single wire but had diflRculty keep- 
ing them properly spaced. One day, 
having accidentally tangled wire 
only part of which was barbed, he 
got the idea of wrapping the plain 
wire around the wire already fitted 
with the sharp points so as to snub 
them securely in place. The twist- 
ing was done by a crank taken 
from an old grindstone and 
mounted on a trestle. As recol- 
lected by one of Glidden&apos; s asso- 
ciates, this crank, too, was turned 
by Lucinda. 

Both Glidden and Haish were 
prompt, aggressive, and successful 
in securing patents. Both twisted 
two strands of wire, but their prod- 
ucts diflFered in the way the barbs 
were attached. Production and sales 
expanded rapidly, but patent in- 
fringement was widespread in 
Illinois and Iowa, and the business 
was so easy to enter that the manu- 
facture of &quot;moonshine&quot; barbed 
wire became practically a regional 
cottage (or barn) industry. 
Glidden&apos;s wire, appropriately 
named Winner, is regarded as the 
most important step taken by any- 
one in perfecting barbed wire. His 
first conception was complete, 
needed no further refining, and had 
the patentable characteristics that 
enabled it to fend oflf years of spec- 
tacular attacks in the courts. 

EUwood, a De Kalb hardware 
merchant, saw the Glidden wire in 
use, acknowledged that it was 
better than his own scheme, and 
opened negotiations to become 
Glidden&apos;s partner. This accom-

plished, Ellwood later bought 
Glidden out, and by a complicated 
series of consolidations, their in- 
terests ended up in the United 
States Steel Corporation. 

Haish preferred to go it alone. 
The Glidden and Haish products 
remained in conflict in the courts 
and in competition in the market- 
place for many years. Haish, who 
died only a few days before his 
hundredth birthday, had long be- 
fore placed over the doorway of his 
home in De Kalb a sign reading 
&quot;Jacob Haish, Inventor of Barbed 
Wire.&quot; 

With &quot;bobbed wire&quot; available in 
almost unlimited quantities — and 
enhanced in quality with the intro- 
duction of the Bessemer steel wire 
process — old problems, such as 
herd laws, became aggravated. Un- 
der English common law the obliga- 
tion to erect a legal fence was 
placed upon the owner of livestock, 
not the cultivator of crops. But in 
British America the law was re- 
versed. America was a land of im- 
mense forests and pastures open to 




all as public commons for grazing, 
while the limited amounts of land 
under cultivation for subsistence 
farming could be enclosed. 

This new situation was recog- 
nized by colonial statutes and 
carried on under state law, that is, 
the farmer had to enclose his crops 
to sustain claims of trespassing and 
damage. The custom of allowing 
animals to run at large continued for 
a long time. As late as the 1850s, 
hogs and cows were the cause of 
accidents in New York&apos;s City Hall 
Park. Farm animals ranged freely in 
Washington, and according to a 
standing joke, every third person 
one met in Cincinnati was a hog. 

The fence-law problem followed 
the settlement line as it moved west. 
In Illinois, Iowa, and eastern Kan- 
sas and Nebraska the battle was 
fought bitterly, usually on the town- 
ship or county level, the issue de- 
pending on the dominant charac-

For centuries people feared it, made 
sacrifices to it, wailed over it. Now we 
rush to greet it — a total eclipse of the 
sun. 

On February 26, 1 979, the last solar 
eclipse over the continental United 
States until the year 2017 will occur 
over Canada and limited portions of the 
American Northwest. 
Now nature&apos;s most enchanting heavenly 
creation can be seen with one of her 
most alluring earthly spectacles; Old 
Faithful and Yellowstone National Park. 
The Huntely Lodge at Big Sky, l\/lontana 
will play host from February 23rd to the 
27th to all those seeking a fulfilling 
experience. 



A price of $385.00 per person includes 
four nights lodging, all meals, tours, and 
bus transportation to the eclipse site. 
A major highlight of the package, also 
included in the price, is a specially 
designed science/eclipse lecture 
series featuring prominent authorities 
in meteorology and the philosophy of 
science. 

We welcome your participation.

terof the local agriculture. The heat 
generated by the herd-law dispute 
is suggested in the testimony of a 
Nebraska farmer who rose in the 
legislature, his hands rammed down 
hard in his pockets, and said in a 
shaking voice: &quot;Mr. Stone [English 
jurist Sir William Blackstone] did 
not know anything about Herd 
Law, never was in Nebraska, and 
besides he weren&apos;t no farmer.&quot; 

Slowly , public sentiment turned to 
favor stock confinement, and state 
legislatures responded by passing 
fencing laws that required owners 
of herd animals to put up fences 
and defined the legal basis for tres- 
pass, distraint, sale, and damages. 
In the end the cheap barbed wire 
made possible a more diversified 
agriculture on the tallgrass prai- 
ries. Thus technology, plus legal 
remedies, set the future of the Corn 
Belt, drawing to the new West the 
crop farmer, the land speculator, 
the doctor, the town-site promoter, 
and the briefless lawyer with his 
library — Blackstone&apos; s Commen- 
taries and Chitty on Pleading — in 
his carpetbag. All were bent on 
prospering in the new country 
whose development barbed wire 
had, to an important degree, made 
possible. 

West of the 98th meridian, which 
cuts down through eastern South 
Dakota, central Nebraska, Kansas, 
Oklahoma, and Texas, barbed wire 
played a prominent part in the con- 
flict between the cattlemen and 
homesteaders. In this contest the 
wire was decisively on the side of 
the nester and against the economic 
order built around the longhorn 
steer, the roundup, and free grass. 
From the very beginning of large- 
scale manufacture of barbed wire.

the Great Plains was recognized as 
the primary mari&lt;et for the wire. 
Isaac Ell wood, having gained full 
control of the Glidden patents, sent 
representatives, among them John 
W. Gates, a superb salesman, to 
San Antonio, with samples of 
barbed wire. Skeptical cattlemen 
thought the new fencing was flimsy, 
cruel, likely to cut stock, in sum, a 
&quot;Yankee fake.&quot; Gates was a flam- 
boyant figure who added much 
color to the barbed wire business. 
At San Antonio, while he was sit- 
ting in a Mexican chili parlor. Gates 
watched the medicine show of 
&quot;Doc&quot; Lighthall, a skillful peddler 
of miraculous remedies. 

&quot;We&apos;ll do like &apos;Doc&apos; Lighthall,&quot; 
Gates exclaimed to a friend. He got 
permission to put on a free show in 
the main plaza next to the cathe- 
dral. There he set up a corral with 
post and wire and invited the ranch- 
men to bring on their most vicious 
beef brutes. He praised his mer- 
chandise in authentic carnival style 
as &quot;the finest fencing in the world, 
light as air, stronger than whiskey, 
cheaper than dirt, all steel, and 
miles long. The cattle ain&apos;t born 
that can get through it.&quot; 

Twenty-five wild steers were 
driven into the enclosure. There 
was much sound and fury as the 
longhorns charged against the 
fence. The wire held. The beasts 
tried again but could not breach it. 
After repeated attempts, they gave 
up, milling about restlessly but 
avoiding contact with the sharp 
prongs. Cowmen and farmers found 
that seeing is believing. It was a 
historic moment and, as events 
turned out, made Gates&apos;s fortune. 
Shortly, another profitable market 
opened up — the railroads, which re- 
quired thousands of miles of multi- 
strand barbed wire to protect their 
rights of way. Soon wire agents 
were crisscrossing the High Plains 
and sending back carloads and even

trainloads of the shiny spools of 
wire. 

Gates appraised the situation 
and finding there was more money 
to be made in manufacturing than in 
distribution, he turned his formid- 
able promotional talents to putting 
together a huge complex, the 
American Steel and Wire Company, 
later a component of the United 
States Steel Corporation. His 
shrewdness, persuasiveness, and 
audacity in risk taking earned for 
him the nickname Bet-You-a-Mil- 
lion Gates, although he denied ever 
having said it. Since this is an ac- 
count of the environmental, social, 
and economic consequences of the 
introduction of barbed wire, we bid 
adieu to Gates at this point, leaving 
him to the enjoyment of his fortune 
— his diamond-studded shirt front, 
his cuflF links and suspender buckles 
with similar adornments, his Paris 
apartment, and his Corots and 
Meissoniers. 

Pulp magazines, paperback West- 
erns, the movies, and television 
specials have thoroughly exploited 
the dramatic possibilities inherent 
in the range wars between cattle- 
men and sheepherders. Yet in the 
opinion of a responsible historian of 
the West, Joe B. Frantz, &quot;A greater 
menace than sheep was the intro- 
duction of barbed wire . . . the 
barbed wire came to enclose range, 
waterhole, and trail . . . barbed 
wire was savage, unrefined, and 
hard — and it made the Great Plains 
finally fit for settlement . . . .&quot; And 
a western poet sang sadly of &quot;the 
prairie cleft by skirmish lines of 
fence,&quot; adding in anger: 



They say that heaven is a 

free range land. 
Goodbye, goodbye. O fare 

you well. 
But its barbed wire for 

the devil&apos;s hat band; 
And barbed wire blankets 

down in hell. 

In the spacious days of the open 
range the kings of the free grass 
country owned the cattle but not 
the land. With the appearance of 
the farmers and small stockmen 
who owned and fenced their hold- 
ings, including scarce water re- 
sources, the ranchers out of neces- 
sity began to acquire land and to 
fence it. This they often did some- 
what carelessly, enclosing stream 
banks and water holes they did not 
own, large chunks of the public do- 
main, and even cutting off estab- 
lished public roads and access to 
the home places of landowners who 
held deeds to their property. If the 
&quot;little man&quot; removed an illegal 
fence, threatening notices were 
posted for his attention. One ran, 
&quot;The son of a bitch who opens the 
fence had better look out for his 
scalp&quot;; and a letter writer threat- 
ened that if the nester violated the 
signs on the fence, a cowboy &quot;just 
points his Henry rifle in the direc- 
tion where it will do the most good, 
and if someone is killed it is charged 
up to the Indians or the highway- 
man.&quot; The granger, for his part, 
plowed up his quarter section and 
turned a furrow around the claim. 
When cattle strayed from the range- 
land onto his cropland, he shot them, 
thereby protecting his homestead 
and also furnishing his family with

a welcome addition to their diet. 

The inconveniences that the new 
barriers caused the Indians, the 
buflfalo herds, the &quot;brand burners,&quot; 
and the cattle thieves were uni- 
versally welcomed. But on the level 
of economic competition, the con- 
flict between old and new ways of 
life led to terrorist tactics, including 
fence cutting, which in 1883-84 
grew into what was called &quot;the 
barbed wire war,&quot; with both sides, 
the big-pasture men and the farm- 
ers, wielding the wire nippers. The 
war started in Texas, Wyoming, 
and New Mexico, then spread to 
Nebraska, Colorado, and Montana. 
Honest men, wranglers, thieves, 
and outlaws formed an unlikely 
alliance but shared a common de- 
termination, each for his own rea- 
sons, to destroy the new fencing 
and reopen free passage to grass 
and water. Well-organized groups 
accomplished their ends under 
cover of darkness and drawn re- 
volvers. Civil commotion followed. 
Stock was poisoned, grass fires set. 
There was dynamiting of homes, 
mayhem and murder. 

Grand juries would not indict. 
Petit juries would not convict. In 
Texas the war waged by the night- 
riders was ended by the Rangers 
and the action of a special session 
of the state legislature that pre- 
scribed rules for reasonable fencing 
and made fence cutting a felony. 
Gradually, public opinion lined up 
in support of the law. In other 
states, also, new fencing laws were 
enacted and came to be accepted. 

The ultimate eflFect of the ar- 
mored wire was to turn the range 
into stock farms, reduce the num- 
ber and status of the cowhands, 
make possible improved herds be- 
cause of selective breeding, and 
open the way to grain farming, that 
is, a mixed form of agriculture. 
Social changes were equally strik- 
ing. As the trail hand and the chuck 
wagon disappeared, a new civiliza- 
tion — built around family life, the 
church, and the school — took over 
the land, and public roads con- 
nected the rural population with 
nearby market towns. 

OflFbeat uses of the wire included 
emergency repairs to farm machin- 
ery and as a substitute for a rope or 
chain in pulling stalled Model Ts 
out of mudholes, with a fence rail, 
if available, assisting as a pry. An- 
other use, undreamed of by the in- 
ventors of barbed wire, appeared

RIVERS 

A NATURAL HlSTOinf 




In over 2.50 striking, full-color pho- 
tographs and a clear, lively text, the 
author-photographer of the widely 
hailed The Swamp takes us on an 
exploration of the natural wonders 
of our rivers. 

Bill Thomas reveals the beauty, the 
moods, the riverside flora and 
fauna of all the river zones: the 
Ozarks, rivers of the north woods, 
streams of the Rockies, Tidewater 
streams, Arctic rivers. Pacific 
streams, desert rivers, prairie rivers, 
rivers of the heartland, eastern 
mountain rivers, landlocked rivers 
of the Great Basin, rivers of the 
deep south, and New England 
rivers. 

How many of these stunning scenes 
will survive and for how long are 
questions that he addresses in his 
final chapter. In it, he shows how a 
river can die— and outlines the steps 
which might restore the balance 
between the demands of civihzation 
and the values of wilderness.

A MARVELOUS GIFT FOR 

A SCIENCE-MINDED FRIEND! 



when small, local telephone com- 
panies, often owned by their sub- 
scribers, linked farms together by 
hooking lines on to pasture fences 
and letting the barbed wire carry 
the talk traffic, subject, of course, 
to interruptions by bolts of light- 
ning, the opening of a field gate, 
or a mishap involving an angry bull. 
The first rural telephone line in 
Kansas was strung on a barbed wire 
fence in Riley County in the 1880s, 
and one such primitive transmission 
line was reported in active service 
as late as 1952. All families had 
their own ring on the party line. 
When any number was rung up, all 
the neighbors&quot; receivers were taken 
down with an audible click, so that 
they, too, could share the news and 
gossip and so break the monotony 
and loneliness of farm life. 

Barbed-wire technology shows 
up in darker colors in the present 
century because of the part played 
by the wire in war and politics — 
such as the dreadful entanglements 
of World War I trench warfare; the 
concentration camps of World War 
II; the appearance in Vietnam of 
&quot;apron&quot; wire fastened on X-shaped 
steel stakes. A variation was con- 
certina wire, so called because the 
free-standing, rolling whorls could 
be pulled out like the bellows of an 
accordian and installed around the 
perimeter of a defensive position or 
snapped back into a roll and moved 
to a new location. And barbed wire 
still routinely protects the chan- 
celleries and palaces of today&apos;s dic- 
tators. 

Many history buff&apos;s find that they 
can best get the feel of the past from 
the artifacts left behind, such as 
buttons, bottles, spurs, furniture, 
manuscripts, stamps, china, glass — 
and barbed wire. An estimated 
10,000 to 50,000 Americans are 
engaged in assembling personal col- 



lections from among the approxi- 
mately 600 kinds of wire that have 
appeared in the last hundred years. 
To qualify as collectable and 
worthy of being mounted on a 
showboard, each specimen must be 
eighteen inches long. 

Wire enthusiasts have strong ro- 
mantic and nostalgic feelings about 
the stuff. There are a dozen state 
barbed wire associations, an inter- 
national group of collectors, a 
Who&apos;s Who in Barbed Wire, a 
Barbed Wire Hall of Fame, and nu- 
merous society bulletins, two flour- 
ishing newspapers, and many hand- 
books for the identification and 
classification of barbed wire. Metal 
detectors and even helicopters have 
been pressed into service: the first 
for scanning old refuse heaps and 
farm dumps; the second for skim- 
ming over ancient fence rows that 
might contain fragments of some 
rarity — a length of #141 Spur 
Rowell or of Glidden&apos;s Winner or of 
1882 George Elsey Ribbon. 

An annual Barbed Wire Swap and 
Sell Session is held each year in 
the little town of La Crosse, Kan- 
sas, which calls itself the Barbed 
Wire Capital of the World. Splicing 
contests for the world champion- 
ship are a feature of these yearly 
conventions, with a Junior Divi- 
sion for the youngsters, and con- 
tests for women, called the &quot;Pow- 
der Pufi&apos; Division.&quot; After a parade 
and a Saturday night banquet, con- 
tented collectors drive home with 
bits of rusting metal worth, in the 
market their enthusiasm has cre- 
ated, up to $150. As one &quot;bar- 
barian&quot; explains the fascination of 
the search, &quot;It smacks of the Old 
West.&quot; 

Gerald Carson, author and social 
historian, is a frequent contrihiitor

Celestial Events 

by Thomas D. Nicholson 

Sun and Moon The sun in November is well south of the equatorial 
plane, in the constellation Libra for most of the month. It will move 
into Scorpius about the 23rd and into Ophiuchus before month&apos;s 
end. It doesn&apos;t reach the winter solstice for another three weeks but 
is within a few degrees of its most southerly position by the end of 
November, when daylight is only 15 minutes longer than at the 
solstice. 

We have an evening moon for the first half of November and 
December, and a morning moon from midmonth on. In November, 
first-quarter moon is on the 7th, full moon on the 15th, last-quarter 
on the 22nd, and new moon on the 30th. The next first-quarter moon 
is on December 6, full moon on the 14th. Perigee occurs on Novem- 
ber 5 and December 2, apogee on November 20. 

Stars and Planets There are no planets on the November evening 
Star Map because none are above the horizon in the early night 
hours. Mercury, Venus (until November 7), and Mars are evening 
stars, but are too low at sundown and set too early to be seen. Jupi- 
ter comes up later at night and by midnight will be very bright and 
high in the east, midway between the bright twin stars of Gemini 
(Pollux and Castor) and Regulus (in Leo). And about midnight, 
Saturn rises in Leo, behind (to the left and below) Regulus. Both 
Jupiter and Saturn are morning stars and will be very prominent in 
the dawn sky. Jupiter, the brighter of the two, will be high in the 
south; Saturn will be to the left, past Regulus (quite similar to Saturn 
in brightness). Late in November and early December, Venus will be 
very prominent as a morning star, becoming bright and easily seen 
above the southeastern horizon at about dawn. 

November 4: The shower of meteors radiating from Taurus reaches 
maximum. You may see up to 15 meteors per hour from this weak, 
broad, and dispersed stream, but most are dim. 

November 5: Mercury and Mars are in conjunction. 

November 7: Venus is at inferior conjunction (between the earth 
and the sun) and enters the morning sky. 

November 15-16: An occupation of the bright star Aldebaran by 
the moon will be generally visible throughout North America. The 
star will disappear behind the moon&apos;s edge some time between 10:00 
and 11:00 p.m., EST, and emerge within an hour. Times and dura- 
tion vary with location, and adjustment should be made for different 
time zones. Aldebaran is quite bright, but binoculars will enhance 
visibility when the star is very close to the nearby full moon. 

November 17: The Leonid meteor shower is at maximum this 
morning. You may see up to 15 shower meteors per hour, swift and 
often very bright. 

November 20-21: Jupiter rises and remains near the moon. 

November 23-24: Saturn, rising about midnight, is near the moon; 
Jupiter is to the west (right) of both. 

November 25-26: Three planets change the direction of their 
movement through the stars. Mercury and Jupiter begin their west- 
erly (retrograde) motion; Venus ends its retrograde swing and re- 
sumes direct (easterly) motion. 

December 5: Mercury enters the morning sky. 

December 13: Another occultation of Aldebaran may be seen 
along the Pacific Coast at about moonset early this morning. 

December 14: Venus is at greatest brilliancy as a morning star. 

•Hold the Star Map so the compass direction you face is at the bottom; 
then match the stars in the lower half of the map with those in the sky near 
the horizon. The map is for 11:10 p.m. on November 1; 10:15 p.m. on No- 
vember 15; 9:20 p.m. on November 30; and 8:20 p.m. on December 15; but 
it can be used for an hour before and after those times.

The AUende Meteorite 



Studies of the composition 
of this body are forcing 
planetary scientists to 
revise their theories of the 
solar system&apos;s formation 

During the past nine years exten- 
sive studies of remarkable material 
from a single meteorite have been 
carried out in many laboratories 
throughout the world. These in- 
vestigations show that various min- 
eral assemblages within this mete- 
orite are well-preserved relics of 
primitive material dating back to 
the earliest history of the solar 
system. There is even a chance that 
fossil presolar grains have been 
found within this material. These 
discoveries have had a major im- 
pact on our thinking regarding the 
formation of the solar system. A 
case could be made for the claim 
that even more will be learned re- 
garding the early solar system from 
the study of this meteorite than 
from the extremely rewarding 
studies of rocks returned from the 
moon by the U.S. Apollo and 
USSR Luna programs. 

The story of the meteorite began 
in the valley of el Rio del Valle de 
Allende in the central region of the 
state of Chihuahua, Mexico, about 
185 miles south of the Texas border. 
In the early morning hours of Feb- 
ruary 8, 1969, a meteor brighter than 
the full moon was seen over an area 
of almost a million square miles. 
Locally, this was accompanied by 
powerful sonic booms. The object 
producing these phenomena frag- 
mented in the atmosphere and 
thousands of stone meteorites fell 
to earth, covering an area of 



more than a hundred square miles. 

For weeks following the event, 
scientists from numerous institu- 
tions in Mexico, the United States, 
and Canada converged on the area 
and, with the help of local resi- 
dents, recovered hundreds of 
pounds of material for scientific in- 
vestigations and museum collec- 
tions. When material found by pri- 
vate and commercial collectors is 
added, scientists estimate that 
more than two tons of meteorite 
fragments have been removed from 
the region, and undoubtedly much 
still remains to be found. Thus the 
Allende meteorite represented the 
largest known stone meteorite fall 
up until that time, possibly ex- 
ceeded only by the fall of the ap- 
proximately three-ton Kirin mete- 
orite in China in 1976. 

We have known for almost two 
decades that the minerals that make 
up almost all meteorites are 4.5 bil- 
lion years old and date back to the 
general period of time in which the 
sun and the planets were formed. 
We have also known that meteor- 
ite fragments could not have had 
their present small dimensions of 
about three feet or less for more 
than the last few million years. 
This is clearly shown by the fact 
that meteorites contain only a lim- 
ited quantity of the inert gas iso- 
topes produced by nuclear bom- 
bardment by energetic galactic cos- 
mic rays. Measurement of these 
nuclear reaction products permits 
calculation of the &quot;cosmic ray ex- 
posure age&quot;&quot; of the meteorite. Stone 
meteorites typically have exposure 
ages of less than 20 million years. 
The longest exposure interval 
found is about 100 million years, 



102 



by George W. Wetherill 



the shortest is only 19,000 years. 
Prior to those times, relatively re- 
cent compared with the age of the 
solar system, the meteorites must 
have been in the interior of a larger 
body, one at least large enough to 
shield the meteorite from the 
effects of galactic cosmic rays. 

The precise identity of these 
larger &quot;parent bodies&quot; is not well 
understood at present. Most 
workers believe they are asteroidal 
bodies, either the minor planets 
that populate the region between 
Mars and Jupiter or the nearer 
rocky planetoids known as Apollo 
and Amor objects, which approach 
the orbit of the earth and moon and 
are our nearest neighbors in inter- 
planetary space. Another possibil- 
ity is that at least some meteorites 
are residues of comets that have 
lost their volatile ices by repeated 
approaches to the sun. All of these 
diminutive solar system objects are 
suflRciently small to have escaped 
the effects of the thermal and at- 
mospheric geologic processes that 
have erased the primordial record 
from the rocks of larger and more 
active planets such as the earth. 
Mars, and the moon. 

For these reasons we expected 
that, like other meteorites, studies 
of the Allende meteorite would pro- 
vide data relevant to the formation 
of the solar system. The actual re- 
sults, however, soon far exceeded 
these expectations. 

Simple macroscopic examination 
of the Allende specimens showed 
that this was not a typical stone 
meteorite. It consists of a fine- 
grained, rather opaque matrix in 
which are embedded numerous in- 
clusions of various kinds. Many

closely resemble the tiny spherical 
globules called chondrules that are 
found in the most abundant type of 
stone meteorite — the chondrites. 
But far more significant were some 
unusually large (up to about one 
inch in diameter), whitish globules 
and chemically related, large 
amoeba-shaped, fine-grained aggre- 
gates of foreign material. Studies of 
these inclusions carried out in 1969 
at Argonne National Laboratory 
and at the Smithsonian Astrophysi- 
cal Observatory revealed a chemi- 
cal composition very different from 
the solar system composition gen- 
erally found in chondritic meteor- 
ites, in main-sequence stars, and in 
the sun. 

This average solar system com- 
position can be simply described. 
First, there are those elements 
abundant in stars but greatly de- 
pleted in meteorites as a conse- 
quence of the volatility of their 
usual chemical form, namely, hy- 
drogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen, 
and oxygen. Next are the most 
abundant elements that form non- 
volatile mineral compounds — mag- 
nesium, iron (alloyed iron and 
nickel), and silicon. The last three 
elements, together with the oxygen 
with which they are combined, con- 
stitute 80 to 90 percent of almost 
all stone meteorites, including bulk 
specimens of Allende. Finally, 
there is another group of three ele- 
ments less abundant by a factor of 
about ten — calcium, aluminum, and 
sodium. With the exception of the 
rather volatile element sulfur, all 
other elements are less abundant 
by an additional factor of about ten 
or more. 

In the large and/or irregular Al- 
lende inclusions, however, the 
usual abundance of calcium and 
aluminum relative to iron and mag- 
nesium is reversed. The generally 
minor elements are the most abun- 
dant. (As would be expected, the 
mineral assemblages in the inclu- 
sions are also highly unusual. The 
most abundant minerals are such 
meteoritic rarities as melilite, pe- 
rovskite, spinel, grossular garnet, 
hibonite, and pyroxene rich in 
aluminum and titanium, all com- 
posed primarily of calcium, alumi- 
num, silicon, and oxygen.) 

Mineralogical investigators 
quickly recognized that these rare 
substances were the very minerals 
that had been theoretically calcu- 
lated to be the earliest condensates 



to form during the cooling of a 
primitive high-temperature (about 
2,000°K) nebula of average solar 
composition. Taken with other evi- 
dence for the primitive nature of 
the Allende meteorite, this led to a 
widely held opinion that these small 
fragments are actual samples of the 
first solid material to condense 
from the primitive nebula of dust 
and gas from which the sun and 
planets were formed. 

Investigators soon also recog- 
nized that the Allende meteorite 
was not a freak of some kind but 
was simply a larger and more avail- 
able representative of a minor, but 
fairly common, type of meteorite. 
Eight other examples are known 
and all of them contain high-tem- 
perature inclusions, that is, min- 
erals predicted to form at high tem- 
peratures. In fact, these meteorites 
had already been classified as a 
subtype of carbonaceous chon- 
drites, and their high-temperature 
inclusions had been identified as 
early as 1961. Widespread recogni- 
tion of the significance of these 
inclusions, however, did not come 
about until after the more generally 
known work with Allende. 

The interpretation of these inclu- 
sions as early condensates now ap- 
pears likely to be an oversimplifi- 
cation. There is good, if not alto- 
gether compelling, evidence that 
the minerals in these high-tempera- 
ture inclusions condensed first as 
liquids and then as solids, rather 
than being direct condensates from 
a gaseous phase. In addition, some 
anomalous low-temperature min- 
erals such as sodalite were also 
found in these inclusions. Further- 
more, the reality of a high-tempera- 
ture solar nebula of the sort envi- 
sioned by meteorite investigators 
has been seriously questioned by 
some theoretical astrophysicists. 
It is quite possible that the chemical 
identification of a high-temperature 
component in the early solar sys- 
tem will survive questioning, but 
the mineralogical identification of 
the inclusions with direct conden- 
sation from the solar nebula may 
have to be abandoned. Like many 
of the other remarkable properties 
of this meteorite, the formation of 
the inclusions is poorly understood 
at present. 

The most marvelous discoveries 
resulting from investigations of the 
Allende meteorite have come from 
highly accurate measurements of

1979 Is the eighth year in which we 
operate our extremely successful 
cruises in privately chartered ships lo 
the Galapagos Islands off Ecuador; 
and we are the only company which 
offers leisurely cruises designed for 
the discerning traveler who is inter- 
ested in ecology, wildlife and photog- 
raphy. 

AM other cruises have become shorter 
and superficial, in order to cram as 
many people as possible into the ships&apos; 
schedules. 

For budget-minded travelers we repeat 
our popular

the isotopic composition of its con- 
stituent elements. At first, these 
measurements seemed interesting 
and readily understandable. The 
intimate association of high-tem- 
perature inclusions with more usual 
low-temperature material in the 
matrix was evidence that the mete- 
orite was an unmetamorphosed and 
hence primitive object. Therefore, 
investigators were not surprised 
when radioactive-dating methods 
showed the Allende meteorite to be 
4.5 billion years old — essentially 
the age of the solar system itself. 
Several laboratories reported that 
the meteorite contained strontium 
of primitive isotopic composition, 
as well as other now extinct, rela- 
tively short-lived radioisotopes as- 
sumed to have existed in the early 
solar system. The discovery of such 
extinct radioisotopes in other mete- 
orites was made as long ago as 
1960 and formed the apparently 
firm basis for a galactic chronology. 
According to this timetable the last 
addition to the solar system of iso- 
topes synthesized in the interior of 
stars took place about 100 million 
years before the formation of the 
meteorites, the planets, and the 
sun. 

All findings seemed to be com- 
patible until 1973 when Robert 
Clayton of the University of Chi- 
cago discovered variations in the 
isotopic composition of oxygen in 
Allende&apos;s calcium-rich inclusions. 
The ratio of two oxygen Isotopes — 
&apos;&apos;O and &quot;^O — to each other had 
been measured in many meteorites 
and terrestrial rocks in order to 
determine the temperatures at 
which the material had formed by 
means of the small but calculable 
diiferences in the chemical proper- 
ties of these two isotopes. It was 
not customary to measure the 
amount of a third stable isotope of 
oxygen — &apos;&apos;&apos;O — since the chemical 
variation in the ratio of &quot;O to &apos;^O 
was typically one-half the variation 
in the ratio of &quot;&apos;O to &apos;*0. Hence no 
new information appeared to be ob- 
tainable by this procedure. Never- 
theless, Clayton did measure both 
ratios in the Allende inclusions with 
the surprising result that the varia- 
tion in the ratio of &apos;^O to &apos;&quot;O was 
the same as that of &apos;*0 to &apos;&quot;O, in- 
stead of being half as large. 

This finding implied that the phe- 
nomenon was a nuclear rather than 
a chemical effect. Evidently, in ad- 
dition to the usual chemically in- 



Thinner Wallets 

Until recently the thinnest wallets 
were made from expensive seal skins. 
Then a new material was developed — 
Oxford Nylon. Pin Craft Corporation 
patented a unique line of wallets out of 
this durable woven material. Con- 
sumers&apos; Research Magazine did an 
extensive study on wallets and con- 
cluded by giving their top recommen- 
dation to Oxford Nylon wallets. Oxford 
Nylon does not have the thickness of 
leather, yet it is more durable, lighter, 
longer wearing, flexible and very thin. 
Thus the Oxford Nylon wallet is more 
comfortable to wear, and your clothes 
look better without a wallet bulge.,

duced variations in the oxygen 
isotope ratios, a component of pure 
&quot;&apos;O was present in amounts that 
varied from one microscopic min- 
eral grain of the inclusion to an- 
other. Unexplained nuclear varia- 
tions in the isotopic abundance of 
such rare elements as neon and 
xenon were known to occur in 
meteorites. For such extremely 
rare elements, very small quanti- 
ties of isotopically distinct material 
are sufficient to produce measur- 
able isotopic differences. But oxy- 
gen atoms make up about 60 per- 
cent of the atoms in the Allende in- 
clusion. The approximately 4 per- 
cent &quot;&apos;O enrichment found by Clay- 
ton was thus a gross effect, which 
would be easily visible to the naked 
eye if the added &quot;&apos;O were, for ex- 
ample, of a different color from the 
&quot;normal&quot; oxygen in the minerals 
of the inclusion. 

The determination of this oxygen 
isotopic anomaly was followed in 
1975 by isotopic anomalies in mag- 
nesium, again a major chemical 
constituent of the Allende material. 
This discovery, reported by 
workers at both CalTech and the 
Australian National University in 
Canberra, had two implications not 
shared by the oxygen isotopic ef- 
fects. The enrichment in isotopic 
magnesium was shown to be caused 
by the decay of a radioactive alumi- 
num isotope with a half-life of only 
0.7 million years, which had there- 
fore been present in quite signifi- 
cant quantities in the inclusion 
when it was formed. Researchers 
had long speculated that this radio- 
isotope was the source of the un- 
explained heat that metamorphosed 
and melted meteorite parent bodies 
soon after their formation. Al- 
though the quantitative role of this 
heat source remains to be deter- 
mined, its existence is no longer an 
ad hoc speculation. Also, the very 
short half-life of isotopic aluminum 
threatens to upset the well-estab- 
lished, more than 100-million-year 
chronological time scale based on 
the extinct short-lived radioisotopes 
referred to earlier. It is hard to see 
how significant quantities of a 
radioisotope with a half-life of less 
than a million years could have sur- 
vived a 100-milIion-year hiatus in 
the addition of newly synthesized 
nuclear material to the solar sys- 
tem. 

The effects found in oxygen and 
magnesium were soon followed by 



106 



the discovery of many other iso- 
topic anomalies in major elements, 
such as silicon, and in rare ele- 
ments, such as barium and samar- 
ium. Some of these anomalies are 
of nuclear origin, others appear to 
be chemical; some correlate with 
one another, others do not. 

Attempts to reconcile these new 
facts have led investigators to sug- 
gest that the isotopic anomalies in 
the Allende meteorite are carried 
by interstellar grains that survived 
the formation of the solar system. 
Other theorists have gone further 
and speculated that these grains 
were formed in a supernova explo- 
sion that triggered the formation of 
the solar system. Observational evi- 
dence for such supernova-triggered 
star formation has recently been 
found by two investigators at the 
Carnegie Institution of Washing- 
ton&apos;s Department of Terrestrial 
Magnetism. 

Regardless of the fate of these 
interesting speculations, the con- 
cept of a well-mixed homogeneous 
solar nebula has been badly shaken. 
Furthermore, still another discov- 
ery — nuggets of nearly pure noble 
metals in Allende inclusions — is 
hard to reconcile with the hypothe- 
sis that these metals were involved 
in condensation from a high-tem- 
perature solar nebula. The problem 
is explaining how these different 
metals could have formed at high 
temperature without alloying with 
each other. 

These complex phenomena may 
appear to have decreased the pros- 
pect of our understanding the early 
solar system. More accurately, 
what is really happening is that 
theoreticians concerned with deter- 
mining the evolution of stars and 
planets must now confront the real- 
ity of star and planet formation. 
Prior to the existence of these new 
results, the simplest explanation of 
the formation of the solar system 
was deemed the most desirable. We 
have now been liberated from that 
precept. Long ago, Faraday said, 
&quot;Nothing is too wonderful to be 
true.&quot; The real world is turning 
out to be more wonderful and com- 
plex than was imagined before the 
evidence provided by the Allende 
meteorite.

the Department of Terrestrial 
Magnetism of the Carnegie Insti-

The Natural World of the Big 
Thicket, photographs by Blair 
Pittman. Texas A&amp;M University 
Press. $22.50; 128 pp.. illiis. 

Blair Pittman spent ten years or 
so inside the preserve and out, 
searching for his own natural world 
of the Big Thicket. With the pa- 
tience of an artist he stalked flow- 
ers, animals, reptiles, and waited 
for the right moment, the right light 
before he pressed the release. His 



patience was rewarded with photo- 
graphs in some instances realistic 
enough to be used for identifica- 
tion, in some, impressionistic 
enough to be wholly satisfying as 
photographic art. Some in their 
underlying statement go beyond 
either. The sequence of the snake 
swallowing the frog, for instance, is 
a chilling reminder that in nature 
there has to be both predator and 
prey. Sympathy rises for the fawn, 
beautiful and defenseless in a world 



of predators. The alligator relieves 
the fierceness of jaws and teeth a 
little by what appears to be a smile. 
The eye of the camera sees what 
it sees. The vision of the artist 
photographer determines the focus. 
Blair Pittman let his vision range 
widely over the Big Thicket and 
the pictures in this book provide a 
record not likely to be repeated.

search activities have included 
studies of amphibians, reptiles, al- 
batrosses, and sea elephants, in 
addition to an early, continuing 
interest in cetaceans. For fifteen 
years (1951 to 1966) he was scien- 
tific director of the Zoological So- 
ciety of London. A number of his 
whale papers — the most recent of 
which dates from forty years ago — 
are cited in the references. 

In the opening chapter, &quot;Cetol- 
ogy from Its Beginnings to 1945,&quot; 
Matthews offers a balanced, con- 
nected summary, starting with the 
amazing contributions of Aristotle 
more than twenty-three centuries 
ago. Then, after acknowledging the 
contributions of a score of inter- 
mediate naturalists, he describes 
the Scottish whaling captain William 
Scoresby as &quot;the first scientific man 
to know anything about the larger 
whales as living animals.&quot; Mat- 
thews accurately calls Scoresby&apos;s 
two-volume Account of the Arctic 
Regions (1820) &quot;of great impor- 
tance [marking] a turning point in 
the scientific study of the oceans 
and their inhabitants — especially 
the whales.&quot; Even today most of 
what we know of the Greenland 
right or bowhead whale may be 
found in Scoresby&apos;s writings. 

The bibliography reflects a num- 
ber of scientific reports from the 
Whales Research Institute in 
Tokyo, which has published an 
annual report since 1948. But the 
papers, and the work of the Insti- 
tute under the direction of Dr. 
Hideo Omura, receive scant men- 
tion in the text. Similarly, the con- 
tributions to our knowledge of 
whales of fifty-seven years of pub- 
lication of the Norsk Hvalfangsttid. 
(Norwegian Whaling Gazette) are 
reflected in only four references. 
Yet as important as it is, the British 
contribution to the subject is gen- 
erally overrated. 

Matthews writes of the &quot;dramatic 
noises&quot; of the humpback whale, 
noting &quot;there is no reason for sup- 
posing that they are songs in the 
human connotation of the word any 
more than are the songs of birds or 
cicadas or the braying of jack- 
asses.&quot; The authors of the paper 
Songs of Humpback Whales 
(Science, vol. 173) were care*&apos;&apos;il to 
point out that &quot;spectrogr 
analysis shows . . . that a 
longed vocalizations occur

few minutes. Because one of the 
characteristics of bird songs is that 
they are fixed patterns of sounds 
that are repeated, we call the fixed 
patterns of humpback sounds 
&apos;songs.&apos; The principal differences 
between bird and humpback songs 
are that bird songs usually last for 
a few seconds, while humpback 
songs last for minutes. . . .&quot; No 
human connotation was suggested 
in the paper, and Matthews&apos;s refer- 
ence remains a puzzle. 

In another place, Matthews refers 
to Scammon&apos;s Lagoon — the most 
northerly of the lagoons in Baja 
California that are mating and calv- 
ing grounds of the California gray 
whale after an 8,000-mile migration 
to and from the Arctic — as &quot;now 
sunk to the ignominy of a tourist 
attraction.&quot; Not so. The Mexican 
government has banned tourist 
boats from Scammon&apos;s for some 
time, although they may enter other 
lagoons. Visitors to San Ignacio and 
Magdalena numbered about 1,000 
in 1978, and most showed restraint 
in watching whales and visiting the 
fragile habitats along the shore. In 
the last sentence of the book, Mat- 
thews castigates &quot;the depredations 
of too enthusiastic whale-lovers,&quot; 
but nowhere does he use strong 
language to describe the depreda- 
tions of the whaling industry. 

For instance, Matthews writes, 
&quot;As all the world knows, man is by 
far the greatest predator on the 
cetaceans, and is now by the aid of 
modern technology overcropping 
them [italics mine]. . . .&quot; The &quot;is 
now&quot; phrase implies a recent phe- 
nomenon, but &quot;overcropping&quot; (far 
too quaint a word for the slaughter 
that went virtually unchecked until 
this decade) has been going forward 
for more than half a century. 

He notes a dawning awareness of 
&quot;the damage . . . inflicted upon the 
stocks of animals that can have an 
important place in [the] economy.&quot; 
No other value but &quot;preserving 
them for future use&quot; is part of his 
calculation. Even if we view whales 
through a strictly economic lens — 
not taking into account their place 
in the oceans&apos; habitats, knowledge 
yet to be gained, and the value of 
the whale qua whale — the ironic 
fact is that recreational interest in 
whales (mainly through visits to 
aquariums but also whale watching 
from the edge of land and in little 
boats) has nearly surpassed whale 
killing as an economic force.

The Natural World of the 
Texas Big Thicket 

Photograph.^ by Blair Pittman 
Introduction by William A. Owens 

Nature has been astonishingly prodigal 
in Texas&apos; Big Thicket. The teeming vari- 
ety of its plant and animal life make it a 
naturalist&apos;s paradise, an ecologiciJ sys- 
tem unique in the United States. In 98 
breathtaking color photographs Pittman 
presents a magnificent \isual record of 
the natural world of the Big Thicket.

Matthews&apos;s view of the Japanese 
interest in whales is out of date. He 
says, &quot;Japan places more impor- 
tance on whale meat than whale oil 
in the effort to feed its large popu- 
lation denied by Japanese geogra- 
phy an adequate home production 
of animal protein.&quot; Sounds good, 
but the facts dispute this assertion. 
In recent years, the baleen whales — 
which were taken chiefly for their 
meat — have dwindled to nominal 
importance with the exception of 
the little Minke whale, and the 
catch comprises largely sperm 
whales, most of which arejuveniles. 
Sperm whale meat is not considered 
palatable by the Japanese, so the 
hunt for the remaining young sperm 
whales proceeds for other commer- 
cial reasons, not to provide protein 
for the populace. 

The author questions the idea of 
&quot;group feeding&quot;&quot; among cetaceans 
but seems unaware of the coopera- 
tive behavior suggested by the 
&quot;bubble curtain&quot;&quot; first described by 
Jurasz. Humpbacks in Glacier Bay 
have been observed laying down a 
screen of bubbles to contain herring 
and then to feed upon them, one 
whale at a time, in rapid succession. 
Matthews does, however, skillfully 
debunk some prevailing hypotheses 
for &quot;the strange phenomenon of 
mass stranding which occurs from 
time to time in several species of 
odontocetes&quot;: sonic disorientation 
in shallow water: parasitic worm in 
the middle or inner ear; obscurity of 
sandy or muddy water: an inexpli- 
cable panic communicated through 
a school. He notes that mass strand- 
ing often did not involve sudden 
panic but was rather a persistent, 
deliberate shoreward movement. 
An explanation emerges from one 
of his examples: errant or faltering 
leadership could contribute to mass 
stranding. Another example is 
found in a UPI newspaper account 
of July 29, 1976, describing a school 
of twenty-nine false killer whales 
that stranded at Loggerhead Key. 
Florida, behind an old leader, were 
pulled off shore, and then appar- 
ently followed a new leader. 

On behavioral questions about 
dolphins, Matthews seems to have 
little personal experience, culling 
his information from a narrow stripe 
of published materials. For exam- 
ple, he refers to the &quot;docility of 
dolphins toward their keepers once 
they have got to know them.&quot; Ex- 
perience shows otherwise. The dol- 



phin is outwardly docile from the 
moment of capture when it is lifted 
by a sling to a holding tank on the 
deck of a boat, but it seems to go 
through its entire sonic repertoire — 
trying to deal with an utterly trau- 
matic experience. Dolphins are ini- 
tially very shy in captivity (to call 
recent captives &quot;wild&quot; and old cap- 
tives &quot;tame&quot; is inappropriate), and 
any later rambunctiousness seems 
to arise from interactions with hu- 
mans and the tiny, sterile world of 
confinement. 

While the author shows little 
interest in the whale brain (and 
ignores the series of impressive 
monographs on the dolphin brain 
compiled by Morgane, Jacobs, and 
McFarland), he writes of the whale 
penis with zest. The first illustra- 
tion in this book, for example, is an 
early engraving of a sperm whale 
stranded at Scheveningen in the 
Netherlands (1598): &quot;it does cor- 
rectly show the great size of the 
penis, the beauties of which a 
gentleman is pointing out to his 
girlfriend: someone has long ago 
prudishly &apos;painted out&quot; this mag- 
nificent member in the Rijksmuseum 
picture.&quot; Also, in referring to a 
work published in 1685 by John 
Ray. he concludes that the figure of 
the sperm whale is a copy of &quot;the 
Scheveningen whale in all its mas- 
culinity, no doubt to the interest 
and ribaldjoy of Samuel Pepys, who 
paid for the engraving of the plate.&quot; 

Matthews seeks by a variety of 
means to disparage the possibility 
of cetacean intelligence. For exam- 
ple, &quot;Although the brain of the 
cetaceans is large and shows a com- 
plexity of development of the cere- 
bral cortex, there is no reason for 
supposing that the cetacean capac- 
ity for learning is associated with 
intelligence.&quot;&quot; Much remains to be 
learned about the nature of intelli- 
gence in man. and yet his comment 
seems to contradict how we define 
intelligence, namely, the capacity 
for learning. And how can the 
prickly topic of intelligence be 
raised without mentioning the per- 
son whose work, writings, and the- 
ories got the discussion going? A 
medical scientist. John Lilly, has 
transformed the way scientist and 
layman alike think about whales 
and dolphins. The mosaic for under- 
standing their intelligence is incom- 
plete, but Lilly is one of those 
occasional persons in the annals of 
science who has postulated a truly

revolutionary, radical view of how 
we think about ourselves in relation 
to the natural world. The hypothe- 
sis, still not adequately demon- 
strated, is that we are not alone. 
The possibility of other intelligent 
species, the cetaceans, is worthy of 
discussion — and first-class empiri- 
cal research. 

In a small book it is not easy to 
select examples of new research 
and strike a balance, especially in 
the burgeoning field of cetacean 
bioacoustics. Certain important 
gaps do occur in Matthews&apos;s book, 
such as the omission of Watkins&apos;s 
splendid research that led to a de- 
tailed analysis of an elegant click 
exchange between two sperm 
whales. But in spite of the fore- 
going reservations, Matthews has 
written a good whale book, which 
is a formidable accomplishment. 

Scott McVay has had an active 
interest in whale research and 
conservation for fifteen years and 
has led two expeditions to the Arctic 
to study the rare bowhead whale.

At the Museum 



New York City&apos;s newspaper 
strike meant that fewer casual 
viewers joined the devotees of an- 
thropological films at the second 
annual Margaret Mead Film Festi- 
val, held for five days at the Ameri- 
can Museum of Natural History in 
mid-September, and featuring more 
than 125 films. In only a year, the 
festival has become an important 
forum for anthropologists, film- 
makers interested in ethnographic 
material, students, and others se- 
riously interested in developments 
in anthropological film. The quieter 
character of this year&apos;s festival 
paralleled that of Jorge Preloran, 
the Argentinian filmmaker hon- 
ored. 

On the first three festival eve- 
nings prior to the weekend, the 
dignified, solid-looking Preloran 
personally presented some of his 
films, including his latest, Zerdo&apos;s 
Children. His best-known work, 
Imaginero (&quot;The Image Maker,&quot; 
1969) is extremely beautiful, a re- 
minder that Preloran was a painter 
who went on to study architecture. 
He classifies Imaginero as &quot;a por- 
trait of a man I loved,&quot; whereas 
The Wcircio (1974), shown the sec- 
ond night, is what he considers his 
attempt to make an ethnographic 
film about a peaceful Venezuelan 
Indian tribe. Not all the audience 
agreed with Margaret Mead, who 
described The Warao as &quot;baskets. 
baskets, baskets.&quot; But the film did 
raise questions about Preloran&apos;s 
seemingly omniscient and omnipre- 
sent point of view. Does he antici- 
pate action or does he follow it? &quot;I 
don&apos;t know what I do,&quot; replied 
Preloran, inconclusively. &quot;The 
camera moves and I go with it.&quot; 

Like Preloran, more filmmakers 
who are not trained ethnographers 
are being drawn to ethnographic 
material. Ethnographer or profes- 
sional filmmaker, anyone who takes 
up a camera must make choices — 
of good cuts and of cuts that tell the 

122 



truth in ethnographic terms or, in- 
creasingly, in political terms. The 
mixed results, and the reactions of 
different audiences, dominated 
formal and informal festival dis- 
cussions, over lectern or water 
fountain. 

Commentary reflected the history 
and changing nature of anthropo- 
logical film, as outlined during 
Margaret Mead and Malcolm Arth&apos;s 
Saturday morning symposium on 
trance. The first anthropological 
films were either research footage 
or attempts to convey to the public 
a sense of a culture. Especially in 
the second case, distortions were 
inevitable, but could be anticipated. 

The first Saturday film was Mead 
and Gregory Bateson&apos;s Trance 
and Dance in Bali, filmed in 
1938 with techniques one observer 
called &quot;hand-held Brownie.&quot; This 
data-gathering film tries to show 
exactly what happens during a par- 
ticular Balinese dance whose par- 
ticipants go into trance, stab them- 
selves, yet suffer no wounds. 

The second film, Bali: The Mask 
of Rangda (1975), by filmmakers 
Harvey Bellin and Elda Hartley, 
shows the same dance in lush 
color. Its heavy emphasis on Jung- 
ian symbolism in the ritual drew 
salty comments from Mead, but the 
photography did provide details of 
masks and a witch&apos;s long fluttering 
fingernails that could not be ap- 
preciated in the earlier version. The 
third film, Puerto Rican Espi- 
ritisino in the South Bronx (1978), 
was made by a group of Mead&apos;s 
Columbia University students, who 
earned high marks for their respect- 
ful portrait of a medium at work. 

The question of whether these 
recent experiments contribute to 
the forward march of anthropology 
and more accurate filmmaking 
dominated Mead and Arth&apos;s Sun- 
day symposium on &quot;Truth and Fact 
in Film.&quot; Mead distinguished be- 
tween what she called the &quot;Ameri- 



can idea&quot; of truth as a sum of 
known facts, and truth &quot;in the Rus- 
sian sense,&quot; an emotional certainty 
that transcends facts. The case in 
point was filmmaker Joel Freed- 
man&apos;s Broken Treaty at Battle 
Mountain (1974), about the struggle 
of the Shoshone to regain rights 
to parts of western Nevada. Freed- 
man became interested in the 
Indians&apos; protest after learning that 
the Bureau of Land Management 
harvested pifion trees, whose nuts 
the tribe gathers, by uprooting 
them with a ship&apos;s chain studded 
with railroad ties and dragged be- 
tween two tractors. Several facts 
that Freedman omitted or clouded 
did not weaken his case for the 
validity of the Indian cause. 

Freedman, like many other par- 
ticipants, could not say what he 
might contribute to next year&apos;s fes- 
tival. Preloran, who regularly takes 
several years to complete a film, is 
cutting a portrait of an Argentinian 
puppeteer. Others are trying to lo- 
cate their next grant. Polly Spiegel, 
a young anthropologist who is 
studying filmmaking at New York 
University, predicted that anthro- 
pologists and filmmakers will have 
to continue discussing the pros and 
cons of collaboration. &quot;Right now, 
there are few ethical or methodo- 
logical standards for anthropologi- 
cal film, and these must be clarified 
soon.&quot; 

November Events 

On Wednesday, November 15, at 
7:30 P.M., Stephen Jay Gould, who 
writes a monthly column, &quot;This 
View of Life,&quot; for Natural His- 
tory, will give an illustrated lecture 
in the Museum auditorium on 
&quot;Size and Shape: Why the Moon 
has Craters, No Insect is Larger 
than a Mouse, and Tall Churches 
are Narrow.&quot; Admission is $2 for 
Associate Members and the public, 
free to other members.

Authors 



A reporter for the Berkshire 
Eagle in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, 
Stephen Fay came upon the salmon 
story in the course of his regular 
reporting. He writes that &quot;the town 
of New Marlborough, where much 
of the crucial work of Atlantic 
salmon restoration is taking place, 
happened to lie within my beat. 
When the first returnee was brought 
to the hatchery, I went up to check 
it out. Then I started to get in- 
volved.&quot; Fay, who has an M.A. in 
history from Holy Names College 
in Oakland, California, is planning 
to write a history of the entire effort 
to restore Atlantic salmon to the 
rivers of New England. 





Alan D. Hart, who has tramped 
over much of the islands of Maui, 
Kuai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, and 
Hawaii in search of nearly extinct 
plants and animals, calls Hawaii &quot;the 
endangered species capital of the 
world.&quot; He has concentrated his 
fieldwork on the archipelago&apos;s tree 
snails, particularly the genus 
Achatinella. Hart is preparing a re- 
port and petition for the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service&apos;s OflRce of En- 
dangered Species on his tree snail 
survey of Oahu. He writes that he 
will &quot;nominate all the living species 
of Achatinella for endangered 
species status.&quot; Hart works as a 
scientific illustrator for the Smith- 
sonian Institution, a position he 
previously held at the Bernice P. 
Bishop Museum in Honolulu. 



&quot;I like bones,&quot; says anthro- 
pologist Erik TVinkaus, who has 
worked with Neanderthal fossil re- 
mains for the past five years. In the 
belief that much behavioral infor- 
mation can be derived from the 
analysis of human fossils, he is 
busy studying skeletal remains 
from Huaca Prieta, Peru, to deter- 
mine the influence of agriculture on 
the human skeleton. He also plans 
to engage in further excavations at 
Iraq&apos;s Shanidar Cave. Trinkaus ob- 
tained his Ph.D. from the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania and is an 
associate professor in the anthro- 
pology department at Harvard 
University. 




IF YOU&apos;RE GOING TO BUY AN 

EASY-TO-USE CAMERA, MAKE SURE 

ITS REALLY EASY TO USE. 



Like many of the new, compact 35mm reflex 
cameras, the Minolta XG-7 is automatic. You 
simply point, focus and shoot. The XG-7 sets 
the shutter speed up to 1 /1000th of a sec- 
ond. And you get perfectly exposed pic- 
tures, automatically 

But easy operation is more than just auto- 
matic exposure. Here&apos;s what to look for 
when you compare cameras at your photo 
dealer. 

Easy focusing. The XG-7&apos;s viewfinder is 
big and bright, even in the corners. Your 
subject snaps into critical sharpness. 

It&apos;s easy to be creative. You can make the 
automatic exposure setting brighter or 
darker for creative effects. 

An easy-to-understand electronic view- 
finder. Light emitting diodes tell how the 
XG-7 is setting Itself and warn against under- 
or over-exposure. 

An easy-to-see electronic self-timer. The 
self-timer lets you get into your own pic- 



tures. It&apos;s a large flashing light mounted on 
the front of the camera. The flashing speeds 
up when the picture is about to be taken. 
An easier-to-use auto winder. It automati- 
cally advances film, 
as fast as two pic- 
tures a second You 
attach the optional 
Auto Winder G with- 
out having to remove 
(or lose) any caps 
from the XG-7 

The easier-to-be- 
creative flash. The 
optional H/linolta Auto 
Electroflash 200X 
synchronizes contin- 
uously with the 
winder. This feature 
allows you to take a sequence of up to 36 
flash pictures in about 18 seconds. 
The important &quot;little&quot; extras. The XG-7 







has a window that shows when film is ad- 
vancing properly. A memo holder holds the 
end of a film box as a remmder. There&apos;s even 
an optional remote control cord. 

Fast, easy handling. The way a camera 
feels has a lot to do with how easy it is to use. 
Is it comfortable or awkward? Are the con- 
trols placed where your fingers naturally fall, 
or are they cramped together&apos;^&apos; The M\noHa 
XG-7 is human engineered for comfort and 
smooth handling. It&apos;s quiet, with a solid feel- 
ing you find only in much more expensive 
equipment. 

Easy-to-change lenses. Remove or at- 
tach lenses with less than a quarter turn. 
And a system of almost 40 different lenses, 
from fisheye to super-telephoto, makes the 
XG-7 a key to virtually unlimited creativity. 

Try the Minolta XG-7. At your dealer. Or 
write for literature to t^/linolta Corp., 101 Wil- 
liams Dr, Ramsey, N.J. 07446. In Canada: 
Minolta Camera (Canada) Inc., Ont.

John D. Palmer has frequently 
contributed articles on biological 
rhythms to Natural History (&quot;How 
a Bird Tells the Time of Day,&quot; 
March 1966; &quot;The Many Clocks of 
Man,&quot; April 1970; &quot;The Rhythm of 
the Flowers,&quot; August 1971). Since 
1960, he has spent most summers at 
the Marine Biological Laboratory 
at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, 
where he is now concentrating on 
biological rhythms in unicells and 
crabs. He is chairman of the zo- 
ology department at the University 
of Massachusetts at Amherst, 
where his coauthor, Judith E. 
Goodenough, is a lecturer in zo- 
ology. She plans to move on from 
her studies of monthly rhythms in 
planarians and ant lions to look for 
evidence of similar rhythms in 
hamsters and to investigate light 
sensitivity in guppies. 






Professor of biology at Princeton 
University, John Tyler Bonner has 
worked on the development of cel- 
lular slime molds since 1939. 
&quot;Looking for a good organism on 
which to do research in develop- 
mental biology,&quot; he says, &quot;I settled 
on Dictyosteliiim discoideum,&apos;^ a 
species of cellular slime mold that 
had been discovered only four years 
earlier. As part of his continuing 
interest in problems of evolution, 
he has just completed a book. The 
Biological Basis of Culture. Bonner 
summers in Margaree Harbor, in 
southern Nova Scotia, spending the 
time left over from writing in walk- 
ing and fishing, with which he is in- 
fatuated. &quot;La peche est ma folic,&quot; 
as he puts it.

A New Plague of Locusts 



I 



by Christopher F. Hemming 



Heavy rains and war may 
trigger a life cycle that 
will launch swarms of locusts 
into African and Asian skies 

Conditions are now ripe for a new 
plague of desert locusts that could 
extend across all of North Africa, 
through the Arabian Peninsula, and 
into India by the end of 1979. Un- 
usually heavy monsoon and desert 
rainfall, civil war in Ethiopia, and 
the locust&apos;s own special biology 
make such a plague possible if not 
likely. This past autumn, swarms of 
locusts migrated westward from 
India to settle in Iran, Saudi Arabia, 
and perhaps, on the west bank of 
the Red Sea. Meanwhile, swarms 
that hatched in late summer in east 
Africa have bred during the autum- 
nal rains in Ethiopia and Somalia, 
and their young should invade 
Kenya in January or February of 
1979. By next summer, billions of 
desert locusts may be swarming to- 
ward western Africa. 

The chances of a desert locust 
plague are not surprising to locust 
watchers like myself, who saw ex- 
cellent breeding conditions develop 
during heavy rainfalls in the Mid- 
east in October 1977. Locusts breed 
most successfully in wet weather, 
even in the light desert rains. They 
are blown by strong, prevailing 
winds to warm, damp, vegetated 
places where they settle, feed, and 
reproduce. 

Although such locust-control or- 
ganizations as the Centre for Over- 
seas Pest Research and various re- 
gional groups know that a plague 



might be imminent, there is little 
they can do to counter the threat. 
Over the years of combating lo- 
custs in order to protect agriculture, 
scientists have discovered that, out- 
side of nature itself, the most effec- 
tive means of locust control is the 
use of aircraft to spray the insecti- 
cide dieldrin over swarms of 
hoppers (nonflying young desert lo- 
custs). But in 1977 and 1978, north- 
ern Ethiopia&apos;s coastal area, where 
the insects were breeding rapidly, 
was closed off to control teams by 
warfare between two factions fight- 
ing over Eritrea. To the southeast, 
the war between Somalia and 
Ethiopia also limited control ac- 
tivities. To speak anthropomorphi-

be equally serious owing to 

ideal breeding conditions. 



cally, one could say the desert lo- 
cust could not have chosen a better 
time and place to begin an upsurge 
than Ethiopia in the late 1970s. 

The first swarm of desert locusts, 
indicating the coming of a plague, 
was reported in Saudi Arabia in 
December 1977. Greater than usual 
rainfall continued and in January 
and February 1978, locust breeding 
increased in Saudi Arabia, the 
Yemen Arab Republic, Ethiopia, 
Somalia, and Sudan. Another gen- 
eration appeared in March and mi- 
grated, first on the ground as 
hoppers and then in the air, from the 
shorelines into the interior. The 
third successful breeding in seven 
months came during March, April,

and May. Some of these locusts 
; soon migrated eastward from the 
&apos; , Arabian Peninsula on the spring 
westerly winds. Ships in the 
Arabian Sea reported massive 
flights of locusts heading toward 
India. 

Until I heard this last news, I 
thought the chances of a locust 
plague were about even. But heavy 
rains in the Ganges River cachment 
have made India and Pakistan a 
major breeding area. For the first 
time, India has requested financial 
aid to help control the desert locust, 
an indication of the seriousness of 
the situation. 

The desert locust has long been 
considered one of the world&apos;s most 



Pruning as a means to 
more nearly perfect wines. 




K .&gt;». 





To us, pruning — the cutting off of 
parts of the grapevine during the winter 
dormant period — is the single most 
important practice in the entire culture 
of grapes. 

It is a complex and hiqhly judgmental 
operation that not only controls the 
amount of crop our vines will bear, but 
also controls the quality of the ultimate 
contribution which that particular crop 
will make to our wines. 

That is why we do not consider a man 
thoroughly experienced until he has 
been pruning for at least three years. 

Why We Prune 

The whole purpose of pruning is to 
direct our vines to grow fewer but better 
grapes — grapes of optimum maturity 
and with the full potential of their variety. 

Vines which produce too many 
grapes — a condition viticulturists call 
overcropping — can lead to a thin, 
watery wine. 

A carefully pruned vine will produce 
grapes that have acid and sugar contents 
in perfect balance, and their wine will be 
full-bodied, deep and brilliant in color, 
and with aroma and bouquet that are 
rich and flavorful. 

Our Unique Next Step 

Sometimes, despite judicious prun- 
ing, a vine will overproduce anyway — 
perhaps because of optimum conditions 
for exceptional fruitfulness, or because it 
did not produce as much as it should 
have in the previous year. 

in such a case, we resort to thinning. 

Thinning involves the actual removal 
of whole grape clusters from the vine — 
the sacrificing of a part of our crop in 
order to ensure the quality of the rest. 

Sometimes this can mean removing 
as much as one-third the crop from an 
overproducing vine in order to maintain 
vine vigor. Or all of it, if we wish to give 
the vine a rest to regain its vigor. 

We might point out that ours is one of 
the very few wineries to practice this 
costly technique of thinning in order to 
produce crops of only the best possible 
wine grapes. 

How We Prune 

Pruning is basically an art. And over 
the years we have developed techniques 
that we believe provide the best possible 
results of that art. 



Our viticulturists began researching 
and establishing our pruning practices in 
the 1940&apos;s. 

At that time, every single variety of 
grape was given its own program to 
determine the best method of pruning 
for that particular vine. 

As a result of our tests, we have estab- 
lished some general rules. 

One, is that on each spur — that part of 
the new wood which remains after 
pruning — we never leave more than 
two buds for future growth. This ensures 
optimum grape quality. 

We do, however, vary the number of 
spurs on each vine. Exactly how many 
depends on the variety. 

For example, the Chenin Blanc and 
Ruby Cabernet vines are allowed not 
more than twelve spurs, the French 
Colombard fourteen, and the Barbera 
only ten. 

In general, the varieties having larger 
grapes and grape clusters are left with 
fewer spurs so as not to tax them beyond 
their capacities, and the varieties having 
smaller grapes and grape clusters are left 
with more. 

Who Prunes 

So much depends on the judgment of 
our pruners. They must know how much 
to cut, at what angle and which wood. 
That is why we treat their training very 
seriously. 

At first, a beginner is only allowed to 
watch. Then he is permitted to work only 
when an experienced man is watching 
him. And finally, before working inde- 
pendently, he must work under the 
watchful eye of a foreman. 

That is why, as mentioned eariier, it is 
usually three years before we consider 
him a thoroughly experienced pruner. 

Our Purpose 

Obviously, the reason we are so par- 
ticular about pruning is the direct rela- 
tionship it has with wine quality. Our 
experience is that excellent wines can 
only be made from excellent grapes, and 
that perfect wines require perfect grapes. 

Here at the winery of Ernest and Julio 
Gallo, our purpose is to bring you the fin- 
est wine that skill and care can produce.

There are carvings of locusts on 
tombs built in Egypt&apos;s Sixth 
Dynasty (2420 to 2270 B.C.), and 
the Bible records that the eighth 
plague visited upon the Egyptians 
was of locusts (Exodus, chapter 10). 
Plagues by other species of locusts 
have been reported in Europe, 
China and other parts of Asia, and 
the Philippines. At the height of a 
desert locust plague, more than 
fifty countries, covering 20 percent 
of the earth&apos;s land surface, are at 
risk — from Senegal, on the Atlantic 
coast of Africa, east to western 
Burma, and from Tanzania north to 
the southern USSR. 

A swarm consists of a leaderless 
pack of locusts flying at a speed of 



up to twelve miles per hour. The 
density of the pack is between 40 
million and 80 million insects per 
0.4 square mile. The largest swarm 
ever accurately measured covered 
almost 400 square miles and proba- 
bly included 40 billion locusts.

stretching from Kashmir to Nepal, soaring 
five miles skyward, the Himalayas loom... 
hurled to the top of the world by the colli- 
sion of two continents over 40 million years 
ago. This colossal mountain range has an 
eerie beauty, both terrifying and irresisti- 
ble to men. Many have tried to conquer 
its cruel summits. Few returned alive. 

But now, guided by outstanding writers and 
photographers, you can traverse these 
awesome peaks and chasms. They await 
you in The Himalayas, first book in a glori- 
ous geographic adventure series from 
Time-Life Books. And it&apos;s yours to examine 
for 10 days free! 

You&apos;ll scale Annapurna with Herzog and 
Lachenal, share their nerve-jangling de- 
scent and learn the terrible price of their 
triumph. You&apos;ll explore the wonderlands at 
the base of the Himalayas— where 90°F 
heat evaporates the drenching rain— 250 
inches a year— into steaming mists. 

You&apos;ll meet the denizens of this primeval 



landscape. Griffon vultures that soar like 
jetliners up 25,000 feet. Yeti, the &quot;Abomi- 
nable Snowman, &quot;still a mystery to science. 
Described as half-bear, half-ape, the crea- 
ture is said to have the strength to pull the 
horns off a yak. 

The Himalayas is only the beginning of

Israeli fanners brave a swarm in 

1955. The fourteen-year plague 

probably began in vegetation that 

grew after heavy rains in the 

Middle East. It ended after 

insecticides were sprayed over 

breeding areas during a drought. 



0.07 ounce — during their period of 
greatest activity, this swarm would 
eat 80,000 tons of food each day. 
This amount of corn could feed 
400,000 people for a year. 

Migrations of 1 ,000 to 3,000 miles 
between successive breedings are 
not unusual for the desert locust. 
The insect can fly continuously for 
seventeen hours and can probably 
stay in the air much longer if it in- 
tersperses active flight with gliding. 
Flight activity is greatly affected by 
temperature. Sustained flight is 
possible when the shade tempera- 
ture is above 60°F with the sun 
shining, 75°F in cloudy conditions. 
The longest single flight on record 
by desert locusts was from the 
Canary Islands to Great Britain, a 
distance of 1,600 miles, in 1954. 

Swarms usually migrate as dis- 
crete groups leaving remarkably 
few stragglers behind, but if it were 
not for the gregarious nature of in- 
dividual locusts, a swarm would 
disperse like a cloud of smoke. 
Studies show that locusts on the 
edges are actually flying back into 
the swarm. This is particularly true 
at the front of a swarm, where lo- 
custs returning to the group form a 
clearly defined leading edge. At the 
tail end, where trailing locusts are 
flying in the same direction as the 
swarm, the edge is ragged. 

&quot;The locusts have no king, yet go 
they forth all of them by bands&apos;&quot; 
(Proverbs 30:27). Unlike ants and 
bees, locusts are not social insects, 
and there is no leadership in a 
swarm. Swarms go with the wind, 
moving toward areas where low 
level winds meet and, conse- 
quently, rain falls. Thus, adult lo- 
custs are continually arriving in just 
those areas where the soil is moist 
and the vegetation green — the 
essential requirements for success- 
ful breeding. Although the desert 
locust occurs in many desert coun- 
tries, it usually arrives during the 
rainy season, when these countries 
are at their least desertic.

These characteristics make the 
migrations of the desert locust un- 
predictable. A swarm may migrate 
to the highlands of Ethiopia or 
Kenya in warm weather but may 
not be able to leave because of a 
sudden spell of cool weather, so it 
will stay and feed for days on end 
until the weather warms up again. 
Complex wind patterns often make 
flying difficult even in warm 
weather. A swarm trapped in 
Morocco&apos;s Sous Valley in late 1954 
and early 1955 did some $9 million 
worth of damage to the local citrus 
crop. Locusts destroy crops not 
only by eating them but also by 
breaking the branches of trees and 
bushes they settle on. An old 
Kenya farmer once told me that the 
sound of branches cracking under 
the weight of settled locusts re- 
minded him of almost continual 
gunfire. 



Detailed scientific studies of lo- 
custs have been undertaken only 
during the last one hundred years. 
A major revolution in the under- 
standing of the locust problem came 
in 1921, when Sir Boris Uvarov 
first formulated the phase theory. 
He had been working on two in- 
sects — one was a typical locust that 
formed migrating swarms; the other 
one lived as a solitary grasshopper. 
Uvarov demonstrated that these in- 
sects, previously regarded as two 
distinct species, were really differ- 
ent forms of the same species. 
When crowded together, the grass- 
hoppers changed their behavior to 
that of the locusts. Grasshoppers 
that were crowded together for a 
generation or more also changed 
their shape to that of the locust. 
Uvarov further found that the 
process could be reversed if the lo- 
cust was isolated. He called the

grasshopper form &quot;phase solitaria&quot; 
and the swarming locust form 
&quot;phase gregaria.&quot; 

Since locust plagues were peri- 
odic, many people wondered where 
the locusts went during the quiet 
spells between plagues. In these 
phases, now called recessions, a 
relatively small number of locusts 
still exist, but in the form of grass- 
hoppers, with their shape and color 
sufficiently changed for them to be 
easily mistaken for that species. 

The phase theory led scientists to 
look for regular periodicity of 
swarms. Biogeographical studies in 
India showed that plagues of the 
red locust and the African migra- 
tory locust had started in two small 
areas in Africa, which were there- 
fore called outbreak areas. Solitary 
locusts live in these areas, which 
are seasonally flooded grasslands. 
Since these areas came under the 
supervision of international survey 
and control organizations, there 
has not been a plague of either 
species. No permanent outbreak 
area has been discovered for the 
desert locust, however. 

The way in which desert locust 
plagues develop is very complex, 
but the two most important factors 
are meteorology and the gregari- 
ousness of the insect. Particular 
weather systems can gather non- 
swarming locusts together. In addi- 
tion, rain in the semiarid region 
inhabited by the locust provides 
suitable breeding conditions for a 
large increase in population. This 
increase must be repeated several 
times, and in successive seasonal 
breeding areas, before enough lo- 
custs crowd together to form a 
swarm. As the supply of green, 
palatable food plants decreases to- 
ward the end of the rainy season, 
the locusts become even more con- 
centrated. Eventually, a swarm de- 
velops. Plagues are unpredictable 
and irregular because the meteoro- 
logical patterns favorable to crowd- 
ing are themselves irregular. 

One of the most interesting be- 
havioral changes that occur as lo- 
custs increase in numbers is that 
they change from night-flying to 
day-flying insects. Since night tem- 
peratures in parts of the Middle 
East are generally well below 75°F, 
the temperature that desert locusts 
require for flight, the area locusts 
cover during recessions is consid- 
erably smaller than the area they 
cover during plagues. 



During recessions, small num- 
bers of desert locusts occur over a 
vast area at densities generally too 
low to justify any control operations 
by humans. There is a gradual con- 
centration during the summer 
months, when rain falls in the 
Saharan belt. Even small areas of 
moist soil will provide enough mois- 
ture to sustain eggs and support the 
ephemeral vegetation that the 
young hoppers need for food and 
for shelter from the sun above and 
the hot soil below. With concen- 
tration come changes, even in small 
gatherings of locusts. The color 
pattern of the hopper begins to 
change from green to yellow with 
black markings. 

During a recession, this small 
change probably occurs hundreds 
or thousands of times a year. But to 
be important, an alteration must 
occur over large areas so it can 
produce many gregarious locusts. 
Such conditions arise only when the 
rains are unusually heavy and wide- 
spread and attract a great many lo- 
custs. For the effect to be long- 
lasting, and therefore potentially 
serious, the next rainy season must 
also be good for the locusts. In 
areas of extremely low rainfall, the 
chances of having two rainy sea- 
sons in succession are small, but it 
does happen occasionally and can 
be the stimulus for an upsurge in 
the locust population and lead to a 
new plague. 

A locust lays a pod containing 20 
to 120 eggs, the larger number be- 
ing typical of solitary locusts. Fe- 
males can lay at intervals of seven 
to ten days, but the number of eggs 
per pod decreases with each laying. 
Many females die after laying eggs, 
which is why there are many more 
older male locusts than females. 

A fair estimate would be that 
each female lays 200 eggs. Assum- 
ing equal numbers of males and fe- 
males, there is a potential popula- 
tion multiplication rate of 100. With 
two new generations a year, the oflF- 
spring of a very small swarm cover- 
ing only two square miles would, 
within less than two and a half 
years, cover the entire surface of 
the earth. Fortunately, this never 
happens; a multiplication rate often 
will start a plague that can affect 20 
percent of the earth&apos;s surface. At 
the height of a plague, a multiplica- 
tion rate of two would lead to 
disaster. 

All of this indicates that natural

1979 will be a galvanizing 
year for the space sciences. As 
Pioneer Venus 1 and 2 complete 
their 220-million mile journey 
through space, scientists are 
already making telemetry checks 
on the outer-planet probes in 
anticipation of the first close-up 
pictures of Jupiter&apos;s moons and the 
rings of Saturn. And very soon the 
Space Shuttle will make its 
dramatic orbital debut, ushering in 
the most exciting and ambitious era 
in man&apos;s exploration of the cosmos.

In Bell&apos;s &quot;Photophone,&quot; sunlight 
was bounced from a reflector through 
a lens to a mechanism that vibrated in 
response to speech. This caused the 
light beam to vary in intensity. At the 
receiving end, a selenium detector 
translated these variations into 
electrical current to recreate speech 
through a telephone receiver. 



77 years before we 
invented the laser, 
Professor Bell had a 
perfect application for it. 



In 1880, only four years after 
he invented the telephone, 
Alexander Graham Bell received 
a patent for a remarkable idea — 
using light, rather than wire, 
to carry phone calls. 

Professor Bell built an experi- 
mental &quot;Photophone&quot; that 
transmitted his voice over a 
beam of sunlight. It didn&apos;t work 
very well, however. 

Sunbeams are scattered by 
air, rain and fog. In any event, 
the sun doesn&apos;t always shine. 
The Photophone, unfortunately, 
was an idea whose time had not 
yet come. 

A new kind of light 

By the 1950&apos;s, scientists again 
were looking for a way to use 
light for communications. 

In September, 1957, Charles 
Townes, a Bell Labs consultant, 
and Bell Labs scientist Arthur 
Schawlow conceived a way of 
producing a new kind of light — 
extremely intense, highly direc- 
tional, and capable of carrying 
immense amounts of information. 

Townes and Schawlow 
received a basic patent on their 



invention — the laser. 

Since then. Bell Labs scien- 
tists have invented hundreds 
of lasers, including many firsts — 
gas and solid-state lasers capable 
of continuous operation, high- 
power carbon dioxide lasers, 
liquid dye lasers that produce 
pulses shorter than a trillionth 
of a second, and tiny semi- 
conductor lasers that work 
reliably at normal temperatures. 
Some of these, no larger than 
grains of salt, may emit light 
continuously for 100 years. 

Getting the light to the 
end of the tunnel 

While we were developing 
lasers to generate light, we also 
looked for a way of shielding it 
and guiding it for long distances 
and around curves. 

Extremely transparent glass 
fibers, perfected at Bell Labs 
and elsewhere, provide the 
answer. These hair-thin fibers 
can carry light many miles 
without distortion or the need 
for amplification. 

In 1977, the Bell System took 
lightwave communications out 



of the laboratory and put it to 
work under the streets of down- 
town Chicago. The system, the 
first to carry phone calls, 
computer data, and video signals 
on pulses of light, is working 
successfully. 

Spin-off 

Laser light is now used in 
many other ways — to perform 
delicate eye surgery, detect air 
pollution, read product codes 
at supermarket checkouts, and 
do a variety of manufacturing 
tasks. Western Electric, the 
Bell System&apos;s manufacturing 
and supply unit, was the first 
company to put the laser to 
industrial use back in 1965. 
Hundreds of applications in 
many industries have followed. 

Sometimes, it takes a lot of 
work and a long time to make a 
bright idea — like Professor 
Bell&apos;s — a reality. Often, the 
things we invent, such as the 
laser, benefit not only Bell System 
customers, but society in general.

factors regularly control more than 
90 percent of locust populations. 
Weather, parasites, disease, egg- 
eating predators, such as Sto- 
morliinu (a fly) and Tiox (a beetle), 
and locust-eating birds, such as 
storks, all help to limit locusts. The 
success of a control organization 
during a plague is judged by its 
capacity to eliminate the remaining 
percentage, thereby keeping the lo- 
custs down to levels at which dam- 
age to agriculture is insignificant. 
An antilocust organization must not 
only save crops and, if possible, 
halt the plague when the locusts are 
swarming; it must also prevent fu- 
ture plagues during a recession. 

Failure to control locusts in one 
country or region can, as we have 
seen, have a serious effect on an- 
other country or region thousands 
of miles away. Because prosperous 
agricultural countries that lie out- 
side the recession area, such as 
Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, 
have the most to lose in the event of 
a plague, they cooperate with 
other countries in supporting re- 
gional antilocust groups. While 
these organizations are generally re- 
garded as fire brigades designed to 
stop the situation from getting out 
of hand, during plagues the coun- 
tries involved will throw their na- 
tional resources into the battle. 
Some of the great dilemmas of lo- 
cust control are when to act, when 
to appeal for funds, and most im- 
portant of all, when to know that 
you have a plague on your hands. 
The unpredictability of desert lo- 
cust plagues makes planning that 
much more difficult. 

A saying among locust con- 
trollers is, &quot;Locusts are not diffi- 
cult to kill, but they are diffi- 
cult to find in the immensity of the 
desert.&quot; Realizing the implications 
of the problem, the Centre for Over- 
seas Pest Research proposed that 
the United States&apos; earth resources 
satellite, ERTS-I. be used to iden- 
tify areas where locusts might 
breed. If suitable breeding condi-

forty countries, receded after a

regional, and international locust 

control organizations. 



tions exist, locusts will be there to 
take advantage of them; therefore, 
the initial use of the satellite was 
based on the identification of areas 
of new green vegetation. The detec- 
tion of areas of wet sand without 
surface water would give locust 
control organizations even earlier 
warning of where to look for poten- 
tial breeding sites, but finding such 
areas requires the use of more 
sophisticated equipment than has 
been available. The United Nations 
Food and Agriculture Organization 
is now investigating the potential 
use of satellites in locust control. 

What can be done about the new 
plague of desert locusts? The 
answer is difficult. If a full-scale 
plague develops, spreading from 



the Atlantic to the Bay of Bengal, 
the problems will be logistical. Get- 
ting personnel, aircraft, vehicles, 
fuel, and insecticides to the right 
places and in sufficient quantities 
is especially difficult in the remote 
areas where locusts often breed and 
over which the young swarms mi- 
grate on their route to wetter, more 
fertile soil. We can hope that the 
natural factors controlling the 
spread of this little insect will work 
to keep the locust in recession. 

Christopher F. Hemming is asso- 
ciated with the Centre for Overseas 
Pest Research in London. England. 
He has studied the desert locust for 
twenty-eight years in Asia, South 
America, and Africa.

Senseless Signs of History 



Or why Londoners call a 
subway stop Elephant and 
Castle, and other 
interesting puzzles 

There is a subway stop in the 
heart of London called Elephant 
and Castle. It honors a pub of the 
same name that stood for more than 
300 years before its demolition in 
the blitz of 1942. Such an odd com- 
bination invites an obvious inquiry 
about its source. The pub was 
named for a Spanish princess, the 
Enfanta de Castile, whom Charles I 
might have married in 1625 had he 
been willing to become a Roman 
Catholic. The unfamiliar foreign 
words were soon transmogrified 
into the familiar, but pleasantly 
incongruous, association that sur- 
vives to grace an underground sys- 
tem not lacking in memorable 
names. 

Evolutionists have always viewed 
linguistic change as a fertile field for 
meaningful analogies. Charles Dar- 
win, advocating an evolutionary 
interpretation for such vestigial 
structures as the human appendix 
and the embryonic teeth of whale- 
bone whales, wrote: &quot;Rudimen- 
tary organs may be compared with 
the letters in a word, still retained in 
the spelling, but become useless in 
the pronunciation, but which serve 
as a clue in seeking for its deriva- 
tion.&quot;&quot; Both organisms and lan- 
guages evolve. 

This column will masquerade be- 
hind a list of curious facts, but it is 
really an abstract discourse on 
method — or, rather, on a particular 
method widely used but little appre- 
ciated by scientists. In the stereo- 
typed image, scientists emphasize 
experiment and logic. A middle- 
aged man in a white coat (most 
stereotypes are sexist), either shyly 
reticent, but burning with an inner 
zeal for truth, or else ebullient and 
eccentric, pours two chemicals to- 
gether and watches his answer 
emerge in a flask. 



Hypotheses, predictions, experi- 
ments, and answers: the scientific 
method. 

But many sciences do not and can- 
not work this way. As a paleon- 
tologist and evolutionary biologist, 
my trade is the reconstruction of 
history. History is unique and com- 
plex. It cannot be reproduced in a 
flask. Scientists who study history, 
particularly an ancient and unob- 
servable history not recorded in 
human or geologic chronicles, must 
use inferential rather than experi- 
mental methods. They must ex- 
amine modem results of historical 
processes and try to reconstruct the 
path leading from ancestral to con- 
temporary words, organisms, land- 
forms, and so on. Once the path is 
traced, we may be able to specify the 
causes that led history to follow this , 
rather than another, route. But how 
can we infer pathways from mod- 
ern results? In particular, how can 
we be sure that there was a pathway 
at all? How do we know that a 
modern result is the product of 
alteration through history and not 
an immutable part of a changeless 
universe? 

This is the problem that Darwin 
faced, for his creationist opponents 
did view each species as unaltered 
from its initial formation. How did 
Darwin prove that modern species 
are the products of history? We 
might suppose that he looked toward 
the most impressive results of evolu- 
tion, the complex and perfected 
adaptations of organisms to their en- 
vironments: the butterfly passingfor 
a dead leaf, the bittern for a branch, 
the superb engineering of a gull aloft 
or a tuna in the sea. 

Paradoxically, he did just the op- 
posite. He searched for oddities and 
imperfections. The gull may be a 
marvel of design; if one believes in 
evolution beforehand, then the en- 
gineering of its wing reflects the 
shaping power of natural selection. 
But you cannot demonstrate evolu- 
tion with perfection because per- 



fection need not have a history. 
After all, perfection of organic de- 
sign had long been the favorite argu- 
ment of creationists, who saw in 
consummate engineering the direct 
hand of a divine architect. A bird&apos;s 
wing, as an aerodynamic marvel, 
might have been created exactly as 
we find it today. 

But, Darwin reasoned, if organ- 
isms have a history, then ancestral 
stages should leave remnants be- 
hind. Remnants of the past that 
don&quot;t make sense in present terms — 
the useless, the odd, the peculiar, 
the incongruous — are the signs of 
history. They supply proof that the 
world was not made in its present 
form. When history perfects, it 
covers its own tracks. 

Thus, unless some English lord or 
showman once displayed an ele- 
phant in his castle on the south bank 
of the Thames or unless some Cock- 
ney wag had an inspiration beyond 
my poor power to comprehend, 
Elephant and Castle probably began 
as something else — and something 
sensible. And why should a whale 
fetus make teeth in its mother&apos;s 
womb only to resorb them later and 
live a life sifting krill on a whale- 
bone filter, unless its ancestors had 
functional teeth and these teeth sur- 
vive as a harmless remnant. 

No evidence for evolution pleased 
Darwin more than the presence in 
nearly all organisms of rudimentary 
or vestigial structures, &quot;parts in 
this strange condition, bearing the 
stamp of unutility,&quot; as he put it. 
&quot;On my view of descent with 
modification, the origin of rudi- 
mentary organs is simple,&quot; he con- 
tinued. They are bits of useless 
anatomy, preserved as remnants of 
functional parts in ancestors. 

But I emphasize that the general 
point extends both beyond rudimen- 
tary structures and beyond biology 
to any historical science. Oddities 
in current terms are the signs of his- 
tory. Lastmonth&apos;scolumnraised the 
same subject in a different context.

How to Learn About Most 
Job Openings in Your Field 



If you are looking for a better 
job, there is now a single source 
which can tell you about most job 
openings as soon as they become 
available. It&apos;s called The National 
Reporter of New Job Openings, 
and it can assist people in all 
fields and locations. 

Job Hunting 
Breakthrough 

In today&apos;s competitive job mar- 
kets, winning a better job is not 
easy. The real key is in finding 
out where the job openings exist. 

For example, last year over 18 
million people looked for new 
positions. Without full knowl- 
edge of available jobs, the average 
person spent months scattering 
resumes and chasing after dead 
end leads. 

Now, for those looking for ad- 
ministrative, professioncd, mana- 
gerial or executive positions, this 
frustration can be eliminated and 
in a totEilly revolutioneu-y way. 

Here&apos;s what it&apos;s all about. Our 
firm has invested more than 
$750,000 to research and make 
available on a current basis, com- 
plete information on new job 
openings as they occur. (All 
states, fields and income levels 
are covered). 

What this means is that we can 
put in your hands . . . detailed in- 
formation on the best job open- 
ings in every part of America . . . 
and in your own particular area 
of interest. 

Thousands Of Job 
Openings Available 

To fully grasp the tremendous 
value of this breakthrough you 
have to know a little bit about 
the job market. 

For example, you may not have 
realized that at almost any time, 
there are more than 60,000 spe- 
cific openings over $15,000. We 
know this to be a fact because 
our research staff has them on file. 

Unfortunately, while these jobs 



take an average of 12 weeks to 
fill, the typical job seeker never 
knows about them. Many are 
advertised once . . . but even then 
the ads are spread among 220 
major media from coast to coast. 
(Now, however, people who use 
The National Reporter need never 
miss out on these possibilities.) 

How It Works 

Let me explain just how we do 
it. Our professional staff is the 
largest of its type in the country. 
Every day they research the entire 
nation, reviewing thousands of 
new job openings that have just

The panda&apos;s &quot;thumb&quot; demon- 
strates evolution because it is 
clumsy and built from an odd part, 
the radial sesamoid bone of the 
wrist. The true thumb had been so 
shaped in its ancestral role as the 
running and clawing digit of a car- 
nivore that it could not be modified 
into an opposable grasper for bam- 
boo in a vegetarian descendant. 

In a nonbiological musing, I found 
myself wondering last week why 
veteran and veterinarian , two words 
with such diflFerent meanings should 
have a similar root in the Latin 
vetus, or &quot;old.&quot; Again, an oddity 
suggesting a genealogical approach 
for its solution. Veteran presented 
no problem, for its root and its mod- 
ern meaning coincide — no indica- 
tion of history. Veterinarian turned 
out to be interesting. City dwellers 
tend to view vets as servants of 
their pampered dogs and cats. I 
forgot that the original veterinarians 
treated farm and herd animals (as do 
most modern vets, I guess — pardon 
my New Yorker&apos;s parochialism). 
The link to vetus is through &quot;beast 
of burden&quot; — old, in the sense of 
&quot;able to take a load.&quot; Cattle, in 
Latin, are veterinae.

science should apply to the earth as 
well. The theory of plate tectonics 
has led us to reconstruct the history 
of our planet&apos;s surface (see my col- 
umn of February 1977). During the 
past 200 million years, our modern 
continents have fragmented and dis- 
persed from a single superconti- 
nent, Pangaea, that coalesced from 
earlier continents more than 225 
million years ago. 

If modern oddities are the signs of 
history, we should ask whether any 
peculiar things that animals do today 
might be rendered more sensible as 
adaptations to previous continental 
positions. Among the greatest puz- 
zles and wonders of natural history 
are the long and circuitous routes of 
migration followed by many ani- 
mals. Some lengthy movements 
make sense as direct paths to favor- 
able climates from season to season ; 
they are no more peculiar than the 
annual winter migration to Florida 
by large mammals inside metallic 
birds. But other animals migrate 
thousands of miles — from feeding to 
breeding grounds — with astounding 
precision when other appropriate 
spots seem close at hand. Could any 
of these peculiar routes be rendered 
shorter and more sensible on a map 
of ancient continental positions? 
Archie Carr, world&apos;s expert on the 
migration of green turtles, has made 
such a proposal (A. Carr and P. M. 
Coleman, in Nature, May 10, 1974). 

A population of the green turtle, 
Chelonia mydas, nests and breeds 
on the small and isolated central 
Atlantic island of Ascension. Lon- 
don soup chefs and the victualing 
ships of Her Majesty&apos;s Navy found 
and exploited these turtles long ago. 
But they did not suspect, as Carr 
discovered by tagging animals at 
Ascension and recovering them 
later at their feeding grounds, that 
Chelonia travels 2,000 miles from 
the coast of Brazil to breed on this 
&quot;pinpoint of land hundreds of miles 
from other shores,&quot; this &quot;barely 
exposed spire in mid-ocean.&quot; 

Turtles feed and breed on sepa- 
rate grounds for good reasons. They 
feed on sea grasses in protected, 
shallow-water pastures, but breed 
on exposed shores where sandy 
beaches develop — preferably, on 
islands where predators are rare. 
But why travel 2,000 miles to the 
middle of an ocean when other, ap- 
parently appropriate breeding 
grounds are so much nearer? (An-

BROTHER TIMOTHY&apos;S NAPA VALLEY NOTEBOOK 




How lor^ should a 
red wine £^e? 

There is perhaps nothing so delightful to drink as a fine red wine that has 
reached its full maturity. The time it takes to reach that peak of flavor 
depends on characteristics in the wine itself At The Christian Brothers 
Napa Valley Winery, we begin with noble, shy-bearing varietal wine grapes 
grown in soils and climates best suited to their individual needs. And 
then we take our time about making the wine. 

Each of our Napa Valley red wines is allowed to develop at its own 
leisurely pace, for time alone fulfills the promise of the grape. We follow their 
progress, tasting for the development of varietal character, softness, and 
depth of bouquet. Only when we are satisfied that the wine has matured and 
is ready to drink do we approve it for shipping. Yet, the nature of many 
of our red wines is such that they will continue to 
improve for several more years, gaining even greater 
depth and varietal complexity, if they are stored 
properly in your own home. 

Our Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is made 
with the grape many consider to be the finest red of the 
Napa Valley. Our bottling is 
dry, with a deep taste and distinctive bouquet that 
is delightful now, and will continue to expand. Enjoy 
it with steaks and roasts. 

The Christian Brothers Gamay Noir comes from 
the grape often called &quot;Gamay Noir a Jus Blanc&quot; in 
France. Here in the Napa Valley vineyards, it has gained 
new character Our wine is mellow with an almost velvety softness before 
it is shipped but it has the ability to develop even further This is a fine 
choice with red meats, game, cheese dishes or pasta. 

We think you will be pleased by the mature taste of our wines when you 
buy them. But if you have a cool, dry place to store them so the wine 
touches the cork, we invite you to enjoy the rewards that can come with 





extra time in the bottle.

species breeds on the Caribbean 
coast of Costa Rica.) As Carr writes: 
&quot;The difficulties facing such a 
voyage would seem insurmountable 
if it were not so clear that the turtles 
are somehow surmounting them.&quot; 

Perhaps, Carr reasoned, this 
odyssey is a peculiar extension of 
something much more sensible, a 
journey to an island in the middle of 
the Atlantic, when the Atlantic was 
little more than a puddle between 
two recently separated continents. 
South America and Africa parted 
company some 80 million years ago, 
when ancestors of the genus Che- 
Ionia were already present in the 
area. Ascension is an island asso- 
ciated with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 
a linear belt where new sea floor 
wells up from the earth&apos;s interior. 
Material at ridges often piles itself 
high enough to form islands. 

Today , Iceland is the largest island 
formed by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 
and Ascension is a smaller version 
of the same process. After islands 
form on one side of a ridge, they are 
pushed away by new material well- 
ing up and spreading out. Thus, is- 
lands tend to be older as we move 
farther and farther from a ridge. But 
they also tend to be smaller and fi- 
nally to erode away into seamounts, 
for their supply of new material is 
cut oflF once they drift away from an 
active ridge. Unless preserved and 
built up by a shield of coral or other 
organisms, islands will eventually 
be eroded below sea level by waves. 
(They may also sink gradually from 
sight as they move downslope from 
an elevated ridge into the oceanic 
depths.) 

Carr therefore proposed that the 
ancestors of Ascension green tur- 
tles swam a short distance from 
Brazil to a &quot;proto-Ascension&quot; 
on the late Cretaceous Mid- Atlantic 
Ridge. As this island moved out and 
sank, a new one formed at the ridge 
and the turtles ventured a bit farther. 
This process continued and, like the 
jogger who does a bit more each day 
and ends up a marathoner, turtles 
found themselves locked into a 
2,000-mile journey. (This historical 
hypothesis does not deal with the 
other fascinating question of how 
the turtles can find this dot in a sea 
of blue. The hatchlings float to Bra- 
zil on the Equatorial Current, but 
how do they get back? Carr sup- 
poses that they begin their journey 
by celestial cues and finally home in 
by remembering the character 



[taste? smell?] of Ascension water 
when they detect the island&apos;s wake.) 

Carr&apos;s hypothesis is an excellent 
example of using the peculiar to re- 
construct history. I wish I could be- 
lieve it. I am not troubled by the 
empirical difficulties, for these do 
not render the theory implausible. 
Can we be confident, for example, 
that a new island always arose in 
time to replace an old one — for the 
absence of an island for even one 
generation would disrupt the sys- 
tem. And would the new islands al- 
ways arise sufficiently &quot;on course&quot; 
to be found? Ascension itself is less 
than seven million years old. 

I am more bothered by a theoreti- 
cal difficulty. If the entire species 
Chelonia mydas migrated to Ascen- 
sion or, even better, if a group of re- 
lated species made the journey, I 
would have no objection, for be- 
havior can be as ancient and as herit- 
able as form. But C. mydas lives and 
breeds worldwide. The Ascension 
turtles represent only one among 
many breeding populations. Al- 
though its ancient ancestors lived 
in the Atlantic puddle 200 million 
years ago, the genus Chelonia may 
not go back more than fifteen mil- 
lion years, while the species C. 
mydas is probably a good deal 
younger. (The fossil record, for all 
its faults, indicates that few ver- 
tebrate species survive for as much 
as ten million years.) In Carr&apos;s 
scheme, the turtles that made the 
first trips were rather distant ances- 
tors of C. mydas (in a ditferent 
genus at least). Several events of 
speciation separate this Cretaceous 
ancestor from the modern green 
turtle. Now consider what must 
have happened if Carr is right. The 
ancestral species must have been 
divided into several breeding popu- 
lations, only one of which went to 
proto-Ascension. This species then 
evolved to another and another 
through however many evolu- 
tionary steps separated it from C. 
mydas. At each step, the Ascension 
population kept its integrity, chang- 
ing in lock step with other separate 
populations from species to species. 

But so far as we know, evolution 
doesn&apos;t work this way. New species 
arise in small isolated populations 
and spread out later. Separate sub- 
populations of a widely dispersed 
species do not evolve in parallel 
from one species to the next. If the 
subpopulations are separate breed- 
ing stocks, what is the chance that 





THIS IS THE LAST PLACE 

ON EARTH 

UKE THE FIRST PLACE 

ON EARTH. 

This is Dominica. The most luxuriant 

tropical island in the Caribbean, perhaps, 

in all the world. Mists rise from blue 

mountains, green sunlight filters 

through giant ferns, streams tum- 
ble into roaring waterfalls, and 

the timeless trees sprout orchids. 
Dominica is the last home of 

the legendary Carib Indians. The last^ 

refuge of the endangered Sisserou or 

Imperial Parrot and the Rednecked Parrot. And 

one of the last places on earth where people who love 

nature can still find paradise. 

Now, Caribbean Holidays, tour 
planners in the Caribbean for forty-five 
years, makes this paradise available to 
you. You&apos;ll be pleased by small, pleasant- 
ly informal hotels with swimming pools, 
by excellent food, and by the assistance 
of safari tours and experienced hiking 
guides on the island. 

Like all Caribbean Holidays tours, 
these tours to Dominica are available 
only through travel agents. Ask your trav- 
el agent about this most uncommon 
experience and the most uncommon 
new brochure that he can obtain from us.

all would evolve in the same way and 
still be able to interbreed when they 
had changed enough to be called a 
new species? I assume that C. 
mydas, like most species, arose in 
a small area sometime within the last 
ten million years, when Africa and 
South America were not much 
closer together than they are today. 
In 1965, before continental drift 
became fashionable, Carr proposed 
a different explanation that makes 
more sense to me because it derives 
the Ascension population after C. 
mydas evolved. He argued that an- 
cestors of the Ascension population 
accidentally drifted on the Equa- 
torial Current from west Africa to 
Ascension. (Carr points out that an- 
other turtle, the west African ridley , 
Lepidochelys olivacea, colonized 
the South American coast by this 
route.) The hatchlings then drifted 
to Brazil in the same east-to-west 
current. Of course, getting back to 
Ascension is the problem, but the 
mechanism of turtle migration is 
so mysterious that I see no barrier 
to supposing that turtles can be 
imprinted to remember the place of 



their birth without prior genetic 
information transmitted from pre- 
vious generations. 

I don&apos;t think that the validation of 
continental drift is the only factor 
that caused Carr to change his mind. 
He implies that he favors his new 
theory because it preserves some 
basic styles of explanation generally 
preferred by scientists (incorrectly, 
in my iconoclastic opinion). By 
Carr&apos;s new theory, the peculiar As- 
cension route evolved gradually, in 
a sensible and predictable fashion, 
step by step. In his former view, it is 
a sudden event, an accidental, un- 
predictable vagary of history. Evo- 
lutionists tend to be more comfort- 
able with nonrandom, gradualistic 
theories. I think that this is a deep 
prejudice of Western philosophical 
traditions, not a reflection of na- 
ture&apos;s ways. I regard Carr&apos;s new 
theory as a daring hypothesis in sup- 
port of a conventional philosophy. I 
suspect that it is wrong, but I ap- 
plaud his ingenuity, his effort, and 
his method, for he follows the great 
historical principle of using the pe- 
culiar as a sign of change. 



I am afraid that the turtles illus- 
trate another aspect of historical 
science — this time a frustration, 
rather than a principle of explana- 
tion. Results rarely specify their 
causes without some unsettling bits 
of ambiguity. If we have no direct 
evidence of fossils or human chron- 
icles, if we are forced to infer a 
process only from its modern re- 
sults, then we are usually stymied 
or reduced to speculation about 
probabilities. For many roads lead 
to almost any Rome. With only a 
map and the pavement over a van- 
ished pub, who would have guessed 
the source of Elephant and Castle? 

This round goes to the turtles — 
and why not? While Portuguese sail- 
ors hugged the coast of Africa, 
Chelonia mydas swam straight for a 
dot in the ocean. While the world&apos;s 
best scientists struggled for cen-

tion, Chelonia looked at the skies

THE^I 

SELUNGCAR 

IN SmmZERUUID. 



&apos;2)V0LKSWA0Eri or 



The Swiss are no cuckoos. 
They sit surrounded by Ger- 
many, Italy and France - all of 
the biggest car makers in 
Europe. 

Their choice of cars is unlim- 
ited. Yet the car they buy most 
is the Volkswagen 
Rabbit. 

It seems fair to 
ask why. 

To begin 
with, moun- 
tain climb- 
ing isn&apos;t 
just o hobby in Switzerland; it&apos;s the 
way everyone drives. Good weath- 
er or bad (especially bod) there is 
nothing like Rabbit&apos;s front-wheel 
drive to get a cor up on Alp. Or 
a Rocky, or even a steep driveway 

Also, the Swiss worsfiip precision,- 
it&apos;s what makes them tick Cor and 
Driver described the Rabbit this 
way: &quot;Quality is exceptionally high 
throughout, with solid slamming 
doors and a structure that feels as 
substantial as a Mosler safe.&quot; 
The Swiss also dote on technol- 



ogy. Fuel injection, for example. 

You might be as interested as the 
Swiss to know that you can&apos;t get a 
Renault with fuel injection. Or a Fiat. 
Or a Lancia. Not to mention Toyota, 
Honda, or Mazda. But you con get 
a fuel-injected Rabbit. 

Lost, but hardly least, is the fact 
that the Swiss ore-well- frugal. 
And so when they see a car that&apos;s 
built like a vault, climbs like a goat, 
is far ahead of its time and still sells 
for a reasonable price, the Swiss do 
what sensible people everywhere 
do. 

They buy them in droves.

The time is fall. The man is John Brodie. His fashion in slacks is 100% pure wool worsted 
plaids. They come in all the rich cool colors of autumn. It&apos;s just what the season calls for. Bold, yet

A Matter of Taste 



by Raymond Sokolov 



Liver Trouble 



Is there any reason for 

the strong culinary aversion 
to this organ? 

Of all the hated foods, liver prob- 
ably repels more people than any 
other. There is some justification 
for this widespread antipathy. Calf 
and beef livers are large, bloody 
organs, enormous smooth-textured 
glands with mysterious functions 
and a strong and, therefore, threat- 
ening taste. Most cooks add to the 
liver&apos;s unpopularity by overcook- 
ing it until it turns stiff and gray. 
They usually do not trim oflF the 
outer membrane beforehand, so 
that when this thin outer &quot;rind&quot; 
contracts under heating, it tightens 
around the meat and makes it curl 
inward in an ugly pucker. 

All of these practical drawbacks 
are only the beginning of the liver&apos;s 
troubles. Primitive, and many not 
so primitive, peoples have thought 
that this dark, bile-producing gland 
(at 40 to 60 ounces, the most mas- 
sive of all human glands) was the 
seat of the passions. It has long 
been obvious that life cannot go on 
without a liver to perform various 
vital functions, notably the conver- 
sion of sugar to storable glycogen. 
The liver is also a repository of 
large amounts of vitamin A, iron, 
and other crucial nutriments, but 
these were not the reasons behind 
the liver&apos;s awesome reputation 
among prescientific folk. 

It takes no great leap of the imag- 
ination to grasp why hunting no- 
mads would regard the liver as a 
source of manhood, of brooding, 
chthonic energies. 1 felt this more 



surely than ever while lunching a 
while back in the top floor restau- 
rant of the World Trade Center in 
downtown Manhattan. I was there 
on a journalistic mission whose 
pleasant side effect was a meal with 
the chef at a table 107 stories above 
the Hudson. Under such circum- 
stances, it is boorish to ask for the 
menu, and on this particular occa- 
sion — it was late fall and the hunt- 
ing season was in full swing — the 
chef offered me a taste of the deer 
he had shot upstate the day before. 
He offered me, in fact, the greatest 
delicacy he could carve from his 
noble quarry — the liver. With per- 
haps excessive modesty, he ex- 
cused himself from cooking the 
prized morsel. He served it raw, 
red-purple, and crunchy. 

Liver always requires us to adopt 
a special standard of taste if we are 
going to eat it with gusto. This was 
abundantly true of the slice of deer 
liver I ate, with increasing delecta- 
tion. The first forkful, I admit, was 
an eyes-closed vault into the abyss. 
Soon, however, I could see that all 
was well. I was tasting the most 
macho of meats in a way that 
brought me in symbolic touch with 
Apache chieftains and Mongol 
raiders. 

No doubt this fantasy will not ap- 
peal to many readers. And I have 
no wish to convert anyone to raw 
stag liver. But the experience was a 
key to the paradoxical nature of all 
liver for, like the ancient strongman 
Milo of Crotona — who could hold a 
ripe fruit so tightly in his hand that 
no one could pry it loose but, at the 
same time, so daintily that he never 
damaged the fruit — liver is a combi- 



nation of power and gentleness, of 
softness of texture and boldness of 
taste. 

Rapid cooking is the prime secret 
for exploiting these antipodean vir- 
tues. The outstanding recipe for 
achieving this essential result isfe- 
gato alia veneziana. liver in the 
Venetian manner. This dish is liver 
and onions raised to the highest 
level of refinement. The process in- 
volved is almost Chinese, with its 
emphasis on fine slicing and quick 
frying in oil. In her classic descrip- 
tion, Elizabeth David recommends 
the tenderest calf s liver, &quot;so soft 
that you could put a finger through 
it as if it were bread.&quot; Thin strips 
of this elite liver are then added to a 
skillet of equally thinly sliced, sau- 
teed onions, and cooked for a min- 
ute on each side. The slicing ex- 
pedites the cooking process and 
minimizes any toughness that might 
be caused by the liver&apos;s internal 
structure. The onions, which are 
there in great profusion, exude a 
surprising sweetness that masks 
any bitterness in the liver. 

Although Venetian-style liver 
and many other excellent liver rec- 
ipes are quite practical in America, 
most of us rarely eat calf s liver 
except in the conventional three 
ways it is usually cooked in this 
country — sauteed, broiled, or 
chopped into a paste, which is then 
variously enriched and flavored. 
For the full calf s liver repertoire, 
one must look farther afield, for in- 
stance, to the Ticino district of 
Switzerland, where Italian is 
spoken. At Bellinzona, a pictur- 
esque provincial capital with some 
stunning old buildings, an entire

&quot;The Physicist&apos;s 
Fire&quot;^ 




Hot, even, slow-burning, easy to start, 

is how TIME described the simple, elegant 
fire designed by research physicist Lawrence 
Cranberg. (Science Section. Dec. 22, 1975). 

Place logs on the patented Texas Fire- 
frame® grate to form a slot-shaped cavity 
that faces you. Ignite paper in the cavity. 

Eureka! The fire takes hold quickly, bums 
evenly, steadily in the cavity. That means 
the cavity throws a beam of radiant energy at 
you, so the fire is hot but fuel-efficient. 

Texas Fireframe&apos;s height-adjustable arms 
give you easy set-up and a new option for 
control of the fire. The arms lock by friction. 

From Scientific American 

(August, 1978, pp. 142-146) 
&quot; Cranberg&apos; s conception of the radiation 
pattern from his log holder is correct . . . 
little of the radiated heat was lost upward to 
the overhang or the chimney . . . nearly all 
of it must have been coming out into the 
room.&quot; 

&quot;The burning was slower with this ar- 
rangement, and flames . . . were uniform 
across the length of the slot (cavity) and 
required no rotation or stirring of the logs.&quot; 

From Texas Fireframe Mail 

&quot;Your Fireframe performs very well in- 
deed. It easily held the first floor of our house 
at 70°F — with 20° outside — with no help 
from the central heating system,&quot; Carl M. 
Zvanut, Paoli, Pa. 

&quot;It is easy to rebuild the fireslot while the 
fire is going.&quot; R. D. Keith. Olympia, Wa. 

&quot;The greatest thing since the invention of 
fire,&quot; D. D. Walsh, Madison, Ct. 

&quot;I am especially amazed at how rapidly 
the fire catches and disperses without kin- 
dling.&quot; J. D. Barrier, Universal City, Tx.

piece of liver is braised slowly in 
wine flavored with prosciutto and 
served with mashed potatoes and 
braised onions. In Zurich, they 
saute fingers of liver on skewers. 
Each liver piece is topped with a 
sage leaf and wrapped in bacon 
before it goes on a skewer. Ger- 
man-speaking Switzerland shares 
liver dumplings with the rest of the 
Teutonic world. Alice B. Toklas 
came across a recipe for these 
forceful liver balls that seems to 
have come from Alsace but may 
have been Belgian (see recipe be- 
low) and has the unprepossessing 
name kneppes. 

Although every one of these 
dishes is a success in terms of taste, 
the plainness of most liver prepara- 
tions works against their popular 
acceptance. Energetic mothers, 
vvho want to sidestep the usual 
complaints and tempt their young- 
sters with a truly glamorous liver 
dinner, might consider trying the 
masterpiece that Michel Guerard 
recommended to dieters in his Cui- 
sine Minceur. I refer to steamed 
calfs liver with leeks in sweet-and- 
sour sauce. Guerard steams a foil- 
wrapped, two-pound piece of liver 
over chicken stock for thirty min- 
utes. The leeks are braised sep- 
arately. There is also an elegant 
wild mushroom garnish. When all 
this is served, the liver is sliced like 
a small roast or steak. 

If this seems like falderal to you, 
there is always haggis to fall back 
on. For centuries, Scots have 
smacked their lips over this pud- 
ding of lamb liver, heart, and lungs 
cooked in the stomach of a Iamb (or 
sometimes a calf). For some rea- 
son, whose discovery I leave to the 
more daring adepts of structural- 
ism, this same enthusiasm for ovine 
ofFal also crops up in Martinique, 
where it is called patte en pot, or 
&quot;paw in the pot&quot; (quite often, this 
stew&apos;s name is corrupted io pate en 
pot, but it is no pate). The Antillean 
cook traditionally procures the 
feet, the liver, the paunch (the ru- 
men, or first stomach), the head, 
tripe, and heart of a sheep and sets 
about making a boneless stew of 
magisterial intensity, flavored with 
an encyclopedia of local vege- 
tables, spices, and peppers. If this 
sounds like rough fare, I can only 
insist \ha.X patte en pot, as prepared 
by the redoubtable Vava in Grande- 
Riviere, is the very opposite of 
crude. Martinican gourmets are 



said, by the great Antillean gas- 
tronome Andre Negre, to dispute 
whether adding bacon to patte en 
pot may not overpower the dish&apos;s 
basic refinement of taste. 

Patte en pot is probably too ex- 
otic for casual presentation to most 
guests. Grpanoiik, however, is an- 
other story. As Sonia Uvezian ex- 
plains it in her Cooking from the 
Caucasus, this roast lamb shoulder 
from Armenia is stuffed with a rec- 
ondite mixture of lamb&apos;s liver, al- 
monds, cardamom, and rice. 

Pigs, too, have livers. Used 
mainly for cat food in this country, 
they are a major ingredient in coun- 
try pates in France. More intri- 
cately, both British and French 
cooks wrap pork liver mixtures in 
the lacy membrane known as caul 
fat. These little bundles are called 
faggots or gayettes. 

Moving right along down the 
great chain of hepatic being, we 
come inevitably to chicken livers. 
The Chinese prize the liver more 
than any other part of the bird. In 
Szechuan, they stir-fry them with 
long hot green peppers. With no 
less reverence, modern French 
chefs, such as Paul Bocuse, have 
revived one of the legendary dishes 
celebrated by Brillat-Savarin, the 
gateau de foies blondes, an egg- 
thickened liver &quot;cake,&quot; which 
when bathed in a crayfish sauce, is 
rightfully referred to as &quot;one of the 
beatitudes of gourmandise.&quot; 

Duck livers have also inspired 
magniloquence. They are excellent 
in pates, unctuous in mousses. The 
Chinese pay them the honor of a 
special course in Peking&apos;s famous 
all-duck restaurant. 

All this liver rhetoric pales beside 
the encomiums that epicures have 
showered upon the grotesquely fat- 
tened liver of the goose, that 
swollen and roseate marvel called 
foie gras. &quot;Fat liver&quot; can actually 
be produced by ducks or geese, but 
the most common victim of this 
gastronomic sadism is the goose. 

Around Strasbourg in Alsace and 
in the southwest of France, as well 
as certain other foreign countries 
{foie gras manufacture is illegal in 
the United States), geese are held 
immobile and literally force-fed, 
traditionally with corn, through a 
tube implanted in their throats. 
Eventually, their livers hyper- 
trophy. Weights as high as 4Vi 
pounds have been achieved.

River Safari 
in Borneo 

with visits to wildlife reserves and 
archaeological sites in Java and Bali 

APRIL 1 10 23,1979 
SEPTEMBER 2 TO 24, 1979 

Nine days are spent touring West and 
Central Java, including a three-day 
visit to the splendid Ujung Kulon 
Nature Reserve, followed by a train 
journey to the Borobudur, the world&apos;s 
greatest religious monument, which 
we see at sunrise. 

We then fly to Borneo, to cruise for 
one week on the Mahakam river and 
its tributaries, striking deep into the 
Dayak country with its remarkable 
wildlife, where we attend village cer- 
emonies and sleep one night in a 
native longhouse. The tour ends with 
two days of well-earned comforts on 
the island of Bali, and is escorted 
by an accomplished leader.

served plain and lightly cooked, it 
is known as/b/e gras frais, &quot;fresh&quot;&quot; 
foie gras. In whatever way it is 
presented — inside a loaf of brioche 
or in one of the many other classic 
dishes and sauces listed in chefs 
manuals — fresh /b(&gt;gras is a super- 
lative raw material, a freakish but 
wonderful thing, soft as butter, 
complex as a fine sauce. It is some- 
times available in this country, but 
virtually all the/o/&gt;gras sold here 
is in processed forms, mousse or 
pate or parfait. These are all quite 
disappointing adulterations. To eat 
the real thing, which does not keep 
for many days, even after cooking, 
one almost has to go to France. 
And it has been no small part of the 
genius of the nouvelle cuisine chefs 
to see that, by stressing foie gras 
(and other strictly local French 
products), they could continue to 
draw customers from abroad, even 
after the classic methods of French 
cooking had spread round the 
globe. 

Michel Guerard, in La Cuisine 
Gounnande, devotes a whole chap- 
ter to foie gras. You could call it 
the height of liver literature. It ends 
with a typically Guerardian dish of 
&quot;sumptuous rusticity,&quot; a/o/e gras 
pot-au-feu. This turns out to be a 
monument of staged simplicity: 
cabbage, noodles, and other vege- 
tables making a sort of farmhouse 
stew ornamented with slices of 
freshly poached /b/e gras. Guerard 
does not forget to add a helpful 
suggestion to home cooks who 
might try this extravaganza of 
plainness. He suggests that we save 
the ./b(&gt;gras cooking liquid, skim 
off the fat, poach eggs in it and 
serve it as a soup. Liver, you see, 
is always practical.

Salmon Recapture 
Connecticut 



by Stephen Fay

A decade-long struggle begins 
to pay off as Atlantic 
salmon return to a river 
they abandoned almost two 
hundred years ago 

The mating, on November 11, 
1976, of the Berkshire National Fish 
Hatchery&apos;s prize buck salmon with 
a bevy of fertile females was a 
painstakingly arranged consumma- 
tion. Ten years of hard work, two 
devastating disappointments, and 
the expenditure of millions of fed- 
eral and local dollars preceded the 
event. 

This ichthyological equivalent of 
The Matchmaker featured a cast of 
remarkable characters and crea- 
tures and starred an SVi-pound, 
33-inch male Atlantic salmon caught 
in a fish lift at Holyoke Water Power 
Company&apos;s dam on the Connecticut 
River. This particular buck was 
special because he was one of the 
few Atlantic salmon in the past 180 
years to swim up New England&apos;s 
polluted and dammed Connecticut 
River in an attempt to spawn. He 
was additionally singular because 
he was born and bred in a hatchery. 

Salmon had once been abundant 
in the Connecticut River, which

courses through New Hampshire, 
Vermont, Massachusetts, and Con- 
necticut. But the native population 
was reduced drastically when, in 
1798, a 16-foot-high dam was 
erected at Turners Falls, Massa- 
chusetts. In the interests of hydro- 
power, adult Atlantic salmon, re- 
turning from the high seas to the 
waters of their origin, were pre- 
vented from ascending the Con- 
necticut River to their spawning 
streams in Vermont and New 
Hampshire. The stray salmon that 
traveled up the Connecticut van- 
ished altogether by 1810 after other 
low-head dams went up on the river 
and its tributaries. 

Biologists hope to restore this 
once abundant fish to the misused 
river through the eugenics experi- 
ment for which the prized salmon 
described above was reared. 

Born in one of the Department of 
the Interior&apos;s New England fish 
hatcheries and raised in a large 
cement pool, the big buck and 
thousands of other salmon were the 
offspring of wild Atlantic salmon 
that continue to thrive in the 
Saint Lawrence River, Maine&apos;s 
Penobscot River, or other north- 
eastern rivers. At the age of two, 
when he was a six- or seven-inch 
smolt, the salmon was released with 
thousands of other males and 
females into one of the free-flowing 
tributaries of the Connecticut 
River. Biologists were simply play- 
ing the odds: out of all the hundreds 
of thousands of smolts dumped into 
the river maybe, just maybe, a suffi- 
cient number would return to spawn 
an indigenous strain of Connecticut 
River Atlantic salmon.

The undertaking appeared to be 
worthwhile and effective last sum- 
mer, when a total of eighty-one 
returnees were caught in the river 
and removed for breeding, but in its 
early years the salmon restoration 
effort was marked by frustration 
and calamity. 

A year before the big buck was 
caught, an equally promising Atlan- 
tic salmon male was captured at the 
Holyoke dam. On June 23, 1975, 
the first hatchery-bred Atlantic 
salmon was captured in the river

after returning from its feeding 
period at sea. This news brought a 
jubilant response: environmen- 
talists, sport fishermen, and people 
who had been hoping all along that 
Rachel Carson&apos;s anticipations 
would not come to pass joined in 
hailing the return of the Atlantic 
salmon. 

It was a richly significant first — 
the first Atlantic salmon to warrant 
the belief that the effects of pollu- 
tion and industrialization of the 
Connecticut River could be re-

versed. A long-dormant mechanism 
was thrown into action as fish biolo- 
gists throughout the northeast 
learned the glad tidings. A team 
from the federal fish hatchery in the 
Berkshire County town of New 
Marlborough, Massachusetts, was 
dispatched to pick up the salmon 
and transport it to the hatchery. It 
would be kept there until ready for 
mating in late October. 

Roger I. Lanse, coordinator of 
the Connecticut River Anadromous 
Fish Restoration Program, was par- 
ticularly pleased. An employee of 
the Department of the Interior, 
Lanse had worked since 1967 with 
environmental agencies in New 
Hampshire, Vermont, Massachu- 
setts, and Connecticut in an effort 
to replenish the river with shad and 



Atlantic salmon. He, along with a 
gaggle of federal Fish and Wildlife 
Service agents and conservation- 
ists, paid visits and homage to the 
New Marlborough hatchery&apos;s new 
tenant. Plans were made to ship 
four or five female Atlantic salmon 
from Maine&apos;s Penobscot River to 
the hatchery for breeding. The 
females would be wild fish, taken 
from their native river in autumn 
after they had returned from the 
ocean to spawn. 

But on Monday, September 29, 
1975, the plans and hopes came to 
an abrupt halt. The valued male 
salmon, which had been moved 
from a large natural pond at the 
hatchery to a small cement tank 100 
yards closer to the hatchery labora- 
tory, died, biologists believe, as a 



result of his instincts. His shallow 
tank had been covered with a light 
mesh net staked out around the 
perimeter of the pool. Fresh water 
cascading into the pool from a 
water pipe probably bore too great 
a resemblance to the waterfalls this 
active salmon had leaped up and 
over during his journey up the Con- 
necticut. He leaped at the challeng- 
ing cascade, hit the lip of the cov- 
ered pool, slithered under the net, 
and landed on the soft grass beyond 
the pool, where he quickly died. 

William V. Wallentine, project 
leader at the hatchery, found the 
dead salmon the next morning. A 
big down-easter who always spoke 
with affection for the frisky salmon 
that had put his hatchery on the 
environmental map, Wallentine sat

down and cried. A few days later he 
said he would be ready when the 
next salmon was caught: he would 
cover the holding pool with chicken 
wire and stake it down inside the 
pool. Nine months elapsed before 
he had the opportunity to demon- 
strate his redoubled vigilance. 

In March 1976. Lanse and 
Wallentine spent a chilly week in 
the hatchery laboratory, branding 
smolts and discussing the future of 
the restoration program. More re- 
turnees were needed to justify the 
program and provide biologists with 
salmon possessing the migratory in- 
stincts that, once passed on to sub- 
sequent generations, would insure 



The Connecticut River, near 
Ryegate. Vermont. Until the late 
eighteenth century, the river was 
the scene of major salmon 
spawning runs. Dams and 
pollution eliminated the salmon.

an enduring population of Connect- 
icut River Atlantic salmon. 

But the two of them knew that 
fortune, more than planning, 
would determine the outcome of the 
eflfort because so little is known of 
the migratory and spawning in- 
stincts of salmon. There is general 
agreement that smolts, whether 
spawned in a river or deposited 
there from hatcheries, gain an ol- 
factory impress of the smell of their 
particular river. That smell is not 
forgotten after they swim down- 
stream to the salt waters where they 
will feed for the next two or three 
years. Before venturing forth from 
the river to feed on various crusta- 
ceans in the ocean, the salmon dally 
for several weeks in the estuarine 
waters at the river&apos;s mouth. This 
may provide a period of acclimation 
so that the transition from fresh- 
water to a sea environment is not 
too abrupt. But how salmon manage 
to find their way over thousands of 
miles of ocean to their feeding 
grounds and back again to their na- 
tive fresh waters is not known. 
Lanse puts some stock in the theory 
that the earth&apos;s magnetic fields help 
the salmon navigate. 

Salmon navigate not only accu- 
rately but also according to a precise 
timetable. When it is time to spawn, 
their built-in sense of time alerts 
them to head back from distant 
feeding grounds to the rivers of their 
origin. Atlantic salmon make runs 
upstream twice a year, in the late 
spring and early fall. It was during 
the spring 1976 spawning run that 
Wallentine and the other regional 
participants in the Atlantic salmon 
restoration program got their sec- 
ond big chance. A hefty female 
salmon was caught in the Holyoke 
Water Power Company&apos;s fish lift on 
June li, 1976. The machinery that 
had been put into motion a year 
earlier, when the first returnee

showed up in the fish lift, was 
swiftly set in motion again. 

About everything that could go 
wrong went wrong with the re- 
trieval of this 40-inch, 23-pound 
hen. The truck dispatched from the 
New Marlborough hatchery to 
Holyoke to fetch the new specimen 
was twelve years old and feeble. 
The salmon was taken, via net, from 
the lift and placed in a special tank 
mounted on the back of the hatch- 



ery&apos;s 1964 pickup. Then, techni- 
cians Donald Williams and David P. 
Curtin started the ninety-minute 
ride back to the hatchery. A few 
minutes later, as they cruised down 
the Massachusetts Turnpike, the 
truck — with the aquatic equivalent 
of the $6 Million Man in back — 
developed engine trouble and the 
two anxious men found themselves 
crawling along the highway at 25 
mph. The return to the hatchery 



43 



took them almost four hours — three 
times longer than normal. 

A couple of days later the female 
salmon became ill. Curtin spent a 
day and a night in the pond with 
her, helping her stay afloat, righting 
her when she flopped on her side. 
No one knew what the problem was 
and hatchery personnel despaired. 
On June 17, 1976, five days after 
she had been removed from the 
Holyoke lift, the female died. The 
15,000 eggs in her large belly would 
never be fertilized, a serious blow 
for the program. Three months 
later, the Fish and Wildlife Service 
disclosed that a forensic laboratory 
had determined that the hen died 
from a pneumonialike infection; 
concentrations of bacteria had been 
found in her tissues. The trauma of 
the long ride to the hatchery had ap- 
parently lowered the hen&apos;s resis- 
tance. 

Another Atlantic salmon dead, 
another potential spawning run 
gone, and little chance of a new 
salmon appearing in the river that 
year. But that little chance was 
enough to justify operation of the 
fish lift until December. Built in 
1975, the lift is owned and operated 
by the power company and serves 
to lift American shad and Atlantic 
salmon over the Holyoke dam. Al- 
though the lift is usually shut down 
in November, the company&apos;s con- 
cern and cooperation brought about 
an extension of that date. 

No one thought it would do any 
good. Don Williams, after thirty-two 
years with the Fish and Wildlife 
Service, had retired, and Bill Wal- 
lentine was on vacation. So Dave 
Curtin was all alone on the after- 
noon of October 25, 1976, when 
Atlantic salmon number 3, a male, 
swam into the fish lift at Holyoke. 

Everything went perfectly this 
time. Curtin raced out to Holyoke 
in the hatchery&apos;s brand new truck 
and picked up the salmon. On his 
return to the hatchery, he prudently 
mixed small amounts of the holding 
pool&apos;s cool water into the truck&apos;s 
portable tank to acclimate the fish 
to his new environment. The salmon 
was carried in a net down to a long, 
deep, narrow cement pool and plans 
were immediately made for mating 
the new male. 

Since salmon spawn in the fall, 



as well as in the spring, there was 
every reason to believe that this 
buck was about ready to fertilize 
eggs. When a test of his milt, or 
sperm, showed that it was motile, 
four Penobscot females were 
shipped from Maine&apos;s Craig Brook 
hatchery. Eggs stripped from the 
four hens were placed in a basin 
and the male was lifted from his 
tank and held over them. He was 
squeezed gently around the ab- 
domen until a stream of his milt 
flowed onto the 30,000 eggs. The 
fertilized eggs were then removed to 
the Pittsford, Vermont, hatchery 
where the most sophisticated incu- 
bation equipment in the northeast is 
located. 

Since that first big break in No- 
vember of 1976, when the third of 
the three salmon caught in the 
Holyoke lift lived long enough to 
fertilize eggs, the Atlantic salmon 
restoration effort has made more 
progress and encountered more 
problems. On June 15, 1977, two 
years after she had been released as 
a smolt into a tributary of the Con- 
necticut, a 29-inch, 6Vi-pound fe- 
male salmon was snagged by the 
hook of a fisherman who was after 
blueback herring in Connecticut&apos;s 
Salmon River. The Salmon River is 
a tributary of the Connecticut 
River, which joins it twenty miles 
north of Long Island Sound. This 
female bore a numbered tag, affixed 
when she was a smolt to identify 
her as hatchery-raised stock. Spot- 
ting the tag, the fisherman kept the 
salmon in a pool until the retrieval 
team from the New Marlborough 
hatchery arrived on the scene. 

This female and a male captured 
in the Holyoke fish lift in July lived 
to become the principals in a his- 
toric, if involuntary, mating at the 
hatchery November 8, 1977. After 
the female&apos;s approximately 8,000 
eggs were expressed from her abdo- 
men into a plastic basin, the male 
was lifted over the basin and gently 
squeezed until his milt flowed over 
the eggs. 

&quot;This is pure Connecticut River 
stock,&quot; said William Purcell, Wal- 
lentine&apos;s successor as hatchery 
manager. 

The fingerlings produced by this 
union are being raised at the hatch- 
ery until it is time to release them 



into the Connecticut River in 1979 
or 1980. Because both parents were 
Connecticut River returnees, par- 
ticipants in the restoration effort 
are hopeful that these little salmon 
will bear a particularly strong in- 
clination to return to their natal 
river after their feeding stint off the 
coasts of Greenland or Labrador. 

The 1978 restoration effort was 
attended by the greatest success 
and the worst defeats. A total of 
eighty-one Atlantic salmon were 
captured in the Holyoke lift and the 
Rainbow Dam fish ladder on the 
Farmington River north of Hart- 
ford. (The Farmington is also a trib- 
utary of the Connecticut.) But of 
those eighty-one, all of which were 
successfully transported to the New 
Marlborough hatchery, only two 
were still alive as of November 1, 
1978. Furunculosis, a bacteriologi- 
cal infection that is as deadly to 
salmon and other fish as plague 
once was to humans, turned a 
triumphant year into a dismal one. 

&quot;It&apos;s totally depressing,&quot; hatch- 
ery manager Purcell said as the toll 
mounted last summer. 

The disease, probably picked up 
in the Connecticut or one of its 
tributaries by the returnees as they 
swam upstream to spawn last 
spring, is difficult to treat because 
the antibiotics with which biologists 
normally respond have to be in- 
jected into the fish with hypodermic 
needles. Antibiotics cannot be in- 
troduced via fish feed because 
salmon and other androgenous fish 
do not eat during the months-long 
spawning period. The process of 
catching and injecting the already 
weakened salmon caused deadly 
trauma. 

The encouraging aspect of this 
year&apos;s results is the remarkably 
high number of Atlantic salmon that 
have returned to the rivers of their 
artificially induced origins. There is 
no reason to think the return rate 
will be any less exceptional next 
year and the year after. A few mass 
breedings of Connecticut River re- 
turnees over the next few autumns 
could restore a population that will 
renew itself naturally, without the 
benign interference of humans 
whose ancestors originally caused 
so much trouble for this most hand- 
some of creatures. D

The Onslaught Against 
Hawaii&apos;s Tree Snails 



by Alan D. Hart 



Threatened by everything 
from humans to carnivorous 
relatives, these gems of 
the forest are rapidly 
being exterminated 

Had Charles Darwin visited Ha- 
waii, he would have found in the 
archipelago another natural labora- 
tory that vividly demonstrated his 
theory of evolution. The islands are 
the most geographically isolated in 
the world, separated from the 
nearest continent or large island 
group by more than 2,200 miles of 
Pacific Ocean. Isolation, time, and 
habitat diversity have produced a 
most distinctive land biota. More 
than 97 percent of Hawaii&apos;s native 
flowering plants, nonmigratory land 
birds, insects, and land snails occur 
naturally nowhere else on earth. 

For the past six years, I have 
studied a remarkable group of Ha- 
waiian tree snails that evolved on 
the island of Oahu. They belong to 
the genus Achatinella (&quot;little ag- 
ate&quot;), and their forty-one named 
species have been called &quot;gems of 
the forest.&quot; Now, more than half of 
these once abundant species may be 
extinct, and the rest are increasingly 
rare and endangered. 

Their shells come in an amazing 
assortment of colors — various 
shades of red, orange, yellow, 
brown, green, gray, blue, black, 
and white — and countless patterns, 
many quite spectacular. Evolution- 
ist John T. Gulick, the son of early 
New England missionaries, who 



grew up in Hawaii during the nine- 
teenth century, said of the snails, 
&quot;We have right here on Oahu, the 
most beautiful, varied and highly 
developed land shells of the world.&quot; 
(Today, more than 20,000 species 
of land snails are known.) 

Most Achatinella tree snails live 
at elevations from 1,000 to 3,700 
feet in the native and introduced 
forests of the Koolau and Waianae 
mountain ranges. They are noc- 
turnal and generally inhabit low 
shrubs and trees. During the day, 
they rest alone or in small clusters 
sealed to branches, trunks, or the 
undersides of leaves. At night, they 
graze leaf and bark surfaces for 
microscopic algae, fungi, liver- 
worts, and detritus. They have 
rasping teeth specialized for that 
purpose and do not eat the tissues 
of their host plants. 

The snails are hermaphroditic 
(bisexual) but not self-fertilizing. 
Mature individuals breed year- 
round and usually bear one live 
young at a time, complete with a 
tiny shell corresponding to the first 
few small whorls at the tip of the 
parent&apos;s shell. As the snail grows, 
secretions from the soft mantle of 
its body construct the lower, 
larger shell whorls. The maturation 
time or life span of any Achatinella 
species is not known. 

These little snails are quite seden- 
tary; one might live out its entire 
life in a single tree, especially if the 
tree is isolated. Achatinella&apos; s mi- 
gration rates, from one area to an- 
other, are so slow that they would 



be measured in centuries rather than 
years, according to Yoshio Kondo, 
chief malacologist at Honolulu&apos;s 
Bishop Museum. 

A species&apos; distribution in a given 
area is unpredictable. Some snails 
prefer a certain type of tree, but 
they are not necessarily found on all 
trees of that species. I found thir- 
teen A. sowerbyana in a small, half- 
dead hame tree with less than two 
dozen leaves, but none in more 
thickly foliated hame trees nearby. 

Basic shell shapes of the various 
species are globular, conical, and 
ovate — denoting three subgenera, 
or groups of species with similar 
form. Adult shells range in length 
from half an inch to slightly over one 
inch, depending on the species. The 
number of shell whorls varies be- 
tween five and seven throughout 
the genus, and the number can vary 
within a single species. A small 
&quot;tooth,&quot; a distinctive character of 
the genus, protrudes from the 
twisted central column inside the 
shell. In some species the shells coil 
to the left or to the right; in other 
species the shells all coil the same 
way. Most species have smooth, 



Endemic to Oahu&apos;s Koolau range, 

Achatinella lila was thought 

to be extinct. Since 1973, several 

small colonies of this tree 

snail have been found, but the 

species remains endangered.

glossy shells, but a few have 
slightly sculptured shell surfaces. 

The brilliant coloration is usually 
contained in the periostracum, a 
thin, pigmented cuticle forming the 
shell&apos;s outermost layer. The bio- 
logical value of these colors is a 
puzzle. Malacologist Henry A. 
Pilsbry has suggested the opaque 
colors might be an adaptation to 
reflect bright Hawaiian sunlight. 
Despite their striking hues, these 
snails are easily overlooked, for 
they often conceal themselves in 
leaf curls or compact leaf clusters 
during the day. Also, their shell 
patterns tend to have a cryptic ef- 
fect in the dappled light of the forest. 
On one field trip Pilsbry was em- 
barrassed when two experienced 
local shell collectors told him that 
the best collecting was on trees he 
had already searched without find- 
ing a snail. 

Achatinella\ origin and develop- 
ment in Hawaii are extraordinary. 
The island of Oahu is in the south- 
eastern part of the approximately 
1,500-mile-long archipelago. On 
Oahu, two nearly parallel moun- 
tain ranges occupy opposite sides of 
the island, with the longer Koolau 
range in the east and the older 
Waianae range in the west. Oahu is 
actually the exposed tops of two 
enormous volcanoes that rise 
18,000 feet from the ocean floor. 
About three million years ago, the 
Koolau and Waianae shield vol- 
canoes merged to form the island. 
Since then, continuous stream ero- 
sion has carved their basalt domes 
into a complex of long, fingerlike 
ridges branching from jagged sum- 
mit backbones. Amphitheater- 
headed valleys and ravines lie be- 
tween, with countless spurs on their 
slopes. High cliffs and short but- 
tress ridges, from two to four miles 
long, make up much of the Koolau&apos;s 
windward east slope. The Koolau&apos;s 
leeward west slope has numerous. 



gradually sloping ridges of varying 
length. The Waianae range&apos;s slope 
configuration is virtually opposite 
that of the Koolau. Oahu&apos;s highest 
point is 4,025-foot Mount Kaala in 
the Waianae range; most of the 
Koolau&apos;s 37-mile-long summit 
backbone is from 2,000 to 2,800 feet 
above sea level. 

Many of the plants and animals 
that eventually colonized Oahu and 
the other volcanic Hawaiian Islands 
had physical features that facilitated 
long-distance dispersal, by wind, 
birds, or ocean currents, across the 



vast expanse of water that isolates 
Hawaii from the rest of the world. 
We can only guess where Achali- 
nelUi&apos;s progenitor came from; the 
group has undergone such drastic 
changes over the ages that it has no 
close living relatives on continents 
bordering the Pacific basin. Against 
heavy odds, the snail&apos;s immigrant 
ancestor may have hitched a peril- 
ous ride to Hawaii aboard a bird 
straggler or drifting log. This snail 
likely arrived and established itself 
on the island of Maui or Molokai.

food, few predators, and little com- 
petition, it proliferated. Its prog- 
eny adaptively shifted to arboreal 
habits and gave rise to four modern 
genera. Pariulina and two offshoots, 
Newcombia andPerdicella, evolved 
on Maui and Molokai and, even- 
tually , /&quot;ar/M/wfl snails spread to the 
islands of Lanai, Oahu, and Hawaii. 
On Oahu, the Partiilina line ex- 
ploited a variety of ecological zones 
— from sea level to high mountain 
tops — to speciate, prosper, and be- 
come Achatinella. At least two of 
these early species apparently mi- 
grated from the Koolau range, 
scene of Achatinella&apos;s richest de- 
velopment, to the Waianae range 
and evolved into several more 
kinds. Presumably, by the time the 
first humans arrived, Oahu&apos;s forests 
were bejeweled with tree snails 
in an unending rainbow of color 
patterns. 



Polynesian immigrants from the 
Marquesas and Society Islands to 
the south were the first people to 
conquer the formidable oceanic 
barrier and reach Hawaii, in the 
first millennium a.d. They became 
familiar with the plants and animals 
in their new environment, including 
the tree snails. 

The old Hawaiians strung &quot;little 
agates&quot; into anklets, bracelets, and 
necklaces called leis. European sci- 
entists&apos; first contact with the snails 
was through such leis. During a visit 
to Oahu in 1786, a British captain, 
George Dixon, acquired a lei of A. 
apexfulva shells from the natives in 
exchange for a nail. In Europe, the 
shells created an immediate sensa- 
tion. Dixon&apos;s lei was broken up, and 
each shell was sold for upwards of 
forty dollars. 

Based on erroneous information 
given to Dixon, scientists first clas- 



sified Achatinella as a freshwater 
snail. In those early decades of 
European contact, little collecting 
was done by trained naturalists. 
What few shell specimens reached 
Europe were brought by adventur- 
ous navigators with vague collect- 
ing data: &quot;Oahu&quot; or &quot;Sandwich 
Islands.&quot; 

Because conchologists usually 
described snail species by their 
shell characteristics, mere color 



Achatinella&apos;.? /!c/ii;7a/ and range 
have been greatly reduced 
within the span of a human 
lifetime. Note the close relationship 
between the distribution of 
Euglandina and the disappearance 
o/ Achatinella.

forms of a particular snail were 
classified as &quot;new species.&quot; This 
practice soon led to a taxonomic 
nightmare. When English naturalist 
William Swainson erected the ge- 
nus Achtitinella in 1828, seven spe- 
cies were known. As Oahu&apos;s wilder- 
ness was explored, myriad new 
forms of snails were discovered. 
By 1888, the genus had ballooned to 
227 described species, with about 
900 varieties — all from a land area 
equal to that of modern Philadelphia 
or Detroit. And Oahu still had areas 
unexplored for tree snails. In 1914, 
Pilsbry and C. M. Cooke, a local 
land snail expert, published a mon- 
ograph on Hawaiian tree snails. 
They reduced the genus to 43 spe- 
cies, but later two more species 
were dropped, leaving the group 
with its present total of 41. Still, the 
debate continues, and some mod- 
ern biologists now estimate there 
may only be 12 good species of 
Achatinella. 

The fascinating variability of 
Achatinella&apos; s shells provides a 
classic demonstration of the process 
of organic evolution. The first per- 
son to recognize the biological sig- 
nificance of this variability was 
John Gulick. More than a decade 
before Darwin shook the world with 
his revolutionary ideas, teen-ager 
Gulick was coWQCimg Achatinella in 
Oahu&apos;s mountains. He was in- 
trigued by the apparent relationship 
between the tree snails&apos; shell varia- 
tions and the island&apos;s terrain. Gulick 
discovered that the shells in a single 
valley displayed color forms unique 
to that valley — or a part of it — and 
were unlike those in adjacent val- 
leys. Intermediate forms were often 
found on ridges separating the val- 
leys. Furthermore, he noted that 
most species occupied small geo- 
graphical territories and that many 
color forms were restricted to col- 
onies measuring only a few square 
yards. Gulick could tell which ridge 
or valley a shell came from by 
noting its shape, color, and pattern. 

Gulick theorized that by furnish- 
ing geographical barriers that iso- 
lated tree snail populations, Oahu&apos;s 
rugged topography was largely re- 
sponsible for Achatinella&apos; s diver- 
sity. In 1872, he traveled to London 
with part of his Hawaiian land-shell 
collection and discussed it at length

of many Hawaiian land snails. 



with Darwin, Alfred Russell Wal- 
lace, and others. Gulick also pre- 
sented ^.p&amp;psT on Achatinella snails 
before the Linnaean Society. 

By the turn of the century, Gulick 
was recognized as a prominent post- 
Darwinian evolutionist. Pilsbry and 
Cooke acknowledged Gulick&apos;s work 
in the preface to their tree snail 
monograph: &quot;The Achatinellidae 
hold an important place in general 
biological literature for the reason 
that a contribution of the first im- 
portance to the doctrine of evolution 
arose from a study of these snails.&quot; 

Since Gulick&apos;s time, several de- 
tailed field studies have shown 
Achatinella&apos; s incredible localiza- 
tion. In the 1890s, Cooke found 
twenty-five different color varieties 
of A. bellula multizonata within the 
six-mile length of the Nuuanu valley 
behind Honolulu. Later, mala- 
cologist D&apos;alte Welch discovered 
that A. apexfiilva might have as 
many as five subspecies on one 
Koolau ridge, phasing from one to 
another as altitude increased along 
the ridge. A striking example of 
localization within a species is 
shown by A. mustelina, endemic to 
the Waianae mountains. According 
to Welch, A. mustelina has de- 
veloped twenty-six subspecies and 
sixty distinct microgeographical 
color races within its twenty-mile- 
long range. The most localized sub- 
species of the genus was probably 
A. lehuiensis meineckei. now ex- 
tinct, whose total known range was 
one ohia tree in the Waianae moun- 
tains! 

The beautiful snails caught the 
public&apos;s interest as well, and tree 
snail shell collecting became the 
vogue in Hawaii. In fact, the allur- 
ing charm of Achatinella&apos;s shells 
caused a &quot;land shell fever&quot; on Oahu 
from 1850 to 1900. During that pe- 
riod, many species of tree snails 
were extremely abundant in areas 




above 1,000 feet. In 1886, D. D. 
Baldwin, a local land snail author- 
ity, and a friend easily collected 
3,000 shells in the Koolau range 
within a few days. Since no two 
shells were exactly alike, people 
collected many. Over the years, a 
multitude of people collected hun- 
dreds of thousands, perhaps mil- 
lions, of living snails for their shells. 
Several private collections ap- 
proached 100,000 specimens each. 
As a rule, collectors killed the 
animals by drowning them. 

For many people, collecting be- 
came an obsession. Oliver Emer- 
son, one of Gulick&apos;s boyhood 
friends, recalled &quot;the rarest days of 
all . . . those we spent hunting for 



50 




tree snails. ... I still feel the ex- 
hilaration of those excursions, the 
zest of coming upon a hidden sur- 
prise of nature, some fine speci- 
mens of those beautiful shells. ...&quot; 

In accessible places, the snails 
were undoubtedly decimated by 
overcollecting. But few people did 
extensive collecting in both moun- 
tain ranges. Former collectors 
George Arnemann, William Mei- 
necke, and Herman Lemke, Jr., 
have told me that many species 
were still very plentiful in the 1930s. 

George Arnemann remembers 
weekends when a gang of enthu- 
siasts would grab bagfuls of jars, 
pile into an old Model T, and drive 
up through muddy sugarcane fields 



to tree snail country. Arriving there, 
they scattered for the day to search 
for colorful snails. The real devotee 
spent the whole weekend gleaning 
the trees for their precious treas- 
ures, eventually exploring every 
ridge, valley, and ravine to get as 
many varieties as possible. 

Sometimes rivalries developed 
between collectors. If someone 
discovered an exclusive color race 
in a new locality, another collector 
might beseech him for the snail&apos;s 
whereabouts. Occasionally, the dis- 
coverer would give the inquirer the 
wrong locale and send him on a 
wild snail chase. 

Few old-timers kept accurate 
field notes, essential to the serious 



study of Ac fiatinella. They usually 
collected snails from a variety of 
locations and then labeled them all 
as coming from one general place. 
After 1932, men like William Mei- 
necke began plotting precise col- 
lecting sites on newly available 
topographic maps. 

Among the most sought-after 
species was A. rosea of the Koolau 
range. Pilsbry called it &quot;one of the 
most exquisite of land shells&quot; be- 
cause of its delicate coloration. 
This species was typically glassy 
milk white, with pinkish tints deep- 
ening to rose around the aperture. 
Other varieties came in salmon, 
dark red, and pale yellowish green 
with pink bands. Unfortunately for

collectors, the pink and red hues 
faded to a fawn brown with age. 

As a teen-ager in the 1930s, 
Lemke once found a large, solid red 
A. rosea, the prize of prizes. After 
exhibiting the shell publicly, he 
carefully wrapped it and other fresh 
A. rosea shells in cotton and stored 
them away, hoping to prevent them 
from fading. He was somewhat 
successful; when I saw them re- 
cently, they still retained a bright 
pink color. The last living A. rosea 
were collected in the early 1960s. 

The days of Achatinella&apos;s wide- 
spread abundance are gone. Today, 
live tree snails are rare in most 
places on Oahu, a change from con- 
ditions only a few decades ago. 
Illustrating the recent decline of 
Achatinella, Kondo compiled a sur- 
vey of the genus in 1970, based on 
his field experiences up to the early 
1960s and on all available informa- 
tion. He listed fourteen species as 
extinct, twenty-five as rare and en- 
dangered, and two as common. 

Since 1972, I have been doing a 
careful island-wide survey, with 
help from other local naturalists, to 
determine Achatinella&apos; s current 
status. My tentative findings show 
an alarming twenty-one species as 
possibly extinct, and twenty as en- 
dangered. These results indicate an 
extinction rate of more than 50 per- 
cent in the past two centuries. In 
the case of two extant species, A. 
turgida and A. biilimoides, only one 
living animal of each was located 
and I have not found either species 
alive in the wild since. A third 
species, A. lorata, may have suf- 
fered a similar fate. 

In 1961, Kondo published an ac- 
count naming three Ac- /!fl/(/)£&apos;//a spe- 
cies, including A. lorata. that could 
easily be seen on Mount Tantalus 
behind Honolulu. By contrast, 
twelve years later I was lucky to 
find what might have been the last 
four living individuals of A. lorata 
on a hame tree; I have not found any 
living individuals of the other two 
species. 

Achatinella owes its present 
rarity primarily to human alteration 
and destruction of Oahu&apos;s native 
ecosystems, especially since state- 
hood eighteen years ago. This fa- 
mous island has suffered sorely 
from human immigrants who came 



to enjoy it. The cost: a substantial 
part of its irreplaceable natural heri- 
tage. About 85 percent of the 
native forests that once covered 
most of Oahu have been destroyed, 
and the remaining 15 percent are 
biologically polluted by alien plants 
and animals introduced by humans. 
Six kinds of endemic forest birds 
are known to have become extinct 
on Oahu in the past two hundred 
years. 

The problem began more than a 
thousand years ago with colonizing 
Polynesians, who introduced pigs, 
dogs, rats, chickens, and certain 
plants for food and cultural needs, 
among them taro, yams, bananas, 
and the coconut palm. To cultivate 
those plants, these immigrants de- 
stroyed or altered many native low- 
land ecosystems. But since they 
lived mainly in coastal regions , they 
had little impact on the mountains 
and Hawaii&apos;s higher forests re- 
mained intact. 

The destruction of Oahu&apos;s wilder- 
ness increased after 1778, the year 
British explorer James Cook dis- 
covered the Hawaiian Islands for 
the Western world. In 1791, Capt. 
Charles Vancouver brought cattle, 
sheep, goats, pigs, and a number of 
foreign plants to Oahu. 

Endemic Hawaiian ecosystems 
evolved for millions of years in the 
absence of four-legged herbivores 
and developed no effective defense 
mechanisms against them, such as 
poisons, thorns, and deep roots. 
Cattle were destructive and killed 
many trees by trampling vulnerable 
root systems. Regeneration was 
prevented when seedlings were 
trampled, uprooted, and eaten. 
Also, Hawaiian plants and animals 
were naturally less competitive 
than their continental relatives and 
were ill-equipped to resist the man- 
assisted invaders. With the sandal- 
wood trade, ranching, and conti- 
nental-style commercial agriculture, 
a high percentage of Oahu&apos;s wood- 
lands below 1.000 feet was defor- 
ested, and most of the tree snails 
in those forests vanished with them. 

By the end of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, forest destruction was so 
widespread that a critical need 
arose for reforestation to conserve 
water and prevent soil erosion. 
Fast-growing exotics, such as Aus- 



tralian eucalyptus, ironwood, and 
Norfolk Island pine, were imported 
and planted instead of native trees. 
Less than half of Achatinella&apos; s spe- 
cies have adapted to introduced 
plants and trees. Other types of veg- 
etation were deliberately or acciden- 
tally introduced into low wooded 
ravines and higher forests, further 
diluting the snails&apos; food supply. 

Forest fires have denuded the 
lower slopes of many ridges and 
ravines and continue to threaten re- 
maining native forests. Since 1970, 
Oahu has had at least five large for- 
est fires in or near endemic tree snail 
habitat. The armed forces use vast 
areas of forestlands in both moun- 
tain ranges for training exercises 
and artillery practice. In May 1975, 
I watched native forest burn for sev- 
eral days above a major firing range 
in the Waianae mountains. 

Introduced rodents are another 
major problem for the snails. Tree- 
climbing rats can dislodge native 
tree snails, bite open their shells, 
and extract the insides. Baldwin 
found hundreds of broken tree snail 
shells piled around the openings of 
rat and mouse dens in the 1880s. 
Recently, I found a dozen shells of 
fresh rat-killed A. mustelina under 
one tree. 

An ill-omened event in 1955 
sealed the fate of many tree snails. 
Hawaii&apos;s Department of Agricul- 
ture was searching for a biological 
control agent to eliminate infesta- 
tions of giant African snails 
(Achatina fiilica), which were 
plaguing lowland homeowners. 
This plant-eating pest, whose adult 
shell can exceed five inches in 
length, was introduced to Oahu 
from Formosa in 1936 by a private 
individual who released the snails in 
a garden for aesthetic reasons. 
According to Henry van der 
Schalie, University of Michigan 
malacologist, a program was un- 
dertaken by agricultural en- 
tomologists to import and release a 
minimum of nineteen species of 
carnivorous snails from around the 
world to combat the African snails. 
The operation was done without 
adequate prior research to deter- 
mine its prospective effectiveness 
and environmental impact — and 
against the recommendations of lo- 
cal malacologists.

These four Achatinella lila 
demonstrate color and pattern 
variations within a single, small 
colony. Before the taxonomic 
status of the genus was clarified, 
such variations were often 
classified as separate species. 
Shell collectors have prized each 
variation; as a result, local 
populations have been wiped out. 
Introduced tree-climbing rats and 
predatory snails have also severely 
depredated this and other 
Achatinella species. Another 
important factor leading to the 
decline and extinction of tree 
snails has been forest clearing.

The most important carnivorous 
snail released on Oahu was Eiiglan- 
clina rosea, a large voracious spe- 
cies also known as the cannibal 
snail. I learned the reason for Eii- 
f^landiiia&apos;s nickname after collect- 
ing two live specimens and keep- 
ing them together in the same con- 
tainer overnight. The next morning 
I had one well-fed Euglandina and 
one fresh empty shell. In its native 
Florida, Euglandina preys upon the 
attractive Ligiius tree snails. Can- 
nibal snails are at home on the 
ground or in trees and occupy a 
variety of habitats. After its initial 
release on Oahu, the cannibal 
snail&apos;s population mushroomed. 
Migrating out of the low, drier 
areas, the snails headed for the 
mountain forests, where they con- 
tinue to feed on defenseless native 
land snails. To quote Van der 
Schalie, &quot;the establishment of 
Euglandina now appears a most 
serious error and this introduction 
may well prove ruinous to the na- 
tive endemic snails in the mountain 
regions.&quot; The evidence I have ac- 
cumulated during my survey gen- 
erally supports Van der Schalie&apos;s 
contentions. Nearly a dozen spe- 
cies of Achatinella, common a 
few decades ago, have disappeared 
since Euglandina invaded their 
former ranges. Populations of other 
Achatinella species have been 
seriously decimated by this deadly 
molluscan menace, particularly in 
the southern half of the Koolau 
range. In regions where Euglandina 
is long established, living 
Achatinella snails usually are very 
rare. Veteran Hawaii mountaineer 
Dick Davis, a frequent hiking part- 
ner, recalls seeing a prolific colony 
of A. taeniolata in the southern 
Koolau mountains during the mid- 
1960s. &quot;There were bushels of them 
all over the place, especially on the 
small olomea trees,&quot; he told me 
casually. I went to the same place a 
decade later and found numerous A . 
taeniolata shells, mingled with Eu- 
glandina shells, rotting on the 
ground. Today, A. taeniolata is ex- 
tremely rare and close to extinction. 
The giant African snail, however, 
can still be found in the lowlands. 

Searching for live Achatinella 
these days requires plenty of pa- 
tience, determination, and luck. 



Many of my quests have ended in 
failure. One day I hiked fourteen 
miles without seeing an/4 (;/u(///;e//a, 
although I knew that four species 
once occurred along the route. 
Hiking in Oahu&apos;s mountains can be 
difficult and often dangerous. Res- 
cues of lost, injured, or stranded 
hikers are common, and hiking- 
related deaths are high. The Wai- 
anae range is notorious for its knife- 
edge ridges; its precipitous slopes 
fall away in 1,500-foot — or more — 
drop-offs, and the crumbly volcanic 
rock and smooth, weathered boul- 
ders make treacherous footing. 

Finding a rare Achatinella spe- 
cies and knowing it still exists is my 
reward for the hardships of field- 
work. I have experienced the thrill 
of tentatively rediscovering three 
Achatinella species believed to be 
extinct on the basis of Kondo&apos;s pre- 
vious survey. Among themisA. lila, 
whose green varieties are regarded 
as Oahu&apos;s most beautiful living 
forest gems. 

F^iblic awareness of Achatinella&apos; s 
plight is scant. The majority of 
Oahu&apos;s cosmopolitan population 
lives in lowland areas and is more 
familiar with the human-introduced 
biota that dominates that region. 
The word &quot;snail&quot; would suggest 
giant African snails to most Oahu- 
ans. Rallying people to save a 
group of snails that have little, if 
any, contact with humans is all but 
impossible. When the average per- 
son sees a live Achatinella. he col- 
lects it. Hawaiian tree snails are sel- 
dom mentioned in popular litera- 
ture, and the only local exhibits of 
their shells are in several missionary 
house museums and periodic dis- 
plays at Bishop Museum. 

Most Hawaiian schools use North 
American biology textbooks and 
place little emphasis on Hawaii&apos;s 
natural history. A few enlightened 
teachers and outside lecturers help 
fill this void. I have noticed that 
most local young people respond 
with amazement, enthusiasm, and 
new-found pride when they learn 
about their singular Hawaiian natu- 
ral heritage. Fortunately, the Uni- 
versity of Hawaii offers popular 
courses in Hawaiian natural history, 
and various conservation groups 
conduct field trips emphasizing the 
native environment. 



Forest management on Oahu is 
dictated by a multiple-use concept, 
many people using forestlands for 
different purposes. However, this 
policy officially sanctions the ex- 
istence of feral animals in native 
forest areas for the benefit of Oahu&apos;s 
small number (about 0.7 percent) of 
local hunters. The presence of wild 
pigs, for example, is hardly com- 
patible with the health and welfare 
of remaining native forests. 

Oahu&apos;s endemic tree snails and 
their habitat have fallen victim to 
human ignorance and neglect. All 
that remains are scattered frag- 
ments of once delicately balanced 
ecosystems. Achatinella&apos;s ac- 
celerating decline indicates these 
snails are generally unable to adjust 
to the continuing alteration of their 
fragile insular environment brought 
about by modern civilization. The 
various factors responsible for 
Achatinella&apos;s deterioration are still 
present, and as Oahu&apos;s human 
population increases, new threats 
may arise. 

Time seems to be running out for 
many Achatinella species when we 
still have much to learn about them. 
The genus needs taxonomic revi- 
sion and many aspects of its biology 
and ecology are unknown. At the 
moment, no in-depth malacological 
fieldwork is under way on Oahu to 
tackle the immense problems facing 
the group. 

These animals have greatly ad- 
vanced our knowledge of organic 
evolution on oceanic islands. Yet, 
we are letting this important natural 
and scientific resource slip irre- 
trievably through our fingers. The 
presence of Achatinella snails adds 
priceless beauty, interest, and di- 
versity to Oahu&apos;s native forests. No 
effort should be spared to save what 
is left of these rapidly dwindling 
Hawaiian legacies. D 



The eyes of Achatinella 

apexfulva are located at the tips 

of the two upper tentacles. The two 

lower tentacles contain sensory 

organs that the snail uses to feel its 

way about. The snails travel about 

three inches a minute.

Hard Times among the Neanderthals 



Text and photographs by Erik Trinkaus 



Although life was difficult, 
these prehistoric people may 
not have been as exclusively 
brutish as usually supposed 

Throughout the century that fol- 
lowed the discovery in 1856 of the 
first recognized human fossil re- 
mains in the Neander Valley 
{Neanderthal in German) near 
Diisseldorf, Germany, the field of 
human paleontology has been beset 
with controversies. This has been 
especially true of interpretations of 
the Neanderthals, those frequently 
maligned people who occupied 
Europe and the Near East from 
about 100,000 years ago until the 
appearance of anatomically modern 
humans about 35,000 years ago. 

During the last two decades, 
however, a number of fossil dis- 
coveries, new analyses of previ- 
ously known remains, and more 
sophisticated models for interpret- 
ing subtle anatomical differences 
have led to a reevaluation of the 
Neanderthals and their place in 
human evolution. 

This recent work has shown that 
the often quoted reconstruction of 
the Neanderthals as semierect, 
lumbering caricatures of humanity 
is inaccurate. It was based on faulty 
anatomical interpretations that 
were reinforced by the intellectual 
biases of the turn of the century. 
Detailed comparisons of Neander- 
thal skeletal remains with those of 
modern humans have shown that 
there is nothing in Neanderthal 
anatomy that conclusively indicates 
locomotor, manipulative, intellec- 
tual, or linguistic abilities inferior 
to those of modern humans. Nean- 
derthals have therefore been added 
to the same species as ourselves — 
Homo sapiens — although they are 
usually placed in their own sub- 
species, Homo sapiens neander- 
thalensis. 

Despite these revisions, it is ap- 



parent that there are significant 
anatomical diflFerences between the 
Neanderthals and present-day hu- 
mans. If we are to understand the 
Neanderthals, we must formulate 
hypotheses as to why they evolved 
from earlier humans about 100,000 
years ago in Europe and the Near 
East, and why they were suddenly 
replaced about 35,000 years ago by 
peoples largely indistinguishable 
from ourselves. We must deter- 
mine, therefore, the behavioral sig- 
nificance of the anatomical differ- 
ences between the Neanderthals 
and other human groups, since it is 
patterns of successful behavior that 
dictate the direction of natural 
selection for a species. 

In the past, behavioral recon- 
structions of the Neanderthals and 
other prehistoric humans have been 
based largely on archeological data. 
Research has now reached the stage 
at which behavioral interpretations 
from the archeological record can 
be significantly supplemented by 
analyses of the fossils themselves. 
These analyses promise to tell us a 
considerable amount about the 
ways of the Neanderthals and may 
eventually help us to determine 
their evolutionary fate. 

One of the most characteristic 
features of the Neanderthals is the 
exaggerated massiveness of their 
trunk and limb bones. All of the 
preserved bones suggest a strength 
seldom attained by modern hu- 
mans. Furthermore, not only is this 
robustness present among the adult 
males, as one might expect, but it is 
also evident in the adult females, 
adolescents, and even children. The 
bones themselves reflect this hardi- 
ness in several ways. 

First, the muscle and ligament 
attachment areas are consistently 
enlarged and strongly marked. This 
implies large, highly developed 
muscles and ligaments capable of 
generating and sustaining great 



mechanical stress. Secondly, since 
the skeleton must be capable of 
supporting these levels of stress, 
which are frequently several times 
as great as body weight, the en- 
larged attachments for muscles 
and ligaments are associated with 
arm and leg bone shafts that have 
been reinforced. The shafts of all of 
the arm and leg bones are modified 
tubular structures that have to 
absorb stress from bending and 
twisting without fracturing. When 
the habitual load on a bone in- 
creases, the bone responds by lay- 
ing down more bone in those areas 
under the greatest stress. 

In addition, musculature and 
body momentum generate large 
forces across the joints. The car- 
tilage, which covers joint surfaces, 
can be relatively easily overworked 
to the point where it degenerates, 
as is indicated by the prevalence of 
arthritis in joints subjected to sig- 
nificant wear and tear over the 
years. When the surface area of a 
joint is increased, the force per unit 
area of cartilage is reduced , decreas- 
ing the pressure on the cartilage. 

Most of the robustness of Nean- 
derthal arm bones is seen in muscle 
and ligament attachments. All of 
the muscles that go from the trunk 
or the shoulder blade to the upper 
end of the arm show massive de- 
velopment. This applies in particu- 
lar to the muscles responsible for 
powerful downward movements of

the arm and, to a lesser extent, to 
muscles that stabihze the shoulder 
during vigorous movements. 

Virtually every major muscle or 
ligament attachment on the hand 
bones is clearly marked by a large 
roughened area or a crest, espe- 
cially the muscles used in grasping 
objects. In fact, Neanderthal hand 
bones frequently have clear bony 
crests, where on modern human 
ones it is barely possible to discern 



the attachment of the muscle on the 
dried bone. 

In addition, the flattened areas on 
the ends of the fingers, which pro- 
vide support for the nail and the 
pulp of the finger tip, are enormous 
among the Neanderthals. These 
areas on the thumb and the index 
and middle fingers are usually two 
to three times as large as those of 
similarly sized modern human 
hands. The overall impression is 



Diagonal lines on these two 
arm bones from Shanidar I are 
healed fractures. The bone on 
the right is normal. That on 
the left is atrophied and has 
a pathological tip, caused by 
either amputation or an 
improperly healed elbow fracture. 



one of arms to rival those of the 
mightiest blacksmith. 

Neanderthal legs are equally mas- 
sive; their strength is best illustrated 
in the development of the shafts of 
the leg bones. Modern human thigh 
and shin bones possess character- 
istic shaft shapes adapted to the 
habitual levels and directions of the 
stresses acting upon them. The 
shaft shapes of the Neanderthals 
are similar to those in modern hu- 
mans, but the cross-sectional areas 
of the shafts are much greater. This 
implies significantly higher levels 
of stress. 

Further evidence of the massive- 
ness of Neanderthal lower limbs is 
provided by the dimensions of their 
knee and ankle joints. All of these 
are larger than in modern humans, 
especially with respect to the over- 
all lengths of the bones. 

The development of their limb 
bones suggests that the Neander- 
thals frequently generated high 
levels of mechanical stress in their 
limbs. Since most mechanical stress 
in the body is produced by body 
momentum and muscular contrac- 
tion, it appears that the Neander- 
thals led extremely active lives. It is 
hard to conceive of what could have 
required such exertion, especially 
since the maintenance of vigorous 
muscular activity would have re- 
quired considerable expenditure of 
energy. That level of energy ex- 
penditure would undoubtedly have 
been maladaptive had it not been 
necessary for survival. 

The available evidence from the 
archeological material associated 
with the Neanderthals is equivocal 
on this matter. Most of the archeo- 
logical evidence at Middle Paleo- 
lithic sites concerns stone tool tech- 
nology and hunting activities. After 
relatively little change in technology 



60 



^Bm 



during the Middle Paleolithic (from 
about 100,000 years to 35,000 years 
before the present), the advent of 
the Upper Paleolithic appears to 
have brought significant technolog- 
ical advances. This transition about 
35,000 years ago is approximately 
coincident with the replacement of 
the Neanderthals by the earliest 
anatomically modern humans. 
However, the evidence for a sig- 
nificant change in hunting patterns 
is not evident in the animal remains 
left behind. Yet even if a correla- 
tion between the robustness of body 
build and the level of hunting effi- 
ciency could be demonstrated, it 
would only explain the ruggedness 
of the Neanderthal males. Since 
hunting is exclusively or at least 
predominantly a male activity 



among humans, and since Neander- 
thal females were in all respects as 
strongly built as the males, an alter- 
native explanation is required for 
the females. 

Some insight into why the Nean- 
derthals consistently possessed 
such massiveness is provided by a 
series of partial skeletons of Nean- 
derthals from the Shanidar Cave in 
northern Iraq. These fossils were 
excavated between 1953 and 1960 
by anthropologist Ralph Solecki of 
Columbia University and have been 
studied principally by T. Dale 
Stewart, an anthropologist at the 
Smithsonian Institution, and my- 
self. The most remarkable aspect 
of these skeletons is the number of 
healed injuries they contain. Four 
of the six reasonably complete adult 




skeletons show evidence of trauma 
during life. 

The identification of traumatic 
injury in human fossil remains has 
plagued paleontologists for years. 
There has been a tendency to con- 
sider any form of damage to a fossil 
as conclusive evidence of prehis- 
toric violence between humans if it 
resembles the breakage patterns 
caused by a direct blow with a 
heavy object. Hence a jaw with the 
teeth pushed in or a skull with a 
depressed fracture of the vault 
would be construed to indicate 
blows to the head. 

The central problem with these 
interpretations is that they ignore 
the possibility of damage after 
death. Bone is relatively fragile, es- 
pecially as compared with the rock 
and other sediment in which it is 
buried during fossilization. There- 
fore when several feet of sediment 
cause compression around fossil 
remains, the fossils will almost al- 
ways break. In fact, among the in- 
numerable cases of suggested 
violence between humans cited 
over the years, there are only a few 
exceptional examples that cannot 
be readily explained as the result 
of natural geologic forces acting 
after the death and burial of the 
individual. 

One of these examples is the 
trauma on the left ninth rib of the 
skeleton of Shanidar 3, a partially 
healed wound inflicted by a sharp 
object. The implement cut obliquely 
across the top of the ninth rib and 
probably pierced the underlying 
lung. Shanidar 3 almost certainly 
suffered a collapsed left lung and 
died several days or weeks later, 
probably as a result of secondary 
complications. This is deduced 
from the presence of bony spurs 
and increased density of the bone 
around the cut. 

The position of the wound on 



The ankle and big toe of 
Shanidar I&apos;s right foot show 
evidence of arthritis, which 
suggests an injury to those 
parts. The left foot is 
normal although incomplete. 



61 




The scar on the left ninth rib 
of Shanidar 3 is a partially 
healed wound inflicted by a 
sharp object. This wound is 
one of the few exan^ples of 
trauma caused by violence. 



the rib, the angle of the incision, 
and the cleanness of the cut make 
it highly unlikely that the injury was 
accidentally inflicted. In fact, the 
incision is almost exactly what 
would have resulted if Shanidar 3 
had been stabbed in the side by a 
right-handed adversary in face-to- 
face conflict. This wound there- 
fore provides conclusive evidence 
of violence between humans, the 
only evidence so far found of such 
violence among the Neanderthals. 
In most cases, however, it is im- 
possible to determine from fossil- 
ized remains the cause of an in- 
dividual&apos;s death. The instances that 
can be positively identified as pre- 
historic traumatic injury are those 



in which the injury was inflicted 
prior to death and some healing 
took place. Shortly after an injury 
to bone, whether a cut or a fracture, 
the damaged bone tissue is resorbed 
by the body and new bone tissue is 
laid down around the injured area. 
As long as irritation persists, new 
bone is deposited, creating a bulge 
or spurs of irregular bone extending 
into the soft tissue. If the irritation 
ceases, the bone will slowly re-form 
so as to approximate its previous, 
normal condition. However, except 
for superficial injuries or those sus- 
tained during early childhood, some 
trace of damage persists for the life 
of the individual. 

In terms of trauma, the most im- 
pressive of the Shanidar Neander- 
thals is the first adult discovered, 
known as Shanidar 1. This indi- 
vidual suffered a number of injuries, 
some of which may be related. On 
the right forehead there are scars 
from minor surface injuries, prob- 
ably superficial scalp cuts. The out- 
side of the left eye socket sustained 
a major blow that partially collapsed 
that part of the bony cavity, giving 
it a flat rather than a rounded con- 
tour. This injury possibly caused 
loss of sight in the left eye and path- 
ological alterations of the right side 
of the body. 

Shanidar I&apos;s left arm is largely 
preserved and fully normal. The 
right arm, however, consists of a 
highly atrophied but otherwise 
normal collarbone and shoulder 
blade and a highly abnormal upper 
arm bone shaft. That shaft is at- 
rophied to a fraction of the diame- 
ter of the left one but retains most 
of its original length. Furthermore, 
the lower end of the right arm bone 
has a healed fracture of the 
atrophied shaft and an irregular, 
pathological tip. The arm was ap- 
parently either intentionally ampu- 
tated just above the elbow or frac- 
tured at the elbow and never healed. 

This abnormal condition of the 
right arm does not appear to be a 
congenital malformation, since the 
length of the bone is close to the 
estimated length of the normal left 
upper arm bone. If, however, the 
injury to the left eye socket also 
affected the left side of the brain, 
directly or indirectly, by disrupting 
the blood supply to part of the 



brain, the result could have been 
partial paralysis of the right side. 
Motor and sensory control areas 
for the right side are located on the 
left side of the brain, slightly behind 
the left eye socket. This would ex- 
plain the atrophy of the whole right 
arm since loss of nervous stimula- 
tion will rapidly lead to atrophy of 
the affected muscles and bone. 

The abnormality of the right arm 
of Shanidar 1 is paralleled to a 
lesser extent in the right foot. The 
right ankle joint shows extensive 
arthritic degeneration, and one of 
the major joints of the inner arch of 
the right foot has been completely 
reworked by arthritis. The left foot, 
however, is totally free of pathol- 
ogy. Arthritis from normal stress 
usually affects both lower limbs 
equally; this degeneration therefore 
suggests that the arthritis in the 
right foot is a secondary result of an 
injury, perhaps a sprain, that would 
not otherwise be evident on skele- 
tal remains. This conclusion is sup- 
ported by a healed fracture of the 
right fifth instep bone, which makes 
up a major portion of the outer arch 
of the foot. These foot pathologies 
may be tied into the damage to the 
left side of the skull; partial paraly- 
sis of the right side would certainly 
weaken the leg and make it more 
susceptible to injury. 

The trauma evident on the other 
Shanidar Neanderthals is relatively 
minor by comparison. Shanidar 3, 
the individual who died of the rib 
wound, suffered debilitating arthri- 
tis of the right ankle and neighbor- 
ing foot joints, but lacks any evi- 
dence of pathology on the left foot; 
this suggests a superficial injury 
similar to the one sustained by 
Shanidar 1. Shanidar 4 had a healed 
broken rib. Shanidar 5 received a 
transverse blow across the left fore- 
head that left a large scar on the 
bone but does not appear to have 
affected the brain. 

None of these injuries necessar- 
ily provides evidence of deliberate 
violence among the Neanderthals; 
all of them could have been acci- 
dentally self-inflicted or acciden- 
tally caused by another individual. 
In either case, the impression 
gained of the Shanidar Neander- 
thals is of a group of invalids. The 
crucial variable, however, appears 



62 



i^Ka. 



to be age. All four of these indi- 
viduals died at relatively advanced 
ages, probably between 40 and 60 
years (estimating the age at death 
for Neanderthals beyond the age of 
25 is extremely difficult); they 
therefore had considerable time to 
accumulate the scars of past in- 
juries. Shanidar 2 and 6, the other 
reasonably complete Shanidar 
adults, lack evidence of trauma, but 
they both died young, probably 
before reaching 30. 

Other Neanderthal remains, all 
from Europe, exhibit the same pat- 
tern. Every fairly complete skele- 
ton of an elderly adult shows evi- 
dence of traumatic injuries. The 
original male skeleton from the 
Neander Valley had a fracture just 
below the elbow of the left arm, 
which probably limited movement 
of that arm for life. The &quot;old man&quot; 
from La Chapelle-aux-Saints, 
France, on whom most traditional 
reconstructions of the Neander- 
thals have been based, suflFered a 
broken rib. La Ferrassie 1, the old 
adult male from La Ferrassie, 
France, sustained a severe injury to 
the right hip, which may have im- 
paired his mobility. 

In addition, several younger spec- 
imens and ones of uncertain age 
show traces of trauma. La Quina 5, 
the young adult female from La 
Quina, France, was wounded on 
her right upper arm. A young adult 
from Sala, Czechoslovakia, was 
superficially wounded on the right 
forehead just above the brow. And 
an individual of unknown age and 
sex from the site of Krapina, Yugo- 
slavia, suffered a broken forearm, 
in which the bones never reunited 
after the fracture. 

This evidence suggests several 
things. First, life for the Neander- 
thals was rigorous. If they lived 
through childhood and early adult- 
hood, they did so bearing the scars 
of a harsh and dangerous life. Fur- 



thermore, this incidence of trauma 
correlates with the massiveness of 
the Neanderthals; a life style that 
so consistently involved injury 
would have required considerable 
strength and fortitude for survival. 
There is, however, another, 
more optimistic side to this. The 
presence of so many injuries in a 
prehistoric human group, many of 
which were debilitating and sus- 
tained years before death, shows 
that individuals were taken care of 
long after their economic useful- 
ness to the social group had ceased. 
It is perhaps no accident that 
among the Neanderthals, for the 
first time in human history, people 
lived to a comparatively old age. 
We also find among the Neander- 
thals the first intentional burials of 



the dead, some of which involved 
offerings. Despite the hardships of 
their life style, the Neanderthals 
apparently had a deep-seated re- 
spect and concern for each other. 
Taken together, these different 
pieces of information paint a pic- 
ture of life among the Neanderthals 
that, while harsh and dangerous, 
was not without personal security. 
Certainly the hardships the Nean- 
derthals endured were beyond 
those commonly experienced by 
modern peoples. Yet they provide 
the first evidence in the prehistoric 
record of human caring and respect 
as well as of violence between indi- 
viduals. Perhaps for these reasons, 
despite their physical appearance, 
the Neanderthals should be consid- 
ered the first modem humans. D

Mysterious Monthly Rhythms 

by John D. Palmer and Judith E. Goodenough 



Some plants and animals 
are governed by monthly 
biological clocks whose 
uses are not always clear 

The kind of procreation occurring 
in humans, in which sperm are inti- 
mately transferred to the protective 
innards of the female, falls under 
the broad category of internal fer- 
tilization. As exemplified by hu- 
mans, a high degree of cooperation 
is often required between the sexes 



to accomplish the act. The alterna- 
tive, more passive category, com- 
monly used by many aquatic or- 
ganisms, is external fertilization, 
where, in an offhand manner, or- 
ganisms simply liberate gametes 
into their environment and fertiliza- 
tion is mostly left to chance en- 
counters of egg and sperm. 

Since the pattern of external fer- 
tilization became established in 
nature, evolution has worked inex- 
orably to make it more adaptive, 
that is, to increase a sperm&apos;s 



chances of actually uniting with 
an egg. One variation has been to 
simply increase the number of 
gametes produced. While this is an 
obvious improvement, gamete pro- 
duction can take up as much of an 
animal&apos;s everyday life as feeding 
and individual survival. For in- 
stance, in contrast to the human 
female who releases just thirteen 
eggs per year, the female oyster 
produces and sheds over 500 million 
eggs during the same interval. Ob- 
viously, a great deal of the animal&apos;s

time and energy is consumed in 
this project, an endeavor that, lii&lt;e 
any form of reproduction, does not 
directly benefit the individual but 
does benefit the species. Obviously, 
a mechanism that insured the per- 
sistence of the species but was less 
taxing to the individual oyster 
would be a fine improvement. 

An oyster egg liberated into the 
sea must often drift for miles, re- 
maining viable all the while, be- 
fore — if ever — encountering a com- 
patible sperm. This weak point of 




Donald Smetzer 



external fertilization can be coun- 
teracted if organisms live in dense 
colonies so that gametes do not 
have to travel far to unite. And 
most species, including those with 
internal fertilization, also produce 
their gametes rhythmically , perhaps 
at new or full moon. This helps 
insure that fertilization will take 
place and at the same time releases 
the organism from a life of full-time 
gamete production. The Samoan 
palolo worm {Eunice viridis) is an 
organism that has such a rhythm 
and also lives in proximity to its 
fellows, in honeycombs of cracks 
and crevices in coral reefs sur- 
rounding Samoa and Fiji. 

Throughout most of the year this 
worm, like many other marine poly- 
chaetes, consists of a tentacle- 
bearing head followed by a string of 
more or less identical body seg- 
ments. During the year the worm 
elongates by budding new segments 
from its posterior end. As the fall 
reproductive season nears, the 
newly produced derriere, called an 
epitoke, becomes fully mature. 
Each new segment is mainly a 
gamete-making machine that pro- 
duces either eggs or sperm, depend- 
ing on the worm&apos;s sex. This prep- 
aration completed, the worms enter 
into a ritual that usually begins 
about dawn on the first day of the 
last quarter of the mOon in Novem- 
ber. As if on a given signal, the epi- 
tokes of all the mature worms on 
the reef break oflf and swim to the 
ocean surface. There the writhing 



hemiworms begin to churn the tran- 
quil ocean surface into a froth of de- 
cerebrate dancers. Then, again in a 
unison that appears to be a response 
to a universal command, the en- 
gorged epitokes explode, liberating 
their gametes into the sea. In this 
milky slurry, sperm finds egg and 
fertilization is consummated. Be- 
cause of the precise timing of the 
gamete liberation, external fertiliza- 
tion in this organism has become 
increasingly efficient. 

The natives of Fiji and Samoa are 
attuned to this worm&apos;s rhythms and 
performance. Just before dawn, the 
inhabitants position their canoes 
directly over the reefs where the 
worms will rise. When the worms&apos; 
swarming frenzy commences, is- 
landers scoop up strainers full and 
carry them back to their villages. 
Then, while Americans sit down to 
Thanksgiving turkey, the islanders

also feast, their entree being de- 
licious roast paiolo epitokes. 

Another marine polychaete 
worm, Platynereis megalops, lactcs 
the paiolo&apos; s interest for the gour- 
mand but does provide an example 
of a further evolutionary improve- 
ment in fertilization success. In this 
animal&apos;s case, synchronization of 
reproductive readiness is coupled 
with a means of overcoming a lack 
of intromittent organs. Only during 
the summer months, between the 
last quarter of the moon and the 
new moon, does P. megalops pro- 
duce gametes. Each evening during 
these intervals, for just two hours, 
the small reddish males of this spe- 
cies swim to the surface and dart 
rapidly around in roller coaster 
fashion. Soon the pale yellow fe- 
males, their bodies lumpy with 
eggs, appear from the depths. Both 
males and females then begin a rit- 
ual that signals the last night of their 
lives. Unlike the males, the females&apos; 
swollen bodies move sluggishly 
through the sea, for at this stage 
they are little more than swimming 
ovaries. When a male meets such a 
female, he immediately begins his 
nuptial dance of high-speed loop the 
loops. His gyrations culminate as 
he tightly entwines the female&apos;s 
body with his in a head-to-tail 
alignment. Thus embraced, she 
turns her head as if seeking his tail. 
Looping one last coil of his body 
around her head, he inserts his tail 
into her mouth. His intestine has 
become riddled with perforations, 
and now the sperm from his body 
cavity are swept through these 
holes into his gut and out his anus 
into the female. Her digestive tract 
has also become perforated so that 
the sperm move directly to the ripe 
eggs stored in her body cavity and 
fertilize them. Large rents then ap- 
pear in her body and the newly 
formed zygotes escape into the sea, 
where they must develop on their 
own. The shredded body of the 
female sinks to the sea bottom, 
where she dies. The cavalier male 
may mate with several more fe- 
males that night before he, too, dies. 

Many marine algae also liberate 
their eggs and sperm on a periodic 
basis. Field ecologists have studied 
the brown algae Dictyota dicho- 
toma most extensively, and as 




early as 1905, researchers learned 
that during the summertime, gam- 
etes of both sexes were shed into 
the sea twice each month, where 
fertilization was left to chance. The 
precise timing of gamete release at- 
tracted inquisitive botanists who 
wanted to learn the mechanism of 
control. The brown algae were 
therefore brought into laboratories 
and placed in aquariums where ex- 
ternal conditions could be varied at 
the will of the observers. The algae 
were kept in man-made light-dark 
cycles, although the length of the 
period of illumination mimicked the 
long days of summer. Thus isolated 
from their natural environment, the 
algae did not release gametes at pre- 
cise intervals. However, experi- 
menters could reestablish periodic- 
ity by leaving the lights over the 
aquariums on for just one night to 
simulate full moon. Nine days later, 
for an interval of about three days, 
the algae shed a few gametes daily. 
Gamete production then stopped, 
but about seventeen days later a 
second, much larger burst occurred. 
And from this time on, at approxi- 
mately seventeen-day intervals, the 
algae liberated gametes, thus dis- 
playing an approximate bimodal 
monthly rhythm. Isolation in the 
laboratory meant that algae were 



not receiving any cues as to the day 
of the month. But the algae acted as 
if they possessed a living clock 
within their tissues. 

Hence, one of the best improve- 
ments evolution has made on exter- 
nal fertilization is synchronization 
of the mating readiness of male 
and female, as in internal fertiliza- 
tion. Furthermore, the phase of this 
readiness has been tuned to partic- 
ular stages of the moon&apos;s waxing 
and waning so that, depending on 
the organism, gamete liberation is 
often synchronized with full or last- 
quarter moon, when the moon is 
visible above the horizon at night. 
And evolution has carried the mod- 
ifications even further by providing 
each organism with its own means 
of timing, a biological clock that 
signals in advance when full moon 
is due. Thus the organism can com- 
plete the physiological prepara- 
tions for breeding before the impor- 
tant night. The possession of a 
monthly clock is a feature of many 
organisms, but the uses some ani- 
mals make of this clock are not as 
obviously adaptive as those of the 
Samoan paiolo worm or the brown 
algae. 

For instance, the ant lion displays 
a curious clock-controlled rhythm.

ories of playfully dangling grass 
stalks into the conical pits con- 
structed by ant lions, which then 
hurled sand at the presumed prey. 
The ant lion is a six-legged larval 
insect with an oval body and a pair 
of extraordinarily long, hollow jaws 
with which it sucks the juices from 
its victims&quot; bodies. Widely distrib- 
uted in sandy areas of the United 
States, the ant lion digs a pit in the 
sand, then waits at the base for 
small insects, primarily ants, to 
slide into the trap. To insure the 
victim&apos;s capture, the ant lion tosses 
sand at it, causing it to quickly slide 
into the open jaws at the pit bottom. 



When researchers made careful 
daily measurements of the size of 
these pits, they observed that the 
volume of pits is greater around the 
days of full moon than those of new 
moon. This monthly rhythm in pit 
volume will persist even when the 
ant lions are cloistered for months 
at a time in the laboratory in con- 
stant darkness and temperature. 

There have been several attempts 
to explain this rhythm, but when 
each hypothesis was experimentally 
explored, it had to be discarded. 
The most plausible suggestion was 
that the size of the pit must vary 
with the availability of food. Ants

by ant lions varies in a monthly

can escape more easily from small 
pits, so the large pits constructed at 
full moon would be more efficient 
traps. But when these small inverte- 
brates known to be relished by ant 
lions were trapped nightly in the 
surrounding habitat, there was no 
indication that their numbers cycled 
in abundance. Furthermore, limit- 
ing captured ant lions to one ant per 
day had no eflFect on the monthly 
pit-volume rhythm. 

Another rhythm for which there 
is no apparent adaptive purpose 
occurs in a freshwater planarian, 
a small flatworm. Researchers 
accidentally discovered that when 
a population of flatworms is main- 
tained in the laboratory, the angle 
each worm assumes in swimming 
away from a lighted area varies with 
the phase of the moon. A very

simple apparatus, a great deal of pa- 
tience, and a high tolerance for re- 
petitive observations are all that are 
required for the study of this spatial 
orientation rhythm. The apparatus 
consists of a grid marked off into 5° 
sectors, with a small dish of pond 
water placed over it. A flatworm is 
positioned in the dish at a starting 
point, and the angle it assumes in 
escaping from two beams of light is 
measured by noting the sector it is 
in as it crosses a finish line. When 
many worms are tested in this way, 
and the average angle assumed by 
all the worms plotted for each day 
of the month, the angle at which the 
animals turn away from the lights is 
greater at one time of the month 
than at another. This rhythm also 
persists in the absence of all com-

mon environmental time cues, 
meaning that planarians also pos- 
sess a monthly clock. 

The prevalence of monthly 
rhythms, and their persistence in 
constant laboratory conditions, has 
triggered a considerable amount of 
speculation about the nature of the 
biological clock that governs them. 
One popular explanation is that a 
monthly rhythm is produced by the 
interaction of two other rhythms, 
one having a solar day period (24 
hours), the other, a lunar one (24.8 
hours). Rhythms with both these 
period lengths are very common 
throughout the plant and animal 
kingdoms. As examples, solar-day 
rhythms are expressed as sleep- 
wakefulness alternations in cock- 
roaches, birds, and rats, as well as 
in humans. Solar-day rhythms rule 
cell division in mice and men, food 
gathering in bees, and respiration 
and photosynthesis in plants. Even 
single-celled organisms display 
such rhythms. Lunar-day rhythms 
are also common, especially among 
shore-dwelling organisms. Many 



beach crabs scurry about the tidal 
flats during low tide, but return to 
their burrows shortly before high 
tide for the duration of inundation. 
Living clocks control both solar- 
and lunar-day rhythms. An ability 
to measure these intervals of time is 
highly adaptive because it allows 
organisms to anticipate and prepare 
for regular changes of the environ- 
ment, such as the coming sunrise, 
the next high tide, and so on. 

Some organisms — especially 
those living in the intertidal zones 
of seacoasts — display both solar- 
and lunar-day rhythms, often in the 
same physiological or behavioral 
process. The common fiddler crab 
darkens its body coloring during the 
daytime and also during each low 
tide. Thus when low tide occurs 
during the daylight hours, the crabs 
become especially dark. 

In a particular organism, solar- 
and lunar-day clocks may interact 
to generate a monthly rhythm. The 
peak of a solar-day rhythm comes, 
of course, at the same time each 
day. Because the lunar-day rhythm 
is 24.8 hours in length, its single 
peak occurs, like tides, fifty min- 
utes later each day. Only once a 
month do the peaks of lunar- and 
solar-day rhythms coincide, and 
then, because their eflfects are addi- 
tive, the process controlled by the 
clocks reaches an extreme value, as 
when the fiddler crab&apos;s body color 
becomes extremely dark. This idea 
of the generation of monthly 
rhythms is called the beat hypothe-

sis, and it can be tested quite simply. 

Solar-day rhythms will synchro- 
nize with artificial day-night cycles 
created in the laboratory. For ex- 
ample, a typical 24-hour biological 
rhythm will become 20 hours long 
when an experimental animal is 
subjected to light-dark cycles con- 
sisting of 10 hours of light, alter- 
nating with 10 hours of darkness. 
Lunar-day cycles ignore the trans- 
muted day lengths. Therefore, the 
following experiment was per- 
formed with the planarian spatial 
orientation rhythm. 

Populations of these flatworms 
were maintained under different 
light regimes. One group was kept 
in a light-dark cycle with 12 hours 
of light and 12 hours of darkness — 
a 24-hour day . According to the beat 
hypothesis, the 24-hour solar-day 
rhythm would interact with a lunar- 
day rhythm to produce a monthly 
peak at approximately thirty-day 
intervals. A second group of pla- 
narians was exposed to 20-hour 
days, a light-dark cycle of 10 hours 
of light followed by 10 hours of 
darkness. This slight shortening 
causes the solar-day rhythm to align 
with the lunar-day rhythm at scant 
five-day intervals. A third group, 
exposed to 28-hour days, would 
cause the new daily rhythm to inter- 
act with a lunar one at seven- to 
eight-day intervals. 

The orientation responses of 
these groups of planarians were fol- 
lowed for several months. All three 
groups displayed the same approxi- 



mately thirty-day rhythm. Evi- 
dently the planarian monthly oscil- 
lation is not produced by a beat 
phenomenon between lunar- and 
solar-day clocks. 

Perhaps organisms also possess 
a slow-running clock that is capable 
of measuring monthly intervals. If 
this is true, the mechanism of the 
monthly horologe may be similar to 
that of the clocks driving solar- and 
lunar-day rhythms. 

The best way to test for a similar- 
ity in mechanism would be to see 
whether the monthly clock shares 
the well-documented sensitivity of 
the solar-day oscillator to a chemi- 
cal called deuterium oxide, or heavy 
water. When administered to an 
animal or plant in the constancy of 
the laboratory, deuterium oxide 
will increase the period length of a 
solar-day rhythm. If monthly 
rhythms were also lengthened by 
this substance, this might indicate 
a similarity in the mechanisms of 
these two biological pacemakers. 

To apply this test to the pla- 
narian spatial orientation rhythm, 
groups of the flatworms were cul- 
tured in low concentrations of heavy 
water. But deuterium oxide had no 
eflFect on the period length of the 
animals&apos; monthly rhythm. While 
this finding certainly does not pre- 
clude the existence of an endoge- 
nous monthly clock, it does indi- 
cate that if such a clock exists, its 
mechanism is somewhat different 
from that of a solar-day clock. 

Another hypothesis to explain 



monthly rhythmicity suggests that 
the required timing information is 
obtained from some geophysical 
force in the environment that under- 
goes a monthly rhythm in intensity, 
is able to penetrate the constancy of 
the laboratory, and can be used by 
organisms to sense the day of the 
month. In this case, the biological 
clock would be a receiving and sig- 
naling mechanism within the organ- 
ism that can couple this subtle 
environmental information to be- 
havioral and physiological proc- 
esses. Although organisms are sen- 
sitive to an array of geophysical 
forces, including magnetism, elec- 
trostatic fields, and background 
radiation, there is as yet no proof 
that one force is the key to the 
generation of monthly rhythms. 

Thus, as so often happens in the 
early stages of a new scientific en- 
deavor, there is no proven explana- 
tion for a very evident biological 
phenomenon. Although the wide- 
spread distribution of monthly 
rhythms throughout the living king- 
dom emphasizes their importance, 
the adaptive significance and even 
the function of some remain ob- 
scure. Because these rhythms per- 
sist in organisms deprived a view of 
day-night alternations and the 
changing faces of the moon, they 
must be controlled by some sort of 
clock within living cells. At present, 
there are few clues to this clock&apos;s 
mechanism, but there are some 
indications as to what it is not. 
Apparently its periodicity is not 
generated by an interaction of the 
shorter frequency solar- and lunar- 
day cycles, and the mechanism 
seems to be physiologically differ- 
ent from that of a solar-day clock. 
Each month, the full moon reminds 
us of its importance to life on earth 
and of the way the interval created 
by its waxing and waning is mim- 
icked in many organismic physio- 
logical and behavioral processes. D

Instead of remaining 
solitary and unicellular 
like other soil amoebae, 
some slime molds become 
social and multicellular 

The great advances of molecular 
biology in the past forty years 
come largely from the study of a 
single bacterium, Escherichia coli. 
This primitive procaryotic organ- 
ism, which lives in the intestine of 
man and other animals, can be 
easily grown in the laboratory. Its 
generation time, depending on con- 
ditions, is between twenty minutes 
and one hour, and the total number 
of genes and other molecules this 
minute organism possesses is small 
compared with any higher animal 
or plant. 

In the last few years, however, 
scientists have been pondering a 
new and important question: Do all 
the wonderful facts and principles 
that apply to E. coli and that have 
revolutionized molecular biology 
also apply to higher organisms like 
man? Most workers agree that un- 
derstanding the mechanism of how 
a higher organism develops is of 
enormous interest and importance. 
The obvious first step is to see what 
principles derived from E. coU apply 
and what new ones must be dis- 
covered. 

But how can biologists and bio- 
chemists best attack the problem of 
the development of higher or- 
ganisms? Experimenters cannot, 
after all, experiment on man, and 
even mice and rats are enormously 
complex and slow in their growth. 
Nevertheless, such studies on the 
embryos of many animals, including 
sea urchins and salamanders, have 
been pursued for the last hundred or 



70 



more years and we know many of the 
basic, overriding rules of develop- 
ment. What we want to understand 
are the underlying molecular mech- 
anisms. 

Looking for a simpler system 
that can be analyzed in its minutest 
parts, some biologists have very 
successfully turned to tissue cul- 
ture, the growing of mammalian 
cells of different tissues in suitable 
nutrients in the laboratory, much 
as E. coli is grown. In this way 
the differentiation of one cell type 
or the interaction between a few 
cell types can be studied in molec- 
ular detail. Other biologists have 
picked lower multicellular organ- 
isms that have a simple, relatively 
short growth cycle and some of the 
properties of mammalian develop- 
ment. The cellular slime molds are 
such organisms. 

True slime molds (myxomycetes) 
are primitive organisms that have 
both funguslike and protozoalike 
properties. In their feeding stage, 
they are multinucleate: their nuclei 
are not separated into cellular com- 
partments. They are capable of 
movement and absorb organic food 
from vegetable matter and bacteria 
as they move in moist soil and 
across logs, twigs, and leaves 
decaying on the forest floor. Cel- 
lular slime molds are another form 
in which individual amoebae ag- 
gregate without fusing to form a 
multicellular fruiting structure. 



As a potential spore tower 

rises higher, it grows thinner 

at the base, where amoebae 

continue to stream in.

After slime mold amoebae have

to come together to form

or skin, of each hump are 

thousands of amoebae.

Cellular slime molds have been 
known for over a hundred years, 
but the current vi&apos;ave of interest 
started in 1935 with the discovery 
of the species Dictyostelium dis- 
coideum. In some respects, it is a 
multicellular E. coli, a cooperative 
eucaryote suitable for experimental 
molecular studies on development. 

But in many ways the most re- 
markable aspect of the cellular 
slime molds is their life history. 
When I began working on them in 
the 1940s, every time I gave a talk 
on my research I would have to 
spend at least fifteen minutes on 
their life cycle, and when the ques- 
tion period came, I always felt 
people were far more interested in 
the strangeness of the organisms 
than in my experiments. In the 
intervening years, Dictyostelium 
has almost become a household 
word among biologists. Dictyo- 
stelium is a genus of soil organism 
in which the principal cell unit is an 
amoeba. The feeding cells of cel- 
lular slime molds are among the 
common amoebae found in the soil 
and appear to be closely related to 
the solitary soil amoebae, which 
have been known to the zoologist 
for many years. At the feeding 
stage, cellular slime mold amoebae 
are, in fact, indistinguishable from 
other amoebae, for they also are 
solitary; they have not yet entered 
their multicellular, or &quot;social,&quot; 
stage. This is a very important 
feature of their life history: they 
feed and divide (grow) as separate 
cells, mopping up the bacteria in the 
soil and leaf humus. In this way the 
process of growth is separate in 
time from the form-making proc- 
esses, called morphogenesis, and 
the division of labor among the 
cells, called differentiation. Be- 
cause of this separation, the two 
fundamental processes of develop- 
ment can be studied independently.

of bacteria, the independent 
amoebae will suddenly become 
/Strongly attracted to one another 
and join together in large masses 
of cells. The trigger for this aggrega- 
tion of cells is starvation. The 
amoebae are attracted both to one 
another and to central collection 
points; the result is a series of 
beautiful streams of elongate 
amoebae, which enter the centers 
like the spokes of a feathery crystal. 
We now know that the amoebae are 
attracted to one another by a 
chemical substance called acrasin, 
which is given oflF by the amoebae 
themselves. 

There also exists another sub- 
stance, an antiacrasin — perhaps 
better called an acrasinase — that 
destroys acrasin. Acrasinase is a 
protein enzyme that destroys the 
active acrasin, much as the en- 
zymes in our stomach break down 
the food we eat. The chemical 
identity of both the acrasin and 
the acrasinase of some species, in- 
cluding D. discoideum, was dis- 
covered about ten years ago. Their 
acrasin is a small molecule called 
cyclic AMP, which also plays an 
important part in many of the 
chemical signaling systems in our 
own bodies, including a role in 
the action of hormones and the 
transmission of impulses from one 
nerve to another. Because this 
particular chemical messenger is 
so important in general for all living 
forms, many scientists have be- 
come particularly interested in the 
study of D. discoideum acrasin. 
Again, the acrasinase is an enzyme 
very similar to one that breaks 
down cyclic AMP in the body of 
any higher animal. 

Once the amoebae have all come 
together into a mass, they form a 
cigar-shaped structure, sometimes 
called a slug. Slugs vary in size 
from 0.2 millimeters, containing 
only a few hundred cells, to large 
ones of up to 2.5 millimeters, con- 
taining many thousands of cells. If 



the conditions are right, and these 
seem to include high humidity 
(recent studies suggest that high 
atmospheric ammonia also helps), 
the slug will migrate for long pe- 
riods of time. It is very sensitive 
to its environment and will go 
toward exceedingly faint sources 
of light and up very slight tem- 
perature gradients. After a period 
of this directed migration, again if 
conditions are right, the slug will 
stop its migration and begin the 
formation of the final fruiting body. 
The conditions that favor this step 
are a decrease in the humidity; an 
increase in the overall light, which 
may lower the humidity; and a 
decrease in the ammonia content 
of the air. 

The building of the fruiting body, 
or culmination stage, is a complex 
process, involving a simultaneous 
movement of the cells and cell 
differentiation into two cell types: 
the stalk cells and the spores. The 
anterior cells of the slug are des- 
tined to become stalk cells. They 
first form inside the tip of the 



upright slug, and by continually 
forming new stalk cells at the tip, 
push the stalk shaft down through 
the posterior cells to the sub- 
stratum. The presumptive stalk 
cells then keep moving to the tip 
where they become trapped in a 
cellulose cylinder that they have 
secreted; their movement is like 
that of a fountain where the water 
is moving backward. As the cells 
become part of the stalk tip, they 
swell, becoming engorged like 
plant pith cells, and die. Each dead 
stalk cell is surrounded by a thick 
cellulose wall and lies within a 
delicate, tapering cellulose cylin- 
der. In D. discoideum the cylinders 
may rise 0.1 to 5 millimeters into 
the air. All the posterior cells be- 
come spores and are lifted as a 



This spore tower is midway in 
its upward voyage. The spores 
mature as the tower rises.

group by the rising stalk cells. The 
end result is a minuscule model of 
a slender water tower. Each spore 
is a single amoeba encapsulated in 
a cellulose wall that is resistant 
to periods of drought and other 
harsh environmental conditions. If 
any one of these spores is sown in 
an environment suitable for growth, 
it will split open and the emerging 
amoeba can start a new generation. 

Some species or strains of slime 
mold possess two other kinds of 
resistant bodies. One is a micro- 
cyst formed in a number of species 
related to D. discoideum. Micro- 
cysts form without aggregation; 
after feeding, each individual 
amoeba encysts and forms a thick 
cellulose wall. In this respect it is 
identical to many of the solitary 
soil amoebae, which never have 
any social stages at all. Apparently, 
in the microcyst-forming slime 
molds, the question of whether the 
amoebae will form microcysts or 
whether they will aggregate and 
form fruiting bodies depends on the 
environmental conditions. In par- 
ticular, a high concentration of am- 
monia favors the microcyst route, 
while low ammonia produces nor- 
mal fruiting bodies. 

The other resistant body is the 
macrocyst, a large globule that has 
recently been shown to be the 
species&quot; sexual stage. If the amoe- 
bae of opposite mating types find 
one another, and the environmental 
conditions are favorable, they 
loosely aggregate together. There 
will be a fusion of two cells, the 
start of the cyst, and a series of 
interesting changes in the cell ac- 
tivity inside the cyst. Ultimately, 
when the macrocyst germinates, it 
produces amoebae that share genes 
from both parents. Among the con- 
ditions that favor macrocyst forma- 
tion is extreme moisture, especially 
a flood, which submerges the cells. 




Macrocysts also form better in the 
dark. Regular fruiting bodies are 
favored in the light; some species 
must have light to culminate. 

To understand the evolution and 
ecology of cellular slime molds, an 
investigator must ask why they 
have these social, multicellular 
stages; why do they not remain 
unicellular like other soil amoebae? 
After all, they feed as separate 
cells; they could easily encyst, as 
the microcyst-forming species do 
some of the time. Furthermore, 
making multicellular masses is a 
costly process: all the stalk cells 
die. Since stalk cells represent 
about one-third to one-fourth of the 
cells (even more in some species), 
the organism must make a consider- 
able sacrifice to produce the pretty 
little structures that shoot up into 
the air. The added expense means 
fewer spores, which could mean 
fewer chances that genes are per- 
petuated in future generations. 

As a staunch believer in Dar- 
winian principles of evolution and 
natural selection, I can only con- 



clude that there must be some ad- 
vantages that more than offset 
these disadvantages. And those 
advantages must specifically be 
ones that provide reproductive 
success. There must be something 
about a fruiting body sticking up 
into the air that makes reproduction 
more effective, at least in some cir- 
cumstances, than solitary cysts. If 
this were not the case, the social 
amoebae would never have arisen 
during the course of evolution. 

Becoming multicellular is not a 
feature unique to cellular slime 
molds; there are even other un- 
related organisms that do so by a 
similar cell aggregation. Multi- 
cellularity must have developed 
many times during the course of 
evolution, and each time there is a 
similar problem of cost. Moreover, 
the cost increases with the size 
of the animal. Human beings are 
immensely expensive in the sense 
that the proportion of our cells 
involved in reproduction is minute. 
All the rest of our tissues die each 
generation. In modern Darwinian 



76 




terms, our bodies are nothing more 
than complex carriers for the genes 
in our reproductive cells. Large, 
complex bodies eiFectively protect 
their genes in the competition with 
other organisms for food, for sur- 
vival. Large bodies are one possible 
strategy that small ones cannot 
manage. Thus, large animals find 
new ways to perpetuate and per- 
haps even increase the number 
of copies of their genes in succes- 
sive generations. 
There is one more point that is 



at the nub of sociobiologists&apos; ideas 
concerning kin selection. They say 
that one reason why the many so- 
cial animals congregate together is 
to protect their genes. Hence, altru- 
ism toward closely related individ- 
uals could be construed as a selfish 
act in which one organism is insur- 
ing the protection of genes identical 
to its own. These shared genes will 
be especially prevalent in imme- 
diate relatives. This sociobiological 
argument applies with full force to 
cellular slime molds. If all the

amoebae in a small region of the 
forest humus come initially from 
one spore, the whole population 
(which results from a series of 
binary fissions of the original 
amoeba) will then be genetically 
identical; each amoeba will have 



77 



the same genes. The amoebae then 
have a very strong reason to help 
one another, and the altruistic 
sacrifice of the dying stalls cells 
is mitigated because all the spores 
share their genes and will carry life 
onward. 

While these arguments make it 
reasonable that cells closely related 
genetically could help one another, 
they do not explain what the spe- 
cific gains might be for small fruit- 
ing bodies in the soil. The most 
obvious hypothesis is that the 
fruiting bodies provide a more 
effective dispersal of spores. There 
must be some circumstances in 
which having the spores up in the 
air on a small stalk helps spread 
them over greater distances and 
gives them a better chance of start- 
ing new generations. Hints as to 
what these advantages might be 
come from a number of properties 
of the fruiting bodies. 

First, they will always rise at 
right angles from the substratum. 
As they rise into the air, they give 
ofiF a repellent gas. The fruiting 
bodies concentrate the gas equally 
on all sides, thus maintaining a 
perpendicular orientation. If two 
fruiting bodies rise side by side, 
they will lean away from one an- 
other. If they rise near a cleft, a 
crack, or a tunnel in the soil, they 
will always lie in the middle of the 
space available. Thus the 
spore mass will be in a position 
where the chances of its being 
touched by a passing worm or 
insect or other soil invertebrate are 
maximal. If any object touches a 
mass of mature spores, they will 
immediately stick to the passing 
body, much as a water drop might 
be transferred from the tip of a pin 
to a finger brushing by. Scientists 
do not know whether this is pre- 
cisely what happens in the soil, but 
it is a reasonable guess. If attaching 
spores to passing animals is an ef- 
fective method of dispersal, then 
this could more easily be achieved 
by multicellular fruiting bodies than 
by solitary microcysts. 

The multicellular slime mold 
shows additional clever adaptations 
that further help effective dispersal 
of the spores. For instance, feeding 
must occur in a thin film of water 
where bacteria will grow. This is 



probably not the ideal place to 
meet passing insects and other 
animals, so D. discoideum has 
devised a method of migrating from 
the feeding region to an optimal 
spore-dispersal region. The slug can 
migrate considerable distances and 
will move toward sources of light 
and heat. In the soil this means 
closer to the surface. But the slug 
is at a vulnerable stage; to avoid 
shriveling, it requires a high hu- 
midity. An extremely slight drop in 
humidity, an increase in light 
(which may affect the humidity), 
and a decrease in the ammonia 
fumes all conspire to signal the slug 
to begin its fruiting, its culmination. 
Presumably, the reason this system 
is so sensitive is that it provides 
sufficient time for fruiting to occur 
before external conditions become 
dangerously dry. 

This question of timing may be 
why some species have both fruit- 
ing bodies and the more primitive 
microcysts. Building fruiting bodies 
requires some time, but microcysts 
can be formed quickly. If adverse 
conditions come on too rapidly, the 
microcyst route might be the safer 
one. Also, having two methods 
reduces the risk of being wiped out 
completely, and for some species 
this risk might be greater than 
others. The only clue is that high 
ammonia gas pushes the amoebae 
into the microcyst route. Perhaps in 
some places where there is a large 
breakdown of proteins due to de- 
composition by bacteria and other 
microorganisms, the richness of the 
degradation makes fruiting body 
formation impossible; the bodies 
would be poisoned. To avoid this 
fate, the slime molds quickly form 
microcysts. In such a nutrient-rich 
area, after the decomposition has 
subsided, the microcysts may split 
open and liberate their amoebae, 
which then produce a normal life 
cycle with fruiting bodies that are 
effective in dispersal. In D. dis- 
coideum. ammonia favors migra- 
tion, permitting the slug to move 
away from the toxic region. 

An explanation for macrocysts 
might be somewhat different. Since 
the prime stimuli for macrocyst 
formation are an excess of water 
and darkness, one argument could 
be that normal fruiting bodies and 



microcysts protect the genes when 
there is a drought, while macro- 
cysts are the protection mechanism 
for a flood. If the rains come and 
the amoebae are still feeding in the 
dark underground, they can rally, 
even when submerged, and produce 
a macrocyst. If they did not, they 
would die: slime mold amoebae 
cannot survive long periods under- 
water, but the tough macrocyst 
can. There is one possible objec- 
tion: that this could only occur if 
both mating types happened to be 
together at the same time as the 
downpour. For some strains this 
would certainly be true. However, 
there are other strains that are ap- 
parently capable of self-fertilization 
and therefore could form macro- 
cysts without a partner. 

Strains that always self-fertilize 
have lost the ability to take ad- 
vantage of the gene reshuffling that 
makes sexuality such an important 
mechanism in governing variation 
for evolution. From a genetic point 
of view, self-fertilization amounts 
to asexual reproduction. But if 
opposite mating types come to- 
gether, then there are all sorts of 
chances for gene rearrangements; 
the offspring that crop out of the 
macrocysts will show a new range 
of variation, that is, some combina- 
tion of the characters of the parents. 
One could argue that if the new 
amoebae that appear after a major 
environmental upheaval, such as a 
heavy rain, are facing a changed 
environment, some of the variable 
amoebae that issue forth from the 
macrocyst might be especially well 
suited in the competition for food 
and effective dispersal in the new 
environment. This would be a per- 
fect example of natural selection at 
work in a changing external world. 

I have argued that cellular slime 
molds have become social because 
a multicellular fruiting body is an

single amoeba may emerge to

eiFective way of spreading. There is 
another reason to support this ar- 
gument. In soil and in humus, and 
on the surface of any object in a 
moist forest environment, there are 
multitudes of small, spore-bearing 
fruiting bodies of many diflFerent 
species other than cellular slime 
molds, which are not the only ones 
y to have exploited this method of 
dispersing their spores. Most of the 
other species that do this are fungi. 
They vary enormously in size, and 



one can find a range from micro- 
scopic molds, whose fruiting bodies 
are no larger than those of small 
cellular slime molds, to huge mush- 
rooms. Some molds rely on insects 
and passing animals to spread the 
spores, while others use wind and 
even moving water. Besides the 
myriad fungi, there are the true 
slime molds (myxomycetes), which 
have quite a diflFerent kind of life 
cycle from the cellular slime molds 
discussed here. Finally, there are 



even examples among bacteria. The 
slime bacteria (myxobacteria) are 
social in a way that is remarkably 
parallel to Dictyosteliiim. and they 
produce minute fruiting bodies up 
to a millimeter in height. If this 
kind of dispersal structure is so 
widespread and has been developed 
in so many lower organisms, it is 
probably adaptively advantageous. 
In each case, the selective advan- 
tages have been well worth the cost 
of construction. D

The Inner Eskimo 



The Last and First Eskimos, 
text by Robert Coles, photographs 
by Alex Harris. New York Graphic 
Society, $19.95: 160 pp., illiis. 

White visitors to the Arctic often 
react strongly to that vividly diflfer- 
ent environment with its striking 
patterns of light and darkness, its 
bitter winters and giddily bright, 
soft summers. The summers they 
find exhilarating, although some 
are troubled by the sunlit nights, 
which make sleep come slowly. 
The winters are felt as burdensome 
and depressing, restrictive of both 
outer and inner movement. 

Visitors who have dealings with 
Eskimo, who &quot;study&quot; them or live 
with them for shorter or longer 
periods, often come away with the 
impression that Eskimo personality 
is predominantly practical, prag- 
matic, finely tuned to coping with 
a physically demanding environ- 
ment, but lacking in introspective, 
reflective, and imaginative qual- 
ities. Reading such accounts, one 



sometimes wenders whether Es- 
kimo have an aesthetic sense — 
whether they notice the changing 
seasons in other than practical 
terms, such as, time to move to a 
new campsite, to get out the boat or 
put away the snowmobile. 

Robert Coles&apos;s book The Last 
and First Eskimos is a good anti- 
dote to this overly simple view of 
Eskimo personality. One has the 
impression that the four Eskimo 
who speak through his text are both 
aesthetically alive and emotionally 
absorbed — at times with a tor- 
mented intensity — in their physical 
environment. Coles has focused 
each of his four chapters on one of 
the striking physical phenomena 
that characterize the Arctic scene: 
winter darkness, wind and snow- 
storms, the 24-hour daylight of 
summer, and the vast spaces of the 
north Alaskan landscape, both out 
over the Bering Sea and inland over 
the tundra. The chapters consist 
largely of lengthy quotations from 
an elderly grandmother, a young

father, a mother, and a fourteen- 
year-old girl, respectively, and ail 
of their words are poetic. Some- 
times the imagery is reminiscent of 
Cape Dorset prints with their vivid 
spirit-animals and spirit-persons. 

The views of the cosmos pre- 
sented by these four speakers are 
individual, diifering from one an- 
other in the emotions and fantasies 
attached to seasons and landscapes. 
They are similar only in that intense 
emotions and fantasies are attached 
to these phenomena. The physical 
world appears to be a focus of 
Eskimo concern and, sometimes, a 
metaphor for other, human con- 
cerns: personal strengths and weak- 
nesses, the quality of life past and 
future — its sadness, joys, forebod- 
ings, hopes, and moral dilemmas. 

The trouble is that there is some- 
thing a little unreal about all this. 
The Eskimo I know (some of them, 



sometimes) may think like this (I 
don&apos;t know), but they never talk in 
this way, even in their own lan- 
guage, much less in English. Is 
Coles exceptionally skillful at elicit- 
ing flowingly articulate, free-asso- 
ciative statements? Are these ex- 
ceptionally poetic individuals? Or 
has a great deal of editing been 
done? If the last, we should be told 
and some of the quotation marks 
should be removed. Sometimes I 
recognize a point of view that 
strikes me as familiarly Eskimo — 
&quot;You cannot survive if you forget 
how to be scared,&quot; &quot;We didn&apos;t talk 
as much then as people do now,&quot; 
&quot;[My father] always squeezed [my 
shoulder] when he was afraid I was 
not paying attention, or I was too 
much asleep,&quot; &quot;There are moments 
when I am afraid of my own 
thoughts&quot; — but the phrasing is 
often un-Eskimo to my eye. In- 



deed, it is often difficult to tell 
where the quotation begins and 
ends, as the somewhat turgid qual- 
ity of Coles&apos;s own prose carries 
over and makes me wonder whose 
words are being spoken. 

Coles&apos;s interpretations of the 
underlying meanings of quotations 
and the content of unspoken 
thoughts are not always justified by 
the evidence contained in the quo- 
tations. I would like to see an Es- 
kimo review of this book. Would 
the people of the villages Coles 
visited recognize their thoughts? 
What did Coles ask that elicited 
these statements? 

There is another problem, too. I 
have said that the book is a good 
antidote for the impression that 
Eskimo are almost exclusively 
pragmatic people. However, the 
book&apos;s single-minded focus on 
emotional responses to seasons,

weather, and landscapes is, I am 
afraid, likely to give rise to the 
opposite misconception: that Es- 
kimo are preoccupied, perhaps 
even to the point of obsession, with 
these phenomena. Again I am left 
wondering about the extent of 
Coles&apos;s own influence on this pre- 
sentation. I am sure that these 
things are important to Eskimo, as 
they are to any people who live in 
touch with the land and derive their 
livelihood from it, especially a land 
that has the power to take lives, as 
the Arctic does. 

Even so, I felt somewhat over- 
whelmed by the apparent intensity, 
the driven quality, of this preoccu- 
pation with weather on the part of 
the four narrators. Is this a true 
impression or is it perhaps Coles, 
the visitor from the &quot;lower forty- 
eight,&quot; who is preoccupied with the 
physical world of the Arctic? Is 
Coles the psychoanalyst searching 
for possibly disturbing effects and 
finding what he looks for: &quot;The agi- 
tation of the summer, the curious, 
unreal, mental state that falls upon 
him and other Eskimos.&quot; At sev- 
eral points the suspicion arises that 
Coles may have chosen exception- 
ally sensitive subjects. The old lady 
who talks about &quot;the madness of 
darkness&quot; remarks, &quot;I have always 



been trouble to others because of 
my fears,&quot; and she speaks of a time 
when she &quot;went wild&quot; and people 
later told her she had &quot;gone mad.&quot; 
The young man who describes the 
disturbances he experiences in the 
light and heat of summer says that 
a priest told him that he might have 
a sickness; in the army, they &quot;did 
tests&quot; on him to see why the light 
went to his head but found nothing 
wrong. I, too, know Eskimo who 
are very intense and who fear that 
their feelings will drive them 
&quot;crazy,&quot; but Coles&apos;s book gives 
the impression that most Eskimo 
are like this, and I think that may 
be a mistake. 

Finally, fascinating as it is, the 
focus on dramatic feelings related 
to the environment distracted my 
attention from the stated purpose 
of the book: to express the views of 
the several generations of Alaskan 
Eskimos face-to-face with cultural 
transition and their various re- 
sponses to change. The transition, 
and feelings about it, are often 
visible in what the narrators say, 
but I had to search for it, and I 
found it mostly on rereading. 

Happily, the superb photographs 
by Alex Harris do much to counter- 
act the one-sided emphasis of the 
text. For one who has lived with

Wilderness and 
Multi-use lands. 
Can they live 
side by side in the 
public forest? 

At Potlatch, we recognize the need for Wilder- 
ness areas. Areas where &quot;man is a visitor who 
does not remain.&quot; It is part of our heritage that 
deserves to be protected. 

But we must also look at Wilderness areas 
for what they are — places where roads and 
motor vehicles are barred, where nearly all 
types of structures and facilities such as camp- 
sites are forbidden, and where timber harvesting 
and other commodity activities are prohibited. 

For all the romantic allure, the Wilderness 
attracts very few people , since they can only 
venture there on foot, horseback or by canoe. 

Multi-use public forestlands, on the other 
hand, serve a much broader segment of the pop- 
ulation. Here, campers, snowmobiles and out- 
board motors are allowed, improved campsites 
and timber harvesting under government regula- 
tion are permitted. 

The continuing expansion of the Wilder- 
ness through legislation, at the expense of Multi- 
use lands, threatens eventually to remove from 
America&apos;s timber resource any hope of meeting 
America&apos;s growing need for either forest prod- 
ucts or modern group recreational activities. 

Wilderness. Multi-use. Potlatch believes, 
with balance, we can have all we need of both.

Eskimo in their homes and commu- 
nities, the pictures are marvelously 
evocative. They capture not only 
landscapes and human appearances 
(there are some beautiful portraits) 
but also the range of activities and 
much of the spirit of interaction 
between family members and be- 
tween peers. Looking at them, I felt 
homesick for Inuit. I particularly 
liked the sequence shots: a family 
sitting on the floor, engaged in 
everyday activities; a man telling a 
hunting story; and although it is, 
unfortunately, a bit too dark, a 
series of a little boy playing with 
(probably) his mother&apos;s face. 

The naturalness of facial expres- 
sions is, on the whole, impressive; 
only a few seem self-conscious or 
unfair to their &quot;owners.&quot;&quot; And I 
have never seen a picture that more 
vividly captures the spirit of Es- 
kimo dancing than one of Alex 
Harris&quot;s. The cultural mix and gen- 
erational differences are clearly 
evident, in portraits as well as in 
photographs of activities (seal hunt- 
ing from a kayak, caribou hunting 
from a snowmobile) and of objects 
(walrus tusks leaning against a 
washing machine on the tundra). In 
a few cases, I wished for fuller 
labeling: What accounts for the 
unusual grave markers&apos;? What are 
the teen-agers jumping from and 
to? And why are the caribou head 
and snowshoes deposited in trees&apos;? 
But these are very minor difficul- 
ties in an outstanding series of 
pictures. 

The book ends with a much 
shorter series of photographs taken 
by Eskimo themselves from the 
1930s to 1970. Most are &quot;formal&quot;&quot; 
photographs. It is interesting to see 
what situations are defined as call- 
ing for a photograph — the killing of 
a beluga or a walrus, a graduation, 
the arrival of a plane — and also to 
see how people pose — men and 
boys on one side, women and girls 
on the other. The historical dimen- 
sion of the pictures might also have 
been of interest, but we are not 
given dates or event labels. I found 
these snapshots a little anticlimac- 
tic, perhaps because there are so 
few of them and because in some 
cases they are uninterpretable.

Celestial Events 

by Thomas D. Nicholson 



Sun and Moon The sun will be in the far southern sky, in the con- 
stellation Ophiuchus, until December 18, and then in Sagittarius until 
after mid-January. The earliest sunset of the year occurs on Decem- 
ber 8; the latest sunrise on about January 5; and the shortest day of 
the year, when the sun is at the solstice and winter begins, on Decem- 
ber 21 or 22, depending on the time zone. The earth reaches peri- 
helion, where it is nearest the sun, on January 4. 

We will have an evening moon for the first two weeks of December 
(and January), and a morning moon for the succeeding two weeks. In 
December, the moon is at first-quarter on the 6th, full on the 14th, at 
last-quarter on the 22nd, and new on the 29th. In January, first-quar- 
ter is on the 5th, full on the 13th. The moon is nearest the earth 
(perigee) on December 2 and 30, and farthest (apogee) on the 18th. 

Stars and Planets Jupiter shows up on the evening Star Map this 
month, the first planet we&apos;ve seen there in some time, even though 
it is not yet an evening star. We call a planet an &quot;evening star&quot; when 
it is above the horizon at sunset, and Jupiter doesn&apos;t rise until later. 
But by early evening, it is up in the east, between Gemini and Leo, 
and remains in the sky past dawn. Saturn is about two hours behind, 
and from midnight on appears at Jupiter&apos;s east (left). When Venus 
rises, just before dawn, there will be quite a morning sky. During 
early twilight, Venus is low in the southeast, with Mercury visible 
below it from the 20th on; Saturn and Jupiter are high in the south- 
west and west respectively. 

December 5: Mercury is at inferior conjunction, between the earth 
and the sun, and enters the morning sky. 

December 12-13: The bright star near the moon is Aldebaran, in 
Taurus. The moon covers Aldebaran (an occultation) shortly before 
moonset along the Pacific coast. 

December 13-14: The Geminid meteor shower reaches maximum 
after midnight, providing up to 50 shower meteors per hour, about 
half as many as in the morning. 

December 14: Venus is at greatest brilliancy in the morning sky. 

December 15: Mercury ends its retrograde (westerly) movement 
and begins to move eastward through the stars. 

December 17-18: The bright object near the moon is Jupiter. 

December 20-21: Saturn is near the moon; Jupiter is the bright 
object west (right) of them. 

December 21-22: Winter commences in the Northern Hemisphere 
at 21 minutes past midnight, EST, on the 22nd; late on the 21st in time 
zones to the west. 

December 22-23: The Ursid meteor shower can be seen at its best 
(up to 15 meteors per hour) after midnight. 

December 24: Mercury is at its greatest distance from the sun in the 
morning sky. It may be visible low in the southeast shortly after 
dawn, below and to the left of Venus, for several mornings before and 
after this date. 

December 26: Venus can be seen at dawn in western North Amer- 
ica just under the lower tip of the crescent moon. 

December 30: Perigee follows the new moon by one day. The effect 
of the moon&apos;s distance will enhance the normally greater range of 
spring tides. 

•*: Hold the Star Map so the compass direction you face is at the bottom; 
then match the stars in the lower half of the map with those in the sky near the 
horizon. The map is for 11:15 p.m. on December 1; 10:20 p.m. on Decem- 
ber 15; 9:20 P.M. on December 31; and 8:20 p.m. on January 15; but it can also 
be used for an hour before and after those times.

Mission to Venus 



Space probes bound for our 
planetary neighbor should 
increase our understanding 
of Earth as well 

Early in December 1978 two 
United States spacecraft, called 
Pioneers, will approach Venus. On 
December 4 (assuming all goes 
according to plan) one spacecraft, 
Pioneer Venus I. will go into an 
elliptical orbit of the planet with a 
closest approach of 125 miles or 
less from its surface. On December 
9 the second spacecraft, Pioneer 
Venus 2, a multiprobe craft, will 
release five different instrument 
packages that will make observa- 
tions as they descend into the Ve- 
nusian atmosphere. Four of the 
probes should reach the planet&apos;s 
surface and may survive there for a 
short time. Since the temperature 
of Venus&apos; s atmosphere at the sur- 
face is about 900°F, hotter than the 
melting point of lead, it is an engi- 
neering feat to reach the planet&apos;s 
surface, let alone to survive there. 
Long term in situ measurements on 
the surface of Venus are something 
for the distant future. 

Venus is a particularly diificult 
planet to explore. Its high surface 
temperature is one problem, but 
equally important is its ubiquitous, 
opaque cloud cover, which pre- 
cludes most of the remote satellite 
measurements that have been suc- 
cessfully made of Earth and Mars. 
The United States has already sent 
three flyby spacecraft to Venus — 
Mariner 2, Mariner 5, and Mariner 
10 — which have given us partial but 
tantalizingly incomplete informa- 
tion. The Soviet Union has made 
Venus a prime target for its space 
program, launching at least ten 
Venera spacecraft, two of which 
operated on the surface for about 
sixty minutes and sent back televi- 
sion images of the few yards sur- 
rounding the spacecraft. 

Approximately ten years ago a 
small group of U.S. scientists suc- 



cessfully argued that a major effort 
should be made to advance our 
knowledge of Venus, our nearest 
planetary neighbor. The tenor of 
their argument was that an under- 
standing of the similarities and 
differences between Earth and 
Venus would increase our knowl- 
edge of both planets, that a few 
successful measurements could 
shed much light on questions about 
Venus, and that those measure- 
ments were all within the scope of 
modern technology. It was further 
pointed out that experiments on 
the orbiter and probes could be so 
designed as to support each other 
and thereby provide complemen- 
tary clues to some of the more 



significant questions about Venus. 

The resultant Pioneer mission, 
formulated by 114 investigators of 
diverse interests from Europe and 
the United States, is a model of a 
well-designed scientific investiga- 
tion. I shall attempt to describe a 
few of the major questions that con- 
cern the researchers, what they 
expect to learn, and why this 
knowledge may benefit all of us. 

An understanding of the struc- 
ture and evolution of the interior of 
the earth is a central problem ad- 
dressed by geophysicists. They 
wish to ascertain, for example, how 
and why our planet has differen- 
tiated, that is, why heavier mate- 
rial, principally iron, has gravitated

to the earth&apos;s center; whether the 
core is molten; how it gives rise to 
the planetary magnetic field; and 
how far the earth has progressed 
along the evolutionary track toward 
the end when all forms of internal 
energy will have been dissipated. 
The clues available on Earth alone 
are few and unraveling them is a 
slow and painstaking process. Sim- 
ilarities and diiferences in closely 
related planetary bodies such as 
Venus could open up entirely new 
ideas.

of the surface. We know from 
ground-based studies made by 
radar, which can penetrate clouds, 
that large local and continental- 
sized height contrasts exist. This 
leads us to conclusions about the 
strength of the interior rocks. We 
can also calculate internal mass 
distributions and hence decide 
whether the observed rotation of 
Venus can be accounted for in 
terms of gravitational interactions 
between Venus and Earth. 

This last question is sufficiently 
interesting for a brief digression. 
Earth-based radar studies have 
established that Venus rotates un- 
expectedly slowly — once in about 
243 days — and in a retrograde 
sense, that is, in a direction oppo- 
site to almost all other solar system 
bodies and orbits. The slow rate of 
rotation may have a curious conse- 
quence, namely, that whenever 
Earth and Venus are closest (in 
conjunction, in astronomical lan- 
guage) the same feature on the 
Venus surface appears to face the 
earth directly. It is not difficult to 
see that periodic gravitational im- 
pulses, such as might result from a 
large, raised continent placed at 
this point on Venus, could tend to 
lock the orbits together in the man- 
ner observed. To establish this 
mechanism in detail requires 
knowledge of the physical prop- 
erties and mass distribution in the 
interior of Venus, and if our models 
can be shown to be consistent with 
the planet&apos;s anomalous rotation, 
our confidence in them is increased. 

The orbiter can also measure the 
Venusian magnetic field. We know 
from the USSR Venera measure- 
ments that the magnetic field is 
small — approximately one thou- 
sand times smaller than the earth&apos;s. 
Does this imply that Venus does 
not have a molten metallic core? Or 
is some other feature of the plane- 
tary dynamo missing or weak? A 
careful survey of the magnetic field 
may clarify these issues. 

If the planet has a metallic core, 
it is, of course, differentiated, for if 
we understand anything at all about 
the formation of the planets in our 
solar system, Venus could not have 
started off that way. Another ap- 
proach to the interior structure of 
Venus is to examine the planet&apos;s 
surface to see whether its physical 
state or chemical composition im- 
plies interior processes. For exam- 
ple, basaltic flows, which are com- 



mon on the earth, moon, and Mars, 
imply volcanism, which, in turn, 
implies massive reorganization of 
the object&apos;s interior. The presence 
of igneous rocks, such as granites, 
has a similar implication. Venera 
spacecraft have turned up both 
kinds of evidence. Radio-chemical 
analysis of the surface has indi- 
cated igneous, possibly granitic, 
rocks at one location. Television 
pictures of the surface have sug- 
gested debris of a basaltic origin at 
another. 

Pioneer Venus 2 is equipped with 
an elaborate chemical laboratory 
that will be carried to the surface in 
the largest of the multiprobes. Sam- 
ples of the atmosphere rather than 
the surface itself will be analyzed, 
but that is not an important distinc- 
tion because the high surface tem- 
perature and surface pressure 
(approximately ninety times that of 
the earth) insure an intimate chemi- 
cal relationship between surface 
and atmosphere. We may therefore 
regard the atmosphere as an acces- 
sible extension of the surface. 

These carefully designed chemi- 
cal experiments are central to the 
Venus mission. They will not only 
tell us a great deal about the sur- 
face but they are also important to 
our understanding of atmospheric 
processes, particularly the layer or 
layers of cloud that shroud the 
planet. Such chemical data are also 
essential for constructing the past 
history of the Venusian atmos- 
phere, and this could help us under- 
stand the past history of the earth&apos;s 
atmosphere, which connects with 
ideas about future terrestrial evolu- 
tion and change. 

The radio altimeter, already re- 
ferred to, will supply surface maps 
of the planet that may carry signifi- 
cant information about the crust 
and interior. Radio waves can 
penetrate the cloud cover and de- 
lineate the surface in a way that is 
impossible for the eye or a televi- 
sion camera. Interestingly, the 
maps obtained will not provide 
more detail than that available from 
ground-based radiotelescopes. The 
large antennas that now exist, espe- 
cially if used in combination with 
each other, have already given us 
partial maps showing mountains, 
craters, and other features. The 
earth-based observations cover 
only a small fraction of Venus&apos;s 
surface, however, and the orbiter 
will greatly extend this coverage.

The maps obtained will be stud- 
ied for information on dynamical 
processes in the crust. Are huge 
plates constantly being created and 
destroyed, as on the earth, or is the 
crust thick and unbroken, as on the 
moon and Mars? Can we detect 
relatively young volcanoes and do 
basaltic flows exist, indicating the 
possibility of earlier volcanism? 

Turning to the atmosphere, the 
situation on Venus is quite differ- 
ent from that on Earth, yet we be- 
lieve that the evolution of the pres- 
ent Venusian atmosphere and the 
physical processes that govern its 
behavior are related to similar proc- 
esses on the earth. 

The cloud cover on Venus is one 
of the prime targets for investiga- 
tion. We not only have to confirm 
our theories about its composition 
and find out why, unlike that of the 
earth, it is horizontally complete 
and unbroken, although vertically 
layered, but we must also learn 
how it influences other phenomena 
such as surface temperature and 
global wind systems. 

Our present state of knowledge 
about Venus&apos; s clouds is as follows. 
Between forty-five and fifty-five 
miles above the planet&apos;s surface 
there are some thin and relatively 
unimportant cloud layers. The bulk 
of the cloud lies twenty to forty 
miles above the surface and con- 
sists, we believe, principally of 
small drops of sulfuric acid. Be- 
low that there may be a relatively 
cloudless layer. The cloud is 
formed not by the familiar conden- 
sation process responsible for most 
terrestrial clouds but rather by a 
series of chemical reactions more 
similar to those in an urban smog. 

The four Pioneer Venus 2 probes 
(one large and three small) designed 
to reach the surface can make a 
variety of measurements, all re- 
lated to the cloud layer. A small 
cloud detector will indicate the 
presence of cloud and measure its 
opacity. On the large probe an 
instrument will measure the con- 
centration and size of cloud par- 
ticles, essential parameters for 
understanding the processes de- 
stroying the cloud. (The atmos- 
phere is dynamical, not static. And 
because nature must preserve a 
balance, clouds are formed and de- 
stroyed at the same rate. Cloud 
formation must therefore be accom- 
panied either by dissipation by 
chemical processes or by precipita-

tion to the hot lower atmosphere.) 
The chemical measurements, al- 
ready mentioned, are designed to 
determine conclusively the chemi- 
cal composition of any observed 
cloud layer. 

Finally, two sets of instruments 
will not only provide data on the 
cloud but also measure the cloud&apos;s 
influence on incoming solar radia- 
tion and the outgoing long-wave 
heat radiation that cools the planet 
and maintains it in a balanced state. 
Both radiation streams will be 
measured independently or in com- 
bination on all four of the deep 
atmospheric probes. 

One of the most important fea- 
tures of these radiation experi- 
ments is the possibility they offer 
of insight into why the surface tem- 
perature is so high. An elementary 
calculation suggests that Venus&apos;s 
clouds reflect so much sunlight that 
the surface should be, on the aver- 
age, well below the freezing point 
of water. Apparently the cloud has 
a more complex function. It per- 
mits a few percent of the incident 
sunlight to reach the surface while 
at the same time it is extremely 
opaque to penetration by long- 
wave radiation. Heat is thereby 
trapped near the surface and the 
temperature rises to unexpected 
values. 

We may understand this problem 
in its general outline but that is not 
sufficient, for if Venus can behave 
in this way, so might the earth. We 
must be very clear about those fac- 
tors that have led the two planets 
into such dramatically different 
states. 

The second central problem con- 
cerning the lower atmosphere is 
that of the global wind system. The 
physical laws of motion challenge 
our general state of knowledge as 
to how atmospheres function, and 
the slow rotation of Venus should 
give rise to motions with some sim- 
ilarity to those occurring in the 
tropical regions of the earth. Mod- 
ern meteorology places increasing 
importance upon these tropical 
flows and their influence on the 
entire planet. 

The predominant flow of the 
lower atmosphere on Venus prob- 
ably carries heat directly from the 
tropics to the poles by means of 
two huge cells that rise in low lati- 
tudes and sink in high latitudes. 
The driving force for this circula- 
tion is the difference in heating and

cooling caused by absorbed solar 
radiation and radiation emitted by 
the planet over distances of global 
dimensions. To understand the cir- 
culation we have to measure the 
diflFerence, which was one of the 
primary motivations for the mul- 
tiple-probe concept. Four probes 
will measure the temperature, pres- 
sure, and heat balance of the atmos- 
phere, in addition to the presence 
of cloud at four points as widely 
spaced as the mechanics of the 
mission permit. One possible con- 
figuration places two probes at 
30°S, one at the equator, and one at 
56°N, with a maximum longitudinal 
spread of 100°. 

At each of these four locations 
we expect to measure the winds 
with an accuracy of about one mile 
per hour at twenty to thirty differ- 
ent heights in the atmosphere. This 
will be done by an ingenious system 
in which radiotelescopes on the 
earth will track the probes. The 
idea may be diificult to grasp, but 
the probes at Venus — some 33 mil- 
lion miles away — will be located, 
relative to each other, from Earth 
to a precision of a yard or two. 

That the atmospheric motions of 
Venus are not simple is already 
known. The picture we have de- 
veloped for the lower atmosphere 
does not pertain to the cloud tops. 
There a strong wind blows in a pre- 
dominantly east-west direction at 
speeds up to 250 mph. These winds 
can be seen in pictures whose reso- 
lution is great enough to detect 
small moving clouds, and measure- 
ments of this type will be made 
from the orbiter. Why one wind 
regime gives way to another so dif- 
ferent is a puzzle that remains to 
be explained. 

To conclude, let us follow the 
sequence of events expected to 
occur early in December. The or- 
biter, which will arrive first, em- 
bodies a relatively familiar concept 
— we have put many similar space- 
craft into orbit around the moon, 
the earth, and Mars. This one will 
transmit data to the earth for at 
least eight months. The multiprobe 
is more unusual. 

The four probes designed to 
reach the surface of Venus, to- 
gether with their heat shields, are 
attached to one side of a carrier 
spacecraft. Twenty-four days be- 
fore entry into the Venusian atmos- 
phere, the single large probe will 
be released and will follow a ballis-

&quot;David Rains Wallace has 
spent five years with his flash-

insight. ..To our delight he has 
taken us into the dark range of 
animals&apos; lives, and his pen has 
been dipped in the black magic 
of nocturnal happenings.&quot;

tic trajectory into the atmosphere. 
The spacecraft will then be spun 
slowly on its axis so that when the 
small probes are released, four 
days later, centrifugal force will 
carry them on slightly different tra- 
jectories from each other and from 
the large probe. 

This leaves the carrier, to which 
the probes were attached. It also is 
instrumented but has no heat 
shield. After the small probes have 
been released, the carrier will be 
retargeted and will burn up like a 
meteor in the upper Venusian at- 
mosphere but not before it has 
made important measurements in 
that region. 

The probes with heat shields will 
continue their journey. At sixty 
miles above the surface the decel- 
erating effect of the atmosphere 
will be felt, and at fifty miles the 
maximum deceleration will take 
place. 

Inside the probes, sealed pressure 
vessels made of titanium with some 
insulation will protect the instru- 
ments from the heat of the lower 
atmosphere. One of the most chal- 
lenging engineering tasks of the 
mission was to construct these ves- 
sels from a difficult-to-handle 
material, make them pressure tight 
and thermally insulated, and yet to 
provide windows and access ports 
for the instruments to sample the 
exterior atmosphere. 

The probes will take almost 
sixty minutes to fall from about 
forty-two miles, where measure- 
ments begin, to the ground. If that 
sounds slow, the reader should 
realize that the dense lower atmos- 
phere of Venus is more akin in 
some ways to the earth&apos;s oceans 
than to its atmosphere. The large 
probe will fall somewhat faster than 
the small probes and, to compen- 
sate, will carry a parachute to be 
used during the first seventeen 
minutes of descent. 

The multiprobe mission, after ten 
years of preparation, will last only 
sixty minutes, plus the very short 
time that the probes can be ex- 
pected to survive on the surface of 
Venus. That single hour, however, 
should revolutionize our views of 
the surface and lower atmosphere 
of the planet most similar to our 
own.

Since 1972, when we started our 
tours, cruises and expeditions for ad- 
venturous travelers, many people 
have asked us for a safari in East 
Africa: we did not wish to compete 
with others in this field and waited 
until we could offer a program which 
is unique and has been carefully sur- 
veyed to provide the outdoor living 
that inspired Hemingway&apos;s novels— 
the true way to appreciate Africa, its 
people, and its wildlife. 

We now invite twelve intrepid travel- 
ers to see Africa as did the explorers 
before the tourists came, on our 

African 
Camel Safari

A journey on foot with camel support 
across the fiercely exciting Northern 
Frontier District of Kenya, accom-

Few travelers, so far, have experi- 
enced the peace, serenity and enjoy- 
ment of walking through the African 
bush with the muffled sound of camel 
bells.

Atlantic Salmon (p. 38) 

A complete bibliography on the 
Atlantic salmon was published in 
1962 by the Department of Game 
and Fisheries, Province of Quebec, 
Quebec, Canada: Bibliogniphie dii 
saumon de I&apos; Atlantic/tie, by Julien 
Bergeron. Two more up-to-date 
books on the subject are by An- 
thony Netboy. The first is The 
Atlantic Salmon: A Vanishing Spe- 
cies? (Boston: Houghton Mifflin 
Co., 1968). This study of the history 
of Atlantic Salmon, with seven- 
teen pages of references, is the re- 
sult of extensive field and library 
research in Europe and the United 
States. The second. The Salmon: 
Their Fight for Survival (Boston: 
Houghton Mifflin Co., 1974), has 
an interesting discussion on primi- 
tive man and the Atlantic salmon. 

Hawaiian Ttee Snails (p. 46) 

Most publications about Hawai- 
ian tree snails are highly technical, 
outdated, or out of print. A general 
introduction to the snails&apos; environ- 
ment is Hawaii: A Natural History, 
by Sherwin Carlquist (Garden City: 
Doubleday/Natural History Press, 
1970). Mollusks, by Paul Bartsch 
(New York: Dover Publications, 
1968), includes pictures of Hawaiian 
tree snails and mentions them briefly 
in the text. The Shell Makers: Intro- 
ducing Mollusks, by Alan Solem 
(New York: John Wiley and Sons, 
1974), deals with marine and land 
mollusks. 

Neanderthals (p. 58) 

Two paperback introductions to 
the subject are Evolution of the 
Genus Homo, by W. W. Howells 
(Reading: Addison-Wesley Publish- 
ing Co., 1973), and Neanderthal 
Man, by Kenneth A. R. Kennedy 
(Minneapolis: Burgess Publishing 
Co., 1975). Shanidar: The First 
Flower People, by R. S. Solecki 
(New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1971), 
is an illustrated, personal account of 

100 



the excavations at Shanidar Cave. 
Although out of print, it can be found 
in some libraries. A well-known, ex- 
cellent introduction is John Pfeif- 
fer&apos;s Emergence of Man, now in 
second edition (New York: Harper 
and Row, Publishers, 1972). The 
author has also written The Search 
for Early Man (New York: Ameri- 
can Heritage Publishing Co., 1963) 
for young adults. It is illustrated 
with paintings and pictures of pre- 
historic engravings and sculptures 
from the Lascaux caves. Two books 
published by Time-Life Books, 
New York, are Early Man, by F. 
Clark Howell, rev. ed. (Life Nature 
Library Series, 1973), for grades 5 
and up, and The Neanderthals, by 



George Constable (Emergence of 
Man Series, 1973). 

Monthly Rhythms (p. 64) 

Information on several interna- 
tional conferences on biological 
timing, held from 1960 to 1973, can 
be found in the preface of Living 
Clocks in the Animal World, by 
Miriam F. Bennett (Springfield: 
Charles C. Thomas Publisher, 
1974). The book discusses biological 
clocks of fiddler and other crabs, 
honeybees , earthworms, and certain 
mollusks and amphibians. For read- 
ers who have no special background 
in science, there is the illustrated 
Rhythm Phenomena in Plants, by 
B. M. Sweeney (New York: Aca- 




Cellular Slime Mold Spore Towers (27X) 



David Scharf

demic Press, 1969), which also 
draws on animal studies. The yearly 
emergence of the palolo worm in 
Samoa is discussed in &quot;Night of the 
Palolo,&quot; by Barbara Smetzer (Nat- 
ural Histoiy, November 1969). The 
Physiological Clock, by Erwin 
Running, 3rd ed. (New York: 
Springer- Verlag New York), is a 
heavily illustrated, technical book. 
In addition to his articles in Natural 
History (see &quot;Authors,&quot; page 4), 
John D. Palmer has written a num- 
ber of books, including An Intro- 
duction to Biological Rhythms 
(New York: Academic Press, 1976) 
and Biological Clocks in Marine 
Organisms (New York: John Wiley 
and Sons, 1974.) His article on 
&quot;Biological Clocks of the Tidal 
Zone,&quot; appeared in the February 
1975 issue oi Scientific American. 

Slime Molds (p. 70) 

Chapter 7 of Eloquent Animals: 
A Study in Animal Communication, 
by Flora Davis (New York: Coward, 
McCann and Geoghegan, 1978), dis- 
cusses slime molds and John T. 
Bonner&apos;s work at Princeton. Bon- 
ner&apos;s classic monograph is The 
Cellular Slime Moulds, 2nd ed. 
(Princeton: Princeton University 
Press, 1969). More up to date is 
Dictyostelium discoideum: A De- 
velopmental System, by William F. 
Loomis (New York: Academic 
Press, 1975), with photographs of 
slime molds in various stages. De- 
velopment and Differentiation in 
the Cellular Slime Moulds, edited 
by P. Cappuccinelli and J. M. Ash- 
worth (New York: Elsevier/North 
Holland Biomedical Press, 1977), 
is the proceedings of the 1977 inter- 
national conference on cellular 
slime molds. The work is illustrated 
with graphs and photographs. Chap- 
ter 3 of The Mycetozoans, by 
Lindsay S. Olive (New York: Aca- 
demic Press, 1975), treats the sub- 
ject of slime molds.

At the Museum 



Two signs, classic as Advent 
calendars, herald the approach of 
Christmas for Museum visitors. 
One is the Star of Wonder show at 
the Hayden Planetarium, which be- 
gins on November 22. As essential a 
part of a New York schoolchild&apos;s 
holiday as The Nutcracker Suite, 
the Planetarium show re-creates the 
sky over Bethlehem at the time of 
Christ&apos;s birth and summarizes 
theories of the star&apos;s origin, for 
which science now oflfers as many 
hypotheses as science fiction does. 

The year 1978 will be the sixth 
year of the Museum&apos;s other Christ- 
mas classic, the Rotunda Origami 
Ttee. This year&apos;s tree, wider than 
before, will boast a larger star mo- 
bile and a veritable Noah&apos;s ark of 
more than 1,500 glistening foil birds 
and other animals, plants, crystals, 
and stars, as well as angels and 
creche figures under the lowest 
branches. The tree&apos;s impresario is 
Alice Gray, scientific assistant in 
the Museum&apos;s Department of En- 
tomology, who first picked up an 
origami book fifteen years ago be- 
cause it pictured an insect on the 
cover. Starting in September, with 
help from the New York Origami 
Society, Gray teaches Museum vol- 
unteers, and employees on their 
lunch hour, to make dinosaurs, 
whales, skunks, tigers, flying geese, 
vultures, and even pelicans from 
gift wrap. &quot;The pelican is compli- 
cated; he&apos;s an advanced lesson,&quot; 
explained Gray, reciting, &quot;A won- 
derful bird is the pelican/His bill 
will hold more than his belican.&quot; 

During December, Museum vol- 
unteers will demonstrate origami 
techniques around the tree on an ad 
hoc schedule. The 150 different de- 
signs on the tree come from 
America, Japan, and England. Al- 
though no one knows exactly where 
origami began. Gray speculates that 
this &quot;fugitive craft&quot; traveled, along 
with the paper, from China to Japan 
in the eleventh century. Indeed, 
Japan Airlines has asked the 
Origami Center of America, of 
which Miss Gray is an Associate, to 
decorate a tree for their window at 
Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street. 

One passer-by who won&apos;t be at- 
tracted by a tree decorated with 



man-made objects is paleontologist 
Sidney Horenstein of the Museum&apos;s 
Department of Invertebrates. 
Shortly before Christmas, Horen- 
stein will lead one of his Urban Fossil 
Hunts down Fifth Avenue, looking 
for fossils in building stones. 

Horenstein, whose three great 
loves are &quot;maps, fossils, and New 
York City,&quot; combines them regu- 
larly by leading fossil hunts through 
such unexplored frontiers as the 
canyons of lower Manhattan&apos;s fi- 
nancial district, the boathouse in 
Central Park, and the tombstones 
and mausoleums of Woodlawn 
Cemetery in the Bronx. (For sched- 
ules, write to him care of the Ameri- 
can Museum of Natural History.) 
These unusual field trips grew out 
of his conviction that since man is 
natural, the city is simply another 
aspect of natural history. Horen- 
stein&apos;s studies of urban geology and 
paleontology include compiling a 
catalog of the Museum&apos;s building 
stones: the materials used; where 
the stones and the fossils they con- 
tain came from; how they arrived at 
the building site; how they have 
changed since construction. Re- 
cently, we followed Horenstein 
around the Museum to hear some of 
its stones&apos; stories. 

In order to interpret building 
stones and date their fossils, Horen- 
stein has learned to climb around 
quarries, read architectural plans 
and specifications, and translate 
construction-trade jargon. He has 
consulted the Museum&apos;s original 
plans but finds they are frequently 
misleading: &quot;For all sorts of rea- 
sons, the stones were often changed 
at the last minute.&quot; Nevertheless, 
many parts of the Museum could 
not be replaced today. For exam- 
ple, the beautiful Verd Antique 
marble from Vermont, lavished as 
veneer on the Hall of African Mam- 
mals, now costs $32 per square foot. 

As we began our tour at the 77th 
Street entrance, near the oldest sec- 
tion of the Museum, Horenstein 
told us that the building&apos;s most 
ancient stone, a granite from Min- 
nesota in the Auditorium&apos;s outer 
wall, is more than a staggering two 
billion years old. 

Inside, in the Hall of Northwest 



Coast Indians on the first floor, 
Horenstein pointed out some 
wiggly lines in the Tennessee mar- 
ble at the base of a headdress case 
on the right: &quot;These are fragments 
of fossils that altered as the rock 
recrystallized.&quot; 

Passing out of the second floor&apos;s 
Hall of African Mammals into the 
corridor to the Rotunda, Horen- 
stein found fossil sponges in the 
Rouge Fleuri marble from Knox- 
ville, Tennessee, on the right-hand 
wall. The stairs from this corridor to 
the third floor are made of Italian 
travertine, probably cut from the 
same quarry as the blocks used in 
Rome&apos;s Coliseum. Low, plantlike 
growths on the stone once filled the 
shallow, irregular holes in the steps. 

As we rounded the corner and 
entered the Rotunda, Horenstein 
pointed out the right-hand wall of 
&quot;Renfrew marble, actually a lime- 
stone from Ashburton, England.&quot; 
This wall is covered with gray 
splotches that are brachiopods and 
fossil sponges — &quot;not a coral reef, 
but a sponge reef.&quot; On the left, 
toward the Hall of Oceanic Birds, 
the Saint Florient Cream marble 
wall dates from the Cretaceous and 
contains &quot;very unusual fossils. This 
wall is part of a rudistan reef, a reef 
of clams that died with the di- 
nosaurs.&quot; At the north end of the 
Rotunda, the Sainte Genevieve 
Golden Vein marble at the entrance 
to the Hall of Oceanic Birds is 
actually limestone from Missouri, 
350 million years old, made up of 
solid fossil coral, whose circular 
shapes and radial spokes are plainly 
visible. Concluding his tour, 
Horenstein reminded us that many 
of the trees around the Museum are 
gingkoes, living fossils that have 
survived without evolving. 

A good Sunday to look for the 
Museum&apos;s living and petrified fos- 
sils would be March 18, when the 
New York Paleontological Society, 
which Horenstein founded, will 
hold a special program, &quot;Fossils 
for Kids,&quot; at 2:00 p.m. in Education 
Hall. Children can scrutinize the 
Museum&apos;s building stones, see a 
slide show on how fossils form, and 
play &quot;Dinosaur Bingo.&quot;
