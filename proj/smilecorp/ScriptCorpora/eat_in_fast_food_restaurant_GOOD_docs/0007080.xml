Even if in summer its yield also reaches over 90%. The machine is very easy and convenient to operate and control. It also has many special characteristics such as automatic start or stop, protection of water shortage, troubleshooting, automatically stop when ice full.

 

Food-grade cube ice machine is the first type of cube ice thickness, self- adaptation for ambient temperature and balance between automatic ice forming and waetr supply ,which have completely solved the problem of vary ice thickness when making ice in different ambient temperature, By reasonabley applying two technologies, flat -plate heat exchange technology&amp;circulating heat gas for ice forming technology, we break through solved such problems of food-grade cube ice machine ,low production ,high power consumption and unstable ice dropping etc, which have offered important technology guarantee for our product to enterinto the international market.

  

Cube ice is widely adopt in hotel , bars, banqueting hall, western restaurant, fast food restaurant, CVS(convenience store)cold drink shop.

1.Reasonable design for the structure ,save space, easy to install

4.Special ice outlet , ice outgoing automatically, no need taking ice by hand and ensure the ice clean and sanitary.

 

 The advantage of our ice cube machine : 

1.Large production :its production can reach 90%-95%in summer , when the ambient temperature is lower than 23°C,  compared with other small type ice cube machine (150kw/h 165kw/h per ton)its production can reach 100% -130%.

2.Low power consumption :its consumption is 85kw.h -90kw.h per ton is summer , when the ambient temperature is lower than 23°C,compared with other small type ice cube machine (150kw/h 165kw/h per ton) its power consumption is only 70-85 kw.h per ton.

3.Easy operation :adopt PLC program centralized control , self- adjustment for ice thickness, self- adaptation for ambient temperature and balance between automatic ice forming and water supply, manual operation is not required.

4.Optional equipment : equipped with automatic ice spreading system and special ice packing system for the machine , it can not only reduce manpower, but also can ensure the food security, meet food standard and improve its competitive advantage.

Compect structure: integrated design is adopted for making machinery unit , occupying small space ice cube machine for produce food grade ice ,cube ice is edible ice.
