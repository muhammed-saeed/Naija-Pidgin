 Flag Close Post a comment Ryan&apos;s of Oak Ridge, Tennessee is one of the last remaining buffet steakhouses in the area. They are a family oriented restaurant that is known for good food and friendly employees.
On the day we visited, Hubby and I were making the mad dash between meetings. We needed something to eat, fast. Since food on a buffet is already fixed we decided to dash in for a late lunch. We were glad that we did.

At this Ryan&apos;s, when you walk in you step over to the counter to get your drink, tableware and to place your order. This is different from some of the newer Ryan&apos;s Steakhouses where you are immediately greeted by cashiers, seated and then your drinks are brought to you.

It only took us a few minutes to go through the line. Most of this was time was spent waiting for the couple to decide what they wanted to drink and then decide which one was going to pay. Through it all the cashier was courteous and friendly.

Hubby and I ordered two Mega Bars and two unsweetened iced teas. Our request was straightforward and simple. The cashier easily totaled our order and counted back correct change. The total came to $19.27 for the both of us.

We selected a table and laid our cashier&apos;s slip on it to hold it. Our quick server was there before we finished taking the plates and drinks off of the tray. She took the empty tray and asked if we wanted rolls. These were on the table with more clean plates before we got back from getting our food.

At Ryan&apos;s Grill Buffet and Bakery the food tables are divided into sections. On two tables are the hot items. You&apos;ll usually find baked chicken, fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, spaghetti, baked fish, and an assortment of vegetables. A full menu can be found on the website here. 

In another section you will find Ryan&apos;s salad and fruit bar. This usually has two kinds of lettuce, assorted vegetables, cantaloupe and other fruit. Additionally, there is usually tuna salad and potato or macaroni salad.

Deserts are on another bar. These include cakes, cookies, ice cream and even sugar free items.

On the day we visited, the server kept our iced tea glasses filled. Sue chatted with us and checked back often. Plates were cleared as needed. We were pleased with the job she did.

Ryan&apos;s Grill Buffet and Bakery is easy to get into to. It&apos;s just off the main road that goes through Oak Ridge. The parking lot is large. Navigation is easy. Outside, the restaurant was free of debris. The doors and entryway were clean.

We observed management checking the internal temperature of food items on the buffet. Staff stirred and rotated the pans.

I got the baked chicken and some kind of chicken casserole. Both were very good. The vegetables were also hot and tasty. Hubby said he was pleased with his meal. I especially appreciated that not all of the meal choices were high in fat and calories. There were many healthy choices both on the hot bar and on the salad bar.

The Tennessee Dept. of Health gave them an 85 on their last inspection. 
The health department considers anything below a 70 to be unsanitary.

We were pleased with the food quality and speed with which we were able to dine at Ryan&apos;s Family Steakhouse. Hubby and I were in and out in just under 30 minutes. The speed rivals my last visit to a fast food restaurant. But, that&apos;s a different review for another day.

Sounds like a great place to eat.

Glad to hear there are still some good &quot;Ryan&apos;s&quot; left. It used to be one of my favorite places, but the one here has changed ownership and is not so great anymore...
