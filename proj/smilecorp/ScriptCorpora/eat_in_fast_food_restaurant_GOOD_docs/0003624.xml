 In-N-Out Burger to open restaurants in Texas

—————
 The rumors have been flying around cyberspace for months about the possibility of In-N-Out Burger expanding its empire to Texas.

On Wednesday, I finally got confirmation that Southern California’s most beloved burger chain is seeking approval to open fast-food units in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area.

“Yes, we are working on a few locations in the Dallas/Ft. Worth market and Garland is one of them,”In-N-Out executive Carl Van Fleet said, referring to a city near Dallas.“While we are very enthusiastic about the opportunities there, our Dallas area plans are still in the early stages.”

Expansion to the Lone Star state has huge operational implications for the iconic burger chain, whose 240 locations in four states are supported by one beef processing plant in Baldwin Park. In previous interviews with the Register, In-N-Out has maintained that the key to its success is quality control.

At the meat commissary in Baldwi n Park, butchers mix a proprietary blend of ground beef from local suppliers. That“secret”blend of fresh, not frozen, meat is sent to each restaurant every other day. ( GRAPHIC: See how In-N-Out processes its burgers )

In 2006, In-N-Out told the Register it would not consider spreading stores beyond 500 miles of its commissary because it would require the chain to open a second hub or have longer cycles between delivery runs, all of which would reduce quality control.

“It’s not even negotiable,”the chain told the Register.

Van Fleet, vice president of planning and development at In-N-Out, said the 1,500-mile move to Texas will force the chain to build a“new patty production facility and distribution center.”

“It is far enough away that we will have to open a new one there as we remain committed to making our own hamburger patties and maintaining the same operating philosophies and standards that have been in place for 62 years,”he said.“We’ll have a Dallas area facility to produce patties locally and provide support for our restaurants there.”

Van Fleet said the new facility would support at least a“few”restaurant sites in Texas. He declined to say exactly how many restaurants the chain could open in the region.  The first Texas restaurant is slated to open in Firewheel Town Center in Garland, Texas, according to Dallas food blog SideDish . The city is about 15 miles from Dallas.

It’s too soon to discuss an opening date for the restaurant, Van Fleet said.

In the meantime, burger fans are thrilled at the thought of In-N-Out’s arrival, says S ideDish blogger Nancy Nichols , a veteran restaurant industry reporter in the region.

“The blog post I put up breaking the news that In-N-Out Burger was coming to Dallas basically shut down our entire server because of the traffic,”she said.“This city has been jonsing for an In-N-Out as long as I’ve been covering the food business here in Dallas and that is almost 14 years. Dallas is a burger crazy town full of transplanted Californians.”
 
 5:30 p.m. update: Will Texans see In-N-Out expanding to other big cities like San Antonio? No, says Van Fleet:“We really aren’t considering anything outside the Dallas/Ft. Worth market at this time.  That market is plenty big and we don’t plan to change our rate of growth.”
