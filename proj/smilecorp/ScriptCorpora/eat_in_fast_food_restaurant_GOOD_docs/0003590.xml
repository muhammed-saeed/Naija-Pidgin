Digital Display Signage for Your Business

Digital display signage is the use of digital screens, billboards, kiosks, and other displays to present the signs of businesses and organizations. Digital sign displays are available in a number of different digital technologies, from liquid crystal display (LCD) to light emitting diodes (LED), high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps and cathode ray tubes (CRT). The advantages of digital sign displays are many. From illuminant, crystal-clear displays to easy content changeovers, this technology is quickly becoming the standard for how businesses deploy their advertising, brand their company to customers and clients, and communicate with their employees.

 Digital Sign Displays: No Project Too Big or Too Small 


It&apos;s easy to imagine the menu boards of fast food restaurants, the window signs of downtown street shops, or the running ticker of headline news and stock values displayed on a digital sign display, but there are a dozen more applications for digital display signage. From sprawling digital billboards to screen savers for computer labs, business conferences, and work computers, these screens can and do come in all shapes and sizes. Digital kiosks are single-handedly revolutionizing the way people buy tickets for movies, shop in large malls or retail stores, and decide what type of public transportation to use to get across town. Businesses and organizations must decide what type and size of digital sign displays to deploy, both at their business and off-site for advertising.

More and more, advertising venues are designing ways to combine large and small scale digital display signage. Digital billboard developers, for example, are exploring ways to use Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth technology to transmit digital content to drivers&apos; smart phones as they pass by on the highway. No longer will drivers need to cock their heads and strain their eyes to read the exit number for the nearest fast food restaurant while zooming down the highway at 65 mph.

 Design 


Although this new technology has opened up many new opportunities for businesses and organizations, many of the old rules for designing and implementing still apply. You&apos;re looking for something that&apos;s going to catch and hold your audience&apos;s attention while delivering a core, easily-absorbed message. A keen sense of graphic design that incorporates color, negative space, and proportion is still critical for successful campaigns. The ability to continually change the content allows for more trial and error than ever before, but the design should never be taken lightly.

Smart screen design still depends on the careful consideration of individual audiences and the particular type of content that you&apos;re deploying. The illumination of an LED screen is the perfect forum for powerful, eye-catching messaging. Self-service kiosks, for example, simultaneously cut operating costs and provide unprecedented, automated customer service. The efficiency of these and their wayfinding capabilities should deliver shorter waiting lines and faster checkout speed.
