 4 Ways Restaurants Should Use QR Codes 
 March 8, 2012 by Hamilton Chan 21 Like Tweet +1 Share Pin It Share 
 Hamilton Chan is CEO and founder of Paperlinks , which provides the leading QR code infrastructure for businesses. If you’re at SXSW this weekend, check out Paperlinks’all new one-tap shopping app, PayDragon , at the peached tortilla truck ! 

Despite criticism, the QR code continues to be a major player in the evolution of mobile commerce.

But while many Fortune 500 advertisers may have embraced the QR code in their marketing efforts, the restaurant industry has proven a relatively late adopter of the technology.

When used to power speedier transactions and provide timely information, the QR code is a useful tool for restaurateurs seeking to augment the customer experience. On takeout menus, dine-in menus and real world advertising, the QR code has a purposeful place in the restaurant experience.

 SEE ALSO: 10 Funniest QR Code Fails 

As any supporter of QR codes, near field communication (NFC) chips, or augmented reality will tell you, the key is the destination, not the mode of transportation. It doesn’t matter if information is delivered with zero friction, if the information itself isn’t wanted, it won’t pay off.

Are QR codes just a marketing fad, or can the mobile technology deliver real value for restaurants and consumers at the right place and at the right time? Here are four ways QR codes can be effectively leveraged in a restaurant environment to improving the overall dining experience.

1. Mobile Ordering

Ordering food from a smartphone is incredibly convenient. It is sub-optimal to have to speak to a live person, who is juggling multiple roles in a restaurant, dealing with customers face-to-face and handling several ringing phone lines.

Enter the QR-coded takeout menu. Restaurants realize that the printed takeout menu is still one of the most effective ways to elicit food orders. It’s tangible, colorful, holds a lot of information and is easily shared. Adding a QR code to the menu triggers a mobile ordering experience. That way, restaurants can marry the best of old and new technology and make the traditional takeout menu digitally interactive.

Or prompt a customer to complete a takeout order online, at which point she’ll receive a custom-generated QR code to be scanned at the point-of-sale. The Melt handles orders by generating QR codes that help consumers skip the ordering line.

2. Links to Photos and Social Media

 

Ever stare at a text-based menu and wonder what a particular dish actually looks like? A QR code strategically placed on a dine-in menu has the ability to take consumers to additional information. The QR code could lead to photos with dish names, to the restaurant’s Yelp listing, or to Twitter and Facebook links to encourage social media sharing.

On takeout menus and any real world advertising, the QR code can trigger links to a wealth of useful information. In this manner, the QR code is not a marketing gimmick, but a bona fide mechanism to provide interested parties with information on which they can act.

The mobile landing page launched by the QR code on a takeout menu could include hours, contact information, a map and directions. Special offers and feedback forms could also be part of the mobile-optimized experience.

Additionally, most QR readers have a history tab that logs previously visited sites, so the information, once scanned, could be referenced later.

3. Different Restaurants, Different QR Code Applications

The QR code can be utilized effectively by a variety of different restaurant types, from fine dining to casual, from fast food to food trucks.

A fine dining establishment might wish to use the QR code in a city guide advertisement, which leads to its online reservations system and photos of the interior of the restaurant.

A fast food restaurant could add the QR code to a table tent ad, leading to a special promotion in exchange for an email address.

And food trucks could affix a QR code to the side of the vehicle to help people skip the line, should they wish to order and pay through their smartphones.

4. A Word About Aesthetics

A common objection to QR codes is that they are ugly and unbefitting of a nicely designed marketing strategy. It is true that the standard out-of-the-box QR code isn’t particularly aesthetically pleasing, but brands can improve the appearance with clever design tricks that ensure scanability and beauty.

By going with a custom-designed QR code, restaurants can represent their style, while also reassuring customers that the restaurant has put some thought into the experience.

As consumer smartphone adoption continues to surge, QR code usage is becoming more sophisticated. In particular, QR codes are transforming from a mere advertising hook to an integral part of mobile infrastructure. From boarding passes to takeout menus, the QR code is becoming less novelty and more utility.

One challenge for restaurants is always staying fresh in the minds of consumers. The restaurant that embraces mobile technology intelligently will demonstrate its cutting-edge commitment to excellent user experience and customer service.

Chili’s recently failed with a QR code- the code was on the door as we walked in. As I stopped to scan, I blocked a man’s way into the restaurant. The tag line said something to the effect of“win free food”I quickly filled out the form to see if I would win anything and it just thanked me for my information. No offer, no telling me they would send me emails if I filled out the form (can spam if they do?) nothing. Very disappointed that the ad didn’t match the landing page!

So not so much“4 different ways”, so much as“4 related versions of the same thing”.

QR codes have a long way to go before I am convinced that they’re anything more than a solution looking for a problem. They look‘quirky’and“modern”, but they’re generally useless.

??? Blows my mind how QR codes are still fighting for the tipping point. The possibilities are really endless but the simplest example is: you’re walking by a bar that has a cool looking QR in their window. You scan it and it says something like:“Nice scan, you just earned yourself a free beer. Come on in and show this to the bartender for a cold one on us!”

You telling me you wouldn’t be in there (assuming you had the time and liked the general appearance of the place)? The key to the success of QR codes, IMO, will be for apple to bake a qr reader into the phone’s camera.

Why there?? There are so many germs on all doors any way. Do we really need a new place to put another QR code? Seriously? What about putting them on our foreheads or better yet a“tramp stamp”. What’s next…our cars our, houses, a hidden QR code inside our bain or maybe a pinky toe or 2 ??? I can’t keep typing b/c it’s too ridiculous for me…Anyway, it’s a free country, so QR yourself or your business anywhere you like ~~~LOL ~Zahara~

Great article! I think this trend is going to continue in western countries this year, especially as we see QR codes being progressively used outside of just the typical hyped up marketing tech arena. QR codes will really shine when used for mobile commerce and the simplifying of small daily processes. I think custom QR codes are also going to be more important than ever for keeping users aware and engaged with your code! I love to stare at our gallery of custom QR codes from time to time: http://QRlicious.com/showcase

For good looking QR codes I use iQR codes app ( http://iqr.hrubasko.com ). I am not very skillfull in computer graphics, but with this program I am able to create fabulous looking QR codes. It is really easy to use.

What about codes on menus linking to nutritional data or diet plan data (drop down of the diet of your choice)? That would be discreet and incredibly useful. Dieters/people with‘diet restrictions’everywhere would rejoice. Or history of the food for dinner conversation? Or appropriate wine pairings/course suggestions? A history of the table? Allow people to check in at the table and follow the table to see who has shared the same space, integrate with pictures? Meh. Also, love the scan to pay, scan to query menu. Eliminates all the wait/cashier staff from the formula and just lets the cooks do their job. Servers still need to deliver food and tend to drinks, greeters still need to seat just now they are freed up to focus on CUSTOMER SERVICE. No jobs lost just easier work. yay.

By the time every one has a QR scanner app on their phone and a significant amount of businesses are utilizing QR codes, they will be dead because every phone will have NFC technology and it will be hardly any more expensive to wire your retail/restaurant with NFC readers. I would much rather hold my phone nearby a symbol/stamp and eneter a pin number than open up a camera application or QR reader app. QR is catching on very slow…before we know it NFC chips will be in all of our phones and it will be cheap enough for companies to use them rather than building QR codes.

I have a fifth way restaurants could utilize QR Codes: I would also recommend some sort of window or door decal to show off their facebook or twitter or whatever online social media channel of choice might be… http://socialmediadecals.com is one option for an array of decals plus custom designs. Window (and door) placement for visibility each time a customer goes into or out of the establishment. Just have to be smart about where to place the decals as to not run into issues like @jacklyn mentioned.

QR codes are worthless. By the time they might be accepted the technology will be dead and replaced. The biggest problem with them now is that marketing and advertising agencies have no idea how to properly use them.

Do you actually expect me to pause a commercial while I pull out my phone, turn on the code app, get up from my comfortable sofa and walk over to to the TV to capture a QR code?

Do you really expect me to run beside a moving bus while I try to star up the code app so that I can experience an interactive perfume ad?

Do you really think that my phone has the focal length to capture a code on a billboard?

And if you put a QR code on product packaging don’t serve up the same copy and content that is on the packaging that is currently being held in my other hand.

“marketing and advertising agencies have no idea how to properly use them”–very true but in no way makes them worthless.

When your phone’s camera comes stock with a qr reader and you scan a code in a deli’s window that tells you that you just unlocked a free drink, you’re telling me you wouldn’t think about going in?

Great article! We have seen some pretty innovative marketing campaigns with QR codes with some of our clients. Mobile ordering would be a great way to implement the QR, and as the Mobile Payment technology increases along with NFC, customers can simply scan and pay all from their mobile device. And with mobile devices gravitating to strictly smartphones, the time is better than ever now.

I always say restaurants should place QR codes on the bottom of their soup bowls. This way when customers finish a bowl of soup, they get to interact with their empty dish and scan it to potentially win a free appetizer. It would read“Scan me to win a free dish!”–It would encourage scanners to share where they are and what they are eating, before it links to over to a page where it notifies them if they won. It would keep customer engaged, interested and entertained, while making him/her a brand ambassador. #FreeIdea Signed, @EliFromBrooklyn

As a huge fan of the QR, it’s really frustrating to see how poorly marketers have been using the codes. Sending a QR code to a site’s homepage is just about the dumbest thing you could do with the technology. Here are a few creative ways we’ve used custom QR’s with some of our clients:

Joe Jack’s Fish Shack, a local restaurant here in Puerto Vallarta, always has a line down the block on the weekends, which frustrates people. Now there’s a QR on the wall outside that opens up“Joe Jack’s Fish Facts”–random facts about the town/restaurant. Randomly, a free tee shirt pops into the facts as well.

Also at Joe Jacks, the coasters have QRs that ask you what you’re drinking (with pictures, a description, and a recipe for each drink on the menu). Clicking the images opens up a mobile postcard that reads“Wish you were here”for the clients to post their friend’s social walls.

Another client of ours owns a historic villa, which people always want to tour. Now, there’s a wooden QR on the front of the house that opens a beautiful video allowing people to check out the house without actually bothering the owners.

It’s all about creativity and formatting for mobile. Once apple bakes QR readers into the iPhone’s camera, I think we’ll see the technology really take off.

Some interesting comments.“QR codes are useless”?

They make it easier to get information which works for me. I just went to Quiznos and scanned their code for club special. It made it easier.

For restaurants and small retail stores they have a lot of value. Namely they can help the owners create a valuable marketing list.
