This place hasn&apos;t changed much in 35 years, but it&apos;s still fun ... And we enjoyed (as always) the block of cheese with warm bread. Our steaks and sides were very good, too - and terrific cake for dessert. &quot; Dined on 07/07/2012 2011 Special Features: good for groups , kid-friendly Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful.

We had heard of the place from a friend in California. It was quiet and seems to have lost it&apos;s popularity. The only reason would be from the changing trends. The restaurant had everything that a good meal, ambiance, service, and entertainment has to offer. I would definitely recommend it, if you are wanting to get away from the riverwalk crowds and go back in time where a good prime rib and a glass of wine is offered. &quot; Dined on 07/06/2012 2011 Special Features: good for groups , kid-friendly , special occasion Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful.

The steaks albeit good, were terribly over-priced along with everything else on the menu. The lobster bisque looked and tasted like the water used to wash the lobster in. The service was timely as there was hardly anyone else there. At on time, the Old San Franciso Steakhouse was a place to celebrate a special occasion. Sadly, there is nothing special anymore. No, I would not recommend Old San Francisco Steakhouse. :( &quot; Dined on 06/28/2012 2012 Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful. Thank you!

Overall rating (Good) 3 / 5 Entrees OpenTable Diner Since Dined on 04/14/2012 2012 Dined on 04/14/2012 2012 Food (Good) 3 / 5 Service (Very Good) 4 / 5 Ambiance (Very Good) 4 / 5 Noise Level Moderate &quot; Steak ordered Medium well and it came as medium rare in the center - my son ate it anyway. My husband&apos;s meal was not edible - first, he had lobster bisque that had shrimp in it and given a teaspoon to eat it with. The restaurant had no soup spoon! Finally waiter found a tablespoon after a couple attempts. His meal consisted of something with stuffed crab and shrimp - it was so tough (overcooked) that he ate one. At the time we didn&apos;t want to complain because he thought that&apos;s how it should be. We enjoyed the salad, cheese and bread very much. Will recommend restaurant, but also share experience. We have been to restaurant prior to this and experiences were great. We definitely don&apos;t mind paying for what we get. Thanks. &quot; Dined on 04/14/2012 2012 Special Features: vibrant bar scene , special occasion Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful. Thank you!
