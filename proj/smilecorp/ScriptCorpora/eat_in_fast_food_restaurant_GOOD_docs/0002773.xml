Always one in the thread.
 
 &quot;In a case that could set the first broad judicial standards for the use of Tasers , a federal appeals court in California has ruled that the police can be held liable for using one of the devices against an unarmed person during a traffic stop.
 
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, said the electrically disabling device constituted excessive force when used against an unarmed man who did not pose a threat, and it refused to allow a police officer immunity for its use.&quot;

I guess it is time to abandon the taser for the old fashion nightstick to the face. &quot;I said comply!&quot; 


+1 Self-centered anarchists never support the enforcement of order in our society. That is usually due to them living the same life as &quot;Line Cutter Lucca&quot;. Tasers are convenient, but pepper spray, night sticks and choke holds are just as effective and never get any press. Perhaps it&apos;s time to start teaching our LEOs pain compliance submission holds again in the academy... lets face it... there is a big population of miscreants out there that need to get their asses kicked a few times to get their heads on strait!
 

They never stopped. I love the infra-nasal and brachial stun. Clavicular thumb press is a good one too.

5 seconds of intense pain, with only probe wounds to show for it the next day.
The alternative is being beaten into submission with whatever impact weapon is handy. Or worse, they go hands on, and you go home with sprained or broken bones or joints.

Thats a simple call. Ma&apos;am the store wants you to leave the grounds immediately. If you do not you will be arrested for tresspassing. she refuses. They arrest her. how much force they use to arrest her is up to her. 

+1 she was not tazed for budding in line. She was tazed for resisting arrest like most people are ultamately tazed for.

Tazed for budding in line is a better headline though. User Info

 Posted: 2/6/2012 10:03:12 PM My name is Lucca
Hit McDonald&apos;s in my Ford
I cut in front of you
Ordered combo number four

If you don&apos;t let me order food
You&apos;ll put this bitch in a crazy mood
Just don&apos;t tell me pull around
Just don&apos;t tell me pull around
Just don&apos;t tell me pull around

I think it&apos;s because I&apos;m smokin&apos;
I try to lay off the weed
Now I feel electrodes pokin&apos;
Holy shit they tasin&apos; me

They only tase until you flop
Just like a fish right until you drop
You wait your turn next time around
You wait your turn next time around
You wait your turn next time around

Yes I think I&apos;m okay
Suffered a Big Mac Attack
If you ask that&apos;s what I&apos;ll say
It&apos;s not your business anyway
I just can&apos;t seem to eat enough
Especially when my hands are cuffed

Just don&apos;t ask me please drive through [x3]
