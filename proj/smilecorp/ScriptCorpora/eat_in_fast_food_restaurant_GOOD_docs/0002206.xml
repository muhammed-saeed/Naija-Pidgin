Once you pick that out, then you move on to your preference of type of rice, mashed potato or a lettuce...

 May 16, 2012 Likes it so happy by nancy ( 39 reviews ) so excited jax has these now. love their food, always tasty. yes this location is a bit awkward and crowded but nothing too major to be overlooked. the chicken and curry mustard and plaintains and red beans and rice are always MY FAV. I used to live in Orlando and loved eating here, when Jax got them, i took my husband for the 1st time--needless to say he is hooked and always asks when can we go?? And it is dirt cheap, i mean really, dinner for 2 for like $15....u can&apos;t beat that and the flavors, salsas, sauces etc are incredible. May 1, 2012 Likes it Please ignore these negs. by JT Boyd ( 40 reviews ) These people are insane. Its a fast food place OK, not a 5 star restaurant. I swear the internet has made idiots out of half the population. Listen, this place does Caribbean right... plain and simple. They have a limited menu, and although ordering is a little confusing, you will be rewarded for your efforts. The chicken is moist and tasty, and the Mojo pork is just plain fantastic. I am so happy we have 2 Pollos in Jax now, I ate at one in Orlando about 4 times a week. A much needed addition to the Jacksonville scene. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful April 19, 2012 Likes it Very Good by TLC1971 ( 7 reviews ) Although the seating and ordering process is a little odd, it&apos;s easy to overlook because the food is SO good. I had the tropichop with pork, rice and black beans. The portion was huge. It was very fresh and delicious. The salsa/sauce bar has a lot of different and tasty choices. No matter what other reviews may say, if you can&apos;t get into Pollo Tropical and decide to try somewhere else, DO NOT go to Bahama Breeze instead. They are terrible. Either wait patiently or try Pollo a little later! It&apos;s worth it! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful April 15, 2011 Likes it Great Flavors&amp;Choices by Lisa ( 100 reviews ) I loved Pollo Tropical in south Florida, so I was thrilled to see them open a location in Jacksonville. The choices are extensive and go beyond chicken. I had the shrimp wrap with the caribbean corn pudding side. The combos are reasonably priced and the unique and many healthy side dishes make this my location of choice when I am actually going to drive through a restaurant for lunch. 3 out of 3 found this review helpful January 4, 2011 Likes it I&apos;ve been waiting years by Dan W ( 36 reviews ) I was so excited when I saw that Jacksonville would be getting a Pollo Tropical of our own. The food is great for the price and I&apos;m in love with the salsa bar. I encourage everyone to try anything and everything on the menu. It&apos;s tasty! 4 out of 4 found this review helpful May 7, 2011 Likes it Finally a taste of Spanish food in Jax!! by Joe Noplis ( 16 reviews ) Pollo Tropical Rocks! Food is fresh and has so many great flavors (more to flavor than just salt and Pepper!) Fried Yuca is OMG GOOD!! Sweet Plantains ARE EXCELLENT!! The Grilled Chicken with the grilled caribbean ribs are awesome!! The rice&amp;beans so yummy! 3 out of 3 found this review helpful April 17, 2012 Likes it Great surprise by Richard ( 3 reviews ) Tried a tropichop for lunch.It was perfect for a lunch run,fresh ingredients and fast with good service. March 3, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it What a shame by katz1158 ( 17 reviews ) I love Caribbean food but this is just sad. It&apos;s the Taco Bell of Caribbean - fast and relatively inexpensive. But if it&apos;s good Caribbean food you want, spend a little more and go to Bahama Breeze or Mango-Mangoes. November 25, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by Thefoodcritic ( 6 reviews ) Best fast food restaurant in town! Fresh ingredients, friendly service, great location. I&apos;ve been to several Pollo Tropical locations down in South Florida and this location is the best. They&apos;ve introduced a pager system at the tableside for waitstaff assistance ( no tipping permitted). I look forward to going to Pollo Tropical once a week. 3 out of 3 found this review helpful December 23, 2010 Great Fast Food by Christina ( 4 reviews ) This was very good fast food. The food was fresh and tasted so good. My favorite was the pork. So Good! 3 out of 3 found this review helpful March 18, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it A confused Restaurant Concept by FoodMaven ( 14 reviews ) Met my son-in-law yesterday for a first time Pollo Tropical experience. When I got close to the door there was a podium and a sign indicating&quot;Please Wait to be Seated&quot;. REALLY. REALLY! This is no more than a fast food restaurant posing as a casual dining concept. Since this was our first visit, we viewed the menu above the cashier area and was surprised by the array of entrees and the images of&quot;fully-plated&quot;meals. With that said, we both ordered the Chicken and Yellow Rice w/ vegetables - Marinated, chopped, boneless chicken breast on a bed of yellow rice mixed with garden vegetables. One order had bell peppers and sauteed onions as an added&quot;topping&quot;, the other only had the sauteed onions. We moved our way to the soda behemoth machine and was nearly tackled by a server with a tray full of food coming out of the kitchen door.

Note to Mgt. - kitchen door should not be in the same path as the self-serve drink station. In a matter of seconds after we sat down, the server delivered our order. Although we ordered similar entrees, it was technically different. The server couldn&apos;t figure out which was which since they were prepared incorrectly. She offered to bring an extra toppings to the table for the mistake. Now let me just say that I understand you should consider professionally produced images of entrees don&apos;t always look like the product that will be served, but you have to be kidding me!!! The image of the menu items we ordered was filled to the top of the bowl with product that was nearly over-flowing. What we received was about half of that. And to top it off, it was cold. Pollo Tropical is yet another poor attempt of a restaurant concept that certainly will have a limited existence in Jacksonville. 3 out of 5 found this review helpful November 30, 2010 Likes it ahhh finally! by Jax Munchy ( 4 reviews ) thank you pollo tropical for coming to JAX!!!! 3 out of 3 found this review helpful March 1, 2011 Really likes it Mobile review by Dontel Madison ( 1 review ) I went for the first time today and LOVED it I&apos;ve been thinking about my chicken chipole sandwich all day I&apos;m even eating it for dinner later :) 3 out of 3 found this review helpful October 12, 2011 Bien Pollo by GoodFoodCritic ( 11 reviews ) Chicken is quite good, but a bit on the smoky flavor. Items are hot and fresh. Service was quite slow though, had to wait awhile. There was quite a line and the staff was not that well trained enough to handle the pressure, you can see them in their frenzy with their supervisor barking orders. But overall, the food is good. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful September 8, 2011 Likes it Excellent food, kids menu, veggie items&amp;free Wi-Fi!! by Nancy Fontaine ( 3 reviews ) the food is amazg, good quality, good portions, reasonable prices, the ding room service is really great, they tell you not to tip, they have a really great salsa/condiment bar, drinks are self-serve w/free refills, casual yet nice restaurant environment&amp;their drive thru is amazingly fast!

Their plantains are tasty&amp;perfectly cookd and they have a new corn chowder type side order that is delish! I was bit under whelmed w/their chopped chicken but it&apos;s still good&amp;the chicken on the bone is quite tasty&amp;juicy. Their pork sandwich is very good w/slow roasted pork, a tangy sweet sauce on a kaiser bun&amp;their chicken quesadilla is good bc the sauce is mild&amp;it makes the chopped chicken less dry although there wasn&apos;t enough cheese. i&apos;m not crazy about the yellow rice w/veggies and their unsweet reg tea&amp;unsweet mango tea is very refreshg! i love the table numberg system bc a place so busy needs some order&amp;organizatn. they also have an amazg kids menu w/many&quot;kid type foods&quot;that kids love. They are also open until midnight most nights, you can sign up for free text coupons on their website http://pollotropical.com/default.aspx&amp;their chicken is never frozen&amp;hormone free. i noticd some folks have made comments herein about the messy ding room or slow/sub-par service. Sunday&amp;Monday were madhouse crazy busy, I agree. I was there. the ding room was only messy for a bit bc they were turng over tables like crazy&amp;the line was literally out the door. every table was taken. it is bc the food is amazg&amp;well-pricd and bc they have two staffs in the restaurant right now bc they are traing new employees for the new location about to open this weekend Sept 16th in Mandarin. I hear it will be off San Jose by Wal-Mart which is near the 295. can&apos;t wait! 4 emps we spoke w/were on shift for the first time ever. if you want to beat the crowds go durg the wk as anywhere w/in SJTC. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful November 27, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by MB09 ( 3 reviews ) AWESOME!

The man running the door said he needed our party size before we moved. I tried to go back inside as it was hot and sunny and the AC was our point in coming in for a snack after a day shopping, but no, we were yelled at again for trying and given the&quot;fire marshall&quot;won&apos;t let you in we are at capasity...as a local attorney I can assure the were not at capasity and will not be getting my business.

Hard to beat!! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful April 9, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Markiepoo ( 81 reviews ) Ugly decor, dry bland food no thank you!!! 1 out of 3 found this review helpful March 4, 2011 Desperately needs new management. by Rachel ( 1 review ) What a terrible experience! First off, we waited probably 30 minutes in the drive through from the time we ordered until the time we finally got to leave. They were out of the chipotle ranch sauce for the quesadilla wrap special they were offering, and when we asked if there was anything the girl recommended in lieu of, she said&quot;Not really.&quot;Then she proceeded to not listen to anything we said while ordering, and we had to literally repeat everything. When we got to the window, it was apparent she had a major attitude problem and practically threw the food out the window at us, shorting us one drink. We mentioned that we had ordered a second drink, and she reluctantly gave it to us. The drinks both felt light, and we discovered they had only filled them up half of the way. SERIOUSLY?! We will NEVER go back. Even if the food was filled with gold, we wouldn&apos;t go back to this place. It clearly has bad management. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful
