 Shipping question re: Priority boxes and envies and rates...
 I&apos;m so confused about this Priority stuff. Can you help me figure this out?

I have a hardback book to sell. I don&apos;t know how much it weighs--I don&apos;t have a scale. I have to use Priority, so I don&apos;t have to go to the post office. I see that when you use Priority, you get free boxes (which I just ordered) and they&apos;ll pick up your stuff for free.

I see the Priority Flat Rate envelope costs $4.95. It is too small for this book. The small Flat Rate Priority box is also $4.95. It is also too small. The next larger size Priority box costs $10.35! No buyer would pay that much to have a book shipped! So what do I do?

Can I put this hardback book in a big yellow envelope and print out a $4.95 Priority shipping label and slap it on the big yellow envie and mail it like that?

This&quot;Flat Rate&quot;thing has me confused. I thought if you had a scale, you could weigh your packages and enter the amount of the weight and the USPS site would calculate the shipping rate for you, then you give them yoru credit card number, pay for it, and print out a label that you tape onto the package. Now what is this FLAT RATE all about? Does that mean that if something really heavy, like a small brick, can be mailed in a priority box for that low rate of $4.95? Maybe if you weighed the brick and entered the weight, it might cost you say for fun, $26 to ship, but IF it can fit in that small $4.95 Flat Rate Priority box, then you COULD mail it like that for only $4.95 versus the expensive $26? Do I have that right? If so, then how is the post office making money? Why did they make this change? Are they just trying to be competitive?

Thanks for helping me figure this out. Reply With Quote 08-16-2009,  11:46 AM #2 freebiemaniac

You can send anything priority you just pay whatever the weight and priority costs are for that particular package. But keep in mind you have to use boxes other than the flat rate boxes. I would not mail a book priority , I would use media mail it is the cheapest way to go. It takes longer but so what. If the buyer wants it shipped priority then they have to be willing to eat the shipping costs otherwise it would be media mail. Media is only for books, tapes and DVD&apos;s though.

In answer to your questions. Yes if you had a brick that would normally cost say $25.00 to be shipped if it fits in the flat rate box it will ship for that rate so it is possible to save money. But from the sizes of the boxes not much will fit. Not even in the largest one. I think I would weigh each package I was shipping first to see if it is less with regular priority over flat rate and then use whichever saves me the most money. You can still weigh and print your label as long as you use any box other than the flat rate boxes if it is less expensive to send that way. you have all of the options you had before , flat rate just gives you one more option to save.

 Post Office will have someone pick up your package - it does not have to be Priority Mail. Just call them. I do it all the time when the package is too big for the mailbox and they are very nice about picking up packages. Reply With Quote 08-17-2009,  12:40 PM #4 Gooddealie

I see that when you use Priority, you get free boxes (which I just ordered) and they&apos;ll pick up your stuff for free. If you just have one book to sell then you are better off making 2 trips to the post office - one before you list it, and the other after the auction is over.

During the first trip, bring the book and have the postal clerk give you the most appropriate priority mail box. Get them to weigh the book + box + any packing materials together, and write the combined weight down on a piece of paper. That&apos;s the weight you use when you list the auction.

If you get a nice postal clerk and there isn&apos;t a giant line up behind you, you can ask the clerk what the cost would be to send the book to each zone. Write those amounts down - you can use them to confirm that the eBay shipping calculator numbers are correct and reasonable.

The only reason I suggest making 2 trips to the post office is because you only have the one item to sell. If you think you&apos;re going to sell more regularly, then I would invest in a good scale for home. You can buy them on eBay for around $20.

Do I have that right? If so, then how is the post office making money? Why did they make this change? Are they just trying to be competitive? Not all of the priority mail boxes are fixed rate boxes. In fact, most of the priority mail boxes that the post office supplies are just boxes - you pay for 2-3 day delivery based on the weight of the package.

The post office also has some flat rate boxes. Those are fixed price boxes that you can stuff with anything, regardless of weight, as long as you can seal the box. You are paying for 2-3 day delivery for thses boxes too.

Putting a hardcover book in an envelope can be done but it&apos;s risky because it may well get damaged in shipping. You probably need something a little better to protect it in transit.

Most buyers will prefer to pay for media mail shipping, rather than priority mail because yes, it is cheaper. So you may want to offer that as an option too. But if you send something by Media Mail, then you need to supply your own box (can&apos;t use a post office priority box), and your rating for shipping time may suffer a bit since it&apos;ll take the book a while to arrive and your customer may blame you for the post offices&apos; delay.

Yes, you do have the flat rate part right - you could mail a brick if it would fit in a flat rate box or a flat rate envelope. The post office makes money because most people don&apos;t mail bricks, they mail things that are considerably lighter. Collectively, it evens out in the wash (some may overpay, some may underpay but use it anyway for the convenience). I doubt the post office loses money on it, or they wouldn&apos;t keep the service.

I do it all the time when the package is too big for the mailbox and they are very nice about picking up packages. I think that depends on your local post office. Some areas are stricter than others. Priority gets definitely gets picked up for free for sure. Media mail - I wouldn&apos;t count on it unless you have a very nice mailman. Mine will pick up 1st class package only if you have at least 1 priority package being picked up at the same time. Reply With Quote 08-20-2009,  01:16 PM #6 hawkshockey11
