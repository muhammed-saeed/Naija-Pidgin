Notes on rendering:

 Using the tags here will mean that your editing efforts are more likely to show up in the various renderers. However, there is no guarantee that a tag listed here will be rendered by any particular renderer or by the renderers used by the main map page. For specific information on how to ensure that your symbols are rendered in Mapnik and Osmarender tiles, look at Symbol Rendering . There also may be many tags that will render on the main map page that are not listed here. This list is not updated with all the tags implemented by the renderers. The &apos;Rendering&apos; column in these tables is only an example of how an imaginary map might choose to render the feature. It does not dictate how our renderers may render it, nor indeed any other map. 

The tables are grouped by theme, with the more commonly used first.

Each section is a template which can be used for language translations.

 Highway 

Used to describe roads and footpaths. See Highways for further guidance and Restrictions for details of access limitations by vehicle type/ time/ day/ load/ purpose etc.

 Key Value Element Comment Rendering Photo Roads highway motorway A restricted access major divided highway, normally with 2 or more running lanes plus emergency hard shoulder. Equivalent to the Freeway, Autobahn, etc.. highway motorway_link The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a motorway from/to a motorway or lower class highway. Normally with the same motorway restrictions. highway trunk Important roads that aren&apos;t motorways. Typically maintained by central, not local government. Need not necessarily be a divided highway. In the UK, all green signed A roads are, in OSM, classed as &apos;trunk&apos;. highway trunk_link The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a trunk road from/to a trunk road or lower class highway. highway primary Administrative classification in the UK, generally linking larger towns. highway primary_link The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a primary road from/to a primary road or lower class highway. highway secondary Administrative classification in the UK, generally linking smaller towns and villages highway secondary_link The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a secondary road from/to a secondary road or lower class highway. highway tertiary A &quot;C&quot; road in the UK. Generally for use on roads wider than 4 metres (13&apos;) in width, and for faster/wider minor roads that aren&apos;t A or B roads. In the UK, they tend to have dashed lines down the middle, whereas unclassified roads don&apos;t. highway tertiary_link The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a tertiary road from/to a tertiary road or lower class highway. highway living_street For living streets , which are residential streets where pedestrians have legal priority over cars, speeds are kept very low and where children are allowed play on the street. Also known as Home Zones in the UK. highway pedestrian For roads used mainly/exclusively for pedestrians in shopping and some residential areas which may allow access by motorised vehicles only for very limited periods of the day. To create a &apos;square&apos; or &apos;plaza&apos; create a closed way and tag as pedestrian and also with area =yes . highway residential Roads which are primarily lined with housing, but which are of a lowest classification than tertiary and which are not living streets. Using abutters = residential together with tertiary, secondary etc for more major roads which are lined with housing. highway unclassified To be used for minor roads in the public road network which are not residential and of a lower classification than tertiary. Please do not use this as a marker for roads where the classification is unknown, for which highway = road should be used. Use highway = residential for minor roads lined with housing. See highway = service for access roads highway service For access roads to, or within an industrial estate, camp site, business park, car park etc. Can be used in conjunction with service =* to indicate the type of usage and with access =* to indicate who can use it and in what circumstances. highway track Rough roads, often with unpaved/unsealed surfaces and normally used for agricultural or forestry uses etc. Use tracktype =* for tagging to describe the surface. highway bus_guideway A busway where the vehicle guided by the way (though not a railway) and is not suitable for other traffic. Please note: this is not a normal bus lane, use access =no , psv =yes instead! highway raceway A course or track for (motor) racing highway road A road of unknown classification. This is intended as a temporary tag to mark a road until it has been properly surveyed. Once it has been surveyed, the classification should be updated to the appropriate value. Paths highway path A non-specific or shared-use path. Probably better to use highway = footway for paths mainly for walkers, highway = cycleway for one also usable by cyclists, highway = bridleway for ones available to horses as well as walkers and highway = track for ones which is passable by agriculture or similar vehicles. highway footway For designated footpaths; i.e., mainly/exclusively for pedestrians. This includes walking tracks and gravel paths. If bicycles are allowed as well, you can indicate this by adding a bicycle =yes tag. Should not be used for paths where the primary or intended usage is unknown. Use highway = pedestrian for pedestrianised roads in shopping or residential areas and highway = track if it is usable by agricultural or similar vehicles. highway cycleway For designated cycleways; i.e., mainly/exclusively for bicycles. Add foot =* only if default-access-restrictions do not apply. highway bridleway For horses, (in the UK, these are rights of way for pedestrians, horse-riders and cyclists). Equivalent to highway = path + horse = designated . highway steps For flights of steps (stairs) on footways. Use with step_count =* to indicate the number of steps Lifecycle highway proposed For planned roads, use with proposed =* and also proposed =* with a value of the proposed highway value. highway construction For roads under construction. Use construction =* to hold the value for the completed road. Attributes abutters commercial/ industrial/ mixed/ residential/ retail etc. See Key:abutters for more details. cycleway lane / opposite / opposite_lane / opposite_track / shared / share_busway / shared_lane / sharrow / track See Key:cycleway for more details. ice_road yes A highway is laid upon frozen water basin, definitely doesn&apos;t exist in summer. incline Number %/° Incline steepness as percents (&quot;5%&quot;) or degrees (&quot;20°&quot;). Positive/negative values indicate movement upward/downwards in the direction of the way. junction roundabout This automatically implies oneway =yes , the oneway direction is defined by the sequential ordering of nodes within the Way. This applies on a way, tagged with highway =* already. lanes number The number of traffic lanes for general purpose traffic, also for buses and other specific classes of vehicle. lit yes/no Street lighting motorroad yes / no The motorroad tag is used to describe highways that have motorway-like access restrictions but that are not a motorway. mountain_pass yes The highest point of a mountain pass. mtb:scale 0-5 Applies to highway = path and highway = track . A classification scheme for mtb trails (few inclination and downhill). mtb:scale:uphill 0-5 A classification scheme for mtb trails for going uphill if there is significant inclination. mtb:scale:imba 0-4 The IMBA Trail Difficulty Rating System shall be used for bikeparks. It is adapted to mtb trails with artificial obstacles. mtb:description Text Applies to highway = path and highway = track . A key to input variable infos related to mtbiking on a way with human words overtaking yes/ no/ both/ forward/ backward Specifying sections of roads where overtaking is legally forbidden. passing_places yes A way which has frequent passing places sac_scale hiking / mountain_hiking / demanding_mountain_hiking / alpine_hiking / demanding_alpine_hiking / difficult_alpine_hiking Applies to highway = path and highway = footway . A classification scheme for hiking trails. service alley/ driveway/ parking_aisle etc. See Key:service for more details. surface paved / unpaved / asphalt / concrete / paving_stones / cobblestone / metal / wood / grass_paver / gravel / pebblestone / grass / ground / earth / dirt / mud / sand See Key:surface for more details. tactile_paving yes / no A paving in the ground to be followed with a blindman&apos;s stick. Not to be rendered on standard maps. tracktype grades 1-5 To describe the quality of the surface. See Key:tracktype and Key:surface for more information. traffic_calming yes/ bump/ hump/ cushion/ table etc. See Key:traffic_calming for more details. trail_visibility excellent / good / intermediate / bad / horrible / no Applies to highway = path , highway = footway , highway = cycleway and highway = bridleway . A classification for hiking trails visibility winter_road yes A highway functions during winter, probably can&apos;t be driven in summer. Other features highway bus_stop A small bus stop. Can be mapped more rigorously using public_transport = stop_position for the position where the vehicle stops and public_transport = platform for the place where passengers wait. See public_transport =* for more details. highway crossing Pedestrians can cross a street here; e.g., zebra crossing highway emergency_access_point Sign number which can be used to define your current position in case of an emergency. Use with ref = NUMBER_ON_THE_SIGN highway ford The road crosses through stream or river, vehicles must enter any water. See also ford =* . highway give_way A give way sign emergency phone A calling device can be used to tell on your current position in case of an emergency. Use with ref = NUMBER_ON_THE_SIGN highway mini_roundabout Similar to roundabouts, but at the center there is either a painted circle or a fully traversable island. In case of an untraversable center island, junction = roundabout should be used.
Rendered as anti-clockwise by default. To render clockwise add the tag direction = clockwise .
 highway motorway_junction Indicates a junction (UK) or exit (US). ref =* should be set to the exit number or junction identifier. (Some roads - e.g., the A14 - also carry junction numbers, so the tag may be encountered elsewhere despite its name) highway passing_place The location of a passing space highway rest_area Place where drivers can leave the road to rest, but not refuel. highway speed_camera A fixed road-side or overhead speed camera. highway street_lamp A street light, lamppost, street lamp, light standard, or lamp standard is a raised source of light on the edge of a road, which is turned on or lit at a certain time every night highway services A service station to get food and eat something, often found at motorways highway stop A stop sign highway traffic_signals Lights that control the traffic highway turning_circle A turning circle is a rounded, widened area usually, but not necessarily, at the end of a road to facilitate easier turning of a vehicle. barrier bollard/ cattle-grid/ gate/ lift_gate/ stile toll_booth etc Used to describe various barriers on the route - normally defined as nodes at the appropriate location. highway User Defined All commonly used values according to Taginfo

 Barrier 

Used to describe barriers and obstacles to travel. See Barriers for more details on usage.

 Key Value Element Comment Rendering Photo Linear barriers barrier city_wall A fortification used to defend a city or settlement from potential aggressors.
From ancient to modern times, they are used to enclose settlements.
 right side is bottom, left side is top. if both sides are same height then add &quot;two_sided=yes&quot;. 

See also historic = city_gate .
 barrier ditch A trench, ditch or ravine, usually with a stream at the bottom, that is not easily crossed, especially if not on foot.
Can be used in combination with waterway = stream or waterway = drain . barrier fence a freestanding structure designed to restrict or prevent movement across a boundary. It is generally distinguished from a wall by the lightness of its construction. barrier guard_rail A guard_rail, also called a crash barrier. Right side is inner, left side is outer. barrier hedge is a line of closely spaced shrubs and bushes, planted and trained in such a way as to form a barrier or to mark the boundary of an area. barrier kerb A (for example footway) kerb is a barrier for vehicles and wheelchair drivers. The height of the kerb is important and with this information, the usage by different groups can be determined. The height of the kerb is tagged additionally as height =* , if available. Right side is bottom, left side is top. barrier retaining_wall Retaining walls serve to retain the lateral pressure of soil. Right side is bottom, left side is top. barrier wall a freestanding structure designed to restrict or prevent movement across a boundary made from solid brick, concrete rocks, and almost always built so that it is opaque to vision. Access control on highways barrier block A large, solid, immobile block that can be moved only with heavy machinery or great effort.
Typically big solid things made of concrete for stopping larger vehicles.
Sometimes natural boulders are used for the same purpose. barrier bollard solid (usually concrete or metal) pillar or pillars in the middle of the road to prevent passage by some traffic. barrier border_control This is a control point at an international border between two countries. Passports or other forms of ID will be checked. barrier bump_gate See wikipedia:Bump gate [1] [2] [3] barrier bus_trap See wikipedia:Bus trap barrier cattle_grid Bars in the road surface that allow wheeled vehicles but not animals to cross.
Sometimes known as a Texas Gate, even outside of Texas barrier chain A chain used to prevent motorised vehicles. barrier cycle_barrier Barriers to bicycle traffic, most typically a pair of staggered steel bars perpendicular to the way itself whose gaps allow pedestrians to pass. barrier debris An abandonned road is blocked by debris with or without ground. The photo does not display the road after the debris because it was a slope road and the photo was taken on the top. barrier entrance A hole in a linear barrier with no specific construction that limits passing through.
 access =yes is understood.
The limitations are the same of the way that crosses it, if there is such. barrier full-height_turnstile A full-height turnstile, also called HEET-turnstile (High Entrance/Exit Turnstile), like the ones to access security areas. Note the mix of hyphen and underscore. barrier gate An entrance that can be opened or closed to get through the barrier.
Combine with access =* where appropriate. barrier horse_stile A horse stile allows pedestrians and horses to cross a gap through a fence, but prevents or makes it very difficult for motorcycles and live stock to cross. barrier jersey_barrier A jersey barrier consists of heavy prefabricated blocks to create a barrier. Use material =plastic or material =concrete to express the used material. barrier kent_carriage_gap A Kent carriage gap is used by local authorities in the UK to prevent motorised vehicles from accessing public rights of way whilst allowing most horse drawn carriages to pass.
These are now becoming common on byways in the UK [4] barrier kissing_gate A gate which allows people to cross, but not livestock. barrier lift_gate A lift gate (boom barrier) is a bar, or pole pivoted in such a way as to allow the boom to block vehicular access through a controlled point.
Combine with access =* where appropriate. barrier log Use this when the passage is closed by lumber (trunk of a tree). This kind of barrier is often useful to sit on. This barrier is a penalty to cyclists but can be crossed by lifting the bike over. barrier motorcycle_barrier Barriers along paths that prevent access to motorcycles. barrier rope A flexible barrier made of fibres, twisted or braided together to improve strength. As a barrier it is often more symbolic than actually physically preventing pedestrians from accessing. barrier sally_port A sally_port is used to pass through thick or city walls, and is a type of covered gate with two doors. barrier spikes Spikes on the ground that prevent unauthorized access. Can also be removeable e.g. after payment in a garage. barrier stile A stile allows pedestrians to cross a wall or fence, but never actually &quot;opens&quot; the barrier
(unlike a gate, a stile has few or no moving parts). barrier sump_buster A concrete slab or steel structure that prevents passing of two-tracked vehicles with less than a minimum track and ground clearance (typically stops normal cars) [ [5] ] 100px barrier swing_gate Similar to a lift gate but rotates sidewards to open. It is usually made out of metal bars (wood or other material possible) and is intended to prevent cars from access but can usually be crossed by pedestrians and cyclists. barrier toll_booth A road usage toll or fee is collected here barrier turnstile A turnstile (also called baffle gate) is used to allow one person at a time to pass. Use this for small turnstiles like the ones in supermarkets or some subways. barrier user defined All commonly used values according to Taginfo

 Cycleway 

To describe infrstructure designed mainly for cyclists. See also: Cycle routes .

 Key Value Element Comment Rendering Photo cycleway lane A lane is a route that lies within the roadway cycleway opposite Used on ways with oneway = yes where it is permitted to cycle in both directions.
Note - such streets are common in Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, for example, but are rare in the UK (although they do exist): often, instead, actually the street is two-way as normal for its whole length except for the very short section past the no-entry sign at the end, where cycles are excepted from the no-entry by means of a short lane separated by an island. This is called a &quot;cycle plug&quot;. In some places this has been represented as very short oneway Way at the end with an adjacent cycleway, forming a little triangle with the road they join to, or sometimes with a short oneway Way with cycleway=opposite_lane or opposite_track.
 cycleway opposite_lane Used on ways with oneway = yes that have a cycling lane going the opposite direction of normal traffic flow (a &quot;contraflow&quot; lane) cycleway opposite_track Used on ways with oneway = yes that have a cycling track going the opposite direction of normal traffic flow cycleway shared Cyclists share space with other traffic on this highway. cycleway share_busway There is a bus lane that cyclists are permitted to use. cycleway shared_lane Cyclists share a lane with motor vehicles, but there are markings indicating that they should share the lane with motorists. cycleway sharrow As shared_lane, and the marking is the on-road shared-lane marking called a &quot;sharrow&quot; [6] . cycleway track A track is a route that is separate from the road.+ oneway = yes if needed. cycleway user defined All commonly used values according to Tagwatch

 Tracktype 

Used to describe the surface quality of the track, path or road.

 Key Value Element Comment Rendering Photo tracktype grade1 Paved track or heavily compacted hardcore. tracktype grade2 Unpaved track; surface of gravel mixed with a varying amount of sand, silt, and clay. See Gravel road on Wikipedia. tracktype grade3 Unpaved track; an even mixture of hard and soft materials. tracktype grade4 Unpaved track; prominently soil/sand/grass, but with some hard materials, or compressed materials mixed in. tracktype grade5 Unpaved track; lack of hard materials, uncompacted, subtle on the landscape, surface of soil/sand/grass.

For larger rivers (defined as more than 12m across) see waterway = riverbank ( Other languages ). waterway riverbank Used for larger rivers, to define an area between the opposite riverbanks. See water =river for alternative tagging. waterway stream A naturally-formed waterway that is too thin to be classed as a river. An active, able-bodied person should be able to jump over it if trees along it aren&apos;t too thick. Some additional attributes for waterways waterway dam A wall built across a river or stream to impound the water. A dam normally does not have water flowing over the top of it. intermittent yes Indicates that the waterway does not have a permanent flow (i.e. is sometimes/often dry). lock yes ( ) A lock is used for moving boats between waterways at two different levels. Can tag either the section of the way between the gates (detailed) or just a single node in the waterway (less detailed). mooring yes/private/no A length of bank where boats are explicitly permitted to moor. maxstay =* should be used for timing information. service transportation/water_power/irrigation A waterway = canal may have one (or more; separate with semicolons) uses. tunnel culvert ( ) For a stream passing under a road use tunnel = culvert on the section of stream passing under the road (don&apos;t use this tag for open-top culverts or roads using the culvert structure as a bridge ( bridge = culvert )). waterway lock_gate To mark the position of gates at each end of a lock. Alternatively, for smaller locks use a single lock = yes node in the middle of the lock. waterway turning_point A place to turn the driving direction for vessels, where the boats are longer than the river/canal is wide. Use maxlength =* to denote the maximum length of the vessel. waterway weir A barrier built across a river, sometimes to divert water for industrial purposes. Water can still flow over the top. waterway user defined All commonly used values according to Taginfo

 Power 

Used to map electrical power generation and distributions systems. See Power for further information.

 Key Value Element Comment Rendering Photo power cable_distribution_cabinet In these cabinets, the 400-V circuits to the house connections, connection and transfer points of the regional utilities are branched. Other uses include distributions of the municipal street lighting. power generator A place where power is generated. Use in combination with generator:source =* , generator:method =* and generator:output =* . power line A way following the path of power cables. For minor power lines with poles and not towers, you may want to use power = minor_line . power minor_line A way following the path of minor power cables, supported by poles and not towers/pylons.

Value &quot;yes&quot; is generic, or you can specialize. covered yes Used to denote that a node, way or area is covered by another entity (or in some cases the ground), when the use of layers is inappropriate, or additional clarification is needed. Various, depending on the covered entity crossing no / traffic_signals / uncontrolled cutting yes A cut in the land to carry a road or tram. Mostly in hilly landscape. Source disused yes For features that are useful for navigation, yet are unused. See abandoned =* if infrastructure is removed. drive_through yes / no Used to indicate if a pharmacy, bank, atm, or fast_food, or post_box offers drive_thru service. drive_in yes / no Used to indicate if a cinema is a drive-in cinema or a restaurant offers drive-in service. drive_in is different than drive_thru ele Number Elevation (also known as altitude or height) above mean sea level in metre, based on geoid model EGM 96 which is used by WGS 84 ( GPS ).

If according to local traffic rules a bicycle is no longer seen as a bicycle when there&apos;s no one driving it, then there&apos;s no need for using bicycle=dismount. If the local legislation still sees an undriven bicycle as a bicycle then you may need to use both bicycle=dismount and bicycle=no. boat yes / designated / private / permissive / destination / delivery / agricultural / forestry / unknown / no emergency yes Access permission for emergency motor vehicles; e.g., ambulance, fire truck, police car foot yes / designated / official / private / permissive / destination / delivery / agricultural / forestry / unknown / no Access permission for pedestrians.

 General access permission.
 agricultural - Only for agricultural traffic delivery - Only when delivering to the element. designated - A preferred or designated route for a specific vehicle type or types. Not compulsory but often marked by a traffic sign destination - Used for ways in designated local traffic areas, where traffic should only enter if its destination is within the area forestry - Only for forestry traffic no - No access for the general public. Consider using another tag indicating who can use the element official - The way is dedicated to a specific mode of travel by law. Usually marked by traffic signs and exclusive. In Germany use is also compulsory. clarification needed permissive - Open to general traffic until such time as the owner revokes the permission which they are legally allowed to do at any time in the future. private - Only with permission of the owner on an individual basis unknown - No information provided on access. This is the default value for most features with a general assumption that access is allowed for all purposes yes - The public has an official, legally-enshrined right of access, i.e. it&apos;s a right of way 
 charge Number Amount of toll or fee date_off Date Date restriction stops date_on Date Date restriction starts day_off Day of Week Day restriction stops day_on Day of Week Day restriction starts disused yes For features that are useful for navigation, yet are unused or abandoned. hazmat yes / designated / private / permissive / destination / delivery / agricultural / forestry / unknown / no Access permission for vehicles carrying hazardous materials. For values see above hour_off Time Time restriction stops hour_on Time Time restriction starts maxheight Height height limit - units other than metres should be explicit maxlength Length length limit - units other than metres should be explicit maxspeed Speed Maximum speed - units other than km/h should be explicit maxstay Number Maximum stay, in units given (hour/hours/day/days) maxweight Number Weight limit - units other than tonnes should be explicit maxwidth Width width limit - units other than metres should be explicit minspeed Speed Minimum speed - units other than km/h should be explicit noexit yes A dead end road/cul de sac with only one access road oneway yes / no / -1 
 oneway = yes for traffic direction same as the sequence of nodes of the way ( maplint will highlight &quot;true&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, so they can be updated to &quot;yes&quot;).
 oneway = no for bidirectional traffic ( maplint will highlight &quot;false&quot; and &quot;0&quot;, so they can be updated to &quot;no&quot;).
 oneway = -1 for traffic direction opposite to the sequence of nodes of the way (if the way cannot be reversed).
Some road types are assumed to be one-way (e.g. highway = motorway ), others are assumed to be two-way (most others). The direction of the sequence of nodes of a way is indicated by sequential order of nodes within the way.
Hint: When using the editor JOSM, enable &apos;arrows&apos;!).

The maplint highlighting will help with updating of the tags which will allow simplification of style sheets to prevent unintentional rendering errors creeping in. See Talk:Key:oneway .
 toll yes Toll or fee must be paid to access way, see also barrier = toll_booth traffic_sign city_limit Start/end sign of city limits, in most (all?) countries implies a specific &quot;city maxspeed&quot;.

 Places 

Used for give details about settlements

 Key Value Element Comment Rendering Photo Populated urban areas place city The largest urban settlements in the territory, normally including the national, state and provincial capitals. These are defined by charter or other governmental designation in some territories and are a matter of judgement in others. Should normally have a population of at least 100,000 people and be larger than nearby towns. See place = suburb and place = neighbourhood for how to tag areas within a city. place town A second tier urban settlement of local importance, often with a population of 10,000 people and good range of local facilities including schools, medical facilities etc and traditionally a market. In areas of low population towns may have significantly lower populations. See place = neighbourhood and possibly also place = suburb for how to tag areas within a town. place village A smaller distinct settlement, smaller than a town with few facilities available with people traveling to the nearby town to access these. Populations of villages vary widely in different territories but will nearly always be less than 10,000 people, often a lot less. See place = neighbourhood for how to tag areas within a larger village. place hamlet A smaller rural community typically with some 100 inhabitants. place isolated_dwelling For a named settlement consisting of only a few households in a rural setting. place farm A distinct named individual farm. See also landuse = farmyard .) place suburb A distinct section of an urban settlement (city, town, etc.) with its own name and identity. e.g.

Among other things, it might be used in selecting which name to render at a given zoom level at what font size. place_name User Defined Only for areas. For nodes use &apos;name&apos; instead (see Notes ). It may do no harm to use both, though. place_numbers User Defined For property numbers. Note: Most people now use the Karlsruhe Schema instead of this tag. postal_code User Defined The postal code. Note: Most people now use the Karlsruhe Schema instead of this tag.

Only required key for an address (except when addr:housename is used), all others are optional. addr:housename user defined The name of a house.
This is sometimes used in some countries like England instead of (or in addition to) a house number. addr:street user defined The (main) name of the respective street.
A way with highway =* and the corresponding name should be found nearby. addr:place user defined part of address, which is not related to street, but to some territorial zone, linear object, node or some abstract object. addr:postcode user defined The postal code of the building/area. addr:city user defined May or may not be a clone of is_in:city =* (in some places the city in the address corresponds to the post office that serves the area rather than the actual city, if any, in which the building is located)! The name of the city as given in postal addresses of the building/area. addr:country user defined The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 two letter country code in upper case .
Example: &quot;DE&quot; for Germany, &quot;FR&quot; for France, &quot;IT&quot; for Italy.

See also: is_in:country =* addr:full user defined Use this for a full-text, often multi-line, address if you find the structured address fields unsuitable for denoting the address of this particular location. Examples: &quot;Fifth house on the left after the village oak, Smalltown, Smallcountry&quot; or &quot;1200 West Sunset Boulevard Suite 110A&quot;.
