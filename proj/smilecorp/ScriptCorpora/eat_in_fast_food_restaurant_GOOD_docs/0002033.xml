Court-approved GPS helps police link Syracuse man to break-ins

Syracuse, NY - A Syracuse man whom police linked to numerous break-ins by using a court-authorized GPS device on his car was sentenced Tuesday to serve 19 to 23 years in state prison.

Jerel Walker, 23, of Melbourne Avenue, claimed he was innocent and accused police of assaulting him and violating his rights, witnesses of lying about him and County Judge Joseph Fahey of making bad rulings in his recent trial.

Assistant District Attorney Laura Fiorenza asked Fahey to impose consecutive penalties, charging that Walker made his living by committing“crime after crime after crime”in the community.

A County Court jury convicted Walker Dec. 21 of second-degree burglary and fourth-degree grand larceny in connection with an August 2009 break-in at a home in the town of Salina. The jury also convicted him of fourth-degree grand larceny -- but acquiited him of burglary -- for another August 2009 incident in which credit cards were stolen from an East Side residence and used at an area fast-food restaurant.

Additionally, the jury convicted him of petit larceny and fifth-degree criminal possession of stolen property for a third August 2009 incident in which property was stolen from a car in the Valley section of the city.

According to Fiorenza, Syracuse police had been investigating a rash of East Side burglaries when a credit card from one of the break-ins was used at a local Burger King restaurant. With identification information from employees and a security video showing the car involved, police obtained a court order authorizing them to place a GPS tracking device on Walker’s car, the prosecutor said.

With that information, police began staking out neighborhoods where the vehicle was driven, Fiorenza said. After the Salina residence was burglarized while the homeowner was sleeping, police traced Walker’s car to a West Colvin Street residence where the burglary victim’s stolen television was recovered, the prosecutor said.

When police discovered Walker’s car was parked in the Valley section of the city, several teams of officers moved into the neighborhood and began watching for the suspect, Fiorenza said. One officer saw Walker walk back up to the parked car and put some items in the trunk before he got in the passenger seat and rode off with a second person, the prosecutor said.

Police found the car moments later in a nearby driveway and took the driver, Philip D. Jackson, into custody, but Walker had already left the scene, Fiorenza said. Other police in the neighborhood found a parked car that had been ransacked and the owner identified his property in the trunk of Walker’s car, the prosecutor said.

Police also found items from the Salina burglary in the car along with Walker’s wallet, she said.

In sentencing Walker, Fahey said he thought there was“nothing more predatory and parasitic”than breaking into someone’s home while the resident was asleep inside the home.

He then sentenced Walker to serve 15 years in prison for the burglary and consecutive penalties of two to four years for the two grand larceny convictions.

Jackson, 29, of Midland Avenue, is scheduled to be tried separately in the various incidents.

Geez, how much money has been spent on trials, public defenders, police manpower, and court time on this vermin? For once a judge got it right....Good job Judge Fahey and of course SPD.

Next up, Deshawn Gainey, another persistent felon who makes his living and supports his drug habit through robbing and stealing. That piece of crap has already been in state prison two different times for a total of about 2 dozen burglaries, all at the ripe old age of around 21. Time to throw away the key on that crackhead now.

The GPS should tell me where to show up when he needs me.
