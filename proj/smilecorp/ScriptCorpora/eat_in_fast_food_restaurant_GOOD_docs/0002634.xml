The fast-food restaurant chain is located in Louisville, Kentucky.  The very first restaurant was opened in 1969 in Lexington, Kentucky on Southfield Drive. It was originally named the Cape Codder which accounts for the LJS early chain restaurants. The chain began as a division of Jerrico, Inc. which also began in Lexington and was very similar to Big Boy restaurants.

Jerry’s Restaurant was converted to Denny’s by the new owners but Long John Silver’s remained the same with franchisees being opened all over the south and Midwestern areas of the United States. The restaurant was made up to look like the nautical look. The seats were made to look like nautical flags; customers can see the food being prepared and most of the entire bell that you can ring in approval of the food.
