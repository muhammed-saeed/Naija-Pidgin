		Revisions to Climate Change Science 
 
 Monthly   The Tropical Lower 
Troposphere Temperatures graph and the Global Lower Troposphere Temperatures 
graph are updated monthly.

 September 4, 2011  In &quot;Sun and Cosmic Rays&quot;, added a 
graph and discussion of CERN&apos;s CLOUD experiment which confirms that cosmic 
rays strongly enhance the formation rate of aerosols by up to ten fold. 
Also added discussion and a graph from a study by Dr. Svensmark which shows that 
decreases of cosmic rays during Forbush decreases result in a decrease of 
aerosol and a decrease of the cloud water content by up to 7% about 9 days after 
the Forbush minimum.

 August 28, 2011 In &quot;Climate Models&quot;, added a graph which 
compares the Levitus observations of ocean warming trends 1955 - 1999 
versus depth to the model runs of 15 IPCC climate models. The climate model 
runs show wildly different behaviour and none come close to matching the 
observations.

 July 21, 2011  In &quot;Aerosols&quot; , added a chart showing 
SO2 and soot emissions in China. China&apos;s SO2 emissions have declined 14.5% from 
2006 to 2009 according to the 2009 report on the state of the environment in 
China.

 July 14, 2011  In &quot;Aerosols&quot;, added a chart showing the 
decline in global aerosols from 1993. &quot;By 2005, global aerosols had dropped as 
much as 20 percent from the relatively stable level between 1986 and 1991. 
... Today 75% of all desulphurisation systems are being installed in 
China. The reduction of aerosols, especially over China, allows more sunlight 
through the atmosphere to warm the Earth&apos;s surface, contributing to global 
warming.&quot;

 July 11, 2011  In &quot;Severe Weather&quot;, added a graph 
showing the decline of tornado activity with global warming. &quot;global warming 
causes FEWER tornado outbreaksnot more.&quot; In &quot;Heating of the Troposphere&quot;, 
updated three graphs which show that contrary to climate model projections, the 
troposphere has been warming at a much lower rate that surface temperatures, and 
troposphere temperatures have declined since 2002. In &quot;Sea Level Rise&quot;, added a 
map of sea level rise from January 2002 to Aprl 2011 based on the Jason-1 
satellite.

 July 4, 2011  In &quot;Severe Weather&quot;, updated the 
Accumulated Cyclone Energy graph. Northern Hemisphere and global tropical 
cyclone ACE has decreased dramatically to the lowest levels since the late 
1970s. Added a graph of tropical cyclone frequency. The global frequency of 
tropical cyclones has reached a historical low.

 May 21, 2011  In the &quot;Milankovitch Cycles&quot; section, 
added a graph and discussion of global ice volume rate of change and northern 
solar insolation over the last 750,000 years. There is a very strong correlation 
between global ice volume changes and solar insolation. Minor changes in the 
Summary section concerning water vapour and cloud feedbacks were made.

In the &quot;Water Vapour Feedback&quot; section, added a graph of CO2 and Water 
vapour&apos;s effect on optical depth.

In the &quot;Sun and Cosmic Rays&quot; section, added a discusion of experiments, 
using a Danish particle accelerator and a cloud chamber, that 
show increased radiation from cosmic rays leads to more aerosols. Low 
solar activity increases the cosmic ray flux which increases 
cloud formation and cools the climate.

 May 19, 2011 In the &quot;Water Vapour Feedback&quot; section, added 
graphs from the NASA Water Vapour Project (NVAP). A graph of global water vapour 
anomaly from 300 to 500 mbars shows a significant decline.

 May 8, 2011  Added a graph which compares ocean heat 
content to GISS climate model projections 2003 to Q1 2011. Updated the diagram 
on global energy flows with the graphic from TFK 2009.

 April 17, 2011  Added results from a study by R. 
McKitrick, S. McIntyre and C. Herman, August 2010, that shows that the 
climate model temperature trends are four time higher than observed in the 
mid-troposphere for the period 1979 to 2009.

 April 29, 2010  In the &quot;CO2 Greatly Increases Plant and 
Forest Growth&quot; section , added &quot;A 2003 study using 18 years (1982 to 1999) of 
satellite observations shows that global net primary plant production 
increased 6% over 18 years. The largest increase was in tropical ecosystems. 
Amazon rain forests accounted for 42% of the global increase in net primary 
production.&quot;

 September 20, 2009  Created an &quot;Aerosol&quot; section. 
Aerosol are tiny particles that affect climate by reflecting or absorbing 
sunlight. A significant part of 20th century warming may be due to changes in 
aerosols, especially in the Arctic. Aerosols resulting from marine 
micro-organisms and land plant emissions cause a negative feedback to climate 
change by seeding cloud formation.

 August 6, 2009  In the &quot;IPCC and Model 
Projections&quot; section, added a graph of the IPCC projections of CO2 
concentrations in the air to 2100 corresponding to the six emission scenarios. 
Also added a graph which compares the actual to IPCC projections of CO2 for 
January 2000 to January 2010. Added a column to the table of the IPCC scenario 
projections, which shows the maximum projected CO2 growth rate. The CO2 growth 
rate of the A1FI scenario increases from 0.51%/year in the 2000-2010 decade to 
1.20%/year by 2060. The actual annual CO2 growth rate in 2007 and 2008 were both 
0.49%.

 July 26, 2009  In the &quot;Climate Models Fail&quot; section, 
added a discussion on falling ocean heat content. Most of the change of the 
climate system&apos;s heat is in the oceans. Data from the ARGO floats network 
shows the ocean heat content has been declining since 2003, in stark contrast to 
the projected increasing heat content of climate models.

In &quot;Sea Level Rise&quot; added graphs of global, Pacific ocean and Atlantic ocean 
sea level rise with trends from January 2004 to March 2009. The global sea 
level rise since January 2004 of 1.52 mm/year is less than half of the 
overall trend from 1992 of 3.1 mm/year.

 June 19, 2009  In the &quot;Climate Sensitivity&quot; section, 
added two graphs from a presentation by Dr. Richard Lindzen that compare the 
outgoing radiation at the top of the atmosphere as measured by the ERBE 
satellite to that predicted by climate models in response to changes in sea 
surface temperatures. The satellite data shows a negative feedback and low 
climate sensitivity, the opposite of all the climate models which predict a 
positive feedback.

 June 14, 2009  Created a &quot;Cloud Feedback&quot; 
section. Moved a discussion on high clouds into this section and added a 
discussion of Dr. Roy Spencer&apos;s recent work which shows that low clouds cause a 
strong negative feedback.

 June 13, 2009  In the &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; section, 
added information on Irena Sendler, who saved 2500 infants and 
children from the Nazi Warsaw Ghetto during WWII. A candidate for the 2007 Nobel 
Peace Price, she lost to the IPCC and Al Gore.

 June 4, 2009  In the &quot;Water Vapour Feedback&quot; section, 
add a graph of specific humidity at 400 mb (8 km altitude), which shows specific 
humidity has declined by 17% since 1948 in the upper troposphere.

 May 30, 2009  In the &quot;No Consensus&quot; section, updated 
the number of scientists who have signed the Global Warming Petition Project 
from 19,700 to 31,478.

 April 4, 2009  In the &quot;Severe Weather&quot; section, added a 
graph of Northern Hemisphere accumulated cyclone energy 1950 to 2008. Added live 
graph of the global accumulated cyclone energy. Global hurricane activity has 
decreased to the lowest level in 30 years.

In &quot;Sea Level Rise&quot; section added graph of the rate of sea level rise from 
the Proudman Oceanography Laboratory.

In &quot;Urban Heat Island Effects&quot; added a description of the surfacestations.org 
project and a picture of a poorly sited surface weather station.

 March 10, 2009  In the &quot;Water Vapour Feedback&quot; section, 
added a graph of optical depth changes from 1948 to 2008 calculated by a 
line-by-line program, utilizing water vapour content from the NOAA 
Earth System Research Laboratory. It shows the total effective amount of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has not significantly increased over the last 
60 years.   

 July 17, 2008  Added the section &quot;Climate 
Sensitivity&quot;.

 July 14, 2008  In the &quot;Warnings of Global Cooling&quot; 
section, added a declaration by the Space and Science Research Center: Global 
warming has ended - a new climate era of pronounced cold weather has 
begun.

In the &quot;Water Vapour Feedback&quot; section, added a paragraph describing the Miskolczi theory. Adding CO2 to the atmosphere just replaces an equivalent amount of 
water vapour to maintain an almost constant greenhouse effect and has 
negligible effect on global temperatures. 

 In &quot;The 
Science in Summary&quot; section, added a comment about the Miskolczi theory. 

 July 13, 2008  Added the section &quot;Milankovitch 
Cycles&quot;. Added the section &quot;Water Vapor Feedback&quot;. The section &quot;IPCC and Model 
Projections&quot; was split into two sections. The second part is called &quot;Climate 
Models Fail&quot;.

In the &quot;Warming on Other Planets&quot; section, added comments on Jupiter and 
Triton global warming.

In the &quot;Urban Heat Island Effects&quot; section, added comments on NASA&apos;s GISS 
urbanization adjustments. NASA applies an urban adjustment in the wrong 
direction in 45% of the adjustments, making the temperature trends steeper.

In the &quot;Severe Weather&quot; section, added a discussion of a paper by Dr. Indur 
M. Goklany which shows a decline of death rates from severe weather 
events. 

 January 6, 2008  In the &quot;Sun 
Activity Does Correlate with Temperature&quot; section, modified the Scafetta&amp;West graph of Sun proxies versus Northern Hemisphere temperatures to include the 
MSU lower troposphere record from 1979. Using the satellite temperature record 
eliminates much of the urban heat island effect that contaminates the surface 
temperature record.

In the &quot;No Consensus&quot; section, added a link and 
comments about an open letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations 
titled &quot;UN Climate Conference Taking the World in Entirely the Wrong 
Direction&quot;. 

 January 1, 2008  In the &quot;Sun 
Activity Does Correlate with Temperature&quot; section, added a plot of the level of 
Lake Victoria and sunspot number with a discussion about the paper &quot;Linkages 
between solar activity, climate predictability and water resource development&quot; 
by WJR Alexander et al, June 2007. 

 December 31, 2007  In the &quot;Sun 
Activity Does Correlate with Temperature&quot; section, updated the discussion on the 
Scafetta and West solar contribution to climate change to include information 
from their November 2007 paper. 

 December 30, 2007  In the &quot;Urban 
Heat Island Effects&quot; section, added a discussion of a paper by Ross 
McKitrick and Patrick Michaels published December 2007 concerning the 
correlations between the surface temperature record and social economic 
indicators. They conclude that adjustments made to the surface temperature 
record to correct for the urban heat effects are inadequate, and if the record 
was fully corrected the surface temperature trend from 1980 to 2002 would be 
reduced in half. Also added a discussion of the surface versus the troposphere 
temperature trends, and noted that correcting the surface record would reduce 
its trend to closely match that of the troposphere record.

In the &quot;IPCC 
and Model Projections&quot; section, added a discussion of a paper by Douglass et al 
published December 2007. The paper compared the troposphere temperature trends 
in the tropics predicted from climate models to actual satellite and radiosonde 
observations. It concludes that computer model results and observed temperature 
trends are in disagreement in most of the tropical troposphere, being separated 
by more than twice the uncertainty of the model mean. In layers near 5 km, the 
modelled trend is 100 to 300% higher than observed, and, above 8 km, modelled 
and observed trends have opposite signs.

In &quot;The Science in Summary&quot; 
section, added &quot;In atmosphere layers near 5 km, the modelled trend is 100 to 
300% higher than observed.&quot; and &quot;Fully correcting the land temperature record 
would reduce the warming trend from 1980 to 2002 in half.&quot;

In the &quot;CO2 - 
Temperature Correlation&quot; section, added a statement that the Sun may have caused 
10 to 20% of the increase in CO2 during the last century.

 December 26, 2007   In the 
&quot;Introduction&quot; section, added the Global Lower Troposphere Temperatures 
graph.

In the &quot;Sun Activity Does Correlate with Temperature&quot; section, added a 
comment that if one corrects the Scafetta and West analysis to use the 
uncontaminated satellite data, it shows that the Sun has contributed 
at least 75% of the global warming of the last century.

 November 11, 2007   In the &quot;IPCC and Model 
Projections&quot; section, added a discussion of the Earthshine project, which shows 
that the climate forcing of changing albedo is much greater than that due to 
20th century CO2 increases.

 November 10, 
2007   In the &quot;IPCC Hockey Stick&quot; section, added &quot;The IPCC 
argues that there was little natural climate change over the last 1000 years, so 
that the temperature change over the last 100 years in unusual and likely caused 
by human activities.&quot; to the first paragraph. Added a discussion of the NRC 2006 
Report and the Wegman 2006 Report, and the IPCC&apos;s failure to consider the 
reports&apos; findings in the Fourth Assessment Report.

Added a link to 
Holland&apos;s paper - &quot;Bias and Concealment in the IPCC Process: The &apos;Hockey Stick&apos; 
Affair and its Implications&quot;.

Shortened a section name to &quot;Sun and Cosmic 
Rays&quot;.

In the &quot;IPCC and Model Projections&quot; section, added &quot;Researchers 
at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) reported in September 2007 
that individual tropical warming cycles that served as proxies for global 
warming saw a decrease in the coverage of heat-trapping [high altitude] cirrus 
clouds .... If computer models incorporated this enhanced cooling effect from 
high clouds, &quot;it would reduce estimates of future warming by over 75 percent,&quot; 
Spencer said.

In &quot;The Science in Summary&quot; section, added &quot;Real world data 
shows that high clouds cause a strong negative feedback on climate, but climate 
models assume that clouds cause a positive feedback.&quot;

 November 4, 2007    In 
the &quot;Urban Heat Island Effects&quot; (UHI) section, added a graph and discussion of 
the UHI effect by Steve McIntyre based on data from a Peterson (2003) 
study.

In the &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; section, added a link to an article 
listing 35 errors in AIT by Christopher Monckton of Brenchley.

 November 1, 2007    In 
the &quot;Sun and Cosmic Rays&quot; section, added a graph of troposphere temperature vs. 
cosmic ray count from Svensmarks rebuttal of the Lockwood paper, with a 
discussion and link to my critique of the Lockwood paper. Added H. 
Svensmark and E. Friis-Christensen names to second paragraph.

 October 28, 2007    In 
the &quot;Heating of the Troposphere&quot; section, replaced the MSU Tropical Temperature 
graph (from Climate Audit) with graph the Tropical Lower Troposphere 
Temperatures graph, which is updated monthly.

 October 25, 2007     In the 
&quot;Heating of the Troposphere&quot; section, updated Surface and Troposphere 
Temperature Trend Tropics graph, added GHCN 2006.

 October 14, 2007    In 
the &quot;Heating of the Troposphere&quot; section, changed This graph shows two analyses 
 The two analyses use different methods to adjust for factors such as orbital 
decay and inter-satellite differences.

In the &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; 
section, added a discussion of the British High Court ruling the AIT with a link 
to 11 inaccuracies.

In the &quot;Heating of the Troposphere&quot; section, added 
This shows that most of the global temperature change can not be attributed to 
increasing CO2 concentrations.

In &quot;The Science in Summary&quot; section, 
added Computer model results presented in the IPCC Fourth Assessment 
Report shows that if CO2 is the main climate driver, the temperature profile in 
the atmosphere will show a unique and distinctive pattern - a CO2 fingerprint of 
global warming. Actual temperature data shows no such CO2 fingerprint. 
Therefore, the computer model data proves that CO2 is not the main climate 
driver.

 October 5, 2007    Made 
several typo corrections based on email from Joy Clarke. 
In the 
&quot;Global Sea Level Rise&quot; section, Any difference between the raw satellite 
measurement and the tide gauge measurement is assumed at the tide gauge 
location. Added a discussion of a study by Wppelmann et 
al, which used global positioning satellite stations to correct tide 
gauge data for vertical land movements. Note that this estimate is 58% less than 
the estimate reported (1993 - 2003) in the IPCC AR4.

 September 8, 2007    In 
the &quot;Global Sea Level Rise&quot; section, added See here for a description of how 
satellite data is calibrated to the sea level rise of a set of tide gauges.

In the &quot;Sun and Cosmic Rays&quot; section, added the Open Solar Flux 
plot.
