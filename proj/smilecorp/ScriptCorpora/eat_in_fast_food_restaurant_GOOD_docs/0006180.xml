Best and Worst Fast-Food Salads
 Which salads are highest in calories and fat, and which are lowest? By Elaine Magee, MPH, RD 
WebMD Expert Review 


When you&apos;re looking to order something relatively healthy from a fast-food menu, you probably go for a salad. But did you know some fast-food salads are as high in calories and fat as a double Quarter Pounder with cheese (740 calories, 42 grams of fat)?

Two key ingredients can make or break your fast food salad: chicken (specifically, whether you choose &quot;grilled&quot; or &quot;crispy&quot; style) and salad dressing. Although some fat helps make salad dressing taste good, many fast-food dressings go too far. A serving of blue cheese dressing at Carl’s Jr., for example, adds 320 calories and 34 grams of fat to your salad.

 

Below are my picks for some of the best and worst salad options at the 10 top fast food chains. The &quot;best&quot; salads were those with the most fiber and the least saturated fat; the “worst” salads had the highest levels of saturated fat, total fat, and/or calories.

My list is based on what restaurant chains posted on their web site. Restaurants revamp their recipes and serving sizes from time to time. So I encourage you to check  the nutrition information posted on their web sites for the most current information.

If you do that, you may also be able to customize the information to suit your needs. For example, if you only use half a packet of salad dressing, you might be able to filter your results that way. Same thing if you use two packets of dressing. Little things like that make a big difference in your calories, fat, sodium, and more.

Best Fast Food Salads

All these fast food entrée salads have less than 5 grams of saturated fat, and most have less than 15 grams of total fat. Those with more than 15 grams of fat feature nuts, which are nutrient-rich and contribute &quot;smart&quot; fats (monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat).

Because of the fat and sodium content of many fast-food salad dressings, I&apos;ve suggested using only half a pack of dressing with some of these salads. That should be plenty for most people.
