The Real Deal with Fast Food Calorie Counts
 Fast food is notorious for slathering on calories and fat. Many states are passing laws mandating that this nutritional information be posted for you to evaluate when ordering. But just how accurate is this menu information? Dr. Oz went undercover to find out. Pin It Added to Articles on Thu 05/19/2011 
Dr. Oz sent an undercover team to 4 of the top fast food restaurants. The mission? To find out if what’s listed on the menu is really what you’re eating. Independent lab analysis of fast food menu items, conducted by RL Food Testing Laboratory, found some discrepancies with the calorie and fat content listed on the menus.

 

Find out what’s really in your food choices, and learn the small changes you can make to ensure your meal is as healthy as it can be.

 

 The Order: 6-inch Subway Club sandwich containing turkey, ham, lettuce, tomato and mayo

 Menu Board: 310 calories and 4.5 grams of fat

 Lab Analysis: 380 calories and 12 grams of fat

 What gives? The person making your sandwich may have a generous hand with the mayo, oil and cheese.

 What You Can Do: Be diligent while your sandwich is made. Make sure your sandwich is loaded up with veggies and light on condiments. If you’re having cheese, go with Swiss, a low-sodium option. Avoid the mayo and replace with brown mustard; 2 teaspoons is only 5 flavor-packed calories.

 

 The Order: Wendy’s value size French fries, natural cut with sea salt 
 Menu Board: 220 calories and 11 grams of fat
 Lab Analysis: 237 calories and 11 grams of fat
 What Gives? The menu’s estimate is a fairly honest one. What’s misleading about these fries is the name. They are called “natural cut,” but they actually contain 43% more sodium than the old fries.
 What You Can Do: Substitute the fries for a small chili, which has the same calorie count, while including 6 grams of fiber and 18 grams of protein. If you really want fries, look for options with more potato. Steak fries are better than regular, while curly fries are better than shoestring.
