Make Your Own Jibbitz (Crocs Shoe Charms)
 I am by no means a crafty person myself, but I saw this and thought it was a great idea for making your own inexpensive Jibbitz-type charms for holey Crocs-type shoes, so I thought I&apos;d share it here:

I also had an idea when someone mentioned the Jibbitz wristbands .

You could make one by taking a rubber&quot;awareness&quot;type bracelet, punch holes in it with a single hole punch and use the same things for charms!

Too cute! Reply With Quote 04-17-2007,  05:31 AM #4 lezanac

 Making your own shoe charms, jibbitz for my purse charming
 There are sooo many things you can make shoe charms from. Use buttons, there are lots of fashion buttons, make them out of Fimo clay, and they sell the doodads to put in your shoes at Michael&apos;s craft store. They also sell charms two in a package for 1.99. We&apos;re crazy about the charms now that my daughter has the My Purse Charming purse. It is sooo cute. You can change the ribbon and the straps on the purse to match your outfits or holiday themes - it&apos;s adorable. My daughter loves to dress her purse up before she goes out! There is a site www.mypursecharming.com , and they have free shipping! I love to spread the word about cool things! Enjoy. Reply With Quote
