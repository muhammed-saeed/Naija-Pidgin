Starting a Pet Store Business


 Part of the business responsibilities of a pet store owner is to see to it that the animals in his or her store are humanely treated. Listed here are some suggestions to ensure that pet shop animals are properly cared for. 

A pet store can prove to be a lucrative business if managed properly.

 

It can also be a fun and fulfilling career especially for those who have an innate kinship with animals.

There is just something about pets that never fails to put a smile on our faces. Most of us regard our pets as a member of the family. We tend to dote on them as if they were our own children. And because of this, pet shops are in demand these days. Often, we browse through pet shops to splurge on treats and toys and other knick-knacks for our beloved companions.

A pet shop adheres to the principles of retail management. If you are planning to start your own pet shop then it is a must for you to learn and understand the basic concepts of retailing. You can find various sources of information for this subject. The internet alone has several websites catering to business management. You can also read books or instructional CDs. Look for something that help you learn how to create a business plan, launch your business, look for a location, set up your store and allocate space, establish your inventory, determine your pricing scheme, manage your finances, devise an operations plan, handle your manpower requirements and so on.

The pet shop owner has other responsibilities, among them are as follows: A pet shop owner should educate his or her customers on responsible ownership. A pet shop owner ensures that when buying a pet, his or her customers do so based on an informed decision. Most importantly, a pet shop owner knows the proper way to care for and handle enclosed animals. This is one aspect that sets a pet shop owner apart from other retailers. This responsibility should not be taken lightly. Ensuring the animals wellbeing should rank high in a pet shop owners list of priorities.

Your pet shop should maintain the following conditions to promote your animals wellbeing: Animal cages and fish tanks should be adequately spaced (at least one meter apart). This is to allow easy cleaning. Do not stack them for more than two levels per row and make sure that no food and waste fall to the cages or tanks underneath. Before selling an animal, give it the chance to rest for at least 72 hours. Dont keep incompatible animal breeds in one cage and make sure that cages of incompatible animal breeds are not placed in close proximity to one another. Facilitate toilet training by placing urine liners or newspapers in their cages. Feed your animals with the appropriate type and amount of food. Make certain they have access to clean drinking water at all times. Give your animals adequate time to exercise and have them interact with humans to keep them stimulated. The animal display area should have proper and sufficient ventilation to ensure that air is kept fresh and clean at all times. The cages should be made of sturdy corrosion-resistant, easy to clean, and non-toxic material, i.e. stainless steel or aluminum. The general area should be kept unsoiled and dry at all times. When appropriate, provide nest boxes, towels, and beddings, to ensure that your animals are comfortable. You should have a wash area on the premises.

 1. George on 3/25/2009 5:54:19 PM This give you no info on actually starting your store you should help more not just say how you need to take business classes... well pretty much every one knows that... 2. tandra maldidier on 4/15/2009 3:37:16 PM i agree with George, this page has absolutely no help on HOW to actually start up a pet store, and it should include web sites such as hagen or hertz and contain info on financial aspects involved. any further advice on HOW TO actually obtain the info i&apos;m searching for would be greatly appreciated. I did look up other biz ideas on this web site that i did find informative such as starting up a Pawn Store etc. thanks so much for your time and have a great day!! :) 3. Morgan on 7/8/2009 4:43:34 PM When you start your pet store, where can you buy the animals from to sell in your store? I&apos;m starting mine in a few years, so anyone who could help please reply or email me ASAP!!! 4. Liam on 10/13/2009 1:53:33 AM I am the CEO of several pet shops, and an expert breeder of rare and often very volatile animals. You can view my site on www.AussieTarantulas.com. if you have any questions or would like to purchase bulk animals for a petshop, email me on liam@aussietarantulas.com 5. hana on 11/14/2009 5:24:42 PM it explains a lot on how to take care of the animals, but not much of anything else. Though this will come in handy on how to take care of the animals in the pet shop. 6. Karen on 4/16/2010 2:00:43 PM Why everyone continues to waste their money and time on buying animals for their pet shops, most of which come from terrible places and lead sad lives, is beyond me. I teamed up with my local Humane Society and they bring in an &quot;adoptable pet of the week.&quot; It draws customers, I don&apos;t have any overhead, and it supports a fantastic cause. If people who own pet stores really care about animals, they wouldn&apos;t sell them. 7. dan on 4/25/2010 6:20:46 AM Karen, you are an idiot. This is about starting a pet store as a business. If you dont want to make money at selling pets then go volunteer at a shelter and don&apos;t try to sell pets. Yeah its just a great idea to get a 250000 dollar loan to start a business and then have your attitude of not selling the animals. 8. Nichelle on 6/3/2010 9:44:27 AM Dan, your an idiot. What kind a person wants to open a pet store while promoting inhumane puppymills. Why don&apos;t you do your research. 9. Carrie on 6/5/2010 11:05:31 PM Just because a pet store is selling animals does not mean they must have come from puppy mills and undesirable places. Many pet stores partner with local, reputable, and licensed breeders as well as animal shelters. Its not to say there aren&apos;t bad pet stores out there that do get their animals from puppy mills, but don&apos;t assume all pet stores are like that, because they&apos;re not. 10. Sendy on 6/13/2010 11:14:21 PM We manufacture and export dog clothes with good quality in

I came to this site because I hope to start my own pet store in a few years. My store will not carry dogs or cats for sale but instead we will go through a local shelter or rescue to adopt out cats, dogs, and many other types of animal. But we will carry animals bred by local breeders (as I want to stay away from the big breeders like Lasco and Sun Pets used by Petsmart. I work for a Petsmart and these animals sometimes are not very healthy) I want to support local animal breeders and rescue groups with my store. And I will also breed some of my own animals for my store. I really wish this site had more info about HOW to start up the store, the process of finding and securing a location for the store, and go into more depth than it did. I&apos;ll be doing more research as this is something I really want to get going on starting up. 15. Jessica on 1/1/2011 9:49:59 PM We are a small family owned pet store in Emmaus, Pa. We have been open for ten years. We care supplies, do grooming and very few animals. Most of our animals are dump offs. I like to say we have the unwantables. The truth is the owners of them were just stupid and didn&apos;t see the true love the pet had, but there loss is my gain. I provide the animals with love and care till I can find them a loving home to live out there life. The problem is our store is not doing well lately. I feel like we are falling apart and don&apos;t know why. Dog food is killing us, but I need it to keep customers coming back. What to do. I love what I do and don&apos;t want to do anything else, plus these animals would have nowhere to go if we were not there. Any advice would be great. 16. david on 1/3/2011 10:53:47 AM i&apos;m trying to open a pet shop any any information will helpful. i need products but dont know vendors names. my pet shop will have fish,reptiles,maybe birds,mice,hamsters,rabbits,etc. so i will need info or contacts numbers. pretty much all info and vendors to get it started. please help..thank you. 17. erin on 1/6/2011 11:12:39 AM I am opening a pet shop soon. I wondered if anyone had any contacts they could share with me. Vendors, etc. Where to buy my puppy supply? I am only going to be selling toy puppies and kittens, a long with pet supplies. any help would be appreciated! the shop will be in queensbury ny... 18. Samantha on 1/28/2011 3:44:57 PM It&apos;s not entirely the animals that are at fault. if there not properly taken care of OF COURSE they will get sick. I do a lot of work with the animal control and seeing the animals that come in and out is not for the weak hearted. Your job as a pet store owner is to make sure the animals are healthy, comfortable, clean. its about caring. not entirely about the income thats coming in. have a heart. 19. Aaron on 2/17/2011 2:47:47 PM Hello I am also interested in starting a pet store with many saltwater fish, reptiles, maybe birds, small animals like rats hampsters ext, and dogs, I need to get a hold of vendors to see what prices are going to be and how to actually start a pet store 20. gaurav on 2/18/2011 6:34:22 AM want to start a website for pet products. we are the experts.
mail me at : 05.gaurav@gmail.com 21. Ice on 3/23/2011 8:00:03 AM i m interesting in open out a pet shop, i need to know how much the cost for open out a pet shop? 22. James on 3/24/2011 8:28:15 AM 
@Ice, it depends where you want to open this shop. It also depends on your budget. A pet store can be started with as little as few thousand dollars to million dollars.

 23. charlen on 3/25/2011 12:02:15 AM i have one question.

I&apos;m rescuing pets from pounds and off the street and taking in or buying pets from people that cant keep their pets any more if its pure breed it will be $100 and up if its mixed it will be $50 and below because of how many mixed breeds and I am fixing all of the cats and dogs in my shop. cats are $20 for adults and $50 for kittens because of the price of vaccinations and fixings!!! now i&apos;m starting a great business I found a location in a neighborhood for $10,000!!! And my food supplies and every thing else I make from scratch as in dry food, canned food, treats, soaps,collars,leashes,litter,wood shavings, ect.!!! i&apos;m set and obviously not an idiot!!! 28. Rudzkie on 8/13/2011 7:23:50 PM i want to open a pet shop here in the philippines. is it possible for me to start in a small capital for home based shop? i love birds dogs cats&amp;fishes but i dont know how to start. any advise will be much appreciated! thanks in advance! 29. sena on 9/19/2011 1:34:11 AM Okay, I understand &quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;Dan&quot; opinions, but what if someone were to want to open a pet store that does NOT promote mills? Hmm? Like I do. I won&apos;t have cats and dogs, unless they are &quot;adoption&quot; pets with agreement between past owner or pound. Same goes with strays. Any animals people would otherwise dump on the streets I&apos;d take, and certain animals (like the lovely betta) I love to breed, so why not do that myself? That way I can even show &quot;these are the parents&quot; :) I agree with Mariah, who has the right idea. Rudzkie, find out how many pet stores there are. Check their prices, even ask a few questions (how much did they need to start their business). I&apos;m estimating for me, I would need 20,000.00 or more to start because of certain animals, plus the supplies to have :) 30. Lexi on 11/22/2011 6:12:58 PM Absolutely NO reputable breeder will work with a pet store to resell their puppies/kittens. Reputable breeders require applications and references of purchasers. Most importantly they keep track of health and well-being of their offspring to eliminate genetic issues such as hip dysplasia, seizures, autoimmune disorders, heart conditions, cancers and many more costly and heart breaking health issues. Selling large quantities through a pet store prohibits this monitoring process. Reputable breeders will only breed dogs 3 times maximum. Breeding should be done to better the breed, and not for resale purposes. Offering rescues or featuring shelter dogs is a great way to offer adoptable animals and draw customers into the store. As for actually running a store, this site offers no help. Offering supplies for pets is much more profitable then selling puppies and kittens. When you consider the costs of the proper care, feeding, and maintenance for puppies/kittens, your profits are quickly diminished. Perhaps partnering with a local rescue, shelter, and REPUTABLE breeder to promote your store would be a better route to take. 31. kiran lahiri on 5/3/2012 11:00:03 PM Hi I&apos;m Kiran Lahiri from gugaon.
