 Published: August 3, 2008 - 09:14 AM 
 | Updated: June 17, 2011 - 10:41 PM Tom and Sarah Sanderson of Akron are newlyweds wanting a financially sound plan to start married life. Their annual gross income is $85,000. (Mike Cardew/Akron Beacon Journal) View More Photos &gt;&gt; Aug. 3 Families tackle finances June 18,2011 02:41 AM GMT Betty Lin-Fisher Beacon Journal Publishing Co. Copyright � 2011 Beacon Journal Publishing Co. Inc and Black Press. All Rights Reserved. Any copying, redistribution or retransmission of any of the contents of this service without the express written consent of the Akron Beacon Journal is expressly prohibited. 
Today as part of ongoing coverage of consumer-debt issues, the Beacon Journal introduces five &apos;&apos;reader models,&apos;&apos; or participants who were chosen to get financial makeovers by money coaches with the Consumer Credit Counseling Service.

The models are all from middle-class families. They have individual financial challenges and concerns.

They haven&apos;t hit a financial brick wall, but acknowledge that they&apos;d like to veer their future in a different direction to avoid problems.

The models have already had their first session with their money coaches and will see them three times over six months.

Next month, you&apos;ll learn more about their stories, their financial challenges and the advice they&apos;re being given.

The newspaper chose models in a variety of financial situations in hopes that not only would they benefit from experts, but also that readers can apply the advice to their own lives and finances.

Stay tuned.
