It takes two sides to tango. Or maybe not. I love the Geico commerical with a man and woman

dancing to the tango with another man stuck in the middle,. And Boehner is stuck in the middle and in&apos;traffic in a manner of speaking. Whatever, it is Armaggedon. in Washington.

Who will step up to the plate?

The Daily Caller posted a video of Harry (this war is lost, I only mention it now when i want more money) Reid from 2006 on youtube. Search for &quot;Harry Reid in &apos;06: Raising debt limit last thing we should do, will weaken country, hurt economy&quot;
Did you notice how Brian challenged Boehner the other night and then said there looking like he was about the throw up waiting for Harry to get his lines out.

pure dog squeeze

This week Sen. Reid said in an interview with nbc that 50 percent of Americans pay no income tax. I want to know what people those are - rich, poor, children, elderly, tax attorneys, what? The only person I&apos;ve ever known that didn&apos;t pay income tax was my mother when she was quite elderly and living on social security. For decades of her working life, however, she paid income tax. But in her later years she didn&apos;t have any money to tax! So who is it that doesn&apos;t pay taxes?

Harry Reid&apos;s video comment of 2006 wow before the announced Recession

Senator Mitch McConnell view during this 2011 crisis

McConnell countered, in the interview conducted on Wednesday, with the fact the wealthy“do”indeed already pay more, explaining:“They pay an extraordinary amount more, and in fact about half of Americans don&apos;t pay any income taxes at all.

April 27, 2011

Eric Cantor says almost 50 percent of Americans don&apos;t pay income taxes

July 8, 2011

John Cornyn says 51 percent of American households pay no income tax

Well that clears up how the GOP feel about why the rich shouldn&apos;t pay anymore taxes and get those breaks. But if these guys had only said this off record it might have worked. But to go all the way back to Harry Reid&apos;s video in 2006 is just sad and desperate. Next we&apos;ll hear of a speak about debt that Obama gave in high school it could work.
 

 #5 - Fri Jul 29, 2011 4:22 PM EDT Dave, Tn-1853132 
Funny thing about the 46%-51% who don&apos;t pay any federal income taxes is that they have Bush Jr to thank for it. That&apos;s why I was in favor of letting them (now the Obama/democrat tax breaks) expire. From what I&apos;ve read it&apos;s some where between 260-320 billion per year from them AND 70 billion per year from those evil rich people who pay most of the freight in this country anyway.

HEY let&apos;s get those private jet owners tho, cut out that tax break Obama gave them in porkulus. That&apos;ll bring in another 2 billion in what 1 year or 10? I can&apos;t remember. We&apos;re so screwed

Tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush were followed by increases in the saving rate among the rich, according to data from Moody’s Analytics Inc.

Your right Dave it was Obama who gave those wealthy tax breaks back in 2001 and have continued to be extended. What&apos;s so interesting as Obama was elected as Senator in 2005 so he must have used that Harry Potter magic wand and you can bet people will believe it.

 

 #5.2 - Fri Jul 29, 2011 9:25 PM EDT Dave, Tn-1853132 
Making up stuff again Jackie? I said Obama and the dems didn&apos;t let them expire. I never said they created them in 2001 and 2003 although plenty of them voted for them. I&apos;m all for jacking the rich (who support the demoncrat party of class warfare), most of them are probably the same crony capitalist who got us into this. bahahahaha

How can Andrea Mitchell and Brian Williams continue this &quot;both sides are equal&quot; in obstructionist tactics. If I have heard it once I have heard it a hundred times and it is just not true. I guess it is too difficult for them to objectively identify the Rs as the party of No. Sad to see and will drive me to Scott Pelley on CBS.............

Never have I been more disgusted with our entire Congress. If this vote does not go through, rather than the military or Social Security recipients not getting paid, I believe we should suspend all Congressional salaries and benefits until the debt crisis is intelligently addressed. I also don&apos;t understand what is so terrible about a balanced budget. We can&apos;t run a business or a household without a balance budget. That&apos;s how we got into this recession in the first place. Every member of Congress should be voted out of office for this embarrassing display to politicking instead of being mindful of the issues of the American people. Shame, shame, shame on them.

Yet again, Brian Williams has assumed the role of corporate spokesman for McDonald&apos;s. On Tuesday, he took thirty seconds to eagerly bring us this piece of breaking news: &quot;McDonald&apos;s said today that it&apos;s taking steps to make Happy Meals healthier. The company is cutting the size of the french fry portion in half for starters and adding apple slices to every meal. The new meals will have about 20% fewer calories--coming in at under 600 calories total. First Lady Michelle Obama, who campaigns, of course, for better nutrition, put out a statement today calling this a good step.&quot; As Brian read this, the McDonald&apos;s logo was onscreen for the entire thirty seconds, along with the words &quot;Healthy Choices&quot; and a picture of a Happy Meal. This isn&apos;t a news story--it&apos;s a thirty second commercial for McDonald&apos;s. It&apos;s shameful that Brian will read any press release--seemingly verbatim--that is handed to him by the weasels at McDonald&apos;s. Of course, my favorite part was when Brian made a point of mentioning Michelle Obama. Clearly, Brian understood that her imprimatur would help legitimize the story. I also love how he claims that Happy Meals will become &quot;healthier&quot; instead of less unhealthy. More corporate-speak. But why would Brian read this press release from McDonald&apos;s? The answer is obvious. With the recent acquisition of NBC Universal by Comcast, the new Comcast/NBC Universal mega-conglomerate controls at least twenty national (or regional) networks and cable channels. In addition to NBC, MSNBC and CNBC, they own Bravo, Chiller, Oxygen, Sleuth, Syfy, Telemundo, Mun2, The Weather Channel, USA, E!, SportsNet New York, Exercise TV, G4, The Golf Channel, PBS Kids Sprout, The Style Network, Versus and New England Cable News. And those are only the ones I know about. I can only imagine how much money McDonald&apos;s spends each year advertising on all these Comcast/NBC stations. Is it $50 million? $60 million? $75 million? Who knows. Let&apos;s just say it&apos;s a lot. So with McDonald&apos;s spending all this money with Comcast/NBC, it makes perfect sense that Brian Williams would act as a spokesman for McDonald&apos;s. But of course, this isn&apos;t the first time that Brian and his Nightly News cohorts have acted as the McDonald&apos;s PR team. Here are some of the other commercials-as-news that Brian has read for McDonald&apos;s:

 5/18/11 --Brian personally defended McDonald&apos;s against criticism from parenting organizations and nutritional advocacy groups that accused McDonald&apos;s of unfairly using Ronald McDonald to attract children to their high sodium, high cholesterol, high fat food. In the story, Brian said that this criticism &quot;seems a little harsh&quot;. So much for anchor neutrality.
 5/9/11 --Brian took thirty seconds to tell us that McDonald&apos;s is spending more than $1 billion to upgrade their restaurants. &quot;Look for wooden tables, muted colors and faux leather seats coming soon to a Mac&apos;s near you. And you can get fries with that.&quot; Is it just me, or is that a commercial?
 3/8/11 --During a story promoting Subway Sandwich Shops (you didn&apos;t think McDonald&apos;s was the only fast food restaurant Brian promoted, did you?) as now having more U.S. outlets than McDonald&apos;s, Brian was quick to tell us that McDonald&apos;s still makes more money annually--$24 billion to $15 billion.
 12/7/10 --A story about how San Francisco is banning toys that come with children&apos;s fast food meals began with a cute segment about a woman who collects Happy Meal toys. The rest of this 2:30 &quot;news story&quot; (which was really just a commercial for McDonald&apos;s) contained clips of actual McDonald&apos;s commercials and non-stop footage of the McDonald&apos;s logo, restaurants and food.
 11/8/10 --The lead story on the CBS Evening News was a study released by the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy&amp;Obesity detailing the inappropriate ways that fast food chains market their unhealthy food to children. Nightly News did not report this story as a courtesy to their pals at McDonald&apos;s.
 9/3/10 --CBS Evening News reported that Consumer Reports rated 53 different fast food and chain restaurant hamburgers on taste and attractiveness, and McDonald&apos;s came in dead last. Needless to say, Nightly News did not report this story, either.
 7/2/10 --A Nightly News profile of LeBron James included clips from his McDonald&apos;s commercials.
 6/14/10 --Lester Holt gave us the important news that McDonald&apos;s will now be offering free Wi-Fi at their restaurants.
 2/4/10 --While reading a 25 second promotional piece about Heinz Ketchup&apos;s exciting new packaging, Brian also threw in a gratuitous plug for McDonald&apos;s.
 10/22/09 --During a piece about women in the workplace, Nightly News spent 75 seconds profiling Jan Fields, the Chief Operating Officer of McDonald&apos;s USA. The story gave her ample time to talk about things like McDonald&apos;s &quot;world famous fries&quot;. Ms. Fields is now the president of McDonald&apos;s USA--no doubt thanks in part to her ability to cajole NBC into allowing her to plug her fries.
 5/5/09 --In what may be the most shameless and blatant plug ever, Nightly News did a two-minute story whose sole purpose was to announce the launch of McDonald&apos;s new gourmet coffees to compete with Starbucks. Ann Curry called McDonald&apos;s coffee a &quot;delicious brew&quot;.

So it should come as no surprise that Brian Williams spent thirty seconds on Tuesday promoting McDonald&apos;s Happy Meals. After all, that&apos;s part of his job. But McDonald&apos;s isn&apos;t the only company he helps out. During Thursday&apos;s story about how Johnson&amp;Johnson is reducing their recommended dosage for Tylenol, Brian made sure to tell us that, &quot;There&apos;s a big change coming to Tylenol. As you may know too much of it can damage the liver and it&apos;s often easy to get too much of it....&quot; Now, why would Brian need to tell us that Tylenol can cause liver disease? Because Tylenol is a competitor of Bayer products, and Bayer is one of Nightly News&apos;s biggest advertisers. In the twelve minutes following the Tylenol story, Nightly News aired commercials for four different Bayer products (One A Day vitamins, Aleve, Phillips Caplets and Citracal.) Products like Bayer Aspirin and Aleve (naproxen) are direct competitors of Tylenol, so by telling us how harmful Tylenol can be, Brian was doing a favor for his friends at Bayer. And this isn&apos;t the first time Brian and his producers have helped out Bayer.

 12/20/10 --Robert Bazell (who promotes NBC sponsors as enthusiastically as Brian) did a 2:15 &quot;news story&quot; debunking the herbal supplement Echinacea as a cure for the common cold. Six minutes after that story, we saw a commercial for Alka-Seltzer Plus cold medicine--manufactured by Bayer. Clearly, the point of Bazell&apos;s story was to discourage people from using Echinacea so they would buy Alka-Seltzer Plus.
 12/6/10 --Bazell did a story purportedly about the benefits of aspirin, but it was really little more than a 2:15 commercial for Bayer. The &quot;news report&quot; began with a five second clip from a Bayer commercial. Then there were three close-ups of Bayer aspirin: A box on a shelf in a Walgreens, a pill in someone&apos;s palm and a bottle of Bayer. No other name brand was shown in the story. Even an animated graphic of a bottle simply labeled &quot;aspirin&quot; was brown and yellow--easily recognizable as Bayer&apos;s traditional colors on their aspirin bottles (and the main colors on their website). This is beyond blatant. This is brazen, appalling and deceitful. Bazell is supposed to be reporting on matters of health and science, not endorsing a particular product. Believe it or not, some people actually rely on the evening news for information about health matters. But on Nightly News they don&apos;t get unbiased information, they get contrived &quot;news reports&quot; specifically desi

(continued)

But on Nightly News they don&apos;t get unbiased information, they get contrived &quot;news reports&quot; specifically designed to promote NBC&apos;s best advertisers.
 6/8/10 --Bazell reported a story about an obscure Danish medical study that concluded that naproxen (sold as Aleve) may reduce the risk of heart attacks among its users. The study also showed that ibuprofen and Celebrex increased the risk of heart attacks. This was just a 2:30 commercial for Aleve. It&apos;s obvious that Bazell and his producers chose to air this story as a favor to their pals at Bayer. I can guarantee that this story would never have run if it contained any negative information about Aleve.

Of course, it&apos;s not just McDonald&apos;s and Bayer. Brian and his producers will use Nightly News to promote virtually any of their regular sponsors. Other past examples have included Chevy, Chrysler, Cheerios, Walmart, Kraft, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Frito-Lay, Microsoft, Boniva, United Airlines, Pringles, Starbucks and Smith&amp;Nephew joint replacements. Using a news broadcast to promote advertisers (and also protect them from negative publicity) is shameful and unethical. But obviously, Brian doesn&apos;t care.

If the Senate passed a non=binding &quot;sense of the Senate&quot; resolution recognizing President Obama&apos;s

authority under the 14th Amendment to raise the debt ceiling to the extent to prevent default,

then the president would not be impeached for abusing his authority and the Senate would not, in

effect, be abolished for screwing the people. Phyllis Kunz
 

 #7 - Sat Jul 30, 2011 10:11 AM EDT Dave, Tn-1853132 
He could be impeached by the congress and I think they&apos;d do it but he wouldn&apos;t be convicted by this worthless Senate. Doesn&apos;t really matter because they aren&apos;t talking about cutting anything. They&apos;re talking about how much debt we&apos;ll have in 10 years. 19 trillion to 24-25 trillion. We&apos;ll never get out from under so that leads me to believe they aren&apos;t serious and they&apos;re just going to keep raping the public until it goes kaboom. Then you won&apos;t be able to find your Harry Pelosi any where.

Well, that would NOT be peachy if the president was impeached what with everything in a mess

now in our country and world - wide as well. Time is money! And the clock is ticking.

Perhaps, the bully pulpit is a viable option again. He used it to good effect when he took it

to the people with &quot;Put the pressure on lawmakers if you want to see a bipartisan

compromise.&quot; which got results in Louisville Kentucky with a protest. Phyllis PS I had Ranch

Aug 2 is a BS date. Our credit rating is more likely to go down (it&apos;s going to happen anyway so get ready) if he gets 2 more trillion to rack up.


&quot;if you want to see a bipartisan compromise.&quot; which got results&quot;

Really? Pelosi &quot;twitted&quot; that it wasn&apos;t and &quot;this war is lost&quot; Harry shelved it right away. Besides I heard the calls for stop the madness way out numbered the give Obama want he wants calls ehehehe I&apos;m listening to Mark Levin&apos;s podcast right now from 7-26. He&apos;s cracking me up playing Pelosi&apos;s stuttering sputtering babble about Republicans wanting to destroy clean air, clean water whatever. Man he&apos;s one funny angry right wing Jew. His New York accent doesn&apos;t even bother me anymore. LMAO He was great when these liars in Manhattanstan were twisting the truth about Reagan&apos;s tax hikes.

Oh you mentioned Beck&apos;s Overton Window the other day. Did you ever hear the ad for the book? Spooky voice reading the last few lines from &quot;The Gods of the Copybook Headings&quot; by Kipling?

I&apos;d like to have the audio book in that voice 0)

 

 #7.3 - Sat Jul 30, 2011 2:39 PM EDT Phyllis Kunz 
Beck&apos;s book is compared to a Hitchcockian thriller which, in my opinion, is the highest praise,

so I may still buy a copy. Of interest, perhaps, I did buy &quot;THe First Immortal&quot; byJames L. Halperin.

I&apos;ll have to check out the Kipling quote.

There shouldn&apos;t be any doubt in our military people&apos;s minds on whether or not their pay is going to be jammed up due to this. I know there was a bill in the Senate sponsored by Sen. Toomey&amp;31 other senators to make sure it wouldn&apos;t happen. It probably got squashed Hopefully this is just more skull Effing from our good friends in the ministry of truth.

I watched the program tonight on &quot;Taking the Hill&quot; and came away with one thought. I guess I am a slow learner, but it finally dawned on me after seventy two years in this country, notice I did not say great country, because that stopped almost three years ago. My thought was that NO one in the Government or the media really gives a hooters damn about the American people anymore. All they care about is getting the job (reelected) back. I have tried my own way of term limits. I have never voted for anyone going for more than two terms and I do not care what they have done. I think the framers wanted folks to go to the seat of government, do what the can, and return to the real world to see what effect what they did had on folks.

Why are you letting McConnell and Cornyn perpetuate this lie about the &quot;50% of American&apos;d don&apos;t pay taxes? And why isn&apos;t the media - including Brian Phillips - challenging them on this???

Why isn&apos;t anybody thinking – really thinking – about that statement, since you can do the math in about 45 seconds. Acording to census.gov (), there are slightly more than 300 million residents. Half of that is obviously about 150 million.

Approximately 75 million Americans are under 18 (24.3%). Nope, not too many 5-year-olds paying taxes in that group.

App. 40 million are over 65 (12.9%). Does your 80-year-old granny pay income tax?

Another 18 million are in college ( – note this is a 2007 number). Not a lot of income tax potential there, either.

And, According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics:

Approximately 14 million are unemployed. Nope, no taxes being paid. I can&apos;t find a figure for how many are underemployed and therefore aren&apos;t paying taxes on $8 an hour jobs.

So, guess what? That adds up to 147 million Americans.

Is this another example of certain political types playing us for fools, and us going along with it? Or is McConnell and his ilk the fools for perpetuating such an obvious lie?

Because it&apos;s not a lie and they&apos;d rather avoid it because it hurts&quot;the party&quot; The way they work is they might let it on air once but then they&apos;ll allow some deomcrat to lie unchallenged a couple hundred times.

“Let’s talk about federal tax reform. There has been a lot of discussion about that, where we want to take the tax code with all of its multiple provisions and get it on the table and take a look at it to make sure it is, in my view, flatter, fairer and simpler,”Cornyn said.“But right now, the fact (is) that according to the Committee on Joint Taxation, 51 percent—that is, a majority of American households—paid no income tax in 2009. Zero. Zip. Nada.…Actually, to show how out of whack things have gotten, 30 percent of American households actually made money from the tax system by way of refundable tax credits—the Earned Income Tax Credit, among others. So 51 percent of American households paid no income tax in 2009, but 30 percent actually made money under the current system.” According to PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter, the statement is true. 
 

 #8.1 - Sat Jul 30, 2011 2:21 PM EDT Co Historian 
You just quoted even more fodder for the lie - the Earned Income Tax Credit is for those who are below the poverty line for their family (deductible) status. &quot;...30% actually made money...&quot; is not a support for this, since minimum wage is still &quot;making money.&quot;

Here&apos;s Politifact&apos;s link, I&apos;ll provide it, you didn&apos;t:

politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/08/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-51-percent-american-households-pa/

And, they&apos;re talking about American Households, NOT American&apos;s as McConnell will do tomorrow night in Phillips&apos; big interview. Big difference

If. Mitch McConnell&apos;s back-up plan does not get the green light, then Harry Reid must think up a

seduction plan, not Mitch seducing Nancy Pelosi and not anything like that, but with the face off and

confrontation between Boehner and the president, Reid should use his mascaline wiles to insure

a bill passes to prevent default. I am sure he can charm the birds out of a tree, birds of a feather

thinking maybe i should so some peach liqueur, cubed fresh peaches, LOTS of sugar, brandy, vodka, mason jars, time and a dark pantry. it lasts me for forever because i use only use it during flu season with green tea as a hot toddy. it does the trick even for something like h1n1. going to put up at least 2 1-quart freezer bags of peaches tonight with fruit fresh. future peach smoothies. i should run some over to my sister and her girls for peach cobblers when i get more put up. there&apos;s more peaches up on the roof on the trees in the backyard. have to get brave to get up there on the ladder when they&apos;re ripe. yep, i&apos;m afraid of heights! the budget will be tight if nothing happens on the hill, but i should probably spring for that brandy and vodka. wonder if that hot toddy would work for bronchitis and pneumonia in the nursing homes. doing sautees for burritos with the meat in my freezer, a little bit of slice beef or chicken with 3 fried potatoes, a large red bell pepper, a ton of crushed garlic, a large onion, olive oil and chopped cilantro added at the very last. have to stretch out my meat! great burrito with melted jack cheese! that makes 6 burritos with about 1/2 lb. of meat or less:-) that with sweetened tea, 1 skin detox (yogi), 1 chamomile and 2 green tea bags brewed in 2 c. of water blended with 2 c. of cranberry/raspberry juice and a squeezed slice of lemon on ice. i bet i could swing some votes, any takers on the hill? off to put up peaches. best, anna martina

The 14th Amendment says plainly that the legitimate debts of the U.S. must be paid period. It does

NOT require tax increases or tax cuts. It just says that whatever Congress (and usually the President)

have obligated the Government to pay MUST be paid. No ifs, ands or buts.. Then, jobs MUSt be

created. They have their work cut out for them.

As Brian Williams said recently on his broadcast: If you can&apos;t make a payment on your credit card,

pay the interest. So logic dictates, there will only be a default if Pres. Obama chooses not to

pay the interest on the debt. No need to default Phyllis Kunz

President Obama said that Social Security Checks may not be in the mail but that seniors would

receive IOUs. Well, I suppose borrowing money from the American people would be one solution

for the banks, including the Federal Reserve, but only with interest. Still, I don&apos;t think it would

fly because there are so many totally dependent on the checks and they would be screwed.

And how could Pres. Obama even consider withholding checks from the Military. What is he thinking?

Or is it the big idea from a staff member
