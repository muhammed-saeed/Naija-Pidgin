Surprised that this place isn&apos;t ranked better. I popped off of Fairfax today in a blitz, running so late to my appointment down the street.

I was the first car in line, I placed my order one time, didn&apos;t have to repeat it... was asked to confirm on the screen. Yup, that&apos;s it. Pulled around, paid. The cute Latino boy (bonus point) in the window was fast, efficient, got my order right. Sandwich and fried both hot. Soda cold. Accurate change. Hauled ass out of there moments later.

Made it to my appointment, no longer starving, with a minute to spare. What else can you say good about a fast food restaurant? It worked like it was supposed to. Now I have to do crunches tonight.

I don&apos;t really eat Jack in the Box that often so I&apos;m not too familiar with their food.  I had to get lunch for my 4 yr old and this was the only &quot;fast food&quot; that was on the way and so I decided to drive thru.  Got the chicken strips from the kids menu and it was pretty spicy for my son.  He was just like...&quot;SPICY!!!&quot;  while downing his milk.  So he pretty much just ate the fries and I ate the chicken strips, which sucked cuz I&apos;m on a diet and those chicken strips pretty much killed it for the day.  I&apos;m just thinking that they should maybe put mildly tasting crispy chicken strips that&apos;s more suitable for a kid on their kids menu.  Just sayin.

We were looking for breakfast around 7 AM and ended up here. Sadly, all the other places on the block were closed, even one with hours posted on their door stating otherwise!

This was my first Jack in the Box experience. They serve breakfast all day, so I got a sausage and egg sandwich, which tasted fine: nothing amazing, a bit processed, but warm, able to keep my hunger pangs at bay. It was a surreal eating breakfast to Eurythmics&apos;s &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, but I had good company (thanks for paying!).

The cashier who helped us offered dessert after we placed our order. Not sure if that&apos;s part of their customer service script, but I found that amusing.

Just a warning to double-check your Drive Thru order....On many occasions they&apos;ve left something out, or messed up the order entirely...After many experiences like this, I figured it was time to review it here...

i love Jack in the Box (so much so that friends have gotten me gift certificates from there as presents) but this was sooooo disappointing.

i typically order the sourdough jack (the beef and bacon = heart attack combo is hard to beat) with extra mayo so when you bite into the crunchy grilled bread you get hot googy tart and tangy bite of everything (i know - this is staring to sound pornographic - i&apos;ll tone it down). here though, it&apos;s as if they ran out of meat and used a brown dried scouring pad, sandwiched in with old cheese and stale mayo (if such a thing exists) with slightly toasted Styrofoam to come up with this once beloved drunken treat...

which begs the question... &quot;Was I just imagining this juicy deliciousness or was it the booze?&quot;  I mean, I&apos;ve had fantastic sushi and sake only to stumble over the Jack&apos;s 10 mins later to put down a sourdough jack?  It must be more than the booze right?

This place is right down the street from where I live. Whenever I am feeling lazy, I&apos;ll hike down here for a quick meal. The service is always friendly and fast.

I love their regular chicken sandwich for a buck.  I get one every week.  Most of their other menu items are a bit pricey but then who cares?

Very friendly and efficient. This is a good place to stop by when you are at Museum Row or Beverly Hills and need a quick bite on the way home.
