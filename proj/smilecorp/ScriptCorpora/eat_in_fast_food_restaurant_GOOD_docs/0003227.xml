 Answer: While there are many simple ones they can vary depending on if you are going through drive-thru or coming inside. If you do go inside, the main policies are to always greet the customer in a timely manner. Take the order, repeat it back to them, suggestive sell if possible, and have the order packed or pack it yourself. Always thank them and wish them a great day. If going through drive-thru the process is a little more complicated. You must greet the customer within 5 seconds of the customer reaching the intercom, take the order, repeat it back, suggestive sell, thank them ask them to pull forward. You must answer the window with a Hi, tell them the total due, cash it out, give the change due with food and thank them again, wishing them a great night.
