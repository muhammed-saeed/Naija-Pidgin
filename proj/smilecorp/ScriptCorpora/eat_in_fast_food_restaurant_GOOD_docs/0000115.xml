Am wondering if I&apos;m normal or in need of anger management!!
My coming up to 3 yo dd is so demanding, I seem to spend 3 parts of my day bawling her out or saying no - it&apos;s so demorilising - I&apos;m sure for her too, although I know I have to set boundaraies, don&apos;t I?

Her speech and awareness of what&apos;s going on around her is, imo sometimes gobsmacking for her age. She knows exactly what she wants, can ask (demand) for it very articulately and comes out with expressions that very often floor me! She seems to know too much at a young age. But as she is so young, she is obviously so very immature in many other ways and always wants to run before she can walk (&quot;I do it&quot;is her favourite expression) and when i say no, because imo what she is asking for she can&apos;t do or it is dangerous to have etc, she goes off on one. She also takes forever to do what I ask - all in all, she can be SOOOO frustrating - but at the same time, adorable and I lurve her to bits!

However, as I said all this continual conflict of interest is wearing me down as I am constantly saying no and shouting to the point where she will say&apos;don&apos;t shout at me&apos;before bursting into tears or she will panic if she knows or thinks she&apos;s done something wrong as she will say&quot;sorry, sorry, sorry&quot;over and over and looks genuinely scared I&apos;m going to tear her off a strip .

Feel really bad this morning as we were late getting to nursery and she suddenly decided just as we were going out the door that she needed the potty. I was not best pleased as she has used the potty as an excuse lately to keep getting out of bed or stall bedtime...she sits there for ages insisting she needs to go and nothing happens, so assumed she was playing this game again. This happened last night at 3 in the morning (the sides have just come off her cot, and I think she thinks this is a great excuse for disturbing the household in the middle of the night now that she can get out and tell us she needs a wee)...so this morning I bawled her out for needing the potty (frazzled on the back of a bad night, maybe) and felt awful as she then proceeded to do a big wee...told me to say sorry for shouting at her...and told me how much she loves me ..so have been feeling guilty and crap mum all morning.

Just a bit of a rant really, but make me feel better by telling me I&apos;m not unusual to shout - I hate shouting and am fed up of spending a large part of my day bawling and getting wound up. Am I alone in this?
Thanks for reading, sorry so long, just needed to vent. x.

My DD (5) has been very demanding from the age of about 3 and I often end up feeling really guilty for shouting so much and being quite horrible. The other day she looked at me with an expression that seemed to say&quot;You are horrible and you don&apos;t like me do you&quot;and I felt horribly guilty for 2 days after. I realised that normally she just&apos;takes it&apos;from me. I get so wound up by her constant demands that I end up not wanting to do anything for her and saying no to everything and telling her to leave me alone. I feel she is in my face all the time and taking over my life. I forget she is a child and shout at her like she is an adult.

I&apos;m reading Raising Your Spirited Child at the moment and finding it quite useful as it gets you to think about your child&apos;s spirit in positive ways instead of how hard it makes your life.

I try to say, when I have done x I will do something for you, then when I&apos;ve done it I ask her if there was something she wanted. Sometimes I don&apos;t have the calmness to make myself do this though.

Hi my 2.5YO DS is exactly the same.

Don&apos;t worry about it you do have boundaries of course, is there any way you could just go into another room or something wehen she does this? I have to do this sometimes just to clear my head because it&apos;s not right for either of us for me to end up a jittering wreck wanting to shout my head off. It doesn&apos;t work this I have now figured out.

She sounds normal and I think you should try to ease up on her. I DO IT is normal for this age and so is crying when they can&apos;t do it, distraction still works though I bet.

And does it really matter if you&apos;re late for nursery? So if she does want the potty can&apos;t you let her?

I think you need to take a step back. Three year olds can be immensely draining - just decide that, until you drop her at nursery, you are going to be Mary Poppins.

My 2.2 year old is also very demanding and difficult. But I don&apos;t shout at him because my parents used to shout at me and my sisters constantly and it was horrible. I don&apos;t think it achieved anything - they didn&apos;t get us to do what they wanted by shouting so I think it was very ineffective parenting. It just made us all miserable and anxious.

What I have tried to do is to work out what makes me particularly stressed and then try to defuse it. The worst points of day for me are trying to clean up the kitchen in the morning and get out the house and making dinner in the evening while ds is demanding that I go and play trains or shoving me around the kitchen. So I now arrange the morning and evening so he watches some tv at those times. I would prefer he played rather than watching tv, but at least this way we are both happy with each other and we actually get more good time together than if it took me hours to get everything done while he whinged.

If he is doing something dangerous, or if he won&apos;t go where he has to go or leave when we have to I give him a warning, ask him nicely to go and if that doesn&apos;t work I pick him up and carry him away. I can&apos;t see that shouting does any good in this kind of situation. He might get upset at being carried away but it is very short lived and I try to apologise and explain why I had to take him.

Sorry, this probably doesn&apos;t help and sounds rather smug. I worry about my parenting all the time too, but the one thing I have managed to avoid so far is shouting...

ActingNormal - so emapthise with you over the taking over life point and not wanting to do anything for them as you have just had enough - i too have told dd to go away so many times and have felt awful for saying so. The book sounds interesting - thanks, will give it a go.

I wish I had time to control my outbursts - they just seem to happen and I just explode. Maybe i need to take the time out to count to 10 or scream into the fridge the minute I start to get a bit annoyed, to try and avoid the full blown explosion.

WickedWitch - you are right, I do need to ease up on her, but it&apos;s hard to know what fights to pick when 3 parts of the day she seems to be doing the opposite of what I want

Tryingtoleave - I take your points on board. Am encouraged that dispite being shouted at yourself, you are so anti-shouting...another of my worries is that dd will turn into a shouter too, hopefully that won&apos;t happen - especially if i try and calm down a bit myself now.

Thanks for all your advice. x.

My 3 yo is exactly the same my glimmer of hope is that her brother was just as exhausting (if not worse) at this age and is now very easy to live with (nothing to do with me, he just grew out of it).

My tips:
Pick you battles (and ignore the rest).
Look hard for the good things and make the most of them.
Try and spend some time one to one playing together (let her boss you around as much as she likes)!
Make time for yourself!!

My ds has just gone 1 but is both a good walker and highly spirited which is a pretty testing combo at times. I rarely shout but I did yesterday - twice and I felt like shit about it. Still do actually. He is going through a very whiney phase and after a full day of it with minimal naps and crap weather which stopped the usual play in the park I just roared at him when he started to go for the bin/cat food/stereo etc.

I don&apos;t want to go down that road because I got screamed at all the time, and most of the time I can control it but yesterday was a bad day.

Balanomorey, my niece is very precocious like you describe of your dd. Her parents can get very sharp with her very quickly - which surprised me at the time because though my dd was around the same age and equally demanding, dd was less developmentally precocious and more babyish in her demands, which did not push the same buttons.

Now that dd is older and has more sophisticated language at her disposal plus my expectation that she should know better (as compared with ds 2), my fuse IS shorter. I know now why my SIL used to blow up and was harsh with her dd.

Just sympathising. I am also trying to be a better parent.

I have 2 very demanding little boys, they are 4 and 2.

My 2 yr old is a real handfull and is incredably violent which we are seing a child psycologist for as i have had a few suspicious dr&apos;s look at my eldest ds and question me about his cuts and bruises that ds1 has done.

I have a short fuse and used to find myself constantly screaming at them and like you i knew it was neither fair or getting me anywhere.

I use time out for my 2 and they go ino thier bedroom when they have been naughty, i shut the door so i can&apos;t see them and although it seems to have taught them sweet fa since they just come out of time out and repeat the offence but ut gives me a few precious moments to calm down.

My eldest is a challenge becuase he is so clingy and sensitive and cries at everything, i cant blame him really he has cf and has been through alot of trauma the last few years but its still very frustrating and tireing when i literally can&apos;t go to the toilet without him screaming th place down.

So i do know how you feel so im going to give you a virtual hug.

My DD (3) has been exasperating me so much recently I have almost started a thread like this several times.
She has been very easy up until the last month or so. She can start school nursery in January and I was feeling it was too soon, but perhaps she is ready for it.
Like your DD she has been confrontational and always says&apos;no&apos;to me, even when it is something she likes doing.

What does your DD enjoy doing? Perhaps if you decide you will give her 15 minutes undivided attention a couple of times a day this will help to prevent a negative spiral developing.

The advice about getting time for yourself is good. It is always easier to give more to your DC if you feel some of your own needs are being met.

Oh dear, am ashamed to say since my last post, things have gone from bad to much worse and am ashamed to say have just had the biggest ding-dong ever 
Just picked dd up from nursery and dropped into the garage to get petrol. She asked for choc and chose some minty aero bubbles which i said she could have. We were next in the queue and the man had scanned the aero when she gave me a kinder egg and said she wanted that instead. I explained we had already paid for the areo, so noshe couldn&apos;t have it and to put it back.Then she proceeded to tantrum and hit me repeatedly on the bum. All flustered, I managed to pay and drag her out the shop. Told her she had been naughty to hit me and told her i was going to put her choc in the bin at the garage which i did and when she got home she would be on the naughty spot.
When we got home, she kept getting off naughty spot, told her to stay or not go to ducks as promised - kept getting off. By this time I am seething.... ...ashamed to say I went nuts. Slammed doors several times, ranted, pushed a chair across the kitchen, threw my purse, car keys, house keys...god knows what neighbours must be thinking. Am SO ashamed I couldn&apos;t keep a lid on it. All the while I was going mad,..she was, of course so upset and frightened...what sort of mum must I be to do that to her. After I&apos;d calmed down I was cuddling her and she said she was never going to make me cross again and was also saying how much she loved me from the mat while I was stropping....God, I&apos;ve never felt so awful in my life..I could have damaged her for life, although she&apos;s running round now like it never happened. Oh God, I feel so bad.

ahh sit down and take a deep breath, you are not a bad mother or else you wouldnt be so upset about what just happened.

i have lost my temper a few times because of my dd&apos;d demanding behavior, we all do, and i most definately do alot of shouting.

there was a anger management lady on the radio yesterday and she had a good few points.
dont get me wrong, i am not judging you, cause i am exactly the same, but what she said has helped me aviod arguments, with both my mum and dd.

she said when you can feel yourself getting angry, just take a step back, will getting angry achive anything or make matters worse.
look at the long term, getting angry will not help and just stepping back from what you are doing csn help calm things down.

now i am one of the worst people to mamage my anger, uauslly i just scream at the nearest person, but hopefully, i am going to keep trying this step back thing and think about what i am doing.

Balano, don&apos;t beat yourself up. I have been where you are many times. It&apos;s usually when I am very stressed, feel backed into corner with nowhere to run.
You haven&apos;t damaged her for life. You have shown her that you are human and can only be pushed so far before you get tired of her difficult behaviour.
I think you were right to throw the sweets away, but probably should not have carried it on went you got home.
I would now have a cup of tea, put the television on for DD. When you are feeling calm, apologise for getting so cross, cuddle her and read a story etc.
To prevent further episodes follow the advice given by posters.
Don&apos;t worry though

Sympathies. I&apos;ve been like this with my ds1 (3.5 and also very demanding) recently, we&apos;ve been having similar battles. I decided I needed to burn my steam off somewhere else because if I deal with him calmly I get much better results. Went out for a run. Seems to have helped.
 Add message | Report | Message poster Othersideofthechannel Wed 24-Sep-08 16:11:41 
Don&apos;t beat yourself up too much. She is only two and if this kind of tantrum from you is an isolated incident, she probably won&apos;t remember it.

But I do think that you need to work on your anger management. How can she learn not to tantrum if you don&apos;t set her the example?

Perhaps lowering your expectations of her would help? DD is coming up to 4 so a year older but I wouldn&apos;t expect her to understand about the hassle it causes other people to change your mind after the item has been scanned. Things like this need explaining in advance&quot;once we start queueing at the till, we can&apos;t change our minds&quot;and if something unforeseen happens, you have to accept that the childs anger is normal.

I don&apos;t think it is fair to punish a frustrated child of this age by throwing away the chocolate. Learning that it is the original choice or nothing is enough.

Thanks for all your positive support - not that you wish others in the same boat as you, but it is comforting to know I am not alone in this and others have had similar feelings and outbursts. Posted my last point very sheepishly and felt I was deserving of some slating - thanks for not making me out to be too bad!

Makes me feel a bit more human and that maybe I can forgive myself - I guess I&apos;ll have to for dd&apos;s sake - she seems to have forgiven me!

Have just been to feed the ducks as we both needed to get out and blow away the cobwebs and feel better for the fresh air.

Tomorrow&apos;s another day and I know I have to curb my frustrations. Not an excuse, but haven&apos;t been in the best of health lately with creeky knees and back and bending down to put dd back onto the naughty spot for the umpteenth time made my knees go again - that certainly didn&apos;t help an already bad situation. Though that&apos;s not dd&apos;s fault and I shouldn&apos;t take it out on her ....Roll on tomorrow!!! Thanks again for listening. x

Agree with otherside that your expectations are the problem here.

She is acting completely normally.

I&apos;m afraid to say you are the one with the problem. Agree with otherside that you tantrumming will not help her one bit.

A child DOES take over your life completely. Your day WILL be spent doing stuff with them/for them. She will change her mind on stuff, she will want her independence etc etc etc, she will be illogical and want the impossible! I know it&apos;s hard, they can drive you demented; the key is how you deal with it.

With the chocolate incident yes she needs to learn that you don&apos;t hit people but throwing it away AND sticking her on the naughty step at home is just over the top IMO.

I think by completely changing your expectations, it would help you to keep calm. You really do need to be calmer. I&apos;m not usually so direct with people but you need to change the way you are behaving to your child. In my opinion having you fly off the handle and effectively tantrum about things, will contribute to her feeling insecure. She needs security to develop to her full potential, to be the best most confident, self assured little girl she can be.

i love with my parents and i find it quite hard to cpe when they go away on holiday.

i make an extra special effort to be calmer and nicer to dd.

it does work wonders, the more i shout at dd, the more she shouts back and learns to shout more.

we have alot less tantrums if i take a nicer approach.

You&apos;ve have loads of great advice so I won&apos;t repeat.
Sympathies though as it seems that you must be stressed out to be taking it out on her.

Today, in a long queue, I had to jsut stand there and count to about 25 to calm myself and then him: my ds drives me nuts. A lovely lady helped me while others were getting v. impatient!!!!

Otherside&amp;Honoria - I think you both have hit the nail on the head. I do have high expectations and because she is so forward for her age, I am losing sight of the fact that she isn&apos;t even quite 3 yet.

Not going to bore you all with the history, but have been thro some shitty times that have left a mark and my mantra now is&apos;i want an eay life&apos;and at the moment I&apos;m not getting it. All this is borne from frustration because that need isn&apos;t being met....I know I am being unreasonable, but it gets to me some days how hard it is (&amp;I know I am one of many, but it&apos;s how you feel yourself, isn&apos;t it?). Juggling this with having the bones of what feels like a 90 yr old some days makes life a drag.(Sorry, don&apos;t want to sound all poor me, know there are many more deserving hard luck stories, but good to vent).

Having said that, please believe me I am taking on board all the advice here, I never want a day like today again, and dd&apos;s development and security are of utmost importance, so I must ease off and remember she is still so little.

God, it&apos;s a hard job, isn&apos;t it and it grinds you down when you feel so crap at it all the time 

Thanks to all for posting. x.

that makes you feel worse doesnt it when people are tutting and sighing.

every wednesday we go to a coffee shop and 9 times out of 10 there is a old lady in there. now sometimes my dd is a little loud and once had a full blown tantrum in front of this woman, she just sat there staring and shaking her head.

if i was more confrontational i would have said something, but i just tried to stop dd getting any worse. there was nothing more i could do.

but even if dd is just playing or talking, she looks over like she has a bad smell under her nose.

Maybe you should change your mantra to&quot;I love my daughter&quot;or&quot;I have a happy life.&quot;Whatever you repeat over and over, you&apos;ll end up believing. It&apos;s how the mind works.

I totally, totally sympathise. I realy considered a course in anger management a couple of months ago as my daughter (nearly two) began to get stroppy and impossible.

I don&apos;t have the time or money for an anger management course, so I just pretend to be a chilled-out person instead, and I do what a chilled-out person would do, and the more I pretend, the more I become it.

Balanomorey, I totally sympathise, my 2 year old is a whingeing demanding sod most of the time. The few times he is in a good mood he is a littler charmer. But if we have a run of whingey, whiney, difficult behaviour, I find my patience wearing thin.

I agree totally with the posts from people like HonoriaGlossop. If you can change your own behaviour and expectations, I think you will begin to see improvements in DD&apos;s behaviour, which will stop things escalating to the point where you are ranting and raving and losing it.

It&apos;s good that you posted about your experience with the chocolate as people have been able to advise you what they might have done differently to avoid the the end situation you describe of everybody being unhappy. What I would have done was to expect a change of mind over choice of choc (totally normal at that age) and be prepared in your mind as to how you are going to deal with it. Does distraction technique work with her? ie. as soon as she says she wants the kinder egg instead, you say&quot;No, the aero has already been put through the till so we have to have that, oh look have you seen that squirrel on the wall over there?&quot;, all the while getting out of the shop and away from the point of contention.

I would also definitely not have put the choc in the bin straight away unless you&apos;d specifically warned her calmly, loudly and clearly, bending down at her level(so that she could hear through her screaming) that if she doesn&apos;t stop crying/whinging you will put it in the bin. If she understands that and carries on, put it in the bin. She will learn that tantrumming loses her nice things. If she stops, she gets the choc and she has learnt that it is better to behave well as she gets a good result from that. With my DS, no matter how bad his tantrum, as soon as he stops the whingeing and behaves well again, I praise him for calming down and behaving nicely, and usually we have a quick hug. I have noticed his bad behaviour escalates the more I lose control myself by shouting at him, so I have learnt to appear calm to him even if I&apos;m going nuts with anger inside! (a bit like what whoopee does in her post).

Sorry to sound more negative towards how you handled it (not really intending it to be, it&apos;s supposed to be constructive criticism LOL, just letting you know what seems to work in our house), but I would definitely not have done the naughty step either. It is physically far away from where the choc tantrum episode took place, and I think that at this age they are just too young to connect the naughty step at home with an incident that happeend out of the house earlier. If you are going to use the naughty step, use it only for bad behaviour at home, so that they go straihgt on the naughty step immediately after the episode of bad behaviour. There can&apos;t be a time gap.

Someone else pointed out that she&apos;d also been punished twice, and it&apos;s true - she&apos;d had her choc thrown in the bin, AND she&apos;d been put on the naughty step. If I were her, I&apos;d be feeling a bit badly done to as well, and a tad angry and frustrated, and I&apos;d be getting off the step as I&apos;d feel it just wasn&apos;t fair. Sometimes you have to try and put yourselvs in their place and try to imagine what they&apos;re thinking to try and figure out WHY they&apos;re behaving like that.

One more thing, you say you got flustered in the shop cos of her behaviour. DO NOT give a shit about what other people are thinking. It is not affecting them, it is nothing to do with them, so just go ahead and discipline your child as you would at home without feeling flustered or embarrassed. I really have learned that it doesn&apos;t help matters if you are worried about what other people are thinking, as you won&apos;t handle the disciplining as well. Actually if you catch a woman&apos;s eye as it&apos;s all going on, you may get a sympathetic, knowing look as she&apos;s probably been there herself!

oh, another final thing.....I DO get mad a lot at DS2&apos;s whingey, demanding personality. Believe me, from time to time I get as angry as you describe. The difference is, I just don&apos;t let him see me when I lose it. I go in another room where he can&apos;t see me. Preferably upstairs where I will punch pillows on the bed, or even scream into a pillow. Also, 5 mins upstairs physically away from them just diffuses the intense anger usually enough for me to think and behave rationally again rather than just be a nasty shouting ball of rage!

It sounds like you desperately need some time for YOU at the moment. Is there anyone who can babysit or even have the kids overnight? A bit of time away from them does me the world of good and really refreshes me (until the next tantrum LOL).

I really feel for you, but you CAN improve things - take on the good advice given in these replies and see how it goes. Good luck!

i totally sympathise with you. Is your dd your first born? We usually expect too much from our first borns as we treat them very specially, like little adults/friends, having deep discussions, conversations with them, including them in decsion making, etc. when they start behaving smartly, we think they can think like adults too and expect more out of them. They arent defiant on purpose, they are too immature still at this age (and maybe for a few more years)due to the physcial underdevelopment, to listen to instructions and to take them on board and carry them out maturely enough.I am starting to just leave them be, less nitpicking, making mountains out of molehills, as we forget that our children are only that- very young children. If we shout at them, they will shout back. We smack them , they will smack us/siblings/other kids and so on. We react fiery to situations, they will leanr from us that is how to behave in such and such a sitution when they come across one. It is a vicious cycle, and it is hard to break.

I just also want to say that there is a book i&apos;m reading at the moment called&apos;Parenting Your Defiant Child: The Kazdin Method for Managing Difficult Behaviour&apos;. I read it and it totaly descirbed me and my behaviour that most parents get caught out in. Try and see if your local library has it. It had 7 myths about parenting which was very interesting:
1. PUNISHMENT WILL CHANGE BAD BEHAVIOUR. It wont!!
2. MORE REMINDERS LEAD TO BETTER BEHAVIOUR . It doesnt!!
3. EXPLAINING WHY A CERTAIN BEHAIVOUR IS WRONG WILL LEAD THEM TO STOP THAT BEHAVIOUR. Only until you&apos;re red in the face but it still wont get you anywhere!!
4. LOTS OF PRAISE SPOILS YOUR CHILD. Positive parenting is the key in this book
5. DOING IT ONCE OR TWICE MEANS YOUR CHILD CAN DO IT REGUARLY. Because we assume kids can copy us and expect them to carry it out fully is highly unrealistic
6. MY OTHER CHILD DIDNT NEED SPECIAL HELP/TRAINING, SO THIS CHILD DOESNT.
7. MY CHILD IS JUST BEING MANUIPLUATIVE. They arent.

I hope i&apos;m making sense here and not just rattling on. I just want to reassure you that you arent a bad parent and things will get out of hand until you see it from their point of view. Perhaps this book can give you the help and reassurance you need.

All the best of luck. Be calm, and just remember that they&apos;re children and that they&apos;re still very young!!

Balanomorey, This has really made me think -&quot;I want an easy life&quot;- me too! I feel that things were SO shit in the past and then I went through something difficult a couple of years ago that I DESERVE for things to be easier now. I&apos;ve had my fair share of crap! So I get angry/despairing/anxious if things get too difficult now because I don&apos;t want to go through anything like what I&apos;ve gone through before, I&apos;ve had enough!

The fact is though, it is not as bad now and it isn&apos;t realistic to go from one extreme to the other ie have NOTHING difficult to deal with now because you had so much in the past. Everyone has it hard sometimes and we still will but it hopefully won&apos;t get as bad as before.

I wouldn&apos;t waste good chocolate by throwing it away . I must admit I don&apos;t think I would have been that drastic. I think I would have said&quot;You stop crying or you won&apos;t have this one either, you will have nothing&quot;&quot;Do you want me to put this one away (so I can eat it later ha ha)?&quot;,&quot;No?, well stop crying then&quot;.

I think when they are this young, making a threat/consequence which isn&apos;t immediate eg&quot;when you get home&quot;you are going on the naughty step, won&apos;t have much impact, it has to be something you can do now eg put the chocolate in your bag and not let him have it.

I kind of store up&apos;punishments&apos;in my head for what I can use if the kids are naughty instead of shouting/hitting/letting them get away with it. Eg. strap DS in pushchair for a few mins, send DD upstairs to play on her own for 5 mins, take the toy they are playing with away, give something nice if they do the right thing (I use sweets a lot - blatant bribery and I don&apos;t care!), withold it if they don&apos;t, take the child into another room on their own away from their friends for a few mins if they can&apos;t play nicely.

Sometimes it doesn&apos;t have to go as far as a punishment eg you could say&quot;What you should say is Thank you Mummy (in jolly voice) and then I will give you this chocolate and it will be lovely&quot;Sometimes this works and they stop being horrible, if not proceed to punishment - I should call it&apos;consequence&apos;if I&apos;m being modern and acceptable shouldn&apos;t I.

Look at me sounding all patronising and know it all! I do these things if I am feeling in a good mood and not tired or ill on a good day. When I&apos;m having a bad day I just feel I don&apos;t have the will power and lose it like normal people!

RachelP - thanks so much for the time you took to write such a constructive and helpful post. i have taken on board your points and agree I handled it all wrong and can see that with analysis and hindsight now. My problem is, i suppose, I haven&apos;t really formulated good discipline practices yet to the point that I can handle these outbursts. I am aware my approach is very inconsistent - like Acting says, some days, it&apos;s just too much hassle. I also have a tendancy to threaten punishments that I can&apos;t (or don&apos;t want to) withdraw...like I will threaten not to go to a friend&apos;s house, but I&apos;m desparate to go to get us out of the house for a few hours!!!...so won&apos;t carry out the threat. All this is said in the heat of the moment out of desparation - it&apos;s not well formulated or consistent. Also agree that I must ignore other people and just concentrate on sorting the situation without feeling embarassed - that&apos;s my problem and I hate attention and I need to deal with it. Like the idea of punching the pillows you are right - better to do it in private, don&apos;t want dd upset again .
Tomliboo - yes, she is my first (and probably last!!) and she is spoiled as she gets so much attention. you are so right about treating them as little adults - it is so easy to lose sight of the fact they are little kids and we become skewed in our assessment of their abilities. I do need to give her a break . Will check out the book, looks good
Acting - sorry you&apos;ve had shitty times too. Know exactly what you mean about feeling as tho you&apos;deserve&apos;an easy time - but you are right, life isn&apos;t like that, is it? We need to accept our lots, deal with it, move on from the crap. Thanks for the advice re storing up punishments that aren&apos;t of the shouty type - like the idea of that and will start on my list now! yes, it did grieve me the chuck the choc - it was quite a hard thing to do!!!
Thanks to all again for posting.x

balanomorey - when i was at your stage i was in a continual state of utter stress, suppressed anger, bewilderment and a feeling of&apos;this is NOT how life is supposed to be&apos;pervaded my every waking hour! IT GETS BETTER! my kids are 7 and 5 now, both at school, i have more time and therefore energy to deal with them, we are all happier, and we are getting there AT LAST. but i promise you i was every bit as down on myself and negative and low at your stage, and still can be when things are bad. i promise it gets better.&apos;raising your spirited child&apos;was my bible - still the only childcare book that ever helped me. my daughter has always been very intense, exceedingly demanding, whiny, tantrum-prone and contrary. every situation you can describe i have been through believe me. i have had days when i have wondered why the hell i ever had kids. there is a chapter heading i still remember in&apos;spirited child&apos;which goes something along the lines of&apos;letting go of your dream child&apos;that i wept buckets over!! but but but ...back to the present... she is still difficult but loads more controlled and self-aware, and her (many!) positives shine through a lot more.&apos;spirited child&apos;helped me understand her more, feel less alone and feel much more positive about her qualities - see that there is an upside to every (considerable) downside of their behavioural/character traits. the other thing that helped was going on a parenting course, though i was in oz at the time where such things are totally normal, everyone goes on them, whereas i came into it in uk-mindset mode thinking everyone was there bcs they had major problems (as i perceived myself to have) - not so - somehow i felt worse therefore!!but the advice was excellent. it was the PPP programme and is getting rolled out in some parts of the uk, or so i read.
chin up. i totally agree that you need some time for YOU, that is when things looked up for me, when i finally got time to remember who i was and to re-energise myself. calm time just for you is crucial during these difficult times.
and - i am quite sure you are a GREAT mum. it&apos;s obvious from how and what you write. good luck!

tomliboo - fascinating book - i wanna read it NOW. rings v true already.

can i just add that (of course) my daughter was indeed my first-born and that a lot of what&apos;s just been said rings true for me too - i was constantly having intense and over-her-head discussions explaining why this was wrong and the ins and outs of this and that - so, so wrong and a waste of time. not helpful. i wish i had been shorter and clearer in my explanations and in my sanctions too!

another thing i firmly believe is that too much CHOICE is creating a real problem in our kids - we all overdo the choice thing massively, i feel, whether to try to defuse tantrums (that was always one of my methods, read in many childcare manuals i might add) and i think in my daughter&apos;s case i have added unthinkingly to her stress and anxiety levels through giving her choices she wasn&apos;t up to making! just something i wanted to add.

Balanomory..your DD sounds like a clone of my DD1 who will be 3 on Boxing day.I work 4 days a week and come Friday which is supposed to be my qualidee time with both DD&apos;s Im knackered and unable to cope as well as I would like with DD1 who is also knackered from a week at cm&apos;s and acting up more than normal.Each and every Friday I lose it, and each and every Friday I feel dreadful.

I do speak to DD1 as if she&apos;s much older and more understanding than she is, because she can talk so eloquently for her age.I do forget she is not even 3 and expect too much of her.Lately things have been a bit better, because I have been consistently reminding myself&apos;she is only a baby, she is only a baby&apos;.The less I shout and show im cross the less cross she gets, though I do still find it a struggle.

Its only now Ive seen some improvement that I realised jsut how stressed this whole situation has been making me.Which in turn has made the whole situation worse..

Not easy this is it?

KatieK, I&apos;ve heard about the&quot;Raising your spirited child&quot;book before. I wish I&apos;d known about it when DS2 was born - he was spirited from day 1. REALLY hard work, he has literally turned me grey and given me more wrinkles than I should have at my age through the neverending stress of looking after him . And was a total shock after my fairly easy-going and pleasant first son. It&apos;s lucky that his good points are REALLY good, and make up for his bad points, and I can honestly say that I love him just as much as my first. But I still tell people that if he&apos;d have been born first, he would have been an only child, as I would have thought that ALL children are such hard work. And then I get all upset thinking that if things HAD turned out that way, I would forever be condemning myself as a bad parent, not able to cope, useless mother, thinking I&apos;m doing everything wrong etc etc. I am just so glad that because of DS1 turning out so well-behaved and pleasant, I KNOW I am not a failure at disciplining - it&apos;s just that DS2 needs a lot more of it LOL! And his bad behaviour on the whole is not my fault, it is just the way he is. But it is sooooo draining having to consciously discipline in the right way without flying off the handle. He is slowly getting easier though.

Anyway, sorry for that ramble, I just wanted to ask if that book, the spirited child one, would be any use to me now my son is already 2 and a half? If too much of it is referring to babies and younger toddlers, then would it be a waste of money?

Oh, and KatieK, just the thought of reading&quot;Letting go of your dream child&quot;has already got me filling up.....

This is all quite normal, just make allowances, try not to get yourself stressed about keeping to&quot;set&quot;routines too much.
If you&apos;re late for nursery so what? At least then she would have done her business and you would have felt proud of her.
Just get down to her level and say to her you know that she wants to do things by herself but tell her also the things that she can&apos;t do YET because it&apos;s too dangerous.
My DD1 and DD2 went through this stage at around 2.10yrs and they were very bosy.
But the problem with shouting is that it does not get results and just pushes your blood pressure up! 
The best thing to do is just walk away without saying anything and take some deep breaths and then come back in after 2 mins and see how far they have progressed when they are doing a task (dressing or on potty).
Try to praise your DC when she does something really well (don&apos;t go over the top) and ignore if possible any bad behaviour unless it&apos;s dangerous of course.
Shouting NEVER helps and just makes EVERYONE worse.

Am overwhelmed by the level of support I have had - thanks so much to you all 
Katie - again a lovely inspiring post - must get a copy of the book - can relate to the&apos;dream child&apos;bit and accept I must let go of that ideal - after all, dd is my cherished flesh&amp;blood and, warts&amp;all, would&apos;t swap her for the most angelic child on the planet, so why hanker after it - dosn&apos;t make sense, just a lot of wasted emotion. vital lessons learned:-

* Don&apos;t have unreasonable expectations of a little 3 yr old
* NEVER let dd witness a tantrum again
* Count to 10/punch a pillow/scream into the fridge - anything to avoid shouting at dd (will need work as it comes from nowhere 
*formulate effective discipline routines
* Don&apos;t give a monkeys about an audience when she tantrums
*loads of praise and unconditional love
* Get the spirited child book - let go of the&apos;dream child&apos;and accept the beautiful child I have been blessed with (even if she is bloody hard work)

The last few days have been better in that I have been trying the above and feel better for doing so = a calmer, happier mummy. Bought a Disney Princess Treasure Chest full of choc coins with all the Princesses on (which she adores) and have promised her a choc from the treasure chest at the end of each day if she has been a good enough girl - has been working . Onwards and upwards!! Thanks again to you all and for also not being judgemental. x.

damn, just lost a long-ish post, will have to summarise (probably you&apos;re breathing a sigh of relief i shall be briefer than is my usual tendency!)
1/ balano - judgmental - are you kidding - you are just articulating what many of us feel, as surely you realise by now!! we feel for you bcs we have been there and continue to be there too! plus we value your honesty. many don&apos;t talk as frankly about the not-so-nice aspects of parenting. i have had times not so very long ago when my daughter and i have sat on the kitchen floor bawling into each other&apos;s faces with me weeping&apos;i don&apos;t know what to do with you&apos;and her weeping back (heart-breakingly and, i now think, accurately)&apos;yes but mummy it&apos;s not my fault&apos;. argh!!! Not Ideal!!! thankfully a thing of the past (though roll on the teenage years!!)
2/ rachel - v nice response thank you! - my child is also not proving the most effective anti-ageing formula around, may i just sympathise there for a moment!! the spirited child book is great from toddler to way into secondary school age so go for it. i should add it isn&apos;t brilliant on specific management techniques as such, more a really reassuring and enlightening read on why our children behave the way they do. and i totally agree that my other child has reinforced my conclusion that some kids are just innately more challenging/negative/tricky than others. i have a much more mellow 2nd child who is a walk in the park compared to child number one!!
3/ balano - this is a bit of a new-agey way to end but these challenging moments/children stretch us, they expand us, and they make us examine ourselves and our lives in ways that are not always pleasant - but which strengthen us and ultimately make us wiser.
or so i whimper to myself during the bad times!!

thanks girls you&apos;ve made me feel less isolated - thanks balanomory for posting and GOOD LUCK x

Thanks for that book reference KatieK. Mumsnet has been brilliant for recommending childcare/ self awareness/personal growth books and my bedside table groans under the weight of them all. 
However I am also much better for reading them, and my family life much calmer as a result.
I have been thinking about how alot of us feel bad about shouting at our DC. I am a&apos;shouty mummy&apos;at times when I am feeling stressed/ hormonal or unsupported. I don&apos;t like doing it and my DC have told me afterwards they don&apos;t like it. 

However I never shout horrible words at them, only stuff like&apos;just why won&apos;t you do what I ask you?&apos;. I have smacked my DC on very rare occasions when I have been on my own for long periods of time, their behaviour has been challenging and I&apos;ve felt pushed over the edge. All in all I think I do a very good job considering how little support we get as a family from outside. Also I did not have good parenting models from my own parents.

I think what I am trying to say, is we should stop beating ourselves up so much about negative aspects of our parenting, and should look at all the really positive aspects.

Mimizan - you are so right. My dh often says that I worry too much about how well I am doing as a parent and that I should chill out a bit more. He reasons that chilling out = happier mummy = happier child = less bad bahaviour = happier mummy - a never ending cycle of happiness!!!

I agree that there is a lot of helpful literature out there to aid us frazzled mums - but at the same time, there just seems to be so many rights and wrongs - no wonder we all get stressed that we aren&apos;t doing it right. I really believe that bringing up kids in this day and age is far more stressful than it ever was because society has become so judgemental and critical of how we do it. My mum couldn&apos;t believe how much info I was bombarded with by the HV when dd was born - some of it obviously valuable, but gees, it&apos;s daunting anyhow without feeling like you need to abide by every bit of info to the letter!

So I guess what I&apos;m trying to say is no wonder we all lose it as we are putting so much pressure on ourselves to be the perfect parents all the time - no shouting, definately no smacking, do it this way, do it that way...and it seems like how our kids behave is tangible evidence of our failure or success...there in the supermarkets in all its glory for all and sundry to witness whenever dc&apos;s go off on one, once again over something trivial! Sigh!!

i totally agree girls. we are doing FINE. more than fine, it&apos;s just that we are all a whole lot more worried about our performance as mothers than in any preceding generation.

i sat in with a child psychiatrist on friday morning (i&apos;m a gp with an interest - strangely enough more pronouced since becoming a mother myself!! - in that direction)and he emphasised how bloody AWFUL you have to be as a parent to really damage children, so resilient and hard-wired for survival (emotional in this instance) are they. i am not sure i entirely believed him but it was reassuring to hear!!

he feels the differences between the rest of us (the non-abusive, non-neglectful parents) are basically pretty small and that we should all stop beating ourselves up about everything we do bcs our children are highly likely to be OKAY!!!

the best advice i&apos;ve ever read is to trust your own instinct as a mother regardless of the latest fashion. but it&apos;s hard to trust yourself when you feel knackered, haggard, isolated, alone, ineffectual and confused! however i agree with you mimizan, actually we are doing bloody well, mostly, at a very very hard job, even if we have both resorted to the odd smack at exceedingly trying times when alone for long periods!! so we should remember that.

in summary: we are GREAT!

hmmm. i quite like my new persona as an american teenage cheerleader. wonder how long i can keep it up for...

ps balanomory ever feel a little, er, weighed down by responsibility when you hear that happy mother=happy kids=happy mother=happy everyone thing (which has also been run by me by a variety of people over the years) - no pressure eh??!not like the weight of the entire world&apos;s wellbeing lies on your shoulders or anything!!

Oh my god, to think I nearly didn&apos;t click on this thread..

I could have written most of these messages, and yet I&apos;ve been feeling like I&apos;m the worst mother in the world for so long because of my temper. It&apos;s reassuring to hear how common it is, especially with first children.

My ds1 is nearly 6, and I had ds2 5 months ago, and having him has really helped me see that my attitude towards ds1 is unacceptable. I would never shout at or get cross with ds2 - the thought of it turns my stomach. And yet, my precious beautiful ds1, who I love so much it makes me want to cry, regularly gets me so angry and frustrated I snap at him, shout at him, have smacked in the past (although stopped doing that a while ago as I felt so awful) and a couple of times I told him to shut up. I didn&apos;t shout shut up, or say it in an aggressive way, more a tired, exasperated way, but I still know it&apos;s a horrible thing to say to a child and I&apos;m determined not to do it again.

I HATE behaving like this. It makes me feel so bad afterwards, it doesn&apos;t solve anything, and it is just not the way I pictured myself behaving when ds1 was a baby. I never got angry, up until the time we moved abroad when ds1 was 2.3, and I was so depressed and lonely, and I just started taking it out on him and he picked up on this and started playing up..

This vicious cycle went on for a good while, more than a year, before I realised it had to stop, or all his childhood memories would be of me red faced, yelling over something he&apos;d done. I&apos;ve read so many parenting books and taken bit s and pieces on board from all of them, but the best for me was called&quot;How To Behave So Your Preschooler Will Too&quot;by Dr Sal Severe. It helped me see that a lot of my son&apos;s behaviour was not naughtiness but just normal for a small child, and I had been expecting far too much of him, and the crux of it was I had to change the way I behaved rather than thinking I should change him, as I was the one with the problem.

I calmed down a lot since then but still explode occasionally, and as I say, it&apos;s since having my baby boy that I can see how I still have a way to go. I want my boys to know how much I love them, and feel they have unconditional love and care from me, and I know I can do it.

Yikes, I seem to have descended into mawkish sentimentality, sorry folks! This is just a subject so close to the bone for me, and I&apos;m so glad I found this thread.

Happy mother=happy children kind of lets everybody else off the hook doesn&apos;t it?
Instead why not look at what makes a mother happier? More support from family/ government and respect in general for undertaking a difficult job. Mothers come under so much criticism, even on Mumsnet. All those outraged threads about behaviour people have witnessed in public. It can be very critical, and if you&apos;ve had a bad time with your DC can leave you feeling even worse.

Katiek123, I love the adjectives you used knackered, haggard, isolated, alone, ineffectual and confused. They sum up how I have often felt, but not dared to share. We have to come across as so happy and positive. I was talking to someone at a playgroup the other day who said&apos;It&apos;s not the done thing to moan is it, unless you want people to start crossing the road when they see you?&apos;She said she saves her moaning for her Mum, but what are you meant to do if you haven&apos;t got a Mum to moan to?

This thread is supportive. Thanks for starting it Balan.

Blimey! To think that my post has touched so many of you is amazing - I&apos;m glad that it has not only helped me but many others too. How nice it is to know you aren&apos;t alone - it gives you back a bit of humanity dosn&apos;t it!! Well done Monkey for getting yourself out of the hole I&apos;m currently trying to crag myself and my dd out of. Her behaviour has been up and down, has dramatically worsened in general over the last 2 weeks and I&apos;m still grappling with my new approaches and trying to get it right.

Mimi - I know dh&apos;s ideal isn&apos;t easily gotten, but I know it&apos;s advice borne from genuine love and caring, bless him! I do get a lot of support and I suppose he&apos;s just floundering as to how he can make it better for me. Yesterday dd was playing up in the pub where we took her for lunch...I was trying my best, but he could see I was wound up and he basically said in a polite way dd is here to stay (never in question, obviously!!!) so just got to accept behaviour and deal with it - don&apos;t fight it - this is key to being happier. He&apos;s right - it&apos;s down to me.

Empathise with Monkey - feel so sad that my experience of motherhood has left me feeling like a failure and nothing like how I thought I&apos;d be as a mum . DD will be 3 in a few weeks and I keep thinking back to 3 yrs ago when I was expecting her - all the excitement and anticipation. i feel I&apos;ve let myself down as I can never get the time back to do it differently - and God, how I&apos;d try and do it differently

I didn&apos;t mean to sound critical of your DH. My DH says the same things to me, and I know it&apos;s him trying to support me. I meant more towards the childcare books that give out that kind of message, that it&apos;s mainly the responsibility of the mother.

Balanomorey - i haven&apos;t read the whole thread but think you have received some good advice.
I totally sympathise, I have 2 ds&apos;s aged 4 and 2, DS2 is particularly demanding at the moment, he is what I would call a&apos;meddler&apos;, if there&apos;s something he can get his fingers into it (usually toilet brushes in public toilets, drains, the cats bum ) he will do and i find the constant, telling him to&apos;leave it&apos;totally draining and find myself losing it with him regularly.
However when DS1 was a similar age I posted on MN and got the best advice i have ever been given and it has stayed with me. It is that toddlers very much reflect your behaviour, so she tantrums...you tantrum, it escalates and all hell breaks loose. If You stay calm, you remain in control.
I know how hard it is to stay calm, when you feel like exploding...take a deep breath, walk away if necessary, count to 10 and the distraction technique is always a good one to fall back on.
Good luck x

I&apos;ve just picked up this thread&amp;cant believe how much of it applies to me. I&apos;ve never had the guts to talk to anyone about how frustrated&amp;angry i get with my ds who&apos;s only 21 months.
As soon as a fly off the handle i know i&apos;m doing wrong but cant help it then immediately feel guilty&amp;start crying.The past few wks have been improving because i am making a conscious effort.
I&apos;m constantly aware that he will start following my behaviour which isnt what he needs-I need to set an example but just knowing that there are others out there who are experiencing the same has been a huge relief.
I&apos;ve already jotted down all the books mentioned&amp;am heading to the library tomorrow.

Well done for Balanomorey for startiing off this&apos;painful&apos;thread

Subster..totally agree. i think the wake up call is when you see your behaviour reflected in theirs and you realise that alot of their&apos;bad&apos;behaviour has been picked up from you. It is quite shocking.

I have have shouted at my DS&apos;s because they&apos;ve shouted at me totally ridiculous. I guess it&apos;s true we learn by example.

Thank you so much for starting this thread - it could be me!!

Since my DS was born 12 weeks ago I&apos;ve become a real&apos;toxic parent&apos;to my DD (3yo) and made all sorts of excuses for my anger and frustration - tiredness, baby blues etc. - but the hard truth is that my tantrums are often worse than DD&apos;s!

Like you, Balano, I had a particularly bad day involving lots of shouting, slamming doors and incredibly bad behaviour (from me), and I realised that things had to change.

Like others on the thread, it&apos;s a relief to know that there are others out there feeling the same and that there is a way forward. My expectations are far too high of both DD and DS and I spend too much time worrying about what others think about my children and my parenting.

Keep posting!

do you know what i cant stand? its people who say everything is brilliant, perfect and their kids are wonderful and perfectly behaved, get into routine straight away and sleep from day one.

even if my dd was like this i would tell other people she was, because it makes people like me feel bad and that i am doing something wrong.

i have a friend who has a dd of 2 nad a half and a ds about 5 months. i dont see her often but when i do, she gushes how easy she finds parenting and how wonderful and brilliant her children are. her dd was walking a 9 months and talking really well vry early

well good for her.i underdtand people are proud of thier kids but why push it down others throats when i have already told you my dd doesnt sleep well or cant talk well or doesnt do anything as good as your dd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just had to add my support balanomorey. I have a 2.4 year old DD and she is&apos;spirited&apos;too. I think in response to one of your earlier posts you definitely need to revise your mantra. When your child is spirited you can not hope for an&apos;easy&apos;life. Instead hope for a happy life because I don&apos;t think it will ever be easy!

Having said that there are a few things which make life simpler. Definite clear boundaries which also mean following through any threats, so think very carefully before you issue them. The naughty step never worked with my eldest DD but has been a godsend with DD2, she will often stop any naughty behaviour just by being threatened with the naughty step....a good bedtime routine and enough sleep is essential. Finally try taking advantage of her determination by finding an activity she&apos;ll love such as swimming or gymnastics because that determination is what potential champions are made of!!

Seriously I think it&apos;s also important to view it as a positive trait, obviously hard to see at the moment but as they get older I can see my DD being able to do anything if she puts her mind to it, unlike my eldest DD who was an agelic child but she really doesn&apos;t have that tenacity about her character that DD2 has and could as a consequence get walked over if not careful. Good luck.

katiek, I know what you mean about some of the competitive mummy stuff on here. Some people can sound so assertive and&apos;sorted&apos;and can make you feel a bit inadequate about your parenting&apos;stylee&apos;. I have at times felt judged as uncaring and harsh with my DC.

I suppose the thing is we are only dealing with words, and the real people don&apos;t shine through the written word.

I have also been thinking about the&apos;spirited child&apos;since coming on this thread. My 3 DC could probably all be described as this. They are now 9,7 and 3 and have been such hard work at times. Both physically and emotionally draining. At times I have been completely with my friends and acquaintances with calm, compliant DC. However now they are getting older, I am so proud that my DC are so self-confident, always willing to try something new and ooze independence. They are also developing a strong sense of empathy.

They can still be difficult, DD is just at the start of a willful stage, but I would not have them be any different to the way they are.

I still think it&apos;s ok to have a moan about them though.

good post mimi! i just got back from DD&apos;s karate class where she absolutely kicks ass!! it&apos;s been fantastic to see her channel that determination, obsessive precision, strength of character and, yes, spirit into shining at something like that. and it&apos;s absolutely true that spirited kids may wear us down, but are NEVER boring and will be truly exceptional adults. have you ever noticed how other people&apos;s children seem a little, er, bland in comparison? now, i have LONGED for&apos;bland&apos;on many occasion, but ultimately i realise that spirit is to be celebrated - that&apos;s if i am still alive to (weakly) wave my little flag at her graduation/wedding/ prime ministerial inauguration!!!
i would love to see more independence and empathy in my little fiery kid - great that you see those coming through in yours.

agree completely with keevamum&apos;s sentiment that we&apos;ve completely HAD it as far as an easy life is concerned, but that happiness is not therefore an impossible goal! also that sleep and routine essential for these kids - much more than for the average child, in my experience.

lizandlulu - re the shopping alone thing - feel for you!! i was on my knees, nearly literally, until mine went to school, and now life has been transformed. even though i work, i make DAMN SURE i have windows of time ENTIRELY TO MYSELF, even it it&apos;s just the odd couple of hours - i look back at years gone by and think - i earned them!! so i explain (vigorously!) to my other half, anyway!!

Hi all
Didn&apos;t manage to get on yesterday - hectic day!

So agree with all the posts about&apos;smug mummy friends&apos;. I too have one who is lovely and has a heart of gold, but is so smug sometimes, i could slap her!!! 

Her dd is 6 weeks older than mine, so it&apos;s been hard not to compare. You can bet your bottom dollar if I&apos;m venting about dd&apos;s negative behaviour, her dd will be doing the opposite. So while my dd is supplying the dog with an endless supply of veg off her plate resulting in a dog with the trots and a constipated dd, her dd eats the bloody lot with knobs on!!! Hurrah, I&apos;m so pleased for you, how wonderful it must be, but tell me in 6 weeks time, not straight away on the back of my dispair! Her timing is crap. I think next time I&apos;ll just comment that it&apos;s a good job my dd is negatively behaved as it compensates her dds impeccable behaviour and will restore equilibrium to the planet!!

But it grates, dosn&apos;t it - you don&apos;t need to hear it, you already beat yourself up enough about it without having your nose rubbed in it ..but you are right keeva and katie, it is a blessing to have a spirited child - never a dull moment!! DD loves singing and dancing - maybe I should enrol her in stage school!

Quiribus and Keeva - welcome on board. How refreshing this is to know we all feel the same.

Have been trying really hard with dd this week. The more I&apos;ve been thinking about it and analysing her, the more I&apos;ve come to realise how my behaviour is impacting and how much I have to change. She is hiding her face every time I say no or tell her off now (not shouty telling off, by the way, just the normal need-to-say stuff). I keep instilling how much I love her and adore her so hopefully, she understands. To keep anger under control, when I feel it brewing (sounds daft) I count to 10 and imagine 5 balloons with the letters of the word ANGER on each one and in my imagination I pop them to dispurse my anger - I will keep working on it!! The only times this week I&apos;ve let myself down is when I&apos;ve snapped because my back is hurting. Not her fault, but have had back pain since in my teens and it&apos;s not too good since yesterday. She was being feeble about getting in the car this morning, so have her a helping hand - which made my back hurt. So got a bit narky with her for not getting in the car like she normally does. This is something I really have to work on as I get so frustrated when my back&apos;goes&apos;and I do take it out on my nearest and dearest - not right, as it&apos;s not their fault 
Good luck all x.

Blueshoes, My two older DC are still spirited and challenging. They often won&apos;t take no for an answer, pushing me further and further over the edge. I used to feel bad about feeling hacked off with them. I have read this book which was recommended on MN;&apos;Maternal Ambivalence, Torn Apart&apos;by Rozilla Parker. It really helped me to stop feeling bad, and realise my feelings are just normal.

I read this at the same time the DSs got their last school reports. DS1 was described as&apos;bright, humourous and charismatic&apos;, DS2 as having a&apos;very inquisitive nature and always asking questions about the world&apos;.
I know for sure I would rather this than impeccable and compliant behaviour.
If you can ride the storm with spirited children , you are setting them up for life as independent and creative thinkers.

Balanmoney - I sympathise lots and lots and having just burst into tears after shouting at my 3 year old I think we have a lot of similar problems!

Rachelp73 makes some really good points.

My DS is very strong willed and I have found these tips really helpful:

1. Ignoring his bad behaviour (unless he is hurting someone then I say&apos;no&apos;and then give attention to whoever he has hurt and won&apos;t even look at him for about 2 minutes. I then take him aside and very quietly say... if you do X again I will take away your toy from you. Then leave it at that.

I know that if I shout or rant at him he will do it again and more often - but if I ignore it he gives up

2. Praising his good behaviour - be it playing quietly by himself/eating a his dinner/sharing toys etc - star charts work wonders

3. Whinging - I always say&apos;sorry can&apos;t understand you when you speak in that voice&apos;until he says it normally

4. Giving warning - I always say if you do this .. then this will happen (fighting over toys, I say either you two share or I will take the toy away)

5.Apologise - If I shout etc I always say sorry afterwards, and explain in simple terms why I was angry.

I shall now go and read my own advice, take a deep breath and have a cuddle with my little one

good luck it can be very hard x

I am loving reading this thread. After posting the other night, a memory from my own childhood came to me and I suddenly realised I wanted to add a further idea. When I was about 5 or 6 years old, I was at my sister&apos;s birthday party at home, and we were playing something like spin the bottle. Not sure if it was exactly that kissing game as we may know it (!) but it certainly involved someone being in charge of spinning a bottle in the middle of a circle of kids. The older kid from next door who was 12 or something was given that responsibility as she was oldest, but I wanted to have just 1 go at spinning it on one of the turns. Now, for some reason, my mum decided that she wouldn&apos;t let me. I think it was only because she already had someone else doing that job, and in her eyes, I just didn&apos;t need to do it. But I really really wanted to have a go, just 1 go, and just couldn&apos;t understand why she wouldn&apos;t let me. (as an adult, I STILL don&apos;t understand why she wouldn&apos;t let me, other than I guess she was the harrassed party hostess who was just trying to keep the game flowing).

Now, this whole memory has stuck with me for 30-odd years. I distinctly remember the gut-wrenching disappointment at my mum not understanding why it was so important to me to do it, and also the utter, utter unfairness at not being allowed to do a simple, quick thing. I went into a total emotional meltdown, I just felt so SAD......my dad had to take me upstairs as I was getting hysterical with crying and they just didn&apos;t&quot;get&quot;what I was getting upset about. It even got so far as them asking their neighbour for advice as I was beside myself with crying and as a nurse, she told them to slap me across the face once to shock me out of it. Well, as you can imagine, after the first metaphorical slap in the face of not being allowed to have a turn at spinning the bottle, to then get an actual slap across the face, I was a total mess.......I think the only thing that calmed me down in the end was my dad taking me and my friend out the house to get some crisps from the shop. The trauma of my feelings during that whole episode has stuck with me all my life and I&apos;m sure it has helped in the parenting style I have with my own kids. I really try and put myself in my kids&apos;position as much as possible, to UNDERSTAND their behaviour and reactions to situations. Sometimes it helps me to realise when I am being too harsh on them for a tiny misdemeanour (i.e. choose your battles - not everything is worth fighting over, is what I&apos;ve learned from that).

But most of all, it has taught me to try and imagine how a toddler or a 4 year old thinks. Even if they are getting upset at something which seems trivial to ME, I try imagine how THEY are viewing it. For example, I try never to dismiss their concerns and tell them they are being silly if they are kicking up a fuss about something, as to them it might really, really matter! If they are moaning and getting in a state about something which really is out of my control eg. we are in a traffic jam in the car and they are getting restless and whingey, I really try and make a conscious effort to empathise with them and say&quot;oooh yes, this is very annoying having to wait in this queue, isn&apos;t it? I wonder how long we&apos;ll have to wait here for, shall we have bets on when it&apos;ll start moving again blah blah&quot;, instead of just shouting&quot;Oh will you just STOP moaning!&quot;. Usually I find that that sort of comment only serves to get their backs up and moan even more, and the whole thing escalates, but if they hear that you are actually acknowledging that they are feeling fed up, and agree with them, then it really calms the situation down. If you are still reading this v long post, Balanomorey, , then for example, in the situation you describe of your little girl getting angry at not being able to have her kinder egg cos the other choc bar had already been put through the till, then if you just try and imagine her disappointment, and say something like&quot;oh no, that&apos;s a shame, isn&apos;t it, the man has already put it through the till so we&apos;ll have to put the kinder egg back. I know you really wanted the kinder egg, too. Never mind, though, as next time we need petrol we&apos;ll come here, hey, and buy a kinder egg then - how about that?&quot;

I&apos;m only taking your kinder egg thing as an example - I&apos;ve been in lots of situations like it with my own kids, and just find the empathising thing mostly works, and just lets them feel you are on their side! Of course, I&apos;ve had times with my two where they&apos;ve just been in a shit mood and the&quot;let&apos;s get it next time, would that be good?&quot;type of thing is met with a&quot;NOOOOO!!!!! I want it NOWWWW!&quot;, and then I&apos;ve just had to accept that no amount of poncey empathising is going to calm them down and we just have to get out of there pronto!

On another point you make, I totally sympathise about your back pain contributing to your short temper. I&apos;ve had severe back pain in the past for weeks on end and I know, it turns you into a different person, doesn&apos;t it? It is really, really depressing, the constant pain. I can totally understand you being short with your kids anyway ifyou&apos;re in pain, but especially if it&apos;s been made worse by having to lift your daughter cos she won&apos;t shift herself! The problem is, that you can try and explain to kids about if you&apos;re feeling ill or in pain or fed up or whatever till you&apos;re blue in the face, and the response you always seem to get is&quot;Oh, really? Oh dear. Can I have my tea now?&quot;Oh, yes, this bloody empathy business certainly isn&apos;t a reciprocal arrangement in our house. I&apos;ve heard that kids don&apos;t really learn how to empathise properly till they&apos;re a lot older. It&apos;s really annoying that at the age my two are, they expect you to be supermummy 24/7 no matter how shit you tell them you are feeling.

Mimizan:&quot;DS1 was described as&apos;bright, humourous and charismatic&apos;&quot;. You are describing my DS2, age 2.5, to a T. It&apos;s only recently I&apos;ve started to notice these fantastic things about him, as before now, his whingeing and constant need for attention overshadowed the good points of his personality. Slowly, slowly we are getting there......I honestly can&apos;t wait until he&apos;s a bit older and has more scope at nursery and school or clubs etc to really shine at last. I just think he&apos;s not naturally comfy in himself having to be a toddler, but somehow I have the feeling that he will really shine as he gets older.

Oh, thank you for this thread!! I too am the haggard mother of a spirited 3 yo dd (as well as a 4yo and a 10mth old) and I too seem to morph into that shrieking harpy (especially when we are late for the school bus in the morning) At least I know my shouting doesn&apos;t seem to upset dd2 in the slightest- she just shouts back&quot;DON&apos;T SHOUT AT ME!!&quot;dd1 was easier, because she always wanted to please us, so just being disappointed in her upsets her, but dd2 cares not a jot. She seems to have a shrug and a&quot;So sue me&quot;attitude which drives me crazy! I apologised to her the other day for shouting at her for messing about when she should have been trying to put her socks on (she put them on her hands instead- aargh!)and she seemed to find me apologising to her quite amusing- she asked me 3 times that day&quot;Are you sorry you shouted at me, mummy?&quot;Yeah, rub it in, why don&apos;t you!

The thing is, she is a real wee character, and very funny. dd1 comes through screaming that dd2 nipped her, so I call her, and she stamps past me, rolling her eyes, saying&quot;OK, OK, I&apos;m GOING to the naughty step!&quot;She is very hard to discipline, and sometimes I am at my wits end with her. We have the&quot;why it&apos;s wrong to hit/ scratch your sister, and she just rolls her eyes and says&quot;Well, I&apos;ve STOPPED now, haven&apos;t I? I&apos;m not doing it NOW, OK?&quot;Or she lies, blatantly, and while staring me straight in the eye: today for example&quot;I DIDN&apos;T bite her- I was just nosing her and my teeth got caught!&quot;What do you do??? So I said&quot;Biting is unacceptable in this house. AS is hitting and scratching and nasty behaviour in general. OK???&quot;And she said&quot;But what about nosing?&quot;AARGH!

Must read some of these books you all mention!

oh god demanding children! your post about needing the potty as you are on way out of the door is something i can relate to. DD1 (4) does this often. most often when we are late for dancing and i have just put her leotard, tights and coat on. off comes the coat off with leotard, off with the tights. i honestly can sometimes feel an urge to throttle her. especially when she does just as i have got the buggy outside and cannot go upstairs alone incase there are dragonflies!

i deal with it by doing a countdown with her. i.e. do you need a wee because we are getting ready for dancing in a minute. after that programme we will put your things on for dancing so go to the toilet please. after your leotard is on we are setting off to dancing on the way we will go to the shop. and on and on so she always knows whats coming next. though she still ends up needing a wee just as we leave the house it does seem to stop the&quot;ill go after dora has finished&quot;tantrums.

everything has to be done ten minutes ago with her too&quot;can i have a drink? you havent got me a drink yet. im thirsty i need a drink. well can i just have my cup then and ill get my own drink&quot;&quot;FOR GODS SAKE CANT YOU SEE THAT I AM EATING!! AT LEAST GIVE ME CHANCE TO ANSWER YOU&quot;&quot;can i have my cup then?&quot;arrrrrrrrrrrgh.

not much advise. i am still trying to find a way through it myself. just lots of sympathy. i often lose my temper too. its easy to do when you are being constantly badgered by a child who seems incapable of listening or being patient.

Rachel, thanks for talking about empathy. I am guilty of answering in an irritated way, when the DC badger me. It would use up just the same energy to answer them empathetically. I know I should use humour more with them too, but often I am feeling so intensely irritated and frazzled I just can&apos;t do it. 

The odd thing is I help out at school a lot, and have so much patience with other children. When it comes to my own I suppose they know which buttons to press to get me going. I have tried pretending they are someone else&apos;s DC when they are winding me up, but it hasn&apos;t really worked.

Another tip for not losing it, I read on here, was to imagine Kirsty Allsop and the Location, Location team are in your house filming. It did help me for a while. When I was just about to have a fit, like push a chair over or shout, I&apos;d imagine Kirsty looking on with her hands on her swirly-skirted hips, and her eyebrows raised.

KatieK, the empathy thing is discussed in a great book called&quot;The 7 secrets of sucessful parenting&quot;, have you read it? My DH bought it me for my birthday (was he trying to tell me something?! ) Nah, only messing, he knows I just have a particular interest in parenting and child psychology and actually put some THOUGHT into his present this year LOL!

It talks about 7 different types of parent and the different parenting styles they have, and what the advantages of each type are. One of them is the&quot;tuned-in parent&quot;, and I realised that that&apos;s the parenting style that most struck a chord with how I deal with my 2.

If you like reading parenting books just for your own interest, then it really is a good one. Loads of practical advice and proper strategies for dealing with particular situations and problems and helpful to see that there is usually no single right way to deal with a problem, it could be approached in different ways, with the same successful outcome. Lots of real life examples and stories from parents too.

SheSells.....VERY funny reading this bit of your post:&quot;can i have a drink? you havent got me a drink yet. im thirsty i need a drink. well can i just have my cup then and ill get my own drink&quot;&quot;FOR GODS SAKE CANT YOU SEE THAT I AM EATING!! AT LEAST GIVE ME CHANCE TO ANSWER YOU&quot;&quot;can i have my cup then?&quot;arrrrrrrrrrrgh. I only had to READ that scenario and I could feel my blood pressure going up. It&apos;s exactly what my 4 year old does and drives me totally mental at times. They really don&apos;t see us as real human beings with our own needs, do they?!

Ah, now you see, Mimizan, if I were to imagine Kirsty standing there with her swirly-skirted hips, I would lose all remnant of patience and yell&quot;oh for god&apos;s sake, can&apos;t you see that those bloody A-line skirts do NOTHING for your figure?&quot; 

Agree it&apos;s really hard to be empathetic when you are desperately tired and worn-down. At bad times, it has turned into sarcasm with me. eg.&quot;Oh, you&apos;re fed up, are you? Oh dear, poor you! (said in a totally sarcastic way) You think YOU&apos;RE fed up, what about poor Mummy who has to listen to the two of you moaning and moaning about nothing in particular for no reason? blah blah blah blah.&quot;One time, DS1 actually said to me after one of these outbursts&quot;It must be hard being a mummy to a 3 year old and a little toddler&quot;. Damn right!

I love this thread, I&apos;ve laughed and I&apos;ve nearly cried. I&apos;m so relieved there are loads of people going through the same as me.

Can anyone tell me what approach to take in my thinking and what to say to my DD in these situations:

1. In the mornings I am a monster and want to be left alone. DS (3) comes into our room and gets up on the bed and tells me something about a toy and I find him so cute and my heart melts. DD (5) comes in, jumps on the bed and talks (louder than DS) about something more complex and it just sounds like fast, non-stop, mind numbing drivel to me and in my head I&apos;m thinking&quot;Fuck off&quot; . I find she&apos;invades&apos;my head so much more than him and demands more response when I just want to be left alone to process my thoughts and be still. (I think she is an extrovert and although friends think I am an extrovert, truly I am an introvert who just acts like an extrovert sometimes).

2. At bathtimes (we only do it once a week , DS gets in and is happy to have his bath and play with bath toys etc. DD puts her feet in the water, no matter how cold we have made it, and starts screaming&quot;It&apos;s hot, it&apos;s too hot&quot;. She won&apos;t sit down so we can wash her. I worry about her slipping and smashing her teeth. I&apos;ve tried saying&quot;I know you don&apos;t like it so take all the time you need and sit down when you are ready&quot;but after waiting a certain amount of time I can&apos;t take anymore and just want to get on with the bath and finish it and not stay in there all night! So I get angry and start ranting at her. She sits down and I start washing her then she wails&quot;It&apos;s too cold!&quot;. She is never happy.

I wash her hair and she is quite good at putting her head back now so it doesn&apos;t go in her eyes but if she gets the tiniest drip in her eye she screams and gets angry. When she gets out of the bath she is too cold and shouts at me for not getting her dressed quickly enough. Each time I am disappointed with myself for losing my temper and being really nasty to her at bathtime and I vow to do it better next time but however hard I try I nearly always lose it.

3. DD has sudden fears about almost anything. Once she gets it into her head that something is scary she quickly becomes terrified and starts screaming and getting angry with us if we don&apos;t do something about it. When she starts screaming DS also thinks there is something to be scared of so he starts screaming and then I&apos;m angry with DD for passing her fear (which I see as an unnecessary fear) onto DS.

4. DD is creative and talented at art and craft (also at ballet). She has ambitions for her projects which are often beyond her capabilities. She tries something, it goes a bit wrong and she gets absolutely furious and screams and rages and thrashes about with scissors in her hand and sometimes destroys the work she has done so far. I say&quot;If you make that noise I will pack it all away for 5 mins til you calm down, you have to calm down and try again or think of a different way to do it&quot;. Am I doing the right thing? She is still getting mad.

5. DD wants to talk and talk at me, often complete nonsense and I do try to be interested and try to respond (she says the same thing over and over if I don&apos;t respond) and I try to sound interested but sometimes I just can&apos;t take it anymore, it feels like mind numbing torture by incessant annoying noise! I end up saying&quot;Please just don&apos;t talk to me for a few minutes, go away and leave me alone for a bit&quot;then I feel like I am rejecting her.

6. DD seems quite thick skinned in a way in that if you tell her off for something, even when she was a baby, she would laugh in your face. Even now, I tell her off and she just looks like she really doesn&apos;t care and it isn&apos;t enough punishment just to be told off to be a decentive not to do it again. I feel I need to punish her so that she regrets her behaviour, so I have consequences like taking things away from her or sending her to her room for 5 mins. I worry that I feel I&apos;m really trying to be mean to her and make her cry so that she feels punished enough to not do it again.

I hate it that I don&apos;t feel the same about her as I do about DS even though I think DS is spirited as well in a different way (very very sensitive). If I just ask him nicely not to do something he cries loudly and tragically for a long time. In fact he cries about nearly everything eg dropping his fork on the floor is a tragedy.

ActingNormal, mornings and bathtimes are my two worst times as well. I really am not a morning person and I have to try so hard to be pleasant to ds1 and not just bark orders at him. He&apos;ll be drifting around, head in the clouds, ignoring me when I talk to him and I get so mad. I just want to get him ready as quick as possible without any hassle, without having to repeat myself 10 times.

As for bathtime, I would say that I actually dread it. I guess as it&apos;s the end of the day so we&apos;re both tired, but ds1&apos;s way of behaving at this time is so infuriating, just silly things like yawning ostentatiously when i try to brush his teeth, spraying water around the bathroom. God, it all sounds so petty but at the time it winds me up so much. I hate it when we&apos;ve had a really nice day, but then we have bathtime, he acts like this, i get cross and yell and then he goes to bed and I get sad that he won&apos;t remember any of the nice things that happened but just being yelled at by mean Mummy 

Do you think your DD is picking up on the fact that you find DS a lot easier than her? Maybe she&apos;s feeling a bit left out or rejected, and messing around like this is a way of trying to get attention - the old&apos;any attention is better than none&apos;thing. I picked up on no 3 on your list - her&apos;passing on&apos;fears to DS sounds a bit like she may feel her feelings aren&apos;t being acknowledged but she is being being blamed instead?

Hello AN . I know you from the&apos;Stately Homes&apos;thread.

Your DD does sound like a spirited child. She sounds very bright, creative and energetic. Now she&apos;s 5 perhaps this could channeled a bit into after-school activities. My DS2 started an art after school club he enjoyed at 5. I also bought him lots of arts and crafts materials which he likes doing at home. I tend to leave him to it as he gets cross if I get involved.

Re. bath time, can you coax her into the bath with bubbles or toys so she forgets to moan. Perhaps you could appeal to her being a big girl, and encourage her to wash herself with her own special flannel.

As Monkey mentioned perhaps this behaviour is just a way to get more attention. What does she really like doing? Perhaps she could choose an activity such as the cinema and the two of you could go together? You could have a&apos;pamper session&apos;where you put nail varnish on/ do her hair etc.

You could even have a star chart for bath time with stickers for each time she has a bath without fuss. The main reward could be an afternoon with you all to herself.

HTH

AN

this thread is SO reassuring is it not?! i was like you - SO relieved to find other people going through the same stuff as me - it&apos;s a constant source of comfort!!

your crafts sessions strike SUCH a chord with me. my spirited 7 yr old is obsessed with arts and crafts but has zero teolerance for the slightest aspect of whatever project it is going even slightly wrong. OH the fun we have had with scissors, wool, glue and cardboard!! just thinking about it makes me feel faint with horror, to be honest. i could reel off dozens of examples of it all going pear-shaped and ending in drama and sobs within, ooh, 20 seconds.

someone bought her a&apos;first sewing kit&apos;last week - ARGH - all colour drained from my face as i surveyed said BEAST emerging from its wrapping paper!! the usual tantrum ensued but...and here is HOPE FOR YOU ALL..after ten minutes or so she calmed down then said&apos;mummy you know this is the type of thing that REALLY FRUSTRATES me, can you put it away because it&apos;s making me upset&apos;. breakthrough!! all the years of trying to help her&apos;verbalise her emotions&apos;finally paying off. or something like that. or maybe the Good Fairy was hovering (nearly wrote hoovering - i wish!!) nearby and waved her wand. i dunno. i did of course have to buy her another present (her sense of injustice is wildly overdeveloped) though kerching...

the crafts thing has been SO draining. like your DD mine&apos;s ambitions were vastly inflated beyond her potential (and my home&apos;s for providing materials!). even now i HIDE sections of magazines featuring arts and crafts. someone gave us some brownie mags recently - all went to the recycling bcs of the huge numbers of crafts featured - i had to make sure she didn&apos;t see them!!! fortunately her school does enough with her now to satisfy her urges and of course..,at school she is fine!! and bcs her bro isn&apos;t that into them she does lots of differnt stuff with him instead. er, like hiding all the dvd&apos;s behind the sofa cushions&apos;because they were being naughty&apos;(that&apos;s what they&apos;re up to just now. SIGH). better go...

much more to add re your other points but must get...HOMEWORK then BATHTIME underway...oh the fun never stops, does it?!

I haven&apos;t read all the posts, but just wanted to say that I seem to have a short fuse too. I have 2 ds and ds1 is the most demanding. I find that if I&apos;ve lost my temper it is best for me to say sorry to the kids. I tend to say sorry then explain why I got angry i.e. I was worried we were going to be late and I need to be at work on time today.

I also try to say yes more often. i.e.&apos;yes you can watch tele&apos;AFTER TEA!

Hope you feel a bit better about it. I think lots of mums shout and never ever say that they do.

rachel - your post re empathising and putting dc in your shoes really got me thinking....what a good piece of advice. Wish I&apos;d picked it up sooner as this afternoon, dd had a major strop because I used the doggy stamp on the orange playdoh before her (of course, it never crossed her mind to use it until I said all enthusiastically and excitedly - like you do - using the same tone of voice you might use if you&apos;d just seen George Clooney walking thro the door,&quot;Whooh, look at the lovely doggy stamp, I&apos;m going to use it on the orange doh&apos;. This was met by&quot;I want it&quot;by which time it was too late as the fateful imprint had been made....all hell let loose. DD stropped big time, I couldn&apos;t understand the fuss and just left her to it telling her rather sternly that she was silly - you are right, who am I to say it&apos;s silly - to her it so obviously was a big deal. Wow, have I learned a lot this past week!!

Acting - could your dds behaviour be largely attention seeking - the being in your face a lot and the drama queen behaviour at bathtime? Is she jealous of the time you spend with ds or maybe she&apos;s picked up on the fact that you perhaps aren&apos;t so wound up by him? Sounds like it may be a combo of that and also typical, inquisitive, draining 5 yr old behaviour. I have a friend who has a 5 yo dd who never stops talking. I had her for the day once and was mentally exhausted by the time she went home - she talked continuously about crap! Perhaps you could bath them separately on different nights - maybe if you made a bif fuss of it being her bath, make it really girlie with some of those bath sprinkles or bath bombs or something, she may co-operate a bit more?
Thanks again to all for your valuable contributions to this thread! Let&apos;s keep the support going!! x.

Ladies - some advice needed here, please.
We have been having trouble getting dd to go to bed for about 2 weeks now, since we decorated her bedroom and took the sides off her cot.

What should take 10 mins is taking 45! She has a story (while messing about, so that can take ages - changing mind over the book, getting out of bed, dictating exactly how it should be read - tonight I had&quot;Mummy, take your arm off my bed&quot;) then keeps calling us back for juice (it&apos;s in a cup by her bed), to ask silly questions but mostly to say she needs a wee/poo. I have started to tell her that if she asks for a poo/wee and dosn&apos;t do one, then the book I read for storytime goes in the bin. I have also told her that if she calls us back just to be silly, one of her dollies goes in the bin - but if she&apos;s good and goes to sleep without calling us back, she can have breakfast in the morning with said dolly. Am I being too harsh? Is 3 years old too young to be threatening to bin toys, can she understand this? (I&apos;m sure she can as she is sooo clued up, but }
It&apos;s driving me mad - by the time bedtime routine is over, half the night&apos;s gone - dh&amp;I haven&apos;t eaten yet!! It is also winding me up - all my mantras and everything went out the window tonight. we&apos;d just done a wee, cleaned potty, washed hands, back to bed and within a nanosecond, she asked for a poo. I told her if she didn&apos;t do one, Thomas the Tank book was heading for the bin - so she pushed me...and I smacked her bum ...once again, bad, crap mummy...what have I learned??? Again, it came from the blue - just really p&apos;d off with all the messing about. Didn&apos;t do a poo, so Thomas, as far as she&apos;s concerned, is in the bin. Once again, feel awful, just want to go and give her a big cuddle but she&apos;s now asleep and don&apos;t want to wake her for obvious reasons. will have to settl for a virtual cuddle. With time I am determined to conquer the red mist ...am I doing right to use the bin as a threat?
Thanks. x.

bedtime used to be awful in our house, it got to the point where she wouldnt go to sleep in her bed, it had to be on my bed and i would move her when i came to bed, she wouldnt go in her room, she would cry and scream to get out.

at the very worst she wouldnt go to bed till about 10.30, then wouldnt sleep unless i was with her and in my bed, by which time i was shattered and was looking up the supernanny routine where you keep putting them back to bed saying nothing.

she just changed, in a couple of nights she just decided she wanted to be in her bed and now goes to bed 7,7.30 every night.

what i am saying is, things will get better. we put a fish in dd&apos;s bedroom to help her feel safe.
i removed anything she said was scary and got her a big foam dora to stick on the door to help look after her.

hopefully your dd is just trying to string it out, try to be firm and consistant and she might get the message.

it cant be as bad as what we went through with our dd. and i never want her to go back to being like that, i need my time in the evening to wind down.

Her room and bed are different. It seems to me that she needs a bit of reassuring and that is why she is calling you back. You need to make her feel at ease at bed time which threats etc aren&apos;t going to.

Both my DCs went through a phase of being a bit scared of going to bed just after their third birthdays. They went to bed no trouble before then. With DS who was very articulate like your DD, we made sure he had everything he could possibly need before saying goodnight: box of tissues, cup of water etc. He used to suddenly get stomach ache at bedtime every night. Either invented (but a bit young for that) so probably just anxiety. So I would stress how close I was, how I could hear, would check on him while asleep etc to reassure him. Oh and kiss his tummy better of course!

balano you take me straight back to perth, australia, 2005, we&apos;re in a horrid rented house, all 1970s exposed brick and dark as a tomb, no support, no f**king sleep either bcs the kids (note how i blame them, dh and i are perfect of course )are so f**king dysfunctional ARGH, ie wake us throughout the night for no apparent reason (i once got up to them eight times, 5 and 3 apiece)- anyway DD is at that time 3 going on 4 and the night-time routine is followed very strictly until she is in bed, lights off...then the fun starts. tissues...potty..hungry..scared...terrified..don&apos;t leave me..monsters..heart stopping beating..thirsty...mummy are you there don&apos;t leave me...christ i do not KNOW how i survived that year.
my approach was to always try to reassure, simply bcs had been anxious child myself and&apos;felt her pain&apos;. trouble is i think i felt it too much and forgot to actually try to restore some sort of balance! but honestly she was so anxious that i couldn&apos;t really consider it naughtiness. and it gradually got better, as lizandlulu says.

what i find so interesting and challenging in all of this is what to consider naughtiness and what to consider infuriating but understandable anxiety (or tiredness or over-wroughtness or whatever). i still struggle with that. when they visited, my parents would silently sit there and i could feel them thinking&apos;i&apos;d soon sort her out if i had my way&apos;- but i remember so vividly my anxieties aged 4 and 5 getting short shrift from them and i want DD to remember an understanding mother (even though i will by then be in an early grave! well - even more reason to make those memories good ones )

Thanks both - neither of you sound smug! Liz - gosh, what you had to do makes by current bedtime routine a walk in the park! Hopefully, you are right and it is just a phase, maybe as you say otherside, as her room has changed and she&apos;s getting used to it.
It&apos;s just sometimes hard to shake the ridiculous notion that she&apos;s messing around to nark you....I know that&apos;s not the case but I can&apos;t help feeling cheesed off. Guess it&apos;s just the awareness that the prescious evening&apos;me&apos;time is ebbing away with each silly messing about moment!
Perhaps I am being harsh in threatening the bin for her toys - I&apos;m just desparate to try and get her to conform!!
Just going to have to ride this one out, I guess through gritted teeth with an angelic smile on my face and a potty in one hand and a beaker of juice in the other!!!

Katie - I agree - it is important to understand the difference between plain naughtiness and difficult behaviour brought on by anxiety or whatever. However, at the time, unfortunately, both can result in the same reaction - shouty mummy!! It&apos;s only afterwards on reflection and anlysis that you can rationalise their behaviour and then feel twice as bad! Oh for the ability to hold your child in suspended animation while you have time to calm down, assess the situation and then bahave appropriately. Wouldn&apos;t it be so much easier all round! Or even better wind back time to avoid the situation altogethe!!!

ActingNormal: re your bathtime woes and your DD moaning that it#s either too hot or too cold. Have you tried saying to her&quot;Well, DD, tonight when we run the bath we are going to do things a bit differently. Tonight, YOU are in charge of deciding when the bath is at the correct temperature for you to get into.&quot;

Re: your little morning motormouth! No advice but totally sympathise......that kind of behaviour from either of mine gets on my nerves the most when it interrupts a nice, cuddly peaceful little heart-to-heart with the other DS. I really resent it! Suppose it might be jealousy or something.

Point number 4 about the crafts, my 4 year old gets like that too. I THINK that he gets particulaly frustrated as he sees doing crafts as producing something totally original all by himself and usually which he gets loads of admiration and praise for. If you think about it, at that age, there are not a whole lot of activities which they are able/allowed to do without plenty of input from an adult. They can&apos;t be left alone in the kitchen to cook as too dangerous. They need coaching from someone at most sporting activities. My 4 year old has an unusual interest in cars and how they are made/work/are driven (he had to show me where the bonnet release button was the other week as I couldn&apos;t find it ), but of course, there&apos;s no way that little bit of future potential&quot;talent&quot;could be given any real outlet at the moment. With craft stuff, you can generally leave them totally in control of what they are producing, and they produce something original to them and so they are proud of the end result, and conversely really pissed off if it goes wrong.

Balanomorey, the messing about at bed time I think is just a typical 3 year old developmental stage. They are starting to learn so much about the world at the age, and it must be a bit frightening! (have you had the&quot;Mummy, do we all die? I don&apos;t want to die!!! WAAAHHH!&quot;conversation yet? That&apos;s an interesting one. Plus their imagination is really starting to run riot. My DS1 did exactly the same at that age, needing another drink, change of pymamas, different book, toilet again etc etc. Well, basically EVERYTHING on your list, every night. Any excuse as a delaying tactic. I&apos;d be careful of bringing any kind of punishment into the whole toilet issue if I were you. If I remember rightly, we just went with the needing the toilet thing till the phase passed, as I oculd never be sure if he really MIGHT need one. It&apos;s very annoying though, I agree. We didn&apos;t let him go into the bathroom time and time again though, just once or twice and each time gave him a minute or two and then shouted&quot;Right, I&apos;m starting this book now, you&apos;ll miss it if you&apos;re in the bathroom&quot;. And seeing as it was usually Thomas in our house too, he&apos;d come running. 

The other thing we always had at the time was a little chat about his day just before we said goodnight and left the bedroom. Sometimes it meant we could talk about any fears he had about stuff, but mainly I used the chat thing as leverage for his delaying tactics! i.e.&quot;Ooh, DS, if you keep going to the toilet or asking me for juice, we&apos;ll run out of time and we won&apos;t be able to have our little chat as it&apos;ll be too late.&quot;The threat of missing out on that was usually enough. NOW if I feel like chatting to him before leaving his room I get&quot;Mummy, will you please go downstairs now, you are a chatterbox and I am tired and just want to go to sleep!&quot; 

The other thing we still do which people are a bit about when we tell them, is STILL have a monitor in his room. He is 5 in a few months but frankly it is there acting as an intercom as we can talk back on it to him, reassuring his fears about daft stuff from the comfort of our sofa downstairs with a glass of wine in our hand. eg. For the past couple of weeks our nightly little monitor speech has been without fail&quot;Night, night, DS, I love you. Yes, the bees are all asleep. No, your heart won&apos;t stop beating any time soon.&quot;!!

Thank you for your ideas. Hello Mimizan .

I think it is right that DD wants more attention. Because she is so demanding I try to&apos;avoid&apos;her because I find it too much and she becomes even more demanding and we are in a vicious cycle. Then sometimes I give her loads of attention and she still wants more and more. Anyway I&apos;ve decided to try giving her short bursts of intensive attention, then say&quot;Now I need a bit of space and I&apos;m going to go and do x. I will come and talk to you again in a few minutes&quot;so that I get breaks and she might get used to trusting me that she will get attention at regular intervals and doesn&apos;t need to nag me when I&apos;m having my&apos;space&apos;. I tried this a while back but I seem to try knew things then lapse out of them again. The technique will probably need modifying as we go along.

I like the idea of letting DD wash herself in the bath and decide herself when the water is the correct temperature. I might also try the shower and see if she prefers that.

Having said all of that and feeling positive all morning and interacting with kids at playgroup, since DD came home from school I have been rubbish. I just REALLY don&apos;t want to play with them this pm I want them to play on their own and their aggravating each other constantly and whining is making me crazy. I know I should do something with them or even have a proper conversation with them and their behaviour would improve but I just can&apos;t make myself. I&apos;m not ill or particularly stressed about anything, I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m like this. Sometimes I SO need to be on my own. Builders have been here this week so I haven&apos;t had proper time on my own. They have just gone. Now I feel like saying&quot;right, now everyone piss off so I can be alone&quot;. It&apos;s definately me that&apos;s crap NOT the children.

AN- I feel as though I want the dc to leave me alone, even when they&apos;ve been at school all day. I think it is probably quite a common feeling. Obviously there will be some Mums who want to bake, paint, have discussions with their DC after school. However my Dc just want to play on their own or watch television.

I do have fleeting feelings of guilt while I come on Mumsnet, or cook the tea with the radio for company, but really deep down I know it is good for them to occupy themselves and chill out after a busy day of conforming at school.

Thanks rachel for your advice. Yup, guess it&apos;s another chestnut to ride out! Am resigned to the delaying tactics til she gets bored with it. Know what you mean about punishment and the potty - been saying book gets binned if you call us and you don&apos;t need the potty, but do worry that it could put her off calling us when she does need it and before we know it we are back in nappies again as I&apos;ve scared her off using the potty - just desparately trying anything, I guess! But she&apos;s probably too young to distinguish between fibbing and telling the truth. Sigh!!

So know what you mean acting re being all positive and fired up for a good day&apos;s interratcting with dd, then when it comes to it, feeling like you can&apos;t be bothered and craving space. I feel like that so often - partly becuase I think i simply don&apos;t know what to do with her...an afternoon indoors can seem like an eternity as her attention span is so short.

What do you all do with your dc&apos;s on a rainy afternoon? After CBeebies (which I&apos;m ashamed to say, i think I let her watch too much of as it&apos;s the easy option), making jelly/Barbie cakes or some other simple baking, reading books, colouring and painting, role playing dollies, CBeebies website, I don&apos;t know what else to do..Help!! She needs to be occupied - it&apos;s when she&apos;s bored that the trouble starts as that&apos;s when we get the messing about. Trouble is, she&apos;s never really engaged in ANYTHING that i feel she&apos;s found truly absorbing - is that more to do with her age?

Does she need supervision to use the potty?

Can you just leave it in her room overnight and empty it in the morning - remove all books and toys so there is nothing else to get up for~?

Ooh-er Smug! No way could I leave her unsupervised!! She can get herself on and off it OK, and could probably have a go at wiping herself (wees yes, poo I don&apos;t think she&apos;d do a good job and couldn&apos;t bear the thoughts of her going back to bed without having washed her hands!)..but I&apos;d be worried that she&apos;d empty the contents all over the floor or worse over herself. The potty isn&apos;t always used in the loo - sounds gross, but often have it in the lounge - a throwback to encouraging her to tyr using it, while watching CBeebies - so she&apos;s always tried to carry it into the loo to empty it. I have to make sure I&apos;m on hand to deal with it, as once or twice I&apos;ve not realised she&apos;s finished and she&apos;s tipped wee all over the carpet as she&apos;s been trying to take it to the loo. But thanks for the idea

Re bedtime delaying tactics - DD used to do this too. I say&quot;It&apos;s naughty to ask for more things after bedtime&quot;and&quot;If you keep shouting out I will come up and shut your door&quot;- she HATES that and it was a good deterrant. She can go and use the big toilet upstairs if she needs to now but when she couldn&apos;t we just left a potty in the room. We did let her keep doing multiple wees and asking us to empty it because we thought she wouldn&apos;t wet the bed then. She seemed to grow out of it. She has only ever wet the bed once!

rainy days are a n i g h t m a r e round here too...especially since there are so many of them these days, eg the ENTIRE BLOODY SUMMER! we do all the things you suggest then get hordes of pals round when things are really tough- i resign myself to the house getting trashed on the understanding that the favour gets repaid pretty soon. we also have a hamster and some new kittens - that helped to get through some of the summer at least, but slightly drastic action i admit if they&apos;re not in your master plan more generally!
and if all else fails i grit my teeth and take them to the softplay centre of course argh mine are a bit older now so play together much better so that helps loads. but those 13-hour days just seem interminable don&apos;t they!!

I go out alot with my DC. I find if we sit around the house all day we go crazy. I have friends who seem to spend days at a time at home during the holidays. Obviously their DC can&apos;t be as spirited as mine. 

From an early age we were going to museums, art galleries etc. Most of them are child friendly now, and fairly easy places to be. We go on the bus so it takes up lots of time. There&apos;s lots for the DC to look at, and if you are lucky nice people chat to them. TBH I really enjoy these kind of days out. We used to have a lovely children&apos;s department store in town with a cafe and soft play area. We&apos;d often spend 4 hours there. 

Getting out seems to reduce the mundane demands and the mess, which I find challenging.

but when i is raining it is hard to know what to do. apart from what you already mentioned, painting cooking etc.
what about gluing and sticking? my dd has found a love for sticky tape and just rips up peices of paper and sticks them back onto each other.

God, how quickly I&apos;ve forgotten those whole rainy days at home.....DS2 started nursery 3 mornings a week in Sept, and DS1 started school. I now have some time to myself and I can&apos;t tell you how nice it is (even if it&apos;s all taken up with doing cleaning/diy jobs that should have been done 5 years ago. I am already dreading the school holidays, how bad is that?! Cbeebies will be on more than ever. 

Mimizan, the museums and art galleries idea is fantastic! Esp if they&apos;re free. we&apos;ve done a couple of&quot;cultural&quot;type activities with the kids and they seem to love them. We quite often go into town on the train just cos both of them are train mad, and I can honestly say that one of the best days we have ever spent is going on the hunt for the SuperLambBananas in Liverpool city centre (that&apos;s where we&apos;re from - so just a short, cheapish train ride away and the lambanana thing just free and lasted a good few hours).

I know what you all mean about sometimes just not WANTING to play with your kids. I actually fell asleep 2-3pm today, woke up and panicked I was going to be late picking DS1 up from school, dragged DS2 out of his nap and he was grumpy, and rushed to school. Got home, only for DS1 to ask me to play football with him in the garden. Despite the little me-time nap I&apos;d had this afternoon, I just couldn&apos;t summon up the will to go outside with him. I just made excuse after excuse....&quot;Er, the grass is too wet.. I&apos;ve just made a cup of tea, I&apos;ll be out later. Oh, DS2 needs me... I&apos;ve just got to go to the toilet....Daddy will be home in a minute.....just got to get the tea on.&quot;Really, really bad, I know. A 5 min kick-about would have made DS1&apos;s day, and would not have been much effort, but I&apos;m just not much good at faking enthusiasm at his 10th goal. My excuse for this bad parenting is that DH has been away for the last few days and I haven&apos;t seen another adult except in the school playground, but really I know tis just an excuse....and not an actual reason.....

hey rachel - i came up by train ON MY OWN - bloody fantastic - to see the klimt exhibition a couple of months ago - a little treat to myself. great! and i thought the walker art gallery was fab too.

i take the kids by train a lot too - even to scotland a couple of times (from rural herefordshire) - i even managed centreparcs by train three weeks ago with them (our first trip) but had a nightmare when we changed trains at newport - had falled asleep while the two of them had gone off to the toilet on their own, giggling with glee at the prospect of doing poo&apos;s on the train ho ho ho. i was like&apos;great! they&apos;re finally old enough - i&apos;ll have a little rest&apos;- fell into one of those dribbly little naps, and next thing i know the bloody train&apos;s arrived in newport, they&apos;re still in the friggin&apos;BOG and i have to pack up all our bags in 5 seconds flat and literally drag DD off the toilet mid-cr*p! i almost had a stroke through the stress argh

Rachel- I&apos;m just the same with the football. We got a basketball net last christmas and I&apos;ve just joined a netball team. I should want to play with the DSs but just can&apos;t bring myself to get out there with them. There&apos;s always some excuse like a pile of washing to carry upstairs, or a pan to scrub. 
I sometimes wonder if the DC will look back and feel that the housework was more important to me than playing with them. 

I take them to the park nearly every day, but sit and talk to other adults while they play.

I enjoy reading to them, visiting places and general chat, just can&apos;t seem to do play. I like making things like junk models and christmas cards with them though so I suppose that&apos;s OK.

We&apos;ve got an adult friend who will play imaginary games with the DC for hours on end. She also keeps them entertained by telling stories about when she was a little girl. It makes me feel inadequate, because I get bored so easily and can only remember a few childhood stories.

This thread is making me laugh! I thought I was the only one who made excuses to her DC&apos;s to not play with them. It is just so BORING playing in the garden with them or hide and seek etc. My excuse is that I need the loo and I disappear upstairs for as long as possible. I feel awful for not wanting to play with them but I don&apos;t, what can I do?

I am looking forward to them getting a bit older, when we can go out without a buggy, hop on the train and go to museums etc like some of you have said. I think you have to try and find things you both enjoy rather than purely child orientated activities, but when they are very young it does seem to consist of soft play centres etc.

Well, I&apos;m glad I&apos;m not the only one to feel like this, has made me feel a whole lot better. Especially the thing about still not wanting to play with DD even after she has been at school all day. Trouble with my DD is that she talks SO MUCH and most of it is just boring waffle, I think she just likes the sound of her own voice and having someone listen to her, she doesn&apos;t realise that she has to make it interesting in order to hold someone&apos;s attention...I guess it&apos;s the equivalent of the phrase&apos;a face only a mother could love&apos;, only in her case it&apos;s&apos;boring drivel only a mother could listen to for hours on end&apos;,

oneplusone - it&apos;s important to get in touch with your inner child-induced boredom, and this is the thread to do it on!!
i am exactly the same, but i have luckily come out of the tunnel of ENDLESS imaginary play during which your adult mind switches off for hours on end - my kids are that little bit older and up for excursions and also play together loads (at last, at last - i knew there was a reason i had two children !)so hang in there, it does get better!
i reckon the sooner we can encourage to do that imaginary play thing with each other (sibs or other kids) the better. has to be the key to everyone&apos;s sanity and happiness!! but yes, sometimes easier said than done...

Haven&apos;t read whole thread, but just wanted to say aside from dealing with DD have you been to the doctors recently about your physical pain. I have a chronic back pain and have done pain management in the past. Was getting V sore again with all the lifting/picking up stuff for spirited DD 2.5. Took ages to get around to seeing Doc about it as I thought there was nothing else they could do for me, but actually got some fabby new painkillers which has enabled me to be a much more serene happy mummy as my body isn&apos;t so F**king sore.

I think that it is important to try to keep shouting to an absolute minimum so that it still has the shock factor. That way if they run at the road or try to touch the oven you know they will pay attention and stop. I am struggling with this myself.

I find it helps me when i expect everything to take 3 times as long - even if it makes me late, i feel better for expecting to be late.

And when you feel angry and tensing up, just try to unclench your teeth and relax your muscles a bit, i know it&apos;s hard and i have to try really hard with it myself but the more you do it the easier it gets and you will feel so much more in control!

The fact that you are addressing the situation shows how much you really love and care for your DD, i&apos;m sure you are a great mummy and hope things are easier for you soon!

I hate people like that! They make feel useless and inadequate too but I am also grateful to them for doing what I find myself totally unable to with the DC&apos;s. But I also find that I sometimes think adults who enjoy doing things with kids that i find so utterly boring must really be a little mad!

I am glad to say that recently we have bought a few board games for DD and I have found i actually enjoy playing snakes and ladders etc with her. It is a relief as so far i have hated : arts and crafts, baking, role play, the garden, the playground. I was beginning to get really worried as i seemed to hate doing anything with my DC&apos;s apart from putting on music and having a dance and a sing (although i would kind of go into my own world then and almost forget DC&apos;s were there so probably doesn&apos;t count as enjoying doing s&apos;thing with DC&apos;s)

oneplusone and mimi - was about to retire to the sofa with my book and post-go-ape recovery glass of wine, but had to say ... mimi - go ape - it was semi-terrifying and semi-fun, and - mainly - bloody COLD! do not go on a saturday! lots of waiting around groin to groin (clothed and harnessed but still - a little unsettling) with perfect strangers on platforms the size of hankies about 50 m above the ground, while rain lashes your face and the wind makes the tree sway ! still, you do feel v proud when you finally get down to terra firma and - lo! - you are still alive and in one piece.i plan to take my not-quite-so-pathologically-spirited child aged ten, and the fully-worthy-of-the-term child aged about 35.

oneplusone i love your list of&apos;things i have hated to do with my DC thus far&apos;it made me giggle heartily. arts and crafts instantly result in world war three so i loathe them too. i actually like baking bcs am so greedy and can tolerate the playground by going into a meditative world of my own. i LOVE head-banging with them in the kitchen to music though! esp&apos;dude looks like a lady&apos;by aerosmith (shhh!). board games have been a bit of a godsend this rain-sodden summer but i can&apos;t say i&apos;m overly keen. needs must eh?

balano - i just remembered the original posting and felt guilty about chatting away about cr*p on your thread when i should be suggesting anger-related stuff. i have a good&apos;un - meditation. what do you think? do i sound a bit weird and new-agey all of a sudden? i started it two years ago when my mid-life crisis related to the catastrophic time i was having w DD aged 4 or 5 was at its full-blown peak and i was an anxious, insomniac, questioning-of-the-meaning-of-life wreck. it is really helpful in a strange and not easily explained, indirect way. i only manage about 15 mins before falling into bed and am still terrible at pushing away the constant inner chatter that insists on intruding all the time but i do recommend it.

on which worthy note, back to the wine (you can see i&apos;m not quite a fully signed-up buddhist yet hic !)

Talking about activities which we do with our kids which we actually quite enjoy....watching crap on Saturday night telly like I&apos;d do Anything, and X Factor.

Hello all, I am just posting on here so I know where to come when I am feeling my inner rage demon, which is usually when I am desperate for the loo and trying to herd my dc up the flights of stairs to our flat&apos;s front door, while trying to find my keys in my bag with my mobile ringing simultaneously.

I have also tried the mantra thing someone mentioned much earlier and it is working a little bit. I have also learnt to ease up on my ds (3) and to not always be saying no to him.

But I have a bit of a theory to my anger and its definitely to do with a pfb-type thing. He changed my life completely, and in so many ways that I could never have prepared for, in good and bad. But if I am completely honest I harbour some sort of resentment towards him for taking away my old life, that doesn&apos;t apply to my dd (21 mths) as it had already been taken away. I know this is a terrible confession, but pls don&apos;t think I don&apos;t love my ds, I do, passionately.

I just need to learn to adjust, and its taking a lot longer than I thought.

And I hate it when people say,&apos;don&apos;t wish these years away, they won&apos;t come back&apos;. I always think good, they&apos;re too flipping hard, while simultaneously feeling crippled with guilt that I am wishing my children&apos;s lives away. I am so much happier when ds is at nursery and I have a bit of space between us, is that so terrible?

Dear Baloneymorey

i think that you&apos;ve been really honest with your posts&amp;this is one of your strengths. i wasn&apos;t sure whether to post or not but i am a professional working in child psychology&amp;felt that ethically i could not ignore this post.

As well as the excellent and thoughtful comments others have posted on this thread
imo you do need some professional help asap with your anger and the way that you are relating to your dd otherwise she will certainly experience negative long term consequences.

It seems that your own life experiences are impacting in an detrimental way on your way of relating to her. If you do something about this now there will be a good chance of turning things around as she is still very young.

You can ask your gp to refer you to counselling/therapy. What you describe is not a healthy situation and will undoubtedly already be having an negative impact on dd self esteem. You may also have a family/children&apos;s centre in your area that can offer you support. From what you say I don&apos;t think you can make these changes on your own and it&apos;s imperative for your dd emotional and psychological well being that this situation changes.

Just because other people are treating their children in an abusive way does not mean that it makes it ok.

I can see that there are benefits in the supportive tone on this thread, but I think it has become a bit weird and self-congratulatory. As I said before, I was shouted at all the time as a child and it was awful and frightening and I think it has turned me into an anxious adult. I&apos;ve been thinking about it much more now that I&apos;m a parent myself and I can&apos;t believe how awfully my dps treated us, considering that they are basically good people and loving parents.

Just to add another suggestion, which may not be very easy, maybe all the posters who are complaining should try to deal with their dcs with more humour. What does it matter if they want to wear sparkly princess dresses? Why shouldn&apos;t it be seen as cute rather than a cue for a fight. I&apos;ve seen little girls at playgroup wearing long sleaves under their fairy dresses so they don&apos;t have to be cold. Calling parents back at bedtime is normal, you don&apos;t have to get angry about it. My ds (who takes an hour to get to sleep and we have to stay with him) has started to spend bedtime repeatedly telling me his hand/eye/head ect is sore and asking me to kiss it better. It gets annoying but I tell myself it won&apos;t be long before he won&apos;t want me to kiss him at all.

And give up on the easy life. It&apos;s not easy and it&apos;s not going to be but it becomes much less difficult if you readjust your expectations.

Twinklelittlestar, I think you may have frightened some people off by suggesting they are treating their children in an abusive way. 

My impression of this thread is that people have been honest about how they find parenting challenging at times. Not all the time but sometimes they find it hard to cope. For all you know they may be getting counselling or therapy already to address this. They may be finding it helpful to have other parents to talk to anonymously about some of things they find difficult. Sometimes this can be more effective than a session with a professional.

The thread has not just become a forum to moan about the DC. Posters have also made suggestions and given advice to Balanmorey.

tryingtoleave- I agree with using humour as a strategy to manage behaviour. However sometimes with all the will in the world there are days when using humour is very difficult. Those days when you have been on your own for extended periods, the DC are unsettled by something external, you are knackered, feel isolated and stressed. Sometimes it&apos;s hard to be calm. Mothers are human beings, and human beings do get cross. I don&apos;t advocate shouting, and I don&apos;t shout very often but I am not going to feel that I am abusive to my DC because I sometimes shout at them to get their shoes on

Thanks again for all the posts - it&apos;s difficult for me to find the quality time to log on regularly as dh or dd always around - dh taken dd to soft play this afternoon so I have some space!

Katie - don&apos;t feel you&apos;ve&apos;hijacked&apos;the thread at all! You chat about anything you like - all your posts have been very helpful and often amusing and I love reading them. It&apos;s been interesting to read about how you all entertain your dd&apos;s and comforting to know that, once again, I&apos;m not alone in finding it hard to occupy a wilfull child!

In answer to your question rachel, I can honestly say there isn&apos;t much I really enjoy doing with dd at the moment as I haven&apos;t hit on that thing that she gets absorbed in. Whatever play I initiate is over within 20 mins tops! I do enjoy watching her role play with dollies tho - that&apos;s always fun as I love hearing the little chats she has with them as she&apos;s making them tea and preparing their imaginary sarnies!!

Twinkle - can&apos;t help feeling a little shocked at the directness of your posts - it has made me feel sick to my stomach to hear that in the opinion of a professional, I need help quickly or dd will be scarred for life by my shouting. I&apos;m certainly not condoning my behaviour and know 2 wrongs don&apos;t make a right, but I&apos;m obviously not alone in how I feel sometimes and the feelings I have experienced are not uncommon - are they? Just want to clarify that only on one occasion have I lost the plot like I did last week (when I pushed the chair etc). Dh says I&apos;m too harsh on myself and maybe my purpose in posting is to remonstrate with myself that I shout at all - but am I being realistic - surely a certain amount of shouting IS normal and necessary when bringing up a child, although I wish I didn&apos;t do it. Sounds like I&apos;m trying to make excuses for myself - don&apos;t get me wrong, I have really been examining my behaviour this past week or so and WANT to tone down my shouting - but it&apos;s something I&apos;ll be working on without the help of the pros, thank you!

Dear Balanomorey

To clarify I thought I needed to be direct as many other posters seemed to be normalising the type of behaviour you described in your initial and subsequent posts.

I&apos;m a little confused though as you now say you have only lost the plot once but in your initial post you said that this was something that was happening continually&amp;on a regular basis. I quote from your original post:

&apos;However, as I said all this continual conflict of interest is wearing me down as I am constantly saying no and shouting to the point where she will say&apos;don&apos;t shout at me&apos;before bursting into tears or she will panic if she knows or thinks she&apos;s done something wrong as she will say&quot;sorry, sorry, sorry&quot;over and over and looks genuinely scared I&apos;m going to tear her off a strip.&apos;

Only you know how you are treating your DD. It was just from your original postings I felt ethically responsible to let you know that this is not ok for you DD&amp;there will be long term consequences as tryingtoleave describes in her own experience. This poster did have the experience of her parents shouting at her all of the time&amp;has had long term consequences as a result, specifically with issues of self-esteem. I was also aware that many of the other posters were normalising this behaviour&amp;saying it was ok. When it is not.

I get the impression that there is a need to try&amp;silence individuals who don&apos;t believe that it is ok to treat children in this way. It is afterall an abuse of power relations if we are not talking about the occasional incident. Everyone does get angry/cross of course but there are different ways to deal with this rather than taking it out on tiny children even if the parent is stressed this does not make it acceptable. It will also not change the fact that this type of relating from a parent will have long term consequences for self esteem&amp;their development.

Hi Twinklelittlestar 

Can I have some free professional advice please? If I describe the main scenario where I lose it( it&apos;s getting the 3 DC out to school in the mornings), will you advise me?

Twinklelittlestar:&quot;I was also aware that many of the other posters were normalising this behaviour&amp;saying it was ok. When it is not.&quot;I don&apos;t think that posters have been saying it has been ok to treat children like that. Personally, my posts have advised Balanomorey doing her utmost not to let her DD see her anger manifest itself, hence suggesting she goes upstairs to calm down etc etc. I think most people have said that they have experienced AN incident themselves of getting very shouty with their child and regretting it, and they have talked about things which have stopped those incidents arising again. Something which you yourself comment on:&quot;Everyone does get angry/cross of course but there are different ways to deal with this rather than taking it out on tiny children.&quot;

As such, I really don&apos;t think this comment is necessary:&quot;I get the impression that there is a need to try&amp;silence individuals who don&apos;t believe that it is ok to treat children in this way.&quot;If you are referring to the people who have posted on this thread, then I&apos;m not sure we are reading the same version of it! From what I have read, and I have read all the posts, the general gist is&quot;Don&apos;t beat yourself up about it if you have lost it just the once and are trying to change your behaviour. We all get angry as parents from time to time. Here are some strategies that may help you....&quot;

Having said all that, I did actually re-read all of Balanomorey&apos;s posts and it does seem that it seems to be happening fairly often. Or at least HAS been happening fairly often up until the point of posting this week. She has said that she is putting people&apos;s suggested strategies into practice so would it not be more sensible for a professional like yourself to advise that if she does NOT see any improvements in her own behaviour or her DD&apos;s anxious behaviour pretty soon through trying to change on her own, THEN she should really see a professional to help her?

When I talk about losing the plot I am referring to the&apos;throwing the items&apos;incident after the debarcle over the chocolate at the garage...to me, that was totally unacceptable behaviour that has only happened once and will never happen again. I wondered if this is what you were juding me on

The&apos;continual shouting&apos;I referred to in my original post is the day to day getting frustrated stuff - yes, it happens quite a lot but the use of the word&apos;continual&apos;was maybe not the right one to use - I didn&apos;t mean literally continual. I&apos;m not shouting all the time from dawn til dusk, but I have a wearing, demanding child and my fuse is a little shorter than I&apos;d like it to be, so I do my fair share of raising my voice

My reason for posting was to see if I&apos;m alone in this - it appears I am not. I shout more than I&apos;d like to - I&apos;m quite judgemental of myself. DH says not to worry and thinks the level of shouting in our house is probably typical of lots of households with a demanding 3 yo. Maybe he&apos;s right, maybe it&apos;s not OTT - but at the moment to me it is and it&apos;s making me sad. Which is why I posted to see if I could work out if it is fairly normal - I think it is! I guess what I&apos;m trying to say is&apos;I acknowledge I shout, but is the picture really black enough to warrant counselling?&apos;Although I do shout and occasionally smack, I am a loving, demonstrative, caring mum too - dson;t that go some way to redressing the balance?

I&apos;m sure you felt you were posting for all the right reasons..however, I feel aggrieved to be honest that you can make such a sweeping statement on a forum such as this and tell me I have probably damaged my child through my actions...without having discussed this in depth with me on a one to one basis and seen and assessed the behaviour of my dd and the way in which we interract with each other. I have found that extremely upsetting and unhelpful. I could have accepted the suggestion to go and discuss anger management or maybe attend a course to deal with my shouting - but to categorically state dd will have been damaged already is gut wrenching - where&apos;s your proof? I am now left in a place I&apos;d really rather not be - feeling worse than I ever did before I posted.

Hi I&apos;ve just noticed this thread. Well done for your original post Balonamorey. It sounded to me as if you were fully aware that you were&apos;losing it&apos;at times and not acting well with your DD. Why else would you post a self aware, honest account of it and seek advice/support from others?

TwinkleTLS: I think:

a) you are being too heavy with the OP. You may indeed mean to write from an ethical standpoint and be worried that people are trying to&apos;normalise&apos;what amounts to abusive behaviour and want to redress a balance on this, but I think you are going too far the other way by trying to shock/scare Balonamorey into thinking she has already damaged her DDs self esteem.

b) I feel very suspicious of professional mental health people advising people in this capacity on message boards like MN. I am also a mental health professional and it would be against my code of ethics to engage in any unsolicited counselling/diagnosing (virtually ). I think you have a personal angle/investment in this subject, probably, because you are behaving unprofessionally.

Have just read your last post BM, I&apos;m sorry you feel worse than you did before you posted and feel you really don&apos;t have to take what she said on board at all. If TTLS really is a professional working in child psychology she should know better than to make the kind of assessment she made of you and your daughter&apos;s situation without - as you so rightly said - having had any real life interaction with you or professional engagement.

twinkle.

had i been balanomorey and woken up to your post this morning, i am not sure i would have ever come near the mumsnet site again. i would certainly have been extremely upset, feeling harshly judged, guilty beyond reason and generally crushed.

it is a tribute to her strength of character that she has posted again, though i myself am reconsidering whether to participate in these forums in the future, and can&apos;t be the only one.

i second skydancer whole-heartedly. i am a gp with a strong interest in mental health. i think that, while your intentions may well be honourable, your comments are over-the-top and potentially very damaging to balanomorey.

&apos;abuse&apos;is a highly emotive term. surely we both know from experience that abuse is much, much likelier to be found in households where communication with the outside world is dysfunctional and - very often - lacking completely? while balanomorey fully accepts she is currently having difficulties, the best thing she could have done was open up about these and throw them out to the floor, so to speak.

i don&apos;t deny that shouting to excess is far from ideal (my own issues are not actually with anger,but my situation overlaps a lot with balano&apos;s in the sense of dealing with a highly spirited child, and feeling frequently overwhelmed by the challenges that presents); i do deny that posters on this site have been trying to normalise this - i think balanomorey has had a lot of thoughtful, compassionate and warm advice. she knows she needs to make changes and is already on the way to doing so.

i think it quite likely that some who may perhaps have been considering professional help may now be put off, worried they may be judged and labelled as abusive. that is a great shame and surely the opposite of what you intended by posting as you did.

i do hope, balanomorey, that you won&apos;t feel&apos;worse than ever i did before posting&apos;for long. that would be a really, really sad outcome if so.

Balanomorey, you musn&apos;t feel bad. You have only behaved in the way many of us other Mums have done, and will do. To label it abusive is laughable.

Perhaps Twinkle&apos;s DC is not spirited, or still a baby and she has yet to experience first-hand some difficult behaviour.

just wanted to add, twinkle, that you must be aware of the difficulty in this country and especially on the NHS of accessing any sort of family therapy without having problems on a really pretty major scale. resources are stretched to their limit as it is dealing with the problems of autism, adhd, childhood depression and so on - there is no way that every family dealing with spirited children and their own reactions to said kids could access&apos;professional help&apos;even if they wanted to, unless they could pay privately.

we once asked a child psychologist to assess our DD when we were feeling particularly helpless and it cost us£90 - i am not saying that was unreasonable (i know lawyers etc cost£200/hour) just that it is way beyond the reach of the average family especially in the current economic climate. in our own case things improved steadily with time, stability and patience, but it&apos;s been a really long haul and i could have done with input from a site like this when things were bad.

Thank you for these supportive posts - yet again, my spirits have been raised by you all.

I guess when you do bare your soul on a site such as this, you do lay yourself open to all kinds of criticism and acvice. I&apos;m not blind to my faults, that&apos;s why I&apos;m here. I also am not so stupid as to expect to only hear what I want to hear....but I think each and every poster deserves to be treated with consideration..sorry, twinkle, once again I&apos;m sure your intentions were honourable, but I hope you won&apos;t dish out professional advice willy nilly like this again....it really didn&apos;t help me at all.

Thank you skydance and katie for your much kinder professional opinions - i am trying to replace the idea that dd is damaged with the idea that she (please God) isn&apos;t as advocated by you both.

All this has just made me more determined than ever to say 2 fingers to shouty mummy! When dd came back from soft play, I couldn&apos;t stop cuddling her...God, she means more to me than life, I couldn&apos;t bear it if I&apos;ve messed with her mind

balanomorey I am glad your spirits have been raised (don&apos;t know about spirited children but spirited mothers are now coming to mind . I think your intention and huge wish not to harm your DD combined with such obvious (the way you write about her) love for her will see you through this and to to finding some better strategies to help you deal with frustrations, stress and flash-points. I&apos;m speaking simply as a sympathetic mumsnetter with a two year old son who challenges my patience a lot but I adore him. I&apos;m still learning how to be a mum and to be more patient. Let&apos;s be kind to one another on here. Being kind doesn&apos;t have to equal being collusive.

Katiek123 good posts and points you made. A good thread altogether I think.

Personally, I feel Twinkle has crossed boundaries of professional ethics to remonstrate on an internet site without really knowing you or your DD. However, harsh as it was and I certainly don&apos;t agree with it I suppose at the least it has made you think harder about the potential consequences of your actions which maybe is a good thing. Ignore advice you don&apos;t feel helpful but I guess I am trying to ensure that your child is always of paramount importance.

No matter how hard they try us and mine certainly does too. We have to remember they are the most precious things in the world to us and would hate to damage them in any way. I admit particularly in the early days my temper was too evident and I think it was only when I realised how this negatively affected my DD&apos;s behaviour that I realised I had to be calmness personified. I don&apos;t achieve this all the time, I am human but I think for the majority of the time I am a calm and rational human being and since this realisation DD&apos;s behaviour has also changed for the better.

She is and always will be hard work but the rewards are so worth it. Your DD sounds adorable too and I know you are trying really hard to keep control of your temper and it&apos;s great that you&apos;ve admitted it and asked for help. So I guess I am saying keep using this forum, both the good and bad posts, to help yourself to gain perspective and ideas on how best to manage your DD. No one is perfect and we can all learn from each other.

Balanomorey, I am so glad that you have not been put off taking an active part in this thread. It has been one of the best threads I have seen on Mumsnet in a long time.

&quot;I couldn&apos;t bear it if I&apos;ve messed with her mind.&quot;I think you know in your heart of hearts that you won&apos;t have done that. Just as an example, my mum didn&apos;t have much patience with me and my sister when we were kids. She freely admits she was very shouty (quite a young mum so maybe less mature for that reason?) She smacked us quite often when her patience ran out too if we were being naughty, and even sometimes out of embarrassment if we were cheeky to her in front of one of her friends or something. She freely admits that they were the reasons she did it and now is very because of it. I don&apos;t know what her thought processes were at the time, but there was no mumsnet to help reassure her that she wasn&apos;t a terrible person for being human. I truly love her dearly and we are very close. I personally don&apos;t hit my kids for various reasons, but none of them include&quot;because it psychologically damaged me as a child&quot;!!! My mum is now the best nana you have ever seen and has infinite patience with her grandkids. Through her own experience she knows that being a parent is a very stressful job and that as a grandparent she naturally has much more patience as she is not the main carer of the child.

Balanomorey, I think you also have to realise that some children are more sensitive to a telling-off than other kids. My 4 year old crumples if I so much look at him sideways, and my 2 year old just laughs if I shout at him. Please don&apos;t let these so called&quot;professionals&quot;put you off Mumsnet. People on here are SO glad you had the guts to post so honestly and discuss your feelings and you are so self-aware. Thanks for this thread.

Wow I&apos;m shocked! I&apos;m not sure what I think.

I don&apos;t like the accusation that I (as one of the posters on this thread) have tried to normalise behaviour bordering on abusive towards our kids. I hope that I have described how things are with my kids and shown regret and concern over the fact that my behaviour might be abusive. And yes, I am one of the ones who is in therapy to try to improve my relationships with DCs and DH.

I feel shocked to be reminded that if I carry on the way I have been then it may be abusive and my children may become psychologically damaged. I SO hope they are not already damaged! I suppose this shock of being reminded helps me to feel more determined to get it sorted.

But it really does worry me that people will be put off talking about things like this because of these judgemental posts. These are things people find really hard to admit to and if they don&apos;t get as far as admitting it then they won&apos;t be able to solve it. On MN people usually get support and encouragement and feel able to talk about their worries when they don&apos;t feel like they can tell anyone in RL. If they start feeling like they can&apos;t say it on here either then there will be no outlet and the pent up feelings that will be unleashed on their loved ones will be even worse!

Apart from all that, I want to thank the people who advised me on bathtimes with my DD. I tried some of your ideas this afternoon. Instead of doing bathtime at the last minute when we are all tired and irritable and I want to get it done as quickly as possible and have no tolerance, I first of all tried doing it much earlier while I still had some energy (even though didn&apos;t go to bed till 4.30am this morning).

I did bathtime as a special activity for just me and DD for her to have some extra attention while DS played with DH. I&apos;m hoping if she has regular slots of one to one attention she might be less attention seeking.

Because she screams about the water temperature (usually) I ran the bath to the temperature I thought was ok and then asked her to test it and tell me if she thought it was ok. She asked for more cold, tested it, asked for more cold, then said it was ok. She then got in calmly and was completely happy with it! I was amazed!

I then got her to wash herself instead of me doing it and she was really proud to be doing something grown up, much more capable at it than I had thought, and it distracted her from being angry about anything. It felt really good to see how much it pleased her. She even washed her own hair and she did get some water in her eyes but because she felt more in control of things she coped with it!

I then asked her if she was warm enough or needed more hot water in there (she didn&apos;t), then let her play with bath toys and bubbles while I cleaned the toilet and sink. Because I was occupied myself I wasn&apos;t rushing her and she could just enjoy it.

When she got out I wrapped her in towels and cuddled her til she felt warm enough so no screaming then either. I realised I hadn&apos;t been this loving with her for ages and not as often as with DS and felt sad, but happy I was doing it now. She even let me cut her toe nails with no crying because she was so calm.

The whole thing was enjoyable and improved our relationship, I couldn&apos;t believe the difference! And I felt so much better about myself that I had done bathtime without becoming a person I hate. Without this thread this would not have happened! So Twinkle I don&apos;t think this thread makes&apos;bad&apos;parents worse!

Also earlier DD was nagging and demanding and I wanted to go on MN for a bit after coming back from taking them out for breakfast (at midday so it turned into breakfast-lunch). I tried that thing of saying I just want a bit of space while I do this and if you let me do it for a bit without nagging I will come and spend some time with you in a bit. This worked as well. I didn&apos;t feel so irritated by the boredom of joining in with her game because I felt my needs had been taken care of as well and it was fair. I felt like I was doing something good for her and teaching her to understand that I need space too.

All this with a hangover and only a couple of hours sleep [smug]. I&apos;m sure it will all go wrong again tomorrow .

But again, I want to say, it is this thread which has motivated me to really get on with doing practical things to improve my relationship with DD and I am uneasy about the thread being&apos;threatened&apos;by posts with a judgemental and unsupportive tone. Surely there could have been a&apos;nicer&apos;way to say what you wanted to say Twinkle?

Dear Balanamorey

I am sorry if I caused distress to you and also to the other posters on this thread. My wish was to draw your attention to the needs of your dd. It was not my intention to do this in a way that was not helpful to you. ON reading your post I was concerned for wellbeing of your child.

In your original post that you were explaining that your own life experiences were having a negative impact on the expectations you had of your dd and also the ways this was leading you to relate to her. From the very open way you described how she was responding to your behaviour I thought it imperative that you sought help quickly for yourself in order for this not to have long term consquences for your dd.

I suggested that you might seek counselling/therapy for yourself(not your dd) to process some of your own life experiences/expectations. As you know this is not easy to do on your own&amp;counselling sessions are often available in your local area free of charge or in some cases for a nominal fee&amp;your gp would be able to guide you in the right direction. I also thought that you might be able to get some support from your local children&apos;s centre who often provide parenting support classes etc.

To clarify from what you described from in your OP I did not suggest that your daughter needs to see a psychologist/or other professional as it would seem that from what you have said that she is a very normal little girl and is responding to this situation in a way that is appropriate.

I do believe that how we parent has an impact on our children both positive&amp;negative&amp;therefore the behaviour you described in your original post will be having an impact on her but as I said she is still very young&amp;if you address this now the relationship can blossom.

Again sorry for any distress caused to you&amp;the other posters. However I do continue to feel that on this thread thread there has been an imbalance of posters highlighting the emotional needs of parents at the expense of the child. I was trying to address this balance.

Hi Twinklelittlestar. Sorry you didn&apos;t answer or address any of the points made or questions concerning giving advice in a&apos;professional&apos;capacity to perfect strangers on a message board.

I do not agree with you or see what you are referring to when you say:&quot;there has been an imbalance of posters highlighting the emotional needs of parents at the expense of the child&quot;. This thread started with someone asking if people thought she needed some anger management and whether her feelings were normal or shared by others on here. I thought the responses were very balanced, thoughtful and considerate looking both at the parent and child&apos;s perspective and feelings. People were both responding to BM and her dilemnas and sharing their own feelings/experiences about dealing with their own DCs.. I thought the original poster was wonderfully honest about her own failings in managing her angry emotions/actions, remorseful about any bad effect she may be having on her DD and seeking feedback from others about whether they had similar experience and how they might deal with similar stuff better. This made for a very interesting, open and useful discussion.

I think it would be a great shame if people felt inhibited now about sharing their experiences on this theme for fear of being pathologised, criticised as caring only for themselves and not their DCs or even worse - accused of being abusive. By the way, I regarded the original poster&apos;s experiences to be well within the bounds of normality.

Hi all. Thanks for all your further posts. This morning after a night&apos;s sleep and a bit of reflection, I really felt initially that I didn&apos;t want to come back on and post anymore. Am so grateful for all the posts but I almost feel this subject has been covered from every angle and wondered what else we could squeeze out of the thread. But it is a support and it is nice to know it&apos;s there to share the good and the bad, so will keep looking in on it.

Yesterday&apos;s rather unpleasant afternoon&apos;s posting has, as some of you say, been a further wake up call for acknowledging the need to chill out and ease up on dd. While I&apos;ve been extremely upset by what you said twinkle and think you&apos;ve been extremely unprofessional, it&apos;s made me more determined to put it right.

Thanks Acting for the honesty of your post - so glad bathtime was such a positive experience for you and dd, seems like you&apos;ve really cracked a hard nut!!

Twinkle - you may well have thought that you were helping me by posting and for that I thank you for taking the time to do so...but it was darned unprofessional to make an assessment based on the scanty facts I typed on the back of a rant. Yes, I do have a bit of emotional baggage and I might want an easy life - who dosn&apos;t? - but bottom line, it&apos;s dds wilfulness that&apos;s draining me - and baggage or not, I need to deal with it more effectively. i realise that 100%

You state you did not suggest dd needs any phsychology - but you did say&quot;It seems that your own life experiences are impacting in an detrimental way on your way of relating to her&quot;&amp;&quot;What you describe is not a healthy situation and will undoubtedly already be having an negative impact on dd self esteem.&quot;...so do you mean because of me, she might need some one day? You have made me feel like she will do You then seem to backtrack a bit by saying that she&apos;s normal and is responding as you might expect . I&apos;m a little confused.
I would also like to take the opportunity to defend the posters on this thread - not once have I felt redeemed in any way that others have admitted being tried and tested by their dc&apos;s behaviour too. It&apos;s just gone some way to make me feel that it isn&apos;t too abnormal to feel like I sometimes do, although I might shout a bit more than others. I still appreciate the problem I have and want to sort it out.

Thanks skydancer - you have been the person that has stopped me from really feeling like a failure over all this. Thank you for saying you feel my behaviour is&quot;within the bounds of normality&quot;- it won&apos;t make me complacent and I want to change but thank you for reassuring me that I am human and vaguely normal.x.

I may have a breather for a bit as my head&apos;s spinning a bit with all this - need time to read and digest all the info for a bit...will be back sometime soon. x.

I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m posting again, I&apos;ll probably just get in trouble, but this thread is really getting to me.

I think you need to stop taking refuge in the idea that your toddlers are unusually&apos;spirited&apos;or&apos;wilful&apos;and that if they weren&apos;t you might have an easier life. They sound fairly normal.

I can understand sometimes why mother was so angry when we were young. She had three children under 5, the youngest with SN, and was thousands of miles from her family and friends. But maybe she would have been the same anyway. And when things should have got easier, when we were older, nothing changed. My parents could and fairly often did reduce us to tears at the dinner table shouting about some minor matter. Before you decide that everything is normal think about the relationship you want to have in 10 or 15 years with your daughter.

Actually I should say that I do have a fairly good relationship with my parents now. But this may be partly because I live in a different city, partly because, tragically, the death of my middle sister five years ago made us all need each other that much more and also partly because they did also always make it clear that they loved us. (My friend whose parents shouted much less but told her she was fat and ugly has way more ishooes). But they will never never acknowledge that there was anything wrong in the way they brought us up.

I think I should probably leave this thread now, it is certainly bringing out what issues I do have...

I am not a naturally&apos;angry&apos;person, ie someone with an angry grumpy demeanor, it&apos;s just not me. I&apos;m like someone else when I get angry - that&apos;s probably why I don&apos;t like it. When dd is being a good girl I am not angry. Before I had dd, I was not angry. My patience IS tested BECAUSE my dd IS wilful - that&apos;s just the way it is and I&apos;m trying to address this. I do not shout at my dd or get angry with her for no reason - the frequency of my anger correlates with the number of times per day she does something naughty/dangerous/says something inappropriate etc etc etc. As a parent, I have to set boundaries and am trying to find a different path to the shouting/smacking one - that is all this is about. I am not abusive. I do not shout at dd just becuase I feel like it. I am trying to be patient - it worked yesterday as I was heartbroken to discover she&apos;d broken the ear off a musical Beatrix Potter figurine which was the gift dh and I gave her for her first Xmas, so is sentimental. I didn&apos;t shout at her. In my mind I reasoned she is just inquisitive and it was MY fault for leaving it on a shelf that I thought she wouldn&apos;t reach, but she so obviously can. I am learning and I want to change. I don&apos;t just shout for the hell of it!

Tryingtoleave, your description of your parents shouting at the dinner table for some minor matter does sound abusive. A family sitting around a table eating a meal with two adults constantly picking on the DC, is not the same as a Mum shouting at her DC as a reaction to stop them from something dangerous/inappropriate.

It does sound like you have some&apos;ishoos&apos;to resolve from your own childhood. These&apos;ishoos&apos;are completely different to the ones the OP is asking for support for. The OP and other posters on the thread are self-aware and working to try and improve the way they deal with their DC&apos;s more challenging behaviour. We all know it is unhelpful to shout, and are working on strategies to reduce this.

Balanomorey, nice to see you still posting! And a good post too, about you realising the broken figurine was just an accident.

Tryingtoleave: I have to disagree with your assumption that our toddlers sound fairly normal. From the sound of it most of the people who have posted on here have posted for a reason, and that is because they identify the sheer stress that some of our toddlers&apos;s behaviour puts on us. I am a mum to two lovely boys,4 and 2. My 4 year old was, and is a breeze on the whole. Very laid-back, is hardly ever naughty, hates being told off, knows when he&apos;s gone too far etc. He has ALWAYS been like that. He has done the usual&quot;normal&quot;wilful toddler things, but I have found being a parent to him much easier, as he responds to discipline really well, and just, well, behaves (!) after a telling off (I don&apos;t mean shouting, I just mean reprimanding him for bad behaviour and explaining it was wrong.)

DS2, on the other hand, has been a different kettle of fish from day 1. Always crying and demanding SOMETHING the minute he left the womb! His whingeing has known no bounds. Sometimes he just seems to whinge out of habit. He is EXTREMELY hard to discipline as he will just not listen to reason and will just decide to&quot;go off on one&quot;when he can&apos;t get his own way. He will push you and push you and push you, and just not respond to a stern voice in any way whatsoever. We don&apos;t give into unreasonable demands but you would think we were the most unfair parents ever if you heard how he moans and whinges when we say no. I remember as a baby giving up taking him to baby&amp;toddler groups and even to the park, as despite just haven&apos;t been fed/had a nap, he would just cry and cry that people would think that he WAS hungry or tired. I got complete strangers making random comments about what they thought he needed to stop him crying. They would look at me as if I didn&apos;t know what the hell I was doing as a parent, and I wanted to scream in their face&quot;Well, look at my other DS, who is so calm and well-behaved, and who NEVER behaved like this one little bit, and who I have treated exactly the same&quot;. He has literally turned me grey and created wrinkles where there were none before.

I think THESE are the sort of toddlers that posters are referring to. They do exist, it&apos;s not all a figment of our imagination, or solely down to our treatment of them.

For what it&apos;s worth, I love my DS2 to bits, and now that his language is much improved, our reasoning with him about why he isn&apos;t allowed to do something is having much more of an effect too. I think he&apos;s been very frustrated in a toddler&apos;s body as he seems quite bright, and has just started nursery a couple of mornings a week, which he is enjoying. He is slowly becoming much better behaved, and as a result, my stress levels are finally coming down! The grey hairs and extra wrinkles are there forever though.

Yes just to back up Rachel&apos;s post. DD1 was a doddle to bring up she was a normal child and obviously there were&apos;normal&apos;child testing of boundaries but DD2 is VERY different. She is spirited, wilful, determined and would test the patience of a saint but as outlined in an earlier post that also makes them great fun, VERY rewarding and hopefully a future star of her own making. This attitude and realisation of their&apos;abilities&apos;,&apos;will&apos;or&apos;determination&apos;comes at a price, they are bloody hard work. It has taken me 2 years of soul searching to now respond in a much more positive way to DD. I spent the first 2 years I am ashamed to say regretting the fact she was not like her elder sister and coming to terms with that. It has taken me all that time to adjust my mind set and see all the positives DD2 brings. In my opinion this is what the OP is all about, she realises she isn&apos;t handling her child in the best way and is asking others to help out in the way they have managed it with their spirited children. This has on the whole been a very positive thread of celebrating our children&apos;s abilities, no one is hiding behind a&apos;spirited&apos;label. We are trying to help each other.

TTL, I am sorry you are having difficult feelings when the things you are reading remind you of how your parents were with you. It does make me feel guilty but also reminds me how important it is to work on my parenting.

I can see how it might look like we are comparing our abusive behaviours and giving each other excuses for it and going on about how it makes us feel when you know how it feels to be a child on the receiving end of it and you want the children to be heard.

Could this thread just be a trigger for you though and so the feelings you are having are more extreme than most people would expect you to have from this, because really it is unleashing the feelings from your childhood which were stronger than what the average person would feel when reading this thread.

I don&apos;t think most of the behaviours posters have talked about are abusive, everyone sometimes loses their patience after a day of their children&apos;s naughtiness, especially when their children are more hard work than other people&apos;s because they are spirited, and then they might shout or accidentally say something they wish they never said. The people on here are after advice on what to do when their children&apos;s behaviour makes them feel so bad that they feel like being abusive but don&apos;t want to be and want to find other methods that work instead.

It&apos;s when the shouting and negativity and excessive punishment is a lot of the time, enough to affect the children&apos;s self esteem, that it becomes abusive. I do feel that I may be negative enough of the time for it to be bordering on abusive and that is why I am seeing a therapist, and I am improving. I also find these threads really useful and it scares me that people might become too scared to create them. I don&apos;t really want people to know that I am, or have been an abusive parent but I want to be honest because these threads are no good to anyone without honesty. Also if I never admitted to myself that my behaviour is really bad I would never be able to change it and would end up like my parents who I vow never to be like.

Ah, Keevamum, I SO know what you mean when you say you spent the first 2 years of your DD2&apos;s life regretting she&apos;s not like her sister. I felt exactly like that too! I never showed it though - through the very fact that he WAS so demanding, DS2 has got more cuddles and attention than DS1 ever did (bless DS1 for putting up with it all!). I also used to resent DS2 for putting an end to those lovely, drama-free walks in the park that DS1 and I used to have. It took a long time to come to terms with the fact that DS2 was just DIFFERENT, and in fact, it is literally only the past few months that DH has stopped referring to him in private as&quot;Asbo&quot;or&quot;Stewie&quot;(from Family Guy)!!!! I used to pretend to be when he said things like that to me whenever we discussed the kids, but secretly I&apos;d be laughing inwardly and thinking&quot;Good nicknames!&quot;

rachel, keeva - snap. LOL re your DH by the way rachel (er - if we&apos;re still allowed to laugh on this post )- exactly what i wanted to articulate as soon as i read tryingtoleave&apos;s post. it&apos;s been just the same for me - my 7-yr-old has been incredibly hard to manage from the beginning, for all the reasons you both eloquently describe, my 5 yr-old is a completely different experience in terms of child-rearing and this has also been the case from the beginning. i adore them both but my DD toddler years were indescribably hard - she seemed to lurch from crisis to crisis, tantrum to tantrum, from minute to minute more or less from the moment she woke up and the strain on me, but also on my family unit was immense. the negativity, the angry outbursts were so hard on us all, we&apos;d always been calm and non-confrontational types, my DH and me, and suddenly a whirlwind was in our midst and we had to learn a whole new set of coping mechanisms to retain some sanity!

i really want to stress to tryingtoleave that it is a wholly different experience raising that sort of child to dealing with the normal day-to-day ups and downs of the average child. like rachel and keeva i only found this out after having my son ie being able to compare the two kids and realising that temperament is largely innate and can only be managed, not changed! as rachel and keeva also emphasise, i love my gorgeous, feisty daughter every bit as much as my more mellow, amiable son and she is blossoming as she leaves those tricky, frustration-laden toddler years behind - i reckon some kids just HATE being toddlers, she certainly did, she only really seemed HAPPY when she got to school age! - but confrontations remain a regular occurrence and always will, i suspect! not really shouty ones to be honest, in fact in i was never much of a shouter, more of a bottler-up-inside of all the stress, but that tendency of mine caused me now and again to really lose it when pushed to my absolute limit and i know how frightening that loss of control can be and how ashamed and guilty it makes you feel afterwards, just in the way that balanomorey has described. in my own case i reckon showing a bit more of my own anger towards DD (in a controlled way obviously!) might have been a good thing! i always restrained it all in order to present a calm and controlled facade at all times and i&apos;m not sure that did either of us a favour!

Hi Balanomorey,

I am really glad that you do not feel like a failure because to me you sound like you are dealing with the problems you have written about here as best you can, both within yourself and without, and that to me is a mark of success and of courage - however far along you are with the process of actually changing things. I think making these efforts is surely also a testament of how much you love your DD. My view is that she will also know and feel your love for her, and that will mitigate/balance against whatever harshness or anger she has also experienced. Children - us humans - are remarkably resilient given the right amount of love and care. But yes it would be truly great if you could turn around patterns of behaviour you know aren&apos;t doing anyone any good now, while your DD is still very young.

I can really understand why anyone who has suffered any kind of verbal or physical harshness or abuse as a child would find this thread stirring, as it might easily seem as if people who are sharing problems in this area might somehow be colluding or trying to make it seem&apos;fine&apos;to -for example - often shout at their DCs or explode in rages. However, I don&apos;t think that is what has been going on. I have found it really moving to read nearly everyone&apos;s struggles in different ways NOT to be harsh with or to harm their children.

I don&apos;t really know about the term&apos;spirited&apos;children (it&apos;s just a word, right?) but I can definitely relate hugely to what many people on here have been writing about what they mean by their&apos;spirited&apos;children. My delightful two year old is also secretly nicknamed (by my DP and I)&apos;The boss&apos;,&apos;The beast&apos;and various other things (a bit too&apos;in-joke&apos;to share). I haven&apos;t any other DC to compare him to (and at 42, probably wont now) but I was surprised at his forceful character even at aged 5 weeks. Maybe I should have realised at five days when he was in the SCBU and literally crawled up the plastic cot somehow and tipped the lid askew in an attempt to escape 

My Ds is now being bang in the stage of wilful two year old tantrums and trying to teach him boundaries and him shouting&quot; I&apos;ll do it!&quot;(everything - cook, clean, wash up, drive a car, cut own nails, etc) and I have found myself feeling hugely angry and frustrated all too often when I&apos;ve had a day of it. I tend to be more of the&apos;act calm, bottle it&apos;mentality but can lose it occasionally and then I feel ashamed with myself. The worst hasn&apos;t been too awful objectively... raising my voice or seething with anger and letting that show in my voice, banging or throwing a few things around, stomping off and shouting outside for my neighbours entertainment . I&apos;m not a violent person but I would say I&apos;m fiery and can be aggressive (inwardly at least) when very riled or anxious. What has been so difficult being a parent is realising how much of my father&apos;s aggression I imbibed as a child (he was my main carer in the day from weeks old and my mother worked). My father suffered badly from anxiety (so much so he couldn&apos;t work by the time I came along) and he was extremely shouty and controlling most of the time. He&apos;d swing between being too much in my face and then absent or even negligent (e.g: he&apos;d leave me in the car or the house while he went off shopping, the pub etc, so he could have a break ).

Yes it&apos;s a shock when we feel like we&apos;re turning into our own parents isn&apos;t it (and not just in the mirror LOL) 

 But , crucially, we really don&apos;t have to repeat all their mistakes. I firmly believe that by bringing more awareness and understanding of our mental and emotional conditioning and limits (including any psychological wounding we have experienced as children) we can stop the damage right here in the present moment.

I think one key is to simply believe in your love for your child (and who hasn&apos;t had moments when you fantasise about passing them on to a good home? ) and to bring an attitude of forgiveness to those times when you haven&apos;t shown that in your behaviour or haven&apos;t behaved patiently or lovingly. Being a mum may be hugely rewarding but it&apos;s also a tough job.

Oh well I&apos;m writing a pamphlet here (you can tell Ds is fast asleep). This thread has helped me as we&apos;ve all been sick in this house for the past two weeks and I&apos;ve been finding it a strain. So thanks all for writing.

lovely post skydancer and i agree - compassion to ourselves and to each other is so important. it&apos;s been a really big strength of this thread from the beginning. and of course you&apos;re right -&apos;spirited&apos;is just a word - i use it bcs i found the book so very helpful, the spirited child book i mean, but it could equally well be any number of other adjectives describing a certain independent and fiery intrinsic essence!
my DH and used to call our DD&apos;the dark force&apos; 
robbierotten i feel for you. yes it really does get better. i have always loathed hearing from people the dreaded words&apos;ha! you think this is hard - wait until the teenage years&apos;! for 2 reasons - one the total absence of comprehension on display, re quite how f*cking hard THIS stage was, and two - the seeming impossibility of being able to keep going with THIS amount of stress until the teenage years, then doubling or tripling it - argh!!

ps robbie r, re frustration - i have worked really hard from an early age to try to teach my DD the vocabulary of emotion. giving them the words to express those really scary, strong emotions that wash over them and that they have no ability to comprehend, far less articulate, is really helpful - for them and for you. have you ever seen those posters with faces on them with different expressions, subtitled&apos;happy&apos;&apos;shocked&apos;&apos;sorry&apos;&apos;scared&apos;etc? really worth getting for the kitchen wall! it took ages and it is obviously not possible when they&apos;re really young, but it&apos;s such a milestone when you can really talk to them about what&apos;s going on inside their head - or was, bcs it&apos;s usually in retrospect you have these chats of course, after the storm has passed. then you can empathise (i could see that was very frustrating for you) and make suggestions re how things could be done differently the next time.
also, compromise is key - my DD is very introverted and it took ages to be able to go to parties, on playdates etc, like you i used to worry about playdates and playgroups etc, especially big meet-ups with relatives (eg xmas day!!) - often i had to leave her in the car to read her book for 5 minutes or so while i was already greeting the people we were visiting, and she would come out in her own time and take her time, and be fine. one difficulty we&apos;ve had is that i am an extrovert so our basic attitudes to the outside world clash! we&apos;ve worked on that too though and i have to give her lots of quiet time between social events.

it all does get easier and she is much more able to talk about how she feels, also she knows that she and daddy are more introverted than me and my DS, she knows that they are more perfectionist and also that they both get anxious if things aren&apos;t done quite&apos;so&apos;, whereas DS and i are more laid-back (considered&apos;sloppy&apos;by the other 2 needless to say!) - all of these things she can now take in and discuss with us and we can laugh about our differences and joke between us and use humour to get her through her challenging moments more. she still loses it though!! (homework...trying to learn to ride a bike...argh!) but then afterwards can talk about why it happened. it&apos;s all hard work but the rewards are gradually appearing so keep at it!!

Hi All

It is obvious that we all feel a lot for our DC and care deeply about them. If we didn&apos;t I hardly think we&apos;d be spending as much time on here pontificating about them. 

DH and I try our hardest to give the DC the best lives we can offer them. It is sheer hard work at times, and when the DC behave badly, show us up, whatever, it is upsetting. We are sometimes left wondering what are we doing wrong. Sometimes it is too difficult in RL to admit these defeats.

This thread has been a really good place to air some of these feelings. It is refreshing that people have been so honest. There has also been a lot of humour and that is really good.

I am so pleased people have carried on posting.

robbie - forgot to say, my DD went through months and months of insisting on wearing two long (knee-high) white socks to bed every night like the hero of an obscure kids&apos;story by danielle steele (yes, that danielle steele) called&apos;max&apos;s daddy&apos;. a fireman who broke both his legs in an act of heroic bravery.

this was a very serious issue in her eyes and at half 7 at night, we weren&apos;t keen to mess around either after a 13 hour day tussling with her will of iron. woe betide us if there were no white socks to hand (your nickname&apos;the boss&apos;springs to mind here sky!!). we even took her to a wedding at that stage (3) and when asked by a lady what her name was she (grimly) replied&apos;max&apos;s daddy&apos;. the nice lady wandered away looking a little confused

I have conflicts about how much to compromise with what my Ds wants and when to say a flat no or attempt to distract onto an alternative. This is a tricky one for me sometimes because Ds is insistent and almost obsessive about certain things he likes/wants (and it has to be&apos;right now&apos;of course - or else it&apos;s a full scale tragedy - ala Katiek and&apos;Max&apos;s daddy&apos;socks).

I had a friend stay with me for a week a while back and she thought I gave in too much to what DS wanted and was therefore making life harder for myself, but what I don&apos;t think she could really appreciate (apart from the fact that she isn&apos;t a parent ) was that I just wanted to avoid head on/full scale collisions with him all the time he was awake ! -and was actually diverting him quite a lot of the time anyway. For example, if he goes mad-max crazy about needing to do the dishes, I&apos;d rather provide a bowl next to the sink (he stands on a chair and&apos;helps&apos;me by doing his own&apos;dishes&apos;(plastic items, small saucepans etc) than to have a screaming, tugging, shouting, hysterical tot there for 10 minutes.

Obviously there are total&apos;no-nos&apos;, from obvious dangers such as using/touching the oven to regular times when we want/need him to do something and he doesn&apos;t like it/want it happening just at that moment (nappy changes, going out, dressed, undressed, nursery, needing medication etc.). I am rattling on but what I wanted to say was that with a wilful, determined with a triple D toddler I seem to have decided to try to pick my battles carefully rather than live in a war zone. On the other hand I occasionally wonder if I have strayed into being too permissive and maybe my friend had a point. Any comments appreciated...

I feel I need to list these things I have done which seem abusive. These are the sort of things I want to stop doing. I feel if I write them it will help me to focus. I feel ashamed of myself, especially letting people know, but I want to feel this guilt to help me feel so bad that it might act as a deterrant. If anyone has ideas how I can deal with things differently in my mind and in practice&apos;in the moment&apos;of madness I will be very grateful. Also feel free to be horrible to me about what I&apos;ve done:

1. DD wouldn&apos;t stop aggravating DS and making him cry. I lost it and picked her up, walked into the other room with her and dumped her on the sofa to watch TV away from him. But I did it really roughly, really slammed her down on the sofa and shouted in anger. She cried because I did it so hard it hurt her. Other times I have also moved her about too roughly because I&apos;m so angry.

2. Pushing the children roughly away from me when they won&apos;t leave me alone and are hanging around me and I can&apos;t take anymore.

3. Some days when I really feel I can&apos;t cope I have repeatedly said things like&quot;Go away from me, I don&apos;t want you near me, I don&apos;t want to talk, I want to be on my own, I&apos;m not doing anything for you, I don&apos;t want to do it anymore, I&apos;m just waiting for you to go to bed and get away from me, you talk too much, I don&apos;t want to listen to your drivel all the time&quot;.

4. When DD is having irrational fears I have sometimes got so fed up of her going mad over every little thing that I&apos;ve called her a drip and a baby and said she is being stupid and ridiculous. I&apos;ve tried to make her do things that scare her eg. going into a room on her own to get something and have been unsympathetic about her fears.

5. During bathtimes when she just would not co-operate and it felt like bathtime would go on forever and she was going to scream at me and sometimes hit me whatever I did, I sometimes used to forcibly hold DD still and wash her and tip water over her even though it made her scream (the water temperature was fine and DS was quite happy having his bath at the same time with her). I seem to have got bathtimes sorted though now (see one of my previous posts).

6. Sometimes when DD has made DS cry I&apos;ve said horrible things like&quot;You are horrible and nobody will like you if you behave like this. We don&apos;t want to be near you when you are like this&quot;.

None of these things are as bad as the things that happened to me during childhood but I am so scared of them going through the same as me that I don&apos;t want to do anything that is anything like abuse. I feel if I started doing bad things they could escalate. Sometimes it is hard to know if I am so emotive and anxious about these things that I see everything I do as wrong but I do feel that these things above are bad.

Haven&apos;t reflected on AN&apos;s post (am running a bath at the mo) but would say to Skydancer not to worry about what your friend who has no experience thinks.

Bowl for him to splash while you wash up great idea.

&quot;regular times when we want/need him to do something and he doesn&apos;t like it/want it happening just at that moment (nappy changes, going out, dressed, undressed, nursery, needing medication etc.&quot;

Obviously a dirty nappy needs to be changed fairly quickly but unless he has very sensitive skin, nothing wrong with waiting until he has finished a puzzle or whatever. Same with getting changed or going out unless there is a deadline. Going out to nursery different to going out to the park/shops etc.

ActingNormal, sorry about all these posts. Lots of thoughts buzzing through my head having read your list.

For the sibling stuff, I find it helps to expect them to wind each other up and rather than taking it personally, just to treat it as boredom and offer an attractive distraction to the culprit or both.
If they are not hurting one another or complaining to you, go into another room and see how they sort it out by themselves.

Hi all
Interesting posts since I looked in yesterday. DD in meltdown at the moment - dh trying to deal with it, will pop back tomorrow to post. Second the others - great acting for posting that list. I too, and dh by his own admission, have been guilty for rough handling when pushed to the limits - once again you aren&apos;t alone in that one.x.
 Add message | Report | Message poster oneplusone Tue 07-Oct-08 19:49:29 
AN, you are brave for posting your worst moments. But I can assure you, you are not alone. For example, I have:

* Lost it so badly with DD once that she said to me&apos;You&apos;re a bully&apos;which completely stopped me in my tracks.

* I am quite often muttering under my breath at DD&apos;You stupid b*tch&apos;when she is deliberately mucking about when she is supposed to be getting dressed for school, when she interrupts which she does CONSTANTLY, when she comes to me for the umpteenth time with a naked to the invisible eye scratch/spot/bump.

*One thing that is always guaranteed to set me off is trying to teach/help her to read. She seems to be bright and advanced in many ways but not in her reading and when she can&apos;t sound out/remember simple words I get frustrated/impatient/angry and have only just stopped short of calling her stupid. A while ago I just gave up on trying to read with her as I found myself getting so angry with her but tried again tonight and guess what....I am now in an extremely bad mood because she couldn&apos;t read the most simple book, the sort she has been bringing home for about 2 years now. I keep telling myself she&apos;s only 5 and just learning to read but nevertheless I feel my blood starting to boil as soon as she makes what I see as really silly mistakes.

* I can relate to the rough handling although that seems to be one I have managed to eradicate completely...... but then I think my shouting makes up for it ie verbal assaults instead of physical.....just as bad really.

I think I am at my worst when I haven&apos;t had any time or enough time in the day to myself. I know every mum needs&apos;me&apos;time, but I seem to need a lot more than most. I remember a few occasions when for whatever reason both DC&apos;s were out of the house til around 5.30/6pm meaning that once I had picked them up all i had to do was feed them, chat/play for a bit and then put them to bed and i actually enjoyed the hour or so i spent with them.

When I end up spending 12/13 hours a day with one/both of them, sometimes without a break if DS doesn&apos;t nap.....well I turn into a seething, angry, snappy, short tempered, scary monster.

I have increased DS&apos;s afternoons at nursery, but I feel HUGE gut wrenching guilt about leaving him there and fret about him the whole time he is there.

Quite frankly I think I am in no way shape or form cut out to be a mother to young children but of course there is no way out of this situation other than&apos;through&apos;it. ie somehow get through it day by day until DS starts full time school. I am fervently hoping that by having a lot of the day to myself I will be a lot more patient/nicer/tolerant of the DC&apos;s when they are around. And also I will find them less boring as we will be able to do things that I enjoy as well.

I&apos;m sorry if my post is at a tangent to other posts, I haven&apos;t read the whole thread, but from what i have read, i think i&apos;m in the right place.

Oneplusone and AN
Regarding the rough handling I too have been guilty of this occasionally towards my DSs. I haven&apos;t experienced it with DD but she is still very young and doesn&apos;t provoke the same feelings of annoyance, frustration and anger within me.
I haven&apos;t done it for sometime, even though I have felt bloody angry at times especially when they fight/ hurt eachother then scream and cry for me to comfort them. Recently I have stopped and thought why they are doing it, and usually realise they have not eaten recently, or had a late bed time the previous night. When I feel there is a practical explanation it seems to calm me and prevent me from reacting in a way I will later regret.
One of you AN, or Oneplusone wrote something on Mumsnet recently, can&apos;t remember where which has really, really helped me. You were talking about how your DC can be extremely demanding after school. On the walk home they are just nasty and cross. You explained that as their Mum you have to contain this in some way, not react. Both my DSs have a tendency to be really hostile towards me after school. I find it very difficult as it seems so wrong when we have been separated all day. In the past I have taken it a bit personally when they are nasty to me, but since reading the post(whenever it was), I have tried to contain the DSs frustration and anger by just putting it down to their tiredness and having to be good boys all day. We end up having a far more pleasant evening when I just let this nasty/cross behaviour go. I will tell them I don&apos;t like it but then try and divert their attention, which is not always that easy.

I am waffling but just wanted to let you know that I find your posts really helpful.

Just out of interest, oneplusone, what are you doing about the anger that you are feeling? I mean, a lot of people have posted their experiences of what their flashpoints are, and discussed how they are trying to improve things?

I&apos;m only asking, as I think that for this to be a balanced thread, and not as TwinkleLittleStar posted further up, just a forum for mothers to&quot;collude&quot;with each other (as someone put it, can&apos;t remember who) and excuse their bad behaviour, there has to be some discussion of ways we are trying to deal with things. Or strategies we have found successful that may help other posters.

i have made a great effort to plaster on a smile to dd when she is testing my patience and that really does seem to work with her, the more angry i get, the worse she behaves, but the nicer i am, the quicker she calms down and, well i wouldnt say behaves, but as close to as she can get.

rachelp.....what am i doing about my anger? Well, the answer to that is on the&apos;stately homes&apos;thread. We are now onto part 4 of that thread so if you want to read it all you will be reading around 700 pages (if you print it out) worth of material.

That should give you an idea of the complexity of the problem, it&apos;s actually very difficult to explain in a nutshell.

But, compared to around a year ago, the amount of times I have completely&apos;lost the plot&apos;with DD (it never seems to happen with DS) is virtually zero. I do still get cross with her, but i am so much more in control of myself than i was before. The incident i mentioned in my post where DD called me a bully was around 2 years ago.

It is an ongoing process but I am infinitely better than i was at expressing my anger in such a way that it does not cause anyone any harm.

 Add message | Report | Message poster rachelp73 Tue 07-Oct-08 22:25:59 
ActingNormal, just thought I&apos;d throw in a few ideas about your situations. Totally just my own opinion, so others might disagree:

1. DD wouldn&apos;t stop aggravating DS and making him cry. I lost it and picked her up, walked into the other room with her and dumped her on the sofa to watch TV away from him. But I did it really roughly, really slammed her down on the sofa and shouted in anger. She cried because I did it so hard it hurt her. Other times I have also moved her about too roughly because I&apos;m so angry.

*to me, it is a total natural reaction to be annoyed at your DD for upsetting your DS for no apparent reason. You and she both know she has to be punished for doing it, but I also know how hard it is to try and distinguish between genuine physical pain in that situation to whinging about it purely out of wounded pride. I personally would hesitate to call that situation abusive. I am sure every parent of 2 feuding siblings has been through similar.*

2. Pushing the children roughly away from me when they won&apos;t leave me alone and are hanging around me and I can&apos;t take anymore.

*again, I have sympathy here. I guess the trick is to tell them to leave you alone BEFORE you&apos;ve got to the pushing away stage. It MUST seem like they&apos;ve been rejected if it&apos;s done that way, whereas it might help all round if you just warn them in advance that&quot;Mummy is feeling tired, and wants 10 mins peace to read the paper/have a cup of tea. I do NOT want any interruptions during that time, otherwise I will be short-tempered with you later on and you don&apos;t like it when I shout, remember?&quot;*

3. Some days when I really feel I can&apos;t cope I have repeatedly said things like&quot;Go away from me, I don&apos;t want you near me, I don&apos;t want to talk, I want to be on my own, I&apos;m not doing anything for you, I don&apos;t want to do it anymore, I&apos;m just waiting for you to go to bed and get away from me, you talk too much, I don&apos;t want to listen to your drivel all the time&quot;.

*ActingNormal, I am guessing that you know yourself that this type of thing could impact on your DC&apos;s self-esteem and behaviour. What I&apos;d do again is similar to number 2. Be aware of when your own feelings are getting out of hand, and PHYSICALLY remove yourself from them, rather than remove THEM from YOU. Go to a different room with a cup of tea, put a DVD on for DC and instruct them as for number 2. Alternatively, when I get into that situation where their behaviour is just irritating me is, I just get a newspaper, hide behind it, and switch off. Just muttering the odd&quot;Hmmm....really?.....that&apos;s nice.....is that so?&quot;But the point is, you are distinctly not listening to their whingeing or whatever. Hopefully they&apos;ll get bored and go off to play!*

4. When DD is having irrational fears I have sometimes got so fed up of her going mad over every little thing that I&apos;ve called her a drip and a baby and said she is being stupid and ridiculous. I&apos;ve tried to make her do things that scare her eg. going into a room on her own to get something and have been unsympathetic about her fears.

*The way I deal with stuff like this, irritating though it is, is try and remember what silly things I myself find scary, and try and put myself in their shoes. Even if it means going back to childhood memories of being scared of the dark, try and do it and imagine that to them, the fear is not irrational. Bite your lip, go into the room with her and as time goes on, she will get over irrational fears naturally as she gets older.*

5. During bathtimes when she just would not co-operate and it felt like bathtime would go on forever and she was going to scream at me and sometimes hit me whatever I did, I sometimes used to forcibly hold DD still and wash her and tip water over her even though it made her scream (the water temperature was fine and DS was quite happy having his bath at the same time with her). I seem to have got bathtimes sorted though now (see one of my previous posts).

*ActingNormal, in no way could this be described as abusive. Children HAVE to be washed whether they like it or not. The trick is finding a solution where the situation is made pleasant for everyone, and it sounds like you&apos;ve got it sorted now anyway.*

6. Sometimes when DD has made DS cry I&apos;ve said horrible things like&quot;You are horrible and nobody will like you if you behave like this. We don&apos;t want to be near you when you are like this&quot;.

*You know, most parenting experts advise saying something along those lines when a chlid is being mean to another child. It&apos;s just about explaining the consequence of being nasty to someone else. It is TRUE that in life if you treat people badly they will turn away from you and not want to spend time with you, it is right that we teach our children that important lesson. It is no point us as parents accepting nasty behaviour and saying&quot;ah, there, there, don&apos;t worry that you upset your brother, we forgive you.&quot;I genuinely believe that they should learn that no-one wants to be around someone who is downright nasty to others. However, when my sons make each other cry, I also follow that type of thing up with an explanation of why they must apologise to their brother and a&quot;How would YOU like it if your brother took your favourite toy and stamped on it?&quot;, and get them to see why their brother is so upset. Then when they apologise, you know that it comes from the heart (mostly!), and not just because I or their dad is just TELLING them to apologise!*

Hope that&apos;s helped a bit and not been too preachy or whatever. Again, just posting what works in OUR house. Sounds like you&apos;ve been through some tough times in the past. (((((((hugs))))))))))

OtherSideOC, Yes, when I behave badly it is because I am in a rage. What have I tried as anger management in the moment - I seem to forget to think about what I&apos;m doing. The times that I have remembered, sometimes doing something really silly and making the children laugh has worked. The thing I&apos;m trying to do at the moment is just stop, focus on my&apos;insides&apos;going still and look at the children, I mean really look and actually see them - the details of what they look like, how much I love what they look like, how they look like they are feeling and what they are needing in that moment. When I remember to do it, it calms me right down and the answer to what to do for the best just seems to come to me. But how do I remember to do it every time before I have reacted?

Things that I do right - don&apos;t want to go into detail as I don&apos;t want to feel I am saying the bad things don&apos;t matter because I&apos;m doing good things as well, but when I am good I am really good. I must seem like Jekyll and Hyde to the kids and on my different posts. I feel like deep down and instinctively I know what I should be doing but a lot of the time I don&apos;t do it because of the mood I&apos;m in. When I&apos;m feeling good the kids are normally good. I often say to DH when I look frazzled and he asks me if the kids have been bad&quot;I&apos;m not sure if they have been bad or if it is ME that has been bad&quot;.

OnePlusOne, Mimizan etc thank you for also sharing. I feel less alone. I think that it isn&apos;t only about knowing what methods to use when our children are being challenging but understanding what makes us feel so intensely when they do it and working on our own issues. I think having your own issues from childhood as well as having spirited children makes it even harder! I&apos;m not saying this is an excuse, just that it makes it harder.

ActingNormal: just to go back to your point number 6: I read somewhere that it&apos;s quite important to actually call the BEHAVIOUR horrible, and not the actual child. I suppost it&apos;s so the child feels she can actually CHANGE her behaviour, whereas she is who she is, personality-wise, IYSWIM, and might feel&quot;labelled&quot;as horrible and therefore stuck with acting out the&quot;horrible&quot;label. Or something like that! Am just regurgitating half-remembered things from parenting books that I rmember to actually DO with my kids, but forget exactly WHY!

rachelp, of course you are welcome to read the&apos;stately homes&apos;thread. But, it could be likened a little bit to opening Pandora&apos;s Box, so be prepared!

But, although I feel as if I have been on a long and at times very painful journey, back to my own childhood, it has been well worth it for the positive change I have seen in myself and therefore my DC&apos;s.

And the journey has not yet ended.

ActingNormal, now there&apos;s something we all find difficult, isn&apos;t it? How to recognise the point of no return - the point at which we just do snap and can&apos;t think what to do for the best. It&apos;s sometimes really hard to see it coming, I agree. I&apos;ve made a conscious effort to take notice of when my voice is just becoming louder/shriller/more on edge each time I say something to the kids about their behaviour. When these alarm bells start telling me that I am on the run-up to losing control and SHOUTING, THAT is the point where I take myself off to another room. Doesn&apos;t always work though, I know.....

i am so intrigued re the much-mentioned stately homes thread. what is it? where is it to be found? (i still don&apos;t understand mumsnet well enough to find it for myself). in fact, can it please be summarised in about two paras for arse-lazy k123??!

rachel - you are truly the fount of all wisdom (i knew this already but it&apos;s good to have it confirmed )and i bow down before you in awe. by the way, we have clearly both been doing a little bit of soul-searching in the light of TLS&apos;s posts bcs i have also been a little concerned about seeming collusive in the aftermath of her comments. the thought of being considered self-congratulatory was very unpleasant to me too. i am being a little more careful in how i post from now on.

AN - nothing to add to the last few posts, except for my sympathy and respect for your honesty. it will all get better, i am absolutely sure of that.

oneplusone - cannot tell you how life transformed for me when DD went to school. because i get a rest of several hours a day from her intensity, whether at home or at work, i recharge my batteries and can therefore deal with her so much better and ENJOY her so much more now. like you i have a huge need for time alone or in adult company, without which i go slightly unhinged!! (no, not in an abusive way i hasten to add...not that i&apos;m paranoid on this thread these days or anything !) ... and indeed, did go a bit unhinged, during the years 3-5 (when we also moved countries every year for three years, would you believe, an astonishing example of how to make a rod for your own (and change-averse DD&apos;s poor) back in retrospect, argh!! so i really, really sympathise with you on that one. stay strong and try to ringfence even a tiny amount of time to yourself each week - i used to manage 2 hours a week at your stage and used to savour every micro-second of it!!

just caught up with all you busy posters - rachel totally agree SO important to label behaviour, NOT child, negatively. i know this is sometimes considered overdone (eg by my parents, who think i am amusingly pedantic on this one) but i really think it&apos;s vital. AN it&apos;s fine to come down really strongly on a child&apos;s bad behaviour, and by making it the behaviour rather than the child you&apos;re calling horrid/unacceptable/unpleasant etc it makes it far less of a blow to the child&apos;s self-esteem.

...christ, i don&apos;t know why i am even bothering to try to pretend to be any sort of expert - if you&apos;d seen me this morning walking my kids to school then having to intervene as DD lashed out at DS then screamed with rage at his&apos;daring&apos;to remonstrate - all this in pouring rain under umbrellas and in wellies on a narrow country lane - while an elderly woman stopped her car to ask in plummy tones&apos;whether you need any assistance, dear&apos;tempted to reply&apos;yes if you could just take these two children away, rear them into decent (plummy) individuals then return them to me aged 18 i&apos;d be ever so grateful&apos;

Great posts, people! All that wisdom. Oh and BTW Katiek I think the only parenting experts are non-parents who have watched an episode or two of nanny911 (or whatever it&apos;s called) 

It did bring up sadness for me reading the lists people have come up with here but I understand as I must have at least felt like doing most of those things at some point. I too have been a bit harsh handling my Ds on a few occasions (I can think of things like plonking him in the pushchair over emphatically when he just wont get in, or snatching things abruptly out of his hands when I&apos;ve already told him 5 times not to do whatever it was etc). I don&apos;t think I have ever deliberately caused pain or harm to him, but I shocked or frightened myself enough a couple of times and had those&apos;what if&apos;&apos;thoughts such as&quot;What if in taking him out of that highchair at that stupid speed I had actully banged his head on that shelf - would he have survived?!&apos;etc. And I imagine he must have had a felt sense of the strength of my anger at times even if I haven&apos;t actually shown anything in my manner. I have also in sheer exasperation said such things as&apos;Shut up now&apos;or&apos;Go away&apos;.

I do not want to misuse my power as an adult in any way. I&apos;m often painfully aware how utterly vulnerable my Ds is just being such a small child and what a huge responsibility it is to have such power and influence over another human being.

A few personal strategies:

I try warning myself when I know I am going to be more volatile generally (E.g PMT ).

I find it worth remembering - as others so rightly mention here - that children are like intuitive precision-radars and seem to reflect back our state of mind sometimes even before we know what&apos;s going on with ourselves. They pick up on stress levels, unhappy vibes or short fuses and somehow reflect them back to us parents in&apos;bad&apos;behaviour much like one of those exaggerated circus mirrors. So when I can remember this as I start being annoyed with my DS I try to become more aware of my own mental state and to manage it better. If I&apos;m successful I find I can manage my Ds better (and he usually seems happier when I calm down anyway so it often takes away the need to&apos;manage&apos;the child). Often I realise I am preoccupied with something totally unrelated to the child but I haven&apos;t had time or space to deal with so it is&apos;leaking&apos;into how I relate to him.

The difficulty with stress as a parent of a young child is you don&apos;t always have even a minute to actually physically go anywhere else to take time out, reflect, take deep breaths, write a diary or whatever. If I find myself getting to that tightly-stretched feeling I now also try deliberately giving my Ds something I know will absorb him for 10-20 minutes (an episode of Night Garden - magic!) and get far enough away to get a grip on myself and/or recharge my own batteries somehow. Bringing a bit of pleasure into my experience can be helpful - through a song (blasting out something -having a dance), reading the paper, sitting with my eyes closed in the sun for five minutes, hiding under the duvet - anything.

If my DP is around and I&apos;m just done-in with childcare I can ask him to take DS for a specific time, to the park or for a bath (awed respect to all single parents out there who don&apos;t have this option).

What I really haven&apos;t sorted out recently is taking enough literal time out away from my Ds to do other things. I haven&apos;t organised enough baby-sitting or enough activities for myself to even&apos;merit&apos;baby-sitting. This is largely because I have been living abroad for some time but not long enough to have found my feet here, plus not employed here yet and not much in the way of circuit of friends or family around me.

ActingNormal, so pleased to see you say&quot;when I am good, I am really good&quot;but I do understand your reasons for not expanding.

Agree with Rachel about telling your children in a kind way when you need some space as early on as possible. Make it about you and not about them.

When they are being unkind to other children or even accidentally upsetting them, I tend to say&apos;look how it makes so-and-so feel&apos;. Mine have definitely developed empathy towards their peers/siblings whereas empathy towards adults is a new thing to DS who is 5.5.

Oh, and when they are being whingy/whiny and I&apos;ve had enough I put my hands over my ears and say&apos;all I can hear is waah, waah, waah&apos;while pulling a whiny child face which makes them laugh. Then I try to get them to state their problem in a pleasant voice so we can work on it.

Like everyone has said, definitely label the behaviour and not the child, for both criticism and praise.

Rachel, I think you have to put the asterisks either side of every word.

Dear All
Once again, some great advice on here which I have been reading and absorbing with great interest. Keep posting.

I feel I haven&apos;t contributed much over the last few days - it&apos;s hard for me to find the time as dh dosn&apos;t know I&apos;m posting (he wouldn&apos;t be too happy if he knew I&apos;d been&apos;airing my dirty laundry in public&apos;, so to speak, as he&apos;s forever telling me to chill out, so would be upset to know I&apos;m that unhappy about things that I&apos;m posting on here...so I need to do it when he&apos;s not around which isn&apos;t always easy). Also, obviously, dd is around all day, so I can&apos;t concentrate to post when she&apos;s about as she is too distracting.

Was going to post this morning as she is meant to be at nursery - but she broke her heart about going this morning which is most unusual so I&apos;ve had to keep her home, against my better judgement! Asked her why she didn&apos;t want to go and answer a) was because of the spider that was there last week and answer b) was because she didn&apos;t feel well - have given her the benefit of the doubt that it&apos;s answer b) as she has been a bit poorly this week...so no time to post today.

Just wanted you all to know I am still here and keeping tabs, but haven&apos;t always got the time to write a long, constructive post - but so wish all those struggling with temper well and hope things improve for you all.

When I have time will post an update on how I am getting on and I do have some issues I&apos;d like a bit of advice on...so watch this space and in the meantime lets keep up the support on this thread. x.

RobbieRotten, Being kicked in the face is horrible. You are doing really well to grit your teeth and resist the urge to react back.
My DC have done this in the past and I have dealt with it by removing their current favourite toy for a set period. The sanction has to be immediate for that kind of behaviour.

My DS2 who is 7 called me an idiot this morning. I can&apos;t remember why although it was something to do with me asking him to come and eat his breakfast. It&apos;s a phase he&apos;s going through. I really hate it though and I felt myself getting angry. I thought about this thread and the discussion about empathy. I did do a lot of finger shaking but managed not to shout. Basically I said I didn&apos;t like to hear anyone called an idiot, that I am not an idiot and that how would it make him feel if I called him one. I then went onto say, (which I now regret) that if he continues to call me an idiot I may have to reconsider the pool party we have organised for his birthday. Thinking about it now I should have removed something, but I was feeling really cross, I didn&apos;t think straight. Also DH is away for a few days and I am feeling tired and overstretched.

I don&apos;t like issuing these kind of threats but find I do it quite a lot when they misbehave. It&apos;s definitely better than smacking or shouting but still not good. 
Does any one else issue threats?
 Add message | Report | Message poster rachelp73 Wed 08-Oct-08 13:29:10 
I issue threats all the time, Mimizan! But i&apos;ve been lucky in that I haven&apos;t had to follow up any&quot;big&quot;threats, IYSWIM. For example, what would you do if he DID call you an idiot again? I really would not know what to do in that situaton. I&apos;d just feel too bloodyo mean to NOT let him have the party, but they have to know you mean business when you issue threats, don&apos;t they? It&apos;s so hard. It&apos;s totally understandable what you did though. Maybe a kind of anti-reward chart?! A kind of&quot;3 strikes and the pool party goes&quot;chart. Only joking......

Actually, that&apos;s KIND of something that some primary schools are doing (if you don&apos;t already know about it). My SIL told me recently about&quot;Golden Time&quot;which they have in her son&apos;s school. It&apos;s a short period of free time on a Friday afternoon when the children can choose a&quot;play-based&quot;type of activity to do. If they&apos;ve had a certain number of reprimands for bad behaviour that week, then they lose their Golden Time. I have no idea whether it works, was the first time I&apos;d heard of it. Similar type of concept, I suppose.

To everyone else, there is some really good advice here, I have been reading with interest! I like your idea of how to deal with a whingy/whiny child, Othersideofthechannel. Will try that with my two, it always helps to make them laugh.

Somebody mentioned something about not being able to deal with their kids during the morning rush. I can so identify with that! Also the kids mirroring your behaviour idea. Very true! The kids get so much more stressed if I am rushing about late in the morning, and it just makes them whinge and moan and drag their feet even more. The ONLY way I&apos;ve found to deal with it is something totally obvious and that is to just get us all up earlier (much as it kills me! ), and leave PLENTY time for unforeseen situations which would otherwise make me get all tight-chested and shout at the kids.

I&apos;ve not really got any time to write any more as DS2 refusing to nap as too snotty! He is off his food as well so extra demanding. Cbeebies has been on a LOT today! 

Will keep popping on...

Skydancer, I love what you wrote about children sensing our moods before we even know our mood has changed! So if their behaviour starts getting worse we can say to ourselves&quot;The children&apos;s behaviour is showing me that I am getting into a bad mood. What can I do/how can I think differently to make myself feel better&quot;. I think this will definately be useful for me because I really notice that DCs&apos;and DH&apos;s moods change when mine does, they seem really affected by me.

OtherSide, I love what you wrote about saying to a child who has hurt another one&quot;Look how you have made him/her feel&quot;. I am very anxious that DD might bully DS (anxiety comes from the way my bro treated me). My bro appeared to have no empathy or guilt at the time. Teaching my children empathy is really important to me but I didn&apos;t really know how to do it. Your idea is excellent.

Katie, I agree about labelling the behaviour and not the child. A problem has been that when I tell DD off it seems to have no impact on her. Ever since she was a baby she is likely to just laugh in my face. So I sometimes shout louder or say more horrible things to try to make her cry, to make her sorry for what she has done. I know this is wrong. I know that I need to store up in my mind consequences for her behaviour that really piss her off but aren&apos;t abusive, eg taking away her cloth, making her play upstairs on her own for 5 mins etc. DS is the other way - I ask him nicely if he wouldn&apos;t mind not doing something and he cries loudly and tragically for ages! So I end up being softer with him and DD must notice the difference which must look like favouritism.

I feel very reassured and comforted by you saying that it is ok to come down hard on bad behaviour (I feel I have a problem knowing what is and isn&apos;t ok and normal, I go between not enough discipline because I&apos;m scared of damaging their self esteem to being too controlling and psycho when I can&apos;t take anymore). You are saying it is ok to come down hard on bad behaviour so long as I express strongly that the behaviour is bad and not the child (just reiterating to myself).

RobbieRotten, I SO know what you mean about losing it more when you are in a rush. I get overwhelmed really quickly when I am trying to do more than one thing at once and under pressure for time and then children complicate it all with their bad behaviour. I don&apos;t have much self control at these times. I suppose the thing to do is to prepare lots of things in advance eg the night before and leave extra time. A playground friend said she allows&quot;10 minutes pointless faffing around time&quot;on top of the time she thinks she needs to get out of the house.

I haven&apos;t read this whole thread but have found what I have read so far so helpful. I came it across it yesterday after I&apos;d really lost my temper with ds- but to my shame he had done nothing worse than just not go for his nap after a busy morning&amp;3 attempts. I&apos;m pregnant&amp;my sleep is appalling at the moment. I was so desperate for my break I was angry&amp;frustrated&amp;I upset him. I still am ashamed of it. (he was crying&amp;obviously didn&apos;t know why I was being short tempered&amp;cross with him)

This thread helped make me reflect more and remind myself to count to ten, take time to think of the long term (god, you feel so shit it just isn&apos;t worth it!) and rememebr that we&apos;re not perfect. I&apos;lll be reading more when i&apos;ve time!

Rachel- They have the red, yellow, green card scheme at the DSs school. Apparently it works well. I have tried to do this kind of thing at home, but even star charts tend to get complicated. Also I don&apos;t really want home to be regimented like school is IYKWIM. My DSs are very well behaved at school, and I know it stresses them out having to always be good boys, and to an extent home is a release for them. They do&apos;let it all out&apos;on me. Even so I don&apos;t think I should have to put up with it. I&apos;m contradicting myself here.

However it could be that it is all part of the emotional maturing process. Perhaps children, especially the spirited ones, learn step by step and in different situations to behave appropriately and to learn how to behave empathetically (sp?) It&apos;s probably a good sign that they feel secure enough in their relationship with their mother to completely push the boundaries. It&apos;s bloody exhausting though to be on the receiving end of it.

skydancer what you said here:&quot;children are like intuitive precision-radars and seem to reflect back our state of mind sometimes even before we know what&apos;s going on with ourselves. They pick up on stress levels, unhappy vibes or short fuses and somehow reflect them back to us parents in&apos;bad&apos;behaviour much like one of those exaggerated circus mirrors. So when I can remember this as I start being annoyed with my DS I try to become more aware of my own mental state and to manage it better. If I&apos;m successful I find I can manage my Ds better (and he usually seems happier when I calm down anyway so it often takes away the need to&apos;manage&apos;the child). Often I realise I am preoccupied with something totally unrelated to the child but I haven&apos;t had time or space to deal with so it is&apos;leaking&apos;into how I relate to him.&quot;hits the nail on the head for me and thank you for explaining it so much better than i could do myself.

Over time I have become much more consciously aware of the thoughts, however fleeting, that are constantly passing through my mind. 100% of the time these thoughts are nothing to do with the DC&apos;s but the thoughts make me feel angry almost without realising it and as soon as the DC&apos;s do the tiniest&apos;naughty&apos;thing my anger leaks out at them. I feel terrible as I&apos;m writing this as I realise how often my DC&apos;s have been the innocent victims of my anger which should rightfully have been directed at somebody else (this is where the stately homes thread comes in).

A while ago, when i realised what i was doing i started apologising to DD every time i got angry at her unjustifiably. On the positive side now that I know who I should actually be directing my anger towards, my DC&apos;s are very rarely the targets anymore if at all.

Like I said I do still get cross at DD if I have to tell her not to interrupt for the zillionth time, but I don&apos;t&apos;lose the plot&apos;, I merely tell her very firmly to stop interrupting.

On a very practical note, I have found that if my blood sugar is low I also tend to have a short fuse. It&apos;s easier said than done, but making sure you eat regularly (and not biscuits/sweets/chocolate) is extremely important as is drinking enough water. I am actually quite placid on a full stomach, whereas if i haven&apos;t eaten I am on edge/tense/anxious and it doesn&apos;t take much to set me off.

I can relate to the stress under time pressure thing, that is when I&apos;m not very good either. I am also not good at doing lots of things at once, I need to contrate on one thing at a time (not a multi-tasker obviously) but at the same time I think I ought to be able to do lots of things at once as I am a woman and ALL women are good at multi-tasking....apparently.

So when I am trying to get something done and DD/DS come along and demand me to do something as well....I find it really hard to stay calm. DH just seems to be able to&apos;zone out&apos;the DC&apos;s when they are being demanding and he stays calm and does things when he is ready. But then he only spends probably a tenth of the time with them that I do so perhaps that is something to do with it.

ActingNormal, I got that empathy idea from Alfie Kohn. It&apos;s not my own.

Your child doesn&apos;t have to look remorseful when you point out what they have done wrong. Providing you know they have heard you, it is often enough just to say something.

As for threats, I think some kinds of threats are worse than shouting, the kind that are about taking away a future treat for immediate compliance.

I don&apos;t mean this kind of threat:
&quot;take the bouncy ball outside, it might break the tv&quot;
child continues
&quot;if I can&apos;t trust you not to throw the ball in the living room, I&apos;m going to have to take it off you&quot;

I mean this kind of threat:
&quot;take the bouncy ball outside, it might break the tv&quot;
child continues
&quot;if you don&apos;t stop throwing that ball in here, I won&apos;t take you to the playground later&quot;

Surely it&apos;s better just to shout something simple&apos;Stop throwing the ball&apos;?
 Add message | Report | Message poster MorocconOil Wed 08-Oct-08 15:19:01 
OSOC- I agree with you about the threat with the ball. Obviously it is quite simple that you remove the ball after threatening to do so.

My problem was that my DS calls me an idiot, which is obviously unacceptable. I admit I reacted inappropriately this morning by threatening to cancel his birthday party if he continues to call me an idiot. I was very frazzled, trying to get 3DC ready to get out for the schoolrun.

What sanction would you suggest for this behaviour?
 Add message | Report | Message poster Othersideofthechannel Wed 08-Oct-08 15:42:03 
I probably would just say that he&apos;s entitled to feel cross about what I asked him to do. It&apos;s not much fun having to come and have breakfast when he&apos;s busy but that he needs to find a less hurtful way of expressing his anger. And then we&apos;d try to come up with ideas together.

No need for a sanction IMO.

Just remembered, I thought about something a couple of weeks ago that made me feel better and have a more positive approach.

When the children are naughty or have cried a lot that day instead of feeling angry and feeling the day has been a failure, think that they have learnt more about life that day so the day has been very worthwhile. When they are naughty it is an opportunity to teach them how they should be behaving. When they are expressing their feelings in an extreme way it is an opportunity to teach them how to deal with their feelings. If these things never happen then they won&apos;t learn much! Then when they are older and less open to learning how will they cope when they can&apos;t have their way or something upsets them.

So long as you have made it clear what is and isn&apos;t acceptable behaviour without being abusive and said the right things with the approach of teaching them how to cope in the real world (by behaving in a way that doesn&apos;t upset people or cause danger) and how to be happy (by expressing their negative feelings in words rather than violence and expressing positive feelings/thoughts as well) then you shouldn&apos;t feel guilty about disciplining them but should feel that you have done a good job as a mother.

It is a really important job to do this and a job you should be proud of. The harder work your children are, the more proud you should feel that you are surviving it and not in a mental institute yet.

I hope this doesn&apos;t sound patronising, you all know I am not a smug perfect mother!

yes mimi and others - just had to tell you that mornings can be truly hideous in this house too. what happens is that first of all DD (who is often reminiscent of a human landmine, but never more so than first thing in the morning)has to be fed, nothing else is of greater importance to us ALL than getting her breakfast down her.
(i must have told you that for about a year every single day began at half six in the morning with a massive tantrum because her cornflakes had been poured into her bowl in the WRONG-SHAPED HEAP?).
at the moment they aren&apos;t too bad at getting into uniforms after the briefest and most cursory of washes, bcs the rule is now no playing until dressed. once they are dressed they can play for 20 mins or listen to a story CD. all okay so far.
the trouble then comes with getting them away from said game or CD. if my DD is in one of her PMT-esque moods (and god how i dread the onset of the real thing for her in a few years&apos;time!!) then a massive rage can be sparked by the words&apos;kids -shoes on!&apos;. it&apos;s the interruption that is like a knife through her heart!! she can then lash out at her brother, who reacts (moderately) causing her to get virtually hysterical with heightened rage at how unfair the world is, how&apos;mean&apos;we all are, and how&apos;it isn&apos;t her fault&apos;she&apos;s like this.
my DS and i are SO used to all of this that we exchange a knowing look -he has even got a bit of an adult eye-roll thing going on, at 5 - and leave her to it. eventually she calms down and we get to school but not without a few more spats along the way. it&apos;s SO WEARING.
luckily this is no longer a daily occurence - today was bad bcs she is overtired as having loads of bad dreams but often we get out of the door with only minor skirmishes. but about a year or so ago things were terrible. i remember one conversation with her on the way to school&apos;mummy when i grow up i want to be a scientist, you know making those magic potions&apos;-&apos;oh yes darling, you mean a chemist, that&apos;s a sort of scientist&apos;- cue monumental tantrum bcs she was confused by the word chemist and i had contradicted her (in her view). argh!!!it was so prolonged and dreadful that i phoned my DH (who escapes to work with GLEE long before we get out of the house)to let him listen in on the hell that he was missing out on! he liked that a lot

so she can talk about how frustrated she gets and can discuss possible strategies for the future. we even made a list tonight, DS helped too. except that the anger-calming ones never work!!! (punching pillows, counting to ten etc). all that works is leaving her to it in her room. i suppose that&apos;s something!

Hi actingnormal and oneplusoen - I&apos;m glad you can relate so much to the thing about children reflecting us back. I meant to qualify that one by also saying along the lines of - of course they are individuals too with their own agendas/feelings/whole-universe-within going on! And then there&apos;s the whole sibling thing and just having more than one child - when I read you all with bigger families I start getting a bit about my struggles with one. But I comfort myself I came into this business rather late in life -had all those years thinking it was hard enough just looking after myself .

I love what some of you on here have written about your relationship with your DCs...such as really looking at your children (AN? - sorry, too tired to read back now) and so many practical, useful strategies. I knew the one about coming down on the behaviour not the person - but still that is good to be reminded of as it is very important for self-view, self-esteem/keeping integrity.

Well I had an easier day with my DS I&apos;m sure because of this thread. I remembered to enjoy him and have fun with him and laugh a lot. He still had nuclear tantrums a few times (supermarket was one lovely experience of course - they let me jump a whole check-out queue in sympathy )

Oh and Ds told me he didn&apos;t want to go to nursery today (he only goes for a few hours) because&apos;its dirty&apos;. I still took him, poor lamb.

Since sunday, I have been so much more positive towards him. I even missed him so much last night, i took him into my bed when i went up so i could feel him close by. I have lapsed a couple of times when he has been hurting his baby sister (defo bad behaviour) however it seemed to stop him quicker than before. A GP once told me that it just becomes&apos;white noise&apos;to dc when we shout/raise our voices on a regular basis. In 3 days I have started to enjoy my children. I cannot tell you how grateful I am, especially to Balanomorey for starting this thread. I have so often thought of seeking help with my parenting and this thread has made me more determined to overcome my difficulties. It has inspired me to become the mummy i want to be.

I just had a read back over this thread as it was quiet and found the stuff about how deeply boring childcare can be (when the DC are smaller) and it made me laugh. Mimizan talking about how a friend of hers could do all that play acting imaginary stuff for hours and someone else saying how people who are like that are so helpful but aren&apos;t they a bit mad/weird LOL. It reminded me of when we had some guests to stay for a few days in the summera friend through work and his wife whom I didnt really know beforehand. I confess that at first I found his wife a bit odd and a bit of a drippy bore but then discovered she was an absolute genius at relating to my DS in terms of engaging with constant role-play, repetitive dialogues, imaginary scenesI mean she could do it for well over an hour at a stretch happily! I decided she was a great guest immediately.

ActingNormal and OnePlusOne: have just been having a quick look at the Stately Homes thread. I could cry at some of the situations described on there by you both and the other posters.

But I just had to say to you both how brilliant you are for actually trying to change things for your own DC after the really quite shitty upbringing you have experienced yourselves. It also made me understand how bloody hard employing empathy techniques with your children must be. I mean, when your DC are kicking up a huge fuss about something trivial, I have said that the way I deal with that is try and put myself in their shoes and realise that to them that it isn&apos;t trivial. Now that I&apos;ve read your posts on the other thread, I can understand that you must surely be thinking in those situations&quot;Oh, FGS, if THAT&apos;S all you&apos;ve got to whinge about then you&apos;re bloody lucky&quot;.

The other thing I can see now is that it kind of explains how much reassurance you want that you are doing the right thing. If you have only ever experienced bad parenting yourself, you are bound to be unsure about what is good parenting and what is ok and what is downright shit. It makes it that much harder for you both, and I can really appreciate that now.

And lastly, can I just say, that apart from a bit of shouting and the odd smack (that probably happened in most people&apos;s houses growing up in those days), my childhood was just about perfect. I could cry for everyone who has not experienced that, and I have so much respect for you both for trying to turn things around and really trying SOOO hard to make your own DC&apos;s childhoods so much better than your own. I can really see that having your own children must stir up bad memories from your own childhood and that the parts that the rest of us mums find stressful enough are 10 times more stressful for mums like you to deal with.

Welcome Makkapakka Fantastic you are finding this helpful.

Skydancer- my friend who is great at imaginary play loves seeing our DC but freely admits she can only manage one overnight stay with us. She then returns to her child-free house and sleeps for about 24 hours to recover. 

I have been trying to put myself in the DC&apos;s shoes it bit more. This morning DS was awkward again, he was insisting he had to take his Man City cap to school with him. However we didn&apos;t know where it was and we were late. I acknowledged that he really wanted it, but explained we had to get to school in time. I said we would find it when he came home. He wasn&apos;t convinced and I had to walk off so he&apos;d follow, but I didn&apos;t shout and didn&apos;t threaten to cancel his party. I&apos;m not feeling guilty now either, so it was a win, win, win situation.

Rachel and Katie, thank you. Your posts brought tears to my eyes. You are very kind. Also clever - this bit is SO right:

&quot;If you have only ever experienced bad parenting yourself, you are bound to be unsure about what is good parenting and what is ok and what is downright shit.&quot;

I&apos;m scared to do anything remotely similarly to my parents (even though some of what they did might have been right!), because I don&apos;t want my DCs to feel the way I felt, but then I go the other way and I&apos;m not sure if I am going too far the other way. I find it hard to find a middle way and am trying to learn what is normal from people who I consider to be&apos;normal&apos;. MN is a wonderful way to learn about lots of other people&apos;s approaches and views rather than only having my parents&apos;skewed view as a role model.

At the moment my parenting seems to go from one extreme to the other and I&apos;m sure my children don&apos;t know&apos;who&apos;I am going to be from one day, or sometimes one hour, to the next.

Therapist said it is due to my lack of understanding and implementation of boundaries, not just boundaries of what behaviour, eg hitting, is ok and what is not but personal boundaries of how much demand you allow people to put on you and how much you allow them to take from you. He said if I don&apos;t sort out my own boundaries I won&apos;t be teaching the children what boundaries are generally acceptable with other people they will interact with.

Eg. DD wants lots of attention. I feel I should give it to her because I didn&apos;t get much and I know how that feels. I don&apos;t ever want to say no to her because it feels like I&apos;m rejecting her and I know that rejection feels horrible. So I let her be all over me, giving me no space, for a time until I suddenly can&apos;t take it anymore so I swing the other way and tell her to get away from me etc (rejecting her too much, when this situation came about in the first place because I was scared to reject her a little bit).

Does this make sense?
 Add message | Report | Message poster katiek123 Thu 09-Oct-08 14:54:10 
AN

makes TOTAL sense. i have a tendency towards poor boundaries myself in a less extreme way. i have not been good at setting boundaries with my extremely attention-seeking demanding DD (as am sure is sometimes clear from the situations i describe getting into with her) in the past and this is bcs i got rather short shrift from my (very decent and kind, but not especially touchy-feely!) parents for some of my anxious behaviour as a kid. like DD, i was very anxious as a child, but did not have her anger issues. i strongly remember feeling scared of all sorts of things (the dark, my heart stopping beating etc) and the reaction was usually of the pull your socks up variety, impatience etc. nothing at ALL abusive (bar the odd sharp smack, but as rachel says who didn&apos;t get that sort of treatment meted out now and again at that time, the 70s as this was for me).

i have therefore swung too far the other way, wanting to be the ever-patient, ever-understanding sort of mother, but letting myself be ground down in the process - and flying off the handle in the past really badly out of the blue when i finally did lose it now and again.

at the end of the day so much of this is about how we were parented ourselves isn&apos;t it. but self-awareness definitely helps!!

Yes it did sound a bit like it could have been said in a phoney American accent didn&apos;t it? It&apos;s funny but DS was lovely on the walk home from school. Perhaps it was because we parted this morning on good terms? However I don&apos;t think they think about these things as much as we do. 

Katiek- know what you mean about trying to be everso everso all the time. I do the same and completely blow-up every so often under the strain of it all. I am terribly inconsistent about some stuff. It&apos;s definitely because I am unclear about boundaries, having had few set for me as a child. It is soooo hard trying to learn them as an adult to set for your own DC and I doubt myself all the time.

I haven&apos;t been able to check in here for a few hours and as usual it&apos;s fascinating! I still haven&apos;t got round to reading the Stately homes thread (has someone linked it here? I can&apos;t even find it) but I will when I have more time. I&apos;m interested in what people have to say about over compensating with attention because they didn&apos;t receive enough themselves. And not having established proper boundaries due to not wanting to withhold from their DCs. Snap. I think this is one of my strengths and at the same time my weakness -because I received negative or absent attention a lot as a small child I think it&apos;s left me with an insecurity or worry about not giving enough good attention to my DC. I think I&apos;ve no doubt gone the other way - being over&apos;available&apos;or&apos;ever-present&apos;and then suffered the consequences and wonder why the hell my DS wont leave me alone . So hard to get the balance right.

Skydancer- I&apos;m definitely guilty of overcompensating for my DP&apos;S lack of interest time in my life as a child. I am always at the DCs&apos;school and help out in every way I can. I feel exhausted this week having been in there for about 7 hours. My DP&apos;s knew nothing about what went on at school for me, the good and the bad. I feel it so important to be involved and I feel lucky to be a SAHM ATM.

Sometimes I wonder if the DC will look back and say&apos;We couldn&apos;t get away from our Mum. She was always at school doing this, and doing that and would never leave us alone&apos; 

My DP&apos;s probably never thought about these kind of issues, and still don&apos;t. They lack the self-awareness I think people on here and the Stately Homes thread are gifted with.

I know, I know, I know!!! I have perfected the silent scream - you turn away from them, open your mouth and silently scream for a few seconds until I calm down. Crazy I know but it works for me.

It only happens about once a week or less now as I try to look at everything they do as a need in them (not something they&apos;ve decided to do just to irritate the hell out of you). If they use going to the potty as a delay tactic - they need to be with you as much as they possibly can - so turn up late to nursery if you can.

When I once found myself towering over mine and shouting I put myself in his shoes and thought no wonder you&apos;re carrying on showing off - if someone did this to me I would too.

Give them as much freedom as you can - allow them to make mistakes and teach themselves to do things - it stops so much frustration.

Thanks Katiek and mimizan for your posts and understanding. Katiek your mum joking (I hope!) she used your fontanelle for an ashtray stand gave me a wry smile. I remember being lulled to sleep in the comforting glow of my mother&apos;s cigarettes. Mimizan you did not come over as smug at all. I&apos;ve noticed a lot of us say things along the lines of&quot;Who am I to be saying this?&quot;and it&apos;s usually something very very good and worth saying. I think we&apos;re supporting one another here and nobody is coming from on high or from a&apos;know it all&apos;place.

Torrential rain and our living room flooded tonight. Grrrrr- goodnight.

Wow, I haven&apos;t been here for a few days, and so much has happened! This thread is just a complete reassurance to me, so many of the situations people have mentioned are ones that have happened with me and my ds1, and I have hated myself for the way I have behaved with him and felt so alone. I am so happy we are working ourselves out of the dark tunnel and I feel so optimistic about our relationship now.

One thing that worked for me was when I was in a rage and shouting at him was trying to picture how it must look - I&apos;m quite tall and the image of myself towering over my little boy, yelling at him while he had a shocked scared look on his face, well it just makes me feel sick and so ashamed of myself, and i try and picture that image as soon as I find the&apos;red mist&apos;descending, and it always makes me take a step back, and i use that moment to calm down and think of a different way to deal with whatever the problem is.

Dear All
DD at playgroup so I have a few mins to post.

Don&apos;t really know where to start with responding as so much has been posted this week. A lot of it I can relate to so much and it has been such interesting reading. I am in awe of the wisdom and fantastic advice you all have given and of your honesty as well.

Was particularly interested to read your post skydancer about how much to give in to dcs demands just for an easy life. Am having a particularly bad week with dd - she is being very stroppy and demanding. She barks orders at me - shut the door....all the way closed, give me my book, I want a drink. If you suggest she does these things for herself, she goes into meltdown. But what am I teaching her if I keep doing it for her? So am going down the path of&apos;do it yourself&apos;and facing the consequences. SIGH!

I am also up and down like a yo-yo putting different dvds on for her - as she gets bored of them after a short time. I&apos;m fed up of dancing to her tune!

All this bad behaviour has been testing me to the limits this week. I had a bad day on Weds as was p&apos;d off cos she wouldn&apos;t go to nursery so didn&apos;t get the me time I was looking forward to. Ashamed to say I took it out on her by practically ignoring her all morning, didn&apos;t do anything with her and her demanding ways wound me up to the hilt so was shouty again and she ended up on the naughty mat loads. A bad morning. Later when I reflected on it, I know I should have been more grown up about missing out on my me time and just got on with the situation.....so another lesson learnt.

But on the whole, I have been more controlled and have stopped myself from going off the deep end on several occasions by either trying distraction tactics or just taking a deep breath and letting her tantrum til the tantrum has blown itself out.

She has turned into such a drama queen - are your dcs the same? Such sill little things set off a major tantrum eg Today she went into hysterical tears because she couldn&apos;t open the Argos catalogue as it&apos;s a bit big and hefty - it was the end of the world. When do they get to the stage of saying brightly&quot;Mummy, can you open this book for me, it&apos;s a bit heavy&quot;- oh when, oh when, oh when!!!!! This type of behaviour REALLy gets me down as it&apos;s constant and draining. We can have several of this type of episode a day. She told me off for taking the top off the toothpaste as she wanted to do it - stupid thing is, I&apos;m beginning to feel guilty for not pre-empting the things she wants to do...how sad is that!!!

Lovely thread.

I also am dealing with anger issues but in my case I work so hard at not letting DDs see how cross I am that it all comes bubbling out at poor DH/work/my mum/the milkman.

And DC do pick up on it whether you show it or not.

I find lack of sleep is a big trigger for bad mood, both for me and DD1. Also, hunger/thirst, and too much sugar.

In an ideal world, we&apos;d all be well rested, and we&apos;d never fight with any of our loved ones! But in the meantime, I guess we just get through the best we can..

Balanomorey i want to respond to this bit:

&quot;She barks orders at me - shut the door....all the way closed, give me my book, I want a drink. If you suggest she does these things for herself, she goes into meltdown. But what am I teaching her if I keep doing it for her?&quot;

When do they get to the stage of saying brightly&quot;Mummy, can you open this book for me, it&apos;s a bit heavy&quot;- oh when, oh when, oh when!!!!!&quot;

DD is 3.10 but has definitely enjoyed bossing me about for the last year in a way that DS never did. She is also fiercely independent and can have a tantrum if I do something for her without giving her a chance to try herself.

What works for me is:

With the orders requests, I usually just tell her that she needs to ask politely and then do it for her when she has asked politely. I phrase it differently so I don&apos;t get too bored eg

&apos;that sounds bossy, can you think of a nicer way to ask&apos;
&apos;I&apos;ll do it for you when you&apos;ve asked me politely&quot;
mimic her bossiness and then say&apos;try again in a kind voice&apos;

I can&apos;t tell you how often I&apos;ve had to do this but to give you an idea DS now occasionally says&apos;tone of voice!&apos;to his sister before I get a chance.

Of course always model the behaviour you want by asking her politely too.

Don&apos;t feel guilty about not remembering to let her do things. After all for years you&apos;ve had to do this stuff for her, so it takes a bit of practice to get out of the habit. You could explain this to her. When DD is getting upset because I turned on the tap when she was about to I try to inject a note of humour:
eg hit my head with the base of my palm&apos;doh! Silly mummy! When will I remember what a big girl DD is!&quot;and then get her to say&apos;silly mummy, you forgot I can reach the tap now&apos;

I hope this helps.

Oh and don&apos;t worry that you&apos;ll be a doormat. as you post shows, 3 is an age where they can&apos;t decide whether they want to be dependent or independent so best to go with the flow.

You can start insisting she does things for herself when she is older.

hi balanomorey, I can relate to everything you have said!

Yesterday evening I was up and down like a yo-yo, between the 2 DC&apos;s wanting a drink/snack/cuddle etc etc, I eventually blew a fuse and yelled at them to leave me alone. In my defence I was also down with a virus (kindly given to me by said DC&apos;s) and severely sleep deprived as DC&apos;s up most of the last 4 nights with their coughs (well they slept through but i got woken up every hour or so by their earth shattering coughs) (how can such small people produce such LOUD coughs?)

But, am feeling good today as finally got an uninterrupted night&apos;s sleep last night and have whole day to myself as both DC&apos;s are at school/nursery til 4.30. Hurray!

I do think a lot of the time our bad moods/anger are due to just getting so worn out/down by it all, the lack of sleep/tiredness and just not being able to take care of ourselves enough.

I can totally relate to the being in a grump with DC because they don&apos;t want a nap as it means your&apos;me&apos;time goes out the window. I have most definately been there and done that. I now don&apos;t expect DS to go for a nap, he is 2.5 nearly, but he has some quiet time after lunch on the sofa and after a while he usually keels over and i put a blanket over him and manage to get a bit of time to myself til i have to go and pick up DD from school.

My DD is a professional drama queen, goes into meltdown if DS even looks at any of her stuff. I try and be patient with her as i can see that for her it&apos;s a big deal, but it&apos;s hard. I think I am gradually getting a bit better at it and probably by the time the DC&apos;s are adults I will have cracked it.

Only have five minutes before his royal highness the toddler will need me again but just to say quickly I agree with Otherside about modelling requests and thank you&apos;s. My Ds can do them when he&apos;s not too frantic&quot;Please can I have...&quot;But most of the time it&apos;s WANT xx! quickly followed by repetitions in escalating volume&quot; AAARH (wail etc.). I usually do the&apos;I&apos;m deaf or stupid&apos;thing of saying&quot;I can&apos;t understand waah, waaah or whining, can you say it properly please?. Or I model it:&quot;Say to me&apos;I want the keys, please&apos;and then mummy will say&apos;Ok, here you are&apos;. Or if it&apos;s something I can&apos;t or don&apos;t want to give DS at that point then - well haven&apos;t cracked it yet but I try to divert on to something DS can have. Like Oneplusone hoping to have it cracked by the time he&apos;s eighteen .

As to the general thing BM brought up of being bossed by your tots - tell me about it! May have time to write later.

I&apos;m sorry to gatecrash this thread so far in but I&apos;ve been trying to read it all week - finally managed it tonight (2 hours!!). I know - how my Friday nights have changed since the arrival of 2 dc!

I have so much sympathy and empathy for balanomorey and as for actingnormal, she has painted the picture of how I can completely imagine things being in 3 years.

Dd is 2.4 and when she is good, she is an absolute delight - engaging, endearing and so much fun. She has a real zest for life and loves people. She is full of energy and doesn&apos;t seem to stop... ever! However, these characteristics seem to come coupled with a fierce determination and an incredibly strong will. She also talks incessantly.

Like many of the other posters on here, I lose it with her. Not all of the time but when she&apos;s pushed one too many of my buttons and especially if I&apos;m tired/hungry/in a rush/ds is crying.I end up shouting at her and always regret it afterwards. The thing is, I know it doesn&apos;t help and while I&apos;m in control of the situation I can do all the things I know I should do but I&apos;ll suddenly hit a point when I see red.

I have always been someone who can lose their temper quickly (though not often) but it is always over just as quickly and I
rarely sulk.

What worries me is that I look at the way dd plays with others and the way she says no to them (and to me) and I worry that she has learnt it from me. I would describe her temperament (sp?) as being very similar to mine and I often wonder about the whole nature/nurture thing.

This evening, after bath, ds (6months) was crying because he was tired and hungry so i was trying to get dd into her pyjamas quickly and she kept running away and being silly. She then started making loud screechy noises that she knows ds is scared of which just made him worse and I grabbed her and quite forcefully lay her down holding her still so that I could dress her. I didn&apos;t hurt her but I know I didn&apos;t handle the situation as well as I could have done.

I find I have some days (even weeks) where she can be lovely and I don&apos;t need to say a harsh word to her all day. But then at other times (the majority of the time), I feel like I am in a constant battle and find myself wondering how much I actually&apos;like&apos;her. It feels like such a horrible thing to say but sometimes I am just waiting for the next issue to arise and there&apos;s no way they can be predicted. She&apos;s just so volatile.

Can there be anything hormonal in their behaviour at such a young age? There just seems to be no other reason sometimes.

Finally, I worry about how all this battling affects ds. He used to seem like quite a chilled out baby but for the last couple of months has been much more unsettled. I&apos;ve put it down to teething but wonder whether he can pick up on a difficult atmosphere.

Sorry to write so much - it all just comes flooding out!

NDG
godo to read you!
my DD is&apos;hormonal&apos;in the layman sense in a big way and it is genuinely innate, i&apos;m completely sure of that! her moods just swing about from minute to minute, though of course it is worse when she is being eg rushed out to school in the morning or if her bro has aggravated her. but i find myself firmly in the nature camp, i must say. she has been this way from day 1. at her worst there were many days i wondered how much i liked her too (well i didn&apos;t wonder - i knew ) but she has a biological inbuilt survival mechanism, my DH and i reckon - just as we are about to throw our hands up in surrender she comes out of her bad patch in the nick of time (but those bad patches can last days) and becomes all funny and cute and feisty (in a cool way(!)) and interesting/bright/inquisitive again and lo, there is light at the end of that GODDAMNED tunnel again.

my DS has survived all of this admirably and is now 5 (she is 7) and pretty mature for his age. i can now talk to him ina very adult way about his sister&apos;s moods and he is very understanding. eg i said to him yesterday&apos;DD is very controlling isn&apos;t she - she liked you to do exactly what she says in her games, doesn&apos;t she. that&apos;s fine as long as you&apos;re both having fun, but you need to know that it&apos;s OK to walk away and leave the room if she is getting too controlling and it stops being fun&apos;. he is completely able to take that sort of thing in now and understand - i&apos;ve always been impressed by how he handles her. they actually get on really well. so don&apos;t worry about your DS. there is no doubt that ALL younger sibs are affected by the character of the elder one(s) - that&apos;s just life - but it needn&apos;t be in a negative way even if number one is tricky at times!

Katiek - I&apos;m relieved to hear how well your ds is doing. My dd absolutely loves her little brother but I think that&apos;s because her world is affected very little by him at the moment. I&apos;m dreading him moving and being able to get at her toys!! I just feel so sorry for him when dd and I are having a barney becasue I think it makes the atmosphere so horrible.

It has been a real relief to hear that some posters have found ways to improve their behaviour (that&apos;s the mums rather than their dc). My dh really hates it when I get cross with dd but he is such a chilled out person and also, he doesn&apos;t have to be with her all day every day.

Having said that, perhaps a way in which I could improve is to imagine dh watching me at all times and think about what he would do. I am far more tolerant when he is around.

This thread has given me so much to think about. I&apos;m particularly interested in the sound of the&apos;Raising your pririted child&apos;book. I think a trip to the library wouldn&apos;t go amiss...

I am so irritated by everything right now. As soon as DD saw DS when I picked him up from preschool she aggravated him and has been getting on his nerves and my nerves ever since. She didn&apos;t do anything that you would call naughty to him but he is so oversensitive that the slightest thing makes him do this shrieking whining noise. His noise irritates me and I know that really he is being too sensitive but I feel really irritated with her . I ask her not to do anything to set him off but she continues. She wants his attention and wants him to play with her but he wants a bit of space.

I want to concentrate on driving but she is talking nonsense and making silly noises constantly and DS is doing his shrieking whining. I ask her to be quiet for a few moments but she just doesn&apos;t seem to have the self control. She doesn&apos;t have ADHD because she is fine at school and can concentrate on art and craft and writing that she is doing at home.

When she isn&apos;t making a noise she is fiddling and fiddling with things that aren&apos;t toys which winds me up because I don&apos;t want things messed up or broken. She can&apos;t sit still or quiet for even a moment.

We get home and she runs at high speed up and down and leaps about and bosses DS around and gets so wild if I don&apos;t stop her that DS ends up getting hurt.

The noise and movement makes me really on edge and anxious and I just want her to shut up and keep still. It is probably me who has the problem, some kind of anxious thing. But once I&apos;ve got this wound up I don&apos;t even want DD to speak at all or be anywhere near me. I feel really angry and feel that I shouldn&apos;t be reacting this strongly. I find it hard to control myself enough to not be horrible and shouty and ranting. Surely I shouldn&apos;t want to get away from my own DD?

People think DS is more annoying because he cries and whines so much and often you can&apos;t even breath near him without setting him off. Yet I don&apos;t feel the same anger and urge to escape from him as I do with DD. I feel like I am deranged and a horrible person. Sometimes I am not like this and I can be calm but other times I just feel like I can&apos;t do it.

Does anyone else get like this? How do I stop being like this?

Sounds like a typical 5 yr old after school to me! DS is so in need of release after containing himself at school all afternoon I am relieved to get him across the car park safely.

Can you pinpoint what it is that makes you able to cope somedays at not others?

I find expecting it to be hard work makes it easier!

Do you think a story CD would work in the car to keep her from making silly noises so that you are in a better frame of mind when you get home? Or all singing loud songs together?

Our smoothest evenings are when I have the energy to put on a CD and get them dancing as soon as we are through the door, or something similar.

I took her from school, home, got ready for ballet, got taxi to get car from garage, drove from there to ballet, drove from ballet to nursery to get DS. So she was probably a bit crazy from being so non stop. I do find she seems wilder after ballet anyway. Is it just tiredness then? And could DS be tired from a day at nursery (9.30am til 5.30pm ish - quite a long day for a 3 year old). Am I just expecting too much from them when they are too tired?

Getting to ballet isn&apos;t normally so complex, just that the car had to have work done on it today and we had to go and collect it first so we were more rushed.

The ballet teacher is DH&apos;s friend so that is why DD goes to her class and not one in our town or one at the weekend.

I didn&apos;t get to do anything I enjoyed today because I was busy with tedious chores so I probably was less tolerant.

I do feel better when I take into account the children&apos;s tiredness and my grumpiness from having nothing enjoyable in my day. It feels better when there is a reason for it. Thank you

I am sure your DS is also tired after a full day of nursery.

Glad you&apos;re feeling better.
 Add message | Report | Message poster ActingNormal Tue 14-Oct-08 10:53:13 
I feel a bit better today, thanks. I realise I am a bit unfair to DD because I expect her to modify her behaviour, even when she isn&apos;t really doing anything wrong, so as to not&apos;set off&apos;DS. I expect her to be the grown up one and modify her behaviour but in lots of cases it is DS who I should be expecting more from. Eg. if he is shrieking with annoyance just because DD is looking at him or singing to him, he is being too sensitive. If he carries on like that he will find it hard to cope in real life.

Nothing much that I say to him seems to stop him reacting like this and I&apos;m thinking maybe I need to just ignore it. By telling DD off each time I am encouraging him to react to the little things that she does. So unless she has done something most children would react to I think I should ignore his reaction and not say anything at all. I think it is the same when he cries tragically if I say no about anything. I then try to think of anything to do or say to stop him crying because it hurts my heart, and my ears, and irritates me, but I suppose he is learning that his reaction gets my attention. His extreme reactions make me scared to tell him off. I need to ignore him at these times as well!

It feels strange to think of doing absolutely nothing as being a parenting technique! I&apos;m so scared to ignore a crying child, because of my own childhood experiences, but I think I am doing more harm than good with the way I am doing things. I find it so hard to not be all one way or all the other!

AN- your post is a reminder to me that I often blame DS2 for making DD scream. The noise she makes is quite persistent, pierces my head and I just want it to STOP. Often she does it when he&apos;s trying to be nice, as your DD does by singing or joining in her game. When she shrieks I usually just go,&apos;OH DS2 why can&apos;t you just leave her alone?&apos;. Sometimes he has behaved badly towards her, but more often hasn&apos;t really done anything.

I suppose a more effective way to deal with it is to observe what&apos;s happening, try and get them to play co-operatively by joining in with them sometimes, (not all the time.) It is hard though as often I am trying to get on with making tea. I suppose I could involve them all in that, then they wouldn&apos;t be left to their own devices.

Not sure how much I can add at this point, but just wanted to say this is by far the best thread I&apos;ve ever read on MN - only came across it today - thanks to everyone who&apos;s been so honest and unjudgy.

I can identify hugely with much of what&apos;s been posted. My DDs are 5 and 1, and I worry a lot about how angry I get sometimes - as the OP said, the rage seems to come from nowhere, and I feel I don&apos;t always have a chance to stop it, which is scary. My DH thinks I need professional help with anger management (if only I had the time...)

Thanks to the OP for starting this conversation, and to everyone for your contributions - much food for thought.

Hi All
Again been reading with interest the trials and tribulations of all of you with more than one dc - God knows how hard that must be to have one winding the other up must be unbearable! I don&apos;t know how I&apos;d cope with 2!! Acting, glad today was better than yesterday - I too always seem to have a bad day when I have an agenda to get through. All the messing about and bad behaviour seems far worse when you have to be somewhere!

Wondering what you think of dds behaviour which, at the moment, I am finding challenging. Have any of you come accross this? DD has taken to bursting into tears if you tell her to&apos;SHHHH&apos;- ie politely,&quot;shut up&quot;! She seems to be so sensitive to it and it really upsets her. Sometimes, it has to be said though dosn&apos;t it, especially if on the phone etc. A lady at playgroup said it to her today as I was trying to talk to her and dd kept interrupting with&quot;Mummy.....&quot;- she hid in my skirts and refused to be talked round. Felt a bit sorry for her as i was trying to explain why we say SHHH sometimes and she said,&quot;But Mummy, I just want to talk to you&quot;and this morning at playgroup she was trying to get my attention cos she needed a wee . She seems to be taking it really personally - I guess it&apos;s her sensitive side coming out. She&apos;s the same with the word&quot;No&quot;which i can understand a bit more. DH and I have made a point of SHHH-shing(sp?) each other a lot on purpose to illustrate that we get told to shut up too sometimes and that it&apos;s OK to be told that and not to get upset...but it hasn&apos;t worked. What shall I do? I don&apos;t want her to be upset as it upsets me too. But sometimes these things have to be said! She just seems to be so over sensitive at the moment - you only need to look at her the wrong way and she cries...it&apos;s making everything twice as hard...but it has definately made me think twice about shouting as i don&apos;t want to upset her even more. This thread has been invaluable to me. Thanks so much all. PS sorry it&apos;s a bit rambly - am trying to hurry before DH comes up to bed! x.

Balanomorey, it&apos;s difficult to know how to handle interruptions, isn&apos;t it? When DS1 was younger, I made the mistake of explaining to him the reasons why we shouldn&apos;t interrupt people and to make sure that anything that he DID feel the need to interrupt for was really important i.e. he needed a wee, or to tell me that DS2 had fallen over in the next room or something. Stupidly, I thought that a 3 year old&apos;s idea of what is&quot;important&quot;would be the same as mine. Hence, subsequent interruptions went like this: [DS1 tugs frantically at my sleeve, bouncing up and down]&quot;Mum, mum!!! MUUUUUUM!&quot;Me:&quot;Remember what we said? Is it really important - can&apos;t it wait till I&apos;ve finished talking?&quot;Him:&quot;No! It is really really important!&quot;Me:&quot;Okay, what&apos;s the matter?&quot;Him:&quot;There&apos;s a new series of Thomas starting next Monday on Nick Jr!&quot;

 

If anyone knows of a good way to deal with interruptions without them having to pee on the floor, I&apos;d love to know!

Balano, your DD sounds as sensitive as my DS. He cries tragically if I say no, even if I say it as gently as I can. He WON&apos;T be quiet when I&apos;ssssh&apos;him and often ends up making even more noise. I have to threaten to take something off him to make him quieten down. I asked him to whisper instead of talk at a wedding and he shouted&quot;I WHISPER MUMMY&quot;then he saw a big clock on the wall and shouted&quot;LOOK AT THAT BIG COCK!&quot;(he couldn&apos;t say clock properly at that stage).

Does anyone have any advice on this situation:

DS (3) and his friend (2.5) in the back of my car. I don&apos;t like driving and feel anxious driving. The kids are making noises at each other, not really being naughty, but then they become louder and louder and provoke each other. My DS is oversensitive and the noise makes him cry. His friend enjoys DS&apos;s reaction and roars at him again. DS cries more. His friend isn&apos;t really doing anything wrong just by roaring but all the noise is making it hard for me to concentrate on driving so I&apos;m getting stressed. His friend carries on. Now I think that he has crossed the line and is being naughty because he can see that he is upsetting DS and is continuing on purpose. His mother does NOT think that her DS is being naughty, just that my DS is being oversensitive. She thinks that her DS behaves like that because he is copying my DS. This is partly true but it is not true that my DS is ALWAYS the one who starts it. We had an argument about it. We did both tell off our children though so that seems fair.

I&apos;m a bit confused about who is right and wrong. Other parents use my children&apos;s oversensitivity as an excuse to say that their children have not done anything wrong, mine have just overreacted to something that isn&apos;t naughty - even on occasions where the other child has physically hurt one of mine! I am starting to get very defensive. I admit my children, especially DS, are too sensitive, but some of the times the other child has genuinely done something wrong and their parent dismisses it and says it is just my child being oversensitive. I&apos;ve started watching DS like a hawk to see exactly who did what so that I can defend him if I need to. Parents don&apos;t take kindly to me standing up for myself/my children at all!

I&apos;ve had a long conversation with DS&apos;s friend&apos;s mother about today and we&apos;ve both talked out our feelings and decided the best thing is for her to sit in the back with them when we are driving to calm them down because it is hard to ignore noise when you are driving and are a nervous driver. Also that we will watch them together more closely when not in the car and try to judge when it IS oversensitivity and when it is naughty behaviour and who did it first and whether we need to tell one or both of them off.

Will this work? Can I do anything else to help DS cope with other children better? I want him to learn how to cope with them without crying all the time before he goes to school next September.

AN - i think you did a sterling job of trying to sort out the rights and wrongs of a very tricky situation. the best thing you could have done was sit down with the other mother and thrash it out, and the agreement you came to seems sensible to me. all very very difficult for you - esp in the car i agree that makes it SO much worse!
my DD has always been hypersensitive to noise (i remember one particularly nightmareish fireworks party...what were we thinking of??! .has got better with time and i was lucky not to have encountered many problems in this respect with other kids thankfully - like you (and my dd...genetic alert yet again!!) my nerves are SHREDDED by noise, esp high-pitched kiddie screams and the like.
also sensitive to telling-off just as you and balano have found. v hard to tell her off, look at her the wrong way and she used to break down etc. so difficult in social situations so often. same same same. again - better with time. after school still v sensitive time though and still happens fairly regularly.
must go persuade my DS, DD and pal into bath now - back soon! chin up girls! xx

I think it is too much to expect a 2.5 yr old or a 3 yr old to be quiet because they are upsetting the other child.

Not worth working out who is right or wrong. If a similar situation occurs, stick on a CD, sing or similar distraction.

Hello all

My God, this has been the best post, I laughed so much earlier that my pelvic floor disintegrated. My dd&apos;s are 10 and 4 and the 10 year old was the most perfect child, slept right through at 6 weeks, biddable, adorable toddler (with blonde ringlets and pink cheeks to boot!). She&apos;s a little sod at the moment now though - those pre-teen hormones are really kicking in.

Little Miss 4 year old, on the other hand, is a&apos;challenge&apos;- didn&apos;t sleep through the night until she was 3, laughs when I try to chastise her, especially if I use a reasonable, calm voice and when she laughs at me pretending to be my (saintly, patient, infinitely kind) mother I get the giggles, her other trick is to feign deafness (AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGH). She winds me up to the point of Mount Vesuvius (sp?) eruptions and just cackles and scampers off or screams and chucks things in temper (unfortunately, she got this from me). She will not be helped with anything and is instantly frustrated when things do not go wrong. And she does all the eye-rolling, tutting stuff.

Oh, and I&apos;ve just discovered I am up the duff again, I am wondering what this next one will be like.

OtherSide, not sure if I agree with you or not - if a child is roaring over and over again at another one on purpose because they like their reaction (crying), surely this is something they could/should control themselves from doing?

But it has made me think that I think I do often expect too much from my DCs and sometimes I should expect them to be&apos;crazy&apos;, eg my kids were getting&apos;mental&apos;by tea time today and I probably shouldn&apos;t have been too cross with them because they were really tired after going on a sleep over last night and not sleeping til really late. I think I should remind myself to think&quot;Am I expecting too much?&quot;when I&apos;m about to go mad at them for something.

I think sometimes blanking out their noise in my mind and somehow learning not to hear it would be a good parenting technique.

Grumpy, I like it when I see more proof that it isn&apos;t all about how crap/or not our parenting is but that some children really are just born to be more challenging than others.

I think you should expect a 4 or 5 yr old to show empathy but some 3 yr olds might not be able to manage it. DD is 3.10 and it is something I am just starting to see.

Hi everyone
Just wanted to say how much I LOVE this thread and sympathise with you all! DS1 (2.4) is very sensitive and is not yet dealing well with the arrival of DS2 (5mo) which has removed him from his little prince pedestal....
Anyway for all of you who have (over)sensitive children (and may be sensitive yourselves), can I recommend this book which has been brilliant for me, both with DS and as I recognise myself in it and in him.

Right, I remind myself that today is a long day for my DD as she has done school and I am about to take her to ballet, and a long day for DS as he will have been at nursery all day when we collect him. So I must try to remember not to be too intolerant of their wild behaviour when we get home because it will be because they are tired so I should EXPECT it. I&apos;ll post again later, probably having failed to control myself and in a right mood .

How did you get on AN? Were the DC wild or calm, and did you manage not to lose it?
 Add message | Report | Message poster ActingNormal Mon 20-Oct-08 19:43:33 
Thanks for asking . I gave DD a drink and a little flapjack in the car after ballet and I think that helped a bit on its own! We picked up DS and she didn&apos;t aggravate him on the way home. When we got home DH was home early so that distracted them for a few minutes. When DD started becoming wilder I gave her drawing to do and set up DS&apos;s&apos;train ramp thing&apos;quickly for him to play with (which he lost interest in, in seconds). DD was quite calm for a while with her pens and paper. DS started getting whiny and aggravating DD! So I talked him through putting his own PJs on (which he should be learning by now aged 3) and that kept him occupied for a bit. Then DH did DD&apos;s school reading book and took them to bed. So it went quite well tonight! I had to make some effort though and focus on how to make it better - but maybe I should be less of a lazyarse and make more effort all the time anyway. I just really don&apos;t feel like it sometimes, but I can see that it is worth it rather than feeling wound up for longer than the time it takes to make the effort.

Sounds good AN- Flapjacks great for low-blood sugar levels. DS1 is far more pleasant when I give him something like flapjack to eat straight after school. He has been difficult this evening. He&apos;s really tired after late nights at the week-end, and he&apos;s hating the weekly spelling test at school. The spellings are much harder than Y3. He takes his frustration out on the rest of us, which is trying. I&apos;ve been dealing with this by keeping in mind he&apos;s tired, and hugging him more, and acknowledging out loud that it must be hard for him. I did send him to his room for 5 minutes when he kept thumping away on the piano, so the others couldn&apos;t hear the television. In the past I&apos;d have issued a threat. It&apos;s hard work, but I managed not to lose it.

hey mimi. well done to you too - that all sounds really positive too.
as far as my DD is concerned, i can tell you it&apos;s all pretty unpredictable and some days are good, some less so, and half the time i&apos;m damned if i can work out why.
she - astonishingly - learned to ride her bike at last though, last weekend. massive breakthrough. blood has been shed, tears have flown, tantrums thrown, family dynamics strained to their outer limit over this one!! it&apos;s still not exactly straightforward though - woe betide her little brother (who at 5 has been cycling sans stabilisers for 18 mths now, the cycling equivalent of a smug married to her neurotic pedestrian bridget jones) if he brakes too rapidly in front of her. this happened a few days ago and she threw a massive wobbler (to be fair, he had - unwittingly - caused her to crash into him and fall over), v amusingly he looked panic-stricken and took an executive decision to run straight into a cornfield in order to escape her certain wrath!! it was only two days later we were allowed to laugh about it all in front of her...
 Add message | Report | Message poster Grumpyoldcaaaaaaaa Mon 20-Oct-08 21:40:20 
Ah yes, the riding of the un-stabilised bike! DD1 refused until she was 8, because she tried it ONCE at the age of 4 and fell off and that was that. Unfortunately, DD2 has the same&apos;can&apos;t do instantly so can&apos;t be arsed&apos;attitude to this and many other activities - weren&apos;t there a few fabulous threads about the horror of arts and crafts earlier?

Also, mention of homework earlier - the Year 6 Maths homework DD1 is getting at the moment has brought out all the worst and most childish aspects of my personality - hurling of book across room, roars of&apos;This is stupid, why do they even give you homework?&apos;. And yes, this is me (can you see where DD2 might get some of her behaviour from)

LOL grumpy, great image of the homework scenes. have done all of that internally a million times over i can tell you. have watched DD bouce off the walls on numerous occasions over incomprehensible (to both of us) tasks/instructions/new-fangled maths etc!! also - v relieved to hear you had same complete obstinacy over unstablised bike issue btw. i had totally given up on DD riding a bike before the age of about 12, to be honest, and what&apos;s more that was fine by me after the trauma of all we&apos;ve had to go through until last weekend!!
as for&lt;&lt;&lt;aaaargh&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;arts and crafts...the very words cause me to feel NAUSEOUS with anxiety and suppressed fear.
on the plus side, my DD can actually begin to find her own excesses amusing - always in retrospect - OBV - and has a nice line in self-mimicry going, whereby she acts out a past meltdown and agrees that perhaps, just perhaps that reaction was a tad on the OTT side

I really am a bitch, what the hell is wrong with me? I just can&apos;t do it today. I don&apos;t want to do anything at all, not even speak. It is really hard to force myself. The kids come near me and I just get mad and tell them to leave me alone because I don&apos;t want to talk and I don&apos;t want to keep doing things for them. They haven&apos;t been badly behaved. I haven&apos;t had anything stressful today. I didn&apos;t sleep very well but don&apos;t especially feel tired. I&apos;m feeling negatively about a few things but it doesn&apos;t seem enough to make me like this. I seem to get like this at random so I just don&apos;t know what causes it. I feel crap about myself for it and I know I sound pathetic. Any ideas how to kick myself up the ass?
 Add message | Report | Message poster skydancer1 Wed 22-Oct-08 17:18:18 
Hi AN. I think you already have enough ideas how to kick yourself! It might be worth trying something like meditation or other techniques for being still within yourself and you may find you have a more spacious experience or at any rate know what is going on for you more deeply. This might be uncomfortable at first if your general experience is what you would call negative or painful. I know it&apos;s really hard to find the time to do stuff like this but in my experience worth it. Even ten/fifteen minutes a day.

OR - use the same amount of time in the day (or more if you have it of course!) to do one thing that you really like doing, something that brings you pleasure/joy or a feeling of connection or peace.

I&apos;m having a&apos;feel like a bitch day&apos;today. I slept badly last night, DH&apos;s been away alot and DD&apos;s constant chatter has been really irritating me today. I feel bad because she&apos;s only trying to communicate with me. 
My coping strategy has been to turn the television on. 
I know part of the irritation is feeling that my needs are bottom of the pile, and I feel resentful of the demands the DC make of me.
I&apos;m hoping DH is back in time for me to play netball tonight. Running after a ball, and trying to get it off other people seems to release some of the irritated feelings that fester in me. I&apos;ll probably get pulled up for fouling a lot tonight.

i second skylark on the meditation front, AN - i was DRIVEN to it by my tussles with DD about two or three years ago and went on one of those one-evening-a-week-for-6-weeks courses you see advertised now and again - really worth doing. i already loved yoga so i guess i had an interest anyway in that direction, which helped. i often only manage 10 minutes before falling into bed but it somehow helps to keep you centred and calm, and it also improved my sleep no end. worth a thought anyway. it gets easier with practice (tho i am no expert, that&apos;s for sure)!

I have shouted and said unreasonable things and treated my daughter unfairly. I have always been ashamed of this. I am very often aware of what I&apos;m doing wrong but find it almost impossible to get back on track once I&apos;ve lost my temper.

I am off to bed now but will be making time to read the entire thread before hopefully joining in and finding/offering support with others going through the same.

Katiek-I usually completely lose it after a period of self-congratulation, when I am feeling as though I&apos;ve finally cracked this parenting malarkey. My period of smugness usually ends abruptly with me losing it, and behaving like a toddler. Don&apos;t you find yourself losing it unexpectedly sometimes? I do.

I just want to run a couple of things by others...

My Ds has recently learned screeching/shouting&apos;AH, AH!&apos;noises and high pitched screaming at his nursery for when he doesn&apos;t get what he wants immediately and aside from ignoring the excesses or not reacting obviously I also say (trying to stay calm!) things like&apos;I don&apos;t understand that noise. What do you want/what&apos;s the matter? or&apos;You have to wait - it&apos;s coming in a minute&apos;. Often this works but sometimes it doesn&apos;t and basically I&apos;m a bit horrified that this has quickly become a habitual behaviour for him. So I am now trying to persuade with a bit of shaming. This is worrying for me as I am aware that it is important not to humiliate a child so I feel like I&apos;m walking a fine line. So what do people think of me telling DS that these are&apos;silly baby&apos;noises and only&apos;stupid&apos;babies who cant talk in the nursery make this kind of noise?

The other thing I feel a bit awkward about doing is using threats (I&apos;ve mentioned this before) like&quot;If you don&apos;t stop banging the table I will take the fork away&quot;or&quot;If you keep doing that (e;g trying to open other people&apos;s car doors when we&apos;re out) I&apos;ll put you in your pushchair. I find threats work like magic but I feel horrible using them.
 Add message | Report | Message poster MorocconOil Thu 23-Oct-08 10:50:44 
Hi Skydancer- I am assuming your DS is 3-ish.
With the high pitched noises, I wouldn&apos;t talk about silly and stupid, because he may start using those words with other children. Children are highly sensitive about being stupid and it isn&apos;t a word that builds self-esteem. I would talk about him being a big boy who can talk really well, who has lots of really good words he can use. Focus on the positive rather than the negative.

With the threats this is an area I struggle with too. I issue them too readily to try and stop the DC from misbehaving. However the examples you use are not really threats. When he&apos;s banging on the table making a horrible noise, it is fair to take the fork away to stop the noise. You gave him a warning, he didn&apos;t take any notice so it&apos;s quite right to follow it through.

HTH

It made me laugh about feeling smug about doing a good parenting thing that worked and then it all goes t*ts up! . This happens to me all the time and it is such a relief to hear other people say it. This job really is bloody hard isn&apos;t it! and we haven&apos;t given up! We are getting ideas from each other and trying to improve all the time. I think we are great even if we f*ck it up every other time [smug despite the slapdash shambles that is my homelife]

I&apos;m in a good mood today, even though I feel slightly ill. There is no reason for this change in mood just like there was no good reason for my hopeless mood the other day! My brain is just f*cked. I&apos;ve bought loads of fruit and veg, Omega 3 oil and evening primrose oil today so feel&apos;righteous&apos;even if it doesn&apos;t make any difference and all goes rotten before I&apos;m motivated enough to get everyone to eat it.

I think threats like&quot;if you continue to misuse your fork I will take it away&quot;are perfect! They should be renamed&quot;consequences&quot;with a warning beforehand. The sort of threats that are wrong are eg&quot;I&apos;m going to hit you in a minute&quot;.

I think it is ok to say&quot;Don&apos;t screech like that, that is what babies do because they haven&apos;t learnt to talk yet, you can talk very well and you should say eg&quot;Mummy please can I have a drink&quot;and if I say&quot;Yes but you will have to wait for me to put this washing in the machine first&quot;, you should say&quot;ok Mummy I will wait til then&quot;.

Then you have made your point but haven&apos;t said anyone is stupid, babies or your child. Lately I find that telling my children what TO say rather than saying&quot;Stop shouting/whining/crying/being rude&quot;is working better. They could stop shouting if you are firm enough but if they don&apos;t know how to express themselves properly and what words they could use they will shout again next time. I&apos;m trying to think in terms of teaching them how to behave rather than disciplining them for misbehaving.

See, I can say all this when I&apos;m in a good mood and the kids aren&apos;t even in the house at the moment! Lately when I start feeling like sh*t again and they are here and noisy and overwhelming and I forget to do all the things I know I should do it will all turn to sh*t!

Good point about teaching DC how to express themselves, instead of shouting at them . I will try that next time I feel irritable and DD is whining commands at me. It is sometimes hard in the heat of the moment not to respond crossly, but I will take a few deep breaths, remain calm and explain simply how she needs to express her needs without whining.

Thanks for all your great advice and sharing exp Mimi, Katiek and AN. I&apos;ve got some better ideas now for using positive encouragement and role-modelling (I mentioned this myself to someone else the other day so why didn&apos;t I think of it? ) for the screeching/impatient thing and think you folk are right about not using the&apos;stupid&apos;word. I&apos;m glad the&apos;threats&apos;sound appropriate too.

My Ds is only 25 months but is articulate for his age (mummy bragging alert ). He can speak in full sentences e.g&quot;Mummy have you seen the keys?&quot;&quot;I don&apos;t like the Nursery, it&apos;s dirty in there. I want to go to the park&quot;. BUT, we are in Spain now (moved here ten months ago) and his Spanish is extremely basic -literally a few words, so he is not making himself understood in his non-bilingual nursery and is kind of back to square one. Also I think some of the children his age aren&apos;t yet speaking so well so they do the screeching/screaming thing because they&apos;re frustrated. Yet another factor here is that they often have 15 or more children to one staff member , so there is an awful lot of frustration/competing for attention going on, is my guess. Actually the more I go on about this the more sympathetic I feel towards my LO by the minute! He only goes for three hours a day to the nursery until he is a bit older/used to it or I have to return to full-time work.

One thing I wanted to share that I am finding successful at the moment dealing with little Mr will-of-iron is humour and fun. I can sometimes turn him round full-scale from imminent war-fare to gales of giggles just by being extremely silly and playful myself or getting some music on and dancing with him. I don&apos;t always feel in the mood for it at first but I have to say that it works so well in diverting conflict it often cheers me up as well - and calms us all down ultimately.

Hello all!!!

It was the Halloween Disco tonight, we have spoken of little else all week (especially at 3am when The Supreme Being is awake and chatty/curious/busy/giggly/cross/fwitend) and have been in a lather of excitement.

So what did my boisterous/loud/challenging/pain in the bum DD do?

Clung pathetically to my leg, peeped shyly from beneath her fringe (she has the biggest, most shiny chocolate brown eyes that melt everyone), simpered at everyone, lisped whenever anyone spoke to her (she can even lisp words WITHOUT an&apos;s&apos;when she&apos;s in the mood) and generally behaved like a little mouse. 

Laugh?????? I was agape with amazement - what happened?

Hello again everyone.

Must confess I still haven&apos;t been able to get through the whole thread (soooo tired!) but I think I&apos;ve got the general gist.

I will try to summarise my situation as briefly as possible:

I have a 3 year-old dd who is gorgeous. I wouldn&apos;t say she is&apos;spirited&apos;as some other posters here experience with their children. She is, in the main, a good girl. She is lovely to her brother and with other children and almost always behaves beautifully for other adults. She is fiercely independent and her language is good. I tend to expect far too much from her and assume her emotional maturity should match her maturity in other ways.

DD has been feisty since about 18 months but has become a lot more difficult since DS arrived 6 months ago. She has outrageous tantrums and this blind rage that takes her over. She adores her brother but is competitive. I sometimes feel sad about how our relationship has changed since DS arrived. I feel guilty a lot of the time.

I have found it all so hard recently. I have a temper that was never there before I had children. I can identify what someone said earlier about the&apos;red mist&apos;descending. I shout too much and have said terrible things like&apos;you&apos;re doing my head in&apos;,&apos;let me have some space&apos;. Sometimes I hold a grudge against DD for far too long.

I really think our problems are more mine that DDs and the main issues are:
-Not having enough time to myself
-Not getting enough sleep
-Eating badly and not getting enough exercise
-Not spending enough time playing with DD
-Giving DD too much negative attention and not enough positive.
-Too high expectations of DD

In many ways, DD and I are like two peas in a pod and this is a big part of the problem, I think.

Have been so impressed to see the support you have all given each other here and feel relieved to have found others who clearly understand what&apos;s going on in my life and in my head.

Like many mums, I enjoy giving the impression that I&apos;m coping, even when I&apos;m not. DH and my mum are always saying how well I&apos;m doing, because I&apos;m good at making it look like I&apos;m supermum which couldn&apos;t be further from the truth 

Sorry this is all very jumbled, just getting my thoughts out in a&apos;stream of consciousness&apos;kind of a way.

Hope you have all had a good enough day today.

hello olifin
so nice to read more about you, and your kids sound lovely - as do you. i am sure a large part of the problem is indeed the full-on-ness of the situation (as all of us face in the pre-school years) and the lack of time for yourself. it completely did my head in at your stage. as did the general stress, isolation, insomnia, lack of DH presence (due to his work) etc etc. now things are better, i am FIERCELY protective of my time alone and even though mine are at school i completely refuse to work full-time (or even much part-time as my DH would quickly point out! )bcs i feel as if i am still in recovery from the Early Years!!! so i really sympathise.
i had a couple of red mist moments just today so it still happens. and mine are almost always bcs i am stressed and tired and in highly-strung mode rather than bcs the behaviour is any different from lots of other episodes. today i irrationally took back a promise i&apos;d made to let my DD go to a sleepover party(of which i disapprove bcs am a fogey at heart and think she is too young, basically) in the heat of the moment then had to retract the retraction - argh, messy messy messy and Definitely Not In The Manual (whatever the manual du jour happens to be today, that is!!)
sigh.
anyway welcome, and it&apos;s very interesting to read you. 
sky - v interesting re the spanish nursery situation you face with DS - and you are allowed a little maternal boast there bcs he does sound like he&apos;s a very cute and clever clogs!! also re humour - i use that sort of strategy all the time with my DD and it really, really works. trouble is that it is quite draining on one&apos;s sometimes limited energy supplies i used to find!! luckily i am better slept these days! but yes it is such a good tool.
must go to bed, talking of sleep

Katiek you saved my vegetarian bacon there (I think you are very kind!), as I was feeling bad about being a braggy-britches (it must be late -with this language - I&apos;ve obviously regressed and/or gone quite mad!). Well I have to feel good about something when the rest can feel just too much at times, and you&apos;re right, Ds may be a beast but is also cute, cute, cute. I&apos;m sorry it was also very hard by the sound of it when your DD was younger, but I&apos;ve found it so reassuring reading you and others on how it gets easier as your DCs get older.

Olifin hi - and I think the list of issues you thought were related to your red mist descending were very interesting. It is so easy as a mum to not look after yourself properly and instead invest all your energies into looking after your LO/s. They need a huge investment of love and care, obviously, but it can backfire if we don&apos;t give ourselves enough as we will be trying to give from an empty tank. Simple things like more time for ourselves, enough sleep, good food...good points and I&apos;m convinced so I&apos;m going to bed!

First time on this thread and what a relief to have found it! I am sorry to say that I&apos;ve spent all morning fantasing about my life before 3 year old dd. I feel I am now at the end of my tether with her.

Just back from holiday, a holiday me and DH spent ages saving up for, and what a bloody nightmare it was! DD screamed for 4 hours solidly on the plane, on the outward and return journey, despite all the sticker books, colouring books and pens I&apos;d bought her. Kept screaming she wanted a drink of ribena, finally managed to buy one off the stewardess and dd took one sip and threw it everywhere! Typically, all the other kids her age on the plane were well behaved and didnt spend the whole journey sceaming the plane down. Shes flown before so its not like it was the first time... When we got to the hotel she moaned and whined for one week solidly, took a dislike to the hotel restaurant and refused to go in everyday, had to physically carry her in.

Now we&apos;re home shes back to her usual moaning behaviour, unable to spend any time playing on her own, opens her mouth and screams if she doesnt get her own way etc, refuses to go to bed. I look at my life now and thing what have I done?

Sorry this all sounds negative but feeling really down about it all. I had visions when I was pregnant of dd and I spending lots of lovely hours together and instead its a constant battle! I do love her but just wish she was a bit more laid back and easy to look after, instead of everything being such a struggle. Its put a strain on my relationship with dh too. Sigh.

Thanks for letting me rant!

Thank you for the lovely warm welcome ladies.

TBH, I feel a bit of a fraud posting here as it seems many of you have children who are genuinely difficult to manage whereas my DD is actually quite straightforward and responds well to rewards, warnings, naughty step etc... it is usually my parenting which b*ggers things up somewhat! Oh well, at least it&apos;s usually easy to identify what&apos;s gone wrong and how to rectify it.

I had a gooood night&apos;s sleep last night and am feeling suitably refreshed this morning. So far, so good. Have read DD a story, at her request and am trying to be ultra nice and positive with her. Might even make some cakes with her in a minute

Hello Olifin, hope the cake making goes well! I to am trying to be calm with my dd this morning. Its only just gone 11 and already it feels like hard work! DD has been up since the crack of dawn (I live for the day she gets up past 6) and has been on the go since, lots of tantrums and hysterics, so a normal day really! Will have to try and get out and about later or I will go slowly made looking at the same 4 walls.

I am hoping that next year she&apos;ll be able to go to a kids club on holiday and this will help keep her occupied and entertained. Though at the moment I wouldnt care if I never went on holiday again!

Hello slowlylosingit, hope you managed to get out today- I find it makes such a huge difference to our moods and has the added benefits of making the day go quicker and tiring the LOs out 

I made some chocolate cupcakes with DD- very unusual for me, I assure you, I&apos;m really not very good at doing constructive&apos;activities&apos;with her (probably part of the reason we often end up having altercations ) and I have to say, we&apos;ve had a pretty good day. Not amazing or outstanding, but fine. No big tantrums, no shouting. DD has tried it on a couple of times but I&apos;ve coped ok, having been far less tired than other occasions recently.

DD&apos;s most recent (and highly irritating) thing is to insist on being&apos;first&apos;all the time e.g. if I say I&apos;m off to the loo, she suddenly starts screeching in a high voice that she&apos;s going to go first and loses her temper if she doesn&apos;t get to&apos;win&apos;. Unfortunately, I think DH and I inadvertently caused this by trying to get her dressed quickly (&apos;bet you can&apos;t get dressed before I get your brother dressed!) A great strategy but it&apos;s backfired on us so I&apos;m having to make a real effort to ignore all the&apos;I&apos;m gonna be first&apos;rantings.

Ah well, it could be worse (and has, many times!) but I hope your day has been ok (and anyone else reading).

Hi Olifin

3 is when they start to mind losing, I remember DS being the same. We also had used races to motivate him to get dressed quickly. But DD who is 3 also minds losing and not being first now and we never used races with her. Its probably just natural development rather than your fault IYSWIM.

DS is 5 now and ok and much better at losing unless tired. We stopped doing the races, let him go first whenever possible and also modelled good losing behaviour when playing games. Of course I don&apos;t give a s * about who wins at Uno but I always say things along the lines of&apos;oh you had lucky cards, I wish I&apos;d had those cards but never mind, lets play again and see if I get lucky&apos;.

HTH

How are you all doing? I think I&apos;ve got myself addicted to this thread as I&apos;ve found it so helpful and appreciated sharing with people in such similar situations. I had one of those days when I kept losing my cool -ouch. I was tired (slept really badly) and got so stressed and claustrophobic with DS following me around all the time and demanding I do everything with him or he do everything I was doing. I wasn&apos;t so constructive about giving him activities to keep him happy either. Fortunately it was the weekend and my DP stepped into the breach quite a lot or I don&apos;t know how I would have coped.

Been shouting at DH this pm. I was feeling a bit ill and because I know I&apos;ve got both children all next week for half term I didn&apos;t want to be responsible for all discipline at the weekend when DH is here to help. He does try to help, it is just that I don&apos;t feel his&apos;discipline&apos;works and then I end up having to step in and sort it out. But I know he has less practice as he doesn&apos;t have them all week and I can see he is just copying his own parents&apos;way of doing things and he reasons that him and his brothers turned out ok. They did, but his mum admits all she did was shout all day and it had little effect.

He thinks all you have to do is shout. Shouting at DD just makes her get angry and shout back and not listen to what you are actually saying. Shouting at DS just makes him cry and makes him scared so he can&apos;t even concentrate on doing the right thing.
I think DH does scare them when he shouts because he is a big man with a loud booming voice. Then he complains that when he says to them&quot;come for cuddles with Daddy&quot;, they don&apos;t want to.

So I explained to him why shouting doesn&apos;t work and said that threatening to hit them is also wrong (he says&quot;I&apos;ll smack your bottom in a minute&quot;), and said that the best thing is to warn them that if they do x then there will be y consequence (which doesn&apos;t involve shouting intimidatingly or smacking). I said that surely he has the intelligence to think of a more inventive consequence than that eg taking away the toy they are misusing or putting them in time out. I said that he doesn&apos;t need to shout at all really, just calmly say the consequence then&apos;follow through&apos;if necessary.

The thing is, as I was saying it I realised I should be telling it to MYSELF! I know that what I told him works but so often I don&apos;t do it, I resort to just shouting myself! Now that I have criticised him I will have to make a special effort to do it properly for the rest of the weekend otherwise I am a hypocrite!

Then later on, they were messing about while eating their tea and DH went and sat with them staring at them while they ate and getting on their case about every little thing. I told him not to pressure them by staring at them and going on at them or they wouldn&apos;t be able to relax enough to eat (they are so sensitive they can&apos;t take it). DS is always saying to him&quot;stop looking at me!&quot;. I told him to just talk gibberish to them and it would distract them from messing about and they would eat their tea without realising they were eating it. As the words were coming out of my mouth I thought to myself&quot;oh my god, what a brilliant idea!&quot;It&apos;s like I can say what should be done but can&apos;t think to actually do it myself! So I started to try out my own methods which I had told DH but not actually done myself and it was working!

Then I started thinking about the way I act when I am looking after other peoples&apos;kids as well as my own. I make extra special effort to do things the way I know I should and to find non-shouting, non-aggressive ways to&apos;keep control&apos;of them all because I don&apos;t feel comfortable shouting at other people&apos;s children. So when they are playing and I sense a&apos;fight&apos;brewing, I go over and get down and play with them for a few moments and talk gibberish and it distracts them from the fight they were going to have, then when they are calmer I go away again and let them carry on playing on their own.

I realised that the reason our kids go wild at the weekends is because we are ignoring them too much, doing our own thing, normally staring at the TV or our laptops or newspapers because we are knackered after our week. They are bored and want attention. Some of their misbehaviour is to get attention and some of it is because they don&apos;t always know how to play unless you give them a few ideas. DH is knackered after a week at work and just wants to stare at the TV or whatever and I feel like I&apos;ve had the kids all week so I want to make less effort at the weekend because DH is there as well and should be helping me.

I hadn&apos;t worked it out really until today why they went extra wild at the weekends, worse than in the week. Ignoring them too much makes them wild. Talking to them in short bursts and playing with them with whatever they are doing but adding a few ideas and then leaving them to it for a bit then coming back to them when they seem like they are going&apos;loopy&apos;again seems to make them calmer and better at playing independently. Again, when I actually make myself DO it, it works.

Are other people like this? Somewhere in your mind you know what to do and how to do it, you just DON&apos;T do it because you feel tired, ill, moody, depressed or whatever. So maybe our problems aren&apos;t so much knowing how to be parents but more to do with somehow looking after ourselves enough that we feel&apos;well&apos;enough to do it properly.

It seems illogical that when we feel ill, we do crap parenting and then that makes our kids really misbehave which makes us feel even worse but this is what I do!

We tend to think that looking after our own needs is selfish but I&apos;m thinking that if we don&apos;t do this we haven&apos;t got the mental and physical resources to parent properly so actually looking after yourself is NOT selfish!

Hi All 
AN- could have written your post. I really know what you mean about other people&apos;s DC. I am so nice to other DC. The DSs have started to pick up on it, and say I am not
fair. The thing is other DC do not press the buttons our own DC do. Also they are not there all the time, and it is not your responsibility to set and maintain their boundaries. For me this is one of the most demanding aspects of parenting. I feel my DC are always testing the boundaries. However when I have honest discussions with other prents this is the norm.
I think you are doing a bloody good job of parenting AN and others on this thread. The fact we are finding it hard is because we are trying very hard to get it right. This is hard for anyone, but for those of us who were not given appropriate parenting models it is doubly difficult. Also our parents were not hands on parents, so give little support with their grandchildren. We get no support so it is hardly surprising we get burnt out and lose it!
Today I decided to look after my needs, and left DH to it with the DC. I went for a long, fast walk in the countryside. I feel so much better for doing something for me. I feel more positive about the DC. i&apos;ve got half-term next week too, but am now looking forward to a week out of the normal routines.

OthersideoftheChannel- thanks for the ideas about curtailing the competitiveness and the incessant need to win! We have taken to ignoring our DD when she starts on about it, or we just try and play it down and that&apos;s been working well.

AN- I can identify with so much of what you posted yesterday. I, too, try to take a step back at weekends so that I (and the kids!) can have a break from me having to say&apos;no&apos;all the time and being the one issuing the warnings etc... I try to let DH do it but, like you, I tend to step in if I can see things going wrong or feel that he&apos;s not handling something in the&apos;right&apos;way. What works better is if I can hold my tongue at the time (maybe going somewhere out of earshot so I&apos;m not tempted to interfere) and then bring it up later with DH when the kids are in bed. e.g.&apos;When DD does xyz, I try to respond by....and that&apos;s been working quite well, I wonder if you might get better results if you were to try that&apos;. DH doesn&apos;t mind me making suggestions like this and prefers it to being&apos;undermined&apos;in front of the children. It also enables us to discuss our strategies in private and come to compromises so that we can put up a united front for the children 

I also totally agree with what you say about looking after ourselves and our own needs. Like you, I feel like I know what I should/shouldn&apos;t be doing in terms of discipline but it can all go out of the window if I&apos;m tired or stressed and less able to think rationally.

I&apos;ve had a pretty good day considering I&apos;ve got the mother of all hangovers In a funny way, it&apos;s made things a bit easier with the kids because I&apos;ve been feeling sooooo rough that I really can&apos;t be bothered to get into any altercations. I&apos;ve actually been a lot softer on DD today and, luckily, she&apos;s been quite well-behaved. Apart from getting overtired and repeatedly telling me I was horrible and she wanted another mummy. For once, I hadn&apos;t done anything to deserve this ill-treatment so I completely ignored what she was saying and went off to another room with DS, leaving her with DH. After a while she came in and apologised, which was lovely. I just couldn&apos;t be arsed with doing battle today.

Quick vent - I&apos;m making an effort to do nice things with DD today while she is off school and DS is at nursery but however much I do for her or whatever I get for her she always asks for more and can never be happy with what she has got now. She is always worrying about what she is going to do/get after this and then what after that. Eg I got her a drink which she hadn&apos;t asked for and instead of saying thank you she whined&quot;I&apos;m hungry&quot;. I got her drawing things out and she whined&quot;I need cellotape as well&quot;. I&apos;ve just ranted&quot;however much I do for you it is never enough is it, you always want more and it makes me not want to bother doing anything for you&quot;Yesterday eve we took the kids for a pizza and we were enjoying eating it but she was whining&quot;Will I get a balloon after, will you ask the man, will you ask him now&quot;. I want her to have a nice day today and I want to be nice to her but I just dread the next time she asks for more or asks what we are doing next when we haven&apos;t even finished the first thing. I&apos;m dreading it because I don&apos;t want to be angry with her but how do I stop her ungrateful and spoilt attitude from irritating me?

Hi AN, sorry to hear your good intentions have left you frustrated.

Some days the demands are relentless, but these requests would be quite reasonable if the tone of voice was polite.

If you offer her a drink when she&apos;s thinking about something else, that makes her focus on her body and she realises she&apos;s hungry...

You get out the colouring things and she realises whatever she feels like creating requires tape....

Pizza restaurant - presumably she has been given a balloon at a restaurant before or the balloons are visible...

The problem is the way she is asking. If it sounds rude and whiny, you have to tell her that you&apos;ll do it when she&apos;s asked nicely.

Also, is there anything you can do to make her more self sufficient? Eg DS has his own roll of tape. When it runs out he gets a new one. Ours is kept in a separate place so that I know I will always find tape when I need it.

Perhaps if you think about all her requests in the day, you could find some ways to cut down on her pestering you!

I have just had a hideous week. Since about last Tuesday, dd (2.4) has been testing all the boundaries. Her favourite word is&apos;no&apos;which she says all the time and very aggressively. She seems to say it in any situation - I could tell her I&apos;m going to the loo and she just shouts&apos;No!&apos;.

I do not know what to do with her. I am doing my best to stay calm with her and when she says no I just ignore her os cheerfully say,&apos;Ok&apos;. But it is relentless and my patience is wearing very thin.

Everything is a struggle and I feel like we have to discuss everything. Getting on a pair of shoes to go out can take 10 minutes.

She is being nasty to her little brother which has never really happened before.

I am trying to pick my battles and as a result she&apos;s eaten next to nothing over the last few days.

I keep waking up hoping she&apos;ll be in a better mood.

Sorry to ramble, just wanted to vent!

I rant all the time.

I have become the mother I used to tut about in shops (although I draw the line at hitting or swearing).

I have become my mother on a bad day!

Count to 10 - slowly. Then repeat as necessary. I try to remember what my sister (over 30 years experience working with small children) told me&apos;when a child empties out the bin all over the kitchen floor, they are not being naughty, just exploring and having fun&apos;. Can&apos;t say it always works but it does help sometimes.

Try to smile and say nothing sometimes. The absolute joi de vivre (not sure about the spelling there) that small children have goes too quickly! In no time at all they will be stroppy teenagers and you&apos;ll miss the small child that adored you, hung from your legs when you were trying to rush to the loo and shouted loud, inappropriate things in public!

Fizzbuzz, I&apos;ll second the wanting to run away feeling. Sometimes when I approach dd&apos;s nursery to pick her up I can feel the dread coming over me, and have the urge to just keep on walking home. I imagine sitting down, having a nice cup of tea and reading the paper. Most of all I dream about how lovely and peaceful it would be. Instead I have to contend with dd screaming the nursery down, refusing to put her coat and shoes on, refusing to get in the pushchair, kicking me while I try to strap her in the pushchair following by screaming all the way home, with strangers looking at me like I&apos;m killing her. I have to admit that sometimes I give her chocolate to keep her quiet which is SO not the right thing to do but I do on occasions just give up!

I too can be really good with other peoples children but when it comes to dd no matter how many deep breaths I take I end up raising my voice as she pushes me to the edge. I&apos;ve watched all the parening programmes, read all the book, read on the excellent advice on MN about how to cope with tantrums etc but when it comes down to it I do sometimes just lose it. I pride myself on the fact I&apos;ve never smacked dd but then when I think about it, shouting at her and saying things like&quot;why dont you give me a break, just for 5 mins&quot;and&quot;can you just stop whining all the time&quot;is hardly fantastic parenting...

God its so bloody hard!

I could just get in the car now and drive as far away as I could. The DC are driving me utterly insane today. As I type DS1 is chasing DD around and threatening to let go of her balloon outside. She is schreeching and shrieking and he is laughing manically. I just want to scream.&apos;Shut the F * up.&apos;

I took them out for a few hours so we weren&apos;t in all day. We go away for a few days first thing in the morning and I need to pack, but they keep distracting me from the task. I&apos;m stressed about getting ready, and DH won&apos;t be home til after bed-time so I know I have to get everything ready and feed, entertain and get 3 excited DC to bed. It feels just too much. I just want to sit down with a cup of tea and be left on my own. I really hope I don&apos;t lose it but I keep feeling the red mist descend.

And, I&apos;m so worn out with her, I&apos;ve let her nap this afternoon, which means she&apos;ll be up until 9 

After changing her nappy, and cleaning her, she decides without my knowledge to continue. Grabs a wipe, wipes her btm, then shovs her hands straight in her mouth. I remove wipe, turn away and she does the same again twice . I throw bag of wipes out of room in anger and shout NO! She cries... 

And as for breakfast&lt;shudder&gt;that was truly like something out of a farce.

Want toast...I go and make it

I have just spent the past half hour on the phone talking to tax credits about a mistake they&apos;ve made (they claim I owe them thousands, yikes) with dd refusing to keep quiet. She understands that when I&apos;m on the phone she has to play quietly but what does she do, keeps screaming, keeps trying to get my attention, pulling on my clothes, climbing all over me, despite me frantically asking her in a calm voice to be very quiet as mummys talking. I to wanted to scream&quot;shut the fu*k up&quot;. If it was anyone else I would. I tried walking out into another room, even putting cbeebies on, but she just followed me and became hysterical. I find it amazing that she cant spend 30 mins on her own, the house is full of toys, books, stickers but nothing keeps her occupied for more than a couple of minutes. She has the attention span of a flea... I know that when I was her age my mum was able to leave me to play while she got on with looking after my brothers, did some housework etc I just wish sometimes I had a more laid back child rather than a high maintenance one..

Hi All
Gosh - so much has been said and discussed since I last looked in. Lots more new names which I hope will be taking the same comfort in knowing you aren&apos;t alone with your demanding dc&apos;s as I have.

Just thought I&apos;d update you on where I am with my dd. For the last week there has been a definate improvement in her demeanor and behaviour - we have had the odd wobble, but on the whole much improved .

I have been trying so hard to refrain from shouting and losing my temper - I thought so long and hard about how I was acting and all the posts and advice on this thread have helped immensely in my efforts to change. I came to the conclusion that I am the adult, dd is just a little child and as exasperating as her behaviour is, I cannot for her sake, and for mine let her grind me down. Not saying I&apos;ve been a saint, but things have greatly improved...she is all round an easier child at the moment. I think it is partly to do with coming out of a bad patch in terms of her not sleeping well and being under the weather with a perisitant cough....she is now sleeping much better and the cough seems to be abating. I can definately see that tiredness and illness makes for a grumpy, difficult child, no doubt.

I have just been ignoring tantrums, using the naughty mat, using reasonable and achieveable threats (eg no chocolate from her chocolate&apos;treasure chest&apos;), using incentives (eg you&apos;ve been so good, you can have a comic). Also, I have been trying not to give into her demanding ways - telling her to do things for herself, no you have to wait til I&apos;ve had my cup of tea etc...she dosn&apos;t like it, but it&apos;s teaching her she&apos;s not at my beck and call. Have also been trying not to say no too much - letting her have some things her own way and picking my battles more carefully so as she can see that she has a little bit of control over what she&apos;s doing and I&apos;m not dictating all the time. Obove all, I;m trying to do all these things in a measured, controlled way with no shouting and stropping - can&apos;t pretend it&apos;s not been completely shouty free, but it&apos;s much improved and I feel better for it. 

I have done a lot of evaluating as I said - my dd is a sensitive little girl and I don&apos;t want to be making her upset with my shouty ways and am trying so hard to correct it....don&apos;t mean to and hope I don&apos;t sound smug...I still have a lot to learn, but just wanted you to know I feel I&apos;ve moved on a bit since my original post. x.

Balanomorey- really pleased things going so well with your dd. I like the idea of a treasure chest. I can see that appealing to my dd.

Fizzbuzz- glad its not just me that has a tough time from child tax credits. Ending up losing my temper with them. Keep receiving letters from them saying I owe them huge amounts of money. Another one arrived today, this time for£544 to be paid in 10 days. I wouldnt mind but apparently we earn to much and havent qualified for any money since 2006. God knows why they seem to think we owe them. . I have a married friend who has told them her and her dh have split up but are still going to live together, ever since CTC keep paying random amounds of money into her account, shes had so much off them shes been on her third holiday this year. Bit envious to be honest.

Fizzbuzz - can we just put our dds in a room and shut the door and go and have a --glass of wine-- cup of tea??

Your dd sounds exactly like mine. Mine was ill on Friday and I thought that explained her bad behaviour of late. I settled her in front of the telly and 2 minutes later she was up again. Ill enough to be really grumpy but not ill enough to just sleep.

By Saturday she was feeling better but still behaving appallingly.

I feel I deserve a medal - I have made it through 2 days (well, one and a half!) without losing it and I think we might be getting somewhere. Friends came to play and toys were SHARED! And then lunch was eaten (the first proper meal in about a week) with only a small amount of fuss.

However, every 5 minutes there is a meltdown about something (particularly enjoyed the one where she wanted to brush her teeth with my brush and I wouldn&apos;t let her - how unreasonable of me ). It is taking every ounce of effort to stay calm.

Has anyone else noticed that most of the&apos;spirited&apos;children on this thread are girls?

Well done Balanoymorey - I am striving to follow your example!

Yes it does seem to be mainly girls......

I&apos;ve had the toothbrush buisness as well. The worst thing is when I am trying to get ready for work, and she wants to put my shoes on . Only the ones I am wearing you understand, and if I try to second guess her and swap thm for another pair, she immediately then wants those. All in the chaos of the morning..

I would agree with putting them in a room (it would be an interesting expriemnet to see who would tantrum most).

Dd has been bearable to day, as we have been shopping for new shoes which she loves. Although she did have a paddy in the shop as she only wanted the pink ones Ds never cared what shoes he wore, in fact used to hide under the chair for most of a shoe shopping experience 

I have refused to pander today, and stood my ground...

Balanamory seems to have a much more hopefu outlook, I have read her last post several times, and have decided to take a lot of what she says on board. Trouble is when the red mist descends I just forget to count to 20

Hi everyone, i am new to mumsnet. this thread has really helped me deal with my DD&apos;s (3.5)behaviour. we were going through a really tricky patch, but after reading some of your posts I realised that i really needed to change my attitude and I have tried to chill out and use different ways of dealing with her. Her behaviour has improved a lot although it&apos;s not completely plain sailing. i don&apos;t suppose it ever will be really. i have really enjoyed reading this thread as it seems that you are all lovely&apos;normal&apos;mums.

Something else girls, that really gives me a kick up the backside when i need it. I imagine a conversation that might take place between me&amp;my dd maybe 20 years in the future. She says something like&quot;Mum, one of my first recollections of when I was little was of you shouting at me....why did you shout a lot?&quot;. I imagine myself squirming and coming up with some feeble answer like&quot;I&apos;m sorry, I found your behaviour very taxing and it just made me lose my temper a lot of the time&quot;. Then she says&quot;But Mum, I was just a little girl. I wasn&apos;t old enough to control my emotions or know when i was being naughty and testing the boundaries too far. You should have had more control as you were the grown up. Maybe you expected too much of me. When I&apos;m a mum, I am so going to try not to be like you were....&quot;How awful would that be? I don&apos;t want to be that lady in 20 yrs time.

This thread has been such a good wake up call. I&apos;m also trying to not be so hard on myself either - i am aware that I shout (hopefully less now than I did) but I also think of all the good things I do and the amount of love I show my dd - i can take comfort in that...but the balance has to be right. The discipline has to be measured and dished out when appropriate...but the love, affection and patience has to far outweigh it. Hopefully this will make harmony and peace reign. x.

balanomorey, you&apos;re sounding so positive and thoughtful, and I&apos;m inspired and buoyed up by your recent posts- lots of good ideas for me to think about.

We&apos;ve been having a good week so far. Was able to treat DD to a&apos;prize&apos;today for having completed a sticker chart (she has managed 7 nights without her dummy!) She chose a new toy and a HUGE cupcake from a very nice bakery. It was lovely to be able to treat her and to say:&apos;you deserve this&apos;.

I&apos;m making the most of it all as there&apos;ll probably be further challenges just around the corner 

higgledypiggledy- not sure what to suggest but might just be a case of persevering. Hard work for you though, in the meantime 

sueresus, hello Sounds like things are going well at the moment, well done on trying to be chilled out, it&apos;s amazing the difference it makes.
 Add message | Report | Message poster ActingNormal Tue 28-Oct-08 22:26:06 
Balano, I like that thing about the future conversation. I often get annoyed because I feel that the DCs are ungrateful for what I do for them and always want more. It might seem as though our DCs are ungrateful for what we do for them now but if we keep at it and find all the strength and calmness we can, I think the love we show them and the positive things we try to teach them will sink in if we stay consistent with it, even though it often seems like they aren&apos;t listening or taking it in at the time, and in the future, when they grow into young adults who know how to be happy and how to cope in the real world and how to give and receive love and friendship, they WILL be grateful. They are too young at the moment to really understand about being grateful.

I was dreading half term and kind of getting angry in advance, expecting DD to act really spoilt (see my last post) but it is going ok so far! When I&apos;m doing things with them both I am enjoying being with them more than I have for ages. It&apos;s because I&apos;m feeling better about a whole lot of things and things are making more sense to me. I&apos;m not so locked into my own head, so preoccupied with my thoughts that I&apos;m not&apos;all here&apos;. I&apos;m not just thinking of the children as more hard work and more irritation and more reminders of what was wrong with my own childhood so much. I&apos;m really starting to look at the children and actually see them and what makes them, them and feeling amazed by them and respectful of them and proud of them for their unique qualities. I&apos;m really connecting with them more and realising how disconnected I&apos;ve felt for a while previously and how depressed/ill I must have been.

I am so glad I did what I thought was a self-indulgent thing and got a therapist because in the end it isn&apos;t self-indulgent because I am starting to see the children benefitting from a mother who is less wrapped up in scrambled racing thoughts and extreme emotions that stopped me functioning properly, who wanted to escape from everything and now I am more&apos;here in the present&apos;for them and more contented with my life as their mother and their father&apos;s wife.

Now I&apos;ve said all this it will probably all go wrong tomorrow, but even if it does, I&apos;m having more good days/good moments than bad now.

A thought that really helps me to feel good about being a mother, even on days when the children misbehave or cry/rage a lot and it is all such hard work is:

We are doing a very important job which we should be proud of having, of teaching our children how to be happy and ways to cope in the real world and treat themselves and other people with respect. This will make the world a better place. Having this long term goal rather than just thinking&apos;another day of hard work to get through&apos;makes it feel worthwhile. Also if that day has been full of bad behaviour but you know you have said/done things which allow them to learn from their mistakes about how they should behave then that day has been an important learning experience for them. Even if they don&apos;t seem to&apos;get it&apos;and don&apos;t immediately change their behaviour, if you keep telling them how they should behave (more than how they shouldn&apos;t) and talking to them about your positive values I believe it will sink in over time.

DH said something useful to me the other day about when we do things we feel aren&apos;t perfect parenting or when he shouts a lot (because he thinks shouting is ok, I&apos;m not so sure). I worry a lot over these things and worry that I could become as bad at parenting as my parents, but he said there is an important difference - we don&apos;t ONLY do these&apos;bad&apos;things, we show the children lots of love and affection and give them lots of praise AS WELL (things my parents didn&apos;t do). This probably seems obvious but it wasn&apos;t to me. For anyone with crap parents who worries about being like them, this thought might help.

Just a quick question: why do tired children feel the need to run around as fast as possible, while making as much noise as possible?

Surely lying down and taking a breather would be the more logical option?

Ah well, I guess bathtime beckons.

Don&apos;t know Olifin, but it is true, they really do, and they don&apos;t know that they are tired, and if you tell them they are tired they get cross! A bath does calm them down a bit though. I just gave mine a bath and now they are wrapped in a blanket together watching TV. Normally they never sit still and watch TV longer than 5 mins! I&apos;ve exhausted them today though with halloween activities and football.

Just realised that at 5pm ish the kids go mad but so do I become really intolerant and I think it is because my blood sugar is low, so stuffed my face with mini milky ways and mars bars and a banana and felt a bit better today 
 Add message | Report | Message poster ActingNormal Thu 30-Oct-08 12:05:28 
Been shouting and ranting and unable to focus on the children properly again today. I&apos;ve got a bit of a headache and sore throat, DH is away and I miss him, I sent him a text last night and he didn&apos;t reply - this is such a small thing but it has got me in a mood. It seems like I can just about cope with the children and do things the right way when I am well but when I&apos;m even slightly ill it seems to go immediately wrong!

DD keeps nagging me about the next thing and the next thing and rushing me and I can&apos;t concentrate. At times when I&apos;m trying to get things done quickly I find it hard to say the right thing rather than just telling her to be quiet eg in Tesco. I suppose I should say&quot;Sorry DD I can&apos;t really talk right now because I&apos;m trying to concentrate, I&apos;ll talk later&quot;.

I have started saying&quot;enjoy what you have got/what you are doing now and don&apos;t keep worrying about the next thing&quot;. I&apos;m hoping if I keep saying it she will get less&apos;jumpy&apos;, anxious,&apos;hyper&apos;. It does seem like a kind of anxiety that she really wants the next thing and is worried she won&apos;t get it and is looking for reassurance that she will. Even if I put her in the car but don&apos;t do the seat belt immediately she gets really anxious because she thinks I might not do it. Does this just show anxiety that her needs might not be met? Does this show I have been neglectful somehow previously? Or maybe it is genetic because I often recognise my own anxious ways in her. Or do I act so anxious myself that she has learnt it from me.

I&apos;m worried DD is already one of those&apos;modern&apos;people who wants instant gratification all the time and bigger and bigger&apos;thrills&apos;and gets bored of things quickly and wants more and more and will never have contentment. I think most kids do get most of what they want materially and don&apos;t have to wait long for things and have more activities provided for them by us than in the old days. It seems better than being bored all the time and not having much but is it all going too far the other way? Is it having a harmful effect on our kids because they aren&apos;t learning to be content/happy/grateful with what they have already got?

I suppose I should talk to the children about how good things are in the present and get them to notice and talk about all the good details and even say a quick prayer eg Thank you God for this lovely cake . We aren&apos;t even religeous but I think being able to have a&apos;ritual&apos;(prayer) where you say thank you to someone (God) for what you have got is the easiest way to teach children how to be grateful. I don&apos;t think they can understand&quot;I feel grateful, and thank you - to who?, thin air?&quot;.

Feel a bit better after typing (trying to talk some positivity into myself). Will now take DD to&apos;our&apos;cafe that we go to when DS is at nursery and she is not at school. It is something I started doing to try to improve our relationship.

hi AN, hi everyone! balano - SO glad things sound so much more positive. well done you. gosh - SO much to catch up on, on this ever-lengthening and fab thread!! AN, i am so with you on the worrying instant gratification thing. it seems to me a real concern in this generation of children. my DD is variably interested in god and metaphysics but gives me short shrift if i try to push the gratitude-sent-heavenwards thing (my DH is a rabid atheist so that is part of the reason!!) but i totally see where you&apos;re coming from on that one. i find modern society quite depressing on so many counts. i hate them watching ads on telly (tho of course they do at times) and so on. could write so much more but time limited (good old half-term eh?)
and, my DD doesn&apos;t so much want the next thing all the time as - variation on the same anxious theme, i suspect - WORRY about the next thing constantly. for instance today we attempted a fun family walk up on a nearby snow-covered ridge. ha!! we were barely out of the car and she was already virtually in tears over various neuroses - 1/ the snow might make her mittens wet 2/ her toes might freeze 3/ DS might throw a snowball down her neck (fair point-she was right on that count!! ). it is so exhausting constantly chivvying her along - i have to be so f * ing JOLLY all the time!!! which i manage, mostly, bcs of the breaks afforded to me by the fact that she is school age.that&apos;s made such a difference to me. but those of you with this sort of thing at the pre-school stage - ARRGH!!! it&apos;s so WEARING!

I think that this thread is one of the best on mumsnet. It is genuinely helpful and supportive and deals with some really difficult issues of being a parent; issues that I was totally unaware of before becoming one.

I only have one ds and am due the next baby in March. I am suffering with really bad insomnia and it has bought out the worst in me and I&apos;ve treated ds badly on a few occasions now&amp;feel horrible guilt and shame. But haven&apos;t been able to stop myself getting cross again two days later or whenever. I&apos;ve read here about&quot;red mist&quot;and I know how that feels. I&apos;ve also read about how it is looking to ourselves, to our own moods&amp;recognising why our dc respond with&quot;bad&quot;behaviour. I know that if I&apos;m exhausted I need someone to help me out&amp;look after me a bit, but there isn&apos;t always help on hand is there? And it comes down to looking after yourself (as you&apos;ve all said) in order to have the emotional and physical resources to look after dc.

Worst of all (but I read here that others have experienced this) I am EXACTLY like my mother when I&apos;m tired and irritable; with no patience. I found my mother&apos;s parenting severely lacking and even neglectful/abusive.
If I can&apos;t break the mould my son is going to suffer. I adore him&amp;he is a lovely boy whose behaviour is not always even challenging beyond what is normal for a toddler. But sometimes I can&apos;t even deal with the conversations and activities that can seem repetitive and inanely boring. (Actually I&apos;ve just seen what katiek wrote about being f**king JOLLY and that hits the nail on the head!)

Balanomorey - your imaginary conversation is a very powerful thing! I used to do this to myself about giving up smoking- imagining myself dying in the hospital, tubes everywhere etc...with the knowledge that 20 years ago I could have made a difference. I&apos;ll try this with my parenting now. Thanks for that.

I am in bed after just not coping today&amp;just being mean to my poor ds. DP had to come home from work early as i told him ds needed someone better than me to look after him. This means no pay for us so it&apos;s not done lightly!

It&apos;s helpful to write on here!
Thanks!

It&apos;s such a relief to find you aren&apos;t on your own. This thread is fantastic.

Tried to take dd to MIL&apos;s for a bit of relief yesterday. She was sick 4 times in the car on the way there (20mins). She has been ill for ages, and whilst I love her to bits, and hate to see her ill, it is so WEARING. Screaming ALL the way home in traffic (not that I blame her, poor vomit ridden child)

Got home, recoverd, and complete nightmare again all day. I&apos;m struggling with anxiety at the moment (Quelle suprise!) and waiting for Ad&apos;s to kick in, so everything is doubly hard.

She has gone to MIL&apos;s today, I have had an antire day to myself...done wonders for my mood. Is there any evolutionary reason why they are such hard work at this age? It must be something to do with survival (theirs not ours of course)

Hope everyone has had a reasonable day, or even good, fingers crossed

DD is back at school today very proud of her war wounds and loving the attention 

i am having trouble with (hitherto rarely-mentioned ) 5 yr-old DS at the moment - clingy, whiny, demanding, hormonal. obsessed with tv - driving me mad. the&apos;raising boys&apos;thread (check it out - v funny as steve biddulph himself pipes up after a few messages!)suggests a testosterone surge at 5 may be the reason - it really is like some chemical switch has flicked&lt;&lt;sigh&gt;&gt;. i know i have always pandered to him a bit too much (my blue-eyed sweet boy! mmh well used to be at least!!)so maybe this is pay-back time. oh well - time to start fine-tuning the old discipline skills YET AGAIN!!

Started off feeling quite positive this morning, had lots of things planned to do with dd. However, after 4 hours of dd whining and moaning feel completely deflated. I cannot bear how she follows me round the house while I try and do things, all the time whining. DD is now 3 and she has been moaning solidly for 2 and a half years. I just want it to stop, if only for half an hour! Its so frustrating, she has 2 parents who love her, a house full of toys, games, books etc grandparents who spend time with her and absolutely adore her and lots of little nursery friends and yet shes never bloody happy!

Hi All
KatieK - so sorry to hear about what happened to dd - you must have been beside yourself - I&apos;d have been in bits. So glad she&apos;s on the mend...poor you!

I&apos;m doing really good, thank you! Dd has been a complete angel for the past few weeks - the change in her behaviour has been remarkable! I have really been able to reason with her and explain why she can&apos;t do certain things and she seems to be more or less accepting what I say without any tantrums!!! eg she had started to get really upset everytime I said sshh to her - now she asks me to say sshh to her so she can demonstrate to me that she can&apos;take it&apos;, so to speak by standing there smiling and saying&quot;see, mummy, I&apos;m not crying even though you just said sshh!&quot;and when I have to say it for genuine reasons, she dosn&apos;t get herself into the tizzy she used to!!

On the whole, I feel I have a different child. I am much more chilled and so much more measured in how I deal with her.

I&apos;m really trying to be a calmer person for both of us - but I have a tendancy to yell&quot;no&quot;like some shrieking banshee if I can see something unfolding that isn&apos;t what I want to happen and I think it&apos;s rubbing off on her as she is starting to yell in this panicky way too. eg whenever we come in the front door, the dog makes a beeline for the great outdoors and freedom as she&apos;s been stuck in on her own while we&apos;ve been out, as dogs do! So instead of calmly calling her back I&apos;m stood there yelling at her to get back inside quickly - the other day she ran off after a cat into the next doors garden and dd went hysterical - as you can imagine I was screaming blue murder at the dog to get back in the house and leave the cat alone. Now, everytime as we are comeing in through the door she grabs the dogs ears, tail whatever she can get hold of to try to stop her getting out of the door as she&apos;s terrified she is going to run off again - it&apos;s not calm and measured, sheer blind panic....and it&apos;s my fault as she&apos;s copying my behaviours. So, still need to calm down a little bit more yet and still some rough corners to sand down - but I feel I&apos;m getting there and I&apos;m a much happier mummy than I was a month back - my fuse has lengthened considerably! Thanks. x.

Slowly - God, it&apos;s hard isn&apos;t it, the continual whinging is like chinese water torture! I do sympathise.&lt;&lt;hug&gt;&gt;. What does dd like doing the best - surely there must be something that is guarateed to put a smile on her face? Whatever it is, do it with her this afternoon just to halt the whinging for a bit. With dd, getting the paints out or something simple like making a jelly puts a smile on her face - anything that will lift her mood and just give you a break from it for a bit. Or can you drop her round to grannys for the afternoon? Sounds like you need a break. Hope the rest of the day improves for you. x.

Slowly, my DD is like this too and I know what you mean. If I feel in perfect health and not tired and have no other worries I can cope with her but if I don&apos;t feel completely 100% I find it painful.

Today I feel really moody and angry and aggressive and feel I am taking it out on my DH and DCs even though they are behaving the same way they always do. I kind of know why I&apos;m like this (something this week triggered past rage) but it seems really stupid.

I think I need some time on my own to unscramble my thoughts. I become scrambled so easily though that I need lots of time on my own, more time than I can have with children. I feel like I cope less well than other people.

balano - so great to hear that all is going so beautifully at the moment - f a b news. well done all of you 

DD doing fine thanks. just strutted her stuff at the school disco earlier this evening quite the thing, bandages and all, and the areas are healing well as far as i can see. plus i am so busy stressing over DS that for once i have nothing much to report over DD who is on pretty chirpy form right now!!

DS - now that&apos;s another story!! Bad Attitude is a concept we have introduced and are talking to him about a lot at the mo! and boy is he displaying it in spades right now sigh ...

AN and Slowly - the first four years of my DD&apos;s life were like that too and i feel for you both. it was like dealing with a wall of negativity from sunrise to sundown every single day for what felt like centuries. and when i felt shitty for whatever reason it was a zillion times worse. time alone is crucial but so hard to find at that stage. sometimes i used to cry myself to sleep bcs i dreaded what the next day would bring (DH still shudders at the memory). what can i say...as balano says&lt;&lt;hugs&gt;&gt;and you are not alone.
speak soon xxx

DD came out of school after wearing her animal mask which I helped her make in the week and said&quot;My mask blew off in the playground so you shouldn&apos;t have made a mask, you should have done something else&quot;then she said&quot;Some other children had a mask AND animal clothes on and you should have got animal clothes for me&quot;. It doesn&apos;t look as bad when I write it down but it really irritated me as soon as I saw her!

I said she was being ungrateful and I won&apos;t want to help her make anything next time if she is going to say horrible things about what I&apos;ve done, and we had an argument all the way home. Was what I said ok or bad?

I was disappointed that she picked an argument as soon as I saw her and also tried to argue with DS when he said something nice to her. Are these things as bad as I think? I feel really angry with her and like I don&apos;t want to do anything with her for the rest of the day. I hate this ungrateful and&apos;spoilt brat&apos;behaviour, it seems to be one of the things that winds me up the most.

I suppose I should be positive and think about how it was a learning opportunity for us to talk about being grateful so it was important that it happened.

AN - absolutely standard opening line in such circs from my DD, i totally sympathise. i lose count of the number of situations of that sort i&apos;ve found myself - this is where my deep dread of doing things like&lt;&lt;silent scream&gt;&gt;crafts with her comes from! - be it making a costume for some school thing (always, but always wrong), getting her school lunch&apos;right&apos;or whatever. i tend to try to be all reasonable and brisk and to try to distract her as much as possible from the central&apos;catastrophe&apos;without getting into an argument with her if i can avoid it - much easier now at 7 than in years gone by.but i too get very hot under the collar internally about what i perceive as ingratitude. GRR! one thing i find with my DD - who is getting much more pleasurable company as she gets older i must say! - is that there is a certain lack of natural empathy - it just doesn&apos;t come easily to her - and that&apos;s a hard quality to drum into someone who doesn&apos;t quite&apos;get&apos;it!! hence the endless hours i spend trying to get her to imagine other people&apos;s feelings and situations etc - including MINE(!) - am hoping eventually all of this talking talking talking will pay off!

I have just had a lovely week with dd! It wasn&apos;t perfect but on the back of the two weeks we&apos;d had previously, it was like heaven! She has eaten her food at every meal and willingly (mealtimes are usually the worst of our battlegrounds) and has mostly helped me when I&apos;ve needed it. The horrible incessant&apos;no!&apos;that I&apos;ve been dealing with is disappearing too.

I&apos;m not gloating, I just want to have this in print so that in 2 weeks when she is driving me bonkers again, I can remember that it passes.

Interestingly, she seems to be dropping her nap (she&apos;s 2.5) and her behaviour seems to be bizarrely better when she doesn&apos;t sleep. Can children get too much sleep?

NDGoddess, I wonder if she wasn&apos;t sleeping so deeply at night when she was having naps and now she is having better quality sleep at night? Or maybe you are just doing really good parenting!

Katie, thank you for making me feel my DD&apos;s behaviour is normal. Do any children that age really feel much empathy yet? I think the things we say and keep saying do sink in even if they look like they aren&apos;t listening. Sometimes my children surprise me by repeating something I&apos;ve said, but to each other, when I thought they hadn&apos;t taken it in!

I just wanted to add one more post to this thread which I&apos;ve only just come across in last few days. Have had lots of situations with dd aged 3-6 that other posters described. I am constantly amazed to rediscover what a sweet little girl she is - so good at playing with other children and her twin brother, so affectionate in her essential nature. I see her playing with her doll and talking to it and I realise what she wants from her relationship with me. Just unconditional love and reassurance. She&apos;s so good at school, and gets invited to loads of parties (unlike her twin brother who is not nearly such a winner). Yet she&apos;s clearly constantly trying to get back from me all the attention she missed, all the attention her brothers got. I try to remember she just wants to know I value her. She destroys so many situations by her bad moods and tantrums and getting to school is her particular speciality. But all the time, I try to recapture that close relationship we had when she was a baby. I try not negotiate because that makes things worse, but ignore bad behaviour, distract and listen to good behaviour. Sometimes if she won&apos;t put on her coat getting ready to go out on a freezing day, I just ignore it, and carry the coat for later, although I feel like strangling her. She&apos;s six, so small still, and yet the terrible thing is that at three I found her behaviour unacceptable. I wish I had been more understanding. I almost feel that our relationship has improved because I&apos;ve returned to the essential core. She&apos;s the baby and I&apos;m the mother, and I&apos;m steadfast. She can&apos;t grow up until she&apos;s sure of that. P.S. I don&apos;t mean I actually treat her as a baby, just try to love her unconditionally as one would a baby.

hi swan and everyone. that was a lovely post swanriver. on a different slightly more frivolous note: DD at breakfast yesterday morning -&apos;mummy. i&apos;m worried. you&apos;re not pretty enough for daddy and i think he might split up with you and find someone prettier. and that makes me worry&apos;. aah the confidence-boost one gets from one&apos;s 7-yr-old at the start of a hectic week!!! it&apos;s those little moments that make it all worthwhile, eh?
can only assume comes from DD hanging out with new pal at school whose parents split up recently?! (but don&apos;t think it was over some gorgeous lissome 22 yr-old - but maybe i should discreetly check my facts!)
hope you are all having a slightly more egotastic week than your crushed kk123

SwanRiver, did something happen when DD was 3? Sorry if I&apos;m being thick. Are you saying you think it is your fault when your DD has her bad moods because of the way you have been with her in the past? I am interested because I started to have problems with my DD when she was 3 (now 5) and I do feel some of her behaviour is my fault but can&apos;t put my finger on exactly what I did wrong. She can probably sense my underlying mood even if I&apos;m trying to act normal and I&apos;ve had lots of&apos;unbalanced&apos;moods.

Swanriver- your post about your DD struck a chord with me. I am finding DS2 just turned 7 very difficult to deal with. He does the same thing with his coat. It winds me up no end at the time, but now I am sitting here, and he is upstairs quietly reading in bed, I can&apos;t understand how I can get so wound up about such a trivial matter. DS2 was 3 when DD was born and had to stop being my baby very quickly. I was very tired, irritable and impatient. He must have been very confused about the change in my behaviour. I am going to try and&apos;baby&apos;him a bit more because I think that&apos;s what he needs from me ATM. He has just started calling me&apos;woman&apos;in a derogatory way. I hate it and know it&apos;s wrong, and feel the need to do something about it while he&apos;s still young. DH tells him off for it too. Anyone else experienced this?

I&apos;m so glad I found this post. I feel so ashamed because I completely lost my temper with dd1 (3.5) 

She was screaming when I picked her up from the CM yesterday over something trivial, and started the screaming again this morning as soon as she woke up. It was over a lollipop can you believe? I said no (as you would at 7.15am) and that started a tantrum that went on in fits and starts for over 2 hours. I gave her other things to do and she just kept tantruming. Then she would stop, then start screaming again,&quot;My sock huuuuuurts&quot;, was an example of a problem that set her off for 20 mins or so. I ended up completely losing it.

I threw my hair brush at the floor, slammed a door, then stormed into her room and began yelling at the mess she&apos;d made (when in fact she&apos;d just been sticking papers together ) and I picked up the glue stick and started yelling that she shouldn&apos;t be taking my things. She burst into new tears and asked for her daddy, to ehich I said he was at work and wouldn&apos;t care anyway (I&apos;d just had an argument with him on the phone over dd&apos;s behaviour). What an awful thing to say. I&apos;m so ashamed of myself.

dd is such an adorable girl, so caring and kind and full of love and praise for her sister (18 months). She&apos;s extremely advanced for her age, her childminder says she should have started school this September, and thinks this is why she gets so angry, because she is frustrated. However, I then treat her as older than her age, and become angry when we have incidents such as the lollipop one... 

I&apos;m so disappointed with myself. What makes it worse is that I spend most of my week working with other people&apos;s children and have a never-ending source of patience. I have ths same patience with dd2. She is a much&apos;slower&apos;baby, and as such I expect nothing of her, and relish and delight in everything she does. So why am I so hard on dd1?

I often find myself going into her room at night just to stroke her hair and appologise, because I love her so much. But when she wakes, and starts demanding like a spoilt brat, I can&apos;t find that same level of adoration. I appologised tonight before bed for shouting at her and she just said,&quot;when was that mummy?&quot;She&apos;s so forgiving and loving, and I&apos;m just a bitch.

I would defend her with my life, so why am I the one that is screaming and tantruming at her?

cupoftea, i lost it totally with DD (7) on saturday morning. she was being negative, whiny and infuriating. after the zillionth&apos;mummmeeeee&apos;emanating from behind her closed bedroom door in a high-pitched shriek (she&apos;d been sequestered there for some now-forgotten piece of naughtiness) i stormed up the stairs, flung open the door and screamed&apos;HOW DARE YOU&apos;. meaning&apos;how dare you RUIN MY LIFE&apos;(even though she is loads better now she is older and now life is largely pretty smooth with her and punctuated by lots of great moments). i can see her now, cringing on the bed. her next utterance:&apos;please don&apos;t hit me mummy&apos;. argh. i wasn&apos;t planning to. i had no plan, actually -other than communicating my intense fury at her behaviour. these are not the edifying moments of motherhood, are they now. i have smacked her 3 or 4 times in her life, which i actually consider fairly restrained given the intense provocation i have faced - not that i am proud of lashing out i hasten to add. i&apos;m really not. but i haven&apos;t for a long time - yet it&apos;s depressing to see that the memory is lodged there in her little mind. and it was an eye-opener to see how really and truly frightened she was. because i am mostly fairly patient and cheerful i and jolly her along all the time, when i really do lose it (rare but dramatic) it&apos;s all the more terrifying to her. sigh. she was right as rain within minutes having said that. but what i hate is reminding myself of my own mother, who was prone to lashing out erratically and very frighteningly, usually much more in tune with her own moods than for any reason directly relating to us kids. have to work on self-control!!

Aaah, thank you for this thread. I have been feeling a bit lost with my parenting recently; shouting far too much at the boys (16mo and 3.4yo). It feels like between us we are sapping all the joy out of life on a daily basis, and I feel so exhausted!

I do feel more positive for recognising that my temper is having a negative effect - especially on sensitive DS1, and have been re-reading Toddler Taming and Raising Boys to remind me of those&apos;obvious&apos;things that I should/should not be doing.

It must be the day for it folks...I shouted at my LO today. I was exhausted after 7 hours straight being with/interacting him (no nursery today), has just come home with him from a long session playing in the park etc. and wanted 5 minutes to myself. DS was having none of it and I tried explaining calmly for some time and then ignoring whines/demands/pulls, attempts to climb on lap and seize whatever was in my hands and then - snap - I started raising my voice which escalated into shouting loudly. This had DS terribly, inconsolably crying (God don&apos;t you feel like shit when you reduce your child to such intense blubbing?!) and I just couldn&apos;t respond. Fortunately my Dp then emerged to see what all the fuss was about and and calmed/soothed DS then took him off my hands for half an hour. The rest of the evening went fine as I had just about had enough time to recover some patience and perspective. I seem to be getting to the point where I cannot cope well when I don&apos;t get breaks in the day from child-caring. Like everyone else here I adore my child - and it feels so awful to get to the point where you just want to scream and run away from them!

KK123 your post about your DD did make me . I&apos;ll bet you&apos;re lovely looking but your girl just heard a story and is just wanting reassurance that the story wont happen to her. I suppose I have all these sorts of ego-massaging conversations ahead of me when DS is older.

I just want to congratulate myself (sorry) that I did some good&apos;interaction&apos;with the children this pm. I made a dumb flower for DS and helped DD make one similar then played Snakes and Ladders with them. I know that I should spend time doing these type of things every day and today has reminded me that I DON&apos;T do this, I hardly EVER do this! I seem to AVOID interracting with them! This is really shit! They are calmer and happier after I&apos;ve done it and I feel they learn lots from it. They really miss out when I don&apos;t do it.

To make myself do housework (because I have a motivation problem), I write down each thing I&apos;ve done on a list and cross it out so that I can see the list getting longer and feel satisfaction at what I have achieved. It really helps, and also DH looks at it when he comes home and it pleases him and makes me feel that he appreciates what I do. Today I&apos;ve written what I&apos;ve done with the children on there as well and put stars next to it. Maybe it will make me do more of this as well as housework! I think it is very true that&quot;what gets measured gets done&quot;.

I think the same as with the housework, I don&apos;t do things with the children because I have a horrible feeling that it will be unbearable hard work (this is a symptom of depression which I&apos;m always saying I no longer have, but maybe I do a bit). When I actually do it, it is not unbearable hard work and I actually enjoy it. Perhaps I just need to get out of the negative way of thinking.

CupOfTea, a lot of what you wrote seemed familiar to me, especially about feeling so sorry when she is asleep but then angry all over again when she starts being demanding and spoilt.

At least we are all trying to improve and not giving up! This thread is motivating.

AN- I can really relate to what you say about not wanting to play with the DC as you think it will be hard work. Even a simple game of snakes and ladders seems impossible with my DC. However I am doing some voluntary work in a local school, and really enjoyed playing snakes and ladders with one of the children there. It made me wonder why I can&apos;t play it with my DC. When I try they challenge all the rules, argue with each other about who is going to have the blue counter, who will throw the dice first, try and cheat and just generally make it hard work. Why?

Any ideas about why it is going wrong, and how to change it?
I would love to enjoy playing with them, it just doesn&apos;t seem to happen, which is very sad.

Mimizan, children always cooperate with strangers more than with their own parents.

DD is nearly 4 and I know full well that in&apos;école maternelle&apos;she follows instructions and if the teacher says paint something a particular colour, she will without a fuss.

Yesterday we did painting at home and for the first time ever rather than just letting her create, I told her I would only be getting out certain colours so we could make red robin pictures (for Christmas cards) and when that was done we would have all the colours out. She started but then had a tantrum because I said that the blue would be coming out later, and went off to do something else while her older brother and I continued painting.

I don&apos;t worry about this, it is perfectly normal. I think next time rather than saying&apos;let&apos;s do painting&apos;. I&apos;ll say DS and I are going to make xxx and if she wants to join in let her.

Well, re Snakes and Ladders, DS did get angry and bite me because he didn&apos;t want to follow the rules correctly! He had to go into&apos;time out&apos;(I strap him in the pushchair) and miss one turn and I lost my temper and shouted, but after that he played sort of properly. DD was so grateful I think that I was actually doing something with her that she wasn&apos;t too bad. She did keep saying it was her turn when it wasn&apos;t and I did have to make an effort not to let this get to me. I do think you have to do these activities when you are feeling STRONG and they do seem to try to&apos;mess it up&apos;but if you stay strong and calm I think they learn a lot from it (taking turns, following rules, using self control, winning and losing).

For the times when you don&apos;t feel strong (most of the time for me) I do have another&apos;technique&apos;for interacting [sorry if I&apos;m being SmugMummy], which I did the day before when I felt so sleepy and unmotivated I could hardly wash up a cup to have a coffee! I had to force myself to do this, but I went into the lounge where the DCs were and just lay on the sofa near them and looked at them. I try to&apos;meditate&apos;on them and take in everything about them while watching them. I do this in the hope that my positive feelings for them will come, and they usually do.

I don&apos;t even think you need to make a huge effort to show these positive feelings if you are feeling really unmotivated and just having a day when you&apos;can&apos;t&apos;, because if you feel the feelings and you are looking at your children as you feel them I think they sense how you feel! I feel this with mine anyway.

Then after watching them for a bit I make comments on what they are doing and ask them dumb questions about it and join in with what they are doing but let them direct it all. I come up with ideas to make whatever dumb game they are playing more interesting and they can use my ideas if they want or not if they don&apos;t. With something like Snakes and Ladders or a specific craft project you have rules you want them to follow so loads of potential for you to be frustrated when they&apos;challenge&apos;the rules. When you let them direct the activity (I&apos;m going to call it the&quot;unstructured play technique&quot;) and just throw in ideas to make it more interesting (because their games can get bloody boring can&apos;t they for us!) you don&apos;t get so frustrated and angry!

I sometimes start to find myself getting into it despite really not wanting to do it in the first place and having creative ideas! When I get enthusiastic, they do too and it can develop into something more interesting and even educational.

My problem is getting enough motivation to force myself to start it but it is worth it when it happens. My lists and&apos;star chart&apos;for myself really help me! It may be childish but if it works....

OSOC- Yes I know they co-operate for other people more than me. It is very weary making having to find ways of gaining their co-operation. I do manage to do craft activities quite well, because I mor e or less let them do what they want. We&apos;ve had the same issues making christmas cards lol. How many parents actually make cards with their DC? I think we are good parents on this thread and it is no wonder we lose it sometimes. Most of the time we are more than good enough. Sorry if that sounds self-congratulatory btw.
Whereabouts in France are you? We lived there and DS1 went to an ecole maternelle for a year. How do you find the French school system?

Acting Normal- I like your tip about just watching the DC and then joining in. You make a lot of sense. I like dancing, playing percussion instruments, making stuff with them, baking etc I suppose I am just not a fan of board games. I didn&apos;t like them much as a child. The DC like them though, so I will try to make an effort. Snakes and ladders isn&apos;t too bad. We tried Monopoly on holiday and that was hard work.

Had that funny scenario today where I was desperate for Ds to nap and thought he was ready about 2 hours before he was. Tried pretending to nap with him - as we were at home - and ended up working harder than I was before with story telling, toy role-plays, singing songs etc. I was ready to nap for real after that but DS still rocking and rolling - this boy has limitless energy, it sometimes seems to me (or is it just that I am old ) Anyway when he was finally obviously keeling over it was out in the pushchair for the (immediate this time) big sleep. Sounds like most of you on this thread are past the toddler napping stage but do any of you remember the desperation factor...?

It sounds like you&apos;ve done some really cool things with him while trying though and you should give yourself a star, or several, on your star chart if you have one .

I know&apos;normal&apos;adults don&apos;t have their own star chart but I&apos;m doing a sort of one for me because it is actually working! [amazed]
I was already writing down every bit of housework I do so that I can feel I&apos;ve achieved something by looking at the list and it was motivating me to make the list longer and longer.

I&apos;ve only just recently started listing activities I do with the children on there as well and it is working with motivating me with that as well! I&apos;ve been putting stars next to them for more motivation and to remind myself that these times with the children are more important than housework. If I&apos;ve got stars in my list but some of the housework has not been done I&apos;ve decided that that is ok. This is important for me because I think I was always finding reasons to avoid interacting with the children and I sometimes used housework.

I know I&apos;m going on and on about my fecking star chart but I&apos;m just so amazed that something is working on my lack of motivation and depression and low self esteem (from feeling like I don&apos;t achieve enough and am a crap mother etc) when I&apos;ve tried so many other things that have made no difference! I might go on about it even more in the mental health section.

I got 4 stars today, 1 yesterday and 3 the day before. That&apos;s only 3 days so I should probably do it for a couple of weeks before going on about it as a&apos;cure&apos;in&quot;mental health&quot;. Already I feel there has been some kind of shift in my brain though.

My 2.2 year old has always been a quite fussy, conservative eater and recently this has got worse, with him refusing a lot of food automatically. I make a meal, give it to him and he just shouts&quot;NO!&quot;and pushes plate away - end of story! I think maybe I have now got into negative patterns around pressurising him to eat or maybe this is just the main arena for his asserting the famous 2 year old Will, as it feels like it has become a battlefield on the quiet. It&apos;s just so hard-wired into me as a mum to want him to eat nutritious food - or at least reasonably good food (I&apos;m not faddy or trying to force broccoli and vegan nut meals on him BTW!) that I find it so painful to watch him only eat half a digestive biscuit and a tiny pot of yoghurt for dinner - basically very little and that&apos;s after having tried all sorts of other stuff. Otherwise he is drinking well (milk - both formula and normal, juices and water) and seems to be getting enough good stuff one way or the other as he seems very healthy and energetic, growing fast and a good weight.

It can make me cry trying to feed him though! I have tried being (pretending to be) cool about whether he eats anything or not, tried making it fun in different ways (car and aeroplane pasta, chase the peas which make a bee sound etc.) Tried eating together as a family v him eating alone, tried putting him in front of favourite programmes while he eats so he gets a pleasure/distraction factor, tried shamelessly manipulating him with YOutube short films of various toddlers eating (!). My DP thinks I should just let him either eat or not eat and make minimal fuss, and not make more than one meal for him if he doesn&apos;t seem to like the first one (that he would eat it if he was hungry). I think he&apos;s probably right, but he does not have it as his&apos;job&apos;to feed my DS three or more times per day and so doesn&apos;t actually engage in this dynamic/problem/whatever it is as I do. I veer between thinking all is probably normal (and DS is getting enough good food in him one way or the other) and the battle of wills is bound to come out somewhere to thinking Ds is going to miss out on essential nutrients and/or will end up with an eating disorder from my stressing around him eating???? Help!

sky, hello xx no time to post re food (tho SYMPATHY +++ and yes he is going to survive this on the nutritional front JUST FINE) but just wanted to quickly post re SLEEP - i used to just about weep with the tension i used to feel when DD wouldn&apos;t nap, knowing the horrors of the afternoon ahead if she failed to recharge at midday with her zzz&apos;s. this was at about your stage - when she was just starting to fight her nap. by this stage i had a baby too (who, left to his own devices, was in a lovely little routine of a 2 hour midday sleep, as they often are at that age). i used to do ANYTHING to get her to sleep. walked the streets with both of them for hours, hoiking baby out of his perfect she-who-won&apos;t-be-named sleep (not that we managed any other part of her routine, but i was pretty rigid with daytime sleeps) in his carefully darkened room to cram him into a borrowed double pushchair with his grumpy big sis. i would drive for miles (oh the eco-guilt!), round and round the block. anything. i tried all the alternatives eg quiet time, dvd&apos;s and yes eventually they came to replace her nap reasonably well. but for about a year nothing but a nap would mitigate against the Afternoon From Hell. i used to get really wound up about it all and so YES i have felt that desperation, you are certainly not alone! i even on a few occasions drove DD round the block with baby inside the house fast asleep, knowing he was such a reliable sleeper that for the ten minutes required he would be fine. looking up fearfully at his little window for leaping flames on every trip past the housefront. argh argh argh.

Thanks Katiek omg although I only have one child I recognise all your tactics -bar the driving as I cant drive! I have double posted the eating thread elsewhere as I was so fed up (LOL at freudian use of phrase) with the eating lark, and have already had some very good advice about the&apos;hands off - provide good meals but don&apos;t expect/make fuss about eating. But good to hear your nutritional opinion so thanks...

ActingNormal, couldn&apos;t find this thread recently (?) and now my computer&apos;s broken. Just to say that nothing happened to my daughter at 3 years in particular, except that she was independent enough to articulate her essential jealousy of her twin brother, who I think was the apple of my eye but less advanced in many ways than her (but somehow cuddlier). I think she felt that whatever she did to please me, he was always my favourite. Once I recognised that he was my favourite (subconsciously) which was a terrible thing to realise, I tried to recapture some of the feelings I had had for her as a tiny baby when I had felt especially close. And then I ended the vicious circle, when she behaved badly because she felt unloved, and was less loved because she behaved badly. We are getting on very well now, and I just hug her a lot, and try to listen to her. And not give her too many material things which never satisfy for long. P.S. Won&apos;t be logging on to mumsnet in near future as computer broken...

Skydancer- my eldest DS was a challenge sleepwise. He was hard to get down for a nap in the afternoons, and was a very early riser. He&apos;s still first up in the household. We call him rooster, but he has learnt in the last year(he&apos;s now 9) that it is best not to come in our room to pester us to get up. Now he goes downstairs and turns the TV on. This is not perfect, but it gives us all a bit more sleep. 
For the afternoon nap, when DS1 was 4 and DS2 was 2, I&apos;d be completely desperate to have a break from them both mid-afternoon. I have lots of memories, of putting them in the car, cranking up the heat, to make them drowsy, turning on Classic FM to relax them, then driving for milesand miles. Terrible for the environment. I used to have to drive to the motorway, because they needed a smooth drive at an average speed of 50 MPH to fall asleep.
I felt completely insane, and am really surprised I never had an accident. It&apos;s a good job, I didn&apos;t live near Katiek because we&apos;d probably have had a head on collision with my manic driving, and her staring up at windows for flames 
However that time has now past. There are new challenges , but I can honestly say that the sleep deprivation stage has been one of the hardest.
With the eating, DD age 3 doesn&apos;t eat&apos;proper&apos;meals. We have decided not to force the issue. She eats alot of cereal at breakfast time, bits of fruit here and there, picks at meals and still has lots of milk to drink. We have regular family meals and sits with us, but we don&apos;t make her eat. Basically she eats when she&apos;s hungry, and I try not to stress too much about whether her diet is balanced, if she&apos;s getting enough etc.

Hi Mimizan,

I&apos;m sorry you&apos;ve had similar challenges but I&apos;ve got to say it&apos;s so good to hear other mums so frank about how nuts they go with sleep/having a break from kids deprivation! I go my absolute nuttiest around this time of day now, as the naps are getting later and sometimes non-existent, but DS is knackered, clumsy, emotional, clingier and prone to accidents but fighting sleep. Actually I managed to stay calm and philosophical about his state for quite some time today but then suddenly I turned into&apos;Desperado&apos;. I&apos;m only able to write this because my DP has taken DS off my hands. Oh they&apos;ve just returned with a sleeping beauty...How come my DP has the magic touch with getting LO off to la-la land - probably because he&apos;s not desperate 

Food - good to have a breakdown of how your DD eats...very similarly to mine. DS had a lot today so far for breakfast and lunch but all in bits and pieces here and there. Leaving aside drinks he&apos;s had half an apple, most of a banana, a digestive biscuit, a few mouthfuls of a stew - (potato, lentil and carrots etc.) and some eggy-potato. I have been enjoying not making a sing and dance around him&apos;not&apos;eating and hey presto the lad eats .

LOL mimi at our imaginary near-collision on our mission-destroy-the-planet drivathons . i did eventually do the green thing and switched to cycling along with one or the other in the back seat for miles on end when they got a bit older and i had someone to mind the other at home(!). got me fit, well fitter, at least!their heads did loll about a bit disconcertingly when they fell asleep but it was a risk i felt was worth taking 
agree wholeheartedly that while other challenges replace those of the earlier years, the sleep deprivation one has got to be high on the list of the very worst that we mums (and pas) have to endure but it IS temporary. just feels like forever at the time, i clearly recall!
you and sky sound like you have the eating thing sussed between you - good luck. i am struggling with table manners at the moment but the fussiness (DD dreadful in the toddler years - foods not allowed to touch each other on plate, v restricted number of foods eaten etc etc)has receded a lot with age, thankfully.

I&apos;ve had such a terrible weekend. The boys&apos;behaviour is putting so much strain on mine and DH&apos;s relationship that I don&apos;t know how much longer we can go on.

I have been trying really hard not to shout and to deal with the conflict calmly, but I just get criticism from DH about how I handle things. We had a huge row this morning in front of them and DS1 was very upset, I feel so guilty. DH still not talking to me either .

SwanRiver, I loved reading your post because it feels satisfying to see how you had a problem, recognised it, made sense of it and understood it, changed your&apos;techniques&apos;and solved the problem! It gives us hope that these sort of things can be&apos;fixed&apos;! I feel there was a similar thing going on with my DD and DS (also less advanced than she was at his age but&quot;somehow cuddlier&quot;) and I&apos;ve been working on it with very gradual improvement. Lately though, because there is so much more I can do with her than with him, because we both like art and craft and she is older and can do other more complex activities, but he is younger and hates art and craft, I feel like she has had more attention than him! It feels so important that they should be treated equally, but because they are different people it has to be done in different ways.

Skydancer, when I read&quot;how many stars should I get?&quot;for some reason a quote from my therapist came into my head -&quot;You know (puts his hand on his heart), deep down you know, listen to and trust your instincts&quot;. (The things he says are useful but also seem really comical to me.) What I mean is, you instinctively know how much of an achievement as a parent it was so you know how many stars to put, and if you know deep down that you are&apos;cheating&apos;and putting too many stars you will feel a faint feeling of guilt. (I know it wasn&apos;t a serious question and I&apos;ve typed a semi-serious answer but I&apos;m obsessed with the new star chart thing at the moment, it&apos;s still working for me and I&apos;m amazed that something is really working and it isn&apos;t my shelf-full of herbal remedies).

Re the sleep thing, it has such a HUGE negative effect on how tolerant you can be and how positive you can be and I can&apos;t blame anyone for feeling crap about their parenting before the sleep thing is sorted - YOUR sleep I mean. If you have any emotional issues or mental illnesses lack of sleep intensifies them. My children are good sleepers now but when I don&apos;t get enough sleep for other reasons I feel myself slipping back into the&apos;madness&apos;that I feel I am now coming out of! In my last therapy session he went on about focussing on getting more sleep so he must agree. Also because lack of sleep makes you think negatively, you are probably doing a much better job of everything than you think you are.

Washersaurus, are you getting enough sleep? How old are your boys? What behaviour are they doing? How long has it been like this?
 Add message | Report | Message poster Washersaurus Sun 23-Nov-08 21:04:29 
I don&apos;t get enough sleep; DS1 is 3yo and DS2 is 16mo. DS2 doesn&apos;t really like sleep and is a very clingy demanding little boy. DS1 suffers if he doesn&apos;t sleep enough and so is also very grumpy at the moment. Neither of them eat much, DS2 is currently living off cereal bars and fromage frais, he hardly drinks anything either but still bf twice a day. They fight almost continuously and it always ends in DS1 pushing or hitting DS2, who then bites.

I go mad if I stay at home with them all day because of their behaviour, but if I take them out anyway, DS1 sits in the buggy scowling and refuses to take part, DS2 rampages; toys hurled across the room, things destroyed, tantrums etc. I usually opt to take them out despite of this but it leaves me feeling frazzled and by tea time I am usually screaming at them as I&apos;ve had enough.

Gawd, sorry that was a long post, sorry.

God it must be really hard work having 2 children that young and with the sleeping and eating not sorted yet! Who can blame you for getting stressed and irritable! I bet loads of people have told you it will get easier but it is really hard for you to see it/believe it, but it WILL! Try to do everything the easiest possible way and be easy on yourself and don&apos;t forget to do kind things for yourself. Persevere with trying different things to help with their sleeping and eating until you find what works for them. I bet their behaviour will improve once those things are sorted. Post details of what the problems are with the sleeping and eating - what happens at those times and get everyone&apos;s ideas to try, there are some really clever types on here

I&apos;m so glad I found this thread, DH thinks I&apos;m a terrible mother.

DS2 has never really slept well, even co-sleeping never worked. Until recently he was still waking for night feeds. We moved him into a bed with a pillow and duvet which improved things. He still wakes at night sometimes, but can usually be settled. He wakes at around 5/6am for a feed. He will only have daytime naps in bed if DH puts him up to bed - which is rare as DH does work f/t. DH also has to sit with him until he goes off to sleep in the evening after I have fed him as he won&apos;t settle for me.

I think my main issue is the relationship between DS1 and DS2, they just fight all the time, and DS2 is so aggressive and generally lairy, I don&apos;t know how to handle him. DS1 is uber sensitive and I&apos;m so worried I&apos;m screwing him up.

I&apos;m not too stressed about the meals tbh, that is a battle for another day.

Hi all,

Really lovely to find you all and read this thread (most of it, anyway). Please can I come and join in? So much of what&apos;s been said has resonated with me...

I have two DSs, 4.5 and 14 mths. I too have&apos;discovered&apos;my anger since becoming a parent and it totally terrifies me. My DSs are the last people I&apos;d want to expose this side of myself to and yet they&apos;ve pretty much been the only people in my life who have opened the floodgates .

I think I was never really allowed to express my feelings as a child so anger has never really featured in my adult emotional repertoire. Sadness has always taken over the airwaves instead, probably more&apos;acceptable&apos;, I guess, certainly easier to hide.

My most shameful anger actions (getting fewer and further between since I started to work on myself a couple of years ago) are shouting at them and being far too rough when pulling DS1 (and it&apos;s mainly him, poor little mite, given that my self awareness drive kicked in before DS2 was born) away from whatever thing he&apos;s destroying/doing/not doing. I can&apos;t bear how the urge overtakes me to get physical when I&apos;m in a rage (pulling jumper of contention on really roughly, for example, or snatching toy-used-as-weapon and throwing it across the room)

I&apos;m in two minds about the&apos;some children are more challenging than others&apos;idea. Part of me feels all children are perfect and anything that goes awry is as a result of the environment/parenting they&apos;re faced with (not that it&apos;s our fault, we&apos;re all doing the very best we can, hence all this soul searching).

On the other hand, just to tell you a little bit about DS1... he&apos;s a bit... unusual I suppose. He seems to have sensory issues so melts down very dramaticallly (displays of temper to rival mine, basically) over lots of day-to-day issues, eg, temperature of milk, seams in socks, noise of little brother crying, etc.

He&apos;s also highly sensitive and yet mainly oblivious to my emotions, if that makes sense. So, this morning for example, I&apos;m packing his lunch for school and he starts to turn the lights on and off and laugh demonically. I say to him very calmly and firmly&apos;Leave the light on please, otherwise I can&apos;t see&apos;he does it again, I say it again, he does it again, I say it again, he does it again I say&apos;leave the light on!&apos;(rising irritation) he does it again I yell&quot;Right! Stop touching the lights&quot;he bursts into floods of inconsolable tears&apos;mummy, don&apos;t have a cross face! No getting cross! No shouting!&quot;Takes a good 10 minutes for him to calm down. This same process goes on over lots of recurring issues -- his fondness for pulling curtains off their hooks, for example, or weeing in strange places or pushing his little brother over.

And the worst is when he gets physical, which he does a lot. I find this particularly hard. He&apos;s constantly pulling my hair, hitting, headbutting, lifting up my skirt, just nasty general tweaking and poking which I find really hard to tolerate. He does these things when angry but mainly in a spirit of mischief. And again I just don&apos;t seem to be able to communicate with him over it, so I say calmly time and time again and it&apos;s only when I get pushed over the edge that it stops.

AND of course, he&apos;s also the most wonderful little boy in the world. He sings like an angel, he&apos;s really bright and healthy, every day he notices things that would have passed me by if he wasn&apos;t in my life and I feel utterly blessed to have him. Granted he can be a bit eccentric (Loves to watch George Formby videos on youtube and joins in with one of my frying pans as a banjo, makes up his own words for things has an extreme fascination for lawnmowers and generally prefers kitchen utensils to toys) but to us that&apos;s what makes him really really fun to be with when he&apos;s not assaulting me.

As for the aforementioned&apos;work on myself&apos;I&apos;ve discovered the empathy-based approached to parenting and realised that they&apos;re the answer to all the uneasiness I&apos;d previously felt with the punishment/reward based methods that all around me tended to use(and my own parents, certainly). Not to condemn anyone for finding that approach helpful but it just never particularly worked for me. But of course the ongoing challenge is that empathy and anger are not easy bedfellows!

Books which have really helped me were the&apos;how to talk...&apos;book and Alfie Kohn&apos;s&apos;Unconditional Parenting&apos;and Naomi Aldort&apos;s&apos;Raising Children, Raising Ourselves&apos;which has really helped me to realise that, as so many of you have identified, lots of my parenting shortfalls are an expression of my own unmet needs. AND, it&apos;s not my children&apos;s job to rectify this.

Aldort advises, at one point, to step away from the situation that might make you do something you later regret and really let your anger run riot in your head. Literally fantasise yourself screaming&apos;shut the fuck up!&apos;or hitting them or whatever. Then realise that those feelings aren&apos;t about now, they&apos;re not authentically you and your love for your child, they&apos;re not&apos;real&apos;. And come back to the present, with your child, much more understanding of the here and now. I don&apos;t always take the time to do this, don&apos;t always have the self-control to step away but I think it&apos;s a powerful technique.

Another thing we&apos;re considering in our house is installing an inflatable punch bag (we&apos;ll call the angry station) for both DSs and us to use when we feel we need to let it out.

Anyway, lovely to meet you all and thank you for letting me whittle on and for all your inspiring posts.

Hi Wash Firstly you are not a bad mother. You are a good mother. Keep saying that to yourself. I find doing that stops some of the negative thoughts. You sound exhausted, and who wouldn&apos;t be with two demanding toddlers. It can all feel pretty relentless. 
Secondly, what kind of bedtime routine are your DSs in? IME if you get only one routine sorted, this is the most important. Knowing my DSs would be tucked up safely in bed by 7.30, restored my will to live. That way you get a bit of time to yourself/with DH(even if he&apos;s pissing you right off with unhelpful comments ). Also the DSs get a proper sleep, so they are easier to manage the following day. If you need some ideas on bedtime routine let us know.
Thirdly, I used to have to get out with my DSs when they were the age of your 2, still do actually, because if we stay in we all go CRAZY. Choose the activity/venue carefully. I used to go to a music group where all the mummies were smug, and had well behaved girl babies. I was publicly humiliated on several occasions, purely because I had a boisterous/ non-compliant(spirited) DS. My boys far preferred swimming, running around parks etc. to sitting doing structured activities. Wish I&apos;d sacked the music group sooner than I did. If they are well exercised sleep and eating routines seem to follow on more easily.

Katiek, thanks for making me LOL at the things you did to make the DC sleep. I&apos;m impressed at you tackling table manners. I don&apos;t really notice that our dinner table resembles feeding time at the zoo, until MIL visits. I then become acutely conscious of DS1 talking with food spilling out of his mouth, DS2 not even using cutlery, and DD jumping up and down on her tripp-trapp chair. MIL has an&apos;I am not amused look on her face&apos;.

BTW Wash, my two DSs fight quite a bit. I have recently read that boys need to play fight to learn how to stop when the other person has had enough. I think it was Steve Biddulph who suggested it is part of the father&apos;s role to do this&apos;fighting&apos;with them. My DH is a fantastic father in many ways but doesn&apos;t do this fighting. My DSs regularly go too far with eachother and one of them gets hurt. DS1 has also been in some bother with older boys at school, and I think they&apos;ve hurt him because he doesn&apos;t know when to stop whilst playing with them. The older boys hurt him trying to get him to stop.
I&apos;ve tried to suggest to my DH that he plays with our DSs in this way, but he felt I was criticising him.

hi everyone, and welcome wash and duchess - you sound like you are on the right thread - duchess if i&apos;m sure of one thing, it&apos;s that some kids really are different from others, and highly sensitive children are particularly challenging. i have one, you have one. a lot of people on this thread do too. we all still face the same problems as anyone else rearing children of course, but sometimes in capital letters, and with knobs and bells on bcs of those temperamental issues!
mimi - i had a music class i used to go to with my head held high and come out of a broken woman too!! my DD wouldn&apos;t tear around, but got really upset by loud instruments eg cymbals - nightmare. the things that every other kid loves. she just used to howl and keep her hands on her ears most of the hour! you live and learn eh?! there are so many things like that i would not even contemplate if i had to start over. but, like you, we HAD to get out of the house (and by 9am, often) when my kids were 2 and 4 and upwards for a year or two after that!!
my kids don&apos;t often fight in a prolonged way, and mostly get on well, but when DD gets irritated by DS she often lashes out and whacks him and that really gets to me. she seems to have zero self-control. he is a bloody pain at times, it&apos;s true , having said that!!

Hi Katie,

thanks for that, lovely to feel supported. Sometimes all we need is recognition that we have it hard.... goes a long way! A bit like the empathy we&apos;re trying to muster up for our children I suppose... sometimes well-meaning people are too quick to give advice/strategies/etc. when all we really need is&apos;bloody hell poor you I don&apos;t know how you do it&apos;etc.

will seek out the sensitive child book, deffo.

Hi new people - good to read you. This is my favourite thread on MN - I&apos;ve found it incredibly helpful, supportive, real and funny.

kk123 I tried that online&apos;sensitive child&apos;test and gave my DS score 13 out of 18, so he seems to qualify (if he had a problem with noise and physical discomfort etc. he&apos;d be up there with your DD). I&apos;m still hoping my DS will become more noise sensitive actually - at what age do kids learn volume control on their voices I wonder? 

ActingNormal thanks for your thoughts on the star chart. I may get there yet but haven&apos;t really got into star-charts myself. They sound great for you though!

Washersaurus. Just to echo what others have said, I am sorry your DH is not expressing more appreciation and encouragement for your mothering. It&apos;s one thing finding mothering hard or having demanding children and/or not having found good strategies to deal with challenging behaviour etc. and quite another thing being a&apos;bad mother&apos;. Ok I have to admit on a really bad day I will break down, have a little weep and wail at my DP&quot;I&apos;m just a bad mother!&quot;and he just laughs (arn&apos;t guys great?! ) but I know that he laughs because he thinks I&apos;m a very good mother. None of us are perfect but going round with the self-label&apos;bad mother&apos;is not going to help you at all. Try to remind yourself of all the ways you are a good parent to your DCs (even if it&apos;s only in your heart on a particular day!) and I think changes you need to make with your DCs will be easier to make from a basis of more appreciation for yourself.

Duchess, AK has also been extremely helpful to me.

I don&apos;t think my children are particularly demanding or that I have a particularly short fuse (not compared to my mum anyhow!). Actually, I initially came on this thread to offer a bit of advice.

But I do know that on the times I have got angrier than I would have liked or a situation has turned sour it was either through tiredness or expecting too much from my children/lacking empathy.

It&apos;s not always possible to combat the tiredness but I CAN try to see things from their pov and lower my expectations.

sky - sadly i can vouch for the fact that sensitivity to other people&apos;s noise is entirely compatible (in my kids at least) with a total lack of volume control on their own noise ! DS actually had a letter home today asking us to&apos;please reinforce at home all that we are doing at school to get DS to keep his voice at a normal level&apos; ! can&apos;t even blame glue ear - tested all clear recently. bellowing is just 2nd nature to him it seems!

I just found this thread and I sooo need some support with this. I have read Raising Your Spirited Child and the Highly Sensitive Child which are very good and have helped somewhat. They also helped me to realize that ds1 has Sensory Processing Disorder so we have gotten occupational therapy for that which helps a bit . Still he is the most demanding child and uses up most of my energy as well as dh&apos;s Ds2 is a little angel but sometimes picks up on ds1&apos;s bad behavior and starts to mimic it. some days I feel as if I cannot take it one more minute.

jabber - my friend has a little girl with sensory processing disorder and she is SO much better now she is older (now 8). they are in washington though so got more input from specialist services compared to the uk from what i gather.
the main reason i am on this thread is to reassure mums like you who are nearing the end of their tether, as i TOTALLY was a few years ago (and completely oblivious to MN, which i kick myself for in retrospect!), that if you HANG ON IN THERE it all gets immmeasurably better as your child matures, gets to grips with his/her incredibly strong emotions, becomes more secure and more in control generally, etc etc etc. i do not know how i lived through my DD&apos;s earlier years but she is now, at 7, a different child from her incarnation as a 3,4,5 yr old. it will surely be the same for you. don&apos;t despair

Thank you for being so supportive; something that is definitely lacking here in the Wash House.

I have had a much better day today, but that is more to do with meeting up with a good friend this morning, as DS1 is&apos;best friends&apos;with her daughter. He really enjoyed himself and was much more relaxed.

We took it easy this afternoon and I put a temporary break from beating myself up over letting them watch cbeebies (it is the only thing that keeps them out of mischief some days, especially when they are tired)

Saying that, DS2 woke at midnight again last night and wouldn&apos;t/couldn&apos;t? go back to sleep until I bf him (comfort, not hunger)and we put him in bed with us at 1am. He slept a bit later this morning, which gave DS1 a chance to sleep in too.

DH was cursing and muttering about killing himself as he tried to settle him though (very helpful I&apos;m sure), I am worried about the mental distress the interuptions to our sleep are causing.

I would love to skip the baby music classes etc but feel bad for DS2 as he does enjoy them, as DS1 used to. I would love to take them swimming but couldn&apos;t manage 2 non swimmers safely on my own!

Hello everyone,

I haven&apos;t posted here for a while as things were going very well for a few weeks here. Certainly, DD has had fewer tantrums and I had been getting more sleep and looking after myself a bit better.

Today&apos;s been a bit crap and totally down to me, I&apos;m afraid. I&apos;ve been recovering from a sickness bug over the weekend and just had no patience today with DD. She has finally entered the&apos;Why?&apos;phase and I think I must have heard that word 50 times today.I tried so hard to tell myself it&apos;s a GOOD thing that she&apos;s curious and inquisitive and asking questions about the world but I couldn&apos;t help feeling intensely irritated by having to attempt to answer the question so many times and in such bizarre contexts. (&apos;Is that a blue car?&apos;,&apos;Yes&apos;,&apos;Why?&apos;etc) I&apos;m afraid I couldn&apos;t really hide my weariness with it all and now I think she&apos;s doing it MORE because she can see how much it annoys me.

Cupofteaplease- I so identify with your feelings, especially the thing about going to look at DD when she&apos;s asleep; stroking her hair and saying sorry to her....why can&apos;t I just be nicer to her when she&apos;s awake? I, too, feel like a bitch and am sure I must be damaging her for life I hate the way I am with her so why do I find it so hard to change my behaviour?

Olifin, sounds like you have managed some changes for the better over the last few weeks.

Don&apos;t beat yourself up about losing patience. The&apos;why&apos;phase is hard work even when you are completely well.

Your DD is asking&apos;why&apos;so she is probably old enough to understand that when people are tired and ill they lack patience. But she isn&apos;t old enough to remember it. When you do snap, do you apologise to her when she is awake and remind her that you are under the weather?

katie, that does give me something to look forward to. We are in the US and have had some positive results getting OT through the school system. That said, he is taking a little break from it atm. His behavior has been quite challenging lately and we have decided maybe he is fed up with therapy for now I just don&apos;t know...which is how I feel about him much of the time. Today he had to be carried kicking and screaming to the car to go to school but fortunately had calmed down by the time he and dh arrived.

Duchess, I really identify with what you said about not being allowed to express yourself when you were a child but when you had your own children your repressed feelings from back then were really triggered. This was the same for me and really shocked me how I could feel extreme negative emotions around the people I loved more than anything in the world. I didn&apos;t realise til I came on MN that this is quite common! It made me finally get some proper therapy and sort out my childhood stuff because it wasn&apos;t just affecting me anymore but coming out on my DCs (and DH).

I also feel that any bad behaviours of my children are my fault, because I SO blame my parents for a lot of mine/my bro&apos;s problems. I judge myself very harshly as a parent and I get the impression lots of people on here judge themselves harshly too. It is better than not thinking about how we are doing things at all though. But some balance is needed or we will become so disheartened that we could feel like giving up being any good.

You wrote about keeping calm when your DS does an annoying thing over and over again but then he only stops when you react more strongly. But I think reacting strongly occassionally is ok! (Maybe you feel worse about it because of the habit of not being allowed to express yourself from childhood.) I think it is ok for children to sometimes see what negative emotions look like. If when they are older they push and push someone for a reaction and then that person loses it (a natural reaction) and reacts angrily but the child has never seen anyone do this before it will scare them and they won&apos;t know how to handle it! Also if you never show anger about this sort of thing they might not even realise that it is something they should try not to do because it upsets people. As with everything there has to be a balance, showing some anger, IMO, is ok but being angry all the time or being excessively angry for the situation (this used to be my problem) is not. I think if you didn&apos;t have normal parental role models it is really hard to know how to be with your children. I always have to stop and think, would this be a normal reaction or not. I think it is important to teach children how to cope in the real world and shielding them from any negative reactions altogether won&apos;t help.

I think the punchbag is a really excellent idea and teaching the children how to express anger in an appropriate way rather than repress it.

You sound like you have worked really hard on your approach to parenting and it sounds like you are doing a fantastic job. I think I&apos;ll try that book you mentioned.

Mimizan, you wrote about boys needing to learn slightly different things to girls and from what I&apos;ve seen from having a boy and a girl I&apos;m starting to think I should read that book about raising boys. DS is definately more physical than DD in some kind of way. He used to have problems with other children and be somehow intimidated by their physical presence. I&apos;ve been taking him to soft play centres quite a lot with another boy his age who is very physical and although DS loves him, he makes DS cry quite often by being too boisterous, not really hurting him, just kind of scaring him with the amount of movement. I wasn&apos;t sure whether I should keep DS away from him because he cried so much at one stage, and it took hardly anything, just if someone looked at him the wrong way. But I&apos;ve seen DS improve in how he deals with it and now he is more likely to tell his friend/other children to stop doing something he doesn&apos;t like and stand up for himself verbally rather than just crying or lashing out physically. Basically he is getting used to what it is like being with other boys and starting to enjoy playing with them rather than on his own near them. I suppose maybe he would have improved with age anyway but today I&apos;m congratulating myself for giving him regular contact with other children in a physical setting [smug mummy].

KatieK, you were saying about your DS being high volume all the time and about the spirited child book making you feel better by validating that it really IS harder with a spirited child. I feel kind of frustrated about my children though because when they are at home they act like the children in the book but when I go to nursery and school parents&apos;evenings they describe my children as being quiet, well behaved, calm, and no problem! Then I think am I imagining it? Am I going mad? Have I just got no tolerance? I&apos;m thinking maybe my children are normal and I am/have been (getting better recently) just crap at coping!

Olifin, I agree with OtherSide, you can definately forgive yourself for being less patient when you are feeling ill! Children are hard work and take most of your mental/physical resources when you are WELL so when you are ill it is SO hard.

Apart from all this, I wanted to share a&apos;dimwit&apos;thought I had lately which seems to help me in case it could help anyone else - this morning I felt awful having just woken up, angry to be awake, as usual, and the children were being too loud and moving around too much for my brain to handle when I suddenly had the thought of imagining they were baby tiger cubs frolicking about. I instantly felt better! I&apos;m not sure why (?). Maybe because my expectations of them are too high? Maybe because I wouldn&apos;t expect a baby animal to have self control and calmness but I shouldn&apos;t expect human animals to have much either. I must not realise most of the time that I am expecting too much. Later on we had just got in from school and I was busy unstrapping DS from his pushchair and taking his coat and shoes off and still had mine on and needed to go to the toilet but DD was going on and on and on at me about what she wanted to do next and wanted me to help her with when we had barely got in the door. This sort of thing makes my blood pressure feel like it is rising and my anger builds up and I feel anxious and pressured but for some reason the image of a small dog jumping up and down yapping in the place of DD came into my head! I don&apos;t know where it came from but again I felt instantly better!

Duchess, I have a six year old boy who I adore quite unconditionally. However he is considered quite badly behaved by many people. He is very loud, and yet hates large groups of people, and loves to play in a quiet group at trains or play acting. He often does some of those annoying fugue like activities you describe in your son, jabbering, laughing hysterically, saying some rude phrase over and over again for effect and I would say just being generally very silly. If he&apos;s just needing to go out and run around or ride his bike I would GO OUT. When exercise is not problem, my reaction is to immediately get down to his level and talk firmly and quietly to him, warning him to cease or he will be removed to another room. That&apos;s the crisis management method. The empathy method for dealing with this is to reassure him in what is clearly a display of anxiety or confusion - like toddlers running amok in a music session. That means paying him some attention and trying to distract him from his mad mood, ie getting him involved in something that calms him down. That could be chatting to him, cooking with him for a short time (nothing longwinded or perfectionist, just a pancake or two) setting up an imaginary game with cars or trains for him to play quietly with,or just taking him away from a busy situation by offering technical book or hypnotic video. What doesn&apos;t help is to tell him to go away, sit down and behave, or be quiet, or eat nicely. Well we do try that but it hasn&apos;t worked so far! I think our friends think he&apos;s a very loud, messy difficult exasperating child, but we think he&apos;s amazing because he&apos;s so good at absorbing information, and so interested in the things that interest him, dancing, trains running, his fav. soft toys. He has a few friends who he loves, but is not generally that socially sophisticated. Maybe his behaviour suited us, quiet play boisterous running around and fascination with books and trains, whereas his sister who is considered by our relations and friends much easier, hated walking, wasn&apos;t that interested in books, and wanted lots of social interaction friends round doing things with Mummy etc. And we found her much harder work and more difficult to defuse.

Swanriver - thank you so much for that, your ds sounds a lot like mine and your positive perspective is an inspiration . And I love your expression&apos;annoying fugue-like activities&apos;. TOTALLY! What a brilliantly apt description. And yes, getting out is the key a lot of the time. We have a pretend dog called Bruno who has to be walked every day after school, rain or shine. He quite often gets lost so has to be called in a very loud voice 

AN - how lovely and supportive you are. It really helps to hear that perhaps, within reason, our dc&apos;s need to see the emotional impact their behaviour can have. I&apos;ve also been to therapy and my therapist said this very thing when I was consumed with guilt about my failure to stay completely calm at all times. It&apos;s just myself I have to convince. And, like you say, that needs to be my adult self not my child self.

Jeez, wasn&apos;t it all so much easier before we became parents and could just happily keep all these pesky ishoos deep deep inside so that we didn&apos;t even know they were there!

Oh well, I intend to try your&apos;cute baby animals imagining technique&apos;next time it starts to get ugly. I&apos;ll let you know how I get on....

wow...SO much to read and absorb tonight! you are all so articulate and interesting girls, and so self-aware - respect!!
i am very interested - AN, duchess and others - in the repression of one&apos;s childhood emotions and the effects that has on our own parenting - i am sure this applies to a lot of us, partly bcs of the era we were raised in (no&apos;how to talk...&apos;book on my - perfectly decent but not very psychologically-minded parents&apos;shelves, i can assure you!!) though not just bcs of that in many of our cases 

i forgot to add part two to my story a few posts back - when DD kindly informed me i was not attractive enough for daddy (thanks, pal!!) and he might find someone else , i told that story to my mother on the phone. to entertain her!! for no other reason!! her reaction: to shoot from the hip -&apos;i hope you slapped her&apos; followed by&apos;well, i hope you explained looks weren&apos;t important - and if they were, then you&apos;d never have married her father&apos; ! you can begin to see why i try so hard to be patient-calm-smiling-reasonable mummy (then lose it every now and again in impressive and dramatic fashion from the strain of keeping anger and snappy responses etc under wraps!). after a few years of experience i now agree with AN - it is FINE to express anger on a relatively regular basis, but in a controlled way of course, and to move on swiftly once the situation has been dealt with, the slate wiped clean once again.

Hi All

Hope you had a better day today Washer . Have you managed to get more sleep?

 ActingNormal - my DSs are definitely different to DD. It&apos;s just the amount of energy they have. DD doesn&apos;t seem to need the same amount of exercise. She can occupy herself for long periods just by pottering, whereas they will fight because they are bored. . However they do have periods when they play really nicely together. Just not recently. &apos;Raising Boys&apos;is definitely worth a read.

 Katiek - the music group was probably one of the lowest points in my&apos;parenting career&apos; 
I can still feel the pain of DS1 swinging on my hair, whilst the other participants blew bubbles at their PFBs to&apos;My Baby Just Cares For Me&apos;

Hi, I have had a better day, probably because I am so much more aware of my bad behaviour and am trying really really hard to stay calm, and partly because I made sure they both had an early night last night.

I am re-reading Toddler Taming and Raising Boys at the moment which have given me food for thought; especially the bit about ignoring the unimportant stuff.

Unfortunately, I still snapped at DS1 a couple of times today; once when he wouldn&apos;t stand next to me at a crossing (that was a safety issue), and once for going mad and jumping on my bed, throwing the blankets about, whilst I was trying to tidy (that was just me getting tired and aggravated).

My improved behaviour has reflected in their behaviour though; they have both seemed much happier today and people even commented on how happy DS1 is whilst we were out in town earlier 

They are both at nursery tomorrow morning so once I&apos;ve dealt with getting them up and out of the house, I have a bit of time to myself - well at college anyway.

DH and I are just about talking now after melt down over the weekend (but he has gone to the pub again). He did stay up with DS2 last night when he woke up though, so I am grateful for that.

I have terrible memories of my mum losing her temper with me when I was little, I really don&apos;t want my children to grow up remembering my horrible shouty face.

Hello, I&apos;m still finding my dumb techniques are working (star chart and tiger cubs visualisation) - just thought I would say that because so many things I&apos;ve tried in the past have worked for a short time then stopped working.

Any thoughts on whether this is normal? - DD has some days where she seems full of hostility and I can&apos;t find a reason why. She is like me with PMT but it can&apos;t be that. She is often really horrible to DH and tells him not to look at her, talk to her or cuddle her. He asked her in a friendly, interested way this morning if she had managed to find her shoes which she was struggling to find and she snapped&quot;You can see I&apos;ve got them&quot;in a really angry voice and with a look of extreme irritation and contempt on her face. I can&apos;t see that DH does anything bad but both children seem to reject him often eg don&apos;t want to hold his hand/sit on his lap/be cuddled by him/play a game with him.

DH seems desperate for them to show they love him, would this put them off? I&apos;m wondering if they feel he is pressuring them into being with him and feel their space is invaded? DH&apos;s own Dad is someone who I think doesn&apos;t really have boundaries eg will sit next to DH with his hand on his thigh (he doesn&apos;t mean anything pervy by it but doesn&apos;t seem to realise that normal people don&apos;t think of this as normal). Is this somehow relevant to the way DH is with his own kids?

Here is a stupid example - the cat prefers me to DH but DH really wants the cat to like him so if the cat comes near him he grabs her and makes her sit on him. If the cat tries to get away he restrains the cat and the cat starts struggling and I shout at him that he can&apos;t force the cat to want to sit on him and he shouldn&apos;t restrain her. I don&apos;t try to make the cat sit on me but she is happy to (even when I don&apos;t want her there).

I don&apos;t like seeing DH get rejected but not sure how to advise him without him feeling criticised or told what to do (which he would be stubborn about).

I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve probably put this in the wrong thread but I feel kind of comfortable putting it where people&apos;know&apos;me.

What a wonderful thread! So much good advice. After dropping my nearly 5 year old girl off at school I was wondering again about why they behave so well for Nursery, Childminder and now School. And not for parents. And about when you feel all that is left seems to be to shout. And what a failure it makes you feel, and how sad and angry that they have somehow changed your own personality at that moment in time.

I suddenly found that it was past 12 noon and I was only on Oct 14. So I had to stop. My reply could easily take me hours it has been so fantastic to read everything - so far. Now I have migraine.

So, just saying hello and thank you to Bala for starting this well-overdue, for me, thread. And what brilliant mothers everybody obviously is here. One of the hardest jobs in the world, I think.

Bala - what is about you and bins! The bin - again!
storytime goes in the bin
dollies goes in the bin
so Thomas, as far as she&apos;s concerned, is in the bin but he isnt is he?
A expensive behaviour strategy!
Do you need to throw out some mental rubbish from the past - that you feel somehow that you cannot?
Not meaning to bring any more psychology into this - previous thread was more than enough! And unlikely - it seemed to me?? What do you call them - a mole or something. A non-real poster. Any truly pathological anger going on here never showed itself did it! Just politeness and maturity. Na, na, na, na, na. Sorry.

Noted a few key points today, that have helped me and I empathise with. Sorry not to know where they have all come from. Some are mine - others I noted down because I thought they were poignant and are in. Some thoughts for surverys of these children maybe - or are they just normal and we think they are more difficult? I am not trying to make them into oddities!! Synopsis and supporting points made mostly. And some questions.

Distraction yes - and Humour - Drama Queens!Not to take it all too seriously might help.

Love. If you feel deep down that you are on their side and that each day is a new one - I think there will never be any damage.

We may be looking at Relationships that last for life - since there is so much honesty here and little in the way of control. The Positive side?

Raising Girlssays that it is ok to express our angry and frustration sometimes - because it shows our children that we are human?

Including them in decsion making - but not too much

«What you should say is Thank you Mummy»

Consistency - Sticking to things/methods that you have chosen

Mimi-«She said she saves her moaning for her Mum, but what are you meant to do if you haven&apos;t got a Mum to moan to?»
Do you realise what you have said here! It is so important to this threadwe moan and take things out on our mums! The more they will take - the more we might even do it ourselves! Boundaries - or the parents will be consumed. And the child does not really want that. Cruel to be Kind!
unconditional love ? - for babies - when is it not the right message anymore though?«Love you even though you now know better?«Others wont do will they? Though you dont want them to be all-giving generous totally unselfish beings etc etc in this grabbing society. Hard to get the balance right - but we know how we want them to behave, I suppose and then they must decided the rest. Agree not conditional upon exam success!

«so self-confident, always willing to try something new and ooze independence«- children are different, children of mums here are harder work than average I think. And so more demanding. I wonder if there is an overlap between their characterisitics - and those of their parents? Lots of helpful, sensitive people on here.

karate class where she absolutely kicks ass«- has reminded me I need to sign her up!

«that sleep and routine essential for these kids«- I agree and think they probably push bedtimes later too!

Confusing world anyway - full of competition. Prizes from school starting. Mine always hates those party games where there are winners and losers. It was such a shock at first to see her, usually so extrovert and confident - sit on my knee atstatues.I cant do it. Is she right, or wrong? I shall have a clown for her 5th Birthday!

The Chocolate Saga -&quot;oh no, that&apos;s a shame, isn&apos;t it, the man has already put it through the till so we&apos;ll have to put the kinder egg back. I know you really wanted the kinder egg, too. Never mind, though, as next time we need petrol we&apos;ll come here, hey, and buy a kinder egg then - how about that?&quot;&quot;let&apos;s get it next time, would that be good?&quot;type of thing is met with a&quot;NOOOOO!!!!! I want it NOWWWW!&quot;, and then I&apos;ve just had to accept that no amount of poncey empathising is going to calm them down and we just have to get out of there pronto!

I have found this way a saviour also! Even though not every time a syou say!

«I just think he&apos;s not naturally comfy in himself having to be a toddler»I have never heard anybody else say this - but I always knew it to be the case. She was often bored before she could move her arms and legs better and do stuff.

«She always wanted to please us, so just being disappointed in her upsets her«- I hoped for that. I expected that would work for me and never raised my voice at all for the first 3 years. But - it didnt! I got the«laugh in the face»thing somebody else mentioned!

«The thing is, she is a real wee character, and very funny. dd1 comes through screaming that dd2 nipped her, so I call her, and she stamps past me, rolling her eyes, saying&quot;OK, OK, I&apos;m GOING to the naughty step!&quot;She is very hard to discipline, and sometimes I am at my wits end with her. We have the&quot;why it&apos;s wrong to hit/ scratch your sister, and she just rolls her eyes and says&quot;Well, I&apos;ve STOPPED now, haven&apos;t I? I&apos;m not doing it NOW, OK?&quot;Or she lies, blatantly, and while staring me straight in the eye: today for example&quot;I DIDN&apos;T bite her- I was just nosing her and my teeth got caught!&quot;What do you do??? So I said&quot;Biting is unacceptable in this house. AS is hitting and scratching and nasty behaviour in general. OK???&quot;And she said&quot;But what about nosing?&quot;AARGH!»

Get this kind of thing too.«An answer for everything!»kind of child.

«When it comes to my own I suppose they know which buttons to press to get me going.«Because they know we really love themand so they can? Will people just treat us as they can. Do we let them«get away with it». If they treat others differently - they know how to behave?

«They really don&apos;t see us as real human beings with our own needs, do they?!»Do we have to make them - or just wait for this?

«Sarcasm»- this is what I, sadly do, on the occassions when I get angry - about twice a month I would say - I threw the feltips on the floor this morning which is why I looked on here today - but I just got the«Answer for everything«again -«mummy youve made a mess - you shouldnt do that!»Probably didnt understand what the hell I was doing - but I got so cross seeing her put all the tops on the feltips and neatly back into their box at school - and then at home!

ActingNormal - Your two sound quite opposite children - maybe they compensate for each other a little and maybe will be quite tolerant of differences in people later in life! It was lovely to hear that your Bathtime with her and time to yourself thing worked out so well!

Katie - great posts. Art&amp;craft - Have you ever seen the French&amp;Saunders sketch where they so some babysitting with toddlers doing A&amp;C around the table! It is really funny.

AN -«Because she is so demanding I try to&apos;avoid&apos;her because I find it too much and she becomes even more demanding and we are in a vicious cycle»Been there so many times - especially with an only child maybe - but easing off a bit now she is nearly 5yrs old.

Keaau -«We have to remember they are the most precious things in the world to us and would hate to damage them in any way.»

sky dancer -«I think one key is to simply believe in your love for your child (and who hasn&apos;t had moments when you fantasise about passing them on to a good home?
This made me laugh! And I agree.»

I dont think we will if we love them. Only if there is a constant underlying dislike - usually related to transference problems - re genetics links to others that we dont like - and immaturity. They go together. That is one of the most damaging things I think. We should all be seen as individuals. Also not being harder on them for negative things that we see in ourselves. Or try to mould and change them and live through them too much. Better to want a bit of your own space then - and occassionaly lose your temper. More healthy, probably. I see none of thes problems in posters here.

Lucel -«I have perfected the silent scream - you turn away from them, open your mouth and silently scream for a few seconds until I calm down.»

Death by monkey -«Be at their level - towering over my little boy»

Other sideofthechannel -&apos;that sounds bossy, can you think of a nicer way to ask&apos;
&apos;I&apos;ll do it for you when you&apos;ve asked me politely&quot;
mimic her bossiness and then say&apos;try again in a kind voice&apos;
Silly mummy! When will I remember what a big girl DD is!&quot;
That works for me too.

Tips - get a

Hamster - absolutely great! So long as you dont lose it in the kitchen. Easy and something that they can be the«owner»of, love, transference objects in so many ways, discipline itsad to see her tell it off so gently and kindly - but then it is like those naughty DVDs behind the cushions! Not really doing anything wrong! Maybe they sometimes do see what they do like that. And getting down to their eye level is good isnt it - as stated. Harder to shout then. You will find yourself talking more. Hard to do when Knees and Back hurt though. Maybe put her/him up on the table?

Ipod - Learn a language in the Park if they still want the swing after 30minutes!

Forgiving, forgetting the bad stuff and trying again every day. Like we should do in every area of our lives.

Look forward to reading the rest of the thread. And keeping up-to-date a bit! Thanks. Hope you dont mind the re-iteration.

hey fernfrost - amazing post! hello and welcome and i do like your pretty name. it&apos;s so lovely to see that people read this thread from the beginning (massive undertaking - much respect to you ) and get so much out of it, even if not everything resonates and some of it is controversial and so on. it was really interesting to read your comments. AN - i went through a facebook addiction a while back but seem to have vanquished it for now - still on MN tho as you can see!! strange how some of us need that cyber-contact isn&apos;t it! escapism? need to reach out/feel supported through the ether as well as by those close to us in real life?
must dash but back soon. always find this thread so thought-provoking. fernfrost - will definitely look out for that french and saunders sketch by the way! a well-meaning friend showed me the (admittedly gorgeous) usborne&apos;365 things to make and do&apos;book and suggested i got it for DD for xmas - DH and i looked at each other in a&apos;yeah RIGHT&apos;way, like we want world war three to break out at ten past nine on xmas morning!! no thanks...hope you girls are all well and balanomorey - where are you, and are you okay? xxx

ps fernfrost - we have a hamster, amongst other pets - a real boon for breaking the ice with other kids when they came round to play when DD was less socialised, though she is loads better now. agree a great kiddie pet. hmm, he was launched from a playmobil catapult on one memorable occasion. and often gets driven around the carpet in a revolting fuchsia barbie car. still, survives it all with incredible aplomb and good humour. x

I&apos;ve just been watching Singing in the Rain, with ill 8 year old. He&apos;s just old enough to enjoy it at last at last, and I was thinking that burlesque or do I mean vaudeville is the answer to dealing with small children. Not irony. Just jumping in puddles and looking a bit ridiculous and singing funny songs and trying to get through rather tricky situations. Acting Normal, I hope you are feeling better. I love your tiger cubs. I sometimes do that, except I have to pretend to be the slightly annoyed Mother Tiger who is trying to sleep. My little ones are being very tiresome at the moment. Then my six year who would not let me get ready to go out last night took enormous pleasure brushing my hair Elegantly for me and that was rather nice. I was glad to get away from everyone though. My children often don&apos;t like to be overcrowded either with ref to your previous query about husband/cat.

Ok feeling much calmer this morning. In fact ranting like mad on here instantly calmed me last night. I hope I didn&apos;t upset anyone with outpouring but it sure was therapeutic for me I guessed most people writing on this thread would know the feelings and have been there themselves. I couldn&apos;t stop myself getting awfully wound up all of yesterday and couldn&apos;t prevent it showing to my DS either. He picked it all up and - very touchingly - suggested&quot;Feel better, mummy!&quot;and even&quot;Have some calpol?&quot; .

SkyDancer, thank you for sharing your feelings, it makes me feel more normal. I feel like I&apos;m having a bad couple of days and it really scares me that I might be slipping back into being a crap mother. It scares me that what if it isn&apos;t just a couple of off days like everyone has and what if it is me slipping back into being&apos;bad&apos;. When you posted about feeling really angry and at the end of your tether and then feeling a bit better again it reassures me a bit that maybe it is normal/common to feel like this sometimes and it CAN go back to being ok quickly.

I&apos;ve tried so hard to be better at it and have come up with new ways of thinking about it for myself which seemed to be working and the thought that what if this is just another thing I&apos;ve tried which doesn&apos;t work is depressing/makes me feel scared of slipping into depression.

I&apos;ve felt so tired this week (cripplingly tired) and I don&apos;t really know what I&apos;ve done to get this tired. I&apos;d feel better if I knew it was a logical kind of tiredness otherwise I think my brain might be doing this to me. I have been going to bed a bit later and going on the laptop a lot in the evenings - is this enough to make me feel so tired?

When I&apos;m tired I seem to get locked into myself and not&apos;all here&apos;in the real world. I think my children sense it as me being more distant from them and it makes them more attention seeking. I want to get through the day easily because I&apos;m so tired so every little obstacle or crying/whining/naughtiness noise and children not co-operating so I can just get things I have to do done quickly (because I don&apos;t really want to do anything when I&apos;m like this) really irritates me. I get really snappy and impatient and start telling them to get away from me and leave me alone. I then hate myself for acting like I&apos;m rejecting them (my no 1 fear anyway) and feel like I&apos;m being like my parents and failing in my job.

I feel like I&apos;ve been selfish by not making myself go to bed earlier and not be so obsessed with MN and FB because now I&apos;m too tired to do my job as a mother properly and it is hard enough when you are not tired!

This morning I felt that my behaviour could be emotionally damaging for the kids if I did it more than a tiny bit. I was ranting at DD for never being happy, always moaning about something and that I try hard with her and all I get is moaned at and I&apos;m fed up of listening to it. I muttered&quot;shut up&quot;under my breath which she probably heard. I did her teeth and hair too roughly I think. I shouted at DS for crying at every little thing.

So I&apos;m writing this to remind myself - children aren&apos;t developed enough to be grateful for what you do and in a way they shouldn&apos;t have to be because we chose to bring them into the world and chose the job of being their mother. If we persevere and keep doing the job lovingly and respectfully and try to be reasonable even when things are hard, when they are adults they will be grateful THEN that we have taught them how to be happy and how to cope in the real world and treat people and be treated with respect.

One of the things that used to make me really angry, and still crops up for me sometimes, is that I feel my children are getting so much more emotionally than I ever got and that if I had what they had I would have been SO grateful, so when they act ungrateful it makes me really angry. I have to remind myself that all children deserve to be treated lovingly and respectfully and I deserved it too even if I didn&apos;t get it. They shouldn&apos;t have to be grateful because it is what they deserve.

Because I&apos;m so locked into myself when I&apos;m tired I think I should make a specific effort to focus even more on the children. There are ways to give them attention without having to be energetic. I need to do that thing where I really look at them and notice the things I love and kind of meditate on them and then the loving feelings come accross to them. I really think this works because DD talks rubbish but if I do this and don&apos;t even listen to the drivel but look at her lovingly and listen to the feeling in her voice rather than what she is saying she seems happy with that and doesn&apos;t seem to want that much of a verbal response. It seems to make her happier than finding empty things to say like&quot;That&apos;s nice, oh really, very good&quot;in a distant voice without meaning it or even looking at her much while getting on with housework.

Something someone said on here recently occurred to me and I think is useful - visualise them when they are adult talking about what sort of a mother you were. I really don&apos;t like the thought of them saying&quot;She was always too busy or too tired or had other things on her mind to interact with us and was moody and irritable with us all the time and a bit cold and distant&quot;. This is what they would say if I behaved like this morning all the time and this is how I think of my parents who I was determined not to become!!!

Going to get DD from school now, will see if I can do the things I said.

Hi
What a lot has gone on since I last looked in...have been unable to log on for a while as we have had pesky viruses on our PC which has taken a while for us computer illiterate pair to sort out....hope no-one&apos;s been logging on as me in my absence!!

So much to read - this thread is amazing and such a support.

My last post was very positive.....not had such a good few weeks since though...maybe I&apos;ve been missing the strength of support of this thread and the reality check it gives you.

Feel like crying today (and have been ) because I can&apos;t get away from the feeling that my shouting has got inside dd&apos;s brain and that I&apos;ve moulded her into some sort of paranoid little soul who is waiting for the next shouty moment to come. She can&apos;t take any sort of reprimand at all - through the snot and the tears I hear over and over&apos;I don&apos;t like it when you shout at me&apos;&amp;&apos;why do you shout at me&apos; . How I wish I could turn back the clock to when the short fuse manifested itself (about 2 yrs ago) and change my behaviour - the satisfaction I have had from motherhood over that time has been pretty low...am I beating myself up too much? Maybe, sigh! I just want to feel happy with myself as a mum and I so don&apos;t again at the moment. Today, I have said some awful things to dd - eg&apos;get out of my sight and go to nannys (dh has just taken her so I can have some space). Been winding me up all day - doing the exact opposite of what I ask, challenging me everytime I say&apos;No&apos;and just being a pain in the arse making me feel I&apos;d like to be a million miles away from her today as I&apos;m so fed up. Also she&apos;s not been sleeping well, so I guess we are both tired (was awake with her last night from 3-5 and din&apos;t manage to get back to sleep til it was nearly time to get up again. She also said something to me that makes me think that she believes I like my own space too much at her expense - I&apos;m too upset to say what she said but it made me cry to think my own child might be feeling rejected by me which can only be a result of my behaviours. ..no amount of telling her how much I love her has made me feel any better about that (and I love her so much it hurts)

I need to re-read this thread and get myself back on the even keel I was feeling a few weeks ago. Don&apos;t know why I&apos;ve slipped back...PMT definately plays a part - anyone else in this boat? I get p&apos;d off just before i come on and exactly mid cycle too...not blaming it all on hormones, but they do have a lot to answer for!

Hope all you girls have a good day tomorrow - onwards and upwards! Bless you all for posting....the support and non judgemental attitude is a godsend. x.

PS Fernfrost - please be reassured I don&apos;t have a thing for the bin due to trying to offload any emotional baggage - it&apos;s purely a tool to teach dd a lesson. By the way, the things don&apos;t actually get thrown out. I keep the things hidden and when dd has had a good run of behaviour, I&apos;ll dig something back out from it&apos;s hiding place and tell her I rang the bin man to tell him she&apos;d been a good girl and he got it back out of the bin and brought it back for her !

Thanks Acting Normal and Katiek for your supportive words. I realise I&apos;m extremely stressed right now with immanent house move, back going out (painful, debilitating - and bad timing!) plus the other things I mentioned. Interesting how normal toddler behaviour just seems unbearable when stress levels have gone up. Good to hear from you and balanomorey again but don&apos;t really have ability to respond just now. So glad this thread here though

Hi All, just checked in to see lots of new posts. Welcome Fernfrost Glad you are finding it helpful.

Skydancer- hormones do play havoc with my patience levels. I find it helps to acknowledge this to myself, as it makes me realise things will change, as the hormones fluctuate.

Katiek- thanks for making me LOL, at the image of your DD&apos;s hamster speeding around in a fuscia Barbie car. Your DD sounds such a character. 

Acting Normal- as usual I read your post nodding away thinking I could have written that, especially the bit about Face Book. I had a brief obsession with it this week. Just lurked on ex-boyfriends and DC&apos;S teacher&apos;s sites. then got paranoid when I thought they all might be able to see I&apos;d been stalking them 
I think you are a fantastic parent AN. You are so insightful and thoughtful, and it is clear you prioritise your children&apos;s needs. I am sure there are few people as self reflective as you are. Your DC are very, very fortunate to have a Mum who considers their needs, and the impact of her own behaviour on her DC. Not only do you do this for your DC, but you have helped me immensely in thinking about how I deal with my DC. I loved your idea of just quietly observing the DC, without talking. I tried it and it works.
Must go for now as the DC are loose with acrylic paints in the kitchen and could do with some supervision or every surface will be covered with a cloggy mix of brown paint. 
See you all later

Mimizan, thank you so much for saying the words you said. It feels like you&apos;ve given me a gift! It encourages me.

It feels so reassuring when people say similar things to what you have said/what you were thinking because you don&apos;t feel so alone and don&apos;t feel so&apos;mad&apos;. I love this thread.

I feel like I know what I need to do now (with lots of ideas from this thread and ideas that have evolved from thinking about what people have said) but I don&apos;t always do it. I need to practice and practice doing it and get myself back on track every time I feel I have slipped a bit. It sounds like a few of you are in this position and that we all slip a bit at different times eg when tired, got PMT, illness, extra stresses etc.

I just don&apos;t want to go back to how I was permanently and every time I feel a bit bad or don&apos;t do so well with the children I feel this could happen and it feeds the&apos;depression&apos;(or whatever it is).

hello girls, hello mimi . can you please all go out immediately and get fitted with a mirena coil so you no longer have PMT - what a nightmare - i feel for you. (when i had it fitted i ignored instructions to wait in the clinic for a further 20 minutes, and felt faint and sick halfway round the ringroad home.had to veer the car into a hotel and collapse onto their reception carpet. they liked that a lot - great for business, obviously. plus i really enjoyed explaining what had happened to a 19 yr-old member of staff from my position at his bootlevel too.
so anyway PMT is one thing i have never had, even pre-mirena, though god knows i&apos;ve behaved as if i had ... DD on the other hand already has it, years before the onset of puberty ...no time to write much more than the trivial drivel above, just checking in. lovely to read you all and i agree with mimizan AN, you frequently astonish me with the extent to which you analyse your situation and your relationship with your little ones. you are doing a fab job. mimi- LOL at you stalking your DC&apos;s teachers on FB - obviously i have steadily worked through my ex&apos;s already but hadn&apos;t thought of that one - thanks for the tip! see you at the next national stalkers&apos;convention xxx ps balano it&apos;s so nice to get an update and i am so sorry it&apos;s still so tough. will come back and write less frivolously soon x

Katiek do you know of any good alternative for PMT (other than mirena coil)? I have never liked the idea of a coil for various reasons (though got to admit I was tempted by your description - despite the fainting episode in a hotel after fitting lol. AN yes you do sound one of the most reflective and caring parents I know - you always come up with gems on here.

Balanomorey I just wanted to say keep on trucking - it does sound like a bad patch. I hear what you are saying about being sad that your DD expects and fears you shouting at her and how you wish you hadn&apos;t created this. At the same time when I read you I wondered - just wondered - if your DD has learned rather extreme ways to get your full emotional attention/remorse response and it is now more of a habit, even a&apos;power&apos;she has. ??? I may be wrong but I am aware that if someone feels bad about themselves they are more vulnerable to being criticised in the area they feel most sensitive about (and I think children are highly sensitive to their parents and not always so angelic/incapable of unconscious manipulation. It might just be part of the equation.

Mimizan/Katiek Stalking. LOL Must give it a whirl.

hello sky! well, you&apos;re either looking at hormonal manipulation (mirena coil, depo-provera contraceptive injection, mini- or combined pill - and pills not fool-proof in this regard) which many of us aren&apos;t especially keen on once we hit our late thirties and beyond, or if things are very bad indeed you&apos;re looking at anti-depressants (prozac is licensed for being taken just for two weeks a month leading up to your period, if PMT is very severe) but that&apos;s again a little OTT for most of us!...or you&apos;ve got all the usual herbal suspects, evening primose oil vitamin b etc etc which i am sure you must have tried ad nauseam. exercise of course too. or you could try homeopathy which is what i would do in your position, as gentle, nothing to lose etc. i have seen some good results. i also struggle to see any results at all sometimes, but the one area i have had (modest...am a beginner!) success in is hot flushe in the menopause and other female hormonal complaints, so worth a try i reckon. BUT so bloody difficult to get right (IMHO) that best to consult a good homeopath and get your history taken well rather than going for something over the counter. mind you i&apos;m not sure spanish massively keen on it so might be hard to find someone good over there? i remember in portugal being looked at like i was a crazed lunatic when asking for a homeopathic remedy in a lisbon pharmacy and i have a feeling spain the same? must go feed the monsters their breakfast! have a lovely day everyone x

ah, balano - i just re-read you and feel like giving you a big&lt;&lt;hig&gt;&gt;. er,&lt;&lt;hug&gt;&gt;, though you can have a&lt;&lt;hig&gt;&gt;too, why not, that&apos;s the kinda girl i am . can you please arrange to have a solid two days off by yourself or visiting a dear friend or a sister or someone in that vein? you so, so, SO need a break. you would come back re-energised i am sure. sleep clearly makes a huge difference here, as it always has to my relationship with my feisty DD. i once got sent off for a week back to the UK (when we were in Oz) BY MYSELF in the midst of our worse, most snot-and-tears-strewn period to see a load of people i love and to recharge my batteries - god it did me good. i think DD and i used to get locked into a terrible mutually inflammatory cycle of negativity and angst and it was so hard to shake ourselves out of - especially when you threw in chronic sleep deprivation and, in my case, homesickness, insecurity over the future and a rocky patch with a largely absent, off-at-work DH. sigh. your post takes me back to those hard times in an instant. what can i say, balano - in time, she went to school, she started to enjoy life more, she thrived on the structure and stimulation school brought, she learned to read (o BLESSED DAY!!!), she became more self-controlled, she learned to make friends. all of these things seemed light years away when she was three however! be kind to yourself. remember how many good times there are too with your DD. these will gradually greatly outnumber the bad i am SURE. take heart. we&apos;re all thinking about you xxx

Hi katie - thanks for your post 

To have a total break for a few days would be so lovely - but not really possible at the moment. Too much to do at this time of the year and so little time left to do it all!! DH has promised me a little break on our own early next year so am sticking out for that!!

We are off out tonight for a meal with friends, so dd will be going to nannies overnight, so at least we can stumble in, crash out and know that for sure tonight, we will have a whole undisturbed night!! Bliss!

Tho, to be fair, since I posted on Thurs, dd slept all through Thurs night and Fri - maybe she read my post!! Have really been instilling in her how important it is to be a big girl and that if she wakes, to just turn over and go back off to sleep by herself. Have even been bribing her with choc as a breakfast option ! Think it&apos;s all to do with fear of the dark creeping in a bit - it&apos;s hard to leave your child crying when you know they are a bit uneasy in their bed for whatever reason hence the in and out for hours til she finally drops off again.

The last few days have been more postivie - Thurs was another wake up call - what she said cut me to the core - my mum was quite shocked when I told her what she had said and when pressed did say that in her opinion, I shout a bit more that maybe I should - I love my mum, she is so supportive and helpful and I have that to be grateful for as without her, It&apos;d be so much harder.

So, yet again, I have woken up to the reality of my behaviour - imo, unacceptable. I have to discipline and be in charge, but not in such a bad tempered way. I&apos;m going to try my utmost to tame the shouting.

Hope you all have great weekends! x.

Katiek so helpful. Have decided to try the herbal routes first a I remember now you write that stuff that I used to take a combo of cod liver oil and evening primrose for joint problems and it helped with those - but also I seemed on a more even keel emotionally and wondered if those supplements were helping. If that doesn&apos;t help I&apos;ll try acupuncture (I have a friend who does it) and go from there...

Also your words to Balanomorey talking about the hardest time for you and when things got easier with your DD (reading, school etc) really helped me in terms of getting a longer term perspective. So much is like emergency coping when children are pre-3 or 4- no? I&apos;ve already taught my Ds how to say the alphabet but I tell you reading is going to come next whether he&apos;s only two or not... . Only kidding - I know it&apos;s another few years but I&apos;ll put my best teacher&apos;s hat on occasionally nevertheless, looking forward to those reading years.

BM, sorry if what I wrote before was inappropriate to your situation and the fact is you had simply been shouting too much! I&apos;m glad to hear things have eased off a bit anyway and you have little breaks coming up. Neither of my parents are alive now and sometimes I do feel wistful about how it might have been with gramps on the scene. I think as a general thing parents in nuclear families are too isolated and it adds a lot to the strains/demands.

Hi all&amp;Hi to you Skydancer. So glad that, as ever, katie&apos;s words of wisdom are helping you and hope that you find the thing that makes you feel better

In no way did I feel what you wrote was inappropriate - I should have acknowledged that in my last post! Thank you for taking the time to put another perspective on the situation. It was food for thought and i think I do analyse myself too much in front of dd to check her reactions and how she feels when i do shout - eg I will say&apos;is mummy happy or sad now&apos;after we&apos;ve had a ding dong - instead of just letting it go. Maybe she is, as a result, very aware of what pushes my buttons and has learned to pick up on my moods too much as we talk about it a lot. I do think I need to move on quickly from an outburst and not overanalyse, especially in dd&apos;s presence and with her little bit of input and take on the situation, which frankly, at 3 isn&apos;t probably worth dwelling on too much.
Thanks for posting and hope you have a lovely Sunday! x.

Thanks balanomory and I&apos;m glad you had been able to relate to what I wrote before. I&apos;m in the middle of packing boxes at the moment as we&apos;re moving house after xmas - so it is stressful in a different way but trying to keep everything at a reasonably sane and steady pace. I think DS is unsettled by seeing so much changing before his eyes but at the same time reassured by our positive attitude to it (plus we&apos;ve explained fully about moving and that all our things will reappear in the new place). So far - fingers crossed - no major upsets about it.

Hi all
Something I did this morning really made my brain jolt!!! To see what I&apos;m like when I&apos;m angry from dd&apos;s perspective, I ranted into the mirror like I do when I go off on one at dd.....not a pretty sight and quite upsetting, I&apos;m sure, for a little one to witness . This I hope, is another tool, like the imaginary future conversation, that will stop me in my tracks when I feel a full on rant welling up. My mantra is&apos;calm, collected but still firm mummy - not angry ranty mummy....I really didn&apos;t like what I saw in the mirror . Just thought I&apos;d share that with you, maybe it might help you too. x.

I didn&apos;t realize this thread was still going. It fell off my list Will try to do a proper catching up but I really feel I should stay with it. Ds1 gets me going so often. He gets really silly and giggly when we are trying to get ready for school, bed etc. - always when I feel pressured or tired and I just feel so frustrated!

I&apos;m afraid I lost it a bit yesterday. . We were madly preparing for DS1&apos;s birthday party. He was as high as a kite and managed to pull his bedroom door off it&apos;s hinges.My DSs can be very destructive and it does get me down when DH and I have to spend lots of time and money fixing their breakages. Anyway I did lots of shouting about how ungrateful they are, and how I wouldn&apos;t have dared destroy things when I was a child.
Later as we were piling DS and his friends into the car to take them to the party at the local leisure centre, my rather pious neighbour with one DD, came out of her house with some friends, and I felt like she was saying&apos;yes that&apos;s her, the banshee you heard screaming earlier&apos; 
I think it was Acting Normal who once said she felt jealous of all the things her DC get she missed as a child. I think this applies to me with my DC, I want their birthdays to be so perfect, that I get myself completely stressed, the DC act out then I snap because I think they are spoilt brats. I need to break this cycle somehow.
I dread to think what I must have looked like in the mirror, as you said Balanomorey.

Skydancer, I hope you&apos;re packing is going well. It&apos;s sounds like you are staying calm.

Balano, I love that mirror thing! I will add it to my list of useful childcare stuff (Yes, I am sad, I cut and paste useful stuff from this thread into a document so I can re-read it). I find the things&apos;real world mothers&apos;say on here much more useful than any published childcare manual!

Mimizan, I can see how anyone would lose their temper if that happened to them! I don&apos;t think you should feel too guilty! I know what you mean about getting carried away with your plans for them and trying to make it the best it can be but getting stressed by it, I sometimes get&apos;obsessive&apos;about plans as well. I was just thinking about the fact that children are often really happy and pleased by the simplest of things so long as they are getting a nice bit of loving attention. You don&apos;t have to&apos;bust a gut&apos;to feel like you are being a good mother (although I admire people who do big parties).

I came on here to write about mornings. (I&apos;m not nice in the mornings). A few weeks ago I started getting up a bit earlier and although I find this really hard I did it by telling myself that I would enjoy taking my time to do breakfast and get the children ready to take DD to school in a calm and relaxed manner while having the odd sip of a nice cup of coffee. It worked for a while but I&apos;m feeling so tired at the moment that it&apos;s been slipping and I&apos;ve been getting up later.

Anyway, the point is that when I feel rushed and anxious I can&apos;t talk to the children when they come up to me with their drivel and I tell them to go away and not talk to me and then hate myself for rejecting them. I get on their cases over every little thing and nag and nag and shout and rant because I&apos;m anxious that little things are going to make us later and later for school. DH said to me this morning&quot;Don&apos;t be horrible to the DCs, you know it is your own fault for not getting up earlier&quot;. He is so right and I&apos;m so glad he reminded me.

I think this happens a lot to people. They feel anxious or rushed or preoccupied with worries that extra things, like children being difficult, make you snap at them and be impatient with them and have no time for them. I just read in a childcare manual I was re-reading that the thing children want the most is your time. It made me feel guilty and I keep saying it to myself now&quot;they want your time, they don&apos;t care if you have done all the housework&quot;.

I used to dread being in the house with the children, it actually scared me. So I took them out all the time. I took them to do lots of activities with other people, which on the face of it, looks good and looks like I made an effort, and it was good for them in some ways (lots of stimulation and social contact), but the truth of it was I was avoiding being with them. I didn&apos;t spend time myself really interracting with them, I provided other children for them to play with and I wanted to be with their mothers to ease my loneliness and ignore my kids as much as possible. I find this shocking now but didn&apos;t at the time. We still go out a lot but now do stuff on our own as well instead of me either ignoring them and doing housework/whatever I want at home or taking them out and ignoring them because they have their friends to play with.

Writing that I&apos;m thinking it&apos;s no wonder they acted&apos;demanding&apos;and attention seeking or misbehaved just to get some attention! I&apos;m wondering if mine aren&apos;t so much born demanding as being that way because they want more of me and I was distant/preoccupied/locked inside my own head/depressed/too anxious/tired/unhappy about things to cope, for ages, a couple of years! Now I&apos;m feeling better I look back on it and see that I must have been ill. I don&apos;t think I would be feeling better if I hadn&apos;t gone to therapy. It scares me that what if I hadn&apos;t made that firm decision to get therapy at last and get it all sorted. Now my thoughts are straightened out I&apos;m not so preoccupied and&apos;not really here&apos;.

I feel so exhausted lately (and not pregnant or anything) that I&apos;m finding it hard to get up in the mornings and harder to do everything. I want to remind myself that we MUST look after ourselves really well (not just the bare minimum) so that we are well enough to be good mothers! It is hard enough to do this job when you are completely well!

I think my tiredness is because I&apos;m on the laptop all the time and can&apos;t stop to go to bed early. I never switch off and properly relax. I feel like I want to spend every spare moment doing something I want to do and not waste any time. But then I waste time by being too exhausted to do anything.

Maybe I can use a similar technique to mornings - make myself want to go to bed earlier by visualising myself enjoying being with the children and giving them time as well as getting everything done and being able to do this because I feel rested and awake enough.

Sorry for going on and on, I work things out as I write.

Acting normal I do that thing of taking kids out for activities all the time so as not to be in the house with them. Well I used to, now I&apos;m trying really hard like you to be inside with them and interact with them. It&apos;s exhausting though. I find the computer stops me from relaxing also, I&apos;m sleep so much better when I&apos;ve not looked at it all evening. So glad I&apos;m not alone.

hello everyone - AN i find my sleep SO much better if i do about 20 - 30 mins meditation before bed - just breathing in and out and trying to clear my mind of all the restless mental frenzy we all are prone to during waking hours! might be worth a try? i think it&apos;s great you got therapy and find it so helpful. please don&apos;t beat yourself up too much about all the going out and hanging out with other people you did with the DCs - when i spend time with friends on the continent (france and belgium) it&apos;s amazing how little they see of their kids i can tell you - there is so much full-time school/activities after school from an early age there and their DCs are in permanent holiday clubs during school hols. and they (the DCs) seem to thrive on it all by the way!
much more to write but DS needing attention(!!) as home from school&apos;ill&apos;(actually just shattered after a long school term i reckon, and needing a holiday )

ps mimi - totally understand why you got so mad. nothing makes me see red like a perceived lack of appreciation/gratitude in my DCs for all that they have, compared to so many others. AN and i have discussed this before too, i seem to remember! argh argh argh. hope things have settled down! x
and sky - GOOD LUCK with the house move! my kids have moved so often they now think it&apos;s a bit weird that we intend to stay in our current house indefinitely (like we have any other option in the current economic climate ...but we&apos;re happy here which is just as well) - they had four moves in four years. yikes. the least disruptive aspect was always the new home though - they found that really exciting and settled in really quickly each time. it was the change in routine and school that upset poor DD each time so much (DS impervious fortunately) but sounds like in your case it&apos;s just the house? hope it all goes smoothly anyway x

Hi
i can empathise with the feeling p&apos;d off at making a huge effort - which then goes unappreciated.....had that experience this afternoon!

Bought dd some lovely disney princess Xmas cards and some Xmas stamps (the inky kind!) so she could send her little friends some Xmas greetings. Like others have mentioned, I too aren&apos;t too keen on spending endless hours in the house, so like to be out and about, but this afternoon I thought, no, I&apos;ll spend some quality time and do the Xmas cards with dd - thought she&apos;d love it 

I was writing the name and the love and kisses bit (a bit beyond dd being only 3)...except she wanted to do it. Tried to explain that she was a bit young for writing yet as she dosn&apos;t know her ABC..so she had a strop and threw the stampers on the floor. I immediately yelled (mostly due to the panic that the carpet would get inky), she flounced off in tears....so what I thought would be a lovely bit of mummy, dd time together ended up, yet again, with me yelling and her sobbing .

I did think, why do I bother? But through all this, we have to cling on to the fact that they are CHILDREN, not mature people.,,why is it you can always rationalise after the event...and then the guilt creeps in. Somedays I feel trapped in a bubble of disquiet - it keeps happening, despite my best intentions and endeavours. It&apos;s like my brain is programmed to shout whenever dd plays up and I can&apos;t change it, no matter how I try ..is there any hope? I feel so dispondent. Sorry for the negative post. x....just keep on trying, I guess. x.

Well today I feel like a Class A bitch. Had a horrendous day at work- had to do a presentation in front of loads of people, so felt very nervous and stressed. Got home after my usual 1.5 hour commute, picked up dd from nursery and was literally unable to cope with all her whining. As soon as we got in the door she starting moaning, demanding chocolate, cbeebies etc. Tried so hard to be calm but just couldnt take it. Had been up since 5.30 am and after my stressful day at work, literally just wanted 5 mins peace and quiet. DD of course had her own ideas and in the end I ended up raising my voice to her. She responded&quot;please dont shout at me mummy, please&quot;which made me feel just awful. Why cant I control myself? DH of course is out for the evening enjoying himself and I feel the weight of responsibility. Tried to make it up to DD by reading extra bedtime stories but even then she was annoying me, refusing to brush her teeth, refusing to put her pyjamas on, refusing to get into bed and so on. Sometimes I feel like just packing in work and signing on, I literally cannot cope with the stress of working and looking after dd, but for gods sake I only work 3 days a week, I have no excuse, especially when loads of mums are working fullitme. What the hell is wrong with me??

Thanks Katie! I just wish I could remain calm. DD is only 3 and shouldnt have to ask her mother to stop shouting at her!! Have been sitting here feeling guilty and wishing I was a better mother. When DD and I spend the day together I can generally cope better with her tantrums than when I get in from work so I think it is a tiredness/stress thing. Oh well only another 2 days to go... Believe it or not I used to work a 4 day week on top of my daily 3 hr commute so I shouldnt really complain now...!!!

Katiek is absolutely right. People tend to forget that historically there were lots of extended family to help out with childcare while parents worked - whether that was in or out of the home. We are doing so much more without help these days 

I love the ranting in the mirror idea! I haven&apos;t actually done it yet, but just the thought of what I must look like has made me stop and count to 3 today.

I have started writing a diary of how and who my DS is because i realise he&apos;s changing so fast and I always seem to forget the previous stage/s so quickly. Aside from an aid to memory I&apos;m not sure why I&apos;m doing it. Is it for me to help focus on all the lovely, adorable aspects and excitement of development and learning - and his character forming? Is it also to help me focus on and be reminded of all the more enjoyable aspects of being his mum and not just the tussles, exhaustion, exasperation, isolation, limited nature of life&apos;s routines? If I manage to keep it up it occurred to me that it might be something he would like to read one day. A bit like a positive version of that&apos;mirror&apos;idea, or imaging speaking to your DC about their childhood years hence (which I think is a good idea by the way!). Just some thoughts shared....

Thanks for all your supportive words. 
It really does help having you all to have a rant to, knowing that you will not be judged harshly.
LosingIt- It sounds like you are doing an amazing job keeping all those balls in the air. I admire mums who juggle work and childcare. Did it myself for 6 years, but found it really stressful when I had my third DC. I can still feel the exhaustion of getting home with 2 DC in the dark, to find the breakfast dishes still out with tea to prepare. No wonder you feel snappy.

well dont think I am doing to well at juggling all the balls Mimizan, as almost lost it again today after another day at work, long commute home etc. I have begged dh if he can try and pick dd up from nursery at least one night a week as I just feel overwhelmed by it all. Work is a nightmare at the moment and I&apos;m feeling so stressed about it all that I couldnt even eat my dinner (which is so unlike me!) sitting here with chocolate and wine trying to feel better, but already dreading the long day ahead tomorrow.

Mimizan- 6 years is a long time, am v impressed. Get a bit envious of women who have help from their family in terms of childcare etc. I&apos;m surrounded by family but dont think its ever crossed their mind to help me out now and again...

I totally sympathise. my ds is just 2 and extremely contrary, almost sarcastic and very challenging. He will hover his hand 1 cm above the panic alarm [it was already installed - I did not put it in!!] mocking me saying&quot;mummy says no, no touching etc etc ....&quot;. One tries to stay cool but after a few hours of this continual behaviour I also just screamed at him. Of course felt terrible and cried myself [away from him] thinkin what terrible emotional harm I had inflicted on him. I am trying to count to ten etc etc but very hard indeed to control temper

Hi babybarrister, sorry you&apos;re finding it upsetting with your Ds. do you have any ideas what sets him off into being so oppositional (as I presume it&apos;s not a constant)? I wondered because I am spotting more triggers in terms of what sets my ds off.

We&apos;re in the throws of moving at the moment and a lot of energy, attention and activity has been diverted away from my ds. It&apos;s also unsettling for him to see constant change in his environment I think and his behaviour is reflecting this at times. It&apos;s not that we&apos;re ignoring him by any means and still playing with/reading, taking him out to park - more or less sticking to all routines and really trying to include him as much as possible. But on an ego level he knows he&apos;s not the centre of the universe at the moment (at least not on the superficial levels!) and he&apos;s acting up trying to get that attention back and that seems to include punishing us. Last night he did about 10&apos;naughty&apos;or dangerous things one after the other, including drawing on the furniture, throwing food and drink on the floor, pouring water liberally out of his bath, trying to stick metal objects in plug sockets and other electrical equipment etc Messing with the oven. etc.(all things he knows not to do and knows will provoke a reaction). When either me or my dp shouted in panic at what he was doing or even told him off fairly mildly he would then be in floods of tears and need endless consoling. This is not normal. It seems sometimes that just when you have most desire or need to concentrate elsewhere, are preoccupied, stressed, needing TLC yourself that toddlers decide to go wild and on the war path!

Hi Skydancer-I&apos;m still here. Could have written your last but one post. However it would have been about my 9 year old not my toddler. He&apos;s quite ill really and worn out from a long term at school, but boy has he been pushing the boundaries. Dh and I are exhausted.

Christmas can a difficult time for families. The DC get whipped up into a state of frenzy with all the excitement. They are then exhausted, don&apos;t get enough sleep, then misbehave. Parents get stressed out trying to create the perfect christmas, then have to deal with all the difficult behaviour from their DC. This is my experience anyway.

Obviously there are enjoyable bits too. I really love getting stuff together for the DCs&apos;stockings, and watching them open them is even better.

How&apos;s everyone else getting on?

Oh, I am busy renewing my vow to stop shouting I ranted so much at dd1 the other night, I nearly lost my voice . We have introduced a rather complicated points system, which seems to be working a bit (but not sure if it is just down to novelty value atm!) and I have introduced a&quot;no-shouting&quot;rule- which includes DH and me as well. Unfortunately, as many of you have said, I find mornings and dinner-time/ school pick up time very stressful. Having to be somewhere at a set time is something I loathe. And to make matters worse, ds (13mths) has gone from a lovely smiley baby to a truculent toddler, who roars and cries at the drop of a hat and wants picked up all the time- at the most inopportune moments, which makes my fuse a lot shorter with the girls 

But I am trying! [hopeful emoticon] One day I will be a lovely calm and serene mum

hello girls
oh yes...i still shudder at the memory of xmas day last year - we spent it at my in-laws, who told us their system was not to open presents until after lunch, much to the kids&apos;appalled horror! a nightmareish 5 hours then ensued, as i was on&apos;DD-containment duty&apos;- a painful and tense time! hoping for better things this year (and waking up in our own house on xmas day, which should help masses!)
back soon - nursing a cold, so off to bed. spent a chunk of today trying to instil the embryonic beginnings of a social conscience in the kids (ever the optimist ) by getting them to write a card each to a political prisoner of their choice (from an amnesty leaflet) which was...interesting! led to some good discussions at any rate. trying to explain dictatorship and the concept of&apos;prisoners of conscience&apos;to a 5 and 7 yr old was challenging to say the least

Wow Katiek, you must have a lot of energy, encouraging your DC to write letters to prisoners, especially when you are feeling under the weather. However I probably used up more energy refereeing for the DSs while they were on the PC, and dealing with their strops.&lt;&lt;makes note to find 2 suitable prisoners of conscience for the DSs to correspond with&gt;&gt; 

Acting normal- I am sure christmas is stressful for most parents, unless they are loaded financially, and have lots of positive family support. (I just wanted an excuse to see what that smiley looks like)

I got so angry at ds1 yesterday I was beside myself I was ringing handbells at church for the Christmas program. I brought him with me for second service - he wanted to come and has done so before. I put a little chair behind me (I&apos;m on the back row) so that he could watch us play from there. Halfway through the piece I noticed out of the corner of my eye that the chair was empty Not only had he gotten up he was crawling around on the floor under the tables of handbell ringers and at one point halfway up the stairs to the pulpit area I was absolutely mortified. I managed to get him home and then told him to go to his room. I just had him stay in there for an hour or so. He&apos;s 5 years old and certainly should know better

DH and i had a rapid discussion and arranged a swat-team-esque swoop on my friend&apos;s house to retrieve him. he was devastated, but it was an effective punishment (for once...not usually my specialty ).
better start work...x

thanks katie, it will be a bit long but I just don&apos;t know what of our history contributes to the way ds is and how much he would be this way anyway iykwim.
So ds was born 4 years ago with a bowel condition. I won&apos;t go into intricate detail but over the next 18months he had surgery, weekly blood tests, severe reflux, extreme difficulty in processing solid food, xrays, barium meals, constipation, a great deal of pain, motor delays (did not roll until 10months)and food and environmental allergies, he was failure to thrive (surprise surprise) He also had extreme reactions to immunisations and we have chosen not to complete the immunisation schedule at this stage. He breastfed every two hours around the clock as he needed small and often and he cried (screamed pretty much all day long) In the two and a half years since then things have still been quite intense and needless to say we have a four year old now who is very, very sensitive to anything intrusive such as hairwashing, nailcutting, baths, clothing, touch, hairbrushing, haircutting, temperature, noise, etc. He has a very high need to control his environment and everyone in it. He has very unusual play skills and almost no ability to entertain himself. He still has difficulty with sleeping, he still has environmental allergies, he has great trouble in seperating from me and has only in the last few months started to cope with being left with dad, grandparents and childminder without a major reaction. We are very much in the camp of positive parenting and attachment parenting but to be honest it has been trial and error with ds as he couldn&apos;t co sleep as his sensitivity to touch meant that all hell broke loose if you brushed against him, we don&apos;t shout (or to be honest we very rarely shout but I have been driven to it on occasion), we don&apos;t smack. We have plenty of positive experiences and feedback for him. We try to be very accepting of who he is without being permissive of inappropriate behaviour. We believe we are very united, consistent and firm about our boundaries but even so we have
daily
Kicking, biting, shouting, name calling, punching, throwing of items etc. Just for completeness sake I will also share that I am 21 wks pregnant (I will admit to feeling dreadfully bad about this now as I think it is unfair on almost everyone...on ds as I don&apos;t think he will cope, on the baby who I shouldn&apos;t be subjecting to the way things are, on DH as he has enough to deal with, on me as I&apos;m not sure I am up to the challenge of two when I can&apos;t even manage one)

katiek what a marvelous memory you have! Yes, ds1 has sensory processing disorder and it sounds like your ds is a prime candidate for that diagnosis. We did not know what it was until he was four and were just trying to deal with it on our own. Then I read a book called the Highly Sensitive Child. What an awakening!! I got him to an occupational therapist who diagnosed SPD and got him started on a therapy program. She recommended that we read the Out of Sync Child which gave some great recommendations of things we could do at home. I would highly recommend that you take him in for an evaluation. It can make such a difference. Ds1 is still a handful but we have managed to get him desensitized to some things and life is not quite as stressful. It is an ongoing thing of course.

The other thing is not to feel guilty about having another child. My dh was not at all supportive of having a second child but ds2 has been the best thing that has happened to our family - especially ds1 It has also been nice for me to experience being a mother to an NT child.

Oh, and we have bowel issues here too so I can sympathize. Ds1 has not needed surgery but has had 3 fecal impactions and undergone colon rehabilitation over the last 2 years which really put a strain on us, especially on top of his other issues. For some reason bowel issues and hypersensitivity and/or autism frequently go together.

ooh jabberwocky you are a star - i hoped you&apos;d come back soon. it does sound like you and yawningmonster have a lot in common with what you&apos;ve been through. must dash - school pick-up looming - but read you both with much interest - and sympathy. my child is definitely in the&apos;highly sensitive&apos;category but nothing like what you both describe. and i just about broke down in her earlier years, life was so tough! DD was born ten weeks early and her first two years were festooned with (respiratory) illness which was a rollercoaster in itself. so i only have partial insight, but enough to know that daily life is exceedingly challenging with these children, fantastic though they are in so many ways. you both have my respect, in spades. back later x

Hey all have been following this thread and have found it incredibly useful. I hope you don&apos;t mind if I vent a bit, feel like I will explode if I don&apos;t and need some non-judgemental people to listen.

The past 2 days at home with dd have been bloody horrendous. Quite frankly I don&apos;t know how I&apos;ve got through the day. Does the pure mundaneness of looking after a toddler drive anyone else mad? I am emotionally and physically wrecked. In the past hour I have had&quot;mummmmmmmmy&quot;screamed at me 34 times, have made 3 drinks, provided 2 snacks, taken dd to the toilet 2 times, completed a jigsaw and helped dd with some drawing and painting. I absolutely know that as her mother it is my job to cater to her every need, but bloody hell it&apos;s boring. I feel like a domestic drudge without even 5 minutes to myself. I am at the beck and call of a 3 year old who cannot entertain herself for 5 minutes.

I am counting down the minutes until her bedtime so I can have a cup of tea and just do nothing. It doesn&apos;t help I suppose that dh is out again and today was my works christmas party but of course cant get a babysitter, so am probably feeling sorry for myself.

Find it all so depressing, it doesnt help that dd has been in a whiny mood all day, not her fault, shes probably picked up on her miserable cow of a mother...

Vent away! Fwiw 3 was definitely ds1&apos;s worst year. He was no problem as a two year old so I thought I had it made Could you try to start having her do some things on her own? We have juice boxes and a little box of mommy-approved snacks at the bottom of the pantry. Even if you have to help open the package etc. it&apos;s nice to say&quot;Well, go help yourself in the pantry, mommy&apos;s busy right now&quot; It can be incredibly stressful, boring and unfulfilling ime. Also remember, if you give a difficult/demanding child an inch she&apos;ll take a mile! Hand her some crayons and paper and tell her to go draw for 20 minutes (while mummy has a G&amp;T, lol)

katiek, can&apos;t imagine dealing with respiratory issues for 2 years. I&apos;ve had a tiny dose of breathing machine, etc and it&apos;s tough! Glad things are better in that respect. And you remind me I need to get back on the meditation thread. Still have not found a regular time to practice but it does help at night when I take the time.

hi thank you everyone. I have called for an assessment with a child psychologist. The catalist was actually at playgroup this morning when another mum came up to me and said very discretely that she was a child psychologist and did I feel that I needed more support with ds. I said oh hell yes and she said that at playgroup she wears her mum hat not her psychologist hat but that she thought it would benefit us both to go for an assessment.

arrrgghhh I know from other threads I am handling ds all wrong but I am really trying. Today I took him to the Santa Grotto with his gran and he was fantastic and I told him so. He wanted to stop at the park on the way home so I said yes. Park has a large lake in middle and ds wanted to run around the lake on his own and I said no he couldnt but he could run ahead a bit. Anyway he stomped and screamed and was shouting I have to do it and ran up and kicked me and then started to run off around the lake which is huge and I am pregnant. I knew I couldnt catch him so I went over to the car and started it hoping that would scare him into coming back. It seemed to work and he actually got into the carseat quite nicely until I reached over to do his straps up and he slapped me in the eye&quot;I wanted to run around the lake&quot;I said we would not be stopping for lunch but would go straight home...screaming match in the back. Anyway get back home and make lunch there and spend 2 hours reading stories, drawing and then washing marker off the table. He then needed to go to the toilet but refused to put on his trousers again. (Ok I should have probably left it but I didnt.) I said I could help him now or he could do it by himself later. He said he wasnt doing it at all so I left it. He then noticed it was 3pm and wanted the tv on and so I said when you go and put your pants on you can watch tv. He told me I had to go and get them for him and (again I should have got them)I said no I offered help before, if you want tv you get your pants and put them on. He told me I had to say please (I just cant see when to stop) I said there is no please involved you get them you watch tv, you dont get them you dont watch tv. I moved away at this point as he was most likely to try to hurt me and sure enough he ran after me and kicked me. I have now put him in his room again. He is just so desperate for control and it is the demanding orders that really get to me.

yawning I can so relate.Many similar days with ds1. In fact I put him in time-out today within 15 minutes of him coming home from school sometimes it seems like everything is a struggle and I keep trying to remind myself to pick my battles but it&apos;s hard when it&apos;s all a battle.

We did a psychological evaluation last year at the same time that we were going through all of the OT diagnosis and initial therapy. I wanted to make sure i wasn&apos;t missing anything. so he wound up doing 6 months of play therapy every other week with a final summing up that there was nothing wrong in that area. A relief at least to cross off one thing iykwim.

I have decided that hitting, kicking or just out and out rudeness is an automatic time-out with no warnings. It has come as a bit of a shock to him but I just can&apos;t take it anymore. He&apos;s not really violent in general but more flailing out of control type stuff. I wind up physically carrying him to his room for time-out most of the time and it&apos;s not going to be long before I am unable (only 5 feet tall myself).

Anyway, I keep hoping for the day that we have worked through enough things that life is a bit more stable in the jabber household. I am considering getting an evaluation for Asperger&apos;s as well. Many children with Asperger&apos;s do have SPD but that;s not to say that just b/c he has SPD he is on the autistic spectrum.

ho hum, I&apos;m rambling now so I should probably sign off...

ds is having an assessment in late January. I got the call today and we all go in a see the specialist. I am thinking along the lines of Aspergers to be honest as although other posters have suggested we parent in a more positive way I honestly believe that we have. I know we use time out now but it really has been a last resort for us as I just couldn&apos;t take the daily abuse.
Ds does not play alone at all. Ds does not play with toys or when he does it is in kind of unusual ways. Ds does not appear to have any drive for autonomy, he has no desire to do things for himself eg would like to be carried everywhere, feed, dressed, entertained, accompanied every hour of the day, when playing together he will try his hardest not to actually participate he would rather direct others. Ds does not separate well from me, he has only recently started to have what we refer to as low level reactions to dad, granny and cm looking after him. On playdates and at playgroup he would rather I play with him than the other children and when he does interact with them he does not get the idea of playing with them at all. He is very literal and you cannot use phrases like&quot;Ds that behaviour just doesn&apos;t cut it or even&quot;I&apos;m pooped&quot;he gets confused and upset by what he sees as inappropriate use of words pooped always means soiled for example. He freaks out if say he is jumping and someone says&quot;Oh are you being a frog/kangaroo&quot;He will scream and get very upset that he is a boy not a frog etc. This coupled with the extreme reactions to sensory input is starting to be more than just&quot;him&quot;if ykwim. I think we need help. I hope that January gives us some clues about whether he is just unique and we are dealing with things in all the wrong ways or whether there is something underlying such as SPD or aspergers.

slowlylosingit- I can so identify with your feelings. At times, I find the day-to-day looking after a 3 year-old incredibly wearing and intense. Even things which are actually endearing or cute (e.g. constant questioning) can drive me nuts if I&apos;m having a bad time of it. It really can feel like a treadmill at times and it is the hardest job I&apos;ve ever had to do. Your feelings are so normal but that probably doesn&apos;t make you feel any better! Try to make the most of any opportunities to have a little bit of time to yourself, even when you&apos;re with your DD. It&apos;s not wrong to stick a DVD on now and then to give yourself a bit of time. I even tell my DD&apos;mummy is tired and is going to have a cup of tea and some peace and quiet for 20 minutes&apos;. She knows I will obviously get her a drink/help her if she needs the loo etc but that otherwise I would like her to do something quietly (watch DVD/play). I must be doing this more frequently than I realised as she will now say things like:&apos;I want a piece of quiet&apos;,&apos;Are you having a piece of quiet mummy?&apos;

Yawning monster, I think that your ds has had a really difficult time in the first year, and it may take longer for him to get to that emotional intelligence that most children acquire but it sounds as if he&apos;s got lots going for him. He loves running/adventures, he can enjoy outings he loves being with you, he can articulate a lot of his feelings in words not just in violent reactions, and as you say he has learnt to relate to some people. You must be doing a lot of things right to give him those skills and interactions. But, it&apos;s so incredibly timeconsuming, I&apos;m not surprised you are feeling emotionally drained. I&apos;m so glad that you may get some professional support advice in January, even just for someone to say, this isn&apos;t you, it&apos;s the way he is...and maybe this method of dealing with him will help a little...

Hi ym just to say you are absolutely not handling your ds all wrong.You are extremely measured in your responses,caring and patient.Our natural tendency is towant our children to develop well in all areas and if that doesn&apos;t seem to be going smoothly[however temporary the problem is]we want to put it right and think we have done it wrong.I&apos;m sure some of the things you mention are v.common in elder or only children [like wanting to be in charge and not playing alone]and actually,all children at this age to some degree.This will most likely pass within a year or two.Probably you both have very strong love for each other and spend a lot of time together and on a simple level it can be quite irritating when a child wants to be in control and it is difficult to judge how much to give in~ we&apos;ve been there and made the same [and more] mistakes.
Go easy on yourself and I hope the other threads have not lowered your confidence because you&apos;re doing really really well and its not easy with your first childcos you want everything to be so perfect for them. Take carexx.

thanks cranberry,
I decided that for a while we need to completely back off ds and try our best to do things the way he needs them done so feed him when he wants it, dress him when he wants it etc. I also tried really, really hard to ignore the hitting today to see how that went but just was awful. It was bath nite and one of the few things that we insist upon usually we are sticking to includes washing his hair once a week. So anyway as usual it was awful and violent on his part. I tried to completely ignore him and then when it was finished he got out of bath dripping wet punching and punching me so I just kept repeating clearly and firmly Do not hit me and catching and deflecting his arms so he tried to kick and bite as well. I kept calm and kept repeating the message hoping he would calm down but he just started shouting really loudly, dont hold my arms. I kept up my broken record but started to walk away. He ran after me throwing things and getting kicks and punches in when he could. After about 10 minutes (I know I didn&apos;t last very long did I) I couldn&apos;t take it and said if he kept it up he would go to his room and as it was bedtime he would stay there. He is currently still screaming. Arrgghh this is going to be a long road but the time out really isn&apos;t working so wanted to try the backing off, ignoring as much as possible route. Not sure what to do once he calms down tbh but I guess in line with the positive parenting approach I should try to calmly talk to him and get back on a positive note.

My children all hated having their hairwashed, UNTIL I used the funny mirror method. Show them the effect of the bubbles in their hair, and make funny shape with it. That helped a bit.
Actually I don&apos;t really wash their hair much, just let them float around in bath and pretend to be mermaids, sharks, dolphins. They just hated having their hair wet by someone else, fear of shampoo in eyes etc, but didn&apos;t mind going underwater of their own volition.

Poor you 
Think you did really well.
Have you tried dry flannel on his eyes,and putting shampoo in bathwater as bubbles and splashing discreetly with hand while playing.
He has strong feelings,they are expressed as outbursts/tantrums.He is sensitive.
That DOES NOT MEAN he will be an aggressive child/adult later on.
Go with the flow~ and I stop speaking when the going gets tough for a few mins,then distract and move on.
There used to be tv programmes over here by a child clin.psychologist and one of her things was to tell the child every hour&quot;I love you ,you are mums best boy&quot;[feels a bit funny if being aggressive] but it worked.I should say it was not during tantrums,then the idea was to sit /stand quietly out ofarms reachif possible.
I don&apos;t really have THE answers I&apos;m afraid just trying to give support and pass on tips.Look after yourselfxx

yawning I think you handled it just fine. It is totally appropriate to send him to his room for being violent, imo.

He also sounds very&quot;concrete&quot;in his thinking (I&apos;m a boy not a frog, etc) which is a trait of ds1&apos;s as well. I believe this is common for children with sensory issues (or indeed Asperger&apos;s). Still it can be hard to communicate with them without accidentally causing upset and tantrums. With all of the Christmas excitement we have definitely had our ups and downs this week.

Did Christmas turn other people&apos;s kids twice as hyper as well? I think they have been overstimulated and are now finding it hard to readjust to a more&apos;boring&apos;life. I keep feeling like I have absolutely no control over them and then I get anxious. Although too much build up of alcohol over Christmas and being tired makes me anxious anyway

Definitely more hyper. Today and yesterday I&apos;ve tried to concentrate on just going on as many walks as possible with them however everyday, although they moaned and groaned at leaving the house, telly, toys etc. And it was lovely to see them just running around in the sunshine (or mist as the case may be) Also one of my new year&apos;s resolutions is to go to bed much earlier, and feel better tempered next day as a result. One bad night and early start, has made me realise how terrible my mood is when I&apos;m tired, and its really not the children&apos;s fault. So I&apos;m off to bed now, leaving kitchen not very tidy and most things undone, just to kick start the new routine.

Happy New Year everyone, been off Mumsnet due to RL christmas. The DC and myself have been pretty well-behaved really. I lost it a few times over the festive period, but not too badly. The DC went back to school today, including DD for the very first time. Thought I&apos;d feel incredibly sad, but it seems right for us all really.

Acting Normal- did you and the DC manage to get out much over the holidays? We seemed to spend a lot of time cooped up inside which makes us all very hyper. A bit of fresh air tends to make us all calmer. Probably me more than the DC.

Thought about having NYResolution of&quot;Shout less at DCs&quot;then thought it&apos;s not as simple as that is it. You would have to have so much self control it would be almost impossible and then if you were angry but repressed it every time, eventually it would build up and explode and you would end up being really horrible to them and this would cancel out how good you were being by not shouting to start with.

A better approach, more likely to work, is to work on not feeling angry with them in the first place! I will attempt this by:

- Telling myself that when they are naughty it is a good thing really because it provides an opportunity to talk to them about why they did wrong, what they should have done instead and teach them about moral issues and about how to manage their emotions. If they don&apos;t make mistakes they can&apos;t learn from them.

- The&apos;visualising them as tiger cubs frolicking around&apos;technique so that I don&apos;t forget they are children and I shouldn&apos;t be overcontrolling them and turning them into mini-adults with loads of self control.

- Getting much more sleep and not binge drinking so that my anxiety and irritability is not made worse. When I feel anxious that unless I overcontrol the children they will hurt themselves I end up shouting at them.

- The&apos;star chart for Mummy&apos;technique when I spend time interacting fully with them so that I feel motivated rather than irritated that I have to&apos;work hard&apos;by doing stuff with them

- Remembering that when they keep interrupting what I want to do/my thoughts with their demands they are not enforcing hard work on me which I don&apos;t feel like doing. They didn&apos;t ask to be born, I CHOSE the job of motherhood and thought I was up to the job so I must now find the strength to do it properly, and if I know in my heart that I have done reasonably well then I will tell myself to be proud of my job as a mother, a job that is hard but I&apos;m still managing to do it.

- Being aware of when I am overreacting to something they have done because it is not really them that I am angry with but they are triggering emotions from an event in my past.

- Replacing my habitual negative ways of thinking and inward-focussed irritation at the world&apos;s negative intrusions into my head by positive feelings, by meditating regularly on the children, focussing totally on them and blanking out everything else and actively noticing all the things about them that I love and all the things that make them THEM, letting myself feel the positive feelings and&apos;emanate&apos;them to the children.

Any ideas what to do about this?

DD (5) is very demanding of DS&apos;s (3) time and attention (as well as mine). He will be playing nicely and happily on his own when she comes along and starts bossing him about, telling him to play the game she has just dreamed up and then going on and on at him about every little detail of what she wants him to do. He HATES being told what to do and says he doesn&apos;t want to play but she won&apos;t accept it and keeps hounding him and getting angry with him if he won&apos;t do exactly what she wants, exactly the way she wants it. He gets so ovewhelmed by her (see it&apos;s not just me!) he starts screeching and shouting and lashing out and eventually cries and sometimes gets hysterical!

I tell her to leave him alone if he doesn&apos;t want to play and to give him space and to try leaving it 5 mins and then ask him again. I try shouting (shouting generally has no effect on my children just makes them worse). I try physically taking DS away from her and trying to involve him in something else. But she seems unstoppable and keeps following him and won&apos;t shut up!

She seems to want constant attention. When other people are having a conversation she interrupts and tries to take over. If I didn&apos;t stop her DS would hardly have a chance to be heard at all! When we aren&apos;t talking to her or looking at her because we are busy with something else she is jumping about, making a noise, trying to get everyone&apos;s attention and saying&quot;Look at me, watch me do this&quot;etc. Is this my fault? Am I really not giving her enough attention? I feel like I am. DS doesn&apos;t seem to want more and more and more all the time. It can be SO draining!

I&apos;ve had an idea. You could be a mirror (do I mean that?) where you model the right sort of play with ds. Set up some play activity that you enjoy (not something unbearable)a tall tale, a fantasy game and be very unbossy during it, encouraging their suggestions and letting it go in all sorts of unexpected directions rather than preplanning the outcome. I tried this on the kids yesterday when they were fighting. I told a made up story and kept saying what do you think happened next, letting them take turns. It sort of worked. Then I gave up and put them in a bubble bath at 5.00!

AN, swan, and others, hi! it&apos;s been a while. AN, my DD used to often be like this with DS - still is at times. usually (in contrast to your situation) with his consent initially. would drag him into some nightmareishly complicated game, becoming more and more intense and demanding over the rules being followed exactly how she wanted them to be, with him (2 yrs younger) with no hope of being able to follow the increasingly complicated instructions and getting bewildered. eventually he would put a foot wrong and she would EXPLODE. i used to cringe at this so often and wonder when/whether to intervene - DS was always keen to begin with but you could see he didn&apos;t know how to formulate an exit strategy! i used to have to take DS aside and say to him, look, it&apos;s okay, you can tell DD when you want to stop the game. now he&apos;s much feistier with her i notice and has quite a lot of spirit of his own . back soon but must go pick them up...

Thank you Katie and Swan, I will try your ideas. Tried to play Frustration with them today (fairly simple game with counters and a dial/dice). I WAS frustrated, and pretty bored. DS (3) was better than DD (5) - she just can&apos;t seem to focus and has to leap about and try to cheat and make loads of noise when it is somebody else&apos;s turn so they are distracted. I think we will keep practicing though (games with simple rules). DD seems to have a big problem with having any self control at all! But it isn&apos;t ADHD because she can concentrate and focus and sit still at school!

I think one has to make a distinction between Entertaining and just Being with children. Sometimes just walking down the road to the newspaper shop is good enough attention wise. I am now struck by the way that when I stop trying to please dd but accommodate her sort of emotionally ie: I&apos;m doing something like tidying a drawer (v boring I know) and chatting to her she is perfectly happy.

I wonder if DD was just as happy today when I sat at the table with her while she did her drawing and I did mine and we just talked about what we were doing, as yesterday when I put loads of effort into getting them to play&apos;proper&apos;games (which was tiring)!

Oh my God! I have just found this thread again after a HUGE break from it (I am rachelp73 but changed my name on a whim ages ago and so missed the Threads I&apos;m On, and just got out the habit of reading this thread I suppose). Had no idea it would still be going.

It&apos;s fabulous that people are still finding it supportive.

For my part, I&apos;d just like to say that my highly-strung, whingey, demanding, draining DS2 is now fast approaching 3 (in March) and has really got a LOT easier to handle these past few months. He just seems to have grown into himself somehow and just seems more contented. As a result of this, I am not losing patience with him so much, I find, and so as a result of THAT, his behaviour is improving even more! Don&apos;t get me wrong, he is still a right whinger. The whingeing is the worst thing, but it is less than what it used to be. I&apos;ve recently taken to whingeing back at him in a silly voice, and he seems to recognise this for what it is and it makes him laugh and forget he was whingeing, or he realises that there&apos;s no real point whingeing or something.

I am putting a lot of the improvement down to him doing 3 mornings a week at a fab nursery where he is kept VERY busy and he just loves it there so much that he&apos;d go every day if he could. I have also realised that he&apos;s really very bright, and in the recent past when his language wasn&apos;t so good, a lot of his bad behaviour was probably down to an inability to articulate his wants and needs, and getting frustrated with himself. Now that he can say and do much more, he is like a changed child. He does need a lot of stimulation though but has recently learnt the alphabet and can recognise all the letters by sight too and name them, and so is kept occupied by various electronic alphabet toys which he got for Xmas.

But the nursery thing has been brilliant for him. I also have LOVED having those few hours a week away from him (and don&apos;t mind admitting it - it really has made a difference to my ability to cope with his strong personality!) I can&apos;t wait until he does 5 mornings a week after Easter as he really seems to be thriving on it (kind of makes me think I was at fault before for not providing enough stimulating activities at home for him - maybe all the bad behaviour was just because he was bored ?)

I haven&apos;t had time to read all the huge amount of posts added since I last looked, but just wanted to pop on and say hello, and wish everyone all the best with their demanding little ones. It&apos;s lovely to see some positive stories and I sympathise with the&quot;1 step forward, 2 steps back&quot;type of ones. But I just wanted to add my little update and say that there DOES seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel for some of these behaviours.

Oh, and I just wanted to add that I think in one of my posts as rachelp73 I sheepishly admitted that on the quiet, just between my DH and me, we&apos;d both agreed that he was hard to love quite a lot of the time . Now I am very proud and happy to say that he is very easy to love now, he is a lovely, funny, charming and charismatic little boy.&lt;proud mummy emoticon&gt;

Hi again, KatieK! Well, I&apos;ve had a bit of a mixed day with my DS! Very good at occupying himself on the whole, (even though no nursery today) so I was able to get on with housework etc, but he has had a fair few incidennts of throwing himself on the floor moaning and crying if he doesn&apos;t get his own way (which he doesn&apos;t - I don&apos;t give in to him but he STILL tries it on) but lately it seems that he doesn&apos;t get entrenched in his own little tantrumming world when it happens. I can usually manage to reason with him or change the subject or distract him whatever and get him out of his crying fit. Something which it was always quite hard to do before his language was so developed. He is still so demanding compared with 5 year old DS1, but it is all definitely improving with age.

How you getting on Katie?

I have just found this thread, and thank goodness for it.

My DS is 5, in year 1, and has the most spectacular meltdowns and level of unreasonableness. I thought I was alone. I thought there was something wrong with him. I knew there was something wrong with me as I often deal with it so badly.

I have spent the last 3 or more hours reading this and feel so relived to find it&apos;s not just me, or him. I have already seen a few ideas which I&apos;m going to use to see if it helps (not least the fact that hunger and low blood sugar could well be a factor) and I&apos;m off to search amazon for some of he books people have recommended.

I hate myself when I shout and I hate myself more when I see his angry face crumpled up in rage as I know that he has learned that face from looking at mine. He is very sensitive, a terrible eater, gentle and thoughtful and kind, and yet he is also so angry and cross with the world. All my fault for setting an angry example. I am so sorry.

I am going to think of some strategies and use lots of your ideas, ladies. Thank you for bothering to share your info with everybody. I really am so glad that I found this thread.

 philmassive &apos;all your fault for having modelled angry behaviour&apos;- not necessarily! please don&apos;t blame yourself. of course modelling anger is hardly ideal, though we are all guilty of it sometimes, but anger seems to me to well up of its own accord in some children with a certain temperament. then again perhaps i would say that given my DD&apos;s tendencies in that direction ! lovely to have you on the thread.

 rachel - great to have you back, it really is. i&apos;m doing fine, thanks. DD definitely continuing to settle with age, thank goodness, in fact DS has been more testing in recent months - guess it was his turn . i get him doing lots of sports, which he loves, karate, football, swimming etc, as he is a terrible tv addict and i try to keep him away from the screen as much as poss.

our main problem at the moment is with nights - they have both always woken at least once each but often more, and at 7 and 5 i bloody wish they&apos;d STOP! in DD&apos;s case it&apos;s usually anxiety/nightmare-related, but in DS&apos;s case it&apos;s pure habit (indulgent mother patting him on head too often in the night in the early years ). must work on this. new star charts went up on fridge door this morning...

only other issue is DD&apos;s best friend lunching every day on chocolate and crips, having a telly in her bedroom, pierced ears,mobile phone, ipod and own horse - has just turned 8 . leading to some interesting discussions at home!!

back soon x

Help! I haven&apos;t been on this thread for a long time - dd had a great Christmas which I guess is fairly inevitable with all the attention she gets. Now we&apos;re back to regular life and I&apos;m tearing my hair out, losing it far too many times every day and I just don&apos;t know what to do. I&apos;ll outline the main issues and if anyone has any advice at all, I&apos;d be very grateful.

1. Getting dressed in the morning (and into pyjamas at night) - it can take up to half an hour, most of which is spent with dd running around naked

2. Slamming doors - dd plays with the doors at any available opportunity - my sanction has been to take her to her room for two minutes with her door shut (&apos;If you shut doors, then I&apos;ll shut doors&apos;) - she doesn&apos;t like it but not enough to stop her from sdoing it.

3. Mealtimes - if she has the right bowl/plate, spoon and fork, cup, food then she might eat but mostly then only if I help her.

4. She&apos;s cut her day time nap down to about twice a week - it doesn&apos;t seem to be enough but I don&apos;t know how to get her to sleep more (she spends about an hour in her room every day but just plays)

A bit of background info - she&apos;s 2.7, full of energy, just started pre-school two sessions a week, I&apos;m a SAHM, ds is 9 months.

Often I don&apos;t think she&apos;s being purposefully naughty, just very playful. But she&apos;s just started playing football and she seems to pay very little attention to the teachers there.

I&apos;m really concerned about her bahaviour and want to nip it in the bud now. I feel like I spend so much time cajoling and encouraging with no effects. I also keep thinking that if it was just her then I could spend time really focusing on her behaviour but ds needs attention too and I&apos;m finding it really hard to share myself between them.

Any suggestions??

Sounds perfect to me!
Clothes. Lay out clothes night before with her and don&apos;t fret about style choices however hideous. Will learn from her peers what goes with what. Choice of two outfits?
Food. They don&apos;t eat much. They love a special plate and why not..
Sleep. Sounds like you have it just right. Nice rest in room whether playing or sleeping.
Instructions at football? surely she can just run around and have fun.

Slamming doors - perhaps she likes sound of banging? Drum, xylophone. Safe plastic, soft playhouse with door she can bang? Toy saucepans to bash? I agree it sounds annoying and dangerous to have the real doors slamming but it gets your immediate attention so maybe that is her motive as well. Door stops on all doors so they don&apos;t bang? and she might lose interest?
 Add message | Report | Message poster nondomesticgoddess Wed 21-Jan-09 14:48:01 
Thank you!

The clothes the night before is something I thought of but I&apos;m convinced that by the time the morning comes, she won&apos;t want to wear whatever is out. Do I let her change her mind again or&apos;force&apos;the outfit that&apos;s there?

With food, a special plate would be fine. This is a case of wanting a different plate/cup/spoon/fork every mealtime - I think I&apos;ve picked the ones she likes best and I just get a big&apos;NOOOOOO!&apos;. If she already has two cups on the go should I give in and give her a third? And do I just move all the food off the bowl (which she chose 3 minutes previously) onto the one she now wants?

I&apos;m finding it hard to know when to give in and when to stay firm. I try and offer two choices with nearly everything as I know this is an age where they want some control. I&apos;m just fed up iof conversations like this -
Would you like the pink cup or blue cup?
Pink cup.
You&apos;d like the pink cup?
No, blue cup.
You&apos;d like the blue cup?
No, pink cup.
Pink cup?
Yes.
Yes what?
Yes please.
Are you sure? Pink cup?
Yes.
Here&apos;s the pink cup.
NOOOOOOOOO! Want the blue cup!!!!

With the doors, the door stops would be a great idea. I&apos;m sure she would then lose interest very quickly.

NDG my sympathy! does sound like all with settle down with age but as far as the here and now is concerned i would offer fewer choices if i were you - and wish i had, at that stage! i think our generation really overdoes the choice thing and that can stress some kids out. i was forever trying to defuse potential tantrums by offering choice - turns out my anxiety-prone daughter was probably feeling overloaded by the constant demands to constantly CHOOSE and actually i stepped back from that approach when a pre-school teacher took me aside one day and had a word! just a thought. good luck xxx

KK - I think you could be right - I had a similar thought while I was writing that last bit. Sometimes I find if I just put a cup down in front of her she might kick off for a few seconds but when she realises it&apos;s that or nothing, she always gives in.

It&apos;s so difficult to find the middle ground - I want her to have freedom and to enjoy life (and let&apos;s face it, she&apos;s only 2) but she also needs to understand that she can&apos;t always have what she wants when she wants it.

Hmm I can see what you mean about pink/blue cup conversation.
I did learn that negotiation for its own sake was a mistake with dd. So I suppose in that case you have to be very firm consistent and positive&quot;Let&apos;s get your cup from the cupboard, and put it out for you. You put it on table for me. Well done for helping me lay the table&quot;(and then don&apos;t change your mind)

Clothes are such a nightmare I can&apos;t even bear to remember the arguments. However I do recall getting cross she would only wear boys&apos;clothes for a time and now see it didn&apos;t really matter!

NDG,

Cups - My DD is sometimes like this although she is older. I bring something out to the table and she whines&quot;I don&apos;t want that one&quot;. I say&quot;Oh, you don&apos;t want it? I&apos;ll take it away then&quot;and act like I&apos;m taking it back to the kitchen. When she realises she won&apos;t get anything if she doesn&apos;t accept it she says she wants it after all.

Getting dressed - My DS is sometimes like this. The other day I did something that worked! I said&quot;Let&apos;s see how fast you can get dressed, I will count the seconds&quot;DD helped me count and that stopped her annoying/distracting him by doing other things as well. He wanted to get dressed fast and cooperated and let me help him without running off cackling!

Slamming doors - DS does this and I HATE it! I haven&apos;t solved this one yet as I have to tell him off for it every day! I ask him nicely, he does it again, I say&quot;I&apos;ve asked you not to do that, if you do it again I&apos;m going to put you in your pushchair&quot;, he does it again, he goes in his pushchair, he cries tragically for a bit, I ask him if he is gonig to be good and not do it again, he shakes his head, I say&quot;Well you can stay there then&quot;, he shrieks, I say&quot;Are you going to stop doing it?&quot;, he nods, I let him out, he doesn&apos;t do it again - until the next day.

Naps - DS would never have them and I found it hard to accept I wasn&apos;t going to get a break. Not having naps meant that he fell asleep quicker at night though. I think some kids just don&apos;t need one. DD would nap for 3 hours until she was 3.5 and still sleep at night. DS would not nap.

Had another&apos;brainwave&apos;today. When I want to leave the house and want DS to go for a wee first he runs off and I get flustered because I&apos;m in a rush and he is messing about. Today I got it into my head to say&quot;Come with me, hold my hand, we will do a silly walk to the bathroom&quot;. He was happy to hold my hand and giggled about me singing a song, shuffling my feet and then suddenly sticking one leg out as we walked and he copied me. It struck me that if I could make them WANT to do the things I wanted by making it fun in some way then they would cooperate.

DS is also the slowest eater in the world (and so was I as a child). The other day when me and DH were feeling motivated, we separated out a small amount of the food on his plate and said&quot;When you have eaten that bit we will draw a smiley face on this chart&quot;. He ate it, we drew the face, we separated out another bit of food, he ate it, we drew a slightly different face etc and he ate more than he had ever eaten before in a faster time!

Doing fun things seems to work on our kids better/quicker than shouting or threatening consequences. Sometimes though when we are feeling tired or ill or moody, we just don&apos;t FEEL like making an effort and doing fun things, we just want them to do as they are told, NOW, so that we can get on with the day! Things seem to work if we are in a good mood! The best solution to everything I can think of is to get enough sleep and nutrition and&apos;doing what we want time&apos;so that we are in a good enough mood to do these fun things!

you do not sound like a bad mother, my dd is 18months old and is very demanding and after quite a few really hard days I shouted at her and felt really bad, but when I shouted she was not scared or anything and then started to behave really well for me. 

i think it is so hard being a mother and it gets to us all at some time...

Hello there all. I&apos;ve been a while away from these pages what with moving house and various things taking much time and energy, but still following you in snatched moments. Just had a nightmare long w/e of partner away (actually that continues until tomorrow night), Ds has been ill with fever then cough and cold so no nursery on friday (he only goes for a few hours usually but it saves my sanity!) . I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s the illness or partner being away or combination but Ds has been incredibly clingy, demanding, intense and I&apos;ve been absolutely at the end of my tether on numerous occasions this w/e. I&apos;ve shouted a few times, which always leaves me feeling ashamed, but at least grateful that I can control worse urges to hit out!

Oh confessions...I find it incredible that I can love that little boy with all my heart - more than anything and probably anyone in the world - and yet have flashing fantasies of giving him a terrible wallop! These moments usually come after its been hours of him not&apos;allowing&apos;me to do anything because he wants constant attention and is jealous of anything else that takes my attention (like cooking, eating, peeingthat basic). Hell rip a book from my hand and try tearing it. Close the computer roughly to stop me looking at it. These readings and lookings are only snatched moments in the first place. He is SUCH an intense little boy. Its as if he is always at high velocity and cannot turn his intensity down for even a second. He even falls asleep wringing my fingers and breathing intensely. I only know he has fallen asleep as the physical intensity dies down and I suppose he has then fallen into intense dreams! I would have fallen asleep with himfor I am very tiredbut for the fact I was desperate for a little time for myself.

Hi there my last post was a bit of an off-load, but just wanted to ask how folk on here have dealt with very clingy behaviour. ATM my ds wants cuddling constantly, will not play with his toys unless I play with him. I have tried reassuring him about everything and giving more cuddles etc (we have moved house recently so there is some reason for insecurity/being unsettled...but - this seems/feels excessive and I am finding that unless my Ds is at nursery, asleep or plugged into a TV programme (I cant let that take over!) I am effectively disabled as an independent entity ATM, and it&apos;s driving me a bit bonkers ! AARGH!

hi skydancer, was following this thread a while ago but am not up to date, but just wanted to say i have been through phases like you describe with my DS and all i can is that it is just a phase and it will pass. It is very very hard for you whilst it&apos;s going on, but just try and hang on and i promise it will be over at some point. Try and get out of the house if you can, i find if we&apos;re out DS is less clingy and i get a bit of head space.

My kids are being difficult the last few days, doing the opposite of what they are told, tantrumming, going on and on at me nagging for what they want.

I&apos;m just reminding myself that if I shout at them ALL day (like I have been doing), they just seem to stop hearing it. I need to talk nicely to them and explain things and tell them about consequences and carry them out if necessary. Save shouting for the most extreme bad behaviours so that it will have more effect.

I think my problem is I give them too many chances before I carry out the consequence.

My DP told me a week ago that I have been shouting at my DS too much in recent times. I was a bit shocked at that as I wasn&apos;t even properly aware of it. So this week I have been trying to be aware of it and if I feel the urge to raise my voice I curb it - try to find some other way of communicating despite whatever level of frustration. It has been challenging as my Ds is coming up with every increasing will-fullness and corresponding anger if he is thwarted in what he wants. He has got into hitting and kicking me instantly if I say no to anything. It&apos;s not all a battlefield as he is also a delightful, funny, playful and hugely affectionate boy but his anger can be so instant and volcanic it can take my breath away. I&apos;m having to re-learn again how to provide boundaries. The hitting/kicking thing is upsetting and I&apos;m having to use threats/punishments about taking away treats like TV programmes - but it&apos;s hard at times to be consistent/follow through with that as everything can come so thick and fast I just forget!

Oh God, half term next week I&apos;ll have DD demanding stuff all day every day and winding DS up, great!

I CAN do the&apos;right&apos;things but it takes all my energy and will power to keep calm (and lots of herbal remedies). If I get a bit ill or a bit tired or she does something really bad I&apos;m in danger of losing it and then not being able to tolerate anything for the rest of the day! I can&apos;t believe I have to resort to&apos;herbal drugs&apos;to cope with her!

I don&apos;t want to never give her what she wants so I do some of it but she is the sort of child who will push and push to see how much she can get out of you until I get annoyed - then I don&apos;t feel like doing anything that she asks me for next time. I suppose I should do a few things then say something like&quot;I&apos;ve done a few things for you and I will do more later when I&apos;ve had a rest&quot;DS asks for the occassional thing but he doesn&apos;t go on and on at me for one thing after the other and wear me out.

When she is naughty and I tell her off she really doesn&apos;t care! Small punishments don&apos;t affect her, she just doesn&apos;t care! So then I&apos;m thinking of doing really horrible things which will really upset her, just to make her sorry for misbehaving. It feels horrible. I become obsessed with how to upset her and that feels so wrong! If I tell DS off, not even very authoritatively, he cries tragically! I can imagine when DD is older she will say&quot;Well what are you goind to do about it?&quot;when I ask her not to do something.

DD has no idea about people needing any space. She is in my face, in DS&apos;s face, in DH&apos;s face, going on and on, never stopping talking or wanting things. DS gets overwhelmed by it and ends up crying. It is hard to give him attention that is just for him when she is there because she butts in, talking loudly, physically getting between me and DS, demanding ALL the attention. Even if I send her into the other room eg to get her school uniform on, she is jumping about and making a noise and trying to get us all to take notice of her. She can&apos;t seem to stand not having the attention for a second!

Even her friends find it too much sometimes. I&apos;ve seen one friend go and hide in his bedroom complaining that she talks too much, and she came home from school the other day saying her friends kept running away from her in the playground and&quot;I was only trying to tell them something&quot;but I can imagine that she just wouldn&apos;t stop getting in their faces and going on and on at them!

At the moment I&apos;m trying to keep calm and keep explaining that people need space and if she goes on and on at people they get annoyed and won&apos;t want to do things for her or be her friend. Is it sinking in though if she isn&apos;t really changing her behaviour? When DS is getting ovewhelmed by her I ask him if he would like to come and sit with me away from her for a few moments to get some space and she hates that, so it is some kind of punishment for her and he gets some space and doesn&apos;t get so overwhelmed.

I&apos;m just venting really because I find her so wearing and I&apos;m wondering if I will cope with half term! We have some activities planned (not so many that they will be spoilt and overloaded though).

Are you all looking forward to half term?

AN the half term isn&apos;t relevant to me given my child&apos;s age and my current location, but hope it is going all right for you - better than you anticipated anyhow!? It does sound like a painful dynamic with your DD. I can guess that when that is all going full-swing then the more she pushes for attention the more you pull away - ad infinitum. Do you have time just with her sometimes to do something together - something you enjoy too so you can give her some of your attention happily? And do you think she would enjoy acting/drama?

Thanks SkyDancer, it is going really well so far! I should have known it wouldn&apos;t be as bad as I had thought and I shouldn&apos;t have got myself wound up!

We are doing some fun things together and I&apos;m actually ENJOYING being with the children! This is a big thing for me because I went through a phase where I found it hard to feel, well anything, for a while.

The key to it has been conquering my anxiety and coming out from inside my head and my preoccupations and seeing what makes the children them and what makes children, children. The anxiety blocked my positive feelings and the preoccupation made me blind to things in the real world. The anxiety was also causing me to get angry and irritable much more often. If it helps anyone, it isn&apos;t just&apos;mental&apos;techniques that are helping, I&apos;m finding herbal remedies helpful as well. The ones I use are Relora (for stress), Rhodiola (for stamina), Ginkgo (for mental clarity), Lemon Balm (for calmness) and also effervescent B vitamins dissolved in a glass of water as soon as I wake up (when I&apos;m normally furious just to be awake!)

I think DD WOULD like drama activities! That is a good idea. I could get her to join a children&apos;s drama group. She is&apos;mad&apos;but I feel she is also very talented and special, and I want to give her opportunities to develop her talents if she wants to.

We both like art and craft and realising there is something we both like and can enjoy together really helps our relationship.

We do have time that is just for DD and me because DS&apos;s nursery is open on school holidays so at those times we have 2 days a week which we call DD days when we do things we like together. You are really right about this helping. When we first started doing it I didn&apos;t feel very motivated and didn&apos;t feel it would make any difference but the improvement in our relationship has happened since we first starting doing&apos;DD Days&apos;.

Hope everyone else is having a good half term x

Do you know what makes you a fab mum? And that is that you recognise that things need to change and you have posted on here being honest. I am exactly like you and have never had the guts to post or even realised I needed advice.

What we both need to do is remember that they are still just such little people - not even 3 years old! They have no idea about the trouble caused about changing their mind ove choc etc.

And we need to not shout so much - I now try to ignore dd when she is throwing a strop and say to her - when you have stopped crying I will talk to you. After a few minutes she comes to my saying&apos;i feel better now&apos;. And we can then get on with things.

She is obviously a bright child so maybe you could try doing more things with her - cooking, puzzles, pretend play etc and enjoying your time together.

Thanks for posting, you have helped me to realise that I shout far too much too xx

dear Balanomorey,not sure youll even be reading this post as it was started last sept. but have just come across it and wanted to contribute.i have 6 children, two with SN, so i can honestly say i am not mother earth.i too can shout, but can also see it doesnt achieve anything.i dont know if you have other children so as what to know is age appropriate, but i think this helps.child num 6 is 3yrs old. she is so grown up in her speech, and plays the Wii and X-box like a pro, but, she still likes her bo-bo(bottle) and teddy.having the ability to see things from a childs perspective helps, when the tantrums and the I DO IT starts.agree with previous posts, that being able to second guess what little person may say or respond to given situation, really helps.of course your daughter forgives you when you loose it, my kids do too, but, if you shout alot, she will become anxious and even afraid of your response.she is already saying, sorry, sorry, and i love you.at this point, she is telling you shes frightened, and should be a visual clue for you to stop.this is not the same as ignoring bad behaviour, but altering your response to it. also agree with other posts, telling child when they stop tantrum etc, they can have your attention, is much more affective than yelling or giving more than two punishments. remember she is only coming up for 3-a baby.you cannot have an easy life with one child or ten-you loose that right, when you decide to have a child, no matter what has gone on in your life, or is going on.try to enjoy this stage and remember you are her universe-neither of you have a choice in this.my eldest, is nearly 15yrs old-in a few yrs shell be leaving home-im happy and sad at the thought-where did my baby go?

I&apos;m just popping back on here to say that after my post of Mon 19-Jan-09, we are back to the bad old days again re: DS2&apos;s behaviour. I think I&apos;ve resigned myself to the fact that he is just going to go through these bad phases till some day in the distant future there are more good phases than bad. With it being half-term it&apos;s very, very wearing as he is getting on DS1&apos;s nerves too and then they wind each other up. Am having to try very hard to keep my temper with him some days, as it just seems that he cries at ANYTHING. And I mean anything - he&apos;s such a drama queen over the littlest thing. A lot of the time it&apos;s not just whingeing - there are actually loads of tears from him and he just seems beside himself with abject misery at, for example, having to go to pick DS1 up from school when he was engrossed in playing with his trains or something. Soo all a bit at the moment cos I thought we&apos;d kind of left those bad whingey moods of his behind for ever.

Not had chance to read the past months posts yet but will when I get a chance.

Oh, and ActingNormal, the way you describe your DD in your last couple of posts sound EXACTLY like my DS2. He is coming up to age 3, but I think as soon as I can get drama lessons for him, he&apos;ll be going there. He also wants all the attention - constantly, and is always showing off. As an example, I took him into Next the other week and was trying on some boots, he went over to a nearby seating area where we could both still see each other but was a bit away from where I actually was. And he was saying in this loud, attention-seeking voice&quot;Oh no, where has my mummy gone?! Where IS she?&quot;And all the while he was looking at me with this big smirk on my face, and also looking around to see what customers were noticing him!!!!! I can&apos;t believe him sometimes!! That actually made me go and sit right next to him as I didn&apos;t want anyone to think I wasn&apos;t supervising him closely enough! How manipulative can they get?!

My DS also does all the jumping about and talking very loudly to get attention. Sounds like I&apos;ll have to prepare myself for it going on a few more years - I just hope he can channel some of his energy into entertaining people on the stage when he&apos;s older!

Oh good i sympathise with you so much! My daughter is 5 now and i also thought i had a short fuse.

When she was 3 i thought other mum&apos;s were sooooo patient in comparison with their lilttle one&apos;s.

Then i realised that at times their children displayed behaviour my daughter wouldn&apos;t dream of and realised that i hadn&apos;t done all bad!

I learnt to chill out a bit and not to shout and instead i would count to 10 and think about how bad the behaviour really was..

So much of it is normal i would only really worry about outright defiance and alway&apos;s give them the benefit of the doubt.

Don&apos;t beat yourself up, try and learn from each experience it&apos;s really hard being a mum no matter how patient you are.

What you feel bad about your child will have forgotten already anyway! As long as you don&apos;t use put downs or deny your love for them, kids are very forgiving of the odd cross word..

Katiek! Great to see you again on here 

Yesterday

quite a fright as DS fell over backwards into a tree well and hit his head hard on the concrete surround. I heard the dull thump and then paroxysms of tears, a bruise welling up and an a small gash producing an alarming amount of blood. It was horrible but at that point I wasn&apos;t too worried, as he&apos;s had plenty of minor scrapes in two and half years. But then he wouldn&apos;t stop crying and it was the&apos;wrong&apos;pitch of crying - too high - and he became limp and excessively sleepy. At this point I was off to the local health centre where they patched him up and recommended I got him to the local hospital fast (five minutes and he wasn&apos;t to fall asleep) to be checked over/x-rayed. They didn&apos;t offer an ambulance, which is weird in retrospect. I rounded up DP, whom I&apos;d managed to scare on the mobile so much he was somewhat beside himself by the time he found us, and we hopped in a taxi with DS to the local hospital. They checked him over very thoroughly including head x-rays and he was fine apparently - but to be watched carefully over a 48 hour period.

Just the threat of a serious injury was so painful. I discovered I understood quite a lot and could be quite effectively insistent in Spanish. I&apos;m so not a fan of him but really felt for David Cameron and his son dying. Excruciating. I just want to rejoice in my DP for a moment because he is such an excellent, loving and brilliant father.

Today DS, despite looking somewhat as if he&apos;d been in a boxing ring the night before, what with his patch, bruise and swollen eyelid, has been fighting fit all day. I made the huge mistake of going to ToysRus to window shop for pushchairs with him. He had a whale of a time trying out every toy he could get his hands on, but I couldn&apos;t persuade him to leave the shop. In the end I had to prise him kicking and screaming out of a wendy house and he tried strangling me and then raked his nails down my face, slightly grazing one cornea of my eye. So I think he&apos;s feeling all right now

Hi there Katiek and thanks for the greetings . Well that book certainly sounds really good and despite the fact that I&apos;ve been a practising Buddhist for about 23 years I still reckon I could do with reading it !! I mean that, as there is very little teaching out there on linking practice to parenthood. I think my practice has informed and helped with all sorts of things but the lifestyle change is so huge any guidance on bringing the two together is fantastic.

Hello, haven&apos;t been on here for ages but sometimes things seem to flare up again. Can I ask you ladies a question? - How do I know whether my children know that I love them? Apart from the times when I tell them.

I feel guilty for telling them off a lot in case they feel like I don&apos;t love them but they are naughty a lot and wouldn&apos;t it be just as wrong to never tell them off and let them get away with bad behaviour?

I used to get angrier with them than what I thought a&apos;normal&apos;person would because of my own mental issues but I&apos;ve worked a lot on them now and it is quite a lot better. Sometimes I still can&apos;t help getting angry though. DH gets really angry as well and I think of him as being&apos;normal&apos;. He just blew up at DD and I thought how could anyone not get angry in that situation and maybe it was never all because of my mental issues but because DD can be very very challenging!

Just now she had decided she was going to have a prize because she had done some writing (nobody asked her to). I wouldn&apos;t let her root through the kitchen drawers turfing everything out and making a mess and just taking what she wanted so she got angry. She took turns to shout at me and DH demanding that we give her something. DH said all we have got is little boxes of raisins but she thought that wasn&apos;t good enough. Even if we wanted to give her something more exciting we just haven&apos;t got anything else at the moment. She wouldn&apos;t accept this and wouldn&apos;t stop shouting at us in a spoilt brat way so DH lost it and put her in her room.

Surely we did nothing wrong? So why do I feel guilty? I&apos;m scared she will feel&apos;got at&apos;and unloved.

DD is so demanding all the time and talking so much and right in everyone&apos;s faces even when we are trying to do something else, and so active, jumping around, making loads of noise. It scrambles my brain (which is easily scrambled and I get anxious easily anyway).

She wants so much attention all the time and wants us to do so many things for us that lots of times I have to say no or ask her not to talk to me for a minute otherwise I wouldn&apos;t get anything done and just wouldn&apos;t be able to think straight because it is like a constant bombardment. But every time I do say no I feel like I am rejecting her and making her feel unloved. I&apos;ve tried giving her all the attention she wants but it makes her want more. The inlaws were here yesterday giving the kids loads of attention and today DD is even worse!

So I suppose the question is, when I say no to some of her demands or don&apos;t give her attention every time she wants it, do you think this makes her feel unloved?

My mind is so scrambled I don&apos;t know whether DD is in the wrong or I am in the wrong.

It gets so bad that I become resistant to doing anything she wants whenever she comes near me because I feel so done in from her non stop ways. I also feel the more she gets the more she wants. I don&apos;t want to make her spoilt. I&apos;m having trouble working out how to find a moderate way and how practically to do this. DS wants things but not so constantly and I don&apos;t feel resistant to doing what he wants.

And anyway WHY is it never enough for her?
 Add message | Report | Message poster NotQuiteCockney Sun 15-Mar-09 13:01:33 
I think it&apos;s reasonable to say no - sometimes you have to. I think it&apos;s reasonable to get angry - but it&apos;s best if you can say&apos;I&apos;m feeling very angry and frustrated by this. I need some time to cool down.&apos;Or similar. That way, you&apos;re showing her the behaviour you&apos;d like her to have.

You&apos;re not losing it when anything doesn&apos;t go your way, and shouting. That&apos;s not good behaviour, from anyone.

Can you make an effort to find activities you both enjoy doing, and do them with her, sometimes?

AN, your dd sounds a lot like mine... very spirited, very demanding.

I know it&apos;s nigh-on impossible at times, and guilt-inducing but I think the worst thing we can do for our kids is be afraid to say&apos;no&apos;to them. We have to bring them up to live in the real world where they&apos;ll be faced with disappointment from time to time.

I&apos;ve started working on the principle of pausing and asking myself whether what she wants is actually feasible/workable. If it isn&apos;t i turn to her and explain why not as calmly and frankly as i can. Offer a reasonable alternative, then when the tantrum inevitably kicks off i have to force myself to ignore her for a bit. The idea is that she&apos;ll calm down when she&apos;s ready. Quite often it leads to her hitting me or destroying stuff, if that happens my last resort is to put her in the living room (which we&apos;ve sectioned off with stairgates) and say&apos;Hitting is wrong. Let&apos;s both calm down.&apos;

I find i feel far less guilty about this than i do if i end up arguing with her (which usually ends up with me being horrible and shouty). Gives me a chance to breath and get some physical distance between us, which helps, even if i can still hear her screaming like a banshee from the next room!

So you could look at it as actually showing your love for her by not giving in to her every time.

i also just wanted to share a quick thought about the&apos;arts and crafts&apos;thing that lots of posters have been talking about.

i&apos;m an arty type, a-level, art college etc. i was always really into it. some of my happiest childhood memories are just sitting and painting away, or cutting and sticking. i still am happy as larry spending an afternoon painting away at my easel (dh takes dd out for a few hours -it&apos;s my idea of heaven.)

I think perhaps the problems that are arising might be more to do with the&apos;crafts&apos;bit that the&apos;art&apos;bit. Personally, i can&apos;t remember having experienced the kind of frustration described here where art was concerned. For me, it was always a peaceful thing because there is not right or wrong. I think it was because my parents showed me that the joy was in the act of creation (sorry if it sounds pretentious as hell) and not in&apos;getting it right&apos;or getting it perfect. On the&apos;crafts&apos;side of things those little craft kit things annoyed the hell out of me and still do, for the reason that the photo on the cover is of something made by an adult with a lifetimes experience in needlework/ crochet/ foil etching and yet the kit says ages 5 and up or whatever.

so my advice; stick with Art, but encourage them to experiment with mixing colours, contrasting them on the page, creating abstract shapes, mucking about with huge wodges of cardboard, etc (because you can&apos;t get those&apos;wrong&apos;) maybe hold the crafts for a time when you can both give it your undivided attention and guide them through it step by step.

Thank you Misfit, what you said sounds like it could work for me too.

DD and I LOVE art and craft as well. It is the only thing that she is calm and focussed doing. When I actually get round to sitting with her and doing some stuff of my own while she does hers it is really nice. I TOTALLY agree about not directing them to make it look a certain way and just letting them do what they want. DD has loads of original ideas, sometimes beyond her capabilities (then I end up doing it for her while she orders me what to do - but she is still the one creating which is important). She gets into a fury if things don&apos;t work the way she wants sometimes and I don&apos;t always keep calm listening to her....

NotQuiteCockney, this (above) is mine and DD&apos;s&apos;thing&apos;we do together as well as the odd bit of shopping and going to&apos;our&apos;cafe without DS and DH. I think you are right, I need to try to focus on doing nice things with her and looking forward to enjoying it rather than focussing on how crazy she makes me the rest of the time! Some days I find it really hard if I&apos;m feeling a bit ill/tired/stressed about other things and I was having one of those days when I did my last post!

hi AN and others - really good to read you and others - great advice re concentrating on arts rather than crafts misfit. my DD has always got on much, much better with painting than with the hideous, hideous little kits which still make me SWEAT when i see them - even though at nearly 8 she is mostly fine with that sort of thing now - even&lt;&lt;gasp&gt;&gt;the dreaded SEWING! hang on in there AN. it IS loving to be setting boundaries and not to be giving into unacceptable behaviour, it certainly is, don&apos;t let yourself believe anything different. you are making sure you have lovely times with your DD to balance out the tough times and things will get better with age. it is really important to be able to say a firm NO to our children - too many of us have not mastered this skill (took me years!!). to give you hope - i can&apos;t believe how much better 7 is than 5 (and certainly 4 and 3). we get a fair amount of backchat and flouncing around but mostly things are tons, tons better, and her quirky side is entertaining and endearing rather than wearing me down into the ground as it used to. you are doing a really good job in exceedingly testing and challenging circs - things will improve slowly and one day you will consider (as i now do) the occasinoal very tricky day and think - wow - haven&apos;t had a day like this for some time now. they don&apos;t disappear but they do get more and more spaced out (until the teen years of course ) - good luck AN am thinking of you!

Hi there, really hoping someone might be able to give me some advice as i&apos;m starting to feel like there&apos;s something I&apos;m not doing right!

I think my 2 1/2 year old might be what you would call&quot;spirited&quot;, although I start to doubt myself and wonder if i&apos;m not patient enough or too boring for my active toddler!

To give an example of my day with him:

Woke up and watched cartoons for 5 minutes then was bored and sitting by the front door wanting to go out. Got ready quickly and took him to a soft play session to try and burn some energy. After 10 minutes he was moaning wanting to go home and wanted to be carried around and was bothered by all other children and getting aggresive towards some and screaming at them. I managed to make him stay 45 minutes pretending I was a monster after him, going on everything with him just to get my£5 worth and putting up with constant moaning throughout.

Arrived home, he wouldn&apos;t eat much so got as much down him and took him up for a lunchtime nap (he was irritable and rubbing eyes so knew he was tired). He resisted sleep for 1 1/2 after throwing stuff down the stairs, screaming, throwing himself on the floor several times hurting himself. I put him back in to bed many times and eventually he&apos;ll stay there but still screaming and kicking the wall. After 1 1/2 hours I have to say I give up because by that time if he sleeps he&apos;ll be up until very late and i&apos;ll have the same issue at bedtime.

Went for a walk into town. First shop i&apos;m in he&apos;s screaming, trying to pull anything off shelves. (I don&apos;t shop very often, only absolute necessities).

Took him to the park, he played for 15 minutes then he wanted to be carried around and goes mad if I put him in the buggy and will scream the whole walk home because I wont carry him.

Bedtime is then 5.30pm because he&apos;s so tired and I really can&apos;t take any more! My mum always says I am mean putting him to bed so early, but I feel down from such a bad day. I try and hug him before bed and have&quot;us&quot;time but he does not want to be hugged. In fact he never accepts affection. The only time he wants a hug is when we are out and i&apos;ve got the buggy and he wants to be carried.

Some people comment that he&apos;s a live wire or quite demanding. I feel upset that they have spent the morning doing housework because their children will watch T.V and play, then they have coffee with a friend. I cannot ever go to a coffee shop and restaurants are a nightmare too.

Has anyone had a similar experience and know what is the best action to take. I don&apos;t have any other children so he does get love and attention. I have started putting him in nursery 3 mornings a week for the past 3 months. He screams and cries on the journey to nursery and is always saying he doesn&apos;t like nursery. I just can&apos;t handle 5 days a week with him any more and I&apos;m looking for a job because I feel like maybe i&apos;m not doing something right and perhaps a nursery would do a better job, even though i&apos;ve always been anti-nursery and wanted to be a full time mother.

Will appreciate any advice! Thanks

I don&apos;t shout very often at all - maybe once a month I raise my voice and even then it&apos;s only for a min or so. I prefer to stay calm and talk to her how I would like to be talked to. I think you need to be careful as one day soon she will start to shout back at you and there will be great shouting matches. Is there any way you can try and be calmer? Use time out if you are going to blow a fuse. Maybe read up on a book called toddler taming?
