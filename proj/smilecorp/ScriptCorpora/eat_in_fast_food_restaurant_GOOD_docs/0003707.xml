 07/12/2012 

 0 Comments 
   The music for today is a nice, chill, bass heavy song by Paper Diamond called &quot;Time Flies.&quot; Paper Diamond enlists the help of Russ P for vocals and the whole thing comes out great. There&apos;s a lot of buildup in this one with smooth drops and heavy bass. It has the signature Paper Diamond sound with an electrohop feel that makes him stand out on his own with this songs.

 Dallas woman owes $179,596.43 in unpaid highway tolls 

 07/12/2012 

 0 Comments 
   I never knew that paying these was strictly voluntary. The North Texas Tollway Authority has released a list of the worst offenders who have the most unpaid tolls, and some of them are absolutely absurd. A Dallas woman topped the list with $179,596.43 in unpaid tolls, meaning she had to blow through the tolls without paying 8,366 times. That&apos;s the biggest fuck you I&apos;ve ever seen in the history of highway tolls. Also on the list are 21 other drivers who have bills over $100,000. Since the NTTA lacks police power, getting people to actually pay the tolls proves a bit difficult.

I went through a toll once in Mass., which I&apos;m not even sure I actually did, and I couldn&apos;t do anything. Need to register your car? I don&apos;t think so. Need to renew your license? Nope. Need to take a shit? Not without paying the fine. Drive through a toll once in Mass. and your life turns into a living hell, because only the owner of the vehicle is responsible. That&apos;s the easiest way to go about it; leave everything as far as information and fines in the hands of the owner and everything will resolve itself. If somebody borrows my car and runs through a toll they&apos;re going to die if they don&apos;t pay that fine. Highway Transit doesn&apos;t even have to worry about anything, people will pay their fines with the blood of their friends.

 TL;DR In Texas paying for tolls obviously isn&apos;t a requirement as one woman racked up over $170,000 in fines.

   Pictures made funnier with words. I&apos;m also in the process of looking for something to do the photo editing with since my software just disappeared for some reason, so bear with me. At least you can still read the captions, stop yelling. Posted by Atkins under Caption This Add Comment   
 Americans on Twitter have decided who likes church and who likes beer 

 07/12/2012 

 0 Comments 
   This is the age of information that&apos;s entirely useless but we still need to know, so when we need to know things like who likes church and who likes beer, we can compile that data. Data for tweets containing either the words &quot;beer&quot; or &quot;church&quot; were compiled into a database by area. From the map you can see that clearly the South is all about church, the North is all about beer, and nobody cares about the Midwest so they don&apos;t even matter. This makes perfect sense when you think about where Democrats and Republicans come from. Obviously Democrats are alcoholic heathens.

This makes me proud to be from Boston because apparently all we care about is beer and we have to let everybody know that we&apos;re drinking it. I&apos;ve been to the South before and I&apos;m fairly sure that the only reason they talk about church more is because they don&apos;t know how to use technology yet. If they understood the concept of Twitter then the amount they talk about beer would break the internet. You&apos;ll never see as many drunks as you will if you travel down South. Those are serious drunks too, not the bros you see in Boston who can&apos;t handle their alcohol.

 TL;DR I&apos;m not sure if Massachusetts drinks the most beer but we certainly can&apos;t wait to talk about it.

 Guy gets into an accident and flips through the sunroof, somehow survives 

 07/12/2012 

 0 Comments 
   I&apos;ve never been in any horrific accidents because I&apos;m a good driver. The guy in the video probably doesn&apos;t have the same skill set as he crashed his car through the front gardens of properties in Dudley, West Midlands. I&apos;ve seen some impressive car crashes before, and while this might not take the cake it&apos;s definitely a good one. I&apos;ve never actually seen a person flip out of their sunroof before and be completely fine like nothing happened. Either he&apos;s very limber or was very drunk.

Out of the entire thing he should be thanking whoever he needs to thank that the car didn&apos;t roll on top of him. That video could have gone from amusing to horrific really quick if you had to watch a person be crushed to death by a two ton vehicle. Needless to say I&apos;m a little upset that there&apos;s no video leading up to the crash. Was he driving like a maniac and lose control of the car or was he just texting and smashed into a wall because everybody keeps telling me that&apos;s what happens when you text and drive? These are need to know facts.

 TL;DR A guy crashed his car through some gardens only to flip out of the sunroof at the end.

 Woman kept a dead guy around for 18 months to watch NASCAR with her 

 07/12/2012 

 0 Comments 
   I guess a dead guy is the only one who could really appreciate NASCAR. Everybody gets lonely from time to time, it&apos;s just the human condition, but Linda Chase of Jackson, Mich. became way more lonely than I&apos;ve ever heard. For the past 10 years she lived with a man by the name of Charles Zigler. One day Zigler passed away though and Chase never told anybody about it or even had him buried. She propped him up in his chair so she would have somebody to talk to and watch NASCAR with, for 18 months.

First of all I don&apos;t think NASCAR is near good enough to even consider watching it with a dead guy. If it was football I might be able to understand, but watching cars drive around in a circle for hours on end just doesn&apos;t do it for me. If this story tells you anything it should tell you how crazy NASCAR fans are. Sure football fans might stab each other over their favorite teams or baseball fans might start riots, but at least they&apos;re not hoarding dead people.

 TL;DR A woman kept a guy who was dead for 18 months so she wouldn&apos;t be alone.

 Women I may want to marry

   Finding pictures of girls early in the morning makes the day so much easier to get through. It&apos;s something about imagining that if I were to talk to them they wouldn&apos;t laugh in my face. I know better though, I&apos;ll just stick to finding them online. Posted by Atkins under Women To Marry Add Comment
