 The 11 Greatest Fast Food Fights and Freakouts Caught on Video 
 by Brandon Wenerd on August 11, 2010 at 5:05pm - comments Bro Not Bro Bro Not Bro 
 

 

 

Yesterday we got a few chuckles from security camera footage of a drunk women losing her marbles at a McDonald&apos;s drive thru when she found out Chicken McNuggets weren&apos;t on the breakfast menu. It&apos;s further proof of a credo we&apos;ve long held to be true: Fast food brings out the worst in people, and the calories and artery-clogging deep-fried foods are merely the tip of the iceberg.

 

More often than not, fast food restaurants serve as boxing rings for customer confrontations, meltdowns, and heated outbursts. These shrines and sanctuaries dedicated to scarfing down pattie after pattie of processed meat and superized Diet Coke have the Hulk-like ability to provoke deranged, confrontational hysteria in certain members of the human species. Here are 11 videos of people who simply weren&apos;t &quot;lovin&apos; it&quot; and chose to have it their way by actin&apos; a fool, freaking out, and fighting. 



 

 Women Smashes Drive-Thru Over Chicken McNuggets 

 Fast Food Joint: McDonald&apos;s

 What Went Down: On the morning of New Years Day, Melodi Dushane of Toledo, Ohio, went into a drunken rage after she found out her neighborhood McDonald&apos;s wasn&apos;t serving McNuggets for breakfast. She shattered the drive through drive-thru window and punched an employee during the outburst, which earned her 60 days in the clink. [via Huffington Post ]

 

  

 Royal Rumble in a Saudi Arabian Fast Food Chain 

 Fast Food Joint: Al Baikin Fried Chicken in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia

 What Went Down: The kitchen staff at this chain didn&apos;t take kindly to this patron at an Al Baikin fried chicken chain in Saudi Arabia, which erupted in a chair-throwing melee.

 

 

 Pregnant Women Fight Club
 

 Fast Food Joint: Burger King

 What Went Down: The classy pegnant ladies who caused a viral sensation in mid-July were fighting in a Burger King parking lot in East Oakland.

 

 

 A Behind-the-Counter Altercation with the Manager
 

 Fast Food Joint: McDonald&apos;s

 What Went Down: The story behind this short, 12-second video -- at least according to YouTube -- is that an aggressive customer allegedly tried to order food five minutes before a Boston-area McDonald&apos;s closed. After a verbal confrontation, the irate manager allegedly pulled the aggressor behind the counter and, as you can tell, demonstrated to this patron what &quot;closed for business&quot; really means.

 

 

 &quot;I Want My Chicken!&quot; 

 Fast Food Joint: McDonald&apos;s

 What Went Down: After waiting a half hour, a large man loses his cool over his chicken.

 

 

 


 Woman Throws a Temper Tantrum 
 

 Fast Food Joint: McDonald&apos;s 

 What Went Down: On Dec. 27, 2009, Alesha McMullen pushed over three registers, threw a sign, and chucked a water container at the cashier of a Kansas City McDonald&apos;s, all because she was &quot;unhappy with her cheeseburger.&quot; According to KDSK , $3,000 in damages resulted from the incident.

 

   

 The Blockheads Brawl 

 Fast Food Joint: Blockheads, New York City 

 What Went Down: Sure, Blockheads isn&apos;t technically  fast food. But the popular margarita and burrito joint might as well be Taco Bell caliber when incidents like this brunch-time brawl break out in mid-day and spill into Third Avenue. The best part of the video is toward the end, when the guy declares he&apos;s not paying for the meal. That&apos;s called having it your way.

 

   

 Chicken McNugget Emergency 

 Fast Food Joint: McDonald&apos;s 

What Went Down: Last March, Latreasa L. Goodman of Florida called 911 three times to report a dubious &quot;emergency&quot;: McDonald&apos;s was out of McNuggets. When police showed up at the restaurant to resolve the issue, she exclaimed, &quot;This is an emergency. If I would have known they didn&apos;t have McNuggets, I wouldn&apos;t have given my money, and now she wants to give me a McDouble, but I don&apos;t want one,&quot; reports the Smoking Gun . The Fort Pierce 5-0 didn&apos;t agree and issued her a citation. Amazingly, this isn&apos;t the first or last time someone in Florida has called 911 over over a botched fast food order. 

 

   

 Man Punches a Teenage Girl for Line Jumping 

 Fast Food Joint: McDonald&apos;s 

 What Went Down: Last year, a man thought a girl cut in front of him at a McDonald’s restaurant in South Los Angeles. In a fit of rage, he punched the 16-year-old girl and fled the scene. This bastard is still at large and has yet to be brought to justice.

 

   

 The McSucker Punch Deluxe
 

 

 Fast Food Joint: McDonald&apos;s 

 

 What Went Down: While waiting for his meal, an innoncent old man gets an extra serving of supersized pwnage when, out of the blue, another customer decks him in the jaw.

 

 

   

 &quot;Cheeseburger Josh&quot; 

 Fast Food Joint: Whataburger  

 What Went Down: The Whataburger in Austin, Texas, will never be the same after Cheeseburger Josh asked for a cheeseburger, resulting in a minor row on the floor and an epic viral video. &quot;Fuck you and your cheeseburger, motherf*cker. I will beat you all over your french fries&quot; may be the funniest fast food fighting words of all time.
