Nothing better than a food article after todays Asuka fun n games.

So we&apos;ve taken a look at KFC and Mc Donalds in Japan so that leaves Wendy&apos;s. So whats it like then?

Its actually quite nice. There are not a lot of Wendy&apos;s in Tokyo and they dont advertise on TV at all - which means no commercial to show you.
Wendy&apos;s full menu here which includes Teriyaki Burgers.

The fries were well done, burger was nice and the bar-bee-que chicken actually tasted better than what KFC had to offer.

I remember there being a Wendy&apos;s in Piccadilly back in London but I think it closed down. I wonder why Wendy&apos;s don&apos;t seem to be as popular as McD&apos;s or KFC. Is it popular where you are?

I&apos;m not going to cover Burger King because we don&apos;t have any - competition was too fierce for them and they pulled out of Japan.
UPDATE: Looks like Burger King came back - thanks to sulk for the correction. I guess I will have to go and check them out before they decide to leave again ^^;
