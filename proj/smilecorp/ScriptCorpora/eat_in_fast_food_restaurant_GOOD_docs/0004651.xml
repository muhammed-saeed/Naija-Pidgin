&quot;We tried this restaurant the first time. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was also very good.
The only thing I missed, was some pictures on the menu, so that it is easier to order and to see, what you get. 
We definitively will be back.&quot;

Cookout at S. Tryon
 
I can&apos;t find the specific location that I wished to address, but maybe the word will get to the owners of the CookOut on S. Tryon St. I visited there today with a complimentary coupon in hand following another visit in which the burger was so poorly wrapped in a bun that was too small that it ruined the white blouse I was wearing. It was also cooked to death!
I ordered onion rings along with another burger today only to get home to find 4 small rings in the box. It was a paltry meal that hardly inspired my business after an already bad experience..

I&quot;m done wth Cookout ---at that location in particular. There is no need to respond to me. I simply feel better knowing that someone knows I&apos;m done!

Disappointed
 
Went to a New Cook Out on Sardis rd in Charlotte NC Was charged $8.26, which is not the point, for 2 reg burgers and 2 fries. The burgers were very small with 1 small slither of lettuce and I was given 2 huge servings of fries. I could have gone next door to burger king and gotten 2dblcheese burgers and 2 fries for $4.00. The burger from cooko0ut was gone long before the fries and was very small and dry. I am very disappointed! I expected more, i feel cheated and will tell everyone about my bad experience.

Cookout on Sardis Road. The people there are very friendly and appear to love what they do! The food is great, and the excellent customer service just takes it right over the top.
