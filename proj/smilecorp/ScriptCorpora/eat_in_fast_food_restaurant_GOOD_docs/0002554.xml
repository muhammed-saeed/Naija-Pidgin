APPENDIX A: NUTRITION EDUCATION RESOURCE LIST

Nutrition education curricula and print, audiovisual, and
computer-based materials are available from government agencies,
voluntary organizations, corporations, and commodity organizations.

State Nutrition Education and Training Program coordinators can
help schools identify the most appropriate nutrition education
curricula and materials. National clearinghouses that can help
schools identify a wide range of nutrition education and school
food service resources are sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture&apos;s Food and Nutrition Information Center and the
National Food Service Management Institute; the former also serves
as a lending library.

APPENDIX B: YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM AND SCHOOL
HEALTH POLICIES AND PROGRAMS STUDY

In 1990, CDC established the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance
System to help monitor progress in attaining national health and
education objectives by periodically measuring the prevalence of
behaviors in six health risk categories. These behaviors, which are

usually established during youth, contribute to the leading causes
of death and disease in the United States. Dietary behaviors are
one of the six health risk categories. CDC conducts the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey (YRBS) biennially in a national probability sample
of high school students and enables interested state and local
education agencies to conduct the survey in comparable probability
samples in states and cities (127). The specific dietary behaviors
and attitudes monitored by the YRBS include consumption of fruits
and vegetables, consumption of foods high in fat, perceptions of
body weight, and attempted weight loss and weight-loss techniques
used. The YRBS also obtains information about specific physical
activity behaviors.

In 1994, CDC conducted the School Health Policies and Programs

Study (SHPPS), which is a national study of school policies and
programs at the school, district, and state levels that support
comprehensive school health programs. The study also provides
baseline data on national health and education objectives that can
be attained through school health and physical education, school
food service, and school health services and policies (229).

SHPPS included a mail survey of local and state education
agencies&apos; policies related to school health in grades kindergarten
through 12. The survey was conducted in all states and in a
nationally representative sample of districts. The study also
included on-site, structured interviews with school principals,
health education teachers, physical education teachers, school food

service directors, school nurses, counselors, and other personnel
in a nationally representative sample of middle schools and high
schools. The questionnaire included the following: school nutrition

education requirements for students; the content of nutrition
education curricula; training and joint activities of food service
staff and teachers responsible for nutrition education; school
policies related to foods sold in vending machines and for
fundraising; food service practices related to purchasing and
preparing food; involvement of parents, staff, and students in
planning food service meals; and involvement of fast-food or food
service management companies in school meals.

Single copies of YRBS and SHPPS reports are available from
CDC&apos;s Division of Adolescent and School Health, National Center for

Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Mailstop K-33, 4770 Buford Highway,

NE, Atlanta, GA 30341-3724; telephone: (770) 488-5330.

APPENDIX C: SELECTED SCHOOL-BASED STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE HEALTHY
EATING

Different, developmentally appropriate activities are listed
for lower elementary school, upper elementary school, and middle
and high school students (194). This list is not intended to be
comprehensive. However, it does include many of the concepts
critical to improving the diet and health of young persons in this
country. Schools should review these educational activities in
relation to their students&apos; needs and abilities to determine which
activities are appropriate at each grade level.

Interventions that promote healthy changes in eating behaviors

need to target three interacting spheres of influence: (a) the
environment, which influences the likelihood that healthy eating
behaviors will be adopted through social norms, influential role
models, cues to action, reinforcements, and opportunities for
action; (b) personal characteristics (e.g., knowledge, attitudes,
beliefs, values, confidence in one&apos;s ability to change eating
behaviors, and expectations about the consequences of making those
changes); and (c) behavioral skills and experience, which are
related to selecting or preparing specific foods, dietary
self-assessment, and decision-making (186, 194,203,204).

The strategies listed here require the involvement of
teachers, administrators, food service personnel, other school
staff, and parents (194). Classroom teachers play the lead role in
most of these activities, but many activities would be most
effective if they were reinforced by other persons; all adults in
the school community can help by serving as role models. Each
school or district should determine the policies it needs to guide
its nutrition-related activities and who is responsible for the
tasks.

For lower elementary students

Strategies to make the food environment more health-enhancing

 
Make healthy foods (e.g., fruits, vegetables, and whole grains)
 widely available at school, and discourage the availability of
 foods high in fat, sodium, and added sugars.
