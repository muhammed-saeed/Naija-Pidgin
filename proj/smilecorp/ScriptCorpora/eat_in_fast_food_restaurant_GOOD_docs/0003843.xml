 If the food tastes terrible, the service is less than desirable and the hygiene of the staff even worse.. if you have to dodge roaches to get to the fork you might want to consider finding another place to eat.

My Grandmother is strange. She goes to the restroom before eating. The cleanliness of the restroom determines whether or not she&apos;s going to eat there or not. She used to be a fast food restaurant manager when she was younger. She always said that you could tell almost everything about a place by the way they kept their facilities in order. It&apos;s something I tend to do every now and then.. unless I personally know the restaurant is reputable.

Your grandmother is a smart lady. I&apos;ve never done that .. but I think it&apos;s a great idea.

 Mismatched silverware. I know, I know, it&apos;s petty. But, if I get a set of silverware with a fork, spoon and knife with different handle designs, it shows that the proprietor of the restaurant does not care about details and isn&apos;t trying. And, if there&apos;s one thing that I want to know when someone else is cooking my food, it&apos;s that they care about details and are interested in making me happy.

Oh good points Nightkeeper!
I notice the silverware too. It also bugs me when it&apos;s all bent up and difficult to use!

Oh yeah, totally agree there. I will be the dick that asks for a new fork if mine has bent tines.

 A couple of factors measure in, and a &quot;good&quot; restaurant is a preferential topic yet there are fundamentals that are standard across all borders. The restroom, the staff, attention to detail, the customers who are dining and critic reviews..

 i&apos;d have to say.. the restroom is dirty..

because a teacher of mine told me that a friend of hers would often have to go to the bathroom while having been in the kitchen to deliver food. and noticed that the cleanliness is often the same in restraunts..

judge a restraunt by its utilities.
