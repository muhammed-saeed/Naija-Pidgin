I am a Pollo Tropical fan.  I tried this location for the first time, and when I walked in, I noticed that it crowded.  In spite of the line, I decided to wait.  The line moved quickly and employees were efficient.

I highly recommend the new TropiChop that costs $3.99 w/o soda, or $4.99 w/ soda.  You can add brown rice for no extra charge.  Props to Pollo for offering this healthy and tasty option!

I never thought I would say this, but I think I found my favorite fast food restaurant . . . Pollo Tropical. This place carries many Caribbean staples, and at least everything I tried was tasty. I ordered the roast pork platter with the following sides: boiled yucca, fried plantains, and black beans. Que rico!

It&apos;s a good place to go if you&apos;re in the mood for some quick Cuban food. Their maduros and black beans are my favorite!! They always tend to give more food if you eat it there.

The food is great. The service is just ok, most of the time the person taking your order doesn&apos;t speak english which can be annoying. Also one time I went they had no chicken... Go figure no pollo at pollo tropical but over all a 3 star. Enjoy and its always packed so good luck at the drive-thru.

Well by the looks of the other review this must have been the one I went to. When I switched my order to go the help gave me a mad stink eye worse than Vince Offer from the Shamwow Commercials. The food was alright, the black beans were more like black bean soup, the rice was soft, the chicken was ok, the yuca was very bland. I really have had better, but I guess the prices were ok at 5$ for a full meal.

This Pollo Tropical makes the whole chain look really bad. The service came with an attitude. The order was incorrect. The soda machine only served seltzer water and the ice was piled up so high in the spill tray there was no room for your cup. The food was old and cold. Not to mention that the floors and tables were sticky. But, for some reason the place is always packed. I just don&apos;t get it.

Pollo tropical serves what you pay for. It&apos;s not as bad as people say it actually taste good..and it&apos;s always pack b/c it&apos;s so darn cheap! Small tropichop is good. This place is meant for good cheap meals... Stop over exaggerating it&apos;s goodness in the ratings :)
