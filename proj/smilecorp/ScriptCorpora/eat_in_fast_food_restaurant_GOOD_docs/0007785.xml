 Longhorn 

 3014 E. Colfax, Denver, CO 80206 

 (303)
 393-2900 

 Map 

      

 Longhorn is what might best be considered a local neighborhood bar, with a
couple twists. There is a bar, a pool table room, and a patio, which is
accessed up a flight of stairs. Don&apos;t go expecting strippers any longer -
I have been informed they no longer have performances. It used to actually be a
lot of fun, as far as strip shows go... 

 It is typically an older crowd, pretty much all the time, with lots of
regulars. Any other day of the week, it is pretty slow. No TV, but
there is a cd jukebox. Bartenders have not traditionally been the
friendliest to strangers, but it could just be me.....  

 I will admit it has been awhile since I
last spent time any time here, so please look for an update soon! 
 
 The
 Wrangler 

 17th and Logan, Denver, CO 

 (303) 837-1075 

 Map 

 

 The Wrangler is famous for its huge Sunday beer bust. By 5 p.m., the
place is packed, with a very all-age group. 

 The Wrangler has a large bar as you enter, and is fairly
 low lit. There
is seating all around the bar, with a couple of video monitors that play any
number of things, such as videos. As you go to your right, at that end of
the facility is a dance floor - something new as of this past year, which is
fairly large, by Denver standards. The Wrangler crowd is not one you would
usually find guys dancing, so is somewhat of a irony. 

 As you continue walking as you enter, you will encounter a long
hallway. You turn to the right, and there is a pool table room - very
small. Continue walking, and you will enter another room, this one is
quite dark. It has another bar, with a very friendly bartender. It
also has lots of nooks and crannies, for exploring your darker side...You can
then reenter the main bar from here. 

 I have not been there too often any other day of the week, so am unaware of what
business is like otherwise.   

 Parking in lot north of the bar
 is OK after 5PM, all day Saturday and Sunday.  
 
 Charlie&apos;s 

 900 E. Colfax, Denver, CO 

 (303) 839-8890 

 Map 

      

 Charlie&apos;s is the token country bar of Denver. You like your men in
cowboy hats, boots, and wranglers, and can&apos;t resist a two-step, this is your
place. I must say, though, I am not
into country, yet find it a pretty cool place. Thursday is the day that
really packs them in, with cheap drinks.  

 As you enter, there is a large bar,
with pool tables to your immediate left. To the right, and forward, is a large dance
floor, which you typically enter through a glass door. This is the &apos;country&apos;
area. Recently Charlie&apos;s made some major changes to the way it operates, and
made the &apos;country&apos; area/dance floor its own little area. As you enter it, to the
left is a bar, straight ahead is the dance floor. Up some steps and to the right
the is a large outdoor patio. If you continue to wrap around the dance floor,
there is a small bar, and on the other side is some seating. 

 Back out in the main area, instead of
going to your right, walking straight ahead and a bit to the left, down a set of
stairs, is another bar. This is the major change - it used to be primarily
dining here. Now there is another smaller dance floor that plays dance/club
music. This areas gets quite packed on Thursday, due to its smaller area. 

 Mondays is another busy day at
Charlie&apos;s. It&apos;s karaoke night, at the small dance floor, and mailbox night, and
they play top 40 on the dance floor that is usually country. 
 
 The
Grand - Closed 

 538 E. 17th Ave, Denver, CO 80203
Open Daily: 3:00pm-2:00am 
 (303) 839-5390 
 

      

 The Grand is the piano bar of Denver.
Very comfortable place to sit and listen to music, talk and watch a fireplace.
Pool table in a back room. Very large outdoor patio that is filled with people
during the summer. This is the place to take your breeder friends when they are squeamish
about going to a gay bar. 

 Friday night is the big night here,
although any night is a good night. 
 
 JR&apos;s 

 777 E. 17th Avenue @ Clarkson St.,
 Denver, CO 

 (303) 831-0459 

 Map 

 

 The stand-and-model bar in the
city. No dancing, but lots to look at if you go. 

 Two floors. The first has a large bar,
and lots of room to stand or sit. Upstairs opens so you can see the bar on the
first floor. There is also a large screen that plays any number of things, like
videos, or Queer As Folk showings. Upstairs has another bar, pool tables, and a
large outdoor balcony. 

 Wednesdays and Fridays are the big
days, if you like crowds. 
 
 Compound 

 145 Broadway, Denver, CO 

 (303) 722-7977 

 Map 

      

 One of the first clubs at which I
danced before I moved to Denver, the Compound is somewhat similar to the
Triangle, in that it attracts all types, especially later on Sunday nights. 

 The parking lot here is entirely too
small, but luckily there seems to be plenty of street parking surrounding the
facility. No cover ever here either. But on Sunday, please do expect it to be
quite busy. 

 As you enter the long hallway in,
straight ahead you see a long bar and open area. Once you get past the ID
checker, to the left are the bathrooms and a pool table. If you follow the bar
area, there is seating all along it, as well as at tables along the wall that
face the bar. This is the portion of the bar that is open 7 days a week.  

 To enter the dance floor area, you will
take a right immediately after you get ID&apos;d. Through the doorway, you will see
the lights and sounds of the dance floor to your left, and another large bar
area to the right. While the dance floor is fairly small, you can expect it to
be packed on Sundays, with a good DJ, and a very dark setting, it&apos;s a good place
to have fun. I know there is dancing Friday - Sunday, am unsure of other days of
the week. 
 
 Boyztown (formerly The Brig ) 

 117
Broadway, Denver, CO 

 (303)
777-9378 

 Map 

      

 While I have not spent much time frequenting this place, I
always refer to it as the stripper bar, as every time I have ever stepped foot
in the place, there have been strip shows. It is a very small bar, so when it
gets busy, it can be a very &apos;friendly&apos; place, if you know what I mean. They also
have a large patio in the back, which you can see in the photo to the right,
above. 
 
 BJ&apos;s 

 1380 S. Broadway, Denver, CO 

 (303) 777-9880

 Foxhole 

 2936
 Fox St., Denver, Colorado 
 (303) 298-7378 

 Map 
 

      

 Update : Foxhole has done a bit of remodeling, and has
made the indoor portion more dance-friendly. However, alas, they also torn down
what I really enjoyed the most - the balcony, from where there was always a
breeze, and you could peruse the crowd. I can only hope the owners might see
this and reconsider its recreation! 

 Foxhole, formerly known as The
Centerfield, was the very first place I visited the very first time I came to
Denver. The former owners, Doug and Grant, made me feel so welcome it was about
the only place I hung out at until they sold it November of 2001 (dammit!).  

 Today it is known as the Foxhole, and
is the hottest place of all places to go the one day it is busy - Sunday
afternoons (during good weather). That reason being that it has a HUGE outdoor
area. In fact, even the dance floor is outdoors. 

 You&apos;ll wonder where the heck this place
is, if you dare to try to find it on a map. Go to Mapquest and locate it, then
also know it is located right by Coors field. Once you get close, just follow
the cars, there is nothing else close by, so trust me, following others is a
good thing. 

 No cover here either, but expect very
long lines if you get there anywhere near 5 p.m. Once you get ID&apos;d, to the right
is where you access the outdoor area. Once outside, to the right is a large BBQ,
where you can buy burgers and/or brats. Following the flow of people out, you&apos;ll
see a large dance floor to the right. Straight ahead is a raised platform, where
there are umbrella tables. To the left, you&apos;ll see access to a bar. A little further
straight ahead and to the left, you&apos;ll see stairs, which lead to an
upstairs patio area. This is a great place to go to get a lay of the land, and
to watch your favorites boys (or girls). 

 The inside is much smaller than the
outdoor area, although a nice place to hang if it&apos;s not too hot outside. There
is a pool table, and lots of seating. 

 Parking is nuts here, although funny
enough, there is plenty of it. It will look (as in the pictures above) as if
there is a baseball game going all. You&apos;ll know, however, it&apos;s just a bunch of
boys and girls having a great time!

 Map 

      

 This bar/club, which is located in the
middle of nowhere, is the one gay club dedicated to Latinos, and those who love
them. There is usually a cover only on Saturday nights, and it varies.  

 Upon walking in, there is a pool table
immediately to your right. Straight ahead is the bar, with two bartenders,
usually. Immediately to the left are some bar tables, and further to the left,
is a table-and-seats area, which us quite crowded on Saturdays, with regulars
taking most of them.  

 As you follow the bar, to the left,
there is a very small dance floor. It is acceptable during the summer, when
there is an outdoor patio to dance on. In the other months, however, is is
entirely too small - be prepared for ever polite Latinos to do the bump.  

 At the end of the bar, then to the
right, is the entrance way to the outdoor patio. This is one of the saving
graces of the club/bar. It is large, and with the gorgeous Denver summer nights,
it&apos;s a terrific place to hang with friends, or gawk at that cute boy from
Columbia... 
 
 Lesbian Bars 
 
 Detour 

 551 E. Colfax Ave., Denver, CO 

 (303) 861-1497 

 Map 

 

 I am not one to know too terribly much
about lesbian hangouts, but this one is in a very prominent place, right on
Colfax Avenue. I believe they serve food, and that is all I know!
