 June 2012 $52 We spent 1 night in this campground and it was a great place to see Devils Tower! The entrance to the Monument site is close by and you can gaze at the monument from your campsite. Staff very friendly and spaces large. The pool was not open. The highlight of the evening is when they show the 1977 movie &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; outdoors with the actual tower behind the screen. The movie was filmed at Devils Tower and the monument has a role in the movie for those who don&apos;t know about it! If you love the movie, this is the campground for you! We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 May 2012 $31 Stunning location at the foot of Devil&apos;s Tower; it doesn&apos;t get any more scenic than this. Apparently helicopter scene in Close Encounters was filmed here. Nice park, well equipped office and store, sites are roomy with full hookups. They were putting in more sites so some of the turf was dug up and still unplanted as it was early in the season. Showers and bathrooms were old and worn but functional. Strange that a lot of the shower doors were constantly locked, so you could only access two while we were there. Spacious grounds are great for wandering. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 April 2012 $20 We arrived before the park was actually open, that&apos;s why the low rate. We had a pull-through with FHU&apos;s. The roads are gravel and the sites are grass. I can&apos;t comment on the bathrooms or laundry as nothing was open. This is right outside the entrance to Devil&apos;s Tower National Monument. The whole area is beautiful. We would return if we are ever in this area. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2011 $26 We would definitely return if in the area. This is a clean well cared for park with a helpful staff. The sites were adequate. We had a severe wind storm our first night and the staff had all the downed branches and limbs cleaned up before noon the next day. Peaceful and quite with a good view of Devil&apos;s Tower from the campground. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 September 2011 $35 This was off season rates. The restaurant was closed as was the pool and the onsite gift shop was well shopped out. Sites are wide and level, lots of grass and some trees provide shade. My verizon DID work here as did their off and on Wi-Fi. There is small petting zoo here, was fun to wander over and visit and little kids would love it. The location is stunning with a view of Devils Tower from our RV and Devils Tower park entrance literally at the edge of the KOA. Access to my full hookup site was easy and the site is wide and long. There is no gas available close and the closest grocery store is 9 miles away and it is limited. Be prepared. Worked well for our stay to see the National Park. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2011 $57 We made reservations for this campground several months in advance for a stay on Labor day weekend. When I arrived, I was nearly unable to get into the facility due to a car show in their parking lot. I got nasty looks from the car show guys as I pulled in. Once in, I went to the office and signed in and paid my balance. I was then told that there was also a biker gathering here that weekend and that they would be having a live band that would play loudly until at least 2:00am. So much for their &quot;quiet hours&quot;. Since my choices were limited, I decided I would stick it out, run the A/C fans at night to drown out the sounds. But once we saw the clientele, we became worried. One allowed his dog to come to our door and bark at us. The person stopped by to get his dog and said, &quot;I hope you got sleep last night since you won&apos;t get any tonight!&quot; His T-shirt had the words &quot;Trailer Trash&quot; on it. It was then I knew a parking lot was better than this. The only good ending here is they did refund all of my money (even the non-refundable part) with no questions asked when I left (I did not spend the night), so I was not out any money. But I did need to drive back 25 miles to another campground and then go back in our toad the next day to go to Devils Tower. What bothered me the most here is that I was never told in advance that they would be a crowd / band like this and that the quiet rules were being thrown out the window. Also, it casts doubt in my mind in the family-friendly reputation that KOA projects and the premium price you pay for a KOA. If you make reservations, you may want to call and see if other events have been planned. As far as the campground, the roads were rutted in some placed from the rain. Also, if you look at the pictures on the KOA site, they are NOT all accurate as it does not look that good. We will not be coming back. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2011 $51 Two roads going into this campground. Entrance is on the left and exit is on right and neither are marked properly. Everyone does the opposite which is the way it should be. The lady that checked me in was very abrupt and bordering on rude. I am sorry it was near the end of her shift but that is not an excuse to be less than courteous. The man that replaced her was very pleasant and courteous. 50 amp was an extra 7 dollars which is outrageous. It is basically a big field with gravel parking sites. No cell phone access around the area so plan accordingly. Showers were disgusting. I could not find one clean one. Hair all over the place. YUK. Dirty floors. I would rather be without one than use them. It was quiet and dark at night. OK for an overnight stay as you don&apos;t have much choice as there is not much else around. Over priced for what they offer. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2011 $55 This park is right at the entrance to the Devil&apos;s Tower park, you can&apos;t beat the location. The spaces are easy to get into and out of. One of the men&apos;s bathrooms were flooded when we were there, but hopefully that was a temporary thing. Can&apos;t really comment on how family friendly it is because we arrived late and left early, but there were lots of kids around and they showed movies at night. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2011 $65 While Devils Tower is super impressive, can&apos;t say the same for the KOA. Pool is small and water cold, no spa. KOA is at base of mountain but blocked from view at most of the sites due to trees. Ate at the overpriced cafe and it was over $50 for 2 adult burgers (no fries), 2 kids burgers, 4 very small side salads and all the flies you can swat. They should take some of the profits and invest in fly strips. Nightly showing of Close Encounters is on a screen smaller than our living room with two small speakers and too many mosquito&apos;s. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2011 $58 Very satisfied with my stay. Arrived Wed, Aug 10 same day as Sturgis&apos; Devils Tower Run. Thousands of bikes and lots of activity. The staff performed admirably and were extremely friendly and helpful, despite it probably was their busiest day of the year. I also learned the owner had recently passed away, so again, in spite of the challenges of Sturgis and a loss to their family, their customer service was first rate. I saw this from everyone on their staff, from registration, to gift shop, to restaurant, and out helping campers. Facilities were great. High quality gift store with all you will want. Convenience store items well stocked. Restaurant opened at 7 am for full breakfast and continued through the day past dinner. They showed &quot;Close Encounters&quot; movie each night at 9 pm on the outdoor deck, in full view of the mountain. What a treat. RV sites were level and very roomy; you are not cramped in at all. Lots of shade sites. Even with all the activity outside the campground, inside was very quiet. Lots of families in rental RVs, and from other countries. Lots of friendly people to talk to. Entrance to Devils Tower is co-located with KOA. If you are visiting the Tower, this would be the place to stay. Come late afternoon, stay overnight and hit the Tower when it opens. P.S. Great ice cream, too. Well done to staff; thanks. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2011 $45 This is a great park with the best view of the Tower. The employees worked with us to ensure we had a nice shady back-in along the north edge. If you are in a tent, the tent sites are well shaded and open. The restaurant has great food and is reasonably priced. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2011 $53 There are nice, large sites. The laundry facilities were okay but two of the washing machines overflowed (we didn&apos;t put that much in) making the laundry room floor a giant puddle. The bathrooms were full of bugs but I guess to be expected based on the area but otherwise clean. The showers were okay but need to be updated and cleaned more than once a day since the campground was full. They have a small restaurant on the property. We camped here in a Tent Trailer.

 July 2011 $50 Great view of the tower. Showers had plenty of hot water. Camp store was well stocked. Staff was friendly. Lots of room between sites. Park is well maintained. Lots of bikers (bike week). We have stayed here before and would again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2011 $50 Nice KOA experience. Clean, large, wooded sites. All amenities. Kids said pool was warm but small. No fire pits where we were. Fantastic view. Even if there was no view, it&apos;s still a nice campground. Bathrooms and showers were older and in need of a makeover, but clean with lots of hot water. Tent sites were remote and beautiful. No traffic noise at all. Kids got a hoot out of watching Close Encounters. Only true complaint is that there are a lot of bikers camping here. A group left at 7 am: waking up the dead. Then at 7:15, the staff began driving around with their buggies. At 7:30, an ice-semi circled the entire camp so it could back up to the main office. Due to this and the age, I&apos;m rating it about a 7.5. We camped here in a Tent Trailer.

 July 2011 $47 Read the entire rating. Had it not been for the sewer smell, this would have been a 9 or so. The voltage, even though the park was moderately full, was fine. The park is well maintained and grassy. The roads could use a little gravel in some spots, but even after a hard rain, there were only a few puddles and a few pot holes. Maneuvering is OK...very wide. The problem is the septic system. At first, I thought the smell (which my wife and our neighbors noticed) was coming from folks not using collars as most of the travel trailers had their sewer connections hooked up full time. Then I walked around, and the sewer drain field (where the grinder and pumps are located) has a very PUNGENT odor. I had talked to the staff about checking on the folks in front of us for a sewer drain collar and he said, &quot;It is the heat&quot;. What he meant is that the drain field does NOT have enough clay cover so that the sewer gases come up. Also the manhole cover is not sealed. The smell is not an issue when there is no wind, but the prevailing wind is from the rear to the front and it blows most of the time. The view is awesome. But if you want to stay outside, then you are at the wind&apos;s mercy. As a matter of interest, the tent site area totally surrounds the drainage field. Do not know what the answer is, but the septic system really destroys a great park. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2011 $40 By far, the best stay we had this summer. Nice site, nice people running the place, and they play Close Encounters every night in the summer. You are literally at the main gate to the monument and have an awesome view. We had a nice thunder shower while we were there that cooled things off for the evening, too. There&apos;s a park for the kids to play in,and a pool. You can get a fire pit and roast some marshmallows for s&apos;mores. We had a really nice stay. The ironic thing was that we had planned to stay at another park, but the directions were terrible, and we stumbled on this one by pure accident. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2011 $54 I would give this campground an 8.5 If possible. Located right at the entrance to Devil&apos;s Tower. Level, gravel sites. Basic clean showers&amp;restrooms, heated outdoor pool, pool was clean&amp;maintained. Washing machines&amp;dryers, $1.50 to wash .75 cents to dry, machines work well! Sites are fairly large with some shade trees. Somewhat friendly staff. Campground well taken care of, no animal feces I saw&amp;we traveled with a dog. Fenced area for dogs. Communal fire pit til 9pm&amp;showings of Close Encounters of the Third Kind every night for free. Restaurant on premises was so/so very much like a Waffle House. Overall, very good stay for us. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 May 2011 $37 Wasn&apos;t maintained very well. Dog feces where in every grassed area and the staff were driving around on 4 wheelers at 6am on a Sunday. The playground was nice. Overall, I don&apos;t think we&apos;d stay there again. There was just nothing that made us want to come back. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 September 2010 $24 The main attraction for this park is that it is at the foot of Devil&apos;s Tower. Sites have good room between neighbors, sites are mostly grass with some gravel. Wi-Fi was good but dropped out during the afternoon of our arrival. Friendly staff. We arrived late in season, so some amenities unavailable. Great view of the Tower!! If in the area would stay again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2010 $25 This park is very convenient for your visit to Devil&apos;s Tower and the price to stay is right. Sites were close together and pool was not being used which was unfortunate. Fairly quiet at night even though rigs were pulling in after dark. We would stay here if we were going to Devil&apos;s Tower again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 August 2010 $40 Campground was fine. Had a great view of Tower. The staff was friendly and helpful. We stayed 2 nights, but you can see all this has to offer in about half a day. But this campground is great if the Tower is what you want to see and experience. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2010 $41 We&apos;ve enjoyed our two day stay here. The view of the monument is: monumental! We&apos;re here during the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally so there are bikers everywhere and the noise level is more than it would normally be. Our reservation was honored, we have a 50 amp pull through site that is nice. Distance to the sewer is a bit difficult. Do not experience the speeding cards previously mentioned. Maybe the motorcycles are drowning it out. Staff is VERY busy, but polite and if YOU smile, so do they. VERY quiet at night. Would return. Rate paid reflects KOA card discount.

 July 2010 $43 When we planned our overnight stop here we thought we’d wander up to the visitor’s center. But, with this view, why bother? To be at the foot of a monument such as this is quite a treat. Pull-through site accommodated our 40-footer easily, was level and with recent rains interior gravel roads were a bit rough. This is the best way to see Devils Tower. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2010 $35 Highly recommend. Great views of the Tower. Sites level, good hook-ups. Staff friendly. Shower, laundry clean. Only aside, the &quot;Close Encounters&quot; nightly movie is on a 45&quot; TV outside the store. Trees block the view of the tower. We brought our own copy and watched it with the Tower outside our window. It was great and a little spooky! We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2010 $50 This is a very shabby park and for $50 a night, they should have cable. But I guess when you are the only camp for miles you can charge anything. Obviously the view was spectacular but it didn&apos;t make up for the lack of cable, no cell phone and spotty Wi-Fi. Plus, the water pressure was extremely low but the park kept watering the grass and weeds, even after an all night rain storm. The food at the Cafe was horrid. Never order the beef tips. Plus, the employees race around the park on their golf carts at all hours. Very noisy. I would not return to this park. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2010 $50 Great location right at the entrance to Devil&apos;s Tower with a wonderful view. Not a great value for what we got, but we only stayed one night. Watching Close Encounters was fun. Showers are a bit old and dark, but ok. Restaurant was good: burgers and sandwiches. Staff was very busy, but friendly. No shade at our site. For a quick trip to Devil&apos;s Tower it&apos;s a great stop, but otherwise I wouldn&apos;t spend time here. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2010 $48 This is an amazing location and there is a lot to love about this park, so I&apos;d like to rate it higher. Unfortunately, the staff&apos;s habit of driving their golf carts through the park over and over and over at about 20 mph, with their little engines maxed out to screaming point, even at 6 on Sunday morning prevents me from giving the park a better rating. The kids loved the pool, the site was large&amp;shady. I appreciated having a convenient laundry available, though the laundry room is rather shabby and seriously needed cleaning. We&apos;d think twice about returning because of those infernal golf carts. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2010 $48 Very nice campground with lots of amenities. Level camping pads, good amount of space between RVs, clean laundry facilities, and nearly every site has a great view of Devils Tower. This campground is literally right outside the gate to Devils Tower. Staff is very courteous and efficient. The KOA office is also a gift shop, ice cream shop, gift and convenience store, and restaurant. The only complaint we would have is that the parking lot is not clearly marked for RVs/campers waiting for registration and for regular vehicle traffic, and we arrived into an area of chaos and congestion. However, to be fair, this may not be the norm since we arrived the day before the 4th of July and the KOA activity may have been exceptionally busy at that time. There did not seem to be any traffic issues when we left 2 days later. Overall, we had a wonderful camping experience here and would stay again in the future. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2010 $43 Member rate. Great location right at entrance of a national monument. Great view of Devil&apos;s Tower throughout the campground. Huge spaces. Nicely maintained and laid out. There is a large store and restaurant, and a playground for kids. Very pretty. Free &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; movie every night. Staff was VERY helpful: helped us to fix a bent part on our weight distribution hitch! Best place we&apos;ve stayed. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 June 2010 $35 I was pleasantly surprised by this park as my expectations for KOA parks is low. I thought it was very nice, visually pleasing, nicely landscaped, lots of grass, and well kept. My pull through site was good sized with good spacing between adjacent sites. Being early June, the park wasn&apos;t very crowded. The downside was no cable, no over-the-air TV, and mediocre wi-fi. I certainly could have put up my DirecTV antenna, but for two nights that wasn&apos;t a priority. The lack of cable and the so-so wifi accounts for the lower rating. I didn&apos;t use any of the ancillary facilities (restaurant, gift shop, outdoor movie theater, etc.) while there. I would definitely stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

A good campground for a day or 2, not much else to do after you see Devil&apos;s Tower. One thing is that the staff runs around on very noisy 4 wheelers and golf carts.

 June 2010 $44 The best thing about this park is the location. You are at the base of the mountain at the gate of the Monument. The views of Devil&apos;s Tower are amazing. The park is nice and clean with a rural feel to it (gravel roads, park on the grass, etc.) The staff was helpful and friendly. They have a nice playground for kids, and a pool. They do an evening campfire and every night they show the movie: Close Encounters of the Third Kind. KOA is expensive but we needed WiFi and hookups, and they delivered. Has free WiFi that was fast enough to let us do what we needed to do. We camped here in a Motorhome.

Sites were mostly level, and many had great shade trees. The atmosphere was fun, with a nightly campfire and playing of the movie Close Encounters. Although clean, the bathrooms were dated. The gravel road had potholes. Overall, certainly a great KOA and we would stay again. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 May 2010 $30 We stayed in site #3. Our site had full hook ups and a picnic table with shade from large trees. It was grass and gravel and level. There is a group campfire site down at end of row. The office closes at 5 pm so we did not meet the staff. The pool was locked. The park had a very nice playground, stores available across street since KOA&apos;s was closed. There is no TV or cable. The Wi-Fi worked very well. Only Verizon worked for us not ATT. Horse rides and hayrides available next door. The post office was next door. Devil&apos;s Tower entrance is next to park. It is very family oriented, lots of kids playing. The park shows same movie &quot;Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind&quot; every night. The bathhouses are old but work. The park also has laundry. Almost every site has an awesome view of Devil&apos;s Tower. No gas or groceries nearby-about 45 minutes away. This KOA only accepts their own card for discounts. Others we have stayed at took Good Sam or AAA. It was good for overnight and visiting park which is what we did. We camped here in a Motorhome.

You can&apos;t beat the morning and evening views. Restaurant had terrible service, but the food was edible. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 August 2009 $50 Excellent campground with an awesome view of Devil&apos;s Tower. I highly recommend staying here for the ultimate experience. They played Close Encounters on a large TV screen at dark. The pool was clean. The restrooms were clean. The toilet in the men&apos;s room was constantly broken, though. Private single showers with doors and locks were also clean. They also had a utility tub for doing dishes. Laundry facilities were adequate. This campground was very busy, so it was difficult to go to the check-in counter to ask questions. We ended up going to the gift shop to ask the cashier some questions about Devils Tower. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 August 2009 $40 We had site 23, probably the best for view of Devils Tower. We had a great time in the park: the Wi-Fi worked great and the bathrooms/laundry were older but clean. Lots of deer roam the park in the evening. The staff was friendly and helpful: loaned me a portable air compressor and hose to service tires. There are no grocery stores or gas stations nearby so fill-up and bring your food. They do have a restaurant and a small post office at the campground entrance to mail those postcards. KOA card earns a 10% discount. A great place to relax and enjoy the Tower. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 August 2009 $45 We stayed here in July 2007, and were in Site #6, which we liked. I made our Aug 2009 reservation back on June 25th, 2009 and requested #6, again. When we arrived today the lady in the office stated that Site #6 was booked. I asked for one of the sites in the row where #6 is located. We arrived at 1:00 PM, and she stated they were all booked. We looked and there was only one camper already in that row and it was in Site #7. We were staying for 3 nights, and I doubt seriously they were booked. There were only about 15 campers in the entire campground when we arrived. The campground is at the base of Devils Tower, so good location, but we will not stay here, again. The restrooms and showers are very old. Our hot water heater had broken, and we had to use the showers. The laundry had two working washers and 3 dryers. The sites are fairly level, but gravel. They do have pull thru sites. This park is overpriced, but, again in a great location. That all said, we will not camp here, again, because we do not like being lied to. We camped here in a Truck Camper.

 August 2009 $50 Not a good park for large dogs , we drove to Hulett (about 8 mile ) to let are dogs run around in big park they had . Very Pricey . There was sewer smell coming from public restrooms . Lots of flies in the restaurant . Laundry facilities were outdated . Long walk to dumpster . Internet was spotty at best . Beautiful view of Devil&apos;s tower from campground . Campsites were big . Nice shops in walking distance . The movie is very cool ( just bring blankets as it gets cold ). Might stay again if ever we come to visit Devils Tower , but would look to dry camp in the National park first . This would get a better rating if the price was more in line with the value of the park . We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2009 $45 We had a nice pull-through spot with plenty of shade, but there were other spots that appeared to not have much shade. There is a nice view of the Tower from the RV Park. The Park is literally right next to the Monument. You hit the entrance station to the Monument as soon as you pull out of the Park&apos;s parking lot. There is a nice swimming pool that the kids liked, and there is a nice playground for the kids as well. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 July 2009 $45 Our site by the playground was level. The staff was pleasant. The showers were individual rooms around the outside of the building, the bathrooms were clean. The view is beautiful and the campground is spread out and it has a fun store, ice cream and candy shops and a restaurant. Wi-FI worked great. We didn&apos;t have a fire pit, but a community fire was started at 7. We enjoyed the evening movie. This is a well run campground super close to Devils Tower. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 July 2009 $42 We loved this stop. Our only mistake was making this a one-nighter. So much to do and see at Devil&apos;s tower and the beauty is amazing. This stop and this park surpassed our expectations. Good facilities, great shop, restaurant, beautiful location and views. Only complaint was laundry. What a bummer they use very poorly maintained laundry equipment! Otherwise, this could have been a 9 or 10. We&apos;re coming back! We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2009 $42 A nice place but $42 is a lot to pay for a cold shower at 7:30 am. The view of the Belle Fourche Canyon and Devils Tower can&apos;t be beat. Sites are large and grassy; tent and cabin sites are right up against the canyon. Nice pool. The bathrooms get covered with bugs at night, and it would be nice if the staff spent more time cleaning them in the morning than they spend riding around in golf carts. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2009 $40 We had so much fun at this campground. The kids enjoyed an awesome playground, and there was a lot of open space for them to run around. The vicinity to Devil&apos;s Tower was perfect. Each night there was a camp fire in the &quot;big&quot; fire pit area which was nice. Also, we enjoyed watching, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; on the big screen which they show nightly. There were shops and a restaurant on site, and the W-Fi worked fine. The bathrooms were okay. We would stay again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2008 $38 Fantastic view! Many sites in this campground have a view of the tower, and those who don&apos;t may have a beautiful view of red rock cliffs or rolling hills. Big operation for such a small campground, with many staff members. Disappointments were that the restaurant on site doesn&apos;t serve dinner, and our site lacked significant shade. Located just outside the national monument boundary, so it&apos;s very convenient to the park. Cabins are all aligned so their porches face the tower - a nice touch. Bathhouses are older, but kept clean. Laundry facilities could use an update. If you need hookups and want to stay near Devils Tower, this is a decent place. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 June 2008 $32 Not one of the best KOA Parks that we have stayed at. The workers were not really friendly, and the bathrooms were old and dirty, as well as the laundry facilities. Not much of a choice to camp elsewhere as it is the only campground in the area. The KOA Website states LP Gas, which is not available, and planned activities. The only planned activities offered is an 8 pm fire ring, and a nightly 9 pm showing of &quot;Close Encounters of the Third King&quot;, both weather permitting. On the Plus side though, there are Great views of Devils Tower! We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 June 2008 $37 Great campground! I&apos;m sure it seems a it pricey, but where else can you see Devil&apos;s Tower when you come out of the shower. Right next to the entrance you&apos;re never more than a few feet from a view. Sites are the usual KOA variety, but since we camp in a pop-up the length is never a problem. The showers were great! Individual showers, where you have a shower and dressing room all to yourself. Plenty of hot water and clean. The restaurant on site is open from 7-2 and is NOT open for the evening meal. Staff was friendly and very helpful. We camped here in a Tent Trailer.

 May 2008 $19 Very attractive park with good gravel interior roads. We saved a few bucks and took a water and electric (50 amp) only back-in site. I was planning to use the dump station in the morning on the way out, but I couldn&apos;t see how we could make the turn after dumping, so we just skipped it. Down by the river there is a huge tenting and cabin area, probably five acres of well maintained grass. Excellent free Wi-Fi. Great view of Devils Tower from the park. We had planned to use the National Park campground in the at Devils Tower, but there was no way to fit a 40&apos; rig in the curved pull-through spaces there, so we just drove on through. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 May 2008 $43 Nice KOA at the base of Devils Tower, gravel interior roads and gravel/grass sites. This is the place if you want hookups and a view of Devils Tower and the red hills around the tower. We had fun exploring campground as well as Devils Tower! Lot&apos;s of deer and rabbits running around the campground. The playground was OK, and it looked like they had acquired a play structure from a fast food restaurant that wasn&apos;t assembled yet. The only downside is the price, I&apos;ve noticed that on this trip, KOA&apos;s run about $8-$10 higher than similar facilities in the same area. There is a NPS campground inside the park, that we drove through in the motorhome, but no hookups. We camped here in a Motorhome.

And they show &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; right there in the shadow of the monolyth. WOW!! That and the Thunderstorm, I thought the aliens had landed!

Restaurant serves breakfast and lunch buffet. Movie &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; is shown every night. No TV but WiFi was good. Site was partly shaded with some grass. Tenting are looked very nice. Best bet for visiting Devils Tower which is well worth the side trip! We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 May 2007 $29 Average park in a beautiful setting. No cable. No off-air TV for those that want that. Right outside the entrance to Devils Tower NP. Some tourist trap stores located across the road ($2.25 for a $.30 shaker of salt.) Showers so-so. 1st night very quiet. 2nd night a charity group started at 6 pm. Music got louder at 8pm. At 11 pm they turned the music down. At midnight organ music from a horror film! I fell asleep right after that but woke up in time for the 2 am bingo game! It ended at 2:30. Would have been nice if they&apos;d have warned us. Extremely inconsiderate of them. 10 for setting. 4 for facilities. 0 for lack of consideration and noise. Overall 1. My wife and I saw deer, fox, antelope, and turkey in the area. Still, I would think twice about staying here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 May 2007 $29 Perfect Location for Devils Tower - abuts the Tower entrance. It&apos;s early in the season and the park needs some attention - primarily not mowed. Excellent and friendly management. When we mentioned the site needed mowing - it was completed within an hour. Fairly level sites - although it took time to position the RV even with levelers. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2006 $38 Magnificent view - absolutely. Overpriced park - I think so. The park has been in the family for almost 40 years and the current, second generation owners use camper workers to operate and maintain the park. Thus, probably no mortgage and little, if any, payroll. The facilities are just adequate (full hookups, nice sites, OK pool) to disappointing (weak/sporadic WIFI, very old bathroom/laundry facility). If not for the view, this is a $25 park. This park must have one of the highest profit margins in the business. There is no indication that any of the profit is being put back into the park. They need to upgrade the facilities (new bathroom, better WIFI, and add cable) to justify charging almost $40. In 30 reviews for 2006, this is the first time I have lowered a park&apos;s rating due to price. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2006 $40 The campground is practically at the entrance to Devil&apos;s Tower NP. The campground is well-maintained and the staff friendly. There is ample space between sites, many sites have large shade trees, and almost all have a view of the tower. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and wished we could have stayed an extra day. I don&apos;t recommend that you buy the chicken dinner they offer to deliver to your campsite. Although it&apos;s convenient, the chicken isn&apos;t that great and the mashed potatoes and gravy are absolutely horrible. We were tired after driving all day and didn&apos;t feel like cooking, but should have! We camped here in a Motorhome.

 2004 $35 We only stayed one night. I specifically asked if we could have a campfire at our campsite
as we were cooking our food on the campfire and I was told by 2 employees at that time that &quot;yes&quot; we could. I asked if they sold wood to burn and I paid for 2 bundles. One employee said he would bring me the bundles of wood and asked what our campsite number was. I told him this information. When we pulled into our campsite, we noticed our sites (we were traveling with another RV) did not have a campfire ring. A few hours passed and no wood was brought so one of my party went to the office to inquire. Soon thereafter an employee walked down to our campsite 2 bundles of wood and we were told to go to an empty tent site and grab an un-used fire ring to use to burn our campfire. We did this, which I thought was strange, but the employee advised us that it was ok. Soon after we started our fire, a man on a horse and in cowboy get-up came up to us and told us to immediately put out our campfire and that we were not allowed to have campfires in that area of the campground &quot;how dare we even try such a rebelious act.&quot; This was after I told him that many different employees told us we could and that they even brought us the wood to burn! He was incredibly rude and he never identified himself as the owner/manager of the campground. After a few minutes of him continuing to badger us about the campfire, we put out the fire and my husband and my brother walked up to the office to find out what was going on. Apparently there was a huge problem with communication in the office/staff of the campground and we were eventually given a 20% credit. Apparently the reason campfires were NOT allowed in that part of the campground was because we were in the &quot;RV&quot; part of the campground and &quot;RVers&quot; do not want campfires because of the smoke caused by them. I thought this was a ridiculous excuse. This was unacceptable to me. I specifically asked about a campfire before checking in, the campground placed us where we could not have one, delivered us the wood, and then we were chastised for doing what we were told. We had neighboring campsites come up to us after this incident asking what the commotion was about. I was terribly embarassed. Whatever this campground had going for it, was completely deminished in my mind and I would not recommend anyone staying here again. We camped here in a Truck Camper. Review Rating

 2004 $40 Visited early season, May, so campground was in the process of preparing for the coming
season and not all facilities open. Only one restroom/shower building open out of two. We stayed in a Kamping Kabin for around $40/night. Very expansive
and picturesque campground with dramatic view of Devils Tower from entire campground. Appears to be only campground immediately near D.T. so probably very
busy during summer. Restroom/showers OK but could use some upgrading, especially the shower units. We camped here in a Campground Cabins. Review Rating

 July 2011 $12 A typical NPS campground. They have great locations and views, but something is always poorly done. In this case, its the fresh water spigots. They are terrible. You need a lot of force to turn them on and you must hold them on the entire time you use it. Since there is no dump station, its a real pain to fill your fresh water tank. It took me 15 minutes of painful holding the spigot on to get 1/4 tank of fresh water. What idiot picked these out of a catalog. Verizon worked fine. The sites are fairly level and a few are large enough for any rig. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

No hookups but if you go there prepared for that (full fresh water, no waste in tanks) then you&apos;ll be fine You can run your generator whenever, once its not during quiet hours (10PM-6AM?)

 July 2010 $12 Great view of Devils Tower from many of the sites in this campground. The sites are not particularly level but we managed. Restrooms have a utility sink. Water is available all over the campground (with threaded spigots some of which are convenient for RV filling). Much better than the KOA just outside the monument. Trail access from the campground.

 September 2009 $6 Beautiful campground with view of Devils Tower. The only negative remark I could make about this place is the small posts they have in the ground so that people will not drive on the grass. They can&apos;t be seen from the driver&apos;s seat. We banged up the running board of our truck. We found out another camper got their steps hung up and nearly ripped them off. In their case, the post had to be dug up out of the ground. Beautifully shady spots. Most all are pull throughs. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2009 $6 Among campgrounds with no hookups, this has to be one of the best. You can see the tower from the sites which are pull thru and can accommodate big rigs. Most sites sit under shade of huge Cottonwood trees. There are two bathrooms, but no showers. here is potable water available. We arrived mid day and got our pick of sites, by nightfall the place was full. We plan to spend 3 more nights in this scenic and pretty campground. Rate is Golden Age Rate.

 May 2009 $6 Wonderful rustic campground with pressure water faucets (threaded) and 2 bathrooms spread apart in the campground. We were in site B-7 that was near one of the bathrooms and also had a water faucet across the street from us. Nice roomy pull thru with a picnic table on a cement pad along with a pedestal BBQ nearby. Site was pretty level, gravel/dirt and wide enough for slides and awingings. We had rain and ground absorbed the moisture and didn&apos;t leave us in a mud hole. No problem getting our dome satellite in and we were able to get good cell reception but couldn’t use my Aircard even using our booster. Signal fluctuated wildly and unable to maintain a constant signal long enough to connect to any website. Partial view of the tower from our dining table and the trees and meadow were lovely too. Well maintained CG that we really enjoyed. Price reflects the half price for Golden Age Pass. We spent 6 days here and would happily stay here again if in the area. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 October 2007 $12 Arrived after dark, and it sure was nice to not have to worry about backing into a spot - all the spots are pull thrus along the loops. When we woke up in the morning, we had a fabulous view of Devil&apos;s Tower behind us. Bathhouse was clean and in good shape. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 May 2006 $10 If you can dry camp this is a delightful place, shaded by enormous cottonwoods, with large level sites easy to get into. The ambience invokes peace. The park is a long walk to the Tower and prairie dogs live in the near by field. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 July 2005 $12 No hook-ups, no showers and simple bathrooms but we really liked being so close to the monument. It made it easy for us to do the hike around Devil&apos;s Tower in the evening when it was a bit cooler. Many sites had some shade depending on the position of the sun, most were large enough for our 30 ft class A. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 May 2011 $16 Simple is the word for this CG. But the view of the &quot;Bear Lodge&quot; as the Indians call the Devils Tower, is amazing. No bathrooms, but Porta-potties are available. Wi-fi isn&apos;t very strong, but excellent Verizon coverage. Neither our GPS or phone led us to the right address, even though it&apos;s quite obvious. The beauty of the mountain is a huge, but amazing, distraction. We&apos;d come back here, for sure. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2010 $16 Good, inexpensive location for visiting Devils Tower. Electric hookups only. Water available to fill water tank when arriving. No sewer hookups and no dump station. We ate at the restaurant twice. The breakfast was very good and the hamburgers were even better. The restrooms in the restaurant were clean. The campground has two port-a-potties which we didn&apos;t check. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2009 $35 I guess campgrounds in Devil&apos;s Tower are expensive. This campground has only electric, the sites have quite a downward slant and the high price all add up to a lower rating. It&apos;s very small and we&apos;re the only people camped here tonight. I think if I were visiting this area again, I would plan my night stop somewhere else, perhaps Buffalo. Way overpriced but less expensive than the KOA at the base of Devil&apos;s Tower. I don&apos;t plan to stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2009 $35 This is a nice little family owned campground with a great view of Devil&apos;s Tower. It is not fancy, but very convenient and friendly. There is a small cafe/ restaurant on site. We had a very nice breakfast. WI-FI is available in the office and restaurant, and will soon be available at the sites. It is a very good overnight stop. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2008 $25 New park, work in progress. The owner had just put in the 30 amp electric two days before we got there. Great view of Devils Tower, less than three miles away. Very nice view of canyon behind campsites. There is a very tight turn around at the south end, unhook toad before attempting. There is a restaurant on site with free WiFi access. There is some traffic noise from 6am to about 8pm but not too bad. Owners are RV&apos;rs and very friendly. Though it lacks the amenities of the KOA it is also half the price, and doesn&apos;t require the two day stay. Will definitely stay there again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2007 $29 The sites are small. Hookups on wrong side. No 30 amp electric just 50 amps. A 30 amp adapter can be had with a $50.00 deposit. After looking over the area I chose to not stay here and got my money back. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.
