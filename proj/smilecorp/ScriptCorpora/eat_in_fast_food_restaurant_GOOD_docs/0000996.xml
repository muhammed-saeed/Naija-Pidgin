The people at the actual locations were nice and very helpful Only issue I had was I am pretty sure I left my iPod in the cab and called several times to see if they can just take a look for me and they kept saying the manager will call me wether she found it or not and I never got a call

I made the reservation a month in advance and confirmed it a week in advance and when we got there we were informed that had over booked our truck. The lady helping us started off with a very rude and defensive attitude towards us. Over an hour later of trying to figure out how to resolve this issue, we received a pick up and trailer. The next day our bank account was showing a very high amount charged. We tried to call but discovered we were unable to speak to the store, only a call center who had no idea of our history the day before. We went tithe store to learn their computers were down and they couldn&apos;t fix the problem until its fixed, which they didn&apos;t know when they was. The whole process was inconvenient, long, and extremely frustrating. I will not use that store ever again!

All readings on mileage are insert incorrectly on bill then what it really says on the truck its self. The drop off section is located on a ramp that is not leveled and it throws off the reading on the gas meter. This location just robs people out of there money.

The first truck I picked up had the check engine light on and had an obvious misfire. I returned it and they promptly gave me another vehicle. They forgot to transfer the pads I rented to the new truck. I sent my daughter down and after verifying the contract, she was given pads.

Poorly staffed. Only one person working on a weekend morning. Stood in line for over 1 1/2 hrs waiting to rent a truck. Everyone in line was frustrated.
 DAMIAN M. on 7/2/2012 Rating: 
Part of the issue was the staff had to deal with a particularly nasty customer just as I was getting there to return my equipment, but just the same, I was the secon person on line and it took almost an hour to get my equipment checked in. The actual checking in took half a minute, it just took the three people working that Lon to get to me.

I was completely dissastified with the call center. I schedlule my location for walden, and they sent me to new windsor. All of my information was taken wrong including my name and my phone number. Thank god he got my email right otherwise I never would have known my truck was in the wrong place. My saving grace was that I was given 30 extra miles to drive for going so far out of the way to even get the truck. The supervisor at the call center never got in touch with me either to talk about my issue, her name was Rebecca Gay and I&apos;m extremely disappointed that the management there didn&apos;t care enough to rectify an issue with their customer. The girl I spoke to on the phone was also extremely apathetic, I don&apos;t recall her name. If you want good relations with your customers, I would strongly advise clear, concise, and most importantly effective communication from your centers. The only person I give that credit to was misty, whom with I spoke to at the new windsor location, and she was very kind and explained a lot of what the person I made the reservation with did not explain to me. She should be accommodated.

My last van rental was a disaster. The Ford was almost brand new, however the recently installed rubber cargo mat reeked of an extremely acrid odor that permeated the vehicle and ac system. Drove vehicle 5 miles home and felt nauseous. I then returned vehicle and exchanged it for another. ( 30 min process). The second van had the same problem. 40 min. Later I drove off in a 10ft box truck because all the vans on the lot had the same problem. I am not faulting the people at the location, rather trying to point out a much larger problem with the sourcing and installation of the cargo mats. The odor they give off is beyond tolerable! Didn&apos;t need a bigger truck. I rent a van every week and was very happy with them until they all got screwed up. Hope someone has the foresight to investigate and fix this matter

No improvement was necessary for this rental. Daniel was a pleasure to work with and very professional. Although I live 10 minutes away from the other Uhaul rental in Monroe, I prefer to go to the New Windsor location because they are always so pleasant. Thank you

The young Lady who waited on me did nothing but bash her compititor, not very business like, she didn&apos;t do a walk around, she told me I had 3/4 of fuel I didn&apos;t, some man named Don I told changed it, just not the way I would do business. wouldn&apos;t rent there again. she needs to be trained more thoughly before letting her manage her store, she has a long ways to go.

That truck is shot...scary to drive...rattles and feels like it is going to fall apart.
 chris k. on 6/4/2012 Rating: 
Have more bigger trucks available
 Eugene K. on 6/2/2012 Rating: 
Staff was very helpful and courteous however there was not enough staff on check in to handle the customers. i waited for a half hour and then just unhooked the trailer myself and left.
 Judith L. on 5/29/2012 Rating: 
Only thing that would help would be if inside windshield could be cleaned. You don&apos;t notice until driving at night or in rain that it is a problem, otherwise great experience. Barbara at this location is wonderful. She is quick, competent&amp;a pleasure to deal with!!!
