Lawmen are on the hunt for Roger Rader. A 63- year old man wanted in connection with a violent incident. Kidnapping. Officers were called to a fast food restaurant February 3. They found Rader and his female victim in a car. Police say both were splattered in blood. Even more disturbing, the passenger side door was tied shut with the seat belt. Her feet were bound with a phone cord. Rader was arrested. And pleaded guilty to simple assault. Detectives later found out the woman was badly beaten suffering several fractures. Roger Rader has dodged the cops...help capture this guy and put him behind bars.

Cops are also tracking down Thedrus Greer. A 55 year old man wanted for the sexual molestation of an 8- year old child. This violator needs to be turned in. He has family in Buffalo, New York and probably fled according to detectives.

Meanwhile...a teenager is captured. 16 year old David Keyes is off the streets. He was wanted for a brazen June 8 armed robbery of a local business. Jackson Police tell us Keyes hit the business flashing a gun then made off with cash. Potentially dangerous. Yes. But not too smart. His mug was nailed on surveillance tape. Now he&apos;s a poster boy on our MOST WANTED busted list.
