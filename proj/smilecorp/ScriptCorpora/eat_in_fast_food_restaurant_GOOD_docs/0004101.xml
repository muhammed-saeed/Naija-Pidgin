 Productivity Lower Cost of Ownership Corrections Package Resource Center 
 
Meeting the needs of a growing population by increasing productivity.

There’s a population explosion in America’s correctional facilities. Many are over capacity. The resulting strain on foodservice operations means that you have to maximize the productivity of your staff and equipment to provide services above and beyond the original design parameters of your facility.

Hobart can support you in your productivity efforts. Our Advansys™ Ventless Door-Type Warewasher can perform double duty. It can clean your greasy pots and pans and your dishes and trays. A highly productive unit, the Advansys Ventless can wash 58 racks per hour with hot water sanitizing and 65 racks per hour with chemical sanitizing. Its versatility adds to its productivity. The Advansys Ventless model can handle 18&quot; x 26&quot; sheet pans and large pots. Made with a stainless steel pump and impeller, the Advansys Ventless is built to last, too, lowering the cost of ownership. And with an uptime greater than 99%, you can ensure a smooth kitchen operation.

 The Baxter Hybrid Convection Oven has
the versatility of both convection and steam heat, plus it can be preprogrammed
with up to 100 recipes. You just have to select the recipe and press “Start.”
And it all fits in a small footprint, so you can place it on a counter or stack
them on modular racks. 


For your mixing needs, you just can’t beat the Hobart Legacy® Mixer. The only mixer with a swing-out bowl for adding ingredients, taking out product and mounting and changing bowls, the Legacy is simply easier to work with, for increased productivity.

 
 

 

 
 
When everything else seems to be going up, we can help you bring down the cost of ownership.

The drive to lower costs at correctional facilities is unrelenting. One of the ways we support correctional foodservice operations is by helping you lower energy and water costs.

 The Hobart Advansys™ Ventless Door-Type Warewasher is a real money-saving machine. It uses the least water in its
class—only .74 gallons per load—and it has the Advansys-exclusive Energy
Recovery technology. It captures the water vapor and condenses it to heat the
incoming cold-water for the final rinse cycle saving $792 in energy costs per
year. Combine that with the ventless design—which eliminates $776 in HVAC
operation costs—and the Advansys Ventless can save you $1,568* per year in
energy use. 

Our other warewashers can reduce your energy and your water costs as much as 70%, thanks to our exclusive Opti-Rinse™ technology.

Traulsen has more than 100 Energy Star listed refrigeration products—including refrigerators, freezers and heated cabinets—that can trim your operating costs as much as 45%.

Our WastePro 1200 can compress your disposable waste by 88%, and it can even be set up so that the waste is deposited directly into your dumpster. These are just some of the ways we can support the special needs of correctional facilities. Hobart and Traulsen. Proud supporters of you.

 

 *Based
on 200 cycles/day, 360 days/year at an energy cost of $.011 per cycle. 
 
Hobart equipment can actually increase security.

Most Hobart and Traulsen equipment can be modified for the correctional environment. These security features help to secure components and contents. Traulsen R&amp;A Series refrigerators, freezers and blast chillers prevent unauthorized access with padlock hasps, security control covers and torx-head security screws. Our mixers, slicers and food preparation equipment include security packages with tamper-resistant fasteners, handles and knobs, as well as lockable controls. Even our dish machines can be equipped with correctional packages including lockable doors, enclosed undergrids and stainless steel conveyor belts on FTs. These machines can be built with specifications just for you. All working together to increase your peace of mind.
