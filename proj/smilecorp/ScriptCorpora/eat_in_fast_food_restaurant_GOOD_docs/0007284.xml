On the right, click on&quot;click to view and print a PDF of a helpful meal tracking worksheet&quot;. 4. Print 3 copies (change to black print only if you don&apos;t want to run out your color ink!) 5. Keep 3 days of food records by recording everything you eat and drink, including portion sizes for each individual item on the left column, in order consumed. Don&apos;t forget to also write down condiments that you add to your foods. Then transfer the foods listed into the proper food groups in the second to last column, if it falls in one. Add up amount consumed for each food group in the last column. Use one sheet per day. 6. Visually analyze your dietary intake based on the food guide pyramid recommendations. 7. You can use any 3 TYPICAL days to record your intake (they do not have to be consecutive). Make sure you don&apos;t use days when you are sick, so you can get an accurate view of your normal diet. Part 2: (50 points) 1. Install current version of the diet analysis software (version 8.0) as instructed on your syllabus (or you can use one of the selected computers in the computer lab at Valencia). Points will be deducted if version 8.0 or higher is not used. 2. Once completed, review the Quick Start Tutorial. This will be very helpful in teaching you how to use the software properly. 3. Create a profile on yourself (click on&quot;Profile: Start here&quot;on top left) 4. Once your profile is created and then selected, enter student information. Under class&quot;section&quot;, please list your class CRN number. 5. Start entering foods by clicking on&quot;Track Diet&quot;at the top. Don&apos;t forget to change the date for each day that you enter. It is best to use 3 days in a row (regardless of what the dates are). You need to make sure you analyze 3 days together. 6. You can track your physical activity if you want by clicking on&quot;Track Activity&quot;at the top. This is completely optional, but can help you if you are trying to lose weight. 7. Once all days are entered, click on&quot;Print Reports&quot;. You will then see 3 selections. Choose&quot;3 Day Average Reports&quot;. Then click on&quot;Print 3-day Average&quot;. This will allow you to view your printouts before you actually print them. You then will need to select&quot;file: print&quot;on the top left to actually print. This will give you all of the printouts you will need to turn in. Please make sure you have printed: Energy Nutrient Intake and DRI Goal Ranges Compared
Intake and DRI Goals Compared My Pyramid Analysis Complete Intake Spreadsheets (for each of the three days) 8. Complete the following worksheet by reviewing your printouts. Part 2 cannot be graded unless the worksheet is completed and turned in! 9. Please remove all blank and useless sheets of paper it sometimes prints. 10. When completed, make sure ALL papers are securely attached (in order printed), including this worksheet, by stapling if possible, or using a secure clip. Attach the worksheet to the FRONT. Part 3: (25 points) 1. Create (make up) a new&quot;healthy&quot;diet for one day using the current version of the diet analysis software as instructed on your syllabus 2. Keep editing the diet until you meet the following goals: 1 Get all vitamins and minerals between 80% and 1000% (except for sodium which should be less than 3,000mg) 2 Get all food groups between 85% and 125% of goal 3 Get calories 500 within of the recommendation 4 Get macronutrients (carbs, protein, and fat) within the recommended ranges: o Carbohydrates: 45%-65% o Protein: 10%-35% o Fat: 20%-35% 3. Print and turn in your reports like you did for the first part Under Print Reports, select&quot;Custom Average Reports&quot;Make sure your start and end date is the same (for that ONE day) Check and print ONLY the following: (uncheck all other options) Macronutrient Ranges Intake vs. Goals Mypyramid Analysis Intake Spreadsheet 4. You can view your printouts before printing by clicking on&quot;print custom average&quot;. You can then go back and keep editing until your goals are met. 5. After printing (both parts), please eliminate blank and useless sheets of paper 6. Make sure printouts for part 2 and part 3 are clearly labeled
TO SUBMIT: Make sure ALL papers are properly attached (including the directions with your name and class CRN, and the following completed worksheet) and submit. Please label each part of your project (part 1, part 2, part 3) and put them in order. Please attach ALL papers with a clip or similar item.

RECOMMENDATION
HOW YOU SCORED calories
45%-65% of calories % 10%-35% of calories % 20%-35% of calories % Under 300 mg. mg 20-35 grams grams
SUMMARY: Did you have any excesses of the above nutrients? If so, which foods contributed to the excesses? Compare the recommendation column with how you scored.
Were you deficient in any of the above nutrients? If so, which foods could you add to your diet to make up for the nutrients that were lacking?

If you have less than 80% of a nutrient or more than 400% of a nutrient, write an&quot;X&quot;in the last (out of range) column. NUTRIENT Thiamin Riboflavin Niacin Vitamin B6 Vitamin B12 Folate Vitamin C Vitamin D Vitamin A Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) Calcium Iron Magnesium Potassium Zinc Sodium mg % of DRI OUT OF RANGE
