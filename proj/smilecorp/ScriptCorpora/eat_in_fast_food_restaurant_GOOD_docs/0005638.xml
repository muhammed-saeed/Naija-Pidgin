 Food Service Retailing Salary Survey (NAICS: 722, SIC: 58, eSIC: 58-5813) 
 US National&apos;s Food Service Retailing Salary Survey reports compensation data for 126 benchmark jobs, accompanied by up to four verifying survey sources. ERI Salary Surveys is the sponsor of this 2012 participant and digitized industry-specific survey available by geographic (state or national) area. 
 The Food Service Retailing Salary Survey documents market-based pay data for 12 executive and 114 non-management salary benchmark jobs. Verifying sources include ERI&apos;s Executive Compensation Assessor and Salary Assessor (both with for-profit data). (Cost-of-living comparisons, differences, index, and differentials are available via ERI&apos;s Relocation Assessor&amp;COL Survey calculator.) Job matching is refined with PAQ’s eDOT database. Review rates of error, incumbent counts, and identified participant and digitized organizations for defensible data used by courts, the IRS, and thousands of subscribers. 
 Two pages of food service retailing information are reported for each of 126 benchmark positions, including job descriptions, total annual direct compensation, survey means, survey medians, percentiles, incentive/variable pay, graphs with data points vs. years of experience, and trended demographic estimates from ERI&apos;s Geographic Assessor&amp;Pay Survey . See ERI newsletters for other compensation issues, salary increase plan surveys, geographic salary statistics, wage differentials, executive compensation studies, and salary guides and comparisons.
