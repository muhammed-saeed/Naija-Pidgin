the injuries sustained at the hands of Byrd.

 ALERT: Bank Examiner Scam
Under Investigation 

 SARASOTA 
COUNTY, Florida [NMT] -- The Sarasota County Sheriffs Office is 
investigating a Bank Examiner scam. 



 



 Twice recently, 
two elderly females in the South Venice area were contacted by telephone 
by a male subject representing himself as a bank examiner. Both victims 
were instructed to meet a law enforcement officer at a designated location 
for instructions on how to assist in a bogus investigation to catch 
an embezzling teller. 

 Both victims 
met with the subject, who is described as a White male 50-60 years old, 
approximately 59- 6tall, average build and complexion. 

 Each victim 
made withdrawals from their bank from their own accounts for over $5,000.00 
and handed over the cash thinking they were assisting the bank and law 
enforcement. 

 Citizens 
are reminded that banks and law enforcement would never use private 
citizens to conduct such an investigation. If you are ever contacted 
by a person representing themselves as a bank representative or law 
enforcement officer and that person requests your assistance in an investigation 
into bank or teller procedures let the caller know you have heard of 
this scam and immediately report the call to your bank and/or local 
law enforcement. 

 Above is 
a composite of the suspect involved in such a scam in mid-February. 

 Anyone with 
information is encouraged to call the Criminal Investigations Bureau 
at 941-861-1719 or leave an anonymous tip with Crime Stoppers by calling

 SAR Holds&quot;Thin Blue Line&quot;
Appreciation Awards Luncheon 

 SARASOTA, 
Florida [NMT] -- A&quot;Thin Blue Line&quot;Appreciation Awards luncheon 
for local police and sheriff&apos;s departments was held by the Sons of the 
American Revolution (SAR), Saramana Chapter at the Lido Key Holiday 
Inn, Sarasota, on Friday, April 10, 2009. 

 
Above, L to R, Master Patrol Officer, Joshua Small, Bradenton Police
Department; Officer Willie Jackson, Longboat Key Police Department;
Officer Thomas Wagonseller, Sarasota Police Department; Officer
Paul Freeman, Venice Police Department; Detective Lenny Hills,

Sheriff&apos;s Office; and Sgt. William Riley, Manatee County Sheriff&apos;s
Office. Deputy Maxie Bragg, Manatee County Sheriff&apos;s Office, was
not available for this photo. At the far right is Saramana Chapter,
SAR Past President Philip Tarpley, the MC for this event. 

 The persons 
pictured above were chosen by their deeds, professionalism and dedication 
to duty. They are representative of the many thousands of officers that 
serve across our great country. 

 Over the 
years since 9-11, the thin blue line of law enforcement and the red 
and white line of firefighters has merged. The danger we suffered before 
9-11 is still present. The immediate protection and aid response provided 
by these persons that we citizens enjoy is still being taken for granted, 
SAR&apos;s Billie Lowe said in a press release. 

 They risk 
their lives more than most and yet find themselves last in line for 
pay and benefits in many communities across America. Ask the families 
how tough it is to live when a parent-spouse is permanently injured 
or killed in the line of duty. It will shock most citizens. The Sons 
of the American Revolution remember what you do for us. The luncheon 
was one way of thanking those heroes and their families for their service. 

 If you are 
a male, 18 years or older, who can trace your ancestral lineage back 
to an American Revolutionary War Patriot, the Saramana Chapter of the 
Sons of the American Revolution would like to talk with you. Contact 
New Member Committee Chair Billie Lowe at 941-792-5712 or President 
Harold Crapo at 941-756-7272 for information.

 CHARLOTTE

 The first 
incident occurred Mar. 29 when the female victim rode her bike home 
at night after work in a Port Charlotte fast food restaurant, but was 
able to lose him. 

 On April 
2 she stated a man was in the restaurant with another man, they ordered 
food, and she later saw one of the men making obscene gestures and grabbing 
his crotch in a vulgar manner from outside the restaurant. She pointed 
him out to the manager and said this was the man who followed her home 
on Mar. 29. MCU were contacted and detectives received a copy of the 
surveillance video and the victim identified the subject. 

 On April 
6, the woman was riding her bike to work and the same man approached 
her on his blue bicycle and used profanity. The victim said he stated,If you wont be with me then I will kill you,then 
left her. That night when she was riding home in a different direction, 
the man came out of nowhere and punched her in the face. She fell to 
the ground and the man got on top of her, began scratching her and banging 
her head on the ground. She stated the man then tried to take her pants 
off and remove his as well. She was able to kick the man off her, jumped 
on her bike and went home. She called her boyfriend and the Sheriffs 
Office and a BOLO was issued for the suspect. 

 On Thursday, 
a man matching the stalker&apos;s description was located near Port Charlotte 
High School; he was identified as Stephen Frederick Foster, 62, also 
homeless, who is the father of Samuel Foster. The father said his son 
and he live in a homeless camp off Collingswood Blvd. He was shown the 
restaurant video and identified himself and his son Samuel. He also 
identified the blue bicycle belonging to his son. Stephen Foster was 
arrested on an outstanding warrant out of Lee County for Petit Theft 
and taken to the Charlotte County Jail. 

 Samuel Foster 
was located Thursday around 5 p.m. at an employment office on Kings 
Highway by MCU detectives and questioned at the Sheriffs Office. 
Foster admitted being involved in an altercation with the victim. He 
said he was drunk and couldnt remember everything that night but 
did admit punching the woman, falling on top of her, scratching her, 
ripping her shirt and slapping her. Foster was arrested and also taken 
to the County Jail. 

 Both father 
and son remain in jail Friday morning on no bond.
