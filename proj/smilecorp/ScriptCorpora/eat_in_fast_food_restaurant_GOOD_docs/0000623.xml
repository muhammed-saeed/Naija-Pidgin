 3 Types of People 

 Sunday, October 28, 2007 4:19:01 PM 
 I work with some interesting people, to say the least.

I can put them, basically, into 3 categories:

#1. People I like
#2. People I tolerate, and
#3. People I can&apos;t stand

I&apos;d rather work with those who fall in cat.#1, but, well, it just isn&apos;t going to happen.

I&apos;m sure I fall in cat.#2 or #3 for some people as well. [/B][/FONT]

 Trouble with Watching 

 Sunday, October 28, 2007 4:13:30 PM 
 I&apos;m having trouble with my Opera &quot;Watch/Notifications&quot; on my blog. I&apos;ve got 31 &quot;watchings&quot; but when I go to my &quot;watch page&quot; to see who said what, and what blog to visit I no longer have a scroll down option.

I&apos;ve clicked the small little box w/ a check mark to want to view who makes a comment and have even emailed Opera about it but have not gotten a fixable solution to this freakin&apos; problem.

I do apologize to all of you who have commented. I have not been writing back b/c of this situation.

It&apos;s impossible to know who comments, what is said and where to respond if I can&apos;t see any of the comments.

I trust Opera will help SOON. I&apos;m a pretty patient dude, but heck, 31 watchings and growing can cause one to eat a pint of Haagen Dazs ice cream.

 CHARITY (Love) 

 Sunday, October 21, 2007 2:31:47 PM 
 There is so much good in the worst of us,
And so much bad in the best of us,
That it ill behooves any of us
To speak of the rest of us. [/ALIGN]

 Some of My Poetry 

 Friday, October 19, 2007 11:28:51 PM 
 Here&apos;s something I was inspired to write. Kinda odd but what the hell.

 WHY DID I . . . 

look without seeing,
hear without listening,
breathe without smelling,
partake without tasting,
touch without feeling,
leave without saying goodbye.

 What Does LOVE Mean? (Final Responses) 

 Friday, October 19, 2007 7:20:59 AM 
 &quot;Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day.&quot;
Mary Ann – age 4

&quot;I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones.&quot;
Lauren – age 4

&quot;When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you.&quot;
Karen – age 7

&quot;Love is when mommy sees daddy on the toilet and she doesn&apos;t think it&apos;s gross.&quot;
Mark – age 6

&quot;You really shouldn&apos;t say &apos;I love you&apos; unless you mean it. But if you mean it, you should say it a lot. People forget.&quot;
Jessica – age 8


And the final one. Author and lecturer Leo Buscaglia once talked about a contest he was asked to judge. The purpose of the contest was to find the most caring child.

The winner was a four year old child whose next door neighbor was an elderly gentleman who had recently lost his wife. Upon seeing the man cry, the little boy went into the old gentleman&apos;s yard, climbed onto his lap, and just sat there.

When his mother asked what he had said to the neighbor, the little boy said, &quot;Nothing, I just helped him cry.&quot;

 What Does LOVE Mean? (Part Deux) 

 Monday, October 15, 2007 7:15:32 PM 
 A group of professional people posed this question to a group of 4 to 8 year-olds, &quot;What does love mean?&quot; 

The answers they got were broader and deeper than anyone could have imagined. Here are some more of what was said:

&quot;Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get tired of kissing, you still want to be together and you talk more. My mommy and daddy are like that. They look gross when they kiss.&quot; Emily – age 8

&quot;Love is what&apos;s in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents and listen.&quot;
Bobby – age 7

&quot;If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend who you hate.&quot;
Nikka – age 6

&quot;Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it everyday.&quot;
Noelle – age 7

&quot;Love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well.&quot;
Tommy – age 6

&quot;During my piano recital, I was on a stage and I was scared. I looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling. He was the only one doing that. I wasn&apos;t scared anymore.&quot;
Cindy – age 8

&quot;My mommy loves me more than anybody. You don&apos;t see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night.&quot;
Clare – age 6

&quot;Love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken.&quot;
Elaine – age 5

&quot;Love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford.&quot;
Chris – age 7

 What Does LOVE Mean? 

 Thursday, October 11, 2007 8:41:17 PM 
 A group of professional people posed this question to a group of 4 to 8 year-olds, &quot;What does love mean?&quot; 
The answers they got were broader and deeper than anyone could have imagined. I&apos;ll post some here now and then some more later on. See what you think: 

 &quot;When my grandmother got arthritis she couldn&apos;t bend over and paint her toenails anymore. So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even when his hands got arthritis too. That&apos;s love.&quot;
Rebecca – age 8

&quot;When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. You just know that your name is safe in their mouth.&quot;
Billy – age 4

&quot;Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other.&quot;
Karl – age 5 

 &quot;Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your French fries without making them give you any of theirs.&quot;
Chrissy – age 6

&quot;Love is what makes you smile when you&apos;re tired.&quot;
Terri – age 4

&quot;Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure the taste is O.K.&quot;
Danny – age 7 


 We adults could learn a thing or two from these children.

 The Top 10 Things You Should NOT Do On A Blind Date 

 Friday, October 5, 2007 8:22:20 PM 
 #10. Talk about your past &quot;lovers&quot; with admiration.
#9. Greet your date at the door wearing a dress when you both agreed to go horseback riding.
#8. Have your mom AND dad AND grandma AND grandpa AND uncle Joe AND uncle Mike also meet your date.
#7. Tell your date you&apos;d like to have five children whenever you plan on getting married.
#6. Stop by a local pharmacy to pick up your VD prescription.
#5. Pre-invite three of your friends to meet you and your date for dinner and invite them to sit at your table.
#4. Belch several times after the meal because you think belching is funny and sooo cool to do.
#3. Ask your date to wait while you take out floss and begin oral hygiene at the table before leaving.
#2. Ask your date to please stop at a 7-11 to pick up your pay check before returning home.

And the #1 &quot;Thing You Should NOT Do On A Blind Date&quot; is:

#1. Grab your date&apos;s face, give him an Eskimo nose kiss and say, &quot;It was neato. Let&apos;s date again.&quot;

 Who Will Win? 

 Sunday, September 30, 2007 6:27:41 PM 
 Who do you think will win the Presidential election and become the President of the USA?

I think it will be Romney or Giuliani.

Whoever wins, whether a Republican or Democrat, I want us to not be candy asses when it comes to protecting the freedom and rights we now have.

 How Are You at MASTICATING? 

 Tuesday, September 25, 2007 6:02:13 PM 
 Here&apos;s something I thought everyone should know about: MASTICATION

 The Art of Mastication: How to Masticate Properly 

Ted has a limited time for lunch. He quickly leaves his job, dashes to his car and goes to the nearest fast food restaurant. He decides to go through the “drive-thru” to save time. Ordering a numbered meal on the menu board, he then pulls up ahead, pays the cashier clerk, gets his meal bag and drives off.

Hurriedly unwrapping the burger while widening the orifice in his head called a mouth to the full extension of the jaw muscles, he takes a gargantuan bite. Forcibly swallowing the chunks of beef only after three hasty chomps, he quickly inserts several potato fries into his mouth while negotiating traffic ahead of him.

The soft drink he sucks through a straw seems to take on the role of a liquid plunger compressing the food down his gullet to avoid choking. He repeats this method of consumption until his entire meal is inhaled with world class speed.

 (Unbeknownst to Ted, he has just broken the record held by a Wet Vac on how fast spillage can be cleaned up emanating from a fifty gallon drum.) Arriving just in time to report back to work, his lunch time is now over.

Does this sound familiar? Perhaps you know someone who eats like Ted. To consume food in this manner is extremely taxing on your digestion system, not to mention being unsafe to eat while you are driving.

Quite interesting.
