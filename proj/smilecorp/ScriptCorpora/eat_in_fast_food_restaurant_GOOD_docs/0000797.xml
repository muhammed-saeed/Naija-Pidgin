You have missed Rohini Movie park @koyambedu,which has got 5screens.........!!!!! balakannan31087 July 24th, 2011, 05:25 AM You have missed Rohini Movie park @koyambedu,which has got 5screens.........!!!!!

is it renovated??if u can pls. post some pics! balakannan31087 July 24th, 2011, 10:21 AM Chennai citi centre holdings Pvt.Ltd today said that they going to construct new mall in Ambattur, which also more bigger than Citi centre!:banana:
See today hindu&apos;s supplementary retail plus.
They also said about roof top hotel in citi centre:cheers:
citi centre also said they also first mall in TN with multiplex, while construction, when they approached licensing authorities, they relunctant to give license for multiple, as before there are only stand alone theatres, hence citi centre group makes them tour to see the mall in mumbai, bangalore, after seen there they given license
Citi centre is pioneer for mall with multiplex in chennai
Sathyam is pioneer for multiplex in TN&amp;chennai mr_madras July 24th, 2011, 01:52 PM You have missed Rohini Movie park @koyambedu,which has got 5screens.........!!!!!
Rohini has 6 screens(Rohini,rahini,rubini,rukmini,rakshini&amp;Ranjani) and all screens are bad conditions till last year. They do charge 80Rs max but viewers spoiled the entire atmosphere and hence rohini lost its family crowd from annanagar&amp;Mugappair. Logesh July 24th, 2011, 07:28 PM COROMANDAL PLAZA

Marg Mall is coming up nicely. I hope by next yr mid it gets opened.

Coromandel mall!! they should do some exterior works to make it attractive. But heard the multiplex there is doing good business!! vinodgopal July 25th, 2011, 03:18 AM Sounds like Chennai really wants to make a point regarding entertainment business. i wish they also open up more night clubs in these malls.

Yes, Thats right . You could not get tickets for the week end(except for the early morning show) unless u book in advance. The case is the same with fame too Arul Murugan July 25th, 2011, 05:38 AM T nagar walking street :nuts:

Unless economic/budget malls comes at Gudur, Nellore, Gumidipoondi, Sullurpettai, North Chennai, Chengalpattu, Kanchipuram, Arrakonam, Sriperumbudur etc., even Vellore, Chitoor, Tirupati T.nagar&apos;s ranganathan theru would be like this only!! Indian Sun July 25th, 2011, 02:48 PM I meant the safety aspect. All kinds of safety. Vicvin86 July 25th, 2011, 02:52 PM People there are watchful. vinodgopal July 25th, 2011, 02:58 PM Unless economic/budget malls comes at Gudur, Nellore, Gumidipoondi, Sullurpettai, North Chennai, Chengalpattu, Kanchipuram, Arrakonam, Sriperumbudur etc., even Vellore, Chitoor, Tirupati T.nagar&apos;s ranganathan theru would be like this only!!

this is what amazes me and i have often said Chennai&apos;s shopping culture is still old fashioned.

Paris corner for wholesale and houseware items and T Nagar and purasawalkam for clothing and retail items summarizes our shopping culture. Vicvin86 July 25th, 2011, 03:04 PM Unless economic/budget malls comes at Gudur, Nellore, Gumidipoondi, Sullurpettai, North Chennai, Chengalpattu, Kanchipuram, Arrakonam, Sriperumbudur etc., even Vellore, Chitoor, Tirupati T.nagar&apos;s ranganathan theru would be like this only!!

There are shopping places in towns you have mentioned but the way they are connected to the city still makes people to travel to Madras for shopping. And they come here only during festivals. BTW why everyone insisting on malls? In Madras people will do shopping in malls only when T Nagar biggies open shops in quite few of them. kannan infratech July 25th, 2011, 03:11 PM After a very long time, I visited MayaJal complex yesterday.

It is still the same or gone worse than before.

But huge crowds.

Satyam, Escape, Inox are better. I have not visited the new ones yet. vinodgopal July 25th, 2011, 03:15 PM plus we guya like bargaining a lot. in malls no question of bargaining and a fixed price. people think they would end up paying for adverts and AC/rental as a part of merchandise purchased in these places such as malls and ivory towers. And of course who would want to buy a Ralph Lauren T shirt at Rs.3000 in a multi brand showroom in say Spensors plaza when in T Nagar a decent Tirupur export reject can be bought in less than Rs.200 a piece. Arul Murugan July 25th, 2011, 03:20 PM There are shopping places in towns you have mentioned but the way they are connected to the city still makes people to travel to Madras for shopping. And they come here only during festivals. BTW why everyone insisting on malls? In Madras people will do shopping in malls only when T Nagar biggies open shops in quite few of them.

I agree! Thats why I have mentioned those towns in suburban routes. Also T.Nagar has become like another attraction of Chennai for people coming from other parts of the state! After Marina, Anna Samathi, MGR Samathi... they also land up in Chennai&apos;s T.nagar. It has become asculture buying clothing for relatives or families when they visit Chennai.. that too only from T.nagar.. not from express avenue or spencers etc.,

T.Nagar state based retail shops are no way less than those in express avenue or spencer or upcoming malls! Indian Sun July 25th, 2011, 03:36 PM ^^ +1. I realized that while scouting for items for my life abroad (higher studies).

T.Nagar may be a frustrating experience, but it&apos;s got several options and price ranges that EA or Ampa or Spencer&apos;s just do not have.

My mother too prefers the local grocery store (Pazhamudir Solai) to Reliance Fresh, More or Big Bazaar (all 3 of which are close to my residence).

What&apos;s wrong in us having a local identity ? Why can&apos;t malls and shopping districts co-exist ? Same case with food. I wish for a vada-pav today, a pizza tomorrow, and idly-vadai day after. Chennai caters to all 3 wishes. kannan infratech July 25th, 2011, 03:51 PM Chennai - T Nagar / Pursawakkam
Delhi - Sarojini Market
Mumbai - Dadar
Bangalore - Majestic

Far better than malls for shopping.

In Malls, the mark up is very steep.

The differences - AC&amp;clean environment.

I enjoy more in small eateries than the top ones - not because of the cost. For the exclusive taste.

I used to kalai one of my chef friends in a 5 star hotel - they make 5 different types of Masala Currys. They make 150 items from the same. (same taste). They dress it so well and explain for 30 minutes. Gullible clients eat in awe. :lol: Arul Murugan July 25th, 2011, 03:55 PM ^^

Bengaluru - Chickpet

:lol: kaja_asif July 26th, 2011, 08:16 AM which one these mall will open first

1. Phoneix market city mall at Vellachery
2. Prestige fourm mall at Vadapalni
3. Marg junction mall at OMR
4. PS Grand mall at Vellachery
5. Grande gold souk mall at GST road

I think when all these malls open surely mall standard will improve in chennai also.

I read in article says the metro cities delhi stands first with more than 35 malls, mumbai second with 30 malls,Bangalore third with 19 malls, kolkotta fourth with 13 malls, hyderabad fifth with 7 malls and chennai sixth last with 5 malls.

chennai needs to overcome hyderabad. bangalore its not possible..

chandra metro mall anchors shopper list and food court list please provide any one who visited the mall. kaja_asif July 26th, 2011, 08:19 AM arrange the malls i order of standard, shops, ambiance, crowd and quality

spenzer, citi centre, ampa mal, express avenue, chandra mall, abirami mall. dineshderick July 26th, 2011, 08:22 AM Chennai-Luz, Adyar, T.Nagar, Puraswakkam, khader nawaz khan road, etc.etc

Also G A Road, PondyBazar........ dineshderick July 26th, 2011, 08:24 AM which one these mall will open first


I think first Marg junction mall at OMR
then Prestige fourm mall at Vadapalni dineshderick July 26th, 2011, 08:27 AM arrange the malls i order of standard, shops, ambiance, crowd and quality

spenzer, citi centre, ampa mal, express avenue, chandra mall, abirami mall.

1.Express Avenue
2.Citi Center
3.Ampa Mall
4.Abirami Mall
5.Spenzer
6.Chandra Mall Note: (This will soon over take spenzer and Abirami.) mr_madras July 26th, 2011, 09:07 AM Coromandel mall is missing in the list even though anchor stores yet to open and i guess spectrum (Venus) mall perambur may open early Indian Sun July 26th, 2011, 11:06 AM Chandra Mall looks good from the outside. Didn&apos;t go in.

Something has to be done about the traffic on Arcot Road. It is already becoming a West Chennai shopping district, with Forum Mall, Kamala Multiplex, Raahat Plaza, Doshi Complex, Matrix Mall, Chandra Mall, Shopper&apos;s Stop and Megamart. Besides, there&apos;s the Vadapalani Bus Terminus.

Monorail ? MA Eswaran July 26th, 2011, 11:29 AM If Arcot road is not improved, this part will go the way of north chennai darkprinz July 26th, 2011, 12:45 PM I dont know ,why we people make so much noise about t.nagar being a shopping hub .. As indiansun said, it offers you everything in every price range !

And as told before it has become one of the visiting places for people who are new to our city .. I even knew many people from here,who boast that they shopped in t.nagar when they were to chennai for official visits etc.,

Its a place where both wealthy and poor people get what they want ! It doesnt mean it sells only cheap goods .. Please come out of that idea..

Yes ofcourse ..We need to improve pedestrian infrastructure , improve and integrate transportatin system .. And do some branding exercise .. :) it has good potential to become best shopping district in subcontinent region IMO chennaidesi July 26th, 2011, 04:45 PM Here&apos;s the Complete story about Mall scenario

Existing Malls (This list has already been given by me)
http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/111/unled3bn.jpg
Calculated on GLA (Gross Leasable/Lettable area).

Upcoming Malls (Time Frame 2014)
http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/9928/unled4o.jpg
Calculated on SBA (Total Area). Figures given as per builder&apos;s specification. Please note that actual area may vary after construction as often happens.
The GLA is calculated on approx by reducing 35% of SBA as per existing rule.

For those who has seen the list and thinking of Bangalore as the winner, here&apos;s the caution



I&apos;ve just mentioned the key points from the 33&amp;31 page reports of Bangalore&amp;Kolkata. Since it is getting longer, I&apos;ve omitted details of Hyderabad&amp;Chennai. But the South Indian Cities Report ends like this.

CHENNAI: Still Untapped
Compared to its two competing metros in South India, Chennai, with a total of just 19 malls (existing + new) by 2014, is in a much better position. The 14 new malls under construction in Chennai have a combined GLA of 4.12 million square feet. This will lead to total mall space supply of 6.307 million square feet by 2014, against an estimated demand of 9.13 million square feet, thus leading to 31% undersupply in this Southern metro.

BANGALORE: Certain Disaster
Bangalore may have 55 malls by 2014. As many as 38 new malls are under construction or planning, with a GLA of 12.601 million square feet, to add to the 17 existing malls. According to our research, this will lead to total mall space supply of 16.505 million square feet by 2014, covering only 85% of the city’s geographical area, against an estimated demand of only 9.698
million square feet, leading to an alarming 42% oversupply.

HYDERABAD: Not Too Bad
Greater Hyderabad may have 26 malls by 2014. Thus, the total
mall space (existing and upcoming) by 2014, covering about 80% of the city by geographical spread, is expected to be 7.655 million square feet, against an estimated demand of only 6.231 million square feet in this area, a case of about 19% oversupply.

+1 Exactly my thought ...

Total mall in madiwala is worst ... Very less shops ... its nothing like mall ,....There is no lift facility for second floor ... u need to take an escalator to third floor and come down to Ground floor by lift ... Don&apos;t understand the logic behind this arrangement anyway :bash:

Much hyped Central mall looks more like Big Bazaar except that u get costlier brand products ... I also doesn&apos;t give u that feel of a mall ...


IMO Forum mall is the best in most terms.. next comes Mantri ... :) Indian Sun July 26th, 2011, 07:36 PM ^^ I agree with you two on every point, but I think we should shift our discussion 350km east. :) chennaidesi July 26th, 2011, 07:37 PM And never take this discussions to Bgl thread. lexraja July 26th, 2011, 07:42 PM +1 Exactly my thought ...

I think we need to come to a consensus as to what constitutes a mall .:)

Neenga solradha vachu patha then summa kaanum building a katti naalu kadaya vachu Mallunu Hype panra madhiri Theriyudhu Bangalore la . By that logic the malls in the list below also need to figure in the list of malls in Chennai especially Alsa Mall which was one of the earliest malls in Chennai and Prince Plaza .Also there are numerous places with the suffix arcade ,towers and plaza all of which could be counted as malls :) Big Bazaar excluded :lol:

http://www.spiritofchennai.com/shopping/prince.htm

This list does not include Ampa Skywalk and a few others . The current count will be around 30 then . :) Indian Sun July 26th, 2011, 07:44 PM There never really are discussions on the 2 cities there. There are just fights and abuse-counter abuse.

Ispahani Centre and Alsa Mall (as raja said) have been left out. Also, if Central makes the cut, so should Globus, T. Nagar. darkprinz July 26th, 2011, 08:01 PM To be Noted : I didn&apos;t compare Bangalore and Chennai malls anywhere in my previous post ...

Something has to be done about the traffic on Arcot Road. It is already becoming a West Chennai shopping district, with Forum Mall, Kamala Multiplex, Raahat Plaza, Doshi Complex, Matrix Mall, Chandra Mall, Shopper&apos;s Stop and Megamart. Besides, there&apos;s the Vadapalani Bus Terminus.

Monorail ?

add to that corp office of Michelin (in Shyamala Towers), AVM studios ; you have got Pizza hut, Dominos, KFC and now I hear that McDonalds is coming up near Megamart.

something has to be done to decongest the place. The vadapalani flyover, when it comes, should help a little bit. But from the junction upto Porur, the road is too narrow, haphazard parking making it very congested and difficult. mr_madras July 27th, 2011, 08:18 AM Bono : Where is this Metro zone coming up ... ??

On IRR between Thirumangalam Jn&amp;Cooum river kaja_asif July 27th, 2011, 08:27 AM 1.Express Avenue

Citi centre at second place and ampa mall at third place. on what basis u given citi centre second place. can you give details..

i think chandra mall u can give 4th place ... vinodgopal July 27th, 2011, 09:05 AM why the names Chandra mall, Abhirami etc...

all fit for nothing local names. They gotta learn to keep modern trendy international names. Our city thinks local which is why late progression happens. Indian Sun July 27th, 2011, 10:01 AM ^^ How does the name matter, as long as a mall is good ? If Express Avenue is renamed Viraivu Paathai Maaligai tomorrow, will you stop visiting it ?

If a shopping arcade is named Souk Madinat Jumeirah in Dubai, it&apos;s cool.
If Bangkok is called Krung Thep Mahanakhon, it&apos;s cool.
But if a place in Chennai has a Tamil name it&apos;s conservative and un-metropolitan.

It&apos;s already tiring that builders use names like Birchwood, Maplewood, Bollywood for their projects when there are some very sweet Indian names (Ekanta, Aashiana, Svasti, Antariksa - I think Jains and TVH are good at this stuff)

Odummo Odatho. kannan infratech July 27th, 2011, 01:18 PM I think Malls&amp;Multiplexes are used very frequently without actually understanding the true meaning. I think that I had explained a year or two earlier. For the newbies:

MALL:
There are many Shopping Complexes which are also called Malls in the advertisements.
As per the convention&amp;business circle parlance, Malls can be called so only if
The area of occupation is Large or High Value (Gold / Diamond etc) in case of little lesser area.
There should be large Anchor Stores, who individually occupy say 15% or more area of the total (who actually ensure higher footfalls)
There should be a mix of merchandise (Super markets will not qualify).
Vanilla Stores - may be smaller - but sell different merchandise - may not pull footfalls individually - but bask in the reflected footfalls from the Anchors.
There should be ample Car Parking.
There should be Public Amenities. (Many malls abroad are having attached rail stations also. Creches are also there)
There should be entertainment - Movies, Play Areas, Children Play Areas.
There should be Food Courts.
Multiplexes are preferred in the malls mainly to attract repeated Footfalls. We keep going to different movies and so may also buy.

SPENCER PLAZA is not a Mall. Express Avenue is. Spencer could not change over to a mall status.

There are smaller versions (NOT Malls) where the Multiplex / Movie Halls are the Anchors and not Big shops. The Vanilla Stores will depend on the pull of the Multiplexes. In some places, Food Courts&amp;Children Play areas are added. These are called Family Entertainment Centres.

MULTIPLEX:
Multiplex is different from conventional cinema halls. In Multiplexes, same movie can be shown in multiple theatres with few minutes intervals using the same film rolls. There is no fixed movie in fixed hall. Depending on the crowd / pre booking, authorities can change even at the last minute.

SATYAM Complex is not Multiplex. Mayajal is. Mad 4 Madras July 27th, 2011, 02:03 PM Odummo Odatho.

For multiplex,the definition said by u above is correct, in addition there is another definition -cinema halls with more than 3 screens is also known as multiplex-which may also referred to as cineplex.

Hence Satyam is too multiplex, even in sathyam same film is screened more than one screen(most of times)[tomorrow vappam films is screening in both Studio-5 and 6 degrees on sathyam complex]

oh so mayajaal is a megaplex. am i right kaja_asif July 28th, 2011, 10:14 AM multtiplex will have common projector room in bio-level. because of that they can show the film in more than single screen with 10 to 15 min interval.

i think in chennai INOX, PVR,Fame, mayajaal, AGS having bio-level projector room, so they can possible to screen movies in multiple screen 10 - 15 minutes interval.

Escape there is no projector room, it has automatic projector which is hanged in high-level u can see from the lobby. flims are automatically run with comments from computer. here also possible to screen single flim in multiple screen.

In sathyam there is no common projector room for sathyam and santham. apart from these subham and seasons have common projector room, sutido 5 and six degree has common projector room. any way here all the flims are screend in digital format so flim projector not required only digital projector required which receives the signal from satellite and prject to screen. so its possible to screen single flim in multiple screens. kannan infratech July 28th, 2011, 10:39 AM Satellite Feed is not yet implemented commercially in India.

India has moved on from the&quot;film roll&quot;delivery model specially Mumbai, Chennai, Andhra film industries to digital. That is why now a days even tier II and III cities have screening of latest movies withing the same opening weeks as in metros. Also if you see when viewing a movies in the multiplexes you will not see the sudden roll change on screen which you could have seen earlier. kannan infratech July 28th, 2011, 02:30 PM India has moved on from the&quot;film roll&quot;delivery model specially Mumbai, Chennai, Andhra film industries to digital.

In multiplexes, film reels are fed into one projector and with a time delay the same reels are fed into the next projector or second projection unit of the same system and so on. This is totally automated system. (No change of reels etc)

The word Digital is used loosely be the industry. If the operation is computer controlled, it does not mean&quot;Digital&quot;. Only of late, movies are taken in the digital format by not using film roles.

New Multiplexes may also have Satellite fed flicks depending on the customer demand.

All tamil films released in the UK are delivered on a hard drive.

Perhaps there is a technology to convert the video from reel to digital format. kannan infratech July 28th, 2011, 02:53 PM Tamil films released in the UK are delivered on a hard drive.

For overseas market, they are converted into digital to match the theatre system abroad.

Actually the piracy happens only in those labs where this conversion work is being done.

Though I am not into the tech part of the film making, my friends have been telling that it is much cheaper to shoot in digital format and it may catch big time in Kollywood.

In a recent Directors meeting, KS Ravikumar has suggested to release overseas digital format also in India on the first day. There seem to be some issue on payments etc, which is based on the first copy. So the financiers / producers insist on film roles.

I am not well versed in this and may be wrong or not accurate. vinodgopal July 28th, 2011, 03:04 PM In multiplexes, film reels are fed into one projector and with a time delay the same reels are fed into the next projector or second projection unit of the same system and so on.

See sir, 35 mm reel is not digital at all. Usually they take movies in 35 mm film camera and convert them into digital and are shown in theaters supporting Qube or UFO digital. The satellite option is still in the child crawling stages where across theaters from a common harddrive they transmit and so the shows are predetermined in advance. This technology is common in Hollywood and other advanced countries however in India it is at a low percentage.

Most film producers in hollywood and other forward thinking film industries have started using digital cameras (first Full HD was used and now it supports Red One which can go upto 4K resolutions) in film production itself eliminating costs in conversion and post production film editing. And secondly it can be aired in Satellite or can be easily transported to theaters supporting digital projectors.

Mumbai Express had a production cost of just 2 crores as a result of it while for the same Virumandi had about 20 crores production cost. Why because of digital camera used in Mumbai Express. (But a very poor resolution HD DV Cam) purapagal July 28th, 2011, 04:32 PM Multiplex owners face technology pangs (http://www.boxofficeindia.co.in/one-two-ka-4k/)


If you thought that 3D screens were the ultimate innovation in the exhibition space. Then you need to rethink. With newer technology knocking at our doors almost every second, it is now the 4K digital projection systems that are creating a buzz across the cinema industry these days.

It all happened when the latest action 3D franchise from Paramount Pictures, Transformers: Dark Of The Moon was released on June 29. Urvashi Cinema chain, a single screen cinema in Bangalore screened the film with its newly installed 4K digital projection systems by U.S based visual technology company Christie Digital Systems USA, Inc. The installation was done by Scrabble which is Christies deployment partner in India.

Urvashi cinema is Bangalores biggest 3D cinema, which is equipped with a capacity of 1,161 seats and Transformers had a run for two weeks there. Using two Christie CP4230, this dual projection with an xpand active 3D system on screen of 60ft by 26 ft, it is the first ever 4 K digital cinema projection in a commercial cinema in India.

Amit R Gowda, CEO, Urvashi Cinema says that, 4K is a premium experience even going by worldwide standards. We always want to give our patrons the best viewing quality, which is why we made the bold move of installing Christie CP4230 digital cinema projector, another reason being our belief in pursuing excellence.

The multiplex industry is slated to grow at a steady pace. At a recently held Cinema India Expo, in Mumbai, global experts in digital cinema have forecasted that the E-cinema services across India would touch a figure of 6000 and around 700 DCI compliant projection (2K) cinema screens would be installed in India, by the end of 2011. By the global standards in the digital cinema industry, this is a significant number for the Indian digital cinema space.

What is 4K?
So what exactly is 4K? For the uninitiated, traditional 35mm, 2K digital projection, 4K digital projection, IMAX, digital IMAX, and digital 3D are among the cinema formats that are commonly used across the world. The important question remains that which format is the best to watch a film on? Movie fans may wonder whether it makes much difference if a film is witnessed in 2K projection instead of 4K projection. And cinema owners might ask themselves if its really worth it to update their projection equipment.

Higher image quality
A projector that has a 2K resolution means that it projects 2,000 pixels in an image at a time. A 4K projector puts out 4,000 pixels of an image onto the same size screen. If you sit very close to a screen that is using a 2K projector you are more likely to notice the pixels. The more pixels per screen, better is the quality of image. With 4K it is a lot harder to notice pixels as the image is more sharper and well defined, and more subtle details can come through that would be lost with a 2K projector.

Visual Difference
A 2K projection is at a slightly higher resolution than 1080p HD. To most eyes, this difference is not noticeable. This is also true of 4K resolution despite 4K projection having twice the resolution as 2K projection. The only way this really becomes noticeable is if you are watching a movie on a really big screen such as an IMAX screen. A small screen with twice the resolution wont be that noticeable.

The Future of 2K, 4K, and beyond
As of 2010, 6K projectors are already starting to roll out at movie theaters that wish to upgrade them. Three-dimensional cinema is starting to take off. Most 3D projectors are at 2K resolution, but 4K and 6K projectors exist. As of 2010, 3D projectors require the viewers to wear special glasses. This may change to where no glasses are needed.
Amitabh Vardhan, CEO, My Cinemas says that, 4K is the future of the Indian cinema industry and makes the viewing experience for the audience much better. The image quality gets enhanced with 4K digital projectors.

Most multiplexes are currently using 2K digital projectors which can be easily upgraded to 4K. However, none of the multiplexes have ventured into this space yet as they feel there is a lack of 4K content. It is quite similar to what happened with 3D films. The cinemas started upgrading to 3D only when 3D films flooded the country.

According to Anil Chopra, MD of Diversified Comm India, It is estimated that over USD 200 million would be invested by the Indian digital cinema industry in equipments.
But while 4K may be the swankiest technology for cinema owners, there are a few theatre owners who feel that it is too nascent a technology to invest in. The costs involved in upgrading a existing 2K screen to a 4K screen can range anywhere between Rs 25 lakhs to 40 lakhs and this is an investment that most multiplex owners are hesitant to make at the moment.

Vardhan also mentioned that, We need to have content that is shot in 4K in order to upgrade our screens. It is a useless expenditure for us if there are no 4K films, and we would be making dead investments by doing these technology upgradations.

At multiplexes like Cinemax, PVR, Fun and Inox, all screens are 4K upgradable but none of the projectors have been upgraded to 4K yet. Sunil Punjabi, CEO, Cinemax India says that, I dont see 4K as the future of the cinema space yet as the content needs to be customised to be shown on 4K. This technology works best at single screen cinema halls where the throw length is large otherwise in small theatres the image might get pixilated. He further adds that, I dont think it is wise to invest in 4K yet as 2K is already generating quite good results.

However, just like with 3D technology, this potential of 4K projections is something every theatre owner must take into account when trying to find the ideal projection system according to the seating capacity and length of the theatre.

Devang Sampat, Head of Strategy, Cinepolis India says that, The audience doesnt mind paying extra for picture clarity and good quality cinema. A few years ago all multiplexes were debating whether we should install 2K projectors or not. And the installation of 2K has generated such huge revenue for us. 4K will also have a similar impact in the coming years.


As seen from the report most multiplexes uses digital projection systems. I do not have the details whether the content is also available in digital format or not. But I have noticed pixelation when watching some movies. Anniyan July 28th, 2011, 04:37 PM The companies, which set up their equipment to facilitate beaming of the film without any physical film reel, are currently charging Rs. 7,000 per week from theatres for digital projection of films.

Please read my post replied to Kannan Infratech(who said digital is a mis used term by the market for each and every thing). Qube and UFO pioneered digital cinema projectors and different from satellite transmission because they started much before satellite feed technology. Sat feeds are used by Qube and Digital too these days but they are just players in the market. So dont automatically conclude that they only satellite transmit movies(It is as ambiguous as saying xerox means photocopy and photocopy means xerox. xerox is a company name and Cannon, HP can also photocopy. They have a myriad of products to offer including digital projection(through digital projectors supporting hard drives as well as optical discs(DVD&apos;s). Satellite telecast in theaters were found much later than Qube and UFO were pioneers in digital film auditoriums.

Forget Vetri theater and varadharaja theater which uses just a projector thats digital which is different from a 35 mm projector, Maayajaal itself does not use sat feed and they use DVD&apos;s projected into screens.

In vettri theatre i am sure that they using satellite feed, i even seen dish above theatre and when i enquired about this in their facebook page they confirmed that they using satellite feed for more than three years. Mostly Qube cinemas is using satellite feed, hence only recently in pongal Kaavalan film released as much quickly at aroung 11a..m itself due to satellite feed and released late in some theates as there is no satellite feed kaja_asif July 30th, 2011, 12:14 PM which is better qube or UFO.

bangalore urvashi cinema single screen theater has installed 4K projector first in india. most of the chennai guys who visited says its much more better than sathyam cinemas. sathyam has to over come this. someone pass this message to sathyam. kannan infratech July 30th, 2011, 01:45 PM I checked up with my friends in Real Image who are into HD Advts&amp;movies.

What I understand

In India, most of the films are still taken by using films and only recently, movies are taken directly as digital. If you take directly in digital, the quality will be far superior.

The films taken by using film is converted into DVDs in the labs. In the process, the mistakes like scratches&amp;noises can be removed.

These DVDs are the projected in select theatres who have permanent facility with DVD Projectors.

For those theatres who do not have these projectors, some companies hire them out. There are various models. If they are allowed advt times in between, they do this for free. Or they share a %age on the collection. Or they charge a fixed price per show.

Many Corporate companies, who are into film distribution / exhibition are promoting this concept as it is cheaper for them to handle. But piracy also happens here and they lose heavily.

Satellite Feed at present is actually fixed time broadcast from a remote server. The receiving units are similar to Dish&amp;Set Top Boxes for DTH.

But the future will have multiple flicks available at the same time from a satellite and depending on the viewers / clients&apos; choices, any movie can be selected. Browsing may also be possible.

The screens of the theatres are also in for a change. Instead of front or back projection, that will also become HD screens.

Even outdoor advts with huge HD screens are expected. bonoslack7 July 31st, 2011, 05:51 AM http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/cities/chennai/chennai-mall-growth-set-explode-178

Shopping this Deepavali could be a completely new experience for Chennaiites if high-end retailers and real estate developers in the city make good on their plans to open a slew of swanky new air-conditioned malls.

Chennai added over 3.25 lakh sq. ft of mall space in the past three months. Six months from now, the city will have over 3 lakh sq. ft more mall space, paving way for a high-end shopping experience in almost every part of the city.

With the economy bouncing back, retail mall space supply across the country witnessed a growth of over 65 per cent in the second quarter, with Chennai contributing significantly to this, says realty research firm Cushman&amp;Wakefield (C&amp;W). The second half of 2011 will see an increase of mall room by approximately 3.1 lakh sq. ft, it adds.

Chandra Mall in Virugambakkam and Coromandel Mall on OMR fuelled mall growth during the quarter and also led to a surge in overall mall vacancy rate to 6.6 per cent. But this is expected to be sorted out in the next two months with retailers hankering for space ahead of the festival season.

Of the 2 lakh sq. ft in Coromandel Mall, only 40,000 sq. ft has been firmed up while the rest is the under negotiation. But we will have full occupancy before Deepavali, says Suryavardhan Estates director Mitu Sadarangani.

Confirming queries from big brands, Pon Ravichandran, director-projects of Ten Square Realty, says, We have already leased out 60 per cent of the 1.5 lakh sq. ft retail space in Ten Square Mall in Koyambedu, scheduled to open in two months. Other mall projects coming up in the city are the 1.5 lakh sq. ft Ramee Mall on Anna Salai and the 1.6 lakh sq. ft Spectrum Mall in Perambur.

The market is awaiting Parliaments decision on FDI in retail. If it is implemented, the supply side for retail will have more to look forward to, says Jaideep Wahi of C&amp;W. kaja_asif July 31st, 2011, 06:49 AM coramental mall outer interior must be taken care otherwise it looks like hotel in tirunelveli. people will not impressed...

Even for a Sunday afternoon Express Avenue mall in Royapettah was rather more crowded than usual. Shoppers forgot the sale signs and stood entranced by boys who spun on their heads, turned, twisted and contorted themselves into unbelievable positions while a DJ kept playing hip-hop tracks. It was the India finals of the worlds biggest b-boying competition, Battle Of The Year (BOTY).

Qube is better but is more expensive. UFO is cheaper and usually considered only if budget constraints are there in a cineplex. 4K projectors need not necessarily project in 4K resolution. And also 4K resolution is supported by Red One does not mean it is going to give a 4K resolution always.

It all depends on the exposure and cinematographer skills and lighting effect. Similarly for those who think Digital camera is better than 35 mm, i am afraid they are wrong. Digital camera is just a rough equivalent to a 35 mm camera and clearly 35 mm cameras do not need much color correction while digital cameras need color corrections.

I was indirectly referring to the shopping mall called &apos;The Canopy&apos; at Mahindra world city just before chengalpattu..

Also there are malls coming up at Estancia SEZ near Guduvanchery and Shriram SEZ Mall at Perungalathur.

I wish someone constructs a shopping mall in Tambaram. Its one of the biggest junctions of city but it doesn&apos;t even have one mall (though Shanmugam road is like Tnagar Ranganathan st). It will have footfalls from residents across GST road, Mudhichur road, Camp road, Velachery road and nearby localities.

Yes!

When retails went down on OMR till Navallur, I wonder why not at Tambaram, Chromepet etc!

Tambaram mall can attract even Pallavaram, Chromepet crowds. Once malls at Vels open up, Alandur, Nangallur people will go to Vels rather than going to central Chennai. wlbkng August 3rd, 2011, 09:45 AM ^^ I think cost and land availability are the biggest problems for one to start constructing a mall at Tambaram.. kannan infratech August 3rd, 2011, 10:19 AM A mall in Tambaram may come up in between GST Road&amp;Railway line (near the Byepass Flyover Junction).

Looks to be compound wall already built.... Hope they leave space for 4th railway line between Tambaram and Chengalpattu.
Entry and exit is going to be the problem. The same GST road arm from TBM towards Chengalpattu will be both entry and exit road. They have to complete Perungalathur ROB, Vandalur ROB to escape traffic congestion.

To go back towards tambaram they have to join gst road, take underpass to chennai bypass, make a U-turn there and then join the gst road on the opposite once again. :nuts:

Nevertheless mall will take atleast 5 yrs to be opened from now on.


Is it the pentagonish area?

No its on the other side of railway track.. May be some 200m away.

I am still wondering how IAF allowed them to construct such a high structure near their air base. Indian Sun August 3rd, 2011, 01:58 PM Shanmugam Street, Tambaram, has more hope than Ranganathan Street.

I wrote&quot;for a mall to be successful&quot;.To be successful People will come to the mall to absorb the ambience but how many will translate to spending customer will decide the fate of a mall. For that you need high earning individuals and only Tambaram may have these people. Skywalk is a success not just because it is the only mall in the area but because of its proximity to Anna Nagar, Kilpauk, Arumbakkam, Chetpet which is chock a block of high spending people. One may not get this kind of spenders in maraimalar nagar and guduvancherry though you may find a few but they need not translate into customers.

lol...are you joking? express avenue has high end stores like hamleys, aldo, sisley, burberry, many watch shops, etc. madrasi7777 August 9th, 2011, 12:48 PM Hi Murugan,

I agree that multiplexes and food court brings in the crowd but these crowds will spend about 120 for a ticket and other 100 rs for food that is all.The success of a mall lies in their ability to bring in shoppers and to keep them in for at least a couple of hours. Food court and multiplex alone does not comprise a good mall.A mall must have good shops catering to varied products to bring in the true crowd. These are the crowd the malls pull into their food court and multiplexes.

I have been to many malls all around Delhi NCR, Mumbai, B&apos;lore, asia and europe and I must say that Express Avenue has hit the bulls eye in terms of success and ambience.I feel this mall and citi centre ( though it is small) is almost up the other malls that I have seen. The other malls which I see will hit the bulls eye will be the Forum in vadapalani and mount road, Phoenix mall and Marg.

I agree that GST in another 10 years will have many high spenders but until then gold souk has to hang in there.

In same Asean countries, I hope you might even seen malls - with local brand retails, cineplex, supermarket, food courts doing good business even in small size town like Villupuram. I don&apos;t think gold souk will be any highend shopping mall like the one in European countries and Asean countries metro cities high end mall.

It will be very ordinary like Ampa mall or Ambirami mall or like the TOTAL mall in Bengaluru... surely gold souk can statisfy those customers.

GRT, Naaiha like retails have opened outlets at Tambaram to attract the suburban crowd, they are doing very good. Do you think these outlets at Tambaram are attracting people from Velacherry, Saidpet, Anna nagar? Definetly not!

note: I dont think gold souk will host international brands there... it should be locally made some international brand, national brand, jewllery, retails like pantaloon, megastore etc., this are common stores and coming up in every dt HQ! I don&apos;t think gold souk need to wait for 10yrs for this! braveman August 9th, 2011, 03:38 PM GRT at Tambaram !!

This what Arenes Gold Souk planned. ranga August 9th, 2011, 06:00 PM Please don&apos;t compare chennai and bangalore. Even chennaites have equal Spending capacity, but they are very smart enough to just spend on the worthy stuff. They don&apos;t show off, they are very real.

:lol: vinodgopal August 9th, 2011, 11:10 PM hopeless comparison between Chennai and Bangalore. Compare Chennai to Singapore/KL/European cities, American cities, Chinese cities or even some of the other Asian tiger countries (South Korea, Taiwan, Hongkong etc...) then we will see where we stand. By comparing to another crappy indian city like bangalore where you dont have a f&apos;ing place to fart in peace leave alone place to sit, it becomes really silly. Its like comparing the devil with the deep blue sea. Chennai2020 August 10th, 2011, 02:18 AM This what Arenes Gold Souk planned.

I agree with Kannan.

Arenes is a mall operator. They operate malls in NCR, Kochi, Jaipur etc., Other mall owners/operators in chennai including Express avenue owns and operate only that specific mall. With Arenes profile, they are expert in this space and know how to get crowd&amp;convert that into business.

Calling the Chennai Gold Souk is doomed / failed etc., shows the individual&apos;s lack of understanding in this specific area. kaja_asif August 10th, 2011, 06:27 AM finally, gold souk status?.

History and retail come together as the Future group, owners of the Amar Chitra Katha brand, grow the property through its retail outlets,group CEO Kishore Biyani said.

&quot;We will open the first of the Amar Chitra Katha theme parks in Chennai. We also have plans for Imagninariums, which will come up at Big Bazar outlets and we are creating a new series in Amar Chitra Katha with more recent events,&quot;Biyani said.

While the Imaginariums are still on the drawing board, the first could open in the another three-four months, Biyani said.&quot;We need to restore awareness about our traditional values and we can do it through Amar Chitra Katha, where we hold a 56% stake,&quot;he said. He pointed out that a whole generation of readers grew up reading Amar Chitra Katha and are thus familiar with our great traditions.

Biyani was in Pune to inaugurate the first phase of a 1.1 million sq ft shopping, leisure and commercial development, Amanora Town Centre. The Rs. 635 crore project is being developed in an equal joint venture between City Corporation Ltd and Horizon Realty Fund of the Future group.

Responding to questions on the chances of the group forming strategic alliances with overseas retailers once the organised retail sector is opened for foreign directo investment, Biyani said,&quot;We have many options since we have multiple formats. The bride is ready in several formats but FDI is still to happen.&quot;

He added that they plan to add another 8-9 million sq ft of retail space over the next three years, with Big Bazar accounting for about 60% of that space. The other brands will take up the rest.&quot;We will invest Rs. 700-800 crore for this over the next three years, raising the funds through internal accruals,&quot;he said.

With Indian consumption expected to rise multifold in the next decade to US $1 trillion, from the current level of $400 billion, Biyani was confident that Indian retailers could become the size of Walmart, the US retail giant.&quot;There will be consolidation in the next two- three years in organised retail space, leading to three-four players per segment and a lot of regional players,&quot;he said. bonoslack7 August 21st, 2011, 10:26 AM 40,000 sqft Shoppers stop to be anchor tenant.

A multiscreen theatre operated by one of the top names in the field Fame Cinemas
food court that will have counters by leading restaurant chains
Sophisticated children’s play area
A shopper’s paradise with lifestyle products and international brands
Construction already underway, for the first mall in this chain–coming up over 4 acres of prime property in Perumbur

Though the name of the mall chain is spectrum, it is coming under the name,&quot;Grand Venus Mall&quot;.Construction is going on for more than a year albeit at a slower pace. Visible improvements can be seen with the pace of development. Will try to post the U/C pics soon. Arul Murugan August 22nd, 2011, 01:25 PM ^^

The structure is complete. The facade is white; the final paint is yet to be given. Seems like they are doing up the interiors now. Guess it&apos;ll take 6-8 months to complete it even if work is done at brisk pace. murlee September 2nd, 2011, 07:12 PM Food helps Sathyam dish out a better movie experience

You&apos;re watching a particularly riveting scene from a blockbuster movie. Eyes transfixed, you reach for another fistful of caramelised popcorn. To wash that down, a long glug of cold beverage and maybe a rich chocolate doughnut after.

Feeding oneself and family well is all part of the movie experience, says Mr Tan Ngaronga, Chief Operating Officer of the Chennai-based Sathyam Cinemas, which runs a chain of multiplexes. That insight led Sathyam, a few years ago, to enhance its offers at its food counters. With its own bakeries dishing out rolls, pastries, muffins and other freshly baked stuff, Sathyam Cinemas earns as much as 25 to 35 per cent of its revenues from food and beverage, depending on the theatre location.

Says Mr Ngaronga, a New Zealander,“Today people want a quality cinema experience and food is an integral part of that experience. And, they are willing to pay. We changed a lot of our F&amp;B concepts along the way.”

Sathyam Cinemas&apos; frenetic expansion in the next year or two will also see this carried forward.“We will have bakery facilities in-house to service all of our locations. Chennai locations will be supplied by our central kitchen / bakery. Other city sites will have their own in-house facilities,”he explains. With many multiplex chains coming up in various cities, Mr Ngaronga says F&amp;B can be a differentiator. At its landmark Sathyam Cinemas it runs a premium eatery, Ecstasy, as well as a restaurant, ID (idli-dosa) which dishes out South Indian fast food. Ms Monica Umesh, a software professional, who frequents Sathyam, says the theatre has created its own‘brand&apos; of food which is not available elsewhere. And, for the convenience of ordering food online (which is delivered to the seats at the interval) along with the tickets, she says she&apos;s willing to pay a premium.

REVAMPED MULTIPLEX

The Sathyam chain will shortly open its revamped three-screen, 1,500-seater multiplex in Nellore. Opening soon will be a six-screen 1,566 seater multiplex at Brookefields, a new mall in Coimbatore. In Chennai too it has ambitious plans. The cinema company recently took over two old theatres, Theagaraya, and once a city landmark, Casino, which, Mr Ngaronga says, will retain its old art deco style and be revamped to make it contemporary while retaining its old world flavour.

By next year it will also have a nine-screen multiplex at Vadapalani, a Chennai suburb, with 3,500 seats in all. Also, at the Sathyam Cinemas complex, it is awaiting permission to put up two 350-seater theatres based on Imax&apos;s“immersive”motion picture technology. The overall expenditure for these expansions, says Mr Ngaronga, would be between Rs 50 crore and Rs 80 crore. A modern multiplex screen costs approximately Rs 2.5-Rs 3 crore a screen

The cinema company recently took over two old theatres, Theagaraya...

I guess its Thiyagaraja theater in Thiruvanmiyur, if so its a great news. I watched most of the movies in this theater, this was during my college days. This part of the city lacked good theaters and restaurants for a long time. I guess its still true wrt theaters, am glad Sathyam is going to revamp this place. coolmukund September 2nd, 2011, 08:12 PM ^^

- No A/C in Fame ticket counter since it is placed outside mall entrance ...So u will be sweating like hell by the time u get your ticket:bash:
- Photography not allowed inside Fame lounge , unlike Escape ..
- Food court is small but decent for the mall size ...
- Mall as many know is smaller , may i say minuscule compared to other big retail properties in chennai ...
- But the Toilets were maintained well .. And the Staff were behaving well..
- Another point to be noted is the mismanagement i found in Fame cinemas refreshment counter ... They themselves were not sure whether the particular food stuff is available or not ... Eg. I was told that coffee was not available in counter 1 but in the next counter they were issuing coffee from another coffee machine on the other side ... :nuts:
- Another nutty concept is that u have to go to second floor by lift and then move to Fame(third floor) through escalator only ... This i found very much irritating because old people even in case of my family are not usually comfortable with Escalators ..!!!I had to persuade them to use the same !! I found this as a letdown !!

Besides eyeing 300 outlet-strong chain in three years through the franchisee route, it is also planning to set up a processing unit near Vellore in Tamil Nadu.
