 Bottom 
 Line: you want to start a food booth, food 
 cart, or concession stand but don&apos;t know how. Finally , the food concession business made clear! 

 Yes, it is possible to earn thousands of dollars in a matter of days with a 
 food booth. No, this is not a get-rich-quick scheme. If you&apos;ve ever been 
 to a fair, festival, concert, special event, or busy street corner and 
 seen the lines of hungry people waiting to buy food from the hot dog carts, 
 food trucks, concession stands, or concession trailers, common sense tells 
 you operating a food booth is a viable way to make money. You&apos;ve seen 
 with your own eyes the relatively small investment, the low overhead costs, 
 and the high volume of sales. What you can&apos;t see is how these businesses 
 came to be. 

Now you can! 

 &quot;I&apos;ve 
 been studying this business for about a year and thought I knew alot....until 
 I got your book. WELL DONE. I would make it mandatory reading for anyone 
 interested in the food booth business.&quot; JC, 
 Atlanta GA 

 Whether 
 your goal is: 
   
 How&apos;d 
 you like to.... 
 be your own boss? 

 Can 
 you imagine..... 
 having more free time? 

 What 
 if you could..... 
 create your own job security? 

 Ever 
 wanted to..... 
 earn a cash income? 

 Would 
 you like to..... 
 have the flexibility to work part-time?

 Food 
 Booth, The Entrepreneur’s Complete Guide to the Food Concession 
 Business, Expanded 2nd Edition, is a step-by-step&quot;how-to&quot;guide to designing, managing, and operating a successful food concession 
 business. Based directly on the author’s nearly three decades of 
 experience, Food Booth is a rare insight into this refreshingly unconventional, 
 yet surprisingly lucrative field of food service. It provides concrete, 
 no-nonsense information about how to start your food concession business 
 from the ground up, how to find and establish a stationary location or 
 develop a schedule of lucrative events, how to manage your business to 
 reach your sales potential quickly, and compound your sales year after 
 year. 

 &quot;It&apos;s 
 been a while since I&apos;ve been so happy with a purchase. After doing search 
 after search and making phone calls to find out how to go about setting 
 up a food concession booth, I found all of my answers in one place!!! 
 I wish I had found this book years ago. If you have any interest in starting 
 a food concession business, this is where you should start. You will not 
 be disappointed!&quot; S. McGue 

 Ask Yourself: 
 
 Have 
 you been laid off? Are you unable to find a job? Are 
 you concerned about the size of your retirement nest egg? Do 
 you need to supplement your fixed income? Do 
 you need quick cash for home repairs, a vacation, a new car, or a 
 down payment on a house? Are 
 you struggling with inadequate income? Do 
 you seek a business the whole family can participate in and enjoy? Do 
 you want to start your own business but are afraid of the financial 
 commitment, or have inadequate time or startup capital? Or, 
 do you want to start your own business but are concerned about your 
 lack of business experience? Are 
 you a student who needs to make money without interfering with your 
 class schedule? Are 
 you seasonally employed and wish to use your spare time to supplement 
 your income? Are 
 you a free spirit wishing to be responsible for your own income? Do 
 you need an excuse to travel?
Or, want to earn money while you travel? Do 
 you simply want the tax advantages of being self-employed? Are 
 you an organization looking for an excellent fund raising opportunity? Do 
 you want a business venture as a back-up in case you lose your regular 
 job? Do 
 your debts need to be paid down fast? 
 
 These 
 are just some of the reasons the food concession business might be the 
 solution you have been looking for. 

 Thanks 
 for publishing the book, I think I&apos;ve already saved a few thousand dollars 
 just by reading it, SERIOUSLY!!!!! George, 
 San Fran CA 

 &quot;Barb, 
 you&apos;ve written a terrific book. The availability of this type of resource 
 is long overdue in our business. 

 Information 
 about the business should be available to all who are interested in throwing 
 their hat into the ring and learning the craft. New entrants keep the 
 business vibrant and ensure that the veterans stay on their toes. 

 I 
 particularly liked your discussion of support vehicles, as supply concerns 
 are often overlooked by beginners.In addition, your use of many photographs 
 really added to the quality of your book&quot;.

 How 
 to Start a Food Concession Business 
 By Amy Lindgren 
 When you 
 think of those balmier months (and downright hot in the South), do you 
 conjure up thoughts of barbecue and outdoor cooking? I do and I go one 
 step further -- as a person who enjoys city life, I also think of the 
 street vendors who reappear once the snow gives way a bit....
