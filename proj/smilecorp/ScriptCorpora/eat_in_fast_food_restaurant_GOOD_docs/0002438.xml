Taco Cabana coupons
 Posted on April 24, 2011 by admin 
 Taco Cabana is a U.S.-based fast food restaurant chain specializing in Tex-Mex cuisine and is a full owned subsidiary of Carrols Corporation. Taco Cabana is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. As of July 2007, it has more than 150 locations throughout Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. Numerous Taco Cabana restaurants are open 24 hours a day, and for most in the chain’s history all locations were painted inside the company’s signature pink.

Taco Cabana, which was founded by Mike and Felix Stehling in 1978, opened its very first restaurant at the corner of San Pedro and Hildebrand Avenues in San Antonio, Texas. Originally the brothers purchased the vacant Dairy Queen since they required parking space for their well-known bar, the Chrystal Pistol, across the street. Recognizing the potential organization opportunity, they decided to open a taco stand. The open air type in the existing structure led towards the“patio cafe”idea that defined the chain’s subsequent locations. Additionally, after all of the patio furniture was stolen after closing the very first night, the around-the-clock program idea began.

In January 1993 Taco Cabana announced that it was purchasing money strapped A couple of Pesos’restaurant assets in exchange for 940,000 shares of Taco Cabana stock, approximately valued at $22 million. The sale included all 38 company-owned restaurants as well as all 51 franchised or licensed restaurants, operating under the A couple of Pesos and Shortstop Hamburgers names. Taco Cabana converted most A couple of Pesos locations into Taco Cabana restaurants, closed others and sold the Shortstop Hamburger chain.
