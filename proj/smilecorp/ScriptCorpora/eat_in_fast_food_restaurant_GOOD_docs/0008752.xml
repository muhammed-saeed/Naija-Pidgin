 We chose the 4000-C as our top pick for the mobile carwash because it has all the power 
 needed for a mobile dry carwash. It is compact in size and it is priced 
 about $300 less then the 5000-Ci making it a fantastic value. It 
 features a hot water injection activation button right on the trigger 
 handle, it is continuous fill, it works on a standard 120volt outlet and 
 comes with a full set of accessories.  Learn more about the 4000-C NOTE: If you like the hot water injection feature shown in the video and plan 
 on using it often in your portable carwash ( or other applications ) 
 we strongly recommend that you purchase a continuous fill steamer. If you plan mainly on using the DRY Steam feature, or are 
 looking to just do interior detail work then a single tank unit will 
 work just fine. 

 
 CONTINUOUS 
 FILL : ( 4000-C , 5000-Ci , Super 
 Vapor 6 ) A continuous fill 
 steamer (Dual Tank System) allows you to add water on the fly. In other 
 words, when the steamer is low on water you can add water WITHOUT 
 shutting it down. You can then immediately pick back up where you left 
 off working with virtually no down time. With continuous fill you will 
 NOT have to wait for the boiler to heat back up. How it works: A 
 continuous fill steamer has two tanks, a boil er and a refill tank. When 
 you add water you are simply filling the refill tank. The boiler is 
 trickle fed from the refill tank thus insuring that the boiler is always 
 kept full and ready for service. When the refill tank runs low you will 
 hear a loud beeping sound and the unit will stop steaming until you add 
 water. 
 TWO TOP PICKS: The 4000-C offers instant hot water mingled with the steam 
 for a beautiful rinsing affect. The 5000-Ci has an added tank on the back that you can fill with 
 water for hot water injection OR your favorite detergent. Just add 
 water or detergent to the rear injection tank . Auto 
 detailers can use zip wax or a spray and rinse wax. This way you can 
 clean and wax the car at the same time. The 4000-c is a better dollar value but the 5000-Ci gives you the added power of chemical injection rather then 
 just hot water injection. Read more on their individual pages. All 
 prices are listed on the individual product pages. These two units are 
 our top picks especially if you are considering a mobile car wash&amp;auto 
 detail system. Note: these are not vacuums. Click an image or link 
 above. 

 SINGLE TANK STEAMER : ( VC3000 
 Series   VC4000-S ) A (ST) single tank technology steamer, such as the VC-4000-S or VC-3000 are much like they sound. They have a large single 
 sealed boiler. This technology is powerful and tends to be extremely dependable as its internal 
 components are few in number. Its simplicity of design makes it rugged 
 dependable. The down side to a single tank unit is that when it runs out 
 of water you will have to release the steam pressure, open the pressure 
 cap, fill it and wait for it to warm back up. This process will take 
 about 30 minutes. The 4000-S can run in dry 
 steam mode about 90 min non-stop steaming. With hot water 
 injection on this time is greatly reduced. If you plan on doing a dry 
 car was with only dry steam, this is fine. If you plan on using the hot 
 water injection be aware, you will run out of water VERY fast. If 
 you plan on using the hot water injection very often consider the 
 continuous fill systems like the 4000-C or 5000-Ci . 
 All that being said, the 4000-S is a great system 
 for the mobile detailer. It all depends on what your main use is. The VC 3000 has a much lower 
 wattage and does not have hot water injection. Though it is a good 
 detailer tool, the lower wattage and smaller water tank makes it less 
 suited for full size exterior car washing. See the individual product 
 pages for more information. 

  WHAT IS CHEMICAL&amp;HOT WATER INJECTION? : Simply 
 put hot water injection allows you to inject super heated water into the 
 steam flow of your steamer with a push of a button. A powerful cleaning 
 tool. Hot water injection can be clearly be seen demonstrated in the Dry Carwash Video Part 2 . 
 Chemical or Soap injection allows for you to inject hot chemical or soap 
 into the steam stream at the push of a button. 
 HOT WATER : A hot 
 water injection steamer such as the VC-4000-S and the VC-4000-C can NOT inject 
 soap or chemical, just hot water and dry steam. Do not attempt to put 
 anything but clean water into this type of steamer. 

 CHEMICAL INJECTION : A Chemical Injection Steamer such as the VC-5000-Ci or the Super Vapor 6 work both 
 hot water mode and chemical injection mode as well as dry steam. You can 
 add your favorite detergent/soap to a separate injection tank located on 
 the back of the steamer OR you can simply fill that injection tank with 
 simple water for hot water rinsing instead of soap. This gives you the 
 best of both worlds. Naturally, all of our vapor steam cleaners produce 
 super heated dry vapor steam as well. CHEMICALS: Some good 
 chemicals: Zipwax wash-n-wax for cars, diluted Dawn liquid dish 
 detergent for cutting stubborn grease. You can also use simple 
 green, orange clean products and more. Be sure that none of the products 
 you use are explosive or flammable.
