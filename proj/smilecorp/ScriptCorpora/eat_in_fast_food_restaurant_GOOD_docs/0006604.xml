 What Is Burger King Thinking? 
 
At the airport yesterday afternoon, after pulling our luggage off the arrival carousel, we decided we needed a bite to eat. What the heck…let’s get something at Burger King.

Divvying up our food items revealed the“Veg City Airport”themed artwork on the Burger King paper tray liner.

Burger King is using the airport security screening metaphor–blocking bad people from getting through the gates–as a way to convey that they (Burger King) similarly screen for only quality ingredients.

But what the hell is going on in this picture?

First I saw a nervous looking onion.
Then I noticed it had its pants down.
Then I noticed the angry pickle…and then the examination glove?!
 
 [click for larger image] 

It seems that the Onion depicted in this image isn’t a quality ingredient. Yikes.

The Onion is standing in the middle of the airport with his pants around his ankles while an angry, brawny“pickle”slips on a examination glove in preparation for a body cavity search.

I’ve got so many questions.

In addition to Botox and anti-aging cream (to make itself look fresher than it actually is and try to sneak into Burger King’s ingredients)…Look at the collection of articles airport Pickle security has dumped out of the Onion’s bags…(i.e. Burger King has allowed the artist to depict in the cartoon artwork).
 (I’ve zoomed in and flipped the images so they’d be easier to read) 

“Wet Vegs”magazine? (featuring a topless large-breasted pickle licking her lips)
 
“Playveg”magazine…featuring a half-naked well-endowed carrot pepper.

 
And a copy of“Green and Horny”featuring a big-breasted, topless pickle.

 
I feel bad for the Onion. I get that it’s a“bad”vegetable…not the kind Burger King wants to serve…but this treatment is just humiliating.

 

Joking aside…is this the brand Burger King wants to be? The kind that features images of body cavity searches performed on an onion by a“Village People”pickle?
 
(notice resemblance to Village People character) 

The artwork is part of a series called Veg City . There’s the Airport , Red Light District , Sniper , and two seasonal versions: New Year’s Eve and Halloween . These were created by the BBDO German agency called .start based in Munich, Germany. (Thanks Ads of the World for the links).

Please don’t misconstrue this post as supporting/creating“buzz”for a successful tactic by Burger King. (Unless, Burger King is positioning itself as the“Hooters”of fast food burgers). This Mad Magazine-style execution–while funny and clever–doesn’t fit the Burger King I’ve known.

What is Burger King thinking?

 Update 
Via email, I’ve met the artist who illustrated this project, Christoph Hoppenbrock. He is quite talented. You can take a look at his work at Bildbauer.de .

Hey, if your little kids UNDERSTAND that pervy sexual innuendo depicted here, it sure as heck ain’t Burger King’s fault! They just see the funny faces and laugh. Maybe they’ll ask curious questions about what the silly veggies are doing. You can give easily understandable‘kid’type answers to most of them. They explanations of what these vegs are doing here are being given by adults, and will only be understood by adults! Really!
“Mommy, why is the onion sad?”“Because he is too old to be a BK onion”“Mommy, what is the policeman pickle doing?”“He is searching the Onion for illegal things.”“Mommy, why is the pickle wearing a glove?”“So he does not get his hands dirty or get infected with any bad germs the old, dirty onion might be carrying. You should wash your hands when handling food, too.”All sexual innuendoes can be avoided easily here. Whatever else you see, is manufactured in your adult minds. Your kids will eventually learn about this stuff no matter how much you shelter them anyway. BK is definitely attempting to target the adolescent, young adult, highschool/college kids who are most likely to frequent their establishment. These are the people who will read additional funny innuendo into these cartoons. BK sees no need to uselessly target their marketing to people who most frequently cook at home. The have wisely chosen their most likely patrons and are attempting to make their establishment more“fun”and attractive to that group, all so they will maximize their profits! It’s all about the $$$ in the end, guys. This controversy will only draw in more of the young adults who find this kind of humor amusing. The more grandmothers and puritans who speak out about this, the funnier, and more attractive it will be to their target market. They will gain a great deal of free advertising, through internet and word of mouth, which is FAR less expensive than ads, and far more profitable. So their marketing ploy is successful. I was certainly completely captivated by the artwork. It’s very controversial nature just made me want to look more closely. Too bad they aren’t marketed in the US. I’d go and get a diet soda, just so I could get a look at the art….(I don’t eat their fattening, unhealthy food anyway) Unfortunately, BK has probably wisely decided they don’t want to deal with all the puritans in the US who will sue them, for fear of the above foolish statements above of people who think their kids will be harmed from exposure to innuendoes of sexual perversion they should not even be able to understand in the first place. Unfortunately freedom of speech in the US has been thoroughly stomped on by our own over burdened, and corrupt legal system.

UM…EWWWW
Maybe they were trying to hit all areas of sexuality and link it to Burger King.
It’s not like the Water-head Burger King is helping much.

oh really?

this is same burger king that has vaguely insinuating signs up in their restaurants talking about mustard and“smooth as silk”. this is the same burger king whose mascot is a guy dressed up in a DELIBERATELY creepy medieval king outfit complete with rob-the-bank plastic mask. this is the same burger king who made an xbox game based off said mascot where you sneak around hiding in trash cans and throw burgers at people.

I dunno what bible belt alternate dimension burger king you’ve been going to all these years, but I can assure you where ever it is, there’s only one of them. say what you will about BKs advertising, you need a reality check.

BKs advertising is hilarious. I have nightmares about the King still =[. Also you should note that the security officer is pointing at the misfortunate onion (he’s fu*$ked kinda look on his face) AND theres some more veggie nudity in the newspaper lmfao.

You know.. if Burger King decided they wanted to sponsor / advertise in some kind of an adult internet show.. I’d at least be impressed to see an add like that…not that that would be a smart thing to do.. but.. I’d enjoy it…I kind love the idea of band’s doing crazy edgy things.. again, not that it’s a good idea for the brand really…but just cause it would entertain me…I’m selfish that way I guess..

But I can’t believe they’d stick something like this in an airport?! I mean what were they thinking?! That’s just insane! I have a friend who counts to 10 before he tweets on twitter.. just cause he’s liable to tweet something a little crazy…I think these guys could learn from my friend!

You complainers have lost your mind. It’s all quite creepy, and the person in charge of approving this kind of advertisement also seems to have lost her mind.

But let’s grab ahold of what is important here: This is Burger King you are talking about. Home of the best hamburgers in all of Asia. Only a true expat could understand the glorious joy of the occassional Burger King whopper (even though I have to pack my own extra tomato slices!).

I think it’s one of the best things I’ve ever seen. Then again, I’m not nearly as fazed by sexual imagery as I am by violent imagery- it’s honestly only a touch more lascivious than some of the things I read as a kid in MAD in the 80s. I don’t know, the“What were they thinking?”line doesn’t even really occur to me.

I can see these going over well in Europe, but we’re all overly queasy and anxious about anything remotely sexy hitting the brains of children here in the Bucolic States of America. Would you rather your children have the knowledge that sometimes people like sex, or the knowledge that conflicts can be resolved through violence?

um ok
I think they thought no one would see the play boy magazines on the ground but theres a naked pepper right behind it.
I guess it make some sense you know only the best vegtabales and all that crap
Pluse its in a public aera not in a bar were theres no kids so
why did burger king let this ad pass?

Yeh, after watching the“bigg butts”BK commercial today, I am OFFICIALLY done with burger king. You know, eating breakfast in bed with“The King”was bad enough, but the bigg butts sponge bob campaign just pushed me over the edge. Who the hell writes this stuff? It’s not funny, it’s stupid. I don’t want my children shaking their butts and answering“bootie”calls. I have a little more respect for my children, thanks. I will not promote this.

Of course this would be okay in Germany- remember their SPARKLING AND CLEAN record of morality? :? Especially in the 1940′s?

Anything goes in Germany, because their grandparents killed off the Ten Commandments bunch…
