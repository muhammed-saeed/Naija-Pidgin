 I can tell you who gives the lowest pay.
which is KFC
its really depends on your age.
my friend who works at maccas gets payed 3 bucks an hour coz she dosnt have her tax file number but when she does she gets payed 8 dollars. Plus a 50% discount of food. But no free food, Some people get 10 and hour
but it really depends on how old you are.
Hungry Jacks has better food (well thats in my opinion) and would probably get paid at the same rate
I&apos;d say if you work in the food court go to one of those independent shops which are really busy. usually they pay the most. Or maybe even a cafe thats not gloria jeans or starbucks
