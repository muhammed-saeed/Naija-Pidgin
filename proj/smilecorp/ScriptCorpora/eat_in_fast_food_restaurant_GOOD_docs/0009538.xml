 ★★★★★ Boobies is A+ 
 Toni F. 5 Boobies 
 
I have to give&quot;BOOBIES&quot;an A+ for originality , they are so much more than a hum-drum fast food restaurant like most others ... I give them an A+ on cutomer service and food presentation, they also give samples of items if you want to try before you buy, like thier gumbo or chili ... I give them an A+ on the quality of thier FOOD ... so many items you won&apos;t find anywhere else the variety makes them SOMETHING SPECIAL. I had a burger and the flavor and taste made me want another ASAP... I don&apos;t know what&quot;Mr&quot;is talking about... you can see the BOOBIES Chili in the burger. Whatever, and However they make the chili I will go back for more.... Your, going to Love BOOBIES , I know I do..

I went there a while back and the overall experience wasn&apos;t the best. The people were pleasant enough but the food was lackluster. I had a single boobie burger which came with chili on it. I wasn&apos;t sure it was chili at first. It was a bit on the pasty side. The meal came with chips instead of fries. The chips were rather dry and maybe even a bit stale.

The whole meal was dissapointing. I won&apos;t be back.

 ★★★★★ Boobies is a fun and pleasant place to experience food

Boobies has an incredible Rouladen sandwich that melts in your mouth. Our family went there recently and had a wonderful experience. The kids had a single Boobie with cheese and they were so satisfied and full at the end of dinner that one of them had to take half of his home because he could not finish it. The other one finished it and was so proud that he had his first single Boobie. My husband had the spicetastic gumbo which he absolutely loved. And after that he had a Double Boobie with cheese and they added bacon for him. It was so huge, I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes, and he finished it. He wants to go back very soon . Me, I had the savory Rouladen sandwich which I&apos;ve never found anywhere in town. It was juicy, savory, delectible, and what more can you say, it&apos;s an experience you can only have by tasting and eating one of these sandwiches. I wanted another one but I figured I&apos;d come back for lunch and have another one soon. The people there were great, they got us anything we needed such as forks, refills, extra napkins, they were fantastic, the service was wonderful and they answered questions we had about Boobie the dog.
