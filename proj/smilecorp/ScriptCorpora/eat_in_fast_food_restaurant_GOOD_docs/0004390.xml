 Never Say No To La Novia (1,888 thumbs up) FOR SALE: 
 The YAM Network (Auction ends Thursday, July 12, 2012!) 
 The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Back Pain 
 Retail | California, USA | Rude&amp;Risque , Top 
 (I work at the fitting rooms of a retail store. Two women are trying on bathing suits. They each have had obvious plastic surgery and enormous racks.) 

 Customer #1: *dumps a pile of bikinis on my desk* “None of these fit! It’s ridiculous that your store doesn’t carry anything to fit me.”

 Customer #2: “Don’t waste your breath…she wouldn’t understand. Look at how tiny her boobs are!”

 Me: *speechless* 

 Customer #1: “Honey, let me give you my brother’s card. He can give you MUCH better boobs.”

 Customer #2: “He did mine too! Look how bouncy they are!” *jiggles chest* 

 Me: “I’m…okay with C-cups, thanks.”

 Customer #1: “Call him if you change your mind! Life is better with huge boobs!”

 Weekend Roundup: A Day In An Employee’s Life 
 Clothing Store , Liquor Store , Retail , Supermarket | Not Always Right | Roundups 
 A Day In An Employee’s Life. This week, we share five stories that share the ups and downs (well, mostly the latter) of being an employee. If you’ve ever wanted to share with a friend what your job is like, send them this roundup!

 Teaching The Next Generation :
 Fold…unfold…fold…unfold…It’s a wonder more clothing store employees haven’t gone crazy! 

 A Time To Laugh, But Mostly A Time To Cry :
 This one will get you teary eyed: A customer’s precocious little girl leaves a big, smelly surprise in the changing room. 

 Mrs. Understanding :
 Teach your children by example…the example of poor, suffering employees, that is. 

 In This War, There Are No Winners :
 When they say“stick it to the man,”they probably weren’t referring to the guy stuck cleaning up your mess with a mop and a broom. 

 Nothin’Like A Good Old Existential Meltdown :
 Customers often ask stupid questions, but on occasion they can have profoundly earth-shattering ramifications. 

 PS: check out our new Extras section , with pictures, videos, and news galore!

 Some Things Just Don’t Add Up, Part 4 
 Hardware Store | Chicago, IL, USA | Extra Stupid , Money Issues 
 (I’ve just finished ringing out the customer’s items. He hands me a gift card for another store. It’s the same color as our rewards card, so I think he just isn’t paying attention and has them confused.) 

 Me: “Sir, this is a [store] gift card. We can’t take this.”

 Customer: “No, you can. Take the gift card.”

 Me: “No, I can’t. This is for [other store]. You’re at [hardware store] right now.”

 Customer: “No, take the gift card. I want to pay with that.”

 (This goes on for a few more minutes, with the customer insisting I take the gift card for the other store. I even run the card through the scanner just in case.) 

 Customer: “Wait, that is a [store] gift card, isn’t it?”

 Me: “Yes.”

 Customer: “And I’m at [hardware store], aren’t I?”

 Me: “Yes.”

 Customer: “Oh.” *takes gift card* “So, what do I owe you?”

 Me: “$30.00.”

 (He hands me a $20 and stares expectantly.) 

 Me: “And then it’s still $10, sir.”

 Customer: “You’ve got the $20.”

 Me: “Right, and $30 minus $20 is still $10.”

 Customer: “But you’re holding the $20.”

 Me: “Yes, but your total is more than $20.”

 Customer: “I gave you a $20.”

 (This goes on for a few more minutes, too. Finally…) 

 Customer: “Wait, did you say it’s $30?”

 Does This Mean I Need A Water Stone 
 Pet Store | Connecticut, USA | Pets&amp;Animals , Top 
 (I am helping a man at the fish department when this happens.) 

 Customer: “So, goldfish evolve into koi when they outgrow their tank…”

 (I look at him waiting for him to say he’s joking, but he’s completely serious.) 

 Me: “It’s a fish, sir, not a pokémon.”

 To Whom This May (Not) Concern 
 Cafe | Australia | Food&amp;Drink 
 Me: “Medium size latte for Sarah!”

 (A customer approaches and looks at the drink.) 

 Customer: “Oh, sorry, I didn’t order a latte.”

 Me: “I’m really sorry about that, Sarah.”

 Customer: “I’m not Sarah.”

 Me: “You’re not Sarah and you didn’t order a latte?”

 Customer: “No.”

 Me: “I’m really sorry, but this isn’t your coffee…”

 Fake It‘Til You Make It 
 Grocery Store | Hackney, London, UK | 
 Customer: “Hey, do you work here?”

 Me: “Yes, can I help you?”

 Customer: “Where is the pasta?”

 Me: “I’ll show you…it’s this way.”

 (He follows me to the correct aisle. As we approach, I see another girl in the aisle.) 

 Customer: “S***, that’s my ex! Quick, pretend you’re my new girl!”

 Me: *surprised* “Wha—”

 (The customer grabs me, puts his arm round me, and practically drags me over to the girl.) 

 Customer: *to ex* “Yea, I got a new girl. I’m over you.”

 Ex: “Um, okay? Great.” *walks away shaking her head* 

 Customer: *to me* “So, since you’re my girl, do I get to use your staff discount now?”

 Now We Know Why She Needs Decaf 
 Coffee Shop | Greensboro, NC, USA | Food&amp;Drink 
 (I work at a national coffee chain, and am answering the drive through.) 

 Me: “Hi, welcome to [café]. What would you like today?

 Customer: “I want a skinny latte!”

 Me: “Okay, just to clarify, skinny means nonfat and sugar-free. What sugar-free syrup would you like?”

 Customer: *huffing* “No syrup! I just want a skinny latte!”

 Me: “Um, okay, so just a nonfat latte, then. What else can I get for you?”

 Customer: “No, no, no! I just want a skinny latte, nonfat and sugar-free!”

 Me: “Okay, a skinny latte, then. What size would you like?”

 Customer: “Tall! You got that? And make it decaf! A DECAF TALL SKINNY LATTE! Gaaahhh!”

 Meaning What I Say 
 Bookstore | Omaha, NE, USA | 
 (We usually ask if the customer would like a bag for a single item purchase.) 

 Me: “Do you need a bag for this, sir?”

 Customer: “I don’t need a bag , if that’s what you’re trying to ask!”
