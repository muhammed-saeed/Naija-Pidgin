My family is from the Philippines so I was pretty much raised on Goldilocks and lumpia.  I needed some dessert to bring to a party and have been wanting to check out the new Jolibee/Red Ribbon hybrid situation.

They don&apos;t have a huge selection, but they have many cakes to choose from - I ended up buying the ube macapuno cake and it was delicious.  I love everything Ube.  I also ordered a couple of chicken empenadas and they were mighty tasty and big, but no sauce.  I had to go to Jolibee and steal some of their banana ketchup.  They have ready-made ensaymadas and mamons.  Carb central up in there, but hey, it&apos;s all yummy goodness.  Food choices are limited...my friend got the arroz caldo and he loved it.

OMG I feel so Filipino right now, haaaaaa????

I have been to many Red Ribbon Bake Shops -- mostly to purchase &quot;pasalubong&quot; (homecoming gifts) when I visit my family living 300 miles away.

This particular location is okay. They are very limited in their selection which is a bummer -- when I go to a bake shop, I expect the whole she-bang. They only have one display case of cakes, and they are the regular round ones. They also have just one wall of 2 shelves filled with mamon and ensamayda -- but not much else.

When I go, they are usually out of the macapuno ube cake that my mom loves, so I still end up driving up to Cerritos which defeats the purpose of having a Red Ribbon Bake Shop near me.

Despite all that, the customer service is great, the sitting area is clean, and there&apos;s plenty of parking nearby.

Hence the 3 star.

Good, quick Filipino food.  I like the arroz cal do and pancit palabok.  I was VERY disappointed today when I found out that they discontinued FRESH LUMPIA... So sad... now I have to get my fix at another local table service Filipino restaurant.  UGH.

Mamon is good, cakes are good - I swear they taste the same as in the Philippines, so that&apos;s always a nice reminder of visiting &quot;the homeland&quot; (but I was born here... and... I don&apos;t speak Tagalog or any other dialect...).  Anyway, good stuff here, and tame enough for any people that are AFRAID of tasting any &quot;ETHNIC&quot; food.  Give them a Mamon - it&apos;s just a sponge cake.  Ensaimada if they are daring (sweet brioche with shredded cheese on top!  CRAY CRAY!)!

I have heard a lot about this place, but never have been in one until they opened this one in Anaheim.
They have unbelievable awesome cakes http://www.yelp.com/user… 
Mango, Taro (ume), coconut... YUMMMM!!!

(Ciao Diet!)

Also other desserts like mango shakes and halo halo
And great Filipino empanadas and other savory foods.
 http://www.yelp.com/user… 

The service is pretty good, and reliable to order cakes and stuff.

Couple of things that turn me off:
they don&apos;t offer samples, many things from that place are exotic for the average Joe, how are they supposed to &quot;acquire&quot; the taste to it?

UNBELIEVABLE:  they don&apos;t have coffee! !
here and everywhere: cake goes with coffee. Well with milk for kids, but since I&apos;m Colombian we drink coffee since we are little so for me is unthinkable!
How am i supposed to have cake without coffee??

Also they should have some intermediate size cakes, is either big or 2 smalls? nothing in between? hmmm....

Other than that the pastries are DELICIOUS!

The staff at this location moves slow.  We ordered arroz caldo, it took them forever to give us our order.  I asked one of the staff which is better the mango bar or the banana slice - the answer I got - the banana slice is cheaper whewww !!! I ordered 6 different items, got charged for it - only to find out my goodie bag contains 5 items only not six.  Where is the Manager when I needed to talk to someone ????

$2.99 buy one ube shake get the second one free.

Red ribbon is a cute phillipino bakery connected to the jolliebee fast food restaurant.The Palabok with arroz is nasty -some yellow sauce with vermicelli and fake tasting egg.The pourrage tasted like it had way too much sodium.

As first I was confused as to what kind of food red ribbon served. However, deducing that it was connected to the jollibee, and after getting my order in less than 3 minutes........it&apos;s fast food.

Eat with CAUTION

&quot;Hi Good afternoon Sir, Welcome to Red Ribbonnnnnnn!&quot;

Somehow I really would like to be present while they are training new staff.  And if anyone is looking for a lawsuit, I suggest anyone who isn&apos;t a filipino to apply to work here and let us see what happens.  They will probably throw a &quot;i&apos;m sorry but you don&apos;t fit the criteria to work for Red Ribbon or Jollibee&quot;.  Just saying....

Anywho, this place has a very limited menu when it comes to food.  They only have a few items that you can order:

Arroz Caldo
Palabok
Dinuguan
and they have combo deals to mix and match those

But this is a bakeshop, so when it comes to baked goods that have a good selection from cakes to cupcakes and from empanadas to prepackage breads.

This is definitely a good stop for lunch.  Usually quick service and decently priced combos where you can get a cup of arroz caldo with palabok for under $6.  This place does have one of my favorite palabok.  I love my palabok with a lot of sauce and they put a lot of toppings such as sliced boiled egg, chicharon flakes and green onions.

The arroz caldo is really a treat.  A bit on the gingery side, but the creamy consistency and the mushrooms gives a good texture.  Its not watery / soupy which I don&apos;t like with most.

Now for they baked good.  I love their cakes.  Something about how moist and well balanced the cakes are always made.  My favorite would be the Choco Mocha cake.  But there is also their Mango and Ube cake which are Epic and no other can really compare.

My only gripes about this place is the customer service.  Not that they really did anything wrong, but most of them seem so lost most of the time if you just sit at a table and watch them.  They need better training.

First off-I&apos;m filipina, so I guess I&apos;m a little partial/biased, but I&apos;ll be as objective as I can.

I was so excited when I heard there was going to be a Red Ribbon and Jollibee in O.C--finally, I can get my cravings for pastries satisfied without driving to Cerritos or West Covina.  If you haven&apos;t tried Red Ribbon&apos;s mango cake, you must!  It is my absolute favorite and I haven&apos;t found a close substitute.  Even the frosting is good.

This particular location is somewhat of an &quot;Express&quot; Red Ribbon; it doesn&apos;t have the full menu that the others have.  The main dishes offered at this location is palabok (noodles), siopao (pork buns), and arroz caldo (chicken and rice porridge).  I ordered the palabok and siopao mini meal and they got the mini part right.  But I shouldn&apos;t complain because it was only $3.95.  The palabok was just ok--I&apos;ve tasted better.  It was a little inconsistent because mine had enough sauce, but my mom&apos;s order was dry.  The mini pork buns were also lacking in flavor and the bun itself was a little stale.

So if I can break up my rating, I would give 4.5 stars for Red Ribbon as a whole, but only 3 stars for this particular location.

This location finally opened, best part it is down the street from my work!

Always been a fan of Jollibee, Red Ribbon and Chowking. This location defiantly has very friendly staff, the restaurant is very neat and clean. The food really looks simply but its tasty.  I personally love to order the empanadas, Palabok platter, the spaghetti and some Ube shake goodness.

Wow, I am impressed!  If you&apos;ve never been to a filipino restaurant or tried filipino desserts, I&apos;d highly recommend that you come here.  Red Ribbon just opened up today and the first 30 customers got complimentary spongecake.  I also ordered two empenadas: one chicken, and one beef.  Both were made very well.  The texture of the crust was warm and soft while the insides were delicious , moist and tender.

Since my cousin works here, I will be coming here often to capitalize on the hookups but even without it, I would still come here all time time.  One empenada was $1.85. The chicken was a little better than the beef empenada but both were tasty.  I can&apos;t wait to try everything!

Try the classic dishes: sago gulaman, halo halo, and pancit palabok.  And as if its not good enough already, they have cupcakes! Zomg.  I&apos;m excited!

Also, as you might expect, its so clean you probably eat right off the floor, not that you would.  The decor is immaculate, modern, and easy on the eyes.

Come come come!

I love their Ensaimada&apos;s! If they sell just that, I&apos;d be perfectly okay with it :)
and
I just love how they&apos;re in Anaheim now because Cerritos is kind of far...

The downside:
I&apos;m not a big fan of their halo-halo, it was pretty bland and it didn&apos;t even have ube ice cream. I am still having a hard time trying to embrace the concept of a halo halo without Ube Ice Cream and its pretty hard to grasp. Maybe they didn&apos;t have ube when I went???

I got hooked at Red Ribbon Hollywood.  Why?  There Mango Cake...to die, the cakes if you have not tried these filipino cakes it is a must.  I am no genious but I do believe the sugar is half from any other cake and the frosting stuff is mixed and shreadded into the frosting.

STOPPPPPP........STOPPPPPPP.....STOPPPP....

I take everything back.  I drove here last night the service with very freindly young girls was great but since it&apos;s new and the amount of clientele this place brings they are still trying to figure out the traffic and serving the food.  I ordered my usual slices of mango cakes...they accepted to cut into a cake.  The cake sat on the back and the kids did not know nor did they know how to cut the cake into slices.  Finally, with my aid I alerted them that I was waiting for that cake.  I swear the slice was so small I sure would not pay that much for a tiny slice.

Furthermore, the cakes have decrease in size at least 35 percent.  That is not all, the way the mango cake is made is totally different from the others Red Ribbon I had become such fan.  The frosting no longer has that shredded mix fruit filling feeling anymore.

Now, the question is...is it just this one cause it&apos;s new or have the rest done the same thing minimizing the size of the cakes and the cake themselves.  uh!!!

So I sorta have a history with palabok.. I still remember the day when I first tried it and instantly fell in love with that oily noodle goodness; I even requested those huge palabok party platter trays for my birthday present (ya, I was that obsessed) when my Filipino friendds asked me what I wanted.

So I was very excited to try red ribbon when I found out that a location opened up in Anaheim. I tried the palabok, arroz Caldo and chicken empenada.

The palabok Herre surprisingly did not meet my expectations. It was kinda bland and I had to use a lot of lemon packets to make it taste better- maybe I&apos;ve been too spoiled with the homemade palabok I eat when I go to my friends&apos; houses. :/ it was decent, but I&apos;ve definitely had better.

Arroz caldo- this comes in a small styrofoam bowl and is pretty much porridge with who knows what. I think there were mushrooms, scallions, and pieces of meat? Not too sure.. but anyways I had a taste of it and thouht it was interesting. I think it might take some time to grow on me. However,  my bf liked this dish a lot and kept teling me that he could eat that for breakfast all the time

Chicken empenada- soo yummy! Probably my fave thing I tried out of the 3. The crust is perfectly baked to perfection and was soft and chewy. I would definitely recommend the chicken empenada :)

The interior seating area was Impeccably clean and the food seems fresh. Service was nice and friendly. Prices are decent/reasonable. Portions are kinda small so order some extra empenadas or try some bakery goods!

Fyi,  if you&apos;re someone who likes lemon/lime with your palabok, make sure to ask for some lemon packets at the counter :) they only give it to you if you ask.

I had to drive by a few times to find this place. They had a big sign for Jolibee but a itsy bitsy little sign for Red Ribbon Bakery. The place looks new and clean. They do have a variety of cakes but I went there just for their empada.

The girl at the counter is friendly and she seems happy to be working there, which is good. I will come back to get their cakes.

Halo Halo! This spot just opened and it&apos;s connected to Jolibee. I&apos;ve never heard of this place until I read about it on OCREGISTER.COM They have bakery foods like cakes and cupcakes. They also have the also Filipino deserrt &quot;Halo halo&quot; That&apos;s the only thing I came here to get. It has two scoops of ice cream vanilla and taro. Also comes with coconut type of milk and a ton of sweet beans and jelly fruits in it. Such a great dish. The rest of the bakery didn&apos;t look too impressive. If you want some dessert that&apos;s different try the halo halo.

My boyfriend and I stopped at this new Red Ribbon Bakery yesterday after eating dim sum for lunch.  This shop is pretty spacious for a bakery.  There are so many yummy-looking cakes here!  I ended up getting a Chocolate Dream cupcake, which was $1.50.  It was a good cupcake - a nice dessert :)

Red Ribbon has finally crossed over to the Orange curtain....well, they arrived on the border and it&apos;s a start!  I&apos;ve been a fan of the Cerritos and Glendale locations for years because of their delish pancit palabok.  So, I was excited when a group of us went to the newest credit card accepting location in Anaheim.

My friend told me that Red Ribbon and Jollibees has common ownership.  So, it made sense that the Red Ribbon was connected with Jollibees in the Anaheim location.  Both are located in the same random strip mall as Kapit Bahay.  Hmm, competition.....berry, berry, good!  There is plenty of free parking but it gets busy...especially during the prime lunch and dinner hours.

We arrived at the lunch hour and it was pretty packed.  We stood in line and I ordered:

(1)  Palabok Petite w/ Arroz Con Pollo Caldo Cup Combo - $6.20
I typically just order the pancit palabok but it was a cold day and I needed something to warm my bones.  Red Ribbon offers combos now so I ordered the palabok with the aroz caldo cup ...fantastic!
- Pancit Palabok - 1/2 order of the palabok was served with an angel hair type of pasta with an orange sauce, sautéed pork, fried garlic, smoked fish flakes, green onions and eggs. Delish!
-  Arroz Con Pollo Caldo - Chicken and rice congee garnished with green onions, fried garlic and shiitake mushrooms.  Very tasty!
- A slice of cake - Mango Cheesecake
You had a choice of 4 different slices of cake.....nice!  I saved my slice for my dinner dessert which was mango puree over moist cream cheese on a crunchy almond crust topped with a fruit medley.  Just Heavenly.
-  Choice of Drink - Can of Diet Pepsi
My combo meal was served fresh and tasty.   4 Stars

(2)  Fresh Lumpia - $3.95
Sautéed vegetables in chicken dressing wrapped in a crepe, glazed with peanut sauce and topped with ground-roasted peanuts.  Delish but pricey.  3 Stars

My generous friend wanted us to try the Red Ribbon&apos;s Tres Leches cake - $14.99
The cake is made from butter cake soaked in three kinds of milk and topped with cream and assorted fruits. OMG, damn great!  4 Stars!

In addition to my dine in experience at Red Ribbon&apos;s for lunch, I also ordered a to-go order of the pancit palaboks for $3.95 each.  When I got home and re-heated the palabok for hubby and sonny boy, I noticed there wasn&apos;t enough of the palabok sauce on the noodles.  Not good...... please add more sauce!  To Go Order = 3 Stars

My lunch experience at the newest Red Ribbon location was pleasant, tasty, and satisfying.  I&apos;m just wondering if the Jollibees drive thru service includes the Red Ribbon menu.   I&apos;ll be back!  4 Stars!
