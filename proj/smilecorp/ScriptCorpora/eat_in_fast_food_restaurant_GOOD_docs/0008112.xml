Confusion on calorie counting??
 Next Discussion» From: mymiles Posted: May-29 07:01 AM (1 of 9) 

I looked up Taco salad earlier and found Taco Bell&apos;s Taco salad listed as 906 calories, looking further down the line I found Taco Bell&apos;s Taco salad with salsa at 850 calories. Why would the one with more goodies be less calories? Can someone explain what I&apos;m doing wrong? It&apos;s one of the fast food items I like, and never realized how high it was...yikes; but am confused now about how I&apos;m checking stuff.

Thanks

Sandy

I&apos;m right there with you on this. It&apos;s so hard to figure out exactly how many calories something has. I find I&apos;m having to break down every morsel to try to get the figures. Like a ham and cheese sandwich - you have to figure out the bread then the meat then the cheese. It makes me crazy!

Don&apos;t know any shortcuts to this one. Count, count, count!

You&apos;ll need to keep your eye open on several of these items. There are a few items I have pulled up that have two different calorie counts (some based on serving size), but it is still hard to go through the long lists to find certain things, especially when you know the calories based on the package, and it doesn&apos;t match what you are pulling up. Let me know if I can help you out when you need it.

I know counting calories is why we are all here.  Wish we had a more accurate data base on this website.  This whole weight loss thing can be overwhelming at times. I&apos;m doing good, just to write down everything I&apos;ve been eating.

I have found that I can go to Google and type in the name of the Fast Food restaurant and the words Nutritional Value and get pretty accurate information. Hope that helps! I can tell you that BW3&apos;s does not have ANY nutritional value information available. I&apos;ve written to their headquarters, and they seem to think people don&apos;t care any way. I happen to have their chicken wings, nonbreaded or fried, once a week, so it&apos;s hard to calculate calories.

I see what you mean about the serving siz in the drop down box and I&apos;ve been trying to notice that but even with that I found 7 or 8 listings for spinach salad, that say serving and vary considerably on calories. Many of the items I&apos;ve added so far I&apos;ve not had bag or label type info...then I also wonder...what about all the stuff in the salad...I&apos;m trying not to go with the one listed with the lower counts as that I&apos;m afraid will give me a false since of how I&apos;m doing??

 The best way to ensure you are using the correct calories for an item is to go directly to the site. So if you looking to see how much a taco salad from Taco Bell is, go to Taco Bells website to check if it matches up with the results from a search on this site. You may have to add the foods into your MY FOOD section to get the proper totals. It may seem a little time consuming to add those things into your MY FOOD section but in the long run it&apos;s a big help. When I go to Taco Bell I usually get their taco salad with no beans, sour cream or lime strips and all I have to do is go into my foods and add it to my journal. I usually check the calories on my other food packages also. Hope this helps!

It is confusing. Sometimes, I&apos;ll click on a couple and use the middle of the two. But somewhere deep within, I don&apos;t feel it&apos;s right.

Your taco salad without the salsa may weigh more than the one without (I don&apos;t know how). Check out the link below. It is a calculator on the website. I was surprised to find out that they actually have two taco salads (I love them too) and they are very different caloriewise.
