 Creek Week 

Creek Week is a week-long celebration of our local creeks.  Throughout the Russian River and Santa Rosa Creek areas, cities, counties and other stewardship organizations are coming together to declare September 17 - 24 as&quot;Creek Week&quot;.  This will be a time of fun and adventure, with educational activities for everyone at your local creeks and nature areas.  All our creeks are a rich and diverse system which provides water supply, wildlife habitat, flood capacity, recreation, and aesthetic values to all who live in and visit them.

Pollution, trash and debris damages the aesthetic and biological qualities of local waterways, impacting current efforts to restore and enhance habitat for fish and wildlife.  The health of our creeks and rivers depends on us. Look through the events below for ways to enjoy, learn and care for your creeks.
