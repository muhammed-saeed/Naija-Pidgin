Architecture of Services per Table
 

 
 
 
Hi,
Let&apos;s say you have N tables, and you want to write CRUD as per table not in an OO fashio.
How many WCF services are required?
is it near 5 * N (C,U,D, R and List with different criteria)?
Or would you have 1 service that takes care of all the CRUD?
What would be the interface (parameters) passed to such a service.
The number does not really matter, in fact the only thing I care about is the architecture.
If you are not able to provide detailed answers, please point me to where I can learn more about this.
Thank you.

EK
