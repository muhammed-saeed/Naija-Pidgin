OGDEN—The condition of one of the two remaining Ogden police officers who are hospitalized was downgraded Thursday.


A spokesman at McKay-Dee Hospital Center announced Thursday that officer Michael Rounkles&apos; condition had been downgraded from fair to serious condition.


Rounkles reportedly watched the funeral Wednesday for his fallen comrade, Ogden police officer Jared Francom, on an iPad from the hospital.

 Remembering him as a man who was devoted to his family, his job and the Dallas Cowboys, friends, family members and hundreds of law enforcement officers from across Utah and the U.S. said goodbye Wednesday to Ogden police officer Jared Daniel Francom. 
Rounkles was shot on the night of Jan. 4 when members of the Weber-Morgan Narcotics Strike Force served a search warrant on a home at 3268 Jackson Ave. Francom was killed in the incident. Rounkles was shot in the leg next to his femoral artery. The bullet was reportedly still lodged inside and it&apos;s unknown if it has been removed.


Also shot and injured were Ogden police officers Shawn Grogan and Kasey Burrell, Weber County Sheriff&apos;s Sgt. Nate Hutchinson and Roy police officer Jason VanderWarf.


Burrell remained hospitalized Thursday in fair condition.


The alleged gunman, Matthew Stewart, 37, was at last word still hospitalized with injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening. However, investigators have refused to talk about his condition or location, other than to say he is under guard.
