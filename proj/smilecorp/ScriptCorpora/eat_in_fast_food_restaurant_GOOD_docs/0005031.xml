Mexico City&apos;s Airport, a Busy Crazy Place 

Overview
 Quote: Our airport has been plagued with problems for many years, with Mexico city being one of the largest in Earth, the need to travel by plane has been increasing year by year and the airport is in urgent need to grow or move. The second option was canceled by political pressure. Now, the option involves splitting part of the traffic to nearby Toluca airport. Today, the construction of a second terminal is almost finished and the old one has been subjected to major renovations and extensive surgery to modernize it&apos;s structure.

Read More Our airport has been plagued with problems for many years, with Mexico city being one of the largest in Earth, the need to travel by plane has been increasing year by year and the airport is in urgent need to grow or move. The second option was canceled by political pressure. Now, the option involves splitting part of the traffic to nearby Toluca airport.

Today, the construction of a second terminal is almost finished and the old one has been subjected to major renovations and extensive surgery to modernize it&apos;s structure.
Quick Tips:
Lack of proper signs to direct you to your destination has been one of the major problems, so be aware and have a map of the airport before your arrival.
The western half of the airport is for domestic flights and the eastern one is for international ones. If you have connecting flights, be sure you have enough time and ask your airline for help as soon as you land, because the is no internal people-mover, though there will be when Terminal 2 is operating on the other side of the landing strips, and the distance is a long one. You may have to walk half a mile from one end to the other in the worst case.
Best Way To Get Around:
Once you arrive at the airport by air, you need to get to the baggage claim area, but first you should pass through immigration. There are different halls, M1 and M2, which depends if you are arriving from South and Central America or from the rest of the world. The &quot;special&quot; treatment at M1 is because of all the drug related issues.
After you clear immigration, you have to pick up your luggage and after that you have two options for your customs hall, but they depend solely on which carousel your luggage comes to.
If you don´t have a pre-arranged shuttle, then is better to only use the authorized taxis, there may be some guys that will offer you a cheaper ride, but beware they may have bad intentions. Just ignore them as you would with a drug dealer. Read Less

Like any fast food in an airport, the prices are a bit above the average for the food but, in this case, is not too bad. It is still affordable if you are traveling on a budget and, more importantly, is tasty and filling.

I ordered the Salbutes with cochinita—you can order them with chicken pibil, but I wanted to try the pork first—and I was pleasantly surprised to get three well-sized fried tortillas with lots of toppings. In other places they just put a whisper of lettuce or avocado, here they are not shy and put proper rations. The price, just 39 pesos which is just 9 pesos above what you pay for three tacos in any local taqueria, not bad for being located at the airport. Service is very attentive, you order and pay and they will take your food to your table. It just took three minutes, less than what I had waited for a McD burger in a not so crowded restaurant. This is supposed to be fast food. Read Less
