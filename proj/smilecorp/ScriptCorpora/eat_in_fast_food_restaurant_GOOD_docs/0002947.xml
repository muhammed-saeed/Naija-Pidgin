Are you in the market for large quantities of art or print framing equipment? These economical poster frames are priced for bulk purchases! The plastic construction enables lower pricing, which in turn results in more savings for customers. The ready-made poster frames come in all kinds of sizes and styles to suit any number of applications. Shoppers can also select from a wide variety of color options, so matching particular postings or sign displays is a breeze. Poster frames, sometimes referred to as readymade picture hangers, enable users to maintain the quality of their graphics for years to come. Don&apos;t just roll up that old movie bill. Put it up for all to see! These poster frames are well worth the investment, considering they hardly cost anything to begin with. Peruse the comprehensive selection to discover the full gamut of choices. AllPosterFrames.com sells premium poster frame solutions at wholesale to allow businesses, organizations, and individuals to afford the supplies they need. Read on to learn more about these great picture holders.
 In what configurations can a cheap poster frame be purchased? 
 Thin plastic slide-off displays feature four separate edges that fit together around picture inserts. These designs come with either corrugated cardboard back panels or rigid plastic backers that provide support to print art. Decorative plastic models are manufactured from lightweight, molded polystyrene material. Each includes a non-reflective, clear overlay to protect sign or picture presentations. There is a very large assortment of colors, dimensions, and styles, as well. The main selling point of these units is that they emulate similar wood or metal frames without carrying the same price tag. In fact, most passersby will not be able to tell the difference when standing five or more feet away. Why pay more when you can get the same look for less? With their clear PVC makeup, ready-made print sleeves will call attention to postings rather than the framework itself. Additionally, the plastic substrates are lightweight and won&apos;t cause damage to walls or windows when displayed. The sleeve configuration has the inherent ability to protect art from dust, fingerprints, and other damaging factors. Many of these versions double your advertising power. Just load two back-to-back images and fasten the unit to a transparent surface, such a window or glass door panel. 
 What features do the ready-made print hangers offer? 
 The &quot;CCF&quot; series incorporates 1/8&quot; thick corrugated cardboard backing. It is important to note that this material is relatively thin and may bow in some areas, especially with larger sizes. Again, these selections are intended to be economy solutions. The included moldings measure 1/2&quot; thick and have a Mylar coating for longevity. The &quot;CF&quot; series is slightly more expensive and the main difference is that the backboard is made from black, 1/8&quot; corrugated plastic. This substrate is stiff and less susceptible to bowing than cardboard. The bordering is also thick, measuring 3/4&quot;. In addition, an inner lip surrounds the edging to help securely hold the postings. The PVC models are available a couple different ways. Some have included suction cups for fast and easy mounting to windows, doors, and other non-porous surfaces. Others have predrilled holes for attachment to walls. Every one of these models is loaded through a slide-in slot for effortless print changes and updates. Furthermore, they all have adhesive tape enclosed as an additional option for installation. A few characteristics are shared by every model. First, any of the styles can be presented either vertically or horizontally. Secondly, a lens is either engineered-in or comes as a component, so art inserts remain protected. The sizes have been standardized to enable a proper print fit for every consumer. Although not all come in the following sizes, the majority of them are available with 11&quot; x 17&quot;, 16&quot; x 20&quot;, 18&quot; x 24&quot;, 22&quot; x 28&quot;, 24&quot; x 36&quot;, 27&quot; x 40&quot;, and 27&quot; x 41&quot; dimensions. 
 
Now that each style has been detailed, let&apos;s find how what kinds of applications are optimal for the poster framing. Of course, these models are ideally intended for those looking for an inexpensive way to frame art, a sign, a notice, a movie poster, or other marketing advertisement. The &quot;CF&quot; and &quot;CCF&quot; lines work well in retail stores, restaurants, and shopping malls, where they showcase larger postings. They can also be set up in casual business offices, college campuses, and even children&apos;s rooms in homes. Because they are such a cheap option, anyone from a corporate office manager to a hobbyist can afford the art hanging fixtures. The decorative models work for more sophisticated environments, but they can be employed anywhere. The sleeve styles are perfect as a means to share information that frequently changes. For example, a fast food restaurant or bank may use the sign holders to display certification, limited-time offers, and terms of service. No matter what you intended use is, there is a style that will get the job done!
