 Don&apos;t Let Your Spring Break Adventure and Relaxation Turn Into a Tragedy 
 | Share 
It is said that March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb and with it the ritual of spring break. Every year at this time, teens in dorm rooms across the country and families are planning their dream vacations seeking adventure and excitement. Unfortunately, as an experienced Pennsylvania accident lawyer , I find that our phones are ringing during spring break with tragic accidents involving over-consumption of alcohol or drugs resulting in car accidents, balcony falls, or sexual assaults. Additionally, many spring break tourists are vulnerable to robberies, pick pockets, sexual assault, and physical assault in foreign hotels or condominiums that do not provide proper security for fare paying guests.

Keep in mind when traveling on foreign roadways during spring break that you may not be familiar with often dangerous on- and off-ramps or confusing signage. Many times there are highway and roadway defects. If you are abroad, drivers often drive in a different and more erratic fashion, and may be more frequently under the influence of alcohol. If you are using a taxi, make sure that you are in a legitimate and regulated taxi and always wear a seat belt, and if traveling by bus try to sit in the rear in case an accident occurs. 

Almost every year, we hear the tragic stories of teenagers who die falling from hotel balconies while intoxicated. Statistics indicate that teenagers at famed spring break resorts such as Fort Lauderdale and Daytona Beach are at an increased risk of car accidents due to driving while intoxicated.

A recent study published in the Journal of American College Health has noted that the average male is reported to consume 18 drinks per day and the average woman 10 drinks per day during spring break. More than half of all men and 40% of all women drank until they became sick or passed out at least once during spring break.

Obviously, injuries sustained during spring break resulting from over-intoxication of alcohol include death from automobile accidents, drowning, falls, amusement park and water park accidents, in addition to other mishaps.

If you are on spring break and you or a loved one suffers a serious injury or wrongful death, our attorneys are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for a free, no obligation consultation. Please be safe and in the words of Louis Pasteur, “Chance favors the prepared mind”. Contact us toll free at 1-800-421-9595 or online at www.reiffandbily.com.

 Who Is Responsible When A Car Crashes Through The Window Of A Restaurant Or Other Business Establishment Killing Individuals And Seriously Injuring Others 
 | Share 
This past weekend, I was asked to comment on a case where a car slammed into a restaurant, broke through the walls, and injured a number of customers killing another innocent and unknowing victim who was dining. The initial investigation of the incident revealed that the elderly driver of the car meant to hit the brakes but instead pressed the gas pedal crashing into the building.

Just last year, I was consulted on a similar case where an elderly gentleman also erroneously hit the accelerator pedal rather than the brake and crashed through the walls of fast food restaurant catastrophically injuring innocent patrons. This unfortunate scenario is more common than one can imagine.

A skilled catastrophic injury and wrongful death lawyer experienced in the arena of restaurant crash accidents, premise liability , car accident law , and automotive product liability should immediately begin a comprehensive investigation of the facts and work closely with authorities and independent investigators to determine the causation of the accident. Often many complex theories of law become intertwined in the investigation and litigation of car crash into restaurant cases.

The experienced Pennsylvania product liability , premise liability , and car accident lawyers of Reiff and Bily works with experienced and independent structural engineers, architects, building, safety, OSHA, and cognitive behavioral assessment experts to carefully analyze the facts of each individual case. We request that our experts credibly opine about the inadequacy of curb and building structures, as well as immediately look for product defects on the striking vehicle including but not limited to; defective braking system , failure of steering system , or faulty acceleration .

There are many ways that a vehicle crash into a restaurant can occur. Perhaps the driver was intoxicated or under the influence of mind altering drugs or prescriptions. Perhaps the driver was speeding, or perhaps there was a defect with the vehicle that prevented the driver from stopping or having his vehicle under control.

At any rate, one thing is for certain, when innocent bystanders are harmed due to a car accident or premise liability claim such as this, they are entitled to have a full independent investigation completed by an experienced car accident and premise liability attorney who understands how in just a matter of seconds a victim and their family’s lives can be changed. The victim and their family have a right to expect that they will be entitled to recover monetary damages for the harm caused to them by the wrongdoers.

The experienced Pennsylvania car accident , premise liability , and product liability lawyers of Reiff and Bily have over 30 years of experience representing the interests of catastrophically injured victims and their families, offering a free no obligation consultation and a zero recovery, no fee guarantee.

 Why Is It That U.S. Automobile Manufacturers Have Different And Often Less StringentSafety Requirements Than Foreign Manufacturers And We Have Many Times Discovered The Same Automobile Manufacturer Is Creating Safer Products In Europe Than In the United S 
 | Share 
The National Highway Safety Administration is charged with writing and enforcing safety, theft resistance, and fuel economy guidelines for motor vehicles. However, as an experienced Pennsylvania automobile product liability attorney who has handled a substantial number of catastrophic car accident cases, I am well aware that these are only minimal standards and guidelines.

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, (FMVSS), are regulations written in terms of the minimum safety performance requirements for motor vehicles, motor vehicle items, and motor vehicle equipment. Many of the big auto makers take pride in announcing that their vehicles meet these “minimal&quot; standards, however, a safely designed car should exceed these standards, especially if there is a safer design alternative.

In 1980, NHTSA recognized the need for safer interiors of vehicles and identified improvements to padding and cushioning in the event of an accident. In 1989, the application of one inch of padding was required to interior surfaces which was indicated to reduce head trauma by half as much. The Department of Transportation estimated the cost of padding all roof, rails, and areas likely to have an impact was approximately $33 per car.

Safety is not one thing, it’s everything. Understanding that NHTSA or FMVSS government standards are only minimal guidelines and applying conventional wisdom that cars and motor vehicles should be safe makes it intolerable and unacceptable when automobile manufacturers cut corners and emphasize safety over profits. While automobile manufacturers always speak about compliance with federal standards, standard testing typically does not call for all types of situations or applications.

Keeping this in mind, if you or a loved one has been involved in a serious motor vehicle accident, you may want to contact an experienced car accident and automotive product liability attorney to fully evaluate your claim and search the road less traveled for answers and proper compensation. The experienced Pennsylvania car accident and automotive product liability lawyers of Reiff and Bily always offer a free, no obligation consultation.

 A Tire Tread Separation Often Results In Lose Of Control Of A Vehicle With Tragic Consequences 
 | Share 
How many times have you been driving down the highway and seen treads, shredded tires, or torn pieces of tires sitting on the side of the road on the shoulder. The sale of used tires and retreaded tires is booming. While a significant number of vehicle crashes are caused as a result of tire failures , and even though the purchaser believed they were getting safe tires based upon the visual conditions, many times the bargain leads to a catastrophic accident. Many times tires possess defects that cannot be easily detected visually. Oxidation or micro-cracks in tires can lead to a catastrophic tread or belt separation . However, unfortunately, the age of a tire does not prevent it from being sold at a cheap price on the used tire market or the retread market.

We recently successfully resolved a case where a tire experienced a belt separation causing the vehicle to lose control. The tire manufacturer claimed there was no defect on the tire. Most times, the tire installer or customer does not possess the ability to spot loose cords or belt separation in a tire, and unfortunately used tires are not subject to any federal standards. The road fitness of a tire is governed only under state tread depth laws.

Every year thousands of people will die and even more will be catastrophically injured due to the use of defective retread tires on vehicles. Environmentalists claim that retreading tires saves huge amounts of natural resources as opposed to replacing worn tires. However, safety should always take priority over profitability. Simply put, retread tires are second hand tires that have just been recoated with a tread veneer creating a potentially volatile situation.

At approximately 8:45 a.m. on Wednesday, July 27th, I was traveling southbound on a Philadelphia highway at approximately 50 mph when all of a sudden, a pickup truck marked prominently with the name of a landscaper and pulling equipment in a trailer went out of control, spun around, and crossed the lanes of traffic. Thankfully no one was injured in this accident and the trailer was slightly damaged, but as the driver pulled over, I noticed that the trailer did not appear to be properly attached and there were no safety chains. Furthermore, I did not notice operating brake lights working on the trailer. The trailer contained landscaping equipment that was not secured. Luckily it did not flip over. Believe it or not, the driver of the trailer pulled, resettled the trailer, and proceeded down the expressway at a high rate of speed, and in this detached and unhitched trailer attorney’s opinion, this situation represents an accident waiting to happen.

Unfortunately many such trailers may be homemade and are purposely made to be under the weight of 3,000 lbs. meaning they are not subject to regulation. Many state laws, including those in Pennsylvania, are silent as to the design and construction specification of such vehicles including towing safety chains or hitches. While this accident that I witnessed representing a situation of luck in terms of timing calls to attention the unregulated and un-policed state of the trailer industry and the trucks pulling trailers. Unfortunately there is no uniform system for reporting injuries or accidents and henceforth are many unreported dangers that will kill or catastrophically injure other innocent and unknowing victims.

The defective trailer accident and unsecured cargo lawyers of Reiff&amp;Bily have decades of experience investigating and litigating unsecured trailer accidents and those accidents involving unsecured cargo that falls on a roadway. We have recently joined forces with the experienced defective trailer accident lawyers of the Beasley Firm to create the Beasley Reiff Law Group and employee a most experienced group of investigators and experts to determine how trailer and unsecured cargo accidents occur and who is liable. Since 1955, our skilled lawyers have together been awarded over two billion dollars on behalf of injured victims and their families. Our skilled unhitched trailer and unsecured cargo accident attorneys have been recognized as possessing the highest possible ratings in both legal ability and ethical standards and have been noted to be among the top attorneys in Pennsylvania and the nation.

 Airbags and Seat Belts Must Work Together As They Are Complimentary In Fashion and A Failure Of Any Components Can Be Catastrophic 
 | Share 
As an experienced Pennsylvania airbag defect lawyer who also litigates many auto defect cases involving seat belt design defects and flaws, it is important to understand that airbags and seat belts compliment each other in their function and new automotive technology has advanced to the point where airbag systems and occupant restraints are completely intertwined. Most airbag sensor modules report back to an event data recorder. A poorly designed airbag sensor will often deprive the occupant of pretensioner on the seat belt. Load limiters are specifically designed to work with airbags and if an airbag fails to deploy a seat belt can spool out dangerously exposing the occupant to a catastrophic injury and unfortunately many times a fatality. The intertwining of the smart systems controlling airbags and seat belts in vehicles requires a non-failure and proper design of the load limiters and pretensioners.

A poorly designed occupant classification sensor often results in the failure of an airbag to deploy. It is important in any type of airbag and seat belt failure case to immediately secure the vehicle and avoid spoilation of evidence so that valuable forensic evidence can be collected from the date recorders, as well as vehicle examination, to support a seat back or airbag defect claim.

Unfortunately, our office was just retained in a tragic case where a child was brain damaged and lost vision only to discover that the prior lawyer who handled the case never sent a non-spoilation letter and failed to preserve the evidence. Despite the fact that the first attorney has repeatedly informed the clients that the vehicle was in a secure and safe environment, the vehicle turned out to be left in a junk yard with the allegedly defective components cannibalized and the vehicle became a storage facility for used tires.

 Many Times Truck Drivers Do Not See Pedestrians When They Are Walking Across The Street And Unfortunately A Wrongful Death Is Often The Consequence 
 | Share 
Approximately 30 years ago, I represented the family of a working man who was struck by the rear wheels of a tractor trailer while it was making too narrow a turn from one of the narrow streets in Philadelphia to a main roadway. In the process of the turn, the left rear wheels of the tractor trailer came up on the sidewalk and struck and crushed an innocent victim. The truck driver claimed that he never saw the victim. What most pedestrians do not understand is that large trucks have a blind spot in the front and the rear of the vehicle. Crowded city streets pose navigation problems for major trucks particularly in pedestrian crowded areas. Some trucks are outfitted with a convex mirror that will help improve visibility and reduce the risk of pedestrian accidents. However, many trucks still do not have this simple fix which would eliminate the truck driver’s blind spot to allow them to clearly see the pedestrians crossing in front of them and behind the truck.

The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that more than 66% of pedestrians killed by trucks weighing more than 10,000 lbs. were initially impacted in front of the truck many due to this blind spot which would be avoided by the convex mirror.

Recently the legislators of New York state introduced a bill requiring all trucks, trailers, and tractor trailers with a gross weight of over 26,000 lbs. or more to be equipped with crossover convex mirrors when operating in New York City. Believe it or not, the mirror heads themselves only cost $10 to $29 each and assembly kits are $23 to $57 each, a simple fix and an inexpensive cost that would save lives.

If you or a loved one has been involved in a truck related accident, the experienced Pennsylvania truck accident lawyers of Reiff&amp;Bily understand the ins and outs of trucking law and will work 110% to recover financial damages sustained. We have successfully represented over three generations of victims and their families since 1979 and have recently joined forces with the Beasley Firm to create the Beasley Reiff Law Group . Together our attorneys have been awarded billions of dollars since 1958. Contact us toll free at 1-800-421-9595 or online at www.reiffandbily.com .

 Your Seat Belt May Be The Number One Safety Feature In Your Automobile. However, Without A Properly Functioning Airbag, It Is Often Not Enough 
 | Share 
As an experienced auto defect and car accident lawyer for decades, I was a person who went from almost never wearing a seat belt to always wearing a seat belt. l now always make sure that my airbags are properly operating without the sensor turned to an off position. It is well recognized that seat belts are the number one safety feature in vehicles but without supplementation of a properly operating airbag it may not be enough to avoid a catastrophic injury or wrongful death in a collision. Many vehicles have an acronym SRS on the steering wheel or dashboard which translated is a short cut for “supplemental restraint system&quot;. What this means is that airbags supplement seat belts. Trust me, I have investigated the most horrific accidents and tragedies that are seemingly beyond imagination which were caused by the failure to wear a seat belt or the failure of the seat belt, airbag, or SRS systems.

Most modern vehicles contain multiple airbags in various locations which are designed to inflate if an occupant is correctly restrained with a seat belt. There are various systems used in airbag and SRS designs and often due to manufacturing and design defects or sensor defects, the SRS system does not operate properly. Many systems have a light indicator on the dashboard which will stay lit or blink off and on if there is a noted problem or defect with the airbag or SRS system. If you notice this light, immediately take your car to the dealership as an improper airbag or SRS system can lead to catastrophic injury or death in an accident situation.

 Ford Hit With $19 Million Dollar Verdict In Alleged Seat Belt Defect Case When Vehicle Rolled Over 
 | Share 
The driver of a 1998 Ford Winstar, Eric Polston, was paralyzed in December 2005 when his vehicle began to rollover. Although the driver was wearing a seat belt during the course of the a href=&quot;http://www.reiffandbily.com/lawyer-attorney-1325464.html&quot;&gt;van rollover , he was ejected from the vehicle and sustained paralyzing injuries. A product liability claim was brought against the Ford Motor Company focusing on a defective design of the seat belt buckle and particularly the release button housed within the buckle of the restraint system. Plaintiff’s lawyers argued that the design utilized by Ford featured a protruding button. The top of the button was located above the top of the buckle permitting easier access to the button. The protrusion of the button renders the design of the buckle defective and unreasonably dangerous because it presents an unnecessary hazard for inadvertent release. By the late 1990&apos;s, the entire automobile industry including Ford moved away from the protruding buckle to a safer flush design.

If you or a loved one has sustained a catastrophic injury or wrongful death due to a defectively designed product, please feel free to contact one of the experienced Pennsylvania product liability lawyers of Reiff&amp;Bily. Effective January 1, 2011, the Pennsylvania product liability law of Reiff&amp;Bily has joined forces with the legendary Beasley Firm and collectively since 1958, both firms have been awarded in excess of $2 billion dollars representing the rights of catastrophically injured individuals throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and United States.

 Hit And Run Snow Plow Accidents Kill, Injure, And Destroy Property Resulting In Outrage 
 | Share 
In less than 24 hours, three different innocent individuals were either injured or killed when struck by snow plows. Other innocent property owners, including myself suffered plow related property damage by hit and run snow plow drivers.

In Delaware, 51-year old Denise McFadden was walking on the Washington Street Extension. The snow plow driver made a U-turn and fatally struck Ms. McFadden. She was pronounced dead at the scene due to severe head injuries .

In Milford, Police continue to investigate a hit and run accident that occurred at the intersection of High Street and Drain Place, where an unidentified woman was struck by a snow plow. The driver of the snow plow left the scene of the accident.

In Maryland, Richard Francis Ogles was walking along Mountain Road when he was fatally struck by a snow plow. The driver of the snow plow left the scene of the accident. Mr. Ogles was pronounced dead at an area hospital.

Extreme caution must be taken when operating a snow plow. Unfortunately, before, during, and after a snow fall, especially a large snow storm, both State and privately owned and operated snow plow drivers are working long hours, double time, and sometimes even triple time. In addition to driver exhaustion there could be decreased visibility due to the poor weather conditions. When you have the combination of driver exhaustion and poor visibility behind the wheel of a snow plow, it can only lead to a disaster.

Snow plow accidents can lead to traumatic brain injuries or head injuries, skull fractures, spinal cord injuries or broken backs, crush injuries, and other devastating injuries, including death.

Twice in the last two weeks, a snow plow charging down my road struck at least 3 mailboxes breaking off cast aluminum stands like they were toothpicks. Yesterday, I was forced into a snowdrift while another snowplow, driving seemingly beyond the speed limit on an icy downhill suburban road, took over the highway without due regard for anybody else on the roadway. After all of these incidents, the snow plows kept going without regard for the damages inflicted. When I filed a claim with the township, I was told that these events are not as uncommon as one would think.

Since 1979, the experienced Philadelphia wrongful death and negligence law firm of Reiff&amp;Bily has aggressively represented clients and their families who have been injured or killed by negligent snow plow drivers. Effective January 1, 2011 the Reiff&amp;Bily law firm has joined forces with the legendary Beasley Firm in Philadelphia who since 1958 has been awarded over $2 billion dollars on behalf of their clients and have hundreds of millions and multi-million dollar verdicts, settlements, and awards to their credit.

 It’s About Time That Toyota And Other Japanese Manufacturers Agree To Provide Black Box Readers To Regulators - Frustrated Auto Product Liability Lawyer Weighs In 
 | Share 
As an experienced automotive product liability lawyer , my legal brethren and myself who dedicate their practices to automotive product liability and consumer safety have been all too frustrated many times over the past few years when we attempt to download the black boxes from Toyotas and other Japanese auto manufacturers. More so than any other automakers that we litigate against, many of the Japanese automakers have placed roadblocks in our path in making data from black boxes accessible. Yoshimi Inaba, the President of Toyota North America, told a Senate Committee on Tuesday, March 2nd that the company would be delivering three data readers to the National Highway Safety Administration on Wednesday, March 3rd and that the company hoped to make the data more accessible to other systems by the middle of 2011.

Quite frankly as an experienced product liability lawyer who has had vast experience with the downloading of black boxes and the evaluation of data, I am curious why only three data readers are only being made available and why the consumer public and experts must wait until the middle of 2011 to receive more accessibility when citizens lives are knowingly in danger. Once again, it seems that profitability is being stressed over public safety in this game of hide and seek by Toyota. I have always believed that if you are confronted with a problem or safety issue, get the facts out there as soon as possible so other innocent victims are not killed or catastrophically injured .

I for one believe that Toyota is “hiding something&quot; and for a company that prides itself on integrity, they are certainly not doing a great job putting their cards on the table as surveys now reveal that more than half of the people out there are less likely to buy a Toyota. On the positive side for major U.S. automobile manufacturers, sales are up but many analysts claim its at Toyota’s expense. By the way, it is important to note that the black box recording devices utilized on Toyotas are not so dissimilar from black boxes utilized on American cars as common safety features. However, one important aspect is that Toyotas can only be read by Toyota technicians with specialized readers which is not the case with black boxes manufactured by U.S. car companies. As I review the congressional hearings, there is a theatrical ring about it. The answer is quite simple, “... without integrity nothing stands.&quot;

You can rest assured that the automotive product liability lawyers at Reiff&amp;Bily and many other fine lawyers committed to the cause around the United States of America will do their best to ferret out the truth in these matters.

 The United States Congress Committee On Oversight And Government Reform Reveals Evidence That Toyota Deliberately Withheld Relevant Electronic Records That It Was Legally Required to Produce 
 | Share 
In a letter from the United States Congress Committee on Oversight and Government Reform sent to Mr. Yoshimi Inaba as part of their investigation into Toyota’s handling of vehicle recalls arising from incidents of sudden acceleration, it was revealed that Toyota deliberately withheld relevant electronic records that it was legally required to produce in rollover litigation . Many of these documents concerned rollover cases where the plaintiff was injured or killed . The letter also goes on to note that Mr. Dimitrious Biller, who is managing counsel of the product liability group of Toyota Motor Sales and in a very senior position in which he lead the defense of some of the largest tort cases against Toyota, particularly rollover cases involving seriously injured victims, did not produce all of the requested documents during the litigation process. Biller was concerned with Toyota’s failure to produce electronic documents in litigation. The documents also indicate that Mr. Biller was concerned that Toyota’s interactions with NHTSA would be discovered. Finally the Biller documents shined light on Toyota’s handling of the sudden, unintended acceleration problem.

In summary, the Biller documents and Toyota documents indicate a systematic disregard for the law and a routine violation of court discovery orders in litigation . People injured in crashes involving Toyota vehicles may have been injured a second time when Toyota failed to produce relevant evidence to the court. This also raises very serious questions as to whether Toyota has withheld substantial relevant information from NHTSA.

As experienced product liability lawyers , we have been well aware of Toyota&apos;s posturing for many years and their refusal to play fair in the litigation process. We are currently investigating a number of Toyota airbag and sudden acceleration claims.
