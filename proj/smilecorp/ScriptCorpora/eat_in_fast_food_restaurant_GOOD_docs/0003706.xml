We have dined here often. The food is quite good for the value. The service is generally good and the atmoshere very basic. It is frequented by locals and is not easy to find. It is the best choice in Bennington for visitors for a good and hearty lunch.

Belly&apos;s Deli is conveniently located on Route 7 just before you get into the downtown area - we were pleased that they have their own parking lot. There were several families waiting for a table for breakfast but we figured they knew a good thing so we waited. We were right. Fresh, homemade breads and muffins - the most delicious... More

I ordered a turkey and bacon sandwich, and placed the order via phone, and while the sandwich was good—good portion... More

For over ten years whenever we&apos;re near Bennington at lunchtime, off we go to this neat deli which we discovered years ago when it was rated one of the top deli&apos;s in the Northeast by Yankee Magazine.
