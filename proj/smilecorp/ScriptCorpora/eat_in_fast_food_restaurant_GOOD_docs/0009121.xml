The Chicago Rude Restaurant?
 Everybody talks about the Chicago restuarant, where the staff is rude to you on purpose (its supposed to be funny) and people have a good time. Does anyone no the name of the place and if so is it fun and tasty food? Finally, is it a place that would be kid freindly?

Please help me out.

 Best Answer - Chosen by Voters
 Ed debevics and ***** Last Resort. They are both similar types of places. I would say Ed Debevics is more family oriented though. As for the food I would say its average at both. But its very popular.

Ed Debevic&apos;s
640 N Wells St
Chicago, IL
60610
Phone: (312) 664-1707

The Scene
Come on in and take a seat at Ed&apos;s down-home diner, where bobby-soxers, nerds, greasers and cheerleaders sing, dance and take your order. Retro relics and witty signs (&quot;No Shirt, No Shoes, No Pants, No Service&quot;) cover the walls. Bouncy tunes from the&apos;50s,&apos;60s and&apos;70s blast from the DJ booth overlooking the restaurant.

The Food
There&apos;s no kids&apos;menu here, but kid-friendly diner feasts like grilled cheese, macaroni and chicken tenders abound, along with comfort food classics like pot pies and meatloaf for older appetites. Bread pudding, pies and ice cream all make a great finish, but the World&apos;s Smallest Ice Cream Sundae is the most fun, featuring a tiny bit of ice cream, fudge and whipped cream served in a souvenir glass for just about a buck.


Dick&apos;s Last Resort
435 E Illinois
Chicago, IL
60611
Phone: (312) 836-7870

Expect a semi-tropical, ultra-casual place with tall drinks and no dress code (unless you count Hawaiian shirts, which are encouraged but not required). Popular with tourists, it&apos;s also a fave for bachelorette parties and rowdy brunch crowds. The all-purpose, Southern menu is heavy on seafood and barbecue items, many of which are served in stainless steel pails. Choices include shrimp, king crab, ribs, honey-roasted chicken and sides like cole slaw, fries and honey wheat bread.

 Dick&apos;s Last Resort is definitely noted for rude service with humor and is a chain across the U.S.
Sounds like Locals from Chicago are saying Ed&apos;s is similar.
Dick&apos;s is a sure bet, Ed&apos;s i&apos;d have to say look into it more.

 I think you are speaking of Ed Debevics, although the other answer of Dick&apos;s Last Resort is true also.

Ed&apos;s s a lot of fun. The food is pretty much diner fare, but it&apos;s good. Burgers are big and juicy. Kids would love this place. Dick&apos;s is a Dixieland restaurant/bar. Kids would not be as comfortable in there, although I have seen some in there before. The staff likes to ask women to autograph theri bras, then they hang them up on the bar. Funny, but not exactly for the kids.

 It is Ed Debevic&apos;s.A group of us went there for lunch one day, and the waiter kind of just threw the silverware on the table-I guess it was supposed to be funny. It&apos;s a 50&apos;s diner place. The kids would love it! They may make you get up and dance with the waitresses-they were dancing and singing when we were there. Have fun!

 You&apos;re thinking of Ed Dbevic&apos;s, at 640 N. Wells. If you&apos;re taking the El, you&apos;ll want the Grand stop on the Red Line.

I used to live in Chicago, and have been there once or twice, but it&apos;s mostly for tourists. The service is fun and funny, and it&apos;s certainly kid-friendly, but the food is sort of forgettable - just standard diner fare.

Expect a wait on a weekend night.

Have fun!

 ***** Last Resort. 435 E Illinois 312-836-7870. Been there twice. I had a great time. It is kid friendly but kids are not allowed after a certain time. The food is good too.

 Ed Debevics, definately. It&apos;s fun, if you know what to expect. The food is ok, you will mostly pay for the atmosphire. Kid friendly... well, maybe high school age and up, but not little kids. It&apos;s not really a place to go on a romantic date, or a family outing.
If it&apos;s family fun you want try ESPN Zone during the afternoon, the Rainforest Cafe (lots for the kids to see, food is good, but again, you&apos;ll mostly pay for the atmosphire), or you can try the Rock and Roll Cafe, if it&apos;s still there.
Hope that helps.
