Found the place online during our first trip to Tucson in 2009 and decided to give it a try. How happy I am we did! Now we visit it every time we go there (about twice a year). I have been to many Chinese restaurants all over the world but this place is special! I wish there was a place like that in San Diego!

The service was perfect - the timing, friendliness, everything - right on.
The food is great, the prices are amazing, most dishes at or under $10, nice and quiet place... just amazing! We&apos;ve tried a lot of their dishes. Haven&apos;t had a bad one. The Egg flower soup is amazing, pork egg rolls are excellent, chicken lo-mein is outstanding, the chicken chop suey, the special pork chops, etc... - all simply incredible. First time we were there on the way out we were told they had been in business for 41+ years! I can see why!

Outstanding food and service for average (or even bellow average) price!
Highly recommend!

man, i REALLY want to give these guys more stars, what with their recent renovations and their friendly owner, but i just can&apos;t. :(

this place is just up the block from me but we&apos;ve only been going once or twice a year for the past 5 years. it&apos;s excellent for the &quot;american-chinese&quot; palette, and it always seems to have great wok-hei when i walk by, but suffers from same-brown-sauce-itis...and no chow fun! at least the lo mein isn&apos;t half bad.

on a recent visit we went for the live music on a sunday evening. if the atmosphere hadn&apos;t been so nice (the live music was very enjoyable), this place would get one less star from me. we ordered a well vodka soda water and a grey goose martini and the bill was a smidge over $16 (WTF?!?). it took ten minutes for someone to wait on us after we were seated, and the drinks took an additional 20 minutes to come out. (i listened to 4 songs and changed my baby&apos;s diaper in that time). when they came out the martini was warm and served in a gimlet glass. my vodka soda water was in a small rocks glass and consisted mostly of ice. honestly, i left feeling a little violated.

in the past we have walked here with neighbors and gotten the meal-deals: one dish with side of rice, soup and i can&apos;t remember if there&apos;s an eggroll or not. i guess it&apos;s reasonably priced. also, i&apos;ve had their take out which took a little longer than i wanted to wait for. the recent renovations are excellent--nice patio, great street appeal with a tidy little pond, but i can&apos;t recommend the food if you&apos;re looking for authenticity. oh, and i can&apos;t recommend the service, either. lastly, if you are non-asian, you should feel at home with the clientele.

I have eaten at the Lotus Garden many times.  It&apos;s always a good experience.

When you enter this restaurant, you walk in through their high end liquor shop to the front counter.  I always enjoy browsing through the bottles of spirits and wine after finishing my meal, but I must admit I&apos;m not a big drinker and their high-end booze is out of my price range anyway.

I&apos;ve always been seated promptly upon arrival and the staff immediately brings a pot of hot, green tea to the table.  This is accompanied by a fortune cookie for everyone in the party.  The restaurant is quiet and is a great place to take a group for conversation.  As other reviewers have noted, the decorating is a bit dated, with a plethora of the pinks, blues, and whites that were so popular in the Southwest in the 1980&apos;s.  Even so, the place is clean and clearly well maintained.

Portions are a bit smaller than some of the other Chinese restaurants, but I always enjoy the food.  I usually get the Glazed Shrimp with Walnuts.  The shrimp are butterflied and cooked in a honey/cream sauce.  They&apos;re served on a bed of walnuts.  It&apos;s a great combination.  If you&apos;re getting this to share, just make sure to tell your friends that they may not pick out all of the walnuts -- which is what two of my friends like to do.  I&apos;ve also had the Sesame Beef and Orange Chicken here.  They&apos;re also both good.

The check arrives with a a side of almond cookies to finish the meal. Lotus Garden is my choice for Chinese food on the near Eastside/midtown.

If you like good wonton soup and traditional made egg foowoung, here is the best place to go. Their War wonton soup has shrimp, tender chicken meat, sweet BBQ pork, of course the hand made wonton, and it is a big big pot of soup. My husband and I love it. Every restruant has their specialties, you just need order the right food.trust me on this one, the War soup, and the egg foowoung. Not enough food? Then add a vegetable stir-fry rice, but you will have some leftover for next day for sure.
Excellent service! The quiet and clean atmosphere with the  life music really makes a special weekend.

Customer Service= A+++. Server was always on point, and they packed our left overs for us. Ambiance= A. However the outside is more modern than it&apos;s 80&apos;s revival indoors- This made it even more fun! The food was served with more than adequate portions, the brown rice was fluffy, and the tastes were good, and above average. I would return. -The gift shop has a lot to offer, as well as the wine shop.

Lotus Garden is classy and elegant, especially when compared to other nearby Chinese restaurants (the dilapidated Panda Village). I have gone twice in as many weeks because it is a great, clean place to take a family member, business associate, or significant other because the staff seems to make your business feel appreciated (nice touch with the hot tea and fortune cookies arriving as you sit at the table). The entrees are a minor grade above similar restaurants but seem to be more authentic. For example, the delicious crab puffs are prepared with real crabmeat and the vegetables do not taste like they came from a can (as I&apos;ve seen at many a Chinese restaurant). The portions do not appear large but I always have trouble completing 2/3 of my meal, not something that usually happens to me at Chinese restaurants.

The prices are a bit higher for similar fare at other places and my SO did not enjoy the soup (causing a slight rating drop) but it is something that the décor and staff make up for although some items could use a price drop.

The food here lands right in the middle of the scale at 2 1/2 stars. They get the rounding favor because of the service, quantity, selection and price... at lunch.

For $7.50 (lunch special) you can choose from a plethora of items and some even include shrimp. All come with a pork or vegetable egg roll, soup and your choice of white, fried or brown rice.

The soup is not bad. They also give you a bowl of crunchy chow mein noodles to add to your soup to provide some texture. The egg roll was pretty good. It comes cut into four bite sized pieces and is accompanied by hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce.

My beef lo mein seemed freshly prepared, but did lack in flavor. Likewise with the pork fried rice. I had to add soy sauce and hot mustard to kick up the flavor a little. I can&apos;t complain about the quantity of food I received.

I wish the food was better because it would be a regular lunch stop if it were. As it is, I will go back but probably only for lunch and only if it&apos;s someone else&apos;s idea.

This was our 2nd trip here. I waited to review since we ate here on Christmas and it wasn&apos;t a great trip.

But, we ate here last night  and I&apos;m glad I waited. We had a great meal and great service in a relaxing environment.

As other reviewers have said you get water, hot tea and fortune cookies as soon as you are seated.  The waitress came over quickly to get our drink order and answered our questions about the menu.

I ordered the Beef Lo Mein combo which comes with Egg Flower soup, Egg Roll (pork or veggie), shrimp tempura and rice (steamed, fried or brown).  I like Hot&amp;Sour soup, but we found out that as it is made to order it&apos;s only available as a large bowl (4 person serving size) except Fridays and Saturdays. The Egg Flower soup was very good.  As were the egg roll and the shrimp tempura.  I had them with the sweet and sour sauce which was not the usual cloying sweet sauce, but more grapefruit citrusy and delicious.

I&apos;d never had Lo Mein before and wasn&apos;t sure what to expect.  I loved it!  The noodles were cooked al dente, the beef was tender and well seasoned.  I&apos;ll definitely be ordering it again!  I gave my rice to my hubby who loves rice and I didn&apos;t need it.

The waitress was attentive, gave good advice...the food was delicious...and the atmosphere was inviting.  I&apos;m glad we tried Lotus Garden again.

I&apos;ve been eating off and on here since the month they opened their doors in the 1970s.  In the past, everything has usually been delicious and fresh with a balance of ingredients.

Since 2008, this has changed. The sauces, appetizers, and soups are still very tasty BUT it is no longer a joy to eat the food.   When you eat in the restaurant, the dishes, such as Almond Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken are about 75% water chestnuts, 15% meat and 10% vegetables.  When you take out the food, the dishes, such as Almond Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken, are now 90% water chestnut, 5% vegetable, and 5% meat. In other dishes, its the bamboo shoots that get the star treatment. They often forget to add the nuts and when you ask for a few on the side, just in case they forgot again, they want to charge you for them.

I love this adorable little place.  I believe it was the lemon chicken that knocked my socks.  Very nice servers, delicious food, very clean, and great prices.  Decor is a bit dates, perhaps from the late 80s, but it is still quite charming.  Interesting little wine and liquor shop as well.
Highly recommended!

What an enjoyable restaurant. The service is quick and attentive and the food has been delicious on two consecutive visits. We&apos;ve enjoyed the crab puffs, orange chicken and chicken fried rice. Will not hesitate to return and try more of the menu.

We like to eat here. The food is always very fresh. They bring you hot tea and fortune cookies as soon as you sit down. I like the cashew chicken best. They also bring you an almond cookie with the check. It&apos;s family owned and operated and the staff is always very pleasant and accommodating.

Their lo-mein was below average. More than ten bucks for such a small serving is a rip-off. The waitress I had was so whack. Wasn&apos;t a good experience at all. Their orange chicken was good though. That was the one dish that was up to par with my standards of chinese food. The Almond Chicken was so terrible. It was 75 percent vegatables and the rest chicken. Total rip-off. 40 bucks total for three dishes and it didn&apos;t even have a fair amount of meat in the dishes.

I can&apos;t believe I am the first to review this place. When you walk in you think you are in a high end liquor store but it is in fact a Chinese restaurant. We were a group of 6 and we were seated quickly which I liked. After that I can say that the service was good but I cannot say the same for the food. It was greasy, the sauces were brown and all tasted the same, except for that nasty fried orange chicken that my step mom likes, yuk! I ordered hot sour soup as always when trying to figure out if a Chinese place is worthy. It was not warm enough, so I presume it was microwaved. I think they also went overboard on the corn starch because it was a bit to thick which then gets into a texture issue and that makes me want to gag. I will not be back for the food but because it is close I may be in for a great bottle of booze if I need something fast and high end!

Seriously- this place is fantastic!!!!I&apos;ve been to many Chinese restaurants and usually they have the same menu, taste, look. This place has the best food by far. I have had many dishes off the menu and have not been disappointed once. The selection is great. Plenty to choose from. Anyone giving this place a bad review must have some screwed up taste buds.

Upon arrival, we were surprised to see all of the merchandise for sale right inside the door.  We were quickly seated in a booth and our waitress was very attentive from taking our drink order through the end of our meal.  The hot and sour soup was filled with tofu, mushrooms, etc, almost to the point of being like a chunky stew.  The Mongolian beef my husband ordered was not at all spicy like the menu said but it was still very tasty.  The shrimp lo mein we shared was good - not too greasy.  I ordered the vegetarian eggplant which was savory, but again not spicy like the menu noted.  Only other negative was the small portion of rice vs the large amount of entree provided.
