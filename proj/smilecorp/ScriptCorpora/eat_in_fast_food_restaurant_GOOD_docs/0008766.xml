 Background   
 Wal-Mart has proposed building a Supercenter on Baptist Road across from
 the existing King Soopers grocery store. The Wal-Mart would be open 24
 hours per day and include a grocery store, garden shop, tire-lube-tune-up
 express, and gas station. View a map of the
 vicinity . There is a Wal-Mart Supercenter in
 northern Colorado Springs near the Chapel Hills Mall approximately 10 minutes drive from the proposed
 location.  The original proposal was for a 184,403
 square foot (4.23 acre) structure with parking for 921 cars. The
 revised site plan submitted to the county showed 186,245 square foot store (4.28 acres) with parking for
 about 930 cars. The latest site plan is for a 203,091 square foot store (4.66 acres) with parking for more
 than 1,000 cars.  View the
 three Wal-Mart
 Site Plans . It would be helpful in evaluating this
 project if the Developer submitted a context plan showing nearby
 highways, wetlands, church, and houses. Some of this information is
 available but is scattered throughout the file. The structure would be placed on the
 northeastern part of the parcel. It would be about 24&apos; high. One
 plan being considered would be similar to the Wal-Mart in Castlerock.  More than 21 acres
 of the 30 acre parcel would be paved. The building occupies an
 additional 4.66 acres. All 25 acres of impervious area would produce
 run-off during storms. The parcel under consideration
 (assessor&apos;s schedule no. 7136002023) is owned
 by Uwe Schmidt (523 Mallard Point Circle, Mountain Home, AR 72653),
 Beverley Miller (P.O. Box 567, Palmer Lake, CO 80133), and Ken Barber
 (5160 N. Union Blvd., Colorado Springs, CO 80918).  The parcel is presently in El
 Paso County and was zoned in 1976 as R-4. At that time, it was
 declared to be intended for medium-density multi-family residences. Even
 if the
 commercial form of the now obsolete R-4 zone had been selected it would
 be approximately equivalent to the County&apos;s Planned Business Park (PBP)
 zone district. PBP
 is defined in the countys Land
 Development Code as being for retail sales and service
 businesses that primarily serve an adjoining neighborhood or
 neighborhoods. The most
 appropriate zone for a Supercenter Wal-Mart is Planned Business Center (PBC).
 PBC is two steps more intense and a significant departure from PBP.  According to the letter of intent,
 the property owners have applied for Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning.
 The county planning division encouraged the applicant to request PUD
 zoning because of the potential for greater control by the planning
 division over architectural and other elements of the design even though
 this is a significant departure from the intent of PUD zoning. The 47.81 acre parcel directly to the
 west of the proposed Wal-Mart parcel is now owned the Colorado
 Department of Transportation. It was formerly owned by Forest Lakes LLC (491
 Woodmen Rd., C.S. 80919). The assessor&apos;s schedule no. for that parcel is
 7135000003. Forest Lakes owns parcels west of I-25.  The proposal calls for water and sewer service to the
 development to be provided by the Triview
 Metropolitan
 District . Triview provides utilities to the Jackson Creek development. Many in the Town
 of Monument were under the impression that the Triview District would not supply services to the
 development unless the parcel was annexed to the Town. Goldberg
 Properties seemed to be under the same impression since they contacted the
 Donala District that serves Gleneagle. Due to the distances involved, it
 would have cost several million dollars to connect to the Donala system.
 There may also have been some difficulty in obtaining easements needed
 for the connections. Problems obtaining utility service seem to have
 held up the project for many months. After many months, the Triview District
 reappeared as the supplier. Their current position is that there was
 never any understanding with the Town and there is no reason they
 cannot supply service to the parcel. There would be three points of access to Wal-Mart. Two would be on a southern
 extension of Jackson Creek Parkway. The third would be a
 right-in/right-out directly onto
 Baptist Road toward the eastern end of the structure. They are
 shown on the Wal-Mart Site Plan .  At the western edge of the proposed
 development, Jackson Creek Parkway is already a
 full-motion intersection with a signal light. The plan includes one additional lot on
 the northwest corner for a gas station. Drainage from the development
 and adjacent Jackson Creek Parkway would be
 collected in a 1.7-acre snow storage and run-off detention area on the
 southeast corner. Passive systems
 are proposed to address water quality issues including contamination
 with petroleum products leaking from vehicles on the parking lot and at
 the gas station and
 carried into the detention area by storm water. The outflow from the detention area
 would flow west under Jackson Creek Parkway into a drainage ditch and from there into nearby Jackson Creek and
 the associated wetlands.  The Developer
 has included a
 buffer zone between the southern side of the store and the nearby
 residential parcels. Lighting would be provided using
 28&apos;
 light standards. The Developer claims these are the same as the light standards at King Soopers
 across Baptist Road.  The project would take about 8
 months to complete once the needed approvals have been obtained.  In the original proposal, the Town of Monument and the
 Triview metro district would have split (50/50) the local portion (3%) of the 7%
 sales tax
 collected on taxable items sold at the store. The Developer estimated
 that the local sales taxes collected by the project would be about $1.4
 million per year based on annual sales of about $45 million. Consequently,
 in the original proposal Triview Metro would have received
 about $750,000 per year. In the latest proposal, the Public
 Improvement Corporation (PIC) Triview authorized will collect 3% as a&quot;retail sales fee&quot;. The PIC will issue $3-4 million in bonds to pay for road
 improvements associated with the store. Until the bonds are repaid, the
 PIC will retain three-fourths of the retail sales fee and pay one-fouth
 to Triview. That means the 3% retail sales fee will be split with 3/4%
 going to Triview and 2.25% going to the pay off the PIC bonds. When the
 bonds are repaid, the retail sales fee will be reduced to 1.5% with all
 of it going to Triview.  
 
 
 History and Status 
 The proposal was initially submitted to the Town of Monument in 1999 as a
 request of annexation, rezoning, and site plan approval. Just prior to the Monument Planning
 Commission meeting March 27, 2000, the Developer, Goldberg Properties, elected to postpone
 consideration of their proposal. They were concerned about legal notification issues associated with the March 27th meeting. These issues
 were raised by the Coalition&apos;s letter delivered to Town Hall March
 23rd . At the open house presented by Goldberg
 Properties on April 20, 2000, the
 Coalition delivered to the Wal-Mart representative a cover
 letter and petitions with signatures of 573 residents opposed to the
 proposed Wal-Mart.  The parcel has not yet been annexed into
 the Town of Monument or rezoned. Due to the Moratorium enacted by the Monument Board of Trustees on April 17, 2000, consideration of the annexation, zoning
 (to C-1, highway commercial), and site plan was postponed until
 after July 17, 2000. The Wal-Mart proposal was approved by Monument Parks and Landscape
 Committee on May 24, 2000. The Wal-Mart proposal was reviewed at several meetings of the Monument Public Works Committee
 but a decision was postponed until some additional issues are
 resolved. Primary among the issues were questions about improvements to
 Baptist Road to be constructed prior to opening the store. In June or July 2000, the Wal-Mart developer requested that the project including
 annexation of the parcel into the Town of Monument be put on hold
 until further notice. March 30, 2001: The Gazette reported that
 Wal-Mart had decided to pursue County approval of its proposed supercenter on
 Baptist Rd. across from King Soopers. It has apparently abandoned its
 plan to have the Town of Monument annex the parcel. The
 Triview Metropolitan District that serves Jackson Creek would reportedly provide
 water and sewer service in exchange for 1.5% of sales at the store. Many
 in the Town
 of Monument were under the impression that the Triview District would not supply services to the
 development unless the parcel was annexed to the Town. Goldberg
 Properties seemed to be under the same impression since they contacted the
 Donala District that serves Gleneagle. Due to the distances involved, it
 would have cost several million dollars to connect to the Donala system.
 There may also have been some difficulty in obtaining easements needed
 for the connections. Problems obtaining utility service seem to have
 held up the project for many months. Recently, the Triview District
 reappeared as the supplier. Their current position is that there was
 never any understanding with the Town and there is no reason that they
 cannot supply service to the parcel.  May 19, 2001: The Coalition&apos;s Wal-Mart Committee held a Community
 Meeting on Wal-Mart . You can view
 the presentation on-line or download
 it for off-line viewing and printing . A pre-application conference between Goldberg Properties and Carl
 Schueler, Assistant Director of the El Paso County Planning Department
 was held April 23, 2001. View the notes
 from that conference . A representative of the Triview Metro District was present but a request by the Town of Monument to attend was denied.
 At the Triview Metro District Board meeting April 26th, it was reported
 that Goldberg said they spent two years trying to satisfy the
 requirements of the Town of Monument and finally gave up.  September 27, 2001: At the Triview Metro District Board meeting the
 following points were made about the Wal-Mart situation: 
 The District will prepare the water
 resource engineering report needed for Wal-Mart&apos;s County application even
 though Goldberg Properties, the Wal-Mart developer, has refused
 to pay the estimated $15,000 fee up front. A letter of intent
 from Goldberg was expected that day. In the event the project is
 not approved by the County, the District and its rate payers in
 Jackson Creek may have to absorb the cost of the study. The
 study will take 4 to 6 weeks to complete. That means the project
 could appear before the County Planning Commission December 19th and
 the Board of County Commissioners in January 2002. Goldberg has completed negotiations with the landowner.
 Several other potential sites have been discussed with Goldberg but they
 remain committed to using the parcel across from King Soopers
 because of its visibility from I-25 and proximity to the proposed
 Jackson Creek Parkway, planned to be a major north-south
 arterial. Someone from the Town of Monument approached Goldberg
 regarding renewing its suspended application and was rebuffed.
 Goldberg says it plans to pursue an application with the County. The District&apos;s Attorney, Peter Susemihl, will be working with
 Goldberg to refine the an agreement for a Public Improvement
 Corporation (PIC) to use a 1.5% retail sales fee from the store
 to build infrastructure improvements. 
 November 6, 2001: At the Coalition&apos;s Wal-Mart Committee meeting, it
 was learned that Pinetree, owners of some parcels in the Regency
 Park/Jackson Creek development have reportedly approached Wal-Mart
 headquarters in Arkansas with a proposal for a Wal-Mart store south of
 Highway 105 and east of I-25. August 28, 2002: Triview
 board authorized Wal-Mart PIC . September 21, 2002: Goldberg Property Associates submitted the first
 elements of their application to El Paso County Planning Department. October 8, 2002: Goldberg submitted the remaining elements of their
 application. February 21, 2003: Wal-Mart
 plans include taxpayer-funded $1 million bridge April 7, 2003: Revised
 Wal-Mart traffic report submitted May 28, 2003: Triview

 Issues Click
 here for a summary of major issues 
 Traffic Volume (Based on the traffic study submitted to the Town of Monument with the
 initial application. A revised traffic study is being prepared at the
 request of the county planning department.) 
 The Developer&apos;s traffic study shows that the
 Wal-Mart retail
 center including lots 2 and 3 would generate a total of about 11,936 vehicle trips per day. The traffic study estimates that 34% of these trips
 would be
 by passers-by, that is, by people who are on their way to another
 destination via Baptist. An experienced traffic engineer we consulted
 feels that since Wal-Mart is considered a&quot;destination
 store&quot;, 20 to 25% is a more realistic factor.  Another questionable assumption is
 that the satellite businesses would be&quot;general retail.&quot;It
 is far more likely that the businesses that lease lots 2 and 3 would
 be a fast food restaurant, convenience store, drive-through bank or gas
 station. This
 more realistic assumption would generate two to four times the
 traffic assumed in the Developer&apos;s traffic study. Using the conservative 25% passer-by
 figure (rather than the unrealistic 34%) and doubling the assumed
 trips generated by lots 2 and 3, the projection for the
 proposed Wal-Mart is 10,968 new trips per day not 7,598 as
 shown in the latest traffic study. View
 the details of this calculation of Wal-Mart Trips . For comparison, the traffic study
 shows 9,500 trips per day as the current load on Baptist Road. If
 this Wal-Mart proposal is approved, traffic would more than double
 to over 20,000 trips per day. Baptist is currently one lane in each direction. The
 Baptist Road Rural Transit Authority (RTA) has a long term
 plan for Baptist that calls for it to be expanded to six lanes
 (three in each direction) with a median from Old Denver Highway on
 the west to Jackson Creek Parkway on the east. Baptist would be four
 lanes (two in each direction) with a median from Jackson Creek
 Parkway east to Fox Run. There is no money yet allocated for these
 changes. Best estimates are that these changes will not be
 implemented for four years or more. View
 the plan for long-term access to the proposed Wal-Mart.  View the
 plan for access to the church and other properties to the east
 of the store. Goldberg Properties has stated that
 one main purpose for collecting the&quot;retail sales fee&quot;for
 Triview Metro
 District is to support $3-5 million in bonds to pay for improvements to
 Baptist Road. 
 Traffic Safety 
 In addition to the increased volume
 of traffic attributed to the proposed Wal-Mart, some of the layout
 of the proposed changes to Baptist to accommodate the development
 raise other safety concerns. For example, a 175&apos; right turn lane
 is proposed from eastbound Baptist to southbound Jackson Creek
 Parkway. The CDOT guideline for such a turn lane on a level 35 mph
 road would be 310&apos;. In this case, at some points, there is as much
 as a 9.5% down slope. That
 is far greater than the maximum 5% to 6% down slope recommended by
 El Paso County for major and minor arterials. Even if the grade were
 reduced to the 5% to 7% range, the guidelines recommend the turn lane
 be extended 35%
 to 418&apos;. The 175&apos; lane in the proposal is considerably less than
 half of the 418&apos; that safety would dictate. This would lead to congestion and
 create a hazard with vehicles slowing in the main
 traffic lane prior to entering the severely shortened right-turn lane. In
 adverse weather, vehicles that don&apos;t slow before entering the lane would have difficulty stopping before entering the intersection. The site plan shows no pedestrian
 access either from the parking lot to the building or more
 importantly, along Baptist road. A concrete pedestrian/bicycle path
 along Baptist road should be provided for access to the more than
 2000 houses in the area. Wal-Mart parking lots were listed as three of the top seven
 highest accident prone street blocks according the Gazette &apos;s list
 of top accident locations in Colorado Springs for 1999 . 
 Impact
 on the Environment 
 The outflow from the detention area would concentrate flows from
 the entire 25 impervious acres into a fairly small area. This invites
 erosion, destruction of sensitive habitat, and pollution of ground
 water, nearby domestic wells, and the Jackson Creek wetlands. View
 pictures of King Soopers outflow for an idea of the potential
 impact of the much larger Wal-Mart store. Wetlands protection from storm water runoff is the responsibility of the Colorado
 Department of Public Health and Environment and the U.S.
 Army Corps of Engineers .  Much of the Jackson Creek area is potential
 or
 known habitat for the endangered Preble&apos;s Jumping
 Meadow Mouse. The proposed Wal-Mart would probably have a serious detrimental
 effect on the mouse habitat and population in the area.  For details
 on Government policy and regulations, consult the U.S.
 Fish and Wildlife Service&apos;s Information on the Preble&apos;s Mouse and the
 endangered species program . Read Wal-Mart&apos;s Mouse Habitat Report , the
 resulting letter from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , Rich McDonald&apos;s
 questions to Goldberg Properties , and Rich McDonald&apos;s April 2001
 Letter to the County regarding Wal-Mart&apos;s lack of response . Read
 a recent local story about a tax and development restrictions to
 help protect the Preble&apos;s mouse .  Read a
 status report on the mouse habitat conservation plan being developed
 by El Paso County . Methyl tertiary butyl ether ( MTBE ) is used as a
 gasoline additive to increase octane ratings in premium grade fuels
 and to enhance gasoline combustion and reduce tailpipe emissions.  
 Even though MTBE is generally not added to gasoline in
 Colorado, fuel from other states such as California that still
 allow use of MTBE could be brought here by visitors to the
 state.  MTBE
 from gasoline that leaks from vehicles on the Wal-Mart parking lot
 would be washed off by storm water and could contaminate the
 surrounding environment and groundwater. The U.S. Geologic Survey
 home page on MTBE reports that&quot;Potential and documented
 contamination of water resources by MTBE has become a cause for
 major public concern and increasing controversy. MTBE readily
 dissolves in water, can move rapidly through soils and aquifers, is
 resistant to microbial decomposition and is difficult to remove in
 water treatment. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has
 classified MTBE as a potential
 human carcinogen . Finally, MTBE can give water an unpleasant
 taste and odor. These factors have caused widespread concern that
 drinking water supplies and human health may be at risk.&quot;  Most
 states including Colorado have some MTBE contamination .  The Environmental Protection Agency has a many
 web sites with a variety of information on MTBE . 
 Parking lot lighting would undoubtedly
 produce glare and increase the general level of light pollution in
 the area. As those interested in astronomy say&quot;turn on a light
 and turn off a star.&quot;For more on the growing issue of light
 pollution, visit
 astronomy.com . Read a story about
 noise complaints from residents near a Massachusetts Wal-Mart . The greatly increased volume of
 traffic on Baptist Road would bring greater noise. During peak travel
 times, a background roar from Baptist is already evident in many
 parts of the Jackson Creek development. This would become far worse. The proposed traffic volume on
 Baptist also raises concerns about health risks to nearby
 residents. A
 recent study relates traffic and cancer rates in children. Another
 report shows connections between high traffic rates and
 allergies and asthma. 
 Impact on
 Local Businesses 
 Monument has been working hard to
 attract small business to the historic downtown area. Bringing a
 large discount store to the Baptist Road area would divert commercial
 focus from the downtown area and would likely destroy many of the
 small businesses local residents have worked so hard to build. Construction of Wal-Mart Supercenter&apos;s has devastated many other small towns across America.
 That is not what most of us were hoping for in the Tri-Lakes
 area. Some related Eastern Michigan University articles: &quot;Impact
 of Wal-Mart on Downtowns&quot; , &quot;Impact
 of Wal-Mart on Michigan Downtowns&quot; , and &quot;Successful
 Retail&quot; .  
 Crime   
 As reported in the December 30, 1999
 issue of the Colorado Springs Gazette , during the 32 days
 from November 28, 1999 through December 29, 1999, Police were called
 86 times to come to the Wal-Mart store at Platte Avenue and Chelton
 Road. That is an average of 2.7 calls per day. Of those 86 calls, 22 were for
 shoplifting the rest were about suspicious persons, medical
 emergencies, traffic accidents, and domestic disturbances. View
 the Gazette&apos;s December 30, 1999 stories about shoplifting at Wal-Mart . View
 a February 8, 2000 Gazette Story about Shooting Deaths at the Castle
 Rock Wal-Mart View
 a Gazette story about a shoplifting incident at the Pueblo, Colorado
 Wal-Mart . 
 Taxes 
 Increased sales tax revenue to the
 Town of Monument was expected to come from having a Supercenter Wal-Mart
 within the Town. However, since Goldberg Properties is now pursuing
 approval in the County, the Town of Monument would not receive any
 sales tax revenue from the store. The Triview Metropolitan District would reportedly receive 1.5% or 3% as a&quot;retail sales
 fee&quot;. Some of that might be earmarked
 for Baptist Road improvements.  The Developer estimates initial annual sales
 at about $45 million. Consequently, Triview (and/or the Public
 Improvement Corporation it creates) may receive 3% (about
 $1.4 million) as a&quot;retail sales fee&quot;. The Town of Monument would likely
 lose a significant amount of sales tax revenue due to loss of sales at King Soopers, Brookharts, and
 the various other businesses within the town. County property taxes for the parcel would increase if
 Wal-Mart is built.
 Since the proposal is expected to be submitted to the County, the
 Town of Monument would not receive any of the additional property taxes. Property taxes for Monument business
 that fail due to Wal-Mart&apos;s presence would decrease.  The Orange County Business
 Council in California commissioned a study
 of the impact of big box stores . The study concludes that the
 fiscal benefits of supercenters, and of discount retail more
 generally, are much more complex, and often lower, than they first
 appear. 
 Employment 
 The proposed Wal-Mart would employ
 about 400 people. The average pay would be about $8.50 per hour.
 That is significantly below the average at King Soopers and other
 stores in the area. Due to the low pay, it is expected that most of
 these employees would commute from areas where the cost of housing is
 less than it is in the Tri-Lakes area. Employees of the proposed Wal-Mart
 would likely do the
 bulk of their spending in the areas where they live. View
 a story about how Wal-Mart is anti-union .  Read June
 22, 2000 Denver Post on Federal jury award of $500K to ten former Loveland
 Wal-Mart employees in discrimination lawsuit. 
 Appearance 
 It is common practice at many Wal-Mart
 stores to leave surplus equipment and trash behind the store. This
 is what the Chaparral Hills neighbors will face every day.  View
 pictures of the back side of local Wal-Mart stores . The landscape plan provides a bare
 minimum of plantings and open space. The shortest parking bay is
 over 20 cars (210&apos;) without benefit of an island or planting area.
 By comparison, King Soopers parking bays are a maximum of 9 cars
 long with plantings at either end. The landscape area calculations shown
 on the first sheet of the submittal package state that 285,000
 square feet or 31% or the total area is dedicated to landscape area.
 Yet the actual area on the plans appears to be 180,000 square feet
 or 19% of the total area. The area with landscape materials shown in
 the Baptist Road right-of-way should not be included in the
 calculations since near-term widening of Baptist road is needed. The landscape materials shown in the
 proposed right-of-way along the southern side of the parcel should
 also not be included in the landscape area calculation. That
 right-of-way will be needed near-term when the existing church and
 two houses lose the direct access to Baptist Road they are currently
 using. As a major arterial, that direct access to Baptist Road will
 no longer be permitted.  Considering the extent of the paved
 area, the density of plant materials is insufficient. The proposed
 spacing for shrubs and the specified sizes for materials would not
 meet the criteria for most other municipalities. For example, the
 buffer zone along the south side of the project added in response to
 complaints from Chaparral Hills residents shows twelve 5&apos; trees in
 an area of 60,000 square feet. That averages one tree per 5,000
 square feet which is grossly inadequate to provide any significant
 improvement in appearance or noise control.

 the Wal-Mart Proposal posted on the
 KOAA web site . April 17, 2001: The High County News ran
 an article on vacant superstores . Some highlights: 
 Aurora, one of five Colorado communities with abandoned Wal-Marts,
 has two, each more than 100,000 sq. ft. &quot;Nationwide, fully half a billion square feet of retail space
 sits empty - the equivalent of about 4,000 shopping malls.&quot; &quot;Wal-Mart is one of the worst offenders. Nearly 400 of its
 stores, many built less than a decade ago, now sit empty. That&apos;s
 more than 30 million square feet of vacant retail space surrounded
 by thousands of acres of asphalt -- the refuse of just one
 corporation. Wal-Mart plans to&quot;relocate&quot;another hundred
 stores this year as it creates&quot;supercenters&quot;that combine
 general merchandise and a supermarket under one giant roof.&quot; &quot;Rather than becoming victims of the corporate
 cannibalization game, many cities and towns are taking a different
 approach. Some have barred construction of new big box stores and
 zoned new commercial growth into existing developed areas. Others
 have shifted tax dollars that have long subsidized new roads and
 sewers for sprawling developments into projects that strengthen
 downtown businesses.&quot; 
 October 13, 2000: An
 article in The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that the Ft.
 Wright, Ohio city council rejected a proposed Wal-Mart Supercenter
 based on concerns about traffic. June 23, 2000: A Denver
 Post article reported that residents in Aurora filed a lawsuit
 to block development by Goldberg Properties of the approved Wal-Mart Supercenter, Home Depot, etc. May 17, 2000: A Denver
 Post article reported that the Aurora, Colorado Wal-Mart was
 approved after concessions
 by Goldberg. Concessions include prohibiting late-night deliveries,
 installing a sound wall between existing homes and the store, and using
 garages instead of outdoor loading docks. March 22, 2000: Wal-Mart uses satellites to monitor competitors and neighborhoods July 1, 1999: Wal-Mart
