		Akbar Restaurant Old Town Pasadena 
 If you want really good Indian food, and don&apos;t mind bad service, I would suggest dining at the Akbar Indian Cuisine restaurant in Old Town Pasadena. A few days ago I wanted to try something new, and my girlfriend suggested Indian food. So I did some research. The Akbar Indian Cuisine restaurant in Pasadena seemed to have good reviews and decent prices. So dining at Akbar it would be.


 As we went inside the restaurant and approached the host, I noticed the place looked really nice, but the host seemed cold and stern. Definitely not warm and welcoming like you would expect the host of a restaurant to be. Oh well, he showed us to our table and I began to look over the menu. When the waitress came around to take our order I began to wonder if I was on a hidden camera T.V. show, the waitress also had somewhat of a cold demeanor. I felt like I was a bothering her by sitting there and ordering food. She wasn&apos;t the friendliest waitress I&apos;ve ever come across but at least she got the order correct.

 Vince&apos;s Deli Restaurant in Pasadena 
 The other day I was in the mood for a good sandwich. In Pasadena there are several restaurants for dining if you&apos;re in the mood for a sandwich. On this particular day, I remembered a restaurant that I had eaten previously that had great sandwiches. That place was Vince&apos;s Deli near Huntington Memorial Hospital and few minutes south of Old Town Pasadena. So off to Vince&apos;s Deli I went.



Vince&apos;s Deli is easy to miss. You can definitely consider the restaurant a hidden gem when it comes to dining in Pasadena. It&apos;s easy to miss it if you&apos;r not looking for it. The restaurant is located in a shopping center across the street from Huntington Hospital.

As I walked in the restaurant I noticed they had avocado specials. I love avocado&apos;s, so I ordered the avocado and roast beef. I was extremely hungry and I remembered the sandwiches being somewhat small, so I ordered a chicken salad as well.

 Healthy Restaurant Dining at Cabrera&apos;s in Pasadena 
 Last week I was on a fitness plan known as the Fat X Program . The plan requires healthy eating for 12 days. On the fourth day, I decided to eat out somewhere in Pasadena. I choose to dine at Cabrera&apos;s Mexican Restaurant.



I thought that healthy dining at Cabrera&apos;s Mexican Restaurant would be difficult, but as I looked through the menu I saw a special on a red snapper (fish) plate. I asked the friendly waitress if I could replace the rice with more veggies and she said it was&quot;no problem&quot;.

 As my girlfriend and I waited for our dinner, I noticed that there were many upgrades to the interior of the restaurant since I had last been at Cabrera&apos;s. The ceiling was newly painted and there was what seemed to be a wine bar being installed.

When the extremely friendly waitress brought our meals out, I was happy to see that the vegetables actually looked pretty tasty. The red snapper was also nicely grilled. The taste was very good and I would definitely recommend it if you&apos;re looking for a healthy alternative to a classic Mexican food type dinner.

 Grand Chicken Mediterranean Restaurant in Pasadena 
 Last week, during the hussle and bussle of Christmas shopping in rainy weather, I got a chance to eat at a Mediterranean restaurant in Pasadena named Grand Chicken.  It just happened that I had a flyer for that place in my car, and since my girlfriend and I were out and about Christmas shopping, the flyer for Grand Chicken sitting in my car while we drove around, made the food look more and more tempting. The fact they had some great lunch specials at the Grand Chicken restaurant made it even more tempting. It was time to try dining at Grand Chicken!



 When we got to the restaurant I ordered one of their lunch specials. It was the beef fillet and it was only $5.99. For that price I really wasn&apos;t expecting much, but at this point I was starving and just wanted to eat something and not spend too much on it. The wait was about 10 minutes and when I went to pick up the order, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food looked. When I sat down to eat, I was even more surprised at how good the food was.

I found it odd that this restaurant looked a bit empty inside. I really hope it stays in business because there&apos;s not to many places in Pasadena where you can get good Mediterranean food as such and affordable price.

 Sizzler Restaurant Pasadena Going Out of Business? 
 Last Monday my sister organized a family birthday dinner for our dad. When she text messaged me that it would be at the Sizzler restaurant in Pasadena, I wasn&apos;t exactly thrilled. I hadn&apos;t been to Sizzler in a long time and hoped it was better than the last time I dined at that restaurant.



When lined up to order, I was actually pleasantly surprised at the great looking pictures of the food on the restaurant wall. I ordered a steak and the salad bar. When I went to the salad bar and looked at my favorite salad item, cucumber, I was almost in shock at how nasty they looked. Really Sizzler? How hard is it to cut up fresh cucumbers?

 After getting through the salad and waiting for my steak, I starting noticing the decor in the place. It looked a bit old and tattered. My niece said&quot;this place reminds me of those abandoned places in movies&quot;. Some of the wall hangings were lop sided, there was a torn chair, and the rug looked dirty. The Sizzler restaurant in Pasadena really needs to step up their game.

 Sushi Restaurant in Pasadena 
 The other night, my girlfriend and I went on a double date with friends of ours. We were in the mood for dining on sushi and we set off on a mission to look for a good sushi restaurant in Pasadena. Our search lead us to a new place on the east end of Pasadena, Oishii Thai.



They started dinner with a soup and salad. What I liked about Oishii Thai restaurant was that they gave a choice of spicy-ness. You get to choose a spicy-ness level from 1-10 on spicy food items. That&apos;s a nice twist that I haven&apos;t come across. According to my friend, 7 was pretty damn spicy, so be careful.
 
While my girlfriend was set on sushi, I was in the mood for something a little more hearty, so I ordered a beef and noodle plate (I can&apos;t remember the name). It wasn&apos;t the greatest I&apos;ve ever had, but it was decent. There wasn&apos;t anything memorable about it.

 Dominico&apos;s Restaurant Pasadena 
 Are you looking for a great Italian restaurant in Pasadena? If so, then Dominico&apos;s is where you should be dining. Yesterday, after visiting a good friend in the area, my girlfriend and I decided to drop by for a late lunch, early dinner at this restaurant.



On the recommendation of our friend, we started the meal off with the antipasto salad. It was delicious and I can definitely give a thumbs up to that recommendation. We ordered the medium size which was more than enough for the both of us.

 We followed up the antipasto salad with a pepperoni and Canadian bacon small pizza. After the salad, my expectations were probably a bit high. The pizza was OK, but again, I probably expected too much. Even so, I did eat about three slices.

 Dining Fast and Healthy at a Pasadena Restaurant in Pasadena 
 Fast food restaurant dining doesn&apos;t have to mean unhealthy dining. Last night after a workout, and finishing up a fitness boot camp that I run, I needed to get something to eat on the go. While I needed to get something fast, I also wanted it to be relatively healthy. I decided to head over to the Lucky Boy restaurant in Pasadena. 
 
 
 
 While Lucky Boy in Pasadena is mostly known as a burger joint, they actually do have some healthy items on the menu. I know they have a good looking tuna salad, but last night I wasn&apos;t in the mood to experiment and wanted something that I&apos;ve enjoyed in the past . So, I went with their chicken salad.  
 
 
 As in the past with their chicken salad, it didn&apos;t disappoint. They grill the chicken in thin slices which give it a really nice flavor. They lay that on top of fresh salad with big chunks of tomato and cucumbers that make the meal come together really well. I sold my girlfriend on ordering it as it was her first time to Lucky Boy and she was pretty impressed with it.

 Dining at Tony&apos;s Restaurant For a Pasadena Breakfast 
 The other day I wrote about a hidden gem in Pasadena when it comes to restaurants. At Gerlach&apos;s Grill you can get a nice lunch, but what about breakfast restaurant? If you&apos;re looking for another hidden gem in Pasadena to dine in, Tony&apos;s Restaurant definitely fits the bill. My girlfriend and I decided to stop by for breakfast. I must admit, I&apos;ve had lunch at Tony&apos;s before, but eating breakfast there was going to be new for me. 
 
 I ordered the breakfast burrito and a side of french toast. All I can say is that I was either really hungry, or that french toast was awesome for a restaurant that doesn&apos;t boast about their breakfast. I ran through the french so quickly that by the time I got to the breakfast burrito I was almost full. Luckily, I was only almost full, so I was able to get to, and through some of the burrito. It didn&apos;t disappoint and it&apos;s definitely a full breakfast in itself. I actually saved half of it and ate it the next day. Still tasted very good even after the reheating.

 Dining at Gerlach&apos;s In Pasadena 
 A hidden gem in Pasadena when it comes to restaurants is Gerlach&apos;s Grill. Some people refer to this type of place as a&quot;hole in the wall&quot;. It&apos;s adjacent to the liquor store, it&apos;s not very pretty and it&apos;s kinda hidden, but the food there is awesome! They call it a Mexican, Middle Eastern fusion. Whatever it is, if you&apos;re in the mood for sea food and you&apos;re not too worried about dining inside of a nice cozy restaurant, then Gerlach&apos;s is the place.



 I invited a friend for lunch and I had to introduce her to the Grilled Salmon Salad. While they have a variety of other fish, and some great fish tacos, the Grilled Salmon Salad is the way to go. Not only does it taste great, but it&apos;s also very healthy.

The restaurant, like I said is a hidden gem and it&apos;s never very busy, so you can get a great meal without a very long wait. The prices are also very reasonable. The salmon salad is under $10 and the taste is comparable to meals at a more expensive, dine in restaurant.

 Pastrami at The Hat in Pasadena 
 If you&apos;re in the mood for pastrami, The Hat in Pasadena has the best for a fast food restaurant. I&apos;ve lived in Pasadena for 32 years, and The Hat has been on the corner of Villa Street and Lake Avenue since I can remember, yet I had never been to this restaurant. Today changed all that.

A friend of mine invited me for lunch and The Hat was the destination. I was looking forward to tasting what The Hat claims to be world famous pastrami. I&apos;ve driven by the restaurant plenty of times, but like I said before, I had never been. The outside of the restaurant is very distinct, yet the inside simply basic and looked like what you would expect a fast food joint to look like, bland.

While the inside of the restaurant was bland and basic, the pastrami dip definitely was above and beyond bland. The pastrami was great and had a fresh, meaty, succulent taste. The french fries not so much and it would have probably been a good idea to get the chili fries, but that will wait for next time.
 
The prices are really good, three of us ate and the total was $24 dollars and change. We each had the pastrami dip (dip on the side), a drink, and we shared the a large order of fries which was plenty.

The Hat is located at 491 N. Lake Ave, on the corner of Lake Ave and Villa St. You can call in orders to go at 626-449-1844. If you&apos;re in Pasadena and in the mood for pastrami, this restaurant is a good choice.
