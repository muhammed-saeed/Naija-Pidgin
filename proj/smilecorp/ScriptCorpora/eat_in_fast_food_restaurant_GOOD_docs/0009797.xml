 Saturday, May 5th, 2012 9:42 am Brian&apos;s Semi-Annual Update 
 It&apos;s been over two months since my last update. I gotta tell you, although clearly stuff has happened, there hasn&apos;t been anything really amazing. My passion for writing 5,000 word entries about an epic trip to Foxwoods or recommanding some amazing 4-star movie that no one will actually see has fallen on away. Twitter has made my life simpler. Everything in 140 characters about what&apos;s new, or a stupid thought in my head. It also allows me to follow comedians, writers, and fictional characters (Like Ron Swanson or Homer Simpson) to give me laughs during the day at my boring job. Before i drop off the deep end of petty crap, let me give a quick, not timewise correct listing of events that have occured since my last entry:

--My Oscars guesses were pretty close, only got 3 things wrong.
--The parents have returned back from Florida. I know because i helped unload their car.
--Mike didn&apos;t come because he has hernia issues. Yesterday he successfully had hernia surgery.
--Have gone to the movies maybe 3 times. Saw the best foreign film, &quot;A Seperation&quot;, it was great.
--My car has gone beyond 200,000 miles. It has also passed state inspection for another year.
--I learned that in the future, never go to Sears to have them fix your car.
--I learned my mom is a good go-between as she finally got my money from John for last football season.
--The Bruins are out of the playoffs and everyone got racist about it. But i&apos;m cool, they still won the cup last year.
--I continue to go to Foxwoods and sometimes win or lose money, as long as i can see a good comedian and stay overnight for free.
--In fact, June 1st and 2nd, staying two nights and seeing comedians Rob Riggle and Jim Gaffigan.
--Paul and Christie will stay with me that first night. Mike might come the second night.
--Living with Mike is a very mixed. It doesn&apos;t suck, but there is no positive energy anywhere.
--By far, the greatest comedy on television is &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. Ron Swanson, greatest man ever.
--By far, the greatest drama on television is &quot;Mad Men&quot;. Can&apos;t wait to see how it will all plan out in the 60&apos;s.
--I&apos;ve really stopped giving a shit about politics. Not that i ever was full on hardcore. Still just a Libertarian that would probably vote for Romney even though Obama will probably win.
--I do use my cellphone to call and text. However, of the original 1,000 minutes i was given a year ago, i have 120 left.
--The Red Sox really suck, but that&apos;s because half the starters are injured. Still, a long season to go.
--Foxwoods gives me free stuff to keep coming back, and i&apos;m going to talk about my free cruise pretty soon in detail.
--Work is still work, although my boss is leaving. Without him around, things have been going smoothly.
--Although, it&apos;s getting harder and harder to listen to my podcasts because Pepsi never updates their flash player.
--My prospeed email got hacked into a month ago. That sucked. So now i have a much more complex password. Guess it correctly, and you can hack into my email account again.
--Paul hosted a UFC fight night at his place. It was going to be at a movie theater, but tickets were sold out. But better food, access to a keg, and the chance to gamble made it much better.
--I really do love my Netflix account and Amazon Instant account. I should never be bored with these backup plans of entertainment around.
--Mom has crazy white hair. Hopefully she goes back to dying it. Dad still can&apos;t remember what channel NESN is on his DirecTV.
--I used a beebee gun for the first time ever, and i&apos;m a pretty good shot at soda cans.
--Still reading books in the bathroom, and still hate going to Barnes and Noble. In the future, NEVER GIVE ME A GIFT CARD TO BARNES&amp;NOBLE! Just give me a gift card to Amazon.com and i&apos;ll figure something out.
--Poker League started up again. Finally got into a final table for the first time in over a year.
--I have no clue why i watch reruns of &quot;Storage Wars&quot; and &quot;Auction Hunters&quot;, but i do. A lot.
--My PS3 is the greatest multimedia device in the world, and i don&apos;t think i&apos;ve played video games on it since 2010.
--I&apos;m techincally on Facebook, but i never use it. So, that&apos;s why i don&apos;t friend you or write back. I just get an email from family or someone from high school that found me on Facebook, and i delete.
--I truly believe depression hit several times since i&apos;ve moved in with Mike. Not that anything new has happened, but i do experience a lot less &quot;really dark days&quot;.
--Goddamn i love comedy. In the past, i&apos;ve seen Louis C.K., Jim Jeffries, Bill Burr, Patrice O&apos;Neil, and others. Way better than going to a concert or seeing a movie.
--I&apos;m sorry i don&apos;t update as often as i used to.

Those are all the quick things that have more or less happened. Now onto one final thing, and that&apos;s the &quot;Free&quot; cruise i got from Foxwoods.

Because of my level of play, Foxwoods gives me free stuff. Now, they do the same for Mike, but his stuff is like 10 player points. Me, i get $50 in slot play, and two free nights at the hotel every week. Complinmentary tickets to see musical events, like Paul Anka or Gladys Knight. There is other free crap they give me, but i really only use these free things if i can see a good enough comedian and also line it up with an overnight stay. Well, one day, a postcard comes in from Foxwoods, and it&apos;s for a free cruise. All i have to do is show up on Friday night, between 6-9, and get my free cruise. Now, because 1,000 other people like me got this, all 1,000 people went to Foxwoods that night. They also took up all the free rooms Foxwoods gives you, so i couldn&apos;t do an overnight stay. But there was a comedian there, Natasha Leggero, she is funny enough, and it was double bonus slot play (instead of my weekly $30, they gave me an additional $30 for that specific Friday) so it was worth my time to get a free cruise and see if it was worth it.

I go straight to my rewards center and get my slot play bonus stuff (last time i went, i got my rewards through the actual slot machine, and it screwed me over. This time i went to the kiosk they have and that&apos;s how i&apos;ll get all my rewards in the future.) and now i have $60 to play in slot machines. Then i move straight to the free cruise line, and the line is huge. I figure, go kill some time playing at a slot machine with my free money and they come back. Well, it doesn&apos;t take me longer than 3 minutes to hit a Wheel of Fortune slot machine for $800. That was awesome, so i cashed out, and decided to kill time in the free cruise line, and then see a comedian. No reason to lose any money when i&apos;m up so much so soon.

I get back into the line, but now it&apos;s doubled. I&apos;ve never seen a line at Foxwoods go from the ballroom to beyond Fuddruckers. But, no biggie, and i hop in the back of the line. The line moves pretty good, and a half hour later, i&apos;m finally getting a folder with a brochure and a certificate for my free cruise. Here is the deal:

-I must book within three months.
-I must set sail within one year.
-This is free for the person on the certificate and one guest.
-This covers he cost of the cruise, room, meals, and entertainment.
-It&apos;s a 7-day cruise going to wherever depending on the port i leave from.
-Does not cover things like port fees, taxes, alcohol, or passports.

When i was in line at Foxwoods, there was a movie screen showing the different places you can go depending on where you leave from. So i&apos;m thinkin i must leave from either New York, Miami, Tampa Bay, or New Orleans, because those are the only ports they show in the movie. I go through my brochure, and there&apos;s a 7-day cruise from Boston to Bermuda in there. The boat leaves (oh, this is through Norweigan Cruse Line, check them out at http://www.ncl.com if you want to see more info on this) on a Friday afternoon, arrives in Bermuda Sunday morning, and leaves on a Tuesday night, to arrive back in Boston of Friday morning. But, the schedule only does this from May-September, and then again in 2013 for May-September. But next year would be over the guidelines for must set sail within one year. So now i only have May-September to look at. But no one wants to go in the middle of summer to Bermuda. And due to work, i can only leave during the time of the month that doesn&apos;t interfer with Period Close. So basically, the last possible cruise, leaving on Friday, September 14th, is the most likely one. However, that may or may not coincide with Hurrican season. I&apos;ll have to rethink some more and settle for a late August trip. Yeah, it might be too much summer, but i want to avoid a hurricane. I want to really see a tropical paradise atleast once in my life. I hate traveling, maybe this will give me something to look forward to.

With the free cruise, i&apos;ve decided this, and these people know it. My guest will be my best friend Emmy, because we literally haven&apos;t seen each other since the Patriots won their first Super Bowl, back in February 2002. It&apos;s been over ten years. We should see each other. Now, i know it might be difficult for him to come on over. He lives about 8 hours away and i&apos;ve decided that the cheapest option for me is to leave through Boston Harbor. Someone who reads this, don&apos;t be a dick, help drive us to and a week later pick us up at Boston Harbor. I&apos;ll pay for your gas money. Thanks.

Emmy is the first choice. But he might not go because of money issues, or if he can&apos;t get the time off from work (he has a new job, not sure what his vacation time in like), or if this might piss off his girlfriend. Of course, the other option is his girlfriend comes with us, she buy&apos;s her own cabin, and we switch so i get the single cabin and they can be together. Then again, international waters, we might do some weird shit no one can even morally think of. Still, the option is on Emmy, and he has plenty of time to think it over. If he says no, and it&apos;s no big deal if he does, the option goes to my brother Mike. He is willing to pay for some of my drinks, and port fees and things like that, also give me a discount on that month&apos;s rent. But if for whatever reason mike can&apos;t do it, i go alone. Sounds pathetic, but i&apos;m a loner in the first place. I&apos;ll bring a bunch of books to read, have fun in the casino, enjoy being on a beach in Bermuda, and have a general good time. Of course, i can&apos;t wait to be sunburned, loss my money within 3 hours of the cruise taking off in the casino on the cruise, get robbed my street people in Bermuda, and be seasick all the way to and back on the cruise. With expectations like these, no wonder i hate the idea of travel. Either way, when i do come back, i&apos;ll write about it.

I know i&apos;ve promised before about updating more often on this site. Well, i&apos;m going to be realistic. I probably won&apos;t write for another month, until i write about how well Foxwoods was and the comedians i saw there. That&apos;s the only thing i can see on the horizon worth writing about. Now, if something major were to happen, like i get fired, or promoted, or get into a car accident, then yeah, i&apos;ll write about it. But there&apos;s not even a good movie on the horizon to write about. I might see &quot;The Avengers&quot;, a comic book movie, but even i don&apos;t want to read a review about it. This is my life, stuck in neutrul, hoping for something besides a flat road to the future.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

I think the cruise will be really good and something i&apos;m secretly excited about. It&apos;s also nice to have something planned for the future that i can look forward to doing. ( 1 Comment | Comment on this ) Friday, February 24th, 2012 8:49 pm My 7th Annual Oscars Picks and Wishes, 2012 edition for the 2011 movies 
 It will be this Sunday night that they will televise the Oscars. Once again, i did my job as a movie geek, and saw all 9 (NINE!) Best Picture nominees. Here&apos;s how it will go, i&apos;ll say an Oscar catergory, who&apos;s nominated, how many i saw, then, who i think SHOULD win, and who i think WILL win. This is just for fun, but next Monday, i can recap and see how good i really am.

Of the 24 different Oscar catergories, i only deal with the serious 8 catergories (4 acting, 2 writing, best director, best picture). Who cares about best sound mixing, or makeup, best costume, or best documentary--short subject? But i&apos;ll also throw in a couple guesses for fun. But i always keep the best picture pick and wish for the very end. So, lets knock this out.

Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role
Nominees:
Demián Bichir for A Better Life (2011)

George Clooney for The Descendants (2011)

Jean Dujardin for The Artist (2011)

Gary Oldman for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)

Brad Pitt for Moneyball (2011)

Only saw 3 of the 5 movies nominated. I have never heard of &quot;A Better Life&quot; and zero interest in &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;.

Should Win--Jean Dujardin for The Artist
Will Win--Jean Dujardin for The Artist
The first catergory out and this is a tough one. There wasn&apos;t any single lead acting performance that blew me away. So, might as well give it to the guy with basically no lines, but had to dance and show a full array of emotions without proper dialogue, so i&apos;m going with the silent, black and white movie &quot;The Artist&quot;

Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role
Nominees:
Glenn Close for Albert Nobbs (2011)

Viola Davis for The Help (2011)

Rooney Mara for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)

Meryl Streep for The Iron Lady (2011)

Michelle Williams for My Week with Marilyn (2011)

Saw 2 of the 5 (&quot;The Help&quot; and &quot;Tattoo&quot;)
Should Win--Rooney Mara for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
Will Win--Viola Davis for The Help
I will continue to proclaim that &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot; was the best movie of 2011 (and WAY better than the Swedish movie they made a couple of years ago) and it&apos;s all because of the lead actress. She got the real piercings, totally transformed herself, and dealt with a hell of a rape scene. But instead, the Academy will continue to not give Meryl Streep an Oscar and just give it to the black chick to make themselves fell as important just like all the nice white people in &quot;The Help&quot;

Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role
Nominees:
Kenneth Branagh for My Week with Marilyn (2011)

Jonah Hill for Moneyball (2011)

Nick Nolte for Warrior (2011)

Christopher Plummer for Beginners (2010)

Max von Sydow for Extremely Loud&amp;Incredibly Close (2011)

Saw 3 of the 5
Should Win--Nick Nolte for Warrior
Will Win--Christopher Plummer for Beginners
This is a total lock. Everyone says Plummer will win (he&apos;s playing a gay guy, the Oscars love that) and he&apos;ll become the oldest Oscar Winner Actor ever (Piss off Jessica Tandy) and that will be that. Ironically, even though i liked the acting in &quot;The Artist&quot;, i hope they don&apos;t give the Oscar to Max von Sydow for being a mute, and also being associated with such a shitty movie. 9/11 wasn&apos;t nearly as bad as watching &quot;Extremely Loud&amp;Incredibly Close&quot;

st Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role
Nominees:
Bérénice Bejo for The Artist (2011)

Jessica Chastain for The Help (2011)

Melissa McCarthy for Bridesmaids (2011)

Janet McTeer for Albert Nobbs (2011)

Octavia Spencer for The Help (2011)

Saw 4 of the 5, which i&apos;m quite surprised by. Had zero interest in the crossdressing, turn of the century crap that would be &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot;
Should Win--Melissa McCarthy for Bridesmaids
Will Win--Octavia Spencer for The Help
Melissa McCarthy was the funniest thing at the movies. She took a role and made it the female equivalent of John Belushi in &quot;Animal House&quot;. For this, she gets the nomination. But once again, let&apos;s make ourselves feel better and give the award to a black chick who created a shit pie. Boo!!! I like my woman shitting in a sink while at a fancy dress store. That&apos;s how scat humor works.

Best Achievement in Directing
Nominees:
Woody Allen for Midnight in Paris (2011)

Michel Hazanavicius for The Artist (2011)

Terrence Malick for The Tree of Life (2011)

Alexander Payne for The Descendants (2011)

Martin Scorsese for Hugo (2011/II)

Saw all 5
Should win--Martin Scorsese for Hugo
Will Win--Michel Hazanavicius for The Artist
Some amazing directors, so let&apos;s play process of elimination. Woody Allen has almost nothing techincal happen in his movie, just a great screenplay. Terrence Malick had that bullshit with Sean Penn that made no sense. Payne basically directed a movie the consisted of exotic shots of Hawaii and George Clooney&apos;s feet. That just leaves Scorsese with &quot;Hugo&quot;, which i still regret not seeing int 3-D, and the French guy for &quot;The Artist&quot;. Well, I loved &quot;Hugo&quot; with all the technical richness of the early days of cinema and his fondness for clocks. It&apos;s an impressive directing job. But everyone loves &quot;The Artist&quot;, and i think it gets some major Oscars.

Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen
Nominees:
The Artist (2011): Michel Hazanavicius

Bridesmaids (2011): Kristen Wiig, Annie Mumolo

Margin Call (2011): J.C. Chandor

Midnight in Paris (2011): Woody Allen

A Separation (2011): Asghar Farhadi

Saw 3 of the 5
Should Win--Midnight in Paris (2011): Woody Allen
Will Win--Midnight in Paris (2011): Woody Allen
There&apos;s a great chance that &quot;The Artist&quot; might win this. But come on, doesn&apos;t a screenplay need written dialogue, and not just stage directions? Woody Allen has that, &quot;The Artist&quot; doesn&apos;t. However, what an awesome upset if &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; win. I&apos;m a big fan of the humor of Kristen Wiig, who contiunes to be the funniest chick every Saturday Night, and Live.

Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published
Nominees:
The Descendants (2011): Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon, Jim Rash

Hugo (2011/II): John Logan

The Ides of March (2011): George Clooney, Grant Heslov, Beau Willimon

Moneyball (2011): Steven Zaillian, Aaron Sorkin, Stan Chervin

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011): Bridget O&apos;Connor, Peter Straughan

Saw 3 of the 5
Should Win--Moneyball (2011): Steven Zaillian, Aaron Sorkin, Stan Chervin
Will Win--The Ides of March (2011): George Clooney, Grant Heslov, Beau Willimon
I just think the Academy gives George Clooney another Oscar somehow, and if not for that piece of shit movie in Hawaii, give it to the political movie. I have no fucking clue. This is way too tough to call.

So, those are the big ones. Other quicks picks that i think are total locks:

Best Animated Feature Film of the Year:
Rango

Best Foreign Language Film of the Year:
A Seperation

Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Song:
The Muppets

Best Documentary, Features:
Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory (This was on HBO, and after over 15 years, 3 guys are out of jail for a murder they did not commit. Sorry for not giving the Spoiler Warning)

Now, for the final award, Best Picture

Best Motion Picture of the Year
Nominees:
The Artist (2011): Thomas Langmann

The Descendants (2011): Jim Burke, Alexander Payne, Jim Taylor

Extremely Loud&amp;Incredibly Close (2011): Scott Rudin

The Help (2011): Brunson Green, Chris Columbus, Michael Barnathan

Hugo (2011/II): Graham King, Martin Scorsese

Midnight in Paris (2011): Letty Aronson, Stephen Tenenbaum

Moneyball (2011): Michael De Luca, Rachael Horovitz, Brad Pitt

The Tree of Life (2011): Sarah Green, Bill Pohlad, Dede Gardner, Grant Hill

War Horse (2011): Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy

Saw them all
Should Win--Midnight in Paris (of the movies nominated, still the only one i give 4-stars to)
Will Win--The Artist
It still bothers me that this many movies got enough votes to get nominated, and yet nothing for &quot;Dragon Tattoo&quot; or &quot;50/50&quot;. Hell, 4 of these movies i wouldn&apos;t recommand, especially The Descendants and Extremely Loud&amp;Incredibly Close. 2011 was a shit year for movies, perhaps that why people enjoyed &quot;The Help&quot; so much with the litreal eating of shit. Which reminds me, i fucking hate that they have Billy Crystal hosting this year. I thought that shit was over with 20 years ago. I find it appropriate that to get inspiration, the best of these movies are set during the golden age of movies which was before World War II.

So, there you have it, my Oscar picks. Everyone should watch and enjoy the Academy Awards this Sunday Night. Hopefully only the good movies win, and on Monday, i&apos;ll do a recap to see how i did. And now, i will let anyone comment to say how right or how completly wrong i am with my picks and wishes. Everyone should have a say in what they think are the best movies of the year, and i&apos;m always up for a good debate. ( Comment on this ) Sunday, February 5th, 2012 11:03 pm Super Bowl XLVI 
 New York Giants 21, New England Patriots 17.

Fuck. FUCK. GODDAMNIT, MOTHERFUCKER, COCKSUCKING, PIECE OF SHIT SON OF A FUCKING CUNT ASSHOLE!!!! I HATE THE NEW YORK FUCKING GIANTS!!!!

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

FUCK YOU! ( 1 Comment | Comment on this ) Saturday, February 4th, 2012 7:44 am The Amazing Jonathan, New Year&apos;s Resolutin, Oscar Best Picture rankings 
 It was several months ago that Paul and Christie called me and Mike up to see if we wanted to see a comedy show in Boston. The options weren&apos;t much, so i thought it would be fun to see comedian/magacian The Amazing Jonathan. I&apos;ve seen both his half hour Comedy Central specials. Which meant that i would witness about 80% of material i have already seen. Perhaps i&apos;m a comedy snob these days. About once a month, i go to Foxwoods to, besides have fun gambling, but to also see a good stand up show. Every comedian i&apos;ve seen there, i&apos;ve seen because they have a good set from a Comedey Central or HBO standup special. And every time, these comedians have brand new material that i&apos;ve never seen before.

Not that the Amazing Jonathan was bad. He was still good, he made me laugh, a couple of his pun jokes really had me laughing at the stupidity of the whole thing. All the magician stuff though wasn&apos;t there. I had seen every one of his magic tricks before (not that there was a lot) except for his &quot;foam magic&quot; bit, which was very silly and made me laugh. I guess he has just been performing the same hour of material for such a long time in Las Vegas that he&apos;s too comfortable to change a damn thing. I still had an enjoyable night in Boston and i must thank both Paul and Christie for having me and Mike go with them. It was a fun night.

The afternoon part of Boston totally sucked though. This was clearly my own bad. See, the Amazing Jonathan was going to peform at 7:00pm at the Wilbur in Boston. Paul and Christie meet me and Mike in Lowell, then we took their car into Boston and parked at a garage. Before me and Mike left, because i wanted to drink, but i&apos;ve been showing symptoms of gout, i took some pills to prevent any additional gout damage. This probably is destroying my liver, but i don&apos;t care about that. What it really did was play havoc with my stomach.

This might get gross, so you can skip this paragraph. Although, yes, i did shit, all the pills were just causing giant gas pockets inside of me that i couldn&apos;t control. In hindsite, i should have asked for Christie&apos;s package of Tums a lot earlier. That did settle me down for the entire night. But that was when i took the Tums around 6:30 or so. From 4-6:30, we were at a restaurant where i got up and went to the bathroom about 4 times or so. Seriously, there is nothing i hate more than having to shit in a bathroom that isn&apos;t in my home. And to do so at a restaurant is a lot worse. But to do it multiple times over, it was pure hell. Even when i was done, i knew i&apos;d eventually have to go back and try to pass out whatever these pills were doing to my insides. It was so bad the first time, Mike literally came into the bathroom to make sure i was still there and ask what i wanted to drink. I stupidly ordered the closest to a Bud Light that they have. But this place didn&apos;t serve normal beer, they have microbrew shit that means slightly different taste instead of that wonderful water-downed but slightly buzzed taste i get from drinking a Bud Light.

Although the food was good, i nursed my beer until it was half gone and i gave up and order a simple Arnold Palmer to help keep my insides normal. The steak i order was ok, but i ordered it medium and that thing was definately on the rare side. I&apos;m not sure what the final bill came out to be. This was the math: Paul and Christie bought us tickets to the see The Amazing Jonathan. Mike paid for dinner. I would pay for the tab at the comedy show. But, because we didn&apos;t drink a whole lot, i felt guilty and took care of the cost for parking at a garage in Boston too.

FYI, i fucking hate gout. Because of my decades of a shitty diet, i have gout. If you don&apos;t pay enough attention to those commercials, gout is little crystals that form in the joints, typically your big toe, due to all the uric acid in the foods i eat, or things i drink. If i drink a lot a beer, i can get a flare up in gout. If i were to eat a shitload of shrimp and pastrami, i can get a flare up again. There are some actual pills to settle and realize the pain. But if i&apos;m not on top of it, it&apos;s like walking around with a broken toe, that&apos;s the only way to describe the pain. It causes me to limp around sometimes. It totally sucks. But, it&apos;s also a big &quot;go fuck yourself you fat bastard&quot; to me for having such a shitty diet and karma biting my ass. It also lead me to have the world&apos;s weakest New Year&apos;s Resolution. No more going to burger related fast food restaurants.

Many might not call this a major resolution, because many might only go to a McDonald&apos;s once a month, or once every three months. For me, it would be very common to go to a McDonald&apos;s, or a Wendy&apos;s, or a Burger King maybe three times a week. Literally, at work there is both a McDonald&apos;s and a Wendy&apos;s right there. And the temptation to just buy a shitload of cheap food is too much. $1 double cheese burgers is the most tempting thing in the whole world. Not a single cheeseburger, a DOUBLE cheeseburger, and it&apos;s for one fucking dollar. I always have money on me, and fuck a dollar, i&apos;ll drop a Ten-dollar bill at a Wendy&apos;s or a McDonald&apos;s and just splurge on their dollar menu. No bullshit, i can get 4 double cheeseburgers, 3 chicken sandwiches, and an order of large fries. Don&apos;t need to ever get a drink because i have plenty of free soda from Pepsi. They give me two large sacks of food, i give them a ten-dollar bill, and they still give me change. That&apos;s a lot of food, but i could eat two or three sandwiches driving home, and half the fries. Then get home and have the rest. This would be a normal meal sometimes three times a week. Of course, because i&apos;m such a fat bastard, i&apos;d upgrade to double BACON cheeseburgers, and sometimes have a chocolate shake to wash it all down. Shit, reading that entire paragraph, i&apos;m lucky to only have gout. I most likely have high blood pressure, high choloestral, a sprinkling of diabetes, and several clogged arteries.

So, i have gone over a full month of not swinging by a Wendy&apos;s, McDonald&apos;s, or a Burger King. It&apos;s like the opposite of those Red Lobster commercials. I can practically jerk off to Red Lobster commercials, but none exist anywhere near me. But a burger fast food restaurant? I pass by 5 everyday to and from work. Of course i&apos;m weak and always hungry, so my trips to Taco Bell and KFC have gone up a few. But still, i&apos;m a lot better staying away from a normal trip to a dollar menu drive thru at Wendy&apos;s.

OK, this is Paul&apos;s favorite segment of WhoGivesAShit.com, me talking about movies. I&apos;ve officially seen every movie nominated for Best Picture. Of the 9 movies nominated for Best Picture, only one movie, Woody Allen&apos;s &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; gets a 4-star review from me. So, if that wins the Best Picture at the Oscars, that will make me very happy. Here&apos;s how the Best Picture nominees are ranked, by me, from best to worst:

Midnight in Paris - 4 stars
The Artist - 3 1/2
Hugo - 3 (should be noted, only saw movie in 2-D, not 3-D. Sorry Scorese, don&apos;t know what your original vision would have looked liked. Could have made the movie better or worse)
Moneyball - 3
Tree of Life - 3 (really a flawed movie, but the good stuff outweighed the bad, which is every scene with Sean Penn that added nothing but confusion)

So, those movies i say are at least good enough and i recommand saying it&apos;s worth your time and money for watching these movies nominated for Best Picture. Now, the shit i can&apos;t recommand that are still nominated for Best Picture.

The Help - 2 1/2
War Horse - 2
Extremely Loud&amp;Incredibly Close - 1 1/2
The Descendants - 1

Tune in Live on Sunday, February 26th at 7pm EST to watch the Oscars on ABC.

I was going to write about two movies i saw this week, but i&apos;ve already written a lot. I will say this, if you have a choice between &quot;Extremely Loud&amp;Incredibly Close&quot; ( 1 1/2 stars) versus &quot;The Grey&quot; (3 1/2 stars) see &quot;The Grey&quot;, a movie where Liam Nesson and others take on wolves while being trapped in the Alaskan wilderness after a plan crash. Don&apos;t see &quot;Extremely Loud&amp;Incredibly Close&quot;, a bullshit movie that uses the backdrop of 9/11 to strike an emotional chord that never comes. Tom Hanks underused, and the main character i wish had died from 9/11 instead. I&apos;ll write those reviews maybe tomorrow, just before heading out to Paul and Christie&apos;s for the Super Bowl. Go Pats.

One last thing. I&apos;ve decided to not fly out to Florida to see my parents. So instead, with the help of Foxwoods, i&apos;m going to spend to nights there, where i&apos;ll enjoy gambling and some standup comedy. But that will be in March. I&apos;m also spending, in 2 weeks, a free night at Foxwoods to see Bill Burr and Bobby Slayton do standup. Should be very fun, not even sure if i&apos;ll have time to gamble. My room is really for free, but for my actual vacation, decided because it is my vacation, to upgrade into a suite. Nothing to do but relax in a jaccuzi and order room service, knock a few things off my bucket list. Should be very fun.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

I think the worse thing about not seeing my parents while they&apos;re in Florida will be i have to find someone else to do my taxes this year. ( 2 Comments | Comment on this ) Friday, January 27th, 2012 9:29 pm Oscar Nominations and 3 Movie Reviews 
 It was on Tuesday morning when the Oscar nominations were officially announced. I&apos;m not going to write about every catergory, i&apos;m just going to focus on the movies nominated for Best Picture. In case you aren&apos;t aware, the Academy is doing a new setup for Best Picture nominees. For over 50 years, it was always 5 movies nominated for Best Picture. Then, when everyone saw and loved &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, but it didn&apos;t get nominated, people got pissed. So they decided to have 10 movies nominated for Best Picture. But now, people are realizing that is just way too many films. So the new setup is based on voting, there can as few as 5 movies or up to 10 movies nominated for Best Picture. For the 2011 movie season, 9 movies got nominated for Best Picture. Here they are:

The Artist
The Descendants
Extremely Loud&amp;Incredibly Close
The Help
Hugo
Midnight in Paris
Moneyball
The Tree of Life
War Horse

Here is a cut and paste straight from Twitter after i heard all of the nominees for best picture:

9 fucking movies are nominated for Best Picture. Have to see &quot;The Help&quot;, &quot;The Artist&quot;, &quot;War Horse&quot;, and &quot;Extremly Loud and Close&quot;

I can&apos;t believe my favorites &quot;Girl With a Dragon Tattoo&quot; or &quot;50/50&quot; didn&apos;t get a best pic nom. &quot;Tintin&quot; didn&apos;t even get best animated nom.

After work today, going to the 1:40 or the 4:15 showing of &quot;The Artist&quot; in Worcester. Tomorrow &quot;The Help&quot; at the WB while it&apos;s still playing

&quot;Extremly Loud and Incredibly Close&quot; and &quot;War Horse&quot; can still be seen locally. So far, best picture nominated is &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;

75% of the time, winner of Best Editing wins Best picture. So, the most likely best picture goes to Hugo, Moneyball, Descendants and Artist

Also, movies with the most nominations win best picture, which leaves just &quot;Hugo&quot; and &quot;The Artist&quot; as the only 2 movies with 10 nominations.

So, my math has it as a toss up between &quot;Hugo&quot; and &quot;The Artist&quot; instead of the other 7 movies nominated for Best Picture.

One is a 3-D movie set in the 1930&apos;s, the other is a silent, black and white movie set in the 1920&apos;s. Which past decade wins?

(end of Twitter posts)

At the time, i had seen 5 of the movies nominated for Best Picture. I saw a double feature of &quot;The Help&quot; and &quot;The Artist&quot; on that Tuesday, and then on Wednesday, i saw &quot;War Horse&quot;. I&apos;ll write reviews for all three of these movies later on. So, now that i have seen 8 movies nominated for Best Picture (still waiting for the right tim to see the Tom Hanks 9/11 movie) i can safely say this: 2011 really was a shitty year for movies. Of the 8 movies i saw, only one of them gets a 4-star review from me, and that would still be Woody Allen&apos;s &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;. If that wasn&apos;t enough, just the fact that my favorite non-Pixar animated movie of all time, Spielberg&apos;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; didn&apos;t get nominated for Best Animated movie really pissed me off. I have almost zero opinion on the acting, because of the few perfomances that were great, only one got nominated, that being for the chick that was literally &quot;The Girl With a Dragon Tattoo&quot;. Just shit movies for the entire year, and those that were good enough didn&apos;t get any attention from the Academy. All i can hope for now is that &quot;The Descendants&quot; doesn&apos;t win Best Picture. It&apos;s the movie i hate the most that somehow got nominated, like how i hated &quot;Black Swan&quot; so damn much last year and that got nominated too.

The Oscars will air on the last Sunday of February. Enjoy watching it. It&apos;s about a month away. I will as usual do my Oscars Picks and Wishes entry several weeks down the road and then recap how my picks went. There are no major &quot;locks&quot; this year, except maybe for best Foreign Language Film, everyone says &quot;A Seperation&quot; is amazing, and for the song in &quot;The Muppets Movie&quot; to win best song. I don&apos;t know. The Oscars really are too far away. I should care more about important things closer to me. Like, how the New England Patriots are in the Super Bowl again this year in a rematch of Super Bowl XLII (42) with the New York Giants. Both teams won their trip to the Super Bowl by having the other team choke harder in the conference championship game. Either way, a win is a win, and Let&apos;s Go Pats!!!

&quot;The Help&quot; ** 1/2

&quot;The Help&quot; is a chick movie that, because it&apos;s set in the South, allows for crazy, extra cartoony, characters. The plot is about a white chick (Emma Stone) wanting to write a book about what it&apos;s like for black maids to take care of the white people they serve, yet they&apos;re unable to even use the bathrooms. The plot also centers on a special pie, but that would be considered a &quot;spoiler&quot; so i&apos;ll leave that be.

This movie came out a long time ago, and even though i probably could have saw it on demand from my own living room, i went to West Boylston to see it in the theater. I will always prefer watching a movie on the big screen over my tv. 20 feet is way bigger than 42 inches. Some of the issues i had with &quot;The Help&quot; were that every chick was either a psycho bitch or a pure angel. Barely any were complexed, well thought out characters. There is just no way for me to care much about a slightly different version of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; except with black chicks and set in the 60s. This movie was also too damn long (in fact, all three movies i&apos;m going to review were too long. EDITING; it can save a movie or ruin it) as the run time was almost 2 1/2 hours. Easily could have speed some things up and dropped half-assed story lines. The last complaint was that all the white women, except Emma Stone, don&apos;t work. They just live in southern mansions and have maids do all the work. But there&apos;s no mention of what the men do for work to have these houses, or if they all just won a lottery, or if after the Civil War, their families just built these great houses and gave them to their shitty kids. The small chance for realism was no where to be found.

Women love this movie because they like watching other women be total bitches and get their comeuppence. Me, i was sometimes lost in the thick accents and why two of the main actresses looked like twins but were playing total opposite characters. The movie just fell flat too often and ran too long. Once again, a chick flick that had almost nothing in it for me. Couldn&apos;t relate, just couldn&apos;t care enough. It wasn&apos;t fully worth my three dollars at the cheap movie theater.

&quot;The Artist&quot; *** 1/2

Unlike most people, i can watch a silent, black and white movie. And let it be known that &quot;The Artist&quot; is a silent, black and white movie. You got the one guy who&apos;s a major star in the silent movies, basically playing a Douglas Fairbanks like actor. And you got this cute girl who starts out as an extra and gets bigger and better roles in movies. After a few years, movies are now becoming talkies, with the male actor not a big fan of, and eventually he becomes a washed up nobody. The girl becomes the next Gretta Garbo and she becomes the biggest start in the talkies.

I will admit, the charm of this movie quickly won me over. From the overacting, to the loveable dog (yes, i liked the dog in this movie and he steals every scene), to the flirting and the dancing. It worked. I also enjoyed the proper historical time line of dealing with the stock market crash and how actual major movies stars did become washed up nobodies because they couldn&apos;t transistion to the world of sound. For a movie that ran about 1 hour and 40 minutes though, it could have the same feel and everything if they just wrapped up the bleak depressing part of the movie by chopping it in half. This movie should have been maybe 75 minutes long, like an normal 1920&apos;s silent movie would be. I can see why people liked it so much, but let&apos;s be honest, &quot;Singin&apos; In the Rain&quot; had a similar story but it was in color and they spoke, with great dancing and several great musical numbers. That movie is a classic. I just don&apos;t think &quot;The Artist&quot; will ever get into that 4-star classic genre of movies. It&apos;s someting different and new (ironically by being so old in techinology) that gets attention. Very good, but it&apos;s just a regular painting done on a really unique canvas.

&quot;War Horse&quot; **

Mr. Spielberg, you are a fucking master in directing war. Why the hell did you make this movie when half the time, we&apos;re dealing with just a horse? The war stuff in this movie is goddamn amazing. Some scenes reminded me of Kubrick&apos;s &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;. But the first hour of this movie is bullshit English country side and a fucking horse. A magical horse no doubt, but still a horse.

I&apos;ve never been a horse person. I don&apos;t see the beauty in &quot;Black Beauty&quot;. Don&apos;t care about &quot;National Velvet&quot;, and i was really disappointed with how last year&apos;s &quot;Secretariet&quot; turned out. Horses are boring to me. If you see this movie, just show up one hour late and watch the war shit, and then leave after the amazing barbed-wire scene.

The story goes like this. Drunk guy overpays for a horse. Gives the horse to his idiot kid. Idiot kid loves the horse. Concerned mother doesn&apos;t like how they&apos;ll lose the farm. Teach the horse to plow. Yeah, horse can plow. Oh no, too much rain, we lose all the crops. World War I begins. Drunk sells horse to guy in the army. Horse is now in the army. It runs faster than any horse, but army guy is dead. Now it&apos;s a horse for the german side. Pre-Hitlers use him, but horse is stolen. Ends up in France on a farm. Old man and his little granddaughter love the horse. Germans refind horse and take it. 4 years later, horse is still with the Pre-Hitlers. But idiot child now old enough to fight for the English. When horse has had enough, he outruns both sides of the war, including a tank, and runs right through many barbed-wire fences. A great scene occurs between the English and the Germans as but their guns down to try to free the magical horse. Will the idiot child be reunited with the magical horse? Will the magical horse finally die? Why have such a small subplot about the old french man and his granddaughter with their one day with the horse unless it somehow comes up again? Were cars back in 1914 really only as fast as a single horse? God i hated the idiot kid&apos;s grinning best friend, i hope he dies of mustard gas. Really, that&apos;s how people whistle back in WWI days?

Fuck this movie, it&apos;s been almost 3 hours and i ran outta popcorn a long time ago.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

I think i&apos;m going to write again this weekend as Me, Mike, and Paul&amp;Christie are going out to Boston tomorrow night to see comedian/magaician The Amazing Jonathan. It just sucks i have to work both Saturday and Sunday. ( Comment on this ) Tuesday, January 17th, 2012 9:10 pm 5 Movie Reviews 
 I just got back from seeing my 5th movie in the past week. Here we go.

&quot;The Girl With a Dragon Tattoo&quot; ****

This movie was a total game changer for me. An amazing movie from start to finish that is probably why the book series was so popular and read everywhere, and why the Swedish movies were remade for American audience. This was without a doubt my favorite movie of the 2011 movie season.

The plot goes like this. You have a magazine investigative journalist (newest James Bond Daniel Craig) who has written an expose of a wealthy CEO and all his wrong doings. But the rich CEO sues him for libel, and wins. This destroys the reputation of the journalist and he&apos;s unable to work at his magazine anymore due to the negative press. But a job offer comes along from a rich guy in Sweden (Christopher Plummer) who wants the journalist to come to his private island where his family is scattered around and investigate and try to solve a crime that happened over 40 years ago. Back in 1963, his niece went missing and was never heard of again. He believes she was murdered by someone in the family. Before the rich old man dies of old age, he wants a new a better eye to look over every piece of information of the crime that he has collected.

Eventually, the journalist agrees to look into this crime while also writing the old man&apos;s memoir that will focus so much on this crime. But after a while, he needs help with a researcher. He decides whoever the old man used to research him would make a great researcher himself. That person just so happens to be the girl with a dragon tattoo.

I have given much more info then the movie&apos;s horrible trailer has given. This is such a great movie and the main girl should win an Oscar for best actress. Please see this, but be warned. It&apos;s a hard R, not sure if people can handle such a brutal rape scene.

&quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; ****

Another 4-star movie, and this is the first non Pixar movie that is a 4-star animated movie. I only saw it in 2-D, but it&apos;s like Spielberg did an entire Indiana Jones movie except focussed it on a boy, his dog, and a drunk sea captain as they have adventure in the air, sea, desert, and all places in between. This movie should easily win the Best Animated Movie Oscar. I went in knowing nothing of the story, and i&apos;ve never once read any of the Tintin comics. You don&apos;t need any background information, just an openmind to enjoy a great adventure story. My favorite scene is a really long, uncut sequence that lasts about 5 minutes long that just keeps going and going. It begins with the drunk captain picking up a bazooka and the fun and excitement just builds and builds. Spielberg is such a master at telling a great story, and i hope to see him try his hand at animation again in the future.

&quot;Young Adult&quot; **

From the people that brought me &quot;Juno&quot;, i really expected more. Here&apos;s the deal, Patton Oswalt was great, everything else about this movie was just uncomfortable and cringe worthy. You have Charlize Theron as a ghost writer of a successful young adult book series. Except that the series is ending and she won&apos;t have anything to write about anymore. She&apos;s a drunk and alone, and upon getting an email about someone&apos;s new baby, she decides to return to her hometown and visit her old boyfriend. Even though he&apos;s happily married and the one with the new baby.

The movie is just constant scenes of discomfort except some amusing scenes with Theron and Oswalt. He also went to her high school and was beaten into a cripple by a bunch of jocks who thought he was gay. Patton Oswalt is the only bright thing in this dark and unfriendly movie. Once again, expected a lot better.

&quot;Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol&quot; *** 1/2

I saw the first two Mission Impossible movies, but didn&apos;t see the third. This movie had so many good reviews and the director is actually an animated director who did Pixar&apos;s &quot;The Incredibles&quot; and thought it might be good to see what he can do with real people. The movie begins with Tom Cruise escaping a prison jail, breaking into the Kremlin, stealing secret files, having the Kremlin blow up, fast cars, gun chases, leaps from tall buildings, climbs up skyscrapers, clever spy switches, and a giant dust storm. And there is still room for a few good laughs.

Long story short, bad people have codes that can cause a nuclear war, so Tom Cruise and 3 other people try to stop it and save the day. Good stuff, i liked it a lot.

&quot;The Descendants&quot; *

How the hell did this movie win a Golden Globe for Best Picture Drama? This movie sucked from the beginning til the very end. Wasn&apos;t funny, wasn&apos;t intriguing enough, had weak acting, just a boring movie that made me feel really uncomfortable as i saw George Clooney barefoot way too many times.

The movie begins with Clooney&apos;s wife in a coma. And the movie stays in this coma instead of bringing any entertainment. The stupid story is that Clooney reunites with his 10 and 17 year old daughters, while dealing with the fact that his family line are actual descendants of Hawaiian royalty and have 25,000 acres of prime vacation land that they&apos;re about to sell. Oh, and his wife cheated on him before she went into the coma according to his older daugther.

Despite all this, it doesn&apos;t make into a good movie. It&apos;s just boring. Shockingly boring. This was one of the worst movies i saw of 2011 (though i&apos;ll still give that honor to &quot;Bad Teacher&quot;) and i&apos;m surprised how many top ten movie lists this thing is on. What the hell am i missing? Do people really like that horrible narration at the beginning? Or the crappy hawaiian soundtrack? I understand how pretty the beaches and landscapes are of Hawaii, but that does not make a good movie. The story is just flat. To make things better, they could have pulled the plug on the coma cheating wife a lot quicker instead of suffering for the entire length of this movie. Bad movie, completely overrated, avoid it.

Tomorrow i might see a horror movie, or just take it easy and wait until better movies start this Friday.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

Of all the movies released in 2011, here&apos;s my top 5: &quot;Girl With a Dragon Tattoo&quot;, &quot;50/50&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, &quot;Bridemaids&quot;, and &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;. If you want to see a good movie, make it one of these, and NOT something that was named best drama at the Golden Globes. Oscars mean something, Golden Globes are bullshit. ( Comment on this ) Sunday, January 15th, 2012 8:54 am Paul&apos;s Football Gathering 
 10 years ago, it was the date of the Patriots Snow Bowl game, or the Tuck Rule game. The game that the Patriots beat the Oakland Raiders in overtime after an infamous football was ruled an incomplete pass allowing the Pats to retain possession of the ball and continue to drive, leading to the great Adam Vinatieri field goal through the snow, and that was just to tie it up and advance to overtime, where Vinatieri did it again with a field goal to win it. This was my halfass writing ten years ago when it happened:

Now, to move on to something better, Last night was quite possibly the greatest single sporting event i have ever witnessed first hand. And that is of course when the New England Patriots beat the Oakland Raiders 16-13 in OT. Without a doubt, one of the best things to ever happen to sports, mostly because it went to the Pats favor.

The Pats would move on to win a Super Bowl, which was the first time i had witness a Boston based sports championship of interest. Yeah, Bird and the Celtic won a couple when i was a kid, but fuck basketball. Ten years ago began the Boston Decade of Dominance. Pats would go to the Super Bowl 4 times and win 3 titles. Sox played in the ALCS 4 times, winning twice and winning the World Series twice., ending that 86 year drought. Celtics would win, once again, no one cares, and 7 months ago, the Bruins win it all after a 39 year drought ended. I&apos;m just saying, it&apos;s been a good decade for sports in the Boston region. It maybe last night showed another trip to the big game for the Patriots.

Paul invited all of Andrews Siblings over to his place for a playoff football gathering. Seeing as how Paul has a keg, we enjoy Paul and Christie&apos;s company, and there could always be a chance of playing poker. Plus my sister Christa would be there and i owe her money for Mom&apos;s birthday cruise. Me and Mike left our house around 3:30 to head out to Paul and Christie just before the 4:30 kickoff between the Saints and 49ers game. We arrived, and we were the only ones there. 3 and a half hours later, Melissa would also show up, and that was it. A very small gathering as Christa and Tom couldn&apos;t make it, and Paul&apos;s poker buddies hate other poker buddies. But, fuck it, they missed out as far as i&apos;m concerned.

Christie made the most perfect serving of nachos for us to pick at during the first game. Me and Paul had each bet $20 against John on the over of 47.5 points in that Saints/49ers game. It took until 2:11 left in the 4th quarter to finally hit the over. And then after that, two more touchdowns occured for the 49ers to win it with 9 seconds left in the game for a shocking win of 36-32.

Next game up was of course the Patriots against Tim Tebow and the Broncos. It was like God&apos;s greated creation versus God&apos;s biggest cheerleader. And just because everyone&apos;s been talking about it, here is Jimmy Fallon with Tim Tebowie.

 

Earlier in the week, i had decided to bet against the Patriots. Yeah, you read that sentence correctly. Here was my rationale. For $25 (the minimum bet i could make through a bookie i know) i would get a return of $137.50 if i bet on the Broncos money line and they had somehow won the game flat out. Now, i know the Pats are a better team, but two things were kicking around my head. The Pats have lost their last three playoff games (Super Bowl XLII, the almost perfect season, and then Round 1 exits against the Baltimore Ravens and the New York Jets). If my Pats had broken my heart with another playoff loss, that $137.50 would have been a nice constalation prize. But i love my Pats so much, i would easily pay $25 to guarentee that they would win and next week host the AFC Championship game. Which is what the Pats did, kicking the shit out of Denver 45-10. Brady threw 6 touchdowns, tying a playoff record. Gronk caught three touchdown passes, tying another playoff record. At one point, late in the 3rd quarter, Brady literally had twice as many touchdown passes as Tim Tebow had passes completed, 6-3. It was such an awesome ass kicking. Made all the more better with a do it yourself soft taco dinner made by Paul and Christie, and Melissa&apos;s awesome dessert that i&apos;m pretty sure gave me diabetes last night. It was like a chocolate and whip cream moose pudding thing of amazing, with chocolate chips, bananas, almonds, cake crumble, grahmn cracker, and a filling of butter and confection sugar. So great, it&apos;s a shame no one brought along some milk.

Once again, Paul and Christie were amazing hosts, and me and Mike were enjoyable guests that drank their beer. My Pats won, and me and Paul exchanged many high-fives as we won our bets with John. John, period to date, now owes me $95 and i think he owes Paul over $100. John actually won a grand playing fantasy football, but he can&apos;t do shit picking football games against the spread against me and Paul. But it doesn&apos;t really matter, because he lives in North Carolina and is making it really difficult to collect.

I was now going to write about three movie reviews, but i think i&apos;ll go to the movies again tomorrow to see &quot;Mission Impossible 4&quot; and write 4 movie reviews instead on that Monday afternoon. Tonight, Golden Globes which is always a good indicator as to what movies might get nominated for the Oscars. As of right now, i have 4 movies that have hit 4-star status, two of which i&apos;ll write about tomorrow.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

I think all the people that could have had a chance to go to Paul and Christie&apos;s last night are the biggest bunch of idiots in the world. Has there ever been a time when you didn&apos;t have a blast at Paul and Christie&apos;s place? I know for me it has never happened. They are the best hosts ever. ( 1 Comment | Comment on this ) Saturday, January 14th, 2012 12:06 am 2011, Worst Year Ever 
 &quot;But you know what the best part of my day is? For about ten seconds, from when I pull up to the curb and when I get to your door, &apos;cause I think, maybe I&apos;ll get up there and I&apos;ll knock on the door and you won&apos;t be there. No goodbye. No see you later. No nothing. You just left. I don&apos;t know much, but I know that.&quot;

--Ben Affleck to Matt Damon in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;

I bring up this quote for several reasons. First, my brother Paul brought it up last night. Apperently, his biggest thrill is clicking on this stupid blog to see if i have updated it or not. I guess during that ten seconds or so when the computer is refreshing and opening up a new site, there&apos;s the chance that i might have written something. Since July of 2011, i haven&apos;t written a single fucking word on Live Journal. 2011 was a shit year for me, and probably for most people. I fucking hate it and want it gone from my memory. No goodbye. No see you later. No nothing. I just want that fucking year gone.

Here&apos;s the one highlight of 2011, the Bruins won a Stanley Cup. Big fucking deal in the grand scheme of things.

Because the biggest lowlight of 2011 was losing Jordan.

Fuck me, it took me three hours to write that last sentence down. I can&apos;t read it without tearing up. Those that read this know what i&apos;m talking about.

If i had the balls to get up and talk at Jordan&apos;s funeral, which i didn&apos;t, i would have talked about how i enjoyed hanging out with him. He was my nephew, I was his uncle, but those titles meant nothing. Ever since he was a toddler and me just a dumb kid, he never called me uncle, just Brian. I was the youngest in my family, he was the youngest and his. So, in a weird way, he wasn&apos;t my nephew, he was like my unoffcial little brother. Someone i could teach a thing or two about little league. Or just someone to hang out with and watch cartoons or movies with. Someone to play video games with. And then later, someone who would kick my ass on certain video games. How he was ever able to score a million point combo on one endless trick on Tony Hawk for the PS2 still baffles me.

Jordan was dealt a shitty hand in life. I hope his biological father is either dead or in prison because fuck him. He had his mom and his sister to raise him, and i got to see him every Saturday when Melissa would bring the kids over for the day. As he grew older, let&apos;s just say that it would never be the best situation possible. Whether it was a mental illness, on the wrong drugs, or not taking the right drugs, or just taking too much of the recreational drugs, there would always be an imbalance with him that he was unable to cope with.

Maybe i shouldn&apos;t be writing any of this down. Maybe it will bring up too many harsh memories of that fucking horrible September night. Jordan was about a month away from turning twenty when he committed suicide. There was no last minute phone call to talk him off a ledge. No immediate warning sign that it would ever come out like this. Earlier in that week, he had called me like normal. We spent one hour or so talking about movies that we had saw and general things that aren&apos;t of importance but are said to make the other guy laugh. It was usual for us to talk over the phone. Sometimes you just had to call and ask if he was watching a game that was on, or if he had seen this thing on tv, or he&apos;d call me up asking if i saw some internet clip and what my thoughts were on this and that. Perhaps selfish of me to say this, but it sucks he&apos;s not around for me to just pick up the phone and talk for an hour or so about some stupid shit that was on my mind and for him to do the same.

For many years, it was difficult being his uncle come Christmas time, mostly because no matter what i ever got him didn&apos;t seem to bring the proper joy out of him you&apos;d expect. After many failed attempts, i switched gears entirely. What i would do was a week or so after Christmas, i would bring him and Justi and we&apos;d have a really fun afternoon together. I&apos;d bring them to a Newbury Comics and let them browse up and down everything they had. I was their own personal gift certificate (within reason) because i got to see them really make their choices in what they wanted. I always enjoyed it when they&apos;d ask if they could have one extra little $5 item even though they might have crossed the budget i had in mind. But i was always cool with it. After shopping, we&apos;d go and see a movie (this was mostly for me, after Christmas is when they start showing the higher quality movies again) and then talk about it as we had dinner at some restaurant later on. I loved those afternoon together like that, being free to just hang out, have a good time, and talk with my niece and nephew.

And i know Jordan loved doing it too. Because the last time i actually hung out with him in person, it was during the summer. For my birthday, he wanted to take me to the movies and then after, just grab some lunch at a diner near by, all on him. He was so happy to purchase those tickets and popcorn and pay for the bill at the restaurant. Just to sit at a booth in a 50&apos;s diner and shot the shit while sipping on a soda and chewing on some munchies and recap the movie we saw was such a great way to spend a weekend afternoon. Of course Jordan lived in Milford NH and i was in Leominster MA, and i was the one with the car. So i would have a long drive alone to see him, and a long drive all the way back.

That was the toughest thing for me when Jordan was gone, i couldn&apos;t drive more than 15 minutes without being reminded of the long drives to see him. The thought would just creep into my brain that i haven&apos;t driven this long since that time i drove out to see Jordan, and i would quickly break down for a few moments while driving on the highway.

Jordan died, that happened in 2011.

Then Mike&apos;s cunt of an ex-wife, (yeah, CUNT, you think i give a shit if i get hate mail) leaves him and divorces him, as she might also be chemically unbalanced. In order for Mike to live in the house that he has, with it&apos;s giant morgage, he needed me to move in and help pay the rent. Just like that, i had to give up my little one-bedroom apartment that was my own private and quiet little place. I had to move out all my shit, and live with two dogs, and a baby that still cries and can shit up a diaper pretty good. My rent would go up, my commute to work would be a little bit longer, i had to actually feed the dogs and let them in and out while they would bark anytime a fucking car drove down the street.

2011 literally ended on a 3-day weekend that had me working on both New Year&apos;s Eve and New Year&apos;s Day. I was home alone when the ball hit midnight at Time&apos;s Square. It was quiet pathetic. 2011 was a giant piece of shit year that is filled with unpleasant memories and moments i don&apos;t ever want to go through again. On the bright side, according to a bunch of extinct mayans, 2012 is the last year ever. So we all got that going for ourselves.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

Sorry for the long wait, and i understand if no one ever wants to read about this shit again. On Sunday, i&apos;ll write about fun things again, like drinking and watching football at Paul&apos;s and movie reviews. Goodbye and go fuck yourself 2011. ( Comment on this ) Tuesday, July 19th, 2011 7:37 pm Brian&apos;s Summer Movie Reviews 
 I know i wrote about writing about how good the month of June 2011 was. But my lazy ass hasn&apos;t written anything, and now i just want to do a giant movie review entry. I&apos;m doing this at a time when there is nothing of interest for me playing at the movie theaters, because i&apos;ve already seen everything good. This entry is for people who might have missed some of these movies and want to still check them out over the 8th Harry Potter movie or the crappy 3-D action movies out there (Green Lantern, Pirates 4, next week, Captain America, the list of crap goes on). Either way, here&apos;s a list of movies i recommand, one movie that i want all people to avoid.

&quot;Bridesmaids&quot; *** 1/2

Kristen Wiig, who has been the funniest and best actress Saturday Night Live ever had (Tina Fey might be better writer, but Wiig has better characters) starred in the female version of the R-rated raunchy comedy. Wiig is a pathetic person that has no job, lives with horrible roommates, and her dating life consists of her fuck buddy played by Jon Hamm. Wiig&apos;s best friend, Maya Rudolph, is getting married, and Wiig wants to be the best maid of honor she can, but she doesn&apos;t have the budget to do anything, and another chick is coming into the picture to upstage everything that Wiig does.

This movie has many great little scenes, such as the plane flight that features a very drunk Wiig, many attempts to get pulled over by a cop, a trying on dresses scene that goes wrong after eating at a brazillian restaurant, and every scene involving Melissa McCarthy, the fat bridesmaid. There was plenty of laughed out loud scenes, and a funny and realistic chemistry between Wiig and Rudolph. I&apos;ll admit, one scene does go too far (it involves a giant cookie and a chocolate fountain) but the movie worked really well. I enjoyed it a lot, and stay for the credits to see what Melissa McCarthy does with a subway sandwich.

&quot;Kung Fu Panda 2&quot; ***

I enjoyed the hell out of the original &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, a story about a panda that becomes the Dragon Warrior and saves the day with his kung fu skills he learns from his master voiced by Dustin Hoffman. That movie had everything i enjoyed, from the training sequence, a kick ass battle scene, and funny gags here and there.

The sequel, while good, had way too much action instead of funny scenes. Instead of finding humor, they went with finding drama as the panda goes on an inner quest to find the truth about his real parents. While he&apos;s doing this, an evil has created gun powder, which might be the new way to defeat kung fu. Not to spoiler anything, but the movie ends in such a way, you just know they could have said, &quot;Wait until 2014 for &quot;Kung Fu Panda 3&quot; in a theater near you!&quot; It was a good movie, but i still stop and watch the original when they play it on tv. Not sure if i&apos;ll do that for this movie.

&quot;The Hangover, Part II&quot; ***

Everyone&apos;s big complaint about this movie is that it&apos;s identical to the first &quot;Hangover&quot; movie. OK, yes, the similarites. Someone is getting married, and before that person does, the three main people get messed up, and wake up not knowing anything about last night. Also, someone is missing. The three people find clues and figure out what the hell happen why also hanging out with that weird asian guy. There&apos;s an exotic animal, criminals chasing them, and penis jokes that lost the movie a star rating. Like the original, Zack Galifinakas (i&apos;m not looking it up to spell it correctly) steals every scene and it still made me laugh. It was, however, a very hard R, and once again, they need to ease off on the penis jokes in comedy movies these days.

&quot;Super 8&quot; ***

A neat little sci-fi movie centering on 4 kids trying to make a homemade zombie movie (stay for the credits to watch the completed movie) set in the summer of 1979. Although, they should have just changed the date to 1981, (it would allow for knowledge of a Rubix cube and actual use of a walkman) but no biggie.

In anytown USA, a guy with a purpose drives on the train tracks to derail a train while the kids film their movie. The government swoops in to keep things under wraps, and about 50 lens flare later, like the ending to E.T., it&apos;s a big kids vs. government ending to get to the bottom of the (spoiler) alien conspiracy. It was a cute movie, my mom enjoyed it, but they really could have tighten the movie up a bit, and gone smaller with the alien and the crappy CGI effects.

&quot;Bad Teacher&quot; *

This movie sucked. I hate Cameron Diaz. She hasn&apos;t been in a good movie since &quot;There&apos;s Something About Mary&quot;. And what&apos;s with her giant face these days? For a comedy, i didn&apos;t laugh once. I was just dissapointed. What a waste of talent. And that goes way beyond Diaz and Justin Timberlake. They had so many, &quot;I know that guy&quot; actors that always pop up in comedies, and let their uses go to waste. Diaz&apos;s bad teacher is such a horrible person, i didn&apos;t give a shit if she had a happy ending or not. She didn&apos;t deserve a happy ending. There was nothing believable in this movie, the &quot;evil&quot; teacher is just overzealous that is correct the entire time and gets screwed over, they made Justin Timberlake into a creepy weirdo that wasn&apos;t funny. And once again, the chick from &quot;The Office&quot; and Jason Segal, who did have a funny line or two, or just completely overlooked by the director and not used at all. A giant waste of time and talent, easily the worst movie i have seen in 2011.

&quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; ****

Woody Allen, congratulations sir, you have made the only 4-star movie i have witness since December 2010. In this movie, you have Owen Wilson as a writer, in Paris with his girlfriend. Wilson dreams about the idea of Paris in the rain, and what the place might have been back in the 20&apos;s. Well, one night, taking a walk alone, Wilson gets lost, a clock strucks midnight, and an old time limo pulls up. Party goers are inside, wanting Wilson to join them for a good time. Wilson agrees, and he&apos;s now in a world of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, the ramblings thoughts of Ernest Hemingway (the actor shouls get a Best Supporting Actor nomination for what he does with this role), the helpful opinions of Gertrude Stein, Picasso and his newest girlfriend, and in one small scene, the crazyness of Salvadore Dali.

Once Wilson walks away from the party, everything goes back to his present day life of thinking his girlfriend is cheating on him and the bullshit intellectual who is stealing his girl. However, in present day, this gives Wilson the chance to work on his novel, until it becomes midnight and he sets out for another night with the gang he loves so much.

Woody Allen must have had a great time writing this screenplay. Just throwing in references to classic movies, authors, and artists. Having Josephine Baker doing a dance in the background at one of the parties. And Ernest Himingway... I probably would have enjoyed everything he said if i actually read a book or two by him. I never have, but he character, talking about the horrors of war and the grace of being a bullfighter, and the brutal honesty to say whatever the hell is on his mind, once again, what a wonderful perfomance that should get an Oscar nomination. Great movie, try to see it people.

&quot;Cars 2&quot; ***

This is officially the worst Pixar movie ever made, and it&apos;s still a 3-star movie. Instead of the small town ways along Route 66 like in the original, this movie goes overseas in a giant James Bond movie knockoff that takes place during 3 international car races, and an oil conspiracy.

There&apos;s a few gags that work (the Pope Mobile, a Japanese bathroom), and i did like how the movie begins in the ocean with a crab boat, that is actually the North Western from &quot;The Deadliest Catch&quot;, and yeah, they got the real captain, Sig Hansen, to do the voice.

But when you break it down, it&apos;s just Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, in the role of a spy due to a case of mistaken identity. Great animation that i saw in regular 2-D to enjoy the bright colors, but really a weak story when you think about it. Hell, even the cartoon before the movie, which was basically &quot;Toy Story 3 1/2&quot; about a Ken and Barbie honeymoon in Hawaii was weak and unfunny. Perhaps Pixar&apos;s amazing streak has come to an end. Or maybe, they should just stick with original stories instead of cashing in on all the sequels with weak plots.

&quot;Tree of Life&quot; ***

Well, the one thing i can say about this very-arty movie is i was never bored. But the movie doesn&apos;t have a narrative. It does try to tell the story of a family of 5 in 1950&apos;s Texas, mostly focusing on the father-son relationship. But it goes way out there for a Terrence Malick movie, showing these beatiful sequences of the actual big bang and single cell creation of life, to volcanos erupting, waterfalls flowing, and dinosaurs walking along in the earliest momemnts of life on Earth. Some of these scenese reminded me of field trips to the Boston Museum of Science watching those weird documentaries on the giant Omni Theater.

I loved the sound they used in the movie, the classical music moved the movie along. However, symbolism and metaphors and empty doorways in the middle of a dessert and Sean Penn walking along the beach, well, that ending is just a mess in my eyes. Or perhaps i&apos;m just the dumb one saying the Emporer is looking a little underdressed.

&quot;Horrible Bosses&quot; *** 1/2

This is the most recent movie i just saw. We (me, my brothers Mike and Paul, and Christie) saw this after we ate at a japanese restaurant, and it just happened to be the night this movie came out. I suggested lets see it, and i was surprised that everyone was cool with doing it.

Three friends all have three horrible bosses, and pull a strangers on a train plot to kill their other bosses so there&apos;s no motive. The bosses are horrible because one of them (Kevin Spacey) won&apos;t give Jason Bateman a promotion and treats him like shit. The other (Jennifer Aniston) is a sexual harrassing dentist who wants to do all types of naughty things to Charlie Day. And the last boss, (Colin Ferril) is a coked-up idiot who is going to run the company into the ground, a company that Jason Sudekis loves to work for.

After having a beer or two, the best friends agree to kill their bosses, but they need help in order to do it. Jamie Foxx is there to help, but there are plenty of laughs along the way, both big and small. Yeah, it&apos;s another R-rated comedy i like so much, but this movie had plenty of laughs from start to finish. Stay for the credits to enjoy outtakes, and you can tell they all had a good time making this movie.

Well, that&apos;s enough from me. Next time i write, i&apos;ll probably be 30 years old, and that deserves its own entry.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

Shows about buying storage units. I can&apos;t explain it, but i&apos;m hooked on watching these shows, and there&apos;s literally three different shows that have this as a subject. &quot;Action Hunters&quot;, &quot;Storage Wars&quot;, and &quot;Storage Hunters&quot;. I love them all. ( 1 Comment | Comment on this ) Friday, July 1st, 2011 12:26 am June 2011, pretty good month. Part I, Bruins Win the Cup 
 In the past month, some interesting things have happened. Let&apos;s break this down into three parts. (1) Bruins winning the cup, (2) good movies that they&apos;re showing and (3) other stuff of interest.

I&apos;m most excited about the Bruins winning the cup. In fact, i&apos;m just going to redirect you people to my boy Emmy&apos;s latest entry as he took the time and perfectly written about the Bruins and his new love of hockey. He took a week of planning and three days to get what he wanted down into words. Enjoy it like i did. http://cosmicjohn.livejournal.com/72319 7.html 

I could basically steal a shitload from what he wrote, but i don&apos;t need to. The Boston Bruins winning the Stanley Cup capped off an entire generation of sports happiness for me, all in under a ten years time frame. From Feb 2002 when the Patriots won their first ever Super Bowl, and then the Sox winning the World Series in 2004 to end their 86-year drought. Months later, Patriots win another Super Bowl, and repeat a year later. Sox in 2007 win another World Series. I continue to not give a shit about basketball even though the Celtics win a championship in 2008. (Yet, to make me happy, at midnight tonight, the NBA is doing a lockout, so that&apos;s great news, i fucking hate how SportsCenter is 40 minutes of basketball highlights, 18 minutes of commercials, and 2 minutes of hockey highlights in the later parts of winter.) And now, in 2011, the Bruins are champs, the last team remaining that beat the dirty Canucks with their goon players and riot-causing fans. Tim Thomas transforms into a wall, shuts out the Canucks in that final Game 7, grows a great beard, hoists the Conn Smythe and the Stanley Cup in a matter of minutes, and a few days later, wins his second Vezina trophy for best goalie.

The Bruins played some of the most exciting hockey i have seen since the pre-trap days (thanks for ruining hockey for 15 years New Jersey Devils) when players were able to skate and tough players were able to make good hard hits. Prior to winning the Stanley Cup, they went through their rival the Montreal Candiens in a full 7-game series. Then they got revenge on the Philadelphia Flyers who knocked them out of the playoffs last year in the worst way possible. This time, a total ass kicking 4-game sweep and revenge for both last year and this year&apos;s Buffalo Sabres (you&apos;re welcome Emmy). Then another complete 7-game series against the Tampa Bay Lightning that won the Bruins the Eastern Conference Finals and got them into the Stanley Cup Finals.

My twitter account was updating like crazy with every highlight there was. All the goals scored, stupid penalty calls, lack of power play goals for the Bruins, the frustrion of Roberto Luongo on the road, and of course, the sickening injury to Nathan Horton. It was only after that disgusting and illegal hit that the Bruins scored a dozen goals in back to back home games, tied the series, caused Luongo to get pulled in game 6 back in Boston, and then Horton becoming the mascot for the Bruins, complete with literally bring Boston home ice back to Vancouver. It all worked, and the Bruins are the 2011 Stanley Cup Champions.

Chara, Krejci, Seidenberg, Lucic, Bergeron, Seguin, Peverly, Recchi, all played a crucial role at one point during the winning of the cup. One of my favorite stats of all time occured during the Stanley Cup Finals. The Vancouver Canucks, one of the best special teams unit in all of the NHL, completely sucked only scoring two power play goals. In the 7-game series against the Bruins, they actually gave up three short-handed goals. Meaning, when they had a man advantage, they gave up more goals than they scored. The Bruins were able to score three different times down a man against the Canucks. Do you know how crazy that is? To put it in perspective, in the entire 82-game regular season, the Canucks only allowed two short-handed goals. Then they gave up 3 in 7 games to the B&apos;s, including that beautiful dagger in the heart in Game 7, with Bergeron getting knocked down from behind and icing the game to make it 3-0 Bruins.

I continued to do my stupid pregame rituals during the entire playoff run. Eating pizza and hot dogs, not wearing pants, tweeting during the game, even started watcing inspirational episodes of &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;. In a matter of a two weeks, i went from never seening a single episode to now being up to Season 5, Episode 10. I will admit, at one point, i did get worried. You see, i always watch the game alone at my place. On the night the Bruins won it all, i had my brother Mike over (it&apos;s not my place to get into the reason he was over) but we both watched and it was nice to high five someone when the Bruins scored. I loved watching them all take a lap with the Cup when they won it all. Hell, i DVR&apos;d the entire game, plus 30 minutes of post game stuff like the players drinking out of the Cup. I even DVR&apos;d that nights &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and NESN &quot;Sports Desk&quot; and rewatched them all the next day.

A few days later, i was so happy to be at my parents house with my dad as we watched all two hours of the duck boat parade throughout Boston. Can you believe, more people showed up to watch the Bruins championship parade then even the 2004 Red Sox championship parade?

Hockey is the first sport i fell in love with. The Bruins became the first sports team i fell in love with. I&apos;ve waited a good amount of time to see a then win it all. Granted, not as long as though die hard Sox fans born around 1919, but for me, i had to wait almost 30 years to see my Bruins to win a Stanley Cup. They did it, i&apos;m so happy, and for those that didn&apos;t read all of Emmy&apos;s entry, please enjoy this video that will remind me forever of the greatness of June 2011, the month the Bruins won the Stanley Cup!

 ( 4 Comments | Comment on this ) Monday, June 13th, 2011 6:46 pm Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals 
 The Bruins are down 3 games to 2. But they&apos;re home. If they win tonight, they get to fly back to Vancouver for a Game 7 on Wednesday. I want the Bruins to win tonight. And i want them to win on Wednesday. I want to see my Boston Bruins win that Stanley Cup and parade it around all of Boston like the Red Sox, Celtics, and Patriots have done. The Bruins are the last local team to win a championship, going all the way back to the Bobby Orr days.

Believe it or not, win or lose, i&apos;m proud of this Bruins team. I&apos;ve had so much pleasure watching them play this season. They played with grit and heart, with young guns skating around, and experienced old guys showing veteran leadership. There&apos;s been great scoring, great passing, great defense, some of the hardest hits and best fights, and perhaps the greatest goalie season of all time with Tim Thomas. Every time the Bruins play well enough to make it to the playoffs, i just want them to advance to the next round.

In a best of 7, it took all 7 games to beat the Bruins&apos; biggest rival, the Montreal Candiens. In a rematch of last year, the Bruins took on the Philadelphia Flyers. Last season, Bruins were up three games to nothing, and the Flyers came back and knocked the Bruins off. That didn&apos;t happen at all this year. Bruins swept them in 4 straight.

Then it came time for the Tampa Bay Lightning. Great team, innovative coaching, and high goal scoring. It took a full 7 games to pull that off, and some of the most greatest saves to keep the Bruins alive by Thomas to win it. The Bruins were winners, and for the first time in almost twenty years, they got the chance to play for the Stanley Cup.

Of course, when you&apos;re good enough to make it to the Stanley Cup Finals, you&apos;re also playing against the best team in the NHL, and the Vancouver Canucks were that great. They had Luongo in net who is a Vezina finalist (just like Thomas), and they got the Sedin twins, and Kesler. They have the greatest fans (don&apos;t care how unAmerican it might sound, i get goosebumps listening to their home crowd sing &quot;Oh Canada&quot; in unison) and some of the fastests players on ice.

At this time, i was going to get into a rant about how dirty those Canucks were. How the cheap shot of a 3rd line Defenseman knocked out the Bruins first line forward. Or the biting incident that lead to a zero game suspicion. Or how they love to flop and overact every time they get bumped in hopes of drawing a power play. It&apos;s busch league hockey, and when it goes against the Bruins, it sucks. And when they overcome and fight fire with fire, that is when these Bruins come alive, as shown when scoring a dozen goals in two games on home ice.

Either way, it&apos;s a do or die game for the Bruins. I&apos;m just proud of all the entertainment this team has given me this year. If they don&apos;t win the Cup, it will sting, however, it gives me hope. Thomas is a wall. Horton will be healthy and playing next year. Chara will remain a giant and a Norris Trophy finalist. The young players like Marchand and Seguin can be with the Bruins for the next 15 years and stay great and fast players. Lucic, Krejci, Seidenberg, Peverly, and the penalty killing styles of Paille are a thing of pure hockey greatness. Yes, i want the Bruins to win tonight. And i want them to win the Cup on Wednesday. If they don&apos;t, this will not be the end of the world. This will just be a delay until they eventually do hoist the Cup in triumph with this core group of guys.

Just don&apos;t get knocked around on your own home ice. Remember...

 

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

I know my pregame superstitions are silly, it will all come down to who scores more goals in the game that determines the winner. We just like to watch it happen in our playoff beards. ( Comment on this ) Friday, May 27th, 2011 6:50 pm Game 7... Who wants to play for the Stanley Cup? 
 Tonight is a giant night for me. Boston Bruins vs. Tampa Bay Lightning in Game 7 action of the Eastern Finals. Whoever wins tonight will get to play against the Vancouver Canucks for the Stanley Cup.

As usual, i&apos;m home alone so i can properly tweet the action of tonight&apos;s game. I&apos;ve been doing this ever since the Bruins lost their first two games of the playoffs against the Canadiens while i watched at Mike&apos;s house. Well, no more of that. Here are my stupid playoff rituals:

(1) Home alone

(2) Constantly tweeting the actions of the game

(3) Pizza is my food of choice

(4) Only after eating two hot dogs

(5) Haven&apos;t shaved since the beginning of a new series

(6) Not wearing any pants

Now that all are creeped out by my disgusting viewing habits that are borderline unabomber status of psycho, please know i really want to see the Bruins win a Stanley Cup.

Hockey was the first sport i loved. Loved to play it, loved to watch it. It&apos;s total excitement of the best athletes going as fast as possible on a sheet of ice. Pucks are flying at over 100 mph, elbows are flying, players being checked hard into boards, teeth being knocked out, sticks causes fresh new stitches, it&apos;s all so beautiful.

Not since 1972 (when i was negative 9 years old) when Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito have the Bruins won a Stanley Cup. Not since 1990, (when i was about to turn 9) when Ray Bourque and Cam Neely actually played in the Stanley Cup finals. How sad is it that for over twenty years, the answer to the trivia question, &quot;Who was the last Boston Bruin to score a goal in the Stanley Cup Finals?&quot; has been fan favorite goon, Lydon Byers, aka, LB. This was what LB was known for:

 

You can just skip the first minute to go straight to the fighting

I so badly want the Bruins to win. I was so heart broken by how the playoffs ended last year. This year it&apos;s different. The Bruins are healthy. They&apos;re fast. Tim Thomas is playing on top of his head. As long as the Bruins don&apos;t make any stupid penalties (their special teams is just god awful) they can beat the Ligthning. They got the home crowd on their side. They win twice as many games after a loss. Krejci&apos;s line has been on fire lately. I think Chara is going to step up and one of his monster slap shots from the point will get tipped in for a goal. I think Roloson is bound to make a mental error and get pulled, like has happened multiple times this series. Shit, top shelf, glove side, there&apos;s always a giant hole there.

About 90 minutes away from dropping the puck. They just flashed the stats, the teams that wins the most faceoffs ends up winning the game. Well, the Tampa Bay refs are going to be kicking out Patrice Bergeron tonight at the faceoff circle. Faceoffs will be won, checks will be made, something special will happen tonight. It&apos;s the ultimate game, win, or start making golf plans, and we all know how much golf sucks.

Let&apos;s Go Bruins!

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

I&apos;ve been saying this for a while now. The team that wins the second period will win the game. So no matter what happens in the first, it&apos;s just a delay to the action in the second period. Win that period, you&apos;re 4 wins away from having your name placed on Lord Stanley&apos;s Cup, the ultimate prize in all of sports.

 ( Comment on this ) Sunday, May 8th, 2011 9:56 am Happy Mother&apos;s Day! 
 Normally, i would write 3,500 words about how great my mom is. Well, hyperbole is a little bit overrated these days, and besides, everyone that reads this knows how perfect my mom is.

So, this entry is just a reminder that my mom is awesome, and we should all be nice to the people that brought us into the world.

My mom is as perfect as the Bruins sweep of the Flyers. Wasn&apos;t that something else? The Bruins are now in the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since Spring 1992. Back then, i was only 10. It&apos;s been a long ass time for the chance for the Bruins to be at the halfway point between lifting the Stanley Cup. Let&apos;s Go Bruins, and let&apos;s go Moms!

My mom is as surprising as the news of the death of Osama Bin Laden. How fucking awesome is that? The biggest douchebag in the world is now death, currently being nibbled on by sharks and crapped on by lobsters.

My mom is too kind, because she doesn&apos;t want to root for the death of anyone, including Bin Laden. But, i&apos;m not my mom, i&apos;m happy this asshole is dead.

My mom is very entertaining, unlike the current movies being shown at the theaters. Since Jan. 1st, 2011, i&apos;ve gone to the movies 4 times, and only twice was it for movies actually released in this year. Can&apos;t wait for &quot;The Hangover 2&quot; to come out, it will be the first time i&apos;ve gone to the movies in months and really excited about seeing a movie.

The big plan for today is to go to my parents house where my mom prepares Easter Dinner 2.0 that she missed while still in Florida. I will bring some beer and Dt. Sierra Mist Free and then watch the afternoon Sox game with my mom.

I love you mom, you&apos;re the best.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

She does my taxes, gives me advice, allows me to do the laundry, doesn&apos;t point out my many flaws, and she&apos;s the best cook and the person i enjoy making her laugh the most. On this 2nd Sunday of May, Happy Mother&apos;s Day Mom! ( 3 Comments | Comment on this ) Saturday, April 23rd, 2011 1:10 am I have a gambling problem: A Brotherly Trip to Foxwoods 
 I hope everyone enjoyed their Good Friday. For the Catholics, its the day that Jesus died. For many, it&apos;s just a day off of work and the last day of Spring Break for the kids in school. As for me and my brothers Mike and John, it was a day to go to Foxwoods. While they did have the day off from work, i didn&apos;t. I had to request it off for my boss, but he kinda owed me after working 11 straight days because of the period close last week, forcing me to work a half a day on Patriots day, and with me promising to work on Saturday for a few hours.

John is back in Massachusetts with his family, which we&apos;ll see more of tomorrow at Paul&apos;s Family Gathering (which will be something i&apos;ll probably write about, but then get really lazy about, and then not update until the start of May), but this was just about Me, Mike and John hanging out, shooting the shit, having a few drinks, and wo can win a few bucks playing poker at Foxwoods.

We agreed to meet at Mike&apos;s before 9am, that way, we&apos;ll be able to get to Foxwoods before the 11am $200 Bounty tournament. A Bounty tournament works like a normal tournament, except when you personally knock someone out of the tournament, you are rewarding with actual $25 poker chips to be used in the casino. Knock out 4 people, it&apos;s like playing in a free tournament. But, sorta like that Black Friday tournament the three of us entered, Mike got knocked out first, then me, and instead of John going the distance and making some money, he also got knocked out. So, the three of us, thinking of major money and playing great poker all day, barely last a couple of hours before we&apos;re all eliminated. Instead of playing in another poker tournament at 1pm, i decide to walk around Foxwoods and play some table games.

THE GOOD TIMES
-------------------

I start playing at a table game called Crazy 4 Poker. Simple game, you&apos;re dealt five standard cards, but you make your best 4 card hand. So, 4 clubs and a heart is a flush, and 5-6-7-8-King is a straight. And there are little bonus payments depending on what you bet and what hand you have. Also, the dealer does the same, and you have to beat the dealer&apos;s hand to get paid on some of the bets. After playing maybe 20 minutes, i was dealt a 9-10-Jack-Queen, all clubs, for a straight flush. It basically won me $275 in bonus money.

Then, i left that game and sat at the Texas Hold&apos;Em Table Game. In this, you are given two cards, and bet, then you get to bet on the flop, turn, and river. But no matter what, it&apos;s your two cards and the five community cards, versus the dealer&apos;s two cards and the five community cards. Of course, there&apos;s a bonus bet for if you&apos;re dealt a pair, or something like Ace-face card. Well, i had a $25 chip on the bonus bet when i finally was dealt Ace-King. If it was suited, it would have paid off 25-1. But because it was offsuit, just 15-1 was my payout. But that is still $375. Then i basically cashed out and left.

I found John and Mike back at the poker tournament section of Foxwoods. They were both in the 1pm tournament. I told John the good news, that i was really up and i was happy. But for some reasons, didn&apos;t want to play poker. So i walked around, and did something stupid.

THE STUPID
----------------

I&apos;m always envious in my brother Paul&apos;s stories of winning while playing slot machines. His won in Vegas, at Foxwoods, at Mohegan. It&apos;s just putting money into a machine and seeing if the machine allows you to be chosen a winner or not. When i occasionally talk to Paul, he tells me of a new slot machine i just need to try. One time it was a &quot;Survivor&quot; themed slot machine, and this time it was an &quot;American Idol&quot; slot machine. I don&apos;t know why i wasted my time on these machines. I don&apos;t watch or care about the actual show it&apos;s based on, but there i was, putting in a crisp $100 bill into this slot machine. And roughly 15 minutes later, my $100 bill is showing zero credits.

Then i played at a semi favorite slot machine, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. The thing i like about this one, is if you hit a SPIN-SPIN-SPIN, the money wheel from &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; starts spinning about your slot machine. And whatever amount it lands on, it goes straight to you. It&apos;s very tempting, because there is that $1,000 spot. But it normally lands on $40, or $75, but sometimes it hits $150 and you&apos;re very happy.

That didn&apos;t happen at all. I ended up dropping $200 on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and only got to spin once, and it only landed on the $20 spot. I couldn&apos;t believe it. I was up some money, and even when you factor in the $200 i lost playing in the tournament, i was still up. Then i feed several slot machines $300 and got nothing. Very frustrating.

If we had left, at this point, i probably would have broken even for the day. But Mike and John were still playing poker, so i just walked around the casino feeling like an idiot. Ate at El Pollo Loco, felt mildly better, and then proceded to lose another $100 playing blackjack, and then another $100 at that Texas Hold&apos;Em table game.

FINDING MIKE AND JOHN
-------------------------------

As i was losing money on slot machines, and tables games, and walking around and eating alone, John and Mike were looking for me. By this time, both had been knocked out from the 1pm poker tournament. I was able to find Mike playing Three Card Poker, while i was losing a few bucks again at that Texas Hold&apos;Em game. John found us, and told us we were stupid. We&apos;re poker players, we should be downstairs playing $1-$2 no limit poker. Well, this halfassed pep talk got me to get up from my table game and go with John to the poker room to play some 1-2. We were lucky to get seated at a table (there is normally a crazy list, especially on a Friday) and just before we started playing, John &quot;borrows&quot; $50 from me. I&apos;m about to sit at a table with about $140 in chips, but John just takes two of my green $25 chips from me so he can have some money to use at his table. I put up a noble effort, but after one hour, i lose my money.

I find John on the other side of the poker room, and he easily has $400 in chips. He&apos;s kicking ass. I tell him i got knocked out, and remind him he owes me $50. But that&apos;s only after he bums another two bucks off me to properly tip a waitress. Oh, John and Mike drank pretty heavily, while i was kinda sober. However, that really doesn&apos;t pop up anymore in this story, so it&apos;s not totally important. I am back home safe and sound, no one drove home drunk.

I&apos;m unhappy at this moment. About two hours ago, i was up, lots of profit, and happily would have gone home. After all, unlike these guys, i have to work tomorrow. And now, i basically pissed away all my profits and then some, while John is making money with some of my start-up capital, and here comes Mike into the poker room, after he just hit a straight flush playing three card poker. He won either $300 or $400 on that one single hand. Lucky bastard is all i could think. So i walk away and do something even dumber.

THE REALLY FUCKING STUPID
-------------------------------

I go back upstairs to the casino, and try the Wheel of Fortune slot machine yet again, and lose another hundred dollar bill. Fuck whatever profits i might have had, that&apos;s long gone. Hell, the $250 i had left over after paying into the Bounty Tournament to start at Foxwoods is now down to just $120. Which i lose it all on in three hands of anothe table game.

John&apos;s got money and is crushing it in the poker room. Mike hit a big three card poker table bonus bet and is happily playing cards now. And me? I&apos;m alone, and broke. The really fucking stupid thing i do is walk over to an ATM machine, and withdraw $300. Really, really fucking stupid.

I do this for two reasons. I still wanted to gamble (after all, i&apos;m an Andrews and i have a gambling problem) and also because Mike and John still think i&apos;m up some money. They aren&apos;t aware of me pissing away my winnings on slot machines and the table games. They think i won about $500 early playing table games, and lost $100 playing $1-2 hold&apos;em in the poker room.

Still, the really fucking stupid is done. I have $300 from a casino ATM (amazing, only a $4 charge to do this) and i&apos;m about to gamble yet again. What&apos;s my poison of choice? Oh yes, because i&apos;m a fucking idiot, i go back to try my luck at another slot machine. But not just any slot machine, because once again, i&apos;m a fucking idiot. No, i go to...

THE FIVE DOLLAR SLOT MACHINE
-----------------------------------

Wow, that first one hundred dollar bill came and went pretty quickly. And same with that second one hundred dollar bill. Fuck me, less than 10 minutes after taking out $300 from a casino slot machine, i&apos;m only down to one remaining Ben Franklin. Instead of using the same slot machine that ate my first two hundreds, i moved around and tried another machine. It looked promising, because like the wheel of fortune slots, this also had a cash wheel. And if you were able to make this thing spin, whatever dollar amount it landed on went straight to you.

You could do a max bet of 3 credits on this machine. But at $5 a credits, it means every pull of the slot machine is costing me $15. And finally, the law of averages kicks into gear. My machine hit a SPIN, and my money whell started moving. It landed on $150. I tried to do another max bet to play again, but it wouldn&apos;t do it. I looked at the machine, and only one &quot;SPIN&quot; was on the machine, execpt it was a &quot;3xSPIN&quot;. I had two more spins to go. So i clicked the money wheel spin button, and it hit for $225. Than again for $125. As i&apos;m thinking, shit, of course, it will take the smallest amount, it doesn&apos;t. It adds all of the spins up and throws them into my credits. Before i knew it, i went from my original 20 credits ($5 a credit times 20 credits = $100) into 155 credits. Then i played until i only had 140 credits, and clicked a cash out button.

Slot machines are designed now so that instead of a shitload of quarters, it just adds all of your credits, you hit &quot;print ticket&quot;, and a receipt spits out with the cash equivalent of your credits. That was how i had a $700 ticket from playing at a $5 slot machine.

Holy shit, $700. When you factor what i brought to the casino in the morning, and what i took out of the ATM, i&apos;m practically back to even. But i&apos;m also an idiot with a gambling problem.

ANOTHER FIVE DOLLAR SLOT MACHINE
---------------------------------------

I was able to find the ticket redemption machines. You just stick the ticket in, and out comes money (the maximum it spits out is $1200). I decide now that i have seven fresh hundred dollar bills, i&apos;ll put $600 into my wallet, and use this last hundred dollar bill again on the $5 slot machine. The slot machine i was using was apart of a 6 slot machine cluster. I went back to this cluster, and decided to try a different machine. Same game, just a different machine. Well, it took less than 5 minutes for the same damn thing to happen to me. I hit a &quot;3xSPIN&quot;, spun the money wheel three times, had a shitload of credits, printed out a ticket, and once again, it was for $700.

I&apos;m now officially in the red. This is profit. And it worked so well before...

THE CRAZY WINNING STREAK
---------------------------------

I did the same damn thing again. Put $600 into my wallet, left a hundred bucks to be used for a different machine, and tried it again. I wasn&apos;t as lucky as before. This time, when i hit enough credits and wanted to cash out, i printed out a ticket that only said $350.

So, back to ticket redemption, put $250 into my wallet, leave hundred bucks out to play at a different machine. Finally, this time, my hundred came and went. Didn&apos;t win anything. It sucked, everything was going well, and now, this money train came to a stop. Well, fuck that i said to myself as i&apos;m the world&apos;s biggest fucking idiot with a gigantic gambling problem. I stuck another hundred dollar bill into the machine. This time, i printed out a ticket that said $650.

Went back to ticket redemption, put $550 into my wallet, and played with the hundred dollar bill at another machine. By this time, the word had gotten around, others were playing at this cluster of $5 slot machines. No bullshit, a lady was playing and she had over 300 credits going on this one machine. That meant she had $1,500 that could be awarded to her if she wanted it.

As for me, i put my hundred dollar bill in, and it didn&apos;t work. Went through it, no spins, not much of anything, just lost the hundred dollar bill. It was the dumbest, craziest, luckiest and ballsiest thing i ever did at a casino. I had put money into a five dollar slot machine, and actually won money.

SPREADING THE GOOD NEWS
-----------------------------

Without a doubt, winning money is great at a casino. But lets face it, another perk is telling others how you did something so painfully fucking dumb, and it worked in your favor. I go back down to the poker room, and i tell John the good news. He&apos;s amazed. I tell both Mike and John that the gas money is on me, which just meant that the $50 that John borrowed from me, he can give to Mike as he was the one who drove us down to Foxwoods.

However, as amazed as they are that i did this, i don&apos;t mention that i first lost everything i had won previously, hit an ATM, went down to my final bill, then started to win money. Both Mike and John were playing well at $1-$2 no limit, so i leave them be and go back upstairs to kill some time.

I couldn&apos;t resist, and insert another $100 into the $5 slot machine that is now empty of players. Hopefully that lady took my advice and cashed out. It would be so sad if she played her credits down to nothing. Because that&apos;s what i did when i put in my hundred, my 20 credits went down to nothing pretty quickly. OK, no more luck here, i&apos;m officially done playing at the $5 slot machines. But remember, i&apos;m a fucking idiot with a gambling problem.

HOW DO YOU PLAY CRAPS?
------------------------------

I decide to take advantage of the fact that the table games, which on a Friday night would be jammed full of players and have $25 minimum bets everywhere, were kinda empty and still doing $5 minumum bets. So i play that Crazy 4 Poker game. Just lay down a hundred, see what happens. Well, nothing really crazy happens either way, i lose twenty bucks after half an hour.

I get up, and walk around. Thinking about seeing Mike and John and talk them into going back home. But, i notice the craps table, you know, the game with the dice. There was only 4 people playing, and the minumum bet was $5. So, i take my $80 in chips and see what happens.

I don&apos;t know how to play craps, so i ask this guy who&apos;s doing really well how to bet. He tells me about the pass line and putting money on a few numbers, and as i&apos;m watching, he keeps winning money. And the guy with the dice, well, he doesn&apos;t crap out at all.

I bet very conservatively, but basically, the man with the dice was on fire. We were betting everything. I started a $5 pass line bet with $10 behind, and eventually had $15 pass, with $100 behind. And making money.

A lot of money.

CRAZY, SHIT TON, HOLY FUCKING A, THEY CAN COMP US A ROOM MONEY.

Well, they didn&apos;t comp us shit. But, they guy who taught me a thing or two, he cashed out for over $2,000. And me, who started with about $80, once that one guy who was rolling the dice the entire time (i never once rolled the dice, and i never place a bet on anyone else rolling the dice), once he crapped out, i also cashed out, and my $80 turned into $848.

I killed a half hour playing craps and having a blast and making some nice money. Then killed another half hour as i waited for the guy with over $2,000 in chips to color up. He did a dick move and just put his chips all over the place. No seperation for the colors, they were everywhere. So, it took the dealer forever to count them up. Only after he was done did he color me up.

I was finished. No more betting. After all, i&apos;m not a total fucking idiot, and i really don&apos;t have a gambling problem, i just have a losing problem.

FINDING MIKE AND JOHN AGAIN
---------------------------------

They couldn&apos;t believe i just won ten times my money playing craps. But, that was the truth. Mike was clearly up a lot of money at the $1-2 game. When i told him my good news, it got him motivated to cash out and leave with some profit. John was also doing well, and still didn&apos;t give me the fifty bucks he had borrowed. We all took a breather, realized it was late, me and Mike had some food, we got John&apos;s friend to drive him back home, and me and Mike went back to Leominster together. Before we left, we said bye to John (who wdidn&apos;t have those chips anymore, and it was becoming very clear i wouldn&apos;t see that fifty bucks again tonight.) and his friend.

The Celtics were winning, but i didn&apos;t care. Hell, my Bruins won in the most crazy playoff game eve and i missed every goal because they sucked when i watched them, and played perfect hockey when i wasn&apos;t watching. And as of this writing, in California, the Sox are up 4-2 in the 8th inning as it&apos;s a little past 1:00am on the east coast.

I sit alone in my house, hoping others will enjoy my story of crazy gambling with my brothers at Foxwoods. My wallet is about the size of George Constanza&apos;s, and i have the next 4 months worth of rent in it. Most likely, i&apos;ll put most of it back into the bank and set aside the next few weeks for rent. But, these are good problems to have.

We arrived at Foxwoods hoping to win a poker tournament. I sucked so much at poker it wasn&apos;t funny, but it lead to the craziest ups and downs i&apos;ll ever have gambling. It&apos;s late, but i&apos;m so amped up, not tired at all.

I thank you if you&apos;ve made it this far and read this entire entry. It&apos;s nice to have have a good story about winning and coming up on top. After all, that is the true meaning of Good Friday.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

I think i have a gambling problem that is properly cured due to the long drive to and from Foxwoods. ( 1 Comment | Comment on this ) Sunday, April 10th, 2011 11:03 am I Came, I Saw, I Got 4th Place 
 I will do my best to make this a very short and sweet entry. But i had myself a pretty good Saturday. It all begin a few days ago when Mike&apos;s birthday present, tickets to the last regular home Bruins game came in. Originally, the tickets were for Mike and Becca, but she had to work instead, so Mike brought me. They were great seats, the 3rd row in the green premium section. We got to cut through the main line, check out the mini hall of fame, and because it was all free to me, i was the designated driver while Mike did his best to empty the keg of Heniken. It was nice to have a waitress to take your orders so you didn&apos;t miss the game. And plush and comfy chairs too. My fat ass sat in with no problems whatsoever. We had seats near the face-off circles, and the Bruins were able to win 3-1. Tim Thomas was in net and played out of his mind. I think he set a new record in save percentage for this season. There was only one fight, and Horton of the Bruins won that. It was also fan apprecation night, where the Bruins players literally take their game jerseys off their back and give them to fans. We didn&apos;t win a sweaty jersey, but it&apos;s such a cool gesture. And even though at the same time in a different part of Boston, the Red Sox were losing to the Yankees, we were able to drive in, park, and leave with no jam up issues.

The game went from about 1:15-3:45, and me and Mike didn&apos;t get back to Leominster until about 5:30. I wasn&apos;t even able to go back to my place and unwind or even get my normal poker hat. Had to wear my $5 Yellow Bruins hat, because at 5:30, i had to be at Forty&apos;s to play in the finals.

Some background on this Forty&apos;s tournament in case you don&apos;t know. Forty&apos;s was doing a 5-week tournament that would allow at the end two different finals, one for the better players winning one of 5 HDTV, and one for the losers winning only 1 HDTV. I thought i could play well enough to be in the winners tournament, and sure enough, i was ranked 12th. Forty&apos;s takes the top twenty players on Sunday and the top twenty players on Wednesday, and those forty players played yesterday in one last tournament. The top 5 would win an HDTV, 1st and 2nd would get a 3D-HDTV, and 3rd-5th would get various 42&quot; HDTV&apos;s. I already have a nice plasma HDTV that i love, so i wanted to win this for my parents.

A quick tangent on the greatness of my parents. They&apos;ve done everything for me. Hell, it was only a few weeks ago they provided me a place to stay in Florida, constantly driving me around, to and from the airport. To and from the Adam Carolla show. To and from restaurants. My mom did the proper work to get all those Spring Training game tickets so i could watch and enjoy. Hell, she even did my taxes. I still go back home to do my laundry because they got the washing machine and dryer and don&apos;t mind me using it. My car that i still have (my piece of shit Saturn), i only have because it was my mom&apos;s and she gave it to me. In all the almost thirty years i&apos;ve been around, all i&apos;ve done was taken from my parents, and they never vocally said anything about me being the deadbeat son i most likely am. That being said, i always wanted to do something nice for my parents, like welcoming them into the 21st century with an HDTV. Hell, i don&apos;t own a cell phone, and my car doesn&apos;t have power windows, but even i have an HDTV. It&apos;s a giant sin that my parents don&apos;t have a High-Def televsion of their own. They need to know the great experience of watching television in HD. And i wanted to help.

Also, for selfish reasons, i never want to be at their place on Thanksgiving and watch a football game NOT in high-def ever again.

So, during the season, i played well enough to get in the top twenty of Wednesday players (oh, and i should mention, that one week i was in Florida, Mike substituted for me and played in my place. Although he got dead last and scored the least amount of points possible, he still got me points instead of a score of zero, and i didn&apos;t have to make it up by playing on a Sunday, which would have meant missing a Simpsons episode. No way in hell. So Mike, you&apos;re apart of this winning story and i wanted the parents to be aware of this) and yesterday, i played well enough also to have a good amount of chips. I was never a major chip leader, i just didn&apos;t make in stupid mistakes. One hand, i bluffed my way into a big pot, and kept betting at it until the other guy folder and i won a giant pot. Another time, i guy went all-in, it made no sense based on the cards out there and how he was betting. I called him, and i had him beat. Those two hands really propelled me into the final table with a lot of chips.

When we got to the final table, i basically folded every hand i had. Mostly because i was dealt crap, but also because half the table were short stacked to begin with. No reason to do something dumb and lose a lot of chips when i can just wait and grind it out, and these people would be gone due to the large blinds. And that&apos;s exactly what happened. 9 playerd left, than 8, 7, and then 6. We had one more poor bastard that would be bubble boy to make the final 5 players, and then everyone would be guarenteed a TV. And i had a shitload of chips but no cards, so i just waited. Finally, a shortstacked guy made his move, and lost. 5 players remained, and i had just won a TV.

Now, ideally, i would have gotten first overall, and won a 50&quot; 3D-HDTV, sold it back to Forty&apos;s, used the money to buy my parents a 42&quot; plasma like i have, and pocketed the rest of the cash. Instead, i only got 4th place, where i made my move, i was a slight favorite, but in the end, the other guy caught his flush and i got knocked out. But no biggie at all. I had won my parents a brand new, LG 42&quot; LCD HDTV, in 1080p. Here&apos;s the link to check it out.

 http://www.lg.com/us/tv-audio-video/tel evisions/LG-lcd-tv-42LD450.jsp 

So, that&apos;s my story. In my kitchen is the actual television, just waiting for my parents to come back home from Florida so they can take it out of the box and view the greatness of HDTV in their own home. Oh, and that is them calling my right now. Last night, i played from about 5:30pm-1:00am to win this TV for my parents. I played smart, didn&apos;t do anything dumb, used the full bladder statagy (trust me, it works, hard to explain right now) and i just so damn happy. My parents are happy. Everyone should be happy, so mom and dad, this HDTV is for you. Thanks so much for everything you&apos;ve done for me. I hope you guys appreciate this.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

I&apos;m sorry for calling at 1:00am about the good news, no one was murdered and no houses were lost in a fire. I won a HDTV for you guys. ( 3 Comments | Comment on this ) Tuesday, April 5th, 2011 7:16 pm Worst Flight Ever, the end of the Florida Saga 
 CURRENT NEWS
------------------------

I so apologize for the giant delay with the ending of my last days in Florida story. Basically, it&apos;s been a difficult time for me with a few headaches here and there. One of the biggest pains in my ass was the fact that my car was due for the Massachusetts state inspection, but when i tried to get it done, the guy working there said my car would failed instantly, my exhaust was leaking. I was dealt with the choice of either paying for a brand new exhaust, or looking into getting a used car. I spent several hours looking at craigslist for used cars to purchase. I went to a couple of used car lots and test drove a couple of cars. But nothing felt right, and the cheapest car available was still going to be three times more then me getting my exhaust fixed. It was probably good that i toyed with the idea of getting a used car, thinking for the future of my car (it&apos;s got 189,000 miles on it), but it wasn&apos;t practical to just get a new car because the timeline for the state inspection was running out. Illegally i drove for a couple of days, but got my regular mechanic back in Townsend to fix my car. Yesterday, brought to the state inspection, and i passed. My Saturn is good to go until the last day of April 2012. As an added bonus, because my car is now 15 years old, it doesn&apos;t even have to deal with the emmissions part of the state inspection test.

In sports, the Sox got the shit kicked out of them as they started out 0-3. However, tonight they play the Indians in a brand new series, and maybe something good will happen. The Bruins had a 3-0 lead over the Rangers last night, then ended up losing 5-3. Thankfully, they&apos;re already in the playoffs, which will start in about two weeks. It&apos;s setting up to look like the Bruins will face off with the Canadians in the first round. Hate those fucking canucks. And to finish off, although no official word has been made, i played good enough that i should be in the finals in my poker tournament to be one of five people trying to win a brand new HDTV. If i play well enough, the tv will go to the parents. And if i win the whole damn thing, i&apos;ll take the money value and buy my parents a plasma like i have, because the grand prize is a 50 inch 3D-HDTV. No one needs that.

In movie news, fucking nothing. OK, so i saw &quot;Rango&quot; and i give it about 3 stars, big deal. 3 full months have gone bye, and not a single &quot;must-see&quot; movie exists. Normally, i would have seen about 15 movies by now, but i&apos;m going to hold off. If something only looks good and not great, and the storyline isn&apos;t unique enough to grab my entire, then screw it, i&apos;m going to save my money and stay home. Here i got Netflix, which i used all of Sunday to rewatch season two of &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. What a great show, and a perfect way to use Netflix when there&apos;s nothing on and your baseball team can&apos;t seem to play like they want to win.

LAST SPRING TRAINING GAME
------------------------------------

Second to last day i was in Florida, i used that day to watch a third spring training baseball game. The Florida Marlins vs. the Washington Nationals. I was excited because the Nationals are an NL team, but in 5 years, they are really going to be one of the best teams in the entire MLB. They have this one pitcher, Stephen Strasburg who can be the next Roger Clemmens. (I meant that in a good way, i hope he won&apos;t be a giant douche like The Rocket actually is) Plus the Nats have this year&apos;s first overall draft pick, a home run hitting guy named Bryce Harper who can be the next A-Rod (once again, meant in a good way, not the steriods using, totally douchebag yankkee way). Although Strasburg didn&apos;t pitch, i did get to watch Harper do some batting practice. He was knocking out of the park, hitting the ball really hard, and he wasn&apos;t even pulling the ball. Just smacking all over the park. He&apos;s only 18, and he&apos;ll do a couple of years in the minors. But he is going to be the next big thing, and i&apos;m glad i got to see him hit.

I don&apos;t remember who actually won the game, except one team gave up atleast 5 runs in one inning to end it for their team, and there was the long ball in the 8th inning. I only bring up these weird stats because in all three of the spring training games i went to, that happened. Homer in the 8th, and a 5-run inning that ended the game right there.

It was such a difference from the Sox-Cards game from the other day. In a ballpark that held 8,000, 7,983 people were at the Sox-Cards game. For this Marlins-Nats game, 2,800 people showed up. What a difference when no one cares about these teams that are very young and loaded with talent. Once again, these two teams are going to be some of the best contenders in the National League for the middle part of this decade.

Great weather again, i hung out with my dad and Uncle Tom again. It was very relaxing, a nice breeze, warm and sunny day, it beat the hell out of the idea of that later stages of winter in New England. FYI, it freaking snowed last week. When i talk to my parents, they talk about how it&apos;s sunny and 90 degrees and how the have the AC running when they&apos;re done swimming. And around here, it snowed about 5 inches. Granted, it&apos;s all gone now, but still. Florida during the winter is some of the best weather in the world.

FLORIDA RECAP
------------------------

Later on that day, i was finally able to finish my Saturday Night Live book (so goddamn good) and my parents took me out to their favorite restaurant Duffy&apos;s. It&apos;s basically a sports bar restaurant, like a 99. Good menu, and all the tv&apos;s have any regional sporting event you could want. We went that night to watch the Red Sox game on NESN, and enjoyed 5 innings of good Red Sox baseball (once again, they played so well during my time in Florida, not like how they played in Texas. Spring training is over, these games now count, stop playing like shit.)

It was my last night in Florida, and overall, it was a great vacation. No work, great weather, the chance to see my parents for a week, seeing and talking to my aunt and uncle, and also my Grampy, seeing three spring training games, having both home cooked meals and going out to restaurants, and the extra cool Saturday Night when i saw Adam Carolla do his standup. That was a vacation. And the flight only cost me $150 roundtrip.

FUCK DIRECTAIR
-------------------------

Next time, i&apos;ll gladly pay more for a roundtrip flight then ever go through DirectAir.

Shit, next time, i&apos;ll pay $500 roundtrip with alQaedaAir before i fly with DirectAir ever again.

For a quick reminder, my original flight from Worcester Mass to West Palm Beach Florida was for 7:00pm leaving Worcester, and arriving at 10:00pm in Florida. Instead, my flight was delayed two+ hours, and i didn&apos;t arrive in Florida until almost 1:00am. Not only that, i also managed to lose my prescription sunglasses somewhere on the flight. It sucked. But that flight was a first class trip with champagne flowing and a hot blonde flight attendent getting me into the mile high club compared to my flight back.

The flight itself started off nice. Parents dropped me at the airport and had a friendly yet tearful goodbye hug from my mom. Checked the lost and found yet again in case my prescription sunglasses were there, but no luck. Always can recheck the Worcester airport&apos;s lost and found. Was able to get through security without wasting time. Was able to start a new book. My flight wasn&apos;t delayed, and the rumor was no bad weather back in Worcester. I had called my brother Mike up as i was boarding the plane to tell him everything was good and i should be arriving at 6:45pm in Worcester. Just wanted to give him the heads up that everything was fine so far on my end.

I get to my seat, and instead of crushing someone, it wasn&apos;t a sold out flight, so i actually had my own row to myself. I relaxed, stretched out, and read my book (a too hard to explain book from Cracked.com, but very entertaining) while i prepared to fly three hours. I couldn&apos;t wait to get back home, sleep in my normal bed, catch up on my DVR, and then get ready for going back to Pepsi the next day. My flight was on a Thursday, and my vacation did go from Thursday-Thursday, but i was set to be back at work on Friday morning. I thought it would give me an extra day to try to reorginize myself back to normal. Without getting into it again, it took almost two weeks to fix all the things they did wrong while i was gone on vacation. They&apos;ll never fire me from Pepsi, they&apos;d be screwed without me.

THE SHIT BEGINS
----------------------

Finally, it&apos;s been 2 1/2 hours, and we&apos;re starting our descent. I put my book away and embrace landing back in Massachusetts. As i&apos;m looking out my window, i&apos;m trying to view the outside to see how far away we were from landing, but i couldn&apos;t see much. There was a very thick fog going on. But, i don&apos;t worry, i could feel we were less than 1,000 feet away from ground. Then i felt the worst situation i could feel on the plane, the feeling of the plane all of a sudden going nose up back into the sky instead of descending all the way and landing. Seeing we didn&apos;t crash or anything, my thought is the pilot somehow missed the strip or was told to take hold off from landing and reapproach again. But we weren&apos;t turning around into a giant circle and relanding, we were just going straight back into the night sky.

The pilot finally get&apos;s on the PA, and announces, &quot;Uhhh, we&apos;re being redirected to land in Hartford due to dense fog in Worcester. Sorry folks, but Mother Nature is preventing me from landing here&quot;. Can you believe this fucker is blaming Nature for his inabilty to land a fucking plane in fog? (By the way, although i can write without swearing, you are about to read some colorful language. Tough shit, i was fucking pissed). We would fly for another 30 minutes or so and land in Brandly International Airport outside of Hartford Connecticut. I look at my watch, and it was almost 6:45, about the time i was going to meet Mike at Worcester Airport. Of course, by whatever bullshit FAA rules that do exist, you can&apos;t use your cellphone to call anyone when the plane is actually flying. So, at this exact moment, my brother Mike is waiting for me in his car in Worcester, and i&apos;m about 100 miles away flying towards western Connecticut without the ability to tell Mike what was happening.

The pilot doesn&apos;t even attempt to try to reland at Worcester. The idea never occurs to him. It&apos;s just straight to a different airport, 100 miles away, in a different state. The pilot does inform us that those who happen to live in the Connecticut area can have people drive over and pick them up. Those that need to go back to Worcester, DirectAir will get us a bus to bring us back to Worcester airport. This was said around 7:00pm. The plane was now starting to descend. We&apos;re all just waiting for the plane to land to call all of our rides what the situation is and to inform them of the delay.

WRONG AIRPORT, WRONG STATE
-------------------------------

Finally, around 7:30 or so, the plane lands. And we all call our people. I call Mike and i could tell he was a little pissed. I informed him of the bus that was going to get us. I told him no matter what, there was going to be a delay, and as of now, i was stuck in the plane at this airport. What i should have done was told Mike to start driving straight to the airport in Hartford. There was three options. Mike could wait at the Worcester Airport. He could drive down to Hartford and pick me up, or he could just go home for now and wait for further information from me. Mike didn&apos;t know how to get to the Hartford airport, and he wasn&apos;t just going to wait in Worcester for several hours, so he went home. It was the most logical decision to make, but also the worst.

Even for those who happened to have family in the Hartford area, those that were willing to get picked up by friends or family, they were stucked on that plane just like me. They did a headcount of those wanting to take a bus back to Worcester (i was going to be on that bus) but nothing really could be done. The airport allowed us to land, but that was it. We couldn&apos;t taxi anywhere. We couldn&apos;t exit off the plane until a terminal was available (and we had to wait last in line), and even if the weather got better and the asshole of a pilot found the balls to land the plane in Worcester like he was supposed to do, we weren&apos;t giving any OK to just leave and fly away. We were all just stuck in this fucking plane on an airport runway. For a full hour and a half.

OFF THE PLANE
------------------

They allow the airplane to finally get hooked up to a terminal and we&apos;re allowed to get off the plane. I call Mike and tell him the good news. I&apos;m now off the plane. We&apos;re waiting for the luggage so we can collect it and then gather on a bus to drive back to Worcester. At this point, i felt like the majority of &quot;Planes, Trains, and Automobiles&quot;, except it wasn&apos;t Thanksgiving. It was now 9:00pm. I also use this time to call my parents and give them the heads up of what my status is like. They wanted me to call them the moment i get back to my place. Well, there were probably expecting a call from my Leominster house around 7:30 or so, and instead, it was 9:00 and i was calling from my cell phone in this shitty airport in Connecticut.

It took another half hour, but we all got our luggage. Those that made arrangements and lived nearby left. The rest of us just waited around. We&apos;re all waiting to here from some sort of DirectAir representative to tell us when the bus is coming, or for a giant bus to just come and for us to load up in it. Still, nothing is happening. We&apos;re all just waiting.

THE BULLSHIT HITS THE FAN
--------------------------------

Eventually, a woman comes along. She stands up and gathers our attention. &quot;DirectAir was to send a bus from Worcester Airport, filled with all the passengers on the night flight from Worcester to Florida on the bus. That bus would drive out to Connecticut, unload, and those passengers would take this plane in Connecticut back to Florida. When they were off the bus, we would get on the bus, and drive back to Worcester Airport. However, for some odd reason, in order for this to occur, the bus would have to go to Logan airport first instead of directly from Worcester to Hartford. And by that time the bus went to Logan and then to Hartford, too much time would have gone by that it would be illegal due to union rules for the flight cred to fly off again. Because of this, the flight itself has been cancelled and the crew would spend the night in Hartford. During this thought process, DirectAir forgot about the passengers currently stuck in Hartford. There will be no bus coming to pick us up. We have to make other arrangements, or stay the night and a bus will be provided in the morning, or we could fly back to Worcester tomorrow morning.&quot; The woman apologized and mentioned that she was in no way apart of DirectAir, she was just speaking on there behalf because she worked at this airport in Hartford.

I was in a daze. Slightly jet lagged, and very annoyed, i couldn&apos;t believe everything i just heard. I had to go back to the woman and make sure i heard everything correctly. I mean, where the fuck is the bus that we were promised to take us back to Worcester? What the fuck is going on? &quot;Who do i have to fucking kill to get the hell out of this fucking airport!&quot; It was at this moment i wasn&apos;t exactly thinking to myself, i was speaking to all those that could hear me, in an airport, and it was still the after 9/11.

I FUCKED UP
-------------------

In all my 29+ years alive, i&apos;ve never hand an encounter with a police officer in a negative way. Yeah, i&apos;ve been pulled over once or twice, but overall, i don&apos;t mess with the police, and they don&apos;t mess with me. That has been my entire relationship with the police. There really were there to serve and protect me. All those time i&apos;ve heard stories about a bigtime, asshole police officer, i never fully believed it. But when you accidentally mention the word &quot;kill&quot; inside of an airport, you quickly meet the worst fucking asshole, dickhead cop in the entire world. Fuck Riggs, John McClane, and Dirty Harry, this psycho cop was head and shoulders above those fake cops in terms of Fucking Asshole Cop!

&quot;Sir!&quot; the Fucking Asshole Cop (or FAC from now on) loudly proclaimed as he and his partner grabbed me and moved me away from the crowd. I remember looking into his eyes; he looked like a younger version of the drill sergrent from Kubrick&apos;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;. He was none too happy about my use of the word &quot;kill&quot; and had has hand resting on the taser in his back pocket in case i needed to be constrained. Whether intentional or not, FAC was the bad cop while his partner was the automatic good cop in there interaction with me. &quot;Show me some ID now!&quot;

I opened my wallet and showed my license to the FAC. &quot;Sir, remove your ID from your wallet and hand it to me before i have to restrain you!&quot; At this point i wondered why even have the clear part in your wallet for others to view at your driver&apos;s license when everyone wants you to fully take it out of your wallet. But while i was wondering that, i was also wondering should i or should i not make eye contact, did i crack a smile, and did i piss myself?

FAC was going to do a background check, and now wasn&apos;t the time for me to make jokes about where&apos;s the general direction to Mecca, i think it&apos;s time for me to pray. Good cop was telling me i did a stupid thing and to relax. I told the good cop that i&apos;ve just been kidnapped by this airline and they promised transportation for us, but instead didn&apos;t. And now, it was looking like i might have to stay overnight in this airport instead of being back home. The good cop said would you like to stay overnight in jail? I said if it got me closer to Worcester, fine.

FAC came back into the picture. Obviously all the drug dealings, grand theft autos, 3 homicadal stabbings, and that time i raped all those kids didn&apos;t show up on FAC background check. He then mentioned it was illegal for me to swear in public. That he was a state officer, and me being out of state, he would have fined me to the max just because FAC stood for Fucking Asshole Cop, and that if someone in the airport felt threatened that i said the word &quot;kill&quot;, he would have taken me down with his taser. What was most likely 2 minutes of the worst time of my life felt like three hours because when your heart stops for only a couple of minutes, who knows how long time is going on for.

Eventually my ID is handed back to me, FAC gives me more idle threats of if i act up and blah, blah, blah. Yes, i get it, you have the world&apos;s smallest penis and your wife goes around fucking the other cops in this state. So you take out all your frustration in angst on someone like me who isn&apos;t even supposed to be in this fucking state because the fucking airline can&apos;t land in the fucking right airport because of the fucking fog! Now, take your head out of your ass and go fuck yourself you fucking asshole cop! (obviously, this i kept to myself because they don&apos;t like that kind of language at the airport)

NOT ARRESTED, STILL IN HARTFORD
-------------------------------------

Being put on the no fly list isn&apos;t all that bad if it means never having to fly DirectAir ever again. It was the cheapest deal for a reason, they&apos;ll only get 90% of the way back. But only after you spent half a day in delays.

During my brief time as Hartford&apos;s number one suspect in everything 9/11 related, i relaxed myself, and called my brother Mike back. Told him the news about the fucking asshole cop, and then about how he needs to mapquest his ass to this airport and pick me up. The longer i stay here, the better the chance FAC changes his mind and locks me away. It was best for me just to find a seat, stay quiet, and wait. And wait i did.

Mike couldn&apos;t leave right away. He let the babysitter go, and had to wait for Becca to come back before he could drive all the way out to Hartford to pick me up. Eventually, i called him, this time, it was about 10:00pm, and he was finally leaving to pick me up.

At the airport, i finished my book, but really, i couldn&apos;t enjoy it all that much. Everyone who was on the plane who was just as screwed as i was had already left. Perhaps they just didn&apos;t want to be near the guy that was being questioned by the police for disliking the airline industry.

In this time, the parents had came back to their place in Florida and i had left them about three messages about all the shit i was experiencing. Mom played them all and it was good to just have someone to talk too for a moment. I had to explain to her i was still in a fucking airport, in the wrong fucking state, and FAC was giving me those &quot;just give me a reason to...&quot; looks. She was able to talk to Mike about my situation and once again, she just wanted me to call when i finally got back home.

MIKE SAVES ME
---------------------

Mike picks me up. It was late. We drive back. Before we go back on the Mass Pike, i offer to pay for gas because Mike was saving my ass. I didn&apos;t want to be at that airport any longer. Me and Mike have a long discussion about the shit i had just been through and the shit that he&apos;s been going through since i&apos;ve been gone. I don&apos;t even know if i told him how nice the weather was or that i saw Adam Carolla or that i went to all those baseball games. It was just about the bad shit of being delayed, and that fucking asshole cop. All shitty conversation. It&apos;s a shame that was how to end a vacation in such a shitty way.

It was a long drive all the way back to Mike&apos;s place. I had left my car in his driveway in case it snowed at my place. I drove back home. It was by now 1:00am. I should have been home some 6 hours earlier, but here i was now. I did call my parents to tell them i was back home and all was well. But things weren&apos;t well. I had such a shitty day, on such a shitty fucking airline. I didn&apos;t even realize i couldn&apos;t have that one last chance to check worcester airport in case they had my sunglasses. I just wanted to go to sleep, but i was still cranked up from earlier. I didn&apos;t sleep until it was almost 3am. No biggie, at 5:00am, i woke up and got ready for work.

That was my last day in Florida. Some lessons to be learned here. First, never fly DirectAir. In fact, fuck that entire airline. If your regularly scheduled program is interuppted by a news flash of an airplane crashing, hop that it&apos;s a DirectAir airplane. Anything to make that airline go out of business a little bit sooner. Second, i always hate traveling, and this horrible real life example is one of the reasons why never traveling works well for me. Third, i&apos;m starting the Give Cancer and AIDS to that Fucking Asshole Cop. He can be contacted at FuckingAssholeCop@ConnStatePolice.gov Mention how you just fucked his wife so he&apos;ll be a little bit more miserable. Fourth, when in doubt, and you&apos;re at the airport, don&apos;t say a fucking word.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

The ratio of death threats that lead to the actual death of that person that&apos;s been threated is almost zero. So once again, here&apos;s hoping for the death of that fucking asshole cop, who will be raped to death by a king cobra if god enjoys karma. ( 2 Comments | Comment on this ) Monday, March 21st, 2011 8:00 pm The Other Six Days in Florida (Part II) 
 Before i continue with my days in Florida, a few notes about what is happening in Massachusetts. It&apos;s officially spring, it after a week or two of really nice weather, now it&apos;s friggin snowing outside! Can you believe that shit? Mother Nature needs to be bitch slapped back to normal. It&apos;s like a cruel April Fools Day prank, just a few days earlier than expected.

In movie news, there is now about 5 movies playing locally that appear interesting to me. But only one has actually gotten rave reviews, and i haven&apos;t seen it yet. But i have a feeling i&apos;m going to get around to seeing it, maybe this Wednesday. It&apos;s such a shame though, March is almost over, which means 1/4 of the year has gone bye, and i&apos;ve only gone to the movies three times so far this year. Painfully below my one movie a week average. Then again, i am avoided all those so-so movies that i got stuck seeing last year.

In poker news, i&apos;m going to Foxwoods tomorrow after work because they gave me a postcard for a free chance to score $25 in cash or up to $25,000. Last time i did this, i pull $25, which i used for gas money. And i was up a couple hundred, lost it all in one hand of poker, then pulled a $100 profit playing the Wheel of Fortune slot machine, and left. It was fun.

In Forty&apos;s poker news, Mike didn&apos;t do a very good job being my substitute, but no big deal. The next week, i played really well, and got third place. That finish only should lock me into the top 20 that will advance to the final tournament. At stake, 5 brand new Hi-Def televisions. And i get the option of taking the cash amount, or a brand new tv which i&apos;ll quickly give to my parents for being the amazing parents that they are. After all, they let me stay with them in Florida. So...

MONDAY
---------------------

The big thing about this Monday in Florida was that it was Uncle Tom&apos;s 75th birthday. I didn&apos;t have any spring training games to go to, and i&apos;m pretty sure this was the day i completly got over my cold. At the very least, it was when i decided to stop taking the drugs and cough syrup to see if i was over it. Don&apos;t think i coughed all that badly.

After sleeping in a bit and enjoying a breakfast by my parents (i forgot the simple pleasure of mom making pancakes, or dad yelling in a pissed off rage as he tries to fry an egg and the yolk breaks), the big thing to do was hang out with my dad a bit and shoot pool with the old man. Ironically, this would be the last time i refer to him as old man because we go to the pool hall at this old folks rec area, and it&apos;s like the actors from &quot;Cocoon&quot; reunited to play 9-ball. Here&apos;s the deal for those that haven&apos;t hung out at a pool hall before, it can get a bit noisey, because people are hitting billards balls, people are chalking up their cues, and generally ball busting talk takes place. Except, these people are too goddamn old, and everyone&apos;s hearing is shot to hell. That&apos;s how the most common phrase at that place is, &quot;What?&quot; These people couldn&apos;t hear each other if they were stuck inside a library after a nuclear blast (kinda like Burgess Meredith in that &quot;Twillight Zone&quot; episode, which makes sence, i saw 5 Burgess Meredith clones at this place), nevermind inside a pool hall. A sample of dialogue that existed in that place.

Old man: You&apos;re shot
Another old man: What?
OM: It&apos;s your shot!
AOM: Huh?
OM: Go, you&apos;re stripes, i&apos;m solid
AOM: Did you shot yet?
OM: What?
AOM: Who&apos;s turn is it?
OM: Wait, who did the break?
AOM: What broke?
OM: Huh?

Me: How is it possible you guys are still alive?
Both old men together: What?

(i put my cue stick away and leave in disgust)

END SCENE

Another fun thing, apperently 85 years ago, everyone named their newly born son Bernie, because 3 different guys named Bernie were shooting pool at this place. It was like a crappy version of &quot;Weekend at Bernie&apos;s&quot;, like &quot;Weekend at Bernie&apos;s 2&quot;, except i couldn&apos;t figure out who was more dead, these people or Bernie from the movie.

In the end, me and dad play 7 games of 9-ball, and he won 4 games to 3, and we quickly left. I couldn&apos;t handle overhearing all of these old men pathetic stories. What stories to old men tell each other over games of pool? Is it something cool like the number of Nazis they killed during WWII? Is it about that time they slept with Marilyn Monroe? How about how they saw Ted Williams hit a homer out of Fenway in 1948? No, nothing cool like that. They talk about how they had meat loaf last week and how it compares to a turkey dinner they&apos;re going to eat this week. I had no clue the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; were that goddamn dull.

Later that night, we went to that Teddy&apos;s Wing Shack, and later back to Auntie Linda and Uncle Tom&apos;s place for really good cake. And more old people showed up for semi interesting conversations about being in the military and the days before Kennedy was president. I couldn&apos;t offer much to the conversation except something along the lines of fuck Egypt and the middle east, my overall non interest in the idea of world traveling, and no one would ever want their daughter to live in that armpit of the world.

TUESDAY
---------------

This was the day of the big Red Sox vs. Cardinals game. We (this time, it included Mom, Grampy, Auntie Linda, and my dad&apos;s cousins along with me, dad, and Uncle Tom) went and i got to improve on my seating from last game because i got to sit next to Grampy in the handicapped seating. Right beind home plate, a dozen rows back or so. This ballpark was PACKED compared to the other game. This place could hold 8,000, and 7800 people were in attendence. Everyone goes crazy to see the Red Sox play.

Too bad it was a split squad game.

That meant, half the team came for this game, while the other half played a spring training game elsewhere. Although i forgot who pitched for the Red Sox, i do remember that Youk was there, Big Papi, and Elsbury too. We got to the game early which i was all for because you get there early, you&apos;re allowed to watch the visiting team hit batting practice, which meant you get a chance to see the Sox hit a few over the fence.

All the single-A players though were taking batting practice, which makes sense, they need it the most. It was crazy, i saw guys with numbers like 84, 98, 79, and for some players, they didn&apos;t even bother putting their last name on the jerseys. You don&apos;t see that outside of a high school football game, but that&apos;s what happens during Spring Training. All the high school studs get a chance to potentially shine, and then two weeks later, they have a free jersey and some cool stories to tell others as they bag groceries the rest of their lives.

I wish i could tell more about the game, but the highlights were:

Sox Won
Youk, Papi, and Pujols for the Cards all had hits
There was an 8th inning homerun
And there was one inning that a crappy pitcher gave up 5 or more runs to put the game out of reach. Thankfully it was a Cards pitcher.
The Cards did a comeback, but the Sox were able to put it away.
At the very end, for the final out, i started a &quot;Let&apos;s Go Red Sox!&quot; chant that did work, and it ended the baseball game on that chant.

Grampy was cool to hang out with as i drank 3 Bud Lights and enjoyed the nice weather as once again, i was in Florida enjoying a baseball game instead of the miserable cold that was back in Massachusetts. All seemed to have had a great time because the Sox won. Half the group went one way, and our group went for the pizza buffett. I enjoyed it despite the noise of so many kids at a restaurant.

OK, it looks like this entry is another long one, so i&apos;ll end it (&quot;House&quot; is on and i&apos;d like to watch it) now. Next time, my last spring training game, how i saw another Red Sox game, and then finally, the hell of flying an airline no one has ever heard of called Direct Air.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

I don&apos;t want to jinx it, but i can&apos;t wait for August 14. Congrats John! ( 1 Comment | Comment on this ) Thursday, March 17th, 2011 9:39 pm The Other 6 Days in Florida 
 My entire trip to Florida came and went so damn fast. And then all of the horrible shit that went down on my last day during the part that i came back to Massachusetts was such a fucking nightmare, i&apos;ll have to write about that some other day. Trust me when i say, i have an interesting story about potentially being on the no fly list.

It&apos;s also been, since i&apos;ve returned back, a horrible nightmare at work. Once again, NO ONE was able to properly pitch in and do my job. Over a week&apos;s worth of backlogged paperwork just waiting for me. My boss attempted to pay the bills that i do every day while i was gone. Typically, i might mispay one item on a single bill once every other week. After finally catching up and trying to match invoices, my boss mispaid on multiple items, spread over twenty (20, that&apos;s a big goddamn number) different bills. Add that to bullshit emails i had to respond to, a new format of dealing with our route settlements, and the fact that this is our period close, which means i&apos;ll have to work this Saturday and Sunday. Work has sucked so goddamn much since i&apos;ve returned back from Florida. I was still in vacation mode for a couple of days, haven&apos;t slept well, then that weird body clock bullshit happens when daylight savings occurs and we lose one hour of sleep, there&apos;s no sun in the morning to wake me up, and too much sun at night for me to properly drift off into sleep. Being lazy has always kicked my ass, took me until Tuesday to actually unpack my luggage. Still haven&apos;t shaved yet. And it&apos;s why only now am i updating my LJ. But, enough of the misery, time for me to talk about the good things about Florida.

Saturday
--------------------

I was scanning my Twitter, and learned that Adam Carolla happened to be performing standup in Palm Beach. When i asked my mom if she knew of a certain street that the club was at, and learned it was only a few miles down the road, i felt it was a hell of a sign. On Saturday morning, my mom was able to call the club, made sure they still had tickets available, and we all drove out to the club for me to get my ticket to see Carolla.

For those that don&apos;t know, i&apos;m a huge fan of Adam Carolla&apos;s daily podcast. Listen to it everyday. I even listen to other podcasts that happen to have Carolla on as a guest. Plus i bought the guy&apos;s book. I find his brand of humor very enjoyable. However, because i listen to all of his podcasts, and read his book, i more or less heard of 75% of all his material from before. Still, i enjoyed rehearing the story of when Tom Cruise went to a football party and brought cupcakes and his mother. Or the crazy ups and downs of Carolla tax statements. And i enjoyed rewatching the animated movie of Carolla&apos;s fake movie pitch &quot;Gay Eye&quot; with Bryan Cranston. The other 25% was great and i was laughing my head off. I was also still a little bit sick though, so every time i&apos;d laugh too much, i&apos;d end up coughing. Even the stuff i heard before still got big laughs followed by polio inspired coughing.

Aceman was on his game and the way he included videos of past work and slideshows to emphasize his point was a nice twist of just a guy repeating his one hour of comic routine and then doing it again at another club. Carolla can always mix it up from one location to another spreading out shit on his mind, things that just happened that day, and showing other slides of &quot;Shit That Pisses Me Off&quot;. It&apos;s great, and his ending was very inspiring. Anyone can be a slightly out of work construction worker to a millionaire doing something they love and being creative.

Sunday
---------------

This was the first of three spring training baseball games i would attend while i was down in Florida. In Jupiter, Florida, which is about a 15 minute drive from West Palm Beach, there&apos;s a stadium that hosts both the St. Louis Cardinals (with one of the best baseball players of all time, Albert Pujols) and the Florida Marlins (with one of the best young baseball players of today with Hanley Ramirez). Well, this Sunday, it would be the Cards vs. the Marlins, and i happily went with my dad and my Uncle Tom. Great seats, pretty good weather, and just a hell of an enjoyable atmosphere. Here i was, in the middle of winter, in Florida, wearing shorts and sipping on a bottle of Bud Light, watching a baseball game in the mostly sunny afternoon. Actually, it was a little too sunny, i ended up getting sunburned on the top of my hand, the spot i always forget to put lotion on because it&apos;s on the opposite side of the palm of my hand.

I&apos;ll be honest, i forgot who actually won, but it was still a nice game. Got to see Albert Pujols hit the ball and same with Hanley Ramirez. Even though both teams could have put out total scrub players, i saw enough players who were actual all-stars play.

Once again, mid-60s temperature, while others were dealing with the on again, off again freezing rain from Massachusetts. I was watching baseball, eating a hotdog (worst baseball hotdog ever. The Fenway Frank has nothing to fear.) and enjoying a meaningless exhibition game. It was nice and sunny until it started to rain, and then it rained really damn hard to end the game in the bottom of the 8th. There was a little rally for the team that was behind, but no big deal, it&apos;s spring training. Game was called off due to the rain, and we walked back to the car a little bet wet but still, a good time was had by all.

The car ride back gave me the opportunity to shot the shit with my Uncle Tom. Very smart and opionated man with good stories to talk too. It&apos;s a shame i really only talk to this guy for a few minutes during Christmas Eve, but we spent a good amount of time during these baseball games talking about football, military stories, how to fix the world, how to destroy the middle east and not give a shit, and the alarmning amount of dead bodies constantly being found in the canals all over Florida. Anyway, Uncle Tom, if you&apos;re reading this, you were a delightful good thing about Florida. A nice contrast to the occasional outburst of old person anger that would occur with other people in Florida.

Monday, and Restaurant Recap
-----------------------------------

Before i go into the quick detail of Monday, i should properly stop and take time to thank my parents. They did invite me into their place surrounded by all the old people in Century Village, named so because the average resident&apos;s age is about a century. They give me a place to live for a week, and were also my taxi service (seriously, they drove me to and from the Carolla comedy club 3 times that Saturday. It was always above and beyond the normal parenting duties.) They also feed me multiple times over with both home cooked meals, and the constant restaurants we went to throughout the week.

Speaking of restaurants, a quick recap of the places we went to. First restaurant was a place called the Golden Corral. It was loud, i hated the other customers at the place (looked like more than half the people were either on Jerry Springer or were just highly devoted watchers of that show), the food was so-so, and there was an annoying little shit of a kid about 5 years old that should have been fed to the gators or just locked in a car with the windows all rolled up. Darwin would have wanted that.

We went to a place that was a pizza buffett. I liked it, but we also happened to have good while there was some sort of toy giveaway, and there was an annoying woman, literally with a blowhorn, shouting out randomn numbers to people that had tickets and just won a shitty prize. Still, for cheap pizza, really good, very little sauce, good calzones, and extra cheesey cheese bread.

Uncle Tom happened to turn 75 years old during the week i was down there, and we went to a chicken wing place. It was strictly a college restaurant, with pitchers of beer and cheap wing specials. And here i am, surrounded by old people, who need to make special arrangements for tea and fish. It&apos;s a place called Teddy&apos;s Wing Shack, eat some wings and have a cold draft beer. If i could do it over again, i would have gotten the 20 wings and pitcher of beer for $14.95 special. Normally that would be for 2 hungry and thirsty people, or an entire table to share, but i could have done it.

Another place we went to was the place right next to the Carolla Comedy Club. It was nice, although i almost lost my parents and i learned dad had the bladder of a baby. Instead of properly being seated, we just sat down. Then we figured out you can&apos;t get much service at a restaurant if the waitstaff don&apos;t know you exist. Mom went one way, dad went another, and for a solid 10 minutes, people could not figure out where the other person was. Eventually, we did get to sit down at the table we originally sat at, but it was a bad idea. The view was nice, but it was a view of a fountain shooting water. With my dad watching this, we didn&apos;t even put our drink orders in before he had to run to the bathroom. When he came back, he starts ordering Diet Pepsi, and then there&apos;s that Florida sudden downfall of rain. Well, with fountains of water, a downfall of rain to look at, and three Diet Pepsi refills, dad went back to the bathroom a total of three times at a restaurant we were only at for about one hour.

Amazingly, after that restaurant, we took the scenic route back home, checked out the rich people&apos;s home, saw the actual ocean, and some coastline, and not once but twice, we had to wait in traffic as the bridge was up due to a large ship passing by. We settled at a little public cove to watch people fish, and there was a bathroom there. This time, both mom and dad went to the bathrooms to empty their ever shrinking bladders. As for me, i ate entire plate of nachos, and with the coughing medication i was on at the time, i needed to really go home and be near a toilet. Yes, i deperately needed to shit, but i could tell my parents were enjoying the surroundings, although i can&apos;t think of why. Finally we left, rounding out the other side of rich man&apos;s island, and waited a good amount of time as another large ship passed by a bridge stalling traffic. Finally was able to use the bathroom back home and knocked out 15 pages of the book i was reading. Good times.

Last restaurant we went to in Florida was Duffy&apos;s. But that happened later on in the week. So, because this is already a long entry, gonna split it up. Tomorrow, i&apos;ll try to pick it back up with Uncle Tom&apos;s Birthday on Monday.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

Yes, they have shitty drivers in Florida. But i was so happy my dad drove me everywhere. Not only would i have gotten lost almost instantly if i drove, i&apos;d also either be run over by a gangbanger, or a 90 year old man with bad vision. Florida: We dare you to drive on our streets. ( Comment on this ) Saturday, March 5th, 2011 6:25 am Day 1 in Florida 
 Before i start talking about my current vacation in Florida visiting my parents, a very quick recap of the Oscars. Everything i predicted to happen was right, except for i went with the underdog pick of &quot;The Social Network&quot; for best picture instead of the favorite and actual winner &quot;The King&apos;s Speech&quot;. It&apos;s a weird shame lately, there are so little surprises anymore during the Oscars, that i myself can correctly guess the winners of all 4 acting catergories, both screenplay winners, best director, and as always, assume Pixar will win for best animated movie.

It sucked that &quot;Exit Through the Gift Shop&quot; didn&apos;t win best documentary. They went for a movie about the recession instead, a movie that is incomplete seeing that we&apos;re still in a bad economy, and all those CEOs responsible for doing illegal things haven&apos;t faced a single day in jail for their actions. I loved Anne Hathaway as host, but James Franco brough nothing to the show at all. And i haven&apos;t felt that uncomfortable watching Kirk Douglas since the ending of &quot;Spartacus&quot;.

One last movie thing, me and my nephew Jordan saw the movie &quot;Hallpass&quot; together last week. It was good, had some strong laughs, but the movie felt a little bit long. It was another R rated, raunchy comedy with the new bit of showing a guy&apos;s penis in the movie. And it was just on screen for way too long. A couple of funny bits, but you already know that the guys acting as pigs in the movie are deep down really sweet and they&apos;ll do the right thing and be with the ones they love by the end. Still, me and Jordan had a good time, and around this time, i got my cough, and i&apos;ve been sick ever since.

Slight good news about that day was after, i played poker at Paul&apos;s place and won some money.

Now that i&apos;m all caught up with past news, more to the current news. On Thursday, i packed up all my stuff because i was heading to the airport to take a DirectAir flight from Worcester to West Palm Beach to see my parents. I thank my brother Mike for dropping me off at the airport, and for also allowing me to keep my car at his place. It&apos;s just in case it snows, i don&apos;t want my car blocking access to the snowplow in the parking lot of my building for the other residents.

I get to the airport as suggested (they want people there two hours before the flight leaves, and that&apos;s about one hour, forty minutes too early) and i wait. And wait, and wait some more. Our flight was delayed and instead of taking off around 7:45, we left at 9:20. Instead of being in Florida at 10:45pm, we got there a quarter past midnight. Of course, me being so fat meant being jammed into a set and i felt bad squishing that poor guy in the middle seat. But, for $150 roundtrip, i&apos;m not going to complain at all.

I WILL complain about this though. Somewhere between enterting the Worcester Airport and landing in Florida, i lost my $250 pair of prescription sunglasses. I&apos;m such a fucking idiot. I can&apos;t believe i somehow allowed this to happen. I put them in my carry on so i would have them right there, but the bag must have gotten knocked over and my sunglasses must have fallen out. We called the airport, they didn&apos;t have them at lost and found. We called Mike to check his car to see if they fell out during the car ride to the airport, but they weren&apos;t there. We went to the airport because DirectAir is so small and cheap, they don&apos;t even have a phone to talk to someone there. We went to see if there was anything in their lost and found. The woman goes back to check, and comes back with something. I instantly knew it wasn&apos;t my sunglasses. The case was much bigger and rounder, and it didn&apos;t have a button to press in the middle to open it. The lady said am i sure, and when she opened it up, she realized they were reading glasses. I was so pissed. Our only bit of hope is that someone has them at the Worcester Airport. We called them up, but the DirectAir guy wasn&apos;t around to talk to and check their lost and found. It fucking sucks so much i&apos;m without my shades. It&apos;s sunny and beautiful, and i want to enjoy being outdoors without the blinding sun in my eyes. I just hope they show up soon, i really need my shades.

So, after the giant delay and losing my sunglasses, i&apos;m now with the parents in Florida. My loud and crappy cough is still with me. I&apos;ve decided to stop taking the different pills i have been taking because they&apos;re making my insides all messed up. Just going to stick with cough syrup, cough drops, and some afrin for my nose.

Got myself a temporary photo ID, read more of my Saturday Night Live book, and then me and the parents had the early bird at a restaurant called the Golden Corral. The food was fine, but because of the pills i&apos;ve been taking, i get full very quickly and then my stomach is in knots for the next several hours. It painfully sucks being sick on vacation.

But what really sucked about the restaurant was this 5 year old boy who was just a little shit that shouldn&apos;t be out in the public in the first place. The rat bastard was eating pasta with his bare hands, just eating food right out of the trays in the buffet line, and throwing shit around. He had his grandparents watch him, and they were just letting the little fucker walk all over them. When a kid acts like that, they should just put his ass in the car and make sure the windows are rolled up all the way. Yes, i&apos;m advocating the death of children through heat in order for them to be quiet in the public. It&apos;s Darwin at his finest, because eventually this kid is going to murder someone or be murdered eventually anyway, and i don&apos;t want that kind of suspense out there.

As usual, i can&apos;t sleep comfortably in a new room. Plus, my cough still sucks. I&apos;ve been up since 5am.

Some good news though. I was checking out my twitter feeds, and learned that Adam Carolla was in Florida doing his standup. Well, i checked it out, and he&apos;s performing 4 miles away from where the parents are at. I&apos;m gettings tickets to his Saturday night performance and i&apos;m going to start having fun. On Sunday, that will be a Spring Training baseball game with my dad and my uncle Tom. Monday will be for uncle Tom&apos;s birthday. Tuesday and Wednesday are both Spring Training baseball game days. And i leave on Thursday afternoon. So, i still have between now and then to get my mom to do my taxes for me. With my shades lost, i need to find a way to start making some money back. And then use my tax return on a new computer back home.

So, that&apos;s how my first day went. I probably won&apos;t update everyday like this, but if i can&apos;t sleep, and i got this computer in my bedroom anyway, i might as well be mildly productive.

Brian&apos;s Big Thought of the Day:

I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s taken me so long to be back in Florida during the winter. Sunny and breezy in the low 70s. Haven&apos;t been in Florida since i was in the first grade and we went to Disney World. ( 1 Comment | Comment on this )
