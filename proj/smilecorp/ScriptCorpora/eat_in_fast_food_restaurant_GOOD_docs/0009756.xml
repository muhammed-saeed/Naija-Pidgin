Room small mosque is basically a room facing the Qibla, therefore to consider the location of doors, Qibla direction and length and width of the room to be comfortable . The location of the mosque could be close to the family room for the whole family within easy reach, or slightly apart so as not to interfere with other activities, in accordance with the wishes of residents. The minimum size for the dimension of prayer per person of approximately 60 ? 100 cm so that the size of the human dimension can be seen just how many family members who can pray.

HAVE A special room as a place of worship around the home is often done a lot of people. For example, musala which aims to increase the faith of the house owner and family members.

According to architect Probo Hindarto, before building musala, many things that must be considered. First, notice the size or dimensions of the room . This is important because the landlord needs to consider the location of doors , the direction of Qibla, as well as length and width of the room to be comfortable .

Location of musala could be close to the family room for the whole family within easy reach or slightly apart so as not to interfere with other activities.

“Normally for a suitable location adapted to the wishes of residents,”he added.

Furthermore, musala could be placed close to the area of space together.“Some of my clients choose such a time so that prayers, other activities like watching TV can be paused to pray together,”said the Probo.

Another reason, so far away from activities that could disturb the prayers. Therefore, you should select the location that best suits your wants and needs. As for size, said the Probo, at least for the dimensions of prayer per person of approximately 60 ? 100 cm.

So, from the size of the human dimension can be seen just how many family members who can pray in congregation. Sometimes the number of prayers that can adjust the place, but the new musala be designed according to the needs of how people can pray.

So what about the ceiling height, Probo, nanny astudioarchitect.com website says, ceiling height may be the same or different rooms in the house . In fact, sometimes depending on the circumstances. Such as, for lack of land space , can only use the high ceiling.

In order to get the impression more spacious and airy. Other cases , there are also residents who want a low ceiling is designed to enhance the intimacy of each person in the room .

Meanwhile to cover the floors, you can adjust it to current needs prayers. Such as wood flooring, parquet , or ceramic can be used.

“We recommend that you use different types of floor coverings with other floor and raised slightly from the other floors,”added Probo.

So even when choosing the right lighting for musala. Lighting can be dramatic. For example, using spotlights or spotlight. But many also who choose using lamp general or general remembering for salat us unnecessary luminance assorted.

About the color, Probo suggest, better to use neutral colors or colors that have associations with Islamic color, like a soft green color so as not to interfere with absorption of worship.

Furthermore, note also the location where the wudu. According to the Probo, the wudu as much as possible adjacent to musala so as not to interfere with any other space . Usually, after wudu skin becomes wet or damp the user wearing sandals so that water can be splashed or wet the floor in another room .

“This place can be given wudu bottom with coral, couples iron frame with metal grating to drain water in slippers, and water used wudu must be distributed quickly so as not to stagnate,”suggested Probo.

With the form of buildings from the plan of building an entirely new, IM Pei seems to want to lift something that is in contrast with the surrounding environment, but somehow kept in touch because new buildings are conditioned to be a complement of the previous building. In this building Pei using triangle geometry as a basic element in the design of floor plans and a lot of structure elements .
