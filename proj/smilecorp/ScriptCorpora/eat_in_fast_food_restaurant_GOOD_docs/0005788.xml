41218. Abstract: A bandgap voltage reference is presented with a piecewise-linear compensating circuit in order to reduce the temperature coefficient.The basic principle is to divide the whole operating temperature range into some sub-ranges.At different temperature sub-ranges the bandgap reference can be compensated by different linear functions.Since the temperature sub-range is much narrower than the whole range,the compensation error can be reduced significantly.Theoretically,the precision can be improved unlimitedly if the sub-ranges are narrow enough.In the given example,with only three temperature sub-ranges,the temperature coefficient of a conventional bandgap reference drops from 1.510-5/ to 210-6/ over the -40 to 120 temperature range.

Abstract: A continuity wave model is put forward for the dispersion processof liquid-liquid two-phase system,by coupling mass and momentum conservation equations of two-fluid model.The conditions that result in a dispersion choke and the weak instability of a dispersion process are derived from the model.The phenomena of catastrophic inversion and transitional inversion are explained.The effect of drop size distribution on the maximum volume concentration of a emulsion is predicted using the model.According to the theory herein,emulsion inversion is the regime transition of liquid-liquid system due to the instablity of a dispersion process.The effect of drop size distribution on the maximum volume concentration of a liquid-liquid emulsion only occurs in a certain range of Weber numbers.

Abstract: A new algorithm W-ECOP is presented to effect incremental changes on a standard cell layout automatically.This algorithm deals with cell inserting and cell moving based on rows instead of on cells as most placement algorithms usually do.An integer programming problem is formulated to minimize the adjustment on the initial placement and a heuristic method is presented to search for a shifting path so as to optimize the wirelength.Test of W-ECOP on a group of practical test cases shows that the algorithm can successfully accomplish incremental placement with good quality and high speed.

41266. Abstract: A new approach,gate-capacitance-shift (GCS) approach,is described for compact modeling.This approach is piecewise for various physical effects and comprises the gate-bias-dependent nature of corrections in the nanoscale regime.Additionally,an approximate-analytical solution to the quantum mechanical (QM) effects in polysilicon (poly)-gates is obtained based on the density gradient model.It is then combined with the GCS approach to develop a compact model for these effects.The model results tally well with numerical simulation.Both the model results and simulation results indicate that the QM effects in poly-gates of nanoscale MOSFETs are non-negligible and have an opposite influence on the device characteristics as the poly-depletion (PD) effects do.

Abstract: An algorithm to resolve the coupling effect problem is proposed during the cross point assignment (CPA) stage.In the algorithm,the priority queue concept and the rip-up and reroute strategy are combined to control crosstalk noise caused by interconnect coupling capacitance.First,the nets are arranged into different priority queues according to their weighted sum of their length and criticality.Then,the CPA problem for one queue of nets is translated into a linear assignment problem.After the assignment of one queue of nets,a post-CPA checking routine is performed to check and rip up the net pairs which violate the crosstalk noise constraint and then push them into the next queue to be reassigned.The algorithm is tested by a set of bench mark examples,and the experimental results are promising.

Abstract: Human body modeling is an important research work in the fields of biomedicine and computer engineering.On the basis of NURBS FFD (free-form deformation),a motion modeling method is discussed to simulate the bend of human leg and corresponding deformations of muscles.Generally,FFD uses a trivariate tensor product spline to transmit deformations,and it is feasible to choose only two-order B-spline basis function in this case.According to the anatomic structure of joints,the simulation formulas are presented,and they coincide with the motion characteristics of knee joint and muscles.In the final experiment,a proper selected lattice space and these formulas yield a good visual effect of simulation.Compared with the method of curved patches,this method is simple and efficient.The formulas can be easily applied to simulate the motion of other joints.

42031. Abstract: In this paper,river water quality prediction is integrated with water pollution control measures.Two parameters,water environmental capacity and Pollution Index are selected for pollution control measures.The objective is achieved after the development of simulation model using one-dimensional advection dispersion equation.The model algorithm and computer program is an improvement over the existing water quality models,since the model solution involves four point implicit upwind schemes for water quality prediction and pollution control measures at each grid point.Model simulation results the assessment of water environmental capacity that yield the acceptable and realistic pollutants concentration in order to maintain water quality objectives.The pollution and overall pollution index of the river is suggested for integrating number of contaminants variables into one index.Study provides the mathematical and scientific procedure for water quality management.The new approach is helpful for the water pollution control and to study the impacts of waste effluents on the river system for strategic planning purposes.

42108. Abstract: It has been discovered that the coke formed in CH4 coupling under plasma can be eliminated via pure H2 discharge in the system.Eliminating coke under plasma with positive or negative high voltage in DC electric field has been compared with that in AC field.The elimination of coke takes place only on the negative of the two electrodes in DC field,while on both electrodes in AC field.The coke on the reactor walls can be eliminated with either positive or negative high voltage and in either DC or AC field.Based on the experimental facts,hypotheses of the reaction mechanism are suggested.Quantity of eliminating coke depends on diametrical ratio between reactor and the electrode,input power and electrode materials.

Abstract: Methanesulfonic acid method was used to prepare five acylated chitins.Except heptanoyl chitin, four of them,i.e.acetyl chitin,propionyl chitin,butyryl chitin and hexanoyl chitin,had high degree of substitution(from 1.5 to 2.0)and exhibited lyotropic liquid crystalline behavior and cholesteric phase.As the length of the side chain increased the critical concentration (W/W)somewhat increased from 0.21 to 0.26 because the chain rigidity dropped.The critical concentration value s of all the four derivatives were much higher than that of chitin(0.12) due to the decrease of intramolecular hydrogen bonds.The four acylated chitin can form typical banded texture after being sheared.There minimum concentrations to form banded texture of them were evidently different,varied from 0.25 (for acetyl chitin)to 0.37 (for hexanoyl chitin).These results further indicated that liquid crystallinity decreased while the length of flexible side substituents increased.

Abstract: On the Loess Plateau,water is the main limiting factors for vegetation growth.Root distribution characters have special ecological meaning as it reflected the utilizations of trees to the environments.Even-aged stands of Robinia pseudoacacia on slope lands facing south and north were selected as sampling plots for root distribution investigation.Investigatiing results showed that indicated that on all sites,root biomass decreased with depth,and the distribution depth of fine root was deeper than that of coarser root.The results of variance analysis indicated that there were great differences in root biomass among different diameter classes,and coarser root was the main sources of variance,and the root biomass,especially fine root(&lt;3mm)biomass on northern exposition sites was bigger than that on southern exposition sites.Analysis of the vertical root distribution parameters,root extinction coefficient, indicated that the value of on northern exposition was more than 0.982,while the value of on southern exposition was less than 0.982,which indicated that the vertical root distribution depth of Robinia pseudoacacia on southern exposition was deeper than that on southern exposition.And the distribution depth of fine roots(&lt;1mm)was deeper than that of thicker roots(&lt;3mm),which was in favor of the uptake of water and nutrients from deeper layers,helped the trees to adapt the arid environment,and promoted the growth of the upper parts of the tree.

42289. Abstract: Physical activity has been defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure.It is strongly endorsed as a means of staying healthy and an important avenue for social contact.Although in Australia,some studies have been conducted into the levels of physical activity in some ethnic communities,there has been a tendency to adopt a homogeneous view of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) people rather than an ethno-specific perspective that recognises differing cultural beliefs and practices between and across language groups.This paper reports on a study that aimed to explore the concepts of,and attitudes towards, physical activity among older Hong Kong Chinese Australians resident in NSW.This study involved individual in-depth interviews and the use of open-ended questions.A total of 22 informants was recruited for the study.The findings revealed that most informants did not have a clear idea about what was meant by the term physical activity.Physical activitytended to be a confusing and complicated term to this group.In addition,attitudes towards physical activity among this group reflect their cultural and health beliefs in preventive health care.To increase the physical activity level among older Hong Kong Chinese Australians,culturally-specific health promotion strategies might be needed to tackle the misconception about and specific attitudes towards physical activity,as well as to match the holistic Chinese oncept of health maintenance.

Abstract: Polyphenylacetylenes were synthesized by Rn(nbd)Cl2 and WCl6/Ph4Sn catalyst systems in N2 at room temperature.Polymers with high yield and high molecular weight were obtained.Their structures were characterized by UV,IR,NMR and GPC,respectively.The fluorescence of the polymer solution with different concentration was investigated using variable excitation wavelength from UV to visible region.The relation between fluorescence and polymer structure was studied.The results showed that the molecular chain structure has great influence on fluorescence of the polymers.The emitting peak wavelength of fluorescence for the polymer of high stereoregularity is independent of solution concentration and excitation wavelength.The emitting peak wavelength of fluorescence for the polymer with disordered molecular chain arrangement varies with changing the solution concentration and excitation wavelength,and different emission sites in molecular chains and low emitting yield are shown.The measurement and analysis of fluorescence spectroscopy of polyphenylacetylenes may provide some useful information to judge the molecular chain arrangement in some conjugated polymers.

42357. Abstract: Since piezoelectric resonant filter can not effectively prohibit higher-frequency harmonic,the mechanism of this problem has been discussed by means of a specific example which shows that there exists lots of undesirable resonant frequencies of piezoelectric that would let pass undesirable signals.To solve this probleman ameliorated electrostatic mechanical resonant filter is proposed and a specific case is demonstrated.The example of electrostatic resonant micro-bridge asserts that by adjusting the gap of exciting capacitance the higher-frequency vibrating model of micro-bridge cannot be excited based on orthogonal character of intrinsic vibrating shape of micro-bridge,so that this kind of resonant filter can effectively filter out undesirable higher-frequency harmonic.

42364. Abstract: Soil incubation experiments were conducted in lab to delineate the effect of soil temperature and soil water content on soil respirations in broad-leaved/Korean pine forest(mountain dark brown forest soil),dark coniferous forest(mountain brown coniferous forest soil)and erman&apos;s birch forest(mountain soddy forest soil)in Changbai Mountain in September 2001.The soil water content was adjusted to five different levels(9,21,30,37 and 43)by adding certain amount of water into the soil cylinders,and the soil sample was incubated at 0,5,15,25 and 35 for 24 h The results indicated that in broad-leaved/Korean pine forest the soil respiration rate was positively correlated to soil temperature from 0 to 35 .Soil respiration rate increased with increase of soil water content within the limits of 21 to 37,while it decreased with soil water content when water content was over the range.The result suggested the interactive effects of temperature and water content on soil respiration.There were significant differences in soil respiration among the various forest types.The soil respiration rate was highest in broad-leaved/Korean pine forest,middle in erman&apos;s birch forest and the lowest in dark coniferous forest.The optimal soil temperature and soil water content for soil respiration was 35 and 37 in broad-leaved/Korean pine forest,25 and 21 in dark coniferous forest,and 35 and 37 in erman&apos;s birch forest.Because the forests of broad-leaved/Korean pine,dark coniferous and erman&apos;s birch are distributed at different altitudes,the soil temperature had 4-5 variation in different forest types during the same period.Thus,the soil respiration rates measured in brown pine mountain soil were lower than those in dark brown forest and those measured in mountain grass forest soil were higher than those in brown pine mountain soil.
