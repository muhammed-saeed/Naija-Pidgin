NORMAL, Ill.—Wedding bells meant Taco Bell for Paul and Caragh Brooks.

Customers inside the fast-food restaurant continued to order tacos and burritos as the couple sat Friday in an orange booth at Taco Bell and exchanged vows.

&quot;It&apos;s appropriate,&quot; groom Paul Brooks said. &quot;It&apos;s an offbeat relationship.&quot;

Employees displayed hot sauce packets labeled with the words &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; They decorated the restaurant with streamers and balloons.

The bride wore a $15 hot pink dress and the entire wedding cost about $200. Several dozen guests looked on as the couple&apos;s friend, Ryan Green of Normal, administered the vows while wearing a T-shirt. He was ordained online.

&quot;This is the way to go _ there&apos;s no stress,&quot; said the groom&apos;s mother, Kathy Brooks.

Caragh Brooks, 21, of Australia, met Paul Brooks, 30, on an Internet dating Web site. They already had the same last name.

The couple wrote back and forth and talked on the phone for nine months before Caragh Brooks moved to the United States.

&quot;We have the same brain, just in two bodies,&quot; Paul Brooks said. &quot;We think alike in virtually every manner. We have the same interests, viewpoints.&quot;
 
He proposed on New Year&apos;s Eve and, because they like to spend time at the local Taco Bell, they decided to wed there.

&quot;I would never have expected in my life in working here there would be a wedding,&quot; restaurant manager Carl Hamlow said.

 AContrario 69 Fans 10:48 AM on 01/13/2009 1/Individually it is a sign of true character, self-confidence and commitment to
their relationship, they marry not to please or make people envious but just to be
and live together. They don&apos;t care about what we think and they are right about that.

2/ FinanciallyI they are smarter than average.If things get sour, let&apos;s be realistic, it won&apos;t
cost a thing, except for the bloodsucker divorce lawyers if they decide to pick one.
And they can always stage something bigger later if they can afford it and want it.

Best of the luck to them,actually I think I envy them they will have a beautiful story to tell to
their kids(eventually) AContrario: 1/Individually it is a sign of true character, self-confidence and http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/AContrario/taco-bell-wedding-couple_n_156963_19672654.html History  | Permalink  | Share it This comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.
