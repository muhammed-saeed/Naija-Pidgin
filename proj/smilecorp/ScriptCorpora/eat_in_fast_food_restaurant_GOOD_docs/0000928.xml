 Comtrex Point Of Sale System Introducing the latest in the Comtrex POS hardware line up. The Glaive boasts superior features to work in conjunction with our software suite. With its durable exterior comes a reliable terminal. What sets this amazing model out from all POS hardware solutions is the &apos;No Fan&apos; design. Thanks to its clever design very little heat is produced which in turn requires zero fan extraction from either the main unit or its power supply. It is due to these advances that we believe it to be the quietest most functional terminal on the market today! As standard throughout our current range - touch screens, die-cast aluminum body, tilting screens, customer displays and more are standard. Isn&apos;t it time you put your finger on it!

 Best of all . . . with the same screen resolution as the 12.1&quot;Odyssey terminal, the Codexxa will display the exact same desktops as the Odyssey and runs the exact same application program!
