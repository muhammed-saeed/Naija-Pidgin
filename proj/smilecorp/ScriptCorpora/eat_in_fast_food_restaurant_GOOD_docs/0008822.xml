BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; Robots to Make Fast Food Chains Still Faster

 Restaurant industry experts are predicting that the fast food business will undergo a technological revolution in the next few years that will place increasing numbers of robots and other labor-saving devices in the kitchens. The machines will flip hamburgers, bag french fries, spread pizza dough, fry chicken, bake biscuits, stuff burritos and deliver drive-in orders to cars in about half the time and at about half the cost that human workers require.

&apos;&apos;The fast food industry has no alternative; it will have to robotize,&apos;&apos; said Joseph Durocher, professor of hotel administration at the University of New Hampshire&apos;s Whittemore School of Business and Economics. &apos;&apos;No longer can they afford the luxury of having human workers standing at the beverage bar with a cup or watching hamburger patties on a grill.&apos;&apos;

The move is a direct response to a growing shortage of workers in the industry, experts said.

Professor Durocher said that with unemployment as low as 3.1 percent in some areas in the Northeast, there are fewer workers willing to prepare fast food for the minimum wage of $3.35 an hour, generally what the chains pay, when they can earn as much as $8 or $10 an hour in manufacturing.
 
Analysts at the On Premise Institute, a market research firm in Burbank, Calif., estimate that the fast food industry is 250,000 workers short of the 6 million needed to keep the industry running smoothly.

Scott Allmendinger, food editor of Restaurant Business magazine, a trade publication, said the recent changes in immigration laws, which make it more difficult for employees to hire illegal aliens, have exacerbated the labor problem. &apos;&apos;We are losing a group of high-quality employees, mainly from Latin American countries, who would work hard at a variety of fast food jobs,&apos;&apos; Mr. Allmendinger said.

Mike Lorelli, Pepsico&apos;s executive vice president of marketing and sales, said, &apos;&apos;Our research indicates that the critical problem of a dwindling labor supply will continue to affect the restaurant industry, in fact becoming worse in the years ahead.&apos;&apos;

Responding to the labor shortage, Pepsico, which owns Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, has developed a prototype of a new automated beverage dispenser. It takes 15 seconds to deliver a 16-ounce drink. Orders are punched in at the cash register by a clerk. A computer sends the order to the dispenser to drop a cup, fill it with ice and the appropriate soda, and place a lid on top. The cup is then moved by conveyor to the customer.
