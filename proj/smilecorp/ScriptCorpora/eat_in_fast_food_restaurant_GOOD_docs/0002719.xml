A friend brought me here for lunch. It&apos;s almost stark compared to the usual chains. The menu is small, too. But no matter. The portions are huge, little isn&apos;t little. The Cajun fries are great, and the hot dog was aweome. Free peanuts, too!

I can say it&apos;s the perfect comfort food place. I gotta bring the hubby!

Curious name for a burger joint. Read it was a famous chain so hubby and I wanted to try it out. Came here on a friday night and it was pretty busy. We waited in line and read the menu on the top of the wall. We choose the hamburgers with no cheese. You can pick as many of the FREE available toppings as you like on your burger. It included, mayo, pickles, lettuce, mushrooms, grilled onions and mushrooms, relish, a1 bbq sauce, bbq sauce, jalepenos and green peppers.

The sizes of the burger are normal looking, not big or small. As  you wait for your order, you can snack on some free peanuts they have in the boxes they place near the counter. You can also watch them make your order as it&apos;s an open kitchen.

The hamburger patty is cooked to order so it comes hot off the grill. Once placed on the bun though with all your other chosen toppings, the burger will feel cold. It&apos;s all the fresh ingredients they placed in it like the lettuce, pickles, tomatoes and so forth. Overall the burger tasted good. Fresh tasty burger. Also had the fries that came in the cups and they were yummy as it was cooked in peanut oil. Nicely salted.

Tasty fresh burger with my chosen toppings and fries. Quality.
Try it with the cajun fries for something different. I&apos;d be back!

Who really cares?!?

I am so over the nor cal, so cal battle. The east coast, west coast battle. Good food is good food, no matter the origin!

Rant over. You walk in and 5G reeks of sterility. The white walls and hints of red give a very clean look, but then you realize there are cardboard boxes to house peanut shells or they are scattered on tables.

Yes, it does resemble In-n-Out, but I don&apos;t think it really matters. I appreciate the topping variety they offer, although many of them I&apos;m not particular too. No avocado :(

I was interested in the two size varieties - regular and &quot;little&quot;. There wasn&apos;t anything really little about the size of my &quot;little&quot; burger that I tore up. It was average size, just less calories. Maybe that&apos;s what the menu should read: Lots of calories option or normal calories option. The fries were decent and a huge portion. We ordered one large and split them between the four of us.

I did notice all of the accolades they promote. Don&apos;t they know that Zagat is so 2000 and late. Where&apos;s your Yelp sticker at?!? I&apos;m one of being proud, but some of their posters were ridiculous. Another cool touch was the chalk board showing where their potatoes came from that day - cute.

I left satisfied, not overly or under happy. Just an average burger. We all agreed it was tasty, but no one was raving about how amazing the burger was.

I&apos;ve tried it...that pretty much sums it up!

I so wanted to give this place 5 stars but the burgers are just ok. Here is the problem, the burgers lack seasoning! Of course I can put it on my self but what&apos;s the point? If you are going to brag about your burgers then they should taste awesome before adding all the other toppings. The meat wasn&apos;t dry or burnt but it lacked flavor. The cajun fries on the other hand are the stars of the show, I love them. I haven&apos;t tried their hot dogs but they are on my list. The place is huge, bathrooms were clean and smelled good and a nice variety of beverages. All in all, the food is just average, employees were nice and the burgers are cooked to order, just wish they would season them.

This place is located right off the 99 freeway in a relatively new-looking building.  There are plenty of tables in the restaurant and free self-serve peanuts near the enter/exit doors.  However, this place doesn&apos;t offer free wi-fi.  This is a bit of a suprise to me because every employee looked like recent high school graduate, even the cook.

I ordered a cheeseburger with everything except for onions.  The burger looked sloppy but tasted pretty good.  However, I was a little disappointed because I was expecting something a whole lot better because of all the raves that I&apos;ve hear about Five Guys in newspapers.  In my opinion, In-N-Out has better burgers for less than half the price that Five Guys charges. I forgot the exact price, but their cheeseburgers were $6 or $7 plus tax.

I would pass on a second visit to any Five Guys restaurant.

It reminded me of In and Out but the difference is that Five Guys have more options to add onto their burgers.  The fries are made differently and the environment is different.

I got everything on my burger and a regular fries on the side that I shared with someone.  I think its okay.  It&apos;s not the best burger.  I would like to try something else on their menu some day.

Overall...its okay to me.  Nothing spectacular or amazing.  Just okay to me.  I would however return again to try the other stuff on their menu.

I&apos;m a vegetarian, but I came with my dad to get a burger. The employees were super polite: addressing customers as sir or mam and have no problem explaining to customers how their menus work. I came here with him twice and that was the occasion for both visits. They also have free roasted peanuts that you can help yourself with.

As for the burger, my dad says he doesn&apos;t like the bun and says he prefers In N Out&apos;s buns. However, he really likes Five Guys&apos; meat and meat is more important to him so he likes Five Guys more. He claims it&apos;s the best meat he&apos;s tasted on a burger and if he could have their meat with In N Out&apos;s bun, it would be the best burger ever lol.

As for price, I think it&apos;s more expensive than In N Out.

After our second visit, I really want to like this place (and I am very close to it) but each time I&apos;ve come away disappointed by something.

The first time we went, I loved the burger but the hotdog that my daughter ordered did not come with the rest of the meal.

Overall this was no big deal, but it just added a twist to the overall experience.

The second visit, they forgot to put the ordered BBQ sauce and bacon on our burgers.

When I drew the staff&apos;s attention to this they were VERY polite and helpful, and the burgers were quickly remade for us with no fuss or bother at all.

Both times, the fries seemed to be over cooked so I guess that&apos;s just their style.... it just doesn&apos;t seem to be mine.

Overall, the food itself is not bad (I really liked the burger the first time we went....not as much the second time), and very edible, but if they were right next door to a competitor like Habit, I would not think twice before going to the other guys.

I know people usually compare 5 Guys to In-N-Out but I personally think that they&apos;re two totally different types of burger joints.

In-N-Out has the feel of a 50&apos;s burger diner, serving their food in paper trays and has the benefit of the fun secret menu. Makes you feel like you&apos;re a local in the know :]

5 Guys, however, feels more like a backyard bbq where you can customize your burger or hot dog any way you like. I love the variety of toppings they have and not even a penny more for any of them :D And it&apos;s nice that they have 2 different size burgers to accommodate different size tummies! Although I don&apos;t like peanuts, my friends enjoy snacking on these complementary treats while they wait for their order to come out.

My favorite burger combo is the Little Bacon Cheeseburger with lettuce, mayo, grilled mushrooms, BBQ sauce, jalapeno peppers&amp;grilled onions. MMmmm! Oh and love the cajun fries! Perfectly seasoned&amp;super crunchy!

2.5 :  Five guys is the equivalent to Sonic Burgers in my opinion.  Not in terms of food quality but in regards to hype.   Commercials---Comparison talks---Marketing galore to find out there isn&apos;t a location within 1/2 hour+ from me.    Finally (excited&amp;ready to partake in the hype) I try it and WHOMPITY WHOMP.

It&apos;s decent.  It was too greasy for my liking.
Yes, the meat is bigger.  Where&apos;s the closest In&amp;Out?
Yes, you can pick the size of your meat-1/2, 1/4 (like Fudruckers) but where&apos;s the closest In&amp;Out?
Yes, all toppings (grilled onions, L, T, etc) are free, but have you seen an In&amp;Out around?
Yes the fries are larger than the average skinny fry&amp;they have barrels of free shelled peanuts while you wait?  But ladies&amp;gents, In&amp;Out is literally down the street.

5 guys is a larger sized burger overall however when it comes to meat&amp;accoutrements, there&apos;s much more than quantity..  In my opinion, the race between 5G, Shake Shack,&amp;you know who goes to you know who, bar none.  Double double, grilled onions, mustard grill bread me.... Animal style well done fry me..... Neopolitan shake me up anytime.   Again, bar none.

Establishment:  this location is clean&amp;condiments are well stocked.  It is hidden behind BJ Brewery so you may miss it if you&apos;re driving on Laguna.  Just make sure you enter between BJs and the gas station.

&quot;Little&quot; cheeseburger with everything, except mayo of course (no need to eat liquidfied fat) along with jalapenos and Frank&apos;s hot sauce - overall, flavor was good but the burger and toppings were so much that the bun just fell apart (not good as I really don&apos;t like all the grease on my hands).

Quick! Five Guys vs In - n - Out?

(3/28/2011)
Oh the joys of smashing this long awaited debate. Last night, I had the chance to finally experience the five guys&apos; burger and fries, no homo.

I had a little bacon cheese burger with mushrooms, onions, etc and the small cajun fries. The burger was not small at all. The size is equivalent to an in n out burger but definitely has its unique taste. Don&apos;t let the sloppiness wrapped in aluminum foil fool you. This burger tastes pretty decent. The way its wrapped allows the heat to soak into the burger and leaves the bun a little steamed. What won me over were the grilled chopped onions&amp;mushrooms. Thank god for options!

Pro:
- Tasty
- More options
- Peanuts
- a lot of tables/chairs
- Not busy

Con:
- $1+ than in-n-out

I would pick this over in-n-out for taste but if you do, you&apos;ll have to pick a few more dollars out of your pocket.

I only came once but I liked it. I got their cheeseburger which comes with regular toppings like pickles and tomatoes and lettuce. I do remember their portion was smaller than other places for the same price. My bf didn&apos;t care for it which I think is too harsh of an opinion but I probably have had better burgers.

At first glance it seemed like a really great place to dine. The food was good toppings were plentiful. However, the price for my meal was $9.03 for a bacon cheeseburger and a small drink.  For extra fries it would have cost me another $2.79.  The price does not justify what I had ingested.  The burgers over at In-N-Out is just as good but cheaper for a whole meal.  Won&apos;t be coming here for awhile.

I don&apos;t know if peanuts expire but here it seems to be okay to hand out expire peanuts.

Tip: Once a month kind of dinner.  I will be going over to In-N-Out instead regularly.

I was looking forward to trying this place after hearing all of my cousins on the east coast rave about it. The burgers and fries were good but somewhat pricey for a hamburger joint. I think the east-coaster are looking for something that can compare to In-n-out Burger, but nothing can come close.

The food was fine and satisfied a craving for the normal cheeseburger and fries but they are more expensive then the alternative (In-n-Out) and I don&apos;t feel that the food was any better. The only one may think is better is that you have more options to add to the burger, ie: peppers, bacon, etc. All which drive up the price. It was worth trying once, but I don&apos;t think they have won me over.

REALLY nice people working here, very helpful&amp;friendly, informative&amp;welcoming.
Very clean, with classic rock playing and free roasted salted peanuts while you wait.
Burger is good but not amazing- it&apos;s the toppings that really make it yummy.
Fries are perfect and I mean PERFECTLY FRIED, which some places cannot seem to get.

I&apos;ll be back!

Ahhh, the infamous Five Guys or In-And-Out debate, it&apos;s like trying to fight over who comes out ahead on the &apos;chicken vs the egg&apos; argument. The thing it boils down to is what your personal preference is and for me, I prefer Five Guys all the way.

Let&apos;s set the expectations to all readers, this is a burger chain that originates from the east coast or DC specifically. The things I love about this place is you build your burger the way you like it. And my preference is double bacon cheeseburger with EVERYTHING, which includes your standard tomatoes, pickles, mustard, mayo and grilled onions. Oh but wait....there&apos;s actually more options to choose from???? I thought you said it&apos;s &apos;everything&apos;. Well, everything plus another set of saucy goodness options to please you savvy burger aficionados. You can choose your preference of A1 sauce, BBQ, jalapenos, hot sauce and green peppers.

The other choice this fine establishment offers is what type of fries you want. You can get regular or Cajun. The Cajun fries are covered in bay seasoning which gives it a spicy kick and is pretty eccentric. And what makes it even more strangely and curiously delicious is when you add malt vinegar. It&apos;s sour, spicy, salty taste will leave your taste buds wanting more.

5 Guys all the way. The only thing I would change on the menu is to add milk shakes.

I would have given three stars, but I just can not stand soggy buns.  I had the Bacon Cheese All the Way.  The flavor of the burger is quite good, and the size is hearty and filling.  The buns have potential, but I have yet to eat a burger here where the bun isn&apos;t a soggy mop by the time I am halfway through the burger.  I&apos;d much rather go to Carls Jr. for a Six Dollar experience.

The Cajun fries are overrated.  I&apos;ve tried them 2-3 times.  The first time I tried them, I thought one of the employees got a little carried away with the seasoning, but I have since found out....  That is how they are always served.  If you like french fries that taste like a seasoning cabinet exploded all over them, then, you&apos;ll probably like them (as many people do).  I, however, prefer &quot;seasoned fries&quot; instead of &quot;fries with my seasoning.&quot;

With the hype of this place coming to town, I was excited to try them out.  Will I ever eat there again?  I probably will, but only if it is someone else&apos;s idea.  If you&apos;re looking for the burger of all burgers...  You need to keep looking.

I thought I would only say this at the gay orgy I attend every Sunday in place of church, but here it goes: &quot;I LOVE FIVE GUYS INSIDE ME&quot;.

This is good since I have only 6 holes on my body.

Five Guys is seriously the shit.  Now every time some elitist hipster bastard from New York or Boston talks shit on In-N-Out, I can hit them in the face with their Sony Walkman and be all up in their face: &quot;WE HAVE BOTH NOW BITCH, SHOVE THAT DOWN YOUR SKINNY JEANS!&quot;

You really can&apos;t compare both In-N-Out to Five Guys, they both are different niche burgers.  In-N-Out is kind of smaller-portioned fast food, while Five Guys is more of a sit-down huge substantial burger munch.  I also enjoy the ability to customize your burger with more sauce and veggie toppings.  Seriously, getting the same lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and thousand island dressing at In-N-Out can get old sometimes.  The cajun fries are also beautifully fried and leave a delicious peanut taste.

Service was great, the restaurant was clean, and there were free fucking peanuts.  Yes, you heard me, FREE PEANUTS!

TL;DR:  Like In-N-Out on steroids, except more pricey.

My husband and I have been to Five Guys at least 3 times now, and every time we comment on how good the food is here.
First of all, it is better than its local competitor, The Habit and your everyday fast food establishments in the area.
Five Guys is immaculate. I noticed this first, and then the boxes of help-yourself- peanuts. What a fun treat for diners, and no evidence of any accompanying mess with shells to be found anywhere.
When you order you can get the regular-sized burgers or a smaller version. On a regular burger you get two patties. I prefer the smaller version of their cheeseburger with just one patty. It is plenty for me with all the toppings, mushrooms, pickles, grilled onions, etc.
The fries are good, too. The orders are large, and one is enough to share between two people.
The service is friendly, and I like the fact that they offer vegetarian options in addition to hamburgers. The overall menu is small, but it is adequate, same as In-Out-Burger in this respect. You can watch the cooks make your dinner as you snack on the addictive peanuts. I will definitely go back, and hope that more locations open around the Sacramento area.

I&apos;d say it&apos;s not as (sorta)non-greasy as In-N-Out, Willie&apos;s or Habit but it isn&apos;t super duper greasy where you feel like you&apos;ve cut a fews years out of your life because you&apos;ve done some damage to your arteries.

What I love about this place is that you have such a long list of toppings to choose from which is included in the price. I always opt for the little burger (single patty burger), the hubby always gets the regular (double patty). Toppings include stuff like fresh slices of jalapenos, grilled onions, mushrooms, hot sauce, mayo, relish... Their fries are pretty good too. It&apos;s served in a cup and they always scoop some extra in your bag. I&apos;ve tried both the regular fries and the Cajun style and I like both.

For my son i&apos;ve gotten him a few things. The grilled cheese sandwich (they just flipped their hamburger buns upside down and grilled it) he didn&apos;t like it much, but then again, he&apos;s two. If you get the hotdog, don&apos;t ask for ketchup, they smoothered it! you&apos;re better off adding ketchup yourself.

Another thing i really enjoyed is the free peanuts you get to enjoy while waiting for your food. The place is always very clean, the staff is always smiling and the food is really good. :)

So this is the first time that I had ever gone to Five Guys.

I&apos;ve heard mixed things about them, but I just wanted to see for myself.  I&apos;m not a burger person, but my friend ordered one and I ordered a kosher hot dog with ketchup.  My friend&apos;s burger looked nice and fresh, but he said that it wasn&apos;t the best one that he&apos;s had.  In fact, he thinks that In-N-Out is better.  My hot dog was pretty good, it was sliced open down the center and put into the bun which was a little different from what I was expecting.  But what I liked was that it wasn&apos;t so huge that I felt stuffed after finishing it.

However, what I DID feel stuffed from afterwards was the fries (which I didn&apos;t finish by the way) because even though I ordered the regular size, there was definitely enough in there to share with 2 or 3 other people!  I can&apos;t imagine what a large side of fries looks like.

The restaurant is large inside, but felt a little bare.  It had the typical red and white decor and the strange bags of potatoes laying around as well as the cardboard boxes with the help-yourself peanuts (wtf?) inside.  My friend actually said that he thought his fries tasted like peanuts.  Hmmm...I&apos;m not sure if mine did or not.  Either way, I didn&apos;t notice.

My friend and I both agreed that we probably wouldn&apos;t come back here.  I think if you&apos;re a burger affectionado then you might want to decide for yourself.  The place is worth checking out if you want to try something new at least.  My hot dog was good, yes, but not so good that I&apos;ll drive 15 minutes out of my way to come back for another.

&quot;Meh.  I&apos;ve experienced better.&quot;

That&apos;s all I can say to describe Five Guys because there&apos;s a little place called In-N-Out burger, baby.  There was so much hype on this place when it first opened, and I was excited to try it.  Man, the prices suck for what you get and it doesn&apos;t even taste as good as In-N-Out.  The east coast is tripping if they think they&apos;ve got something special.  I did enjoy the cajun fries though--I&apos;ll give them that.  Too bad it didn&apos;t make up for the disappointment when 1. I saw the price, 2. I opened up the foil to the burger, 3. bit into the burger, 4. thought about how In-N-Out is cheaper and better.

I have to agree with the review below unfortunately this is the best burger your going to find in the elk gizzy. they are good - don&apos;t get me wrong ive been waiting for a five guys to open on the west coast for YEARS - but seriously elk grove -

the best burger you have to offer is from a chain food restaurant. i think as a city you need to step it up.

it&apos;s burgers and fries - at a chain fast food restaurant - what more can i say.

I love the idea of ordering your burger EXACTLY the way you want it, no worries about having to say &quot;hold the onions&quot; you just tell them what you DO want.

Also love the streamlined and simple menu, no frills here!

The staff here are always super nice and friendly which is a nice touch in the often impersonal and non-caring Elk Grove.

I&apos;m not a huge fan of their fries though, think they&apos;re fried in an oil I just don&apos;t care for, seems heavier than most other places but I do like the cajun seasoning.

Do not like the recently added calorie counts next to each food item, damn you FDA!

I&apos;m not going to get into the Five Guys/In&amp;Out smackdown. I like both places. And neither makes burgers that rate as high as Flaming Grill&apos;s or Burgers and Brew&apos;s or even The Habit&apos;s.

So, for what it is, Five Guys presents a decent patty. Their regular is two slapped together. You can get cheese. You can add bacon. And if you ask nicely, there&apos;s a whole truckload of other toppings they&apos;ll throw on for you. Yes, the bun gets sloppy, especially if you choose to have mayo, mustard, BBQ, A-1 and hot sauce all poured inside. Deal with it.

Adding Cajun fries and a drink rounds out the meal and gets you upwards of 10-dollars. That&apos;s pricey to some but I walked away wishing I had a wheelbarrow to carry my stomach, so I can&apos;t complain. Except that I didn&apos;t have a wheelbarrow and now my stomach hurts.

Pretty pricy but I like the condiments that they have and how you can have them all on your burger! Fries are simple but good, especially when I get the cajun seasoning on it. Had the small bacon cheeseburger and it filled me up and satisfied my burger craving.

I liked the inside of this place; lots of light along with lots of red and white decor. We ordered a single cheeseburger and they gave us a double, so I didn&apos;t really have any complaints there, but goddamn, it was a lot of meat. Tons of meat. Huge patties. IT WAS HEAVY. Overall, it was quite tasty. The fries were super good and I really enjoyed them.

I&apos;m not sure we&apos;ll be back RIGHT away, but as for my east coast folks saying that Five Guys is the east coast equivalent of In n Out...I&apos;m not sure I agree. They&apos;re completely different and tasty in their own ways!

I stumbled upon this place the week it opened in Elk Grove and I had no idea what it was. I was hanging out with some friends from NY and they recognized it instantly and claimed it was the &quot;In&amp;Out&quot; of the East Coast. Obviously, being a huge fan of In&amp;Out, I couldn&apos;t NOT try it.

The first thing I notice was this place had a ridiculous amount of Peanuts. Peanuts Peanuts Peanuts.. they were free! But they were everywhere, I thought I was in a circus full of elephants! So I take a look at the menu and it&apos;s pretty massive as you can customize your burger anyway you want with a plethora of fresh ingredients.. Hmm.. pretty impressive I thought. They have a &quot;normal&quot; burger which was 2 patties and a mini burger that was 1 patty. So I ordered a mini burger with a jalapeños and some other goodies, with fries, and a drink. The total was almost $10 for my meal!

After finishing my meal, the burger wasn&apos;t bad. But for $5-$6, it just wasn&apos;t good enough. The fries was probably the most tasty part of the meal. I was honestly disappointed and would easily choose In&amp;Out over this place. The burgers at In&amp;Out are simple, yet absolutely delicious and HALF of the cost. I&apos;m not sure how anyone can complain about that!

Sad to say, I will not be coming back here. Perhaps this is an indication that the East Coast is just not for me, or maybe I&apos;m just smoking crack and trying to find ridiculous correlations that make no sense. In any case, find me at In&amp;Out for my Animal Style burger! ;-)

My first trip to Five Guys was very memorable so lets get the usual stuff out of the way first.
Burger was really good. They sure do put a ton of extras on that burger. The fries I thought were just OK, nothing special and kinda soggy. I would rather have In n Out fries.

Now the crazy stuff. So my kid has a nut allergy so we knew about the peanuts in the place so we stayed away from them. When I first walked into the joint, I noticed the large boxes of peanut oil stacked by the front counter. Of course it did not click in my head at that time. So we finished our burgers and fries and my 3yo son tells me his tummy hurt and then it pretty much all came out all over the table and floor. One of our friends went up to the counter to ask for something to help clean in up, maybe a bucket and a mop, but we got one paper towel. Well one paper towel would not cut it. So we made due with as many napkins as we could find as my wife took my son to the bathroom to be cleaned up. Overall we did not make a big scene, and once one of the employees came out with a mop, she was very nice and helpful.

I enjoyed my burger and fries until my parenting skills or lack of parenting skills kicked in.

Probably will not be back but not because of the food or service.

That&apos;s my story....

Maybe I just don&apos;t know what to order, but every time I come here, I&apos;m just never satisfied.

The inside reminds me of In-N-Out, probably because of the color scheme.  Depending on what time of the day you come in, the line will either be long or short.  I consider Five Guys a borderline fast food burger.  It&apos;s nice that you can order your burger to what ever specifications you want to (single/double patty, pickles, onions, tomatoes, sauces, etc.).  The fries were definitely over-seasoned; and one order of fries would probably be enough for two people.

All in all, I&apos;d probably skip out and go to In-N-Out instead .. it&apos;s much cheaper there, AND who could pass up animal-style fries?!!

I thought I was a hard-core In&amp;Out fan, until I ate here. I&apos;m a vegetarian, so I used to get the grilled cheese at In&amp;Out (basically the cheeseburger without the meat), but the &quot;secret sauce&quot; or Thousand Island or whatever the heck it is was too rich for me.

At Five Guys, I can order a veggie cheese and get as many toppings and condiments as I want it--at no charge--which is more than the tomato, lettuce, pickle and onion I got at In&amp;Out. At Five Guys you can get sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, jalapenos, raw onions, pickles, ketchup, BARBEQUE SAUCE! A1 steak sauce and more! There are so many ways to make your burger. Plus, the regular sized fries are actually of monstrous proportions and taste super crisp (has skin on it). Much better than those soggy sticks they called fries at In&amp;Out.

Imagine if you will...In-n-Out burger, you know the red and white 50&apos;s style burger joint, without the drive through.

Five Guys features the same loud burger joint with same style burgers but with a &quot;unique&quot; catch where you pay for a flat 2 patty burger rate and can choose from a selection of add-ons. Their &quot;flair&quot; is to have sacks of potatoes as decor and crates of peanuts for their customers to eat while you wait for your order. I have yet to figure out why I would eat peanuts when my food should be up in about 5 minutes.

Five Guys is nothing short of bleh. I have had their burgers 3 times and have received a stomach ache 2 of the 3 times.  Yes, the fries are good but at something like 2000 calories not worth the workout that would be required to eat them.

Overall, save the trip to Five Guys and head over to The Habit.

I would give this place 5 stars if it were better than In-N-Out or the Habit.

I ordered a regular cheeseburger and it didn&apos;t not taste anything special.  Did someone say flavor?  What FLAVOR!?  What&apos;s this flavor everyone keep saying.

Stuffing 2 patties in bun does not make it better.  In-N-Out all the way.  Hell, Chick-fil-A all the way and they&apos;re not even a burger joint.

Yay for FIVE GUYS!!!

I always love coming to Five Guys.. Being able to actually pick and choose what you want on your burger is awesome, no surprises =] Cajun fries are a MUST! Service here is really good too, especially Alex. He was really helpful and friendly.

Between In-N-Out and Five Guys, Five Guys wins in my book.

The next best thing to In n Out. This place is starting to get a lot of hype and right now you either love it or your hate it. Me? I LOVE IT.

Great service and speedy! I thought it was funny that the little burgers are what I would consider a normal burger. The servings are huge! 1/4 lb patty. Yes please. I love that I can have it all and for not extra cost. Yay! The grilled onions and mushroom are love.

I think it would be better if they asked me how I want my meet cooked, but that&apos;s ok!

Oh and free peanuts, haha weird. It&apos;s going to really suck for those with peanut allergy.

HOWEVER!! I asked them about their use of peanut oil and it&apos;s only the fries they use it on. AND supposedly they use the super processed/filtered oil so all the allergens are taken out. I suggest if you are one with a peanut allergy to have someone order for you and eat outside.

Cajun fries were interesting.

Have more locations please!!
