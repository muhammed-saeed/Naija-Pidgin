 Banks with coin counting machines 
 « on: 05/20/07, 15:30» Does anyone know of any banks in Inwood or upper Washington Heights that have coin-counting machines?

I have these two huge jars filled with loose change, and I really don&apos;t want to count them by hand. I&apos;d rather just bring the jars into a bank and have them exchange the loose change for bills.

Thanks for your help. Logged meep! meep! meep! --Beaker

The Pathmark on 207th and the Stop&amp;Shop on Broadway (at 232nd?) each have Coinstar machines. Coinstar takes 8.9 cents per dollar, so there is a slight service fee. HOWEVER...

If you opt for the giftcard option (which I do a lot, using my change jar as mad money and also for holiday presents), the service fee is waved! Although I should mention that for whatever reason, the types of gift certificates available on certain machines varies. You can&apos;t get iTunes credit on every Coinstar machine, for example. I&apos;ve been able to find Amazon credits on every machine I&apos;ve used, though.

They exist in every Commerce bank I&apos;ve seen (and they are free). They&apos;re like a video game in the entrance of the back. Self serve. Geared for children. You get a slip of paper that you then give to the cashier to get your money (even has a breakdown of how many pennies, nickels, etc. you brought in) Logged A second flood, a simple famine

Does it count Canadian pennies, slugs, keys, buttons, washers, safety pins...?

Alas, nothing that sophisticated. It will spit things out at you that it doesn&apos;t like, though.

Canadian pennies slip through. The rest get sorted out through a screen. And a cute animated girl named Penny helps you out. Logged A second flood, a simple famine

 « Reply #11 on: 05/21/07, 11:57» The best part about Commerce bank is no one has ever pressured me even once to get an account there. 

This is despite the fact that their level of&quot;customer service friendliness&quot;is at an uncomfortably high level for me.  They are happy to the extent that there is a hidden fear in their eyes that they are going to be fired or maybe tortured if I don&apos;t allow them to assist me in some way. 

Anyway, I keep my piggy bank at work since the Commerce Bank is a block away.

 « Reply #12 on: 11/17/07, 14:28» Every Commerce Bank.

My bank of choice, and yeah, there&apos;s a weird&quot;service&quot;vibe in most of&apos;em. It&apos;s obviously mandated from above, because human nature in the employees takes over, the counter clerks will do anything possible to avoid serving a line of impatient people, but you&apos;ve still got three&quot;managers in training&quot;greeting you repeatedly, and showing you where you can stand in line to wait for the one open clerk.

I&apos;d heard the founder wanted to build a bank chain based on the fast food restaurant model. That&apos;s why the branches are called stores, and their hours are so much longer than other banks. Also why they&apos;re located exactly where they are, and why the counters don&apos;t have glass walls between the customer and clerk.

Works for me, I like the longer hours. The service, IMO, is no different than any other bank. They&apos;ve just drilled the&quot;smile at your guests&quot;mantra into their lower employees over and over.

I usually use the branch on 86th and Amsterdam (or Columbus). Usually have to wait in line, usually have 1-3&quot;managers&quot;greet me at the door, and point to the end of the line, two feet away. The&quot;greeter&quot;thing is annoying, IMO. While I&apos;m standing in line, watching the hands on my watch move ahead, what would make me a happy customer, is to see all the middle managers jump up and service real, live customers who are tired of waiting.

They&apos;re just like every other customer&quot;service&quot;situation, where everyone&apos;s just trying to get off the bottom rungs to avoid having to serve the public, face-on, where they have to deal with real people, requests, and get their hands dirty.

In general, I loathe banks, as an institution. They all suck, Commerce just sucks the least, for me, currently. But they&apos;re open later/more often than everyone else, and they provide free coin counting and exchange to anyone. It&apos;s a good start. Logged .
 &quot;To be honest, I found the topic about as amusing as a fart joke.&quot;

I&apos;ve solved this problem at my bank.

I just walk over to a manager&apos;s desk (the most senior manager I can find), sit down, and start talking. 

I&apos;ve done this so many times that the branch manager himself now jumps up when he sees me, greets me, and steers me to his desk -- not out of friendliness or service, but to avoid letting other bank customers waiting in line catch my&quot;moxie&quot;. Logged

 « Reply #14 on: 11/17/07, 22:39» What really gets me is that I never have a transaction that takes more than a minute at the teller&apos;s window, but everybody else always seems to have something really complicated that should have been taken care of in customer service.
