 Betty&amp;Rick Celebrate Valentine&apos;s Day at Murray&apos;s Restaurant--NO RECIPE-- 
 Feb 15, 2010 5:32 AM 
In this video, Betty&amp;Rick celebrate Valentine&apos;s Day at Murray&apos;s Restaurant in Lexington, Kentucky. This restaurant is owned by the Murray family, who also own Merrick Inn. Merrick Inn is the restaurant where we celebrated my birthday, back in December. Both places serve wonderful regional foods, in addition to a variety of interesting appetizers, salads, entrees, side dishes, and desserts. For our special Valentine dinner, we had oysters, garden salad, seafood bisque, fresh homemade bread and butter, filet mignon, lobster tail&amp;drawn butter, and, for dessert--chocolate cobbler with caramel sauce and macadamia nuts--plus coffee and tea. The dinner was wonderful, and Rick and I exchanged cards and gifts. We had a very pleasant evening, and I will probably be making something that we ordered for bettyskitchen! --Betty :)
