Make this Halloween different and exciting. Your lingerie witch costume is missing a spider web pasty, your sexy librarian outfit has a puke stain on the cardigan, and your red pleather dominatrix suit is ridiculously inappropriate. So switch it up! If you like to curl up with a good Wendy’s chili on a cold night, say thank you with free publicity for Wendy’s Inc. and dress up as the red haired Wendy girl. Even though Wendy is supposed to be a naïve nine year old sweetheart, Halloween unwritten rules give you permission to show just enough cleavage to get the guy with the sarcastic“this is my costume”t-shirt to make out with you in the Halloween party laundry room.




If you’re more of a chicken guy, dress up as Colonel Sanders. The lady’s always love a distinguished southern gentleman who uses a lot of Kentucky Fried Chicken themed pick up lines. Be careful though when taking this costume outside the premises of the party. Those green colored cocktails with the candy eyeballs go straight to your head and release all of those repressed childhood memories of trick or treating. So go ahead and stumble out into the street crying and try to join a kindergarten crowd of Cinderella’s and Power Rangers waiting at a doorstep for candy. But remember that even a sober Colonel Sanders gives off a subtle child molester-ish vibe, and nobody wants to spend a night in jail dressed up as Colonel Sanders and throwing up candy corn, pretzels, and cheap liqueur. Nobody.

Check out some  fast food  Halloween costume ideas below!

This article is the stupidest thing that I have ever read ... actually most of your articles are ridiculous. You should not be a writer.

Hey Washingtonian:
I disagree, I think this guy is entertaining. I love his stuff. Regardless, though, I think you should keep nasty comments like this to yourself. You are stooping to a low you would be embarassed to tell your children about.

Hey, it&apos;s Halloween, not Tolstoy. Lighten up. Just like the holiday, it&apos;s all in good fun.
