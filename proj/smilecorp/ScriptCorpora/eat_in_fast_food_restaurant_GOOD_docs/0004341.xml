People seem to have less and less spending money these days for every day necessities. They have even less time. People don&apos;t have time to cook four course meals these days and most don&apos;t want to try. The perfect solution to our lack of time and extra money is the fast food dollar menu.

My favorite dollar menu is a Wendy&apos;s. I just love their five piece chicken nuggets and the Crispy Chicken Sandwich. The chicken sandwich at Wendy&apos;s is probably the best quality of all the chicken sandwiches I&apos;ve ever tried from any dollar menu out there. Why would I pay $3 for a chicken sandwich at another fast food restaurant when the Wendy&apos;s chicken sandwich is always fresh, hot, and delicious. If you don&apos;t like chicken, you also have the option of the Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger, the Jr. Cheeseburger Deluxe, and others depending on your local Wendy&apos;s. I also like the fact that I can get those little Mandarin Orange cups for a buck too.
 
I also like the McDonald&apos;s dollar menu, but the McChicken sandwich just doesn&apos;t taste as good to me as the crispy chicken sandwich I can get at Wendy&apos;s for the same price. You can get a regular hamburger or cheeseburger for less than a dollar, but they don&apos;t seem a very good value when you can get a double cheeseburger for just a buck. I&apos;ve ordered the double cheeseburger from McDonalds a few times, but it isn&apos;t one of my favorites. It just seems a little too greasy and the cheese doesn&apos;t taste quite right.

Another of my favorite dollar menus is at Burger King . The Whopper Jr. is fantastic. I love the flame broiled flavor and it doesn&apos;t taste as greasy as the McDonald&apos;s double cheeseburger. I also like the fact that the Whopper Jr. isn&apos;t too big or too small and I can order it with a variety of condiments and toppings. Burger King also has chicken nuggets on their value menu, but they aren&apos;t as good as the ones I get at Wendy&apos;s.

Arby&apos;s offers the Arby Jr. for 99 cents, but it isn&apos;t as filling as the sandwiches offered at other fast food restaurants. It&apos;s nice though when I&apos;m not in the mood for chicken or a big, greasy burger.

I just don&apos;t see the point in paying three or four dollars for a sandwich when I have the option of buying a sandwich I will enjoy just as much for a dollar. I can&apos;t even cook a meal at home for a dollar.
