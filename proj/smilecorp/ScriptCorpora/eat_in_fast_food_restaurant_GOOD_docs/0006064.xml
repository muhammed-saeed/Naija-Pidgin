 March 15th Duck Tales 
 
    

 (The Twin Sisters )


     The next morning I tumbled out of bed and brewed a stiff pot of Three Peckered Billy Goat  , popped three duck eggs in a pan, toasted a bagel and shot off to school. A bleary-eyed Henry ate his breakfast as we drove along Mt. Baker Highway.

   After dropping off a reluctant child armed with all his make-up assignments, $3.00 for lunch and an office note to get back into class I puttered around the kitchen trying not to lose momentum. I did a smattering dishes, began cleaning out the refrigerator, returned emails, composed follow-up notes to potential leads we&apos;d gotten, researched boxes makers for our new sample pack and was beginning to catch Alexis up on all the exciting things that had happened at the show. I collected a few overripe turkey eggs, a tomato, a rotten apple and some stale Dorritos™ for Midge. Alexis volunteered to take the pale outside and give our princess her treats.&quot;I&apos;ll be right back and then I want to hear about the Entrpreneur Magazine interview,&quot;he called over his shoulder as the door shut.

 



    He was gone so long, I brewed another pot of coffee, finished wiping down the kitchen and in a momentary lapse of sanity was actually considering folding laundry to kill time. Luckily the vacuum was handy. I figured he’d gotten caught up with some project he spotted when was calling Midge to brunch.

    When Alexis finally came inside he walked quietly into the kitchen where I was eyeing a mound of comforters I was considering taking to a laundromat. He just stood there silently staring at me. Waiting. I looked at Alexis quizzically and yet he just stood there. It took me a moment to realize he had a duck folded up in his sweatshirt. “Out of the claws of death,” he said shaking his head. “Really.” 

   

 (Alexis - slayer of dragons -and Angela) 

    “What? What happened?”

    “Well, I went outside to feed Midge her scraps when I saw an eagle over by the stream near the road. It was on the ground and I realized she had something black. This time I realized it was the duck. I started running down the hill and grabbed a branch, hopped the fence and threw the stick at the eagle. It took off with the duck and had her four feet high in the air when I threw another stick and the eagle dropped the duck into the water. I waded in and got the duck. The eagle flew to a tree nearby waiting to reclaim her prey, but I carried her back in here. She seems ok.”

    “That’s nuts! But I don’t’ get it. The ducks never ever went way over there. They’d be what you might call sitting ducks.” 

    “I know.” Alexis concurred. “I think the eagle grabbed Angela from the other end of the pasture where Lance was taken and flew across the pasture where she was going to finish her off away from any of the buildings.” 

    My heart soared. “You&apos;re a hero! Slayer of winged predators, and this is one lucky duck! I laughed and Alexis laughed too. We&apos;d had enough death. Or fear of it. “Is she hurt?” I wondered. Alexis then unfolded his sweatshirt he’d swathed around her. Bloodstains smeared his sweatshirt and without hesitation I dialed Kulshan and asked for a duck doctor. The doctor told me IF Angela was going to live I needed to take her in for care immediately. Hanging up I called the Cat Clinic. 

   &quot;Hello, Cat Clinic&quot;

   &quot;Hello, I&apos;m trying to reach Dr. Donaldson, it&apos;s her sister.&quot;I added&quot;It&apos;s an emergency.&quot;Mostly because I usually say - if she&apos;s busy it&apos;s not important, but today it was definitely important.

    “Your sister didn&apos;t have any afternoon appointments. She’s already left for the day,” the receptionist informed me. I dialed Lisa on her cell finding her at Trader Joes™ sampling treats and drinking coffee out of a little paper cup, she didn&apos;t hesitate, “OK bring her in, I&apos;ll head back to the clinic. We&apos;need to weigh her because she’ll definitely need antibiotics and I don’t know what else until I see her. You know, she should have ducked.”

    “OhhhK, well we’ll find a box or a carrier and be there as soon as possible.” Alexis went to get a carrier while I threw on some clothes and headed out the door.

   Driving the 30 long miles or so to town without speeding was maddening today, but I know the consequences. I&apos;m a real lead-foot tending toward 62 in a designated 55mph. Bellingham police however must have a picture of my van on the precinct wall. I can get pulled over for doing 30 in a 25 driving the racy Honda Odyssey aka the&quot;Silver Bullet&quot;

    I called Tom and told him of Alexis&apos;quick thinking.

    &quot;Wow! That&apos;s a big day for a duck.&quot;He exclaimed.&quot;A few seconds later and the eagle might have been having duck soup,&quot;he commented wryly.

    Eventually, I pulled into the Cat Clinic parking lot like any other law abiding citizen. Lisa had been waiting for me and must have been watching for me out the window because she cam jogging out and retrieved the carrier with Angela in it. “Can you pick up Phoebe from school? She asked. 

    “I’m on my way,” I said hopping back in to the car after I texted Henry about what was going on. 

 

     &lt;Am at the vet with duck. Eagle had in claws&gt;Mama 

     &lt;Wait! What duck? Lance? I’m so confused&gt;Henry – the white ninja 

     &lt;No, not Lance. Angela. She’s with Lisa. Will explain be there soon&gt; 

     &lt;Holy Crap!&gt;Henry – the white ninja 

 

   Pulling into Fairhaven Middle, I saw an anxious Henry run toward me and explained the dramatic duck rescue on the way to claim Phoebe. Henry jumped out when we got to Larabee Elementary School and went in search of Pheebs.

    “Your mom asked me to get me, we’re going to her work.” I said when she appeared next to my open window.

    “Henry already filled me.” She said matter-of-factly. “Let’s go!” 

    When we arrived at the clinic Angela was just beginning her examination. “It seems the patient needed some relaxing,” Lisa explained. “So she’s gotten a little something to calm her down. I called, Dr. Dan, since he does a lot of birds. The funny thing is he didn’t exactly know what to tell me, as he doesn’t have a lot of eagles swoop away with ducks in the San Fernando Valley. Nor does anyone really have many ducks who’ve lived to tell the tale. 

    “Did you notice she couldn’t quack?”

    “She’s so brave,” Emily interjected as she held her down for her examination and eventual surgery.

(Now it&apos;s time for a bigger helping) 

 
(A pensive Phoebe, a worried Henry a thirsty Angela and a happy Emily - is it Angela or that she is leaving for Hawaii) 

My sister sent Angela home with an Elizabethan collar and antibiotics. “You’ll have to give her a shot twice a day.” 

    “Really? Twice a day? I’ve never given a shot to a bird. Where do I give it?”

    “Just to the side of her breast bone.”

    “What if I make a mistake?”

    “You won’t. Just turn her over and pretend it’s Thanksgiving. Feel for the bone and then move the needle over to the side like this.” She said demonstrating. “You just push the feathers aside put the needle in and pull back to see if any blood comes into the syringe.”

    “Blood! What? Are you kidding me? I don&apos;t want to hurt her.” 

    “Calm down you don’t want to give it in her vein. Simply check for blood if you get any move the needle and do it again.” She stated with the kind of authority a younger sister should not be in possession of. Dang it.

    “OK. I’ve got it.” I said knowing I was beat.

   &quot;All right then, get the duck out of here!&quot;She giggled.&quot;I&apos;ve been waiting all afternoon to say that.&quot;

   Upon our return home, Angela bunked in the attic with Alexis. My sister didn’t want her in the barn where she might get chilled. And her mental state was at issue so we considered bringing in a friend, but there really wasn&apos;t a suitable companion. We batted around the idea of our precious, Louise, (the only chicken with a name) but we were afraid having that sharp beak and being in close quarters, it might not be a good idea. Lisa was worried though that Angela might depressed because she was alone so I did what I would do if I were sick. I let her watch all of the ABC soaps.

    “I’m calling with the morning duck report,” I said cheerily.

    “Yes? How is the patient?”

    “Let’s put it this way. She loves AMC. Tad Martin, he quacks her up, but she is scared “shitless” by the shot. And I do mean this quite literally as I’m covered in green goop and stink to high heaven.”

    “Good,” she chuckled, “I mean, of course that she’s pooping.” 

    “Right.&quot;I said suspiciously.&quot;Anyway, her quack seems to be returning, she&apos;s still hoarse and sounds a bit like Brenda Vaccaro, but it&apos;s improving. And she laid an egg!”

    “An egg? Really? Well, that is something. In the business we like to say she’s doing just ducky !”

 November 25th Hair Today 
 
  (Festive - ok it&apos;s a little Christmas looking, but it&apos;ll do pig) 

   
    All was right with the world. The house was relatively clean despite the power outage and the pipes freezing. Alexis had been cast some sort of spell and water had magically appeared out of the faucets last night.

    (in Tom&apos;s coat wearing pjs - putting coats on goats during the middle of the night in the extreme cold) 

  (The goats are not playing Survivor - this is a full service barn - everyone is warmer now) 

  (Not nearly as stylish as my friend, Sandra - but staying warm during the power outage - when the house got to 42 degrees- the stove is gas so we can still make coffee)

 

    The table was set, snow covered the ground and clung to the trees in Bing Crosby fashion. I’d cranked up the heat to 67 to keep my out of town guests’ teeth from chattering. The house was cozy and lively, people coming and going, cartoons blaring, hot coffee, sautéed onions and roasting turkey mingled in the air confirming it was indeed another Thanksgiving.

    Toby had flown in with Dean the night before and had been up promptly at 6:30 chopping. No, she didn’t want to use a chopper, she’s Italian. The Donaldson’s had arrived with the prodigal son, Mike in tow and were laughing and chatting over a wheel of brie drizzled with our newest Stinger™ - “The Naughty Nana” a ginger and pepper blend. 

  (Toby in her apron and Bruno in his coat take a break from the meal preparations) 

    (Chris in the background -  Toby Ann Forlenza) 

  ( Clearly Dean has gone to the dogs) 



    Ayumi (pronounced “I-U-Me), Henry, Quinn, Dean and Phoebe’s old babysitter was bustling about cooking cranberriies while her 7-year-old daughter Kaya played 57 rounds of tick-tack-toe with Quinn on the whiteboard in the kitchen. It was wonderful so nice to have Ayumi with us - she and her high school friend Ilsa had been the kids sitters since Ayumi was 15 and Henry was about a year and a half. I&apos;d leave him with Ilsa sitting and come home to find Ayumi. They both lived in the neighborhood and would just let themselves in, use the pool and hang-out. 

   &quot;Ayumi you should move up here,&quot;Mike suggested emphatically as he shoveled in some rosemary bread slathered Naughty Nana.&quot;This is by far my favorite flavor,&quot;he informed me. 

   &quot;Well,&quot;she said cautiously,&quot;I do want to get out of Los Angeles. Life is such a grind what with being three hours in the car everyday.&quot;She lamented.

 

   ( Ayumi&amp;Kaya after sledding and building their first snowman) 

  (Kaya and Henry snuggle)

 

     (Mike has been missing in action for two months - upon receiving death threats from me - he re-emerged for the holiday - Mike laughs easily - and is afraid of me - two of his best traits) 

  


    “Hey hon, can you get the second oven working?” Toby asked. “I have a few more things to put in.”

     Taking a sip from my coffee cup I reached up to the cupboard and grabbed a box of stick matches. Absently I took the middle griddle off the old O’keefe&amp;Merritt and began pressing and turning the red button Pablo my old plumber taught me to do. This is supposed to secure the ability to hold the flame.

     Putting my coffee cup down on the counter took a nibble of brie and bent down and opened the broiler confirming the pilot was out. Striking the match I reached up with my right hand to turn on the oven. I guess someone had already turned it to 500 degrees. In split seconds it was all over. I heard the “whoop” and saw the plume of flame leaping toward me. Somehow I knew it wasn’t going to stop. I slammed my eyes shut. I could feel the flames reach my face and my hair crackling. Reflexively I turned my head pushing my self away with my right hand and throwing myself face down on the wood floor. I didn’t move a muscle assessing whether or not I was on fire. In between the screams of surprise that filled the kitchen I chastised myself for the crumbs on the floor now grinding into my cheek. I could hear my sister’s voice through the din. She was going to throw her scarf around me to put out the flames. Toby’s hand reached in. Everyone was asking if I was all right. My sister who I’ve lived through about a million tragedies with started making Michael Jackson jokes before I could confirm I still had my vision.

     I was scared really scared.

    I felt a sharp searing pain in my left eye and my right hand really hurt. Crumpled up, Toby and my sister lifted me to the sink. Lisa hugged me and Dr. Donaldson took charge, “Keep your hand under the cold water. Quinn, get her ice, Toby do you have any eye solution? Let’s get her upstairs.”

 Once I opened my eyes and Lisa examined me asking all the familiar questions, “Does your eye feel scratchy?”

     “No.”

     “Thank God.”

    (no more bangs :( -- the end of the world to someone who hides behind them - and what&apos;s left of my scorched and melted hair- although you can&apos;t tell - my eyebrows are crunchy) 

 

 

    “I’m grateful I can see.”

     “You dodged a bullet,&quot;she said squeezing my hand,&quot;and sorry my Michael Jackson jokes were perhaps a few minutes premature.” 

 “We’ve had worse Thanksgivings,” I said smiling as much as I could manage. She nodded knowingly thinking back to Thanksgivings past – our grandmother Irene died on Thanksgiving, and there was the Thanksgiving, we were held at gunpoint…&quot;Ahh memories, this will be the Thanksgiving Denise burned her hair off.&quot;

   Now that our medical fears had been assuaged, Quinn came bounding in to assess the cosmetic. Scrutinizing my hair she turned to Phoebe, “I think what we need is to first deep, deep condition, can you get some mayonnaise and conditioner in here?” She turned her attention back to me and said in her most consoling Quinn-tone, “Don’t worry, you still have a little bit of eye lash, your eyebrows are singed but some are still sort of there and your bangs? Well, hats are really in this time of year. I saw some really cute ones at American Eagle.”

 April 4th All Ears 
 
   (Luther, The Easter Basset) 

     My little sister, Lisa, is almost pious if it weren’t for her
ongoing affair with the cookie. In fact, Lisa has never met a cookie she didn’t
like. She’ll eat them for breakfast, nibble them in the afternoon with a hot
cup of coffee and sneak a few at midnight with her decaf Earl Grey™ and a book.
Lisa barely discriminates; she just loves cookies, all cookies. She’ll snack on
everything from Thin Mints™, Milanos™, Chessmen™, Snicker doodles, Le Petit
Ecolier™, Savanahs™ to Chocolate Chunk, Madeleines Ginger Snaps and even the
little Cat Cookies™ you get from Trader Joes™. So when she gave cookies up for
Lent, I knew it was a true Catholic sacrifice unto God. And good for her
waistline.

    ( Holy Cow!- Gnatalie) 

  (Tabitha)
 
 

  (Edward peeks) 

 
 

  (Rachel gets into the act) 

  (Henry and Edward-- bunny up) 

  (Tabitha determined to don the ears)
 
      Now, Lisa does a lot for me, being my on call vet for
forty-six animals of all shapes and sizes. She is tirelessly researching
reasons and doing tests to find out why Luther is drinking so much water just
in case he has some sort of mysterious condition. She willing gives up her days
off to help me on the farm and she rides three hours to Olympia to drop off
Irish just because I need someone to hold my hand. During the last few weeks she&apos;d dropped a few hints about hoping there would be cookies ready for her at the end of Lent. I wanted her to know I was listening. 

    I decided to make her some cookies. They couldn’t be just
any cookies; they had to be special cookies. Cookies that said you do a lot for
me and I love you. 

    In this spirit, I hesitantly ventured into the mysterious
uncharted waters of rolled fondant. A strange, flexible icing used to decorate
cakes and cookies. Rolled fondant as it turns out is a true cavity creating combination
of marshmallows and powdered sugar mixed together to form a kind of dough. You begin
by melting them together in a double boiler and mixing them up in a big ooey-gooey
mess. The directions say, “Thoroughly coat your hands with Crisco™ this process
is like a hand softening treatment”. Kneading this pile of gunk is like being in an, “I
Love Lucy episode” fondant everywhere sticking to everything. When I added a
sprinkle too much of water and it began to stick to everything, so I added a
touch more powdered sugar and the darn thing became dry and cracked. Drat. I
did it over and over and over. Frustrated I called my Martha-Stewart-friend,
Toby, for advice. Certainly, she must have made rolled fondant after all she
makes her own crackers and marshmallows Why make crackers or marshmallows? Where’s the benefit? Are they better
fresh?

     (Fondant - prep) 
  

    “Are you kidding,” she said, “I’ve never made it or used it,
but I’d buy it at Michaels™ you can get packages in different colors.”

    “Oh, I was trying to save money,” I thought it would taste better
homemade,” I complained. And although she didn’t have any sage advice, Toby did
keep me company on the phone while I took my turn as a bread machine, kneading my
concoction to near perfection.

    Next, on the docket was the actual cookie. I selected
shortbread for a variety of reasons. First they are an excellent dunking
cookie, delicious with tea and they hold their shape when baking better than
the benchmark sugar cookie.

    Baking cookies might seem simple enough, but I’m known for getting
distracted, missing the timer and inevitably scorching entire batches. This time was
no different. I tried, but when the timer went off they just didn’t&quot;look&quot;done.
So I gave them just a little longer. A little too long, I tried again, but they
all had a bit of a tan. No matter I would cover that right up with fondant.

    ( Shortbread dough) 

   (a bit over baked) 

 
      Saturday morning, I was exhausted.
I had to take Henry to the hospital after he had trouble breathing during
gymnastics on Wednesday. It turned out he had strep and pneumonia.  

  ( Henry waiting at the hospital in Mt. Vernon) 
 

    As a result,
he’d been teary and needy and had quite a bit of trouble sleeping. A mother’s
work is never done and all, I got up and realized that after three days of unexpected
confinement I was out of the essentials, chicken feed, alfalfa pellets and
coffee. I would have resort again to my emergency stash, the three-year old
Costco-size can of Yuban™ Tom bought for some work camping trip. In my haze I
accidentally grabbed the can of Crisco™.

    “That might taste better than the
Yuban™,” Mike laughed over the phone. “I’ll bring some coffee today when I
drive up”. Mike as usual was coming up for the holiday weekend.

    Properly caffeinated I pulled out
my decorating tips, laid out my new non-stick “fondant mat”, selected a rolling
pin and took my tangerine, sky blue, leaf green, lemon yellow, rose and jet
black food colorings out of the cupboard. The first step was to prepare some
butter cream icing. I added just a splash of almond extract for some zing. The
butter cream icing is like mastic when tiling. You slather a thin layer on the
cookie before applying the fondant; otherwise the fondant would slide right
off.

    To color the fondant, I learned you take toothpicks with
food coloring and knead it into the “dough”. The color slabs are then rolled
out quite easily and cut with the same cookie cutter used to make the actual cookie,
creating the perfect fit. I don’t know what I was expecting, but I did not
expect it to be as effortless as it turned out. There was one casualty; however,
one of the bunnies did have ear damage. Calmly I performed triage. Turning the
bunny over I took some butter cream frosting and asliver of fondant creating a
bandage of sorts.

    Once all the cookies were covered with their first two coats
of icing, it was time to make the third in the trifecta, the royal icing, for
the details. The finishing touch. I began with the flowers. They were my least
favorite cookies for some reason and I decided to make my mistakes there,
perfecting my icing flow before moving on to my favorites, the baby geese.

    ( Baby geese in progress) 

  (getting there) 

  (Icing tools)
  
 

    I even got tricky – making little balls of fondant and
mixing colors, creating “decorated” eggs. With newfound confidence I really
went nuts creating bunny necklaces using one of my fancy-dancy decorating tips.
Not being able to leave well enough alone I added centers to the little bunny
necklaces. I assessed the cookies. I was pleased. I didn’t know if they’d taste
any good, but they did look cute. The kitchen on the other hand was a disaster,
Mike was arriving and we had to get ready for church. Hurriedly, I rinsed
everything off and ran the dishwasher. Then so I could give them to Lisa after
Mass, I carefully layered the cookies in some tissue I had in the Harry Potter
room under the stairs. Throwing a touch of ribbon around the outside of the
plastic case I finished and got ready for church just in the nick of time.

  ( baby geese - done) 

  (ready for packing) 
 
 

    Lisa called in the morning as she does every Easter. I answered
the phone, “He is Risen!” She said as she does every Easter. “You heard me! And my those
bunny necklaces! You really out did yourself,” she gushed and I swelled with
pride. Those bunny necklaces really were something. “How did you get everything
so smooth?” She asked.

    “That is fondant.” I explained.

 March 4th Bugged 
 
   (On our way to town we saw two eagles looking for their morning meal in the South Fork Valley - ) 

 
      Grumbling, I sat waiting in front of the Harris Café for
about twenty-minutes before I ventured inside. I was meeting my dad and sister
for breakfast and I had hoped to be done and get back to work on my apple trees
before 10:00. Lisa was driving and I absolutely knew my she would be late,
she’s always late except for work, but that’s only because of some promise to
God she made a thousand years ago. She hadn’t spoken to Him on my behalf.
Forever a fool and a perhaps a glutton for punishment I got there early and
called my dad’s temporary U.S. cell phone.

    “Are you two almost here?” I asked hopefully.

    “You know your sister we haven’t even left yet, she’s doing
some @^&amp;*$%# thing with Phoebe’s hair,” he practically wailed.

    “OK, then. I’m here,” I sighed snapping the phone closed with
attitude before scanning the sunny yellow room for a table. I spied a
sun-drenched table for two in the window and boldly pulled over another chair.
This was just what the doctor ordered, a nice dose of vitamin d. I sank into
the chair and nodded gratefully to the smiling waitress who asked me if I’d
like some coffee. Once again, I was waiting, my mind racing as I soaked in the
warm sunshine in the bustling cafe.

  ( butterfly - mixed media) 
 

    I looked around and noticed a painting on the wall. Tom came
to mind; he’s been falling behind on his painting. Mental note: gentle reminder
or nag Tom if necessary. I thought about him mixing mediums like the painting
on the wall and wondered if he should paint on some of our old barn wood. I
took another relaxing sip of coffee and thought about my dad. The reason we
were coming together. He was leaving, going back to Paris for another year. It
was strange really, this annual visit. I’d imagined it a lot differently. I
thought he’d come out to the farm and help me with some of my more difficult
projects. Help me with the cattle and clean the barn. I saw us fixing dinner
and chatting over a glass of wine, but that’s not exactly how it went. He was
at Lisa’s most of the time. No hard feelings, she’s closer to town, which means he can go and listen to his friends and sit-in for a number or two and he gets gigs. –   The funny thing is
he never ever calls when he’s in France. Lisa and I told ourselves this is
because of his bad hearing. Not so. When he’s here he calls France as many as
three times a day. C’est la vie.

      My mind wandered to Henry and Grandpa Horn. My dad had taken
it fairly well, when Henry said he wanted to switch instruments. My dad had
even generously suggested Henry rent one of his horns to another kid in the bad
to pay for the oboe rental. My dad’s an ex-Catholic and no saint. He did his
best to help Henry see the light. “There’s nothing for an oboe to play anyway.
You’ll sound like a snake charmer,” and the like. But to Henry’s credit, he
stood up to the old man. Which my father did like and thus began fondly calling
him, “Oboe One”.   I smiled to
myself at the rebellion. My father loved that part even if he didn’t like the
oboe. “You’ve got to like what you play or you won’t practice. Why you’d like
the oboe over the horn, any horn, I don’t know.” He persisted affably.

      I took another gulp of coffee after the server slogged it
full. It was hot, hot, hot. I loved it. I considered taking off my jacket now that
the morning sun was baking through the window. I leaned closer to the glass
careful not to touch it lest I feel the chill of the Spring air. My eyes fell
on a bug. It was a brown innocuous bug. Neither a mosquito nor a fly. Obviously
it was no ladybug. Entranced by the bug tapping on the glass I stared at it
wondering if it would find it’s way out. It could see the green leaves and
blossoms on the trees. It felt the sunshine and wanted to go out and live.
Instead it was stuck behind glass. It was safe. There was plenty of food and
water in here. He didn’t have to do anything. I bet hundreds of his brothers
and sisters wanted him to stay close to town and not struggle so hard, but my
little bug wanted something different. It wanted to take chances and feel the
danger. It wanted out and I felt it was my sole responsibility to liberate my
brown buddy.

    I remembered I had a caramel-colored coffee cup in my purse
– for emergencies- you never know when you’re going to have to scoop something
or be offered a cup of something. The farm equivalent of the sleuth’s hairpin
for picking locks. I unsnapped the strap and opened my chocolate leather bag
pulling out the cup Awesomez had given me with FARM GIRL printed across it.
Carefully, I tried to trap my new friend, a kindred spirit. He didn’t want my
brand of help, he knew in his heart he should be able to do it on his own. He
felt inferior with this Gulliver coming to his rescue. Obstinate he was. I had
to stop trying to save him, because he simply kept thwarting my efforts. I
didn’t want to smash his tiny legs and then he moved into the perfect position.
I slapped the cup right over the top of him, slid my menu between the cup and
the glass and transported him to freedom. I watched him flutter away and land
in a tree. Silly, I was euphoric as I went back to my seat.

I considered taking off my jacket again, but had another cup of coffee instead as I sat there waiting, happily.

 February 22nd Lost&amp;Found 
 
  ( Searching for Henry)   (Crazy Canada guy)

   (USA - fans) 

  (Canada Moose)
 
 

  (Chinese fans- ready to cheer) 
 

   “Look for the goat hat!” Phoebe called as we made our way through the tented makeshift section of the venue. In no time flat we promptly located Olympic goat boy standing near
the entrance next to a group of Chinese curling zealots. He was waving literally trying to flag us down.

      “I turned on my phone, but no one else had there’s on,” he recalled tears streaming down his face. Quinn and Lindsey peered at me sheepishly
and we shrugged. 

    ( Henry trying to get someone to notice him) 

    We sat down in our seats and soaked in the
atmosphere. The cool blues and greens of the 2010 games were tranquil. Perfect for the winter. The
flags flying over the ice filled me with a sense of pride. I remembered sitting
in front of the television with my parents watching Jim McKay on ABC as Munich
unfolded. I thought of the “Up Close and Personal” segments that inspired me
and put me in complete awe of anyone who could dedicate themselves through
adversity. I thought back to when my father had had Mark Spitz over to swim in our pool. Lisa and I had been legends of Round Meadow Elementary. I couldn’t believe I was finally sitting at an Olympic event. I could feel my eyes well up.

   (The flags) 

  ( The stadium- who knew curling was such a big event) 

  (the official beginning)
 
 

      “Mom? Can you paint my face?” Henry asked whipping out some
pens he&apos;d had the foresight to bring along. 

      “Ok, but I’m not your father,” I reminded him. 

      “I know, but you’re here,” he said. 

      “Gee thanks,” I said grabbing the pens. I suddenly had a
vision and got to work. It took me longer than I thought. 

      “Not bad Denise, will you do me next?” Phoebe asked. 

      “I guess, OK all done,” I said after working diligently for
some time.  

      “Thanks Mama,” Henry said and looked me directly in the eyes,
“So it says Zimbabwe right?”  

      “You’re just like your father,” I said smacking him.

 We bought the little radio they sold at the concession stand
so we’d know what was going on. And actually were lucky enough to sit next to a
couple who knew quite a bit about curling. We learned about peeling and how
heavy the rocks are. 

      “I heard they were equivalent to three marmots,” Henry
chimed in. 

      “You know that’s how they named Whistler,” Lisa added, “because
of the whistling sound marmots make”. 

      “Really?” Chris marveled at his wife’s prowess. Lisa laughed.  

    &quot;I&apos;m not really that brilliant I heard it on the opening ceremonies, you fell asleep&quot;.

     We were glued to the match. We willed our stones toward the target as our Olympic team battled Sweden. We didn&apos;t exactly understand the game, but we traded around the radio in an attempt to get a more insightful appreciation. Nonetheless, we agonized as Sweden
systematically knocked our stones out of the target area dashing our hopes of a
win. As we sat waiting for Sweden to throw their stone, wondering if they&apos;d throw a guard to block or a stone to score, we heard,

     (unfortunately it was a waste of $20.00- the broadcasters barely spoke of the event. They yammered on about all sorts of other topics rather than giving insight into what was happening) 

  (Team USA Curling) 

  (Sweden&apos;s Ladies Olympic Curling Team)

  (Curling video assist) 

  (&quot;So do you think that&apos;s the  

 Zam-Broomie?&quot;Lisa cracked herself up)
 
 

  (Sweden takes a moment to strategize after Team USA threw there stone )
  
 

     “Go Sweden Go!” From Quinn? 

      “Uh, you do know we’re playing them right?” Lisa said
dripping with sarcasm. 

      &quot;Yes, but no one has cheered for them all night,” Quinn
informed her. 

      “They are killing us you realize?” Lisa responded. 

      “How would you feel if no one cheered for you in the
Olympics?” Quinn answered. “I’m on the world team”. 

      “Me too,” Lindsey concurred. And they joined in as the Chinese
fans did their call and response chant again. In Chinese. 

      “I don’t know what the heck we’re saying but we’re coming as close as
we can,” Quinn laughed until she could barely sit up. 

  ( Quinn&amp;Lindsey Go Chinese!)
  

     &quot;“They’re probably saying – you don’t know what we’re saying
but we’re going to kick your butts,” Lisa laughed. “Hey look, there’s the family from
Orcas Island.” 

      Meanwhile patriotism was a live and well and residing in my
son who couldn’t stop waving the flag Chris bought as we walked in the stadium. A nearby cameraman kept shooting Henry as two Canadian women who had a little too
much alcohol heckled him relentlessly. 

    “C-A-N-A-D-A - every day -And Stanford sucks too!” She sneered at Henry, “Anything’s better even Brown and Dartmouth!” Henry said
nothing, kept his eyes straight ahead but waved his flag again. I turned to my sister, who was now sitting
next to me.

   ( Heckler ) 

    “Um, they do realize those schools are in the United States
right?” I whispered to my sister.

      “They’re sore because they lost the hockey game today,”
Henry said insightfully. 

      “I don’t care! Excuse me! Excuse me! Ladies! Do you realize
you’re yelling at a 12-year old at the Olympic games? He’s only twelve, please leave him
alone,” Lisa defended Henry. 

    &quot;Huh, we thought he was a freshman,&quot;she murmured.

   (all the matches are right next to each other - everything happening at once.) 

     (I understand one of the curlers on Team Germany was 4 to 5 months pregnant) 

  (China vs. Canada) 

  (Proof we were there) 

   

  (Henry Quinn and Lindsey pose)
 
 
      After Lindsey and Quinn and the rest of us helped cheer
China to victory over Canada in a nail-biting shootout we began the long cold
trek back to the train. Phoebe was practically walking in her sleep when Henry
hailed down a taxi. Chris tried to make a run for it feigning a limp when he
saw a man in a wheelchair was the other potential passenger. 

      “Chris! I think you can go to Hell for that!” Lisa yelled.
And we walked on. 

      “1-2-3-where’s Lindsey?” 

      “I’m right here!” 

      At the signal light just before the train we ran into a
group of American flags. 

      “Denise? Is that you?” I couldn’t have been more surprised
who would know me in Canada? “We were at curling too! Wasn’t it great? I didn’t
know anything about it before but it was exciting to see that shoot out!” he
said with enthusiasm giving me a hug. “Hey, I’m Joe” he said turning to Henry
who put out his hand. 

      “Joe’s going to be our new tenant,” I explained. 

      “Nice flag,” Henry admired. 

  ( Fireman Joe Spring) 
 

      “You too,” Joe laughed. 

      “Amy’s moving out?” Quinn lamented. I gave her the elbow to
shut up. 

      “Yes, Amy has to live closer to be on call for the hospital
she works for in Mt. Vernon. So Joe and his girlfriend Kate and their dog Rugby
will be moving in. Joe’s was a history major, lived in France and is a fireman,”
I informed the group and bid Joe farewell. 

      Once on the midnight train, we decided to make a long
evening even endless. 

  (everyone slowed down the moment the train began to move)

   (even Canada lost their pep) 
 

      “C’mon let’s go see the flame,” Lisa encouraged. “You know
you’ll be so bummed if you don’t,” she said to Chris. 

      “We’re all up for it aren’t we?” I asked the kids, who
sleepily nodded. And so after a short snooze on the train they rallied. We asked some of the volunteer Olympic&quot;Smurfs&quot;which way to go and they instructed us it was only a short twenty minute walk. So we marched along down the streets of Vancouver. There was no denying it is a lovely city.  

  ( Denise and Lindsey en route to the flame) 
 

  ( we keep walking toward the flame) 
 

   When the flame finally came into view, it took my breath away. I know it&apos;s just fire, but I&apos;m an emotional basket-case and it&apos;s symbolic of so much more. Peace, unity, sacrifice, determination. My eyes welled up again. People from every country speaking in different languages
helped each other take pictures of their families. And then there they were,
our Orcas Island family. We took their picture and they took ours. We smiled,
shook hands and shared one of the most memorable moments in our lives.

   (Holding the flag- Henry marches in) 
 

   (The FLAME )

   (me, Henry,Chris, Quinn, Phoebe,Lisa, Lindsey) 
 

  (Our Olympic friends from Orcas Island) 
 

    Just then, my phone rang. “Hello?” 

     “Hey! I saw you guys on CNBC!” Tom yelled into the phone. 

      “Really? Tom saw us on TV!” 

    &quot;OHMIGOSH TOM SAW US ON TV&quot;Phoebe squealed.

    “Yep! I could see Lisa and the face painting,&quot;Tom confirmed,&quot;and Quinn and Lindsey
chanting with the Chinese? What was that all about?” 

      “They’re on team world,” I informed him. 

      &quot;We’re at the flame now&quot;. 

     &quot;Oh I was wondering, it&apos;s really late,&quot;He said concerned. 

     I’ll call you when we get home,” I assured him,&quot;but I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll be there until about 3:00AM&quot; 

      Exhausted, we retracing our steps when Chris started walking toward a hotel. He figured
we could pick up a cab from there to our car as we didn’t know where were now
in relation to where we parked. 

      As we walked up Chris asked, “Hey can we call a cab from
here?” 

      “Um, Andrew do we call cabs for Americans?” one of the guys laughed
to the other. 

      “Come on now,” Lisa joined in, “It’s the only way to get us
out of the country”. 

      “In that case, where do you want to go?” Chris told him the
cross streets. “Nope, you don’t want a cab you’re only three blocks away. If
you’re tired, have the kids carry you” he smiled. “Another boy with an American
flag – how many are there anyway?” We were all enjoying the good-natured
rivalry trading barbs and the kids loved the attention. 

      “OK everyone follow me,” Chris bellowed. It was about 1:00
in the morning by now, but strangely no one was complaining or really very
tired anymore. We were again filled with excitement of the day and we knew where we were going. Henry, Lindsey and I were separated
by about a block from the rest of the group when a man jumped out of the shadows practically giving me a heart attack. He raised his hand for Henry to give a high five. I breathed a sigh of relief. I felt vulnerable and wanted to catch up with the rest of the group. 

      “Mama, you know, this is the most American I’ve ever felt,”
Henry said as we continued walking back to the car. 

      Behind us we heard footsteps getting closer on the quiet
street. I glanced behind me to see a Canadian man dressed in red and white from
head to toe. He was a large guy who kept gaining on us slowly. As we were all about to cross the street he yelled with shocking venom 

    “ F&amp;*@ You Kid !” directly at Henry.I worried at what Henry would do. I didn’t want any
violence. The man was obviously drunk. But Henry was only twelve, so I had no
idea how he would handle the situation and there wasn’t time to discuss it. I
held my breath as I saw Henry turn to the man.

      “That was nice,” he responded sweetly and walked on. I could
breathe. He did have a brain in his head. 

     Shaken, a bit Lindsey, Henry and I stopped to regroup once the belligerent hockey fan veered around a corner. I hugged Henry and Lindsey told him how great he&apos;d handled the situation. Just then, Henry pulled an American flag out of some weeds in a planter.  

     &quot;Mama look! Someone lost their flag! Can I keep it?&quot;He asked. 

     I suppose so, we&apos;re in Canada and no one&apos;s coming back for it at this hour,&quot;I relented. 

     &quot;Look it&apos;s got a signature in the stars!&quot;He exclaimed.&quot;I wonder whose name this is.&quot;He marveled,&quot;Do you suppose it&apos;s an Olympian?&quot; 

    &quot;It certainly could be,&quot;I surmised as we walked down the lonely street.

  ( the yet unknown signature) 
 

     We piled in the car and after filling
tummies with hamburgers and fries the kids fell asleep. Lisa, Chris and I drove
in silence chit chatting here and there about some of the exciting parts of the
day until we got to the border. I took out the passports “1-2-where’s
Lindsey’s?” I mumbled to myself as I dug into the camera bag again and pulled
it out. 

      The border agent asked where we’d been, shared in the glory
of the hockey game and cajoled with Chris. “Welcome Home folks, have a good
night,” he said as we drove through. 

      “London 2012?” Chris suggested.

 February 21st Olympic Odyssey 
 
   (Lindsey) 


     Lindsey had a whole week off of school for mid-winter break and
since her mother would be teaching skiing lessons at Mammoth all week she
begged Awesomez to let her come to the farm.

      “Do you really think you’re up for another one of my
children?” Awesomez asked me over the phone. 

      “Is that some sort of warning?” I asked. “Actually, I just
hope Lindsey isn’t bored. I don’t have anything big planned,” I explained. 

      I went to Seattle with Nick to pick her up while my dad took Henry to gymnastics. Everyone was
excited to see her, especially her brother.  

   (&quot;The Big-un&quot;Irish was especially happy to see Lindsey) 
    (Lindsey snuggles The Big Boy - Irish) 
 

 During the days Lindsey helped me
with farm chores and errands, during the afternoons she went to gymnastics with
Henry or volleyball with Quinn and saw Nick at night. 

      She saw Grandpa
Horn teach band, she helped with the judging at one of Henry’s meets and she
met all of Quinn’s friends. She did homework, painted and kept me company.

   (Nick - hanging out)
 
 
      On Saturday while at Henry’s gymnastic meet, Chris turned to
me and said, “We were kind of thinking of driving up to Vancouver tomorrow, you
game?”

      “You want to go to the games? The tickets were $600.00 the
last time we checked,” I said. 

      “Well, we’d like to get into something, Lisa’s checking for
some last minute deals but really we thought we just go up and soak in some
Olympic atmosphere and see what we see,” he offered. 

      I thought about it, I’d had plans we were finally going to
try and go get Petite, but that could be postponed. Then there was the problem
of Nick. He couldn’t seem to follow any of the rules at home or school so he
was not going to be allowed to join us. And then I wasn’t sure if Lindsey even
had her passport. We couldn’t go without Lindsey. Luckily, Lindsey’s brilliant
mother had the foresight to pack her passport. We were good to go. 

      The next morning, we met the Donaldson clan at Nugent’s Corner
and all piled into their van. Henry had hurriedly painted red U-S-A posters to
take with us “just in case”. The paint was still wet so we put them on the
dashboard to dry and headed north. 

      Crossing into Canada is one of my least favorite things to
do, but if we wanted to go to the Olympics, we had no choice. I prepared the
kids. “Now remember, these people have not one ounce of humor in their bodies.
You don’t kid, joke or in any way say something sarcastic. Don’t get nervous,
just speak if you’re spoken to, don’t add any information, just answer the
question being asked”. I instructed. 

      “And don’t forget your name!” Lisa added. 

      “What?” Lindsey questioned. 

      “Henry got so nervous once, he forgot his name,” Quinn
informed her. 

      “It was just enough of a hesitation for the guy to think I’d
kidnapped him” I said dryly, giving my child a look. 

      We approached the border and took a collective breath. If
the kids didn’t believe me before, they did afterward. Lindsey was grilled and
questioned until she was close to a nervous wreck. She answered everything
calmly as the Canadian border guard checked all the missing child reports. 

      “Who makes you breakfast?” He looked at her seriously. I
wondered what she was gong to say. I hadn’t really made a real breakfast. 

      “She does,” Lindsey said pointing to me. 

      “Do you know her name?” He asked seriously.I worried she was going to forget my name. 

      “Denise,” Lindsey answered. Whew. 

      “Do you have a note from the mother?” He asked me. 

      “No. I don’t, but she did provide the passport,” I offered. 

      “You see where I’m going with this?” He asked. 

      “Yes Sir and I’d be glad you were asking these questions if
it was my child,” I said knowing I wasn’t doing anything wrong, but feeling as
though I somehow looked guilty. 

      “Do you have any proof of your flight?” He asked. And with
all the excitement of a contestant on “Let’s Make a Deal.” Lindsey answered 

      “Yes! I have my airline ticket!” She searched her pursed and
offered him her ticket. He let us pass. 

      &quot;That was certainly the golden ticket, it’s what tipped the
scales in our favor. Way to go Lindsey,” Chris praised her. 

      “You handled that beautifully,” Lisa added, “Denise do you
make breakfast?” 

    “I know, I was wondering if Cheerios™ and bagels counted,” I smirked.

      “It’s a good thing you warned me,” Lindsey said depleted. 

      From there we made our way onto the King’s Highway and set
our course. 

      “How long until we get there?” Phoebe asked somewhat
predictably. 

      “I have no idea, Honey. You act as though I’ve been there.
We’re just figuring it out as we go,” Chris informed her as the glare of
Henry’s USA posters baked in the sunshine reflecting on the windshield. 

     (Henry&apos;s U S A sign reflecting) 
  

    We parked and joined the party that was Vancouver. Walking
down the packed streets you could feel the goodwill. We formed a buddy system,
I took pictures of the kids in what they were wearing – just in case – and we
set up our if-you-get-lost plan.

    ( Canada hats) 
  

     “Look there’s Italy!” Henry called out. 

   (Italy) 
 

      “And Russia!” Lindsey yelled as she saw a red jacket walk
by. 

 
 

      “I want one of those USA hats,” Phoebe announced. 

      “I want a pin,” Lisa said, “I didn’t get one in ’84 when I
went to the equestrian events and I really want one this time”. 

      “I want tickets to an event,” Henry insisted. “I don’t care
what it is, I just want to go to something”. And so did I. So Lisa, Henry,
Phoebe and I took up the hunt as Quinn, Lindsey and Chris meandered slowly captivated
by the street carnival. Every time I turned around I couldn’t help but count
the kids. I felt like I was on a field trip.

        “1-2-3-where’s Lindsey?” I asked. 
 

          “I’m right here,” she said practically under my arm. 

          Not knowing where we were going, we followed the crowd
across Vancouver in a hurried pace. We didn’t know where but we knew we had to
get there soon if we wanted tickets. Henry approached every scalper he passed,
but they were mostly buying not selling. 

      “Your mother would be crying by now,” I told Lindsey as she
caught up. 

      “I know, right? She’d still be back at the car. She walks so
slowly,” Lindsey said laughing. 

      “I’m so happy to hear you use an adverb,” I gushed. 

      “You’re such a teacher,” Lindsey smirked as we were in a
half jog along the street. 

      “Why are we going so fast?” Lindsey asked. 

      “’Cause we might miss something.” 

  ( en route to the ticket office)   (Blast we were behind Captain Canada)
  

      Lisa, Phoebe, Henry and I broke into a run, moving ahead of
the pack as we approached the Olympic ticket window. I knew my sister and we
both were thinking these people walking near us might oust us out of our
potential Olympic experience. We got to the line and eventually to the window. 

      “Is there anything? Anything within a modest budget?” she asked
the ticket agent. “We need seven seats”. 

      “Seven? Wow. Let me look”. And she looked and she looked and
we waited anxiously. “I have seven seats to women’s curling tonight”. 

      “Curling,” Lisa turned to the kids now surrounding us, “Do
you guys want to go to curling? Should we spend the money?” 

      “Hell Yes!! I’ll go to anything,” Henry yelled.  

    &quot;Henry you gave up swearing for Lent,&quot;I reminded him.

    &quot;Is Hell a swear word?&quot;

    &quot;YES!&quot;Lindsey said.

      “I don’t know anything about it, but I’m up for
curling,” Quinn agreed. 

      “Is that the one where they use the little brooms?” Phoebe
asked. 

      “Yes, it is, does that sound ok?” 

      “Sure it’s the Olympics,” Phoebe agreed. 

      “I’m with Henry I’ll go to anything,” Lindsey answered. 

      “Heck yeah, whooo! hooo! Curling!!! Let’s do it!” Chris
cheered in great zeal. As we stood there basking in our Olympic triumph we
noticed a family standing nearby somewhat despondent. They obviously didn’t get
any tickets.   Noticing them, Lisa
walked up and tried to help. 

      “Did you try getting seats for curling?” Lisa asked the
woman. As it turned out they were from Orcas Island and no she hadn’t tried
curling. So she got back in line and scored 5! Happily, we all struck up a
conversation before departing for the curling match? Curling meet? Curling
game? Curling event? Or curling tournament? We weren’t sure. 

     (proof we are really going) 

  (Lisa at the ticket office)
 
      Tickets in hand we were a bit more relaxed and ready to
learn about curling. After riding a train packed like a sardine the Canadian equivalent
of BART where I counted at every stop, “1-2-3-where’s Lindsey?” 

      “I’m right here,” she said. 

    ( On the train after it thinned) 

  (Lindsey and Phoebe walk and walk) 

  (pretty Vancouver)
 
   (Lindsey and Henry- ready to order)
 
         We stopped at a
Chinese restaurant for dinner where the kids had their own chopstick freestyle
event commentated by the Amazing Donaldson. Afterward we set out walking the
rest of the distance to the stadium. I was certainly getting all my steps in
for Weight Watchers I thought. 

      “You won’t believe it, but a cabbie just asked me where the
stadium is,” Chris laughed as we all continued walking. We walked and we walked
and we walked first down a busy street and then into a residential
neighborhood. There nary a sign marking the route. If it hadn’t for the rest of
the curling crowd we never would have found it. 

   (Quinn, Phoebe, Lindsey and Lisa on the move) 
 

  (lots of details)
 

   (security screening) 

  (we&apos;re in!) 

  (The Chinese are ready for curling)
  

    Excitedly we went in and found our seats. “1-2-where’s
Henry? He’s not here,” I informed the rest of the confused group.

      “He was with us at the entrance,” Lisa reminded me. 

      “He’s supposed to turn his cell phone on if he’s lost,” Quinn
reminded me. 

      “Do you think he will?” I asked getting mine out and about
to push the button. 

      “No,” Quinn and Lindsey answered as we all hurried back on a
sweep of the grounds. I had a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. My father
had filled me with too much child stealing information. My mind sorting through
similar memories looking for a match as I ran. I remembered another time Henry
had disappeared in a public place. It was in Macys when he was two. I was
shopping with my friend, Laura, Phoebe’s godmother. We had just turned our
heads for a moment and he was GONE. Frantically we looked, and eventually found
him hiding in one of the rounders...

 January 1st The Game of Life 
 


   (Bruno trying to get a Monopoly- stretching out - from Luther&apos;s bed to his new one - ) 
 

    New Year’s Eve is a time for reflection. What got
accomplished and what didn’t. I try to accentuate the positive, but after
taking a tally for the year I have to say 2009 was not my year. Sure there were
successes we built a chicken coop, the pond was filled with water again and we
got a snuggly bovine not to mention that gentle equine rapscallion, but in the
end – I’m more than ready to move on. 2010 for me is a hope for a better
tomorrow.   A hope for a pig or two,
the belief that I’ll be the hero of the family and make enough money so Tom can
move here full time.

    To this end, I spent much of the day allowing my superior Virgo
instincts to take control, stuffing my overly emotional Pisces moon to the
side. I began by making my new daily schedule. The key to success is
organization. I know this deep in my heart, just as I know butter is the secret
to happiness.

    Tom, Mike and I sat around in the kitchen in our pajamas
with big mugs a coffee as I held court. I began with goals for the first
quarter. Goals for Henry’s Honey, goals for weight loss, goals for Henry, goals
for Nick, goals for the house, goals for the farm, goals for Irish and goals
for Tom. After all a Virgo girl knows everyone in our life needs us to take
control and help each of them out a little bit, gently guiding each of them in
the right direction. It was just as I was about done that I heard Mike slinking
out of the room trying to escape. I have ears like a deer – ask any fifth
grader whoever tried to tell a secret in the back of my classroom. “Not so fast
Michael. I hear you skulking away,” I hollered into the hallway.

    “What?” He laughed. “I thought it best I exit about this
time. It seems it’s about my turn.”

    “I’ll leave you alone for now,” I promised like a cat
letting the mouse go – for a time.

    For dinner Tom thoughtfully cooked a delicious chicken
potpie from my Weight Watcher’s Comfort Classics Cookbook. We rented The Sting,
Julie&amp;Julia and Four Christmas’s then built a fire and settled in for a
comfy evening. We got a late start on the New Year by about twenty-five
minutes. Snap, we were already behind schedule.

   (black-eyed peas for prosperity in the New Year) 
 

    The next morning, I confirmed our plans with my sister
“We’re making black eyed peas…”

    “We were planning to come over around noon if that’s ok.”

    “That’s great, but I feel badly. We rented an auger this
weekend so we could get four days for the price of one and put up the arena
fence down by the barn. I just don’t think we can stop working until later in
the day.”

    “We’ll wear our work clothes then. Sounds fun. I’ve never used
an auger. I’ll tell Mike and Tom and we’ll be there as soon as possible.”

    “Really?,” she said a little surprised.

    &quot;You bet.&quot;I turned to Tom after hanging up. “The Donaldson’s need to
put up some fence so we’re gong to help them. She thought we be bummed.” He
laughed.

    “Do they know us?” He smirked.

    “I know right?” Henry interjected.

    “You mean we have to work?” Nick moaned, “That’s not my
job.”

    “Finally, something really fun to do over there.” I chirped
as I went to throw on my boots. I love a project.

  ( playing the parts of Ma&amp;Pa Kettle- a tired, rained on dirty pair of love birds - Chris&amp;Lisa - ) 

   ( Cody and Tom meet - while Phoebe cleans the corral) 
 

  ( Phoebe works hard) 

  (Mike&amp;Chris use the auger to get the posts in) 

    We got there and got to work in short order. Quinn made
dinner – chicken potpie from the Weight Watcher’s Comfort Classics Cookbook.

    “We just had that last night,” I laughed.

    “It’s OK, I could eat it for every meal,” Mike encouraged
her.

    “Me too!” Henry agreed wholeheartedly.

    “I really like it, it has a good taste. The fennel really
gives it a fuller richer flavor,” Tom concurred.

    I supervised the preparation while doing some other chores.
Quinn chopped onion, sautéed garlic, baked and shredded chicken, measured
broth, melted butter, combined ingredients and learned what a saucepan is.

    “I am never making a dinner that takes this long again,” she
whined until it was served to a bunch of very hungry fence builders who loved
it beyond measure.

    “Mom? Maybe I could make this again soon since you were
looking to pay me for doing some of the cooking.”

    “Really? I thought you,” I started as Quinn jabbed me
sharply in the ribs.

    Quinn, the quirky accident prone girl who thought she had a sixth toe one
morning, because she counted wrong and was immediately concerned that she might
have to pay a higher price for pedicures seems to have turned into a fairly
multi-talented teen. She&apos;s determined to save enough money for a car when she&apos;s sixteen and so she&apos;babysits and has a projected amount she needs to save a month for the next three years. So to add to her income she is teaching herself how to cut hair. She cooked dinner and then offered to cut Tom’s hair. She’s b has been practicing on Chris and needed some different hair.

   (Quinn is teaching herself) 

  (a lesson from the book - Chapter Seven&quot;How to cut short layers into the hair&quot;)
 
 

    “She gave me side bangs,” Phoebe said as she showed off her
new do.

    “Well, your bangs aren’t at all even,” I pointed out
critically. I hated to do it, but if I was going to consider having my hair
trimmed I might want to wait until she’s had some more practice.

    “That’s not my fault. She’s just annoying she keeps sweeping
that part over. She didn’t want me to cut it,” Quinn corrected as she leaned
forward and fixed Phoebe’s hair.

   (Phoebe chatting and laughing about her side bangs and her sister) 
 

    Tom took the risk as Quinn wrapped the towel around
him. “Oh my, the drape doesn’t reach entirely around your shoulders, they’re so
broad,” Quinn cooed.

    “She’s got the talk down. She’ll some make good tips.” Tom
offered.

  ( Quinn is ready to cut tom&apos;s hair) 

  (Quinn hard at work on Tom&apos;s hair - he looks a little nervous)
  

    “Hmm. Let’s see do you think boys are going to pay five
dollars to let Quinn cut their hair? Yeah, I’m going to say they’re going to
line-up,” Mike concurred.

    “Your next Mike,” I laughed.

    “ I&apos;m game”.

     “ Considering it’s
our Quinnie, I think she should call it Running With Scissors,” Lisa smirked.

    “That’s a great name, Running With Scissors.” Tom said
enthusiastically. “ Running With Scissors that’s it absolutely.”

After the men were sheared, we played the board game, Ticket to Ride , endlessly and about
thirty-five rounds of Bingo.

   (endless hours of family fun) 
 

  (Henry calls Bingo)
 

    “I hope you’ll all be here for Swingin’ Singles Night on
Saturday – that’s B -4 as in before you get married,” Henry called in his velvety
announcer voice.

    Tom won the lion’s share with his lucky card. Quinn was
second then the Pheeb. Everyone played one card, but me. I had five. I figured I&apos;d improve my odds.

  ( Tom and his Bingo card) 

  (Phoebe hates that Tom doesn&apos;t put a chip on the FREE section of the Bingo card)
  

     “Denise, you played a lot more than the rest of us.
You must feel like five times the loser. Hey, great start to the New Year by
the way,” Chris chortled snickering at his own joke in an asthmatic sort of way.&quot;Hey you guys coming back tomorrow? 

  ( some of my cards -)

 October 23rd Sweet Smell of Success 
 
  ( Mosquito Lake Road all dressed up) 

    Irish is a life-size Winnie the Pooh only entirely too smart. Somehow he managed to figure out how to turn the spigot on the giant honey container we kept in the kitchen. Honey oozed everywhere. I only discovered it because I heard the repetitive smacking of happy dog lips coming from the kitchen. We no longer use that container – and rest assured it was only our personal honey.

  (retired honey bucket) 

    To introduce Henry’s Sweet Miracle Honey™ and Henry’s Stingers™ Henry cheerfully made our display for the Everybody Store Cheese Fest. I gave him the basic information that needed to be included and he set to work drawing, printing, organizing and coloring.    Henry has to do almost all the work to give it that authentic “kid feel”. He created the honey display much the way he would have had it been for the Science Fair.

    At the same time Henry was cutting and pasting bee facts, I was staining and stuffing the Auction basket for the Humane Society. We were donating an oil painting (Tom did), some honey, some Stingers™ and a “Bee Experience” – an afternoon where the winning bidders get to come out and don bee suits, learn about hive life from Henry and Mike, tend to the bees and then extract honey from the comb and have it on some hot corn bread with lemonade.

   (Henry&apos;s pepper) 

   (fresh from Michaels) 

  (in progress)

 

  (Henry&apos;s Sweet Miracle Honey™ labels fresh off the printer from Tom) 

   

 

 
  (Whoo hooo!)


 

  (Henry doing heat seals) 

  (jars galore)
 
 

 

 

    To add another layer to an already busy night we had to put labels and safety seals on all the products. And- were also giving out Stinger™ straws for each plate at the $1000.00 a table Humane Society Masquerade Gala. Each person was to have a Stingers™ at the top of their dinner plate with a label tied on with a small portion of green pipe cleaner.   The labels were specially made with Chris&apos;s help directing the guests to our new website and encouraging them to enter their email addresses. It told of Henry’s desire to donate a portion of the profits to the preservation of honeybees and offered a chance to win stuff! I thought this was going to be wonderful. It was our big chance to get in front of more than 250 people not on food stamps that have an obvious concern for the environment and who participate and support local products. I was thrilled. Only FedEx did not deliver. Tom sent the labels two-day guaranteed delivery for 3:00PM. But they never arrived and what’s worse FedEx had no explanation as to why.

    “I’m sorry it looks as though the package has gone all over the place and has been in Seattle since 11:00 this morning.” A man said somewhat apologetically.

    “I saw that on the tracking information. My question is – why? I could have driven to Seattle and gotten them by now.” I was more than annoyed. My plans were going by the wayside quickly.

    “I have no idea why. I’m sorry, but the facility the package is at is just a sorting facility, they don’t deliver. I don’t know why it ended up there.

    “So that’s it then? I can’t even get them delivered to the event tomorrow?” I asked resigned.

    “Honestly, I doubt it. “ He said more apologetically. So at 7:00 PM after my fifteenth phone call I finally accepted the labels were going to spend another couple days in a warehouse in Seattle and I tried to figure out what to do next.

    Tom suggested sending the file to a Kinkos™ and trying to reprint and cut them all over again. That would cost a fortune and I had to be at the ding-dang Cheese Fest by 9:00AM. So I nixed this idea. Amy suggested we reconfigure a version of the Stingers™ label in Photoshop™ and print a placard for each table. That sounded good and Amy, Henry and I worked for quite a while on doing just that. Then my sister told me that was a no-go because you had to pay to do that as a sponsor. So in the end they got stuck in a vase without any real label other than “try one – spicy” and put next to our donation.   No one did. We got back almost as many as we sent.

  ( Amy hanging out and getting wrangled in) 

   (ready for the auction) 

 

   (Henry and Mike, Tom&apos;s oil on raw burlap, Henry&apos;s Sweet Miracle Honey™ and Henry&apos;s Stingers™)
 

   (Lisa as the King of Pop and Chris as Julia Child on their way to the Humane Society Gala - Lisa is on the Board of Directors - did I mention Lisa can moonwalk?) 

    Meanwhile back at the honey house Henry put the finishing touches on his display and together we double-checked our list of supplies we’d need to load in the van in the morning.

   (I didn&apos;t want to make a turkey out of myself and forget something) 

  (Silence checking everything twice) 

  (this is the result of a turkey stepping off the top of the rabbit hutch and on to my face - Richard lost his balance - nothing a little make-up wouldn&apos;t fix- lucky my eye didn&apos;t get any closer)

 

    Once at the Everybody Store, I set up the display and the rest was all Henry. He got into his beekeeper suit and went to work. Jeff moseyed out to see what all the fuss was about and gave it the skeptical once over. “Safety seals huh? Professional. Nice display” was all he said and went back inside with a jingle of the bells on the front door. I think he thought Henry would stick to it for about six minutes. But Henry is my child. He waved at cars motioned for them to come in and asked everyone who even came near the store if they would like to taste some of his “special” honey. He was like a Girl Scout selling cookies to the 4 th power.

    Every time someone rang up a jar of Henry’s I could hear Jeff mumble, “He’s sure selling a lot of honey.” This is primarily because Amy decided the store wouldn’t be involved in any of the honey money. Henry simply gave his honey customers a ticket, they paid at the register and then Jeff would give him / us cash at the end of the day.   

  (Henry working) 

  (our tagline&quot;Give bees a chance&quot;)

 

  (giving Stingers™ samples) 

  (Henry and John from Peterson Cheese)


 

    The Cheese Fest rolled on quietly. There were cheeses aged in caves and cheeses with truffles and somehow Henry got the cheese expert, John, to drizzle Stingers™ on some of the brie. “It’s really good this way. I think I’m going to mention it to the chef at the Silver Reef Casino” the Peterson rep told me “Maybe Peterson should carry it.” He thought out loud.

    While in the midst of giving a sample of triple cream Bavarian Blue to a woman, I noticed a familiar face in the crowd. I looked at the woman, who smiled back at me and realized it was Roberta, my mail lady.

    “You weren’t home and this package needs a signature,” she explained as she patiently waited by the deli case. I was incredulous. I do live in Mayberry. FedEx left my package in some warehouse while my local post office stopped in at the Everybody Store Cheese Fest for my signature? My faith was restored. I thanked her profusely, signed for the package and tucked it behind Henry’s honey table for later.   

    At the end of the day, when I got off work, Henry was invited with the “Big boys” to go play handball. I cleaned up and loaded the van. Henry had sold two cases and Jeff asked to be cut in on the action for tomorrow. He wanted Henry back with his display. “The kid’s a shill,” Jeff grunted. This was high praise from Mr. Margolis.

  (a fiery display on the old Mosquito Lake Road)

    As Henry walked back from the handball court along side the railroad tracks, he looked very Opie Taylor and it warmed my heart. We head home and he was full of stories of customers and tastings. He suggested changes for tomorrow. He wanted more crackers and popcorn, the pears didn’t hold up throughout the day. “They started to get brown and people don’t like that.” He explained wriggling out of his bee suit. “Alexis said he couldn’t believe how much honey I sold. Maybe I can do this every weekend,” he said as Irish smelling honey sharked around the kitchen counter looking for his opportunity.

 September 11th All My Children 
 
    

 ( Franklin, Richard and Silence- say good morning) 
All I wanted to do was sleep after I took the boys to
school. I figured I’d earned a little rest, the barn could wait, the honey
business could wait, the laundry could definitely wait, but Lisa called. Phoebe
was sick again and Lisa was working at the Cat Clinic. “I know you’ve been
crazy busy, but could you do some of your work here?” She asked. She needed me
and how could I turn down the Pheeb?


 

 

    “Sure. No problem.” I said, so Luther, Vivian and Bruno
who’d already been promised a ride in the car came along. On the way, Amy called.&quot;I have bad news.&quot;

    &quot;What? Are you OK?&quot;

    &quot;I&apos;m OK, but the front gate isn&apos;t. I thought my car was in neutral, but apparently it wasn&apos;t and I smashed through the gate. Do you hate me?

    &quot;Huh, well at least your ok. Is it standing?&quot;

    &quot;It&apos;s standing, I wired it up with Andrew.&quot;

    &quot;That&apos;s good, at least the animals won&apos;t go into the road.&quot;I said. Thinking one step forward, two steps back.

&quot;I&apos;l pay for it to be fixed.&quot; 

    &quot;That&apos;s sweet, but I just don&apos;t know who we could get to come all they way out to do it. But we can think about that tomorrow. At least your ok and it&apos;s standing.&quot;

    &quot;So much for the quiet tenant who keeps to herself. First the deer and the truck in the ditch and now this,&quot;she laughed nervously. I thought back to turning twenty and remembered plenty of kooky mishaps, none of them Amy would make, she&apos;s too mature. 





   (oops) 









  ( Bruno and Charlie play,play,play) 



    By the time I got to Lisa&apos;s I needed another strong pot of coffee.Phoebe was no problem, she never is. She was riveted to
Erica Kane and drank all the apple juice I gave her. “How’s school?”   I asked trying to avoid paying my
bills.

    “I don’t know, I have barely even been to the fourth grade
yet I’m sick all the time. My tonsils are pretty yucky,” she said ruefully.
“How’s Nick doing?”

    “He’s having a hard time, lonely for his friends in Mammoth.
He doesn’t really talk to anyone except some kid in World Lit that sits next to
him.”

    “That’s too bad,” she said sleepily as she and Luther
settled in for yet another nap. Since she didn’t need me, I started looking
into honey label options for Henry’s Sweet Ass Honey™ and ordered sample jars
for Tom to work with.



   (Phoebe&amp;Luther resting) 
    Lisa came home and we discussed her barn plans, horses and
how much my wood shavings cost for my winter barn bedding. We were deep into
counting our Weight Watcher points when I got a text from Nick. We don’t
actually speak on the phone I just get messages. “Hi. Can I spend the night at
my friend’s house?”


    “You have a friend? Who?” Was my first response, after that,
I went from a quick NO to a definite maybe. I talked to Lisa about my fears and
the disaster Henry went through last year staying at the
crack-house-with-that-kid-who-had-the-brother-who-beat-his-mother. “Yet I don’t
want to say no. I mean he was invited somewhere. He’s got a friend. There might
be other kids. I don’t want to blow it for him. What should I do? After all
Awesomez, was trusting me and I wasn’t about to drop the ball.”

    “I know I’ll call Diane. She still has connections and we
can probably do a little checking.” She picked up the phone and sprang into
Nancy Drew action tapping into the Bellingham parental equivalent of the FBI.
“The kid doesn’t have any negative stuff attached to his name as far as I can
tell,” she summarized after her third source reported in. After I spoke to both
the kid and his father asking a myriad of questions, I let him go. As happy as
I was for Nick, I was worried as I drove to pick-up Henry that he would feel
ditched. He and Nick had had plans all week to go to Open Gym after Henry’s
workout. So when Quinn strode up to the car I asked her if she wanted to spend
the night. She and Henry always have a good time together. “Sure I want to see
Gnatalie anyway, besides Phoebe’s sick.”

    We’d just hung-up from delivering the news of Nick’s social
coup to Awesomez when the phone rang. I was winding my way along the rocky
coast and wasn’t about to pick up the call, which isn’t a problem with a
teenage girl in the car.

    “It’s Zach, the kid whose house Nick is at. He says Nick
can’t spend the night and you’ve got to pick him up.”

    “What?”

    “He says he ‘forgot’ about some previous plans and Nick has
to go home.” Quinn said skeptically.

    “Oh, no. I hope nothing happened.”

    “I feel bad for Nick. I hope he’s OK, that’s really
terrible. That kid’s a jerk.” Quinn said in a moment of compassion. Surprising.
She and Nick seem to have a “Moonlighting”, Bruce Willis/Cybil Shepherd-type
relationship bantering all the time, but without him here she felt his pain.

    “Poor Nick, that’s cheap that’s gotta hurt,” Henry moaned.

    “Call your mom, she’s going to have to pick him up. I’m way
too far away.”

    Not too long later, Lisa, Phoebe and Nick showed up at the
gym. “Hey, I brought our teenager. Who knew we’d be sharing a kid,” she said
with a laugh.

    “Is he ok?” I asked her after Nick went to change his
clothes for Open Gym.

    “Yeah Nick confirmed that Zach’s previous plan thing was
legit, he heard the girl call Zach and remind him about her birthday party.

    “That made us feel a lot better,” Phoebe chimed in.

    “Awesomez called. She feels terrible you had to go so out of
your way,” I told her.

    “I don’t know why she’s worried. We’re not new to kids, we
realized we weren’t getting a hamster.”

 July 16th Without A Paddle 
    
 (Deli - proof only mad dogs and Englishmen)

   It was one of those still mornings when you can feel the heat on your skin and you just know the day is going to be hellish hot. As part of our fun activities we had planned to go whale watching and spend a gloriously sunny day relaxing on a boat cruising the stunning San Juans looking for orca. Unfortunately, on the only day the cruise ran, I had to work and I mean I had to work. Jeff was expecting a slew of travel writers on Friday who were doing a press junket and they wanted to feature the Everybody’s Store. He needed all hands on deck.

   As a fallback, June, Awesomez and I decided to take the kids tubing down the Nooksack River with my sister. Tom although an enthusiastic tuber, decided a man’s place was in the chicken coop close to his Skilsaw™ and opted-out as he wanted to build another door before he his time was up and he had to return to real life in California.

 (Pea almost always working) 

   In preparation for the trip Henry counted tubes, while Quinn counted life jackets. The river is only inches deep in some places, but my sister and I are fiercely safety conscious, subscribing to the belief that if someone gets in trouble, you can’t help them if you’re exhausted. And there’s always the possibility you could hit your head. This seems nuts to most and hardly a tuber is seen with a life jacket, and it’s often a battle to get some adults to wear their life preserver. Awesomez was no exception. I got the whole I-used-to-swim-competitively-speech in Wal-Mart as I grabbed a couple of little life vests to stuff Lindsey and Henry in.

   Outside The Acme General Store Henry inflated the tubes and the rest of the kids lounged on a bench in the shade. In a group our size everything takes longer, getting snacks, sunglasses, shoes, sunscreen and towels in the right tube, on the right person or situated in the right car. Awesomez and I went and deposited the my sister’s van on Strand Road, only a couple of miles away, but about a three hour float.
It was getting later than I liked. We were putting in at almost 3:45PM, but it was hot, hot, hot and we’d be done by 7:00PM so I didn’t really worry, as it doesn’t get dark until 9:30PM or so.

   “Lisa, I don’t need one if we don’t have enough” Awesomez offered.

   “Lisa, this isn’t a swimming pool there are obstacles and things that can happen” my sister said unyielding. “We have enough life jackets as, Tom isn’t here,” she stated as we trudged down to the riverbank. I smiled to myself as I noticed Awesomez’ lifejacket wasn’t fastened. Knowing her rebellious nature and the fact that she&apos;s my big sister, I didn’t push her, at least she had it on. I considered that a win.

 (June, Carly and Quinn ready for fun) 

 (Lindsey not so sure) 

 (Nickie ready to tube!) 

 (Henry walking to the river)

 (Henry posing a chip off the old Robert&apos;s block- thank God) 

 (Carly getting in her tube) 

   From the moment we got in the river June transformed into a bubbly Esther Williams. She paddled and splashed laughed and twirled her tube singing a happy song. While Lindsey on the other hand, did not meet Old Man River with the same excitement. She was in a snit from the moment her toes touched the alpine stream. She sat there in the middle of her tube motionless pouting.

 ( starting out - note my bar on the far right - ) 

   “I can’t do it. I’m not big enough,” she complained. June looked at me and rolled her eyes.

   “Linds, you&apos;re thirteen, Phoebe is eight, and shorter than you, she’s doing it. C’mon you’re a swimmer” I called over my shoulder as the current took me and the floating bar tethered to my tube merrily along.

   “I can’t!” She screamed in a voice that set my teeth on edge.

   “Then roll over on your tummy and kick,” I suggested.

   “Yeah, roll over Lily-Pop and kick” June chimed as she bounced along.

   “I can’t!” Lindsey screamed again with a scowl on her face. Mama Awesomez took over and, waded back to help Lindsey.

   “Just don’t talk to her,” Awesomez suggested as she splashed by. I gladly complied remembering my early angst ridden teen years where everything was horrible and no one understood me, including myself.
The rest of the floaters, Henry, Nick, Quinn, Phoebe, Carly and Lisa were scattered about the river laughter streaming behind them like ribbons in the water. June had gotten out of her tube to blow it up and accidently let a good deal of air out. The opening was quite large and needed a conical shaped adapter to inflate it. She was stuck. Now she stood there in the middle of the river with a saggy tube.
“It’s OK I can still float on it” She said trying to make the best of it, but gone was the lilt in her cheery voice. I grabbed the tube folded the plastic back and began to blow, and blow and blow and blow. I wanted Esther Williams back.

   When the tube was properly inflated June simply looked at me and said “Impressive” followed by a few giggles and well, OK there were a few other comments, I will leave up to the gentle reader’s imagination. Anyway during this time my sister had gone around a bend in the river and gotten stuck on a downed tree jutting out horizontally across the water, half the branches were sticking up out of the water and the other half poking down into the river. She tried giving the thumbs down signal to the rest of the group to avoid this turn by getting out and walking around. Lindsey was the only one who saw the signal and got out. I did not. And got stuck, but was able to free the mini bar and myself without spilling a drink. Awesomez did not see the signal either and followed me a bit distracted by Lindsey, wondering why her child was now exiting the river after she’d just gotten her going.

   A novice tuber Awesomez had little control of her tube initially andgot trapped under the tree. Struggling against the current to right herself as her asthma medication floated away. Awesomez who has serious asthma never goes anywhere, anywhere with out her inhaler. Trying to stay calm in light of the life threatening loss she pulled herself up just righting herself in time to see June and Phoebe who were now clipped together with a rope coming tumbling toward her. Seeing the rope knowing there was nothing she could do, she braced herself for the hit, she went down again. Exhausted and with out her shoes on she was beginning to get in trouble, when she was hit again by Quinn and then some guy, and then a blond woman with a pony tail who I could hear say callously “Don’t worry you didn’t hurt me” to Awesomez after she pushed her back into the tree once again. During this time by the grace of God, Phoebe found Awesomez’ medication.

   “The pack just floated right up to my foot and I grabbed it,” she explained with her sunshine smile.

   &quot;The river giveth what the river taketh away&quot;I said as she gave it to me. I beached my rig making my way back to the tree. When I got there a scared and exhausted Awesomez was struggling to keep her composure. She was caught under the tree again and trying to maintain her breathing. Quinn was wrapped around her and unsure how to get herself out.

   Nick worried too about his mother was right behind me. I climbed the tree and made my way over to the struggling pair while Nick was on the bank not far away. Quinn was still sitting in her tube, but Awesomez was barely above water caught on a branch of the tree.

   “Quinnie! Look at me! Put your feet above your head on the tree so you’re sitting in a “V’ then I’ll pull you out of the water and you can stand here on the tree. OK?”

   “Niece, I can’t do it. I’m not strong enough,” she sounded panicky.

   “No. You don’t have to, I’ll pull you, just put your feet there and hold on wrist to wrist so we don’t slip, just like your mother and I taught you we did in vaulting”.

   “I’ll try,” she said feebly. Putting her feet up. I grabbed my sister’s child with all my strength and up that oversized beanpole came.

   “Now, jump off the tree into that spot right there where it’s deep and Nick will help you get to the edge Right Nick?”

   “Right” Nick responded dutifully. “Over here Quinn” he encouraged retrieving her tube I’d already tossed. Splash! In she went. One down.
Now for Awesomez. “Lisie, I’m going to get you out.”

   “I’m hurt and I’m so tired and my inhaler is gone,” she told me so I’d know the whole picture.

   “No, Phoebe found your inhaler and shoes down stream so we have them don’t worry” I said gently trying to reassure her.

   “People keep hitting me, June and Phoebe and this rope. I went over the rope and under the tree,” she said looking exhausted and depleted.

   “I know I could see from where I was, that’s why I’m here. Who thought I’d be helping you” I tried t make light of the situation. “Now I want you to do just like Quinn did. I’ll pull you up”

   “I’m too far below you, I can’t even reach your hand. I’m going to have to get up on one of these branches,” she said and I agreed, as she was all but submerged and tangled in a mass of branches. Watching her I could see the fear in her eyes, slowly and carefully she pulled herself up onto a branch just beneath the surface of the water, once there I was able to get her to the top of the tree.

   “Now you’re going to have to jump back into the water,” I commanded authoritatively.

   “What? I don’t want to” she resisted.

   “You have to, it’s the only way. You’ll be all right, Nick’s there he’ll help you”.

   “I’m here Mama” Nick assured her.

   “OK Son” she called back, “but I’m not jumping. Can’t I just lower myself in?”

   “Sure, but I think you might hit more branches and it’ll take more strength. You look exhausted,” I said.

   “I am,” she returned as she sank into the water again.

   That disaster behind us we regrouped on the banks of the river. Awesomez depleted both physically and emotionally sat in her tube quietly for most of the afternoon.

   “Awesomez, you look dead” Carly was heard to say each and every time she floated by Awesomez.
“Really, you look dead. Did you really go over the rope and under the tree?” She’d ask in naïve amazement, forcing a reluctant Awesomez relive the ordeal over and over again.

   The rest of the afternoon went on mostly without incident except for the Phoebe ordeal. Phoebe after rescuing the inhaler got in trouble again with the rope clipping her to June. June went around a rock and fell out of her tube while Phoebe and the rest of the rope could not. Phoebe now stuck in deep water alone couldn’t un-hook the clip and Lisa was some distance away while I was still helping Awesomez. Henry seeing Phoebe was in trouble leapt from his tube and swam against the current pulling himself hand over hand on the rope until he reached his cousin. He couldn’t unclip the tube either, but stayed with Pheebes comforting her until Lisa could get there. Phoebe was beyond grateful to her hero, Henry.

 (Our happy tubers on the Nooksack with Mt. Baker in the distance) 

   We now bounced along singing and chatting. June sporting her floppy hat was enjoying herself so much Carly asked her on more than one occasion if she was drunk.

   “No I’m not drunk silly, I’m just carefree and having a gosh darn good time as river-rat Barbie” June explained to her niece who usually sees her dressed to the nines full of responsibility with her big job. Just then we heard a scream.

   “Was that laughing or crying?” I wondered aloud.

   “I think it was laughing,” June guessed and floated on. I didn’t think so. It was Quinn and she was with Awesomez. If there ever was a pair destined for trouble it was them, “Klutz and Klutzier”. Too far downstream to help, I waited and watched from a distance.

    Quinn had veered to the left and gotten stuck on another tree. Tumbling out of her tube she was then caught on and scraped by an unseen branch causing her to scream bloody murder. Seeing the fear emblazoned on Quinn’s face Awesomez reflexively jumped out of her tube, and went to rescue Quinn from the treacherous branches below the surface - thanks to help of her life jacket they both made it out in a relatively short time. From their faces, I’m not sure who was more frightened, but somehow they managed escaping a little worse for wear.

   While Quinn and Awesomez seemed to be riding the rapids from hell, the rest of us floated merrily along. Phoebe and June navigated the twists and turns relatively carefree and Lindsey bobbled about enjoying the ride. Nick and Henry were in their own boy world talking about who knows what, but having fun nonetheless. I sipped my libation and scooted betwixt and between them all serving up refreshments when the mood struck me. When you’re the bartender, everyone wants to be your friend. Although, I could hear a parched Awesomez hollering “You’re the worst bartender ever!” from way upstream at me because I wasn&apos;t attending to the stragglers. She was laying like something dead in her tube according to Carly.

 ( Nick and Mama Awesomez) 
 
   The sun began to wan as we continued to float and suddenly it seemed to be getting a lot cooler which is what I’d been afraid putting in so late. We kept looking for the beach at Strand Road, but with the extreme weather last winter and now the extreme heat lowering the water levels everything looked a lot different. I realized I should have walked down to the banks and looked for some kind of marker like I did last year with Tom, but in my haste to get everyone going I hadn’t. I was kicking myself now as the kids started ask “how much longer?” I really didn’t know the answer. I didn’t have my watch on. We kept stopping and looking then continuing on. We’d seen some floaters earlier who said they were going to the bridge, but that was all the way at Potter Road by the Everybody’s Store and we weren’t going that far that was about a five hour float.

   The light was sinking fast and we were now the only ones on the river. I knew we were lost. June still enjoying herself kept singing “…set sail that day for a three hour tour, a three hour tour. The weather started getting rough…” and Henry’s lips were eggplant and he was shivering like a Chihuahua. Of all people, Lindsey turned out to be a real trooper and kept on going without a word. Awesomez was done before she started and was just enduring the experience, Quinn was over the whole thing and my sister and I were feeling the strain of responsibility. Exchanging knowing looks as we eyed the banks. We figured, worst-case scenario we’d climb the banks and plow through someone’s cornfield. As the last of the light slipped from the sky we came around a bend in the river to reveal a bridge.

   “A bridge, the bridge! We’re here!” Nick cried and everyone was relieved, except Lisa and me.
“Bridge? There is no bridge at Strand Road” I said softly.

   “I don’t remember one either” she said. 

&quot;That&apos;s because there isn&apos;t one&quot;I said.

 (The bridge) 

 Cold and hungry we all got out of our tubes and began looking for a way up. Awesomez and my sister trekked through a narrow passage with a few of the kids and found their way to the bridge first. Nick came back for the rest of us. Once on the bridge, I knew we had gone all the way to Potter Road. By the time we got there Awesomez explained they’d hailed down a guy in a tie-dyed t-shirt on a Harley and Lisa was now hitching a ride to her van on Strand Road.

   “At least she’s on a motorcycle it’s less likely he’ll stop and kill her,” Henry said hopefully. I hadn’t seen the man and for a moment, fear gripped my heart. Lisa and I have seen our share of evil, but I knew my sister was not a foolish risk taker, so I tried to remain calm, although riding a motorcycle, soaking wet with no protection was scary enough. At least Harley riders had some sense.

   Moments later, the grey-haired motorcycle man pulled up “You must be our Knight in Shining Armor!” I called.

   “Hey there, I think I scared that mama to death, but she’s on her way back with the van” the man said.

   “Where you all from?” He asked.

   “California, Mammoth” Awesomez responded.

   “Well, you’re no city girl” he answered back.

   “Bellingham” Quinn answered and he nodded.

   “Mosquito Lake Road,” I said, “I work at the Everybody’s Store,” I added.

   “I’m Jim Abernathy”

   “Oh my gosh! Jim Abernathy! I’ve read you’re flyers, you’re heading up all the local meetings about the thefts recently aren’t you?”

   “Yeah, that’s me. I’ve known Jeff a long time but I sure as hell wouldn’t work for him,” he said with a smile. I smiled at this.

   “Amy makes it easy” I said and he smiled knowingly. We spent the next few minutes thanking our hero for taking the time to stop.

 ( The rescue! Carly, Lindsey, Awesomez, Lisa. Jim Abernathy, Quinn, Phoebe, June and Nick) 

   When we finally got home a worried Tom had the Hummer keys in hand and was just about to go look for us. Wonderfully, he’d barbecued his spectacular tri-tip ready which had been ready for over an hour, baked potatoes were in the oven and watermelon sat on the counter cutup and ready to eat. Descending on the food like vultures no one spoke until the food was completely gone.

   “Now Denise, I’m going to need that nice Jim Abernathy’s address so I can send him a proper thank you note for rescuing us” June chirped as she poured Awesomez another medicinal glass of Pinot to soothe her injuries. “I had such a good time today” she cooed.

   “I know, you really did” Awesomez said trying to smile through her obvious pain. Her blood red and purple bruises now quite visible, “It was fun to watch you like that again”.

   “I felt so free” June agreed.

   “I thought she was drunk and you were dead,” Carly said completely deadpan again.

   “Well, if everything had gone as planned it wouldn’t have been such an adventure” Quinn said. That&apos;s my girl.

 June 6th After Midnight 
 
 (Deli subscribes to the philosophy: treat your family like company) 

   Sensing something as I lay warm in bed I opened my eyes to see Henry’s smiling upside down face about three inches away. “It’s My Birthday!” He sang.

   “So it is&quot;I said groggily noting it was only 4:30 in the morning. Tom rolled over.

“Happy Birthday now go back to bed. Take Alvin and Bruno and go back to sleep before we throw your presents in the trash and cancel your barbecue.” Wisely Henry showed new maturity and did as instructed.

   After the presentation of a few gifts, and while preparing the coffee, Tom turned to me and bemoaned, “With all we have to do to get ready for this afternoon, what really need is Phoebe’s help. She’s the only one of the three who has the stick-to-it-ness to get things done.”

   “Maybe Henry will now that he’s older?” I said unconvincingly. Tom peered at me raising an eyebrow.
“You keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better. But I do have to say I’m not being completely fair. He did a great job helping me this week. I was surprised. He stayed with me most of the time and didn’t squirrel around the way he used to.”

   Once Tom and I had infused ourselves with the requisite caffeine we got on with the birthday barbecue preparations. I cleaned the house, while Tom finished hanging his new barn doors. Then he and Henry tidied up the yard and started to prepare the pavilion for the festivities. During the chaos, Nancy Campbell and her husband arrived to pick up Alfred, Matilda and one of Clara&apos;s babies. We quickly caught them, put them in the carriers Nancy brought and barely said good-bye because of everything else going on. I felt terrible, like I was selling part of myself. I knew I&apos;d made up my mind to do it, it was the right thing for all of us and I knew Nancy was a wonderful bird owner. She has heritage turkeys, chickens and ducks, so these three were a natural. I&apos;d planned to give her Alfred as he is genetically a beautiful gander, I wanted Matilda, his mate to go for company, but she&apos;s not a breeder with her angel wing condition so I sent one of the babies. Telling myself it was the right thing over and over didn&apos;t make me feel any better and I was glad we were busy getting ready for the party.

   Lisa arrived early with Phoebe in tow to help. Immediately I sent Phoebe to the pond with Henry and Tom.

   “Pheeb, they need help. Make it kinda girly. Put the tablecloths on and fix it like we’re having a party you know.” She nodded.

   “I get it. You don’t want the chips served in a ripped bag.” She did get it. I love her.

   While Phoebe went off to supervise Henry and Tom, Lisa did everything else, from preparing ears of corn for the grill to making my sangria recipe and cleaning the guest bathroom while I showered. Once all was ready, we waited. And waited and waited.

   The guests were supposed to arrive at 4:00PM and at 5:30 PM we started to worry. I hoped this wasn’t going to be a disaster. We only had one kid so far, if no one else came that would be enough I hoped. Then thankfully, three carloads pulled in almost at once.

   Concerned we hadn’t taken care of the bee hive before the rest of the guests arrived I told the kids they might want to go to the pond while Henry took care of some bee business. The kids and their parents had other plans. They all were fascinated by the bees and wanted to every moment. As it turned out Mike’s search for Regina, the renegade queen became the evening’s entertainment. The search went on for sometime, then Beekeeper Mike discovered an irregular egg-laying pattern on one of the trays, “She’s been laying way too drones. The hive knows this means she’s leaving and that the hive will die so the bees might have killed her or she left.”



 (Beekeeper Mike lifts the lid of the hive without any attacks - pictured with his dog, Ginger, while giving Henry a taste of Sweet Ass Honey) 

 ( Henry (in his birthday suit from Grandpa Horn) -and Beekeeper Mike hunt the evil queen, Regina - while Tom looks on at a safe distance) 
 

   “Long live the queen!” Was heard from one of the parents as Henry handed the kids a drone.
“It’s OK drones don’t have stingers.” Henry reassured the leery but curious boys. Soon the drone was named Moo-hammed and was the best loved bee that’s ever been. Moo-hammed was walking from hand to hand enjoying his newfound status.

   Meanwhile back at the hive, Glinda, the new queen Mike and Donna had brought, was inserted into the hive still inside her queen-cage with a marshmallow cork for the drones to eat through, just like when we inserted Regina. “In a day or two, Henry will come out here again and make sure she’s free. By that time her pheromones will be throughout the hive and they will accept her as their queen.” Mike informed the wide-eyed crowd while Henry collected Moo-hammed and returned him unharmed to the hive.
 (Warren, Phoebe, Henry, Teddy and Parker are shown Glinda, the new queen, by Donna) 

   At the barbecue, I served sangria and Tom grilled hamburgers, while Warren, an orthopedic doctor and father to Noah, utilized his surgical skills on the onions. The adults dipped into the guacamole while kids played basketball, did yo-yo tricks and discovered the warm water of the pond.

 (a little jungle ball) 

   “Denise you know you don’t have to plant flowers, you have enough forage on your property with the blackberries, maples and salmon berries there’s enough in fact, for a bee farm.” Beekeeper Mike remarked. “Would you like to put more hives up here?”

   “I’d love it, but right now, we just don’t have the money.” I stated pretty matter-of-factly.

   “Oh no you don’t understand. I have ten hives I’d like to bring up here and I’ll split the honey with you. Then there’ll be more of Henry’s Sweet Ass Honey,” he said with a grin.”

   “That sounds wonderful! We’d love it! Pea! We’re getting ten more hives!” I exclaimed.

   “More hives? That sounds great,” Tom said looking up from the burgers, “but we can’t afford more hives.” Tom remarked ruefully. Beekeeper Mike explained the arrangement and got Tom on board with the program. “Hey, you never know. Maybe the bees are going to save us”. Tom said thoughtfully as he went back to the grill. Henry started doing his business projections.

 (Henry and Parker - do their Lord of the Flies imitation) 

 ( Noah, Parker, Justin&amp;Henry) 

   “How many pounds of honey per hive Mike?” Henry queried. “And we get half? Nice!” Henry affirmed.

   By now, it was late and we hadn’t even served the ice cream cake yet. Phoebe and I hopped in the van and zoomed back to the house. When we saw the sheep out in the pasture, the donkey on the hill and the goats in my garden we were momentarily confused. Realizing someone had forgotten to close the gate we jumped out and started wrangling the menagerie back to their proper places. “Denise I don’t know how to tell you this,” Phoebe said, but the cows are the ones who knocked your garden fence down that’s why the goats got in.”

   “You’re kidding.”

   “No. Henry told me. He said they were tromping in the garden and he and Tom had to get them out,” Phoebe elaborated as Rachel nibbled on my prize blueberry bush hopes of summer cobbler disappearing as Christina gorged on a plant next to her mother.

   &quot;Really?&quot;

   &quot;Henry said he found a big frickin&apos;cow print in the middle of the carrot row.&quot;She confided.

   “Get out of my garden you mangy goats!” I screamed a blood curdling scream as I ran pelmel toward them waving my arms with maniacal fury. I can barely grow a weed in this garden and here they were eating what little I had. You could practically hear the circus music as Phoebe and I ran around trying to outwit the wily goats who had tasted Nirvana and had no intentions of giving up without a fight. We circled and chased, dove and grabbed and finally with teamwork and some luck, Phoebe and I emerged triumphant. However, this was just one skirmish, I knew there would be many more battles in the blueberry wars.

   Hearts pumping, cake in hand we returned to sing Happy Birthday and finish the barbecue; the last of our guests bidding us good night at about 10:30P.M.

 ( Henry opening a present) 
 ( Chris got Henry&quot;throwing knives&quot;so he won&apos;t steal my steak knives anymore) 

 ( Phoebe with hamburger ice cream cake) 

   As I was recounting the day’s events with Tom and putting away the dishes, Henry padded in the kitchen.“Mama, that was the best birthday I could have asked for” he said with gratitude. “I think my friends really liked it here. Who would have ever thought a drone could provide so much entertainment? And now we’re getting more hives. Hey, maybe, maybe just maybe we’ll get some Midnights! Remember those are supposed to be the gentlest bees ever! Wouldn’t that be cool? .” Henry said way over-the-top excited as his yo-yo went up and down mindlessly. I looked over at Tom who was smiling.

   “You know you’re a bee geek right?” I said happily shooing him out of the kitchen as his yo-yo went flying.

 June 1st A Royal Pain 
    
 ( lilies in our yard) 

    My dad wrote me from Paris using some colorful language and some strong “French” insisiting I acquire some proper clothing for dealing with the bees. His treat, for Henry’s birthday.

   We’d planned to go down to Cedar Bees when Henry could go, but Beekeeper Mike had some scheduling conflicts and just couldn’t do it until today. Before my father&apos;s explicit instructions on bee-wear we had needed to go down to Ceder Bees anyway to get our next bee box. This allows the bees to store more honey for the winter.The honey Henry collects won&apos;t be until we get the third box with a queen bee excluder. This means the queen can&apos;t get in at all because of her size so the honey is just honey without any bee eggs. Which is nice.

   Tom and I took off around noon on another 97 degree day and got there just as his wife Donna was trying to overnight some queen bees. She filled out shipping labels while we discussed different combinations of clothing options. We could get one Wee-Bee suit for Henry and me to share or two bee suits in case he needed some one to go with him on occasion.

   After an obscure shopping spree where I tried on nothing but white ill-fitting, water-resistant outfits we ended up with two selections. One “Wee-Bee suit” for Henry and me to share and one bee jacket with attached facemask that will fit both Tom and me. The extra fabric doesn’t endanger me and this allows Tom to go too.

 (Tim (who also raises worms) wearing the mask just to protect his face from examining tray after tray of bees) 

   What puzzled me as we were deciding on our ensemble is how the guys (friends of Dan’s from the airplane), Wally and Tim, working the bees, making the boxes and inspecting the hives were both wearing shorts. Shorts! And they weren’t getting stung. They were not covered head to toe like they worked for HASMAT. Beekeeper Mike walked in just as we were making our final selections and we all told him of our bee problem.

   “I don’t know, maybe we’re doing something wrong, but whenever we go to feed them they fly up in our faces. Henry’s been stung on the lip and side and the back. They flew up my pant leg and frankly we’re more than a little nervous now. They don’t act like your bees at all,” I said despondently.

   “Sounds like you have a real bitch,” Mike said after listening.

   “Yep. That’s what I thought,” Donna concurred.

 (bright colored bee looks different because it is covered in pollen) 

   “What?” Tom asked. “I guess they’re sophisticated societies and have personalities.”

   “Yep, and if the queen’s a bitch they all have her DNA and then they all are just like her,” Mike explained. “I have one hive like that out of all my hives. I really should kill her, but she lays so many eggs and that hive makes so much honey I let it go. I dread going out there though it’s like a horror movie.”

   “Yep, that’s what we’ve got. They follow us down the hill and won’t leave us alone,” I agreed happy this was not unexplainable. This was a thing.

   “So now what?” Tom asked. “What do we do?”

   “Well, you have to kill the queen.” He said casually.

   “We have to kill the queen?” I asked in disbelief wondering how the heck we were going to do that when we couldn’t even change the feeder.

   “No, we’re going to have to come up and do it. Although we can’t do it until later in the week because Mike has chemo on Tuesday and then we&apos;re driving to Easter Washington to deliver some bees.” Donna explained to us.

   “We live about an hour away.” I said shocked they would consider coming up to our house to help us.

   “Mike loves to help young beekeepers and we don’t want Henry to be afraid of his hive.” Donna said as she finished her labels.

   “Well, then what about Saturday, so Henry can be there and then you can stay for a barbecue. It&apos;s Henry&apos;s birthday he&apos;s turning twelve.” I said hopefully.

   “That way you don’t have to turn around and go home,” Tom continued to encourage.

   “Sounds great!” Mike agreed readily. “You don’t have to twist my arm.”
 (Our bee feeder has been in the wrong place from day one) 

 (Tom looking for a queen) 

   We stayed long enough get some instruction, watch Tim inspect a few hives and for Tom to get stung in the face. “It doesn’t hurt too much, I was leaning in to the hive with my whole body. I can’t remember the last time I got stung,”

   “I can.” I said flatly.

   On the way home, we stopped at Home Depot™ and I called Awesomez to tell her about what we&apos;d learned, only I felt a little self-conscious saying&quot;they&apos;re coming over on Saturday to kill her&quot;.

After pricing belt sander rentals I called my sister to see if she could find their sander. We have one, but it’s at Tom’s in Ventura.

   “Hey do you know where the sander is Chris accused me of having for a millennium and then found in your garage?”

   “I remember it, but I have no idea where it is. You need it?” Lisa asked.

   “Yeah, I will when I sand the porch after I finish the eaves.”

   “Your welcome to look for it. I’ll ask Chris, he just cleaned the garage so he might know where it is.”

   “Can you send me those pictures of the chicken coop you took the other day?”

   “Sure, but I don’t know how.” Lisa moaned.

   “That’s OK, hold on, Tom has a question about the chicken coop.”

   “Hey” Tom greeted.

   “Hey Tom,” Lisa acknowledged. “I could just tell you what I saw and then you could ask me questions.” Lisa suggested.

   “Well, I really just have one question. You see, I built a row of nesting boxes and they’re about two feet off the ground.” Tom paused.

   “That’s just like what I saw, they look like bookcases.”

   “Yeah, now I want to know, do they hop up there or do they need a ladder?” Tom puzzled.
“
   Well, they don’t need an elaborate ladder.”

   “No I know, I was just…”

   “You know? I thought perhaps you were going to build a little chicken elevator complete with a light for up and down.”

   “Yeah then I can teach them to eat the feed and it makes the lift raise. We could take them to the fair.”

   “Don’t forget to charge a quarter for the feed.” Lisa reminded.

   “Pea, tell Lisa about the coup.” I added.

   “Oh yeah, we have an evil bee queen and they’re coming out on Saturday to kill the queen.

    “What? Are they going to bring a little tiny guillotine?” Lisa chuckled.

   “Yeah, they’re going to bee-head her.” Tom laughed.

   When we got home, I went up the hill with the larger jacket outfit on and my jeans. After all, if Tim could wear shorts I could wear jeans. Wally had said they can&apos;t sting through your jeans. It didn&apos;t take me long to find out Wally was wrong. I had two more stingers lodged in my thigh. The same leg still recovering from the other five stings from last Monday. I limped down the hill to the barn where I flicked the stingers out and then tromped right back up again ready for combat. I was going to put that ding-dang feeder in the right place. However, I started to imagine they could get in even when logic dictated they couldn&apos;t. I felt frozen hoping they&apos;d get bored and fly away. But they kept coming at me and one little witch followed me down the hill and wouldn&apos;t leave.

&quot;Mom! swat her! Off with her head!&quot;Henry cried.&quot;Only God can save the queen now!&quot;

 May 25th The Best Laid Plans 
    
 (flowers outside my laundry room door) 

   It was just another cup of coffee, coverall, can of paint kind of day. I spent the morning on top of a ladder painstakingly working on the eaves above the front porch. The ones I did not paint last year when I did the entire rest of the house because of my resident bats. A fairly large colony lives in a small crevice between my eaves. When you look up from the porch floor you can usually see their tiny toes hanging out and hear their little chirps. You do not want to put your coffee cup on the table too close to the house as it could end up being sprinkled with bat guano. It’s not a real problem you just have to scoot it forward. They don’t have much range. Bats are sensitive little creatures who keep to themselves and do not care for paint fumes so I try to be accommodating as they are helpful little guys who eat mosquitoes by the thousands.

 ( one coat of white on the eaves - the black started- temp light)
 
    Although there is no glory in painting eaves, they&apos;ve got to be done, and everything was going according to schedule. If I kept up my current pace I would indeed be completely finished by dark. I was systematically going across the deck and working my way around. Of course, my arm was always above my head giving me an entirely new appreciation for the Sistine Chapel. These particular eves would require three coats. The first coat was sort of exciting as I could see a huge and immediate difference, but then as I watched the paint dry I could see it yellow and the color of the wood seep through. The second coat is harder to do emotionally. I put it on thick in hopes it will be enough knowing full well it won’t and ultimately I will have to do the entire ceiling for a third time.

   This was my lot in life as the holiday weekend ticked by. Toby had flown in earlier in the week to close escrow on her farm in Courtenay on Vancouver Island. She said it would take her two days to finish packing and then she thought she might visit for a day or so and we’d still have a week or more to spend together. That was on Wednesday and five days later she is nowhere near done, so I have Dean who is having a grand old time playing with Henry.

 (Miracle&apos;s nose on right wondering I suppose what Irish might have to eat) 

   Today I told them was a workday because “a girl I know through a couple of my friends, Jackie and Gina, both know Rowan. She moved here from California with her daughter Pearl. They live in Everson a little town near Lynden.”

   “Isn’t that where the Black Forest restaurant is?” Henry asked.

   “Yes it is. I can’t believe you remember that. Anyway, they’re going to be coming by today. You guys can play with Pearl while Rowan and I make margaritas,” I explained as I outlined their chores. So they vacuumed the house, loaded the dishwasher did some laundry and were making themselves a well deserved lunch. Consequently, it was quiet outside while I worked with the exception of the cowbells jingle, jangling. Every once in awhile I’d look up to hear Nutsy, the woodpecker, rat-a-tat-tatting on the metal roof of the Kubota™ barn or to chat with Miracle as she tried to make friends with Irish. The geese were somewhere unseen only to be heard every once in a while as they scolded each other or ganged up on Luther. The goats sought refuge from the heat of the day under the house chewing their cud while the sheep decorated the lawn continuously mowing.

 (Sheryl and Mildred grazing) 

It was a picturesque day with a blue, blue sky and little white puffy clouds and green green grass. When I looked up I noticed that while all the sheep had their heads down only three of the four were eating. Apache was staring at the grass motionless while the others moved about. I watched him for a time and realized there was something seriously wrong. I called Andrea, the breeder I’d gotten him from and asked her what she thought. She suspected bloat, a gassy condition that can and is fatal much of the time in ruminants such as horses, cows, goats and sheep.

   “Can you see him now?” She asked.

   “No. Hold on a second, I’ll look out the door, I can’t find the cordless phone.” I said hurriedly as I set the phone down and ran out the door where Henry and Dean were keeping an eye on Apache.

   “Henry, where’s Apache?” I asked.

   “He’s right over there around the corner.”

   “How is he, Andrea wants to know if his left side is distended.”

   “Well, I don’t know what distended means, but he’s vomiting green frothy stuff. Look it’s falling out of his mouth,” Henry answered worriedly. I ran back in the house and relayed the information.

   “OK well, it sounds like frothy bloat. Are they on a new pasture?” Andrea wondered.

   “Well, they are, but I did it gradually and the others are all fine.” Hoping I hadn’t made some fatal error in judgment.

   “You can have just one who for whatever reason just bloats. Take a syringe. Do you have a large syringe?”

   “Yes.” I answered meekly.

   “Mix a cup of water, vegetable oil and three tablespoons of baking soda. When you have most of it down him then put a stick in his mouth cross ways like a bridle, so he bites on it. This will help him begin to burp.”

   “Got it,” I said as I obediently began mixing up the concoction. Remembering the syringe was in the barn I grabbed the turkey baster instead and headed out the door. I held Apache as Henry shoved the mixture down our patient’s throat and Dean held the bowl full of “medication”. Successfully getting most of it down his throat I inserted the stick and allowed him to bite down on it several times before releasing him.

   The three of us stood there watching. Apache scooted away from us as quickly as he could. Dazed and confused he was stumbling around trying to get his bearings when green frothy stuff started erupting out of his mouth again this time followed by blood.

   “Mom! He’s vomiting blood!” Henry shrieked.

   “Lots of it!” Dean yelled. Not knowing what else to do I called Andrea back again. She said it probably was frothy bloat and that he was probably not going to make it. I hung up. I knew vomiting blood was never good but I wasn’t giving up.

   “Henry, I’m going to call Kulshan, but I have to tell you, Andrea said it’s a strong possibility Apache’s not going to make it. You have to be prepared.&quot;I knew he was upset, near tears, but I turned my back and went into the house to call the vet. I would have to deal with him later. After twelve years of Cancer with my mother I know there is always time to get upset. Now was the time for saving the sheep if I could. I called Kulshan and left a message for the on call large animal doctor. After I hung up I dialed Lisa.

   “Can I call you back? I’m on the phone with Annie.” She asked naively.

   “NO! I’m sorry. You can’t call me back. I’m having a sheep emergency. Apache’s vomiting blood,” I blurted. “I can’t stay on the phone I have Kulshan calling me back.&quot;

   “I’ll get my keys and I’ll walk out the door,” She responded without hesitation. I knew she’d come if she could; we were always a team in a crisis. We’d had a lot of practice.

   Almost immediately Dr. Potts from Kulshan returned my call. He was a kind understanding man who helped me through the entire assessment process. I described the chain of events that had led to my call and then he began asking me questions.

   “Do you have any Rhododendron?’

   “No. I removed all Rhododendron.”

   “Do you have Oleander?”

   “No.” I said remembering Henry being on the heart monitor at one year and ten days of age from putting Oleander in his mouth. “I don’t have any Oleander or Azaleas.”

   “OK, Do you have any dog or cat food he could have gotten into? Are there any rotting weeds or hay?” He asked patiently.

   “Well, I did pull some weeds and they’re in a pile from my flower garden, but they’re only a couple days old and not rotting yet. And no, I feed all the house animals inside.”

   “Good.” he said, “That’s the best and safest way to do it.” I felt twinge of pride. I was doing something right despite this catastrophe that was almost certainly my fault somehow. “I’d like you to go to the barn and check on a few things and call me back. I’d like you to take his rectal. The temperature on a sheep on a hot day like today should, is he shorn?”

   “Yes just last week,” I answered mater-of-factly.

   “Then his temperature should be I’m hoping for below 103 degrees. I want you to use your finger but don’t hurt his eye and determine if he’s blind. Feel just past his last rib before his hip on the left side to determine if it’s bloat.”

   “I’m sorry, but what would it feel like?”

   “Well, if there is normal roughage in there you’ll feel harder clumps. If it’s bloat you’ll feel it to be like a balloon. After you do all that, call me and we’ll see if you need to bring him in.”
Henry, Dean and I herded the sheep in the barn and began our exam on Apache.

   “It doesn’t look big and distended to me.” Henry said using his new word.
“To me either.” I concurred. Using a cotton ball, instead of my finger, and throwing it up in the air as I’d seen my sister do in a neurology class I tried to determine if Apache tracked the movement with his eyes rather than just felt the movement.

   “I can’t tell can you?” I solicited Henry’s opinion.

   “No. I can’t.” He said just as worried as I was. We let him up and watched him walk across the barn. He was stumbling like a drunk, but negotiated the silver hay bucket with out too much trouble as he crossed the barn. So we thought he could see, but then wondered if just knew where it was and could sense it. I called Dr. Potts.

   “I can’t find my thermometer so my sister is stopping at Walgreens™ and buying one so I don’t know his temperature yet, but he isn’t distended, he feels normal. He acts drunk and spacey.”

   “Well, there is a bacteria they can get from rotting food that causes them to have a condition we call star gazing.”

   “I did see a bad bale of hay in the barn. Truthfully, he could have gotten some of it without me noticing it. I just don’t know. I wouldn’t rule it out.”

   “Hmm. Give him some hay and see if he’ll eat. Call me back when you know his temperature.” Dr. Potts instructed. I went back to the barn and fed the hay. Apache ate immediately while the others did not.

   “They’re probably full because they’ve been grazing.” Henry theorized. “Mom, if Apache dies where will we bury him?” Henry said softly.

   “Near the goslings.” I replied.

   “How will we dig such a big hole?’ He wondered pragmatically.

   “With the tractor.” I answered.He sat silently for a while and then not wanting to dwell on the topic, he and Dean went to the gate to wait for Lisa while I sat and waited with the sheep. Angus immediately sat down and began chewing his cud followed by Sheryl. Mildred stood looking at me wide-eyed wondering I’m sure what I was doing sitting in her stall. Apache sat down struggling to keep his eyes open then just giving in putting his head down on the floor. Moments later the cavalry rode up in the form of my sister and Phoebe. Ponytailed, with her baseball hat on Lisa wore a stethoscope around her neck. Her very presence calmed me. Without wasting time she tore open the thermometer and inserted it while I held Apache.

   “A hundred and one, a hundred and one point five, a hundred and two, a hundred and ooops he’s pooping. We’ll have to go again, but that’s a good sign, no blockage.”

   “Something’s happening in there. He peed too.” I grasped for the positive.

   “Good. OK a hundred and two a hundred and two point five, six, seven, eight and nine.” The thermometer beeped. “Well, it’s under a hundred and three.” She said hopefully. “I brought my Pugh sheep book.” She said as she listened to his stomachs, took his heart rate and in general checked all his clinical signs.

 (Lisa&apos;s tools) 

   “I thought you would.”

   “I actually had it in the car just in case.” It occurred to me how thoughtful that was for her to carry around a book about sheep and goats so she’d be prepared if I needed her.

   Lisa called Dr. Potts and they began their discussion using much medical terms he hadn’t used with me. He wanted her to check for any strabismus, which I learned, is a fixation of the pupil. “In Siamese cats it often presents as cross-eyed.” Lisa explained. We checked. She felt his eyesight was sufficient, she agreed there was no bloat and in general thought he was goofy and we were going to have to take him in. Lisa called Chris while I put a tarp and a furniture blanket in the back of the van and loaded up.

 (Me and Apache - not our best day) 

   “Rowan! I’ve got to call Rowan, she and Pearl are coming over.” I said frantically looking for her phone number to let her know we wouldn’t be here.

   “You had plans?” Lisa said looking at how I was dressed and covered in paint.

   “Yes. Rowan was just going to swing by for a chat and a margarita to mark the day. She lives in Everson.” I said with the mutual understanding that her living in out in the county completely forgave my appearance.

 ( Phoebe, Apache&amp;Dean en route)

 (Kulshan in Lynden - where Irish recovered last July)
 
   Dr. Potts drove up just as we did. There was another doctor already there. “Hi, I’m Amber” she said smiling. “How are you?”

   “I’ve been better.” I smiled shaking her outstretched hand. I was relived she didn&apos;t have a limp fish handshake as I was about to entrust her with my little lamb.
 

 (Apache gets check out) 

   “Well, let’s see what we can do.” She said and with that, Lisa, Dr. Potts and Amber began discussing, theorizing and talking in medical shorthand. While I listened garnering what I could from the conversation. They’d ask me a question and I’d see sideways glances I knew meant something, but wasn’t sure what.
It turned out he was anemic and the diagnosis was a suspected large parasite burden. “I think Apache here has a belly full of worms. Eighty percent of your parasites will be in twenty percent of your herd.” Amber explained. “I’ll check the fecal sample which will take a while longer, but I’m sure it’s going to come out high. But with some de-worming he should be fine. The good news is we can fix it.” She was the nicest, kindest person, so helpful and considerate, she made the experience a lot easier.

 (Me with paint in my hair, Apache, Phoebe, Henry&amp;Dean wait)
 
   We talked a while longer, and then Lisa and Phoebe headed home. On our way back through Everson I thought of Rowan and Pearl and our dashed plans. I wondered where they lived. It must be near here. Trying to drive as steadily as I could so Apache wouldn’t fall I checked my rear view mirror I and saw flashing lights. Hoping the K9 unit was on its way to an emergency I pulled over. It seems highway 9 drops from 50 miles an hour to 35 for a brief stint and I was doing 45 a steady. I got a ticket. I had no idea how I was going to tell Tom.

   While I was pulled over Amber called. “You got a ticket? No! So many of our veterinarians have gotten tickets there. They just sit and wait. You should fight it. Really. Anyway yep, the fecal came back and it’s way high. I stopped counting. Worm everyone in your barn once but worm Apache three days in a row. Keep them all in so you can clean up all the poop and remove it. In fact, you should pick up all the goat and sheep poop in your yard for the last two weeks.”

   “What? Do you know how much that is? It’s everywhere. In little holes, clumps of grass everywhere.”

   “It would be worth it.” She said before going to a barbecue at Dr. Potts’ house.

   I drove home thinking of how my two hundred dollar vet bill just got a lot more expensive. I’d go to court like she suggested. It’s all I could do now. We got home and Alexis helped me de-worm everyone before closing up the barn for the night. Tired, I looked at the paint container with the brushes still in it sitting on the ladder. I&apos;d barely gotten started. Grabbing the bucket I went in and began rinsing the brushes. I had one more call to make.

   “Hey Andrea, it’s Denise again. I just wanted to let you know what happened to Apache.” I said as I loosened the stiffened hairs of the brushes and I went on to explain what had happened.

   “Well, I’m so relieved. After I spoke with you I thought that if he died, I’d try and meet you in Ellensburg and give you another lamb. I know how much he means to the kids.”

   “That is so sweet of you. Thankfully, it’s not necessary today was a win.” I said tears coming to my eyes at how thoughtful a gesture that was.

   “Yes it was.”

   “The day didn’t go exactly as planned, but I thought the money I spent on vet bills I was going to have to spend on euthanasia so I consider myself lucky. Everyone’s alive.

   “I think that’s it.” She agreed. “On a farm death is just another part of life and if you think you’re in charge the animals and the elements will let you know otherwise. You do what they tell you to do.”

   “And they’re awfully bossy. Did I tell you the vet wanted me to pick up two weeks of goat and sheep poop?” I said amused

   “You’re kidding!” Andrea laughed uproariously. “She was kidding wasn’t she? She had to be.&quot;

   “No. She was completely serious. Can you imagine?” I said incredulously sharing a conspiratal farm girl laugh releasing the tension of the day.

   “Well, she may treat them, but she never owned ‘em that’s impossible. You’d never be able to find them all.” She laughed again.

   “I know.I know.” I agreed.

 May 15th Weighting For A Parade 
 
   

 (early attendees enjoy the sunshine) 

   Henry shoved a permission slip in my hands a few weeks ago and said, “Sign this and I need $15.00 dollars. We’re going on a band field trip.” A dutiful parent I signed. As is usual with Henry, it was the last day to turn it in and despite my loud morning reminders about the importance of a prompt departure, we were making it to school by the skin of our teeth. So I really had no idea what I’d signed. The band field trip I’d learned yesterday was the Ski to Sea Junior Parade. The band meeting was a 2 hour dress rehearsal. All the middle school bands in Bellingham were combining to make a city middle school band and march in the parade.

 

   The annual Ski to Sea Challenge and the Junior version is a relay consisting of seven legs going from Mt. Baker to Bellingham Bay. It begins with 1. cross country 2. downhill / snowboard 3. running 4. biking 5. canoe 6. biking and finally 7. sea kayaking.

   To kick off the Ski to Sea Challenge and the Junior event there are barbecues, golf tournaments and sundry other celebrations including parades. So today I found a comfy seat on some sun soaked grass across from Bellingham High, donned my sunglasses, and waited for Lisa to join me. She was in constant phone contact trying to make it around blockades and barriers with Quinn who was not having a good day. In the interim I chatted with some Bellinghamsters and waited. It seems the Internet marked the start time as 5:00 P.M but the Bellingham Herald reported it as 6:00 P.M.

   I&apos;d arrived at 4:30 so I&apos;d be on time and really didn&apos;t mind the wait. I love a parade. Not all parades I suppose. I love the Rose Parade with it&apos;s intricate detail and I love the idea of wearing a uniform and belonging to a group. In high school I was on the drill team. My high school, Calabasas High, was brand new. When I got there as a freshman we only had 9th, 10th and 11th grades. We got to vote on the school colors, mascot and logo. Everyone it seemed wanted to be involved. I desperately wanted to be the cheerleader type, but just wasn’t. Those girls were much perkier, but undaunted I chose the drill team. A decision that lives in infamy.

 (Ronald warms up the crowd) 

   The drill team had to practice before school almost every morning and then our first class was P.E. so we could continue rehearsing. There were probably more than a hundred girls marching in unison learning to take 22 and a half-inch parade steps. It was fun. It was fun until we learned about the weigh in. Each Monday we were required to stand on a scale in front of everyone and see if our weight was acceptable. You were allowed five pounds for every inch above 5’. I was 5’2”, which meant I must weigh 110lbs. As a muscular girl and early developer I did not. Those who did not make it were deemed “The Fat Squad” and were not allowed to perform with the group on Fridays at pep rallies or anything else. On Fridays we had to wear our uniforms and go to the pep rallies just like everyone else. Here comes the humiliating part. The drill team would sit in the stands in a huge gold and brown stripe down the middle of the puberty riddled student body and then after the peppy cheerleaders and amazing song leaders it would rise to march down and take the shiny gym floor. It was at this moment when the space around the fat squad would become a vast wasteland of wooden bench seats. There’d we’d be, me, my friend from fourth grade, Catherine McDonald, Stacy Montgomery and about ten other girls that comprised our group. The stares, questions and jokes were at times the worst and most memorable of my life. Week after week we’d starve ourselves not to be part of that Friday humiliation. My mom hated the drill team and wanted our advisor fired. She ranted about discrimination, self-image and all kinds of women’s rights. She wanted to call the district and complain but like a fool, another name for embarrassed teenage girl, I continued to try and be a square peg in a round hole. I dieted, starved myself, spit and continued to weigh in. Occasionally I made it and felt a surge of pride. I actually thought I was going to get to march at Disneyland in the parade down Main Street. I’d made weigh in, my mom came and everything. However, at the eleventh hour we had one last weigh in and I was asked not to participate. I was crushed. I’d practiced and practiced, my parade steps were exact and my movements crisp. I quit the drill team and ditched P.E. going to Howard Johnsons for the &quot;Ham Quickie&quot; breakfast with Catherine on Fridays.

   Once Lisa arrived, Quinn decided to stay in the car for undisclosed reasons, she bought us each non-fat lattes and we began chatting with an older woman who’d volunteered many years on the Tournament of Roses floats.

 (Rose parade volunteer) 

   “Did you work a lot with black pepper?” Lisa asked after hearing of a zebra construction. The woman clad in Pepto Bismol™ pinktold us application techniques for seaweed and how she used status, the way to hold a flower properly and extolled the amazing shading virtues one can achieve with different brands of coffee grounds. It seems she stayed in an RV on site and worked as many shifts as she could. We thought of our friend, Laura a master of the parade wave; she’d been one of the highly prestigious Rose Court, an actual crown clad Rose Princess.

   The Parade wasn’t long. There wasn’t a fancy float in sight, but the annual Ski to Sea Junior parade had a lot of charm. There were kids in Barbie Cars, numerous bands, lots of walkers with silly hats, some “floats”, some dogs on wagons as well as quite a few bicycles and a dragon. “Maybe Fort Flashback should have an entry next year.” Lisa suggested. “I can just see you walking the goats or using the Abe and Andy to pull a cart” as an overweight pony went by.

 (Toby the pony) 

   A chill went down my spine, but as I looked around at the chubby flag twirlers I realized those days are behind me.

 May 13th Horsing Around 
  
   (Grumpy anti-photo Quinn on her birthday with Henry and Lauren) 
 ( Phoebe beating up Henry)

 (Henry, Phoebe and lovely little Lauren)

 
    Lisa had come home with me for our new work exchange program. I cleaned her carpets last week on Quinn’s birthday and today she is mopping my kitchen and putting in a few rows of seeds in the garden. In the process we get to discuss our children, catch up on our friends and commiserate on the river of life that is laundry.

   We knocked off about 2:00 P.M. as the floor was clean, Luther’s toenails were clipped, the tomatoes, artichokes and carrots were in the ground and we’d all but decided Awesomez should move to Bellingham whether she thought it was a good idea or not. Plus we had to get to the kids’ middle school track meet.

   Lisa spearheaded the hot beverage acquisition while I collected Phoebe and found seats at Civic Field. Spring had disappeared behind a cloud. Suddenly, the sunny stadium was cold and damp, misty rain blew sideways on an Arctic wind turning my sleek flat-ironed hair into a Brillo™ pad. Phoebe and I must have looked like orphaned seal pups huddled together bracing ourselves against the unexpected cold. Walking in with a sleeping bag she’d had in her car Lisa started laughing when she saw us. “I guess you’re ready for this.” She chuckled unfurling the bundle. Welcome warmth enveloped us. Phoebe positioned herself in the middle her white translucent skin had a bluish quality in the cold. I thought she could easily pass as a vampire.

 (Henry doing the softball throw) 

   “Could you be any whiter?” I demanded.

   “Yes actually. This is me after a week in Cancun.” She giggled with a mischievous smile. We scanned the field for Henry and Quinn. Henry as easy to spot, all you have to do was look down for the orange socks. Quinn wasn’t much harder, you just let your eyes drift over the top of the crowd and she’s usually the tallest one like her father. Henry was warming up for some of his field events. He was doing shot put and the softball throw as well as hurdles and the 4-man relay. Quinn had opted not to do the hurdles this year, but was doing the 400 and the relay.

   Just as Chris took his seat we saw Henry taking his lane for the hurdles. I thought he’d be pretty good because of his agility. I was shocked at Henry’s technique. “He looks like a bunny!” I said to Phoebe. “Have you ever seen anyone go over like that?”

   “No he looks weird. What’s he doing?’ Phoebe asked. “He touches his feet as he goes over. He’s fast, but look he touches his toes!” And he did. He seemed to be gliding through the air effortlessly. He didn’t really take off on one foot and travel forward as you would expect but went straight up like a bunny.

   “C’mon Henny he’s going to get you come on, come on, push, push, push!” Lisa shrieked like she was at a roller derby rink. He came in second.

   Quinn graced us with her presence while she changed into her cleats. As she laced up she asked with disdain, “Did you see how Henry hurdles? He hops like a bunny.”

   “That’s what we thought.” Phoebe exclaimed.

 (Henry takes a break and visits us in the stands) 

   “The coach thinks Henry’s really fast. He could win, but he has to change how he hurdles or they won’t let him race.” Quinn said with great concern.

   “Well it is only his first race.” Lisa chimed in.

   “I’m just saying in high school they won’t let him race if he hurdles like that.” High school he’s in sixth grade in his first race. Middle school girls, whatever.

   After informing us of Henry’s dire future in track, Quinn took the starting line. Watching her brought back memories of her first meet. I think she was in kindergarten or maybe it was in first grade. Tall for her age even then, but such a little Quinnderella. She’d come in dead and I mean dead last. Her long gangly coltish legs just didn’t move with much urgency. She was the kind of child who said excuse me when she played basketball. After the race she’d told Lisa “I felt like everyone else had a horse and I was on a pony.” Now she was running the 400 and looking confident and composed. As she took off out of the start she made up the stagger with ease. She was in the lead from the first turn and extended it for the rest of the race. It gets you out of your seat to see her pass EVERYONE like that. You
think she can&apos;t keep it up- until she does! Wow! Our little Secretariat learned how to move
those legs. Nearing the finish line Henry started running along side her on the grassy field next to the track cheering her on. Tears came to my eyes as she loped easily over the finish line. Henry ran over to hug and congratulate her, but she pushed him away barely able to stand up straight completely spent.

 ( Henry on the grass willing Quinn on as she nears the finish line ) 

   “She leaves it all on the field.” Lisa observed proudly.

   The shot put was hard to see as it was on the other side of the stadium and there was a shed in the way. Henry did OK in the softball throw, but not great. Not doing well at the softball throw? I’m sure this is somehow my genetic fault. Next, was the relay. One of Henry’s teammates was missing so they had to get a substitute and they were understandably nervous about the hand-off. Henry did the second leg of the race and took off like a bat out of hell coming from behind and passing the rest of the runners. “My God, he runs just like Dad. It’s Dad as an eleven-year-old Denise.” Lisa exclaimed. And she was right he did, he had the same movements, intensity and stride. In a flash, like a tape recorder I could hear my mother explaining, “Look he’s got a lot of flaws but we had a lot of laughs and he’s got good genes.”
Henry’s team had trouble with the hand-off and came in third. He took first in the shot put but didn’t come close in the softball throw.

   Chris went back to work, Lisa hurried off to a Humane Society meeting so I was in charge of signing the kids out and getting them home.



 (going home 11-year-old Henry, 8-year-old Phoebe and now the newly13-year-old amazon Quinn) 



On our way to the car Quinn said&quot;Henry you know you&apos;ve really got to change your hurdle.&quot;

   &quot;Why?&quot;

   &quot;Because you could win, you&apos;re really fast.&quot;Quinn stated.

   &quot;No. I couldn&apos;t win, the other kid beat me by a couple of seconds.&quot;

   &quot;Seriously Henry you&apos;re fast. You&apos;ll make up a lot of time changing your form.&quot;

   &quot;I don&apos;t think I can&quot;Henry admitted.

   &quot;You can Henry. I know you can and you&apos;ll win.&quot;Quinn encouraged.

   &quot;You really think so.&quot;

   &quot;I really do. You&apos;re good.&quot;

   &quot;Thanks Quinn. You were really amazing.&quot;

   &quot;Whatever, can we go?&quot;Phoebe whined as they all hopped in the car.

 May 11th Birds Of A Feather 
 
    

   We were late. I didn’t have time to brew a pot of coffee,
but thankfully poured myself the last cup of yesterday’s Deadman’s Reach barked
a few reminders at Henry and went upstairs to throw some clothes on.

   The seat was up on the toilet annoyed I couldn&apos;t seem to train Henry, I put it down and set
my coffee on top of it. Digging through the pile of clothes on the floor I
found a sweatshirt and my pair of work jeans. Wriggling into them I gathered my
hair in a ponytail, brushed my teeth and went to sit down to put my socks on.
As I sat, I felt the hot coffee flood my backside as the cup tipped over
spreading all over the floor. Mourning the loss of my coffee I changed into my
coveralls and stomped downstairs. Wisely, Henry took one look at me and
silently gathered his things. We were out the door with four dogs in tow.

 (Bruno - a little nervous?) 

   Lisa was finally removing Bruno’s equipment this morning and
the other dogs were along for the ride. We saw a small rafter of Black Spanish
turkeys along Mt. Baker Highway. The very same variety the big hoo-haa town meeting had been about in Acme. The letter I received after the meeting had said it was decided there would be
no wild turkeys released in Whatcom County. Was that was overturned?   Or had the birds not been informed of
the decision and migrated on their own? Or had some renegade hunter taken
matters into his own hands? Whatever, there they were about four or five big as life walking along
the highway.

   As we drove a long considering the turkey options I was
grumpy from my coffee mishap. Henry was properly sympathetic when he heard
which helped. We chatted about the Canada goslings. “I’m going to call about
what to do with them when I get home.”

   “But I want to keep them.” Henry whined.

   “Tough. I know they’re cute, but all the babies are cute.
And this brings me to another topic. Do you think you can handle eating a
chicken if we raise some? I mean we won’t name them, but I can’t get a bunch of
chickens and have six roosters running around. They’ll fight and who knows
what.”

   “I think I can now after everything with the geese.   Can we name some of them?” He asked
hopefully wanting to use a whole bunch of names from the Illiad. 

   “After we get to know them maybe. It’s just that raising
animals that will help sustain us seems to be the way we’re going. I’m as
shocked as you are at the idea of eating something we raise, but chickens mean
eggs and if we decide we can eat them, meat. I’ve resisted chickens. You know I’m
afraid of them, but Toby swears it’ll be ok and my friend Cynthia Lynn says there’s
a chicken a woman raised like a dog. I do dogs quite well, so I think your dad and I have decided to give chickens a try.”

   “I don’t want to eat Andy.” Henry proclaimed.

   “We’re not eating Andy. We’re not eating anything we name.
I’m not Maryruth yet.” I replied wondering why I hadn’t heard from her in a
while.

 (the way they were) 

   I dropped off Henry and Bruno and headed home to deal with
my wayward goslings. I was shocked to find only one where I’d left two. Alexis
had obviously fed all the barn animals. Had one not made it through the night? I
called him on his cell phone.

   “No there were two snuggled up together about a half-hour
ago. Look again.”

   I searched the room, I searched the barn and then widened my
circle to include the yard. I inched my way around tall grass and listened for
peeping. Nothing. Lisa called with a Bruno update. “Keep looking. Maybe it went back to the pasture.” She suggested.

 (my lure) 

   I kept looking. I let the geese out to roam around thinking
the little fella would come to the gaggle. Alexis came home and while I brewed
a pot of coffee and called the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, he diligently took
up the search. I could see him tromping all over scanning every inch of the
yard as Lloyd and his crew trailed behind. We couldn’t help thinking of Colt. 

 (waiting in Mike&apos;s old room) 

 (safe and sound) 

      Lisa called again.&quot;The patient is out of surgery and awake.&quot;

   &quot;You
didn&apos;t Chocolate Chip him&quot; a reference to our bunny, Chocolate Chip,
who didn&apos;t make it through surgery - due to no fault of Lisa&apos;s. 

   &quot;NO I didn&apos;t Chocolate Chip him. He&apos;s fine. Any luck?&quot;She asked.

   &quot;Nope.&quot;

   &quot;Well, it is a
migratory bird, with hardy genes. They&apos;re strong and if anyone has a
good sense of direction it’s going to be a migratory bird.&quot;She reasoned.

      I waited until
the afternoon then packed up our little friend to go to the center. Just as I was
driving out of the driveway, I could hear Canada geese honking. I looked
around, but didn’t see them. Perhaps our little adventurer had found the
mama.   Yes, I think or choose to
think that’s what happened. I want to believe that’s what happened. After all,
we didn’t find a body. It wasn’t cold. The sun was shining and our yard is
pretty safe all fenced in now. Not completely safe, but with Alexis and I in
the yard most of the day a predator isn’t going to go out of its way to hunt
here.

 (Ready to ride) 

 (at Nugents&apos;Corner) 

   I drove to the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. It was
surprisingly close by In fact, I could see Dodsons&apos;IGA from the parking lot. There was an
owl flying in an enclosure as I walked up and pictures of rescued
animals covered a presentation board when I walked in. I pictured
myself bottle
feeding a raccoon.&quot;Do you happen to need volunteers?&quot;I inquired after
filling out the paperwork.

   &quot;Always&quot;smiling Stacy said as she looked up the diet of Canada geese. We&apos;d had a discrepancy. She thought they ate blood worms and I maintained they were herbivores.

   I picked up the Pheeb from a friend&apos;s house and told her about the day.&quot;Do you think we could take one of the animals home for a night?&quot;She asked wide-eyed.

   &quot;I don&apos;t think so, but you never know.&quot;I answered smiling at her enthusiasm. We waited for Henry and Phoebe told him the days events.

   &quot;Do you think we could take one of the animals home? Like a racoon? We could name him Oliver.&quot;He asked. We were all cut from the same cloth.

 May 10th Are You My Mama? 
 
 ( leader of the band)     

   At 5:30 A.M.I heard a deafening
racket outside my window. It was as if some gang of marauding teenagers had
pulled up and cranked their stereo. It was the crooning of every flipping ding-dang
songbird in the forest greeting the dawn. I pried my eyes open realizing sleep
would not return with battle of the bands outside my window. I perked up as I
remembered Alexis’ Mother’s Day gift. The bag of Deadman’s Reach was downstairs
waiting to be ground into an aromatic elixir sure to revive me. As I poured my
first medicinal cup Henry bestowed on me a compass drawing he did in school and
then I received a pastel pink and yellow heart on printer paper only slightly
crumpled on one side like it had been stuffed in a sixth-grade&apos;s notebook. I
gazed upon the drawing&quot;Happy Mother&apos;s Day, I love you&quot;was scrolled in tidy penmanship. It was full of emotion and care save the crumpled part. But then out came the piece de resistance a card with a fold and a
saying. It wasn’t full of scribbles or too much erasing. It didn&apos;t have creases, rips or tears. I welled
up. He’d listened. My son, a husband in training.

 (My card- lettering learned from Miss Elberfeld (4th grade) - yellow is my favorite color) 

 (sweet) 

   Dressed and ready for the day I met Alexis outside. He’d
already fired up the tractor and true to his word was scraping the mat of weeds
off with the sharp edge of the bucket. It was a bright sunshiny day and now
that the fence was finished my four-legged lawnmowers, the goats, sheep and
Miracle were out chomping the lawn. This is the way I dreamed it would be:   goats meandering by like they stepped
out of “Heidi” taking nibbles of pine while the sheep drifted by the purple Agapanthus
like strange clouds, the geese chatted by the barn while Miracle kept watchful
eye on everyone as I sipped my coffee.

 (Alexis clearing the land) 

   After Alexis went off to work, my sister called and said
she, Chris and the kids were going to head out for the afternoon. All the
better to garden I thought.

   Before Team Donaldson arrived, Henry and I started to work. “Mama.
I just want to let you know, I almost put you were more special than Awesomez on the card,
but I erased it. I just couldn’t say it. I mean I love you and you’re my Mama,
but well you understand, she is Awesomez.” Henry explained tap dancing as fast
as he could.

   “I understand, I love her too.” I assured him.&quot;Now hush up and pull the Rhododendron the whole plant is poisonous to the goats.&quot;

   I’d let the cows out of the pasture again. This time I felt
confident because we’d installed two gates. One gate blocks the barn animals
from going into the road and the other gate keeps them from going down toward
the pond. This in turn will keep Abe, Anna and Andy down munching on grass in
what was our old cornfield. Or so I thought, until I looked up and saw Andy
giving me the eye as we worked in the garden and before I knew it he&apos;d found the
one weak spot in the fence and charged through it. He wasn’t exactly a raging
bull, but he got the job done. Suddenly Abe and Anna were in hot pursuit.
Miracle was stunned at the sight of these new ruminants. I worried she might be
like Quinn who does not like to be in the company of someone older and taller
than her. “A person can be older or taller, but not both. Actually, I like to
be older and taller if possible,” Quinn says whenever anyone will listen. If
Miracle was like Quinn we might have a barnyard brawl. Would she attack or
would the cows chase the goats like true “bullies”? I stood ready to react, but
it was as calm as a nativity.

 (Deciding the best place to be is on the other side of any fence) 

 (mowing my lawn) 

 ( everybody eats) 

 (happy cows) 

   We set back to work hoeing and taking tractor loads of
debris away. We were hard at work when the Donaldsons pulled up. After some
quick hugs and hellos we decided to break for lunch. In the kitchen Quinn asked “So
what did Henry give you for Mother’s Day?”

   “He cleaned my room.” I said proudly.

   “Girl clean? Or boy clean?” Phoebe inquired.

   “Girl clean.” I assured her. “He vacuumed, put stuff away
and I got a card too, plus a neck warmer-thingy.”

   “Girl clean? That’s good Henry.” Phoebe praised.

 (Phoebe and Henry climb trees for entertainment) 

 (monkey-boy) 

 (Lunch is served in the tree as requested) 

 (Miracle with her fly mask on relaxing) 

 (working girls)
 

   After sandwiches we jumped back on the project. Phoebe and I
manned the tractor bringing in loads from the compost pile.

   “This is some goooood shit.” I exclaimed as I savored the
aroma, digging out a nice big load.

   “Really” she confirmed as we examined the sample teeming
with earthworms.Lisa and Chris were hard at work mixing up the amendments
and leveling the ground while Henry insisted on throwing knives at a tree and
Quinn read a book.

   “Do we have to keep the garden gate closed all the time?”
Lisa yelled over the tractor.

   “Actually yes, it seems the sheep like blueberries.” I
yelled back.

   “Hey! Stop!” Lisa giggled. I turned back to see what she was
talking about. “It’s nothing,&quot;she waved,&quot;I just never had a sheep nibble my ankle before.” Apache was giving her kisses.

   Phoebe, Lisa, Chris and I got the garden to a point where we
were ready to put in rows when we noticed there were no bells.

   “No bells that can only mean one thing.” I said wondering
how they could have gotten out. “Do you think they knocked down the fence?” I
asked. “I mean I know that’s not what you’d expect from a cow, but how else?” I
asked half to myself as we began to walk the fence line with Anna who was also
wondering where those good for nothing steers went off to leaving her behind.

   “I hear them.” I said listening to the faint clinking of
cowbells. Turning my head toward the sound. I saw them in my only neighbor’s
yard they’d hopped the fence.

   “Who wants a cookie?” Lisa yelled in a high-pitched voice.&quot;Who wants a cookie?&quot;She repeated. In only a couple of times, the boys were running not walking back, and over the
fence they went.


   “It surprises me every time how nimble they are.” I reflected.   “But you know “ I said imitating my
father, “there was that one f----- who went over the moon.” Lisa laughed. It
was still funny.

   We came back to find Quinn in the garden. She’d finished her
book and was wondering if they could still make it to the bookstore tonight. As
she stood around not helping she began standing on one of the garden stakes.
Balancing on one foot she said, “If this was a little wider this would be like
Survivor.”   

   “Hey let me try.” Chris said as he climbed up on the stick.
“One-one-thousand-two-one- thousand. . .” the girls chanted in unison until
Chris dramatically fell off.

 (Chris doesn&apos;t survive) 

   “You two are the slowest counters I’ve ever heard.” He
complained.

   “I did it longer.” Quinn said all smiles.

   “Let me try.” Phoebe insisted and then naturally, Lisa and I
had to have a turn. We were now counting and competing for the best time.

   “This is fun.” Phoebe laughed, “Farm fun.”

   “Hey Quinn, you could do this at your birthday party.” Lisa
laughed.&quot;You young&apos;ens would have a lot of fun.&quot;she hillbillied.

   “Great. My friends will say, gosh that party was fun. Quinn
had us stand on a stick. No. They wouldn’t get it, but just so you know I think
I&apos;ve won with the best time.”

   “No. I did.” I corrected.

   “No. I did.” She said incorrectly. Being younger, I let her
believe she was right poor thing, but as the winner I knew. I knew I had the
better time she just couldn’t handle it.

   With all our falderal we got the stakes up and the string,
but it was time to call it quits. Henry and Phoebe wanted one last knife
throwing demonstration over by their tree. Most of us went to watch, but Quinn
disappeared until she came out the front door. “Denise? Who’s this?” Quinn
asked holding up a gosling. I gasped.

   “I don’t know! We’ve never met!” I was stunned. “Quinn where
did you get that?” I asked completely confused. That was not one of Clara’s it
was yellow and downy. I looked at it again. Its bill was black just like it’s
feet. Clearly this was a Canada gosling. 

 (in search of a Mother) 

   “I found it walking across the lawn. I heard it peep and
looked up and there it was, so I picked it up before the dogs saw it. Then
Bruno took off like a shot for the fence down by the pasture. Maybe there are
more.” So Quinn holding on to her charge showed us where Bruno had gone and we
formed a search party. Looking and listening for peeping. I went and got Mabel
to see if her honks would flesh anyone out of the tall grass. Just as we were
all about to give up, Quinn found another one in a most remote area. We looked
for the mother. The two goslings had been quite a distance away, and no one
could locate a possible nest. I’d seen Canada geese in the pasture, but not
hanging around the creek nor did I have any idea where the nest could be.

   “This is so weird, they need to find a mother on Mother’s
Day.” Henry remarked. “Hey Quinn does this make them your babies? You’re the
goose girl.” Quinn smiled wryly as she wiped goose poop out of the nest in her sweatshirt.

 (twice the fun on Mother&apos;s Day) 

   “It’s OK they’re just babies.” She replied cheerfully as we went to the barn and decided to try Mabel with the
goslings.

   “She sat on her eggs for a good long time, maybe she’ll think
they’d hatched while she was out. “ I suggested.

   “That’s some while you were out.” Phoebe laughed. Lisa took
the goslings and rubbed her scent on them while she wasn’t looking. Mabel
wanted nothing to do with them, so we tried Ruthie. She wouldn’t take them
under her wing either. Next, we tried Clara, the proven mother, but she was too
consumed with worry over her goslings that she didn’t relax.

   So we tried another tactic. We got Quackmire involved, after
all, he’d been an excellent guardian to Clara’s hatch. Then we tried Ruthie
again. No good, she just acted like she wanted to get away from Quackie. So we
brought Mabel back in. Perhaps they’d be OK if the two of them were in there
like Lloyd and Clara. I put the incubation light a safe distance away from the
straw. We didn’t really need the adults to care for them as long as they
protected them from any nocturnal predators like barn rats.

 (Foster Family) 

   “What do you want to name them?” Henry asked about 43 times.

   “I don’t know, some kind of outcast name like the elf who
wants to be a dentist. What was his name?” Quinn mused.

   “I don’t remember.” Henry answered. “How about Romulus and
Remus? Or Oenone, the wood-nymph?”

   “Uhhh no.” Quinn responded authoritatively.

   “Look we can’t keep them. They’re migratory birds they need
to learn to fly.” Lisa said.

   “They do? Won’t they just know?” Quinn was confused.

   “Didn’t you watch ‘Fly Away Home about 35 times?” Lisa asked incredulously

   “Henry, the guy who shot ‘Fly Away Home’ Caleb, is the dad
of Zooey Deschanel the girl in ‘Yes Man’. Anyway, I think the goslings are ok
for the night. I’ll keep checking on them, but in the morning I’m calling the
Wildlife Refuge.” I announced as we shut the barn door.

   “Mama, you relax, I’ll make dinner.” Henry said losing
interest in the idea before he got to the kitchen. The phone rang as I got out the steamer. It was
Awesomez’ daughter, little Lindsey, “Rizzo,I want to make my mom dinner, but I don’t know what to
make. I need help.” she bleated.

   “Whatdya got?” I said pulling out my ingredients.

   (Henry and his buddy, Irish, have forgotten about making dinner)

 April 25th A Barbie Girl Living In A Barbie World 
    
 (Showbiz a floribunda )

   When you’re broke, and I mean really broke not struggling, not conserving, not tightening your belt, but afraid your debit card will get rejected broke, it dominates your every purchase, your every thought. And if you’re not, you can’t put yourself in that place. With this in mind and starving, I suggested we all go out to a breakfast joint. Breakfast is the cheapest meal of the day; you can get a bowl of oatmeal for about $ 4.00 and be full for hours. That was my plan, so off we headed to breakfast and on the way ended up at BJ’s Brewery for lunch. I didn’t want to be disagreeable so I taciturnly nodded benign agreement. I scanned the menu for the most affordable item. Minestrone soup. I tried not to pout, but as I watched them eat salads and sandwiches and order beers I couldn’t help it. I was hungry and this was not filling me up.

   The other thing I wanted to do with my money was go and get a cheap pedicure. Washington does not have pedicure deals like the Valley and instead of a trip to Cancun or the Bahamas, a facial or an expensive lunch I wanted a pedicure – to relax, a treat to make me feel pampered and a celebration of the day. While I was on the phone checking on Henry while my friends bought me a bottle of nail polish remover to help me save money. It was very kind and I knew they were right, I shouldn’t squander my cash on treats but I was disappointed. The day was not going according to plan.

   We moved on to Nordstrom Rack where we looked and shopped and browsed. I tried on cheap jewelry and found a necklace I might want but figured it didn’t go with my coveralls so I decided not to spend my pennies. However, when we got back to the hotel I found Laura had purchased the necklace for “herself” and for me to borrow. She’s clever for a blonde.

   From shopping Awesomez and I had to go run errands, pick up balloons, take Henry here and there and get ready for the reunion. With all this activity I barely got my toes painted when we got back and couldn’t take a shower because my polish hadn’t dried. To add insult to injury I discovered I had forgotten my make-up bag. Not my lotions and potions, but the basic necessities eyebrow pencil, eyeliner, shadow etc. Great. I had to borrow. Needless to say this put me in a foul mood. I was ready to stay home and forget the whole damn reunion.

   “Really. Really? You’re going to let this ruin your evening?” Awesomez asked incredulously. She doesn’t wear make-up. She says it makes her look like a clown. She didn’t understand.

   “Really.” I said with belligerent defiance. I knew we were close enough for me to yell at her and she wouldn’t flinch. Oh she wouldn’t like it, she’d be sad but she would still love me in the morning. A knock at the door saved her from my complete I-don’t-have-my-eyebrow-pencil-meltdown. Bar-back Barbie, June, walked in with bags of wine laughing and smiling dressed in a cool blue-grey blouse that set off her eyes. Without bothering with hellos after so many years I asked. “June, I’m in a crisis. This top? Or this top?” I pointed to the orange one Laura had given me in January.

 ( Spooneta Mondetta looking stunning) 

   “Hmm I’m intrigued by the orange one. Put it on” It was like so many years ago as roommates she hadn’t missed a beat. “No. The black one is slimming.”

   “These shoes? Or the others?”

   “Those they look good with your toes.” She said with authority. I was beginning to breathe.

   “Belt? Or necklace?” I said with desperation.

   “Definitely the belt. Focal point. I like the cool way you tuck the blouse.” She said pouring the wine and handing me a glass.

   Despite June’s spot on assistance, I was still in the tail end of a snit as we parked; Awesomez turned to me and said before we walked through the doors “I hope you’re going to be able to enjoy the evening.”

   “I’m a party girl and this is a party. I will pull it together. I’m not going to get another chance to see all these people.” And I did. I laughed and talked and talked and laughed. What I talked about I have barely any idea. I hugged and remembered and took pictures in between margaritas. It was an amazing time full of memories and plans for the future. While I was there I booked visitors in June, July and August and I’m crossing my fingers they all show. After the party about thirty people came back to our room for margaritas and bottles of wine. Chicken wings showed up from somewhere and Awesomez’ oatmeal raisin cookies were violated.

 ( Awesomez -Lisa #1-with the boys- Pat, Jeff and Gary) 

 ( Lisa #5 enjoying the evening- comfortable with the paparazi at this point) 
 ( Laura and Barbara Jordan) 

   The next morning, a day with out obligations or chores I woke up to Awesomez who’d been transformed into “Crack-of-flipping-Dawn Barbie and a room that smelled like a fast food restaurant. We hit the ground running. A shower and our daily hike out to move the car before we got a ticket on a side street off Canoga. Then we piled in the car with June to shuttle Henry to his next destination and on to my long-awaited cheap breakfast!
 (Henry and his new friend Salsa - he says she&apos;s spicy) 

   “Henry this is June my old roommate.” I said introducing Henry through the car window.

   “Hey June! Hey Awesomez!” he said before getting in. Climbing in the car and slamming the door Henry paused for a moment. “You know there’s just way too much estrogen in the air.” I didn’t even know he knew the word estrogen. We were going to have to talk. I looked at him laughing and full of joy. He’d been having a great time and I was thrilled. My friend, Susan Iverson, said he had achieved “Rock Star Status” and I was happy for him, but my heart also ached knowing he didn’t have this kind of friendship at home. Why had I taken him from all of this? Did I do the right thing for him? Had I been selfish? I’d thought I was doing it for the family but perhaps I’d rationalized. Well, I’d have to think about that tomorrow. We drove past our old house and although I wanted to get out and start knocking on my old neighbor’s doors I knew I couldn’t with a car full of hungry women.

 ( death by snuggling - the kid tries to kill me) 
 (our old house) 

   After listening to the conversation Henry said before he got out of the car, “I think I should be Metro Barbie” and he hugged June and Awesomez good-bye. We really were going to have to talk. I got out of the car and deposited Henry. He was happy and all seemed to be going my way. Until I got back in the car and found Awesomez had answered my phone. She’d told some Barbies that we’d meet them back at the hotel to eat. The hotel! I didn’t want to pay those prices. I snapped. Snapped. Seriously throwing a tantrum. I just wanted a nice economical time full of fun and laughter. Somehow though I just came off as a control freak. No one understood that going back to the hotel was going to be too expensive. It’s like telling a poor person to shop at Costco. Sure you get more for your money, but if you don’t have the money to buy seventy-five rolls of paper towels it does you no good. I started yelling at Awesomez the kind of yelling you reserve for family. The kind of yelling you only do when you know that your bad behavior will be in time forgiven and forgotten although there is a chance it will be held over your head, but you’re so upset you don’t care. I was hungry and I didn’t want to spend a lot of money – again.

   “But I already told them we’d go.” Awesomez said innocently having no idea how to tame the wild beast I was becoming. She’s sweet and soft spoken and she was totally out of her element. “I want you to be happy,” she said desperately. “What did I do? I just want everyone to get along.” She knew I was broke and I knew she knew I was broke, but as I said when you have more than five dollars in your pocket you just don’t understand how it feels to count each cent. Probably because she believed she&apos;d pay for me, she assumed it, she wanted to take care of me. &quot;You can&apos;t take it with you&quot; she&apos;d say quoting her father, but I couldn&apos;t make that assumption. I couldn&apos;t rely on her kindness and leech off her. She&apos;s my friend not a lottery ticket.

   Heroically, June slipped into Human Resources Barbie and drove back to the hotel. She calmly and cordially invited all those seated at the table to join us at Cables on Ventura Blvd for breakfast. And off we went.

   June ordered enough food to feed a village. She then decided she herself wasn’t a village, but tall enough to be described as a peninsula. “I just made that up.” She said and every one laughed as though they were drunk at 10:00AM. “I like to put together amazing bites of food.” She explained skewering a piece of turkey sausage.

   My sister who had joined us said “Well it looks like you’ve put together a breakfast shish kabob.” And it did, she had egg, waffle, meat and lord knows what else on that fork every time. It was an interesting technique. In fact, I’d eyed her last bit of pancake hungrily and was just about to stab it without permission when she suddenly without warning lopped it on top of a tomato. Weight Watchers would be happy I didn’t need the calories. With the financial hysteria behind me, the breakfast was a just another sidesplitting, eye-wiping laugh fest. Awesomez pulled the big sister card and paid my bill.

   When we got back to the hotel, we ran into Cindy who said she was sorry she’d missed us for breakfast. She said they knew I was a bit tight for funds and somehow had been given a free breakfast buffet ticket and had saved it for me. My heart filled, these were my friends.

   The day just went from one activity to another. No sooner did we get back to the hotel and sit down look at the clock and realize we had to leave again. It was almost time for the second game in the CSUN Softball double header and my little sister Barbara Jordan is the head coach. So off we went to Northridge tired and a little bleary-eyed. I was excited we were going to watch Barb. In college rain or shine I’d go to all her practices and all her home games and many of her away games including driving up to San Luis Obispo. I’d admired the work and dedication of the whole team and though they were reluctant they finally let me put make-up on almost of all of them even Mishy McAnany – third base gave in.

   Awesomez and I strode up to the ticket booth and I insisted on paying for her ticket. I know it was a small gesture, but that’s all I have right now. She graciously thanked me as if I was the one who had paid her plane ticket, hotel bill and breakfast. We sat down in the same stands I’d sat in twenty-five years ago and watched Barb walk her familiar Barbara walk out to the mound. I yelled “C’mon Barb” in my same squeaky high-pitched voice just as I used to. She turned and smiled at me over her shoulder. I was so proud of her, so confident and in charge. I chatted in the stands with her sister, Karen, &quot;Remember when Barb used to steel all the bases Denise?&quot; and I did. The girl had wheels. Karen had been instrumental in my choice of Catholicism. “Follow your heart and trust in God and all good things will come. He knows what you need,” she said encouraging me and reminding me of my faith. I soaked in the warm sunshine and released my problems. I couldn’t think of another afternoon I’d spent at a ball field watching anyone other than my son play in twenty-five years. It was glorious. Especially when I saw how my little sister orchestrated the win using her old stand by to advance the run. - They didn&apos;t call her Bunt Jordan for nothing.

   Afterward, it was on to the 50th Anniversary reunion of CSUN. Tom was joining us there so Awesomez and I walked over traveling through time. She tripped me as we went and I felt seventeen again. The actual reunion was a snore. The tents were disorganized, they ran out of food and there was no actual place for us to gather. So a bunch of us including my sister, Barbara, Awesomez, Cindy, Laura, Tom and our old roommate who never pledged a sorority, Delinah went to dinner at California Pizza Kitchen. It was more eating, more drinking and more laughing. We talked about inspiring kids to like history and good historical fiction. I found out Delinah had dated my eighth grade crush and she promised to come up to the farm to visit.

   It was getting late and Tom needed to get home so Delinah said she’d drive us back to our car still parked near the softball field. We all piled in to hers, which meant Laura had to sit in the child booster seat in the back. Laughing hysterically throwing out ridiculous things like Booster Seat Barbie as we sat under a lamp post in the Northridge Mall parking lot all because of a child’s booster seat and Cheerios™ simply enjoying being together. Delinah, who is now a professor of psychology, was laughing so hard she was doubled over the steering wheel, said thoughtfully as she started the car, “After twenty-five years I finally get why you pledge a sorority. I finally finally get it, too bad.” Funny, at that moment I felt pretty rich.

 April 22nd The Odyssey 
 
       (the San Juan Islands out the window) 
 
 ( the Cascades) 
   An eyelash shy of food stamps these days it was odd to fly the upgrade Lisa got us all at the airport, but non-fat latte in hand I endured the irony of first class. We couldn’t get three seats so Lisa and Henry were together doing a crossword and discussing “Ninety Minutes in Heaven” while I was alone with my thoughts about the events ahead. My trip was painfully scheduled in some ways not allowing for coffee with a friend or a drive to the beach. I was nervous as I looked out the window to the endless sun-soaked sea of swimming pools upon our descent. I hadn’t been back home in two full years.

   Toby and Dean picked us at the airport like no time had passed. Having them back in Los Angeles added to the emotion. The boys chatted in the backseat as we got Lisa’s rental car and all stopped at 7-11 for sodas before Toby and I headed off to Nordstrom Rack while Lisa drove off to Loehman’s (my mom’s very favorite store) and a pedicure.

   As Toby maneuvered the freeway I drank in the warm sunshine. After two years of angst always wondering where to go for things like getting my ring fixed or what restaurant is good it was strangely comforting to know just know where everything is. Every block, every parking space was filled with a lifetime of memories that came flooding back.

Shopping was a bust; although Toby narrowed what I was looking for so I might be able to find an acceptable outfit more easily on my second try. She determined after looking at my bruises, which were now turning an olive green that short sleeves were definitely out of the question.

   Henry, Tom and I reunited at the reported busiest Starbucks in the world located on the corner of Topanga Canyon and Ventura Blvd. We hugged Toby and Dean good-bye for now and moved on to the next leg of our journey.

   Our friends Kathy and Dan, the grandparents of two of my former students Trevor and Ashley offered to take us to dinner. To say Trev and Ashley are simply former students is to say the Great Barrier Reef is just a big bunch of rocks. Trevor and “Ashweena” were part of our family. They went to Yellowstone and Alaska with us. Henry still wears Trevor’s hand-me-downs and receives his castoff Christmas presents. All the kids including Quinn and Phoebe have spent the night together, gone to the beach, camp, had Christmases, birthdays, the zoo, done homework and have even gone to several funerals together. In fact, Trevor, Ashley, Quinn, Henry and Phoebe were together the reason I needed a van in the first place. I hauled the five of them here and there across the valley shleping them to baseball, dance, gymnastics and back and forth from sleepovers. 
 
 (family owned for 47 years) 
   We all met up for Mexican food as the supply in Bellingham is scarce. Walking in, I could feel the memories wrap around me like a blanket. I’d been going there with my family since I was eight years old and have sat in probably every booth. There’s the one we went to when my mother got her masters and then the one when we discovered she had cancer, the one I sat in when I turned twenty one and ordered my first margarita, the one where we celebrated my grandfather’s eightieth and the one where we consoled ourselves in after he died, the one we went to when I visited from Minnesota, the one when Lisa had Quinn, The one when my mother died, the one when Henry was afraid of policemen, the ones when we were fixing up the house and I was too tired to cook, the one when Tom decided he wouldn’t leave me for Kim Basinger even though she was in the next booth, the one where we decided to move to Washington. It was the perfect place to be.
