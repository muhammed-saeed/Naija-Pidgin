Restaurant Shift Manager Job Description
 Written by Natalie Baker 
A restaurant shift manager takes the brunt of customer complaints.
 
 A restaurant shift manager oversees the workers in an eating establishment. He is responsible for delegating tasks to junior members of staff and must ensure that all customers are happy with the service they have received. The restaurant shift manager is expected to deal with customer complaints and this can be the most difficult part of the job role, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 
Education
 
There is no set route in to a career as a restaurant manager. The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that employers generally look for those who have experience in the food industry. The BLS reports that most food service managers have less than a bachelor’s degree; however, employers generally prefer those with some post-secondary education. Most restaurant chains offer a strict training program, which is a mix of practical experience and in-the-classroom learning. Areas covered include personal management, company policies and record keeping.
 

 
Skills
 
A restaurant shift manager should have strong leadership qualities. He is responsible for a team of staff, including kitchen workers and waiters, and must have strong organizational skills and a confident, professional manner. Career Planner notes that restaurant managers should have the ability to give clear concise instructions, good time management skills and good problem-solving and decision-making skills.
 

 
Responsibilities
 
The responsibilities of shift managers vary greatly depending on the establishment. Career Planner notes that typical daily tasks of a restaurant shift manager include keeping equipment inventories, ordering supplies, monitoring employee activities and taking dining reservations. In smaller establishments, shift managers may be required to serve food and seat customers. Shift managers are expected to deal with customer complaints that have been escalated by waiters and waitresses.
 

 
Considerations
 
According to the BLS, food service managers work long hours, sometimes up to 15 per day. Work can be stressful, dealing with irate customers and unwilling staff. The BLS reports that employment is expected to grow by around 5 percent until 2018, slower than in other industries. This is due to fewer eating establishments opening than in the previous decade. Applicants with a degree in a hospitality-based subject will have the edge when applying for jobs in more exclusive restaurants, according to the BLS.
 

 
Salary
 
The salary of a restaurant shift manager varies depending on the location and style of the establishment and the manager’s level of experience. According to the BLS, the average annual salary of a food service manager in May 2008 was $46,320. The lowest 10 percent earned $29,450 while the highest earners made more than $76,940 In May 2008. The BLS notes that some managers may earn additional bonus depending on sales revenue and have the opportunity for additional training.
