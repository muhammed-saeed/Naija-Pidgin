&quot;INNUMERACY: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences&quot; Paulos: скачать, читать бесплатно
 18.11.2010 12:26:47   Категория: Наука, Образование | Математика 
 Автор : John Paulos 


Paulos speaks mainly of the dangers of mathematical innumeracy; that is, the common misconceptions of the layperson in regards to numbers, exploring the relationship between math and the human mind. Paulos discusses innumeracy with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more quantitative way.

Topics include probability and coincidence, the birthday problem, innumeracy in pseudoscience, and statistics and trade-offs in society.

 Praise for INNUMERACY  
&quot;Paulos involves the reader in the fun of numeracy in his entertaining, thought-provoking book.&quot;
 

 

 Introduction  
&quot;Math was always my worst subject.&quot;
 

 1 Examples and Principles  
 
Two aristocrats are out horseback riding and one challenges the other to see which can come up with the larger number. The second agrees to the contest, concentrates for a few minutes, and proudly announces, &quot;Three.&quot; The proposer of the game is quiet for half an hour, then finally shrugs and concedes defeat.
 

 BIG NUMBERS, SMALL PROBABILITIES  
People&apos;s facility with numbers ranges from the aristocratic to the Ramanujanian, but it&apos;s an unfortunate fact that most are on the aristocrats&apos; side of our old Mainer. I&apos;m always amazed and depressed when I encounter students who have no idea what the population of the United States is, or the approximate distance from coast to coast, or roughly what percentage of the world is Chinese. I sometimes ask them as an exercise to estimate how fast human hair grows in miles per hour, or approximately how many people die on earth each day, or how many cigarettes are smoked annually in this country. Despite some initial reluctance (one student maintained that hair just doesn&apos;t grow in miles per hour), they often improve their feeling for numbers dramatically.
 

 BLOOD, MOUNTAINS, AND BURGERS  
In a Scientific American column on innumeracy, the computer scientist Douglas Hofstadter cites the case of the Ideal Toy Company, which stated on the package of the original Rubik cube that there were more than three billion possible states the cube could attain. Calculations show that there are more than 4 x 10 possible states, 4 with 19 zeroes after it. What the package says isn&apos;t wrong; there are more than three billion possible states. The understatement, however, is symptomatic of a pervasive innumeracy which ill suits a technologically based society. It&apos;s analogous to a sign at the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel stating: New York, population more than 6; or McDonald&apos;s proudly announcing that they&apos;ve sold more than 120 hamburgers.
 

 GARGANTUAN NUMBERS AND THE FORBES 400  
A concern with scale has been a mainstay of world literature from the Bible to Swift&apos;s Lilliputians, from Paul Bunyan to Rabelais&apos; Gargantua. Yet it&apos;s always struck me how inconsistent these various authors have been in their use of large numbers.
 

 ARCHIMEDES AND PRACTICALLY INFINITE NUMBERS  
There is a fundamental property of numbers named after the Greek mathematician Archimedes which states that any number, no matter how huge, can be exceeded by adding together sufficiently many of any smaller number, no matter how tiny. Though obvious in principle, the consequences are sometimes resisted, as they were by the student of mine who maintained that human hair just didn&apos;t grow in miles per hour. Unfortunately, the nanoseconds used up in a simple computer operation do add up to lengthy bottlenecks on intractable problems, many of which would require millennia to solve in general. It takes some getting accustomed to the fact that the minuscule times and distances of microphysics as well as the vastness of astronomical phenomena share the dimensions of our human world.
 

 THE MULTIPLICATION PRINCIPLE AND MOZART&apos;S WALTZES  
Now is probably a good time to reiterate my earlier remark that an occasional difficult passage may be safely ignored by the innumerate reader. The next few sections in particular may contain several such passages. The occasional trivial passage likewise may be quite safely ignored by the numerate reader. (Indeed, the whole book may be safely ignored by all readers, but I&apos;d prefer that, at most, only isolated paragraphs will be.)
 

 JULIUS CAESAR AND YOU  
Two final applications of the multiplication principle-one slightly depressing, the other somewhat cheering. The first is the probability of not being afflicted with any of a variety of diseases, accidents, or other misfortunes. Not being killed in a car accident may be 99 percent certain, while 98 percent of us may avoid perishing in a household accident. Our chances of escaping lung disease may be 95 percent; dementia, 90 percent; cancer, 80 percent; and heart disease, 75 percent. These figures are merely for illustration, but accurate estimates may be made for a wide range of dire possibilities. While the chances of avoiding any particular disease or accident may be encouraging, the probability of avoiding them all is not. If we multiply all the above probabilities (assuming these calamities are largely independent), the product grows disturbingly small quite quickly: already our chance of not suffering any of the few misfortunes listed above is less than 50 percent. It&apos;s a little anxiety-provoking, how this innocuous multiplication principle can make our mortality more vivid.
 
 

 2 Probability and Coincidence  
 
&quot;You&apos;re a Capricorn, too. That&apos;s so exciting.&quot;
 

 SOME BIRTHDAY VS. A PARTICULAR BIRTHDAY  
Sigmund Freud once remarked that there was no such thing as a coincidence. Carl Jung talked about the mysteries of synchronicity. People in general prattle ceaselessly about ironies here and ironies there. Whether we call them coincidences, synchronicities, or ironies, however, these occurrences are much more common than most people realize.
 

 CHANCE ENCOUNTERS  
Two strangers from opposite sides of the United States sit next to each other on a business trip to Milwaukee and discover that the wife of one of them was in the tennis camp run by an acquaintance of the other&apos;s. This sort of coincidence is surprisingly common. If we assume each of the approximately 200 million adults in the United States knows about 1,500 people, and that these 1,500 people are reasonably spread out around the country, then the probability is about one in a hundred that they will have an acquaintance in common, and more than ninety-nine in a hundred that they will be linked by a chain of two intermediates.
 

 A STOCK-MARKET SCAM  
Stock-market advisers are everywhere, and you can probably find one to say almost anything you might want to hear. They&apos;re usually assertive, sound quite authoritative, and speak a strange language of puts, calls, Ginnie Maes, and zero-coupons. In my humble experience, most don&apos;t really know what they&apos;re talking about, but presumably some do.
 

 EXPECTED VALUES: FROM BLOOD TESTING TO CHUCK-A-LUCK  
Coincidences or extreme values catch the eye, but average or &quot;expected&quot; values are generally more informative. The expected value of a quantity is simply the average of its values weighted according to their probabilities. For example, if /of the time a quantity equals 2, /of the time it equals 6, another /of the time it equals 15, and the remaining / of the time it equals 54, then its expected value equals 12. This is so since [12 = (2 x /) + (6 x /) + (15 x /) + (54 x /)].
 

 CHOOSING A SPOUSE  
There are two approaches to love-through the heart and through the head. Neither one seems to work very well alone, but together… they still don&apos;t work too well. Nevertheless, there&apos;s probably a better chance of success if both are used. Upon thinking of past loves, someone who approaches romance through the heart is likely to bemoan lost opportunities and conclude that he or she will never again love as deeply. Someone who takes a more hard-headed approach may be interested in the following result in probability.
 

 COINCIDENCE AND THE LAW  
In 1964 in Los Angeles a blond woman with a ponytail snatched a purse from another woman. The thief fled on foot but was later spotted entering a yellow car driven by a black man with a beard and a mustache. Police investigation eventually discovered a blond woman with a ponytail who regularly associated with a bearded and mustachioed black man who owned a yellow car. There wasn&apos;t any hard evidence linking the couple to the crime, or any witnesses able to identify either party. There was, however, agreement on the above facts.
 

 FAIR COINS AND LIFE&apos;S WINNERS AND LOSERS  
Imagine flipping a coin many times in succession and obtaining some sequence of heads and tails; say, HHTHTTHHTHTTTHTTHHHTHTTHHTHHTTHTHHTTHHTHTHHHHTHHHTT. If the coin is fair, there are a number of extremely odd facts about such sequences. For example, if one were to keep track of the proportion of the time that the number of heads exceeded the number of tails, one might be surprised that it is rarely close to half.
 

 THE HOT HAND AND THE CLUTCH HITTER  
The clumps, runs, and patterns that random sequences evince can to an extent be predicted. Sequences of heads and tails of a given length, say twenty flips, generally have a certain number of consecutive runs of heads. A sequence of twenty coin flips which resulted in ten heads followed by ten tails (HHHHHHHHHHTTTTTTTTTT) is said to have just one run of heads. A sequence of twenty coin flips which resulted in heads and tails alternating (HTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHT) is said to have ten runs of heads. Both these sequences are unlikely to be randomly generated. A sequence of twenty flips with six runs of heads (say, HHTHHTHTTHHHTTHHTTHT) is more likely to have been generated at random.
 
 

 3 Pseudoscience  
 
When asked why he doesn&apos;t believe in astrology, the logician Raymond Smullyan responds that he&apos;s a Gemini, and Geminis never believe in astrology.
 

 INNUMERACY, FREUD, AND PSEUDOSCIENCE  
Innumeracy and pseudoscience are often associated, in part because of the ease with which mathematical certainty can be invoked to bludgeon the innumerate into a dumb acquiescence. Pure mathematics does indeed deal with certainties, but its applications are only as good as the underlying empirical assumptions, simplifications, and estimations that go into them.
 

 PARAPSYCHOLOGY  
Interest in parapsychology is very old, yet the simple fact is that there have been no repeatable studies which have demonstrated its existence, Uri Geller and other charlatans notwithstanding. ESP (extrasensory perception) in particular has never been shown in any controlled experiment, and the few &quot;successful&quot; demonstrations have occurred in studies that were fatally flawed. Rather than rehash them, I&apos;d like to make some general observations.
 

 PREDICTIVE DREAMS  
Another presumed kind of extrasensory perception is the predictive dream. Everyone has an Aunt Matilda who had a vivid dream of a fiery car crash the night before Uncle Mortimer wrapped his Ford around a utility pole. I&apos;m my own Aunt Matilda: when I was a kid I once dreamed of hitting a grand-slam home run and two days later I hit a bases-loaded triple. (Even believers in precognitive experiences don&apos;t expect an exact correspondence.) When one has such a dream and the predicted event happens, it&apos;s hard not to believe in precognition. But, as the following derivation shows, such experiences are more rationally accounted for by coincidence.
 

 LI&apos;L OL&apos; ME AND THE STARS  
Astrology is a particularly widespread pseudo-science. The shelves of bookstores are stuffed with books on the subject, and almost every newspaper publishes a daily horoscope. A 1986 Gallup poll reports that 52 percent of American teenagers believe in it, and a distressing number of people in all walks of life seem to accept at least some of its ancient claims. I say &quot;distressing&quot; because if people believe astrologers and astrology, it&apos;s frightening to consider whom or what else they&apos;ll believe. It&apos;s especially so when, like President Reagan, they have immense power to act on these beliefs.
 

 EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE, YES; VISITORS IN UFO, NO  
In addition to astrology, innumerates are considerably more likely than others to believe in visitors from outer space. Whether or not there have been such visits is a question distinct from whether or not there is other conscious life in the universe. I&apos;ll develop some very approximate estimates to indicate why, though there probably are other life forms in our very galaxy, they most likely haven&apos;t paid us a courtesy call (despite the claims of books such as Budd Hopkins&apos;s The Intruders and Whitley Strieber&apos;s Communion). The estimates provide a good example of how numerical horse sense can check pseudoscientific ravings.
 

 FRAUDULENT MEDICAL TREATMENTS  
Medicine is a fertile area for pseudoscientific claims for a simple reason. Most diseases or conditions (a) improve by themselves; (b) are self-limiting; or (c) even if fatal, seldom follow a strictly downward spiral. In each case, intervention, no matter how worthless, can appear to be quite efficacious.
 

 CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY, BLACKJACK, AND DRUG TESTING  
One needn&apos;t be a believer in any of the standard pseudosciences to make faulty claims and invalid inferences. Many mundane mistakes in reasoning can be traced to a shaky grasp of the notion of conditional probability. Unless the events A and B are independent, the probability of A is different from the probability of A given that B has occurred. What does this mean?
 

 NUMEROLOGY  
Less worrisome than inaccurate tests is numerology, the last pseudoscience I want to discuss, and my favorite. It is a very old practice common to a number of ancient and medieval societies and involves the assignment of numerical values to letters and the consequent reading of significance into the numerical equality between various words and phrases.
 

 LOGIC AND PSEUDOSCIENCE  
Since numbers and logic are inextricably intertwined both theoretically and in the popular mind, it&apos;s perhaps not stretching matters too far to describe faulty logic as a kind of innumeracy. This assumption has in fact been implicit throughout much of this chapter. Let me end, then, with a couple of additional bad inferences which are further suggestive of the role that innumeracy-in the guise of fallacious logic-plays in pseudoscience.
 
 

 4 Whence Innumeracy?  
 
Recent personal experience at a suburban fast-food restaurant: My order of a hamburger, French fries, and a Coke comes to $2.01, and the cashier, who&apos;s worked there for months at least, fumbles with the 6 percent tax chart at the side of the cash register, searching for the line that says $2.01-$.12. Accommodating their innumerate help, the larger franchises now have cash registers which have pictures, on the keys, of the items ordered and automatically add on the appropriate tax.
 

 REMEMBRANCE OF INNUMERACIES PAST  
Why is innumeracy so widespread even among otherwise educated people? The reasons, to be a little simplistic, are poor education, psychological blocks, and romantic misconceptions about the nature of mathematics. My own case was the exception that proves the rule. The earliest memory I have of wanting to be a mathematician was at age ten, when I calculated that a certain relief pitcher for the then Milwaukee Braves had an earned run average (ERA) of 135. (For baseball fans: He allowed five runs to score and retired only one batter.) Impressed by this extraordinarily bad ERA, I diffidently informed my teacher, who told me to explain the fact to my class. Being quite shy, I did so with a quavering voice and a reddened face. When I finished, he announced that I was all wrong and that I should sit down. ERAs, he asserted authoritatively, could never be higher than 27.
 

 SECONDARY, COLLEGE, AND GRADUATE EDUCATION  
Once students reach high school, the problem of teacher competence becomes more critical. So many of the limited pool of mathematically talented people now work in the computer industry or in investment banking or related fields that I think only substantial salary bonuses for well-qualified secondary-school math teachers will keep the situation in our high schools from getting worse. Since at this level a long list of education courses is not as essential as having a mastery of the relevant mathematics, certifying retired engineers and other science professionals to teach mathematics might be of considerable help. As it is, the basic elements of mathematical culture are in many cases not being communicated to our students. Vieta in 1579 began to use algebraic variables-X, Y, Z, etc.-to symbolize unknown quantities. A simple idea this, yet many high school students today can&apos;t follow this four-hundred-year-old method of reasoning: Let X be the unknown quantity, find an equation which X satisfies, and then solve it in order to find the value of the unknown.
 

 INNUMERACY AND THE TENDENCY TO PERSONALIZE  
One important such factor is the impersonality of mathematics. Some people personalize events excessively, resisting an external perspective, and since numbers and an impersonal view of the world are intimately related, this resistance contributes to an almost willful innumeracy.
 

 THE UBIQUITY OF FILTERING AND COINCIDENCE  
Broadly understood, the study of filtering is nothing less than the study of psychology. Which impressions are filtered out and which are permitted to take hold largely determines our personality. More narrowly construed as the phenomenon whereby vivid and personalized events are remembered and their incidence therefore overestimated, the so-called Jeane Dixon effect often seems to lend support to bogus medical, diet, gambling, psychic, and pseudoscientific claims. Unless one is almost viscerally aware of this psychological tendency toward innumeracy, it is liable to bias our judgments.
 

 DECISIONS AND FRAMING QUESTIONS  
Judy is thirty-three, unmarried, and quite assertive. A magna cum laude graduate, she majored in political science in college and was deeply involved in campus social affairs, especially in antidiscrimination and anti-nuclear issues. Which statement is more probable?
 

 MATH ANXIETY  
A more common source of innumeracy than psychological illusions is what Sheila Tobias calls math anxiety. In Overcoming Math Anxiety she describes the block many people (especially women) have to any kind of mathematics, even arithmetic. The same people who can understand the subtlest emotional nuances in conversation, the most convoluted plots in literature, and the most intricate aspects of a legal case can&apos;t seem to grasp the most basic elements of a mathematical demonstration.
 

 ROMANTIC MISCONCEPTIONS  
Romantic misconceptions about the nature of mathematics lead to an intellectual environment hospitable to and even encouraging of poor mathematical education and psychological distaste for the subject and lie at the base of much innumeracy. Rousseau&apos;s disparagement of the English as &quot;a nation of shopkeepers&quot; persists as a belief that a concern with numbers and details numbs one to the big questions, to the grandeur of nature. Mathematics is often taken to be mechanical, the work of low-level technicians who will report to the rest of us anything we absolutely must know. Alternatively, mathematics is sometimes endowed with a coercive character which is somehow capable of determining our future. Attitudes such as these certainly predispose one to innumeracy. Let&apos;s examine some of them.
 

 DIGRESSION: A LOGARITHMIC SAFETY INDEX  
Several years ago, supermarkets began to use unit pricing (cents per pound, per fluid ounce, etc.) to give consumers a uniform scale with which to measure value. If the price of dog food and cake mix can be rationalized, why can&apos;t some sort of rough &quot;safety index&quot; be devised which allows us to gauge how safe various activities, procedures, and illnesses are? What I&apos;m suggesting is a kind of Richter scale which the media could use as a shorthand for indicating degrees of risk.
 
 

 5 Statistics, Trade-Offs, and Society  
 
There was once a state legislator in Wisconsin who objected to the introduction of daylight saving time despite all the good arguments for it. He maintained sagely that there is always a trade-off involved in the adoption of any policy, and that if daylight saving time were instituted, curtains and other fabrics would fade more quickly.
 

 PRIORITIES-INDIVIDUAL VS. SOCIETAL  
This chapter will concentrate on the harmful social effects of innumeracy, with particular emphasis on the conflict between society and the individual. Most of the examples consider some form of tradeoff or balancing of conflicting concerns, and will show how innumeracy contributes to the relative invisibility of these trade-offs, or sometimes, as in the case of the Wisconsin legislator above, to seeing them where they aren&apos;t.
 

 LAISSEZ-FAIRE: ADAM SMITH OR THOMAS HOBBES  
A different sort of conflict between the individual and society is revealed in a dilemma devised by the logician Robert Wolf that is related to the more famous prisoner&apos;s dilemma, to which we&apos;ll return shortly. Both demonstrate that acting in one&apos;s self-interest does not always best serve one&apos;s self-interest.
 

 BIRTHDAYS, DEATH DAYS, AND ESP  
Probability theory began with gambling problems in the seventeenth century, and something of the gaming flavor and appeal clings to it to this day. Statistics began in the same century with the compilation of mortuary tables, and something of its origins sticks to it as well. Descriptive statistics, the oldest part of the subject and the part with which people are most familiar, is at times (though not always) a dreary discipline, with its ceaseless droning about percentiles, averages, and standard deviations. The theoretically more interesting field of inferential statistics uses probability theory to make predictions, to estimate important characteristics of a population, and to test the validity of hypotheses.
 

 TYPE I AND TYPE II ERRORS: FROM POLITICS TO PASCAL&apos;S WAGER  
One more example of a statistical test. Suppose I hypothesize that at least 15 percent of the cars in a certain region are Corvettes, and upon watching one thousand cars go by representative intersections in the region note only eighty Corvettes among them. Using probability theory, I calculate that, given my assumption, the likelihood of this result is well below 5 percent, a commonly used &quot;level of significance.&quot; Therefore I reject my hypothesis that 15 percent of the cars in the region are Corvettes.
 

 POLLING WITH CONFIDENCE  
Estimating characteristics of a population, such as the percentage who favor a certain candidate or a particular brand of dog food, is, like hypothesis testing, simple in principle. One selects a random sample (easier said than done) and then determines what percentage of the sample favors the candidate (say, 45 percent) or the brand of dog food (say, 28 percent), which percentages are then taken to be estimates of the opinion of the population as a whole.
 

 OBTAINING PERSONAL INFORMATION  
The name of the game in statistics is the inferring of information about a large population by examining characteristics of a small, randomly selected sample. The techniques involved-from the enumerative induction of Francis Bacon to the theories of hypothesis testing and experimental design of Karl Pearson and R. A. Fisher, the founding fathers of modern statistics-all depend on this (now) obvious insight. Several unusual ways of obtaining information follow.
 

 TWO THEORETICAL RESULTS  
A large part of the attraction of probability theory is the immediacy and intuitive appeal of its practical problems and of the simple principles which enable us to solve many of them. Still, the following two theoretical results are of such fundamental importance that I&apos;d be derelict were I not to mention them at all.
 

 CORRELATION AND CAUSATION  
Correlation and causation are two quite different words, and the innumerate are more prone to mistake them than most. Quite often, two quantities are correlated without either one being the cause of the other.
 

 BREAST CANCER, MUGGINGS, AND WAGES: SIMPLE STATISTICAL MISTAKES  
Hypothesis testing and estimates of confidence, regression analysis, and correlation-though all are liable to misinterpretation, the most common sorts of statistical solecisms involve nothing more complicated than fractions and percentages. This section contains a few typical illustrations.
 

 ODDS AND ADDENDA  
In this section are several addenda to earlier material in this chapter.
