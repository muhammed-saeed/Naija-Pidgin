Food critics call Lo-Lo&apos;s Chicken and Waffles the best soul food restaurant 
 in the Valley. And Larry &quot;Lo-Lo&quot; White&apos;s fried chicken and golden brown waffles 
 back up those claims. The amiable family restaurants have been celebrated 
 in publications from the Arizona Republic to the Phoenix Magazine.

Every Lolo&apos;s restaurant serves chicken and waffles all day, but Lo-Lo&apos;s also 
 offers Southern favorites such as catfish, chicken gizzards, collard greens, 
 grits, and the cheesiest macaroni in town.
