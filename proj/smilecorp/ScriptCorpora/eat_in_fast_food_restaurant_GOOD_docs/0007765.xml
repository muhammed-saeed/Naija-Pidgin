a Roman fast food restaurant in northern Europe 
Many people in bigger towns in ancient Rome lived in just one room and didn&apos;t have kitchens in their apartments . They ate most of their meals in fast food restaurants like this one in the picture. You can see that one guy is sitting at a booth, while others are standing. There are a lot of clay cups hanging from the ceiling.

In these restaurants - tabernaria or thermopolia - people often ate pizza, just as you do in fast food restaurants. They ate a kind of white pizza with just cheese and onions on it, and maybe ham or bacon, because the Romans didn&apos;t have tomatoes yet.

With your pizza, you could also get wine or beer . There wasn&apos;t any drinking age in ancient Rome, but still kids usually drank wine mixed with water so they wouldn&apos;t get drunk. People also ordered soup, and porridge, and small plates of pickles, ham, pickled beets and onions and hard-boiled eggs and toast with fish sauce on it - salty things that would make you thirsty so you would order more wine, so the restaurant could make more money .

 Archaeology 
 of the Roman Economy , by Kevin Greene (1991). An expert, but a good 
 writer. Greene, like many archaeologists, comes down on the side of 
 a market economy.

 The 
 Roman Empire: Economy, Society and Culture , by Peter Garnsey and 
 Richard Saller (1987). Two experts, but their writing is easy enough 
 for high schoolers. By Finley&apos;s students, and basically on Finley&apos;s 
 side.

 The 
 Ancient Economy , by Moses Finley (1973, updated edition 1999). The 
 book that first started this argument. Basically on the side of&quot;consumer 
 cities&quot;and people farming their own food. The writing is, again, 
 clear and simple.
