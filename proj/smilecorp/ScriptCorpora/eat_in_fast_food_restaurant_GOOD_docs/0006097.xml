“My Pleasure”: The Chick-fil-A Customer Service Story
 Submitted by KDelGrande on August 18, 2011–2:02 pm View Comments Tweet Share 
 “It’s my pleasure!” Not a phrase that you often hear at a quick service restaurant, but one that every guest at Chick-fil-A has come to expect and appreciate.

“I have been the President and Chief Operating Officer at Chick-fil-A since 2001, but my real job is customer service,” said Dan T. Cathy. “Regardless of titles and specific job responsibilities, I think all of us at Chick-fil-A are in customer service.”

With 43 consecutive years of positive sales growth, Chick-fil-A has certainly set themselves apart from the rest of the competition. But it’s that philosophy, that strong focus on serving the customer that has helped Chick-fil-A to build such a loyal following and continue to expand across the country.

Several years ago, the chicken restaurant chain introduced “Second Mile Service” to their employees. The thought is that if you’re going to go one mile with someone, you may as well go two. While the idea of going the second mile comes from the Bible, it’s a philosophy that could be adopted and used by anyone in the service industry.

“Outstanding customer service is the cornerstone of our success,” said Pennsylvania-based multi-unit Chick-fil-A owner Jay Walsh. “Our main goal is to create Chick-fil-A ‘Raving Fans’ by creating remarkable experiences through the execution of operational excellence all day, every day and delivering ‘2 nd Mile Service’ by going above and beyond our customers’ expectations.

 “We make every effort to treat each Chick-fil-A guest with genuine honor, dignity and respect as well as attempting to anticipate their needs and, in turn, making connections which create fond, lasting memories (such as Daddy-Daughter Date Night or Mother-Son Date Knight), especially through our food, our people and of course our Cows!”

And the excellent service doesn’t just end with a “my pleasure.” The chain has added service touches that many would never expect from a fast food restaurant. From staff walking around the dining room asking to refill your drink to the end of the toilet paper roll folded in a hotel-style triangle, the company often performs like a much fancier establishment.

“We all need to be lifted up and made to feel special,” continued Cathy. “That’s why service is so important at Chick-fil-A. From helping mothers with children to their tables at our restaurants, to a very simple, but meaningful ‘my pleasure’ from our employees; you never know how you might be able to encourage and bring happiness to others by serving them well.”

And it’s that extra touch – that “pleasure” at Chick-fil-A that continues to make it our pleasure to continue eating there.

Although the phrase“my pleasure”is nice, it gets annoying.  Granted, I say“thank you”a lot.  I place my order at the drive thru w/a thank you ..“my pleasure”, I receive my change after paying and say thank you ..“my pleasure”, I receive my order w/a thanks ..“my pleasure”, I ask for extra whatever and say thanks ..“my pleasure”, etc. etc. .. it does tend to get annoying.  HOWEVER, before anyone blasts me for saying that .. it IS so much nicer than“yeah”,“yup”or“uh huh”!

Chick-fil-A is an enjoyable place to eat and since I am a person that enjoy experiencing good manners I like the slogan,“my pleasure”and it certainly is not annoying as felt by some people.  Our society has become so negative and immoral until it’s actually a joy to still be able to go into a restaurant and see that people are nice.  It makes it a pleasure to eat and enjoy your meal.  Keep it up!!!

Chick Fil A was my first job. It pains me to see these kids given a script. Hire friendly people and tell them to be friendly. Don’t turn them into robots.
