And the winner is...Guess we&apos;ll find out Saturday. Health Link was in tonight and took everyone&apos;s body stats. From our conversation&apos;s everyone did really well and we should be proud. Eleven weeks of sweat, and some tears has paid off.
We ended the last nutrition night with a little party. Everybody brought in their favorite dishes for everyone to sample. We had everything from snacks, to complete dish&apos;s, to dessert. It was great.
Saturday is the big reveal. We can&apos;t wait.

This is the second to last blog for the 2011 Fit4Life competition. It has been rough on the family schedule, but it was well worth it. Besides the sacrifices Henry and I made, the kids had equal sacrifices to allow us to compete. Not to mention all the times my mother had to come over and watch the kids when they were sick so we didn&apos;t miss training. If I were asked if I would do it again, I would say absolutely. This was by far the opportunity of a lifetime.

Tonight was our weigh in. I just hope we lost enough to make us a top competitor. After our weigh in we tried some yummy food each family made. It is sad to know we are at the end. We will miss our team and our trainer.

It&apos;s over...I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s over. I am still in shock. I wish I had done more, and was a little disappointed that the scale at the Arena Club weighed me in at 2 lbs more than at home LOL! Oh well. I pushed myself to my limit. I have to celebrate the victories I&apos;ve had, even if we&apos;re not the&quot;winner&quot;I feel like we&apos;ve come so far. Everyone is healthier, more active and we had fun. It was such a good experience to do this along side of my daughter. She never gave up, even though she occasionally gave me some attitude (typical 11 year old), she was always encouraging (okay, most of the time LOL)! Even Zachary asked if we were going to&quot;his gym&quot;tonight.
Now I have to go shopping for an outfit to wear on Saturday. Most of my clothes don&apos;t fit anyway, so it should be interesting! I went through the basement looking for smaller clothes the other night that I had packed away and realized I had gotten rid of all my&quot;skinny&quot;clothes. Megan asked for a belt this morning on pants she couldn&apos;t button 12 weeks ago.
I&apos;m going to miss so much Nicole, Alicia and my teammates...I don&apos;t even want to think about it!

Tonight was our last night of Fit for life. It was a sad to think that this program is over. Everyone brought in their favorite foods while we had our weights documented, blood pressure and fat percentages taken. I know that Steve and I are very happy with our results. Although I have to lose much more weight I feel like right now I have the momentum to continue. We both feel great and are eating healthier then ever before. All the staff was wonderful and very supportive. We felt like everyone really cared about our success. We met great people and began to feel like a family. We will miss everyone. Thanks to the Arena Club for putting on the great event it was exactly what Steve and I needed to get started.

Tonight we were actually abe to get to the gym a bit early. This allowed us to get some time on the arc trainer before measurements. We were happy to see that we lost inches again. I know we are nervous about tomorrow&apos;s offiical measurements and weight. I hope we lsot big numbers! We were with the other team again on the field tonight. We played Kickball! I cant remember the last time I did that.. maybe elementary school? It was definately a blast, as we all got to be kids again. Bitersweet though, as we know this was the last night we would all be together doing our workouts... Tomorrow is the end of the competition.

Wow! We did it! It was nice to see KAthy Wise out there with the teams during the challenge. She is a good cheer-leader. This challenge really did a number on our bodies, moreso than the others. I could barely get off the mat at the end of the plank. JAckie really pushed herself during the sit-ups, which really shocked me but I was proud of her. We may not have been the superstars of the event but compared to ourselves 12 weeks ago, we kicked butt!

We did cardio work today. We are getting more into the habit of doing simple workouts at home, wether it be videos or just routines we learned from Theron. This is nice as we can slip them into our routine more easily than the production of a trip to the gym. The gym provides a more comprehensive workout but when we just cant make it, we can do our little things. We did not want to push it too hard today as we are very nervous about tomorrow&apos;s challenge and we dont want to be too sore to compete.

Jackie ran a mile in our neighborhood today. We have lived in our area for around 2 years now and that is something that neither of us has ever done. The changes in what we can do and are interested in doing now are just incredible.

Next to last Nutrition class. Wow, the clock is really ticking down now. We talked about body types and how different people process nutrition differently. I also learned tonight that, unless you are Michael Phelps, you dont need to&quot;carbo-load&quot;the night before a physical event. No more pasta dinners before the big game... Alicia also talked abot making sure we all ahd set ourselves some short-term goals. We need something to work towards so that we can stay focused and on top of our game. This really will be important for us, especially if we do not win and must make our own way without any guidance. We have learned a lot in our time here but that does not mean we can let it slip away.

Tonight both teams came together on the field to run through stations in a boot-camp like rotation. It was definately interesting to be together as such a large group with both trainers. It was also a bit of a down-note, with so many people being sick or not able to participate. I know I am also feeling nervous about what is coming up on Monday with that last fitness challenge. Sort of like a comprehensive test of all we have achieved so far. Looking back at where we started and where we are now... it will be hard not having this anymore. The program, the instruction from Theron, the team-spirit. This program has really helped our family and it will be sad to have it end.

Last workout with Nicole and measurement nights. I didn&apos;t do as well as I had hoped on the second half. I know I gained some muscle, but I&apos;d like to see more inches gone. Everyone on my team and the red team did a great job. We were all understandably nervous. I hope as many as they can will continue their memberships. We played a friendly game of kick ball last night. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve played kickball in probably 30 years! It was fun, but I&apos;m sure it was a hoot to watch all us run after that soccer ball! I will miss the comrade very much.
Tomorrow is our final weigh in. I think I&apos;ll definitely sleep good tomorrow night.

Measurements were done today. I&apos;m not really sure what is considered a great loss so we will just be happy to have lost inches. It was sad knowing we don&apos;t have anymore workouts with Nicole. We may all get together and sign up for a group workout with her in the future.

After the measurements were done we went on the field for some fun. We enjoyed a friendly game kickball. Even in a child&apos;s game the competition was on.

Now to get through tomorrow for our final weigh in.

Tonight’s class was fun but also sad. It was a last time with Theron and Nicole. Hopefully we can get Theron to continue training us after the first of the year. We definitely will be getting a membership over this weekend so that we can continue coming to the club. Hopefully I will be continue to see everyone there. This has been an exciting 12 weeks and life changing. Both Steve and I are feeling better and have more energy. We both have done things that we would never have dreamt of doing 12 weeks ago.

Well we got a peak at how much our hard work has paid off. Nicole took our measurements tonight., and what an eye opener. We are excited and proud of our family for the accomplishments we&apos;ve made. We finished the night with a game of kickball and what fun that was. We are very excited to see the rest of our results tomorrow night at the weigh-in. Lisa&apos;s planning to make Yum Yum spice muffins for the nutrition class tomorrow night because she has been craving pumpkin.

The countdown is in the single digits now. There are 4 days left until the reveal and we are trying to make the most of it. Henry and I went to the gym early and focused on cardio. We spent our time on the Precor machine to get the most bang for our buck. Afterwards we gathered the kids up from the daycare and let them go swimming. Tomorrow night is our measurements. I&apos;m hoping all the planks, wall squats, crunches and push ups shaved some inches off our bodies. Fingers are crossed and prayers have been prayed.

Can we really be talking about the last week of this challenge? Molly and I headed out to the gym early today since Mark is working very late tonight. The treadmill is where I headed for an hour and it felt good. I am soooo sad that it is coming to an end. I don&apos;t mean because of the free training or access to the gym but because we have really grown to love working out with Nicole and our team and will be lost to not meet with them. I can not begin to put into words how this program has saved my life. It has been an awesome experience and my family has grown so much with the exercising and nutrition that we truly are a changed family. Anna is a living example of a kid that hated to exercise and run. She would avoid it at all costs. Last year in school gym she had to hold the plank for ten seconds and could not do that. She now is able to hold it for three minutes or more and do an eight minute wall squat. Anna has informed Mark and I that she would like to sign up for cross country. Really, proud is all I can say. I have shared so much of this experience with my friends and family that I have everyone watching their salt intake and making time for excerise when there was no time before.

I had a Christmas Party at work today. They had a lot of food plus snacks. I decided that I wasn’t sure if I could behave myself so I brought my own lunch and just sat there enjoying the company of my fellow employees. I made sure I brought things with me that I find sweet to keep my sweet tooth in check like clementines. My fellow employees have been cheering me on and made sure there was a salad with no dressing which I did eat a little. I also sat with my back to the food table so that I didn’t need to see all of the food. I walked away without touching anything but the salad and what I brought with me. I also received a call from our Human Resource department who runs the company’s health magazine. That is where I saw the information regarding this program. They would like to interview me on my success of this program for their newsletter due out in January. The feel that I could be motivation for others to get up and move. I told them that I would be willing to do it, if they think it will help others to get healthy.

The end is in sight. I slept great last night just knowing that the challenge was over. I&apos;m nervous about tomorrow night&apos;s measurements but I know I&apos;ve done all I can do. I think I&apos;m more worried about what the future will hold. Let&apos;s face it...losing weight is one thing, keeping it off is another. I&apos;ve lost weight in the past, always to gain it right back, and of course it comes back even faster than before. After a few moments of celebration it will be critical for me to continue on. This means going to the gym even when I don&apos;t want to. I am not sure how I&apos;m going to do without a goal in sight...without Nicole and my team mates, and even my kids by my side in the gym. What&apos;s going to keep me going? What&apos;s going to keep me from eating out? I think time will tell. I know I don&apos;t want to go back to how I was. I like being thinner and in better shape. I don&apos;t want to lose that. I&apos;m just not sure if I can keep life from getting in the way...I&apos;m being honest....the teamwork really motivated me, and I&apos;m not sure how I&apos;m going to do. It&apos;s kind of scary in a way. I guess I need to find a workout buddy so we can encourage each other, get each other there when we don&apos;t want to be. The journey is far from over. It&apos;s just begun.

Between our cub scout events, we were able to make it back to the gym on Sunday. Jake was my exercise partner since George had his record overtime at work since working there for 18 years and wasn&apos;t able to go. Jake tried to help me do sit ups by holding my feet. They are not my favorite at all, but I could not get myself off the ground when I started this back in September. Jake is very flexible and can do anything. TO BE LITTLE AGAIN

Well the party&apos;s over, this was are last challenge on the field and up in the exercise room with wall sits, rowing, planks, sit ups and push ups. George could not participate this evening because he hurt his back and was in a lot of pain. He still put on a brave face and showed up for support after working late again. I felt I was not on my game with suffering with a cold all weekend and taking cold medicine. But, I still did better than if I never started this program. In the beginning I did not know what a plank was let alone be able to do it for over a minute. Nicole was a great trainer even though she scared we on some occasions not knowing what she had in store. She is pretty cool for taking all this on and helping everyone of us succeed to the best of our ability. Even though I have a long way to go I&apos;m glad I made a difference in my weight and exercise endurance. I know I have a lot more in me to keep going . This is the beginning of the rest of our healthy lives with eating and exercise thanks to the Arena Club.

p,s. Just want to say thanks to Jake my 10 year old for never giving us a hard time about not wanting to go to the gym. He had a lot of fun and thanks to Jasone for making exercise fun with the kids. Jake is a great kid. Love, Mom

Thursday was back to the gym for our nutrition class. We got a treat when Mary brought a chicken pasta dish for all to try. Jake said to make it so when we left the meeting we went right to the store to get the ingredients and enjoyed it Friday. Hoping during the holiday break to make some tasty healthy receipes in my new cookbook. The yum yum muffins are still everyones favorite and George will take them to his holiday party at work.

We finished the last Monday of the Fit 4 Life program with the third and final challenge. All of our sweat and tears over the past eleven weeks paid off. Anna stepped up and competed in the challenge. She did an EIGHT MINUTE wall sit taking first place! She ended up placing 3rd overall in the challenge. Even though I didn&apos;t place well with the wall sit or the plank I beat my previous times. Which is a victory for me. I placed first in the push-ups and rowing and second in the sit-ups and ended up placing second overall. I am so proud of my family and how we&apos;ve grown into a Fit 4 Life family. We can&apos;t wait til Wednesday to find out just how much our hard work has paid off when they do the final weigh-in and measurements.

TGIF takes on a whole new meaning... Thank God it&apos;s finished. The third and final challenge is over. Our team did awesome. Anna really showed she is a force to be reckoned with when she pulled out an 8 minute wall squat. Mary snuck in there with her mega sit ups (somewhere around 58 give or take a few). Mark was the push up king and the captain of his row boat. Henry was the plank master. It&apos;s amazing to see how far we have come. Now for measurements...

This challenge really proved how much we all improved over these 12 weeks. I know that Steve and I didn’t come in first place but it felt really good to accomplish what we did. No matter the outcome, we will be joining the club because we are in a rhythm with the exercising and it is really make us feel pretty good. Twelve weeks ago I would never have guessed that we are actually liking the workouts and the people we met are really super nice.

Tonight was our last challenge. I came in 4th, and I have to say I&apos;m proud of myself. Of course I wish I could have done better, but 4th is pretty good. I was crazy nervous beforehand, and will be even more nervous Wednesday night for our final weigh-in and measurements. It&apos;s been a great experience, and it makes me choke up to think that it&apos;s almost over. Twelve weeks sounded like a lifetime 3 months ago. So much has changed for us, and I&apos;m so proud of my whole bunch! They&apos;ve really pulled together for the challenge! I hope we can continue to grow stronger as a family and conquer any challenge that comes our way!

I had a different kind of workout today, but I think Nicole would approve. My brother in-law and Lisa&apos;s dad came over today and we cut and split about 3 cords of wood.. Most of my muscles from my calves to my shoulders are pretty sore. Since we didn&apos;t get to the gym Lisa walked the tread mill at home.

Friday night. I hit the gym right after work, which is what I plan on doing once the competition is over. It was nice to be out before 6pm. I was able to do 45 minutes on the Precor machine...the one that just about killed me after 5 minutes on that very first night. I get bored easily, so I find that keeping my mind occupied with a show or music definitely helps! After the competition I am going to really try to work on core strength and flexibility more than strength training. It&apos;s not that I do not like strength training, but I feel like my core is very weak and my flexibility (although improved) is still lousy. 12 weeks just isn&apos;t enough time to be perfect!
This weekend should be interesting. I have a Christmas party tomorrow night. Of course I&apos;m bringing a veggie tray and other goodies I can eat. I just have to be VERY CAREFUL!

It is exactly one week until the big reveal and the wait is almost over. Where did the last 11 weeks go?

Today we started our morning with a&quot;brisk run&quot;around the HCC campus. Actually it was quite cold. A mere 36°. We took part in The Arena Club&apos;s Santa&apos;s Sleigh 5k. Although our times were better than the 5k on the treadmill for our fitness challenge #2, we were beat by an elf and the gingerbread man.

Tomorrow we will practice for our third challenge.

Mark has been working a lot of overtime lately that when he finally gets home we are making time to work out together at home. I have been spending a great deal of time on the treadmil and he of course loves his free weights. Emily and Molly go fire up the Wii and do yoga or sports. I just love that this program has gotten my whole family fired up to workout together. Before it was only Mark and I that wanted to go do something and the girls were no where to be found. Now we are spending time together exercising on a Friday night. Love this!

Tonight was our next to last nutrition class and Alicia said that we are almost ready to fly on our own. Oddly enough, I think we are ready to continue on our own with everything we have learned. We have made new staple foods and are loving the way clean eating has made us feel. We were able to go in early to get in some cardio for me and weight training for Mark. Even Anna disappears on her own and goes right to work with her training. I think everyone is gearing up for the next challenge and preparing for the final step. I gotta say though, I still think the 5K was the hardest challenge....this of course is coming from someone that is not a fan of running. Good luck to all the Family Fit 4 Lifers...we really have come far.

This was the second to the last nutritional meeting. We&apos;ve learned so much from Alicia. She has prepared us for the next phase of our lives. I&apos;m finally taking the time to research and try new recipes. We&apos;ve opened our eyes to a whole new world of food. I&apos;m looking forward to continuing to try new foods and recipes. Tonight we got a special meal from Mary. It&apos;s funny how we&apos;ve changed our viewpoints and we get so excited making a great tasting meal that is healthy. We&apos;re like little kids with new toys. It is great to see such enthusiasm among the group.

Thursday night: A busy day...didn&apos;t quite get in the workout I wanted to get in, but I got some in. We also had nutrition class where we discussed how training and nutrition work together. You really do have to eat, not only to lose weight, but also to train. Food is not the enemy...it&apos;s fuel for your body. If you don&apos;t put the right kind of fuel in your car, it&apos;s not going to run right. I think before this competition I was putting diesel in an unleaded car. Of course I didn&apos;t run right! Nothing ran right. Now I can tell how important it is that I continue eating clean. There will be some opportunity to splurge here and there, but I have a feeling I&apos;m going to be paying dearly for it!
6 more blogs..wow...I&apos;m glad that I&apos;ve had the opportunity to share this journey. It&apos;s been so incredible and life changing. I hope that others can find strength in this real-life account...so much more real than a reality show! Real life is sticky, messy, and sometimes not the most pleasant experience. It&apos;s this journey that has helped give me a new perspective on that, and some of the tools to make this better for my entire family.

Tonight in nutrition class, Alicia gave us information regarding how to eat before a competition. She also told us that we should plan something about 90 days in the future to keep us motivated. Steve and I have already decided that we are going to get a membership to continue the exercising and continue the logging into myfooddiary. We both need to record our food to monitor what we eat to continue in the correct manner. With the exercising we already talked to Theron to ask him what we would have to do after this is over so that we can have him continue training me. We both need our buts kicked at least once a week to keep us motivated. I think this would be great for us because he changes up the workout every time we meet him and that will keep us form getting bored. I feel we both learned a lot from these classes and I really don’t want to stop the momentum that we have going for us.

Wednesday was a challenge on the field with the red team. There were stations to go thru starting with TRX straps , and then on to flipping a tire the size of Mount Rushmore, but luckily I did have help with my partner. We had to take a 18 or 20 pound ball and hold it over your head and slam it down to the ground so it would bounce. Nicole wanted the floor to shake. There were ropes to maneuver and push ups , my worst thing to do. The best thing is we can exercise and still have a life. George and I are not going to the gym 5-7 days a week. You can&apos;t hold up that schedule all the time. We do what we can, if there is a holiday trip for me once in a lifetime because we don&apos;t go anywhere I&apos;m going to take it. But, I got my workout there walking the streets of New York and dodging cars and cabs. George is working crazy hours and overtime, is he going to turn down the money and go to the gym???? even though he can&apos;t not show up for work and if he has to stay all night working that&apos;s what happens. This has been a challenge for a family who hardly ever exercised. \We have learned so much and now we have to learn to fit exercise in when we don&apos;t have Nicole are cheerleader there to challenge us and get us moving. scary to think about

The final Wednesday field training session was awesome. The red team and the black team trained together with Nicole and Theron. We broke into teams of 2 and went through a 7 station workout. We worked with the TRX straps, tire flipping, medicine balls, whipping ropes, pushing the sled, strength running, and push ups.
Afterward Nicole and Theron filled us in on the final challenge. And of course we ended with the plank.
After we got home Lisa made pita pizzas with turkey meatballs for dinner.

Tonight was a special night because we got to work out with the Red team. I&apos;m not sure if this is the type of workout they typically do on the field or if it was a taste of what we&apos;ve endured with Mamma Nicole cracking the whip. We finally got the information for our next challenge so it&apos;s time to practice as much as we can before Monday.

Wednesday Night...It&apos;s been a busy day. I&apos;m trying to go&quot;out with a bang&quot;and am really trying to do different things to get my body to respond for this last week. Sure wish those numbers would drop, even just a little bit. I have to brag on Ben a little bit. He&apos;s my 13 year old who has ALWAYS struggled with weight and growth. At the beginning of the competition he was barely 80 pounds. In 12 weeks he has GAINED 10 pounds and grown over 2 inches! I tell you, knocking out all that junk food and replacing it with clean, healthy foods has totally made a difference. I know most people want to lose weight, but for him this has been a HUGE change, and one that I think he should be VERY proud of. This competition was not all about weight loss, which I feel sometimes it is more focused on athletic ability and weight loss. It was about becoming healthy through fun, fitness, food and the future...the kids. Ben&apos;s nailed it for sure! He&apos;s done everything from doing his own routine, to working out with the adults, to hanging out with the younger kids. Tonight he even pulled Zachary duty as he wasn&apos;t feeling well. He&apos;s been flexible and willing to at least try (even though he has complained through most of everything, but hey, he is 13). I am proud of all my kids...Megan for sticking through this with me, Matthew, for not driving Jason to a nervous breakdown, and even Zachary for encouraging me by yelling YEAH GYM! Every time we pull in!

Monday , we did not make it to the gym. Had a trip planned to New York to see the ROCKETTS with my Mom and Sister, a trip we have been talking about for 10 years, talk about procrastinating. Of course , George got called to work Monday evening but it is nice to have the extra money this time of year. Jayne

Thursday we went over body types and how different body types loose weight. George found out his body type and it was right on. Everybody transforms there body differently. Jake is a little George so when he grows up , we know what he will look like! The hardest part for me is still cooking , but we have come along way from the beginning.

 Today both teams were down on the field to prepare us all for the challenge on Monday. It was a really good workout and a variety with all the different stations. Both Theron and Nicole cheered everyone on and offered tips to improve the form for all of the different exercises. It is really upsetting that next week is our last week of this program. It was the best thing Steve and I have ever done. We met good people who are in the same situation as we are and although it is a competition everyone cheers each other on. I know that Steve and I worked harder then we would have without some assistance from this program. I do know that Steve and I are both going to continue to work out and get Theron to at least work us out one day a week because I don’t want to lose the momentum that we have at the moment. 

 

Nicole: Trainer&apos;s Take
 posted: 12.08.2011 

 

Wow what an amazing trip this has been. I&apos;ve seen so much out of this crew and I couldn&apos;t be more happy with the effort, commitment and great attitudes during this entire program. The last challenge is Monday with measurements on Wednesday and I am anxious to get them to the end here. The end is actually another beginning and I am confident I have taught my families how I make the right choices and make wellness a staple I their lives for good.

Thank you all for the experience and teaching me to have constant faith in my clients... when the pressure is on you guys always delivered. I love my basket of Ravens goodies! You all have made a footprint in my life and I will always be available to you for help!

We&apos;ve really had a tough go at this for the past 11 weeks with battling illnesses in the family, being exposed to new germs. Unfortunately, the medication the girls are on lowers their immune system so we split up our time in the gym again. We are very lucky to have my mom come over when we need her on required training nights. Henry went right after work and I went in the early evening. Right now we are focusing on winning the next challenge.

I went grocery shopping today and had the realization this this was probably one of the last trips I would make while still in this competition. Of course we&apos;re in the final days, so at this time I&apos;m watching EVERYTHING I eat very carefully. After this there will be some changes, but I doubt certain things will ever make their way back in my cupboard. Here are a few of the things:
Macaroni and&quot;cheese&quot;...not real cheese anyway, yellow powder and salt with white enriched (take out everything good and then add back stuff) pasta.
Bologna/hot dogs/high salt or nitrate meats
Poptarts
Sugary cereals such as Fruit Loops, Frosted Flakes, Cocoa Puffs, etc.
&quot;kids&quot;yogurt
Canned convenience foods such as Spaghettios or Cream of Mushroom Soup, Chicken Noodle Soup, etc.
Canned vegetables (except pumpkin and tomatoes)
Ramen Noodles
French Toast Sticks
Fish sticks/chicken shaped nugget patties (ew)
Boxed dinners

(the list could go on)

Some of our staple items now are:
low-sodium butternut squash soup (used in many many ways)
cheese sticks, raisins and apples for snacks for the kids
Double Fiber wheat bread
Almond Butter
Kashi regular and blueberry waffles
Flatout flat breads
Brown Rice
black beans
Salsa
wild-caught fish (still need to EAT more of this)
frozen broccoli
pumpkin...lots of pumpkin!
and of course lots and lots of veggies

Our eating has definitely made a 180 degree change. While we will occasionally enjoy some pizza or ice cream, these will be treats. It used to be the kids would complain about having to eat out because we did it SO OFTEN! When we were growing up eating out was a TREAT...something that was very special. I think I&apos;ve given that back to my kids, which is a great accomplishment.

Monday 12/5
Tonight was another rough night. In addition to hard work on the rowing machine, we were using hand weights as our&quot;rest.&quot;After that, we moved on to bigger and better weights with the machines and plate loaded weights. The men got pushed hard with increasing weight loads. The ladies were workin it on the machines in the other area. Unfortunately, I was not feeling up to par and lost my energy at the end of our workout. When we were doing our core to finish up, Theron let us know what was coming next week for our last challenge. It will definately be quite a big finish. As anxious as we may be about the end of the proram, it is really hard to believe it is almost over. I have seen all the people who have posted abotu wanting this to continue and I think that speaks to the sense of community which has spawned between the participants. There is still a good level of rivalry but at the same time, I dont think I would have made it as far as I have, if it had not been for the people around me.

Jackie did some serious work with weights tonight. She made sure to mix it up with some cardio as we have been told. I got to get my exercise from chasing the 2 year old around. I am not sure which of us had the harder time. Sometimes I wonder how many reps of picking her up counts as a workout...

Nutrition. It made me chuckle when we started with the SAD diet (Standard American Diet). It really is sad. I am looking forward to talking about nutrition timing next week too. Again, the class offered a chance for families to share stories and recipies, as much as we learned from Alicia. There was also good talk tonight about&quot;cheating&quot;on your diet and how not to fall off track and get back on.

Tonight we hit the mats. It was a tough core workout and put all our legs to the test as well. I dont think I ahve heard Jackie complain so much about her legs in a long time. It was a nice change of pace though. Dominic had found a secret reserve on energy tongiht and could probably have doen all our workouts for us. After that we did our mix of cardio on the machines upstairs. I am guessing JAckie will be hurting in her legs tomorrow. But its a good hurt.

It&apos;s nice to find out our group is being trained by&quot;the trainer of the year&quot;. We always knew she is Da Bomb Diggity. We worked arms and legs splitting up into groups of two. I love the fact that everyone gets along so well. It was nice to see Lisa made it out to join us. We will continue to pray for her. I hope our group can remain close. Many friendships were made from this competition. It is now time to keep working to build endurance for our next challenge.

This is a hard night for the Lopus family. We arrived home from the gym to find out that our beloved cat had been hit by a car and did not survive. This has been a very difficult year for the Lopus family, one that we are looking forward to seeing come to an end. In a way the Fit 4 Life competition signifies a new beginning for us, and hopefully next year will be happier and healthier for us all.

Today Theron did a variety of workouts to help prepare us for our next challenge. I had him review my push up because I was not doing it correctly but could not figure out why I couldn’t lift myself. Basically I had my hands too far out and was putting too much pressure on my shoulders. We had worked on several weight machines as well as the rowing machine. For every minute of rowing we then took a break and did fifteen reps of bicep curls and then another minute of rowing and repeated this until we did it for 10 minutes. I cannot believe we are getting closer to the end of this process.

The girls didn&apos;t have preschool today so we headed to the gym early. I was all set to take Body Jam, but I was pleasantly surprised to see Candace teaching Zumba Jam instead. It was a great heart pumping workout. I went upstairs afterwards and did some cardio and triceps. I&apos;ve been trying to really focus on getting rid of the jiggle under my arm. Henry took his workout clothes with him in the morning and hit the gym after work. He did 40 minutes on the Precor machine and some upper body work. This allowed the evening to be freed up to coach Connor&apos;s basketball team. I heard from my son that daddy ran them hard. I guess he is taking after Nicole.

I can&apos;t believe this is my 48th blog! That&apos;s crazy! In some ways it feels like this has been forever. In other ways it feels like we started this just yesterday. It&apos;s been a long haul. Everyone&apos;s starting to talk about what&apos;s next...what&apos;s after this. In a perfect world we would all have Arena Club memberships and we could continue our journey side by side. The reality is that some of us will not be able to continue...whether for financial reasons, time restraints, or practicality. For our family, I joined the Arena Club this past summer with my 2 year old. I didn&apos;t sign the other kids up at the time because I didn&apos;t think they would be motivated to use the gym. Of course they&apos;ve proven me wrong! They&apos;ve all enjoyed going and have gotten a lot out of the activities. I have to come to a tough decision as to what their future might be in regard to the gym and if we can work it out for them. There&apos;s still a lot up in the air. I think what I&apos;m going to miss most is just seeing my other team members and knowing we are all working toward the same goal.
Of course Nicole worked us like crazy on the field tonight. I am going to miss that as well of course. I can&apos;t imagine doing this on my own, but I have to trust that she&apos;s given me the tools that I need to continue on.

Today in Nutrition, we learned about how bad the American Diet is which we knew considering the shape we are in. The diseases of cancer, liver and kidney diseases increases based on the amount of carbohydrates we eat. We then talked about how all of our taste buds have changed from the first week of class. Alicia has been trying to get me to eat greek plain yogurt but just couldn’t get it past my mouth. This past week I finally got it and really like it. I added granola, walnuts and dried cranberries. I found this product within the Kashi cereal section and made by a company called UDI’s. This stuff is all natural with no preservatives. They had some other brands so Steve tried the other one. The other flavor that Steve chose was natural granola which contains walnuts, cashews, raisins, banana chips and pistachios. This is also really good. It is just sweet enough for me to enjoy it. We are both going to really miss these classes because we are really learning how to eat well.

Todzy’s workout was brutal. All the ab workouts were the toughest we had. We both wish we had the energy and stamina of Dominic who seemed to be able to do all of the exercises with no difficulty. When Theron was finished with the ab workout, he had us go up and either work on the Arc trainer or the rowing machine. All I know tomorrow I believe tomorrow both Steve and I will be sore in the abs, neck and back.

Jeric&apos;s 48th Blog; Week #10. Alicia had another great nutrition class tonight. It was interesting to learn what the short term and long term effects of eating poorly have on our bodies. It definitely will have an influence on the food choices for our family. We had chicken and salsa leftovers waiting for us when we got home (just as good as last night). We have another busy weekend ahead but we&apos;re planning to get into the gym on Friday when I get home from work

The training tempo is so intense. I also like the way the exercises hit the muscle groups in a different way. Lisa made the chicken n salsa in the crock-pot again. It&apos;s so nice coming home and having dinner already prepared.
  Looking forward to Alicia&apos;s nutrition class tomorrow. Lisa&apos;s mom is going to watch the girls so we can come in early and get in a good workout before class.

Monday night was an awesome workout. I felt it throughout my whole body. I was so happy that I didn&apos;t give up and do any&quot;girl pushups&quot;even though it felt like we did a hundred of them. I remember the first time we had to do inchworms. I could barely get 1/4 of the way through doing pushups and now I did them the whole way. Talk about feeling stronger. Henry is also noticing that the recovery is much easier. We feel like we get a great workout and not so sore afterwards. I have recently become acquainted with the stair climber and Henry has been rocking it on the Precor. He keeps pushing himself further and further each time. I am very proud of what we have accomplished so far. I hope our momentum sustains for a live time. And congrats to&quot;Mama&quot;for becoming an expecting mama now. I think this means she is going to be working us even harder now.

Tonight Theron had us changing up again, with a good mix of ramped up cardio and weights. He also threw in a taste of TRX to the workout to give us nice variety. One of the things that I am growing to love is how much more I can do now. Every member of our group, in fact, seems to be doing more each time and getting mroe accomplished. Greater range of motion, better control, more weight or more reps. It really makes you feel a sense of accomplishment at the end of each workout. Knowing that you did more than you did last time is a great feeling. I think Theron&apos;s team has really come a long way.

Jackie and I had to get back into the gym and make up for our imiganiry excess of the holidays (and to get out all that angry energy left over from Black Friday). We applied many of the things we have learned from Theron and pushed ourselves through a cardio and weight circuit. We worked ourselves for a good 90 minutes. It felt good to be able to get that in. Of course, Sarah had to go to the pool afterwards so we got to relax after all that work with a well-deserved dip. We were all hapy and rested when we returned home.

11/24/11 Thanksgiving!!
Thanksgiving was a welcome yet slightly uneasy day for our family. We decided to travel to my parents&apos; home for the holiday and we were not too sure what the food situation would be. Alicia had said we could take the day off from logging our food but we have become so accustomed to this way of eating that it is hard to picture being&quot;bad.&quot; We took side dishes and a special berry cobbler Jackie had created. All in all, I think we did great! It was a blast to spend time with family and they were wonderful when it came to eating our way. And thanksgiving didnt have to change all that much either. This makes me believe we can master Christmas too.

Theron had us running accross ladders on the field today. He said it was like dancing... yeah maybe if you were being forced to by a madman... no I am jsut joking. IT really was a great workout and got us all competitive. After that we did some serious core work. Theron keeps saying we will thank him at swimsuit season... we will see. It was frightening to discuss that next week is the last week before the final challenge. It really does not seem liek we have been doing this for long at all. I think I will be very sad when its all over.

This time there was a lot of discussion about what each family planned to do on the holiday and what we were all going to eat! This is a big eatin&apos; holiday and it was definately going to be a test for us all.People have been sharing lots of recipies and it is wonderful to have so many options at our disposal.

Tuesday: A pretty quiet day. I didn&apos;t get a huge workout at the gym so at home I made sure I practiced my planks and did 10 times up and down my stairs. I am definitely feeling sore from last night&apos;s workout with Nicole.
It&apos;s been coming into my head a lot lately about what about after all this is over...what is my game plan? I can&apos;t just go back to the way things were, but honesty do not have the energy or the time to continue with the intensity that I have been doing the last 9 weeks. I need to find a healthy in-between. I still have a ways to go to my goal, but I&apos;ve made a huge first step. My doctor today even told me that I looked great and didn&apos;t need to necessarily lose anymore, that I am at a healthy weight for my age and size. Wow..that was good to hear. That doesn&apos;t mean stop though. Even if I don&apos;t lose much more weight I definitely want to get stronger and more toned, which is probably where my focus will turn once this is over. Also, I want to continue to work on core strength and flexibility.

Monday night , last place I wanted to go on my Birthday would be to the gym. But that was the past, we always feel better after we finish but I did have to pull George there because he is working on the weekends and doing side work and getting up at 4:30 A.M. It was neat when I signed in with my club card and it played Happy Birthday . felt special for a few moments. Nicole always changes it up so we don&apos;t get bored. Lots of floor work, but I still have trouble bending my knee for a long period of time. We also got to go to the gym floor with a workout on machines and core work on the mats. Happy Birthday to me.

 George made it to the gym on Sunday, it was more crowded than normal early in the morning. Took a 3 mile hike on the trail at Conowingo, beautiful day. The weather was great to take a walk. This was a challenging week ,celebrating Thanksgiving(food) Birthdays(food).. We like to go out to eat for Birthday&apos;s . Tried to stay with chicken, wasn&apos;t sure about the fish at the restaurant with lemon ,butter sauce. Can&apos;t wait to see what Nicole has in store on Monday . I know she will be easy on us because it is my Birthday. ha ha

Made it to the gym on Saturday , very quiet in there. Worked out on the elliptical trainer and bike for an hour. Need to get back on track from Thanksgiving and do a little extra exercise.  We had a great Thanksgiving and did not over indulge but still ate more than we have been in the last few weeks. . Our old normal would have been one of everything at the dessert table , but this year we picked one and took a smaller piece. Since we celebrate 4 birthday&apos;s at Thanksgiving , we had Birthday cake so I had a small piece.

Today we did a little of everything from cardio to strength training. We are all getting pretty good at the various machines. Theron reminded us that our next challenge is next week and will be a variety of things. Steve and I will have to work on a couple of things prior to then like being able to do push ups. For some reason I am not as nervous about this one as I was about the 5K run. I probably will not be coming in first but I am prepared to give it my all. Alicia has been trying to get Steve and me to eat the greek plain yogurt. I just couldn’t eat it. No matter what I tried I just couldn’t get past the strange flavor. I tried mixing it with several things but still no luck. This weekend I finally found something that makes the plain yogurt taste good. It is called Udi’s cranberry and walnuts. It has minimal sugar and the dried cranberries make it sweet enough that I ate the entire carton of yogurt. Steve got the original Udi’s which also has very little sugar in it. I found this product cheaply on line with the Cyber Monday sales so I ordered quite a bit of both products since we found something we liked.

It was pretty crowded on the floor so Nicole took us down to the indoor field and tore us up for about a half an hour. We then went upstairs had hit a weight machine circuit. and ended with a 10 minute workout on the stationary bikes. After we got home I made a chicken fajita flatout that rocked!
  I&apos;m off tomorrow so Lisa, Molly, and I will hit the gym in the morning but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be able to do legs after tonight&apos;s workout.

New week...hard to believe we&apos;re so close to the end. I am not ready for it to end, even though tonight I was brought to muscle failure! I definitely see a difference in my clothes and energy level. Even simple things like carrying laundry upstairs used to exhaust me. Now I can carry several baskets at once..hey, those things matter! My main goal through all of this was to be healthier for everyday stuff...keeping up with kids, doing things with them and around the house.


So now we&apos;re on the home stretch....the hardest part is yet to come though...living this every day, and not going back to old habits.

Ending the week and coming to the realization there are only 3 weeks until reveal day. As exciting as it is, we are very sad to see it end. This is like our&quot;last chance workouts&quot;. We have to give it our all. We obviously took off on Thursday so we spent Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the gym. We also signed up to run in the Santa&apos;s Sleigh 5k while we were at the gym. This is two days before our last challenge so I hope it doesn&apos;t wear us out too much. We are looking forward to Monday night&apos;s workout.

Well this is Thanksgiving day. I hope all the families had a great day. I know that we had a free day as far as recording our food on line but I did keep track for Steve and I. We think we did pretty good because we ate a lot either fresh or frozen vegetables. We monitored the Turkey so that we had more vegetables on our plate then protein. We also nibbled on some fruit to help us keep full so we don’t over do on any of the other food. We only had yum yums for desert so that kept us out of too much trouble. I think between the fruit, vegetables and yum yums, we probably went over 80 mg of sugar but I will find out after I log all of this in. I hope we didn’t really fail our test of eating on our own.

Theron had us on the field tonight. He worked us on a longer ladder then we had used before. It actually was a good and fund workout because it was like using dance steps to get to the other end of the ladder. This was suppose to be our warm up but that really made everyone sweat. Then we went to work on our core. He introduced us to some new exercises but is insisting that we all will have a six pack by bathing suit season. The red team was talking about what it would take to continue with Theron after the winner is announced because we really like working out as a team.

Made it to the gym today after having yesterday off. Going on only 3 hours sleep due to black Friday shopping made it quite interesting, but somewhat refreshing. I feel like the less than 3 weeks we have left is flying by. I have yet to see much if ant weight come off since the last weigh-in, but I know my body is changing and will continue to change after this is all said and done. I&apos;m trying to work this week on endurance, and am going to try to plank several times per day as well as push myself with weights. I also want to get the kids in here some more before it&apos;s over. I think that even though they are going to be glad the competition is over, they are going to miss the Arena Club, and I&apos;m going to miss working along side with them.

Our first temptation is over and we survived. In fact, I think we did amazing. We went to my brother&apos;s house for dinner, but we went prepared. I made fresh green beans tossed with a little olive oil and sprinkled with Mrs. Dash and toasted sliced almonds. I also made maple glazed sweet potatoes from a recipe from Jillian Michaels. For dessert I made the crustless pumpkin pie (w/tofu) and put the mixture in a reduced fat graham cracker crust. The sweet potatoes were only 96 calories and the dessert was only 147 calories. I made sure I loaded half my plate with green beans and ate them first. I only had two tablespoons of stuffing and skipped the gravy. Henry was very good at controlling his portions and also ate the healthy sweet potatoes and dessert. Overall it was a great success and I am very proud of both of us.

Lisa&apos;s mom, who has been very supportive, prepared some healthy dishes like plain sweet potatoes, a low sodium crab spread, and a Weight Watchers apple dessert to name a few. Lisa converted a macaroni and cheese recipe using healthy ingredients and it was awesome. She also made the Yum-Yum mini spice muffins which everybody loved and couldn&apos;t believe how they&apos;re made. Looking forward to Monday and getting back in the groove

I hope every one had a happy Thanksgiving! We are very thankful this year.
Not only are we thankful for friends, family, and our country, but we are also thankful for the wonderful opportunity given to us by the Arena Club and the Fit4Life program. This journey has been about so much more than just losing weight, but has really helped bring our family together. Even though we have had our ups and downs, I do feel like our family is not only healthier but stronger.
Today wasn&apos;t about the food, but the opportunity to be with friends we care about. As we were guests this year I tried not to make the dinner about what I couldn&apos;t have but realized this was an opportunity to put to practice what I learned and trust myself. I had a bit of almost everything that was served, but had one plate and no seconds. I stuck to one of my chocolate pumpkin muffins for dessert. I have no idea how many calories I ate as I did not prepare the food, but focused instead on being thankful and eating in moderation. The kids did well too, although they did chose other desserts.
Be thankful and be blessed...the Lopus Family

Since Monday night was all legs, the majority of Wednesday was arms. We showed up early again to get in a good cardio workout before meeting up with&quot;mama&quot;. After sending us through her circuit a few times it was over to the mats for core work. This time it was set up in a circuit format as well. And for the grand finale was a crazy cookie roll. I would have loved to have video of that task. I&apos;m sure from Nicole&apos;s vantage point it was quite amusing to watch. I was waiting for Ashton Kutcher to come out and tell us we just got&quot;Punk&apos;d&quot;. We all had to squeeze together like sardines in a can and pass the foam roller to each other by rolling (no hands). It is always interesting and never duplicated. Now off for our first temptation - Thanksgiving!

Wednesday: I took a trip to Trader Joe&apos;s today as I had the day off from work. I picked up a few things to try...some chicken burgers, quinoa bread, some snack bars (which go really fast in our house as we&apos;re still a family on the go), butternut squash and butternut soup, and a few other odds and ends. The quinoa bread was worth the trip in itself. I had a piece this afternoon and it was wonderful. My problem is making foods in a quantity that fits our family. Often I&apos;ll make something, like my spit pea soup, and I am the only one who will eat it. Now I&apos;ve learned to put it in freezer bags for a quick lunch later on. My kids are still pretty picky, but definitely making better choices.
I felt like my head was actually at the gym tonight, so I actually felt like I had a better workout. We used free weights and really got a good workout. Before the competition I would look at the equipment and have absolutely no idea what to do with it. Now I feel like I can continue on even after this competition and try new things. I&apos;m also less intimidated by those I see working out!
One thing I really appreciate about the Arena Club is that there are people of all ages, races, nationalities, sizes, fitness abilities, etc. Never have I felt like someone was looking at me or judging me. Now mind you there are those who look absolutely fantastic (I am not yet one of them) but I find inspiration instead of judgement from working out beside them. Often gyms are full of cliques and such, and I honestly have not experienced that at all. I think what also helps is that this competition also contains people of all ages, sizes, abilities, etc. We&apos;re all working toward the same goals, even if in different ways.
The Lopus Family wishes everyone a very happy Thanksgiving tomorrow! Take the time to be thankful for all the wonderful blessings we have!

We finished week 9&apos;s scheduled training with an awesome strength circuit. Lisa, Anna, and I were a little sore from our strength training from last night, but tonight&apos;s routine hit our upper body with different exercises. It&apos;s hard to believe there&apos;s only 6 training sessions left. 
We hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving.

Nutrition Night! Tonight we had a test. It was nice to feel like we had really learned something (not so nice to realize there were things we still didnt fully understand) and of course, as always, new recipies to share. There was a lot of discussion tonight about the upcoming holidays and how others are plannign to beat the heavy-fatty foods fo Thanksgiving. I have said it before but having this community of people going through the same process who we can share info with and swap recipies is really invaluable.

It&apos;s all about the legs. I was all ready to take Alicia&apos;s spin class tonight but it was full. I guess God knew something that I didn&apos;tget - Nicole had a night filled with working our legs, legs, and then more legs. I am so thankful now that that spin class was full! Henry and I got there early and worked on cardio before we met with Nicole. Once we got with the sergeant it was run the stairs, do wall squats, and run the stairs again. Then repeat. We then split into 2 groups and the girls work for 20 minutes of cardio while the boys did the weight circuits. And then we switched up. Lastly we got to do lunges and squats. Both Henry and I felt very good after the night was over. We definitely weren&apos;t sore like we would have been in the beginning. I actually think we wish I would have been a little longer.

Monday night was a change up with new weight machines to work out on. Legs got a good work out and then on to lunges. Went home and walked the dogs for 30 min. I like being outside and when the weather cooperates I plan on walking on the ma and pa trail this weekend and getting to the gym. George work schedule is terrible now and had to work this past weekend , although the money will come in handy he is exhausted.

Nutrition class with a test. For some reason, that day was unusually stress full with work and my mind was not on everything we have learned over the weeks. Felt like I had brain fog but I do look at labels now at grocery store and make an effort with buying healthy food. It&apos;s is hard not to go down the cookie aisles and stay on the outside perimeter of the store with veg,fruit, meat, milk, etc. Still have a lot to learn but chipping away at my sweet addiction  with food.

Back on the field for a workout with ropes, a very heavy ball, and a bunjee cord workout, fun to change it up. Always a challenge to get to the gym for some reason, work, school, homework, everyday life but we always feel good when we leave. We had so much soreness when we started, but now I hope we can build on our stamina with exercise at home, walking 5 miles again on the trail by conowingo damn was fun to do with the family, just us and nature.

Monday night: a busy night with Nicole. I&apos;m exhausted as usual!
I have to admit that even though we are in week 9, it doesn&apos;t necessarily get easier. There is always a new challenge to face, a new obstacle to overcome. I am feeling a bit weary, but not by gym activities. Just life stuff. Even though I am&quot;used&quot;to deployments and being essentially a single parent, that doesn&apos;t mean I am good at it. I have a very hard time leaving life at the door of the gym and getting the most out of the workouts as these typically follow me. I know I could be doing so much more, both in the gym and as a parent.

Well week 9 started off with a leg blasting workout. By the time we were done my legs felt like jello. It&apos;s a good thing I&apos;m off tomorrow. Lisa made chili in the crock-pot today so dinner was waiting for us when we got home. We all know the third challenge (The obstacle course) is coming up. Nicole hasn&apos;t let us in on any details yet. So there&apos;s only been speculation as to what it will be.

Today we really worked out hard. We did some cardio and weight training plus a little abs workout. Every class is different from the one before and we never know what Theron has in store for us. My heel is still pretty sore but it is getting iced as we speak. I will have to wear the brace that I bought to help it out but forgot to wear tonight. I will pay for that in the morning. All in all I know that Steve and I getting stronger every day.

We got to take our first nutritional quiz. Everyone did really well. I guess that means we had a good teacher :) Since the majority of the group got one or two wrong it shows we are well on our way to making this a long term lifestyle change. We have been given the proper tools and it is up to us to stick to it. I made a lentil soup similar to the one Alicia brought in and made a crustless pumpkin pie with tofu that was gobbled up by the family all in the same day. I never shared with the kids that they were eating tofu. That is the second time I have been able to sneak that into a recipe. Before fit4life, I never would have thought about eating tofu. Now, I realize how versatile it is. I look forward to many more cooking and baking experiments. I hope my family doesn&apos;t tire of being my guinea pigs.

Friday night: Not a lot going on tonight. The two older kids are away for the weekend. It should be interesting to see how they eat, although they&apos;re going to a middle school youth conference, so my guess is that there are not going to be a lot of healthy options. Matthew, Zachary and I hit the Arena club and started by taking Zachary swimming. I was surprised at how ice old the baby pool was, so we hung out in the warmer therapy/main pool. Zachary liked swimming, although it wasn&apos;t really a workout for me, so I dropped him off in the day care and hit the Precor for a bit. I didn&apos;t get in as much as I wanted to...still fighting this chest cold and the medicine makes me feel blech...Today, Saturday, my main exercise goal is to get crackin&apos; on some house cleaning. It is amazing how many flights of stairs you can do by doing laundry, calories burned moving furniture to vacuum under it, and I might even get outside and rake some leaves. I have plenty around here to keep busy, and it will be interesting to see if I get a half way decent workout. Last year I lost 40 lbs just by using a mini trampoline and an exercise band. It is possible, but I appreciate the use of the Arena club and the expertise of the trainers and Alicia. It&apos;s just nice to know that if you can&apos;t get to the gym you can still be active. Have a great weekend! The Lopus Family

Well week 8 has come and gone. It&apos;s hard to believe there&apos;s only 4 weeks left. Lisa made the penne and shrimp primavera last night. Luckily she made a double recipe so we had it again today. This upcoming week is going to go by so quickly because it&apos;s short, but we are looking forward to the Thanksgiving break. I have to work Friday so we&apos;ll try to hit the gym when I get home.

We are ending week 8 and it is getting harder and harder to deal with the realization that this is almost over. If you would have told me a year ago that I would enjoy going to the gym, I would have told you that you were crazy. Both Henry and I look forward to getting together with our group and Nicole. I think that is what we&apos;ll miss the most. 

Both Saturday and Sunday we went went to the gym. Saturday was our strength training day and I even made myself do the stairs. It was a little awkward running the stairs while the holiday extravaganza was going on. I felt like people were staring at me, but I kept going anyway. Since it felt like I had eyes on me, I had to make sure I made it look easy. I will admit that it is a little easier than the first time Nicole made us do them. Sunday was a day of cardio and we even let the kids go swimming. It has become our family fun day. It is a little disappointing that the kiddie pool&apos;s heater is still broken. It is hard to handle 3 little ones in the bigger pool when you are by yourself. We typically split off and have one parent watch the kids while the other one works out and then switch so the kids get a few hours at the pool and we don&apos;t spend the entire day at the gym.

We are looking forward to our Monday night workout and getting the gang together again.

On Wednesday we started out with working on our abs. Then we moved on to the weights and worked both our upper body and legs. Those workouts were great since we had some sore legs from the 5K on Monday. The weights helped stretched our legs so at least both Steve and I can walk better on Thursday. We worked on some new machines plus some old familiar ones. I had to inform Theron that I have a partial Achilles tendon tear. He suggested that I get an ankle brace to help protect it since I am not willing to quit just because of the tear. I am going out to purchase the brace today plus a heel lift to help cushion the heel from shock.

Well challenge 2 is complete. Congrats are in order for all participants since everyone finished it. I know I was the last one to finish but I am glad that I was able to complete it. Seven weeks ago I know I would not have been able to do it. Thanks for all the people from both teams who helped to cheer me on towards the end of my 3.1 miles. I believe it was Theron who said that I would sleep good and believe me I did. I barely made it in the door, changed my clothes and fell asleep quickly. I am proud of Steve that he was able to do this challenge as well and finish it within a respectable time.

Tonight, we prepared ourselves for the summer. We targeted our abdominal muscles! The crunches, leg lifts, etc are so helpful that we can incorporate at home. After Theron tortured our abs, he then made us do our weight circuit! We always try to increase our weights each time, but Jackie seemed to be having a hard time lifting some weights today. We all managed along though and it is nice to see everyone increasing their weights and resistances or inclines, everyone is really pulling along. It looks like we had some&quot;casualties&quot;from teh 5k though. We were down a teammate and kudos to Barb for soldering on with her town muscle! She is really a trooper.

Today, we took a day off from the gym. Actually, we needed the day off after yesterday’s big challenge. Our bodies were sore, but it was sore in the good way. We took the day to prepare some meals for the weeks ahead. We both love Indian food and we were excited to find some low calorie recipes. It is so nice to know that we can still eat our favorite foods if we wisely choose our ingredients. You heard the saying,“spice is the way of life,”that is so true with foods. For a lot of our ingredients, we realized that if you use your spices (cumin, turmeric, cardamom, etc) with your fresh meats and/or vegetables, the taste is delectable, minus the extra fats, of course!

Wow! We did it! Nearly 8 weeks ago, who would have thought, we would be one of the people who can say“We ran/walked a 5k?” Amazing! Not only that Matt and I were able to complete our 5k challenge in less than an hour, we were amazed that for the first time in this competition, we experienced a sense of teamwork not only with our own red team, but with the black team as well! If you are reading this and have never done a 5k before, I am here to tell you that it is not impossible. With perseverance and determination, you can do it. Every person finished and that is a win in its own right.
I am glad that we did it but I am also glad that it is over and we dont have to worry about it any more.

Matt worked on his upper body today and took the rest of the day with Sarah in the pool. One of the great things about the Arena Club is that our 2.5 year old daughter can take advantage of the arena as well! She loves the pool or what she calls,“the big pool, daddy”or quite simply,“I am going to splash, mama!”She is also enjoying the child care.
One of the biggest motivations in living healthy is compliments! Yes, of course, living healthy should be a motivation, but also, it so great to know that other people see your body transforming as well. I ran into someone tonight at the grocery store who I have not seen in a while. She simply says,“Are you wasting away?” Then of course, we started talking about the program, and the changes that happened in our bodies/health in the last 7 weeks. She simply cannot believe that in less than 7 or 8 weeks, with proper nutrition and fitness, you can see your body change. Can you imagine what we would look like a year from now??? Perhaps, that is a motivation, right?

Another Friday night at the gym!! Looking forward to Monday’s event, we need to do as much practicing as we can without overdoing it. I was able to finally reach the 5k goal for the first time tonight but I was not too happy with my time. I will have to step it up by Monday. Jackie and I both struggle through the pain as we run but we just need to get used to running and hopefully the pain will not be an issue. Monday, here we come!

At the beginning of this program, Kathy Wise said,“80 percent of your weight loss is nutrition.” She is absolutely right! Not eating the vital level of calories is not beneficial to your weight loss. You must eat in order to have energy and you must try to control your portions so you do not go way over your allotted daily caloric intake, thus leading to weight gain. Almost 7 weeks ago, we had done a food makeover in our household. Fast foods are not our best friends anymore (ok, sometimes, but not every day anymore). Once you give yourself a few weeks to eat healthier, your body is going to know, and you will feel the change almost instantly. We now watch what we put in our foods. We heard people say before that healthy food is bland and boring. We are here to tell you that is not the case. There are hundreds of low calorie, healthy recipes out there that will teach you healthier alternatives. For example, instead of using cream, use greek yogurt, 0% fat. It is so great!

Wednesday was a somber day, as we lost one of the families from our team. We understand why she had to go but she will be missed greatly. Jenn was a fierce competitor and a great asset.
Tonight, Theron prepared our legs for the upcoming 5K challenge. I think we are all very worried. He had us running around the field, mainly to demonstrate how much harder it is to run on the ground instead of the treadmill, but also to show us we can do it. He gave us 20 minutes to run a mile. After a while, our legs were shaking! After we finished that, we got a quick break and then we did our infamous bootcamp! Our team is really working hard! Theron always pushes us, but in the right ways.

Today in nutrition class we had a quiz to see if we remember what we have learned. We discovered that we knew quite a bit but there were some things that we completely forgot. I did remember all what we need to do regarding the holidays is basically plan, plan, and plan some more. Drink plenty of water, take your own plate and exercise more are some of the tricks to making it through the holidays. What Steve and I usually do is split up at least for Thanksgiving but this year Steve has off on Friday so we are going to go to my parents house. Steve didn’t want to go with his family because they will sabotage his eating plans. They usually say it is only one day so eat up. You can starve yourself the next three days. So instead of Steve planning for a fight with his family he is gong with me to mine. My family at least tries to accommodate healthy eating habits into our holiday meals. Don’t get me wrong we do have things that are not so healthy as well, that is what got me into this mess in the first place. The problem would be to have will power to keep from having all of the bad stuff. This year though my mom decided that she wanted to start eating healthy as well and is proud of what Steve and I have accomplished so far.  She asked me what I thought we should have for the holidays and I told her that I will bring the turkey breast and yum yum muffins for desert. She will just have to make the vegetables. I think Steve and I will handle the Thanksgiving Holidays this year and not gain weight but actually maintain or lose some (at least that is our goal).

It&apos;s crazy how quickly a week goes by. Today Zachary and I got to hit the gym this morning instead of trying to fit it in before the nutrition class. I almost felt guilty now working out this evening. In nutrition we got to test what we have learned over the past 8 weeks. We also had a bit of an open forum which was nice. The older two kids are going away for the weekend. It should be interesting to hear about the food choices they make, especially since I am pretty sure it will all be kid foods.

Wednesday night on the field with various stations - ropes, kettle bells, medicine balls, resistance bands and some crazy bungee cord. We started off by running laps and then quickly moved through the stations. I find the ropes the hardest. They don&apos;t look heavy, but they are. This bungee contraption was new to us tonight, but I found it to be my favorite. We then had a tug of war contest between us (something I haven&apos;t done since I was a kid). We ended the night with inch worms and lunges. I&apos;m not a fan of the inch worm. Although I was able to do more push ups now than the first time we did them. We all left sweaty once again. Nicole never disappoints!

Can I just say again that Nicole is amazing! Tonight was killing on the field. We did a circuit of activities that really stretched me to my limit. Ben and Megan were on the field tonight and they gave their all as well. My goal for the remainder of this week is to really focus on strength training and getting my cardio in. I took two days off last week which I&apos;m still feeling guilty for! Next week is Thanksgiving as well. I made a turkey in the slow cooker today and will be eating on that for several meals. I didn&apos;t even bother to cook the dark meat because we wouldn&apos;t be eating it anyway. There will be a few challenges as we&apos;re going to be eating our Thanksgiving dinner with friends, but I think if we plan ahead we can all still be successful.

I grabbed the kids early Tuesday morning and headed to the gym. I really had an internal battle with myself whether or not to go because I felt exhausted and sore from the 5k the night before. I decided to jump back on that horse and get&quot;a little of the hair of the dog that bit me&quot;. I did 30 minutes of cardio and 30 minutes of strength training followed by a nice soak in the hot tub. Henry had to work late and couldn&apos;t make it to the gym. I know we will be in for another surprise workout Wednesday night. Can&apos;t wait.

Henry is disappointed that he got a massive calf cramp 1.25 miles into it. He has worked so hard practicing and calculating and was so sure he was going to be able to win. He did come in 3rd which isn&apos;t bad. I&apos;m happy about 4th, I was just hoping to have a better time. It was great that everyone finished. I can&apos;t wait to see what they have in store for us for challenge #3.

Lisa said she wasn&apos;t too sore and had a good strength workout too. We ran 10 laps on the stairs which really made my legs burn! We finished with an ab workout and headed home. We&apos;re looking forward to being on the field tomorrow.

We started week 8 with the second challenge of the program, the 5k. Everyone had been training for the past couple of weeks, and it showed. From some of the conversations we had after the challenge it appears that everybody&apos;s times had improved greatly. For me a few weeks ago I tried a 5k and completed it in 39 minutes. Tonight I did it in 29 minutes and 30 seconds!
The main objective was met in that no one gave up! This is proof positive that this program works. If you give all you have in the training sessions and are honest with your diet you will see results and reap the benefits of a healthier lifestyle!

Tuesday night. After yesterday&apos;s run my knees and ankles were not very happy with me. I started out tonight&apos;s workout with a soak in the hot tub to loosen up and then hit the Precor and elliptical for 30 minutes, followed by some time on the stationary bike. I have not been on the bike since our very first challenge. I have a feeling I won&apos;t be on the treadmill for a long time either after last night&apos;s challenge! Tomorrow night is Nicole, and I&apos;m sure she&apos;s planning something fun for us as it&apos;s a field night.
I&apos;m watching the Biggest Loser as we write this, and one of the contestants is talking about how she&apos;s already won, even though she hasn&apos;t won the competition. I completely understand that feeling. Knowing where my standing has been in the two challenges I know my chances of winning the Fit 4 Life competition is slim. I could take that knowledge and only give half effort, or I can continue to give it 110% regardless. I choose the 110%. I can only get healthier from here. I have come so far in this journey. I&apos;m not giving up, and I&apos;m not giving up after the competition is over. I have been given an opportunity of a lifetime. Not only am I regaining my health and gaining endurance and strength I&apos;ve never had in my entire life, but my children are right along side of me in this journey. How is THAT not winning?

5 K was tonight...I am so glad that is OVER! I didn&apos;t meet my goal...I was aiming for under 40 minutes, and I was just over 41 1/2 but I can&apos;t complain because I&apos;ve never done that much before. I didn&apos;t run the entire thing either, but pushed myself whenever I could. Megan unfortunately could not run as she&apos;s had a fever all day. I felt bad. She actually offered to come walk it, but we didn&apos;t want to push things, especially with her not feeling well. Afterwards I&quot;celebrated&quot;by stopping at my favorite Italian restaurant on the way home. I picked up a grilled veggie sub with no cheese or mayo. I came home and put on my own mayo so I could control the portion! Funny how these things never mattered before. I also picked up a treat for the kiddos...a small cheese pizza. Usually they would devour a large between the 4 of them and still want more. Each kid had one piece and they were good. Although it seems like a splurge I want them to realize that they can still have their favorite foods but in moderation and controlled (kind of like the cheese on my sub).
Tomorrow it&apos;s back to reality. Now that the 5 K is over I feel like I can kick it up a notch on cross training and hopefully pick up some different classes and such. Of course the next challenge is just around the corner, and Theron told us it&apos;s going to be even tougher than the 5 K. I&apos;ll give it my best shot!

Well challenge 2 is complete. Congrats are in order for all participants since everyone finished it. I know I was the last one to finish but I am glad that I was able to complete it. Seven weeks ago I know I would not have been able to do it. Thanks for all the people from both teams who helped to cheer me on towards the end of my 3.1 miles. I believe it was Theron who said that I would sleep good and believe me I did. I barely made it in the door, changed my clothes and fell asleep quickly. I am proud of Steve that he was able to do this challenge as well and finish it within a respectable time.

We got a special treat from Alicia - lentil and quinoa soup. It was pretty tasty, but I could definitely taste the salt. We went over ways to be prepared for the holidays. She is giving us a free pass from logging on Thanksgiving. I&apos;m not sure I agree with that. We are so new to this healthy change I&apos;m afraid it gives us too much freedom for indulgence. I&apos;m not really bothered by the family meals. I&apos;m not feeling the temptations (yet anyway). My husband&apos;s eyes lit up with the free pass though, but he has a much easier time losing weight than me so he can eat a little more. 4 days to the 5k and counting.

We spent a relatively quiet weekend. My legs are sore from all of the practicing I have done for the treadmill. We did go to the doctor for a check up. This was the first one since being selected by the arena club. Both Steve and I were pretty much in trouble with our doctor. I was told to start to lose weight and Steve was to start controlling his eating so that his sugar and blood pressure comes down. Well I did lose weight which made her very happy and Steve did a tremendous job with both his sugar and blood pressure. His blood pressure was the best it has been since having a stroke. If this continues he may actually be taken off of some of his drugs. The day they took our blood pressure at the arena club, Steve’s was 168/80. On Friday it was 120/70. The nutrition class helped a lot by making us log our food we started to discover what hidden sugar and salt were in foods. The exercising also helped him with both sugar and salt intake as well. Naturally just by exercising and eating well, I lost weight. We have to go back in three months to make sure we are still improving. Steve will be seeing the cardiologist on Tuesday to see if he can pass a stress test which I think he should be able to. After that his cardiologist and family doctor will discuss which if any drugs he could be taken off of. We know that he can’t be removed from all of them at once but even having one removed is a step in the right direction.

Friday I took the kids early in the morning and did some cardio and strength training. I tried very hard not to over do the legs to save them for Monday. Henry went to the gym and worked out on the weights.
For dinner I made an eggless spinach quiche with tofu. I enjoyed it but it didn&apos;t get rave reviews from the rest of the clan. I also came up with a crazy concoction of pumpkin, wheat germ and oatmeal drop cookies. They are not the greatest, but tolerable enough to get some wheat germ in our diets. The next post will be reporting after the 5k.

Mark and I started our day off with a trip to the gym. It was rather crowded because of the holiday. My sister came as a guest to workout with us. We started her off on the AMT and then moved on to the bike for some cardio. After this it was time to show her some ab work that Nicole always works into our training. Needless to say, it was actually fun torturing her with the ab crunches. Misery really does love company. Surprisingly, she actually wanted a little more after the crunches so....off to the rowing machine we went. It was nice having her workout with me today. I think we will be taking the next two days off for some rest before the big 5k challenge on Monday.

Tonight it was quiet in the gym. I&apos;m taking it a bit easy knowing that the 5K is on Monday. I worked on my arms and did about 40 minutes of cardio. Today I was subbing for a high school chemistry class which meant a lot of sitting...pretty much sitting the entire day. This is completely different than yesterday when I was with an active kindergarten class. While I enjoy the fact that no two days are the same, sitting all day was less than ideal. As I contemplated taking tonight off from the gym, the realization of how little activity I got today really motivated me. Even though I was tired from having to be at work very early I knew I had to do something active. Going to the gym actually gave me energy, and now I have the rest of the evening to get other things done. Happy weekend everyone!

Missed George tonight being with me since he is still feeling bad . He will need to make a quick recovery for Monday. When he gets sick he really takes a beating with all his past health problems . I know he can do it and be back feeling good for Monday. Always learning something new at the nutrition class. The holidays are always a time of food and more food/ Need to start thinking about the changes we need to make so we are not tempted at every party or outing. My mother makes the best holiday cookies and she has been making cut out sugar cookies since I was little and she is 75 now and still makes them with my Dad who is 76 . We did survive Halloween without to much damage. I can say I probably ate 1/8 of what was normal in the past. I could easily eat 2 bags of candy. big bags , just being honest . Jayne

Mark and I had another night that we were able to get to the gym and workout without the kids. We went early to do some of our cardio and strength before the nutrition class at 7:00pm. It is amazing that after only 6 weeks we are up on our weights and increasing our cardio at a pretty steady rate. Alicia brought in some lentil and quinoa stew for us to try and I got to say I will be making it for our family. It is really nice to share different ideas on cooking so that variety stays part of the diet. We have been trying to take the normal foods we ate and twist it enough so that it is healthy instead of the way we were eating it. So far we have found many good choices that have given us our old dinners just with a lot less sodium.

Thursday night&apos;s nutrition class talked about holiday eating. We also got to sample some lentil and quinoa stew which wasn&apos;t bad. It&apos;s easy to get in a rut with foods when dieting. I have to think about this as not a diet but as a lifestyle change. I&apos;m hoping I can continue with what I&apos;ve learned far past the 12 weeks. Often it is said that you need to start something with small changes, but in this process we have all made huge changes. It would be very easy to go back to old habits, but I think we will all feel so amazing when the program is over that none of us will be able to see food in the same way.

Tonight’s nutrition class was about surviving the holidays. Alicia gave us some very good ideas especially if you are not in control of the food. I know for Thanksgiving we are going to my parent’s rather then going to Steve’s because of the cooking. My parents are more health conscious then his so I can at least trust that we will be able to eat dinner. We will probably pack some things so that we don’t wipe out my parent’s food. My mom and I have been discussing Thanksgiving dinner to determine what we all can have. She also asked me about dessert. I told her not to worry about it because I will make and bring yum yum muffins with me. My mom cannot have chocolate so I am thinking of trying the recipe by using the red velvet cake rather then the chocolate cake. I can say that I have been on every diet out there and then some. But one thing they all had in common was structure such as telling you for breakfast have one protein, one dairy etc and then provide a list of food to choose from. This is completely different and we are having difficulty trying to figure a structure out that works for us. We have been pretty good but we are running out of ideas on what else to have. Alicia had provided some really good ideas and we will give them a whirl next week. Hopefully we will be successful. This nutrition class is definitely a learning experience and it will keep for a life time.

Wow, Nicki&apos;s in da&apos; house! We walk in and warm up and stretch and then meet Nicole at 7 om as usual. She says,&quot;ok guys, grab a treadmill and run for 30 minutes&quot;. I really thought she was joking, but nope she was dead serious. If that wasn&apos;t enough we did calisthenics for about 25 minutes. Nicole says I know you don&apos;t have anymore to give, but do it anyway. I&apos;m paraphrasing, but it was pretty close to that. She is always changing things up and constantly pushing us. Another restless night due to sore muscles. Looking forward to meeting with Alicia and a pain free night!

 We ended week 7&apos;s scheduled training days with a nice 30 minute run. It was good to see where I stood in reference to running a 5k. Everyone did really well. Nobody stopped either running or walking for the entire 30 minutes which is awesome. Everyone is definitely psyched up for the challenge on Monday. And of course after running we had time left for core training.
Lisa&apos;s mom is watching the girls for us again tomorrow evening so we&apos;ll be able to get in the gym early for a workout before the nutrition class.

Theron tried to condition us again for the 5K run. He had us run 25 laps around the field. He said that would be harder then the treadmill because we had to carry our own weight. The treadmill moves whether you move or not. You may fall off but you still don’t have to carry your own weight. He then had us do some boot camp.    We ate a meatless dinner tonight. It was egg whites plus some onions, green peppers and mozzarella cheese. It was pretty good and quick to fix. We will have to do that more often.

Had a bad start today... George had to go to work at 4:30 in the morning for an important job feeling miserable with headache and sore throat. He got home and went right to bed and I had a bad headache all day. We felt wiped out and could not make it tonight. Felt bad physically and mentally for not making it Wednesday . Funny how the gym is a high priority now so we both felt bad not being there. Jayne and George

Went to the gym on Tuesday by myself because George had to work for a cousin doing electric work. Tried the Zumba class, but went to the treadmill to work on my stamina for the 5k. I take my tylenol before and after the workout , and so far I&apos;m not in terrible pain like before. Jayne

After tonight&apos;s workout the first thing that came into my mind was a quote from a movie called Cool Runnings. In the movie there is a sledding accident and one person says to the other&quot;you dead?&quot;The other person replies&quot;Yeah man&quot;....that&apos;s how I felt tonight! We ran in preparation of Monday night&apos;s upcoming 5K. I will be so glad when this run is over. The next few days I&apos;m going to work on stretching out and resting up, and hopefully I&apos;ll do better than tonight. It&apos;s been an incredible journey. I am already thinking about how I&apos;m going to miss my teammates and Nicole pushing me on to do things I never thought I could do. Fortunately we still have a few weeks to go.

Monday 11/7
Our team is still feeling the pressure of the big gap in weight loss today.
We really stepped it up tonight and we were all over the gym. We did a joint cardio and weight circuit with partners that pushed us hard! But we were jumping on and off those machines and working like a regimented unit. We were driven. We completed our circuit fast enough to head to the field and workout down there, capping it off with core work. I was again happy to have no cramps or spasms during the core work. But I must say that I am really proud of my team. I don&apos;t think we have a single slacker. Every one pushes themself harder and faster. Each of us is giving it all we have. Yet through it all we can still laugh and joke. Jenn plays and teases with her sons, Omelia cracks a smile as she jogs down the field with Jackie. And we feel good about how far we have come. I watched Barbara jog down that field tonight and thought about how much she has accomplished in just 6 weeks.
Team Theron rocks!

Henry went to the gym after work. Unfortunately work kept calling and interrupting his work out so after treadmill training he left, but he didn&apos;t give up. He went back to the gym later with the kids and me and I actually convinced him to take CX Works with me. He is usually not a class taker. After CX Works we went our separate ways. I stayed for Zumba and he went upstairs to do the weight circuit. Later we met up with Alicia who let us try her quinoa cookies with prune juice. They weren&apos;t bad. She then showed me a piece of equipment to help with my chin splints. Afterwards I worked on the triceps because they need a TON of extra work. Can&apos;t wait to see what Wednesday brings.

Met with our nutrition counceler thursday and got our weight results. George recently lost 25 lbs the dangerous way in the hospital in May which was a very scary time for the family. He is on the right road now with making changes with food and exercise and even though he lost 9 lbs. so far he did it the healthy way.

We were able to hit the gym early tonight thanks to soccer being over. It was a little crowded but it was nice to get in a good workout and get home early. Lisa made a ROCKIN&apos; dinner tonight. She made the crockpot chicken and salsa with a little twist. She skipped the beans and pulled the chicken. She scooped out 4 ounces and put it on a flatout with 2 tablespoons of fat free sour cream, some lettuce, and I had a 1/4 cup of low sodium mozzarella cheese. Talk about an awesome tasting chicken taco! It was only 362 calories and 675 mg sodium!

A busy Tuesday night. It was nice to see my fellow Fit4Lifers there...we always have lots to share. Even though this is a competition I feel like there is so much to learn from my fellow teammates. Kim even came over and bumped up the speed on my treadmill while I was on it! (Nicole&apos;s little mini-me!). I didn&apos;t have the opportunity to do as much as I&apos;d like tonight but I did work some on some sore muscles with this black foam tube thing that has this really fancy name. To me it looks like a pool noodle on steroids. Anyway, Nicole showed us last night how to use this to roll out some of the knots in our muscles and to loosen up some of the casings around the muscles. It hurt and felt great at the same time if that makes sense. I&apos;m definitely adding it to my routine. I also worked on my mile a bit before calling it a night. I&apos;m soaking split peas tonight in an effort to make another meatless meal for tomorrow night. I&apos;m finding the nutrition aspect definitely fun. I love how everyone is so willing to share their thoughts and ideas on Thursday nights! It&apos;s probably one of the most important parts to this process...you can exercise and do everything the trainers tell you, but if you&apos;re leaving and not eating what you&apos;re supposed to be eating then the results just aren&apos;t going to be there.

Saturday was a nice day and we were able to get out early to the gym. We logged more treadmill time and Jackie was really dedicated to hit the 3.2 mile mark. I was really proud of her for keeping going. After that, we took Sarah down to the pool for more swim time. She got to have the kiddie pool all to herself and stayed for a long time.

 Jackie was able to make it to the gym for Zumba tonight. I didn&apos;t get there in time. She had a blast as always. I got to spend some more time working the treadmill. It is still very difficult for me but I am slowly improving.
I did some rotations with the weights as well. By the time I was done, I could barely walk out of the door.

Tonight we all got to hear the results of the measurements. There were some massive losses on the other team, but I am really proud of our team. We lost more inches and I think I see some major changes in my teammates. We are all able to do a lot of things we could not have before. As always, the lecture was great and talking about where to find which foods also really helps.
Alicia has been on me about my convenience foods and she is right, that is my crutch and I have to let it go. I need to get my meals sorted out ahead of time to avoid the bad stuff.

Jeric&apos;s 31st Blog; week #7. Well there&apos;s no way anyone from our team can say they&apos;re bored with the same old routines. Other than the strength and cardio programs she gave us to do on our own, Nicole continues to come with new and intense training regimens . And of course no training session with Nicole would be complete without a core busting finish.

Lisa and I thought it would be a good idea to start making notes on the training routines so we could implement them at home when the program is over (I wonder where I can find a 200 lb tractor tire... ha ha ).

 Everyone is  training for the 5k on Monday.We should hopefully see some good times. I never like long distance running but I&apos;m getting better at it.

Theron worked us like a dog tonight in order to prepare us for the 5K challenge. First we did rotation between the treadmill and resistant training. We then went to the field where we did sprints and side steps. Then we went to work our core and he is getting tougher on that as well. The group as a whole is really improving. After class Theron showed me how to stretch my calves and shins because after all of that work out my legs were killing me. The two exercises he showed me were great. The both seem to reduce some of the pain in my lower leg.

Wow, what a roller coaster weekend and beginning to the week. Lots of stress is coming down the pike and I&apos;m struggling to focus. I have to realize that taking care of myself is a priority, and the rest will work out.
I tried salmon last night and it was okay. The kids seemed to like it, although I think there are better recipes out there. Tonight we had a meatless dinner...cheese omelets and Ezekiel cinnamon raisin bread. It was a quick and easy dinner...
 Had a good work out with Nicole tonight, like usual. It&apos;s never boring and never the same thing twice. It can get very repetitive to just go to the gym, get on an elliptical or other machine, lift some weights, go home...that&apos;s part of what has gotten me into this trouble is just getting stuck in a routine. Keeping it fresh and exciting really helps to keep motivation high. It&apos;s going to be a busy week, and I look forward to Wednesday empowering me to get through the rest of it.

This weekend really proved you have to work hard to fit exercise in your life. Friday I took the kids to the gym in the early morning since they were off school and I was able to get in an awesome full body workout. Henry had full intentions on hitting the gym on his way home, but his plans got derailed. He was in the parking lot of the gym when he got a phone call from a friend who needed his plumbing expertise. So this became his day of rest. He was able to get up early Saturday morning and hit the gym before our full day of soccer tournaments. By the time we were done and ate and ran errands, the gym was closed and I couldn&apos;t go. My husband graciously got out his tools and fixed our treadmill so I could still do my 5k training. Gotta love a handy man! Sunday is another day of at home workouts due to soccer and a end of season soccer party. Monday it&apos;s back to the gym.

 Soccer will officially be over tomorrow (yeah!). Anna&apos;s team won both of their tournament games today. Tomorrow she has one more playoff game at 12:45 and if they win that they play for the championship at 3:45. Anna&apos;s coach has made several comments on how well Anna&apos;s performance has improved since starting the Fit4Life program. She is so much more energetic . Emily won their first game but lost their second so her season is over. So as of Monday we&apos;ll have one less thing to juggle. 

 We had some friends over for dinner tonight. They loved the chili and the spice Yum-Yum muffins Lisa prepared. 
We look forward to seeing our team on Monday and gearing up for the second half of the program .

We went to the club a little later then expected due to a home maintenance issue. Steve and I both tried to work out on the tread mill for a while. Steve will definitely have no issue making the 5K run next week. I on the other hand still need some work. I am making progress but it is really hard to run for any length of time. We then worked on the bike. We are at level three on Theron’s workout sheet. We will be going back to the club tomorrow to work out again. I will try the treadmill to at least try to increase my speed and then work or something else.

11/4/2011 JEN: I’m taking some time today to reflect on the results from yesterday. We did meet after the nutrition meeting with Theron and I sense the red team is just discouraged at this point. I’m not sure if we’re disappointed with ourselves as much as we are not sure exactly how the other team has lost so much more than us. Theron has been doing such a good job with us during our workouts and Alicia is doing well at advising us for nutrition. I think I feel like in my case, I expected the results I got because I didn’t do as well with food logging and eating in the past two weeks. I’m not looking at this as just a contest and don’t want this to be a temporary change. In the long term, I’d be making better food choices and become more active in general without tracking every detail - it would become second nature. I’m curious to know at this point if the people from last year’s competition sustained their weight loss, food changes, and kept up with the intense workout schedule that this year’s teams seem to be having.

I’m guessing that Michael wasn’t completely discouraged by this week because he is meeting Franklin and Dominic at the gym today for a pre-5K workout. Maybe the talk yesterday is motivating him to step it up. I would love to see the red team rebound in the second half of the competition.

11/3/2011 JEN: Wow, tough nutrition meeting tonight with Alicia, Kathy and Nicole. We learned that we had lost 90 lbs less than the other team overall in the first 6 weeks of the program. But, we lost 8 inches more than them, although that didn’t seem to be mentioned. I was fairly uncomfortable with the fact that every team members results were read out to the group, and I thought it was really wrong when Michael didn’t even have results read because I guess he’d broken even. I’d lost only about half of what some of the other women on both teams have lost which I’m ok with because I know I haven’t been as dedicated about getting to the gym every single day.

I think that losing 30 lbs in just 6 weeks is more than is healthy to lose in a short amount of time, and I’m happy with losing between 1-2 lbs a week. I know that its a long haul, and over the past 14 months have dropped 22 lbs. Slow and steady is a healthier approach in my opinion. I’m mostly concerned at this stage of the competition about the boys. I don’t want them to have an unhealthy relationship with food and fitness, but I wonder if the“competitive”focus on weight loss is really the best approach for all of us.

 11/2/2011 JEN: The past week has been the most challenging for the Lewis family as far as food logging, eating right, getting to the gym and blogging. We had another birthday (Ben) complete with a sleepover party for 9 year olds, junk food, cupcakes and a banana derby (ok, so that was almost healthy...) I did have a veggie tray that Michael and I snacked on which was good. We ate out a few more times than we probably would otherwise have this week more for convenience. Planning meals is the most challenging part of the contest, especially as a single mom. Choosing healthy foods is hard enough but also keeping variety and convenience in mind is tougher than I thought. I need to revisit the crockpot this week. 

Theron took our 6 week measurements. I know I’ve lost inches just purely based on the fact that I now need smaller pants. I’m not sure how we did compared to the starting point but I’m optimistic that I’m in a good place for inches lost.

Friday...the gym was unusually busy for a Friday night. I guess everyone is focusing on keeping off those extra holiday pounds! I&apos;m not too worried about the holidays as it&apos;s going to be pretty quiet around here as we&apos;re not near family. I was really proud of how the kids handled the Halloween candy. They&apos;ve been making smart choices and are sending the rest of their candy to Dad who&apos;s in Iraq (not that he needs it but it&apos;s not available there so it&apos;s an extra treat and I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll share it with the other guys still stuck there).
I ran a mile tonight. I can&apos;t seem to get past that mile mark for running. I know it&apos;s a mental thing that I need to break through. I was talking to a friend tonight who said he had some extra time when he got off of work so he ran 7 miles on his treadmill...just like that...7 miles...wow. While I do not enjoy running at all I would like to someday be able to run on a somewhat regular basis. I know it takes continued training, and I&apos;m pretty sure when we&apos;re done with this 12 weeks I&apos;ll be able to do that mile much more easily! So even when the challenge is over next week I&apos;m going to still keep trying to run at least a few days a week.
I also worked out a bit on weights, which I&apos;m finding I enjoy. It&apos;s funny, when I was going the gym tonight I was totally not into it...not wanting to go at all, feeling kind of down and blue, but once I was done I honestly thought to myself...wow, I feel better now. So much better than what I used to previously do which was sit on my computer playing mindless games and eating....On to week 7!

Before our nutrition meeting, Theron gave us our measurements. I cannot believe Steve and I lost that many inches. Steve okay on the weight loss but I definitely did. We are both really getting much stronger. Theron really pushes us to our limits. We then went to work out on the treadmill for a while. We both improved that before we had to stop to go to the class. There we budget meal planning. We had for years thought about joining a CSA but never really looked into it much. I get emails at work about the time to start participating in it. I believe we will join it this year. I stopped by Jones farm on Saturday which was their last day open and purchased a bunch of produce. The fresh fruits and vegetables we got were pretty good. We also received some recipes that I think we will try this week. I may have to adapt them some because in each recipe there is something one of us doesn’t like.

Had our spaghetti squash dinner with our turkey meatballs again tonight. I love that this is so healthy because we feel like it is soooo bad. We tried spinach for our salad and gotta say that is a keeper also. It has been a great help to drop the kids off at my mom&apos;s and go workout as long as we want to. Soccer ends tomorrow and we are trying to squeeze in a visit to the gym between the last soccer game and having friends over for dinner. I am thinking of chili in the crock pot, low sodium of course. Luckily, our friends are also involved in gaining a healthier lifestyle so I think they will be on board with that and spice muffins for dessert.

We had our nutritional meeting but it didn&apos;t start out the same. This week Kathy and Nicole came to talk to us and go over the results from our six week measurements. I know there were mixed emotions amongst the crowd. I know I don&apos;t feel like I am where I thought I would be by now, but that just made me want to work harder than ever. The thought of giving up never even crossed my mind. Henry has done awesome and I hope his mojo keeps up and the weight keeps dropping off. We will continue to travel on this journey no matter if we finish first or finish last (still hoping for first though) :)

Well week 6&apos;s scheduled sessions are over. Lisa and I were able to drop the girls off at Lisa&apos;s mom&apos;s so we got to the gym early and hit a good strength workout and got some cardio in as well.

Alicia again had some great tips on nutrition and good ideas on mixing it up so as not to get bored with our meals. 
Everyone in the program should be proud of their achievements thus far and should be excited to see what the next 6 weeks will yield for us. My family has learned so much from this program and as far as I&apos;m concerned we are all winners.

Thursday night. I&apos;m still feeling some of the effects of a nasty headache I had yesterday and into today. I was able to do some weights with Megan but struggled doing cardio as my energy level still isn&apos;t where it could be. I&apos;m hoping by tomorrow I&apos;ll be back to myself and able to knock out another mile on that treadmill, maybe even more. Tonight in our nutrition class we had an opportunity to celebrate the 6 week results of all the Fit 4 Life members. Everyone did a great job and should really be proud of themselves. I think we&apos;re all making great steps to a healthier life past these 12 weeks. We also talked about how to make healthy eating less painful on the pocketbook, specifically having more meat-less meals. I think we all get stuck in the idea that we have to have meat at every meal...I know I do. But there are a lot of options out there for great protein sources that are not meat based. Not only is it cheaper, but it has health benefits as well. I look forward to trying some of the recipes and ideas in the upcoming weeks.

 

Nicole: Trainer&apos;s Take
 posted: 11.07.2011 

 I want to express how very proud I am.  Each person in this competition should really be proud.  We essentially lost a 150.9 lbs person and lots and lots of inches.

I want to make sure everyone understands that weight loss is not the only indication that someone is choosing a healthier lifestyle.  It&apos;s what we tend to narrow our sights on but truly it&apos;s the whole picture.  We need to remember to consider quality of life and the tools that allow us to gauge serious health risk... blood pressure, waist and abdominal girth, resting heart rate, body fat percentage, etc.

There is no secret to getting healthier.... Excellent nutrition choices, daily exercise, focus and effort.  Keep training hard this is only the beginning to the rest of a healthier lifestyle.

 

Team Measurements!!!!!

 Nicole&apos;s Team 150.9 lbs lost    89.5 inces lost
 Theron&apos;s Team 60.8 lbs lost     81.475 inches lost
 

 Fit 4 Life Total 211.7 lbs lost    170.975 inches lost

Wednesday was measurement time and the weigh in. We made changes in all areas, definitely a lot more to go. Hope to step it up at the gym. After the weigh in , we went to the field to do sprints and then core exercises. George and I both had a coughing fit after we left the gym. George said because are lungs never saw such a workout. We definitely are seeing a small change, but if we were not here we would be home saying how tired we are . small changes will lead to big changes.

Sat 10/29
We went to the gym late morning to get our workout in and have a swim. It was a great way to warm up from the cold and we got to watch the snow as we practiced on the treadmill. It is definitely going to be rough for both of us. Sarah was really happy to have the kiddie pool to herself (at least for a bit). We left warm and happy, walking out into the snow.

Mon 10/31
Monday was a bit odd, as a lot of people had to shift schedules around to accommodate halloween plans. We got in to the gym early to do a weights rotation. Jackie got worked on by Theron&apos;s&quot;second in command&quot;Omelia while Theron kept piling weights on the guys&apos; bench press. I admit I like the free weights more in some ways than the machines, but I understand them less. I felt good being able to do everything he put me up to. Cardio was on our own after that (and a large part of our cardio that evening became trying to capture Sarah and keep her in her bed).  Measurements are coming up Wednesday and we are a bit uneasy.

 Wed 11/2
Measurements tonight!  I think we were pretty happy to see some changes, even if it was not as much as we may have hoped. We have to remember that we are building muscles too. While other team members were measured it was back to the cardio, with the treadmill challenge looming overhead. Theron finished out our evening punishing our cores for the sins of halloween. I was quite happy that I had no cramps this time. 


Sat 10/22
We wanted Sarah to attend the Pumpkin Splash, as she loves the pools! The dome is up and she had a blast. She loved the little squishy pumpkins and watching the pinata get smashed. It was a great time for all three of us and we are looking forward to many more days in the dome.

Mon 10/24
Back to the grind again! I think we have both gotten to the point now where we are excited about what Theron is going to throw at us each time. Everything builds on what we have done before and things that seem the same are different in subtle ways. We were surprised to see Theron was injured but it didn&apos;t keep him from putting the pressure on us! Another great workout.

Tues 10/25
I succumbed to peer pressure from Jackie and Jen to do Zumba. It really is a good workout (even if you can&apos;t keep up or do the moves right). It helps when she dimmed the lights to decrease embarrassment. The instructor was pretty intense but at least she didn&apos;t pull me up front to show off my moves. I was definately sweatin in the end!

Wed 10/26
We knew we would have TRX today and I suspected it would be TRX bootcamp. I was correct. I think we ran ourselves ragged on that field. But I love bootcamp and I love each level Theron adds to push us further. I really like the TRX too (although I might not have said so in the moment). There is talk now of the next challenge being on the treadmill and I am scared as I can&apos;t do that. I would rather run the Marine Corps marathon than run on a treadmill. Guess we will find out.

Thurs 10/27
Nutrition!  The nutrition classes now feel like the training to me. Each class builds on the knowledge and skills from the previous ones. I also feel like there is much more talk now, even between teams. We share and care and want to help eachother. It great to hear the little shortcuts and secrets that work for others. I am still struggling with sodium and it is really hard to avoid it!  Jackie struggles with keeping her eating on schedule, now that her days are less structured. We are on top of it though and making progress!

I have very mixed feelings about tonight. It is great to know we are half way through the competition and seeing the improvements in our health and our bodies. At the same time I&apos;m very sad knowing we only have 6 weeks left as a team and with Nicole. I&apos;ve really enjoyed getting to know everyone. It was great getting measured and knowing my body has gotten smaller especially when the scale isn&apos;t always as kind. My husband did awesome and I&apos;m so proud of him (I do find it hard to not compare my weight loss with his. It is frustrating losing weight with a man). Nonetheless a loss is a loss. Now it&apos;s time to focus on the next 6 weeks.

Well we&apos;ve made it half way through the program. And tonight we were able to see the results of our hard work. When you look in the mirror every day you don&apos;t see the gradual changes that your body is going through. But when the scale and the measuring tape come out the numbers say it all. Lisa, Anna, I couldn&apos;t be happier! Taking our bodies to the point where we didn&apos;t think we could go any further... and then going further, paid off. We are so optimistic for the next 6 weeks to see how our bodies will turn out. 

After measurements we hit the field for speed exercises and ended with some core training (gotta love core training!). 
When we got home Lisa made chicken fajita pizzas. They were fantastic and at only around 550 calories, you can&apos;t beat them.

Week 6 weigh in was tonight. Wow, am I glad that&apos;s over with! I am okay with my results. Obviously I wouldn&apos;t have complained if they were more, but I know I gave it my 100% so I can&apos;t be too disappointed with myself. Tonight&apos;s workout was a bust for me as I have been fighting a migraine all day. I&apos;ll have to make up for it tomorrow night. Megan was happy with her results as well. I&apos;m very proud of her for sticking to this and making often difficult decisions. For 11 she&apos;s showing maturity beyond her years, and I often have to remind myself that she is just 11 years old. Now to press on to the next challenge!

Today was weigh and measurement day. We will have to wait till we hear back the results. No matter what we both know that we did our best. We are trying not to let the scale guide us but using how we feel to let us know that we are doing the right thing.  After the measurements, Theron took us down to the field to give us a workout on our core. We think the comment he made about making our ab muscles burn for the weekend will hold true. We are already starting to feel some of the aches and pains of it.

Henry went to the gym straight from work and did cardio. He first tried his hand at the treadmill working on his 5k skills and then the Precor. It is a good thing he didn&apos;t come home first because he would have been stuck in the same situation as me - taking care of sick kids and not being able to exercise. So Tuesday had to become my day of rest, which means I need to get there every day this week. The past 6 weeks have really been rough for me and the kiddies cycling through two rounds of illnesses. One important component of weight loss is rest and Henry and I don&apos;t get hardly any of that. I think we&apos;re lucky if we get a solid two hours a night. Here&apos;s hoping after this week everyone can get and stay healthy.

Got an early start at the gym tonight which was nice. Megan missed out on the mile run yesterday so I had her run it, and of course I couldn&apos;t let her run it alone. I think I had to prove to myself in some way that I really could do it. As exhausting as it is, it&apos;s empowering. After that Megan and I did some weights and floor work but didn&apos;t spend too much time as tomorrow night is Nicole and I wanted to not overdo it. Tomorrow is also our first weigh in and I&apos;m crazy nervous, although I feel much better now knowing that there is not an elimination. That took a huge weight off my shoulders.

One interesting development of this competition is my daughter. Megan loves to cook, specifically baked goods. Her career choice, even at the age of 11, for several years has been a baker making cakes like those seen on TV. Tonight as we were driving past Mc. Donald&apos;s she said...wouldn&apos;t it be nice if there was a fast food restaurant where everything was healthy? Even the healthy places aren&apos;t that healthy (referring to the sodium content in some of the lunch meat at Subway). I know what I&apos;m going to do, she said. I&apos;m going to be a chef who makes healthy fast foods and healthy cakes that still taste good.&quot;

Sometimes I think Nicole lays awake at night thinking of ways to torture us. Well, tonight was no different. We walk in and it&apos;s&quot;get on the treadmill and run a mile and see how fast you can go&quot;. Then off to the circuit weights to fire up the arms. And if that weren&apos;t enough, I then hear,&quot;jump on the rowing machines and see if you can go 1,000 meters in 5 minutes. Everyone did whatever Nicole asked (maybe with a little back talk), but we did it. The boys finished the mile first very close to one another and the girls all finished close together as well. The important thing is that we never gave up.

 Jeric&apos;s 26 th blog week #6. Well we were wondering if Nicole could top the last few weeks. And boy did she! Week 6 off with a bang. We started the training session with a 1 mile run on the treadmills. And I mean run, as fast as we could. I actually surprised myself by finishing in just over 9 minutes. I didn&apos;t think I would be able to do much else after that. Nicole had other ideas. She had us do a 15 minute core circuit (I&apos;m finally doing better with the plank). We then completed a 20 minute upper body circuit and ended the session with a 1000 kilometer row on the rowing machines.

It was nice getting in early. When we got home we were able to eat dinner together and get the kids in bed at a decent hour. Looking forward to tomorrow and that &apos;good sore&apos; feeling.

Went to the gym early to get back in time to take Jake out Trick or Treating. This was the first year in awhile I did not have to buy more candy because I ate the candy we bought before Halloween came around. Set my limit to 2 small pieces and that was it. Jake came home with a giant bag full. He will probably save it till Christmas. At the gym we tried to jog on the treadmill and then went to the bike. Happy Halloween

Theron had tried to contact us today to see if we could come in around 5 tonight since it was Halloween. Naturally it was one of the first times I forgot to check my email so I didn’t get it until after 5. He said we could still come in that it was no problem but everyone else on my team was there at 5. This left me and Steve to work out alone with Theron. He had us do some cardio first and then we did some weight training. We both increased our weights so that made us feel good. We then did crunches, leg lifts and planks. He said that Wednesday was the first big weigh in and I know the scale doesn’t always show the improvements that you want but the inches sure does. So this weigh in should help give us a big boost to show that we are really improving.

I RAN a mile...nuff said.

Seriously though, I have NEVER been able to run a mile in my entire life. And when Nicole told us we were going to run a mile I thought she was crazy. I thought there was absolutely no humanly way possible I could run a mile. Nicole obviously had more faith in me than I had in myself. Even though I finished last out of my group, I finished, and I ran (okay, sometimes jogged but did NOT walk) the whole way.
Now the temptation challenge...the kids have tons of Halloween candy. Seriously I&apos;m not very tempted by it. I had my one piece per kid as a fee for sorting it...a roll of Smarties, a mini York Peppermint patty, a tiny box of Nerds, and a mini Heath bar...that is all I will be having. Now I just have to find a way to get it away from the kids! They are not nearly as strong minded as I am! Of course, they are kids though!

Had a busy weekend, but got to the gym on Sunday. George likes the treadmill and went on to the bike. I tested my knee on the treadmill for 25min. and then bike and elliptical trainer.  We are going to the gym early to get out for trick or treating Monday.

George got a late start to exercise because he had to wait for friends to pick up Jake for Cub Scouts. George was feeling tired because he has to get up at 4:30 in the morning, but made it to the nutrition class. We are making Turkey Meatball subs to take to a party Sat. for us to eat that a fellow teammate made.

We ended up taking Friday off as our day of rest. We braved our little snow storm and went to the gym on Saturday and then again on Sunday. Our main focus right now is cardio and training for our 5K. Both days we had to go to the gym separately again because of our sick little ones. It seems we are on round two of the fall colds already. I am having a hard time being at the top of my game from being sick again too with another sinus infection and an earache on top of that. I am refusing to let it get me down, but wondering if not taking time off to rest is making things worse. I guess there will be time to rest in another six weeks :) After my workout on Sunday I decided to do some relaxation in the hot tub to ease up on the sore muscles. I am trying to talk Henry into doing the same because his back has been bothering him from running on the treadmill. I really think our knees and backs take a beating from running - that is why I am so thankful for the opportunity to work out at the gym and use lower impact equipment like the elliptical and the arc trainer. I always wanted an elliptical at home, but didn&apos;t want to shell out the thousands of dollars for a nice one only to let it collect dust. Everyone knows it is almost impossible to workout at home. There are too many distractions and excuses to keep from exercising. I am a little nervous and excited at the same time for Wednesday night so we can what progress we have made over the last six weeks.

P.S. The chicken and long grain brown rice soup with kale was such a hit, I made another batch today. It is nice to have with a side of a yum yum muffin. So far we have made the muffins with devil&apos;s food cake, triple chocolate fudge cake, spice cake and carrot cake. I think the spice cake has become the favorite. The kids absolutely love the muffins and I have to keep them on hand.

We tried to run on the treadmill before the Nutrition class. I am able to attempt a slow jog with my knee . The nutrition class is always informative , and we get recipes from the class and other teammates. The spice muffins are to die for. Even though they&apos;re not chocolate, they were a treat for the family. George finally got in the system for his food diary because they had the wrong spelling for Schroeder . Our food diary is not perfect eating, but we made great strides in many areas. It still is hard when Burger King is 5 seconds from our house but now I look at them as the fat place. Jake still asks to go, but he is over it quickly .

We were back on the inside field for core training. We did different circuits after the TRX which George liked but I need a few times to catch on. George had a problem with getting dizzy after the running circuits . Not eating was not smart , I should say not eating enough before he got there and side effects of medicine take their toll. Nicole came to the rescue with o.j. and a warning not to do that to her again.

Well week 5 ended a little different. SNOW! We live near the Pennsylvania line and we ended up with about 2 inches of snow (definitely not your end of October weather). Thankfully Emily&apos;s soccer game was canceled due to the weather so we were able to hit the gym around noon. We got a good workout in and were back home for a relaxing evening.

For dinner Lisa prepared a Purdue roaster (it&apos;s hard to beat em) along with baked potato , salad, corn and steamed okra. It was a nice warm meal on a cold night. 

 Can&apos;t wait to see what Nicole has in store for us on Monday. We are also looking forward to Wednesday and seeing how our hard work has paid off so far.

We actually went to a farmer’s market in this yucky weather to purchase fresh vegetables and fruits. I couldn’t believe how much I could get that was grown locally. We then went to the club to work out trying out the tread mill. We both have a lot of work ahead of us if we want to even be a contender in the 5K challenge. When we came home, I made the chicken and brown rice soup that Alicia gave out after the nutrition class. I did modify it a bit because we do not like kale. I also used Herb Ox sodium free chicken broth. Using that it reduced the sodium greatly. I also added Mccormick’s Italian seasoning since we did not use regular chicken broth. Instead of the kale we used escarole.  We really like the escarole because that is what is used in real homemade Italian wedding soup.

We had to miss the gym tonight, Anna had a soccer game. After the sun went down it got a little chilly. Hard to believe they&apos;re calling for snow this weekend, it is only October isn&apos;t it? We plan on getting into the gym tomorrow after Emily&apos;s soccer game for a good end of the week workout. Hopefully we can beat the weather.

Friday. Most people really look forward to Fridays. I kind of do, but it&apos;s not necessarily the relief that others feel. Yes, there&apos;s no work for the weekend, but typically this means trying to catch up on housework, kids&apos; school work, and juggling other responsibilities. I got the opportunity to hit the gym by myself today. It was nice that I didn&apos;t have to worry about dropping kids off or supervising kids on the floor. I could just do what I needed to do. I started with stretching and then attempted to run. Nicole&apos;s lunges are doing me in! My muscles are soooo tight. I wish I knew a magic way to increase flexibility. I&apos;ve struggled with that my whole life starting when I was very little. The doctor wanted special shoes to correct a hip issue I was born with, but my parents didn&apos;t have the money for that. I think that&apos;s caused a lot of my back and leg problems ever since. Anyway, I did not get the amount of running in that Nicole suggested, but I did my best and am trying to set mini goals to get better each time I try. I then did some weights on the weight side. This is also a birthday weekend for my 8 turning 9 year old Matthew. We went out to dinner tonight to celebrate because the weekend is busy and his birthday is Monday (a gym night and Halloween). It was nice to see the kids making healthier choices, and I think I did pretty well too with barbeque chicken (ate 1/2 of it), grilled zucchini, spaghetti squash and a huge salad (with a tiny bit of low-fat ranch). I couldn&apos;t even finish my dinner!

With the weekend weather being questionable the first thing I thought about was how I was going to get to the gym if it was snowing! Wow, what a different change of thought over a few months ago! Of course shoveling is a great workout, and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll get my chance in the months to come.

It was a typical Thursday night, get to the gym early for our workout and then meet up with Alecia for our nutritional class. What was not typical is the workouts we need to do now. We have two weeks to prep for a 5K. Talk about a&quot;crash course&quot;. The hardest part about doing a 5K on a treadmill is  finding your pace. It is much easier on the open road. I am hoping having everyone around me running at the same time will help keep me going. I feel like being short is a disadvantage because my strides are very small. Keeping up with Henry&apos;s fast pace just walking across a parking lot is always a challenge. We just found out that Henry won the first bike challenge. I am so proud of the accomplishment he made. He is the oldest person in the competition and proved you can do anything at any age. I was between Mark and Lisa on the bikes who came in 2nd and 3rd. My team did awesome and I am proud of everyone for finishing the 30 minutes. Before the competition I&apos;m not sure if anyone coule have handled this challenge. Way to go Fit4Lifers!

Alecia met with us and went over the myths of fad dieting and what works and what doesn&apos;t work with weight loss. One thing I love about Thursday night is that it gives us the opportunity to meet with everyone and get new recipe ideas and grocery staples people are finding with low sodium, low calores, low fat, etc. Everyone is very open to sharing, which is nice considering it is a competition. I have challenged myself to experimenting with new recipes every week. My family never knows what is in store for them. Last night&apos;s dinner was a chicken and brown rice soup with kale. On the side was a&quot;Yum Yum&quot;muffin made with spice cake mix and a can of pumpkin. The kids asked me if I was making something else for them and the answer was&quot;No. You will eat it or go to bed hungry&quot;. It did not go over well, but all of them ate the soup (eventually). The rule was you could not eat your muffin until you finished your soup. This was the first time any of us have eaten Kale. Henry and I thought the soup was tasty. My picky 20 month old son who doesn&apos;t eat anything ate two bowls. My picky nine year old son ate the soup with no problem as well. The 3 1/2 year old twin girls gave us a fit about the kale. I did compromise by taking some of the kale out of their soup, but not all of it. It was a successful meal and super easy to make. This competition has been nothing but postive for the whole family and I&apos;m looking forward to the many years of a healthy lifestyle.

Jeric&apos;s 23rd blog, week 5. Thanks to Lisa&apos;s mom watching the girls for us Lisa and I were able to get to the gym early tonight. We decided to hit the treadmill for a change and still had time to get our strength circuit in as well. Alicia&apos;s class was informative as usual. Most of the families were swapping recipes before and after the meeting. It&apos;s nice to get knew ideas and some twists on old ones.

Well last night&apos;s workout definitely stuck with me throughout today, but I mostly felt it this evening when I made an attempt to run. The ultimate goal is to run a 5K, or 3.1 miles. Right now I can do maybe 1/4 of a mile without stopping...pretty sad. But I figure I have to start somewhere, so that&apos;s my goal for the next 3 weeks. I&apos;m going to run and do weights and run some more. Tonight was our nutrition class where we talked about fad diets and components of what we eat and how they work with our bodies, for example fats, carbohydrates, proteins, etc. I know many of us have tried many fad diets. I&apos;ve tried low-carb, low calorie,&quot;miracle lose 10 lbs in a weekend diets&quot;, even the cabbage soup diet. I might have lost some weight temporarily, but as soon as I started eating&quot;normally&quot;it came back on, usually with an extra 5 or 10 lbs. I do feel a little deprived at this point. I have found myself smelling things and craving things I don&apos;t normally crave, but if I have an emergency snack nearby that usually passes.
As usual the weekend has some scheduling difficulties, but I&apos;m sure it will all work out.

We went early to work out before the nutrition class. We really have to work hard in order to improve our time on the treadmill. The nutrition class was good. We got a lot of useful information about basic nutrition on what our bodies need to survive. Going over some fad diets Alicia talked about were very familiar especially since I have done every diet known to man. I did do the one thing that didn’t make some of these diets work is that I never exercised. I did reduce my caloric intake but eventually hit a plateau and then gave up. Like most people, I then gained the weight I lost plus some. We both really needed someone to help teach us how to balance eating with exercise. This program is really the best and we are greatly appreciated that we were selected for it.

Every time I workout with Nicole I leave thinking the same thing....&quot;That was the hardest workout I&apos;ve ever done.&quot;Tonight was no different! We started off with TRX, lunges,&quot;burpies&quot;, and jumping squats. After that it was on to another circuit of sprinting, push ups, more burpies, medicine ball exercises, lunges and hammer curls. I never knew this body could be this exhausted! I keep saying Wow....that&apos;s all I can say. I can&apos;t even put words to it. Next week is the first weigh-in. I&apos;m nervous about it, but realize that everyone loses differently. I think for me I might show more results in the measurements, although I&apos;m unsure. I find my clothes fitting slightly differently, which is encouraging. I think I might have to go shopping by the time this is all over with!

Today the red team worked hard. We first did some boot camp activities which were just the warm ups according to Theron. Then he had us doing TRX. That really wasn’t too bad but both of us were having some trouble getting some of the moves. But, hey, that was the first time ever doing it. Steve and I are definitely seeing improvements in the activities. We both seem to do more every time we try. The red team is really great at cheering everyone on so that we all seem to step up and try even harder.

Another great training night with Nicole. We can tell that we are getting stronger with each week that passes. Last night I made the Yum Yum Muffins that Alicia gave us a recipe for and Anna and Mark thought they were awesome. They both thought that it was a great treat to think they were eating so bad when they really weren&apos;t. We will be making these again for sure. It sure is great to see everyone making gains and completing every challenge Nicole throws our way. Next week marks the halfway point. We can&apos;t wait to see how our hard work has paid off thus far.

 The end of another week today.  My group continues to excel and&quot;make mama proud&quot;as I say!  With the bike challenge behind us it&apos;s on to the next challenge ahead... The 5k is in three weeks.  My team has 2 full weeks to truly prep for this and I have prepared them to is point with the physical challenges.  A lot of work will go into the next 2 weeks to make sure we come out on top again.  I was so thrilled to see 6 of the top 10 bikers were for my team.  They train so hard with or without me.  Truly, at any given time of day and there is a team member working hard on their own.  I feel blessed to be around such deserving hard working people. That&apos;s what it takes-- dedication and hard work!  6 week measurements are on Wednesday and I am really looking forward to putting my scale- watching girls at ease when they see the inches lost from all this hard work!

Tonight was hardcore (just like every Monday and Wednesday night). We started on TRX. That is not an easy task. It takes a lot of core and upper body strength to do it right. Of course Nicole&apos;s demonstration of the moves make it look so easy. I&apos;m not a big fan of TRX. It just doesn&apos;t feel natural. Next we were on the field doing various circuits with sprinting, the body push ups, weights and this crazy move called&quot;the easter egg&quot;. Who comes up with this stuff? It was a great workout overall and our team is lucky to have such a versatile and knowledgeable trainer. So much to look forward to...measurements on Wednesday and the 5k in two and a half weeks. Never a dull moment. Go team Nicole!

Well it&apos;s Tuesday and to give the little ones a break, Henry went to the gym straight from work and o went later in the evening. He mostly worked on the treadmill trying to see how much conditioning he needs to get ready for our next fitness challenge. I tried CRX Works for the first time and then a Zumba class. Probably not too smart the night after and the night before training with Nicole. I had trouble sleeping again because of sore muscles and I am sick again. That&apos;s the downside of putting the little ones in daycare - they bring the germs home and share.
We&apos;re sure wondering what&apos;s in store for us Wednesday. Nicole gave us a whole list of equipment to bring to the field. Stay posted...

Not a lot going on today. Did Zumba tonight with Megan and was pleased to see others from Fit4Life there as well. Way to go everyone! My original goal was to get some weights in, but figured we have Nicole tomorrow and thought it might be best to take it easy today as she will surely kill us tomorrow. I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s week 5 already. Megan said today that she was kind of sad that it was already week 5 because she still feels like she has so far to go. I reminded her that these 12 weeks are just the first step to a lifelong journey. I guess it&apos;s hard to understand that when you&apos;re 11 though!

A big happy moment for me was finding a bowl at Target that is made for microwaving popcorn without oil. Dump in the kernals, microwave and done. I found mega-low sodium kettle corn sprinkles for it, and it&apos;s been a great treat! I also made a variation of the chocolate pumpkin muffins tonight to go with dinner using spice cake mix and pumpkin. Very yummy, and the leftovers will make a good lunch box addition as well. It&apos;s not an every-day kind of treat, but it&apos;s nice to have something like that every once in a while!

Had a good night with Nicole and the team.  We did strength training with weights and machines. It&apos;s a big effort to get there but we feel better after the workout and George says he actually enjoys it. Jake had fun with the kids and Jason . He is always ready to go but fitting in homework and dinner is still a challenge . Will be making some recipes I got tonight from our fellow teammates. I hope to take some classes on Saturday when I am not working because so far I have worked every Saturday.

Well it&apos;s Monday night already and we are starting week 5. Henry and I had date night this weekend. These nights are rare. We went to a movie and went prepared. I popped some of the simply salted popcorn and pulled out my big purse. I packed a little snack bag for each of us with 1/4 cup of walnuts and 2 tablespoons of chocolate chips. It was so tough not to have movie theater popcorn and snowcaps especially since we got a coupon for a free small popcorn. I really has to battle with myself for&quot;free&quot;versus&quot;healthy&quot;. Anyone who knows me knows I&apos;m a couponers and love freebies. Our health won out.

Tonight was a workout on the weight floor. We broke up in two groups of four and did a circuit of 4 exercises and then swapped routines with the other group. Afterwards we worked our arms (hard) and then over to the blue mats for some core work. Our bodies get a great workout but the muscle recovery is getting easier each day.

We always look forward to our nights with Nicole because we know when we are leaving that our bodies have gotten a great workout. Tonight we did a different circuit than we normally do and we know my triceps will be burning tomorrow every time  we have to pick up something. Anna was off to a soccer game and won. One more week of soccer and Anna will be joining us every night. Overall the training part is great, Lisa still has a hard time getting in all of her calories. She is going to try and drink more protein shakes in the morning to rev up her daily start.

Even though Theron had hurt himself over the weekend, he didn’t let up on us for the training. It ended up be a great workout. The abs workout was the best. Theron changed the workouts a little by having us do as many as we can within a time limit rather then by a set amount. We broke into teams and worked on weight training. We did quite a bit of the circuit training tonight. Both of us actually increased our weight which made us feel good because we are actually improving. On Wednesday training class we are going to work on TRX which kind of concerns us but we will give it a try as we have done with everything else.

I really look forward to Monday nights. Yesterday I took the first day off from the gym in almost 5 weeks. I even took a 2 hour nap! I made up for it tonight with Nicole though! We did weight circuits that were tough tough tough, but even tougher was the dumbbell workout. WHEW! Matthew had fun in the kid program free for all flag grab and sack races. It&apos;s nice to know he can have fun while working out. I have fun, but it&apos;s a different kind of fun, that&apos;s for sure. Megan sticks with me and does the program with Nicole. Ben does his own program with weights and some cardio. He&apos;s underweight, so we try to keep the cardio limited as he doesn&apos;t need to be burning any more calories than normal! Sure wish I could borrow his metabolism! Alecia&apos;s lessons on emotional eating has really rung true the last few days. I even made the comment that I was glad there were no snacks in the break room today as I was pretty sure I would have given in to temptation! There wasn&apos;t though. I do feel as though I&apos;ve been a little too liberal with eating over the weekend with Subway, Bob Evans and Chipolte. Even though I made the best choices I could, I feel better when I am in control over the exact measurements. I hate guestimating amounts and calorie counts.

Megan&apos;s doing great packing her own lunch for school too. I&apos;m super proud of her!

 

 Wecome to Week 4 Fit4Life Families!
 We are all so amazed at the progress you&apos;re making

We just came back from a 5 mile walk on the trail at the conowingo damn on Sunday. Very relaxing day walking by the water with all the eagles in flight. The trail was great for my knee with no major hills just a lot of walking . I love to walk , but running or jogging is not my thing even before my knee problems. I forgot to add from Friday night at Dodgeball after the gym closed we went down to the indoor field to watch Jake. They were serving pizza and soda and it looked very tempting, but we avoided it. George asked if they had hummus and pita bread. just kidding , but we did not eat the pizza. That was a change for us because with our old habits, we probably would have had a couple slices each.

Well it is definitely taking much longer to grocery shop. We are actually reading every label and comparing products for the one with the lowest sodium and calories. We used to just pick up things and throw them into our shopping cart without any regards to the health content of the item. We also were checking into lunch meats because Steve likes that for lunch. When we noticed the sodium content, we decided to bake an oven stuffer roaster for lunch instead. I am trying a new pork chop recipe and hopefully it will taste good. We started off strong with trying new recipes but the second and third week new ones were horrible. Hopefully this week will be better. We also went to the Ma and Pa trail to walk with our dogs. We hadn’t been able to do that for some time because of the weight. We went a mile and our dogs enjoyed every minute of it.

Well week 4 has come and gone. It&apos;s hard to believe we are 1/3 of the way through the program. Between Nicole&apos;s challenging workout&apos;s and Alicia&apos;s great nutrition tips we&apos;ve gained so much knowledge that I know it will carry with us for the rest of our lives. Our team has bonded so well that it&apos;s hard to believe that 4 weeks ago we were all strangers. 
After the kids&apos; soccer games Lisa and I were able to drop the kids off at her mom&apos;s and we headed off to the gym for a great end of the week strength/ cardio workout. It&apos;s funny to see the gym attendance on a mid  Saturday afternoon compared to a Monday night. It was like a ghost town in there.
 Mg&apos;s . of sodium per 1/2 cup. They rocked!
We are looking forward to Monday to see what Nicole has in store for us.

Well both Steve and I felt that we are getting better each week. We went to the club today and worked on three machines based on the work out sheets that Theron gave us. We are up to level 3 for the bike and still on level one for all of the other equipment. We are actually enjoying this time together and working hard at it.

Yesterday the kids had off from school, so I was hoping to get to the gym early in the day. Unfortunately I had to do grocery shopping first. While I&apos;m feeling more confident in what I buy I am finding it frustrating at how expensive healthy eating is! I know it balances out because we are not eating out, but my grocery budget has almost doubled! Oh well, we should be stocked up for awhile. I did make it to the gym around 5pm. It was strangely quiet. I guess a lot of people go out on Friday nights. I did some cardio and floor work that I wasn&apos;t able to get to the other night (more planks). This morning Megan and I got up for an early Aqua Zumba class now that the dome is up. I liked it better when it was in the rec pool though. This was my first experience under the dome, and it didn&apos;t feel closed in at all, like I was afraid it would. Tomorrow is my day off and if it&apos;s nice I told the kids we&apos;d go to the Ma and Pa trail and maybe Annie&apos;s Playground. The weather is getting cooler so there&apos;s going to be a lot less opportunity to get outside, so we better take advantage of it! I hope everyone has a great weekend!

We got to exercise Friday night while Jake went to Dodgeball night. George and I were the only ones in the gym at 9o&apos;clock and when they made the announcement they were closed , George was still walking away on the treadmill with his earphones on. It was a fun night having the gym to yourself. It was great to hear we won&apos;t be eliminated yet.. We are winning only because it is a challenge somedays to even get to the gym but we always make it. I have to say I&apos;m glad George is doing so well considering his health problems. He is strong mentally and physically considering what he has been through.

We both hit the gym today separately. Both of us worked out for about an hour and a half. We felt like we got a great workout. Henry did straight cardio and I finished up the rest of my weight routine I didn&apos;t get to finish on Thursday night and then an hour of cardio. It is hard to believe week 4 is coming to a close already. (A third of the way through the competition).

I used to make excuses why I couldn&apos;t get to exercise. Exercise has become one of the most important things in our lives now. The house isn&apos;t spotless and the laundry may not get put away, but we have a roof over our heads and the clothes are clean. I&apos;ve made peace with the fact I can&apos;t have it all. Our health is more than a clean home and I feel our priorities are in the right order now. What good is a clean house if you aren&apos;t around to enjoy it? No more excuses!

Tonight we had a delicious spaghetti squash. First time ever and definitely a keeper. We enjoyed
it with turkey meatballs and a salad.

We went to the gym yesterday and are all very sore. We are all very excited about Monday and
ready to take on Nicole&apos;s next workout. I&apos;m very proud of how hard we are working out and
pushing ourselves to do more than we used to do.

 We have 2 soccer games on Saturday morning but plan to hit the gym in the early afternoon for a
good cardio /strength workout.

JEN: I&apos;m still working off the adrenaline high from the bike challenge, and I&apos;m physically feeling really good today. I&apos;m thinking I may start setting some goals for biking and track my progress. I really enjoyed that challenge, and apparently I&apos;m more driven by competition than I realized. I am so glad that The Arena Club decided to keep all 8 families through the entire competition instead of eliminating 2 of them. Every single family is giving this competition everything they have, and I wouldn&apos;t want to think that we could have possibly been eliminated so soon. We aren&apos;t ready yet to do this on our own, and while the habits are forming and we&apos;re changing how we eat and approach fitness, I&apos;m really glad to know that we&apos;ve got more time. 

Tonight we had nutrition class and it was about emotional eating, aka the story of my life! It is really helpful every now and then to sit down and evaluate what triggers me to eat. Having been through a really challenging year for our family last year, I know that my weight was like a yo-yo and that I just ate whatever made me feel good. I&apos;m past that now, but its good to remember so that it never happens again. Honestly, the way I feel about myself right now, I don&apos;t ever want to go back to feeling unhealthy again. I finally get it now.

Thursday night started with our weight routine. I still don&apos;t like the hack squats. My buns are a little sore this morning, but not as bad as they were the first time I did them. When it got time to run the stairs, Mary, Meghan and I ran them together. It is always better to have some company to make the task a little less daunting. The weights are Henry&apos;s place to shine. I think he enjoys this more than cardio. Although he does have great endurance on cardio too.
 After our workout, we had our nutrition class where we talked about the importance of vitamins for our bodies and which foods contains which vitamins. We&apos;ve really been sticking to our food logs. I&apos;m getting frustrated not getting the results I had hoped for. Henry is losing some weight and I can&apos;t seem to get the scale to budge. We have measurements in two weeks so I hope for some results there. I&apos;ve made Alicia&apos;s berry muffins and the yum yum muffins. They were both very yummy. We will keep plugging away at this and do the best we can.

Monday was a tense day, as we were both scared and excited to watch the other team embark on their half of the fitness challenge. They were sure pedaling fast!! Monday night was also the first time that we got to do a real weight circuit, one where we set the weights and did some REAL work. The ladies got to do a circuit of their own (and I am so sure it was just as hard). It was another great workout but I think we were looking ahead to our turn on the bikes...

Tuesday 10/18
We made sure to hit the gym Tuesday to keep up our practicing with the bikes. We are competing against ourselves here so we need to pull out all the stops. It was not an easy workout but it was a good one and we really pushed ourselves. I dont know for sure that I can really remember what I would have thought of this before the competition began but 4 weeks in, it sure feels a lot easier to do this sort of physical effort. We are getting ready for tomorrow but it is very nerve-wracking thinking about that 30 minute ride.

Wednesday 10/19 
This was it, our turn at the challenge! Before it was our time though, we wanted to get into one of Theron&apos;s TRX demos. I think everyone in our team has been interested to see what its like and this was no walk in the park. It was a fun experience too, working with the straps and puling against our bodyweight. We didn&apos;t want to push it too hard though, as we had the main event coming up. 
That 30 minutes was one of the most intense I can remember in a long time. I really dont think I could have done anything like that before. I think we did well, pushing hard as the time ran out. In the end though, I have to remember that I probably could not have even rode a bike that long before now. Certainly not at that level. I was proud of myself and Jackie. We put a lot of effort in that, we all did. (I will be honest though I was really glad it was over). Our time with Theron was not over though and we pushed on to get in some upper body and core work. Finishing out with stretching was nice too. And I was able to make it through with only one cramp this time!! (Its a big achievement to me.)

Thursday 10/20
It&apos;s Thursday, that means its time to talk about food!! We always look forward to our nutrition lecture. Tonight&apos;s topic was one I have been waiting for: emotional eating. I know its something our family has struggled with and its a big problem for the entire country. It was good to hear the lecture and the information the families share. There is always a good deal of learning on all sides. Since we started this, there have been moments of weakness, moments when we were tested, and there have also been many moments of triumph. I take pride that in those moments I can usually pick up something that, while it is not the best thing for me to eat, it is a lot better than the things I am used to getting and I think a lot more about what I put into my body. I think the lectures have helped me see the value of my food and what I need to get out of it. 
After the lecture we got a nice set of cardio work in, I am glad to be off the bikes and trying out different equipment again. The sheets Theron gave us are great guides to exploring machines and testing our strength out on each one.

Got a late start tonight but we made it to the nutrition class. Always get good tips but it is still hard to change old habits, but we have made quite a lot of changes. I have made a effort to get dinner together before I go to work so its ready when we get home to eat. Have to get more organized at the grocery store so I can get out of there before an hour goes by.  Hoping to find some great recipes that are tasty and low in fat. I will keep searching. We were happy we made it through Wednesday night.  It was challenging but it was fun to change it up. The only thing I dread is the stairs. Oh well, it&apos;s time to sign off . Jake is looking forward to Dodgeball night Friday and we hope to get our exercise in tomorrow on our own. The Schroeder&apos;s

We ended week 4&apos;s scheduled session with our nutrition class. Alicia is a world of knowledge, no matter what anyone brings up she always presents alot of information. I am getting the hang of achieving my daily calorie goals while keeping my sodium intake below 2300. Lisa has come along way with her eating (especially breakfast) but is still struggling to attain her daily calories goal. Anna is also doing well, and seems to have little trouble getting all of her daily nutrients and attaining her calorie goal.  It&apos;s nice to see all of us choosing the healthier foods and snacks rather than the &apos;junk&apos;. We continue to experiment with different recipes to keep everyone from growing stale with eating the same things.

Tonight’s nutrition class was good. Barbara is very much an emotional eater but has improved that problem. Exercising has taken some of the edge off. Steve is usually on his own so he doesn’t have to worry about his work place bringing in tons of junk food. He is tempted at times with donuts but he has great will power. Barb’s employees have been a great support because they are keeping all of the junk food out of my sight. Out of sight out of mind. Steve and I both have great support from our team members. I guess because we are all in this together.

Thursday night&apos;s nutrition class was informative as always. Tonight we talked about nutritional supplements and emotional eating. I can say I definitely related to the emotional eating. In today&apos;s culture almost everything we do revolves around food. Every celebration and holiday has a huge emphasis on food. It&apos;s hard to get away from that. I have a lot of past baggage regarding food as well. I grew up where you ate what you were told to eat because food was not wasted. My mom was a single mom, and while she did the best she could, fresh vegetables and healthy foods were not necessarily in the budget. Now as a mom I have to make the same choice. Do I get the box of sugary cereal that&apos;s on sale for $1.99 or the box of organic cereal for $3.99. It all adds up! I think one of the reasons why American&apos;s are so fat is because the unhealthy food is cheaper than the healthy food.

My personal goals for this week is to take a day off (still debating as to when that will be) and to majorly increase my water intake.
One of the best things about this whole process is that not only are we getting healthier and losing weight (albeit very slowly right now), but the kids and I are making friendships that I hope will continue past this competition.

 The bike challenge went way better than I expected last night. I was somewhat concerned because I wasn&apos;t able to get to the gym on Tuesday night to warm up for it, and I had stuff to get done at the house. I&apos;ve been focusing my workouts on other areas like weight training and pilates. Still, I&apos;m in this to win, so I gave it my all.

I have to say that the red team is THE BEST at motivating each other. Franklin was keeping me pacing and we all kept each other focused and moving. Theron was great at advising us when to step it up without being in our faces about it. That&apos;s perfect for me since I&apos;m pretty internally motivated - I don&apos;t need a lot of pushing just someone to be that voice in my head.

I am amazed at the distance I was able to achieve. I think that I not only surprised my team, but I surprised myself. Feeling very proud of myself today for giving it my best. 

 

Day 3 of Week 4 continued with a Bike Challenge with Theron&apos;s team. Who will be the winner????

 

 

While the Red Team Biked it, Nicole took her team down on the field for an intense workout

Every night is new. That&apos;s what I love about this process. I think if it was just the same exercises day after day, or the same classes over and over again then I would not have made it this far. Tonight we were on the field, doing things I had never done before, or even dreamed of doing. I got to pair up with Kim, and she was amazingly motivating as well! I&apos;ve been a bit discouraged about results lately as the pounds are not coming off, but you know what? I PLANKED FOR 60 SECONDS! A month ago I couldn&apos;t even do 10 seconds! That has to count for something! Nutrition wise we&apos;re doing pretty well. Tonight we did breakfast for dinner and had multi-grain pumpkin pancakes...they were amazingly good! It&apos;s good to know that we can still enjoy our food. It&apos;s not all salads, rice cakes and bland food. We can eat foods that taste good and are good for us!

Tonight&apos;s workout started out on the indoor field for a round of intense cardio/strength training. Within about 30 minutes we hit just about every muscle group. Lisa and I partnered up for the workout. The first station was jogging around the field with a kettle ball. I&apos;ll tell you jogging around while holding a kettle ball at your chest doesn&apos;t sound too hard but try it for about 5 minutes, it will catch up to you. Next we completed 3 sets of 20 reps. with the rope which got our shoulders fired up (and Nicole adding some push ups in the mix was a nice kicker). After that we took turns pushing the blocking sled across the field. That was challenging enough until Nicole decided she wanted a ride and had me push the sled with her on it! The last station was a rope pull which was attached to a sled with about 100 pounds on it (my back is still feeling that one). After that we broke into 2 teams. While one team relayed a medicine ball up and down the field the other team held the plank position. Then the teams switched. I continue to struggle with the plank however I am getting better.

There is always a little feeling of anxiousness when you know your going to be hitting the field with Nicole because you never know what&apos;s in store for you. Well tonight was brutal. I could deal with all the activities but whipping the ropes and then doing push ups between sets. Mary and I were partners and had the ropes as our first task. I think it spent most of our energy. I also ended up with&quot;turf burns&quot; on my elbows from planking on the field.
Nicole made the boys push her around on her chariot. I may have to get one for our house and have Henry push me around. Henry enjoyed trying new exercises. It was another night where the whole team gave it 110%. We have proven we want this bad and we are not quitters.

Well the Red team had their bike challenge today and it pushed everyone to their limits. I think the team as a whole did well. Everyone should pat themselves on their back. If on the first day of class someone told me that on Week 4 I would be able to ride a bike for 30 minutes and go over 5 miles, I would have laughed at them. But yet I did it and so did Steve beating his own record. We are both very proud of ourselves.

Tonight I hosted a Network to End Cancer Zumba&quot;thon&quot;@ The Columbia Gym in Columbia, Md. the turnout was great. You can see the fun pics and cool video on my facebook page. There were at least 75 people that showed up to support this great cause. I belong and work part time to an charity called Marathon of Miracles and was our first fitness fund-raiser. We decided to do a Zumba class because it&apos;s all the rage right now and this being  Breast Cancer Awareness Month what a better way to get out there and raise awareness through education and exercise but by having an event such as this. it was also special because we recognized all the survivors in the room before we began the class by giving thim pink gift wrapped beauty supply items along with a gift certificate to a local restaurant. Even more special was that my Aunt O&apos;Melia ( a four year survivor) was among that group of women. The Zumba class lasted three hours with Zumba teachers from all across the Baltimore-Metro area doing 10 minutes a piece with small breaks every 30 min. I did about a solid hour myself but Auntie was out there for the full three hours....AMAZING!!! Raised awareness and some money (which is always nice) and then it was off to work for me and off to the hot bath for Aunt O&apos;Melia. While the class was in session Domonick was downstairs at the gym playing basketball.

I attempted to start my week off with a hefty work out. Decided to take a class with Adam @ the club--- It&apos;s called S.M.A.C.K Down...Boy oh boy, I wasn&apos;t ready for that. It&apos;s a combination of Step, Cardio and Kickboxing. Honestly, I only lasted 30 minutes (couldn&apos;t sustain the full hour) but looking forward to taking this class again. Domonick and I utilized the pool over the weekend. Aunt O&apos;melia continued with her classes as well--she took Zuma and R.E.V.

For our work out with Theron, we returned back to the outside for warm ups. This time it was a little more intense with the walking lunges and step-up/step-down aerobic like motion on the curb to work the calf muscles. Afterwards we went inside to do an hour of cardio. Theron gave us a cardio work out sheet expected to help up with our upcoming challenge.

Today I went to the gym to get a head start for tomorrow&apos;s bike challenge. Head start meaning getting a nice warm up in and getting my legs geared up for what is to come on tomorrow. The gym wasn&apos;t so packed because of the weather but I did see some fellow team mates--Barbara, Steven,&amp;Jackie. They were all there getting ready for an exciting day on the bikes....hahahaha. I couldn&apos;t get any info out of Theron (Mr. Poker Face) on how the other team was doing but he encouraged me to maintain control, endurance, and focus. I did about 40 minutes on the bike and went quite a distance (6.45 miles to be exact), burned some calories and got a nice workout on the legs.

Well I went downstairs to get an updated schedule of classes and who did I run into but Nicole (the other Team leader/trainer). Why did I have to run into her??? LOL....Well, she was giving TRX demos session down there and heckled me into coming in. We have these playful jaunts whenever we see each other and it&apos;s great--- she&apos;s GREAT!!! I am always trying to spy on her and her team to see what they are up to because I am so darned competitive. Anyway, our TRX demo was really cool. Nicole made it look so easy but it truly wasn&apos;t for us that aren&apos;t used to using ropes with or without exercise. Playing with gravity while exercising should be fun. With that said, I am looking forward to taking TRX classes with her or Theron in the upcoming week.

BIKE CHALLENGE (insert Happy FACE)

We did it!!! And you know what? It wasn&apos;t so bad. I think we could have rode another 30 min (well I could have anyway). I was so proud of the Red Team especially Barbara and Jackie. Barbara because she struggles the most but pushes herself against all odds and Jackie because she had just had an asthma attack an hour before the challenge and against what some suggested of her not pushing herself to do the challenge, she did anyway. I am so proud of all of us----really...We work hard as a team and when we have to pull together for things such as this, we really do support one another. I think eating all the bananas that I did this week helped also. I asked my Aunt how she think she did? She said she wished she could have gone a longer distance but content because she endured the full 30 minutes without stopping. You may have heard her as she&quot;coached&quot;Domonick through this challenge. I think she may have though she was on an episode of&quot;Biggest Loser.&quot;lol

At the end, Theron was very proud of us and expressed it whole-heatedly. I hope we won as a team. At the end of the evening, we did a little stretching, planking, sit ups, push ups and small lunges. 

Got home and ate a nice chicken gumbo casserole prepared by O&apos;Melia and she put her baking skills to work and made some low fat Pumpkin Muffins for desert.

Off to work for me...Kinda dreading tonight because I really want to curl up and go to sleep.

Tuesday night was a Zumba class for Kim. Henry stayed on the floor doing his weight training routine. Afterwards we met up with Nicole for a TRX demo. Boy it looks easier than it is. It takes a lot of strength and balance to master it. We looked clumsy and Nicole made it looked easy. I can&apos;t imagine 45 minutes of this class.
Looking forward to Wednesday night. We are going on the field. I can only imagine what is in store for the team.

 I have to say I just absolutely love my team. They are ALWAYS here working hard with and without me which is so exciting. Habits are being made and with that comes change. I know they want It.  
Tonight I taught TRX demonstrations open to all members. It was a treat having Mary, Henry, Kim and even Frankin from Theron&apos;s team in there!
I am so happy Jayne is doing so well despite her knee discomfort.  It seems to be at bay for now which is great. George is also kicking butt sticking with it and trying so hard. He is the master of the plank I&apos;m tellin ya!
Henry and Kim are a powerhouse team. Those two are in that gym pushing each other to stay on target and I love that. Henry was resisting the calorie increase (he was eating too few) but I learned tonight he is still losing weight with the proper calorie intake which is excellent. Hang in there Kim... Proof is in the pudding girl you are losing inches!
Mary and Meghan have been such a great team. Mom working out with her daughter... Phew that&apos;s a task in itself... but these two get it going. Mary learned this week that rest is so crucial so I&apos;m looking forward to her having a day off and reporting how much her body appreciated it. She is such a strong trooper and I love hearing everyone else encourage her through this because she is one heck of a strong woman.
Something special... Mark and Lisa share the same wedding anniversary as my husband and I. They celebrated 13 years together peddling away on a bike Monday night! What was so cool was that I&apos;m sure they would have rather been a million other places but they have shown a commitment by being there. I love the positivity of those two! Lisa works so hard and pushes it no matter what and the same with Mark (although Lisa says he makes it look easy).
So far 4 weeks in they are doing amazing. I am ready for more progress!!!!

We went to the club today and worked out on the elliptical and bike using the workout sheets that Theron had given us. We were able to go to level two on the bike. We followed this up with weight training using the equipment that Theron had shown us. It was a really good workout. Steve and I encouraged each other to keep going even when we felt tired.

I&apos;m definitely feeling the effects of yesterday&apos;s workout. Tonight was some cardio and then I tried out TRX with Nicole. It was tough, but a different kind of workout which was really fun. I also was able to do it with a few members of my team and someone from Theron&apos;s team, which made it much less intimidating! I feel frustrated because my body and will power do not match! There are so many things my mind WANTS me to do but my body doesn&apos;t want to cooperate. I look forward to when my body is no longer an obstacle for me. I was able to wear a pair of pants today that I couldn&apos;t four weeks ago. I see small changes, but I want big. I have to remind myself that it&apos;s only week 4. I am excited to know that I&apos;m going to be further than this when week 12 comes around!

 

Wecome to Week 4 Fit4Life Families! 
Day 1 of Week 4 started with a Bike Challenge with Nicole&apos;s team. Tomorrow night the rest of the families take on the bike. Who will the winner be?

JEN: Tonight was the first night our team wore our red shirts all together at our workout with Theron. On the one hand, it did somewhat draw attention, and I did feel like people were watching me or something. I wondered for a while maybe if I looked like a rookie or something. Then I overheard someone talking with my teammate Jackie asking how it was going and to keep up the great work, and I realized that even though its a competition, everyone wants to see us succeed on the journey.

We did mostly work on the free weights and resistance training - some of that was tough! Even if you start with a weight that seems ok, by the second or third set, its near impossible. The other team did their bike challenge and ours is on Wednesday, so I’m planning to do some more practice on the bike again tomorrow night. I’m not sure if it matters if I win or even place, but I do want to feel like I’m proud of how I did.

JEN: I have to say that I impressed myself and my friends by diligently getting myself to the gym on Saturday morning after, ahem, a late night out. I didn’t want to miss Alicia’s Saturday pilates class! Actually, I was still recovering from Theron’s boot camp on Wednesday for the rest of the week, so I wasn’t even sure my core was ready to do pilates, but I felt better by Saturday and actually did better than the last class. I think pilates takes a few weeks to really get the muscles built up, but then once they do, its even a somewhat relaxing workout for me. Best part was, as of Saturday night, I could fit into my“skinny”jeans that I haven’t worn in years, and finally the scale has started moving down again .

JEN: I wouldn’t really call it“cheating”on the diet, but I feel like tonight was an example of how once in a while treating yourself is ok. Just not every day. I went out for a girls night and we had a very nice dinner and drinks. I had a seafood pasta dish with white wine - not too heavy and it was good, but there was no way I could finish it all! Proceeded to burn off those extra calories dancing with my friends to a band. Unconventional exercise achieved.

 That was the longest bike ride to nowhere. I&apos;m so proud of all my teammates for doing so well. Everyone really gave it 110%. We have such a great group of people on our team and we are looking forward to the next eight weeks. Nicole took us down to the field afterwards to work on our core strength.
This weekend we were faced with our own nutritional challenge. We were at a fundraiser for a little boy with brain cancer. They had ice cream, cotton candy, cookies, candy, and brownies. We went prepared and ate lunch before we went and took snacks with us. Afterwards we went to a friend&apos;s house to watch the football game. They had beer, chips and dip and pizza. We ordered grilled chicken salads and I brought my own low fat dressing. We have found out that it is all about preparation. We succeeded on that challenge and it feels good.

Week 4 started off with our first challenge, it was the bike challenge.After 30 minutes on the bikes we went on the field to stretch it out.This was not as hard as we thought it would be but it was still a good work out.Jayne was happy that her knee did not give out. Actually, we do not feel as tired as usual and we have more to look forward to like getting in shape instead of just taking a nap. Things do change. The Schroeder&apos;s ps. the yum yum brownie muffins were yum yum for this chocoholic.

Week 4 started off with the first challenge of the program. WOW! what a challenge. As a team we all did great! It was nice to see that no one gave up, or for that matter, no one even really slowed from the pace they had started from. After the challenge we weren&apos;t done we went down to the field for some core training. This is definitely my weak point, and I am looking forward to changing that by the end of this program.

We did weight training tonight with Theron. We both felt that we used weights at a higher level then we thought and we both felt that the class went by a quickly. He showed us more weight equipment to make sure that we could use them correctly. He provided us with weight training guide broken down by male and female which help us to determine what machines to use and how many reps that are needed.

Tonight was our first challenge. I can honestly say I did my 100% best. I didn&apos;t come in first, or second or probably even third, but I did my best, and that&apos;s all I can ask of myself. After our challenge we went and did core workout. I was really disappointed with myself when I dropped doing a plank and the whole team had to start over. I really wish I could master those planks...After the workout my teammates and I shared some recipe ideas and just chatted. With my husband gone that is something that I really miss...adult interaction and feeling like I&apos;m working with someone instead of alone. My kids are a great support, but they are still kids and cannot, and should not, take the place of adult interaction. I also got fussed at for not taking a break. I know my body needs the break but my mind just has a hard time admitting to that. My goal is to take a day off from the gym this week, as strange as that sounds.
I tried a recipe tonight that someone on my team shared...chicken breast, salsa and black beans cooked in the crock pot all day. It was amazingly delicious! Unfortunately my kids wouldn&apos;t eat it, but they had spaghetti with tofu in the sauce (they&apos;re old enough to not be fooled into thinking it&apos;s cheese).
Tomorrow I&apos;m trying out the TRX sample class with Nicole. I find her so amazingly motivating.
Megan did amazingly well on the challenge to. I&apos;m very proud of her! I&apos;m proud of all my kids!

Wednesday 10/12
Tonight was another bootcamp night! On the indoor field, we took on another great challenge. No flipping tires this time but we got to use the tension bands and really pushed ourselves. Personally, I love bootcamp days as I feel like I really got run over. Theron pushes us on the others days too but I know I worked out after bootcamp - I can barely walk out to the car. This time I pushed myself a bit too hard and ended up with an abdominal cramp. Theron really helped me handle it and make it stop. I have had these in the past and didn&apos;t know how to react or help them. Jackie said this evening was the first time she really broke a sweat in the competition. She must have really pushed herself as well. I think we both look forward to Theron pulling out all the stops for bootcamp days and enjoy seeing what new ideas and tasks he has for us.

Thursday 10/13
Nutrition night! We finally had out diet criticized personally (due to some technical problems) and it was a lot less embarrassing than I thought. More recipes were shared and more strategies for living healthy. I am glad that there are others who struggle like I do over sodium even when eating healthy. Jackie is looking forward to making muffins from the recipe lists! After the meeting we headed to the machines, particularly the bikes. We have heard rumors that our first fitness challenge is a bicycle challenge and we want to be prepared! We tried to push ourselves and were pleasantly surprised that we could do it.

Friday 10/14
My brother was married today and we attended the wedding dinner. This was a major personal challenge for us as it is the first big&quot;food event&quot;since the program started. We were both surprised to find the words of wisdom from Alicia rang true: foods that we had been so used to eating before were very salty and greasy tasting to us. Things were overly sweet and/or oily and we did not have the same desire for them. Our stomachs were also upset, quite literally... they are not used to that sort of thing anymore and let us know!! That is actually a really good sign, that our lifestyle changes have become a part of us now and are somewhat more than just willpower.

Saturday 10/15
Our workout today was kids! Two little kid birthday parties in one day, in different parts of the state. Wrangling Sarah and friends tired all three of us out! Staying on target with our diets was not so easy in a sea of kid foods but I think we did fairly well. By the end of the day Saturday all any of us wanted was just to lay down. I felt like Theron had worked us over again. I will say though, that I have noticed it is easier to keep up with Sarah now than before and I don&apos;t get as run down through the day.

Sunday 10/16
As tired as we were Saturday, we got up Sunday with lots of energy. We made sure to get our time in at the gym but it was such a lovely day out we had to go and enjoy it outside as well! I pulled Sarah up to the local park and playground in her little red wagon and we had a lot of fun all over the equipment! I can definitely keep up with her now and I was really surprised when it came to pulling her around. I used to get winded and worn out just from walking up the street pulling her along. Today I felt like I could have taken her for blocks and blocks. It was good feeling to make it back home afterwards and not have to crash. 
Here&apos;s looking forward to tomorrow&apos;s time with Team Theron and cheering on the team going through their leg of the fitness challenge!

George is enjoying a get away camping with Jake. He will be doing a lot of walking with many hills. My oldest son actually got out of bed on his day off on Saturday and went with me to the gym.. Did the bike and treadmill and weights. Nervous about Monday because my legs have been quite sore from Wed. Hope to go to the gym tomorrow with George when he gets home. Will be trying our new receipes we got Thursday night. If anyone on the team got a chance to make anything please share how they were . Jayne

Henry and I went to the gym early this afternoon and did the strength training routine. I felt Nicole&apos;s eyes on us. I can&apos;t wait until her picture comes down :) I am not a big fan of the hack squats and Henry is hating the planks. It&apos;s amazing how slow a minute goes when you are planking. He tried to get out of his last one but I wouldn&apos;t let him get away with it.
 We tried Alicia&apos;s suggestion for adding Tofu to the spaghetti sauce and told the kids it was cheese. They raved how great the sauce was and all went back for more. Of course we stuck to our 1 cup serving. This week we focused on getting our calories up and still eating healthy. We are excited for our first fitness challenge next week!

Tonight was a time challenge. It was a crazy busy day at work, plus grocery shopping afterwards and the kids had youth group. I had exactly 1 hour and 20 minutes by the time I got to the gym before childcare closed. I did 45 minutes of cardio and then knocked out some strength training. It was tough not having the team there to cheer me on. It&apos;s amazing how much more motivated you are when you have people doing it along side with you. At first I was intimidated by all the muscular dudes working out on the weight side. I decided I didn&apos;t care, that if I didn&apos;t start somewhere then I&apos;d never get to where I want to be. I just focused and did my best. This weekend is going to be busy too, and it&apos;s going to take some juggling of time to get everything in, but I&apos;m not giving myself the option to not go. I know once I make the excuse to not go then it will be easier the next time to make an excuse.

I&apos;m really proud of my kids because they&apos;re really starting to get focused on what&apos;s okay to eat. I&apos;m less strict with my oldest who needs to put weight on. I&apos;m finding my second boy to be a very emotional eater (strange for a boy, I know). I&apos;m seeing that he eats out of boredom a lot. Zachary is learning healthier options as well, and was quite happy to eat some of the trail mix from the recipe we got on Thursday night. Megan, my only daughter, make sure I log everything she&apos;s eaten, and is really trying to stay on track. Great job family!

It&apos;s Friday night and the Jeric&apos;s ended the week at the gym. Lisa and I completed the strength training workout then hit cardio for an all out workout. Anna decided to take another Zumba class. It&apos;s great to see Anna take the initiative on her own. We are all looking forward to Monday&apos;s challenge to see how everyone is progressing in the program.

We went to exercise today and worked off the exercise workout sheet that Theron had given to us. We both managed to do at least two complete pieces of equipment and tried the third one. The Precor is very difficult to use. We know that that will be one of the pieces that we will have to work on. We think if we tried that piece first we might have been able to last. We still had a good workout.

Henry and I made sure we went up early to get our cardio in before meeting with Alicia. We are having a hard time sleeping at night because we are working out so late in the day. I&apos;m also having a hard time sleeping from being so sore from Wednesday night&apos;s workout. I can feel I worked out different muscle groups because the muscles that are sore this week aren&apos;t the same ones that were sore last week. At least I know my body will adjust and get used to training the various muscle groups.
 The nutrition class was great. Alicia shared some of her recipes with us. It is nice to get recipes someone has already made and likes. I&apos;m testing out different recipes from my clean eating cookbook. So far I made a roasted butternut squash soup and a pumpkin hummus. They were not a hit. It&apos;s hard spending the time and money on food and have it not turn out very well. I plan on trying at least one new recipe a week. I did make grilled pork chops with a low sodium soy and honey sauce that turned out well. I look forward to trying some of Alicia&apos;s recipes. I&apos;m glad Henry isn&apos;t a picky eater and will try my experiments :)

Tonight Jayne and I both did the weight circuit.Jayne is still stiff from wednesday but she worked through it . She was dissapointed on the step challenge from Wednesday but will do better in the coming weeks. Even with an unforseen problem at home , we still felt we could not give up on Wednesday and did our best to get to the gym even though our minds were somewhere else. It&apos;s great to have a tee shirt to wear to show our dedication for the program. Everybody on our team gives all they have to be successfull. The SCHROEDER&apos;S

Tonight was a nutritional night and a little bit of cardio . Anna, Mark and I went in early to get a little cardio work in before class. The nutrition class gave some more insight on what we should and should not be putting into our bodies. The three of us really like the logging part of our food. It really helps you to stay focused on the things that we are putting in our mouth. This is something we will stick with even after the 12 weeks are up.

 Nutrition class was interesting today. We received some new recipes that we are going to probably try. Alicia had changed all of our calories to be more specific to us. I have been on every diet out there and she made a good comment regarding the scale. Steve and I try not to weigh ourselves more then once a week because if we do and we don’t get the results that we expect we will fall off the wagon. Another comment that was made that also is very true is that the weight and bad habits did not occur overnight. So losing the weight and learning new habits will also not happen overnight. No one should give up because of this. You may not see the results in the scale but you could be losing inches and building up muscles. I know that Steve and I are feeling better and I have lost some weight so eating properly and exercising is working.

I have to admit that I&apos;m insanely tired and cranky tonight. Tonight&apos;s workout was more cardio and then our nutrition class where we talked more about making healthy choices. I feel like I&apos;m in a rut food wise...sticking to certain things because it&apos;s easiest. I want to start experimenting more, especially with baking, as well as finding healthy alternatives from some of the foods my family loves, especially the kids as they&apos;re feeling a bit deprived in some ways. I feel like all I say is no these days when it comes to food, and I really would like to be able to say yes to some things. It&apos;s also been a busy work week for me, and I&apos;m feeling pressure from the home-front as well. It really does effect everything, including my ability to focus on workouts. This is an emotional journey to wellness as well, as if you don&apos;t get your mind right then when the 12 weeks is over it would be very easy to snap back into old habits.

Thursday-
Michael reporting live from inside my life.. Today we are learning new recipes in Nutrition class. Hopefully some drinks and breakfast items will be included, because I am so used to having soda each day, and I need that start in the morning. Also some pasta recipes, I&apos;ve always loved pasta. I would also like to know how to improve my foods for the week, get more calories in, as I am coming under what I need to. Well, I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll get the answer later!

Michael here again, reporting from his second boot camp! Still as fun as the first, I honestly wish I had it every week. My favorite part was the elastic walking, where we walked while held back with an elastic band. I came home sore today, first time directly after a workout that I actually was ready to go home and sleep. Usually, I feel excess energy I need to run off! Definately feeling really good after this, I can&apos;t wait for the next!

Tuesday-
Michael here, and I had an interesting work out today. My mom and I went to Zumba, but I think we got in over our heads. So many different movements caused me to be confused. But I touched it out, and had alot of fun doing it. Definately something that gets better the more you do it, but I was shocked at how few guys there were. At the end, I found out our teacher was Cal Ripken&apos;s wife. Although I&apos;m personally a football guy, I thought that was really cool.

Steve and I were extremely tired after Wednesday’s class. We both are proud of ourselves because we at least were able to do all of the stations this time. We may not be really quick but we did do everything. We really are starting to feel better and our clothes are fitting better. We feel good about eating healthy as well and we are trying new foods that we would have never tried before. I am also looking for more recipes and am keeping a binder with the recipes we found that are really good. I think Steve and I have mastered our sodium content this week much better then the week before but we are still having some issues with the fat content. The website keeps saying that we do not have enough fat to digest the fat soluble vitamins. We will be trying to figure that one out this week so that I can get us on a balanced diet.

Wow! The&quot;Buns of Steel&quot;exercise videos have nothing on Nicole. My buns are definitely sore this morning along with my knees and the backs of my legs. I was shocked I was able to do the stairs 10 times. That was a task that seemed impossible 3 weeks ago. The boys were working on their routine on their own and really encouraging one another to do their best. I couldn&apos;t ask for a better group of families to have on our team.

 I really feel our family&apos;s lives changing for the better. We are branching out as far as eating. The kids were eating fish the other night. Last night I grilled pork chops with a simple honey soy basting sauce and the kids loved it. Typically pork chops aren&apos;t a normal meal for us. I&apos;ve been making sure we have the food scale and the measuring cups at the table to weigh and measure everything. I&apos;ve finally learned to eat plain non fat greek yogurt. I add a little honey and cut up strawberries and mix it all up. It feels awesome to have so many positive changes. I can&apos;t wait to see what our bodies are going to look like after 12 weeks.

Tonight was time for the girls to get into the strength training action. I was very proud of how well Anna did on the machines considering this was her first workout ever on weights. She tore everyone up on the stairs.  Ahh to be young again. It felt good to do some strength work and hopefully tomorrow I won&apos;t regret saying that. I am surprised at the changes I can see in my family in just three short weeks. Mark and the other guys did their second strength workout with cardio mixed in. It is so great to have all of us as a family sharing this experience. Our car ride home is always full of chatter about what we just did.

Mary: Wow, great workout with Nicole. We got our weight training routines tonight. I&apos;m hoping the added weight training will help my body realize that it&apos;s supposed to be losing weight. Nutrition wise I think we&apos;re doing better. I made a dinner tonight that everyone ate, which felt great. I usually end up making the kids one thing and then myself something else. Tonight I did a stir fry with zucchini, carrots, onion and crumbled turkey burger and then added some leftover brown rice, a tiny bit of soy sauce, pineapple juice and honey. YUM! I even found another vegetable my picky daughter would eat!
Megan: I&apos;m tired and achy. I do gym in school every day too. I think I might not be eating enough because I don&apos;t have enough energy to get through the day. Tomorrow I&apos;m going to try to have a bigger breakfast.

Since we have three little sick kids we broke up our gym time. Henry went after work and I went when he got home. I really won on this deal because dinner was waiting for me when I got home. We ate flounder, green beans and a sweet potato. I&apos;ve never liked fish so this was a stretch for me. We both love working out at The Arena Club. It is giving us energy to keep up with the kids. I used to have to go to Starbucks to get through my day. Now I don&apos;t even crave it anymore . I&apos;ve finally broken that addiction. This will be saving the family money.
 Wednesday night is the night for the girls to get our weight training routine. I can only imagine how sore I will be. Henry was a little sore after doing hack squats. He is excited that he may finally be growing a butt :) Our bodies have really been adjusting well and we both are feeling good overall. We are feeling stronger and pushing ourselves a little more each day. This competition has been such a blessing to our family.

Nutrition with Alicia is starting a little slow for us because neither my Aunt nor I had began the input portion of our meal programs onto the food blog website. We didn&apos;t get started until this weekend and we are playing&quot;catch up.&quot;

We are very much interested and concerned about our health so we are taking the nutrition class very serious. Some may have noticed that Domonick (my cousin) was a bit overwhelmed during last Wednesday&apos;s nutrition class. He was just getting out of the hospital the day before and adjusting to everything around him. We are excited to have him back and his dedication to the program is of utmost importance to my Aunt and me but moreover him. Thanks  for everyone&apos;s patience and understanding during the class.

Last night&apos;s dinner consisted of:
Bakes Talapia
Brussel Sprouts
Brown Rice
Diet Turkey Hill Farms Iced Tea

Tonight was a quieter night. It&apos;s our slower night. The older kids did free swim while I did my cardio. My knees have been bothering me the last few days, but with some medicine in my system and putting my legs in the hot tub I&apos;m feeling better. I have to say that going to the gym is starting to be a lot easier for our family. There&apos;s a switch that happens mentally for me when I start feeling like I have to exercise...I crave it and look forward to it. I have to admit that I did not feel that the past three weeks! Going to the gym was a matter of will power before. I willed myself there, even though I didn&apos;t necessarily want to be there. Now, after just a few short weeks, I feel energized coming home. I look forward to it, and will make just about any accommodation I need to in order to get exercise in. I&apos;m also looking for other opportunities throughout the day to get just a bit more in, whether it&apos;s carrying laundry baskets upstairs or going for a walk during my lunch break. Now that the mental barrier has broken, I hope my body will soon follow! I&apos;m sure Nicole is more than happy to help my physical body&quot;break&quot;, in a good way of course!

I finally had a day off on a day that was not a scheduled training day, so Lisa and I hit the gym early. I was a little sore from an awesome strength workout yesterday, but after about 10 minutes on the bike everything seemed to loosen up. Lisa said that she wasn&apos;t sore from the Zumba class last night. We ended up completing an hour of cardio between the bike, Precor , and the eliptical . Again it was nice to get it done early and have the rest of the day to spend together. Anna had gym in school today. She said they played tennis for about 45 minutes. She also said she wasn&apos;t sore from the Zumba class. It&apos; amazes me to see the change in my family in just 2 short weeks. I look forward to seeing us at the end of week 12.

I spent some time chasing Sarah around the house and playing hide and seek with her (believe me, she makes it an extreme sport). This gave JAckie a chance to participate in another Zumba class. She is really enjoying that particular class and is always totally worn out afterwards. IT is rewarding to her though and that is what counts. We are all looking forward to the dome going up so that we can get Sarah back out there and so we can all participate in an aquatic fitness night. Looking forward to either bootcamp or TRX tomorrow with Theron!

Another night starting outsde! At least it was nice out today. I think we are getting&quot;into our groove&quot;as a team now (go team Theron!) and seems like we work as a bit of a unit as we all run our drills. The giant tire was a nice twist though and I think people enjoyed fliping it over. It had a very satisfying THUD. Oh well, I enjoyed it. After our outside capers we went in and were introduced to a new system Theron would like us to use for our cardio routines on the machines. It is always nice to add little bits of structure to our workout routine that we can use every time we come, to make our workouts mroe meaningful. Theron is getting us pumped up for the first big fitness challenge! I thin kteam Theron will blow that one out of the park. We were all hapy to get shirts as well but we were kinda hoping for big letters that said&quot;Team Theron!&quot;

It&apos;s hard to believe we are in week 3 already. Monday night the girls took a Zumba class while Nicole beat up on the boys. She laid out a weight training routine for them to follow. Henry enjoyed his workout. I&apos;m not too sure he was so fond of the stairs. Wednesday will be the girls turn to get pumped up. I can&apos;t wait!

Boy, Theron knows how to work us hard. Steve and I were extremely tired when we came home. I think it is one of the harder workouts he put us through. Both Steve and I felt that it was a good workout and that we both are feeling like we are improving every week. I have also looked at the websites that Alicia had given us for recipe ideas and found a couple of good ones. The one we made for dinner tonight was fettuccine alfredo from eatingwell.com. I did substitute some lower sodium products then what was in the recipe and was able to lower the sodium content. Both Steve and I loved it. Tonight I am going to try a barbeque chicken that I found. I can’t believe that I can find healthy things to substitute with a little planning and still eat some of the foods we liked. I can’t believe that it is week three and Steve and I still are enjoying the entire program and still feel like we can win this.

 JEN: We had an exhausting workout last night with Theron. We were mostly outside doing relays, up-downs, lunges, and cardio. That is, until the tractor tire came out and we had to work in teams to flip it. That thing was heavy! I couldn’t have done it without a partner and am feeling it in my muscles today definitely.

Keeping up with the food log personally isn’t a big issue for me but its a challenge for Michael. We all are eating better than we used to and getting more exercise. I’m seeing lots of positive changes.

What a workout! Nicole split up the men and ladies. The men performed a strength training workout. We performed a series of super sets which targeted every muscle group, and ended with some &quot;running of the stairs&quot;. I was amazed at the fact that in about 40 minutes I was able to hit all of my muscle groups to the point of failure. I&apos;m looking forward to that familiar &apos;good sore&apos; tomorrow.

 The ladies went down to participate in a Zumba class. Lisa and Anna told me afterward that they had a lot of fun even though they had a little trouble with some of the steps. They told me it was a great cardio workout.

Tonight starts a new week for us. It also marks the third week since my family has eaten out, and my 3rd week straight of making my health a priority by getting myself to the gym. Today started off with me teaching a high school gym class (I&apos;m a substitute teacher, one of the TOUGHEST jobs on Earth LOL). I actually enjoyed it as one of the classes was Wellness Walking, a class that goes away from the traditional gym class of flag football and relay races and focuses on healthy walking. I actually logged over 2 miles with the students in one class.
If anyone was like me growing up then they HATED gym class. I was the kid who was put on the team, never chosen. I was a bit overweight growing up, the slowest runner, and usually the first to strike out or get tagged out. I grew up dreading gym class, and my lifestyle has been impacted by that. As soon as my gym credits in school were done, that was it. I was not putting another foot in a gym. It was not seen as a positive place at all. Of course this was over 20 years ago, and I&apos;m happy to say that it has changed for many students and there are definitely more options out there.

I have to say the Arena Club is very motivating. You see people of all ages, sizes and abilities all doing their best. Sure there are those who have bodies I would dream of having, but I haven&apos;t experienced any negativity from my time there. I always feel good about myself when I walk out.
Group fitness classes are a great way to give yourself more options. Tonight Team Nicole&apos;s ladies did Zumba together. It was much more fun doing it with folks I knew, even though I still missed many of the steps and probably looked quite silly. It was a good workout. The guys gave us a glimpse of what is to come on Wednesday...oh man.

Other than that we&apos;re plugging away. The routine of getting to the gym is a bit less stressful than last week.

 

 Wecome to Week 3 Fit4Life Families! 
Keep up the good work!

Wednesday was the first time I saw improvement in my body in terms of  endurance and stamina.

Domonick, Aunt O&apos;Melia, and I worked together as a team to complete Theron&apos;s 60 minute Weights/Cycle Circuit Challenge.

Domonick says I am his inspiration....no he is really mine. I watched him lift 45-50lb weights as easy it is for me to type on my blackberry. O&apos;Melia is always up for any challenge and keeps pushing herself to the next level. I do give myself credit today in that I was able to run on the treadmill for the first time in 2years...that felt great!!!

One solid hour of:
Squats
Lifts (Chest&amp;Shoulder)
Rowing
Treadmill
Jumping Jacks
Lounges (Forward and Lateral)

Monday with Theron was not so bad because my Aunt and I was at the gym consistently over weekend. Our bodies are getting use to daily exercise of some sort....Auntie attended two classes here @ The Arena Club--- Body Pump on Friday and Saturday. I stayed on the main floor working on my upper body strength.

*I am looking forward to Zumba this Friday with fellow team member Jacqueline Piercy*

We started our Monday warm-up outside (thanks Theron *side-eye*) Our outside warm-ups consisted of sqat-jumps, tag-team relay (choice of jogging, power walking, running, or skipping), and different variations of lunges. Afterwards, we headed into the gym for a revisit of weight circuit training and weight balancing along with intense body stretch.

GREAT WAY TO START THE WEEK!!! Thanks Team...Thanks Theron

Mon 10/3
Jackie says that although she enjoys stretching, it can still be painful.
Our&quot;warmup&quot;was outside on the stairs and some running/squats in the lot. It was anything but warm for us, as we came prepared with shorts on and found ourselves out in the 40degree weather. Theron made sure we werent cold for long. We enjoyed working as a team at the last part where we basically ran together. Then inside to warm up and sweat some more. More laterals (my favorite - not!) and working in a circuit. Personally, I am liking the way Theron breaks it up and I woudl not have thought if that on my own. Making sure to do about 30 second bursts of weights (or in this case tension) and then break to rest. It keeps things interesting to mix the areas and activities as well. I am always eager to take a challenge Theron puts in front of me.

Wed 10/5
Wednesday was another great curcuit workout with Theron. We tried machines we had never used before (actual weights, not just tension). Again, he kept it moving and interesting in short bursts and changing tasks. I had a great time trying to see if I could jump over the Bosu (sp?) ball and I think I did it right! The more we get used to these routines and machines, it makes it easier to jump right in when we are with Theron and to use some of them when we come to the gym on our time.

Thu 10/6
We always look forward to Alicia&apos;s nurtition classes. Today we expanded our knowledge on reading labels, as well as understanding some terminology used by advertising folks to lure people in. In some ways, the talk between groups is just as helpful as the topic of class. We always share recipies and secrets amongst eachother and people talk about their struggles with counting, logging, and eating. That discussion and back and forth is just as powerful as the knowledge we get from class. After class we logged mroe cardio time in the gym. I hate to admit how much I love the TVs over the machines. The time until daycare closes just runs past. Sarah was insistent on visiting the pools. It has been warmer lately but at night it is still cool. Well, she had her way and went out there in 50 degreee weather. She didnt stay logn though, after about 15 minutes she was shaking and ready to go! She will be sad when they close the pools to put up the dome (but I am sure being able to swim in much warmer air will make her happy again!)

Fri 10/7Jackie tried Zumba again today. She felt much more coordinated this time. I hopped on the bike for the first time since starting this project. I was pleased with what I was able to do but I definetely felt it aftterward. Jackie and I both tried to work our way through the resistance circuit as well. We wanted to get in some musclebuilding. Jackie says she can see our muscles&quot;beefing up&quot;!  I hope she is right.  Looking forward to week 3 and what Theron will throw our way. (JAckie and some others are trying to talk him into doing a dance class with us)

Sat 10/8
Had to move a lot of things around today at home. Moving furniture and running back and forth between floors. It works up a sweat but seems a bit easier than it used to. I like that feeling. Keeping up with Sarah was a chore today as well. It was bright and sunny and she was all over the place. She wanted to bike, rollerskate, and run! I think her parents better get a bit mroe fit if they want to keep up with her!

Well week 2 has come and gone. We ended it with another trip to the gym. We hit it early because Emily had a soccer game at 11:30. Lisa, Anna, and I completed an hour of cardio. After we left we commented on how it was a great jump start to our day. We felt that it really got our bodies&apos; metabolism fired up and prepared us for a busy day. After soccer we headed for a friend&apos;s birthday party, and ended the day with an awesome healthy dinner and a little quiet family time. We are taking Sunday off (even God rested on the 7th day) but we are all excitedly awaiting for what Nicole has in store for us on Monday (can&apos;t wait).

Went to exercise today and followed our chart that Nicole gave us. I am still on level 1 but my level before starting this program was a 0. Who would believe on our day off we would be exercising at the gym. 
This was a busy weekend working and eating out with friends. Tried to eat smarter , went to seafood restaurants and tried to stay on track.

We went to the club this morning to work out for about an hour.  We rode the bike for a half an hour, then did the tread mill. We are planning to go back in the morning . The workout felt good and we are now getting into the habit of working out regularly. We had been eating out 7 nights a week. We only ate out three times this week which is really good for us. We will cut it back even more next week. Before we eat out, I spent a lot of time looking through the restaurant nutrition to decide which is the best items on the menu to eat. We are really looking forward to what is in store for us next week.

Tonight took some juggling but I still got to the gym. I have to admit that it is a bit discouraging to not yet see much physical reward as far as weight goes. This isn&apos;t the Biggest Loser though, and I think it is important for people to realize that there is a huge difference between reality tv and real life. Real life means people have jobs, kids, financial considerations and other responsibilities. That is why Fit4life is so great because it&apos;s real life. With all that said I have seen some physical improvements. When I first started 5 minutes on the ARC trainer was unthinkable. Now I&apos;m finding myself losing track of time and knocking out 15 minutes without a problem (at a pretty low level still, but we are getting there). I&apos;ve also noticed my heartrate is not nearly as through the roof as it was when I first started. So while the pants still fit the same, I am encouraged be small progress. It&apos;s not all about weight either. I&apos;m making good food choices and not needing hardly any caffeine to get through the day, whereas before I was exhausted Ll the time. 
So for now I&apos;ll just have to focus on the little wins!

Megan: I really wish they had better food at school. I forgot my lunch today and even though mom brought it they didn&apos;t call me to come get it so I got stuck eating school lunch. And I don&apos;t like salad which was the only thing healthy...ugh.

 We closed out a hectic day with a trip to the gym for a cardio workout. Talk about a stress reducer. After an hour Lisa, Anna, and I walked out feeling rejuvenated.

Hubby was home from work today (Friday) so we gathered up the three little ones, after getting the oldest on the bus, and went to the gym. We were very surprised to see the parking lot so full. Henry tried the stair climber for the first time today and spent most of his time on the weight training side. I stuck to the treadmill, bike and elliptical. Looking forward to next week&apos;s training.

JEN: Had our second meeting last night with Alicia the nutritionist and I’m proud to say that I logged all my food last week. I actually like using the My Food Diary app on the iPhone, and she is right that it is really user friendly. I’ve also been logging my workouts in there just so I can see the benefits I’m realizing in exercise. One day last week, I burned about 500 calories, which is astounding to me. 

I also did a restocking run to Wegmans to replenish all the healthy food the family has gone through. I picked up an enourmous bag of broccoli florets and put them into single serve bags for the week as well as a few larger bags for the freezer. I know its more expensive to buy pre-cut and washed produce, but its worth it because now its just“grab a bag and go.”

I seem to be able to reach my calorie goals but I really don’t want to watch it that closely that it becomes obsessive. I do look every day at where I ended up with calories, sodium, cholesterol etc and the My Food Diary does make it easy to see if you did well or not. It sounded like in the nutrition class that everyone seems to be trying to achieve ideal stats every day, so maybe I’m just more laid back about our approach. I know we’re making good choices and some days here and there will have ups and downs, but I don’t really want to over-analyze it. As long as we’re seeing positive results, that’s what matters.

JEN: On Wednesday, we worked on the white weight machines. I’d say this is the first weight training where I felt physically exhausted afterwards. Doing cardio in between wears me out, which I’m sure is the purpose and I trust Theron and his training abilities to get is where we need to be.

I’m seeing my clothes fit a little better this week and am hoping to get back into the skinny pants I’ve been saving in my closet over the next few weeks. Woo hoo!

My favorite part of Wednesday’s workout though was seeing Jackson’s enthusiasm. He was truly enjoying himself tonight and having fun. Some days, he’s not as happy about doing the adult program as an 11 yr old because he wants to play like his brother is in the kids program. I’ve been encouraging him along the way because I know he will feel like he’s accomplished something that most kids don’t get to.

I am really excited Alicia gave me kudos for my food diary and diet this past week. Everything is going well for the Scott family. We are adjusting to the routine and the 4 kids love coming here. They are all waiting for the pool dome to go up.

Went to the nutrition class Thursday evening. I need to seriously get organized and start preparing meals and have time to eat them. Got some good tips from the teacher and fellow team mates . I actually admitted I do not like to cook. I think a new cookware set is in my future because when I do cook, everything sticks.  I will be bringing out the slow cooker tomorrow. In our household , we need things ready to go when we get home. I don&apos;t have time to start thinking about dinner. I like things easy and fast, takeout pizza , chinese, etc. , but that is what got us in this conditiion. This is a whole new way of life and it won&apos;t happen in a day to adjust to everything.  George likes to cook on the grill so maybe we can find some great easy receipes. One thing that made it easier are the protein shakes in the morning for everyone or the flat out wraps.. George now eats breakfast.  We will see what happens.

Tonight was our second nutrition class and I got to say that, I picked up a few tips and hints on how to get some of the nutrition in. Logging our food has been great because it really keeps us motivated to find new ways to cook and new things to cook. We were able to do a little cardio before class. We have noticed that we look forward to getting our cardio in for the week and are upset if we can&apos;t do it for a longer period of time. It has been a challenge putting our needs on a priority sheet but so far we have been able to find time in our day to give us some of the healthy love. Needless to say sometimes before Mark gets up the stairs at night to go to bed I am snoring already.

Tonight I&apos;m just plain tuckered out....After yesterday&apos;s workout I was feeling pretty sore last night and slept pretty miserably. I woke up at 4:45 and wasn&apos;t able to go back to sleep this morning. Worked today, hit the gym after work and then had the nutrition class. A lot of people are struggling with some of the same issues I have...getting picky kids to eat, finding quick and easy meals and finding the time to eat. We didn&apos;t have time to eat a proper dinner before workout and class tonight, so I had a quick Flat Out with almond butter and homemade preserves and off I went. It&apos;s definitely my standby. I think if I could just eat that for dinner every night I&apos;d be good, but unfortunately the kids aren&apos;t very fond of it. So we got home around 8:15. Megan was starving. I threw some of the approved pasta on and topped it with some cooked chicken breast (cooked the chicken with the pasta....why not), a bit of sauce and then some leftover broccoli. I also had to make lunches for tomorrow. The whole process of making dinner and lunches (as well as some other typical evening stuff) took about 45 minutes...Honestly, not too bad, AND there&apos;s plenty of pasta and chicken left for another meal.
That&apos;s the thing...this IS doable...it takes some effort and flexibility...sometimes we have to just quit complaining and do it.
I think of it this way...if one of my kids had a medical condition that necessitated a certain diet or else they would be sick, wouldn&apos;t I MAKE time for that? Wouldn&apos;t that be a priority? Well, why wait for the medical condition? By making this a priority now, I&apos;m PREVENTING life-long health problems. I keep telling my kids, get used to this because just because the competition is 12 weeks doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;re going back to the way we were...This isn&apos;t a game to us...this breaking those generational curses of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and diabetes.

We were on the field last night enjoying some refreshing brisk evening air swinging kettle bells, throwing medicine balls, flipping ropes and doing whatever our&quot;Sargent&quot;told us to do. This is a great group of people on our team. Each one is determined to win. It makes this journey a true competition. I&apos;m glad to see everyone giving it their best.

Tonight was like being on the Biggest Loser. We were whipping ropes, throwing medicine balls and Mark was even flipping tires. It was nice to get outside and exercise instead of staying in the gym. Nicole has been great working us to our potential and beyond. After Monday night&apos;s workout I was unsure of how much we were going to be able to do without feeling those sore muscles, but this workout felt good. Muscles responded well to more work. Anna was in on the action tonight and she said that she had fun with the workout. I asked her on the way home if this was like gym class and she said maybe times two and she was tired. Good job Team Nicole!

We weren&apos;t sure what to expect tonight or what we could physically handle because we woke up extremely stiff this morning. Tonight. Nicole had our team outside on the field exercising. Our first challenge was running a lap around the field. I think this was the first time in 25 years I saw George run, but he was in front of me. I like to walk , so running was a major feat for both of us. We went through different stations and liked the TRX best.  The hardest one for Jayne was the medicine ball. The hardest one for George was stepping up on the tire because his legs wore stiff from the last workout. Still looking forward to Thursday night to learn how to track our food and what to eat.

Steve: My muscles are very sore and I am exhausted. It was a great workout and it has not changed my desire to win. I am even more determined to win.

 What a night!!!!  I impromptu took my team out under the lights for a Crush.  I had them do 3 minute intervals on the outdoor field slamming ropes, using the TRX, tossing 20 lb medicine balls and even flipping a 150 lb tire.  When I say this group will do anything for me I mean ANYTHING!  I&apos;ve never seen a group of new exercisers excel this much so fast.  As I tell them every workout... I&apos;m so impressed with their drive and heart.  I have a winning group on my hands no doubt.

What an amazing workout with Nicole! Can you be exhausted and energized at the same time? I really enjoyed tonight&apos;s workout. Again I was challenged to do things I have never done before, or at least it&apos;s been a very long time since I&apos;ve done these things. It&apos;s completely different when you have someone who is so motivating and encouraging telling you not to quit and to fight! I did learn a valuable lesson about being careful about what I eat before a workout...oops! I&apos;m really enjoying my team members as well. It&apos;s such a great motivator to be along side others who are learning all of this as well. Tomorrow is the nutrition class and I have a ton of questions, especially about how to convince my children to try new foods. They did eat fish tonight, which was a huge accomplishment. I&apos;m also looking for ideas on quick meals as we seem to always be on the go or pressed for time.
Ben and Megan were on the field with me tonight. Matthew was with the other kids doing kick ball, an obstacle course and volleyball. He&apos;ll sleep well tonight.
On the way home my 2 year old said&quot;Thanks Mommy take me to gym&quot;...

BRRRRRRR...So I decided to throw in a little surprise for the team on Monday and took them outside. If only you could see the look on their faces, but they suited up and man handled our exercises outside.stairs, lunges, squat jumps, and relay race. We then finished with circuit training back inside the gym..whatever I throw at my team they are taking it like CHAMPS.GO TEAM THERON

Kim: Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch is my mantra every time I move the slightest bit. As if Monday weren&apos;t bad enough, I jumped right back on that horse on Tuesday. I went early in the morning and did 30 minutes of cardio to try and loosen up my sore muscles, followed by a soak in the hot tub. Then later that evening, I did a 60 minute Zumba class. This was my first experience with Zumba, but it was a fun workout. I am sure I was looking a little clumsy trying to move my sore body to what is supposed to be a sexy salsa. I can assure you there wasn&apos;t anything sexy about my moves. Then hubby and I met up after his workout for a dip in the hot tub. This morning is much worse than yesterday morning. We live in a four level house with so many stairs and it is killing me to get around. All the soreness is making me feel accomplished. If I wasn&apos;t sore then I would be not be benefiting from this competition. I am just wondering what is in store for the team on the next training session. I sure hope it isn&apos;t stairs again :)

Henry: I did a cardio workout, followed by strength training. I tried a new program on the bike tonight where I cycled up a mountain and then back down, repeat, repeat, repeat. My body feels good and I am enjoying my experience at The Arena Club.

Today all of the Fit4Life Team Members met with Alicia (the staff Nutritionist).

I had no idea what we (my Aunt and I) were in for. This for me is going to be the biggest challenge. Challenging because I work in the hospitality industry and I am constantly around good food and spirits. Food is a big part of my job, i.e. social networking events, wine and dinner tastings throughout the months, not to mention our upcoming fall menu change at our restaurant. That means lots of red meat, heavy soups with beef stocks, and a barrage of heavy carb and sodium laden sandwiches for lunch....Don&apos;t think I saw and almond butter or quoinoa on any recipes...lol

Am I ready to tackle this head on??? You bet. It just means I will put in extra hours at the gym and watch my portion control(s) at up and coming tastings.

Alicia was very helpful and we are excited to start our new on-line food blog and weigh ins to watch to see how much we really&quot;should be eating.&quot;

Tuesday...I did a lighter workout tonight due to being a bit sore from yesterdays workout..okay, actually maybe a lot more than a bit sore! Tomorrow is another day with Nicole. I made it through half a Zumba class tonight and just was not feeling physically well. Knowing what I have in store for tomorrow, I decided to hit the therapy pool and do some arm dumbells and then treated myself to the hot tub. The two older kids took the night off to catch up on homework...we could get much further in fitness if it wasn&apos;t for homework and laundry! Seriously though, this is teaching us that we have to make time for fitness. I have to make time to cook a good dinner, even if I do it ahead of time and we heat it up. I&apos;m also valueing my downtime much more as well.
 
A month ago our family dinners were pretty typical unhealthy American. Pizza, fast food, tacos, spaghetti, chicken nuggets and fries, toquitos...very few vegetables and high in fat and sodium. While it has been a challenge to get the kids on board I have found that simply not having these things in the house makes a huge difference. Now we have other quick choices...almond butter on Flat Outs or whole wheat waffles if we&apos;re on the go in the morning. Protein shakes or greek yogurt, apples, baby carrots, Kashi bars, etc. It&apos;s not impossible...you have to make it work.

JEN: We had a great workout yesterday with Theron. We started outside with some warm-ups. The best one was the running relay with Michael and Jack. I surprised the boys and myself by running most of the way each stretch. Michael did me no favors by running also so I could barely catch my breath. By the third stretch, I told him to walk or else! Nothing beats hearing them chant“Run Mommy Run!” I’m feeling it today of course but I have the satisfaction that I not only surprised my boys, I surprised myself. I hope by the end of the program to be able to run an entire 5K.

Tomorrow is Michael’s 15th birthday, so tonight we had our first of three birthday dinners we will celebrate during the Fit4Life program. Both Jack and Ben will also have birthdays during the next 6 weeks.

 

Nicole: Trainer&apos;s Take

My crew worked so hard tonight.  It was no easy workout and I keep telling them how much they impress me.  We ran stairs, did wall sits, inch worms, planks, endurance strength circuit and a high level cardio interval.  That&apos;s exhausting just thinking about it!  They all push to the limit and didn&apos;t quilt.  Not one of them complained or gave up.  They all have a lot in common but truly everyone has heart.  I love this!

 

 

Wecome to Week 2 Fit4Life Families! 
You did amazing your first week...now lets see what Week2 has in store for you.
Keep up the good work!

Kim: The words from a song keep running through my mind,&quot;Hurt so good, come on baby make it hurt so good.&quot; Nicole really kicked my butt (and every other part of my body) last night. I had a very restless night due to the aches and pains of my body (and my 19 month old who refuses to sleep in his own bed). I finally broke down and took some Ibuprophen in the wee hours of the morning. Even though I am in so much pain I am ready for some more. I know every muscle ache is bringing me one step closer to getting a bikini body (I really, really hope so). I feel that was an hour of my time well spent and I would have never gotten that on my own. So, thank you ma&apos;am may I have another?

Henry: What a great workout. I enjoyed the whole routine Nicole laid out and getting to use the various circuit machines. I feel the time I put into the gym on my own last week doing cardio and strength training really prepared me for the training session. I am feeling good.

I was pretty exhausted after this class. I feel like I am improving more and more but I still have a lot of work ahead of me. I am determined to get in shape and win this thing. I just need to work on my stamina. I seem to run out of breathe doing certain exercises and will work on that during the week.

Steve
I felt a little overwhelmed tonight. I am exhausted but will not give up. Barb was yelling at me today about my eating habits. I feel like I can’t determine what I need to eat throughout the day. By dinner time I still had a lot of calories to eat and said that I need to spread my food out a little more. I am going to try to do that tomorrow.

Wow! What a workout tonight was. I will think of Nicole every time I go up and down the stairs tomorrow. It was a challenge but it was a great workout. Mark and I both feel great right now. We really feel very lucky to have this opportunity to learn and strengthen ourselves. I seem to have always been weak in the upper body and I am looking forward to gaining progress each week in my strength. Mark has for the first time ever started to enjoy and look forward to our cardio workouts.

Monday, our second week and Nicole really kicked our big butts. I guess that is what is meant by the saying&quot;no pain, no gain&quot;. The steps were a killer, George said he is taking the elevator next time! lol On the serious side it was a really hard workout for both of us. George said&quot;what did we get into?&quot; On a positive note my 10 year old said&quot;Mom you don&apos;t look as fat.&quot;Looking forward to Wed. keep up the good work team.

Mary: Tonight was Nicole...I have never worked so hard in my entire life. It felt great, but it was sooo hard! We started off doing squats for 3 minutes followed by stairs for 3 minutes. If that wasn&apos;t hard enough we did these chair sit things against the wall. Next was this thing she called the inch worm, which really shocked me how hard it was. After that we did bleacher steps. The last exercise was planks. The first one down had to do two laps on the stairs...yeah, guess who that was?? I&apos;ve got to work on those planks! I&apos;m going to try and do some every day at home and hope that next time I&apos;m not the first one down. That was all just in the first 20 minutes! We then hit the weights and did a circuit train kind of thing. Last but not least was the ARC trainer. It was a hard night but I am so glad I am not doing this alone. To have my daughter by my side and my sons working hard too means so much to me. I am so incredibly proud of my family!

Megan: It was a little easier for me than the first day. I like the workouts. I feel good afterwards, like I accomplished something.

Went to exercise Sunday afternoon, followed our chart given to us by the trainer.  George likes the treadmill but did use some other equipment   , I worked out on 4 different machines for 15 min. each. To my surprise my knee is surviving and not in severe pain.  It was hard not to stop at our local dough-nut shop after Church.  This cold weather makes me want comfort food which is usually fattening. Looking forward to next week , but not sure what our trainer has in store for us.

We tried some of the new foods on the list from the nutrition counselor. The almond butter was a big hit with the family. We made the wraps with the flat bread and made some for breakfast on the go tomorrow. Hopefully this will work for George because he usually doesn&apos;t eat breakfast. bad .....   My downfall is that I do not enjoy cooking. With working all week and some weekends. putting a shopping list together with healthy foods , than going shopping is not my thing. If we knew what to eat , we would not be in this condition. We need a lot of help from the nutrition counselor. Feeling sorry for myself because I am just sitting down for the day at 10.15 p.m. long day.  That&apos;s why we are here, to learn from our mistakes and go forward with changes we can embrace in our lives for a new start.

 Matt: We spent most of the afternoon/evening running errands and visiting family.  My major &quot;workout&quot;today was chasing a 2 year old around a mall while trying to get her to stand still long enough to buy her winter clothes. Trying to stick to the things we were told by the nutritionist is definately hard when you are doing old routines in places like a mall food court but we are all trying to be better than we were, even if we are not to the level we should be. We are making progress! 

 Jackie: Today I challenged myself to a 30 minute cardio and weight circuit. I must say, I believe my body is getting used to this&quot;active&quot;lifestyle. I feel more energetic and finding myself bending a lot more without catching my breath to care for my daughter! that alone is already priceless to me. At the start of Family Fit4Life, I was struggling with Asthma attacks. It was something that had never occured in the past. Not only that I was experiencing shortness of breath, I was also struggling with the side effects of different medications to help me stabilize the asthma. It was not an easy journey. Despite this major setback, I still continued to put my walking shoes on, get out of bed, and managed to not let this debilitating disease take over my life. Theron has been such a great trainer and I am very lucky to be on his team. I am looking forward to my new fit self!

Matt: Today was my company&apos;s annual staff picnic. I wish it had been last month! Talk about temptation. I did plan ahead though and I packed a lunch. I felt a little silly but I was afraid that there would be nothing I should eat there and I was correct. If this sort of thing had come up after being a part of a healthier lifestyle for say 6 months I think I would have let myself&quot;indulge&quot;but I want to be moving in the right direction with my diet while we do the workouts as well. I was proud to be able to resist stuffing myself even though it was embarassing to me to explain why I brought food to the catered event. I did not get a chance to workout Friday. It was a long day and we were all sort of wiped out. I finally felt some soreness from the&quot;boot camp&quot;session on Wednesday and Jackie has been struggling with her asthma a bit more. We went to the store this evening to try and shop for what the nutritionist reccomended. For some items, this meant visiting sections of the store we rarely ever went in or visiting stores we dont usually try. IT was a bit of a daunting experience but I felt better about what was in our cart today than I usually do. 

Jackie: Our family went out today to grab some&quot;hot foods.&quot; Normally, our platter would be piled up with all kinds of food. Never before did it once cross my mind to review or look at the calorie card that they provide next to the food. Whatever looks good, it goes into my plate then to my stomach! However tonight, it was a different story. I paid attention to every single item I placed on my plate. I reviewed the calorie/nutrition index at least 3 times before putting the food on the plate. I started&quot;savoring&quot;my food a lot more and this helps me tremendously with my food int ake.

Today we took it easy from working out. Hey, it is Sunday! I’m still feeling the effects of Alicia’s pilates class yesterday (which was great btw!) and I know tomorrow Theron will be making us work. To keep us on track today, I cooked what is probably the healthiest dinner I’ve ever made. I made lemon garlic tilapia (if you want the recipe, let me know!), red quinoa, and broccoli. Michael and I loved the dinner, and Jack loved the fish (and I quote“of course I liked it...I’m a fish guy”) and even though he wasn’t quite sure what to make of the quinoa, he did eat half of it. Everyone had broccoli (either steamed or fresh), some with measured amounts of light dressing (instead of the bottomless dressing for a single piece of broccoli. Kids....) Ben didn’t seem to be a fan of the tilapia though, but since he tried it and did have broccoli and quinoa, I’d consider that a successful dinner in the Lewis house. 

I am already seeing a big difference in the willingness of the boys to try new foods. We don’t always like them, but we at least try them before deciding, which is huge! I’m going to try to measure out some veggies for them to pack with lunches tomorrow. I really wish the contest was longer than 12 weeks because it seems to be motivating them where in the past, it was tough to get them to eat veggies.

I’m hoping that this change in what we’re eating does more than make us thinner and healthier. I’d really like to see that removing most of the sugars, dyes, and chemicals, in addition to exercise, will improve the boys behavior and mood. I know it won’t replace good parenting, but I really think what we eat makes a difference in mood and behavior, especially kids.

Barbara: I went to the club this afternoon and feel pretty good. I rode the recumbent bike for 30 minutes on program 2 and was able to go a little over 6 miles. I also did my first shopping experience trying to purchase some of the items on Alicia’s grocery list so that we can try them. Well we found some items but couldn’t find others. I tried the whey protein powder this morning with skim milk and a banana and that was pretty good. Just reading all of the labels turned out to be a task because my husband has high blood pressure and I need to monitor the sodium content. I can’t believe what sodium is in and how much. This experience was an eye opener. 

Steve: Barb and I went to the club this afternoon and I rode the recumbent bike for 30 minutes going over 6 miles. That actually felt refreshing. I went shopping with Barb this weekend and discovered I couldn’t have everything I wanted because it just was nutritional or had too much sodium. Changing my eating habit is going to be a little more difficult then I expected especially since so many items are high in sodium. Barb told me that I had to eat 2000 calories and by lunch time still had over a 1000 calories to go. I told her that I may not reach that calorie level. She told me that I needed to try to reach it because you actually have to eat to lose weight.

 Mary: Wow, it sure was cold this morning at 8am. I know this because I was doing water Zumba! The pool felt great but you could definitely feel the temperature drop through the hour. That hot tub sure was a welcomed treat after a hard week of working out. At first I felt like the Aqua Zumba wasn&apos;t a good enough workout so I hit the bikes and was surprised to really struggle! I guess I got a better workout than I thought! I still did my 15 minutes on the bike but decided to call it a day. The rest of my workout will be scrubbing floors and doing laundry, and battling those nasty little ants! Also on the list today was cleaning out the cupboards! Two trash bags later and a box for the shelter, I feel like we&apos;re really ready to commit to the nutrition portion!

 Megan: I don&apos;t like vegetables. I&apos;m a kid, what do you expect? I feel good about the workouts though. I can already tell that some of it is getting easier. Ben, my brother, couldn&apos;t walk up the stairs today!

I admit, I had no idea what to expect for my first week of Fit4Life. Although, I found it alot more fun that I had forseen it. Weight lifting and the field work really put me to the test, after so long without work such as that. I had originally been planning to take a Class in gym where we walked for about an hour each day, but I am going to get that changed so I can weight lift instead. I also came home each night with an adrenaline rush, making it really hard to sleep. But oh well, I felt really good and for the most part not sore in the least. If this is just week one, I can&apos;t wait for the upcoming!

 Mary: I have to admit that today the soreness had me going a bit slower...getting up and down a bit slower, and even contemplating just for a moment that maybe I could skip the gym just this once. Well, I didn&apos;t, and realized after some good cardio that I actually hurt LESS after working out than before. It seemed those muscles just needed to be stretched some more! Today time was not on my side, but I did manage to try out a few of Alecia&apos;s suggestions that I found at Wegman&apos;s. The kids are pretty hard sell though. Tomorrow&apos;s major job is cleaning out the cupboards and donating it to Harford Family House, a local shelter. I told the kids that this isn&apos;t something that we&apos;re just doing for the 12 weeks and then we go back to eating fast food, frozen pizzas and junk again. This is life changes, and those other things will be very few and very far between. Not sure they liked that! But I think once they start feeling better they&apos;re going to see the benefit.

 Megan: I don&apos;t mind the exercise as much as I don&apos;t like changing what I can and can not eat. I had to eat school lunch because I forgot my lunch at home. They don&apos;t have the best choices, and it&apos;s hard to say no to chocolate milk.

Being healthy is expensive. It really isn&apos;t fair that fast food is so cheap and eating right costs more. A friend of mine pointed out that the 7-11 has a small fresh fruit cup for $2.25 but you could get two donuts for $1. We are a single parent household on a budget so this is probably a harder adjustment than exercise.

First, I had to get the team running shoes. Michael and I only have our regular sneakers that we wear every day, and since I heard that we have a 5k in our future, I figure it&apos;s better to have the right gear. Cha-Ching! But at least I had a coupon.

I also led the family&apos;s first field trip to the new Wegmans. I&apos;ve been once before but I still don&apos;t get how the store is organized. We took our time looking for items Alicia recommended, but flourless bread and almond butter just did not look all that promising to Team Lewis. Choosing our battles...at least we did get some new better cereals, protein bars, fish for dinner this week, and we will be trying quinoa. A nice surprise was running into the Piercy family at Wegmans, one of whom was sporting a very cute tu-tu. I will let you guess which one.

This isn&apos;t my first experience in the gym. I used to wander around deciding which piece of equipment to get on. I picked the treadmill and would walk for 15 - 20 minutes at a comfortable pace, then maybe take a leisurely ride on the bike, jump on the arc trainer (thought this is way too hard and would jump off after a few minutes) and then pump some iron and walk out. I just couldn&apos;t figure out why I wasn&apos;t getting results. Well, after the well laid out plan Nicole provided for us on Monday night, I feel like I can walk into the gym at any time and leave knowing I had a great workout. I am so thankful that this opportunity came up and we plan on embracing it with open arms.

This is definitely an opportunity for a family to bond. It is nice to have all family members working toward a common goal. We are both loving this gym and all the various programs it offers. We have a great team under Nicole&apos;s leadership. Everyone has really been coming together and are very supportive of one another. We couldn&apos;t ask for a better team.
 Week one is coming to a close and we are geared up for week 2. No pain - no gain!

I remember when I was a little girl and my parents tried everything to get me to eat my veggies and I refused. I even sat at the dinner table all night and outlasted their evil attempts for me to put that green icky stuff in my mouth. I was a stubborn, head strong little girl and they weren&apos;t going to win. As it turns out I was the one who lost. I am a grown woman and I am still struggling to like vegetables. The hardest part of this journey isn&apos;t going to be the exercise, but the nutrition. Over the past several years I have only grown to tolerate broccoli and green beans. There are an array of vegetables out there I have never tried and some I just down right hate. My husband on the other hand is lucky that he loves all of that stuff. We have 4 small children and all have different palates. The challenge is coming up with meal solutions that accommodate everyone without dirtying every inch of the kitchen making 6 different meals.

Alicia did a great job with her&quot;nutrition 101&quot;class. Sad but true, most of it was stuff I already knew, but just wasn&apos;t practicing it. I have oatmeal in my house, but it has been pushed to the back of the pantry behind the Special K Chocolately Delight and the Froot Loops. Oatmeal versus chocolate....hands down chocolate won and that is also the reason I had to pull out my big girl jeans again. Lean ground beef, which tends to be a little dry or a Five Guys Cheeseburger? The devil on my shoulder will pick Five Guys every time. With a lot of hard work and a lot of prayer my husband and I intend on making these changes, not only for ourselves, but for our children. I don&apos;t want my children to be faced with this hardship we are going through right now. Eating healthy needs to be the norm and fast food the once in a while and not vice versa.

God willing, the stubborness that kept me away from those vegetables all this year will be the same stubborness that is going to pull this family to the other side and win this competition.

Today was all about starting to eat healthy. I treated the boys to dinner at Applebees and told them they could order anything off the menu so long as it was (1) a weight watchers option or (2) an under 550 calories option. There were actually plenty of good choices there. I went with a chipolte chicken dish and Michael had a shrimp and pasta dish with vegetables. Most of us started with salads and I then had to compromise on the menu selection for Jack and Ben. These are kids who would have gone for a burger and fries without thinking. They got a sandwich with ham and turkey. Both had no mayo and I asked them to pick between bacon and cheese as their extra item (normally, they would have had both plus mayo.) Ben swapped his fries for a salad, but Jack didn&apos;t choose as well picking mashed potatoes. Really, I didn&apos;t want to be so tough on them, and we can really only eat out one per pay period, so I hope this helped them to start to think before they eat.

This week was an exciting week for our family. We started our family Fit4Life journey and also put our three year old twin daughters in Pre K. After the first day of Pre K the girls were so excited to tell us about their day. The highlight of their day was drawing, which they love to do. And then Emily said,&quot;Mommy, Daddy, I drew a picture of you and I drew you fat.&quot;Wow, if that didn&apos;t hit home. This was just more fuel for our fire to keep up the motivation. I knew we were fat, I just didn&apos;t know our three year olds realized it.

Tonight was the second night of training with Nicole and she kicked it up in high gear. In Henry&apos;s words,&quot;Wow, what a work out. What seemed like a short routine sure put a hurting on me.&quot;When he was done he almost threw up. I told him I was going to be bragging that he got his butt kicked by a girl. Bring your best Nicole, we are ready to take whatever challenge you throw at us. We are in it to win it so bring it girl!

Tonight was the first night with the nutritionist and we were both nervously excited. What we eat (or perhaps dont eat) is going to be a big part of this and we were hoping to learn a bit more about how it would work out. We learned a lot and had many questions answered. It was also nice to hear other families express the same concerns that we had, such as&quot;what if I eat my allotted portion and I am still hungry?&quot; We are looking forward to learning labels and some new recipies in the weks to come. Jackie got to talk with the nutritionist a bit mroe in depth about how to manage her nutrition considering the problems she someimtes has without her gall bladder.

After class, we took the opportunity to get in a quick 30 minutes of cardio on the machines while Sarah could still play with friends in the nursery. Jackie was on the (I think they are called Arc trainers) and I was on the treadmill. I hate to admit it but having a TV on the machine does help keep me going and takes my mind off of the excercise. Jackie has been struggling a lot lately with her asthma and even so, she still managess to make it through her routine. We both really want to make the most of this experience.

Well, we were on our own with exercise tonight.  We did cardio for 45min.  We are feeling sore in areas we did know we had George said.  Lifting the grocery bags was an effort at the store this afternoon for Jayne.  George said he was sore getting dressed early this morning.

We came back for more this evening because we know in the end this will be well worth it.  We met with the nutritionist after exercising tonight. We need to learn a lot about what to eat, how much and how to find time to make healthy food.  We are not a fast food family just a processed food family and enjoy going out to dinner. Our youngest son looks forward to coming to his class and tonight he had a blast in the pool.

 Barbara: After hurting my back yesterday in class, I did what Theron told me to do. I did the stretching exercises three times and felt good. He recommended that if I would go to the club to exercise that I should stick to the recumbent bike which I did. I did it for twenty five minutes. My back still felt good afterwards. I went to the nutrition class and have to admit that I am really in for some changes in my eating habits. I know I have done just about every weight loss plan there is but none of them actually explained the combination of the food groups. I just ate what they told me to and the amounts they told me to eat. I feel this nutrition class will help me learn how to do it on my own so that when I am finished with this class I can continue with the knowledge that I have received. I know that I won’t eat all of the foods that were on the suggested grocery list but I am willing to give some of them a try.  

 Steve: Before the nutrition class, I rode the bike for twenty five minutes going 5 miles using program 2. That workout felt really good. I then went to the nutrition class and realized how bad we have been eating. It will require a lot of changes on my part. I can do this but I will have to do it in moderation and gradually make the changes necessary to eat healthy for the rest of my life.

 Mary: Tonight was our first meeting with Alicia the nutrition guru. I have to say I was less overwhelmed than I thought I would be. I was afraid the acceptable food list was going to be too strict, but as she said it&apos;s more about moderation. I feel good that there are options that I can feed my kids, although they are going to have to be flexible. I stocked up on lots of Kashi bars today when I went to the grocery store, which will help for those on-the-go times when I don&apos;t get a chance to eat. I&apos;m feeling pretty sore from yesterday, but not sore enough where I couldn&apos;t still get a good workout. I&apos;m already looking forward to Monday&apos;s workout with Nicole. I am so grateful to have this opportunity. I feel like I&apos;m still soaking everything in.

Can I just say how proud I am of my fellow Fit4Lifers when I&apos;m at the gym and I see them as well! It&apos;s really encouraging to know that we&apos;re all in this together!

 Our first bootcamp was definitely a workout. We had to do one of four activities, and I liked the rope pulling best of the 4. Michael insists that climbing the steps are&quot;easy, Mom&quot;since he&apos;s up and down stairs all day at school, but that got tough for me once I picked up the pace. Jack was supposed to be taking it easy, but he is the most stubborn kid out there, and he insisted that he would do everything that the adults do, and so he did. The best part was the three of us pushing the sled. It really felt like us working together as a team.

Last night was our first session with Nicole where strength and cardio took the stage. We separated the girls and the boys so that we could have personalized training. The girls started with strength training in a circuit of four different exercises targeting different muscle groups. Legs, back, chest, and core was first then moving on to shoulders. The boys did similar exercises at a higher weight. Mark and I enjoyed the workout and the fact that we had Nicole there pushing us to do more. Tonight we are off for a night of learning nutrition and how to eat healthy.

 WOOOOO HOOOO .... I don’t think my team could have started any better way, then
completing boot camp on the second day of training. Started off with some plyometrics to
get a warm up, then got to the FUN stuff I like to call it. Sleds, battle ropes, hurdles, and
kettle bells just to name a few. Every team completed the course and also showed a good
sign of teamwork……..GREAT JOB GUYS!

 Wow!  Workout #2 was amazing! I can&apos;t believe how hard they worked and I was pleasantly
surprised in their ability and willingness to go the extra mile when It got hard.  Tonight we rocked
a lower body and upper body circuit finishing with core and flexibility.  Everyone should be good
and sore... feeling accomplished!  Good work guys!

Wednesday 9-28 was day 2 with Theron. This was more of what Matt expected out of the boot camp trainer. Running around the field and performing a course. It was challenging, fun, and definitely left its mark. We were happy to have less soreness this time and just a little tiredness. We will sleep well tonight! After the workout, our family spent some time winding down in the pool, where little Sarah has already made friends. Looking forward to the first meeting with the nutritionist tomorrow, changing those habits will be almost as hard as pushing that sled around the field!

Today Theron worked us very hard. I ended up hurting my back but he gave me some stretches that made it feel good enough for me to do some of the workout. I will have to do all the stretches everyday as he said because I am not going to let this slow me down or give up.

 Steve 
It was a good workout but I am very sore now. I am not letting Barb give up either and Theron gave me some tips to help her do her stretching. I also learned that I am do to stretching before and after the workouts.

Wow, it&apos;s hard to see yourself on video when you tried to ignore how out of shape you are. If that doesn&apos;t motivate us, we don&apos;t deserve to be here.  We definitely stepped out of our comfort zone and jumped into this really without even thinking how to juggle everything else in our lives. We need to do this and everything will need to fit around our exercise schedule. Tonight was strength training , George said he sure isn&apos;t used to bending and stretching like that . We both thought the weights were not so bad . We might have a different opinion tomorrow morning if we can&apos;t move. This will be difficult ,but we are greatfull to have this challenge. Looking forward to the nutrition class and helping us get on track with food and all the problems that comes from bad habits.  The Schroeder&apos;s

Jake said his class is fun. He did an obstacle course.

The real world is messy. My goal through this blog is to show that even when though life often gets in the way, it is critical to keep your eyes forward and not get downtroden by the day to day.

Today I am emotionally exhausted. I came home from work to find my kitchen filled with ants, the kids with bad homework grades, laundry piled up and little time for dinner. All I could do was take a deep breath and plunge in.

The kids are doing their best, even though this is difficult for them. This is all new to us, all of us. Tonight was workout with Nicole...wow...that was tough. I didn&apos;t think it was going to be easy, but the words&quot;I can&apos;t&quot;came to my mind and even out of my mouth once. That&apos;s when I determined to shut up and keep moving forward. I can...we can....we will.

I went into Monday night&apos;s workout not feeling well, but I gave it all I could. Last night and this morning I just have been feeling horrible so I went to the doctor&apos;s. Apparently I have a sinus infection that is kicking my butt...sorry Nicole you don&apos;t get credit for it this time :) This is also Day 2 of giving up Starbucks. Even though I always got the sugar free cappuccino with fat free milk, I made a decision to remove artifical sweetners from my life. I was by two different ones today and so far my willpower is holding strong.

 Henry 
This was my first workout on my own. I got to the gym around 3:30 pm on Tuesday and was surprised to see how packed it was getting that early in the day. I started with some cardio on the elliptical and finished my workout on the circuit machines. I came home feeling good and ready for this competition!

 

 Nicole: Trainer&apos;s Take

 Monday&apos;s workout was awesome. Everyone learned how to train at the appropriate
intensity so that stored fat is the primary energy source when doing cardio.  I think everyone
walked away with the understanding that jumping on a machine doesn&apos;t get the job done without 
purpose.

When you see my Fit4Life families on the cardio floor sweating and cranking out the 
 cardio...
reach over and give them a huge high five because they are truly working their buns off!

We were excited and honored to make the cut. On Last Wednesday, we were glad we got a tour of the gym and some explanation of the equipment and how to use them. It made it a bit less daunting to be starting up this new adventure. 

Thursday 9-22 was a chance to come to the gym as a family, let Sarah try the nursery and let Mom and Dad get used to using the machines and being&quot;at the gym.&quot; We got an introduction to the locker rooms and then after workout, Sarah got to try the pool.

9-24 Jackie got a chance to take advantage of classes at the Club. She actually ended up taking 3! She loved the aqua zoomba and had a fun time trying out body vibe and a hip hop style dance class (that worked her lower body). So far Matt has not chosen a class to try but he is still getting used to the whole Gym concept.

Monday 9-26 was the beginning of our real workouts with Theron. We were very nervous all day leading up to this. We figured he would kick out butts hard on day 1 and were afraid but also a little excited. It turned out to be very good as an introduction to what we would expect to do with him. Matt pushed himself pretty hard to make sure he got the most of the workout. He said his shoulders were sore that night. Jackie had some back pain that slowed her down a bit but she was able to do almost all of the exercises. It was a great start!

Well, we made it through our first night. It was tiring but energizing after we finished. I [JAYNE] was a little nervous with my bad knee, but our trainer did not let me overdo it. George gave it his best effort , but could not finish workout on 2 machines, but liked the treadmill the best. Jake had fun with his group. Looking forward to Wednesday . By week 12 hopefully you will be seeing alot less of us. Ha Ha !!

We had a great first workout yesterday with Theron. The boys really pushed themselves during all parts of our workout session. They seemed more comfortable on the cardio equipment than I was, but I was more comfortable on weights and the circuit. I thought I would be the one motivating the boys through this program, but the truth is, they motivate me just as much, if not more.

We also had our first video shoot with Laura. I wish she&apos;d recorded me on the elliptical instead of seated at the circuit. But, it&apos;s good to show my&quot;muffin top&quot;because it won&apos;t be around for long! Thank goodness.

Next session is boot camp, and I have no idea what to expect. I haven&apos;t done a push up in 30 years! I am sure we will be working hard, the boys will keep me motivated, and I better bring extra water!

Theron made Monday’s class challenging yet fun. I was nervous all day because I wasn’t sure what to expect. I know I am extremely overweight and did not know how or if I could keep up with the class. Theron was right there to encourage me to keep going even when I was exhausted. I was actually proud of myself that I completed all of the exercises and am very excited to continue to exercise. Even though I was still stiff on Tuesday, Steve and I went back to exercise and tried to increase both our time and tension on the skier and we did. It felt good too.

Steve
This program is something new for me but yet it was exciting to get started. It was challenging though because I haven’t exercised for a very long time. My doctor wanted me to exercise to help me with my health issues and I was thinking that wouldn’t happen. But when Barb came to me about this program and said that she wanted to give it a try, I thought that is the way to go. Now I am as excited and committed as Barb to win this thing.

Wow, what a difference a day makes !!! Day2:

Theron was serious and so were we as a team. Being on the field wasn&apos;t as easy as it looked but we pressed through a series of endurance challenges.
My Aunt surprised me as I watched her tackle each challenge with confidence and energy. By the end of this solid hour, I realized my body was in shock but it felt great.

3 sets of each exercise (5 min exchange intervals)

1. Stair Endurance
2. Sled Resistance Pushing
3. Ropes
4. Mini Hurdle Jumping
5. Full Field Run
 Ended the hour with 5-8 min of stretching

The Jeric Family had an exciting night last night. This was our first exercise session with Nicole and cardio was the target. Though the three of us completed all the exercises we were surprised by how out of shape we were. After we were done and leaving the gym we were discussing how exhilarated we felt by the cardio workout. The program seems well put together and we are looking forward to seeing how our body responds to our new healthy life style.

It is often said that today is the first day of the rest of your life. Yesterday was the first official day of the Lopus&apos; Family Fit4Life journey. I must admit that when the night was over I briefly wondered what we had gotten ourselves into! Positive lifestyle change is rarely easy, and often involves some sort of physical or emotional pain. We were not promised that this would be easy, but if we follow the plan our lives will be changed. Our family, like most, is faced with multiple challenges. It is difficult to change habits that have been passed through many generations. Two weeks ago I probably would have hit the drive-thru on the way home to pick up the kids some fast food, not only out of convenience but also out habit. Our biggest challenge is probably with time. Working, homework, other extracurricular activities, and even day to day life needs such as laundry, make it difficult to find time to exercise. But we have to make time. It&apos;s not an option anymore.

 I&apos;ve been so excited to get into The Arena Club ever since I saw the article in the paper about the Fit4Life competition. I was expecting Nicole to be in my face yelling like Jillian Michaels, but she was nothing but encouraging. The program she laid out really kicked my butt. I felt like I got a great workout and would never have been able to do it on my own without her guidance.

 I had a great workout and sweated alot! I didn&apos;t realize that there were so many different pieces of equipment for cardio. I am looking forward to our next training session with Nicole.

 Our First Day of Fit4Life training finally arrived. We as a family have been so&quot;pumped&quot;and&quot;amped&quot;up about this exciting new journey we are about to embark upon....so it comes to know surprise that we were a tad bit disheartened when we all couldn&apos;t be there on the first day. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we had a family emergency that had to be tended to. I (Franklin) showed up and represented and trained for the James Team...You may have noticed the extra sweat pouring down my face---that was for my absent team members- Aunt O&apos;Melia and my cousin Domonick. But please know this isn&apos;t and hasn&apos;t stopped us as a family (THE JAMES FAMILY) determined to finish and beat this competition. 

The first day was great!!!

30 Min of Cardio
15 Min of Balance and Stretching
15 Min of Cross Training.

Theron didn&apos;t let up on us at no point but was keeping an close eye on every team&apos;s strengths and weakness&apos;. You could see him internalizing each of our minute to minute progression and making assessments on how far he could take us on our personal Fit4Life Journey to be WINNERS!!!

Not a bad first day if I may say so myself.

Look forward to my upcoming  Blog#2 after Wednesday...You&apos;ll have some of my Auntie&apos;s input on there as well.

Meet the Families
 posted: 9.26.2011 

 
Theron&apos;s team of Families:

 The Brown Family: Barbara and Steven are coming into this competition not having an understanding on how to live a healthy lifestyle. Barbara is concerned for her husband Steven’s health, while also wanting to get fit. Both of them seem eager to work and win this competition and I believe will do everything they can to see results and get on the right track for a healthy lifestyle. The James family : O’Melia, Domonick, and Franklin.... O’Melia comes off as a strong independent woman who is raising her son and wants a healthy life for her and her family. Franklin her nephew also is sharing responsibilities in raising Domonick. With Franklin being Domonick’s idol the three should soar through this competition. The Piercey Family: Jacqueline, Matthew and daughter serendipity. A family filled with medical problems is the first thing I seen when reading there story but as soon as I met them I could tell they were ready to change that. Even though Matthew and Jacqueline have there medical issues they want to make sure Sarah who is 2 gets to live the best live she can WITH her parents. I believe this is one of the many reasons the parents are seeking help and I know will do well in this competition.
 The Lewis family: Mother Jennifer, and sons Michael, Jackson, and Benjamin. A single mother of three boy’s wow!!!!!!!! That right there says it all. First time I met Jennifer the first thing she said was&quot;we are going to be the winning family&quot;with an attitude like that and raising three boys, it’s clear she is not afraid of a challenge. Unlike the other families Jennifer’s support system is coming from her oldest son Michael who is 14. It’s going to be nice to see these boys... excuse me little men grow up and help there mom through this. 





Nicole&apos;s team of Families:

 The Jeric Family: Mark, Lisa and their three kids Anna, Emily and Molly are embarking on their first real attempt at making a huge change in their lifestyle.  With busy schedules running kids to sports and constantly being“on the go”; the Jeric’s have found physical fitness on the bottom of the list for quite some time.  This family is eager to learn how to make health and fitness a staple in their life.
 The Lopus Family : Mary and her four kids Ben, Megan, Matthew and Zachary are also starting the journey with Nicole and the Fit 4 Life team here at the Arena Club.  This family has deep strength and heart supporting husband and Dad Jeffrey as he is currently on one of many deployments with the United States Military.  This family is in a cycle of poor habits stemming from generations being passed on and is determined to break the cycle and make a serious change. The Schroeder Family: George, Jayne and their two sons Shawn and Jake are also taking on the Fit 4 Life challenge here at the Arena Club.  Battling personal health issues within the family has made a reality close to home.  They have made attempts with nutritional strides in the past and are really looking to learn the tools to make this change happen right… for good! The Scott Family: Henry, Kim and their four kids Connor, Emily Paige and Noah are ready to make the Fit 4 Life journey.  With obesity in the family history and growing up on Southern home cooking, the Scott’s have found those habits working their way in to their own household.  Mom and Dad are ready to push this family into the right direction to become positive role models for what being healthy really means! 



 When I read the stories about these people, I felt an immediate draw to them.  Now that I have met these families with true needs, goals and desires… I can’t wait to make it happen for them.  This will be a life changing experience for all of us... I can tell you that!  I couldn’t be more honored to be the so involved with this program!  Stay tuned because good things are definitely to come!
