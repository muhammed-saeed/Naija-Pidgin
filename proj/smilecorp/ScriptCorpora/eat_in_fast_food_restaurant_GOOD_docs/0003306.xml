 Unhealthy Food Choices for Diabetics

Even though most registered dietitians will maintain the mantra &quot;all foods can fit&quot; in a healthy diabetic diet, there are still unhealthy food choices to avoid. A lot of this has to do with portion control -- a healthy food choice can become an unhealthy one very quickly when the recommended portion size doubles or triples. Added fats can also push otherwise healthy food choices south, so it&apos;s usually best to avoid fried foods, fatty cuts of meat and to choose low-fat dairy options. If the nutrition facts are available for the food in question, then opt for foods with fewer than 30% calories from fat and fewer than 10% from saturated fat. Look for food with less than 500mg of sodium that fit your meal plan prescription for carbohydrates. Watch out for hidden fats and carbs, too: here are 3 good examples of foods that sound healthy at first, but often have excess calories, fat and carbohydrates.

Tuna, Chicken, or Egg Salad Sandwiches

I&apos;m a big fan of sandwiches, especially for diabetics. Lean proteins and vegetables on slices of whole grain bread make for a quick and balanced diabetic meal. But be careful about tuna, chicken and egg salad sandwiches, especially if you&apos;re eating out. Most commercially prepared salad sandwich fillers use plenty of full-fat mayonnaise. This pushes the calorie and fat levels sky-high. If you&apos;re cooking at home, use just enough reduced-fat or fat-free mayonnaise to hold everything together. If you&apos;re eating out, it&apos;s probably better to skip the salad sandwiches.

 Southwestern Salads 

You can put the words &quot;taco&quot; and &quot;salad&quot; in the same sentence, but it doesn&apos;t make it healthy. Healthy salad meals start with about a two-cup base of leafy greens (the darker the green the better) and are topped with lean proteins, non-starchy vegetables, possibly legumes, and a light dressing. Southwestern salads, on the other hand, are often are saturated with fats in the form of full-fat cheeses, fried meats, heavy dressings, and fried salad toppers. There are healthy ones out there, but this category of &quot;salads&quot; should be a red-flag.

 Smoothies 

Smoothies may sound synonymous with health food, but they are not. Many retail establishments use smoothie mixes that contain too much added sugar, especially for a diabetic. The healthiest smoothies are made with unsweetened fresh or frozen fruit, reduced-fat milk, yogurt, and possibly silken tofu. Low-fat dairy, silken tofu, and even a whey protein powder can help to increase the protein content of a smoothie, making it a nice, well-balanced diabetic option. However, even healthy smoothies can provide too much carbohydrate if you make them too big. If you&apos;re buying a pre-made smoothie from the grocery store, read the food label and note the recommended portion size. If you&apos;re purchasing a fresh smoothie or making them at home, shoot for a 8-12 ounce serving size.

Restaurant French Fries

Even though many restaurants now use oils that are trans-fat free, french fries are generally still loaded with fat, calories and sodium. A large portion from a fast food restaurant will usually be about 500-600 calories, 25 grams of fat and 1000 mg of sodium. So instead of fries, opt for a side of fruit or salad instead.

Frozen Pot Pies

There are actually a good number of healthy and tasty microwavable meals available on the market today - Healthy Choice and Lean Cuisine make meal options that are generally low in fat and sodium. However, most frozen pot pies are loaded with fat, calories and sodium. Expect that a frozen pot pie will cost you between 600-1000 calories, anywhere from 30-60 grams of fat and around 1000 mg of sodium.
