I finally got a chance to go to this Chic-fil-a.  Before this, the only Chic-fil-a I had been to was the one in Northridge.
This location is set up in a very similar way.  Aside from the building set up, there are other similarities as well.  The service is very very good.  The food is also Very good.  I was feeling sick and dehydrated when I went but the chicken really helped.

My only problem with this place is a pretty  big one.  They have the big condiment bar that you find in all Chick-fil-A&apos;s but this place does not have any of the sauces.  Only catchup, salt, pepper, and straws.  You have to ASK for  the sauces at the register.  Lame.
COME ON CHICK-FIL-A, DON&apos;T GO CHEAP ON ME NOW!

Before we got a Chick-Fil-A, I had always heard how the chicken sandwiches were incredibly delicious, basically the way people describe it you would think it was the second coming.  Well I decided to finally give it a go and give them a shot, and all I have to say is, &quot;what is the big deal?&quot;

The chicken sandwich isn&apos;t bad per say, but its not exactly great either.  The chicken sandwich tastes EXACTLY like the ones served at Wendy&apos;s, and while they are good sandwiches, they certainly do nothing to live up to the hype that people put on this place.

I don&apos;t foresee myself coming back anytime soon.  As an aside I find that its hard to support a chain that has such deplorable business practices.  I know that the individual people here probably don&apos;t support those practices, but the restaurant is still part of the chain.  This doesn&apos;t factor in to my rating, but it still irks me anytime I drive past this place.

Today my sister brought me lunch from chic fil a. I had the spicy chicken sandwich on wheat bun with waffle fries and chic fil a sauce. First of all the sandwich looked smashed and horrible. They gave me white instead of wheat but whatever. The chicken was spicy and tasty I will give them that but the waffle fries were not up to par. 4 star rating for flavor alone. Not a winner in my book overall.

I am practically a CELEBRITY when I drive through all the time. Their service is truly INCREDIBLE! Beyond any drive through place I have ever been in my LIFE. I love chicken, but I LOVE chicken more when I come here, it&apos;s so healthy and I especially love their spicy chicken sandwich. All the different sauces to chose from is really nice because it aids to everyone&apos;s style and taste buds, I love their fries because I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;m clogging my arteries as each fry goes down. They use a different method of customer service....it&apos;s RESPECT for your customers and making sure you are 100% happy. Thank you! Your five stars are DESERVED. P.s. my boyfriend out in Georgia who is in the air force raves about you guys out there too.....just goes to show, their service and quality is not just a California thing....it&apos;s everywhere they put their establishment. High five to the head honcho&apos;s!

The food is great, and the service is acceptable, I guess my criticism is more towards Fresno in general.  As is MANY cases in this town, Fresnans have been deprived of real food/culture/etc and when they finally get a great place like this, they find it nessasary to clog it with patrons 24/7.  I&apos;m from the Bay Area and don&apos;t get me wrong, its nice to finally get a CFA in town, but I have a hard time visiting it cause I always have a long wait, and the other negative is that it reminds me of my widow which makes it even worse.  So take my review with a grain of salt, but considering my accuracy on all my other reviews, its a very big grain of salt..LOL

Came here for dinner after a doctor&apos;s appointment.  Was a little surprised at how empty it was, but on the other hand it meant a clean lobby and super fast service unlike the In-N-Out right next door.

I ordered the southwest salad which was good, and very fresh for a fast food restaurant which caught me by surprise.  My bf&apos;s chicken strips were not fresh made but at least they were real breast meat unlike a lot of other fast food joints that serve you strips of processed meat/meat product.  The one thing that caught me off guard was the Chick Fil-A sauce.  I don&apos;t know what they put into it other than honey mustard bbq but I think it must be crack.  It was so good that I even ate it on my bf&apos;s waffle fries.  So much for a healthy salad.

Love this place! Every time my boyfriend and I visit Fresno, we make at least two stops a day here. We don&apos;t have this place in San Jose so we always have to pig out when we&apos;re in Fresno. I honestly like everything on the menu. My boyfriend loves the chicken strips with the BBQ and polynesian sauce. I love the spicy chicken sandwich with the honey roasted BBQ sauce, spicy chicken biscuit, and chicken noodle soup. When I do eat the strips, I enjoy them with the chickfila sauce. Their sweet tea is also very good.

I always have a pleasant experience here but I did have one exceptional experience awhile back. It was extremely crowded and all the tables were taken. My boyfriend and I were looking to eat in and so I was telling the cashier that was taking our order about the situation and next thing we knew, she grabbed the next open table for us. She had us sit down and brought our food out to us even though it was ridiculously busy. She was very nice and I really appreciated her service.

Their food is excellent, but the friendly service sealed the deal.  I ordered a children&apos;s meal, but just wanted water instead of juice, milk, or soda. The server said this was the one substitution they were not allowed to make and she would have to charge me for the cup.  I had no problem with this,  but SHE did. She said that&apos;s all right I&apos;ll just comp you the meal. I&apos;m the owner and I can do it if I want to. After that I would definitely return!

I do not get this place.  The people that work here have a really hard time getting a simple order correct and then they want to argue instead of saying sorry for the mistake or trying to correct the problem.  The sandwiches are ALWAYS luke warm at best.  Try McDonalds intead.

Completed the survey on my receipt, and WHAMMO!  One free Original chicken sandwich...YAY!

Tried the grilled chicken sandwich today.  It&apos;s good, but my heart belongs to my Original chicken sandwich w/no pickles and a couple packs of their awesome mayo (don&apos;t know why I love it, but I do!).

I&apos;ll be back...you can count on it!

Just when I thought I could say I am sooo over fast food... Hellooo Chick-fil-A!!!

Breakfast goodies: Spicy Chicken Biscuit or the Chicken Breakfast Burritto... AND for my nephew who doesn&apos;t ever finish his food... the Chick-n-minis... for him NOT for me ;)

Can&apos;t go wrong with the Spicy Chicken Sandwich, waffle fries and the banana pudding shake or oreo shake... and A LOT of nuggets for the nephew ;)

Quick tip: Order a lot of nuggets and get every sauce available! BBQ, Spicy, Polynesian, Honey Mustard and Ranch... they&apos;re all pretty yummy!

Good tasting food no matter what you buy.  But if it has been sitting around a little (not hot anymore) then it doesn&apos;t taste nearly as good, in fact awful.  The chicken sandwiches only taste good if it came right from being cooked that instant.  And this is what I expect when paying $10 for a meal.  Also the portions are small in comparison with the price that I pay.  I don&apos;t like this place because 1). not hot  2). high price  3). small portions.

To my taste-buds, the sauces do NOT taste good at all.  After realizing I didn&apos;t like any of the sauces, I then looked at the ingredients and saw that the sauces have high fructose corn syrup and other crap inside the ingredients.

For a fast food restaurant trying to act like a higher class fast food restaurant, it sure needs lots of improvements.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, the sandwiches are still great, but there is need for lots of improvement in price to portion ratio and making sure everything is hot when served.

This mecca of all sorts of various tasty chicken food products is one of many locations in the state of California.  VERY DISAPPOINTINGLY, the closest location to my abode is over 1.5 hrs away.  I&apos;ll drive it as a last resort, but COME ON - give us a decent Bay Area locale!

But I digress.  Thankfully we were driving back to the Bay from a three-day camping trip in Sequoia and someone remembered that there was a Chick-fil-A in the lovely town of Fresno.  We called to make sure they weren&apos;t closed b/c of Labor Day.  Not only were they totally open, it was FREE SANDWICH DAY if you were wearing &quot;sports gear&quot;.  Hold, please while I go buy like a million Fresno High Football t-shirts so I can get some free sammiches.

Needless to say, this place was totally packed.  Chick-fil-A employees are always the nicest set of fast food employees ever.  They brought out samples of Coke Zero, got us free refills, bussed our table, and ::gasp:: smiled and interacted with the patrons of the restaurant!!  Amazing!

You can&apos;t beat the waffle fries with ranch.  OMG FRIESSSSSSSSS.  The array of sauces is pretty staggering.  I almost took a bag of sauce home with me.  Fresno&apos;s standing in my book went up like 6 places because of this restaurant experience ALONE.

There are Chick-fil-A&apos;s in California?  WHAT?!  This ain&apos;t the south!  But I&apos;m all over it.

My go-to lunch/dinner/snack is a deluxe chicken sandwich meal.  You get a medium size waffle fries and a drink.  Try the Chick-fil-A sauce.  It&apos;s like a fusion of honey mustard, mayo, and bbq.

They open for breakfast at 6:30am most mornings, and you can get lunch during breakfast hours too.  Woot!  Closed on Sundays.

Most of my sycophants love Chick-fil-A.  They love it!

I must admit that the food is decent as fast food goes.  But let&apos;s face it...

It&apos;s fast food.  And they nickel and dime you to death!  Evil doesn&apos;t care much for being nickelled and dimed.

For example, they have a regular sandwich and a deluxe sandwich.  The only difference is that the regular has chicken and pickles on a bun.

That&apos;s it.

The deluxe, which is $0.50 more, includes lettuce and tomatos.  If you just want lettuce, you get to pay more.

WTF?

The only good thing is that you can stock up on their sauces...

This place has the best chicken!.. Tastes home made not processed and over breaded.. Or greasy..

I just moved to Fresno from Atlanta, GA and let me tell you.. Chick-fil-A is very popular there.. People preffer it over other fast food places when it comes to the chicken sandwich. Yes it&apos;s plain but that&apos;s the point.. U can add any of the yummy sauces or mayo. Try the Polynesian. Not to mention they&apos;re employees are Very curtious.. Typical southern hospitality.. That&apos;s what they are known for. And.. They sell fresh brewed sweet tea by the gallon!.. Only place in Cali that has genuine southern sweet tea. ;D

Today was my second visit here since Chik-Fil-A&apos;s opening. Since I&apos;ve been red-meat free for lent, I&apos;ve been trying to go to this place but it seems like I totally forget it&apos;s here until Sundays (when the damn place shuts down, naturally.) Anyway, I&apos;ve heard this place be called the &quot;In-N-Out of chicken sandwiches,&quot; to which I call bullshit on right now. They&apos;re not much better than a Wendy&apos;s or Carl&apos;s Jr. chicken sandwich, so let&apos;s just get that out of the way right now.

Even though Chik-Fil-A doesn&apos;t have the &quot;stand out&quot; chicken sandwiches some people make it out to be, they do a lot of things right:

- Self serve dipping sauces. This might not seem like a big deal, but McDonald&apos;s and maybe other places actually have a policy as to how many ranches, bbq sauces or whatever they&apos;ll give you. I think it&apos;s 1 per every 6 nuggets or something like that. Chik-Fil-A gives you the option to grab as many as you want to drown your chicken or even pour some of that shit in your Coke if you choose to.

- Employees that (act like they) give a fuck. They have manners, address you as &quot;sir&quot; and if you thank them, they&apos;ll smile and say &quot;my pleasure&quot; or something over-the-top pleasant like that. I think they&apos;re trained in this way, and it makes them seem a little more professional than other fast-food restaurants.

- They take pride in their restaurant. Their bathrooms aren&apos;t all tagged up and urine-soaked. They have a little vase of (maybe faux) flowers on every table. Hell, they even have a little mascot that walks around the restaurant waving at and high-fiving the customers. None of this really matters to me, but the fact that it&apos;s clean and well-stocked and maintained is enough for me.

That being said, the prices are a little higher than other fast food. I paid $7 and some change for my spicy chicken sandwich meal. I was a little surprised that to make the sandwich a &quot;deluxe&quot; (basically, giving you lettuce and tomatoes so you&apos;re not eating a plain piece of chicken with bread) costs an extra .40 cents or so. That should come standard with the sandwich, right? Oh well. At the end of the day, it&apos;s a chicken sandwich. I could get roughly the same experience at Wendy&apos;s/Carl&apos;s Jr. Nothing special, but other fast food chains need to take note on how to run their stores, except for that BS &quot;closed on Sundays&quot; thing...

I finally tired this place when I treated a friend to lunch.

Menu is simple, everything has chicken, but what I love the most is the orgy of sauce you have to choose from. You can do a solo adventure or an exotic array of sauces. Chick-fil-a sauce is amazing.

Ive passed by this place before, but never really paid attention to it or the name. But yeah now i get it...haha duh!

So this place is definitely all about CHICKEN. Chicken sandwiches, chicken burgers, chicken wraps, and even breakfast items with of course, chicken.

I ate the Spicy Chicken Sandwich which wasnt really spicy, which I was really surprised about since this place is from the south and all.  Then again my sandwich was over done with the pickles, which again I heard was a southern thing too. Its just something I heard.
Oh well, but the sides were good; having the choice between salads, fruits, fries, and some type of yogurt....all sounds good to me.

I would definitely go back here again, it was pretty fast service for being packed inside and in the drive-thru. Plus how could you deny all the side sauces, theres like 9 different ones! Yumm!

I have to agree with Evil on this one. I was recently under the assumption that Chick fil a wasn&apos;t doing so well and my fellow yelpers pointed out that they seemed to be doing quite well. I first visited the establishment when they had newly opened and I wasn&apos;t impressed at all.

After a discussion on yelp, I decided to return, perhaps I had been too harsh in my initial assesment.

I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that my intial reaction was correct.

I took the family to Chick fil a today instead of chinese, I wish I had gone for the chinese food instead - it would have cost the same for a sit down dining experience!

The place wasn&apos;t very busy, but the place looked like it had been busy. Most of the tables were dirty and furniture seamed out of place. Expected from a fast food joint I suppose.

The menu is all about the chicken as expected, but the prices are certainly higher than most fast food chains.

Dinner for my family of four, with tax, came to just under $36!!

Really? $36 bucks for 2 orders of chicken strips, a chicken salad and wrap? wtf? granted they were all &quot;meals&quot; but c&apos;mon.

If I&apos;m going to pay $8 for a fast food value meal I&apos;m expecting something exceptional, and in all honesty it was just average.

The upside is that the chicken seemed fresh-ish and they have a million sauces. That&apos;s it for the upside. I can get the same product at other fast food chains (like the hand battered chicken strips at carls Jr, or the grilled chicken strips at jack n the box) for a lot less. I can also say the establishment is well branded, its funny to read but doesn&apos;t really add value to my dining experience.

The service was standard fast food chain service. Nothing to write home about.

Sorry Chick Fil A, you&apos;re just not worth it to me. In n out would have been an equally fresh option at literally half the price!

I cheered out loud when I heard they were opening this store.  I ate Chick-fil-A chicken biscuits almost every single morning (except Sunday) when I was in college.  I know they have more than this on the menu, but they&apos;re SO good, I really believe this restaurant could be profitable if it was the ONLY thing on the menu!

LITERALLY every single weekend that I am in Fresno, assuming I&apos;m not hungover (and sometimes when I AM), I get up on Saturday morning and drive over to Chick-fil-A for chicken biscuits.  This is the best fast food chain on the planet.  ON THE PLANET.

CHICKEN BISCUITS!!!

Lets be clear this is a fast food restaurant, nothing more nothing less.  I have eaten at this establishment 30-40 times or so and I know what I&apos;m talking about.  There is nothing to see here.  Sodium levels are much, much higher then other &quot;fast-food&quot; restaurants.  A simple google search will show you the levels as will your taste buds.  Salt only does so much to cover up mediocre food.

After a morning of shopping in the River Park zone, hubby and I needed some sustenance before grocery shopping.  I knew Chick-fil-A had come to Fresno, and I have read for decades about this place and its owner (good buddy of John Maxwell&apos;s), so felt like we needed to try it out.

I am NOT a fast food person.  If I am forced to eat at a fast food place while traveling with teenagers, I will accept Taco Bell or In N Out Burger, but nothing else.  Now I can add Chick-fil-A to that short list.  Of course, finding one of these isn&apos;t too easy west of the Mississippi.

I had the chicken salad sandwich which was served on a nice whole grain bread with leaf lettuce, not that iceberg stuff that isn&apos;t good for you.  The coleslaw was perfect, sweet with lots of mayo.  They make their own lemonade which is great for someone who doesn&apos;t drink sodas.  Hubby got the chicken wrap.  It had huge chunks of chicken (not something I like, but he was very pleased.)

The place is immaculate and there are fresh flowers on the tables as well as in the ladies room.

Super yummy. I wasn&apos;t expecting much, I&apos;ve had chicken sandwiches before, how different could it taste?

Those were the best chicken nuggets I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s not too breaded, you can taste the chicken, and that honey mustard dip is super good!

The chicken sandwich seemed plain, and i typically don&apos;t like any burger, salad, or sandwich plain; but the taste of the sandwich was so good!

We went through the drive through and the employees were very friendly. They also give a little book in the kids meal. Gotta love that!

Fresnans sure like their fast food chains, if the reaction to a Chick-fil-A opening on Blackstone is any indication. People camped out the night before as part of a promotion where the first 100 customers got a free meal a week for a year.

The draw here are chicken sandwiches. The mainstay is a fried chicken breast with a couple of pickles on either a white or wheat (for 20 cents more) bun. If you saw the incessant advertising when McDonald&apos;s rolled out their &quot;Southern-style&quot; chicken sandwich, you&apos;re familiar. Thankfully, the Chick-fil-A sandwich is tastier and fresher than Mickey D&apos;s simaculum. I think their Charbroiled Chicken Club is even better than their fried chicken sandwich.

Oh, and for those not familiar, Chick-fil-A is not open on Sundays. The founders are devout Christians, and don&apos;t want their employees to miss church or work on the Sabbath. Two older women &quot;from the mountains&quot; made a point of telling me that they drove down to support the business because &quot;they&apos;re Christians.&quot; I&apos;m not sure why they felt the need to tell me that. I had come from work and was wearing a tie - maybe they thought I owned the place.

It should be noted that everyone here is really friendly. I think they imported some Southerners for the opening of the restaurant. People seem to sincerely want you to enjoy your meal, and I&apos;ve seen numerous times when staff went out of their way to make things right for the customer.

Aside from the chicken sandwiches, you can get chicken strips, chicken nuggets, chicken wraps, and chicken biscuits. (See a pattern developing?) The only chicken option that didn&apos;t impress me was the soup. It was heavy on the noodles, so it&apos;s better for kids than it is for colds. The waffle-cut fries (which are a paler version of Carl&apos;s Jr.&apos;s criss-cut fries) go well with their many sauce options. As it turns out, there ARE free refills, you just have to wait in line again.

This place grows on you.  After living in Atlanta, Georgia for eight years, I had come to really love this place.  I was absolutely thrilled to see this place open!  It sits perfectly with In-n-Out as another fast-food institution that I could eat at everyday for pure gluttony.

It&apos;s a very, very good chicken sandwich for fast food.  The waffle fries are always a nice touch.  Recommend anyone to at least try the sweet tea as your soft drink (you have to ask for it!  But can&apos;t go wrong with their lemonade) for a good introduction to the South (it&apos;s everywhere out there).  If it wasn&apos;t for my wife, I&apos;d be eating at this place every other meal (of course, the other one would be at In-n-Out just a short hop away).

The chains are flocking to Fresno! it was pretty exciting to hear that Chick-fil-A had replaced the Krispy Kreme next to In-n-Out..

And today we got a free order of 4 chicken strips because they forgot my 12-piece chicken nuggets. Mmmmm even more chicken to dip in the polynesian sauce. No complaints here.

Hands down the best fast food joint to get chicken nuggets&amp;chicken sandwiches.

Fresnans have a tendency to flock to new eating establishments.
This is a nice store and lay out. Nothing noted that was extra special for all the hype on the memu.
Visit and make your own judgement.
