See the front matter of this Solutions Manual for suggestions regarding your choices of assignment material for each chapter.
1-1 Management accounting measures, analyzes and reports financial and nonfinancial information that helps managers make decisions to fulfill the goals of an organization. It focuses on internal reporting and is not restricted by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Financial accounting focuses on reporting to external parties such as investors, government agencies, and banks. It measures and records business transactions and provides financial statements that are based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Other differences include (1) management accounting emphasizes the future (not the past), and (2) management accounting influences the behavior of managers and other employees (rather than primarily reporting economic events). 1-2 Financial accounting is constrained by generally accepted accounting principles. Management accounting is not restricted to these principles. The result is that management accounting allows managers to charge interest on owners capital to help judge a divisions performance, even though such a charge is not allowed under GAAP, management accounting can include assets or liabilities (such as brand names developed internally) not recognized under GAAP, and management accounting can use asset or liability measurement rules (such as present values or resale prices) not permitted under GAAP. 1-3 Management accountants can help to formulate strategy by providing information about the sources of competitive advantagefor example, the cost, productivity, or efficiency advantage of their company relative to competitors or the premium prices a company can charge relative to the costs of adding features that make its products or services distinctive. 1-4 The business functions in the value chain are Research and developmentgenerating and experimenting with ideas related to new products, services, or processes. Design of products, services, and processesthe detailed planning and engineering of products, services, or processes. Productionacquiring, coordinating, and assembling resources to produce a product or deliver a service. Marketingpromoting and selling products or services to customers or prospective customers. Distributiondelivering products or services to customers. Customer serviceproviding after-sale support to customers.
1-
1-5 Supply chain describes the flow of goods, services, and information from the initial sources of materials and services to the delivery of products to consumers, regardless of whether those activities occur in the same organization or in other organizations. Cost management is most effective when it integrates and coordinates activities across all companies in the supply chain as well as across each business function in an individual companys value chain. Attempts are made to restructure all cost areas to be more cost-effective. 1-6 Management accounting deals only with costs. This statement is misleading at best, and wrong at worst. Management accounting measures, analyzes, and reports financial and nonfinancial information that helps managers define the organizations goals, and make decisions to fulfill them. Management accounting also analyzes revenues from products and customers in order to assess product and customer profitability. Therefore, while management accounting does use cost information, it is only a part of the organizations information recorded and analyzed by management accountants. 1-7 Management accountants can help improve quality and achieve timely product deliveries by recording and reporting an organizations current quality and timeliness levels and by analyzing and evaluating the costs and benefitsboth financial and non-financialof new quality initiatives such as TQM, relieving bottleneck constraints or providing faster customer service. 1-8 The five-step decision-making process is (1) identify the problem and uncertainties (2) obtain information (3) make predictions about the future (4) make decisions by choosing among alternatives and (5) implement the decision, evaluate performance and learn. 1-9 Planning decisions focus on (a) selecting organization goals, predicting results under various alternative ways of achieving those goals, deciding how to attain the desired goals, and (b) communicating the goals and how to attain them to the entire organization. Control decisions focus on (a) taking actions that implement the planning decisions, and (b) deciding how to evaluate performance and providing feedback and learning to help future decision making. 1-10 The three guidelines for management accountants are 1. Employ a cost-benefit approach. 2. Recognize behavioral and technical considerations. 3. Apply the notion of different costs for different purposes.
1-11 Agree. A successful management accountant requires general business skills (such as understanding the strategy of an organization) and people skills (such as motivating other team members) as well as technical skills (such as computer knowledge, calculating costs of products, and supporting planning and control decisions).

The new controller could reply in one or more of the following ways: (a) Demonstrate to the plant manager how he or she could make better decisions if the plant controller was viewed as a resource rather than a deadweight. In a related way, the plant controller could show how the plant managers time and resources could be saved by viewing the new plant controller as a team member. (b) Demonstrate to the plant manager a good knowledge of the technical aspects of the plant. This approach may involve doing background reading. It certainly will involve spending much time on the plant floor speaking to plant personnel. (c) Show the plant manager examples of the new plant controllers past successes in working with line managers in other plants. Examples could include assistance in preparing the budget, assistance in analyzing problem situations and evaluating financial and nonfinancial aspects of different alternatives, and assistance in submitting capital budget requests. (d) Seek assistance from the corporate controller to highlight to the plant manager the importance of many tasks undertaken by the new plant controller. This approach is a last resort but may be necessary in some cases.
1-13 IMA stands for the Institute of Management Accountants. It is the largest association of management accountants in the United States. The CMA (Certified Management Accountant) is the professional designation for management accountants and financial executives. It demonstrates that the holder has met the admission criteria and demonstrated the competency of management accounting knowledge required by the IMA. 1-14 The Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) sets standards of ethical conduct for management accountants in the following areas: Competence Confidentiality Integrity Credibility 1-15 Steps to take when established written policies provide insufficient guidance are (a) Discuss the problem with the immediate superior (except when it appears that the superior is involved). (b) Clarify relevant ethical issues by confidential discussion with an IMA Ethics Counselor or other impartial advisor. (c) Consult your own attorney as to legal obligations and rights concerning the ethical conflicts.

(1015 min.) Professional ethics and reporting division performance.
1. Millers ethical responsibilities are well summarized in the IMAs Standards of Ethical Conduct for Management Accountants (Exhibit 1-7 of text). Areas of ethical responsibility include the following: competence confidentiality integrity credibility
The ethical standards related to Millers current dilemma are integrity, competence and credibility. Using the integrity standard, Miller should carry out duties ethically and communicate unfavorable as well as favorable information and professional judgments or opinions. Competence demands that Miller perform her professional duties in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, and technical standards. Credibility requires that Miller report information fairly and objectively. Miller should refuse to book the $200,000 of sales until the goods are shipped. Both financial accounting and management accounting principles maintain that sales are not complete until the title is transferred to the buyer. 2. Miller should refuse to follow Maloney&apos;s orders. If Maloney persists, the incident should be reported to the corporate controller. Support for line management should be wholehearted, but it should not require unethical conduct. 1-24 1. (15 min.) Planning and control decisions, Internet company. Planning decisions a.

Other planning decisions that may be made at WebNews.com: decision to raise or lower advertising fees; decision to charge a fee from on-line retailers when customers click-through from WebNews.com to the retailers websites. Other control decisions that may be made at WebNews.com: evaluating how customers like the new format for the weather information, working with an outside vendor to redesign the website, and evaluating whether the waiting time for customers to access the website has been reduced.

(20 min.) Strategic decisions and management accounting.
1. The strategies the companies are following in each case are: a. Low price strategy b. Differentiated product strategy c. Low price strategy d. Differentiated product strategy 2. Examples of information the management accountant can provide for each strategic decision follow. a. Cost to manufacture and sell the cell phone Productivity, efficiency and cost advantages relative to competition Prices of competitive cell phones Sensitivity of target customers to price and quality The production capacity of Roger Phones and its competitors b. Cost to develop, produce and sell new software Premium price that customers would be willing to pay due to product uniqueness Price of basic software Price of closest competitive software Cash needed to develop, produce and sell new software Cost of producing the store-brand lip gloss Productivity, efficiency and cost advantages relative to competition Prices of competitive products Sensitivity of target customers to price and quality How the market for lip gloss is growing Cost to produce and sell new line of gourmet bologna Premium price that customers would be willing to pay due to product uniqueness Price of basic meat product Price of closest competitive product (15 min.)

2. As CFO, Perez will be interacting much more with the senior management of the company, the board of directors, and the external financial community. Any experience he can get with these aspects will help him in his new role as CFO. George Perez can be better positioned for his new role as CFO by participating in strategy discussions with senior management, by preparing the external investor communications and press releases under the guidance of the current CFO, by attending courses that focus on the interaction and negotiations between the various business functions and, either formally or on the job, getting training in issues related to investments and corporate finance. 1-28 (30 min.) Software procurement decisions, ethics.
1. Michael faces an ethical problem. The trip appears to be a gift which could influence his purchase decision. The ethical standard of integrity requires Michaels to refuse the gift. Companies with codes of conduct frequently have a supplier clause that prohibits their employees from accepting material (in some cases, any) gifts from suppliers. The motivations include (a) Integrity/conflict of interest. Suppose Michaels recommends that a Horizon 1-2-3 product should subsequently be purchased by Fiesta. This recommendation could be because he felt obligated to them as his trip to the Cancn conference was fully paid by Horizon. (b) The appearance of a conflict of interest. Even if the Horizon 1-2-3 product is the superior one at that time, other suppliers likely will have a different opinion. They may believe that the way to sell products to Fiesta is via fully-paid junkets to resorts. Those not wanting to do business this way may downplay future business activities with Fiesta even though Fiesta could gain much from such activities. Some executives view the meeting as suspect from the start given the Caribbean location and its rest and recreation tone. 2. Fiesta should not allow executives to attend user meetings while negotiating with other vendors about a purchase decision. The payment of expenses for the trip constitutes a gift that could appear to influence their purchase decision.
1-
Pros of attending user meeting (a) Opportunity to learn more about Horizons software products. (b) Opportunity to interact with other possible purchasers and get their opinions. (c) Opportunity to influence the future product development plans of Horizon in a way that will benefit Fiesta. An example is Horizon subsequently developing software modules tailored to food product companies. (d) Saves Fiesta money. Visiting suppliers and their customers typically cost money, whereas Horizon is paying for the Cancn conference. Cons of Attending (a) The ethical issues raised in requirement 1. (b) Negative morale effects on other Fiesta employees who do not get to attend the Cancn conference. These employees may reduce their trust and respect for Michaelss judgment, arguing he has been on a supplier-paid vacation. Conditions on Attending that Fiesta Might Impose (a) Sizable part of that time in Cancn has to be devoted to business rather than recreation. (b) Decision on which Fiesta executive attends is not made by the person who attends (this reduces the appearance of a conflict of interest). (c) Person attending (Michaels) does not have final say on purchase decision (this reduces the appearance of a conflict of interest). (d) Fiesta executives go only when a new major purchase is being contemplated (to avoid the conference becoming a regular vacation). A Conference Board publication on Corporate Ethics asked executives about a comparable situation. Following are the results: 76% said Fiesta and Michaels face an ethical consideration in deciding whether to attend. 71% said Michaels should not attend, as the payment of expenses is a gift within the meaning of a credible corporate ethics policy. 3. The company does not need its own code of ethics. They can use the code of ethics developed by the IMA. Pros of having a written code The Conference Board outlines the following reasons why companies adopt codes of ethics: (a) (b) (c) (d) Signals commitment of senior management to ethics. Promotes public trust in the credibility of the company and its employees. Signals the managerial professionalism of its employees. Provides guidance to employees as to how difficult problems are to be handled. If adhered to, employees will avoid many actions that are unethical or appear to be unethical. (e) Drafting of the policy (and its redrafting in the light of ambiguities) can assist management in anticipating and preparing for ethical issues not yet encountered.
1-
Cons of having a written code (a) Can give appearance that all issues have been covered. Issues not covered may appear to be acceptable even when they are not (b) Can constrain the entrepreneurial activities of employees. Forces people to always behave by the book. (c) Cost of developing code can be high if it consumes a lot of employee time. 1-29 (3040 min.) Professional ethics and end-of-year actions.
1. The possible motivations for the snack foods division wanting to take end-of-year actions include: (a) Management incentives. Gourmet Foods may have a division bonus scheme based on one-year reported division earnings. Efforts to front-end revenue into the current year or transfer costs into the next year can increase this bonus. (b) Promotion opportunities and job security. Top management of Gourmet Foods likely will view those division managers that deliver high reported earnings growth rates as being the best prospects for promotion. Division managers who deliver unwelcome surprises may be viewed as less capable. (c) Retain division autonomy. If top management of Gourmet Foods adopts a management by exception approach, divisions that report sharp reductions in their earnings growth rates may attract a sizable increase in top management supervision. 2. The Standards of Ethical Conduct . . . require management accountants to Perform professional duties in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, and technical standards. Refrain from engaging in any conduct that would prejudice carrying out duties ethically. Communicate information fairly and objectively.
Several of the end-of-year actions clearly are in conflict with these requirements and should be viewed as unacceptable by Taylor. (b) The fiscal year-end should be closed on midnight of December 31. Extending the close falsely reports next years sales as this years sales. (c) Altering shipping dates is falsification of the accounting reports. (f) Advertisements run in December should be charged to the current year. The advertising agency is facilitating falsification of the accounting records. The other end-of-year actions occur in many organizations and fall into the gray to acceptable area. However, much depends on the circumstances surrounding each one, such as the following: (a) If the independent contractor does not do maintenance work in December, there is no transaction regarding maintenance to record. The responsibility for ensuring that packaging equipment is well maintained is that of the plant manager. The division controller probably can do little more than observe the absence of a December maintenance charge. (d) In many organizations, sales are heavily concentrated in the final weeks of the fiscal year-end. If the double bonus is approved by the division marketing manager, the division controller can do little more than observe the extra bonus paid in December. 1-
(e) If TV spots are reduced in December, the advertising cost in December will be reduced. There is no record falsification here. (g) Much depends on the means of persuading carriers to accept the merchandise. For example, if an under-the-table payment is involved, or if carriers are pressured to accept merchandise, it is clearly unethical. If, however, the carrier receives no extra consideration and willingly agrees to accept the assignment because it sees potential sales opportunities in December, the transaction appears ethical. Each of the (a), (d), (e), and (g) end-of-year actions may well disadvantage Gourmet Foods in the long run. For example, lack of routine maintenance may lead to subsequent equipment failure. The divisional controller is well advised to raise such issues in meetings with the division president. However, if Gourmet Foods has a rigid set of line/staff distinctions, the division president is the one who bears primary responsibility for justifying division actions to senior corporate officers. 3. If Taylor believes that Ryan wants her to engage in unethical behavior, she should first directly raise her concerns with Ryan. If Ryan is unwilling to change his request, Taylor should discuss her concerns with the Corporate Controller of Gourmet Foods. She could also initiate a confidential discussion with an IMA Ethics Counselor, other impartial adviser, or her own attorney. Taylor also may well ask for a transfer from the snack foods division if she perceives Ryan is unwilling to listen to pressure brought by the Corporate Controller, CFO, or even President of Gourmet Foods. In the extreme, she may want to resign if the corporate culture of Gourmet Foods is to reward division managers who take end-of-year actions that Taylor views as unethical and possibly illegal. It was precisely actions along the lines of (b), (c), and (f) that caused Betty Vinson, an accountant at WorldCom to be indicted for falsifying WorldComs books and misleading investors. 1-30 (30 min.) Professional ethics and earnings management. 1. The possible motivations for Harvest Day Corporations CEO to manage earnings include (a) Manage the stock price. Harvest Days CEO wants to meet the forecasted earnings number of $1.34 per share because the CEO believes that the stock price will drop if actual earnings fall short of the forecast . (b) Job security. The CEO may be concerned that the Board of Directors may have a poor view of him if he delivers unwelcome surprises. Depending on how much the stock falls, they may even consider dismissing him. (c) Management incentives. The bonuses of top management and the CEO may be based on earnings. If earnings decrease, smaller or no bonuses may be paid. If top management and the CEO have stock options, the value of these options will be adversely affected if the stock price falls. 2. The Standards for Ethical Conduct requires management accountants to Perform professional duties in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, and technical standards. Refrain from engaging in any conduct that would prejudice carrying out duties ethically. Communicate information fairly and objectively.
1-
Several of the end of fiscal year actions clearly are in conflict with these requirements and should be viewed as unacceptable. (a) Subscriptions cancelled in December should be recorded in December itself and not delayed until January. (c) Subscription revenue received in December in advance for magazines that will be sent out in January is a liability. Showing it as revenue falsely reports next years revenue as this years revenue. (d) Office supplies purchased in December should be recorded as an expense of the current year and not as an expense of the next year. (e) Booking advertising revenues that relate to January in December falsely reports next years revenue as this years revenue. The other end of fiscal year actions occur in many organizations and fall into the gray to acceptable area. Much depends on the circumstances surrounding each one, however, such as the following: (b) If the software on office computers is not updated until January, there is no transaction or expense to record in December. The responsibility for ensuring that the software is updated is that of the chief information technology officer. The controller can do little more than observe the absence of a December software update and question whether this will have an adverse long-term impact on Harvest Day. (f) If building repairs are not done in December, there is no transaction to record in December. There is no record falsification here. The decision regarding when to do building repairs is made by the operations manager. (g) Many companies switch their depreciation policy from one method to another. Harvest Day could argue that straight-line depreciation better represents the decrease in the economic value of the asset compared to the declining balance method. Straight-line depreciation may also be more in line with what its competitors do. If, however, Harvest Day changes to straight-line depreciation with the sole purpose of reducing expenses to meet its earnings goal, such behavior would be unacceptable. The Standards of Ethical Behavior require management accountants to communicate information fairly and objectively and to carry out duties ethically. 3. Harvest Days controller should directly raise his/her concerns with the CEO. If the CEO refuses to change his request, the Controller should raise these issues with the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. The Controller could also initiate a confidential discussion with an IMA Ethics Counselor, other impartial adviser, or his/her own attorney. In the extreme, the Controller may want to resign if the corporate culture of Harvest Day is to reward executives who take end of fiscal year actions that the Controller views as unethical and possibly illegal. It was precisely actions along the lines of (a), (c), (d), and (e) that caused Betty Vinson, an accountant at WorldCom, to be indicted for falsifying WorldComs books and misleading investors.

(40 min.) Global company, ethical challenges with bribery.
1. It is clear that bribes are illegal according to U.S. laws. It is not clear from the case whether bribes are illegal in Vartan. However, knowledgeable people in global business would attest to the fact that it is virtually impossible to find any country in the world that specifically sanctions bribery. The major point, however, that deserves discussion is: Should ZenTel engage in any unethical activities even if they are not illegal? It is difficult to make a generalization about all shareholders of the company. It is, however, safe to assume that not all shareholders would want to keep their investment in a company that is engaged in unethical and/or illegal activities. There is historical evidence to substantiate this point: When apartheid laws were in effect in South Africa, many investors divested shares of companies doing business in South Africa. 2. Apparently Hank thinks that local culture and common practice are one and the same. This, in fact, is not the case. There are many common practices in developing countries, which are against the native culture. Specifically, bribery often leads to decisions that are not made on the basis of the merits of the alternative selected. This results in misallocation of meager resources of the developing country. Misallocation of resources has adverse effects on the economy of a country and the living standard of its population. The negative impact is intensified in developing countries because they can least afford the misallocation of resources. As it applies to local common practice, multinational companies make some small allowances but draw a hard line against paying the $1 million commission. 3. ZenTel might have an articulated corporate policy against such payments to get the message across that regardless of laws, the top management would not tolerate any bribery payments made by its employees. A strong and consistent message from the top often has a noticeable effect on the corporate culture and employee behavior. U.S. laws specifically prohibit bribery payments. Such payments can result in heavy penalties to the corporation making the payments. 4. If this contract is of great importance to ZenTels global strategy, it is likely that this kind of issue will come up again as ZenTel expands into very diverse cultures and the company should tackle it head on and make a policy decision against offering bribes. Steve Cheng should discuss the situation with the top management at ZenTel and re-affirm his goal to get the Vartan contract by legal means. He could seek the help of the U.S. commercial attach in Vartan to continue a dialogue with Vartans deputy minister of communications. He could propose other creative, legal changes to the ZenTels bid, even at the cost of reducing the profitability of the current project. Concessions such as training programs, schools and other public works projects may be legal, get the attention of the Vartan government and raise ZenTels profile both at home and abroad. In the worst case, if the Vartan government does not agree to any of the creative, legal extras that ZenTel can provide in order to win the contract, Cheng should report this to ZenTels management and be willing to walk away from the Vartan project.

CHAPTER 2 AN INTRODUCTION TO COST TERMS AND PURPOSES 2-1 A cost object is anything for which a separate measurement of costs is desired. Examples include a product, a service, a project, a customer, a brand category, an activity, and a department. 2-2 Direct costs of a cost object are related to the particular cost object and can be traced to that cost object in an economically feasible (cost-effective) way. Indirect costs of a cost object are related to the particular cost object but cannot be traced to that cost object in an economically feasible (cost-effective) way. Cost assignment is a general term that encompasses the assignment of both direct costs and indirect costs to a cost object. Direct costs are traced to a cost object while indirect costs are allocated to a cost object. 2-3 Managers believe that direct costs that are traced to a particular cost object are more accurately assigned to that cost object than are indirect allocated costs. When costs are allocated, managers are less certain whether the cost allocation base accurately measures the resources demanded by a cost object. Managers prefer to use more accurate costs in their decisions. 2-4 Factors affecting the classification of a cost as direct or indirect include the materiality of the cost in question, available information-gathering technology, design of operations
2-5 A variable cost changes in total in proportion to changes in the related level of total activity or volume. An example is a sales commission that is a percentage of each sales revenue dollar. A fixed cost remains unchanged in total for a given time period, despite wide changes in the related level of total activity or volume. An example is the leasing cost of a machine that is unchanged for a given time period (such as a year) regardless of the number of units of product produced on the machine. 2-6 A cost driver is a variable, such as the level of activity or volume, that causally affects total costs over a given time span. A change in the cost driver results in a change in the level of total costs. For example, the number of vehicles assembled is a driver of the costs of steering wheels on a motor-vehicle assembly line. 2-7 The relevant range is the band of normal activity level or volume in which there is a specific relationship between the level of activity or volume and the cost in question. Costs are described as variable or fixed with respect to a particular relevant range. 2-8 A unit cost is computed by dividing some amount of total costs (the numerator) by the related number of units (the denominator). In many cases, the numerator will include a fixed cost that will not change despite changes in the denominator. It is erroneous in those cases to multiply the unit cost by activity or volume change to predict changes in total costs at different activity or volume levels.

2-9 Manufacturing-sector companies purchase materials and components and convert them into various finished goods, for example automotive and textile companies. Merchandising-sector companies purchase and then sell tangible products without changing their basic form, for example retailing or distribution. Service-sector companies provide services or intangible products to their customers, for example, legal advice or audits. 2-10 Manufacturing companies typically have one or more of the following three types of inventory: 1. Direct materials inventory. Direct materials in stock and awaiting use in the manufacturing process. 2. Work-in-process inventory. Goods partially worked on but not yet completed. Also called work in progress. 3. Finished goods inventory. Goods completed but not yet sold. 2-11 Inventoriable costs are all costs of a product that are considered as assets in the balance sheet when they are incurred and that become cost of goods sold when the product is sold. These costs are included in work-in-process and finished goods inventory (they are inventoried) to accumulate the costs of creating these assets. Period costs are all costs in the income statement other than cost of goods sold. These costs are treated as expenses of the accounting period in which they are incurred because they are expected not to benefit future periods (because there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that such benefit exists). Expensing these costs immediately best matches expenses to revenues. 2-12 No. Service sector companies have no inventories and, hence, no inventoriable costs.
2-13 Direct material costs are the acquisition costs of all materials that eventually become part of the cost object (work in process and then finished goods), and can be traced to the cost object in an economically feasible way. Direct manufacturing labor costs include the compensation of all manufacturing labor that can be traced to the cost object (work in process and then finished goods) in an economically feasible way. Manufacturing overhead costs are all manufacturing costs that are related to the cost object (work in process and then finished goods), but cannot be traced to that cost object in an economically feasible way. Prime costs are all direct manufacturing costs (direct material and direct manufacturing labor). Conversion costs are all manufacturing costs other than direct material costs. 2-14 Overtime premium is the wage rate paid to workers (for both direct labor and indirect labor) in excess of their straight-time wage rates. Idle time is a subclassification of indirect labor that represents wages paid for unproductive time caused by lack of orders, machine breakdowns, material shortages, poor scheduling, and the like.

The total manufacturing cost per unit in requirement 1 includes $20 million of indirect manufacturing costs that are fixed irrespective of changes in the volume of output per month, while the remaining variable indirect manufacturing costs change with the production volume. Given the unit volume changes for August 2008, the use of total manufacturing cost per unit from the past month at a different unit volume level (both in aggregate and at the individual product level) will yield incorrect estimates of total costs of $600.53 million in August 2008

If the cost object is Baking Department, then anything directly associated with the Baking Department will be a direct cost. This will include: depreciation on machinery and molds Baking Department manager Materials handlers (of the Baking Department) Machinist Machine Maintenance personnel (of the Baking Department) Maintenance supplies (of the Baking Department) Of course the clay will also be a direct cost of the Baking Department, but it is already a direct cost of each kind of figurine produced.

The concept of relevant range is potentially relevant for both graphs. However, the question does not place restrictions on the unit variable costs. The relevant range for the total fixed costs is from 0 to 100 tons; 101 to 200 tons; 201 to 300 tons, and so on. Within these ranges, the total fixed costs do not change in total. 3.

The unit cost for 220 tons mined per day is $211.82, while for 180 tons it is only $196.67. This difference is caused by the fixed cost increment from 101 to 200 tons being spread over an increment of 80 tons, while the fixed cost increment from 201 to 300 tons is spread over an increment of only 20 tons.

2-23 (20 min.) Variable costs, fixed costs, relevant range. 1. Since the production capacity is 4,000 jaw breakers per month, the current annual relevant range of output is 0 to 4,000 jaw breakers 12 months = 0 to 48,000 jaw breakers. 2. Current annual fixed manufacturing costs within the relevant range are $1,000 12 = $12,000 for rent and other overhead costs, plus $6,000 10 = $600 for depreciation, totaling $12,600. The variable costs, the materials, are 10 cents per jaw breaker, or $3,600 ($0.10 per jaw breaker 3,000 jaw breakers per month 12 months) for the year. 3. If demand changes from 3,000 to 6,000 jaw breakers per month, or from 3,000 12 = 36,000 to 6,000 12 = 72,000 jaw breakers per year, Yumball will need a second machine. Assuming Yumball buys a second machine identical to the first machine, it will increase capacity from 4,000 jaw breakers per month to 8,000. The annual relevant range will be between 4,000 12 = 48,000 and 8,000 12 = 96,000 jaw breakers. Assume the second machine costs $6,000 and is depreciated using straight-line depreciation over 10 years and zero residual value, just like the first machine. This will add $600 of depreciation per year. Fixed costs for next year will increase to $13,200, $12,600 from the current year + $600 (because rent and other fixed overhead costs will remain the same at $12,000). That is, total fixed costs for next year equal $600 (depreciation on first machine) + $600 (depreciation on second machine) + $12,000 (rent and other fixed overhead costs). The variable cost per jaw breaker next year will be 90% $0.10 = $0.09. Total variable costs equal $0.09 per jaw breaker 72,000 jaw breakers = $6,480.

As president of the student association requesting a grant for the party, you should not use the per unit calculations to make your case. The person making the grant may assume an attendance of 500 students and use a low number like $7.20 per attendee to calculate the size of your grant. Instead, you should emphasize the fixed cost of $1,600 that you will incur even if no students or very few students attend the party, and try to get a grant to cover as much of the fixed costs as possible as well as a variable portion to cover as much of the $5 variable cost to the student association for each person attending the party. 2-27 (25 min.)

Note that the production costs include the $20,000 of fixed manufacturing costs but not the $10,000 of period costs. The variable cost is $1 per flange for materials, and $2 per flange ($20 per hour divided by 10 flanges per hour) for direct manufacturing labor.

2. The inventoriable (manufacturing) cost per unit for 5,000 flanges is $3 5,000 + $20,000 = $35,000. Average (unit) cost = $35,000 5,000 units = $7 per unit. This is below Freds selling price of $8.25 per flange. However, in order to make a profit, Grahams Glassworks also needs to cover the period (non-manufacturing) costs of $10,000, or $10,000 5,000 = $2 per unit. Thus total costs, both inventoriable (manufacturing) and period (non-manufacturing), for the flanges is $7 + $2 = $9. Grahams Glassworks cannot sell below Freds price of $8.25 and still make a profit on the flanges. Alternatively, At Freds price of $8.25 per flange: Revenue $8.25 5,000 Variable costs $3.00 5,000 Fixed costs Operating Loss
= =
$41,250 15,000 30,000 $ (3,750)
Grahams Glassworks cannot sell below $8.25 per flange and make a profit. At Freds price of $8.25 per flange, the company has an operating loss of $3,750. 3. If Grahams Glassworks produces 10,000 units, then total inventoriable cost will be: Variable cost ($3 $10,000 ) + fixed manufacturing costs, $20,000 = total manufacturing costs, $50,000. Average (unit) inventoriable (manufacturing) cost will be $50,000 ? 10,000 units = $5 per flange Unit total cost including both inventoriable and period costs will be ($50,000 +$10,000) 10,000 = $6 per flange, and Grahams Glassworks will be able to sell the flanges for less than Fred and still make a profit. Alternatively, At Freds price of $8.25 per flange: Revenue $8.25 10,000 Variable costs $3.00 10,000 Fixed costs Operating income
= =
$ 82,500 30,000 30,000 $ 22,500
Grahams Glassworks can sell at a price below $8.25 per flange and still make a profit. The company earns operating income of $22,500 at a price of $8.25 per flange. The company will earn operating income as long as the price exceeds $6.00 per flange. The reason the unit cost decreases significantly is that inventoriable (manufacturing) fixed costs and fixed period (nonmanufacturing) costs remain the same regardless of the number of units produced. So, as Grahams Glassworks produces more units, fixed costs are spread over more units, and cost per unit decreases. This means that if you use unit costs to make decisions about pricing, and which product to produce, you must be aware that the unit cost only applies to a particular level of output. 2-28 (2030 min.)

1. Manufacturing-sector companies purchase materials and components and convert them into different finished goods. Merchandising-sector companies purchase and then sell tangible products without changing their basic form. Service-sector companies provide services or intangible products to their customersfor example, legal advice or audits. Only manufacturing and merchandising companies have inventories of goods for sale. 2. Inventoriable costs are all costs of a product that are regarded as an asset when they are incurred and then become cost of goods sold when the product is sold. These costs for a manufacturing company are included in work-in-process and finished goods inventory (they are inventoried) to build up the costs of creating these assets. Period costs are all costs in the income statement other than cost of goods sold. These costs are treated as expenses of the period in which they are incurred because they are presumed not to benefit future periods (or because there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that such benefit exists). Expensing these costs immediately best matches expenses to revenues. 3. (a) Mineral water purchased for resale by Safewayinventoriable cost of a merchandising company.

Interpretation of statements (continuation of 2-32).
1. The schedule in 2-32 can become a Schedule of Cost of Goods Manufactured and Sold simply by including the beginning and ending finished goods inventory figures in the supporting schedule, rather than directly in the body of the income statement. Note that the term cost of goods manufactured refers to the cost of goods brought to completion (finished) during the accounting period, whether they were started before or during the current accounting period. Some of the manufacturing costs incurred are held back as costs of the ending work in process; similarly, the costs of the beginning work in process inventory become a part of the cost of goods manufactured for 2009. 2. The sales managers salary would be charged as a marketing cost as incurred by both manufacturing and merchandising companies. It is basically an operating cost that appears below the gross margin line on an income statement. In contrast, an assemblers wages would be assigned to the products worked on. Thus, the wages cost would be charged to Work-in-Process and would not be expensed until the product is transferred through Finished Goods Inventory to Cost of Goods Sold as the product is sold. 3. The direct-indirect distinction can be resolved only with respect to a particular cost object. For example, in defense contracting, the cost object may be defined as a contract. Then, a plant supervisor working only on that contract will have his or her salary charged directly and wholly to that single contract. 4. Direct materials used = $320,000,000 1,000,000 units = $320 per unit Depreciation on plant equipment = $80,000,000 1,000,000 units = $80 per unit
5. Direct materials unit cost would be unchanged at $320 per unit. Depreciation cost per unit would be $80,000,000 1,200,000 = $66.67 per unit. Total direct materials costs would rise by 20% to $384,000,000 ($320 per unit 1,200,000 units), whereas total depreciation would be unaffected at $80,000,000. 6. Unit costs are averages, and they must be interpreted with caution. The $320 direct materials unit cost is valid for predicting total costs because direct materials is a variable cost; total direct materials costs indeed change as output levels change. However, fixed costs like depreciation must be interpreted quite differently from variable costs. A common error in cost analysis is to regard all unit costs as oneas if all the total costs to which they are related are variable costs. Changes in output levels (the denominator) will affect total variable costs, but not total fixed costs. Graphs of the two costs may clarify this point; it is safer to think in terms of total costs rather than in terms of unit costs.

3. Design costs and R&amp;D costs may be regarded as product costs in case of contracting with a governmental agency. For example, if the Air Force negotiated to contract with Lockheed to build a new type of supersonic fighter plane, design costs and R&amp;D costs may be included in the contract as product costs. 4. Direct materials used = $105,000,000 1,000,000 units = $105 per unit Depreciation on plant and equipment = $9,000,000 1,000,000 units = $9 per unit
5. Direct materials unit cost would be unchanged at $105. Depreciation unit cost would be $9,000,000 1,500,000 = $6 per unit. Total direct materials costs would rise by 50% to $157,500,000 ($105 per unit 1,500,000 units). Total depreciation cost of $9,000,000 would remain unchanged. 6. In this case, equipment depreciation is a variable cost in relation to the unit output. The amount of equipment depreciation will change in direct proportion to the number of units produced. (a) Depreciation will be $4 million (1 million $4) when 1 million units are produced. (b) Depreciation will be $6 million (1.5 million $4) when 1.5 million units are produced.

2. Idle time caused by equipment breakdowns and scheduling mixups is an indirect cost of the job because it is not related to a specific job. Overtime premium caused by the heavy overall volume of work is also an indirect cost because it is not related to a particular job that happened to be worked on during the overtime hours. If, however, the overtime is the result of a demanding rush job, the overtime premium is a direct cost of that job.

2-39 (20-25 min.) Labor cost classification; ethics. 1. No. The direct manufacturing labor costs are not 20% or greater of total manufacturing costs. Direct manufacturing labor costs are $410,000 which are 16.4% of total manufacturing costs, $410,000 $2,500,000 = 16.4% 2. Bob Zixson can ask the controller to reclassify at least two of the costs that are currently reported as indirect manufacturing costs to direct manufacturing labor costs. The most logical are the fringe benefits and some of the overtime costs, particularly if it can be argued that some of the overtime was directly caused by jobs. The fringe benefits are logical because they are not only the largest, but can be argued to be a part of normal cost of manufacturing labor. Fringe benefits related to direct manufacturing labor costs together with some of the overtime premium could bring the total direct manufacturing labor cost over the minimum $500,000. Justification for reclassifying vacation and sick time is similar to that of fringe benefitsthat it is a normal cost of labor since it is part of and can be traced to the direct manufacturing laborers payment. It is harder to justify reclassifying idle time, since it is difficult to identify a specific job that the idle time relates to. Idle time is also the smallest cost item. 3. The controller should not reclassify overhead costs as direct manufacturing labor costs just so the firm can reap tax benefits particularly if the changes would violate the companys policy of computing direct manufacturing labor costs. The idea of cost classification is to allow internal (and external) decision making by clarifying what each cost item represents. Also, if costs in only the Costa Melon plant are reclassified, it will be harder for Zix to evaluate the Costa Melon plant, when compared to Zixs other plants. Nevertheless, some of the arguments presented in requirement 2 can be justified and could prompt a reevaluation of Zixs direct manufacturing labor classifications.

CHAPTER 3 COST-VOLUME-PROFIT ANALYSIS NOTATION USED IN CHAPTER 3 SOLUTIONS SP: VCU: CMU: FC: TOI: Selling price Variable cost per unit Contribution margin per unit Fixed costs Target operating income
3-1 Cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis examines the behavior of total revenues, total costs, and operating income as changes occur in the units sold, selling price, variable cost per unit, or fixed costs of a product. 3-2 1. 2. 3. The assumptions underlying the CVP analysis outlined in Chapter 3 are Changes in the level of revenues and costs arise only because of changes in the number of product (or service) units sold. Total costs can be separated into a fixed component that does not vary with the units sold and a component that is variable with respect to the units sold. When represented graphically, the behavior of total revenues and total costs are linear (represented as a straight line) in relation to units sold within a relevant range and time period. The selling price, variable cost per unit, and fixed costs are known and constant.
4.
3-3 Operating income is total revenues from operations for the accounting period minus cost of goods sold and operating costs (excluding income taxes): Operating income = Total revenues from operations Costs of goods sold and operating costs (excluding income taxes Net income is operating income plus nonoperating revenues (such as interest revenue) minus nonoperating costs (such as interest cost) minus income taxes. Chapter 3 assumes nonoperating revenues and nonoperating costs are zero. Thus, Chapter 3 computes net income as: Net income = Operating income Income taxes 3-4 Contribution margin is the difference between total revenues and total variable costs. Contribution margin per unit is the difference between selling price and variable cost per unit. Contribution-margin percentage is the contribution margin per unit divided by selling price. 3-5 Three methods to express CVP relationships are the equation method, the contribution margin method, and the graph method. The first two methods are most useful for analyzing operating income at a few specific levels of sales. The graph method is useful for visualizing the effect of sales on operating income over a wide range of quantities sold.

3-6 Breakeven analysis denotes the study of the breakeven point, which is often only an incidental part of the relationship between cost, volume, and profit. Cost-volume-profit relationship is a more comprehensive term than breakeven analysis. 3-7 CVP certainly is simple, with its assumption of output as the only revenue and cost driver, and linear revenue and cost relationships. Whether these assumptions make it simplistic depends on the decision context. In some cases, these assumptions may be sufficiently accurate for CVP to provide useful insights. The examples in Chapter 3 (the software package context in the text and the travel agency example in the Problem for Self-Study) illustrate how CVP can provide such insights. In more complex cases, the basic ideas of simple CVP analysis can be expanded. 3-8 An increase in the income tax rate does not affect the breakeven point. Operating income at the breakeven point is zero, and no income taxes are paid at this point. 3-9 Sensitivity analysis is a what-if technique that managers use to examine how a result will change if the original predicted data are not achieved or if an underlying assumption changes. The advent of the electronic spreadsheet has greatly increased the ability to explore the effect of alternative assumptions at minimal cost. CVP is one of the most widely used software applications in the management accounting area. 3-10 Examples include: Manufacturingsubstituting a robotic machine for hourly wage workers. Marketingchanging a sales force compensation plan from a percent of sales dollars to a fixed salary. Customer servicehiring a subcontractor to do customer repair visits on an annual retainer basis rather than a per-visit basis. Examples include: Manufacturingsubcontracting a component to a supplier on a per-unit basis to avoid purchasing a machine with a high fixed depreciation cost. Marketingchanging a sales compensation plan from a fixed salary to percent of sales dollars basis. Customer servicehiring a subcontractor to do customer service on a per-visit basis rather than an annual retainer basis.
3-11
3-12 Operating leverage describes the effects that fixed costs have on changes in operating income as changes occur in units sold, and hence, in contribution margin. Knowing the degree of operating leverage at a given level of sales helps managers calculate the effect of fluctuations in sales on operating incomes. 3-13 CVP analysis is always conducted for a specified time horizon. One extreme is a very short-time horizon. For example, some vacation cruises offer deep price discounts for people who offer to take any cruise on a days notice. One day prior to a cruise, most costs are fixed. The other extreme is several years. Here, a much higher percentage of total costs typically is variable. CVP itself is not made any less relevant when the time horizon lengthens. What happens is that many items classified as fixed in the short run may become variable costs with a longer time horizon.
3-
3-14 A company with multiple products can compute a breakeven point by assuming there is a constant sales mix of products at different levels of total revenue. 3-15 Yes, gross margin calculations emphasize the distinction between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing costs (gross margins are calculated after subtracting fixed manufacturing costs). Contribution margin calculations emphasize the distinction between fixed and variable costs. Hence, contribution margin is a more useful concept than gross margin in CVP analysis. 3-16 (10 min.)

3. Operating income is expected to increase by $200,000 if Ms. Schoenens proposal is accepted. The management would consider other factors before making the final decision. It is likely that product quality would improve as a result of using state of the art equipment. Due to increased automation, probably many workers will have to be laid off. Patels management will have to consider the impact of such an action on employee morale. In addition, the proposal increases the companys fixed costs dramatically. This will increase the companys operating leverage and risk. 3-18 (3540 min.) CVP analysis, changing revenues and costs.

Thailand has the lowest breakeven point since it has both the lowest fixed costs ($4,500,000) and the lowest variable cost per unit ($17.00). Hence, for a given selling price, Thailand will always have a higher operating income (or a lower operating loss) than Singapore or the U.S. The U.S. breakeven point is 1,200,000 units. Hence, with sales of only 800,000 units, it has an operating loss of $4,000,000.

This could cause some suppliers to raise the cost of their merchandise. It could force other suppliers to drop out of Dawmarts supply chain because the cost of the system change would be prohibitive.

1. See preceding table. The new store will have the same operating income under either compensation plan when the volume of sales is 54,000 pairs of shoes. This can also be calculated as the unit sales level at which both compensation plans result in the same total costs: Let Q = unit sales level at which total costs are same forboth plans $19.50Q + $360,000 + $ $81,000 = $21Q + $360,000 $1.50 Q = $81,000 Q = 54,000 pairs 2. When sales volume is above 54,000 pairs, the higher-fixed-salaries plan results in lower costs and higher operating incomes than the salary-plus-commission plan. So, for an expected volume of 55,000 pairs, the owner would be inclined to choose the higher-fixed-salaries-only plan. But it is likely that sales volume itself is determined by the nature of the compensation plan. The salary-plus-commission plan provides a greater motivation to the salespeople, and it may well be that for the same amount of money paid to salespeople, the salary-plus-commission plan generates a higher volume of sales than the fixed-salary plan. 3. Let TQ = Target number of units For the salary-only plan, $30.00TQ $19.50TQ $441,000 $10.50TQ TQ TQ For the salary-plus-commission plan, $30.00TQ $21.00TQ $360,000 $9.00TQ TQ TQ

The decision regarding the salary plan depends heavily on predictions of demand. For instance, the salary plan offers the same operating income at 58,000 units as the commission plan offers at 58,667 units. 4.

1. Contribution margin assuming fixed rental arrangement = $50 $30 = $20 per bouquet Fixed costs = $5,000 Breakeven point = $5,000 $20 per bouquet = 250 bouquets Contribution margin assuming $10 per arrangement rental agreement = $50 $30 $10 = $10 per bouquet Fixed costs = $0 Breakeven point = $0 $10 per bouquet = 0 (i.e. EB makes a profit no matter how few bouquets it sells) 2. Let x denote the number of bouquets EB must sell for it to be indifferent between the fixed rent and royalty agreement. To calculate x we solve the following equation. $50 x $30 x $5,000 = $50 x $40 x $20 x $5,000 = $10 x $10 x = $5,000 x = $5,000 $10 = 500 bouquets For sales between 0 to 500 bouquets, EB prefers the royalty agreement because in this range, $10 x&gt;$20 x $5,000. For sales greater than 500 bouquets, EB prefers the fixed rent agreement because in this range, $20 x $5,000&gt;$10 x . 3. If we assume the $5 savings in variable costs applies to both options, we solve the following equation for x . $50 x $25 x $5,000 = $50 x $35 x $25 x $5,000 = $15 x $10 x = $5,000 x = $5,000 $10 per bouquet = 500 bouquets The answer is the same as in Requirement 2, that is, for sales between 0 to 500 bouquets, EB prefers the royalty agreement because in this range, $15 x&gt;$25 x $5,000. For sales greater than 500 bouquets, EB prefers the fixed rent agreement because in this range, $25 x $5,000&gt;$15 x . 4. Fixed rent agreement:

EB should choose the fixed rent agreement because the expected value is higher than the royalty agreement.

Revenue = Variable costs + Fixed costs $400Q = $200Q + $100,000 $200Q = $100,000 Q = 500 units Breakeven can also be calculated using contribution margin per unit. Contribution margin per unit = Selling price Variable cost per unit = $400 $200 = $200 Breakeven = Fixed Costs Contribution margin per unit = $100,000 $200 = 500 units 1b. To achieve its net income objective, Almo Company must sell 2,500 units. This amount represents the point where revenues equal total costs plus the corresponding operating income objective to achieve net income of $240,000. Revenue = Variable costs + Fixed costs + [Net income (1 Tax rate)] $400Q = $200Q + $100,000 + [$240,000 (1 0.4)] $400 Q = $200Q + $100,000 + $400,000 Q = 2,500 units 2. To achieve its net income objective, Almo Company should select the first alternative where the sales price is reduced by $40, and 2,700 units are sold during the remainder of the year.

The calculations indicate that at sales of $26,000,000, a percentage change in sales and contribution margin will result in 2.89 times that percentage change in operating income if Marston continues to use sales agents and 3.51 times that percentage change in operating income if Marston employs its own sales staff. The higher contribution margin per dollar of sales and higher fixed costs gives Marston more operating leverage, that is, greater benefits (increases in operating income) if revenues increase but greater risks (decreases in operating income) if revenues decrease. Marston also needs to consider the skill levels and incentives under the two alternatives. Sales agents have more incentive compensation and hence may be more motivated to increase sales. On the other hand, Marstons own sales force may be more knowledgeable and skilled in selling the companys products. That is, the sales volume itself will be affected by who sells and by the nature of the compensation plan.

1. Sales of standard and deluxe carriers are in the ratio of 150,000 : 50,000. So for every 1 unit of deluxe, 3 (150,000 50,000) units of standard are sold.

Unit contribution margins are: Standard: $20 $14 = $6; Deluxe: $30 $18 = $12 If only Standard carriers were sold, the breakeven point would be: $1,200,000 $6 = 200,000 units. If only Deluxe carriers were sold, the breakeven point would be: $1,200,000 $12 = 100,000 units
3. Operating income = Contribution margin of Standard + Contribution margin of Deluxe - Fixed costs = 180,000($6) + 20,000($12) $1,200,000 = $1,080,000 + $240,000 $1,200,000 = $120,000
Sales of standard and deluxe carriers are in the ratio of 180,000 : 20,000. So for every 1 unit of deluxe, 9 (180,000 20,000) units of standard are sold. Contribution margin of the bundle = 9 $6 + 1 $12 = $54 + $12 = $66 $1, 200,000 Breakeven point in bundles = = 18,182 bundles (rounded up) $66 Breakeven point in units is: Standard carrier: 18,182 bundles 9 units per bundle 163,638 units Deluxe carrier: 18,182 bundles 1 unit per bundle 18,182 units Total number of units to breakeven 181,820 units Alternatively, Let Q = Number of units of Deluxe product to break even 9Q = Number of units of Standard product to break even $20(9Q) + $30Q $14(9Q) $18Q $1,200,000 $180Q + $30Q $126Q $18Q $66Q Q 9Q = = = = = 0 $1,200,000 $1,200,000 18,182 units of Deluxe (rounded up) 163,638 units of Standard
The breakeven point is 163,638 Standard + 18,182 Deluxe, a total of 181,820 units. The major lesson of this problem is that changes in the sales mix change breakeven points and operating incomes. In this example, the budgeted and actual total sales in number of units were identical, but the propor tion of the product having the higher contribution margin declined. Operating income suffered, falling from $300,000 to $120,000. Moreover, the breakeven point rose from 160,000 to 181,820 units.

4. Incorrect reporting of environmental costs with the goal of continuing operations is unethical. In assessing the situation, the specific Standards of Ethical Conduct for Management Accountants (described in Exhibit 1-7) that the management accountant should consider are listed below.
Competence Clear reports using relevant and reliable information should be prepared. Preparing reports on the basis of incorrect environmental costs to make the companys performance look better than it is violates competence standards. It is unethical for Bush not to report environmental costs to make the plants performance look good. Integrity The management accountant has a responsibility to avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest and advise all appropriate parties of any potential conflict. Bush may be tempted to report lower environmental costs to please Lemond and Woodall and save the jobs of his colleagues. This action, however, violates the responsibility for integrity. The Standards of Ethical Conduct require the management accountant to communicate favorable as well as unfavorable information. Credibility The management accountants Standards of Ethical Conduct require that information should be fairly and objectively communicated and that all relevant information should be disclosed. From a management accountants standpoint, underreporting environmental costs to make performance look good would violate the standard of objectivity.
Bush should indicate to Lemond that estimates of environmental costs and liabilities should be included in the analysis. If Lemond still insists on modifying the numbers and reporting lower environmental costs, Bush should raise the matter with one of Lemonds superiors. If after taking all these steps, there is continued pressure to understate environmental costs, Bush should consider resigning from the company and not engage in unethical behavior. 3-49 (35 min.)

3. The optimal production plan is to produce 120,000 units at the Peoria plant and 72,000 units at the Moline plant. The full capacity of the Peoria plant, 120,000 units (400 units 300 days), should be used because the contribution from these units is higher at all levels of production than is the contribution from units produced at the Moline plant. Contribution margin per plant: Peoria, 96,000 $64 Peoria 24,000 ($64 $3) Moline, 72,000 $48 Total contribution margin Deduct total fixed costs Operating income
$ 6,144,000 1,464,000 3,456,000 11,064,000 6,969,600 $ 4,094,400
The contribution margin is higher when 120,000 units are produced at the Peoria plant and 72,000 units at the Moline plant. As a result, operating income will also be higher in this case since total fixed costs for the division remain unchanged regardless of the quantity produced at each plant.

CHAPTER 4 JOB COSTING 4-1
Cost poola grouping of individual cost items. Cost tracingthe assigning of direct costs to the chosen cost object. Cost allocationthe assigning of indirect costs to the chosen cost object. Cost-allocation basea factor that links in a systematic way an indirect cost or group of indirect costs to a cost object.
4-2 In a job-costing system, costs are assigned to a distinct unit, batch, or lot of a product or service. In a process-costing system, the cost of a product or service is obtained by using broad averages to assign costs to masses of identical or similar units. 4-3 An advertising campaign for Pepsi is likely to be very specific to that individual client. Job costing enables all the specific aspects of each job to be identified. In contrast, the processing of checking account withdrawals is similar for many customers. Here, process costing can be used to compute the cost of each checking account withdrawal. 4-4 The seven steps in job costing are: (1) identify the job that is the chosen cost object, (2) identify the direct costs of the job, (3) select the cost-allocation bases to use for allocating indirect costs to the job, (4) identify the indirect costs associated with each cost-allocation base, (5) compute the rate per unit of each cost-allocation base used to allocate indirect costs to the job, (6) compute the indirect costs allocated to the job, and (7) compute the total cost of the job by adding all direct and indirect costs assigned to the job. 4-5 Two major cost objects that managers focus on in companies using job costing are (1) products or jobs, and (2) responsibility centers or departments. 4-6 Three major source documents used in job-costing systems are (1) job cost record or job cost sheet, a document that records and accumulates all costs assigned to a specific job, starting when work begins (2) materials requisition record, a document that contains information about the cost of direct materials used on a specific job and in a specific department; and (3) labor-time record, a document that contains information about the labor time used on a specific job and in a specific department. 4-7 The main concern with the source documents of job cost records is the accuracy of the records. Problems occurring in this area include incorrect recording of quantity or dollar amounts, materials recorded on one job being borrowed and used on other jobs, and erroneous job numbers being assigned to materials or labor inputs. 4-8 a. b. Two reasons for using an annual budget period are The numerator reasonthe longer the time period, the less the influence of seasonal patterns, and The denominator reasonthe longer the time period, the less the effect of variations in output levels on the allocation of fixed costs.
4-1
4-9 Actual costing and normal costing differ in their use of actual or budgeted indirect cost rates: Actual Normal Costing Costing Direct-cost rates Actual rates Actual rates Indirect-cost rates Actual rates Budgeted rates Each costing method uses the actual quantity of the direct-cost input and the actual quantity of the cost-allocation base. 4-10 A house construction firm can use job cost information (a) to determine the profitability of individual jobs, (b) to assist in bidding on future jobs, and (c) to evaluate professionals who are in charge of managing individual jobs. 4-11 The statement is false. In a normal costing system, the Manufacturing Overhead Control account will not, in general, equal the amounts in the Manufacturing Overhead Allocated account. The Manufacturing Overhead Control account aggregates the actual overhead costs incurred while Manufacturing Overhead Allocated allocates overhead costs to jobs on the basis of a budgeted rate times the actual quantity of the cost-allocation base. Underallocation or overallocation of indirect (overhead) costs can arise because of (a) the Numerator reasonthe actual overhead costs differ from the budgeted overhead costs, and (b) the Denominator reasonthe actual quantity used of the allocation base differs from the budgeted quantity. 4-12 Debit entries to Work-in-Process Control represent increases in work in process. Examples of debit entries under normal costing are (a) direct materials used (credit to Materials Control), (b) direct manufacturing labor billed to job (credit to Wages Payable Control), and (c) manufacturing overhead allocated to job (credit to Manufacturing Overhead Allocated). 4-13 Alternative ways to make end-of-period adjustments for underallocated or overallocated overhead are as follows: (i) Proration based on the total amount of indirect costs allocated (before proration) in the ending balances of work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold. (ii) Proration based on total ending balances (before proration) in work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold. (iii) Year-end write-off to Cost of Goods Sold. (iv) Restatement of all overhead entries using actual indirect cost rates rather than budgeted indirect cost rates. 4-14 A company might use budgeted costs rather than actual costs to compute direct labor rates because it may be difficult to trace direct labor costs to jobs as they are completed (for example, because bonuses are only known at the end of the year). 4-15 Modern technology such as electronic data interchange (EDI) is helpful to managers because it provides them with quick and accurate product-cost information that facilitates the management and control of jobs.

This, of course equals the actual manufacturing overhead costs. All actual overhead costs are allocated to products. Hence, there is no under- or overallocatead overhead.

3. Normal costing enables Anderson to report a job cost as soon as the job is completed, assuming that both the direct materials and direct labor costs are known at the time of use. Once the 900 direct labor-hours are known for the Laguna Model (June 2007), Anderson can compute the $187,726 cost figure using normal costing. Anderson can use this information to manage the costs of the Laguna Model job as well as to bid on similar jobs later in the year. In contrast, Anderson has to wait until the December 2007 year-end to compute the $180,526 cost of the Laguna Model using actual costing. Although not required, the following overview diagram summarizes Anderson Constructions job-costing system.

At the budgeted revenues of $20,000,000, Taylors operating income of $2,000,000 equals 10% of revenues. Markup rate = $20,000,000 $5,000,000 = 400% of direct professional labor costs

As calculated in requirement 2, the bid price to earn a 10% income-to-revenue margin is 400% of direct professional costs. Therefore, Taylor should bid 4 $9,000 = $36,000 for the Red Rooster job. Bid price to earn target operating income-to-revenue margin of 10% can also be calculated as follows: Let R = revenue to earn target income R 0.10R = $32,400 0.90R = $32,400 R = $32,400 0.90 = $36,000 Direct costs $ 9,000 Indirect costs 23,400 Operating income 3,600 Bid price $36,000

(b) The full cost of Job 332, using the budgeted variable overhead rate of 60% for JulySeptember and an annual fixed overhead rate of 100%, is $25,600. 3. If Printers, Inc. sets prices at a markup of costs, then prices based on costs calculated as in Requirement 2 (rather than as in Requirement 1) would be more effective in deterring clients from sending in last-minute, congestion-causing orders in the JanuaryMarch time frame. In this calculation, more variable manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to jobs in the first quarter, reflecting the larger costs of that quarter caused by higher overtime and facility and machine maintenance. This method better captures the cost of congestion during the first quarter.

All three costing systems use the actual professional labor time of 120 hours. The budgeted 110 hours for the Pierre Enterprises audit job is not used in job costing. However, Chirac may have used the 110 hour number in bidding for the audit. The actual costing figure of $12,720 exceeds the normal costing figure of $12,360 because the actual indirect-cost rate ($48) exceeds the budgeted indirect-cost rate ($45). The normal costing figure of $12,360 is less than the variation of normal costing (based on budgeted rates for direct costs) figure of $12,600, because the actual direct-cost rate ($58) is less than the budgeted direct-cost rate ($60).

Solomon likely assumes that all its manufacturing overhead cost items are not homogeneous. Specifically, those in the Machining Department have a cause-and-effect relationship with machine-hours, while those in the Finishing Department have a cause-and-effect relationship with direct manufacturing labor costs. Solomon believes that the benefits of using two cost pools (more accurate product costs and better ability to manage costs) exceeds the costs of implementing a more complex system.

The Richardson and Punch jobs differ in their use of resources. The Richardson job has a mix of 60% partners and 40% associates, while Punch has a mix of 20% partners and 80% associates. Thus, the Richardson job is a relatively high user of the more costly partner-related resources (both direct partner costs and indirect partner secretarial support). The refined-costing system in Problem 4-32 increases the reported cost in Problem 4-32 for the Richardson job by 41.7% (from $12,000 to $17,000).

3. Alternative (c) is theoretically preferred over (a) and (b). Alternative (c) yields the same ending balances in work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold that would have been reported had actual indirect cost rates been used. Chapter 4 also discusses an adjusted allocation rate approach that results in the same ending balances as does alternative (c). This approach operates via a restatement of the indirect costs allocated to all the individual jobs worked on during the year using the actual indirect cost rate. 4-35 1a. (15 min.)

3. The first method is simple and Cost of Goods Sold accounts for 80% of the three account amounts. The amount of overallocated and underallocated overhead is also immaterial. Allocation to the other two accounts is minimal. Therefore, write-off to cost of goods sold is the most cost effective alternative.

Write-off to Cost of Goods Sold will increase (debit) Cost of Goods Sold by $60,000. Hence, Cost of Goods Sold = $900,000 + $60,000 = $960,000. Proration based on ending balances (before proration) in Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold.
Account balances in each account after proration follows:

8. Needhams operating income using write-off to Cost of Goods Sold and Proration based on ending balances (before proration) follows:
Write-off to Cost of Goods Sold Revenues Cost of goods sold Gross margin Marketing and distribution costs Operating income/(loss) $1,090,000 960,000 130,000 140,000 $ (10,000) Proration Based on Ending Balances $1,090,000 943,200 146,800 140,000 $ 6,800
9. If the purpose is to report the most accurate inventory and cost of goods sold figures, the preferred method is to prorate based on the manufacturing overhead allocated component in the inventory and cost of goods sold accounts. Proration based on the balances in Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold will equal the proration based on the manufacturing overhead allocated component if the proportions of direct costs to manufacturing overhead costs are constant in the Work in Process, Finished Goods and Cost of Goods Sold accounts. Even if this is not the case, the prorations based on Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold will better approximate the results if actual cost rates had been used rather than the write-off to Cost of Goods Sold method. Another consideration in Needhams decision about how to dispose of underallocated manufacturing overhead is the effects on operating income. The write-off to Cost of Goods Sold will lead to an operating loss. Proration based on the balances in Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold will help Needham avoid the loss and show an operating income. The main merit of the write-off to Cost of Goods Sold method is its simplicity. However, accuracy and the effect on operating income favor the preferred and recommended proration approach.

(ii) Issue guidelines detailing acceptable and unacceptable billing practices by contractors. For example, prohibiting the use of double-counting cost allocation methods by contractors. (iii) Issue guidelines detailing acceptable and unacceptable procurement practices by contractors. For example, if a contractor purchases from a family-related company, require that the contractor obtain quotes from at least two other bidders. (iv) Employ auditors who aggressively monitor the bills submitted by contractors. (v) Ask contractors for details regarding determination of costs.

5. I would choose the method in 4c because this method results in account balances based on actual overhead allocation rates. The account balances before proration in TIP and CCT are significant and underallocated overhead is material. Furthermore, the ratio of ending balances in TIP and CCT is different from the ratio of overhead allocated to each of these accounts in June.

CHAPTER 5 ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING AND ACTIVITY-BASED MANAGEMENT 5-1 Broad averaging (or peanut-butter costing) describes a costing approach that uses broad averages for assigning (or spreading, as in spreading peanut butter) the cost of resources uniformly to cost objects when the individual products or services, in fact, use those resources in non-uniform ways. Broad averaging, by ignoring the variation in the consumption of resources by different cost objects, can lead to inaccurate and misleading cost data, which in turn can negatively impact the marketing and operating decisions made based on that information. 5-2 Overcosting may result in competitors entering a market and taking market share for products that a company erroneously believes are low-margin or even unprofitable. Undercosting may result in companies selling products on which they are in fact losing money, when they erroneously believe them to be profitable. 5-3 Costing system refinement means making changes to a simple costing system that reduces the use of broad averages for assigning the cost of resources to cost objects and provides better measurement of the costs of overhead resources used by different cost objects. Three guidelines for refinement are 1. Classify as many of the total costs as direct costs as is economically feasible. 2. Expand the number of indirect cost pools until each of these pools is more homogenous. 3. Use the cause-and-effect criterion, when possible, to identify the cost-allocation base for each indirect-cost pool. 5-4 An activity-based approach refines a costing system by focusing on individual activities as the fundamental cost objects. It uses the cost of these activities as the basis for assigning costs to other cost objects such as products or services. 5-5 Four levels of a cost hierarchy are (i) Output unit-level costs: costs of activities performed on each individual unit of a product or service. (ii) Batch-level costs: costs of activities related to a group of units of products or services rather than to each individual unit of product or service. (iii) Product-sustaining costs or service-sustaining costs: costs of activities undertaken to support individual products or services regardless of the number of units or batches in which the units are produced. (iv) Facility-sustaining costs: costs of activities that cannot be traced to individual products or services but support the organization as a whole.
5-6 It is important to classify costs into a cost hierarchy because costs in different cost pools relate to different cost-allocation bases and not all cost-allocation bases are unit-level. For example, an allocation base like setup hours is a batch-level allocation base, and design hours is a product-sustaining base, both insensitive to the number of units in a batch or the number of units of product produced. If costs were not classified into a cost hierarchy, the alternative would be to consider all costs as unit-level costs, leading to misallocation of those costs that are not unit-level costs. 5-1
5-7 An ABC approach focuses on activities as the fundamental cost objects. The costs of these activities are built up to compute the costs of products, and services, and so on. Simple costing systems have one or a few indirect cost pools, irrespective of the heterogeneity in the facility while ABC systems have multiple indirect cost pools. An ABC approach attempts to use cost drivers as the allocation base for indirect costs, whereas a simple costing system generally does not. The ABC approach classifies as many indirect costs as direct costs as possible. A simple costing system has more indirect costs. 5-8 Four decisions for which ABC information is useful are 1. pricing and product mix decisions, 2. cost reduction and process improvement decisions, 3. product design decisions, and 4. decisions for planning and managing activities.
5-9 No. Department indirect-cost rates are similar to activity-cost rates if (1) a single activity accounts for a sizable fraction of the departments costs, or (2) significant costs are incurred on different activities within a department but each activity has the same cost-allocation base, or (3) significant costs are incurred on different activities with different cost-allocation bases within a department but different products use resources from the different activity areas in the same proportions. 5-10 Tell-tale signs that indicate when ABC systems are likely to provide the most benefits are as follows: 1. Significant amounts of indirect costs are allocated using only one or two cost pools. 2. All or most indirect costs are identified as output-unit-level costs (i.e., few indirect costs are described as batch-level, product-sustaining, or facility-sustaining costs). 3. Products make diverse demands on resources because of differences in volume, process steps, batch size, or complexity. 4. Products that a company is well suited to make and sell show small profits, whereas products that a company is less suited to produce and sell show large profits. 5. Operations staff has significant disagreements with the accounting staff about the costs of manufacturing and marketing products and services. 5-11 The main costs and limitations of ABC are the measurements necessary to implement the systems. Even basic ABC systems require many calculations to determine costs of products and services. Activity-cost rates often need to be updated regularly. Very detailed ABC systems are costly to operate and difficult to understand. Sometimes the allocations necessary to calculate activity costs often result in activity-cost pools and quantities of cost-allocation bases being measured with error. When measurement errors are large, activity-cost information can be misleading. 5-12 No, ABC systems apply equally well to service companies such as banks, railroads, hospitals, and accounting firms, as well merchandising companies such as retailers and distributors. 5-13 No. An activity-based approach should be adopted only if its expected benefits exceed its expected costs. It is not always a wise investment. If the jobs, products or services are alike in the way they consume indirect costs of a company, then a simple costing system will suffice. 5-2
5-14 Increasing the number of indirect-cost pools does NOT guarantee increased accuracy of product or service costs. If the existing cost pool is already homogeneous, increasing the number of cost pools will not increase accuracy. If the existing cost pool is not homogeneous, accuracy will increase only if the increased cost pools themselves increase in homogeneity vis-a-vis the single cost pool. 5-15 The controller faces a difficult challenge. The benefits of a better accounting system show up in improved decisions by managers. It is important that the controller have the support of these managers when seeking increased investments in accounting systems. Statements by these managers showing how their decisions will be improved by a better accounting system are the controllers best arguments when seeking increased funding. For example, the new system will result in more accurate product costs which will influence pricing and product mix decisions. The new system can also be used to reduce product costs which will lower selling prices. As a result, the customer will benefit from the new system. 5-16 (20 min.) 1. Cost hierarchy.
a. Indirect manufacturing labor costs of $1,200,000 support direct manufacturing labor and are output unit-level costs. Direct manufacturing labor generally increases with output units, and so will the indirect costs to support it. b. Batch-level costs are costs of activities that are related to a group of units of a product rather than each individual unit of a product. Purchase order-related costs (including costs of receiving materials and paying suppliers) of $600,000 relate to a group of units of product and are batch-level costs. c. Cost of indirect materials of $350,000 generally changes with labor hours or machine hours which are unit-level costs. Therefore, indirect material costs are output unitlevel costs. d. Setup costs of $700,000 are batch-level costs because they relate to a group of units of product produced after the machines are set up. e. Costs of designing processes, drawing process charts, and making engineering changes for individual products, $900,000, are product-sustaining because they relate to the costs of activities undertaken to support individual products regardless of the number of units or batches in which the product is produced. f. Machine-related overhead costs (depreciation and maintenance) of $1,200,000 are output unit-level costs because they change with the number of units produced. g. Plant management, plant rent, and insurance costs of $950,000 are facility-sustaining costs because the costs of these activities cannot be traced to individual products or services but support the organization as a whole.

2. The complex boom box made in many batches will use significantly more batch-level overhead resources compared to the simple boom box that is made in a few batches. In addition, the complex boom box will use more product-sustaining overhead resources because it is complex. Because each boom box requires the same amount of machine-hours, both the simple and the complex boom box will be allocated the same amount of overhead costs per boom box if Teledor uses only machine-hours to allocate overhead costs to boom boxes. As a result, the complex boom box will be undercosted (it consumes a relatively high level of resources but is reported to have a relatively low cost) and the simple boom box will be overcosted (it consumes a relatively low level of resources but is reported to have a relatively high cost). 3. Using the cost hierarchy to calculate activity-based costs can help Teledor to identify both the costs of individual activities and the cost of activities demanded by individual products. Teledor can use this information to manage its business in several ways: a. Pricing and product mix decisions. Knowing the resources needed to manufacture and sell different types of boom boxes can help Teledor to price the different boom boxes and also identify which boom boxes are more profitable. It can then emphasize its more profitable products. b. Teledor can use information about the costs of different activities to improve processes and reduce costs of the different activities. Teledor could have a target of reducing costs of activities (setups, order processing, etc.) by, say, 3% and constantly seek to eliminate activities and costs (such as engineering changes) that its customers perceive as not adding value. c. Teledor management can identify and evaluate new designs to improve performance by analyzing how product and process designs affect activities and costs. d. Teledor can use its ABC systems and cost hierarchy information to plan and manage activities. What activities should be performed in the period and at what cost? 5-17 1. (25 min.)

At a cost per test-hour of $16, the simple costing system undercosts heat testing ($17.96) and overcosts stress testing ($12.73). The reason is that heat testing uses direct labor, setup, and design resources per hour more intensively than stress testing. Heat tests are more complex, take longer to set up, and are more difficult to design. The simple costing system assumes that testing costs per hour are the same for heat testing and stress testing. 3. The ABC system better captures the resources needed for heat testing and stress testing because it identifies all the various activities undertaken when performing the tests and recognizes the levels of the cost hierarchy at which costs vary. Hence, the ABC system generates more accurate product costs. Plymouths management can use the information from the ABC system to make better pricing and product mix decisions. For example, it might decide to increase the prices charged for the more costly heat testing and consider reducing prices on the less costly stress testing. Plymouth should watch if competitors are underbidding Plymouth in stress testing, and causing it to lose business. Plymouth can also use ABC information to reduce costs by eliminating processes and activities that do not add value, identifying and evaluating new methods to do testing that reduce the activities needed to do the tests, reducing the costs of doing various activities, and planning and managing activities.

Both clients use 40 hours of professional labor time. However, Seattle Dominion uses a higher proportion of Wolfsons time (15 hours), which is more costly. This attracts the highest supportservices charge when allocated on the basis of direct professional labor costs. 3. Assume that the Wolfson Group uses a cause-and-effect criterion when choosing the allocation base for support services. You could use several pieces of evidence to determine whether professional labor costs or hours is the driver of support-service costs: a. Interviews with personnel. For example, staff in the major cost categories in support services could be interviewed to determine whether Wolfson requires more support per hour than, say, Anderson. The professional labor costs allocation base implies that an hour of Wolfsons time requires 6.25 ($500 $80) times more support-service dollars than does an hour of Andersons time. b. Analysis of tasks undertaken for selected clients. For example, if computer-related costs are a sizable part of support costs, you could determine if there was a systematic relationship between the percentage involvement of professionals with high billing rates on cases and the computer resources consumed for those cases. 5-19 (20 min.)

The variable manufacturing overhead allocated to United Motors increases by 157% under the department rates, the overhead allocated to Holden decreases by about 11% and the overhead allocated to Leland increases by about 10%. The three contracts differ sizably in the way they use the resources of the three departments. The percentage of total driver units in each department used by the companies is: Cost Department Driver Design CAD-design hours Engineering Engineering hours Production Machine hours United Motors 28% 19 3 Holden Motors 51% 16 70 Leland Vehicle 21% 65 27
The United Motors contract uses only 3% of total machines hours in 2004, yet uses 28% of CAD design-hours and 19% of engineering hours. The result is that the plantwide rate, based on machine hours, will greatly underestimate the cost of resources used on the United Motors contract. This explains the 157% increase in indirect costs assigned to the United Motors contract when department rates are used. In contrast, the Holden Motors contract uses less of design (51%) and engineering (16%) than of machine-hours (70%). Hence, the use of department rates will report lower indirect costs for Holden Motors than does a plantwide rate. Holden Motors was probably complaining under the use of the simple system because its contract was being overcosted relative to its consumption of MOH resources. United, on the other hand was having its contract undercosted and underpriced by the simple system. Assuming that AP is an efficient and competitive supplier, if the new department-based rates are used to price contracts, United will be unhappy. AP should explain to United how the calculation was done, and point out Uniteds high use of design and engineering resources relative to production machine hours. Discuss ways of reducing the consumption of those resources, if possible, and show willingness to partner with them to do so. If the price rise is going to be steep, perhaps offer to phase in the new prices. 4. Other than for pricing, AP can also use the information from the department-based system to examine and streamline its own operations so that there is maximum value-added from all indirect resources. It might set targets over time to reduce both the consumption of each 5-8
indirect resource and the unit costs of the resources. The department-based system gives AP more opportunities for targeted cost management. 5. It would not be worthwhile to further refine the cost system into an ABC system if there wasnt much variation among contracts in the consumption of activities within a department. If, for example, most activities within the design department were, in fact, driven by CAD-design hours, then the more refined system would be more costly and no more accurate than the department-based cost system. Even if there was sufficient variation, considering the relative sizes of the 3 department cost pools, it may only be cost-effective to further analyze the engineering cost pool, which consumes 78% ($240,000 $308,600) of the manufacturing overhead. 5-20 (1015 min.)

Relative to the ABC system, the simple costing system overcosts standard jobs and undercosts special jobs. Both types of jobs need 10 machine hours per job, so in the simple system, they are each allocated $671.70 in indirect costs. But, the ABC study reveals that each standard job consumes less of the indirect resources such as setups, purchase orders, and design costs than a special job, and this is reflected in the higher indirect costs allocated to special jobs in the ABC system. 4. Quikprint can use the information revealed by the ABC system to change its pricing based on the ABC costs. Under the simple system, Quikprint was making a gross margin of 12% on each standard job (($1,200 $1,051.70) $1,200) and 25% on each special job (($1,500 $1,121.70) $1,500). But, the ABC system reveals that it is actually making a gross margin of about 21% (($1,200 $947) $1,200) on each standard job and about 11% (($1,500 $1,331) $1,500) on each special job. Depending on the market competitiveness, Quikprint may either want to reprice the different types of jobs, or, it may choose to market standard jobs more aggressively than before. Quikprint can also use the ABC information to improve its own operations. It could examine each of the indirect cost categories and analyze whether it would be possible to deliver the same level of service, but consume fewer indirect resources, or find a way to reduce the perunit-cost-driver cost of some of those indirect resources.

The overall cost of educating each student is $15,600. Of this, $7,080 (or 45%) is spent on academic instruction and $3,320 (or 21%) is spent on administration. 2. Cost of ice hockey program $ 300,000 Total cost of activities without ice hockey program = $7,800,000 $300,000 = $7,500,000 Per student cost of educational program without hockey = $7,500,000 500 = $ 15,000 Net cost of ice hockey program with $1,000 fee = $300,000 (30 $1,000) = $ 270,000 Total cost of activities with ice hockey program fee = $7,500,000 + $270,000 = $7,770,000 Per student cost of educational program with hockey fee = $7,770,000 500 = $ 15,540

$2,950,000 $ 590,000
Most of the costs at Harmon school are fixed in the short-run. So, Smith must try to recruit more students to the school. If, in the long run, it seems like the student population is going to be stable at around 500, he should plan how some of the excess capacity can be cut back so that the fixed school capacity is better utilized, that is, he should work to reduce the cost of excess capacity. One problem with that plan is that cutting excess academic instruction capacity may eventually mean reducing the number of sections in each grade and letting teachers go, and if this involves the loss of experienced teachers, that could cause long-term damage to the school. Unrelated to the excess capacity issue, but with the aim of improving the schools economics, he should consider doing away with expensive activities like the ice hockey program which raises the cost per student substantially, even after a large fee is charged from students who choose to play the sport.

The baked goods line drops sizably in profitability when ABC is used. Although it constitutes 31.67% of COGS, it uses a higher percentage of total resources in each activity area, especially the high cost delivery activity area. In contrast, frozen products draws a much lower percentage of total resources used in each activity area than its percentage of total COGS. Hence, under ABC, frozen products is much more profitable. Family Supermarkets may want to explore ways to increase sales of frozen products. It may also want to explore price increases on baked goods.

The analysis indicates that customers profitability (loss) contribution varies widely from (14.2%) to 15.0%. Immediate attention to Chain 2 is required which is currently showing a loss contribution. The chain has a disproportionate number of both regular orders and rush orders. Villeagas should work with the management of Chain 2 to find ways to reduce the number of orders, while maintaining or increasing the sales volume. If this is not possible, Villeagas should consider dropping Chain 2, if it can save the customer-related costs. Chain 1 has a disproportionate number of the items returned as well as sale returns. The causes of these should be investigated so that the profitability contribution of Chain 1 could be improved.

There is much evidence of product-cost cross-subsidization. Cost per Pound Retail Institutional Simple costing system $1.133 $1.133 ABC system $1.190 $0.620
Assuming the ABC numbers are more accurate, potato cuts sold to the retail market are undercosted while potato cuts sold to the institutional market are overcosted. The simple costing system assumes each product uses all the activity areas in a homogeneous way. This is not the case. Institutional sales use sizably less resources in the cutting area and the packaging area. The percentages of total costs for each cost category are as follows: Retail Institutional Total Direct costs Direct materials 90.0% 10.0% 100.0% Packaging 95.7 4.3 100.0 Indirect costs Cleaning 90.0 10.0 100.0 Cutting 93.5 6.5 100.0 Packaging 97.3 2.7 100.0 Units produced 90.0% 10.0% 100.0% Idaho can use the revised cost information for a variety of purposes: a. Pricing/product emphasis decisions. The sizable drop in the reported cost of potatoes sold in the institutional market makes it possible that Idaho was overpricing potato products in this market. It lost the bid for a large institutional contract with a bid 30% above the winning bid. With its revised product cost dropping from $1.133 to $0.620, Idaho could have bid much lower and still made a profit. An increased emphasis on the institutional market appears warranted. b. Product design decisions. ABC provides a road map as to how to reduce the costs of individual products. The relative components of costs are: Retail Direct costs Direct materials Packaging Indirect costs Cleaning Cutting Packaging Total costs 12.6% 16.8 10.1 20.2 40.3 100.0% Institutional 24.20% 12.90 19.35 24.20 19.35 100.00%
Packaging-related costs constitute 57.1% (16.8% + 40.3%) of total costs of the retail product line. Design efforts that reduce packaging costs can have a big impact on reducing total unit costs for retail. c. Process improvements. Each activity area is now highlighted as a separate cost. The three indirect cost areas comprise over 60% of total costs for each product, indicating the upside from improvements in the efficiency of processes in these activity areas. 5-20

3. The manufacturing manager likely would find the ABC job-costing system useful in cost management. Unlike direct manufacturing labor costs, the seven indirect cost pools are systematically linked to the activity areas at the plant. The result is more accurate product costing. Productivity measures can be developed that directly link to the management accounting system. Marketing managers can use ABC information to price jobs as well as to advise customers about how selecting different product features will affect price.

237.50 36.80 36.00 112.00 132.00 55.50 609.80 $ 437.20
The assumption that the Robinson and Farrel accounts exceed $1,000 every month and the Skerrett account is less than $1,000 each month means the monthly charges apply only to Skerrett. One student with a banking background noted that in this solution 100% of the spread is attributed to the depositor side of the bank. He noted that often the spread is divided between the depositor side and the lending side of the bank. 2. Cross-subsidization across individual Premier Accounts occurs when profits made on some accounts are offset by losses on other accounts. The aggregate profitability on the three customers is $437.20. The Farrel account is highly profitable ($593.20), while the Robinson account is sizably unprofitable. The Skerrett account shows a small profit but only because of the $240 monthly fees. It is unlikely that Skerrett will keep paying these high fees and that FIB would want Skerret to pay such high fees from a customer relationship standpoint. The facts also suggest that the customers do not use the bank services uniformly. For example, Robinson and Skerret have a lot of transactions with the teller or ATM, and also inquire about their account balances more often than Farrell. This suggests cross-subsidization. FIB should be very concerned about the cross-subsidization. Competition likely would understand that high-balance low-activity type accounts (such as Farrel) are highly profitable. Offering free services to these customers is not likely to retain these accounts if other banks offer higher interest rates. Competition likely will reduce the interest rate spread FIB can earn on the high-balance low-activity accounts they are able to retain. 5-22
3.
Possible changes FIB could make are: a. Offer higher interest rates on high-balance accounts to increase FIBs competitiveness in attracting and retaining these accounts. b. Introduce charges for individual services. The ABC study reports the cost of each service. FIB has to decide if it wants to price each service at cost, below cost, or above cost. If it prices above cost, it may use advertising and other means to encourage additional use of those services by customers. Of course, in determining its pricing strategy, FIB would need to consider how other competing banks are pricing their products and services. (15 min.)

1. Pricing decisions at Wigan Associates are heavily influenced by reported cost numbers. Suppose Wigan is bidding against another firm for a client with a job similar to that of Widnes Coal. If the costing system overstates the costs of these jobs, Wigan may bid too high and fail to land the client. If the costing system understates the costs of these jobs, Wigan may bid low, land the client, and then lose money in handling the case. 2.

The higher the percentage of costs directly traced to each case, and the greater the number of homogeneous indirect cost pools linked to the cost drivers of indirect costs, the more accurate the product cost of each individual case. The Widnes and St. Helens cases differ in how they use resource areas of Wigan Associates: Widnes Coal 30.0% 66.7 32.0 27.8 12.0 16.7 25.0 5-25 St. Helens Glass 70.0% 33.3 68.0 72.2 88.0 83.3 75.0
Partner professional labor Associate professional labor Research support labor Computer time Travel and allowances Telephones/faxes Photocopying
The Widnes Coal case makes relatively low use of the higher-cost partners but relatively higher use of the lower-cost associates than does St. Helens Glass. As a result, it also uses less of the higher indirect costs required to support partners compared to associates. The Widnes Coal case also makes relatively lower use of the support labor, computer time, travel, phones/faxes, and photocopying resource areas than does the St. Helens Glass case. 2. The specific areas where the multiple direct/multiple indirect (MD/MI) approach can provide better information for decisions at Wigan Associates include:
Pricing and product (case) emphasis decisions. In a bidding situation using single direct/single indirect (SD/SI) or multiple direct/single indirect (MD/SI) data, Wigan may win bids for legal cases on which it will subsequently lose money. It may also not win bids on which it would make money with a lower-priced bid. From a strategic viewpoint, SD/SI or MD/SI exposes Wigan Associates to cherry-picking by competitors. Other law firms may focus exclusively on Widnes Coal-type cases and take sizable amounts of profitable business from Wigan Associates. MD/MI reduces the likelihood of Wigan Associates losing cases on which it would have made money. Client relationships. MD/MI provides a better road map for clients to understand how costs are accumulated at Wigan Associates. Wigan can use this road map when meeting with clients to plan the work to be done on a case before it commences. Clients can negotiate ways to get a lower-cost case from Wigan, given the information in MD/MIfor example, (a) use a higher proportion of associate labor time and a lower proportion of a partner time, and (b) use fax machines more and air travel less. If clients are informed in advance how costs will be accumulated, there is less likelihood of disputes about bills submitted to them after the work is done. Cost control. The MD/MI approach better highlights the individual cost areas at Wigan Associates than does the SD/SI or MD/SI approaches:
Number of direct cost categories Number of indirect cost categories Total MD/MI 7 2 9 SD/SI 1 1 2 MD/SI 7 1 8
MD/MI is likely to promote better cost-control practices than SD/SI or MD/SI, as the nine cost categories in MD/MI give Wigan a better handle on how to effectively manage different categories of both direct and indirect costs.

4. Disaggregated information can improve decisions by allowing managers to see the details which helps them understand how different aspects of cost influence total cost per unit. Managers can also understand the drivers of different cost categories and use this information for pricing and product-mix decisions, cost reduction and process-improvement decisions, design decisions, and to plan and manage activities. However, too much detail can overload managers who dont understand the data or what it means. Also, managers looking at per unit data may be misled when considering costs that arent unit-level costs.

3. Using the disaggregated activity-based costing data, managers can see that the MRI actually costs substantially more and x-rays and ultrasounds substantially less than the traditional system indicated. In particular, the MRI activity generates a lot of maintenance activity and sanitation activity. Managers should examine the use of these two activities to search for ways to reduce the activity consumption and ultimately its cost.

Supplies Larger programs with more participants will require more supplies. For example, as the number of dance participants increases, so will the cost of dance accessories. Rent, maintenance and utilities are all building-related costs. Square-footage is the only spaceoriented cost driver available. Administration salaries Larger programs require more time to enroll students and collect fees. Consequently, the number of participants appears to be a reasonable cost driver. Marketing expenses Marketing expenses include the cost of advertising the studio. As the number of ads increases so do total marketing costs. 3.

4. By dividing the full cost of each service line by the number of participants, Annie can see that fitness classes should be charged a higher price. Most of the higher unit cost is attributable to the cost of Aerobic instructors. Besides cost data, Annie should also consider a variety of other factors before setting the price for each service. Examples of other issues she should consider include the actions of competitors in her market, and the quality of her facilities and instructors. 5-35

Supermarket Mom-and-Pop Single Stores
The activity-based analysis of costs highlights how the Mom-and-Pop Single Stores use a larger amount of Pharmacares resources per revenue dollar than do the other two markets. The ratio of the operating costs to revenues across the three markets is: General Supermarket Chains Drugstore Chains Mom-and-Pop Single Stores 1.59% 2.27% 8.61% ($58,997 $3,708,000) ($71,510 $3,150,000) ($170,573 $1,980,000)
This is a classic illustration of the maxim that all revenue dollars are not created equal. The analysis indicates that the Mom-and-Pop Single Stores are the least profitable market. Pharmacare should work to increase profits in this market through: (1) a possible surcharge, (2) decreasing the number of orders, (3) offering discounts for quantity purchases, etc. Other issues for Pharmacare to consider include a. Choosing the appropriate cost drivers for each area. The problem gives a cost driver for each chosen activity area. However, it is likely that over time further refinements in cost drivers would occur. For example, not all store deliveries are equally easy to make, depending on parking availability, accessibility of the storage/shelf space to the delivery point, etc. Similarly, not all cartons are equally easy to delivertheir weight, size, or likely breakage component are factors that can vary across carton types. b. Developing a reliable data base on the chosen cost drivers. For some items, such as the number of orders and the number of line items, this information likely would be available in machine readable form at a high level of accuracy. Unless the delivery personnel have hand-held computers that they use in a systematic way, estimates of 5-37
shelf-stocking time are likely to be unreliable. Advances in information technology likely will reduce problems in this area over time. c. Deciding how to handle costs that may be common across several activities. For example, (3) store delivery and (4) cartons shipped to stores have the common cost of the same trip. Some organizations may treat (3) as the primary activity and attribute only incremental costs to (4). Similarly, (1) order processing and (2) line item ordering may have common costs. d.
Behavioral factors are likely to be a challenge to Flair. He must now tell those salespeople who specialize in Mom-and-Pop accounts that they have been less profitable than previously thought.

Direct material and direct manufacturing labor are costs that can be easily traced to output, which in this case is the number of bags produced. Setup and shipping are both a function of the number of batches produced. Design is related to the number of designs created for each product. Plant utilities and administration result from general activity level in the plant. Thus, hours of production seems to be an appropriate cost driver. 3.

5. Based on this analysis, over 50% of product cost relates to direct material. Managers should determine whether the material costs can be reduced. Producing in small lots increases the setup and shipping costs. While both are relatively small components of product cost, management may want to evaluate ways to reduce the number of setups and the cost per setup. Of the indirect costs, the product- and facility-sustaining costs are the highest. Management should review the design process for cost savings and examine why it takes so long to produce purses relative to backpacks.

1c. The ABC system more accurately allocates costs because it identifies better cost drivers. The ABC system chooses cost drivers for overhead costs that have a cause-and-effect relationship between the cost drivers and the costs. Of course, Clayton should continue to evaluate if better cost drivers can be found than the ones they have identified so far. By implementing the ABC system, Clayton can gain a more detailed understanding of costs and cost drivers. This is valuable information from a cost management perspective. The system can yield insight into the efficiencies with which various activities are performed. Clayton can then examine if redundant activities can be eliminated. Clayton can study trends and work toward improving the efficiency of the activities. In addition, the ABC system will help Clayton determine which programs are the most costly to operate. This will be useful in making long-run decisions as to which programs to offer or emphasize. The ABC system will also assist Clayton in setting prices for the programs that more accurately reflect the costs of each program. 2. The concern with using costs per patient-year as the rule to allocate resources among its programs is that it emphasizes input to the exclusion of outputs or effectiveness of the programs. After-all, Claytons goal is to cure patients while controlling costs, not minimize costs per-patient year. The problem, of course, is measuring outputs. Unlike many manufacturing companies, where the outputs are obvious because they are tangible and measurable, the outputs of service organizations are more difficult to measure. Examples are cured patients as distinguished from processed or discharged patients, educated as distinguished from partially educated students, and so on.

Job order 410 has an increase in reported unit cost of 36.6% [($1,820 $1,332.50) $1,332.50], while job order 411 has a decrease in reported unit cost of 4.1% [($547.75 $571.375) $571.375]. A common finding when activity-based costing is implemented is that low-volume products have increases in their reported costs while high-volume products have decreases in their reported cost. This result is also found in requirements 1 and 2 of this problem. Costs such as materials-handling costs vary with the number of parts handled (a function of batches and complexity of products) rather than with direct manufacturing labor-hours, an output-unit level cost driver, which was the only cost driver in the previous job-costing system. The product cost figures computed in requirements 1 and 2 differ because a. the job orders differ in the way they use each of five activity areas, and b. the activity areas differ in their indirect cost allocation bases (specifically, each area does not use the direct manufacturing labor-hours indirect cost allocation base).

The differences in product cost figures might be important to Tracy Corporation for product pricing and product emphasis decisions. The activity-based accounting approach indicates that job order 410 is being undercosted while job order 411 is being overcosted. Tracy Corporation may erroneously push job order 410 and deemphasize job order 411. Moreover, by its actions, Tracy Corporation may encourage a competitor to enter the market for job order 411 and take market share away from it. 4. Information from the ABC system can also help Tracy manage its business better in several ways. a. Product design. Product designers at Tracy Corporation likely will find the numbers in the activity-based costing approach more believable and credible than those in the simple system. In a machine-paced manufacturing environment, it is unlikely that direct labor-hours would be the major cost driver. Activity-based costing provides more credible signals to product designers about the ways the costs of a product can be reducedfor example, use fewer parts, require fewer turns on the lathe, and reduce the number of machine-hours in the milling area. b. Cost management. Tracy can reduce the cost of jobs both by making process improvements that reduce the activities that need to be done to complete jobs and by reducing the costs of doing the activities. c. Cost planning. ABC provides a more refined model to forecast costs and to explain why actual costs differ from budgeted costs.

1. Applewood Electronics should not emphasize the Regal model and should not phase out the Monarch model. Under activity-based costing, the Regal model has an operating income percentage of less than 3%, while the Monarch model has an operating income percentage of nearly 43%.

2. Applewoods simple costing system allocates all manufacturing overhead other than machine costs on the basis of machine-hours, an output unit-level cost driver. Consequently, the more machine-hours per unit that a product needs, the greater the manufacturing overhead allocated to it. Because Monarch uses twice the number of machine-hours per unit compared to Regal, a large amount of manufacturing overhead is allocated to Monarch. The ABC analysis recognizes several batch-level cost drivers such as purchase orders, shipments, and setups. Regal uses these resources much more intensively than Monarch. The ABC system recognizes Regals use of these overhead resources. Consider, for example, purchase order costs. The simple system allocates these costs on the basis of machine-hours. As a result, each unit of Monarch is allocated twice the purchase order costs of each unit of Regal. The ABC system allocates $400,500 of purchase order costs to Monarch (equal to $18.20 ($400,500 22,000) per unit) and $549,900 of purchase order costs to Regal (equal to $137.48 ($549,900 4,000) per unit). Each unit of Regal uses 7.55 ($137.48 $18.20) times the purchases order costs of each unit of Monarch. Recognizing Regals more intensive use of manufacturing overhead results in Regal showing a much lower profitability under the ABC system. By the same token, the ABC analysis shows that Monarch is quite profitable. The simple costing system overcosted Monarch, and so made it appear less profitable. 3. Duvals comments about ABC implementation are valid. When designing and implementing ABC systems, managers and management accountants need to trade off the costs of the system against its benefits. Adding more activities would make the system harder to understand and more costly to implement but it would probably improve the accuracy of cost information, which, in turn, would help Applewood make better decisions. Similarly, using inspection-hours and setup-hours as allocation bases would also probably lead to more accurate cost information, but it would increase measurement costs.
5-48
4. Activity-based management (ABM) is the use of information from activity-based costing to make improvements in a firm. For example, a firm could revise product prices on the basis of revised cost information. For the long term, activity-based costing can assist management in making decisions regarding the viability of product lines, distribution channels, marketing strategies, etc. ABM highlights possible improvements, including reduction or elimination of non-value-added activities, selecting lower cost activities, sharing activities with other products, and eliminating waste. ABM is an integrated approach that focuses managements attention on activities with the ultimate aim of continuous improvement. As a whole-company philosophy, ABM focuses on strategic, as well as tactical and operational activities of the company. 5. Incorrect reporting of ABC costs with the goal of retaining both the Monarch and Regal product lines is unethical. In assessing the situation, the specific Standards of Ethical Conduct for Management Accountants (described in Exhibit 1-7) that the management accountant should consider are listed below.
Competence Clear reports using relevant and reliable information should be prepared. Preparing reports on the basis of incorrect costs in order to retain product lines violates competence standards. It is unethical for Benzo to change the ABC system with the specific goal of reporting different product cost numbers that Duval favors. Integrity The management accountant has a responsibility to avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest and advise all appropriate parties of any potential conflict. Benzo may be tempted to change the product cost numbers to please Duval, the division president. This action, however, would violate the responsibility for integrity. The Standards of Ethical Conduct require the management accountant to communicate favorable as well as unfavorable information. Credibility The management accountants standards of ethical conduct require that information should be fairly and objectively communicated and that all relevant information should be disclosed. From a management accountants standpoint, adjusting the product cost numbers to make both the Monarch and Regal lines look profitable would violate the standard of objectivity. Benzo should indicate to Duval that the product cost calculations are, indeed, appropriate. If Duval still insists on modifying the product cost numbers, Benzo should raise the matter with one of Duvals superiors. If, after taking all these steps, there is continued pressure to modify product cost numbers, Benzo should consider resigning from the company, rather than engage in unethical behavior.

Comparing product line income statements in requirements 1 and 2, it appears that books are much more profitable and caf loses a lot more money under the ABC system compared to the simple system. The reason is that books use far fewer S,G&amp;A resources relative to its merchandise costs and caf uses far greater S, G&amp;A resources relative to its merchandise costs. 3. To: Super Bookstore Management Team From: Cost Analyst Re: Costing System The current accounting system allocates indirect costs (S,G&amp;A) to product lines based on the Cost of Merchandise sold. Using this method, the S, G&amp;A costs are assigned 54%, 35%, 11%, to the Books, CDs, and Caf product lines, respectively. I recommend that the organization switch to an activity-based costing (ABC) method. With ABC, the product lines are assigned indirect costs based on their consumption of the activities that give rise to the costs. An ABC analysis reveals that the Caf consumes considerably more than 11% of indirect costs. Instead, the caf generally requires 25-35% of the purchasing, receiving and stocking activity and 60% of the customer support. The current accounting technique masks the losses being produced by the caf because it assumes all indirect costs are driven by the dollar amount of merchandise sold. By adopting ABC, management can evaluate the costs of operating the three product lines and make more informed pricing and product mix decisions. For example, management may want to consider increasing prices of the food and drinks served in the caf. Before deciding whether to increase prices or to close the caf, management must consider the beneficial effect that having a cafe has on the other product lines. An ABC analysis can also help Super Bookstore manage its costs by reducing the number of activities that each product line demands and by reducing the cost of each activity. These actions will improve the profitability of each product line. ABC analysis can also be used to plan and manage the various activities.

CHAPTER 6 MASTER BUDGET AND RESPONSIBILITY ACCOUNTING 6-1 a. b. c. d. The budgeting cycle includes the following elements: Planning the performance of the company as a whole as well as planning the performance of its subunits. Management agrees on what is expected. Providing a frame of reference, a set of specific expectations against which actual results can be compared. Investigating variations from plans. If necessary, corrective action follows investigation. Planning again, in light of feedback and changed conditions.
6-2 The master budget expresses managements operating and financial plans for a specified period (usually a fiscal year) and includes a set of budgeted financial statements. It is the initial plan of what the company intends to accomplish in the period. 6-3 Strategy, plans, and budgets are interrelated and affect one another. Strategy specifies how an organization matches its own capabilities with the opportunities in the marketplace to accomplish its objectives. Strategic analysis underlies both long-run and short-run planning. In turn, these plans lead to the formulation of budgets. Budgets provide feedback to managers about the likely effects of their strategic plans. Managers use this feedback to revise their strategic plans. 6-4 We agree that budgeted performance is a better criterion than past performance for judging managers, because inefficiencies included in past results can be detected and eliminated in budgeting. Also, future conditions may be expected to differ from the past, and these can also be factored into budgets. 6-5 Production and marketing traditionally have operated as relatively independent business functions. Budgets can assist in reducing conflicts between these two functions in two ways. Consider a beverage company such as Coca-Cola or Pepsi-Cola: Communication. Marketing could share information about seasonal demand with production. Coordination. Production could ensure that output is sufficient to meet, for example, high seasonal demand in the summer. 6-6 In many organizations, budgets impel managers to plan. Without budgets, managers drift from crisis to crisis. Research also shows that budgets can motivate managers to meet targets and improve their performance. Thus, many top managers believe that budgets meet the cost-benefit test. 6-7 A rolling budget, also called a continuous budget, is a budget or plan that is always available for a specified future period, by continually adding a period (month, quarter, or year) to the period that just ended. A four-quarter rolling budget for 2009 is superseded by a four-quarter rolling budget for April 2009 to March 2010, and so on.

The steps in preparing an operating budget are as follows: 1. Prepare the revenues budget 2. Prepare the production budget (in units) 3. Prepare the direct material usage budget and direct material purchases budget 4. Prepare the direct manufacturing labor budget 5. Prepare the manufacturing overhead budget 6. Prepare the ending inventories budget 7. Prepare the cost of goods sold budget 8. Prepare the nonmanufacturing costs budget 9. Prepare the budgeted income statement
6-9 The sales forecast is typically the cornerstone for budgeting, because production (and, hence, costs) and inventory levels generally depend on the forecasted level of sales. 6-10 Sensitivity analysis adds an extra dimension to budgeting. It enables managers to examine how budgeted amounts change with changes in the underlying assumptions. This assists managers in monitoring those assumptions that are most critical to a company in attaining its budget and allows them to make timely adjustments to plans when appropriate. 6-11 Kaizen budgeting explicitly incorporates continuous improvement anticipated during the budget period into the budget numbers. 6-12 Nonoutput-based cost drivers can be incorporated into budgeting by the use of activitybased budgeting (ABB). ABB focuses on the budgeted cost of activities necessary to produce and sell products and services. Nonoutput-based cost drivers, such as the number of part numbers, number of batches, and number of new products can be used with ABB. 6-13 The choice of the type of responsibility center determines what the manager is accountable for and thereby affects the managers behavior. For example, if a revenue center is chosen, the manager will focus on revenues, not on costs or investments. The choice of a responsibility center type guides the variables to be included in the budgeting exercise. 6-14 Budgeting in multinational companies may involve budgeting in several different foreign currencies. Further, management accountants must translate operating performance into a single currency for reporting to shareholders, by budgeting for exchange rates. Managers and accountants must understand the factors that impact exchange rates, and where possible, plan financial strategies to limit the downside of unexpected unfavorable moves in currency valuations. In developing budgets for operations in different countries, they must also have good understanding of political, legal and economic issues in those countries. 6-15 No. Cash budgets and operating income budgets must be prepared simultaneously. In preparing their operating income budgets, companies want to avoid unnecessary idle cash and unexpected cash deficiencies. The cash budget, unlike the operating income budget, highlights periods of idle cash and periods of cash shortage, and it allows the accountant to plan cost effective ways of either using excess cash or raising cash from outside to achieve the companys operating income goals.

Expected revenues at the new 2010 prices are $5,631,100, which are greater than the expected 2010 revenues of $5,623,500 if the prices are unchanged. So, if the goal is to maximize sales revenue and if Jim McGraths forecasts are reliable, the company should lower its price for a lead test in 2010.

2. Refer to the last row of the table in requirement 1. Fresh produce, which probably represents the smallest portion of COGS, is the product category that consumes the largest share (63%) of the indirect resources. Fresh produce demands the highest level of ordering, delivery, shelf-stocking and customer support resources of all three product categoriesit has to be ordered, delivered and stocked in small, perishable batches, and supermarket customers often ask for a lot of guidance on fresh produce items. 3. An ABB approach recognizes how different products require different mixes of support activities. The relative percentage of how each product area uses the cost driver at each activity area is: Cost Hierarchy Batch-level Batch-level Output-unit-level Output-unit-level Soft Drinks 27% 13 6 9 Fresh Produce 46% 67 61 69 Packaged Food 27% 20 33 22
Activity Ordering Delivery Shelf-stocking Customer support
Total 100% 100 100 100
By recognizing these differences, FS managers are better able to budget for different unit sales levels and different mixes of individual product-line items sold. Using a single cost driver (such as COGS) assumes homogeneity in the use of indirect costs (support activities) across product lines which does not occur at FS. Other benefits cited by managers include: (1) better identification of resource needs, (2) clearer linking of costs with staff responsibilities, and (3) identification of budgetary slack.

Question 6-24 Question 6-25 (Kaizen)
Ordering $4,680 4,661
Delivery $7,626 7,596
The kaizen budget number will show unfavorable variances for managers whose activities do not meet the required monthly cost reductions. This likely will put more pressure on managers to creatively seek out cost reductions by working smarter within FS or by having better interactions with suppliers or customers. One limitation of kaizen budgeting, as illustrated in this question, is that it assumes small incremental improvements each month. It is possible that some cost improvements arise from large discontinuous changes in operating processes, supplier networks, or customer interactions. Companies need to highlight the importance of seeking these large discontinuous improvements as well as the small incremental improvements.

(15 min.) Responsibility and controllability. 1. (a) Salesman (b) VP of Sales Permit the salesman to offer a reasonable discount to customers, but require that he clear bigger discounts with the VP. Also, base his bonus/performance evaluation not just on revenues generated, but also on margins (or, ability to meet budget). 2. (a) VP of Sales (b) VP of Sales VP of Sales should compare budgeted sales with actuals, and ask for an analysis of all the sales during the quarter. Discuss with salespeople why so many discounts are being offeredare they really needed to close each sale. Are our prices too high (i.e., uncompetitive)? 3. (a) Manager, Shipping department (b) Manager or Director of Operations (including shipping) Shipping department manager must report delays more regularly and request additional capacity in a timely manner. Operations manager should ask for a review of shipping capacity utilization, and consider expanding the department. 4. (a) HR department (b) Production supervisor The production supervisor should devise his or her own educational standards that all new plant employees are held to before they are allowed to work on the plant floor. Offer remedial in-plant training to those workers who show promise. Be very specific about the types of skills required when using the HR department to hire plant workers. Test the workers periodically for required skills. 5. (a) Production supervisor (b) Production supervisor Get feedback from the workers, analyze it, and act on it. Get extra coaching and training from experienced mentors. 6. (a) Maintenance department (b) Production supervisor First, get the requisite maintenance done on the machines. Make sure that the maintenance department head clearly understands the repercussions of poor maintenance. Discuss and establish maintenance standards that must be met (frequency of maintenance and tolerance limits, for example). Test and keep a log of the maintenance work.

Monthly cash budgets are prepared by companies such as TabComp, Inc., in order to plan for their cash needs. This means identifying when both excess cash and cash shortages may occur. A company needs to know when cash shortages will occur so that prior arrangements can be made with lending institutions in order to have cash available for borrowing when the company needs it. At the same time, a company should be aware of when there is excess cash available for investment or for repaying loans.

Areas where continuous improvement might be incorporated into the budgeting process: (a) Direct materials. Either an improvement in usage or price could be budgeted. For example, the budgeted usage amounts could be related to the maximum improvement (current usage minimum possible usage) of 1 square foot for either desk: Executive: 16 square feet 15 square feet minimum = 1 square foot Chairman: 25 square feet 24 square feet minimum = 1 square foot Thus, a 1% reduction target per month could be: Executive: 15 square feet + (0.99 1) = 15.99 Chairman: 24 square feet + (0.99 1) = 24.99 Some students suggested the 1% be applied to the 16 and 25 square-foot amounts. This can be done so long as after several improvement cycles, the budgeted amount is not less than the minimum desk requirements. (b) Direct manufacturing labor. The budgeted usage of 3 hours/5 hours could be continuously revised on a monthly basis. Similarly, the manufacturing labor cost per hour of $30 could be continuously revised down. The former appears more feasible than the latter. (c) Variable manufacturing overhead. By budgeting more efficient use of the allocation base, a signal is given for continuous improvement. A second approach is to budget continuous improvement in the budgeted variable overhead cost per unit of the allocation base. (d) Fixed manufacturing overhead. The approach here is to budget for reductions in the year-to-year amounts of fixed overhead. If these costs are appropriately classified as fixed, then they are more difficult to adjust down on a monthly basis. 6-15

9. Reduction in materials can be accomplished by reducing waste and scrap. Reduction in direct labor and setup time can be accomplished by improving the efficiency of operations and decreasing down time. Employees who make the gizmos may have suggestions for ways to do their jobs more efficiently. For instance, employees may recommend process changes that reduce idle time, setup time, and scrap. To motivate workers to improve efficiency, many companies have set up programs that share productivity gains with the workers. Korna must be careful that productivity improvements and cost reductions do not in any way compromise product quality.

(15 min.) Responsibility of purchasing agent.
The time lost in the plant should be charged to the purchasing department. The plant manager probably should not be asked to underwrite a loss due to failure of delivery over which he had no supervision. Although the purchasing agent may feel that he has done everything he possibly could, he must realize that, in the whole organization, he is the one who is in the best position to evaluate the situation. He receives an assignment. He may accept it or reject it. But if he accepts, he must perform. If he fails, the damage is evaluated. Everybody makes mistakes. The important point is to avoid making too many mistakes and also to understand fully that the extensive control reflected in responsibility accounting is the necessary balance to the great freedom of action that individual executives are given. Discussions of this problem have again and again revealed a tendency among students (and among accountants and managers) to fix the blameas if the variances arising from a responsibility accounting system should pinpoint misbehavior and provide answers. The point is that no accounting system or variances can provide answers. However, variances can lead to questions. In this case, in deciding where the penalty should be assigned, the student might inquire who should be askednot who should be blamed. Classroom discussions have also raised the following diverse points: (a) Is the railroad company liable? (b) Costs of idle time are usually routinely charged to the production department. Should the information system be fine-tuned to reallocate such costs to the purchasing department? (c) How will the purchasing managers behave in the future regarding willingness to take risks? The text emphasizes the following: Beware of overemphasis on controllability. For example, a time-honored theme of management is that responsibility should not be given without accompanying authority. Such a guide is a useful first step, but responsibility accounting is more far-reaching. The basic focus should be on information or knowledge, not on control. The key

2. Yes. Slopes has a budgeted cash balance of $69,650 on 10/1/2010 and so it will be in a position to pay off the $30,000 1-year note on October 1, 2010. 3. No. Slopes does not maintain a $10,000 minimum cash balance in July. To maintain a $10,000 cash balance in each of the three months, it could perhaps encourage its customers to pay earlier by offering a discount. Alternatively, Slopes could seek short-term credit from a bank.

13. The budgeted unit cost of the chair is $99.84, which is $20 more than the selling price of $80 per chair. The company is willing to accept the loss on chairs because of the high markup on tables ($900 $688.60 $211.40) = $688.60 ( 76.5% ). Customers who purchase a table will likely want $900 matching chairs. Thus the markup on tables more than recoups the loss on four chairs. Dinette could, of course, reduce the price on tables and increase the price on chairs. If, however, customers care less about the price of the table and more about the price of chairs and buy 4 chairs for every 1 table, Dinettes pricing strategy may well be optimal.

6-39 (15 min.) Budgeting and ethics. 1. The standards proposed by Wert are not challenging. In fact, he set the target at the level his department currently achieves. DM 2.95 lbs. 100 units = 295 lbs. DL 19.2 min. 100 units = 1,920 min 60 = 32 hrs. MT 9.9 min. 100 units = 990 min. 60 = 16.5 hrs. 2. Wert probably chose these standards so that his department would be able to make the goal and receive any resulting reward. With a little effort, his department can likely beat these goals. 3. As discussed in the chapter, benchmarking might be used to highlight the easy targets set by Wert. Perhaps the organization has multiple plant locations that could be used as comparisons. Alternatively, management could use industry averages. Also, management should work with Wert to better understand his department and encourage him to set more realistic targets. Finally, the reward structure should be designed to encourage increasing productivity, not beating the budget. 6-40 (60 min.)

CHAPTER 7 FLEXIBLE BUDGETS, DIRECT-COST VARIANCES, AND MANAGEMENT CONTROL 7-1 Management by exception is the practice of concentrating on areas not operating as expected and giving less attention to areas operating as expected. Variance analysis helps managers identify areas not operating as expected. The larger the variance, the more likely an area is not operating as expected. 7-2 Two sources of information about budgeted amounts are (a) past amounts and (b) detailed engineering studies. 7-3 A favorable variancedenoted Fis a variance that has the effect of increasing operating income relative to the budgeted amount. An unfavorable variancedenoted Uis a variance that has the effect of decreasing operating income relative to the budgeted amount. 7-4 The key difference is the output level used to set the budget. A static budget is based on the level of output planned at the start of the budget period. A flexible budget is developed using budgeted revenues or cost amounts based on the actual output level in the budget period. The actual level of output is not known until the end of the budget period. 7-5 A flexible-budget analysis enables a manager to distinguish how much of the difference between an actual result and a budgeted amount is due to (a) the difference between actual and budgeted output levels, and (b) the difference between actual and budgeted selling prices, variable costs, and fixed costs. 7-6 The steps in developing a flexible budget are: Step 1: Identify the actual quantity of output. Step 2: Calculate the flexible budget for revenues based on budgeted selling price and actual quantity of output. Step 3: Calculate the flexible budget for costs based on budgeted variable cost per output unit, actual quantity of output, and budgeted fixed costs. Four reasons for using standard costs are: (i) cost management, (ii) pricing decisions, (iii) budgetary planning and control, and (iv) financial statement preparation.
7-7
7-8 A manager should subdivide the flexible-budget variance for direct materials into a price variance (that reflects the difference between actual and budgeted prices of direct materials) and an efficiency variance (that reflects the difference between the actual and budgeted quantities of direct materials used to produce actual output). The individual causes of these variances can then be investigated, recognizing possible interdependencies across these individual causes.
7-1
7-9
Possible causes of a favorable direct materials price variance are: purchasing officer negotiated more skillfully than was planned in the budget, purchasing manager bought in larger lot sizes than budgeted, thus obtaining quantity discounts, materials prices decreased unexpectedly due to, say, industry oversupply, budgeted purchase prices were set without careful analysis of the market, and purchasing manager received unfavorable terms on nonpurchase price factors (such as lower quality materials).
7-10 Some possible reasons for an unfavorable direct manufacturing labor efficiency variance are the hiring and use of underskilled workers; inefficient scheduling of work so that the workforce was not optimally occupied; poor maintenance of machines resulting in a high proportion of non-value-added labor; unrealistic time standards. Each of these factors would result in actual direct manufacturing labor-hours being higher than indicated by the standard work rate. 7-11 Variance analysis, by providing information about actual performance relative to standards, can form the basis of continuous operational improvement. The underlying causes of unfavorable variances are identified, and corrective action taken where possible. Favorable variances can also provide information if the organization can identify why a favorable variance occurred. Steps can often be taken to replicate those conditions more often. As the easier changes are made, and perhaps some standards tightened, the harder issues will be revealed for the organization to act onthis is continuous improvement. 7-12 An individual business function, such as production, is interdependent with other business functions. Factors outside of production can explain why variances arise in the production area. For example: poor design of products or processes can lead to a sizable number of defects, marketing personnel making promises for delivery times that require a large number of rush orders can create production-scheduling difficulties, and purchase of poor-quality materials by the purchasing manager can result in defects and waste. 7-13 The plant supervisor likely has good grounds for complaint if the plant accountant puts excessive emphasis on using variances to pin blame. The key value of variances is to help understand why actual results differ from budgeted amounts and then to use that knowledge to promote learning and continuous improvement. 7-14 Variances can be calculated at the activity level as well as at the company level. For example, a price variance and an efficiency variance can be computed for an activity area. 7-15 Evidence on the costs of other companies is one input managers can use in setting the performance measure for next year. However, caution should be taken before choosing such an amount as next year&apos;s performance measure. It is important to understand why cost differences across companies exist and whether these differences can be eliminated. It is also important to examine when planned changes (in, say, technology) next year make even the current low-cost producer not a demanding enough hurdle.

The total static-budget variance in operating income is $20,000 U. There is both an unfavorable total flexible-budget variance ($12,800) and an unfavorable sales-volume variance ($7,200). The unfavorable sales-volume variance arises solely because actual units manufactured and sold were 200 less than the budgeted 3,000 units. The unfavorable flexible-budget variance of $12,800 in operating income is due primarily to the $8 increase in unit variable costs. This increase in unit variable costs is only partially offset by the $2 increase in unit selling price and the $4,000 decrease in fixed costs.

The budgeted output level is 10,000 unitsdirect materials of $400,000 in the static budget budgeted direct materials cost per attach case of $40.

The Level 1 analysis shows total direct costs have a $48,000 favorable variance. However, the Level 2 analysis reveals that this favorable variance is due to the reduction in output of 1,200 units from the budgeted 10,000 units. Once this reduction in output is taken into account (via a flexible budget), the flexible-budget variance shows each direct cost category to have an unfavorable variance indicating less efficient use of each direct cost item than was budgeted, or the use of more costly direct cost items than was budgeted, or both. Each direct cost category has an actual unit variable cost that exceeds its budgeted unit cost: Actual Budgeted Units 8,800 10,000 Direct materials $ 41.36 $ 40.00 Direct manufacturing labor $ 8.86 $ 8.00 Direct marketing labor $ 12.50 $ 12.00 Analysis of price and efficiency variances for each cost category could assist in further the identifying causes of these more aggregated (Level 2) variances.

3. Level 2 analysis breaks down the static-budget variance into a flexible-budget variance and a sales-volume variance. The primary reason for the static-budget variance being unfavorable ($17,000 U) is the reduction in unit volume from the budgeted 15,000 to an actual 12,000. One explanation for this reduction is the increase in selling price from a budgeted $20 to an actual $21. Operating management was able to reduce variable costs by $12,000 relative to the flexible budget. This reduction could be a sign of efficient management. Alternatively, it could be due to using lower quality materials (which in turn adversely affected unit volume).

3. A zero total static-budget variance may be due to offsetting total flexible-budget and total sales-volume variances. In this case, these two variances exactly offset each other:
Total flexible-budget variance Total sales-volume variance $15,000 Unfavorable $15,000 Favorable
A closer look at the variance components reveals some major deviations from plan. Actual variable costs increased from $2.00 to $3.96, causing an unfavorable flexible-budget variable cost variance of $255,000. Such an increase could be a result of, for example, a jump in direct material prices. Clarkson was able to pass most of the increase in costs onto their customersactual selling price increased by 57% [($5.50 $3.50) $3.50], bringing about an offsetting favorable flexible-budget revenue variance in the amount of $260,000. An increase in the actual number of units sold also contributed to more favorable results. The company should examine why the units sold increased despite an increase in direct material prices. For example, Clarksons customers may have stocked up, anticipating future increases in direct material prices. Alternatively, Clarksons selling price increases may have been lower than competitors price increases. Understanding the reasons why actual results differ from budgeted amounts can help Clarkson better manage its costs and pricing decisions in the future. The important lesson learned here is that a superficial examination of summary level data (Levels 0 and 1) may be insufficient. It is imperative to scrutinize data at a more detailed level (Level 2). Had Clarkson not been able to pass costs on to customers, losses would have been considerable.

3. The selling price variance, caused solely by the difference in actual and budgeted selling price, is the flexible-budget variance in revenues = $52,500 U. 4. The flexible-budget variances show that for the actual sales volume of 525,000 pounds, selling prices were lower and costs per pound were higher. The favorable sales volume variance in revenues (because more pounds of ice cream were sold than budgeted) helped offset the unfavorable variable cost variance and shored up the results in June 2009. Levine should be more concerned because the small static-budget variance in contribution margin of $30,000 U is actually made up of a favorable sales-volume variance in contribution margin of $75,000, an unfavorable selling-price variance of $52,500 and an unfavorable variable manufacturing costs variance of $52,500. Levine should analyze why each of these variances occurred and the relationships among them. Could the efficiency of variable manufacturing costs be improved? Did the sales volume increase because of a decrease in selling price or because of growth in the overall market? Analysis of these questions would help Levine decide what actions he should take.

3.
The favorable flexible-budget variance of $408 has two offsetting components: (a) favorable price variance of $1,120reflects the $0.82 actual purchase cost being lower than the $0.89 budgeted purchase cost per pound. (b) unfavorable efficiency variance of $712reflects the actual materials yield of 3.80 scones per pound of pumpkin (60,800 16,000 = 3.80) being less than the budgeted yield of 4.00 (60,000 15,000 = 4.00). The company used more pumpkins (materials) to make the scones than was budgeted.
One explanation may be that Peterson purchased lower quality pumpkins at a lower cost per pound.

Efficiencies have improved in the direction indicated by the production managerbut, it is unclear whether they are a trend or a one-time occurrence. Also, overall, variances are still 7.6% of flexible input budget. GloriaDee should continue to use the new material, especially in light of its superior quality and feel, but it may want to keep the following points in mind: The new material costs substantially more than the old ($1.75 in 2009 and $1.6625 in 2010 vs. $1.50 per meter). Its price is unlikely to come down even more within the coming year. Standard material price should be re-examined and possibly changed. GloriaDee should continue to work to reduce direct materials and direct manufacturing labor content. The reductions from May 2009 to May 2010 are a good development and should be encouraged.

3. Some students comments will be immersed in conjecture about higher prices for materials, better quality materials, higher grade labor, better efficiency in use of materials, and so forth. A possibility is that approximately the same labor force, paid somewhat more, is taking slightly less time with better materials and causing less waste and spoilage. A key point in this problem is that all of these efficiency variances are likely to be insignificant. They are so small as to be nearly meaningless. Fluctuations about standards are bound to occur in a random fashion. Practically, from a control viewpoint, a standard is a band or range of acceptable performance rather than a single-figure measure. 4. The purchasing point is where responsibility for price variances is found most often. The production point is where responsibility for efficiency variances is found most often. The Monroe Corporation may calculate variances at different points in time to tie in with these different responsibility areas. 7-12

Note that the question assumes the continuous improvement applies only to quantity inputs. An alternative approach is to have continuous improvement apply to the total budgeted input cost per output unit ($45 for direct materials in January and $15 for direct manufacturing labor in January).

The unfavorable materials price variance may be unrelated to the favorable materials efficiency variance. For example, (a) the purchasing officer may be less skillful than assumed in the budget, or (b) there was an unexpected increase in materials price per square yard due to reduced competition. Similarly, the favorable materials efficiency variance may be unrelated to the unfavorable materials price variance. For example, (a) the production manager may have been able to employ higher-skilled workers, or (b) the budgeted materials standards were set too loosely. It is also possible that the two variances are interrelated. The higher materials input price may be due to higher quality materials being purchased. Less material was used than budgeted due to the high quality of the materials. Direct Manufacturing Labor Actual Costs Incurred (Actual Input Qty.

These journal entries differ from the normal costing entries because Work-in-Process Control is no longer carried at actual costs. Furthermore, Direct Materials Control is carried at standard unit prices rather than actual unit prices. Finally, variances appear for direct materials and direct manufacturing labor under standard costing but not under normal costing.

A more detailed analysis underscores the fact that the world of variances may be divided into three general parts: price, efficiency, and what is labeled here as a sales-volume variance. Failure to pinpoint these three categories muddies the analytical task. The clearer analysis follows (in dollars): Actual Costs Incurred (Actual Input Qty. Actual Actual Input Qty.

(a) Price variance (b) Efficiency variance (c) Sales-volume variance The sales-volume variances are favorable here in the sense that less cost would be expected solely because the output level is less than budgeted. However, this is an example of how variances must be interpreted cautiously. Managers may be incensed at the failure to reach scheduled production (it may mean fewer sales) even though the 2,000 units were turned out with supreme efficiency. Sometimes this phenomenon is called being efficient but ineffective, where effectiveness is defined as the ability to reach original targets and efficiency is the optimal relationship of inputs to any given outputs. Note that a target can be reached in an efficient or inefficient way; similarly, as this problem illustrates, a target can be missed but the given output can be attained efficiently.

2. To compute flexible budget variances for revenues and the variable costs, first calculate the budgeted cost or revenue per car, and then multiply that by the actual number of cars detailed. Subtract the actual revenue or cost, and the result is the flexible budget variance. FBV(Revenue) = = = = Actual Revenue - Actual number of cars (Budgeted revenue/budgeted # cars) $39,375 - 225 ($30,000/200) $39,375 - $33,750 $5,625 Favorable
FBV(Supplies) = Actual Supplies expense - Actual number of cars (Budgeted cost of supplies/budgeted # cars) = $2,250 - 225 ($1,500/200) = $2,250 - $1,687.50 = $562.50 Unfavorable FBV(Labor) = Actual Labor expense - Actual number of cars (Budgeted cost of labor/budgeted # cars) = $6,000 - 225 ($5,600/200) = $6,000 - $6,300 = $300 Favorable
7-23
The flexible budget variance for fixed costs is the same as the static budget variance, and equals $0 in this case. Therefore, the overall flexible budget variance in income is given by aggregating the variances computed earlier, adjusting for whether they are favorable or unfavorable. This yields: FBV(Operating Income) = $5,625F (-) $562.50U (+) $300F = $5,362.50. 3. In addition to understanding the variances computed above, Stevie should attempt to keep track of the number of cars worked on by each employee, as well as the number of hours actually spent on each car. In addition, Stevie should look at the prices charged for detailing, in relation to the hours spent on each job. 4. This is just a simple problem of two equations&amp;two unknowns. The two equations relate to the number of cars detailed and the labor costs (the wages paid to the employees). X = number of cars detailed by long-term employee Y = number of cars detailed by both short-term employees (combined) Budget: X + Y = 200 40X + 20Y = 5600 Actual: X + Y = 225 40X + 20Y = 6000 Substitution: 40X + 20(225-X) = 6000 20X = 1500 X = 75 Y=150
Substitution: 40X + 20(200-X) = 5600 20X = 1600 X=80 Y=120
Therefore the long term employee is budgeted to detail 80 cars, and the new employees are budgeted to detail 60 cars each. Actually the long term employee details 75 cars (and grosses $3,000 for the month), and the other two wash 75 each and gross $1,500 apiece. 5. The two short-term employees are budgeted to earn gross wages of $14,400 per year (if June is typical, and less if it is a high volume month). If this is a part-time job for them, then that is fine. If it is full-time, and they only get paid for what they wash, the excess capacity may be causing motivation problems. Stevie needs to determine a better way to compensate employees to encourage retention. This should increase customer satisfaction, and potentially revenue, because longer-term employees do a more thorough job. In addition, rather than paying the same wage per car, Stevie might consider setting quality standards and improvement goals for all of the employees.

Possible explanations for the price variances are: (a) Unexpected outcomes from purchasing and labor negotiations during the year. (b) Higher quality of frames and/or lower quality of lenses purchased. (c) Standards set incorrectly at the start of the year. Possible explanations for the uniformly unfavorable efficiency variances are: (a) Substantially higher usage of lenses due to poor quality lenses purchased at lower price. (b) Lesser trained workers hired at lower rates result in higher materials usage (for both frames and lenses), as well as lower levels of labor efficiency. (c) Standards set incorrectly at the start of the year.

If union organizers are targeting our plant, it could suggest employee dissatisfaction with our wage and benefits policies. During this time of targeting, we might expect employees to work more slowly and they may be less careful with the materials that they are using. These tactics might be seen as helpful in either organizing the union or in receiving increases in wages and/or benefits. We should expect unfavorable efficiency variances for both wages and materials. We may see an unfavorable wage variance, if we need to pay overtime due to work slowdowns. We do, in fact, see a substantial unfavorable materials quantity variance, representing a serious overuse of materials. While we may not expect each bottle to use exactly 15 oz. of glass, we do expect the shrinkage to be much less than this. Similarly, we see over 80% more hours used than we expect to make this number of bottles. They are able to make just over 16 bottles per hour, instead of the standard 30 bottles per hour. It is plausible that this waste&amp;inefficiency are either caused by, or are reflective of the reasons behind the attempt to organize the union at this plant.

2. The favorable price variance is due to the $2 difference ($20 - $18) between the standard price based on the previous suppliers and the actual price paid through the on-line marketplace. The unfavorable efficiency variance could be due to several factors including inexperienced workers and machine malfunctions. But the likely cause here is that the lower-priced titanium was lower quality or less refined, which led to more waste. The labor efficiency variance could be affected if the lower quality titanium caused the workers to use more time. 3. Switching suppliers was not a good idea. The $12,000 savings in the cost of titanium was outweighed by the $20,000 extra material usage. In addition, the $20,000U efficiency variance does not recognize the total impact of the lower quality titanium because, of the 6,000 pounds purchased, only 5,000 pounds were used. If the quantity of materials used in production is relatively the same, Better Bikes could expect the remaining 1,000 lbs to produce 100 more units. At standard, 100 more units should take 100 8 = 800 lbs. There could be an additional unfavorable efficiency variance of (1000 $20) $20,000 $4,000U 4. The purchasing managers performance evaluation should not be based solely on the price variance. The short-run reduction in purchase costs was more than offset by higher usage rates. His evaluation should be based on the total costs of the company as a whole. In addition, the production managers performance evaluation should not be based solely on the efficiency variances. In this case, the production manager was not responsible for the purchase of the lower-quality titanium, which led to the unfavorable efficiency scores. In general, it is important for Stanley to understand that not all favorable material price variances are good news, because of the negative effects that can arise in the production process from the purchase of inferior inputs. They can lead to unfavorable 7-28 (100 8 $20) $16,000
efficiency variances for both materials and labor. Stanley should also that understand efficiency variances may arise for many different reasons and she needs to know these reasons before evaluating performance. 5. Variances should be used to help Better Bikes understand what led to the current set of financial results, as well as how to perform better in the future. They are a way to facilitate the continuous improvement efforts of the company. Rather than focusing solely on the price of titanium, Scott can balance price and quality in future purchase decisions. 6. Future problems can arise in the supply chain. Scott may need to go back to the previous suppliers. But Better Bikes relationship with them may have been damaged and they may now be selling all their available titanium to other manufacturers. Lower quality bicycles could also affect Better Bikes reputation with the distributors, the bike shops and customers, leading to higher warranty claims and customer dissatisfaction, and decreased sales in the future.

3. Plausible explanations for the above variances include: Shayna paid a little bit extra for the wool, but the wool was thicker and allowed the workers to use less of it. Shayna used more inexperienced workers in April than she usually does. This resulted in payment of lower wages per hour, but the new workers were more inefficient and took more hours than normal. Overall though, the lower wage rates resulted in Shaynas total wage bill being significantly lower than expected.

The following details, revealed in the variance analysis, should be used to rebut the union if it focuses on the favorable operating income variance: Most of the static budget operating income variance of $41,840F ($139,680 $97,840) comes from a favorable sales volume variance, which only arose because Sol sold more units than planned. Of the $8,672 F flexible-budget variance in operating income, most of it comes from the $7,200F flexible-budget variance in sales. The net flexible-budget variance in total variable costs of $1,872 F is small, and it arises from direct materials and other variable costs, not from labor. Direct manufacturing labor flexible-budget variance is $1,440 U. The direct manufacturing labor price variance, $4,320U, which is large and unfavorable, is indeed offset by direct manufacturing labors favorable efficiency variancebut the efficiency variance is driven by the fact that Sol is using new, more expensive materials. Shaw may have to prove this to the union which will insist that its because workers are working smarter. Even if workers are working smarter, the favorable direct manufacturing labor efficiency variance of $2,880 does not offset the unfavorable direct manufacturing labor price variance of $4,320.
 
3. Changing the standards may make them more realistic, making it easier to negotiate with the union. But the union will resist any tightening of labor standards, and it may be too early (is one quarters experience enough to change on?); a change of standards at this point may be viewed as opportunistic by the union. Perhaps a continuous improvement program to change the standards will be more palatable to the union and will achieve the same result over a somewhat longer period of time.

Comments on the variances include Selling price variance. This may arise from a proactive decision to reduce price to expand market share or from a reaction to a price reduction by a competitor. It could also arise from unplanned price discounting by salespeople. Material price variance. The $0.05 increase in the price per ounce of vanilla extract could arise from uncontrollable market factors or from poor contract negotiations by Iceland. Material efficiency variance. For all three material inputs, usage is greater than budgeted. Possible reasons include lower quality inputs, use of lower quality workers, and the preparing and stirring equipment not being maintained in a fully operational mode. The higher price per ounce of vanilla extract (and perhaps higher quality of vanilla extract) did not reduce the quantity of vanilla extract used to produce actual output. Labor efficiency variance. The favorable efficiency variance for stirring could be due to workers eliminating nonvalue-added steps in production.

2. Re: Explanation of Variances Below I explain the implications of the variances that I calculated. I would enjoy meeting with you to discuss whether we are following the most efficient policies, given these calculations. Please let me know if there is any way to improve my work or my presentation to you. 1. Our batch sizes for both setups and quality inspection were smaller than planned. Even though we were able to reduce the setup and quality inspection time needed for each batch (because of the smaller batch sizes), these gains were more than offset by the increased number of batches. Overall, we ended up substantially below the level of efficiency at which we wished to operate. 2. The hourly wage for the setup workers went over budget due to the tight labor market in our area for such employees. However, we saved a considerable amount of money because we were able to negotiate reduced wage rates for the quality inspection labor after the expiration of their previous contract. Overall, given our output level of 15,000 eels, we had a moderately favorable variance for quality inspection costs, and a significant unfavorable variance on setups, for the reasons outlined above. Thank you.

2. Actions employees may have taken include: (a) Adding steps that are not necessary in working on a shirt. (b) Taking more time on each step than is necessary. (c) Creating problem situations so that the budgeted amount of average downtime will be overstated. (d) Creating defects in shirts so that the budgeted amount of average rework will be overstated. Employees may take these actions for several possible reasons. (a) They may be paid on a piece-rate basis with incentives for production levels above budget. (b) They may want to create a relaxed work atmosphere, and a less demanding standard can reduce stress. (c) They have a them vs. us mentality rather than a partnership perspective. (d) They may want to gain all the benefits that ensue from superior performance (job security, wage rate increases) without putting in the extra effort required. This behavior is unethical if it is deliberately designed to undermine the credibility of the standards used at New Fashions. 3. If Jorgenson does nothing about standard costs, his behavior will violate the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Practitioners of Management Accounting. In particular, he would violate the (a) standards of competence, by not performing professional duties in accordance with relevant standards; (b) standards of integrity, by passively subverting the attainment of the organizations objective to control costs; and (c) standards of credibility, by not communicating information fairly and not disclosing all relevant cost information. 4. Jorgenson should discuss the situation with Fenton and point out that the standards are lax and that this practice is unethical. If Fenton does not agree to change, Jorgenson should escalate the issue up the hierarchy in order to effect change. If organizational change is not forthcoming, Jorgenson should be prepared to resign rather than compromise his professional ethics. 5. Main pros of using Benchmarking Clearing House information to compute variances are: (a) Highlights to New Fashions in a direct way how it may or may not be costcompetitive. (b) Provides a reality check to many internal positions about efficiency or effectiveness. Main cons are: (a) New Fashions may not be comparable to companies in the database. (b) Cost data about other companies may not be reliable. (c) Cost of Benchmarking Clearing House reports.

CHAPTER 8 FLEXIBLE BUDGETS, OVERHEAD COST VARIANCES, AND MANAGEMENT CONTROL 8-1 Effective planning of variable overhead costs involves: 1. Planning to undertake only those variable overhead activities that add value for customers using the product or service, and 2. Planning to use the drivers of costs in those activities in the most efficient way.
8-2 At the start of an accounting period, a larger percentage of fixed overhead costs are locked-in than is the case with variable overhead costs. When planning fixed overhead costs, a company must choose the appropriate level of capacity or investment that will benefit the company over a long time. This is a strategic decision. 8-3 The key differences are how direct costs are traced to a cost object and how indirect costs are allocated to a cost object: Actual Costing Actual prices Actual inputs used Actual indirect rate Actual inputs used Standard Costing Standard prices Standard inputs allowed for actual output Standard indirect cost-allocation rate Standard quantity of cost-allocation base allowed for actual output
Direct costs Indirect costs
8-4
Steps in developing a budgeted variable-overhead cost rate are: 1. Choose the period to be used for the budget, 2. Select the cost-allocation bases to use in allocating variable overhead costs to the output produced, 3. Identify the variable overhead costs associated with each cost-allocation base, and 4. Compute the rate per unit of each cost-allocation base used to allocate variable overhead costs to output produced. Two factors affecting the spending variance for variable manufacturing overhead are: a. Price changes of individual inputs (such as energy and indirect materials) included in variable overhead relative to budgeted prices. b. Percentage change in the actual quantity used of individual items included in variable overhead cost pool, relative to the percentage change in the quantity of the cost driver of the variable overhead cost pool. Possible reasons for a favorable variable-overhead efficiency variance are: Workers more skillful in using machines than budgeted, Production scheduler was able to schedule jobs better than budgeted, resulting in lower-than-budgeted machine-hours, Machines operated with fewer slowdowns than budgeted, and Machine time standards were overly lenient.

8-7 A direct materials efficiency variance indicates whether more or less direct materials were used than was budgeted for the actual output achieved. A variable manufacturing overhead efficiency variance indicates whether more or less of the chosen allocation base was used than was budgeted for the actual output achieved. 8-8 Steps in developing a budgeted fixed-overhead rate are 1. Choose the period to use for the budget, 2. Select the cost-allocation base to use in allocating fixed overhead costs to output produced, 3. Identify the fixed-overhead costs associated with each cost-allocation base, and 4. Compute the rate per unit of each cost-allocation base used to allocate fixed overhead costs to output produced. The relationship for fixed-manufacturing overhead variances is:
Flexible-budget variance
8-9
Spending variance
Efficiency variance (never a variance)
There is never an efficiency variance for fixed overhead because managers cannot be more or less efficient in dealing with an amount that is fixed regardless of the output level. The result is that the flexible-budget variance amount is the same as the spending variance for fixedmanufacturing overhead. 8-10 For planning and control purposes, fixed overhead costs are a lump sum amount that is not controlled on a per-unit basis. In contrast, for inventory costing purposes, fixed overhead costs are allocated to products on a per-unit basis. 8-11 An important caveat is what change in selling price might have been necessary to attain the level of sales assumed in the denominator of the fixed manufacturing overhead rate. For example, the entry of a new low-price competitor may have reduced demand below the denominator level if the budgeted selling price was maintained. An unfavorable productionvolume variance may be small relative to the selling-price variance had prices been dropped to attain the denominator level of unit sales.
8-
8-12 A strong case can be made for writing off an unfavorable production-volume variance to cost of goods sold. The alternative is prorating it among inventories and cost of goods sold, but this would penalize the units produced (and in inventory) for the cost of unused capacity, i.e., for the units not produced. But, if we take the view that the denominator level is a soft numberi.e., it is only an estimate, and it is never expected to be reached exactly, then it makes more sense to prorate the production volume variancewhether favorable or notamong the inventory stock and cost of goods sold. Prorating a favorable variance is also more conservative: it results in a lower operating income than if the favorable variance had all been written off to cost of goods sold. Finally, prorating also dampens the efficacy of any steps taken by company management to manage operating income through manipulation of the production volume variance. In sum, a production-volume variance need not always be written off to cost of goods sold. 8-13 The four variances are: Variable manufacturing overhead costs spending variance efficiency variance Fixed manufacturing overhead costs spending variance production-volume variance
8-14 Interdependencies among the variances could arise for the spending and efficiency variances. For example, if the chosen allocation base for the variable overhead efficiency variance is only one of several cost drivers, the variable overhead spending variance will include the effect of the other cost drivers. As a second example, interdependencies can be induced when there are misclassifications of costs as fixed when they are variable, and vice versa. 8-15 Flexible-budget variance analysis can be used in the control of costs in an activity area by isolating spending and efficiency variances at different levels in the cost hierarchy. For example, an analysis of batch costs can show the price and efficiency variances from being able to use longer production runs in each batch relative to the batch size assumed in the flexible budget.

The production-volume variance is $2,400 F. This arises because Esquire utilized its capacity more intensively than budgeted (the actual production of 1,080 suits exceeds the budgeted 1,040 suits). This results in overallocated fixed manufacturing overhead of $2,400 (4 40 $15). Esquire would want to understand the reasons for a favorable production-volume variance. Is the market growing?

3. Spending variance of $176,400U. It is unfavorable because variable manufacturing overhead was 35% higher than planned. A possible explanation could be an increase in energy rates relative to the rate per standard labor-hour assumed in the flexible budget. Efficiency variance of $56,000F. It is favorable because the actual number of direct manufacturing labor-hours required was lower than the number of hours in the flexible budget. Labor was more efficient in producing the baguettes than management had anticipated in the budget. This could occur because of improved morale in the company, which could result from an increase in wages or an improvement in the compensation scheme. Flexible-budget variance of $120,400U. It is unfavorable because the favorable efficiency variance was not large enough to compensate for the large unfavorable spending variance.

2. 3.
The fixed manufacturing overhead is underallocated by $48,000. The production-volume variance of $32,000U captures the difference between the budgeted 3,200,0000 baguettes and the lower actual 2,800,000 baguettes producedthe fixed cost capacity not used. The spending variance of $16,000 unfavorable means that the actual aggregate of fixed costs ($272,000) exceeds the budget amount ($256,000). For example, monthly leasing rates for baguette-making machines may have increased above those in the budget for 2009.

3. Planning and control of variable manufacturing overhead costs has both a long-run and a short-run focus. It involves Solutions planning to undertake only value-added overhead activities (a long-run view) and then managing the cost drivers of those activities in the most efficient way (a short-run view). Planning and control of fixed manufacturing overhead costs at Solutions have primarily a long-run focus. It involves undertaking only value-added fixed-overhead activities for a budgeted level of output. Solutions makes most of the key decisions that determine the level of fixed-overhead costs at the start of the accounting period.

3. Individual fixed manufacturing overhead items are not usually affected very much by day-to-day control. Instead, they are controlled periodically through planning decisions and budgeting procedures that may sometimes have horizons covering six months or a year (for example, management salaries) and sometimes covering many years (for example, long-term leases and depreciation on plant and equipment). 4. The fixed overhead spending variance is caused by the actual realization of fixed costs differing from the budgeted amounts. Some fixed costs are known because they are contractually specified, such as rent or insurance, although if the rental or insurance contract expires during the year, the fixed amount can change. Other fixed costs are estimated, such as the cost of managerial salaries which may depend on bonuses and other payments not known at the beginning of the period. In this example, the spending variance is unfavorable, so actual FOH is greater than the budgeted amount of FOH. The fixed overhead production volume variance is caused by production being over or under expected capacity. You may be under capacity when demand drops from expected levels, or if there are problems with production. Over capacity is usually driven by favorable demand shocks or a desire to increase inventories. The fact that there is a favorable volume variance indicates that production exceeded the expected level of output (4,400 units actual relative to a denominator level of 4,000 output units).

3. The control of variable manufacturing overhead requires the identification of the cost drivers for such items as energy, supplies, and repairs. Control often entails monitoring nonfinancial measures that affect each cost item, one by one. Examples are kilowatt-hours used, quantities of lubricants used, and repair parts and hours used. The most convincing way to discover why overhead performance did not agree with a budget is to investigate possible causes, line item by line item. 4. The variable overhead spending variance is favorable. This means the actual rate applied to the manufacturing costs is lower than the budgeted rate. Since variable overhead consists of several different costs, this could be for a variety of reasons, such as the utility rates being lower than estimated or the indirect materials costs per unit of denominator activity being less than estimated. The variable overhead efficiency variance is unfavorable, which implies that the estimated denominator activity was too low. Since the denominator activity is machine hours, this could be the result of inefficient use of machines, poorly scheduled production runs, or machines that need maintenance and thus are not working at the expected level of efficiency.

3. The spending variances for variable and fixed overhead are both unfavorable. This means that MOW had increases over budget in either or both the cost of individual items (such as telephone calls and gasoline) in the overhead cost pools, or the usage of these individual items per unit of the allocation base (delivery time). The favorable efficiency variance for variable overhead costs results from more efficient use of the cost allocation baseeach delivery takes 0.65 hours versus a budgeted 0.70 hours. MOW can best manage its fixed overhead costs by long-term planning of capacity rather than day-to-day decisions. This involves planning to undertake only value-added fixed-overhead activities and then determining the appropriate level for those activities. Most fixed overhead costs are committed well before they are incurred. In contrast, for variable overhead, a mix of long-run planning and daily monitoring of the use of individual items is required to manage costs efficiently. MOW should plan to undertake only value-added variable-overhead activities (a long-run focus) and then manage the cost drivers of those activities in the most efficient way (a short-run focus). There is no production-volume variance for variable overhead costs. The unfavorable production-volume variance for fixed overhead costs arises because MOW has unused fixed overhead resources that it may seek to reduce in the long run.

8-25 (4050 min.) Total overhead, 3-variance analysis. 1. This problem has two major purposes: (a) to give experience with data allocated on a total overhead basis instead of on separate variable and fixed bases and (b) to reinforce distinctions between actual hours of input, budgeted (standard) hours allowed for actual output, and denominator level. An analysis of direct manufacturing labor will provide the data for actual hours of input and standard hours allowed. One approach is to plug the known figures (designated by asterisks) into the analytical framework and solve for the unknowns. The direct manufacturing labor efficiency variance can be computed by subtracting $3,856 from $5,776. The complete picture is as follows: Flexible Budget: Budgeted Input Allowed for Actual Output Budgeted Rate (4,700 hrs. $16.00*) $75,200
Actual Costs Incurred (4,820 hrs. $16.80) $80,976*
Actual Input Budgeted Rate (4,820hrs. $16.00*) $77,120
$3,856 U* Price variance
$1,920 U Efficiency variance
$5,776 U* Flexible-budget variance
* Given
Direct Labor calculations Actual input Budgeted rate = Actual costs Price variance = $80,976 $3,856 = $77,120 Actual input = $77,120 Budgeted rate = $77,120 $16 = 4,820 hours Budgeted input Budgeted rate = $77,120 Efficiency variance = $77,120 $1,920 = $75,200 Budgeted input = $75,200 Budgeted rate = $75,200 16 = 4,700 hours Production Overhead
Variable overhead rate Budgeted fixed overhead costs = $25,600* 3,200* hrs. = $8.00 per standard labor-hour = $79,040* 4,000* ($8.00) = $47,040
If total overhead is allocated at 120% of direct labor-cost, the single overhead rate must be 120% of $16.00, or $19.20 per hour. Therefore, the fixed overhead component of the rate must be $19.20 $8.00, or $11.20 per direct labor-hour.

2. The direct materials price variance indicates that DDC paid more for brass than they had planned. If this is because they purchased a higher quality of brass, it may explain why they used less brass than expected (leading to a favorable material efficiency variance). In turn, since variable manufacturing overhead is assigned based on pounds of materials used, this directly led to the favorable variable overhead efficiency variance. The purchase of a better quality of brass may also explain why it took less labor time to produce the doorknobs than expected (the favorable direct labor efficiency variance). Finally, the unfavorable direct labor price variance could imply that the workers who were hired were more experienced than expected, which could also be related to the positive direct material and direct labor efficiency variances. 8-29 1. (30 min.) Comprehensive variance analysis. Budgeted number of machine-hours planned can be calculated by multiplying the number of units planned (budgeted) by the number of machine-hours allocated per unit: 888 units 2 machine-hours per unit = 1,776 machine-hours. 2. Budgeted fixed MOH costs per machine-hour can be computed by dividing the flexible budget amount for fixed MOH (which is the same as the static budget) by the number of machine-hours planned (calculated in (a.)): $348,096 1,776 machine-hours = $196.00 per machine-hour 3. Budgeted variable MOH costs per machine-hour are calculated as budgeted variable MOH costs divided by the budgeted number of machine-hours planned: $71,040 1,776 machine-hours = $40.00 per machine-hour. 4. Budgeted number of machine-hours allowed for actual output achieved can be calculated by dividing the flexible-budget amount for variable MOH by budgeted variable MOH costs per machine-hour: $76,800 $40.00 per machine-hour= 1,920 machine-hours allowed 5. The actual number of output units is the budgeted number of machine-hours allowed for actual output achieved divided by the planned allocation rate of machine hours per unit: 1,920 machine-hours 2 machine-hours per unit = 960 units. 6. The actual number of machine-hours used per output unit is the actual number of machine hours used (given) divided by the actual number of units manufactured: 1,824 machine-hours 960 units = 1.9 machine-hours used per output unit.

3. The underallocated manufacturing overhead was: variable, $1,150,000 and fixed, $2,300,000. The flexible-budget variance and underallocated overhead are always the same amount for variable manufacturing overhead, because the flexible-budget amount of variable manufacturing overhead and the allocated amount of variable manufacturing overhead coincide. In contrast, the budgeted and allocated amounts for fixed manufacturing overhead only coincide when the budgeted input of the allocation base for the actual output level achieved exactly equals the denominator level. 4. The choice of the denominator level will affect inventory costs. The new fixed manufacturing overhead rate would be $18,000,000 750,000 = $24 per machine-hour. In turn, the allocated amount of fixed manufacturing overhead and the production-volume variance would change as seen below: Actual $18,050,000 Budget $18,000,000 Allocated 875,000 $24 = $21,000,000
$50,000 U $3,000,000 F* Flexible-budget variance Prodn. volume variance $2,950,000 F Total fixed overhead variance
*Alternate
computation: (750,000 875,000) $24 = $3,000,000 F
The major point of this requirement is that inventory costs (and, hence, income determination) can be heavily affected by the choice of the denominator level used for setting the fixed manufacturing overhead rate.

3. The favorable spending variance for variable manufacturing overhead suggests that less costly items were used, which could have a negative impact on labor efficiency. But note that the workers were paid a higher rate than budgeted, which, if it indicates the hiring of more qualified employees, should lead to favorable labor efficiency variances. Moreover, the price variance and the spending variance are both very small, approximately 1% and 2.5% respectively, while the efficiency variances are very large, each equaling 50% of expected costs. It is clear therefore that the efficiency variances are related to factors other than the cost of the labor or overhead. 4. If the variable overhead consisted only of costs that were related to direct manufacturing labor, then Sarah is correct - both the labor efficiency variance and the variable overhead efficiency variance would reflect real cost overruns due to the inefficient use of labor. However, a portion of variable overhead may be a function of factors other than direct labor (e.g., the costs of energy or the usage of indirect materials). In this case, allocating variable overhead using direct labor as the only base will inflate the effect of inefficient labor usage on the variable overhead efficiency variance. The real effect on firm profitability will be lower, and will likely be captured in a favorable spending variance for variable overhead.

3. The variable overhead spending variance arises from the fact that the cost of horse feed, shampoo, ribbons and other supplies was higher, per weighted average horse-guest week, than expected ($7,500/(95038)lbs = $0.208 per lb&gt;$0.2 per lb). Unlike the material and labor price variances, which only reflect the prices paid, the spending variance could have both a cost and usage component. HHS would have a negative spending variance if they paid more for feed than expected or if the horses ate more feed than expected. 4. The $380 unfavorable variable overhead efficiency variance reflects the fact that the average weight of a horse was higher than expected. HHS expected horses to weigh an average of 900 lbs but during August, the horses weighed an average of 950 lbs. Larger horses are expected to consume more variable overhead, such as horse feed and shampoo, hence the unfavorable nature of the variance. 5. Fixed overhead is fixed with respect to horse weight. This does not mean that it can be forecasted with 100% accuracy. For example, salaries or actual costs for advertising may have been higher than expected, leading to the $4,000 unfavorable variance. 6. The production-volume variance of $2,700 exists because the fixed overhead rate was based on the forecasted number of horse guest-weeks, 40, while the fixed overhead was applied using the actual number of horse guest-weeks, 38. The overestimation of the number of horse guests in August would lead to an under-absorption of fixed overhead, resulting in the unfavorable production-volume variance. If the estimate was too far off from the actual number of horses, HHS might potentially not charge enough to cover their costs.

Production at capacity would result in a production-volume variance of 0 since the fixed overhead rate is based upon expected hours at capacity production. However, the existence of an unfavorable volume variance does not necessarily imply that management is doing a poor job or incurring unnecessary costs. Using the suggestions in the problem, two reasons can be identified. a. For most products, demand varies from month to month while commitment to the factors that determine capacity, e.g. size of workshop or supervisory staff, tends to remain relatively constant. If Dawn wants to meet demand in high demand months, it will have excess capacity in low demand months. In addition, forecasts of future demand contain uncertainty due to unknown future factors. Having some excess capacity would allow Dawn to produce enough to cover peak demand as well as slack to deal with unexpected demand surges in non-peak months. b. Basic economics provides a demand curve that shows a tradeoff between price charged and quantity demanded. Potentially, Dawn could have a lower net revenue if they produce at capacity and sell at a lower price than if they sell at a higher price at some level below capacity. In addition, the unfavorable production-volume variance may not represent a feasible cost savings associated with lower capacity. Even if Dawn could shift to lower fixed costs by lowering capacity, the fixed cost may behave as a step function. If so, fixed costs would decrease in fixed amounts associated with a range of production capacity, not a specific production volume. The production-volume variance would only accurately identify potential cost savings if the fixed cost function is continuous, not discrete.

4. The static-budget operating income for February is: Revenues $55 1,000 Variable costs $25 1,000 Fixed overhead costs Static-budget operating income The flexible-budget operating income for February is: Revenues $55 600 Variable costs $25 600 Fixed overhead costs Flexible-budget operating income
$55,000 25,000 9,000 $ 21,000
$33,000 15,000 9,000 $ 9,000
The sales-volume variance represents the difference between the static-budget operating income and the flexible-budget operating income: Static-budget operating income Flexible-budget operating income Sales-volume variance $21,000 9,000 $12,000 U
Equivalently, the sales-volume variance captures the fact that when Dawn sells 600 units instead of the budgeted 1,000, only the revenue and the variable costs are affected. Fixed costs remain unchanged. Therefore, the shortfall in profit is equal to the budgeted contribution margin per unit times the shortfall in output relative to budget.
Sales-volume = variance
Budgeted Budgeted variable cost selling price per unit
Difference in quantity of units sold relative to the static budget
= ($55 $25) 400 = $30 400 = $12,000 U In contrast, we computed in requirement 2 that the production-volume variance was $3,600U. This captures only the portion of the budgeted fixed overhead expected to be unabsorbed because of the 400-unit shortfall. To compare it to the sales-volume variance, consider the following: Budgeted selling price Budgeted variable cost per unit Budgeted fixed cost per unit ($9,000 1,000) Budgeted cost per unit Budgeted profit per unit Operating income based on budgeted profit per unit $21 per unit 600 units $55 $25 9 34 $ 21
$12,600

The $3,600 U production-volume variance explains the difference between operating income based on the budgeted profit per unit and the flexible-budget operating income: Operating income based on budgeted profit per unit Production-volume variance Flexible-budget operating income $12,600 3,600 U $ 9,000
Since the sales-volume variance represents the difference between the static- and flexible-budget operating incomes, the difference between the sales-volume and production-volume variances, which is referred to as the operating-income volume variance is: Operating-income volume variance = Sales-volume variance Production-volume variance = Static-budget operating income - Operating income based on budgeted profit per unit = $21,000 U $12,600 U = $8,400 U. The operating-income volume variance explains the difference between the static-budget operating income and the budgeted operating income for the units actually sold. The staticbudget operating income is $21,000 and the budgeted operating income for 600 units would have been $12,600 ($21 operating income per unit 600 units). The difference, $8,400 U, is the operating-income volume variance, i.e., the 400 unit drop in actual volume relative to budgeted volume would have caused an expected drop of $8,400 in operating income, at the budgeted operating income of $21 per unit. The operating-income volume variance assumes that $50,000 in fixed cost ($9 per unit 400 units) would be saved if production and sales volumes decreased by 400 units.

2. The control of variable manufacturing overhead requires the identification of the cost drivers for such items as energy, supplies, and repairs. Control often entails monitoring nonfinancial measures that affect each cost item, one by one. Examples are kilowatts used, quantities of lubricants used, and repair parts and hours used. The most convincing way to discover why overhead performance did not agree with a budget is to investigate possible causes, line item by line item. Individual fixed overhead items are not usually affected very much by day-to-day control. Instead, they are controlled periodically through planning decisions and budgeting procedures that may sometimes have planning horizons covering six months or a year (for example, management salaries) and sometimes covering many years (for example, long-term leases and depreciation on plant and equipment).

8-42 (20 minutes) Non-financial performance measures 1. The cost of the ball bearings would be indirect materials if it is either not possible to trace the costs to individual products, or if the cost is so small relative to other costs that it is impractical to do so. Since Department B makes a fairly constant number of finished products (400 units) each day, it would be easy to trace the cost of bearings to the wheels completed daily. However, the fact that Rollie measures ball bearings by weight and discards leftover bearings at the end of each day suggests that they are a relatively inexpensive item and not worth the effort to restock or track in inventory. As such, it could be argued that ball bearings should be classified as overhead (e.g., indirect materials). 2. Non-financial performance measures for Department B might include: Number or proportion of wheels sent back for rework and/or amount or proportion time spent on rework; Number of wheels thrown away, ratio of wheels thrown away to wheels reworked, and/or ratio of bad to good wheels; Amount of down time for broken machines during the day; Weight of ball bearings discarded, or ratio of weights used and discarded.
of
3. If the number of wheels thrown away is significant relative to the number of reworked wheels, then it is not efficient to rework them and so Rollie should re-examine the rework process or even just throw away all the bad wheels without rework. If the amount of rework is significant then the original process is not turning out quality goods in a timely manner. Rollie might slow down the process in Department B so it takes a little longer to make each good wheel, but the number of good wheels will be higher and may even save time overall if rework time drops considerably. They might also need to service the machines more often than just after the total daily production run, in which case they will trade off intentional down time for more efficient processing. If the amount of unintentional down time is significant they might bring in the mechanics during the day to fix a machine that goes down during a production run. Finally, Rollie might consider determining a better measure of ball bearings to requisition each day so that fewer are discarded, and might also keep any leftover ball bearings for use the next day.

Collaborative Learning Problem 8-43 1. a. (45 min.) Overhead variances, ethics. Total budgeted overhead Budgeted variable overhead ($10 budgeted rate per machine-hour 2,500,000 budgeted machine-hours) Budgeted fixed overhead $31,250,000

$6,250,000 budgeted amount = $2.50 per machine-hour 2,500,000 budgeted machine-hours
Fixed overhead spending variance = Actual costs incurred Budgeted amount. Because fixed overhead spending variance is unfavorable, the amount of actual costs is higher than the budgeted amount. Actual cost = $6,250,000 + $1,500,000 = $7,750,000

3. By manipulating, Remich has created a sizable unfavorable fixed overhead spending variance or, at least, has increased its magnitude. Jack Remichs action is clearly unethical. Variances draw attention to the areas that need management attention. If the top management relies on Remich, due to his expertise, to interpret and explain the reasons for the unfavorable variance, it is likely that his report will be biased and misleading to the top management. The top management may erroneously conclude that Monroe is not able to manage his fixed overhead costs effectively. Another probable adverse outcome of Remichs actions will be that Monroe will have even less confidence in the usefulness of accounting reports. This, of course, defeats the purpose of preparing the reports. In summary, Remichs unethical actions will waste top managements time and may lead to wrong decisions.

CHAPTER 9 INVENTORY COSTING AND CAPACITY ANALYSIS 9-1 No. Differences in operating income between variable costing and absorption costing are due to accounting for fixed manufacturing costs. Under variable costing only variable manufacturing costs are included as inventoriable costs. Under absorption costing both variable and fixed manufacturing costs are included as inventoriable costs. Fixed marketing and distribution costs are not accounted for differently under variable costing and absorption costing. 9-2 The term direct costing is a misnomer for variable costing for two reasons: a. Variable costing does not include all direct costs as inventoriable costs. Only variable direct manufacturing costs are included. Any fixed direct manufacturing costs, and any direct nonmanufacturing costs (either variable or fixed), are excluded from inventoriable costs. b. Variable costing includes as inventoriable costs not only direct manufacturing costs but also some indirect costs (variable indirect manufacturing costs).
9-3 No. The difference between absorption costing and variable costs is due to accounting for fixed manufacturing costs. As service or merchandising companies have no fixed manufacturing costs, these companies do not make choices between absorption costing and variable costing. 9-4 The main issue between variable costing and absorption costing is the proper timing of the release of fixed manufacturing costs as costs of the period: a. at the time of incurrence, or b. at the time the finished units to which the fixed overhead relates are sold. Variable costing uses (a) and absorption costing uses (b). 9-5 No. A company that makes a variable-cost/fixed-cost distinction is not forced to use any specific costing method. The Stassen Company example in the text of Chapter 9 makes a variable-cost/fixed-cost distinction. As illustrated, it can use variable costing, absorption costing, or throughput costing. A company that does not make a variable-cost/fixed-cost distinction cannot use variable costing or throughput costing. However, it is not forced to adopt absorption costing. For internal reporting, it could, for example, classify all costs as costs of the period in which they are incurred. 9-6 Variable costing does not view fixed costs as unimportant or irrelevant, but it maintains that the distinction between behaviors of different costs is crucial for certain decisions. The planning and management of fixed costs is critical, irrespective of what inventory costing method is used. 9-7 Under absorption costing, heavy reductions of inventory during the accounting period might combine with low production and a large production volume variance. This combination could result in lower operating income even if the unit sales level rises. 9-8 (a) The factors that affect the breakeven point under variable costing are: 1. Fixed (manufacturing and operating) costs. 2. Contribution margin per unit.
9-1
(b) The factors that affect the breakeven point under absorption costing are: 1. Fixed (manufacturing and operating) costs. 2. Contribution margin per unit. 3. Production level in units in excess of breakeven sales in units. 4. Denominator level chosen to set the fixed manufacturing cost rate. 9-9 Examples of dysfunctional decisions managers may make to increase reported operating income are: a. Plant managers may switch production to those orders that absorb the highest amount of fixed manufacturing overhead, irrespective of the demand by customers. b. Plant managers may accept a particular order to increase production even though another plant in the same company is better suited to handle that order. c. Plant managers may defer maintenance beyond the current period to free up more time for production. 9-10 Approaches used to reduce the negative aspects associated with using absorption costing include: a. Change the accounting system: Adopt either variable or throughput costing, both of which reduce the incentives of managers to produce for inventory. Adopt an inventory holding charge for managers who tie up funds in inventory. b. Extend the time period used to evaluate performance. By evaluating performance over a longer time period (say, 3 to 5 years), the incentive to take short-run actions that reduce long-term income is lessened. c. Include nonfinancial as well as financial variables in the measures used to evaluate performance. 9-11 The theoretical capacity and practical capacity denominator-level concepts emphasize what a plant can supply. The normal capacity utilization and master-budget capacity utilization concepts emphasize what customers demand for products produced by a plant. 9-12 The downward demand spiral is the continuing reduction in demand for a companys product that occurs when the prices of competitors products are not met and (as demand drops further), higher and higher unit costs result in more and more reluctance to meet competitors prices. Pricing decisions need to consider competitors and customers as well as costs. 9-13 No. It depends on how a company handles the production-volume variance in the end-ofperiod financial statements. For example, if the adjusted allocation-rate approach is used, each denominator-level capacity concept will give the same financial statement numbers at year-end. 9-14 For tax reporting in the U.S., the IRS requires companies to use the practical capacity concept. At year-end, proration of any variances between inventories and cost of goods sold is required (unless the variance is immaterial in amount). 9-15 No. The costs of having too much capacity/too little capacity involve revenue opportunities potentially forgone as well as costs of money tied up in plant assets. 9-16 (30 min.)

Operating income under: Absorption costing Variable costing Throughput costing April $1,850,000 1,250,000 755,000 May $2,640,000 3,120,000 3,516,000
In April, throughput costing has the lowest operating income, whereas in May throughput costing has the highest operating income. Throughput costing puts greater emphasis on sales as the source of operating income than does either absorption or variable costing. 3. Throughput costing puts a penalty on production without a corresponding sale in the same period. Costs other than direct materials that are variable with respect to production are expensed in the period of incurrence, whereas under variable costing they would be capitalized. As a result, throughput costing provides less incentive to produce for inventory than either variable costing or absorption costing.

I would recommend absorption costing because it considers all the manufacturing resources (whether variable or fixed) used to produce units of output. Absorption costing has many critics. However, the dysfunctional aspects associated with absorption costing can be reduced by Careful budgeting and inventory planning.

3. 2009 operating income under absorption costing is greater than the operating income under variable costing because in 2009 inventories increased by 1,040 units, and under absorption costing fixed overhead remained in the ending inventory, and resulted in a lower cost of goods sold (relative to variable costing). As shown below, the difference in the two operating incomes is exactly the same as the difference in the fixed manufacturing costs included in ending vs. beginning inventory (under absorption costing). Operating income under absorption costing Operating income under variable costing Difference in operating income under absorption vs. variable costing Under absorption costing: Fixed mfg. costs in ending inventory (1,040 units $165 per unit) Fixed mfg. costs in beginning inventory (0 units $165 per unit) Change in fixed mfg. costs between ending and beginning inventory $2,703,120 2,531,520 $ 171,600

4. Relative to the obvious alternative of using contribution margin (from variable costing), the absorption-costing based gross margin has some pros and cons as a performance measure for Electrons supervisors. It takes into account both variable costs and fixed costscosts that the supervisors should be able to control in the long-runand therefore it is a more complete measure than contribution margin which ignores fixed costs (and may cause the supervisors to pay less attention to fixed costs). The downside of using absorption-costing-based gross margin is the supervisors temptation to use inventory levels to control the gross marginin particular, to shore up a sagging gross margin by building up inventories. This can be offset by specifying, or limiting, the inventory build-up that can occur, charging the supervisor a carrying cost for holding inventory, and using nonfinancial performance measures such as the ratio of ending to beginning inventory.

$0.50 400 $0 $200 ($0.70 200) ($0.50 400) $60
The difference in reported operating income is due to the amount of fixed manufacturing overhead in the beginning and ending inventories. In Year 1, absorption costing has a higher operating income of $200 due to ending inventory having $200 more in fixed manufacturing overhead than does beginning inventory. In Year 2, variable costing has a higher operating income of $60 due to ending inventory under absorption costing having $60 less in fixed manufacturing overhead than does beginning inventory. 4. a. Absorption costing is more likely to lead to inventory build-ups than variable costing. Under absorption costing, operating income in a given accounting period is increased by inventory buildup, because some fixed manufacturing costs are accounted for as an asset (inventory) instead of as a cost of the period of production. b. Although variable costing will counteract undesirable inventory build-ups, other measures can be used without abandoning absorption costing. Examples include: (1) careful budgeting and inventory planning, (2) incorporating a carrying charge for inventory, (3) changing the period used to evaluate performance to be long-term, (4) including nonfinancial variables that measure inventory levels in performance evaluations.

(40 min.) Variable and absorption costing, sales, and operating-income changes.
1. Headsmarts annual fixed manufacturing costs are $1,200,000. It allocates $24 of fixed manufacturing costs to each unit produced. Therefore, it must be using $1,200,000 $24 = 50,000 units (annually) as the denominator level to allocate fixed manufacturing costs to the units produced. We can see from Headsmarts income statements that it disposes off any production volume variance against cost of goods sold. In 2009, 60,000 units were produced instead of the budgeted 50,000 units. This resulted in a favorable production volume variance of $240,000 F ((60,000 50,000) units $24 per unit), which, when written off against cost of goods sold, increased gross margin by that amount. 2. The breakeven calculation, same for each year, is shown below: Calculation of breakeven volume Selling price ($2,100,000 50,000; $2,100,000 50,000; $2,520,000 60,000) Variable cost per unit (all manufacturing) Contribution margin per unit Total fixed costs (fixed mfg. costs + fixed selling&amp;admin. costs) Breakeven quantity = Total fixed costs contribution margin per unit 3.

In the table above, row (3) shows the difference between the operating income under absorption costing and the operating income under variable costing, for each of the three years. In 2008, the difference is $0; in 2009, absorption costing income is greater by $240,000; and in 2010, it is less by $240,000. Row (6) above shows the difference between the fixed costs in ending inventory and the fixed costs in beginning inventory under absorption costing, which is $0 in 2008, $240,000 in 2009 and -$240,000 in 2010. Row (3) and row (6) explain and reconcile the operating income differences between absorption costing and variable costing. Stuart Weil is surprised at the non-zero, positive net income (reported under absorption costing) in 2009, when sales were at the breakeven volume of 50,000; further, he is concerned about the drop in operating income in 2010, when, in fact, sales increased to 60,000 units. In 2009, starting with zero inventories, 60,000 units were produced, 50,000 were sold, i.e., at the end of the year, 10,000 units remained in inventory. These 10,000 units had each absorbed $24 of fixed costs (total of $240,000), which would remain as assets on Headsmarts balance sheet until they were sold. Cost of goods sold, representing only the costs of the 50,000 units sold in 2009, was accordingly reduced by $240,000, the production volume variance, resulting in a positive operating income even though sales were at breakeven levels. The following year, in 2010, production was 50,000 units, sales were 60,000 units i.e., all of the fixed costs that were included in 2009 ending inventory, flowed through COGS in 2010. Contribution margin in 2010 was $1,680,000 (60,000 units $28), but, in absorption costing, COGS also contains the allocated fixed manufacturing costs of the units sold, which were $1,440,000 (60,000 units $24), resulting in an operating income of $40,000 = 1,680,000 $1,440,000 $200,000 (fixed sales and admin.) Hence the drop in operating income under absorption costing, even though sales were greater than the computed breakeven volume: inventory levels decreased sufficiently in 2010 to cause 2010s operating income to be lower than 2009 operating income. Note that beginning and ending with zero inventories during the 20082010 period, under both costing methods, Headsmarts total operating income was $280,000.

The rates are different because of varying denominator-level concepts. Theoretical and practical capacity levels are driven by supply-side concepts, i.e., how much can I produce? Normal and master-budget capacity levels are driven by demand-side concepts, i.e., how much can I sell? (or how much should I produce?) The variances that arise from use of the theoretical or practical level concepts will signal that there is a divergence between the supply of capacity and the demand for capacity. This is useful input to managers. As a general rule, however, it is important not to place undue reliance on the production volume variance as a measure of the economic costs of unused capacity.

3. Under a cost-based pricing system, the choice of a master-budget level denominator will lead to high prices when demand is low (more fixed costs allocated to the individual product level), further eroding demand; conversely, it will lead to low prices when demand is high, forgoing profits. This has been referred to as the downward demand spiralthe continuing reduction in demand that occurs when the prices of competitors are not met and demand drops, resulting in even higher unit costs and even more reluctance to meet the prices of competitors. The positive aspects of the master-budget denominator level are that it is based on demand for the product and indicates the price at which all costs per unit would be recovered to enable the company to make a profit. Master-budget denominator level is also a good benchmark against which to evaluate performance.

5. Absorption costing is more likely to lead to buildups of inventory than does variable costing. Absorption costing enables managers to increase reported operating income by building up inventory which reduces the amount of fixed manufacturing overhead included in the current periods cost of goods sold. Ways to reduce this incentive include (a) Careful budgeting and inventory planning. (b) Change the accounting system to variable costing or throughput costing. (c) Incorporate a carrying charge for carrying inventory. (d) Use a longer time period to evaluate performance than a quarter or a year. (e) Include nonfinancial as well as financial measures when evaluating management performance.

(40 min.) Variable costing and absorption costing, the All-Fixed Company.
This problem always generates active classroom discussion. 1. The treatment of fixed manufacturing overhead in absorption costing is affected primarily by what denominator level is selected as a base for allocating fixed manufacturing costs to units produced. In this case, is 10,000 tons per year, 20,000 tons, or some other denominator level the most appropriate base? We usually place the following possibilities on the board or overhead projector and then ask the students to indicate by vote how many used one denominator level versus another. Incidentally, discussion tends to move more clearly if variable-costing income statements are discussed first, because there is little disagreement as to computations under variable costing. a.

Breakeven point under variable = costing
Fixed costs $320,000 = Contribution margin per ton $30
= 10,667 (rounded) tons per year or 21,334 for two years. If the company could sell 667 more tons per year at $30 each, it could get the extra $20,000 contribution margin needed to break even. Most students will say that the breakeven point is 10,667 tons per year under both absorption costing and variable costing. The logical question to ask a student who answers 10,667 tons for variable costing is: What operating income do you show for 2008 under absorption costing? If a student answers $120,000 (alternative 1 above), or $260,000 (alternative 2 above), ask: But you say your breakeven point is 10,667 tons. How can you show an operating income on only 10,000 tons sold during 2008? The answer to the above dilemma lies in the fact that operating income is affected by both sales and production under absorption costing. Given that sales would be 10,000 tons in 2008, solve for the production level that will provide a breakeven level of zero operating income. Using the formula in the chapter, sales of 10,000 units, and a fixed manufacturing overhead rate of $14 (based on $280,000 20,000 units denominator level = $14): Let P = Production level Target Fixed manuf. Breakeven Units Total fixed costs operating overhead sales in produced income units rate Breakeven = sales Unit contribution margin in units $320000 $0 $14(10000 P) 10,000 tons = $30 $300,000 = $320,000 + $140,000 $14P $14P = $160,000 P = 11,429 units (rounded) Proof: Gross margin, 10,000 ($30 $14) Production-volume variance, (20,000 11,429) $14 Marketing and administrative costs Operating income (due to rounding) $160,000 $119,994 40,000 $

Given that production would be 20,000 tons in 2008, solve for the breakeven unit sales level. Using the formula in the chapter and a fixed manufacturing overhead rate of $14 (based on a denominator level of 20,000 units): Let N = Breakeven sales in units Target Fixed manuf. Units Total fixed costs operating overhead N produced income rate N = Unit contribution margin $320,000 + $0 + $14(N 20,000) N = $30 $30N = $320,000 + $14N $280,000 $16N = $40,000 N = 2,500 units Proof: Gross margin, 2,500 ($30 $14) $40,000 Production-volume variance $ 0 Marketing and administrative costs 40,000 40,000 Operating income $ 0 We find it helpful to put the following comparisons on the board: Variable costing breakeven = f(sales) = 10,667 tons = f(sales and production) = f(10,000 and 11,429) = f(2,500 and 20,000)
Absorption costing breakeven
3. Absorption costing inventory cost: Either $140,000 or $280,000 at the end of 2008 and zero at the end of 2009. Variable costing: Zero at all times. This is a major criticism of variable costing and focuses on the issue of the definition of an asset. 4. Operating income is affected by both production and sales under absorption costing. Hence, most managers would prefer absorption costing because their performance in any given reporting period, at least in the short run, is influenced by how much production is scheduled near the end of a period.

Comparison of variable costing and absorption costing.
1. Since production volume variance is unfavorable, the budgeted fixed manufacturing overhead must be larger than the fixed manufacturing overhead allocated. Production - volume variance $400,000 = Budgeted fixed Fixed manufacturing manufacturing overhead overhead allocated
= $1,200,000 Allocated
Allocated = $800,000, which is 67% of $1,200,000 If 67% of the budgeted fixed costs were allocated, the plant must have been operating at 67% of denominator level in 2009. 2. The problem provides the beginning and ending inventory balances under both, variable and absorption costing. Under variable costing, all fixed costs are written off as period costs, i.e., they are not inventoried. Under absorption costing, inventories include variable and fixed costs. Therefore the difference between inventory under absorption costing and inventory under variable costing is the amount of fixed costs included in the inventory. Fixed Manuf. Overhead in Inventory $520,000 140,000
Absorption Costing Inventories: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2009 $1,720,000 206,000
Variable Costing $1,200,000 66,000
3. Note that the answer to (3) is independent of (1). The difference in operating income of $380,000 ($1,520,000 $1,140,000) is explained by the release of $380,000 of fixed manufacturing costs when the inventories were decreased during 2009: Fixed Manuf. Overhead in Inventory $520,000 140,000 $380,000
Absorption Costing Inventories: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2009 Release of fixed manuf. costs $1,720,000 206,000
Variable Costing $1,200,000 66,000
The above schedule in this requirement is a formal presentation of the equation:
=
($1,140,000 $1,520,000) = ($140,000 $520,000) $380,000 = $380,000 Alternatively, the presence of fixed manufacturing overhead costs in each income statement can be analyzed:

Under absorption costing, operating income is a function of both sales and production (i.e., change in inventory levels). During 2009, Hinkle experienced a severe decline in inventory levels: sales were probably higher than anticipated, production was probably lower than planned (at 67% of denominator level), resulting in much of the 2009 beginning inventory passing through cost of goods sold in 2009. This means that under absorption costing, large amounts of inventoried fixed costs have flowed through 2009 cost of goods sold, resulting in a smaller operating income than in 2008, despite an increase in sales volume. 9-31 (30 min.)

While adjusting for ending inventory does to some degree mitigate the increase in inventory associated with excess production, it may be difficult to mechanically compensate for all of the increased income. In addition, it does nothing to hold the manager responsible for the poor decisions from the organizations standpoint. 3b. 10,000 books 1) Inventory change: End inventory begin inventory 2) Excess production (%) Production sales 0 12,000 books 2,000 books 16,000 books 6,000 books

A ratio of ending inventory to beginning inventory, as suggested in the book, is not possible since beginning inventory was 0, so we substituted change in inventory level. For these non-financial measures to be useful they must be incorporated into the reward function of the manager.

Motivational considerations in denominator-level capacity selection (continuation of 9-32).
1. If the plant manager gets a bonus based on operating income, he/she will prefer the denominator-level capacity to be based on normal capacity utilization (or master-budget utilization). In times of rising inventories, as in 2009, this denominator level will maximize the fixed overhead trapped in ending inventories and will minimize COGS and maximize operating income. Of course, the plant manager cannot always hope to increase inventories every period, but on the whole, he/she would still prefer to use normal capacity utilization because the smaller the denominator, the higher the amount of overhead costs capitalized for inventory units. Thus, if the plant manager wishes to be able to adjust plant operating income by building inventory, normal capacity utilization (or master-budget capacity utilization) would be preferred. 2. Given the data in this question, the theoretical capacity concept reports the lowest operating income and thus (other things being equal) the lowest tax bill for 2009. Lucky Lager benefits by having deductions as early as possible. The theoretical capacity denominator-level concept maximizes the deductions for manufacturing costs. 3. The IRS may restrict the flexibility of a company in several ways: a. Restrict the denominator-level concept choice (to say, practical capacity). b. Restrict the cost line items that can be expensed rather than inventoried. c. Restrict the ability of a company to use shorter write-off periods or more accelerated write-off periods for inventoriable costs. d. Require proration or allocation of variances to represent actual costs and actual capacity used.

3. Koshus 2009 beginning inventory was 10,000 units; its ending inventory was 2,000 units. So, during 2009, there was a drop of 8,000 units in inventory levels (matching the 8,000 more units sold than produced). The smaller the denominator level, the larger is the budgeted fixed cost allocated to each unit of production, and, when those units are sold (all the current production is sold, and then some), the larger is the cost of each unit sold, and the smaller is the operating income. Normal utilization capacity is the smallest capacity of the three, hence in this year, when production was less than sales, the absorption-costing based operating income is the smallest when normal capacity utilization is used as the denominator level. 4. Reconciliation Theoretical Capacity Operating Income Practical Capacity Operating Income Decrease in inventory level during 2009 8,000 Fixed mfg cost allocated per unit under practical capacity fixed mfg. cost allocated per unit under theoretical capacity ($12 $10) $2 Additional allocated fixed cost included in COGS under practical capacity = 8,000 units $2 per unit =

$16,000
More fixed manufacturing costs are included in inventory under practical capacity, so, when inventory level decreases (as it did in 2009), more fixed manufacturing costs are included in COGS under practical capacity than under theoretical capacity, resulting in a lower operating income.

To maximize operating income, the executive vice president would favor using normal capacity utilization rather than practical capacity. Why? Because normal capacity utilization is a smaller base than practical capacity, resulting in any year-end inventory having a higher unit cost. Thus, less fixed manufacturing overhead would become a 2009 expense as part of the production-volume variance if normal capacity utilization were used as the denominator level.

3. We can see that when the budgeted production is used as the denominator level and this level changes with anticipated demand, then the full manufacturing cost per unit and therefore the selling price can be quite sensitive to the denominator level. In this case, the denominator level has fallen by 20% [(7,500 6,000) 7,500] and the allocated fixed cost has increased by 25% [($375 $300) 300], resulting in an 18.75% [($950 $800) $800] increase in selling price. If Networks market is becoming more competitive because of foreign entrants, raising the selling price could further drive away customers, lower the budgeted capacity and raise the fixed cost per unit, that is, lead to a downward spiral. If Networks production plant was built for a practical capacity of 7,500 units, a denominator level of 7,500 units should be used, and the cost of excess capacity should not be charged to the units produced and sold. This will focus managerial attention on the unused capacity. If the competitive trends continue, Network will need to cut back its installed capacity to stay competitive. 4. Suppose Network sells x units each year. Its total cost to manufacture the x units would be $100x + $2,250,000. Its total cost to purchase x units would be $400x + $450,000. Therefore, Network should manufacture in-house, if $100x + $2,250,000&lt;$400x + $450,000; i.e., if x&gt;6,000 units. In-house, the cost structure is a low variable cost, high fixed cost structure, and only worth pursuing for high volumes. The source-outside cost structure is a high variable cost, low fixed cost structure, and only worth pursuing for small volumes. Currently, demand is exactly at 6,000 units. Network should conduct some research to forecast future demand patterns. If it seems likely that demand is going to fall below 6,000, it may be better to shut down its production capacity and outsource all of its needed units. This may also allow the management to examine and pursue other business options, as its current business gets increasingly competitive.

(35 min.) Operating income effects of denominator-level choice and disposal of production-volume variance (continuation of 9-37)
1. Since no beginning inventories exist, if ELF sells all 220,000 bulbs manufactured, its operating income will be the same under all four capacity options. Calculations are provided below:
Revenue Less: Cost of goods sold a Production volume variance Gross margin Variable selling b Fixed selling Operating income

 3.75, 4.50, 6.50, 7.50 0.25
2. If the manager of ELF produces and sells 220,000 bulbs, then all capacity levels will result in the same operating income of $125,000 (see requirement 1 above). If the manager of ELF is able to sell only 200,000 of the bulbs produced and if the production-volume variance is closed to cost of goods sold, then the operating income is given as in requirement 3 of 9-37. Both sets of numbers are reproduced below.
Income with sales of 220,000 bulbs Income with sales of 200,000 bulbs Decrease in income when there is over production Theoretical $125,000 25,000 $100,000 Practical $125,000 40,000 $ 85,000 Normal $125,000 80,000 $ 45,000 Master Budget $125,000 100,000 $ 25,000
Comparing these results, it is clear that for a given level of overproduction relative to sales, the managers performance will appear better if he/she uses as the denominator a level that is lower. In this example, setting the denominator to equal the master budget (the lowest of the four capacity levels here), minimizes the loss to the manager from being unable to sell the entire production quantity of 220,000 bulbs.
9-42
3. In this scenario, the manager of ELF produces 220,000 bulbs and sells 200,000 of them, and the production volume variance is prorated. Given the absence of ending work in process inventory or beginning inventory of any kind, the fraction of the production volume variance that is absorbed into the cost of goods sold is given by 200,000/220,000 or 10/11. The operating income under various denominator levels is then given by the following modification of the solution to requirement 3 of 9-37:
Revenue Less: Cost of goods sold Prorated productionvolume variance a Gross margin Variable selling b Fixed selling Operating income
a (10/11) b200,000
Theoretical $1,800,000 750,000 659,091 U 390,909 50,000 250,000 $ 90,909
Practical $1,800,000 900,000 509,091 U 390,909 50,000 250,000 $ 90,909
Normal $1,800,000 1,300,000 109,091 U 390,909 50,000 250,000 $ 90,909
Master Budget $1,800,000 1,500,000 (90,909) F 390,909 50,000 250,000 $ 90,909
 725,000, 560,000, 120,000, 100,000 0.25
Under the proration approach, operating income is $90,909 regardless of the denominator initially used. Thus, in contrast to the case where the production volume variance is written off to cost of goods sold, there is no temptation under the proration approach for the manager to play games with the choice of denominator level.

1. The 2009 budgeted fixed costs are $1,533,000. Deliman budgets for 1,022,000 meals in 2009, and this is used as the denominator level to calculate the fixed cost per meal. $1,533,000 1,022,000 = $1.50 fixed cost per meal. (see column (1) in Solution Exhibit 9-39). 2. In 2010, 3 hospitals have dropped out of the purchasing group and the master budget is 876,000 meals. If this is used as the denominator level, fixed cost per meal = $1,533,000 876,000 = $1.75 per meal, and the total budgeted cost per meal would be $6.25 (see column (3) in Solution Exhibit 9-39). If the hospitals have already been complaining about quality and cost and are allowed to purchase from outside, they will not accept this higher price. More hospitals may begin to purchase meals from outside the system, leading to a downward demand spiral, possibly putting Deliman out of business. 3. The basic problem is that Deliman has excess capacity and the associated excess fixed costs. If Smith uses the practical capacity of 1,460,000 meals as the denominator level, the fixed cost per meal will be $1.05 (see column (2) in Solution Exhibit 9-39), and the total budgeted cost per meal would be $5.55, probably a more acceptable price to the customers (it may even draw back the three hospitals that have chosen to buy outside). This denominator level will also isolate the cost of unused capacity and not allocate it to the meals produced. To make the $5.55 price per meal profitable in the long run, Smith will have to find ways to either use the extra capacity or reduce Delimans practical capacity and the related fixed costs.
9-44

(20 min.) Cost allocation, responsibility accounting, ethics (continuation of 9-39).
1. (See Solution Exhibit 9-39). If Deliman uses its master budget capacity utilization to allocate fixed costs in 2010, it would allocate 806,840 $1.75 = $1,411,970. Budgeted fixed costs are $1,533,000. Therefore, the production volume variance = $1,533,000 $1,411,970 = $121,030 U. An unfavorable production volume variance will reduce operating income by this amount. (Note: in this business, there are no inventories. All variances are written off to cost of goods sold). 2. Hospitals are charged a budgeted variable cost rate and allocated budgeted fixed costs. By overestimating budgeted meal counts, the denominator-level is larger, hence the amount charged to individual hospitals is lower. Consider 2010 where the budgeted fixed cost rate is computed as follows: $1,533,000/876,000 meals = $1.75 per meal If in fact, the hospital administrators had better estimated and revealed their true demand (say, 806,800 meals), the allocated fixed cost per meal would have been $1,533,000/806,800 meals = $1.90 per meal, 8.6% higher than the $1.75 per meal. Hence, by deliberately overstating budgeted meal count, hospitals are able to reduce the price charged by Deliman for each meal. In this scheme, Deliman bears the downside risk of demand overestimates. 3. Evidence that could be collected include: (a) Budgeted meal-count estimates and actual meal-count figures each year for each hospital controller. Over an extended time period, there should be a sizable number of both underestimates and overestimates. Controllers could be ranked on both their percentage of overestimation and the frequency of their overestimation. (b) Look at the underlying demand estimates by patients at individual hospitals. Each hospital controller has other factors (such as hiring of nurses) that give insight into their expectations of future meal-count demands. If these factors are inconsistent with the meal-count demand figures provided to the central food-catering facility, explanations should be sought. 4. (a) Highlight the importance of a corporate culture of honesty and openness. Deli One could institute a Code of Ethics that highlights the upside of individual hospitals providing honest estimates of demand (and the penalties for those who do not). (b) Have individual hospitals contract in advance for their budgeted meal count. Unused amounts would be charged to each hospital at the end of the accounting period. This approach puts a penalty on hospital administrators who overestimate demand. (c) Use an incentive scheme that has an explicit component for meal-count forecasting accuracy. Each meal-count forecasting error would reduce the bonus by $0.05. Thus, if a hospital bids for 292,000 meals and actually uses 200,000 meals, its bonus would be reduced by $0.05 (292,000 200,000) = $4,600.

4. The benefit of using throughput costing is that net income is reduced if managers produce more units than they can sell. By treating all costs, except direct material costs, as period costs, the income statement expenses not only the cost of goods sold but also the direct labor and variable overhead costs associated with units in ending inventory. So reported income is reduced by the cost of unnecessary production. For performance evaluation purposes, variable costing is superior to absorption costing because it prevents managers from increasing income by just increasing production. In the same way, throughput costing may be considered superior to variable costing because not only is management not rewarded for producing more than can be sold, they are penalized for excess production. In this example, income is highest when management produced less than demand and therefore reduced inventory that already existed.

CHAPTER 11 DECISION MAKING AND RELEVANT INFORMATION 11-1 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The five steps in the decision process outlined in Exhibit 11-1 of the text are Identify the problem and uncertainties Obtain information Make predictions about the future Make decisions by choosing among alternatives Implement the decision, evaluate performance, and learn
11-2 Relevant costs are expected future costs that differ among the alternative courses of action being considered. Historical costs are irrelevant because they are past costs and, therefore, cannot differ among alternative future courses of action. 11-3 No. Relevant costs are defined as those expected future costs that differ among alternative courses of action being considered. Thus, future costs that do not differ among the alternatives are irrelevant to deciding which alternative to choose. 11-4 Quantitative factors are outcomes that are measured in numerical terms. Some quantitative factors are financialthat is, they can be easily expressed in monetary terms. Direct materials is an example of a quantitative financial factor. Qualitative factors are outcomes that are difficult to measure accurately in numerical terms. An example is employee morale. 11-5 Two potential problems that should be avoided in relevant cost analysis are (i) Do not assume all variable costs are relevant and all fixed costs are irrelevant. (ii) Do not use unit-cost data directly. It can mislead decision makers because a. it may include irrelevant costs, and b. comparisons of unit costs computed at different output levels lead to erroneous conclusions
11-6 No. Some variable costs may not differ among the alternatives under consideration and, hence, will be irrelevant. Some fixed costs may differ among the alternatives and, hence, will be relevant. 11-7 No. Some of the total unit costs to manufacture a product may be fixed costs, and, hence, will not differ between the make and buy alternatives. These fixed costs are irrelevant to the make-or-buy decision. The key comparison is between purchase costs and the costs that will be saved if the company purchases the component parts from outside plus the additional benefits of using the resources freed up in the next best alternative use (opportunity cost). Furthermore, managers should consider nonfinancial factors such as quality and timely delivery when making outsourcing decisions. 11-8 Opportunity cost is the contribution to income that is forgone (rejected) by not using a limited resource in its next-best alternative use. 11-9 No. When deciding on the quantity of inventory to buy, managers must consider both the purchase cost per unit and the opportunity cost of funds invested in the inventory. For example, the purchase cost per unit may be low when the quantity of inventory purchased is large, but the 11-
benefit of the lower cost may be more than offset by the high opportunity cost of the funds invested in acquiring and holding inventory. 11-10 No. Managers should aim to get the highest contribution margin per unit of the constraining (that is, scarce, limiting, or critical) factor. The constraining factor is what restricts or limits the production or sale of a given product (for example, availability of machine-hours). 11-11 No. For example, if the revenues that will be lost exceed the costs that will be saved, the branch or business segment should not be shut down. Shutting down will only increase the loss. Allocated costs are always irrelevant to the shut-down decision. 11-12 Cost written off as depreciation is irrelevant when it pertains to a past cost such as equipment already purchased. But the purchase cost of new equipment to be acquired in the future that will then be written off as depreciation is often relevant. 11-13 No. Managers tend to favor the alternative that makes their performance look best so they focus on the measures used in the performance-evaluation model. If the performance-evaluation model does not emphasize maximizing operating income or minimizing costs, managers will most likely not choose the alternative that maximizes operating income or minimizes costs. 11-14 The three steps in solving a linear programming problem are (i) Determine the objective function. (ii) Specify the constraints. (iii) Compute the optimal solution. 11-15 The text outlines two methods of determining the optimal solution to an LP problem: (i) Trial-and-error solution approach (ii) Graphical solution approach Most LP applications in practice use standard software packages that rely on the simplex method to compute the optimal solution.

11-16 (20 min.) Disposal of assets. 1. This is an unfortunate situation, yet the $75,000 costs are irrelevant regarding the decision to remachine or scrap. The only relevant factors are the future revenues and future costs. By ignoring the accumulated costs and deciding on the basis of expected future costs, operating income will be maximized (or losses minimized). The difference in favor of remachining is $2,000: (a) (b) Remachine Scrap Future revenues Deduct future costs Operating income Difference in favor of remachining $30,000 25,000 $ 5,000 $2,000 $3,000 $3,000
2. This, too, is an unfortunate situation. But the $100,000 original cost is irrelevant to this decision. The difference in relevant costs in favor of rebuilding is $5,000 as follows: (a) Replace New truck Deduct current disposal price of existing truck Rebuild existing truck $105,000 15,000 $ 90,000 $5,000 (b) Rebuild $85,000 $85,000
Difference in favor of rebuilding
Note, here, that the current disposal price of $15,000 is relevant, but the original cost (or book value, if the truck were not brand new) is irrelevant.

Dalton Computers should reject Peachs offer. The $30 of fixed costs are irrelevant because they will be incurred regardless of this decision. When comparing relevant costs between the choices, Peachs offer price is higher than the cost to continue to produce. 2.

Alternatively, we could calculate the incremental revenue and the incremental costs of the additional 2,500 units as follows: Incremental revenue $100 2,500 Incremental direct manufacturing costs Incremental direct manufacturing costs Incremental batch manufacturing costs Total incremental costs Total incremental operating income from accepting the special order $262,500 2,500 7,500 $300,000 2,500 7,500 $500 25 $250,000 87,500 100,000 12,500 200,000 $ 50,000
Award Plus should accept the one-time-only special order if it has no long-term implications because accepting the order increases Award Plus operating income by $50,000. If, however, accepting the special order would cause the regular customers to be dissatisfied or to demand lower prices, then Award Plus will have to trade off the $50,000 gain from accepting the special order against the operating income it might lose from regular customers.
11-
2. Award Plus has a capacity of 9,000 medals. Therefore, if it accepts the special one-time order of 2,500 medals, it can sell only 6,500 medals instead of the 7,500 medals that it currently sells to existing customers. That is, by accepting the special order, Award Plus must forgo sales of 1,000 medals to its regular customers. Alternatively, Award Plus can reject the special order and continue to sell 7,500 medals to its regular customers. Award Plus operating income from selling 6,500 medals to regular customers and 2,500 medals under one-time special order follow: Revenues (6,500 $150) + (2,500 $100) 1 1 Direct materials (6,500 $35 ) + (2,500 $35 ) 2 2 Direct manufacturing labor (6,500 $40 ) +(2,500 $40 ) 3 Batch manufacturing costs (130 $500) + (25 $500) Fixed manufacturing costs Fixed marketing costs Total costs Operating income

Award Plus makes regular medals in batch sizes of 50. To produce 6,500 medals requires 130 (6,500 50) batches.
Accepting the special order will result in a decrease in operating income of $15,000 ($37,500 $22,500). The special order should, therefore, be rejected. A more direct approach would be to focus on the incremental effectsthe benefits of accepting the special order of 2,500 units versus the costs of selling 1,000 fewer units to regular customers. Increase in operating income from the 2,500-unit special order equals $50,000 (requirement 1). The loss in operating income from selling 1,000 fewer units to regular customers equals: Lost revenue, $150 1,000 Savings in direct materials costs, $35 1,000 Savings in direct manufacturing labor costs, $40 1,000 Savings in batch manufacturing costs, $500 20 Operating income lost $(150,000) 35,000 40,000 10,000 $ (65,000)
Accepting the special order will result in a decrease in operating income of $15,000 ($50,000 $65,000). The special order should, therefore, be rejected. 3. Award Plus should not accept the special order.

11-20 (30 min.) Make versus buy, activity-based costing. 1. The expected manufacturing cost per unit of CMCBs in 2009 is as follows: Total Manufacturing Manufacturing Costs of CMCB Cost per Unit (1) (2) = (1) 10,000 $1,700,000 $170 450,000 45 120,000 12 320,000 800,000 $3,390,000 32 80 $339
Direct materials, $170 10,000 Direct manufacturing labor, $45 10,000 Variable batch manufacturing costs, $1,500 80 Fixed manufacturing costs Avoidable fixed manufacturing costs Unavoidable fixed manufacturing costs Total manufacturing costs
2. The following table identifies the incremental costs in 2009 if Svenson (a) made CMCBs and (b) purchased CMCBs from Minton. Total Incremental Costs Make Buy $3,000,000 $1,700,000 450,000 120,000 320,000 $2,590,000 $3,000,000 $410,000 Per-Unit Incremental Costs Make Buy $300 $170 45 12 32 $259 $300 $41
Incremental Items Cost of purchasing CMCBs from Minton Direct materials Direct manufacturing labor Variable batch manufacturing costs Avoidable fixed manufacturing costs Total incremental costs Difference in favor of making
Note that the opportunity cost of using capacity to make CMCBs is zero since Svenson would keep this capacity idle if it purchases CMCBs from Minton. Svenson should continue to manufacture the CMCBs internally since the incremental costs to manufacture are $259 per unit compared to the $300 per unit that Minton has quoted. Note that the unavoidable fixed manufacturing costs of $800,000 ($80 per unit) will continue to be incurred whether Svenson makes or buys CMCBs. These are not incremental costs under either the make or the buy alternative and hence, are irrelevant.
11-
3. Svenson should continue to make CMCBs. The simplest way to analyze this problem is to recognize that Svenson would prefer to keep any excess capacity idle rather than use it to make CB3s. Why? Because expected incremental future revenues from CB3s, $2,000,000, are less than expected incremental future costs, $2,150,000. If Svenson keeps its capacity idle, we know from requirement 2 that it should make CMCBs rather than buy them. An important point to note is that, because Svenson forgoes no contribution by not being able to make and sell CB3s, the opportunity cost of using its facilities to make CMCBs is zero. It is, therefore, not forgoing any profits by using the capacity to manufacture CMCBs. If it does not manufacture CMCBs, rather than lose money on CB3s, Svenson will keep capacity idle. A longer and more detailed approach is to use the total alternatives or opportunity cost analyses shown in Exhibit 11-7 of the chapter. Choices for Svenson Make CMCBs Buy CMCBs Buy CMCBs and Do Not and Do Not and Make Relevant Items Make CB3s Make CB3s CB3s TOTAL-ALTERNATIVES APPROACH TO MAKE-OR-BUY DECISIONS Total incremental costs of making/buying CMCBs (from requirement 2) Excess of future costs over future revenues from CB3s Total relevant costs

$3,000,000 0 $3,000,000
$3,000,000 150,000 $3,150,000
Svenson will minimize manufacturing costs by making CMCBs. OPPORTUNITY-COST APPROACH TO MAKE-OR-BUY DECISIONS Total incremental costs of making/buying CMCBs (from requirement 2) $2,590,000 $3,000,000 Opportunity cost: profit contribution forgone because capacity will not be used to make CB3s 0* 0* Total relevant costs $2,590,000 $3,000,000
*Opportunity
$3,000,000
0 $3,000,000
cost is 0 because Svenson does not give up anything by not making CB3s. Svenson is best off leaving the capacity idle (rather than manufacturing and selling CB3s).

11-21 (10 min.) Inventory decision, opportunity costs. 1. Unit cost, orders of 20,000 Unit cost, order of 240,000 (0.96 $9.00) $9.00 $8.64
Alternatives under consideration: (a) Buy 240,000 units at start of year. (b) Buy 20,000 units at start of each month. Average investment in inventory: (a) (240,000 $8.64) 2 (b) ( 20,000 $9.00) 2 Difference in average investment
$1, 036,800 90,000 $ 946,800
Opportunity cost of interest forgone from 240,000-unit purchase at start of year = $946,800 0.10 = $94,680 2. No. The $94,680 is an opportunity cost rather than an incremental or outlay cost. No actual transaction records the $94,680 as an entry in the accounting system. 3. The following table presents the two alternatives: Alternative A: Alternative B: Purchase Purchase 240,000 20,000 spark plugs at spark plugs beginning of at beginning year of each month Difference (1) (2) (3) = (1) (2) Annual purchase-order costs $ 200 (1 $200; 12 $200) 2,073,600 Annual purchase (incremental) costs (240,000 $8.64; 240,000 $9) Annual interest income that could be earned if investment in inventory were invested (opportunity cost) 103,680 (10% $1,036,800; 10% $90,000) $2,177,480 Relevant costs $ 2,400 2,160,000 $ (2,200) (86,400)
9,000 $2,171,400
94,680 $ 6,080
Column (3) indicates that purchasing 20,000 spark plugs at the beginning of each month is preferred relative to purchasing 240,000 spark plugs at the beginning of the year because the opportunity cost of holding larger inventory exceeds the lower purchasing and ordering costs. If other incremental benefits of holding lower inventory such as lower insurance, materials handling, storage, obsolescence, and breakage costs were considered, the costs under Alternative A would have been higher, and Alternative B would be preferred even more.

The maximum of six feet of front shelf space will be devoted to Cola because it has the highest contribution margin per unit of the constraining factor. Four feet of front shelf space will be devoted to Lemonade, which has the second highest contribution margin per unit of the constraining factor. No more shelf space can be devoted to Lemonade since each of the remaining two products, Natural Orange Juice and Punch (that have the second lowest and lowest contribution margins per unit of the constraining factor) must each be given at least one foot of front shelf space.

11-23 (10 min.) Selection of most profitable product. Only Model 14 should be produced. The key to this problem is the relationship of manufacturing overhead to each product. Note that it takes twice as long to produce Model 9; machine-hours for Model 9 are twice that for Model 14. Management should choose the product mix that maximizes operating income for a given production capacity (the scarce resource in this situation). In this case, Model 14 will yield a $9.50 contribution to fixed costs per machine hour, and Model 9 will yield $9.00: Model 9 Selling price Variable costs per unit (total cost FMOH) Contribution margin per unit Relative use of machine-hours per unit of product Contribution margin per machine hour $100.00 82.00 $ 18.00 2 $ 9.00 Model 14 $70.00 60.50 $ 9.50 1 $ 9.50
11-24 (20 min.) Which base to close, relevant-cost analysis, opportunity costs. The future outlay operating costs will be $400 million regardless of which base is closed, given the additional $100 million in costs at Everett if Alameda is closed. Further, one of the bases will permanently remain open while the other will be shut down. The only relevant revenue and cost comparisons are a. $500 million from sale of the Alameda base. Note that the historical cost of building the Alameda base ($100 million) is irrelevant. Note also that future increases in the value of the land at the Alameda base is also irrelevant. One of the bases must be kept open, so if it is decided to keep the Alameda base open, the Defense Department will not be able to sell this land at a future date. b. $60 million in savings in fixed income note if the Everett base is closed. Again, the historical cost of building the Everett base ($150 million) is irrelevant. The relevant costs and benefits analysis favors closing the Alameda base despite the objections raised by the California delegation in Congress. The net benefit equals $440 ($500 $60) million.

11-25 (2530 min.) Closing and opening stores. 1. Solution Exhibit 11-25, Column 1, presents the relevant loss in revenues and the relevant savings in costs from closing the Rhode Island store. Lopez is correct that Sanchez Corporations operating income would increase by $7,000 if it closes down the Rhode Island store. Closing down the Rhode Island store results in a loss of revenues of $860,000 but cost savings of $867,000 (from cost of goods sold, rent, labor, utilities, and corporate costs). Note that by closing down the Rhode Island store, Sanchez Corporation will save none of the equipmentrelated costs because this is a past cost. Also note that the relevant corporate overhead costs are the actual corporate overhead costs $44,000 that Sanchez expects to save by closing the Rhode Island store. The corporate overhead of $40,000 allocated to the Rhode Island store is irrelevant to the analysis. 2. Solution Exhibit 11-25, Column 2, presents the relevant revenues and relevant costs of opening another store like the Rhode Island store. Lopez is correct that opening such a store would increase Sanchez Corporations operating income by $11,000. Incremental revenues of $860,000 exceed the incremental costs of $849,000 (from higher cost of goods sold, rent, labor, utilities, and some additional corporate costs). Note that the cost of equipment written off as depreciation is relevant because it is an expected future cost that Sanchez will incur only if it opens the new store. Also note that the relevant corporate overhead costs are the $4,000 of actual corporate overhead costs that Sanchez expects to incur as a result of opening the new store. Sanchez may, in fact, allocate more than $4,000 of corporate overhead to the new store but this allocation is irrelevant to the analysis. The key reason that Sanchezs operating income increases either if it closes down the Rhode Island store or if it opens another store like it is the behavior of corporate overhead costs. By closing down the Rhode Island store, Sanchez can significantly reduce corporate overhead costs presumably by reducing the corporate staff that oversees the Rhode Island operation. On the other hand, adding another store like Rhode Island does not increase actual corporate costs by much, presumably because the existing corporate staff will be able to oversee the new store as well.

11-26 (20 min.) Choosing customers. If Broadway accepts the additional business from Kelly, it would take an additional 500 machine-hours. If Broadway accepts all of Kellys and Taylors business for February, it would require 2,500 machine-hours (1,500 hours for Taylor and 1,000 hours for Kelly). Broadway has only 2,000 hours of machine capacity. It must, therefore, choose how much of the Taylor or Kelly business to accept. To maximize operating income, Broadway should maximize contribution margin per unit of the constrained resource. (Fixed costs will remain unchanged at $100,000 regardless of the business Broadway chooses to accept in February, and is, therefore, irrelevant.) The contribution margin per unit of the constrained resource for each customer in January is: Taylor Corporation $78,000 = $52 1,500 Kelly Corporation $32,000 = $64 500
Contribution margin per machine-hour
Since the $80,000 of additional Kelly business in February is identical to jobs done in January, it will also have a contribution margin of $64 per machine-hour, which is greater than the contribution margin of $52 per machine-hour from Taylor. To maximize operating income, Broadway should first allocate all the capacity needed to take the Kelly Corporation business (1,000 machine-hours) and then allocate the remaining 1,000 (2,000 1,000) machine-hours to Taylor.

1c. The $20,000 purchase cost of the old equipment, the revenues, and the other operating costs are irrelevant because their amounts are common to both alternatives. 2. The net difference would be unaffected. Any number may be substituted for the original $20,000 figure without changing the final answer. Of course, the net cash outflows under both alternatives would be high. The Auto Wash manager really blundered. However, keeping the old equipment will increase the cost of the blunder to the cumulative tune of $8,000 over the next four years. 3. Book value is irrelevant in decisions about the replacement of equipment, because it is a past (historical) cost. All past costs are down the drain. Nothing can change what has already been spent or what has already happened. The $20,000 has been spent. How it is subsequently accounted for is irrelevant. The analysis in requirement (1) clearly shows that we may completely ignore the $20,000 and still have a correct analysis. The only relevant items are those expected future items that will differ among alternatives. Despite the economic analysis shown here, many managers would keep the old machine rather than replace it. Why? Because, in many organizations, the income statements of part (2) would be a principal means of evaluating performance. Note that the first-year operating income would be higher under the keep alternative. The conventional accrual accounting model might motivate managers toward maximizing their first-year reported operating income at the expense of long-run cumulative betterment for the organization as a whole. This criticism is often made of the accrual accounting model. That is, the action favored by the correct or best economic decision model may not be taken because the performance-evaluation model is either inconsistent with the decision model or because the focus is on only the short-run part of the performance-evaluation model. There is yet another potential conflict between the decision model and the performance evaluation model. Replacing the machine so soon after it is purchased may reflect badly on the managers capabilities and performance. Why didnt the manager search and find the new machine before buying the old machine? Replacing the old machine one day later at a loss may make the manager appear incompetent to his or her superiors. If the managers bosses have no knowledge of the better machine, the manager may prefer to keep the existing machine rather than alert his or her bosses about the better machine.

Equipment upgrade versus replacement.
1. Based on the analysis in the table below, TechMech will be better off by $180,000 over three years if it replaces the current equipment.
Comparing Relevant Costs of Upgrade and Replace Alternatives Cash operating costs $140; $80 per desk 6,000 desks per yr. 3 yrs. Current disposal price One time capital costs, written off periodically as depreciation Total relevant costs Over 3 years Upgrade Replace (1) (2) $2,520,000 $1,440,000 (600,000) 4,200,000 $5,040,000 Difference in favor of Replace (3) = (1) (2) $1,080,000 600,000 (1,500,000) $ 180,000
2,700,000 $5,220,000
Note that the book value of the current machine ($900,000) would either be written off as depreciation over three years under the upgrade option, or, all at once in the current year under the replace option. Its net effect would be the same in both alternatives: to increase costs by $900,000 over three years, hence it is irrelevant in this analysis. 2. Suppose the capital expenditure to replace the equipment is $X. From requirement 1, column (2), substituting for the one-time capital cost of replacement, the relevant cost of replacing is $1,440,000 $600,000 + $X. From column (1), the relevant cost of upgrading is $5,220,000. We want to find X such that $1,440,000 $600,000 + $X&lt;$5,220,000 (i.e., TechMech will favor replacing) Solving the above inequality gives us X&lt;$5,220,000 $840,000 = $4,380,000. TechMech would prefer to replace, rather than upgrade, if the replacement cost of the new equipment does not exceed $4,380,000. Note that this result can also be obtained by taking the original replacement cost of $4,200,000 and adding to it the $180,000 difference in favor of replacement calculated in requirement 1. 3. Suppose the units produced and sold over 3 years equal y. Using data from requirement 1, column (1), the relevant cost of upgrade would be $140y + $2,700,000, and from column (2), the relevant cost of replacing the equipment would be $80y $600,000 + $4,200,000. TechMech would want to upgrade if $140y + $2,700,000&lt;$80y $600,000 + $4,200,000 $60y&lt;$900,000 y&lt;$900,000 $60 = 15,000 units or upgrade when y&lt;15,000 units (or 5,000 per year for 3 years) and replace when y&gt;15,000 units over 3 years. When production and sales volume is low (less than 5,000 per year), the higher operating costs under the upgrade option are more than offset by the savings in capital costs from upgrading. When production and sales volume is high, the higher capital costs of replacement are more than offset by the savings in operating costs in the replace option.

4. Operating income for the first year under the upgrade and replace alternatives are shown below: Year 1 Upgrade Replace (1) (2) Revenues (6,000 $500) $3,000,000 $3,000,000 Cash operating costs $140; $80 per desk 6,000 desks per year 840,000 480,000 a + $2,700,000) 3; $4,200,000 3 Depreciation ($900,000 1,200,000 1,400,000 Loss on disposal of old equipment (0; $900,000 $600,000) 0 300,000 Total costs 2,040,000 2,180,000 Operating Income $ 960,000 $ 820,000

First-year operating income is higher by $140,000 under the upgrade alternative, and Dan Doria, with his one-year horizon and operating income-based bonus, will choose the upgrade alternative, even though, as seen in requirement 1, the replace alternative is better in the long run for TechMech. This exercise illustrates the possible conflict between the decision model and the performance evaluation model.

$250,000 (160,000) $ 90,000

Louisville should accept Ripkins special order because it increases operating income by $90,000. Since no variable selling costs will be incurred on this order, this cost is irrelevant. Similarly, fixed costs are irrelevant because they will be incurred regardless of the decision. 2a. Revenues from special order ($25 10,000 bats) Variable manufacturing costs ($16 10,000 bats) Contribution margin foregone ([$32$181] 10,000 bats) Decrease in operating income if Ripkin order accepted

Based strictly on financial considerations, Louisville should reject Ripkins special order because it results in a $50,000 reduction in operating income. 2b. Louisville will be indifferent between the special order and continuing to sell to regular customers if the special order price is $30. At this price, Louisville recoups the variable manufacturing costs of $160,000 and the contribution margin given up from regular customers of $140,000 ([$160,000 + $140,000] 10,000 units = $30). Looked at a different way, Louisville expects the full price of $32 less the $2 saved on variable selling costs. 2c. Louisville may be willing to accept a loss on this special order if the possibility of future long-term sales seem likely. However, Louisville should also consider the effect on customer relationships by refusing sales from existing customers. Also, Louisville cannot afford to adopt the special order price long-term or with other customers who may ask for price concessions.

$
$89,379.20
On the basis of quantitative factors alone, Air Frisco should decrease its fare to $480 because reducing the fare gives Air Frisco a higher contribution margin from passengers ($89,379.20 versus $88,000). 3. In evaluating whether Air Frisco should charter its plane to Travel International, we compare the charter alternative to the solution in requirement 2 because requirement 2 is preferred to requirement 1. Under requirement 2, contribution from passengers Deduct fuel costs Total contribution per flight $89,379.20 14,000.00 $75,379.20
Air Frisco gets $74,500 per flight from chartering the plane to Travel International. On the basis of quantitative financial factors, Air Frisco is better off not chartering the plane and, instead, lowering its own fares. Other qualitative factors that Air Frisco should consider in coming to a decision are a. The lower risk from chartering its plane relative to the uncertainties regarding the number of passengers it might get on its scheduled flights. b. The stability of the relationship between Air Frisco and Travel International. If this is not a long-term arrangement, Air Frisco may lose current market share and not benefit from sustained charter revenues.

Relevant revenues Relevant costs: Manuals, diskettes, compact discs Total relevant costs Relevant operating income Reasons for other cost items being irrelevant are
Easyspread 1.0 Manuals, diskettesalready incurred Development costsalready incurred Marketing and administrativefixed costs of period Easyspread 2.0 Development costsalready incurred Marketing and administrationfixed costs of period
Note that total marketing and administration costs will not change whether Easyspread 2.0 is introduced on July 1, 2009, or on October 1, 2009. 2. Other factors to be considered: a. Customer satisfaction. If 2.0 is significantly better than 1.0 for its customers, a customer driven organization would immediately introduce it unless other factors offset this bias towards do what is best for the customer. b. Quality level of Easyspread 2.0. It is critical for new software products to be fully debugged. Easyspread 2.0 must be error-free. Consider an immediate release only if 2.0 passes all quality tests and can be fully supported by the salesforce. c. Importance of being perceived to be a market leader. Being first in the market with a new product can give Basil Software a first-mover advantage, e.g., capturing an initial large share of the market that, in itself, causes future potential customers to lean towards purchasing Easyspread 2.0. Moreover, by introducing 2.0 earlier, Basil can get quick feedback from users about ways to further refine the software while its competitors are still working on their own first versions. Moreover, by locking in early customers, Basil may increase the likelihood of these customers also buying future upgrades of Easyspread 2.0. d. Morale of developers. These are key people at Basil Software. Delaying introduction of a new product can hurt their morale, especially if a competitor then preempts Basil from being viewed as a market leader.

11-32 (20 min.) Opportunity costs. 1. The opportunity cost to Wolverine of producing the 2,000 units of Orangebo is the contribution margin lost on the 2,000 units of Rosebo that would have to be forgone, as computed below: Selling price Variable costs per unit: Direct materials Direct manufacturing labor Variable manufacturing overhead Variable marketing costs Contribution margin per unit Contribution margin for 2,000 units $20 $2 3 2 4
11 $9 $ 18,000
The opportunity cost is $18,000. Opportunity cost is the maximum contribution to operating income that is forgone (rejected) by not using a lim ited resource in its next-best alternative use. 2. Contribution margin from manufacturing 2,000 units of Orangebo and purchasing 2,000 units of Rosebo from Buckeye is $16,000, as follows: Manufacture Orangebo Selling price Variable costs per unit: Purchase costs Direct materials Direct manufacturing labor Variable manufacturing costs Variable marketing overhead Variable costs per unit Contribution margin per unit Contribution margin from selling 2,000 units of Orangebo and 2,000 units of Rosebo $15 2 3 2 2 9 $6 $12,000 Purchase Rosebo $20 14
Total
4 18 $2 $4,000 $16,000
As calculated in requirement 1, Wolverines contribution margin from continuing to manufacture 2,000 units of Rosebo is $18,000. Accepting the Miami Company and Buckeye offer will cost Wolverine $2,000 ($16,000 $18,000). Hence, Wolverine should refuse the Miami Company and Buckeye Corporations offers. 3. The minimum price would be $9, the sum of the incremental costs as computed in requirement 2. This follows because, if Wolverine has surplus capacity, the opportunity cost = $0. For the short-run decision of whether to accept Orangebos offer, fixed costs of Wolverine are irrelevant. Only the incremental costs need to be covered for it to be worthwhile for Wolverine to accept the Orangebo offer.

11-33 (3040 min.) Product mix, relevant costs. 1. Selling price Variable manufacturing cost per unit Variable marketing cost per unit Total variable costs per unit Contribution margin per unit Contribution margin per hour of the constrained resource (the regular machine) Total contribution margin from selling only R3 or only HP6 R3: $25 50,000; HP6: $30 50,000 Less Lease costs of high-precision machine to produce and sell HP6 Net relevant benefit R3 $100 60 15 75 $ 25 $25 = $25 1 HP6 $150 100 35 135 $ 15 $15 = $30 0.5
$1,250,000 $1,250,000
$1,500,000 300,000 $1,200,000
Even though HP6 has the higher contribution margin per unit of the constrained resource, the fact that Pendleton must incur additional costs of $300,000 to achieve this higher contribution margin means that Pendleton is better off using its entire 50,000-hour capacity on the regular machine to produce and sell 50,000 units (50,000 hours 1 hour per unit) of R3. The additional contribution from selling HP6 rather than R3 is $250,000 ($1,500,000 $1,250,000), which is not enough to cover the additional costs of leasing the high-precision machine. Note that, because all other overhead costs are fixed and cannot be changed, they are irrelevant for the decision. 2. If capacity of the regular machines is increased by 15,000 machine-hours to 65,000 machine-hours (50,000 originally + 15,000 new), the net relevant benefit from producing R3 and HP6 is as follows: R3 HP6 Total contribution margin from selling only R3 or only HP6 R3: $25 65,000; HP6: $30 65,000 Less Lease costs of high-precision machine that would be incurred if HP6 is produced and sold Less Cost of increasing capacity by 15,000 hours on regular machine Net relevant benefit
$1,625,000
$1,950,000 300,000

Investing in the additional capacity increases Pendletons operating income by $250,000 ($1,500,000 calculated in requirement 2 minus $1,250,000 calculated in requirement 1), so Pendleton should add 15,000 hours to the regular machine. With the extra capacity available to it, Pendleton should use its entire capacity to produce HP6. Using all 65,000 hours of capacity to produce HP6 rather than to produce R3 generates additional contribution margin of $325,000 ($1,950,000 $1,625,000) which is more than the additional cost of $300,000 to lease the highprecision machine. Pendleton should therefore produce and sell 130,000 units of HP6 (65,000 hours 0.5 hours per unit of HP6) and zero units of R3. 3. R3 Selling price Variable manufacturing costs per unit Variable marketing costs per unit Total variable costs per unit Contribution margin per unit Contribution margin per hour of the constrained resource (the regular machine) $100 60 15 75 $ 25 $25 = $25 1 HP6 $150 100 35 135 $ 15 $15 = $30 0.5 S3 $120 70 15 85 $ 35 $35 = $35 1
The first step is to compare the operating profits that Pendleton could earn if it accepted the Carter Corporation offer for 20,000 units with the operating profits Pendleton is currently earning. S3 has the highest contribution margin per hour on the regular machine and requires no additional investment such as leasing a high-precision machine. To produce the 20,000 units of S3 requested by Carter Corporation, Pendleton would require 20,000 hours on the regular machine resulting in contribution margin of $35 20,000 = $700,000. Pendleton now has 45,000 hours available on the regular machine to produce R3 or HP6. R3 Total contribution margin from selling only R3 or only HP6 R3: $25 45,000; HP6: $30 45,000 Less Lease costs of high-precision machine to produce and sell HP 6 Net relevant benefit HP6
$1,125,000 $1,125,000
$1,350,000 300,000 $1,050,000
Pendleton should use all the 45,000 hours of available capacity to produce 45,000 units of R3. Thus, the product mix that maximizes operating income is 20,000 units of S3, 45,000 units of R3, and zero units of HP6. This optimal mix results in a contribution margin of $1,825,000 ($700,000 from S3 and $1,125,000 from R3). Relative to requirement 2, operating income increases by $325,000 ($1,825,000 minus $1,500,000 calculated in requirement 2). Hence, Pendleton should accept the Carter Corporation business and supply 20,000 units of S3.

11-34 (3540 min.) Dropping a product line, selling more units. 1. The incremental revenue losses and incremental savings in cost by discontinuing the Tables product line follows: Difference: Incremental (Loss in Revenues) and Savings in Costs from Dropping Tables Line Revenues Direct materials and direct manufacturing labor Depreciation on equipment Marketing and distribution General administration Corporate office costs Total costs Operating income (loss) $(500,000) 300,000 0 70,000 0 0 370,000 $(130,000)
Dropping the Tables product line results in revenue losses of $500,000 and cost savings of $370,000. Hence, Grossman Corporations operating income will be $130,000 lower if it drops the Tables line. Note that, by dropping the Tables product line, Home Furnishings will save none of the depreciation on equipment, general administration costs, and corporate office costs, but it will save variable manufacturing costs and all marketing and distribution costs on the Tables product line. 2. Grossmans will generate incremental operating income of $128,000 from selling 4,000 additional tables and, hence, should try to increase table sales. The calculations follow: Incremental Revenues (Costs) and Operating Income $500,000 (300,000) (42,000)* (30,000) 0** 0** $128,000
Revenues Direct materials and direct manufacturing labor Cost of equipment written off as depreciation Marketing and distribution costs General administration costs Corporate office costs Operating income
*Note
that the additional costs of equipment are relevant future costs for the selling more tables decision because they represent incremental future costs that differ between the alternatives of selling and not selling additional tables. Current marketing and distribution costs which varies with number of shipments = $70,000 $40,000 = $30,000. As the sales of tables double, the number of shipments will double, resulting in incremental marketing and distribution costs of (2 $30,000) $30,000 = $30,000. **General administration and corporate office costs will be unaffected if Grossman decides to sell more tables. Hence, these costs are irrelevant for the decision.

3.Solution Exhibit 11-34, Column 1, presents the relevant loss of revenues and the relevant savings in costs from closing the Northern Division. As the calculations show, Grossmans operating income would decrease by $140,000 if it shut down the Northern Division (loss in revenues of $1,500,000 versus savings in costs of $1,360,000). Grossman will save variable manufacturing costs, marketing and distribution costs, and division general administration costs by closing the Northern Division but equipment-related depreciation and corporate office allocations are irrelevant to the decision. Equipment-related costs are irrelevant because they are past costs (and the equipment has zero disposal price). Corporate office costs are irrelevant because Grossman will not save any actual corporate office costs by closing the Northern Division. The corporate office costs that used to be allocated to the Northern Division will be allocated to other divisions. 4. Solution Exhibit 11-34, Column 2, presents the relevant revenues and relevant costs of opening the Southern Division (a division whose revenues and costs are expected to be identical to the revenues and costs of the Northern Division). Grossman should open the Southern Division because it would increase operating income by $40,000 (increase in relevant revenues of $1,500,000 and increase in relevant costs of $1,460,000). The relevant costs include direct materials, direct manufacturing labor, marketing and distribution, equipment, and division general administration costs but not corporate office costs. Note, in particular, that the cost of equipment written off as depreciation is relevant because it is an expected future cost that Grossman will incur only if it opens the Southern Division. Corporate office costs are irrelevant because actual corporate office costs will not change if Grossman opens the Southern Division. The current corporate staff will be able to oversee the Southern Divisions operations. Grossman will allocate some corporate office costs to the Southern Division but this allocation represents corporate office costs that are already currently being allocated to some other division. Because actual total corporate office costs do not change, they are irrelevant to the division.

Assuming cost minimization is the objective, then If production is expected to be less than 140,000 units, it is preferable to buy units from Tidnish. If production is expected to exceed 140,000 units, it is preferable to manufacture internally (make) the units. If production is expected to be 140,000 units, Oxford should be indifferent between buying units from Tidnish and manufacturing (making) the units internally.

11-36 (30 min.) Make versus buy, activity-based costing, opportunity costs. 1. Relevant costs under buy alternative: Purchases, 10,000 $8.20 Relevant costs under make alternative: Direct materials Direct manufacturing labor Variable manufacturing overhead Inspection, setup, materials handling Machine rent Total relevant costs under make alternative $82,000
$40,000 20,000 15,000 2,000 3,000 $80,000
The allocated fixed plant administration, taxes, and insurance will not change if Ace makes or buys the chains. Hence, these costs are irrelevant to the make-or-buy decision. The analysis indicates that Ace should make and not buy the chains from the outside supplier. 2. Relevant costs under the make alternative: Relevant costs (as computed in requirement 1) Relevant costs under the buy alternative: Costs of purchases (10,000 $8.20) Additional fixed costs Additional contribution margin from using the space where the chains were made to upgrade the bicycles by adding mud flaps and reflector bars, 10,000 ($20 $18) Total relevant costs under the buy alternative $80,000
$82,000 16,000
(20,000) $78,000
Ace should now buy the chains from an outside vendor and use its own capacity to upgrade its own bicycles. 3. In this requirement, the decision on mud flaps and reflectors is irrelevant to the analysis.

If this order were not landed, fixed manufacturing overhead would be underallocated by $2,500, $0.50 per unit 5,000 units. Therefore, taking the order increases operating income by $1,000 plus $2,500, or $3,500.

None of these. The correct answer is $3.55. This part always gives students trouble. The short-cut solution below is followed by a longer solution that is helpful to students.

solution is obtained by filling in the above schedule with all the known figures and working from the bottom up and from the top down to the unknown purchase figure. Maximum variable costs that can be incurred, $1,140,000 $288,000 = maximum purchase costs, or $852,000. Divide $852,000 by 240,000 units, which yields a maximum purchase price of $3.55.

2. Division A Fixed costs of goods sold ($450,000 $405,000; $390,000 $370,500) Fixed S,G&amp;A ($100,000 $60,000; $120,000 $96,000) Total fixed costs Fixed costs savings if shutdown ($85,000 0.60; $43,500 0.60) $45,000 40,000 $85,000 $51,000 Division D $19,500 24,000 $43,500 $26,100
Division As contribution margin of $65,000 more than covers its avoidable fixed costs of $51,000. The difference of $14,000 helps cover the companys unavoidable fixed costs. Since $51,000 of Division As fixed costs are avoidable, the remaining $34,000 is unavoidable and will be incurred regardless of whether Division A continues to operate. Division As $20,000 loss is the rest of the unavoidable fixed costs ($34,000 $14,000). If Division A is closed, the remaining divisions will need to generate sufficient profits to cover the entire $34,000 unavoidable fixed cost. Consequently, Division A should not be closed since it helps defray $14,000 of this cost. In contrast, Division D earns a negative contribution margin, which means its revenues are less than its variable costs. Division D also generates $26,100 of avoidable fixed costs. Based strictly on financial considerations, Division D should be closed because the company will save $42,600 ($26,100 + $16,500). An alternative set of calculations is as follows: Division A Total variable costs Avoidable fixed costs if shutdown Total cost savings if shutdown Loss of revenues if shutdown Cost savings minus loss of revenues $465,000 51,000 516,000 530,000 $ (14,000) Division D $466,500 26,100 492,600 450,000 $ 42,600
Division A should not be shut down because loss of revenues if Division A is shut down exceeds cost savings. Division D should be shut down because cost savings from shutting down Division D exceeds loss of revenues. 3. Before deciding to close Division D, management should consider the role that the Divisions product line plays relative to other product lines. For instance, if the product manufactured by Division D attracts customers to the company, then dropping Division D may have a detrimental effect on the revenues of the remaining divisions. Management may also want to consider the impact on the morale of the remaining employees if Division D is closed. Talented employees may become fearful of losing their jobs and seek employment elsewhere.

The remaining 1,800 pounds (5,000 3,200) should be devoted to C657 because it has the highest contribution margin per pound of direct material. Since each unit of C657 requires 3 pounds of Bistide, the remaining 1,800 pounds can be used to produce another 600 units of C657. The following combination yields the highest contribution margin given the 5,000 pounds constraint on availability of Bistide. A110: 200 units B382: 200 units C657: 800 units (200 minimum + 600 extra)

2. The demand for Westfords products exceeds the materials available. Assuming that fixed costs are covered by the original product mix, Westford should be willing to pay upto an additional $7 per pound (the contribution margin per pound of C657) for another 1,000 pounds of Bistide. That is, Westford should be willing to pay $3 + $7 = $10 per pound of Bistide1. This cost assumes that sufficient demand exists to sell another 333 units (1000 pounds 3 pounds per unit) of C657. If not, then the maximum price falls to an additional $4 per pound (the contribution margin per pound of A110) so that Westford can produce up to 125 more units of A110 (1,000 pounds 8 pounds per unit). In this case, Westford would be willing to pay $3 + $4 = $7 per pound. If there is insufficient demand to sell another 125 units of A110, then the maximum price Westford would be willing to pay falls to an additional $2.80 per pound (the contribution margin per pound of B382). Westford would be willing to pay $2.80 + $3 = $5.80 per pound of Bistide.

We next calculate the optimal production mix using the trial-and-error method. The corner point where the Mixing Dept. and Baking Dept. constraints intersect can be calculated as (18, 8) by solving: 30D + 15B = 660 (1) Mixing Dept. constraint 10D + 15B = 300 (2) Baking Dept. constraint Subtracting (2) from (1), we have 20D = 360 or D = 18 Substituting in (2) (10 18) + 15B = 300 that is, 15B = 300 180 = 120 or B=8 The corner point where the Filling and Baking Department constraints intersect can be calculated as (3,18) by substituting B = 18 (Filling Department constraint) into the Baking Department constraint: 10 D + (15 18) = 300 10 D = 300 270 = 30 D= 3 The feasible region, defined by 5 corner points, is shaded in Solution Exhibit 11-40.

On the basis of Porters estimates, Solution Exhibit 11-41A suggests that in 2009, the cost to purchase 32,000 units of MTR-2000 will be $703,600, which is greater than the estimated $687,000 costs to manufacture MTR-2000 in-house.

Based solely on the financial results shown in Solution Exhibit 11-41B, Harts estimates suggest that the 32,000 units of MTR-2000 should be purchased from Marley. The total cost from Marley would be $701,600, or $13,240 less than if the units were made by Paibec. 3. At least four other factors that Paibec Corporation should consider before agreeing to purchase MTR-2000 from Marley Company include the following: In future years, Paibec will not incur the rental and lease contract termination costs on its annual contacts that it will incur in 2009. This will make the purchase option even more attractive, in a financial sense. But then, Marleys own longevity, its ability to provide the required units of MTR-2000, and its demanded price should be considered, since terminating the contracts may make the make-versus-buy decision a long-term one for Paibec. The quality of the Marley component should be equal to, or better than, the quality of the internally made component. Otherwise, the quality of the final product might be compromised and Paibecs reputation affected. Marleys reliability as an on-time supplier is important, since late deliveries could hamper Paibecs production schedule and delivery dates for the final product. Layoffs may result if the component is outsourced to Marley. This could impact Paibecs other employees and cause labor problems or affect the companys position in the community. In addition, there may be labor termination costs, which have not been factored into the analysis.
4. Referring to Standards of Ethical Conduct for Management Accountants, in Exhibit 1-7, Lynn Hart would consider the request of John Porter to be unethical for the following reasons.
Competence Prepare complete and clear reports and recommendations after appropriate analysis of relevant and reliable information. Adjusting cost numbers violates the competence standard. Integrity Refrain from either actively or passively subverting the attainment of the organizations legitimate and ethical objectives. Paibec has a legitimate objective of trying to obtain the component at the lowest cost possible, regardless of whether it is manufactured internally or outsourced to Marley.
 Communicate unfavorable as well as favorable information and professional judgments or opinions. Hart needs to communicate the proper and accurate results of the analysis, regardless of whether or not it favors internal production. Refrain from engaging in or supporting any activity that would discredit the profession. Falsifying the analysis would discredit Hart and the profession.
11-
Credibility Communicate information fairly and objectively. Hart needs to perform an objective makeversus-buy analysis and communicate the results fairly.
 Disclose fully all relevant information that could reasonably be expected to influence an intended users understanding of the reports, comments, and recommendations presented. Hart needs to fully disclose the analysis and the expected cost increases.
Confidentiality Not affected by this decision.
Hart should indicate to Porter that the costs she has derived under the make alternative are correct. If Porter still insists on making the changes to lower the costs of making MTR-2000 internally, Hart should raise the matter with Porters superior, after informing Porter of her plans. If, after taking all these steps, there is a continued pressure to understate the costs, Hart should consider resigning from the company, rather than engage in unethical conduct.

3. Total machine hours needed to satisfy demand exceed the machine hours available (55,650 needed&gt;50,000 available). Consequently Marion Taylor needs to evaluate these products based on the contribution margin per machine hour. Nealy $1,500 3 MH $ 500 Tersa $995 2.5 MH $398 Pelta $420 1 MH $420
Unit contribution margin Machine-hours (MH) per unit Unit contribution margin per MH
Based on this analysis, Marion Taylor should produce to meet the demand for products with the highest unit contribution margin per machine hour, first Nealy, then Pelta, and finally Tersa. The optimal product mix will be as follows: Nealy Pelta Tersa Total 1,800 units = 5,400 MH 39,000 units = 39,000 MH 2,240 (5,600 MH 2.5 MH/unit) units = 5,600 MH (50,000 5,400 39,000) 50,000 MH
4. The optimal product mix in Part 3 satisfies the demand for Nealy and Pelta and leaves only 2,260 units (4,500 2,240) of Tersa unfilled. These remaining units of Tersa require 5,650 machine hours (2,260 units 2.5 MH per unit). The maximum price Marion Taylor is willing to pay for extra machine hours is $398, which is the unit contribution per machine hour for additional units of Tersa. That is, total cost per machine-hour for these units will be $398 + $200 (variable cost per machine-hour) = $598 per machine-hour.

CHAPTER 12 PRICING DECISIONS AND COST MANAGEMENT 12-1 The three major influences on pricing decisions are 1. Customers 2. Competitors 3. Costs 12-2 Not necessarily. For a one-time-only special order, the relevant costs are only those costs that will change as a result of accepting the order. In this case, full product costs will rarely be relevant. It is more likely that full product costs will be relevant costs for long-run pricing decisions. 12-3 1. 2. Two examples of pricing decisions with a short-run focus: Pricing for a one-time-only special order with no long-term implications. Adjusting product mix and volume in a competitive market.
12-4 Activity-based costing helps managers in pricing decisions in two ways. 1. It gives managers more accurate product-cost information for making pricing decisions. 2. It helps managers to manage costs during value engineering by identifying the cost impact of eliminating, reducing, or changing various activities. 12-5 Two alternative starting points for long-run pricing decisions are 1. Market-based pricing, an important form of which is target pricing. The market-based approach asks, Given what our customers want and how our competitors will react to what we do, what price should we charge? 2. Cost-based pricing which asks, What does it cost us to make this product and, hence, what price should we charge that will recoup our costs and achieve a target return on investment? 12-6 A target cost per unit is the estimated long-run cost per unit of a product (or service) that, when sold at the target price, enables the company to achieve the targeted operating income per unit. 12-7 Value engineering is a systematic evaluation of all aspects of the value-chain business functions, with the objective of reducing costs while satisfying customer needs. Value engineering via improvement in product and process designs is a principal technique that companies use to achieve target costs per unit. 12-8 A value-added cost is a cost that customers perceive as adding value, or utility, to a product or service. Examples are costs of materials, direct labor, tools, and machinery. A nonvalue-added cost is a cost that customers do not perceive as adding value, or utility, to a product or service. Examples of nonvalue-added costs are costs of rework, scrap, expediting, and breakdown maintenance. 12-9 No. It is important to distinguish between when costs are locked in and when costs are incurred, because it is difficult to alter or reduce costs that have already been locked in.

12-10 Cost-plus pricing is a pricing approach in which managers add a markup to cost in order to determine price. 12-11 Cost-plus pricing methods vary depending on the bases used to calculate prices. Examples are (a) variable manufacturing costs; (b) manufacturing function costs; (c) variable product costs; and (d) full product costs. 12-12 Two examples where the difference in the costs of two products or services is much smaller than the differences in their prices follow: 1. The difference in prices charged for a telephone call, hotel room, or car rental during busy versus slack periods is often much greater than the difference in costs to provide these services. 2. The difference in costs for an airplane seat sold to a passenger traveling on business or a passenger traveling for pleasure is roughly the same. However, airline companies price discriminate. They routinely charge business travelersthose who are likely to start and complete their travel during the same week excluding the weekenda much higher price than pleasure travelers who generally stay at their destinations over at least one weekend. 12-13 Life-cycle budgeting is an estimate of the revenues and costs attributable to each product from its initial R&amp;D to its final customer servicing and support. 12-14 1. 2. in 3. Three benefits of using a product life-cycle reporting format are: The full set of revenues and costs associated with each product becomes more visible. Differences among products in the percentage of total costs committed at early stages the life cycle are highlighted. Interrelationships among business function cost categories are highlighted.
12-15 Predatory pricing occurs when a business deliberately prices below its costs in an effort to drive competitors out of the market and restrict supply, and then raises prices rather than enlarge demand. Under U.S. laws, dumping occurs when a non-U.S. company sells a product in the United States at a price below the market value in the country where it is produced, and this lower price materially injures or threatens to materially injure an industry in the United States. Collusive pricing occurs when companies in an industry conspire in their pricing and production decisions to achieve a price above the competitive price and so restrain trade.

Relevant-cost approach to pricing decisions, special order. $4,000 $1,600 900 700 200 3,400 $ 600
Relevant revenues, $4.00 1,000 Relevant costs Direct materials, $1.60 1,000 Direct manufacturing labor, $0.90 1,000 Variable manufacturing overhead, $0.70 1,000 Variable selling costs, 0.05 $4,000 Total relevant costs Increase in operating income
This calculation assumes that: a. The monthly fixed manufacturing overhead of $150,000 and $65,000 of monthly fixed marketing costs will be unchanged by acceptance of the 1,000 unit order. b. The price charged and the volumes sold to other customers are not affected by the special order. Chapter 12 uses the phrase one-time-only special order to describe this special case. 2. The presidents reasoning is defective on at least two counts: a. The inclusion of irrelevant costsassuming the monthly fixed manufacturing overhead of $150,000 will be unchanged; it is irrelevant to the decision. b. The exclusion of relevant costsvariable selling costs (5% of the selling price) are excluded. Key issues are: a. Will the existing customer base demand price reductions? If this 1,000-tape order is not independent of other sales, cutting the price from $5.00 to $4.00 can have a large negative effect on total revenues. b. Is the 1,000-tape order a one-time-only order, or is there the possibility of sales in subsequent months? The fact that the customer is not in Dill Companys normal marketing channels does not necessarily mean it is a one-time-only order. Indeed, the sale could well open a new marketing channel. Dill Company should be reluctant to consider only short-run variable costs for pricing long-run business.

12-17 (2030 min.) Relevant-cost approach to short-run pricing decisions. 1. Analysis of special order: Sales, 3,000 units $75 Variable costs: Direct materials, 3,000 units $35 Direct manufacturing labor, 3,000 units $10 Variable manufacturing overhead, 3,000 units $6 Other variable costs, 3,000 units $5 Sales commission Total variable costs Contribution margin
$225,000 $105,000 30,000 18,000 15,000 8,000 176,000 $ 49,000
Note that the variable costs, except for commissions, are affected by production volume, not sales dollars. If the special order is accepted, operating income would be $1,000,000 + $49,000 = $1,049,000. 2. Whether McMahons decision to quote full price is correct depends on many factors. He is incorrect if the capacity would otherwise be idle and if his objective is to increase operating income in the short run. If the offer is rejected, San Carlos, in effect, is willing to invest $49,000 in immediate gains forgone (an opportunity cost) to preserve the long-run selling-price structure. McMahon is correct if he thinks future competition or future price concessions to customers will hurt San Carloss operating income by more than $49,000. There is also the possibility that Abrams could become a long-term customer. In this case, is a price that covers only short-run variable costs adequate? Would Holtz be willing to accept a $8,000 sales commission (as distinguished from her regular $33,750 = 15% $225,000) for every Abrams order of this size if Abrams becomes a long-term customer?

12-18 (15-20 min.) Short-run pricing, capacity constraints. 1. Per kilogram of hard cheese: Milk (10 liters $1.50 per liter) Direct manufacturing labor Variable manufacturing overhead Fixed manufacturing cost allocated Total manufacturing cost $15 5 3 6 $29
If Vermont Hills can get all the Holstein milk it needs, and has sufficient production capacity, then, the minimum price per kilo it should charge for the hard cheese is the variable cost per kilo = $15+5+3 = $23 per kilo. 2. If milk is in short supply, then each kilo of hard cheese displaces 2.5 kilos of soft cheese (10 liters of milk per kilo of hard cheese versus 4 liters of milk per kilo of soft cheese). Then, for the hard cheese, the minimum price Vermont should charge is the variable cost per kilo of hard cheese plus the contribution margin from 2.5 kilos of soft cheese, or, $23 + (2.5 $8 per kilo) = $43 per kilo That is, if milk is in short supply, Vermont should not agree to produce any hard cheese unless the buyer is willing to pay at least $43 per kilo.
12-19 (2530 min.) Value-added, nonvalue-added costs. 1. Category Value-added costs Nonvalue-added costs Examples a. Materials and labor for regular repairs b. Rework costs c. Expediting costs caused by work delays g. Breakdown maintenance of equipment Total d. Materials handling costs e. Materials procurement and inspection costs f. Preventive maintenance of equipment Total $ 800,000 $ 75,000 60,000 55,000 $190,000 $ 50,000 35,000 15,000 $100,000
Gray area
Classifications of value-added, nonvalue-added, and gray area costs are often not clear-cut. Other classifications of some of the cost categories are also plausible. For example, some students may include materials handling, materials procurement, and inspection costs and preventive maintenance as value-added costs (costs that customers perceive as adding value and as being necessary for good repair service) rather than as in the gray area. Preventive maintenance, for instance, might be regarded as value-added because it helps prevent nonvalueadding breakdown maintenance.
12-
2. Total costs in the gray area are $100,000. Of this, we assume 65%, or $65,000, are value-added and 35%, or $35,000, are nonvalue-added. Total value-added costs: $800,000 + $65,000 $ 865,000 Total nonvalue-added costs: $190,000 + $35,000 225,000 Total costs $1,090,000 Nonvalue-added costs are $225,000 $1,090,000 = 20.64% of total costs. Value-added costs are $865,000 $1,090,000 = 79.36% of total costs. 3.
Program (a) Quality improvement programs to reduce rework costs by 75% (0.75 $75,000) reduce expediting costs by 75% (0.75 $60,000) reduce materials and labor costs by 5% (0.05 $800,000) Total effect (b) Working with suppliers to reduce materials procurement and inspection costs by 20% (0.20 $35,000) reduce materials handling costs by 25% (0.25 $50,000) Total effect Transferring 65% of gray area costs (0.65 $19,500 = $12,675) as value-added and 35% (0.35 $19,500 = $6,825) as nonvalue-added Effect on value-added and nonvalue-added costs (c) Maintenance programs to increase preventive maintenance costs by 50% (0.50 $15,000) decrease breakdown maintenance costs by 40% (0.40 $55,000) Total effect Transferring 65% of gray area costs (0.65 $7,500 = $4,875) as value-added and 35% (0.35 $7,500 = $2,625) as nonvalue-added Effect on value-added and nonvalue-added costs Total effect of all programs Value-added and nonvalue-added costs calculated in requirement 2 Expected value-added and nonvalue-added costs as a result of implementing these programs Effect on Costs Classified as ValueNonvalueGray Added Added Area $56,250 45,000 $ 40,000 $ 40,000

 7,500 $ 0
If these programs are implemented in 2007, total costs would decrease from $1,090,000 (requirement 2) to $817,200 + $97,550 = $914,750, and the percentage of nonvalue-added costs would decrease from 20.64% (requirement 2) to $97,550 914,750 = 10.66%. These are significant improvements in Marinos performance.

12-20 (2530 min.) Target operating income, value-added costs, service company. 1. The classification of total costs in 2009 into value-added, nonvalue-added, or in the gray area in between follows: Value Gray NonvalueTotal Added Area added (4) = (1) (2) (3) (1)+(2)+(3) Doing calculations and preparing drawings 75% $400,000 $300,000 $300,000 Checking calculations and drawings 4% $400,000 $16,000 16,000 Correcting errors found in drawings 7% $400,000 $28,000 28,000 Making changes in response to client requests 6% $400,000 24,000 24,000 Correcting errors to meet government building code, 8% $400,000 32,000 32,000 Total professional labor costs 324,000 16,000 60,000 400,000 Administrative and support costs at 40% ($160,000 $400,000) of professional labor costs 129,600 6,400 24,000 160,000 Travel 18,000 18,000 Total $471,600 $22,400 $84,000 $578,000 Doing calculations and responding to client requests for changes are value-added costs because customers perceive these costs as necessary for the service of preparing architectural drawings. Costs incurred on correcting errors in drawings and making changes because they were inconsistent with building codes are nonvalue-added costs. Customers do not perceive these costs as necessary and would be unwilling to pay for them. Carasco should seek to eliminate these costs by making sure that all associates are well-informed regarding building code requirements and by training associates to improve the quality of their drawings. Checking calculations and drawings is in the gray area (some, but not all, checking may be needed). There is room for disagreement on these classifications. For example, checking calculations may be regarded as value added. 2. Reduction in professional labor-hours by a. Correcting errors in drawings (7% 8,000) b. Correcting errors to conform to building code (8% 8,000) Total Cost savings in professional labor costs (1,200 hours $50) Cost savings in variable administrative and support costs (40% $60,000) Total cost savings Current operating income in 2009 Add cost savings from eliminating errors Operating income in 2009 if errors eliminated

3. Currently 85% 8,000 hours = 6,800 hours are billed to clients generating revenues of $680,000. The remaining 15% of professional labor-hours (15% 8,000 = 1,200 hours) is lost in making corrections. Carasco bills clients at the rate of $680,000 6,800 = $100 per professional labor-hour. If the 1,200 professional labor-hours currently not being billed to clients were billed to clients, Carascos revenues would increase by 1,200 hours $100 = $120,000 from $680,000 to $800,000.

Snappys operating income in 2009 is as follows: Total for 250,000 Tiles (1) $ 950,000 720,000 25,000 120,000 60,000 925,000 $ 25,000 Per Unit (2) = (1) 250,000 $3.80 2.88 0.10 0.48 0.24 3.70 $0.10

3. Snappys operating income in 2009, if it makes changes in ordering and material handling, will be as follows: Total for 250,000 Tiles Per Unit (1) (2) = (1) 250,000 $950,000 $3.80 Revenues ($3.80 250,000) 720,000 2.88 Purchase cost of tiles ($2.88 250,000) 5,000 0.02 Ordering costs ($25 200) 87,500 0.35 Receiving and storage ($28 3,125) 60,000 0.24 Shipping ($40 1,500) 872,500 3.49 Total costs $ 77,500 $0.31 Operating income Through better cost management, Snappy will be able to achieve its target operating income of $0.30 per tile despite the fact that its revenue per tile has decreased by $0.20 ($4.00 $3.80), while its purchase cost per tile has decreased by only $0.12 ($3.00 $2.88).

Target manufacturing cost Manufacturing cost per unit of HJ6 in 2009 = per unit in 2008 90% = $1,738 0.90 = $1,564.20
Actual manufacturing cost per unit of HJ6 in 2009 was $1,550. Hence, Medical Instruments did achieve its target manufacturing cost per unit of $1,564.20 4. To reduce the manufacturing cost per unit in 2009, Medical Instruments reduced the cost per unit in each of the four cost categoriesdirect materials costs, batch-level costs, manufacturing operations costs, and engineering change costs. It also reduced machine-hours and number of engineering changes madethe quantities of the cost drivers. In 2008, Medical Instruments used 6 machine-hours per unit of HJ6 (21,000 machine-hours 3,500 units). In 2009, Medical Instruments used 5.5 machine-hours per unit of HJ6 (22,000 machine-hours 4,000 units). Medical Instruments reduced engineering changes from 14 in 2008 to 10 in 2009. Medical Instruments achieved these gains through value engineering activities that retained only those product features that customers wanted while eliminating nonvalue-added activities and costs.

12-23 (20 min.) Cost-plus target return on investment pricing. 1. Target operating income = target return on investment invested capital Target operating income (25% of $1,000,000) $250,000 Total fixed costs 358,000 Target contribution margin $608,000 Target contribution per room-night, ($608,000 16,000) Add variable costs per room-night Price to be charged per room-night Proof Total room revenues ($42 16,000 room-nights) Total costs: Variable costs ($4 16,000) Fixed costs Total costs Operating income $38 4 $42
$672,000 $ 64,000 358,000 422,000 $250,000
The full cost of a room = variable cost per room + fixed cost per room The full cost of a room = $4 + ($358,000 16,000) = $4 + $22.375 = $26.375 Markup per room = Rental price per room Full cost of a room = $42 $26.375 = $15.625 Markup percentage as a fraction of full cost = $15.625 $26.375 = 59.24% 2. If price is reduced by 10%, the number of rooms Beck could rent would increase by 10%. The new price per room would be 90% of $42 $37.80 The number of rooms Beck expects to rent is 110% of 16,000 17,600 The contribution margin per room would be $37.80 $4 $33.80 Contribution margin ($33.80 17,600) $594,880
Because the contribution margin of $594,880 at the reduced price of $37.80 is less than the contribution margin of $608,000 at a price of $42, Beck should not reduce the price of the rooms. Note that the fixed costs of $358,000 will be the same under the $42 and the $37.80 price alternatives and hence, are irrelevant to the analysis.

If Waterbuy increases the selling price of RF17 to $348, its operating income will be $696,000. This would be more than the $480,000 operating income Waterbury earns by selling 20,000 units at a price of $324, so, if its forecast is accurate, and based on financial considerations alone, Waterbury should increase the selling price to $348. 3.

Over the products life-cycle, Option B results in an overall higher operating income of $3,000,000. 3. Before selecting its pricing strategy, Intentical managers should evaluate whether the same pricing policy will be adopted globally. Different markets may need different pricing. For example, special taxes on imports may mean higher prices in foreign markets. Intenticals pricing strategy must be sensitive to changing customer preferences and reactions of competitors.

Relevant-cost approach to pricing decisions. $100,000 $40,000 14,000 54,000 46,000 $20,000 16,000 36,000 $ 10,000
Revenues (1,000 crates at $100 per crate) Variable costs: Manufacturing Marketing Total variable costs Contribution margin Fixed costs: Manufacturing Marketing Total fixed costs Operating income
Normal markup percentage: $46,000 $54,000 = 85.19% of total variable costs. 2. Only the manufacturing-cost category is relevant to considering this special order; no additional marketing costs will be incurred. The relevant manufacturing costs for the 200-crate special order are: Variable manufacturing cost per unit $40 200 crates Special packaging Relevant manufacturing costs
$ 8,000 2,000 $10,000
Any price above $50 per crate ($10,000 200) will make a positive contribution to operating income. Therefore, based on financial considerations, Stardom should accept the 200-crate special order at $55 per crate that will generate revenues of $11,000 ($55 200) and relevant (incremental) costs of $10,000. The reasoning based on a comparison of $55 per crate price with the $60 per crate absorption cost ignores monthly cost-volume-profit relationships. The $60 per crate absorption cost includes a $20 per crate cost component that is irrelevant to the special order. The relevant range for the fixed manufacturing costs is from 500 to 1,500 crates per month; the special order will increase production from 1,000 to 1,200 crates per month. Furthermore, the special order requires no incremental marketing costs. 3. If the new customer is likely to remain in business, Stardom should consider whether a strictly short-run focus is appropriate. For example, what is the likelihood of demand from other customers increasing over time? If Stardom accepts the 200-crate special offer for more than one month, it may preclude accepting other customers at prices exceeding $55 per crate. Moreover, the existing customers may learn about Stardoms willingness to set a price based on variable cost plus a small contribution margin. The longer the time frame over which Stardom keeps selling 200 crates of canned peaches at $55 a crate, the more likely it is that existing customers will approach Stardom for their own special price reductions. If the new customer wants the contract to extend over a longer time period, Stardom should negotiate a higher price.

2. The table below shows that if the selling price of game disks falls to $18 and the cost of each disk falls to $12, monthly gross margin falls to $72,000 (from $84,000 in April), and this results in a return on investment of 13%, which is below EAs target rate of return on investment of 15%. EA will have to cut costs to earn its target rate of return on investment. Operating Income Statement, May 2009 Revenues (12,000 disks $18 per disk) Materials (12,000 disks $12 per disk) Gross margin Ordering (40 vendors $250 per vendor) Cataloging (20 new titles $100 per title) Delivery and support (400 deliveries $15 per delivery) Billing and collection (300 customers $50 per customer) Operating Income Rate of return on investment ($39,000 $300,000 ) $216,000 144,000 72,000 10,000 2,000 6,000 15,000 $ 39,000 13.00%

Suppose it needs to sell X game disks to earn at least its 15% target rate of return on investment of $300,000. Then X needs to be such that: $6 X $31,500&gt;= $300,000 15% = $45,000 $6 X&gt;= $76,500 X&gt;= $76,500 $6 = 12,750 game disks i.e., EA must now sell at least 12,750 game disks per month to earn its target rate of return on investment of 15%.

Old CE100 Direct materials costs $182,000 Direct manufacturing labor costs 28,000 Machining costs 31,500 Testing costs 35,000 Rework costs 14,000 Ordering costs 3,360 Engineering costs 21,140 Total manufacturing costs $315,000 Cost Change $2.20 7,000 = $15,400 less $0.50 7,000 = $3,500 less Unchanged because capacity same (20% 2.5 7,000) $2 = $7,000 (See Note 1) (See Note 2) Unchanged because capacity same New CE100 $166,600 24,500 31,500 28,000 5,600 2,100 21,140 $279,440
Note 1: 10% of old CE100s are reworked. That is, 700 (10% of 7,000) CE100s made are reworked. Rework costs = $20 per unit reworked 700 = $14,000. If rework falls to 4% of New CE100s manufactured, 280 (4% of 7,000) New CE100s manufactured will require rework. Rework costs = $20 per unit 280 = $5,600. Note 2 : Ordering costs for New CE100 = 2 orders/month 50 components $21/order = $2,100
Unit manufacturing costs of New CE100 = $279,440 7,000 = $39.92 2. Total manufacturing cost reductions based on new design = $315,000 $279,440 = $35,560 = $35,560 7,000 = $5.08 per unit.
Reduction in unit manufacturing costs based on new design
The reduction in unit manufacturing costs based on the new design can also be calculated as Unit cost of old design, $45 ($315,000 7,000 units) Unit cost of new design, $39.92 = $5.08 Therefore, the target cost reduction of $6 per unit is not achieved by the redesign. 3. Changes in design have a considerably larger impact on costs per unit relative to improvements in manufacturing efficiency ($5.08 versus $1.50). One explanation is that many costs are locked in once the design of the radio-cassette is completed. Improvements in manufacturing efficiency cannot reduce many of these costs. Design choices can influence many direct and overhead cost categories, for example, by reducing direct materials requirements, by reducing defects requiring rework, and by designing in fewer components that translate into fewer orders placed and lower ordering costs.

Yes, increasing the selling price is a good idea because operating income increases without increasing invested capital, which results in a higher return on investment. The new return on investment exceeds the 10% target return on investment.

12-31 (20 min.) Cost-plus, time and materials. 1. The different markup rates used by Mazzoli for direct materials and direct labor may represent the approximate overheads (plus a profit margin) associated with each: for example, direct materials would incur ordering and handling overhead, and direct labor would incur overheads such as benefits, insurance, etc., and these may be approximately 50% and 100% of costs. These markups could also be driven by industry practice and competitive factors. 2. As shown in the table below, Bariess will tell White that she will have to pay $270 get the clutch plate repaired and $390 to get it replaced. COST Repair option (3.5 hrs. $30 per hr.; $40) Replace option(1.5 hrs. $30 per hr.; $200) PRICE (100% markup on labor cost; 50% markup on materials) Repair option ($105 2; $40 1.5) Replace option ($45 2; $200 1.5) Labor Materials Total Cost $105 $ 40 $145 45 200 245
Labor Materials $210 $ 60 90 300
Total Price $270 390
3. If the repair and replace options are equally safe and effective, White will choose to get the clutch plate repaired for $270 (rather than spend $390 on a replacement plate). 4. Mazzoli Brothers will earn a greater contribution toward overhead in the replace option ($145 = $390 $245) than in the repair option ($125 = $270 $145). If we assume that Mazzoli Brothers earns a constant profit margin on each job, it will earn a larger profit by replacing the clutch plate on Johanna Whites car for $390 than by repairing it for $270. Therefore, Bariess will recommend the replace option to White, which is not the one she would prefer. Recognizing this conflict, Bariess may even present only the replace option to Johanna White, or suggest that the repair option will result in a less-than-safe car. Of course, he runs the risk of White walking away and thinking of other options (at which point, he could present the repair option as a compromise). The problem is that Bariess has superior information about the repairs needed but his incentives may cause him to not reveal his information and instead use it to his advantage. It is only the sellers desire to build a reputation, to have a long-term relationship with the customer, and to have the customer recommend the seller to other potential buyers of the service that encourages an honest discussion of the options.

12-32 (25 min.) Cost-plus and market-based pricing. 1. California Temps full cost per hour of supplying contract labor is Variable costs Fixed costs ($240,000 80,000 hours) Full cost per hour $12 3 $15
Price per hour at full cost plus 20% = $15 1.20 = $18 per hour. 2. Contribution margins for different prices and demand realizations are as follows: Contribution Margin per Hour (3) = (1) (2) $4 5 6 7 8
Price per Hour (1) $16 17 18 19 20
Variable per Cost Hour (2) $12 12 12 12 12
Demand in Hours (4) 120,000 100,000 80,000 70,000 60,000
Total Contribution (5) = (3) (4) $480,000 500,000 480,000 490,000 480,000
Fixed costs will remain the same regardless of the demand realizations. Fixed costs are, therefore, irrelevant since they do not differ among the alternatives. The table above indicates that California Temps can maximize contribution margin ($500,000) and operating income by charging a price of $17 per hour. 3. The cost-plus approach to pricing in requirement 1 does not explicitly consider the effect of prices on demand. The approach in requirement 2 models the interaction between price and demand and determines the optimal level of profitability using concepts of relevant costs. The two different approaches lead to two different prices in requirements 1 and 2. As the chapter describes, pricing decisions should consider both demand or market considerations and supply or cost factors. The approach in requirement 2 is the more balanced approach. In most cases, of course, managers use the cost-plus method of requirement 1 as only a starting point. They then modify the cost-plus price on the basis of market considerationsanticipated customer reaction to alternative price levels and the prices charged by competitors for similar products.

The billing rates based on the activity-based cost structure make more sense. These billing rates reflect the ways the testing procedures consume the firms resources. 4. To stay competitive, Best Test needs to be more efficient in arctic testing. Roughly 44% of 301,965 arctic testings total cost ( 44% ) occurs in setups and facility costs.

12-35 (30 min.) Airline pricing, considerations other than cost in pricing. 1. If the fare is $500, a. Air Americo would expect to have 200 business and 100 pleasure travelers. b. Variable costs per passenger would be $80. c. Contribution margin per passenger = $500 $80 = $420. If the fare is $2,000, a. Air Americo would expect to have 190 business and 20 pleasure travelers. b. Variable costs per passenger would be $180. c. Contribution margin per passenger = $2,000 $180 = $1,820. Contribution margin from business travelers at prices of $500 and $2,000, respectively, follow: At a price of $500: $420 200 passengers At a price of $2,000: $1,820 190 passengers = $ 84,000 = $345,800
Air Americo would maximize contribution margin and operating income by charging business travelers a fare of $2,000. Contribution margin from pleasure travelers at prices of $500 and $2,000, respectively, follow: At a price of $500: $420 100 passengers At a price of $2,000: $1,820 20 passengers = $42,000 = $36,400
Air Americo would maximize contribution margin and operating income by charging pleasure travelers a fare of $500. Air Americo would maximize contribution margin and operating income by a price differentiation strategy, where business travelers are charged $2,000 and pleasure travelers $500. In deciding between the alternative prices, all other costs such as fuel costs, allocated annual lease costs, allocated ground services costs, and allocated flight crew salaries are irrelevant. Why? Because these costs will not change whatever price Air Americo chooses to charge. 2. The elasticity of demand of the two classes of passengers drives the different demands of the travelers. Business travelers are relatively price insensitive because they must get to their destination during the week (exclusive of weekends) and their fares are paid by their companies. A 300% increase in fares from $500 to $2,000 will deter only 5% of the business passengers from flying with Air Americo. In contrast, a similar fare increase will lead to an 80% drop in pleasure travelers who are paying for their own travels, unlike business travelers, and who may have alternative vacation plans they could pursue instead. 3. Since business travelers often want to return within the same week, while pleasure travelers often stay over weekends, a requirement that a Saturday night stay is needed to qualify for the $500 discount fare would discriminate between the passenger categories. This price discrimination is legal because airlines are service companies rather than manufacturing companies and because these practices do not, nor are they intended to, destroy competition. 12-
12-36 (25 min.) Ethics and pricing.
1. Baker prices at full product costs plus a mark-up of 10% = $80,000 + 10% of $80,000 = $80,000 + $8,000 = $88,000. 2. The incremental costs of the order are as follows: Direct materials $40,000 Direct manufacturing labor 10,000 30% of overhead costs (30% $30,000) 9,000 Incremental costs $59,000
Any bid above $59,000 will generate a positive contribution margin for Baker. Baker may prefer to use full product costs because it regards the new ball-bearings order as a long-term business relationship rather than a special order. For long-run pricing decisions, managers prefer to use full product costs because it indicates the bare minimum costs they need to recover to continue in business rather than shut down. For a business to be profitable in the long run, it needs to recover both its variable and its fixed product costs. Using only variable costs may tempt the manager to engage in excessive long-run price cutting as long as prices give a positive contribution margin. Using full product costs for pricing thereby prompts price stability. 3. Not using full product costs (including an allocation of fixed overhead) to price the order, particularly if it is in direct contradiction of company policy, may be unethical. In assessing the situation, the specific Standards of Ethical Conduct for Management Accountants, described in Chapter 1 (p. 16), that the management accountant should consider are listed below.
Competence Clear reports using relevant and reliable information should be prepared. Reports prepared on the basis of excluding certain fixed costs that should be included would violate the management accountants responsibility for competence. It is unethical for Lazarus to suggest that Decker change the cost numbers that were prepared for the bearings order and for Decker to change the numbers in order to make Lazaruss performance look good. Integrity The management accountant has a responsibility to avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest and advise all appropriate parties of any potential conflict. Lazaruss motivation for wanting Decker to reduce costs was precisely to earn a larger bonus. This action could be viewed as violating the standard for integrity. The Standards of Ethical Conduct require the management accountant to communicate favorable as well as unfavorable information. In this regard, both Lazaruss and Deckers behavior (if Decker agrees to reduce the cost of the order) could be viewed as unethical. Credibility The Standards of Ethical Conduct for Management Accountants require that information should be fairly and objectively communicated and that all relevant information should be disclosed. From a management accountants standpoint, reducing fixed overhead costs in deciding on the price to bid are clearly violating both of these precepts. For the reasons cited above, the behavior described by Lazarus and Decker (if he goes along with Lazaruss wishes) is unethical. Decker should indicate to Lazarus that the costs were correctly computed and that determining prices on the basis of full product costs plus a mark-up of 10% are required by company policy. If Lazarus still insists on making the changes and reducing the costs of the order, Decker should raise the matter with Lazaruss superior. If, after taking all these steps, there is continued pressure to understate the costs, Decker should consider resigning from the company, rather than engaging in unethical behavior.

CHAPTER 13 STRATEGY, BALANCED SCORECARD, AND STRATEGIC PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS 13-1 Strategy specifies how an organization matches its own capabilities with the opportunities in the marketplace to accomplish its objectives. 13-2 The five key forces to consider in industry analysis are: (a) competitors, (b) potential entrants into the market, (c) equivalent products, (d) bargaining power of customers, and (e) bargaining power of input suppliers. 13-3 Two generic strategies are (1) product differentiation, an organizations ability to offer products or services perceived by its customers to be superior and unique relative to the products or services of its competitors and (2) cost leadership, an organizations ability to achieve lower costs relative to competitors through productivity and efficiency improvements, elimination of waste, and tight cost control. 13-4 A customer preference map describes how different competitors perform across various product attributes desired by customers, such as price, quality, customer service and product features. 13-5 Reengineering is the fundamental rethinking and redesign of business processes to achieve improvements in critical measures of performance such as cost, quality, service, speed, and customer satisfaction. 13-6 The four key perspectives in the balanced scorecard are: (1) Financial perspectivethis perspective evaluates the profitability of the strategy, (2) Customer perspectivethis perspective identifies the targeted customer and market segments and measures the companys success in these segments, (3) Internal business process perspectivethis perspective focuses on internal operations that further both the customer perspective by creating value for customers and the financial perspective by increasing shareholder value, and (4) Learning and growth perspectivethis perspective identifies the capabilities the organization must excel at to achieve superior internal processes that create value for customers and shareholders. 13-7 A strategy map represents more detailed and specific cause-and-effect relationships across various scorecard measures. It describes specific links across the measures. 13-8 1. 2. A good balanced scorecard design has several features: It tells the story of a companys strategy by articulating a sequence of cause-and-effect relationships. It helps to communicate the strategy to all members of the organization by translating the strategy into a coherent and linked set of understandable and measurable operational targets. It places strong emphasis on financial objectives and measures in for-profit companies. Nonfinancial measures are regarded as part of a program to achieve future financial performance. It limits the number of measures to only those that are critical to the implementation of strategy.

It highlights suboptimal tradeoffs that managers may make when they fail to consider operational and financial measures together. Pitfalls to avoid when implementing a balanced scorecard are: Dont assume the cause-and-effect linkages are precise; they are merely hypotheses. An organization must gather evidence of these linkages over time. Dont seek improvements across all of the measures all of the time. Dont use only objective measures in the balanced scorecard. Dont fail to consider both costs and benefits of different initiatives before including these initiatives in the balanced scorecard. Dont ignore nonfinancial measures when evaluating managers and employees. Dont use too many measures.

13-10 Three key components in doing a strategic analysis of operating income are: 1. The growth component which measures the change in operating income attributable solely to the change in quantity of output sold from one year to the next. 2. The price-recovery component which measures the change in operating income attributable solely to changes in the prices of inputs and outputs from one year to the next. 3. The productivity component which measures the change in costs attributable to a change in the quantity and mix of inputs used in the current year relative to the quantity and mix of inputs that would have been used in the previous year to produce current year output. 13-11 An analyst can incorporate other factors such as the growth in the overall market and reductions in selling prices resulting from productivity gains into a strategic analysis of operating income. By doing so, the analyst can attribute the sources of operating income changes to particular factors of interests. For example, the analyst will combine the operating income effects of strategic price reductions and any resulting growth with the productivity component to evaluate a companys cost leadership strategy. 13-12 Engineered costs result from a cause-and-effect relationship between the cost driver, output, and the (direct or indirect) resources used to produce that output. Discretionary costs arise from periodic (usually annual) decisions regarding the maximum amount to be incurred. There is no measurable cause-and-effect relationship between output and resources used. 13-13 Downsizing (also called rightsizing) is an integrated approach configuring processes, products, and people to match costs to the activities that need to be performed for operating effectively and efficiently in the present and future. Downsizing is an attempt to eliminate unused capacity. 13-14 A partial productivity measure is the quantity of output produced divided by the quantity of an individual input used (e.g., direct materials or direct manufacturing labor). 13-15 No. Total factor productivity (TFP) and partial productivity measures work best together because the strengths of one offset weaknesses in the other. TFP measures are comprehensive, consider all inputs together, and explicitly consider economic substitution among inputs. Physical partial productivity measures are easier to calculate and understand and, as in the case of labor productivity, relate directly to employees tasks. Partial productivity measures are also easier to compare across different plants and different time periods. 13-2
13-16 (15 min.) Balanced scorecard. 1. La Quintas 2009 strategy is a cost leadership strategy. La Quinta plans to grow by producing high-quality boxes at a low cost delivered to customers in a timely manner. La Quintas boxes are not differentiated, and there are many other manufacturers who produce similar boxes. To succeed, La Quinta must produce high-quality boxes at lower costs relative to competitors through productivity and efficiency improvements. 2.

13-17 (20 min.) Analysis of growth, price-recovery, and productivity components (continuation of 13-16). 1. La Quintas operating income gain is consistent with the cost leadership strategy identified in requirement 1 of Exercise 13-16. The increase in operating income in 2009 was driven by the $140,000 gain in productivity in 2009. La Quinta took advantage of its productivity gain to reduce the prices of its boxes and to fuel growth. It increased market share by growing even though the total market size was unchanged. 2. The productivity component measures the change in costs attributable to a change in the quantity and mix of inputs used in a year relative to the quantity and mix of inputs that would have been used in a previous year to produce the current year output. It measures the amount by which operating income increases and costs decrease through the productive use of input quantities. When comparing productivities across years, the productivity calculations use current year input prices in all calculations. Hence, the productivity component is unaffected by input price changes. The productivity component represents savings in both variable costs and fixed costs. With respect to variable costs, such as direct materials, productivity improvements immediately translate into cost savings. In the case of fixed costs, such as fixed manufacturing conversion costs, productivity gains result only if management takes actions to reduce unused capacity. For example, reengineering manufacturing processes will decrease the capacity needed to produce a given level of output, but it will lead to a productivity gain only if management reduces the unused capacity by, say, selling off the excess capacity.

13-18 (20 min.) Strategy, balanced scorecard, merchandising operation. 1. Oceano&amp;Sons follows a product differentiation strategy. Oceanos designs are trendsetting, its T-shirts are distinctive, and it aims to make its T-shirts a must have for each and every teenager. These are all clear signs of a product differentiation strategy, and, to succeed, Oceano must continue to innovate and be able to charge a premium price for its product. 2. Possible key elements of Oceanos balance scorecard, given its product differentiation strategy: Financial Perspective (1) Increase in operating income from charging higher margins, (2) price premium earned on products. These measures will indicate whether Oceano has been able to charge premium prices and achieve operating income increases through product differentiation.
Customer Perspective (1) Market share in distinctive, name-brand T-shirts, (2) customer satisfaction, (3) new customers, (4) number of mentions of Oceanos T-shirts in the leading fashion magazines Oceanos strategy should result in improvements in these customer measures that help evaluate whether Oceanos product differentiation strategy is succeeding with its customers. These measures are, in turn, leading indicators of superior financial performance. Internal Business Process Perspective (1) Quality of silk-screening (number of colors, use of glitter, durability of the design), (2) frequency of new designs, (3) time between concept and delivery of design Improvements in these measures are expected to result in more distinctive and trendsetting designs delivered to its customers and in turn, superior financial performance. Learning and Growth Perspective (1) Ability to attract and retain talented designers (2) improvements in silk-screening processes, (3) continuous education and skill levels of marketing and sales staff, (4) employee satisfaction. Improvements in these measures are expected to improve Oceanos capabilities to produce distinctive designs that have a cause-and-effect relationship with improvements in internal business processes, which in turn lead to customer satisfaction and financial performance.

Effect of the industry-market-size factor on operating income Of the 48,700-unit (246,700 198,000) increase in sales between 2008 and 2009, 19,800 (10% 198,000) units are due to growth in market size, and 28,900 units are due to an increase in market share. The change in Oceanos operating income from the industry-market size factor rather than from specific strategic actions is: 19,800 $725,580 (the growth component in Exercise 13-19) $295,000 F 48,700 Effect of product differentiation on operating income The change in operating income due to: Increase in the selling price (revenue effect of price recovery) $246,700 F Increase in price of inputs (cost effect of price recovery) 308,788 F

The change in operating income between 2008 and 2009 can be summarized as follows: Change due to industry-market-size Change due to product differentiation Change due to cost leadership Change in operating income $ 295,000 F 986,068 F 70,632 F $1,351,700 F
Oceano has been very successful in implementing its product differentiation strategy. Nearly 73% ($986,068 $1,351,700) of the increase in operating income during 2009 was due to product differentiation, i.e., the distinctiveness of its T-shirts. It was able to raise prices of its products despite a decline in the cost of the T-shirts purchased. Oceanos operating income increase in 2009 was also helped by a growth in the overall market and a small productivity improvement, which it did not pass on to its customers in the form of lower prices.

13-21 (15 min.) Identifying and managing unused capacity (continuation of 13
18). 18).
1. The amount and cost of unused capacity at the beginning of year 2009 based on year 2009 production follows: Amount of Cost of Unused Unused Capacity Capacity Administrative, 4,000 3,500; (4,000 3,500) $310 500 $155,000 Design Discretionary Discretionary
cost, so cannot determine unused capacity*
*The
cost so cannot be calculated*
absence of a cause-and-effect relationship makes identifying unused capacity for discretionary costs difficult. Management cannot determine the desgin resources used for the actual output produced against which to compare design capacity.
2. Oceano can at most reduce administrative capacity by another 200 customers (3,750 200 = 3,550&gt;3,500 = actual customers; but 3,750 400 = 3,350&lt;3,500 = actual customers). Oceano will save another 200 $310 = $62,000. This is the maximum amount of costs Oceano can save in 2009. 3. Before Oceano downsizes administrative capacity, it should consider whether sales increases in the future would lead to a greater demand for and utilization of capacity as new customers are drawn to Oceanos distinctive productsat that point, customer service may be the key to new customer retention and further growth. Also, the market feedback often provided by customer service staff is probably key to Oceanos cutting-edge fashion strategy; some of this may be lost if administrative capacity is cut back. Additionally, significant reductions in capacity usually means laying off people which can hurt employee morale.

Strategy, balanced scorecard.
1. Meredith Corporation follows a product differentiation strategy in 2009. Merediths D4H machine is distinct from its competitors and generally regarded as superior to competitors products. To succeed, Meredith must continue to differentiate its product and charge a premium price. 2. Balanced Scorecard measures for 2009 follow: Financial Perspective (1) Increase in operating income from charging higher margins, (2) price premium earned on products. These measures indicate whether Meredith has been able to charge premium prices and achieve operating income increases through product differentiation.
Customer Perspective (1) Market share in high-end special-purpose textile machines, (2) customer satisfaction, (3) new customers. Merediths strategy should result in improvements in these customer measures that help evaluate whether Merediths product differentiation strategy is succeeding with its customers. These measures are leading indicators of superior financial performance. Internal Business Process Perspective (1) Manufacturing quality, (2) new product features added, (3) order delivery time. Improvements in these measures are expected to result in more distinctive products delivered to its customers and in turn superior financial performance. Learning and Growth Perspective (1) Development time for designing new machines, (2) improvements in manufacturing processes, (3) employee education and skill levels, (4) employee satisfaction. Improvements in these measures are likely to improve Merediths capabilities to produce distinctive products that have a cause-and-effect relationship with improvements in internal business processes, which in turn lead to customer satisfaction and financial performance.

Meredith has been successful in implementing its product differentiation strategy. More than 57% ($347,500 $607,500) of the increase in operating income during 2009 was due to product differentiation, i.e., the distinctiveness of its machines. It was able to raise the prices of its machines faster than the costs of its inputs and still grow market share. Merediths operating income increase in 2009 was also helped by a growth in the overall market and some productivity improvements.

1. The amount and cost of unused capacity at the beginning of year 2009 based on year 2009 production follows: Amount of Unused Capacity 40 20
Discretionary cost, so cannot determine unused capacity*
Manufacturing, 250 210; (250 210) $8,100 Selling and customer service, 100 80; (100 80) $9,900 Design
Cost of Unused Capacity $324,000 198,000
Discretionary cost so cannot be calculated*
*The
absence of a cause-and-effect relationship makes identifying unused capacity for discretionary costs difficult. Management cannot determine the R&amp;D resources used for the actual output produced to compare R&amp;D capacity against.
2. Meredith can reduce manufacturing capacity from 250 units to 220 (250 30) units. Meredith will save 30 $8,100 = $243,000. This is the maximum amount of costs Meredith can save in 2009. It cannot reduce capacity further (by another 30 units to 190 units) because it would then not have enough capacity to manufacture 210 units in 2009 (units that contribute significantly to operating income). 3. Meredith may choose not to downsize because it projects sales increases that would lead to a greater demand for and utilization of capacity. Meredith may have also decided not to downsize because downsizing requires a significant reduction in capacity. For example, Meredith may have chosen to downsize some more manufacturing capacity if it could do so in increments of say, 10, rather than 30 units. Also, Meredith may be focused on product differentiation, which is key to its strategy, rather than on cost reduction. Not reducing significant capacity also helps to boost and maintain employee morale.

To succeed, Snyder must deliver quality service at low cost. Improving productivity while maintaining quality is key. 2. Balanced Scorecard measures for 2009 follow:
Financial Perspective (1) Increase operating income from productivity gains and growth, (2) revenues per employee, (3) cost reductions in key areas, for example, software implementation and overhead costs. These measures indicate whether Snyder has been able to reduce costs and achieve operating income increases through cost leadership. Customer Perspective (1) Market share, (2) new customers, (3) customer responsiveness, (4) customer satisfaction. Snyders strategy should result in improvements in these customer measures that help evaluate whether Snyders cost leadership strategy is succeeding with its customers. These measures are leading indicators of superior financial performance. Internal Business Process Perspective (1) Time to complete customer jobs, (2) time lost due to errors, (3) quality of job (Is system running smoothly after job is completed?) Improvements in these measures are key drivers of achieving cost leadership and are expected to lead to more satisfied customers, lower costs, and superior financial performance. Learning and Growth Perspective (1) Time required to analyze and design implementation steps, (2) time taken to perform key steps implementing the software, (3) skill levels of employees, (4) hours of employee training, (5) employee satisfaction and motivation. Improvements in these measures are likely to improve Snyders ability to achieve cost leadership and have a cause-and-effect relationship with improvements in internal business processes, customer satisfaction, and financial performance.

Strategic analysis of operating income (continuation of 13-26).
Operating income for each year is as follows: 2008 $3,000,000 2009 $3,360,000
Revenues ($50,000 60; $48,000 70) Costs Software implementation labor costs ($60 30,000; $63 32,000) Software implementation support costs ($4,000 90; $4,100 90) Software development costs ($125,000 3; $130,000 3) Total costs Operating income Change in operating income 2.

Software implementation support costs 60 would not change since adequate capacity exists in 2008 to support year 2009 output and customers. Software development costs are discretionary costs not directly related to output and, hence, would not change in 2008 even if Snyder had to produce and sell the higher year 2009 output in 2008.

The analysis of operating income indicates that a significant amount of the increase in operating income resulted from Snyders productivity improvements in 2009. The company had to reduce selling prices while labor costs were increasing but it was able to increase operating income by improving its productivity. The productivity gains also allowed Snyder to be competitive and grow the business. The unfavorable price recovery component indicates that Snyder could not pass on increases in labor-related wages via price increases to its customers, very likely because its product was not differentiated from competitors offerings.

13-28 (25 min.) Analysis of growth, price-recovery, and productivity components (continuation of 13-27).
Effect of industry-market-size factor on operating income Of the 10-unit increase in sales from 60 to 70 units, 5% or 3 units (5% 60) are due to growth in market size, and 7 (10 3) units are due to an increase in market share. The change in Snyders operating income from the industry market-size factor rather than from specific strategic actions is: 3 $200,000 (the growth component in Exercise 13-27) $ 60,000 F 10 Effect of product differentiation on operating income Of the $2,000 decrease in selling price, 1% or $500 (1% $50,000) is due to a general decline in prices, and the remaining decrease of $1,500 ($2,000 $500) is due to a strategic decision by Snyders management to implement its cost leadership strategy of lowering prices to stimulate demand. The change in operating income due to a decline in selling price (other than the strategic reduction in price included in the cost leadership component) $500 70 units $ 35,000 U Increase in prices of inputs (cost effect of price recovery) 129,000 U Change in operating income due to product differentiation $164,000 U Effect of cost leadership on operating income Productivity component Effect of strategic decision to reduce selling price, $1,500 70 Growth in market share due to productivity improvement and strategic decision to reduce selling price 7 $200,000 (the growth component in Exercise 13-27) 10 Change in operating income due to cost leadership
$189,000 F 105,000 U

The change in operating income between 2008 and 2009 can then be summarized as Change due to industry-market-size Change due to product differentiation Change due to cost leadership Change in operating income $ 60,000 F 164,000 U 224,000 F $120,000 F
Snyder has been very successful in implementing its cost leadership strategy. Due to a lack of product differentiation, Snyder was unable to pass along increases in labor costs by increasing the selling pricein fact, the selling price declined by $2,000 per work unit. However, Snyder was able to take advantage of its productivity gains to reduce price, gain market share, and increase operating income.

13-29 (20 min.) Identifying and managing unused capacity (continuation of 13-26). 1. The amount and cost of unused capacity at the beginning of year 2009 based on work performed in year 2009 follows:
Amount of Cost of Unused Unused Capacity Capacity 20 $82,000 Discretionary Discretionary cost, so cannot cost, so cannot determine be calculated* unused capacity*
Software implementation support, 90 70; (90 70) $4,100 Software development
*The absence of a cause-and-effect relationship makes identifying unused capacity for discretionary costs difficult. Management cannot determine the software development resources used for the actual output produced to compare against software development capacity.
2. Snyder can reduce software implementation support capacity from 90 units to 75 (90 15) units. Snyder will save 15 $4,100 = $61,500. This is the maximum amount of costs Snyder can save by downsizing in 2009. It cannot reduce capacity further (by another 15 units to 60 units) because it would then not have enough capacity to perform 70 units of work in 2009 (work that contributes significantly to operating income). 3. Snyder may choose not to downsize because it projects sales increases that would lead to greater demand for and utilization of capacity. Snyder may have also decided not to downsize because downsizing requires significant reduction in capacity. For example, Snyder may have chosen to downsize additional software implementation support capacity if it could do so in, say, increments of 5, rather than 15 units. Not reducing significant capacity by laying off employees boosts employee morale and keeps employees more motivated and productive.

Solution Exhibit 13-30A shows the customer preference map for ZP98-type electronic components for Dransfield Company and Yorunt Manufacturing on price, delivery time, and quality. SOLUTION EXHIBIT 13-30A Customer Preference Map for ZP98-type Electronic Components
2. Dransfield currently follows a cost leadership strategy, which is reflected in its lower price compared to Yorunt Manufacturing. The electronic component ZP98 is similar to products offered by competitors. 3. In the internal-business-process perspective, Dransfield needs to set targets for decreasing the percentage of defective products sold and then identify measures that would be leading indicators of achieving this goal. For example, in the learning and growth perspective, Dransfield may want to measure the percentage of employees trained in quality management and the percentage of manufacturing processes with real-time feedback. The logic is that improvements in these measures will drive quality improvements and so reduce the percentage of defective products sold. To achieve its goals, items that Dransfield could include under each perspective of the balanced scorecard follows:
13-24
Financial Perspective
Operating income from productivity and quality improvement Operating income from growth Revenue growth Market share in electronic components Number of additional customers Customer-satisfaction ratings Percentage of defective products sold Order delivery time On-time delivery Number of major improvements in manufacturing process Employee-satisfaction ratings Percentage of employees trained in quality management Percentage of line workers empowered to manage processes Percentage of manufacturing processes with real-time feedback

Conversion costs and selling and customer-service costs will 4,500 not change since adequate capacity exists in 2008 to support year 2009 output and customers.

Change in operating income 3. The analysis of operating income indicates that a significant amount of the increase in operating income resulted from Dransfields cost leadership strategy. The company was able to improve quality and grow sales. The price recovery component indicates that selling prices increased in line with the market but Dransfields costs increased even faster, particularly the price of conversion cost capacity, as Dransfield focused on improving quality. The benefit of this improved quality came in the form of higher sales that more than offset the spending on quality.

13-32 (20 min.) Analysis of growth, price-recovery, and productivity components (continuation of 13-31)
Effect of the industry-market-size factor on operating income Of the 1,525 increase in sales from 4,500 to 6,025 units, 8% or 360 (8% 4,500) units are due to growth in market size, and 1,165 (1,525 360) units are due to an increase in market share.
The change in Dransfields operating income from the industry-market from specific strategic actions is: 360 $58,628 (the growth component in Exercise 13-31) 1,525 Effect of product differentiation on operating income The change in operating income due to: Increase in the selling price of ZP98 (revenue effect of price recovery) Increase in price of inputs (cost effect of price recovery) Change in operating income due to product differentiation size factor rather than $13,840 F

$ 2,222 F 44,788 F $47,010 F
The change in operating income between 2008 and 2009 can be summarized as follows: Change due to industry market-size Change due to product differentiation Change due to cost leadership Change in operating income $13,840 F 24,030 U 47,010 F $36,820 F
A thoughtful student might argue that the $24,030 U price-recovery variance could also be thought of as part of the productivity variance. Why? Because a large component of this cost is from conversion costs incurred to improve quality which is more closely associated with productivity and process improvement rather than product development and product differentiation. Under this assumption, the change in operating income between 2008 and 2009 can be summarized as follows: Change due to market industry size Change due to product differentiation Change due to cost leadership ($47,010 $24,030) Change in operating income $13,840 F 0 22,980 F $36,820 F
Dransfield has been successful in implementing its cost leadership strategy. The increase in operating income during 2009 was due to quality improvements and sales growth. Dransfields operating income increase in 2009 was also helped by a growth in the overall market size. 13-29
13-33 (20 min.) Identifying and managing unused capacity (continuation of 13-31) 1. The amount and cost of unused capacity at the beginning of year 2009 based on year 2009 production follows: Amount of Cost of Unused Unused Capacity Capacity Manufacturing, 8,000 6,250; (8,000 6,250) $23 1,750 $40,250 0 Selling and customer service, 60 60; (60 60) $4,180 $ 0 Discretionary cost, Discretionary cost, Advertising
so cannot determine unused capacity*
*The
so cannot be calculated*
absence of a cause-and-effect relationship makes identifying unused capacity for discretionary costs difficult. Management cannot determine the advertising resources used for the actual output produced to compare advertising capacity against.
2. Reasons for Downsizing: 1. Currently Dransfield only operates at 78% of capacity (6,250 units 8,000 units). Downsizing will allow the company to match resources available with resources consumed and eliminate management time and effort in managing unused capacity. 2. Downsizing should lead to cost savings and increased efficiency that result in higher operating income. Reasons against Downsizing: 1. Downsizing may require layoffs, which can hurt employee morale and loyalty. 2. Dransfield may want to maintain some unused capacity for future growth. 3a. Misclassification of the cost will not affect overall operating income because the cost will still be included in the calculation of operating income, only as advertising instead of sales and customer service. For financial accounting purposes, it will still be part of selling and administration (period) costs. 3b. This cost will not affect the growth component since the growth component is calculated using cost data from 2008. Misclassification of the cost will have no effect on the sales and customer service component of the cost effect of price recovery because adequate capacity exists in 2008 to produce 2009 output. It will increase the advertising component of the cost effect of price recovery. Misclassification of this cost will increase the productivity component because the capacity amount for selling and customer-service cost will be understated. There will be no effect on advertising because advertising capacity had not changed. The net effect of this misclassification is to decrease the price-recovery component by increasing the cost effect of price-recovery for advertising and to increase the productivity component by an equal amount by understating the selling and customer-service capacity. 3c. The misclassification will make the performance of the ZP98 manager look better than it is because selling and customer-service costs that the manager is evaluated on will appear lower. The higher advertising cost does not affect the managers performance evaluation because advertising costs are excluded from the managers performance evaluation measure. The managers cost classification actions are unethical because the sole purpose of the misclassification of customer-service costs as advertising costs is to make the managers performance look better than it is. Like many other corporations, Dransfields code of conduct, values and culture need to clearly proscribe such behavior. 13-30

13-35 (20 min.) Balanced scorecard. 1. Caltexs strategy is to focus on service-oriented customers who are willing to pay a higher price for services. Even though gasoline is largely a commodity product, Caltex wants to differentiate itself through the service it provides at its retailing stations. Does the scorecard represent Caltexs strategy? By and large it does. The focus of the scorecard is on measures of process improvement, quality, market share, and financial success from product differentiation and charging higher prices for customer service. There are some deficiencies that the subsequent assignment questions raise but, abstracting from these concerns for the moment, the scorecard does focus on implementing a product differentiation strategy. Having concluded that the scorecard has been reasonably well designed, how has Caltex performed relative to its strategy in 2009? It appears from the scorecard that Caltex was successful in implementing its strategy in 2009. It achieved all targets in the financial, internal business, and learning and growth perspectives. The only target it missed was the market
13-31
share target in the customer perspective. At this stage, students may raise some questions about whether this is a good scorecard measure. Requirement 3 gets at this issue in more detail. The bottom line is that measuring market share in the overall gasoline market rather than in the service-oriented customer market segment is not a good scorecard measure, so not achieving this target may not be as big an issue as it may seem at first. 2. Yes, Caltex should include some measure of employee satisfaction and employee training in the learning and growth perspective. Caltexs differentiation strategy and ability to charge a premium price is based on customer service. The key to good, fast, and friendly customer service is well trained and satisfied employees. Untrained and dissatisfied employees will have poor interactions with customers and cause the strategy to fail. Hence, training and employee satisfaction are very important to Caltex for implementing its strategy. These measures are leading indicators of whether Caltex will be able to successfully implement its strategy and should be measured on the balanced scorecard. 3. Caltexs strategy is to focus on the 60% of gasoline consumers who are service-oriented, not on the 40% price-shopper segment. To evaluate if it has been successful in implementing its strategy, Caltex needs to measure its market share in its targeted market segment, serviceoriented customer, not its market share in the overall market. Given Caltexs strategy, it should not be concerned if its market share in the price-shopper segment declines. In fact, charging premium prices will probably cause its market share in this segment to decline. Caltex should replace market share in overall gasoline market with market share in the service-oriented customer segment in its balanced scorecard customer measure. Caltex may also want to consider putting a customer satisfaction measure on the scorecard. This measure should capture an overall evaluation of customer reactions to the facility, the convenience store, employee interactions, and quick turnaround. The customer satisfaction measure would serve as a leading indicator of market share in the service-oriented customer segment. 4. Although there is a cause-and-effect link between internal business process measures and customer measures on the current scorecard, Caltex should add more measures to tighten this linkage. In particular, the current scorecard measures focus exclusively on refinery operations and not on gas station operations. Caltex should add measures of gas station performance such as cleanliness of the facility, turnaround time at the gas pumps, the shopping experience at the convenience store, and the service provided by employees. Many companies do random audits of their facilities to evaluate how well their branches and retail outlets are performing. These measures would serve as leading indicators of customer satisfaction and market share in Caltexs targeted segments. 5. Caltex is correct in not measuring changes in operating income from productivity improvements on its scorecard under the financial perspective. Caltexs strategy is to grow by charging premium prices for customer service. The scorecard measures focus on Caltexs success in implementing this strategy. Productivity gains per se are not critical to Caltexs strategy and therefore, should not be measured on the scorecard.

13-36 (30 min.) Balanced scorecard. 1. The market for color laser printers is competitive. Lees strategy is to produce and sell high quality laser printers at a low cost. The key to achieving higher quality is reducing defects in its manufacturing operations. The key to managing costs is dealing with the high fixed costs of Lees automated manufacturing facility. To reduce costs per unit, Lee would have to either produce more units or eliminate excess capacity. The scorecard correctly measures and evaluates Lees broad strategy of growth through productivity gains and cost leadership. There are some deficiencies, of course, that subsequent assignment questions will consider. It appears from the scorecard that Lee was not successful in implementing its strategy in 2009. Although it achieved targeted performance in the learning and growth and internal business process perspectives, it significantly missed its targets in the customer and financial perspectives. Lee has not had the success it targeted in the market and has not been able to reduce fixed costs. 2. Lees scorecard does not provide any explanation of why the target market share was not met in 2009. Was it due to poor quality? Higher prices? Poor post-sales service? Inadequate supply of products? Poor distribution? Aggressive competitors? The scorecard is not helpful for understanding the reasons underlying the poor market share. Lee may want to include some measures in the customer perspective (and internal business process perspective) that get at these issues. These measures would then serve as leading indicators (based on cause-and-effect relationships) for lower market share. For example, Lee should measure customer satisfaction with its printers on various dimensions of product features, quality, price, service, and availability. It should measure how well its printers match up against other color laser printers on the market. This is critical information for Lee to successfully implement its strategy. 3. Lee should include a measure of employee satisfaction to the learning and growth perspective and a measure of new product development to the internal business process perspective. The focus of its current scorecard measures is on processes and not on people and innovation. Lee considers training and empowering workers as important for implementing its highquality, low-cost strategy. Therefore employee training and employee satisfaction should appear in the learning and growth perspective of the scorecard. Lee can then evaluate if improving employee-related measures results in improved internal-business process measures, market share and financial performance. Adding new product development measures to internal business processes is also important. As Lee reduces defects, Lees costs will not automatically decrease because many of Lees costs are fixed. Instead, Lee will have more capacity available to it. The key question is how Lee will obtain value from this capacity. One important way is to use the capacity to produce and sell new models of its products. Of course if this strategy is to work, Lee must develop new products at the same time that it is improving quality. Hence, the scorecard should contain some measure to monitor progress in new product development. Improving quality without developing and selling new products (or downsizing) will result in weak financial performance.
13-33
4. Improving quality and significantly downsizing to eliminate unused capacity is difficult. Recall that the key to improving quality at Lee Corporation is training and empowering workers. As quality improvements occur, capacity will be freed up, but because costs are fixed, quality improvements will not automatically lead to lower costs. To reduce costs, Lees management must take actions such as selling equipment and laying off employees. But how can management lay off the very employees whose hard work and skills led to improved quality? If it did lay off employees now, will the remaining employees ever work hard to improve quality in the future? For these reasons, Lees management should first focus on using the newly available capacity to sell more product. If it cannot do so and must downsize, management should try to downsize in a way that would not hurt employee morale, such as through retirements and voluntary severance. 13-37 (20 min.) Partial productivity measurement. 1. Guble Companys partial productivity ratios in 2009 are as follows:
= Quantity of output produced in 2009 Yards of direct materials used in 2009 Quantity of output produced in 2009 Units of manuf. capacity in 2009 = 2, 650, 000 1.59 wallets = per yard 1, 669,500
0.95 wallets 2, 650, 000 = per unit of 2,800, 000 capacity
Direct materials partial productivity Conversion costs partial productivity

=
To compare partial productivities in 2009 with partial productivities in 2008, we first calculate the inputs that would have been used in 2008 to produce year 2009s 2,650,000 units of output assuming the year 2008 relationship between inputs and outputs.
Direct materials = = Manufacturing capacity = 1,875,000 yards (2008) 2,650,000 output units in 2009 2,500,000 output units in 2008 1,875,000 yards 1.06 = 1,987,500 yards 3,000,000 units of capacity, because manufacturing capacity is fixed, and adequate capacity existed in 2008 to produce year 2009 output.
Partial productivity calculations for 2008 based on year 2009 output (to make the partial productivities comparable across the two years):
Direct materials partial productivity = Quantity of output produced in 2009 Yards of direct materials that would have been used in 2008 to produce year 2009 output Quantity of output produced in 2009 Units of manuf. capacity that would have been used in 2008 to produce year 2009 output = = 1.33 units per yard 1,987,500 2, 650, 000
Conversion costs partial productivity

2, 650, 000 3, 000, 000

The calculations indicate that Berkshire improved the partial productivity of direct materials and conversion costs between 2008 and 2009 via efficiency improvements and by reducing unused manufacturing capacity.
13-34
2. Guble Company management can use the partial productivity measures to set targets for the next year. Partial productivity measures can easily be compared over multiple periods. For example, they may specify bonus payments if partial productivity of direct materials increases to 1.75 units of output per yard and if partial productivity of conversion costs improves to 1 unit of output per unit of capacity. A major advantage of partial productivity measures is that they focus on a single input; hence, they are simple to calculate and easy to understand at the operations level. Managers and operators can also examine these numbers to understand the reasons underlying productivity changes from one period to the nextbetter training of workers, lower labor turnover, better incentives, or improved methods. Management can then implement and sustain these factors in the future. 13-38 (25 min.) Total factor productivity (continuation of 13-37)
Total factor productivity for 2009 using 2009 prices Quantity of output produced in 2009 Costs of inputs used in 2009 based on 2009 prices 2,650,000 (1,669,500 $4)+(8, 680, 000) 2, 650, 000 2,650,000 $6, 678, 000 $8,680,00 $15,358,000 0.1725 units of output per dollar of input

2. By itself, the 2009 TFP of 0.1725 units per dollar of input is not particularly helpful. We need something to compare the 2009 TFP against. We use, as a benchmark, TFP calculated using the inputs that Berkshire would have used in 2008 to produce 2,650,000 units of output calculated in requirement 1 at 2009 prices. Using the current years (2009) prices in both calculations controls for input price differences and focuses the analysis on the adjustments the manager made in the quantities of inputs in response to changes in prices. 2009 price of capacity =

= = = =
Using year 2009 prices, total factor productivity increased 12.3% [(0.1725 0.1536) 0.1536] from 2008 to 2009.
13-35
3. Total factor productivity increased because Guble produced more output per dollar of input in 2009 relative to 2008, measured in both years using 2009 prices. The change in partial productivity of direct materials and conversion costs tells us that Guble used less materials and capacity in 2009 relative to output, than in 2008. A major advantage of TFP over partial productivity measures is that TFP combines the productivity of all inputs and so measures gains from using fewer physical inputs and substitution among inputs. Partial productivities cannot be combined to indicate the overall effect on cost as a result of these individual improvements. The TFP measure allows managers to evaluate the change in overall productivity by simultaneously combining all inputs to measure gains from using fewer physical inputs as well as substitution among inputs. 13-39 (35 min.) Strategic analysis of operating income. 1. Halsey is following a product differentiation strategy. Halsey offers a wide selection of clothes and excellent customer service. Halseys strategy is to distinguish itself from its competitors and to charge a premium price. 2. Operating income for each year is as follows:

Pieces of clothing that would be required to be purchased in 2010 would be the same as that required in 2009 because output is the same between 2009 and 2010. Purchasing and administrative costs and selling and customer-service costs will not change since adequate capacity exists in 2009 to support year 2010 output and customers. The cost effects of growth component are: Costs of goods sold Selling&amp;customer-service costs Purch.&amp;admin. costs Cost effect of growth (40,000 40,000) (51,000 51,000) (980 980) $40 = $0 $7 = 0 $250 = 0 $0

The analysis of operating income indicates that a significant amount of the increase in operating income resulted from productivity gains rather than product differentiation. The company was unable to charge a premium price for its clothes. Thus, the strategic analysis of operating income indicates that Halsey has not been successful at implementing its premium price, product differentiation strategy, despite the fact that operating income increased by more than 10% between 2009 and 2010. Halsey could not pass on increases in purchase costs to its customers via higher prices. Halsey must either reconsider its product-differentiation strategy or focus managers on increasing margins and growing market share by offering better product variety and superb customer service.

CHAPTER 14 COST ALLOCATION, CUSTOMER-PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS, AND SALES-VARIANCE ANALYSIS 14-1 Disagree. Cost accounting data plays a key role in many management planning and control decisions. The division president will be able to make better operating and strategy decisions by being involved in key decisions about cost pools and cost allocation bases. Such an understanding, for example, can help the division president evaluate the profitability of different customers. 14-2 1. 2. 3. 4. Exhibit 14-1 outlines four purposes for allocating costs: To provide information for economic decisions. To motivate managers and other employees. To justify costs or compute reimbursement amounts. To measure income and assets.
14-3 Exhibit 14-2 lists four criteria used to guide cost allocation decisions: 1. Cause and effect. 2. Benefits received. 3. Fairness or equity. 4. Ability to bear. The cause-and-effect criterion and the benefits-received criterion are the dominant criteria when the purpose of the allocation is related to the economic decision purpose or the motivation purpose. 14-4 Disagree. In general, companies have three choices regarding the allocation of corporate costs to divisions: allocate all corporate costs, allocate some corporate costs (those controllable by the divisions), and allocate none of the corporate costs. Which one of these is appropriate depends on several factors: the composition of corporate costs, the purpose of the costing exercise, and the time horizon, to name a few. For example, one can easily justify allocating all corporate costs when they are closely related to the running of the divisions and when the purpose of costing is, say, pricing products or motivating managers to consume corporate resources judiciously. 14-5 Disagree. If corporate costs allocated to a division can be reallocated to the indirect cost pools of the division on the basis of a logical cause-and-effect relationship, then it is in fact preferable to do sothis will result in fewer division indirect cost pools and a more costeffective cost allocation system. This reallocation of allocated corporate costs should only be done if the allocation base used for each division indirect cost pool has the same cause-and-effect relationship with every cost in that indirect cost pool, including the reallocated corporate cost. Note that we observe such a situation with corporate human resource management (CHRM) costs in the case of CAI, Inc., described in the chapterthese allocated corporate costs are included in each divisions five indirect cost pools. (On the other hand, allocated corporate treasury cost pools are kept in a separate cost pool and are allocated on a different cost-allocation base than the other division cost pools.)

14 6 Customer profitability analysis highlights to managers how individual customers differentially contribute to total profitability. It helps managers to see whether customers who contribute sizably to total profitability are receiving a comparable level of attention from the organization. 14 7 Companies that separately record (a) the list price and (b) the discount have sufficient information to subsequently examine the level of discounting by each individual customer and by each individual salesperson. 14 8 No. A customer profitability profile highlights differences in current period&apos;s profitability across customers. Dropping customers should be the last resort. An unprofitable customer in one period may be highly profitable in subsequent future periods. Moreover, costs assigned to individual customers need not be purely variable with respect to short run elimination of sales to those customers. Thus, when customers are dropped, costs assigned to those customers may not disappear in the short run. 14 9 Five categories in a customer cost hierarchy are identified in the chapter. The examples given relate to the Spring Distribution Company used in the chapter: Customer output unit level costscosts of activities to sell each unit (case) to a customer. An example is product handling costs of each case sold. Customer batch level costscosts of activities that are related to a group of units (cases) sold to a customer. Examples are costs incurred to process orders or to make deliveries. Customer sustaining costscosts of activities to support individual customers, regardless of the number of units or batches of product delivered to the customer. Examples are costs of visits to customers or costs of displays at customer sites. Distribution channel costscosts of activities related to a particular distribution channel rather than to each unit of product, each batch of product, or specific customers. An example is the salary of the manager of Springs retail distribution channel. Corporate sustaining costscosts of activities that cannot be traced to individual customers or distribution channels. Examples are top management and general administration costs. 14-10 Using the levels approach introduced in Chapter 7, the sales volume variance is a Level 2 variance. By sequencing through Level 3 (sales mix and sales quantity variances) and then Level 4 (market size and market share variances), managers can gain insight into the causes of a specific sales-volume variance caused by changes in the mix and quantity of the products sold as well as changes in market size and market share. 11 14 11 The total sales mix variance arises from differences in the budgeted contribution margin of the actual and budgeted sales mix. The composite unit concept enables the effect of individual product changes to be summarized in a single intuitive number by using weights based on the mix of individual units in the actual and budgeted mix of products sold. 12 14 12A favorable sales quantity variance arises because the actual units of all products sold exceed the budgeted units of all products sold.
14-2
13 14 13 The sales quantity variance can be decomposed into (a) a market size variance (because the actual total market size in units is different from the budgeted market size in units), and (b) a market share variance (because the actual market share of a company is different from the budgeted market share of a company). Both variances use the budgeted average contribution margin per unit. 14 14 14 Some companies believe that reliable information on total market size is not available and therefore they choose not to compute market size and market share variances. 15 14 15 The direct materials efficiency variance is a Level 3 variance. Further insight into this variance can be gained by moving to a Level 4 analysis where the effect of mix and yield changes are quantified. The mix variance captures the effect of a change in the relative percentage use of each input relative to that budgeted. The yield variance captures the effect of a change in the total number of inputs required to obtain a given output relative to that budgeted. 14-16 (15-20 min.) Cost allocation in hospitals, alternative allocation criteria. 1. Direct costs = $2.40 Indirect costs ($11.52 $2.40) = $9.12 Overhead rate 2. = $9.12 = 380% $2.40
The answers here are less than clear-cut in some cases. Overhead Cost Item Allocation Criteria Processing of paperwork for purchase Cause and effect Supplies room management fee Benefits received
Operating-room and patient-room handling costs Cause and effect Administrative hospital costs University teaching-related costs Malpractice insurance costs Cost of treating uninsured patients Profit component Benefits received Ability to bear Ability to bear or benefits received Ability to bear None. This is not a cost.
3. Assuming that Meltzers insurance company is responsible for paying the $4,800 bill, Meltzer probably can only express outrage at the amount of the bill. The point of this question is to note that even if Meltzer objects strongly to one or more overhead items, it is his insurance company that likely has the greater incentive to challenge the bill. Individual patients have very little power in the medical arena. In contrast, insurance companies have considerable power and may decide that certain costs are not reimbursablefor example, the costs of treating uninsured patients.

2. I prefer the allocation based on segment margins because a cause-and-effect relationship may exist between headquarter costs and division segment margin headquarter staff are likely to spend more time on divisions that have more revenues and segment margins. Segment margins can also be justified on the ability-to-bear principle divisions with higher margins can bear more of the headquarter costs. The physical size of the divisions probably has no causeand-effect relationship with headquarter costs.
14-4
3. None of the divisions should be dropped, since all four have positive segment margins before considering the headquarters cost allocation. As seen by these two options, the allocation of headquarter costs is arbitrary and should not serve as the basis for closing a division. Dropping the microwave division would be worthwhile only if the $3,563,750 of allocated headquarter costs could be saved if the microwave division is closed a very unlikely scenario. 14-18 (30 min.)

Allocation Base Direct costs Floor space Number of employees
The decision context should guide (a) whether costs should be allocated, and (b) the preferred cost allocation base. Decisions about, say, performance measurement, may be made on a combination of financial and nonfinancial measures. It may well be that Rembrandt may prefer to exclude allocated costs from the financial measures to reduce areas of dispute. Where cost allocation is required, the cause-and-effect and benefits-received criteria are recommended in Chapter 14. The $14,550,000 is a fixed overhead cost. This means that on a short-run basis, the cause-and-effect criterion is not appropriate but Rembrandt could attempt to identify the cost drivers for these costs in the long run when these costs are likely to be more variable. Rembrandt should look at how the $14,550,000 cost benefits the three divisions. This will help guide the choice of an allocation base in the short run. 4. The analysis in requirement 2 should not guide the decision on whether to shut down any of the divisions. The overhead costs are fixed costs in the short run. It is not clear how these costs would be affected in the long run if Rembrandt shut down one of the divisions. Also, each division is not independent of the other two. A decision to shut down, say, the restaurant, likely would negatively affect the attendance at the casino and possibly the hotel. Rembrandt should examine the future revenue and future cost implications of different resource investments in the three divisions. This is a future-oriented exercise, whereas the analysis in requirement 2 is an analysis of past costs.

3. When corporate overhead is allocated to the divisions on the basis of division margins (requirement 1), each division is profitable (has positive operating margin) and the Paper division is the most profitable (has the highest operating margin percentage) by a slim margin, while the Pulp division is the least profitable. When Bardems suggested bases are used to allocate the different types of corporate overhead costs (requirement 2), we see that, in fact, the Pulp division is not profitable (it has a negative operating margin). Paper continues to be the most profitable and, in fact, it is significantly more profitable than the Fibers division. If division performance is linked to operating margin percentages, Pulp will resist this new way of allocating corporate costs, which causes its operating margin of nearly 15% (in the old scheme) to be transformed into a -3.2% operating margin. The new cost allocation methodology reveals that, if the allocation bases are reasonable, the Pulp division consumes a greater share of corporate resources than its share of segment margins would indicate. Pulp generates 12.6% of the segment margins, but consumes almost 29.7% ($2,671,714 $9,000,000) of corporate overhead resources. Paper will welcome the changeits operating margin percentage rises the most, and Fibers operating margin percentage remains practically the same. Note that in the old scheme, Paper was being penalized for its efficiency (smallest share of administrative costs), by being allocated a larger share of corporate overhead. In the new scheme, its efficiency in terms of administrative costs, employees, and square footage is being recognized. 4. The new approach is preferable because it is based on cause-and-effect relationships between costs and their respective cost drivers in the long run. Human resource management costs are allocated using the number of employees in each division because the costs for recruitment, training, etc., are mostly related to the number of employees in each division. Facility costs are mostly incurred on the basis of space occupied by each division. Corporate administration costs are allocated on the basis of divisional administrative costs because these costs are incurred to provide support to divisional administrations. To overcome objections from the divisions, Bardem may initially choose not to allocate corporate overhead to divisions when evaluating performance. He could start by sharing the results with the divisions, and giving themparticularly the Pulp divisionadequate time to figure out how to reduce their share of cost drivers. He should also develop benchmarks by comparing the consumption of corporate resources to competitors and other industry standards.

3. If corporate costs are allocated to the channels, the retail channel will show an operating loss of $10,805,000 ($3,195,000 $14,000,000), and the wholesale channel will show an operating profit of $47,000,000 ($98,000,000 $51,000,000). The overall operating profit, of course, is still $36,195,000, as in requirement 2. There is, however, no cause-and-effect or benefits-received relationship between corporate costs and any allocation base, i.e., the allocation of $51,000,000 to the wholesale channel and of $14,000,000 to the retail channel is arbitrary and not useful for decision-making. Therefore, the management of Ramish Electronics should not base any performance evaluations or investment/disinvestment decisions based on these channel-level operating income numbers. They may want to take corporate costs into account, however, when making pricing decisions.

Customers
The above table and graph present the summary results. Wizard, the most profitable customer, provides 75% of total operating income. The three best customers provide 124% of ISs operating income, and the other two, by incurring losses for IS, erode the extra 24% of operating income down to ISs operating income. 3. The options that Instant Service should consider include: a. Increase the attention paid to Wizard and Avery. These are key customers, and every effort has to be made to ensure they retain IS. IS may well want to suggest a minor price reduction to signal how important it is in their view to provide a costeffective service to these customers. b. Seek ways of reducing the costs or increasing the revenues of the problem accountsOkie and Grainger. For example, are the copying machines at those customer locations outdated and in need of repair? If yes, an increased charge may be appropriate. Can IS provide better on-site guidelines to users about ways to reduce breakdowns? c. As a last resort, IS may want to consider dropping particular accounts. For example, if Grainger (or Okie) will not agree to a fee increase but has machines continually breaking down, IS may well decide that it is time not to bid on any more work for that customer. But care must then be taken to otherwise use or get rid of the excess fixed capacity created by firing unprofitable customers.

Chapel Hill Pharmacy has a lower gross margin percentage than Charleston (8.33% vs. 12.50%) and consumes more resources to obtain this lower margin. 2. a. Ways Figure Four could use this information include: Pay increased attention to the top 20% of the customers. This could entail asking them for ways to improve service. Alternatively, you may want to highlight to your own personnel the importance of these customers; e.g., it could entail stressing to delivery people the importance of never missing delivery dates for these customers. Work out ways internally at Figure Four to reduce the rate per cost driver; e.g., reduce the cost per order by having better order placement linkages with customers. This cost reduction by Figure Four will improve the profitability of all customers. Work with customers so that their behavior reduces the total system-wide costs. At a minimum, this approach could entail having customers make fewer orders and fewer line items. This latter point is controversial with students; the rationale is that a reduction in the number of line items (diversity of products) carried by Ma and Pa stores may reduce the diversity of products Figure Four carries.

c.
14-13
There are several options here: Simple verbal persuasion by showing customers cost drivers at Figure Four. Explicitly pricing out activities like cartons delivered and shelf-stocking so that customers pay for the costs they cause. Restricting options available to certain customers, e.g., customers with low revenues could be restricted to one free delivery per week. An even more extreme example is working with customers so that deliveries are easier to make and shelf-stocking can be done faster. d. Offer salespeople bonuses based on the operating income of each customer rather than the gross margin of each customer.
Some students will argue that the bottom 40% of the customers should be dropped. This action should be only a last resort after all other avenues have been explored. Moreover, an unprofitable customer today may well be a profitable customer tomorrow, and it is myopic to focus on only a 1-month customer-profitability analysis to classify a customer as unprofitable.

Solution Exhibit 14-23 presents the sales-volume, sales-quantity, and sales-mix variances for lower-tier tickets, upper-tier tickets, and in total for Detroit Penguins in 2010. The sales-quantity variances can also be computed as: Budgeted Budgeted Actual units Budgeted units Sales-quantity = of all tickets of all tickets sales - mix cont. margin percentage variance sold sold per ticket The sales-quantity variances are: Lower-tier tickets = (11,000 10,000) 0.40 $20 = $ 8,000 F Upper-tier tickets = (11,000 10,000) 0.60 $ 5 = 3,000 F All tickets $11,000 F The sales-mix variance can also be computed as: Actual units Sales-mix = of all tickets variance sold Budgeted Budgeted Actual sales-mix sales-mix contribution margin percentage percentage per ticket 
The sales-mix variances are Lower-tier tickets Upper-tier tickets All tickets = 11,000 (0.30 0.40) $20 = 11,000 (0.70 0.60) $ 5 = $22,000 U = 5,500 F $16,500 U
3. The Detroit Penguins increased average attendance by 10% per game. However, there was a sizable shift from lower-tier seats (budgeted contribution margin of $20 per seat) to the upper-tier seats (budgeted contribution margin of $5 per seat). The net result: the actual contribution margin was $5,500 below the budgeted contribution margin.

14-24 (30 min.) Variance analysis, working backward. 1. and 2. Solution Exhibit 14-24 presents the sales-volume, sales-quantity, and sales-mix variances for the Plain and Chic wine glasses and in total for Jinwa Corporation in June 2009. The steps to fill in the numbers in Solution Exhibit 14-24 follow: Step 1 Consider the static budget column (Column 3): Static budget total contribution margin Budgeted units of all glasses to be sold Budgeted contribution margin per unit of Plain Budgeted contribution margin per unit of Chic $5,600 2,000 $2 $6
Suppose that the budgeted sales-mix percentage of Plain is y. Then the budgeted salesmix percentage of Chic is (1 y). Therefore, (2,000y $2) + (2,000 (1 y) $6) $4000y + $12,000 $12,000y $8,000y y 1y = = = = = $5,600 $5,600 $6,400 0.8 or 80% 20%
Jinwas budgeted sales mix is 80% of Plain and 20% of Chic. We can then fill in all the numbers in Column 3. Step 2 Next, consider Column 2 of Solution Exhibit 14-24. The total of Column 2 in Panel C is $4,200 (the static budget total contribution margin of $5,600 the total sales-quantity variance of $1,400 U which was given in the problem). We need to find the actual units sold of all glasses, which we denote by q. From Column 2, we know that (q 0.8 $2) + (q 0.2 $6) $1.6q + $1.2q $2.8q q = = = = $4,200 $4,200 $4,200 1,500 units
So, the total quantity of all glasses sold is 1,500 units. This computation allows us to fill in all the numbers in Column 2.
14-17
Step 3 Next, consider Column 1 of Solution Exhibit 14-24. We know actual units sold of all glasses (1,500 units), the actual sales-mix percentage (given in the problem information as Plain, 60%; Chic, 40%), and the budgeted unit contribution margin of each product (Plain, $2; Chic, $6). We can therefore determine all the numbers in Column 1. Solution Exhibit 14-24 displays the following sales-quantity, sales-mix, and sales-volume variances: Sales-Volume Variance Plain $1,400 U Chic 1,200 F All Glasses $ 200 U Sales-Mix Variances Plain $ 600 U Chic 1,800 F All Glasses $1,200 F Sales-Quantity Variances Plain $ 800 U Chic 600 U All Glasses $1,400 U
3. Jinwa Corporation shows an unfavorable sales-quantity variance because it sold fewer wine glasses in total than was budgeted. This unfavorable sales-quantity variance is partially offset by a favorable sales-mix variance because the actual mix of wine glasses sold has shifted in favor of the higher contribution margin Chic wine glasses. The problem illustrates how failure to achieve the budgeted market penetration can have negative effects on operating income.

The market share variance is favorable because the actual 12.5% market share was higher than the budgeted 10% market share. The market size variance is unfavorable because the market size decreased 4% [(25,000,000 24,000,000) 25,000,000].

14-27 (40 min.) Allocation of corporate costs to divisions. 1. a. The purposes for allocating central corporate costs to each division include the following (students may pick and discuss any two): To provide information for economic decisions. Allocations can signal to division managers that decisions to expand (contract) activities will likely require increases (decreases) in corporate costs that should be considered in the initial decision about expansion (contraction). When top management is allocating resources to divi sions, analysis of relative divi sion profitability should consider differential use of corporate services by divisions. Some alloca tion schemes can encourage the use of central ser vices that would otherwise be underutilized. A common rationale related to this pur pose is to remind profit center managers that central corporate costs exist and that division earnings must be adequate to cover some share of those costs. Motivation. Allocations create incentives for division managers to control costs; for example, by reducing the number of employees at a divi sion, a manager will save direct labor costs as well as central personnel and payroll costs allocated on the basis of number of employees. Allocation also creates incentives for division managers to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency with which central corporate costs are spent. Cost justification or reimbursement. Some lines of business of Richfield Oil may be regulated with cost data used in determining fair prices; allocations of central corporate costs will result in higher prices being set by a regulator. Income measurement for external parties. Richfield Oil may in clude allocations of central corporate costs in its external line-of-busi ness reporting.

Using these allocation percentages and the allocation bases suggested by Rhodes, we can allocate the $3,228 M of corporate costs as shown below. Note that the costs in Cost Pool 2 total $800 M ($150 + $110 + $200 + $140 + $200).

4. The table below compares the reported income of each division under the original revenue-based allocation scheme and the new 4-pool-based allocation scheme. Oil&amp;Gas Upstream seems 17% less profitable than before ($3,467.5 $4,193 = 83%), and may resist the new allocation, but each of the other divisions seem more profitable (or less loss-making) than before and they will probably welcome it. In this setting, corporate costs are relatively large (about 13% of total operating costs), and division incomes are sensitive to the corporate cost allocation method.

Strengths of Rhodes proposal relative to existing single-cost pool method:
14-25
a.
Better able to capture cause-and-effect relationships. Interest on debt is more likely caused by the financing of assets than by revenues. Personnel and payroll costs are more likely caused by the number of employ ees than by revenues. Relatively simple. No extra information need be collected beyond that already available. (Some students will list the extra costs of Rhodes&apos; proposal as a weakness. However, for a company with $30 billion in revenues, those extra costs are minimal.)
b.
Weaknesses of Rhodes proposal relative to existing single-cost pool method: a. May promote dysfunctional decision making. May encour age division managers to lease or rent assets rather than to purchase assets, even where it is economical for Richfield Oil to purchase them. This off-balance sheet financing will re duce the identifiable assets of the division and thus will reduce the interest on debt costs allocated to the division. (Richfield Oil could counteract this problem by incorporating leased and rented assets in the&quot;identifiable assets&quot;base.)
Note: Some students criticized Rhodes proposal, even though agreeing that it is preferable to the existing single-cost pool method. These criticisms include:
a. The proposal does not adequately capture cause-and-effect relationships for the legal and research and development cost pools. For these cost pools, specific identification of individual projects with an individual division can better capture cause-and-effect relation ships. The proposal may give rise to disputes over the definition and valuation of identifiable assets. The use of actual rather than budgeted amounts in the allocation bases cre ates interdependencies between divisions. Moreover, use of ac tual amounts means that division managers do not know cost alloca tion consequences of their decisions until the end of each reporting period. A separate allocation of fixed and variable costs would result in more refined cost allocations. It is questionable that 100% of central corporate costs should be allo cated. Many students argue that public affairs should not be allocated to any division, based on the notion that division managers may not control many of the individual expenditures in this cost pool.

A cause-and-effect relationship may exist between Human Resources costs and the number of employees at each division. Rent and depreciation costs may be related to square feet, except that very expensive machines may require little square footage, which is inconsistent with this choice of allocation base. The Accounting Department costs are probably related to the revenues earned by each division higher revenues mean more transactions and more accounting. Other overhead costs are allocated arbitrarily. 3. The manager suggesting the new allocation bases probably works in the Cake Division. Under the old scheme, the Cake Division shows an operating loss after allocating headquarter costs because it is smaller, yet was charged an equal amount (a third) of headquarter costs. The new allocation scheme shows an operating profit in the Cake Division, even after allocating headquarter costs. The ABC method is a better way to allocate headquarter costs because it uses cost allocation bases that, by and large, represent cause-and-effect relationships between various categories of headquarter costs and the demands that different divisions place on these costs.

2. Customer 03 is unprofitable and of the rest, customer 06 has the lowest operating income. Customer 05 has a very low operating income to revenue percentage. Customer 3 is unprofitable because it has very low revenues and requires a rush order. Customer 5 has a low operating income percentage because it places many orders, several rush orders, and requires a large number of customer return visits for repairs in the 30-day period after the sale. Ring Delights could make these customers more profitable by charging extra for rush orders, charging a small fee for repairs, increasing the selling price, or requiring a minimum total revenue for free post-sales service. Whatever decision it takes, Ring Delights must also consider the effect the decision might have on sales. 14-28

Customer S is the most profitable customer, despite having only 52% (31,800 60,800) of the unit volume of Customer R. A major explanation is that Customer R receives a $1.20 discount per case while Customer S receives only a $0.48 discount per case. Customer T is unprofitable, while the smaller customer P is profitable. Customer T receives a $1.44 discount per case, makes more frequent orders, requires more customer visits, and requires more delivery miles than Customer P. 2. Separate reporting of both the list selling price and the actual selling price enables Spring Distribution to examine which customers receive different discounts and how salespeople may differ in the discounts they grant. There is a size pattern in the discounts across the five customers, except for Customer T, larger volume customers get larger discounts: Sales Volume R (60,800 cases) S (31,800 cases) Q (8,750 cases) T (3,900 cases) P (2,080 cases) Discount per case $1.20 $0.48 $0.24 $1.44 $0.00
The reasons for the $1.44 discount for T should be explored.
14-29
3. Dropping customers should be the last resort taken by Spring Distribution. Factors to consider include the following: a. What is the expected future profitability of each customer? Are the currently unprofitable (T) or low-profit (P) customers likely to be highly profitable in the future? b. Are there externalities from having some customers, even if they are unprofitable in the short run? For example, some customers have a marquee-value that is in effect advertising that benefits the business. c. What costs are avoidable if one or more customers are dropped? d. Can the relationship with the problem customers be restructured so that there is a win-win situation? For example, could Customer T get by with fewer deliveries per month?

2. Customer C is Bizzans only unprofitable customer. All other customers are profitable in line with revenue, except customer A which has more revenue than D but less operating income.
14-31
If Customer C were not being given price discounts, C would be profitable. The salesperson is giving discounts on orders, even though the size of the order is small. It is costing Bizzan money to process many small orders as opposed to a few large orders. To turn Customer C into a profitable customer, Bizzan needs to encourage Customer C to place fewer, larger orders and offer a price discount only if Customer C changes behavior, rather than as a reward for repeat business. Customer A has many rush orders in proportion to total number of orders. Bizzan should work with Customer A to find a production schedule that would meet its needs without having to rush the order. Customer E has high warehousing needs that are costly to Bizzan. Bizzan should work with Customer E to align its production schedule to Customer Es needs. The exchange and repair rate for customers with rush orders is higher than for other customers. Bizzan should explore whether rushing an order reduces attention to quality. Either reducing the number of rush orders (which would also save Bizzan money) or working toward increasing the quality of rush orders would help to reduce these costs. The three most profitable customers (E, D, and A) generate 87% of the customer-level operating income. These customers are valued customers and should receive the highest level of customer service.

4. The following factors help us understand the differences between actual and budgeted amounts: The difference in actual versus budgeted contribution margins was $1,107,000 unfavorable ($11,968,000 $13,075,000). However, the contribution margin from the PalmCE exceeded budget by $2,079,500 ($8,492,000 $6,412,500) while the contributions from the PalmPro and the PalmKid were lower than expected and offset this gain. This is attributable to lower unit sales in the case of PalmPro and lower contribution margins in the case of PalmKid. In percentage terms, the PalmCE accounted for 71% of actual contribution margin versus a planned 49% contribution margin. However, the PalmPro accounted for 16% versus planned 19% and the PalmKid accounted for only 13% versus a planned 32%. In unit terms (rather than in contribution terms), the PalmKid accounted for 50% of the sales mix as planned. However, the PalmPro accounted for only 10% versus a budgeted 12.5% and the PalmCE accounted for 40% versus a planned 37.5%. Variance analysis for the PalmPro shows an unfavorable sales-mix variance outweighing a favorable sales-quantity variance and producing an unfavorable salesvolume variance. The drop in sales-mix share was far larger than the gain from an overall greater quantity sold. The PalmCE gained both from an increase in share of the sales mix as well as from the increase in the overall number of units sold. The PalmKid maintained sales-mix share at 50%as a result, the sales-mix variance is zero. However, PalmKid sales gained from the overall increase in units sold.
14-36
Overall, there was a favorable total sales-volume variance. However, the large drop in PalmKids contribution margin per unit combined with a decrease in the actual number of PalmPro units sold as well as a drop in the actual contribution margin per unit below budget, led to the total contribution margin being much lower than budgeted.
Other factors could be discussed herefor example, it seems that the PalmKid did not achieve much success with a three digit price pointselling price was budgeted at $149 but dropped to $102. At the same time, variable costs increased. This could have been due to a marketing push that did not succeed.

3. The required actual market size is the budgeted market size, i.e., 400,000 units. This can easily be seen by setting up the following equation: Budgeted Budgeted Budgeted Actual Market - size market size market size market contribution margin variance per composite unit in units in units share for budgeted mix = (M 400,000) 0.25 $130.75 When M = 400,000, the market-size variance is $0.

This can be seen by setting up the appropriate equation: Market-share Budgeted Actual Actual Budgeted contribution margin variance market size market market = per composite unit in units share share for budgeted mix = Actual market size (M 25%) $130.75 When M = 25%, the market-share variance is $0.

The direct materials mix variance of $2.50 F indicates that actual product mix uses relatively more of less expensive ingredients than planned. In this case, the actual mix contains slightly more coloring and slightly less flavoring. The direct materials yield variance of $7.50 U occurs because the amount of total inputs needed (235 cups) exceeded the budgeted amount (230 cups) expected to produce 2,300 pops. The variances are very small relative to the budgeted cost to produce 2,300 pops. The company should not spend resources investigating them, especially since changing the standard mix slightly does not significantly affect product quality.

The favorable mix variance arises from using more of the cheaper pine (and less oak) than the budgeted mix. The yield variance indicates that the dressers required more total inputs (61,000 b.f.) than expected (60,000 b.f.) for the production of 3,000 dressers. Both variances are relatively small and probably within tolerable limits. PDS should investigate whether substituting the cheaper pine for the more expensive oak caused the unfavorable yield variance. It should also be careful that using more of the cheaper pine does not reduce the quality of the dresser or how customers perceive it.

4. The behavior of the salespeople is costing Glat Corporation $640 in profit (the difference between the incomes in requirements 2 and 3.) Although management thinks the salespeople are saving money based on the budgeted order costs, in reality they are costing the firm money by increasing the costs of orders ($936 in requirement 2 versus $896 in requirement 3) and at the same time increasing their sales commissions ($1,240 in requirement 2 versus $640 in requirement 3). This is not ethical. Glat Corporation needs to change the structure of the sales commission, possibly linking commissions to the overall units sold rather than on number of orders. They could also base commissions on total revenues, which will discourage salespeople from offering discounts unless they are needed to close the sale. A negative consequence of greater reluctance to offer discounts is that salespeople will not seek larger orders but instead focus on smaller orders that do not require discounts to be offered. This behavior will, in turn, increase ordertaking costs.

2. The Florida Division manager will prefer the number of employees allocation base because it results in the highest operating margin for the division. 3. The Arizona Division and the Delaware Division receive roughly the same percentage allocation of headquarter costs regardless of the allocation base used (Arizona range = 25%-29%; Delaware range = 18.75%-23.5%). However, the Colorado Division and the Florida Division vary widely (Colorado range = 22.4%-50%; Florida range = 6.25%25.1%). All four methods are reasonable options, but none clearly meets the cause-andeffect criterion for selecting the allocation base. If larger divisions tend to consume more of headquarters resources, then using division revenues or number of employees seem to
14-55
be the best choices. Without compelling reason to change, Greenbold should stay with the division revenues as the allocation base. Another alternative is to use segment margin as the allocation base on the grounds that segment margin represents the ability of different divisions to bear corporate overhead costs. 4. If Greenbold elects to use direct costs as the allocation base, the Florida Division will appear to have a $507,650 operating loss. Even so, the Florida Division generates a $900,000 segment margin before allocating the cost of the corporate headquarters. As seen in the analysis in requirement 1, different allocation bases yield different operating incomes for the Florida Division, with the direct cost allocation base being the lowest. The Florida Division should not be closed because 1) the choice of allocation base is not based on a cause-and-effect relation (i.e., it is arbitrary), and 2) the division earns positive segment margin which contributes to covering the cost of the corporate headquarters. The Florida Division should only be closed if closing it will save more than $507,650 in corporate headquarter costs a highly unlikely scenario.

CHAPTER 15 ALLOCATION OF SUPPORT-DEPARTMENT COSTS, COMMON COSTS, AND REVENUES 15-1 The single-rate (cost-allocation) method makes no distinction between fixed costs and variable costs in the cost pool. It allocates costs in each cost pool to cost objects using the same rate per unit of the single allocation base. The dual-rate (cost-allocation) method classifies costs in each cost pool into two poolsa variable-cost pool and a fixed-cost poolwith each pool using a different cost-allocation base. 15-2 The dual-rate method provides information to division managers about cost behavior. Knowing how fixed costs and variable costs behave differently is useful in decision making. 15-3 Budgeted cost rates motivate the manager of the supplier department to improve efficiency because the supplier department bears the risk of any unfavorable cost variances. 15-4 Examples of bases used to allocate support department cost pools to operating departments include the number of employees, square feet of space, number of hours, and machine-hours. 15-5 The use of budgeted indirect cost allocation rates rather than actual indirect rates has several attractive features to the manager of a user department: a. the user knows the costs in advance and can factor them into ongoing operating choices, b. the cost allocated to a particular user department does not depend on the amount of resources used by other user departments, and c. inefficiencies at the department providing the service do not affect the costs allocated to the user department. 15-6 Disagree. Allocating costs on the basis of estimated long-run use by user department managers means department managers can lower their cost allocations by deliberately underestimating their long-run use (assuming all other managers do not similarly underestimate their usage). 15-7 The three methods differ in how they recognize reciprocal services among support departments: a. The direct (allocation) method ignores any services rendered by one support department to another; it allocates each support departments costs directly to the operating departments. b. The step-down (allocation) method allocates support-department costs to other support departments and to operating departments in a sequential manner that partially recognizes the mutual services provided among all support departments. c. The reciprocal (allocation) method allocates support-department costs to operating departments by fully recognizing the mutual services provided among all support departments.
15-1
15-8 The reciprocal method is theoretically the most defensible method because it fully recognizes the mutual services provided among all departments, irrespective of whether those departments are operating or support departments. 15-9 The stand-alone cost-allocation method uses information pertaining to each user of a cost object as a separate entity to determine the cost-allocation weights. The incremental cost-allocation method ranks the individual users of a cost object in the order of users most responsible for the common costs and then uses this ranking to allocate costs among those users. The first-ranked user of the cost object is the primary user and is allocated costs up to the costs of the primary user as a stand-alone user. The second-ranked user is the first incremental user and is allocated the additional cost that arises from two users instead of only the primary user. The third-ranked user is the second incremental user and is allocated the additional cost that arises from three users instead of two users, and so on. The Shapley Value method calculates an average cost based on the costs allocated to each user as first the primary user, the second-ranked user, the third-ranked user, and so on. 15-10 All contracts with U.S. government agencies must comply with cost accounting standards issued by the Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB). 15-11 Areas of dispute between contracting parties can be reduced by making the rules of the game explicit and in writing at the time the contract is signed. 15-12 Companies increasingly are selling packages of products or services for a single price. Revenue allocation is required when managers in charge of developing or marketing individual products in a bundle are evaluated using product specific revenues. 15-13 The stand-alone revenue-allocation method uses product specific information on the products in the bundle as weights for allocating the bundled revenues to the individual products. The incremental revenue allocation method ranks individual products in a bundle according to criteria determined by managementsuch as the product in the bundle with the most salesand then uses this ranking to allocate bundled revenues to the individual products. The first-ranked product is the primary product in the bundle. The second-ranked product is the first incremental product, the third-ranked product is the second incremental product, and so on. 15-14 Managers typically will argue that their individual product is the prime reason why consumers buy a bundle of products. Evidence on this argument could come from the sales of the products when sold as individual products. Other pieces of evidence include surveys of users of each product and surveys of people who purchase the bundle of products. 15-15 A dispute over allocation of revenues of a bundled product could be resolved by (a) having an agreement that outlines the preferred method in the case of a dispute, or (b) having a third party (such as the company president or an independent arbitrator) make a decision.

The dual-rate method permits a more refined allocation of the power department costs; it permits the use of different allocation bases for different cost pools. The fixed costs result from decisions most likely associated with the practical capacity level. The variable costs result from decisions most likely associated with monthly usage.

Indirect costs allocated to Dark C. Division
Indirect costs allocated to Milk C. Division
2. When budgeted rates/budgeted quantities are used, the Dark Chocolate and Milk Chocolate Divisions know at the start of 2009 that they will be charged a total of $69,000 and $46,000 respectively for transportation. In effect, the fleet resource becomes a fixed cost for each division. Then, each may be motivated to over-use the trucking fleet, knowing that their 2009 transportation costs will not change. When budgeted rates/actual quantities are used, the Dark Chocolate and Milk Chocolate Divisions know at the start of 2009 that they will be charged a rate of $2,300 per round trip, i.e., they know the price per unit of this resource. This enables them to make operating decisions knowing the rate they will have to pay for transportation. Each can still control its total transportation costs by minimizing the number of round trips it uses. Assuming that the budgeted rate was based on honest estimates of their annual usage, this method will also provide an estimate of the excess trucking capacity (the portion of fleet costs not charged to either division). In contrast, when 15-4
actual costs/actual quantities are used, the two divisions must wait until year-end to know their transportation charges. The use of actual costs/actual quantities makes the costs allocated to one division a function of the actual demand of other users. In 2009, the actual usage was 45 trips, which is 5 trips below the 50 trips budgeted. The Dark Chocolate Division used all the 30 trips it had budgeted. The Milk Chocolate Division used only 15 of the 20 trips budgeted. When costs are allocated based on actual costs and actual quantities, the same fixed costs are spread over fewer trips resulting in a higher rate than if the Milk Chocolate Division had used its budgeted 20 trips. As a result, the Dark Chocolate Division bears a proportionately higher share of the fixed costs. Using actual costs/actual rates also means then any efficiencies or inefficiencies of the trucking fleet get passed along to the user divisions. In general, this will have the effect of making the truck fleet less careful about its costs, although in 2009, it appears to have managed its costs well, leading to a lower actual cost per roundtrip relative to the budgeted cost per round trip. For the reasons stated above, of the three single-rate methods suggested in this problem, the budgeted rate and actual quantity may be the best one to use. (The management of Chocolat, Inc. would have to ensure that the managers of the Dark Chocolate and Milk Chocolate divisions do not systematically overestimate their budgeted use of the fleet division in an effort to drive down the budgeted rate). 15-18 (20 min.) Dual-rate method, budgeted versus actual costs, and practical capacity versus actual quantities (continuation of 15-17). 1. Charges with dual rate method. Variable indirect cost rate Fixed indirect cost rate = = = $1,500 per trip $40,000 budgeted costs/ 50 round trips budgeted $800 per trip
Dark Chocolate Division Variable indirect costs, $1,500 30 Fixed indirect costs, $800 30 Milk Chocolate Division Variable indirect costs, $1,500 15 Fixed indirect costs, $800 20
$45,000 24,000 $69,000 $22,500 16,000 $38,500
2. The dual rate changes how the fixed indirect cost component is treated. By using budgeted trips made, the Dark Chocolate Division is unaffected by changes from its own budgeted usage or that of other divisions. When budgeted rates and actual trips are used for allocation (see requirement 1.b. of problem 15-17), the Dark Chocolate Division is assigned the same $24,000 for fixed costs as under the dual-rate method because it made the same number of trips as budgeted. However, note that the Milk Chocolate Division is allocated $16,000 in fixed trucking costs under the dual-rate system, compared to $800 15 actual trips = $12,000 when actual trips are used for allocation. As such, the Dark Chocolate Division is not made to appear
15-5
disproportionately more expensive than the Milk Chocolate Division simply because the latter did not make the number of trips it budgeted at the start of the year.

2. Direct method Step-down (AS first) Step-down (IS first)
The direct method ignores any services to other support departments. The step-down method partially recognizes services to other support departments. The information systems support group (with total budget of $2,400,000) provides 10% of its services to the AS group. The AS support group (with total budget of $600,000) provides 25% of its services to the information systems support group. When the AS group is allocated first, a total of $2,550,000 is then assigned out from the IS group. Given CORPs disproportionate (2:1) usage of the services of IS, this method then results in the highest overall allocation of costs to CORP. By contrast, GOVTs usage of the AS group exceeds that of CORP (by a ratio of 8:7), and so GOVT is assigned relatively more in support costs when AS costs are assigned second, after they have already been incremented by the AS share of IS costs as well.

Three criteria that could determine the sequence in the step-down method are: a. Allocate support departments on a ranking of the percentage of their total services provided to other support departments. 1. Administrative Services 25% 2. Information Systems 10% b. Allocate support departments on a ranking of the total dollar amount in the support departments. 1. Information Systems $2,400,000 2. Administrative Services $ 600,000 c. Allocate support departments on a ranking of the dollar amounts of service provided to other support departments 1. Information Systems (0.10 $2,400,000) = $240,000 2. Administrative Services (0.25 $600,000) = $150,000
The approach in (a) above typically better approximates the theoretically preferred reciprocal method. It results in a higher percentage of support-department costs provided to other support departments being incorporated into the step-down process than does (b) or (c), above. 15-20 (50 min.)

The four methods differ in the level of support department cost allocation across support departments. The level of reciprocal service by support departments is material. Administrative Services supplies 25% of its services to Information Systems. Information Systems supplies 10% of its services to Administrative Services. The Information Department has a budget of $2,400,000 that is 400% higher than Administrative Services. The reciprocal method recognizes all the interactions and is thus the most accurate. This is especially clear from looking at the repeated iterations calculations.

15-23 1.
(2030 min.) Allocation of common costs. Three methods of allocating the $55 are: Stand-alone Incremental (Ed primary) Incremental (Mike primary) Shapley value a. Stand-alone cost allocation method. Mike: $40 $40 + $20 $20 $40 + $20 $55 = 2 3 1 3 $55 = $37 Mike $37 35 40 37.50 Ed $18 20 15 17.50
Ed:
 $55
=
 $55
= $18
b. Incremental cost allocation method. Assume Ed (the owner) is the primary user and Mike is the incremental user: User Ed Mike Total Costs Allocated $20 35 ($55 $20) $55 Cumulative Costs Allocated $20 $55
This method may generate some dispute over the ranking. Notice that Mike pays only $35 despite his prime interest in the more expensive Internet access package. Ed could make the argument that if Mike were ranked first he would have to pay $40 since he is the major Internet user. Then, Ed would only have to pay $15! Assume Mike is the primary user and Ed is the incremental user: Costs Allocated $40 15 ($55 $40) $55 Cumulative Costs Allocated $40 $55
User Mike Ed Total
c. Shapley value (average over costs allocated as the primary and incremental user). Costs Allocated ($40 + $35) 2 = $37.50 ($20 + $15) 2 = $17.50
User Mike Ed
15-14
2. I would recommend the Shapley value. It is fairer than the incremental method because it avoids considering one user as the primary user and allocating more of the common costs to that user. It also avoids disputes about who is the primary user. It allocates costs in a manner that is close to the costs allocated under the stand-alone method but takes a more comprehensive view of the common cost allocation problem by considering primary and incremental users that the stand-alone method ignores. More generally, other criteria to guide common cost allocations include the following: a. Cause and effect. It is not possible to trace individual causes (either Internet access or phone services) to individual effects (uses by Mike or Ed). The $55 total package is a bundled product. b. Benefits received. There are various ways of operationalizing the benefits received: (i) Monthly service charge for their prime interestInternet access for Mike ($40), and phone services for Ed ($20). This measure captures the services available to each person. (ii) Actual usage by each person. This would involve keeping a record of usage by each person and then allocating the $55 on a percent usage time basis. This measure captures the services actually used by each person, but it may prove burdensome and it would be subject to honest reporting by Ed and Mike. c. Ability to pay. This criterion requires that Mike and Ed agree upon their relative ability to pay. d. Fairness or equity. This criterion is relatively nebulous. A straightforward approach would be to split the $55 equally among the two users.
15-15
15-24 (20 min.) Allocation of common costs. 1. Alternative approaches for the allocation of the $1,800 airfare include the following: a. The stand-alone cost allocation method. This method would allocate the air fare on the basis of each clients percentage of the total of the individual stand-alone costs. Baltimore client Chicago client $1, 400 $1,800 = $1,008 $1, 400 $1,100 $1,100 $1,800 = $1, 400 $1,100 792 $1,800 Advocates of this method often emphasize an equity or fairness rationale. b. The incremental cost allocation method. This requires the choice of a primary party and an incremental party. If the Baltimore client is the primary party, the allocation would be: Baltimore client Chicago client $1,400 400 $1,800
One rationale is that Gunn was planning to make the Baltimore trip, and the Chicago stop was added subsequently. Some students have suggested allocating as much as possible to the Baltimore client since Gunn had decided not to work for them. If the Chicago client is the primary party, the allocation would be: Chicago client Baltimore client $1,100 700 $1,800
One rationale is that the Chicago client is the one who is going to use Gunns services, and presumably receives more benefits from the travel expenditures. c. Gunn could calculate the Shapley value that considers each client in turn as the primary party: The Baltimore client is allocated $1,400 as the primary party and $700 as the incremental party for an average of ($1,400 + $700) 2 = $1,050. The Chicago client is allocated $1,100 as the primary party and $400 as the incremental party for an average of ($1,100 + 400) 2 = $750. The Shapley value approach would allocate $1,050 to the Baltimore client and $750 to the Chicago client.
15-16
2. I would recommend Gunn use the Shapley value. It is fairer than the incremental method because it avoids considering one party as the primary party and allocating more of the common costs to that party. It also avoids disputes about who is the primary party. It allocates costs in a manner that is close to the costs allocated under the stand-alone method but takes a more comprehensive view of the common cost allocation problem by considering primary and incremental users, which the stand-alone method ignores. The Shapley value (or the stand-alone cost allocation method) would be the preferred methods if Gunn was to send the travel expenses to the Baltimore and Chicago clients before deciding which engagement to accept. Other factors such as whether to charge the Chicago client more because Gunn is accepting the Chicago engagement or the Baltimore client more because Gunn is not going to work for them can be considered if Gunn sends in her travel expenses after making her decision. However, each company would not want to be considered as the primary party and so is likely to object to these arguments. 3. A simple approach is to split the $60 equally between the two clients. The limousine costs at the Sacramento end are not a function of distance traveled on the plane. An alternative approach is to add the $60 to the $1,800 and repeat requirement 1: a. Stand-alone cost allocation method. $1, 460 Baltimore client $1,860 = $1,036 $1, 460 $1,160 Chicago client $1,160 $1,860 = $ 824 $1, 460 $1,160 
b. Incremental cost allocation method. With Baltimore client as the primary party: Baltimore client $1,460 Chicago client 400 $1,860 With Chicago client as the primary party: Chicago client $1,160 Baltimore client 700 $1,860 c. Shapley value. Baltimore client: Chicago client:
($1,460 + $700) 2 = $1,080 ($400 + $1,160) 2 = $ 780
As discussed in requirement 2, the Shapley value or the stand-alone cost allocation method would probably be the preferred approaches.
Note: If any students in the class have faced this situation when visiting prospective employers, ask them how they handled it.

15-25 (20 min.) Revenue allocation, bundled products. 1a. Under the stand alone revenue-allocation method based on selling price, Monaco will be allocated 40% of all revenues, or $72 of the bundled selling price, and Innocence will be allocated 60% of all revenues, or $108 of the bundled selling price, as shown below. Stand-alone method, based on selling prices Selling price Selling price as a % of total ($80 $200; $120 $200) Allocation of $180 bundled selling price (40% $180; 60% $180) Monaco Innocence $80 $120 40% $72 60% $108 Total $200 100% $180
1b. Under the incremental revenue-allocation method, with Monaco ranked as the primary product, Monaco will be allocated $80 (its own stand-alone selling price) and Innocence will be allocated $100 of the $180 selling price, as shown below. Incremental Method (Monaco rank 1) Selling price Allocation of $180 bundled selling price ($80; $100 = $180 $80)
Monaco Innocence $80 $120 $80 $100
1c. Under the incremental revenue-allocation method, with Innocence ranked as the primary product, Innocence will be allocated $120 (its own stand-alone selling price) and Monaco will be allocated $60 of the $180 selling price, as shown below. Incremental Method (Innocence rank 1) Selling price Allocation of $180 bundled selling price ($60 = $180 $120; $120)
Monaco Innocence $80 $120 $60 $120
1d. Under the Shapley value method, each product will be allocated the average of its allocations in 1b and 1c, i.e., the average of its allocations when it is the primary product and when it is the secondary product, as shown below. Shapley Value Method Allocation when Monaco = Rank 1; Innocence = Rank 2 (from 1b.) Allocation when Innocence = Rank 1; Monaco = Rank 2 (from 1c.) Average of allocated selling price ($80 + $60) 2; ($100 + $120) 2 Monaco Innocence $80 $60 $70 $100 $120 $110
15-18
2.
A summary of the allocations based on the four methods in requirement 1 is shown below. Stand-alone (Selling Prices) Monaco $ 72 Innocence 108 Total for LAmour $180 Incremental (Monaco first) $ 80 100 $180 Incremental (Innocence first) $ 60 120 $180
Shapley $ 70 110 $180
If there is no clear indication of which product is the more important product, or, if it can be reasonably assumed that the two products are equally important to the company&apos;s strategy, the Shapley value method is the fairest of all the methods because it averages the effect of product rank. In this particular case, note that the allocations from the stand-alone method based on selling price are reasonably similar to the allocations from the Shapley value method, so the managers at Yves may well want to use the much simpler stand-alone method. The stand-alone method also does not require ranking the products in the suite, and so it is less likely to cause debates among product managers in the Men&apos;s and Women&apos;s Fragrance divisions. If, however, one of the products (Monaco or Innocence) is clearly the product that is driving sales of the bundled product, then that product should be considered as the primary product. 15-26 (10-15 min. ) Allocation of Common Costs 1. a. Stand-alone method (costs are in thousands): Separate Cost $2,100 1,400 3,500 $7,000 Joint Cost $5,000 5,000 5,000

1. b. Incremental method (cities ranked in order of most waste to least waste): Allocated Cost $3,500 1,500 0 Cost Remaining to Allocate $1,500 ($5,000 $3,500) 0 ($1,500 $1,500) 0
Schenectady Albany Troy
2. In this situation, the stand-alone method is the better method because the weights it uses for allocation are based on the cost for each user as a separate entity. The citizens of Schenectady would not consider the incremental method fair because they would be subsidizing the other cities (especially Troy). Albany is indifferent across the two methods; its citizens save $600,000 over the stand-alone cost in either case. While the citizens of Troy would clearly prefer the incremental allocation method and might seek to justify it because they generate the least amount of waste, they should understand that citizens of the other cities would believe it is not fair.

The dual-rate method has two major advantages over the single-rate method: a. Fixed costs and variable costs can be allocated differentlyfixed costs based on rates calculated using practical capacity and budgeted usage and variable costs based on budgeted rates and actual usage. b. Fixed costs are allocated proportionately to the departments causing the incurrence of those costs based on the capacity of each department. c. The costs allocated to a department are not affected by the usage by other departments.
Note: If capacity costs are the result of a long-term decision by top management, it may be desirable to allocate to each department the cost of capacity used based on actual usage. The users are then not allocated the costs of unused capacity.

For each DVD package, the stand-alone method and the Shapley method give approximately the same allocation to each DVD. These methods are fair if the demand for the DVDs are approximately equal. The stand-alone method might be slightly preferable here since it is simpler and easier to explain. The incremental method would be appropriate if one DVD has a higher level of demand than the other DVD. In this situation, the dominant DVD would be sold anyway so it should receive its stand-alone revenue, and the other DVD should receive the remainder.

2. If the practical capacity refers to the number of parking spots that are earmarked or reserved for each of the restaurants, then it would appear to be the most appropriate basis for allocating the $10,000 common cost. This ratio is a stable benchmark and does not fluctuate based on variations in either the actual or planned monthly usage of spots for each of the restaurants, which is an issue with each of the other two methods. Moreover, the practical capacity taken by each restaurant presumably reflects the restaurants expectation of the long-run usage of the parking facility by its patrons. The cost of any unused capacity then highlights the extent to which these expectations are not met, and might lead to the restaurant settling for a smaller parking facility in the future. Of course, if it is ever the case that the expected or actual usage for any restaurant exceeds the practical capacity that it has booked, it would need to suitably compensate the other restaurants for the portion of their parking capacity it has appropriated.

The direct method results in a lower amount of support departments costs being allocated to the Machining Department than the step-down method. This is clear from a comparison of the overhead rate, per direct manufacturing labor-hour, for the Machining Department under the two methods.

2. At first glance, it appears that the cost of power is $40 per unit plus the material handling costs. If so, Manes would be better off by purchasing from the power company. However, the decision should be influenced by the effects of the interdependencies and the fixed costs. Note that the power needs would be less (students frequently miss this) if they were purchased from the outside: Outside Power Units Needed Needed 100 400
X Y A (500 units minus 20% of 500 units, because there is no need to service the nonexistent power department) Total units Total costs, 900 $40 = $36,000
400 900
In contrast, the total costs that would be saved by not producing the power inside would depend on the effects of the decision on various costs: Avoidable Costs of 1,000 Units of Power Produced Inside Variable indirect labor and indirect material costs Supervision in power department Materials handling, 20% of $70,000* Probable minimum cost savings Possible additional savings: a. Can any supervision in materials handling be saved because of overseeing less volume? Minimum savings is probably zero; the maximum is probably 20% of $10,000 or $2,000. b. Is any depreciation a truly variable, wear-and-tear type of cost? Total savings by not producing 1,000 units of power
* Materials handling costs are higher because the power department uses 20% of materials handling. Therefore, materials-handling costs will decrease by 20%.

3. To use the Shapley value method, consider each party as first the primary party and then the incremental party. Compute the average of the two to determine the allocation. Wright, Inc.: Allocation as the primary party Allocation as the incremental party Total Allocation ($60,000 2) Brown, Inc.: Allocation as the primary party Allocation as the incremental party Total Allocation ($36,000 2)
$36,000 24,000 $60,000 $30,000
$24,000 12,000 $36,000 $18,000
Using this approach, Wright, Inc. is allocated $30,000 and Brown, Inc. is allocated $18,000 of the total costs of $48,000.

The results of the four cost-allocation methods are shown below. Wright, Inc. $28,800 36,000 24,000 30,000 Brown, Inc. $19,200 12,000 24,000 18,000
Stand-alone method Incremental (Wright primary) Incremental (Brown primary) Shapley value
The allocations are very sensitive to the method used. The stand-alone method is simple and fair since it allocates the common cost of the dyeing machine in proportion to the individual costs of leasing the machine. The Shapley values are also fair. They result in very similar allocations and any one of them can be chosen. In this case, the stand-alone method is likely more acceptable. If they used the incremental cost-allocation method, Wright, Inc. and Brown, Inc. would probably have disputes over who is the primary party because the primary party gets allocated all of the primary partys costs.

4. Sharing on the basis of revenue makes the most sense, especially if the ticket price is somewhat a surrogate for demand. One could argue that since each ticket gives the entrant one full day in each park, then an entrants willingness to pay more for a particular park reflects the additional value placed on that park. Also, it would be hard to justify the Animal park receiving almost its full ticket price using the cost basis and more than its ticket price using the # of tickets basis.
15-33
15-34 (10-15 min.) Effect of demand (continuation of 15-33) 1. If the Water park receives its full ticket price of $40, then the remaining proceeds from the sale of the three day ticket, $90 40 = $50, would be divided between the two remaining parks. Using ticket price as the basis of allocation, each park would receive: Percentage of Total Price 0.750 0.250 Allocation % $50 $37.50 12.50 $50.00
Park Superhero Theme Animal Total
Ticket Price $60 20 $80
The same process would be used for the other two allocation bases. Under the cost basis, the 25 Superhero Theme park receives $50 = $35.71, while Animal park gets the other $14.29. 25+10 If revenue is assigned based on the number of tickets received, then the Superhero Theme and Animal Parks would each receive $25. 2. If the Superhero Theme park also demanded its full ticket price then it would want to receive $60. The two parks, Water and Superhero Theme, would then receive a combined amount of $40 + 60 = $100. Since the three-day ticket sells for only $90, this would not be possible. In addition, the Animal park director would not be pleased because he would incur a $10 cost for each entrant but receive no proceeds from the ticket. 3. If both the Water and the Superhero Theme parks are really operating at capacity then Funland is losing money by selling the three-day ticket for $90. Kent Clark should either raise the price or decide not to sell the three-day ticket. Alternatively, if he wishes to persist with the current arrangement, he should use a more sophisticated arrangement for allocating revenue, such as the Shapley method or even the weighted Shapley method. In the latter case, Kent could assign the number of months each park is considered the primary park as the weighting scheme. For example, while the Water Park may drive sales of the three-day ticket during summer months, customers may be more interested in one of the other parks during cooler periods.

2.
The pros of the stand-alone-revenue-allocation method include the following: a. Each item in the bundle receives a positive weight, which means the resulting allocations are more likely to be accepted by all parties than a method allocating zero revenues to one or more products. b. It uses market-based evidence (unit selling prices) to decide the revenue allocationsunit prices are one indicator of benefits received . c. It is simple to implement. The cons of the stand-alone revenue-allocation method include: a. It ignores the relative importance of the individual components in attracting consumers to purchase the bundle. b. It ignores the opportunity cost of the individual components in the bundle. The golf course operates at 100% capacity. Getaway participants must reserve a golf booking one week in advance, or else they are not guaranteed playing time. A getaway participant who does not use the golf option may not displace anyone. Thus, under the stand-alone method, the golf course may be paid twiceonce from the non-getaway person who does play and second from an allocation of the $1,000 package amount for the getaway person who does not play (either did not want to play or wanted to play but made a booking too late, or failed to show). c. The weight can be artificially inflated by individual product managers setting high list unit prices and then being willing to frequently discount these prices. The use of actual unit prices or actual revenues per product in the stand-alone formula will reduce this problem. d. The weights may change frequently if unit prices are constantly changing. This is not so much a criticism as a reflection that the marketplace may be highly competitive. The pros of the incremental method include: a. It has the potential to reflect that some products in the bundle are more highly valued than others. Not all products in the bundle have a similar write-down from unit list prices. Ensuring this potential pro becomes an actual pro requires that the choice of the primary product be guided by reliable evidence on consumer preferences. This is not an easy task. b. Once the sequence is chosen, it is straightforward to implement. The cons of the incremental method include: a. Obtaining the rankings can be highly contentious and place managers in a no-win acrimonious debate. The revenue allocations can be sensitive to the chosen rankings. b. Some products will have zero revenues assigned to them. Consider the Food division. It would incur the costs for the two dinners but receive no revenue.

CHAPTER 16 COST ALLOCATION: JOINT PRODUCTS AND BYPRODUCTS 16-1 Exhibit 16-1 presents many examples of joint products from four different general industries. These include: Industry Separable Products at the Splitoff Point Food Processing: Lamb Lamb cuts, tripe, hides, bones, fat Turkey Breasts, wings, thighs, poultry meal Extractive: Petroleum
 Crude oil, natural gas
16-2 A joint cost is a cost of a production process that yields multiple products simultaneously. A separable cost is a cost incurred beyond the splitoff point that is assignable to each of the specific products identified at the splitoff point. 16-3 The distinction between a joint product and a byproduct is based on relative sales value. A joint product is a product from a joint production process (a process that yields two or more products) that has a relatively high total sales value. A byproduct is a product that has a relatively low total sales value compared to the total sales value of the joint (or main) products. 16-4 A product is any output that has a positive sales value (or an output that enables a company to avoid incurring costs). In some joint-cost settings, outputs can occur that do not have a positive sales value. The offshore processing of hydrocarbons yields water that is recycled back into the ocean as well as yielding oil and gas. The processing of mineral ore to yield gold and silver also yields dirt as an output, which is recycled back into the ground. 16-5 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. The chapter lists the following six reasons for allocating joint costs: Computation of inventoriable costs and cost of goods sold for financial accounting purposes and reports for income tax authorities. Computation of inventoriable costs and cost of goods sold for internal reporting purposes. Cost reimbursement under contracts when only a portion of a business&apos;s products or services is sold or delivered under cost-plus contracts. Insurance settlement computations for damage claims made on the basis of cost information of joint products or byproducts. Rate regulation when one or more of the jointly-produced products or services are subject to price regulation. Litigation in which costs of joint products are key inputs.
16-6 The joint production process yields individual products that are either sold this period or held as inventory to be sold in subsequent periods. Hence, the joint costs need to be allocated between total production rather than just those sold this period. 16-7 This situation can occur when a production process yields separable outputs at the splitoff point that do not have selling prices available until further processing. The result is that selling prices are not available at the splitoff point to use the sales value at splitoff method. Examples include processing in integrated pulp and paper companies and in petro-chemical operations. 16-1
16-8 Both methods use market selling-price data in allocating joint costs, but they differ in which sales-price data they use. The sales value at splitoff method allocates joint costs to joint products on the basis of the relative total sales value at the splitoff point of the total production of these products during the accounting period. The net realizable value method allocates joint costs to joint products on the basis of the relative net realizable value (the final sales value minus the separable costs of production and marketing) of the total production of the joint products during the accounting period. 16-9 Limitations of the physical measure method of joint-cost allocation include: a. The physical weights used for allocating joint costs may have no relationship to the revenue-producing power of the individual products. b. The joint products may not have a common physical denominatorfor example, one may be a liquid while another a solid with no readily available conversion factor.
16-10 The NRV method can be simplified by assuming (a) a standard set of post-splitoff point processing steps, and (b) a standard set of selling prices. The use of (a) and (b) achieves the same benefits that the use of standard costs does in costing systems. 16-11 The constant gross-margin percentage NRV method takes account of the post-splitoff point profit contribution earned on individual products, as well as joint costs, when making cost assignments to joint products. In contrast, the sales value at splitoff point and the NRV methods allocate only the joint costs to the individual products. 16-12 No. Any method used to allocate joint costs to individual products that is applicable to the problem of joint product-cost allocation should not be used for management decisions regarding whether a product should be sold or processed further. When a product is an inherent result of a joint process, the decision to process further should not be influenced by either the size of the total joint costs or by the portion of the joint costs assigned to particular products. Joint costs are irrelevant for these decisions. The only relevant items for these decisions are the incremental revenue and the incremental costs beyond the splitoff point. 16-13 No. The only relevant items are incremental revenues and incremental costs when making decisions about selling products at the splitoff point or processing them further. Separable costs are not always identical to incremental costs. Separable costs are costs incurred beyond the splitoff point that are assignable to individual products. Some separable costs may not be incremental costs in a specific setting (e.g., allocated manufacturing overhead for postsplitoff processing that includes depreciation). 16-14 Two methods to account for byproducts are: a. Production methodrecognizes byproducts in the financial statements at the time production is completed. b. Sales methoddelays recognition of byproducts until the time of sale. 16-15 The sales byproduct method enables a manager to time the sale of byproducts to affect reported operating income. A manager who was below the targeted operating income could adopt a fire-sale approach to selling byproducts so that the reported operating income exceeds the target. This illustrates one dysfunctional aspect of the sales method for byproducts. 16-2

2. The sales-value at splitoff method captures the benefits-received criterion of cost allocation and is the preferred method. The costs of processing a chicken are allocated to products in proportion to the ability to contribute revenue. Quality Chickens decision to process chicken is heavily influenced by the revenues from breasts and thighs. The bones provide relatively few benefits to Quality Chicken despite their high physical volume. The physical measures method shows profits on breasts and thighs and losses on bones and feathers. Given that Quality Chicken has to jointly process all the chicken products, it is nonintuitive to single out individual products that are being processed simultaneously as making losses while the overall operations make a profit. Quality Chicken is processing chicken mainly for breasts and thighs and not for wings, bones, and feathers, while the physical measure method allocates a disproportionate amount of costs to wings, bones and feathers. 16-17 (10 min.)

3. Treating all products as joint products does not require judgments as to whether a product is a joint product or a byproduct. Joint costs are allocated in a consistent manner to all products for the purpose of costing and inventory valuation. In contrast, the approach in requirement 2 lowers the joint cost by the amount of byproduct net realizable values and results in inventory values being shown for only two of the five products, the ones (perhaps arbitrarily) designated as being joint products. 16-4

3. Neither method should be used for product emphasis decisions. It is inappropriate to use joint-cost-allocated data to make decisions regarding dropping individual products, or pushing individual products, as they are joint by definition. Product-emphasis decisions should be made based on relevant revenues and relevant costs. Each method can lead to product emphasis decisions that do not lead to maximization of operating income. 4. Since crude oil is the only product subject to taxation, it is clearly in Sinclairs best interest to use the NRV method since it leads to a lower profit for crude oil and, consequently, a smaller tax burden. A letter to the taxation authorities could stress the conceptual superiority of the NRV method. Chapter 16 argues that, using a benefits-received cost allocation criterion, market-based joint cost allocation methods are preferable to physical-measure methods. A meaningful common denominator (revenues) is available when the sales value at splitoff point method or NRV method is used. The physical-measures method requires nonhomogeneous products (liquids and gases) to be converted to a common denominator.

In this (misleading) analysis, the $240,000 of joint costs are re-allocated between Special B, Special S, and the stock. Irrespective of the method of allocation, this analysis is wrong. Joint costs are always irrelevant in a process-further decision. Only incremental costs and revenues past the splitoff point are relevant. In this case, the correct analysis is much simpler: the incremental revenues from selling the stock are $20,000, and the incremental costs are the marketing costs of $10,800. So, Instant Foods should sell the stockthis will increase its operating income by $9,200 ($20,000 $10,800).

ISP should process the soy meal into cookies because it increases profit by $400 (900-500). However, they should sell the soy oil as is, without processing it into the form of Soyola, because profit will be $100 (400-300) higher if they do. Since the total joint cost is the same under both allocation methods, it is not a relevant cost to the decision to sell at splitoff or process further.

Call the attention of students to the different unit costs resulting from the two assumptions about the relative importance of Product C. The point is that costs of individual products depend heavily on which assumptions are made and which accounting methods and techniques are used. 16-26 (25 min.) Accounting for a byproduct. 1. Byproduct recognized at time of production: Joint cost = $1,500 Joint cost to be charged to main product = Joint Cost - NRV of Byproduct = $1,500 - (50 lbs. ? $1.20) = $1,440 $1440 = $3.60 per container 400 containers Inventoriable cost of byproduct = NRV = $1.20 per pound Inventoriable cost of main product = Gross Margin Calculation under Production Method Revenues Main product: Water (600/2 containers $8) Byproduct: Sea Salt Cost of goods sold Main product: Water (300 containers $3.60) Gross margin Gross-margin percentage ($1,320 $2,400) Inventoriable costs (end of period): Main product: Water (100 containers $3.60) = $360 Byproduct: Sea Salt (10 pounds $1.20) = $12

The production method recognizes the byproduct cost as inventory in the period it is produced. This method sets the cost of the byproduct inventory equal to its net realizable value. When the byproduct is sold, inventory is reduced without being expensed through the income statement. The sales method associates all of the production cost with the main product. Under this method, the byproduct has no inventoriable cost and is recognized only when it is sold.

3. Assuming Sonimad Sawmill, Inc., announces that in six months it will sell the rough-cut product at splitoff due to increasing competitive pressure, behavior that may be demonstrated by the skilled labor in the planing and sizing process include the following: lower quality, reduced motivation and morale, and job insecurity, leading to nonproductive employee time looking for jobs elsewhere.
Management actions that could improve this behavior include the following: Improve communication by giving the workers a more comprehensive explanation as to the reason for the change so they can better understand the situation and bring out a plan for future operation of the rest of the plant. The company can offer incentive bonuses to maintain quality and production and align rewards with goals. The company could provide job relocation and internal job transfers.

Advantages and disadvantages:
- Physical-Measure Advantage: Low information needs. Only knowledge of joint cost and physical distribution is needed. Disadvantage: Allocation is unrelated to the revenue-generating ability of products. - Sales Value at Splitoff Advantage: Considers market value of products as basis for allocating joint cost. Relative sales value serves as a proxy for relative benefit received by each product from the joint cost. Disadvantage: Uses selling price at the time of splitoff even if product is not sold by the firm in that form. Selling price may not exist for product at splitoff. - Net Realizable Value Advantages: Allocates joint costs using ultimate net value of each product; applicable when the option to process further exists Disadvantages: High information needs; Makes assumptions about expected outcomes of future processing decisions - Constant Gross-Margin percentage method Advantage: Since it is necessary to produce all joint products, they all look equally profitable. Disadvantages: High information needs. All products are not necessarily equally profitable; method may lead to negative cost allocations so that unprofitable products are subsidized by profitable ones. 3. When selling prices for all products exist at splitoff, the sales value at split off method is the preferred technique. It is a relatively simple technique that depends on a common basis for cost allocation revenues. It is better than the physical method because it considers the relative market values of the products generated by the joint cost when seeking to allocate it (which is a surrogate for the benefits received by each product from the joint cost). Further, the sales value at splitoff method has advantages over the NRV method and the constant gross margin percentage method because it does not penalize managers by charging more for developing profitable products using the output at splitoff, and it requires no assumptions about future processing activities and selling prices.

16-31 (10 min.) Further processing decision (continuation of 16-30). 1.and 2. The decision about which combination of products to produce is not affected by the method of joint cost allocation. For both the sales value at splitoff and physical measure methods, the relevant comparisons are as shown below: Butter $20,000 a 45,000 c $25,000 Buttermilk $30,000 b 26,000 d $(4,000)

10,000 lbs $2 = $20,000 20,000 qts $1.5 = $30,000 c 20,000 tubs $2.5 10,000lbs $.5 = $45,000 d 40,000 pints $.9 40,000 pints $.25 = $26,000 To maximize profits, Elsie should process butter further into spreadable butter. However, Elsie should sell the buttermilk at the splitoff point in quart containers. The extra cost to convert to pint containers ($0.25 per pint 2 pints per quart = $0.50 per quart) exceeds the increase in selling price ($0.90 per pint 2 pints per quart = $1.80 per quart $1.50 original price = $0.30 per quart) and leads to a loss of $4,000. 3. The decision to sell a product at split off or to process it further should have nothing to do with the allocation method chosen. For each product, you need to compare the revenue from selling the product at split off to the NRV from processing the product further. Other things being equal, management should choose the higher alternative. The total joint cost is the same regardless of the alternative chosen and is therefore irrelevant to the decision.

Since the entire production is sold during the period, the overall gross margin is the same under the production and sales methods. In particular, under the sales method, the $3,000 received from the sale of the coal tar is added to the overall revenues, so that Cumberlands overall gross margin is $57,000, as in the production method. 3. The production method of accounting for the byproduct is only appropriate if Cumberland is positive they can sell the byproduct and positive of the selling price. Moreover, Cumberland should view the byproducts contribution to the firm as material enough to find it worthwhile to record and track any inventory that may arise. The sales method is appropriate if either the disposition of the byproduct is unsure or the selling price is unknown, or if the amounts involved are so negligible as to make it economically infeasible for Cumberland to keep track of byproduct inventories.

16-34 (40 min.) Process further or sell, byproduct. 1. The analysis shown below indicates that it would be more profitable for Newcastle Mining Company to continue to sell bulk raw coal without further processing. This analysis ignores any value related to coal fines. It also assumes that the costs of loading and shipping the bulk raw coal on river barges will be the same whether Newcastle sells the bulk raw coal directly or processes it further. Incremental sales revenues: Sales revenue after further processing (9,400,000a tons $36) Sales revenue from bulk raw coal (10,000,000 tons $27) Incremental sales revenue Incremental costs: Direct labor Supervisory personnel Heavy equipment costs ($25,000 12 months) Sizing and cleaning (10,000,000 tons $3.50) Outbound rail freight (9,400,000 tons 60 tons) $240 per car Incremental costs Incremental gain (loss)

2. The cost of producing the raw coal is irrelevant to the decision to process further or not. As we see from requirement 1, the cost of producing raw coal does not enter any of the calculations related to either the incremental revenues or the incremental costs of further processing. The answer would the same as in requirement 1: do not process further. 3. The analysis shown below indicates that the potential revenue from the coal fines byproduct would result in additional revenue, ranging between $4,950,000 and $9,900,000, depending on the market price of the fines. Coal fines = = = 75% of 6% of raw bulk tonnage 0.75 (10,000,000 .06) 450,000 tons
Potential incremental income from preparing and selling the coal fines: Minimum $11 ($15 $4) $4,950,000 Maximum $22 ($24 $2) $9,900,000
Incremental income per ton (Market price Incremental costs) Incremental income ($11; $22 450,000)
The incremental loss from sizing and cleaning the raw coal is $5,500,000, as calculated in requirement 1. Analysis indicates that relative to selling bulk raw coal, the effect of further processing and selling coal fines is only slightly negative at the minimum incremental gain
16-35
($4,950,000 $5,500,000 = $550,000) and very beneficial at the maximum incremental gain ($9,900,000 $5,500,000 = $4,400,000). NMC will benefit from further processing and selling the coal fines as long as its incremental income per ton of coal fines is at least $12.22 ($5,500,000 450,000 tons). Hence, further processing is preferred. Note that other than the financial implications, some factors that should be considered in evaluating a sell-or-process-further decision include: Stability of the current customer market for raw coal and how it compares to the market for sized and cleaned coal. Storage space needed for the coal fines until they are sold and the handling costs of coal fines. Reliability of cost (e.g., rail freight rates) and revenue estimates, and the risk of depending on these estimates. Timing of the revenue stream from coal fines and impact on the need for liquidity. Possible environmental problems, i.e., dumping of waste and smoke from unprocessed coal. 16-35 (30 min.) Accounting for a byproduct. 1.

Collaborative Learning Problem 16-36 (60 min.) Joint Cost Allocation 1. (a) The Net Realizable Value Method allocates joint costs on the basis of the relative net realizable value (final sales value minus the separable costs of production and marketing). Joint costs would be allocated as follows: Deluxe Module $25,000 1,500 $23,500 0.7581 $18,194 $19,694 $ 39.39 Standard Module $ 8,500 1,000 $ 7,500 0.2419 $ 5,806 $ 6,806 $ 13.61 Total $33,500 2,500 $31,000 $24,000 $26,500
Final sales value of total production Deduct separable costs Net realizable value at splitoff point Weighting ($23,500; $7,500 $31,000) Joint costs allocated (0.7581; 0.2419 $24,000) Total production costs ($18,194 + $1,500; $5,806 + $1,000) Production costs per unit ($19,694; $6,806 500 units)
(b) The constant gross margin percentage NRV method allocates joint costs in such a way that the overall gross margin percentage is identical for all individual products as follows:
Step 1
Final sales value of total production: (Deluxe, $25,000; Standard, $8,500) Deduct joint and separable costs (Joint, $24,000 + Separable Deluxe, $1,500 + Separable Standard, $1,000) Gross margin Gross margin percentage ($7,000 $33,500) $33,500 26,500 $ 7,000 20.8955%
Step 2
Deluxe Module $25,000 5,224 19,776 Standard Module $8,500 1,776 6,724 Total $33,500 7,000 26,500
Final sales value of total production Deduct gross margin using overall gross margin percentage (20.8955%) Total production costs
Step 3
Deduct separable costs Joint costs allocated 1,500 $18,276 1,000 $5,724 2,500 $24,000

Production costs per unit ($19,776; $6,724 500 units)
$ 39.55
$13.45
(c) The physical measure method allocates joint costs on the basis of the relative proportions of total production at the splitoff point, using a common physical measure such as the number of bits produced for each type of module. Allocation on the basis of the number of bits produced for each type of module follows: Deluxe Module/ Chips Physical measure of total production (bits) Weighting (500,000; 250,000 750,000) Joint costs allocated (0.6667; 0.3333 $24,000) Total production costs ($16,000 + $1,500; $8,000 + $1,000) Production costs per unit ($17,500; $9,000 500 units) 500,000 0.6667 $16,000 $17,500 $ 35.00 Standard Module/ Chips 250,000 0.3333 $ 8,000 $ 9,000 $18.00
Total 750,000 $24,000 $26,500
Each of the methods for allocating joint costs has weaknesses. Because the costs are joint in nature, managers cannot use the cause and effect criterion in making this choice. Managers cannot be sure what causes the joint costs attributable to individual products. The net realizable value (NRV) method (or sales value at splitoff method) is widely used when selling price data are available. The NRV method provides a meaningful common denominator to compute the weighting factors. It allocates costs on the ability-to-pay principle. It is probably preferred to the constant gross margin percentage method which also uses sales values to allocate costs to products. Thats because the constant gross margin percentage method makes the further tenuous assumption that all products have the same ratio of cost to sales value. The physical measure method bears little relationship to the revenue producing power of the individual products. Several physical measures could be used such as the number of chips and the number of good bits. In each case, the physical measure only relates to one aspect of the chip that contributes to its value. The value of the module as determined by the marketplace is a function of multiple physical features. Another key question is whether the physical measure chosen portrays the amount of joint resources used by each product. It is possible that the resources required by each type of module depend on the number of good bits produced during chip manufacturing. But this cause-and-effect relationship is hard to establish. MMC should use the NRV method. But the choice of method should have no effect on their current control and measurement systems. 2. The correct approach in deciding whether to process further and make DRAM modules from the standard modules is to compare the incremental revenue with the incremental costs:
16-40
Incremental revenue from making DRAMs ($26 400) ($17 500) Incremental costs of DRAMs, further processing Incremental operating income from converting standard modules into DRAMs A total income computation of each alternative follows: Alternative 1: Sell Deluxe and Standard Total revenues ($25,000 + $8,500) $33,500 Total costs 26,500 Operating income $ 7,000 Alternative 2: Sell Deluxe and DRAM ($25,000 + $10,400) $35,400 ($26,500 + $1,600) 28,100 $ 7,300
$1,900 1,600 $ 300
Difference $1,900 1,600 $ 300
It is profitable to extend processing and to incur additional costs on the standard module to convert it into a DRAM module as long as the incremental revenue exceeds incremental costs. The amount of joint costs incurred up to splitoff ($24,000)and how these joint costs are allocated to each of the productsare irrelevant to the decision of whether to process further and make DRAMS. Thats because the joint costs of $24,000 remain the same whether or not further processing is done on the standard modules. Joint cost allocations using the physical measure method (on the basis of the number of bits) may mislead MMC, if MMC uses unit cost data to guide the choice between selling standard modules versus selling DRAM modules. In requirement 2, allocating joint costs on the basis of the number of good bits yielded a cost of $16,000 for the Deluxe modules and $8,000 for the Standard modules. A product line income statement for the alternatives of selling Deluxe modules and DRAM modules would appear as follows: Deluxe Module Revenues Cost of goods sold Joint costs allocated Separable costs Total cost of goods sold Gross margin $25,000 16,000 1,500 17,500 $ 7,500 DRAM Module $10,400 8,000 2,600* 10,600 $ (200)
*Separable costs of $1,000 to manufacture the Standard module and further separable costs of $1,600 to manufacture the DRAM module.
This product line income statement would erroneously imply that MMC would suffer a loss by selling DRAMs, and as a result, it would suggest that MMC should not process further to make and sell DRAMs. This occurs because of the way the joint costs are allocated to the two products. As mentioned earlier, the joint cost allocation is irrelevant to the decision. On the
16-41
basis of the incremental revenues and incremental costs, MMC should process the Standard modules into DRAM modules.

CHAPTER 17 PROCESS COSTING 17-1 Industries using process costing in their manufacturing area include chemical processing, oil refining, pharmaceuticals, plastics, brick and tile manufacturing, semiconductor chips, beverages, and breakfast cereals. 17-2 Process costing systems separate costs into cost categories according to the timing of when costs are introduced into the process. Often, only two cost classifications, direct materials and conversion costs, are necessary. Direct materials are frequently added at one point in time, often the start or the end of the process, and all conversion costs are added at about the same time, but in a pattern different from direct materials costs. 17-3 Equivalent units is a derived amount of output units that takes the quantity of each input (factor of production) in units completed or in incomplete units in work in process, and converts the quantity of input into the amount of completed output units that could be made with that quantity of input. Each equivalent unit is comprised of the physical quantities of direct materials or conversion costs inputs necessary to produce output of one fully completed unit. Equivalent unit measures are necessary since all physical units are not completed to the same extent at the same time. 17-4 The accuracy of the estimates of completion depends on the care and skill of the estimator and the nature of the process. Semiconductor chips may differ substantially in the finishing necessary to obtain a final product. The amount of work necessary to finish a product may not always be easy to ascertain in advance. 17-5 The five key steps in process costing follow: Step 1: Summarize the flow of physical units of output. Step 2: Compute output in terms of equivalent units. Step 3: Summarize total costs to account for. Step 4: Compute cost per equivalent unit. Step 5: Assign total costs to units completed and to units in ending work in process. 17-6 Three inventory methods associated with process costing are: Weighted average. First-in, first-out. Standard costing.
17-7 The weighted-average process-costing method calculates the equivalent-unit cost of all the work done to date (regardless of the accounting period in which it was done), assigns this cost to equivalent units completed and transferred out of the process, and to equivalent units in ending work-in-process inventory.
17-
17-8 FIFO computations are distinctive because they assign the cost of the previous accounting periods equivalent units in beginning work-in-process inventory to the first units completed and transferred out of the process and assigns the cost of equivalent units worked on during the current period first to complete beginning inventory, next to start and complete new units, and finally to units in ending work-in-process inventory. In contrast, the weighted-average method costs units completed and transferred out and in ending work in process at the same average cost. 17-9 FIFO should be called a modified or departmental FIFO method because the goods transferred in during a given period usually bear a single average unit cost (rather than a distinct FIFO cost for each unit transferred in) as a matter of convenience. 17-10 A major advantage of FIFO is that managers can judge the performance in the current period independently from the performance in the preceding period. 17-11 The journal entries in process costing are basically similar to those made in job-costing systems. The main difference is that, in process costing, there is often more than one work-inprocess accountone for each process. 17-12 Standard-cost procedures are particularly appropriate to process-costing systems where there are various combinations of materials and operations used to make a wide variety of similar products as in the textiles, paints, and ceramics industries. Standard-cost procedures also avoid the intricacies involved in detailed tracking with weighted-average or FIFO methods when there are frequent price variations over time. 17-13 There are two reasons why the accountant should distinguish between transferred-in costs and additional direct materials costs for a particular department: (a) All direct materials may not be added at the beginning of the department process. (b) The control methods and responsibilities may be different for transferred-in items and materials added in the department. 17-14 No. Transferred-in costs or previous department costs are costs incurred in a previous department that have been charged to a subsequent department. These costs may be costs incurred in that previous department during this accounting period or a preceding accounting period. 17-15 Materials are only one cost item. Other items (often included in a conversion costs pool) include labor, energy, and maintenance. If the costs of these items vary over time, this variability can cause a difference in cost of goods sold and inventory amounts when the weighted-average or FIFO methods are used. A second factor is the amount of inventory on hand at the beginning or end of an accounting period. The smaller the amount of production held in beginning or ending inventory relative to the total number of units transferred out, the smaller the effect on operating income, cost of goods sold, or inventory amounts from the use of weighted-average or FIFO methods.

3. The difference in the Assembly Department cost per unit calculated in requirements 1 and 2 arises because the costs incurred in January and February are the same but fewer equivalent units of work are done in February relative to January. In January, all 10,000 units introduced are fully completed resulting in 10,000 equivalent units of work done with respect to direct materials and conversion costs. In February, of the 10,000 units introduced, 10,000 equivalent units of work is done with respect to direct materials but only 9,500 equivalent units of work is done with respect to conversion costs. The Assembly Department cost per unit is, therefore, higher.

17-29 (15-20 min.) Standard-costing method. 1. Since there was no additional work needed on the beginning inventory with respect to materials, the initial mulch must have been 100% complete with respect to materials. For conversion costs, the work done to complete the opening inventory was 434,250 965,000 = 45%. Therefore, the unfinished mulch in opening inventory must have been 55% complete with respect to conversion costs. 2. It is clear that the ending WIP is also 100% complete with respect to direct materials (1,817,000 1,817,000), and it is 60% (= 1,090,200 1,817,000) complete with regard to conversion costs. 3. We can first obtain the total standard costs per unit. The number of units started and completed during August is 845,000, and a total cost of $6,717,750 is attached to them. The per unit standard cost is therefore ($6,717,750 845,000) = $7.95. If x and y represent the per unit cost for direct materials and conversion costs, respectively, we therefore know that: x + y = 7.95 We also know that the ending inventory is costed at $12,192,070 and contains 1,817,000 equivalent units of materials and 1,090,200 equivalent units of conversion costs. This provides a second equation: 1,817,000 x + 1,090,200 y = 12,192,070. Solving these equations reveals that the direct materials cost per unit, x, is $4.85, while the conversion cost per unit, y, is $3.10. 4. Finally, the opening WIP contained 965,000 equivalent units of materials and (965,000434,250) = 530,750 equivalent units of conversion costs. Applying the standard costs computed in step (3), the cost of the opening inventory must have been: 965,000 $4.85 + 530,750 $3.10 = $6,325,575.

Exhibit 17-30B Solution Exhibit 17-32B
The cost per equivalent unit differs between the two methods because each method uses different costs as the numerator of the calculation. FIFO uses only the costs added during the current period whereas weighted-average uses the costs from the beginning work-in-process as well as costs added during the current period. Both methods also use different equivalent units in the denominator. The following table summarizes the costs assigned to units completed and those still in process under the weighted-average and FIFO process-costing methods for our example. Weighted Average FIFO (Solution (Solution Exhibit 17-30B) Exhibit 17-32B) Difference Cost of units completed and transferred out $7,717,500 $7,735,250 + $17,750 Work in process, ending 772,750 755,000 $17,750 Total costs accounted for $8,490,250 $8,490,250

The FIFO ending inventory is lower than the weighted-average ending inventory by $17,750. This is because FIFO assumes that all the higher-cost prior-period units in work in process are the first to be completed and transferred out while ending work in process consists of only the lower-cost current-period units. The weighted-average method, however, smoothes out cost per equivalent unit by assuming that more of the lower-cost units are completed and transferred out, while some of the higher-cost units in beginning work in process are placed in ending work in process. So, in this case, the weighted-average method results in a lower cost of units completed and transferred out and a higher ending work-in-process inventory relative to the FIFO method.

17-33 (30 min.) Transferred-in costs, weighted-average method (related to 17-30 to 17-32). 1. Transferred-in costs are 100% complete, and direct materials are 0% complete in both beginning and ending work-in-process inventory. The reason is that transferred-in costs are always 100% complete as soon as they are transferred in from the Assembly Department to the Testing Department. Direct materials in beginning or ending work in process for the Testing Department are 0% complete because direct materials are added only when the testing process is 90% complete and the units in beginning and ending work in process are only 70% and 60% complete, respectively. 2. Solution Exhibit 17-33A computes the equivalent units of work done to date in the Testing Department for transferred-in costs, direct materials, and conversion costs. 3.

17-37 (20 min.) FIFO method (continuation of 17-35). The equivalent units of work done in April 2009 in the Assembly Department for direct materials and conversion costs are shown in Solution Exhibit 17-37A. Solution Exhibit 17-37B summarizes the total Assembly Department costs for April 2009, calculates the cost per equivalent unit of work done in April 2009 in the Assembly Department for direct materials and conversion costs, and assigns these costs to units completed (and transferred out) and to units in ending work in process under the FIFO method. The equivalent units of work done in beginning inventory is: direct materials, 75 100% = 75; and conversion costs 75 40% = 30. The cost per equivalent unit of beginning inventory and of work done in the current period are: Work Done in Current Period (Calculated Under FIFO Method) $32 $22
Direct materials Conversion costs
Beginning Inventory $23.67 ($1,775 75) $4.50 ($135 30)
The following table summarizes the costs assigned to units completed and those still in process under the weighted-average and FIFO process-costing methods for our example. Weighted Average FIFO (Solution (Solution Exhibit 17-35B) Exhibit 17-37B) Difference $26,000 $25,850 $150 4,400 4,550 +$150 $30,400 $30,400
Cost of units completed and transferred out Work in process, ending Total costs accounted for
The FIFO ending inventory is higher than the weighted-average ending inventory by $150. This is because FIFO assumes that all the lower-cost prior-period units in work in process are the first to be completed and transferred out while ending work in process consists of only the higher-cost current-period units. The weighted-average method, however, smoothes out cost per equivalent unit by assuming that more of the higher-cost units are completed and transferred out, while some of the lower-cost units in beginning work in process are placed in ending work in process. Hence, in this case, the weighted-average method results in a higher cost of units completed and transferred out and a lower ending work-in-process inventory relative to the FIFO method.

The FIFO ending inventory is higher than the weighted-average ending inventory by $1,317. This is because FIFO assumes that all the lower-cost prior-period units in work in process (resulting from the lower transferred-in costs in beginning inventory) are the first to be completed and transferred out while ending work in process consists of only the higher-cost current-period units. The weighted-average method, however, smoothes out cost per equivalent unit by assuming that more of the higher-cost units are completed and transferred out, while some of the lower-cost units in beginning work in process are placed in ending work in process. Hence, in this case, the weighted-average method results in a higher cost of units completed and transferred out and a lower ending work-in-process inventory relative to FIFO. Note that the difference in cost of units completed and transferred out ($8,487) does not fully offset the difference in ending work-in-process inventory (+$1,317). This is because the FIFO and weighted-average methods result in different values for transferred-in costs with respect to both beginning inventory and costs transferred in during the period.

CHAPTER 18 SPOILAGE, REWORK, AND SCRAP 18-1 Managers have found that improved quality and intolerance for high spoilage have lowered overall costs and increased sales. 18-2 Spoilageunits of production that do not meet the standards required by customers for good units and that are discarded or sold at reduced prices. Reworkunits of production that do not meet the specifications required by customers but which are subsequently repaired and sold as good finished units. Scrapresidual material that results from manufacturing a product. It has low total sales value compared to the total sales value of the product. 18-3 Yes. Normal spoilage is spoilage inherent in a particular production process that arises even under efficient operating conditions. Management decides the spoilage rate it considers normal depending on the production process. 18-4 Abnormal spoilage is spoilage that is not inherent in a particular production process and would not arise under efficient operating conditions. Costs of abnormal spoilage are lost costs, measures of inefficiency that should be written off directly as losses for the accounting period. 18-5 Management effort can affect the spoilage rate. Many companies are relentlessly reducing their rates of normal spoilage, spurred on by competitors who, likewise, are continuously reducing costs. 18-6 Normal spoilage typically is expressed as a percentage of good units passing the inspection point. Given actual spoiled units, we infer abnormal spoilage as follows: Abnormal spoilage = Actual spoilage Normal spoilage. 18-7 Accounting for spoiled goods deals with cost assignment, rather than with cost incurrence, because the existence of spoiled goods does not involve any additional cost beyond the amount already incurred. 18-8 Yes. Normal spoilage rates should be computed from the good output or from the normal input, not the total input. Normal spoilage is a given percentage of a certain output base. This base should never include abnormal spoilage, which is included in total input. Abnormal spoilage does not vary in direct proportion to units produced, and to include it would cause the normal spoilage count to fluctuate irregularly and not vary in direct proportion to the output base. 18-9 Yes, the point of inspection is the key to the assignment of spoilage costs. Normal spoilage costs do not attach solely to units transferred out. Thus, if units in ending work in process have passed inspection, they should have normal spoilage costs added to them. 18-10 No. If abnormal spoilage is detected at a different point in the production cycle than normal spoilage, then unit costs would differ. If, however normal and abnormal spoilage are detected at the same point in the production cycle, their unit costs would be the same.
18-
18-11 No. Spoilage may be considered a normal characteristic of a given production cycle. The costs of normal spoilage caused by a random malfunction of a machine would be charged as a part of the manufacturing overhead allocated to all jobs. Normal spoilage attributable to a specific job is charged to that job. 18-12 No. Unless there are special reasons for charging normal rework to jobs that contained the bad units, the costs of extra materials, labor, and so on are usually charged to manufacturing overhead and allocated to all jobs. 18-13 Yes. Abnormal rework is a loss just like abnormal spoilage. By charging it to manufacturing overhead, the abnormal rework costs are spread over other jobs and also included in inventory to the extent a job is not complete. Abnormal rework is rework over and above what is expected during a period, and is recognized as a loss for that period. 18-14 A company is justified in inventorying scrap when its estimated net realizable value is significant and the time between storing it and selling or reusing it is quite long. 18-15 Companies measure scrap to measure efficiency and to also control a tempting source of theft. Managers of companies that report high levels of scrap focus attention on ways to reduce scrap and to use the scrap the company generates more profitably. Some companies, for example, might redesign products and processes to reduce scrap. Others may also examine if the scrap can be reused to save substantial input costs. 18-16 (510 min.) Normal and abnormal spoilage in units. 1. Total spoiled units Normal spoilage in units, 5% 132,000 Abnormal spoilage in units Abnormal spoilage, 5,400 $10 Normal spoilage, 6,600 $10 Potential savings, 12,000 $10 12,000 6,600 5,400 $ 54,000 66,000 $120,000
2.
Regardless of the targeted normal spoilage, abnormal spoilage is non-recurring and avoidable. The targeted normal spoilage rate is subject to change. Many companies have reduced their spoilage to almost zero, which would realize all potential savings. Of course, zero spoilage usually means higher-quality products, more customer satisfaction, more employee satisfaction, and various beneficial effects on nonmanufacturing (for example, purchasing) costs of direct materials.

18-22 (10 min.) Standard costing method, spoilage, journal entries. Spoilage represents the amount of resources that go into the process, but do not result in finished product. A simple way to account for spoilage in process costing is to calculate the amount of direct material that was spoiled. The journal entry to record the spoilage incurred in Aarons production process is: Manufacturing overhead control (normal spoilage) Work-in-process inventory (cost of spoiled sheet metal) 18-23 (15 min.) Recognition of loss from spoilage. 1. The unit cost of making the 10,000 units is: $209,000 10,000 units = $20.90 per unit 2. The total cost of the 500 spoiled units is: $20.90 500 units = $10,450 3. The increase in the per-unit cost of goods sold as a result of the normal spoilage is: $10,450 9,500 good units = $1.10 Unit cost of goods sold for units remaining after the spoilage = $20.90 + $1.10 = $22.00. 4. The $10,450 cost for the 500 spoiled units is taken out of manufacturing costs and expensed in the period of the spoilage. The journal entry to record the abnormal spoilage incurred is: Loss from abnormal spoilage $10,450 Work-in-process control $10,450 250 250

18-28 (15 min.) Reworked units, costs of rework. 1. The two alternative approaches to account for the materials costs of reworked units are: a. To charge the costs of rework to the current period as a separate expense item as abnormal rework. This approach would highlight to White Goods the costs of the supplier problem. b. To charge the costs of the rework to manufacturing overhead as normal rework.
2. The $50 tumbler cost is the cost of the actual tumblers included in the washing machines. The $44 tumbler units from the first supplier were eventually never used in any washing machine, and that supplier is now bankrupt. The units have now been disposed of at zero disposal value. 3. The total costs of rework due to the defective tumbler units include the following: a. the labor and other conversion costs spent on substituting the new tumbler units; b. the costs of any extra negotiations to obtain the replacement tumbler units; c. any higher price the existing supplier may have charged to do a rush order for the replacement tumbler units; and d. ordering costs for the replacement tumbler units.

18-39 (2535 min.) Weighted-average method, inspection at 80% completion (chapter appendix). The computation and allocation of spoilage is the most difficult part of this problem. The units in the ending inventory have passed inspection. Therefore, of the 100,000 units to account for (12,500 beginning + 87,500 started), 12,500 must have been spoiled in May [100,000 (62,500 completed + 25,000 ending inventory)]. Normal spoilage is 8,750 [0.10 (62,500 + 25,000)]. The 3,750 remainder is abnormal spoilage (12,500 8,750). Solution Exhibit 18-39, Panel A, calculates the equivalent units of work done for each cost category. We comment on several points in this calculation: Ending work in process includes an element of normal spoilage since all the ending WIP have passed the point of inspectioninspection occurs when production is 80% complete, while the units in ending WIP are 95% complete. Spoilage includes no direct materials units because spoiled units are detected and removed from the finishing activity when inspection occurs at the time production is 80% complete. Direct materials are added only later when production is 90% complete. Direct materials units are included for ending work in process, which is 95% complete, but not for beginning work in process, which is 25% complete. The reason is that direct materials are added when production is 90% complete. The ending work in process, therefore, contains direct materials units; the beginning work in process does not.
Solution Exhibit 18-39, Panel B, summarizes total costs to account for, computes the costs per equivalent unit for each cost category, and assigns costs to units completed (including normal spoilage), to abnormal spoilage, and to units in ending work in process using the weighted-average method. The cost of ending work in process includes the assignment of normal spoilage costs since these units have passed the point of inspection. The costs assigned to each cost category are as follows: Cost of good units completed and transferred out (including normal spoilage costs on good units) Abnormal spoilage Cost of ending work in process (including normal spoilage costs on ending work in process) Total costs assigned and accounted for

Total rework costs for CS1 chips in August 2008 are as follows: Normal rework costs allocated to CS1 Abnormal rework costs for CS1 Total rework costs $1,200 1,080 $2,280 8,800 4,800 960 3,040
1,800 600 450 750
1,080 360 270 450
1,200 600 1,800
We emphasize two points: a. Only $1,200 of the normal rework costs are allocated to CS1 even though the normal rework costs of the 50 CS1 calculators reworked equal $1,800. The reason is that the normal rework costs are not specifically attributable to CS1. For example, the machines happened to malfunction when CS1 was being made, but the rework was not caused by the specific requirements of CS1. If it were, then all $1,800 would be charged to CS1. b. Abnormal rework costs of $1,080 are linked to CS1 in the management control system even though for financial reporting purposes the abnormal rework costs are written off to the income statement.

CHAPTER 19 BALANCED SCORECARD: QUALITY, TIME, AND THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS 19-1 Quality costs (including the opportunity cost of lost sales because of poor quality) can be as much as 10% to 20% of sales revenues of many organizations. Quality-improvement programs can result in substantial cost savings and higher revenues and market share from increased customer satisfaction. 19-2 Quality of design refers to how closely the characteristics of a product or service meet the needs and wants of customers. Conformance quality refers to the performance of a product or service relative to its design and product specifications. 19-3 Exhibit 19-1 of the text lists the following six line items in the prevention costs category: design engineering; process engineering; supplier evaluations; preventive equipment maintenance; quality training; and testing of new materials. 19-4 An internal failure cost differs from an external failure cost on the basis of when the nonconforming product is detected. An internal failure is detected before a product is shipped to a customer, whereas an external failure is detected after a product is shipped to a customer. 19-5 Three methods that companies use to identify quality problems are: (a) a control chart which is a graph of a series of successive observations of a particular step, procedure, or operation taken at regular intervals of time; (b) a Pareto diagram, which is a chart that indicates how frequently each type of failure (defect) occurs, ordered from the most frequent to the least frequent; and (c) a cause-and-effect diagram, which helps identify potential causes of failure. 19-6 No, companies should emphasize financial as well as nonfinancial measures of quality, such as yield and defect rates. Nonfinancial measures are not directly linked to bottom-line performance but they indicate and direct attention to the specific areas that need improvement to improve the bottom line. Tracking nonfinancial measures over time directly reveals whether these areas have, in fact, improved over time. Nonfinancial measures are easy to quantify and easy to understand. 19-7 Examples of nonfinancial measures of customer satisfaction relating to quality include the following: 1. the number of defective units shipped to customers as a percentage of total units of product shipped; 2. the number of customer complaints; 3. delivery delays (the difference between the scheduled delivery date and date requested by customer); 4. on-time delivery rate (percentage of shipments made on or before the promised delivery date); 5. customer satisfaction level with product features (to measure design quality); 6. market share; and 7. percentage of units that fail soon after delivery.
19-
19-8 Examples of nonfinancial measures of internal-business-process quality: 1. the percentage of defects for each product line; 2. process yield (rates of good output to total output at a particular process; 3. manufacturing lead time (the amount of time from when an order is received by production to when it becomes a finished good); and 4. number of product and process design changes 19-9 Customer-response time is how long it takes from the time a customer places an order for a product or a service to the time the product or service is delivered to the customer. Manufacturing lead time is how long it takes from the time an order is received by manufacturing to the time a finished good is produced. Manufacturing lead time is only one part of customer-response time. Delays in delivering an order for a product or service can also occur because of delays in receiving customer orders and delays in delivering a completed order to a customer. Customer Order Order Order response = receipt + manufacturing + delivery time time lead time time 19-10 No. There is a trade-off between customer-response time and on-time performance. Simply scheduling longer customer-response time makes achieving on-time performance easier. Companies should, however, attempt to reduce the uncertainty of the arrival of orders, manage bottlenecks, reduce setup and processing time, and run smaller batches. This would have the effect of reducing both customer-response time and improving on-time performance. 19-11 Two reasons why lines, queues, and delays occur is (1) uncertainty about when customers will order products or servicesuncertainty causes a number of orders to be received at the same time, causing delays, and (2) limited capacity and bottlenecksa bottleneck is an operation where the work to be performed approaches or exceeds the available capacity. 19-12 No. Adding a product when capacity is constrained and the timing of customer orders is uncertain causes delays in delivering all existing products. If the revenue losses from delays in delivering existing products and the increase in carrying costs of the existing products exceed the positive contribution earned by the product that was added, then it is not worthwhile to make and sell the new product, despite its positive contribution margin. The chapter describes the negative effects (negative externalities) that one product can have on others when products share common manufacturing facilities. 19-13 The three main measures used in the theory of constraints are the following: 1. throughput contribution equal to revenues minus direct material cost of the goods sold; 2. investments equal to the sum of materials costs in direct materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventories, research and development costs, and costs of equipment and buildings; 3. operating costs equal to all costs of operations such as salaries, rent, and utilities (other than direct materials) incurred to earn throughput contribution.
19-
19-14 The four key steps in managing bottleneck resources are: Step 1: Recognize that the bottleneck operation determines throughput contribution of the entire system. Step 2: Search for, and identify the bottleneck operation. Step 3: Keep the bottleneck operation busy, and subordinate all nonbottleneck operations to the bottleneck operation. Step 4: Increase bottleneck efficiency and capacity. 19-15 The chapter describes several ways to improve the performance of a bottleneck operation. 1. Eliminate idle time at the bottleneck operation. 2. Process only those parts or products at the bottleneck operation that increase throughput contribution, not parts or products that will remain in finished goods or spare parts inventories. 3. Shift products that do not have to be made on the bottleneck machine to nonbottleneck machines or to outside processing facilities. 4.

2. From an analysis of the Cost of Quality Report, it would appear that Costen, Inc.s program has been successful because: Total quality costs as a percentage of total revenues have declined from 24.7% to 14.1%. External failure costs, those costs signaling customer dissatisfaction, have declined from 8.9% of total revenues to 2.8% of total revenues and from 36% of all quality costs to 20.1% of all quality costs. These declines in warranty repairs and customer returns should translate into increased revenues in the future. Internal failure costs as a percentage of revenues have been halved from 4.3% to 2%. Appraisal costs have decreased from 5.3% to 3% of revenues. Preventing defects from occurring in the first place is reducing the demand for final testing. Quality costs have shifted to the area of prevention where problems are solved before production starts: total prevention costs (maintenance, supplier training, and design reviews) have risen from 25% to 44.9% of total quality costs. The $60,000 increase in these costs is more than offset by decreases in other quality costs. Because of improved designs, quality training, and additional pre-production inspections, scrap and rework costs have almost been halved while increasing sales by 9.5%. Production does not have to spend an inordinate amount of time with customer service since they are now making the product right the first time and warranty repairs and customer returns have decreased.
 
3. To estimate the opportunity cost of not implementing the quality program and to help her make her case, Jessica Tolmy could have assumed that: Sales and market share would continue to decline if the quality program was not implemented and then calculated the loss in revenue and contribution margin. The company would have to compete on price rather than quality and calculated the impact of having to lower product prices.
Opportunity costs are not recorded in accounting systems because they represent the results of what might have happened if the company had not improved quality. Nevertheless, opportunity costs of poor quality can be significant. It is important for Costen to take these costs into account when making decisions about quality.

19-17 (20 min.) Costs of quality analysis. 1. Appraisal cost = Inspection cost = $5 100,000 car seats = $500,000 2. Internal failure cost = Rework cost = 5% 100,000 $1 = 5,000 $1 = $5,000 3. Out of pocket external failure cost = Shipping cost + Repair cost = 2% 100,000 ($10 + $1) = 2,000 $11 = $22,000 4. Opportunity cost of external failure = Lost future sales = (2% 100,000) 20% $500 = 400 car seats $500 = $200,000 5. Total cost of quality control = $500,000 + 5,000 + 22,000 + 200,000 = $727,000 6. Quality control costs under the alternative inspection technique: Appraisal cost = $1.50 100,000 = $150,000 Internal failure cost = 2.5% 100,000 $1 = $2,500 Out of pocket external failure cost = 4.5% 100,000 ($10 + 1) = 4,500 $11 = $49,500 Opportunity cost of external failure = 4,500 car seats 20% $500 = 900 car seats $500 = $450,000 Total cost of quality control = $150,000 + 2,500 + 49,500 + 450,000 = $652,000 7. In addition to the lower costs under the alternative inspection plan, Safe Rider should consider a number of other factors: a. There could easily be serious reputation effects if the percentage of external failures increases by 225% (from 2% to 4.5%). This rise in external failures may lead to costs greater than $500 per failure due to lost sales. b. Higher external failure rates may increase the probability of lawsuits. c. Government intervention is a concern, with the chances of government regulation increasing with the number of external failures.

19-18 (15 min.) Cost of quality analysis, ethical considerations (continuation of 19-17). 1. Cost of improving quality of plastic = $25 100,000 = $2,500,000 2. Total cost of lawsuits = 2 $750,000 = $1,500,000 3. While economically this may seem like a good decision, qualitative factors should be more important than quantitative factors when it comes to protecting customers from harm and injury. If a product can cause a customer serious harm and injury, an ethical and moral company should take steps to prevent that harm and injury. The companys code of ethics should guide this decision. 4. In addition to ethical considerations, the company should consider the societal cost of this decision, reputation effects if word of these problems leaks out at a later date, and governmental intervention and regulation.

19-19 (25 min.) Nonfinancial measures of quality and time.
1.
Percentage of defective units shipped Customer complaints as a percentage of units shipped Percentage of units reworked during production Manufacturing lead time as a percentage of total time from order to delivery
2009 100 = 5% 2,000 150 = 7.5% 2,000 120 = 6% 2,000 15 = 50% 30
2010 400 = 4% 10,000 250 = 2.5% 10,000 700 = 7% 10,000 16 = 57% 28
2. Quality has by and large improved. The percentage of defects has decreased by 1% and the number of customer complaints has decreased by 5%. The former indicates an increase in the quality of the cell phones being produced. The latter has positive implications for future sales. However, the percentage of units reworked has also increased. WCP should look into the reason for the increase. One possible explanation is the five-fold increase in production that may have resulted in a higher percentage of errors. WCP should do a root-cause analysis to identify reasons for the additional rework. Finally, the average time from order placement to order delivery has decreased. So customers are receiving their orders on a timelier basis. But manufacturing lead time is a higher fraction of customer lead time. WCP should seek ways to reduce manufacturing lead time. For example, process improvements could reduce both rework and manufacturing lead time. Any reduction in manufacturing lead time would help to further reduce customer response time. 3. Manufacturing lead time = wait time + manufacturing time. Producing 10,000 cell phones in 2010 may have required more waiting time for each order than the waiting time from producing 2,000 cell phones in 2009. Manufacturing lead time may have increased as more time was spent on making products with fewer defects and reducing rework activities. Customer response time = receipt time + manufacturing lead time + delivery time. Manufacturing lead time is a subset of customer response time. Lower customer response time times is due to order processing efficiency and/or delivery efficiency and not manufacturing lead time.

19-20 (25 min.) Quality improvement, relevant costs, and relevant revenues. 1. Relevant costs over the next year of choosing the new lens = $55 20,000 copiers = $1,100,000 Relevant Benefits over the Next Year of Choosing the New Lens
Costs of quality items Savings in rework costs $80 12,875 rework hours Savings in customer-support costs $40 900 customer-support-hours Savings in transportation costs for parts $360 200 fewer loads Savings in warranty repair costs $90 7,000 repair-hours Opportunity costs Contribution margin from increased sales Cost savings and additional contribution margin
$1,030,000 36,000 72,000 630,000 1,800,000 $3,568,000
Because the expected relevant benefits of $3,568,000 exceed the expected relevant costs of the new lens of $1,100,000, Photon should introduce the new lens. Note that the opportunity cost benefits in the form of higher contribution margin from increased sales is an important component for justifying the investment in the new lens. 2. The incremental cost of the new lens of $1,100,000 is less than the incremental savings in rework and repair costs of $1,768,000 ($1,030,000 + $36,000 + $72,000 + $630,000). Thus, it is beneficial for TechnoPrint to invest in the new lens even without making any additional sales.

19-21 (20 min.) Nonfinancial quality measures, on-time delivery. 1. The data seem to support the concerns expressed by Checkers headquarters. Store 2 has the lowest percentage of late deliveries and the highest customer satisfaction scores. On the other hand, Store 4 has the highest percentage of late deliveries and the lowest customer satisfaction score. Both Stores 1 and 3 fall between the two extremes and have similar customer satisfaction scores. 2. Percentage of Late Deliveries (X) 25 5 20 Average Overall Satisfaction (Y) 2 4 2

Checkers must estimate the profit implications of lost customer satisfaction due to failure to meet guaranteed delivery times. In addition, the company needs information about the value customers place on the delivery guarantee. Customers may choose to order from Checkers because of the guarantee. Because failure to meet the guarantee represents a cost, Checkers needs to compare this expected cost to the additional sales and profits attributable to the guarantee. Moreover, the delivery guarantee should motivate employees to strive for on-time delivery. After all, store profits on which store managers bonuses are based will be lower because of the $5 discount if pizzas are not delivered on time. Store managers who view the guarantee as a win-win situation should also be educated on the long-term effects that late deliveries have on the company if overall customer satisfaction declines. One possibility is to modify the bonus scheme so that on-time delivery is explicitly weighted in the bonus calculation.

19-22 (30 min.) Waiting time, service industry. 1. If SMUs advisors expect to see 300 students each day and it takes an average of 12 minutes to advise each student, then the average time that a student will wait can be calculated using the following formula: 2 Average number Time taken to of students per day advise a student Wait time = Maximum amount Average number Time taken to 2 advise a student of time available of students per day

2. i) Cost if SMU hires 2 extra advisors for the registration period: Advisor salary cost = 12 advisors 10 days $100 = $12,000 ii) Cost if SMU has its 10 advisors work 6 days a week for the registration period: Advisor salary cost = 10 advisors 10 days $100 + 10 advisors 2 days $150 = $13,000 Alternative (i) is less costly for SMU. 3. Hiring two extra advisors has a shorter waiting time and a lower cost than extending the workweek to 6 days during the registration period. However, the quality of the advising may not be as high. The temporary advisors may not be as familiar with the requirements of the university. They may also be unaware of how to work within the system (i.e., they may not be aware of alternatives that may be available to help students). 19-
19-24 (15 min.) Manufacturing cycle time, manufacturing cycle efficiency. 1. Manufacturing cycle efficiency (MCE) is defined as follows: MCE = Value-added manufacturing time Total manufacturing time So MCE in Torrance Manufacturing is: MCE = 4 days of processing time 22 days total manufacturing time = 0.18 2. Manufacturing cycle time = Total time from receipt of an order by production until its completion. Manufacturing cycle time = (8 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 2) days = 22 days 19-25 (25 min.) Theory of constraints, throughput contribution, relevant costs. 1. Finishing is a bottleneck operation. Therefore, producing 1,000 more units will generate additional throughput contribution and operating income. Increase in throughput contribution ($72 $32) 1,000 Incremental costs of the jigs and tools Net benefit of investing in jigs and tools $40,000 30,000 $10,000
Mayfield should invest in the modern jigs and tools because the benefit of higher throughput contribution of $40,000 exceeds the cost of $30,000. 2. The Machining Department has excess capacity and is not a bottleneck operation. Increasing its capacity further will not increase throughput contribution. There is, therefore, no benefit from spending $5,000 to increase the Machining Department&apos;s capacity by 10,000 units. Mayfield should not implement the change to do setups faster. 3. Finishing is a bottleneck operation. Therefore, getting an outside contractor to produce 12,000 units will increase throughput contribution. Increase in throughput contribution ($72 $32) 12,000 Incremental contracting costs $10 12,000 Net benefit of contracting 12,000 units of finishing $480,000 120,000 $360,000
Mayfield should contract with an outside contractor to do 12,000 units of finishing at $10 per unit because the benefit of higher throughput contribution of $480,000 exceeds the cost of $120,000. The fact that the cost of $10 per unit is double Mayfield&apos;s finishing cost of $5 per unit is irrelevant. 4. Operating costs in the Machining Department of $640,000, or $8 per unit, are fixed costs. Mayfield will not save any of these costs by subcontracting machining of 4,000 units to Hunt Corporation. Total costs will be greater by $16,000 ($4 per unit 4,000 units) under the subcontracting alternative. Machining more filing cabinets will not increase throughput contribution, which is constrained by the finishing capacity. Mayfield should not accept Hunt&apos;s offer. The fact that Hunt&apos;s costs of machining per unit are half of what it costs Mayfield in-house is irrelevant.
19-
19-26 (15 min.) Theory of constraints, throughput contribution, quality. 1. Cost of defective unit at machining operation which is not a bottleneck operation is the loss in direct materials (variable costs) of $32 per unit. Producing 2,000 units of defectives does not result in loss of throughput contribution. Despite the defective production, machining can produce and transfer 80,000 units to finishing. Therefore, cost of 2,000 defective units at the machining operation is $32 2,000 = $64,000. 2. A defective unit produced at the bottleneck finishing operation costs Mayfield materials costs plus the opportunity cost of lost throughput contribution. Bottleneck capacity not wasted in producing defective units could be used to generate additional sales and throughput contribution. Cost of 2,000 defective units at the finishing operation is: Loss of direct materials $32 2,000 Forgone throughput contribution ($72 $32) 2,000 Total cost of 2,000 defective units $ 64,000 80,000 $144,000
Alternatively, the cost of 2,000 defective units at the finishing operation can be calculated as the lost revenue of $72 2,000 = $144,000. This line of reasoning takes the position that direct materials costs of $32 2,000 = $64,000 and all fixed operating costs in the machining and finishing operations would be incurred anyway whether a defective or good unit is produced. The cost of producing a defective unit is the revenue lost of $144,000.

19-27 (30 min.) Quality improvement, relevant costs, and relevant revenues. One way to present the alternatives is via a decision tree, as shown below. Make T971 Implement new design Do not make T971
Do not implement new design The idea is to first evaluate the best action that Thomas should take if it implements the new design (that is, make or not make T971). Thomas can then compare the best mix of products to produce if it implements the new design against the status quo of not implementing the new design. 1. Thomas has capacity constraints. Demand for V262 valves (370,000 valves) exceeds production capacity of 330,000 valves (3 valves per hour 110,000 machine-hours). Since capacity is constrained, Thomas will choose to sell the product that maximizes contribution margin per machine-hour (the constrained resource). Contribution margin per = $8 per valve 3 valves per hour = $24 machine-hour for V262 Contribution margin per = $10 per valve 2 valves per hour = $20. machine-hour for T971 Thomas should reject Jackson Corporations offer and continue to manufacture only V262 valves.
19-
2. Now compare the alternatives of (a) not implementing the new design versus (b) implementing the new design. By implementing the new design, Thomas will save 10,000 machine-hours of rework time. This time can then be used to make and sell 30,000 (3 valves per hour 10,000 hours) additional V262 valves. The relevant costs and benefits of implementing the new design follow: The relevant costs of implementing the new design Relevant benefits: a (a) Savings in rework costs ($3 per V262 valve 30,000 valves) (b) Additional contribution margin from selling another 30,000 V262 valves (3 valves per hour 10,000 hours) because capacity previously used for rework is freed up ($8 per valve 30,000 units) Net relevant benefit

that the fixed rework costs of equipment rent and allocated overhead are irrelevant, because these costs will be incurred whether Thomas implements or does not implement the new design.
Thomas should implement the new design since the relevant benefits exceed the relevant costs by $15,000. 3. Thomas Corporation should also consider other benefits of improving quality. For example, the process of quality improvement will help Thomas&apos;s managers and workers gain expertise about the product and the manufacturing process that may lead to further cost reductions in the future. Improving quality within the plant is also likely to translate into delivering better quality products to customers. The increased reputation and customer goodwill may well lead to higher future revenues through greater unit sales and higher sales prices.

19-28 (30 min.) Quality improvement, relevant costs, and relevant revenues. 1. By implementing the new method, Tan would incur additional direct materials costs on all the 200,000 units started at the molding operation.
Additional direct materials costs = $4 per lamp 200,000 lamps The relevant benefits of adding the new material are: Increased revenue from selling 30,000 more lamps $40 per lamp 30,000 lamps $800,000
$1,200,000
Note that Tan Corporation continues to incur the same total variable costs of direct materials, direct manufacturing labor, setup labor and materials handling labor, and the same fixed costs of equipment, rent, and allocated overhead that it is currently incurring, even when it improves quality. Since these costs do not differ among the alternatives of adding the new material or not adding the new material, they are excluded from the analysis. The relevant benefit of adding the new material is the extra revenue that Tan would get from producing 30,000 good lamps. An alternative approach to analyzing the problem is to focus on scrap costs and the benefits of reducing scrap. The relevant benefits of adding the new material are: a. Cost savings from eliminating scrap:
Variable cost per lamp, $19a 30,000 lamps b. Additional contribution margin from selling another 30,000 lamps because 30,000 lamps will no longer be scrapped: Unit contribution margin $21b 30,000 lamps Total benefits to Tan of adding new material to improve quality
a Note
$ 570,000
630,000 $1,200,000
that only the variable scrap costs of $19 per lamp (direct materials, $16 per lamp; direct manufacturing labor, setup labor, and materials handling labor, $3 per lamp) are relevant because improving quality will save these costs. Fixed scrap costs of equipment, rent, and other allocated overhead are irrelevant because these costs will be incurred whether Tan Corporation adds or does not add the new material.

On the basis of quantitative considerations alone, Tan should use the new material. Relevant benefits of $1,200,000 exceed the relevant costs of $800,000 by $400,000. 2. Other nonfinancial and qualitative factors that Tan should consider in making a decision include the effects of quality improvement on: a. gaining manufacturing expertise that could lead to further cost reductions in the future; b. enhanced reputation and increased customer goodwill which could lead to higher future revenues through greater unit sales and higher sales prices; and c. higher employee morale as a result of higher quality. 19-29 (3040 min.) Statistical quality control, airline operations. 19-
1. The + 2 rule will trigger a decision to investigate when the round-trip fuel usage is outside the control limit: Mean + 2 = 200 + 2 = 200 + (2 20) or 160 to 240 gallon-units Any fuel usage less than 160 gallon-units or greater than 240 gallon-units will trigger a decision to investigate. The only plane to be outside the specified + 2 fuel usage control limit is the Spirit of Sacramento on flights #5 (242 gallon-units), #7 (249 gallon-units), and #10 (244 gallon-units). 2. Solution Exhibit 19-29 presents the SQC charts for each of the three 747s. The Spirit of Atlanta has no observation outside the + 2 control limits. However, there was an increase in fuel use in each of the last nine round-trip flights. The probability of nine consecutive increases from an in-control process is very low, and this is a trend that should be investigated. The Spirit of Boston appears in control regarding fuel usage. The Spirit of Sacramento has three observations outside the + 2 control limits. Moreover, the mean of the fuel usage for the last six flights is 238 gallon-units compared to a mean of 208 gallon-units for the first four flights. There is a rising trend, and some observations are already greater than the acceptable upper limits for fuel consumption. This should be investigated. 3. The advantage of using dollar fuel costs as the unit of analysis in an SQC chart is that it focuses on a variable of overriding concern to top managers (operating costs). However, the disadvantages of using dollar fuel costs are: a. Split responsibilities. Operations managers may not control the purchase of fuel, and may want to exclude from their performance measures any variation stemming from factors outside their control. b. Offsetting factors may mask important underlying trends when the quantity used and the price paid are combined in a single observation. For example, decreasing gallon usage may be offset by increasing fuel costs. Both of these individual patterns are important in budgeting for an airline. c. The distribution of fuel usage in gallons may be different from the distribution of fuel prices per gallon. More reliable estimates of the and parameters might be obtained by focusing separately on the individual usage and price distributions.
Note: The above disadvantages are most marked if actual fuel prices are used. The use of standard fuel prices can reduce many of these disadvantages.

Operating income captures revenue and cost-related factors. However, there is no recognition of investment differences between the two groups. If one group is substantially bigger than the other, differences in size alone give the president of the larger group the opportunity to earn a bigger bonus. An alternative approach would be to use return on investment (perhaps relative to the budgeted ROI).
15 minute benchmark as a measure of patient response time
This measure reflects the ability of Mid-Atlantic Healthcare to meet a benchmark for patient response time. Several concerns arise with this specific measure: a. It is a yes-or-no cut-off. A 16 minute waiting time earns no bonus, but neither does a two hour wait. Moreover, no extra bonus is paid for additional waiting time reductions below 15 minutes. An alternative is to have the bonus that increases with greater waiting time improvements. b. It can be manipulated. Doctors might quickly make initial contact with a patient to meet the benchmark, but then leave the patient sitting in the examination room for a more detailed examination or procedure to take place. c. It reflects performance relative only to the initial waiting time. It does not consider other time-related issues such as the wait for an appointment or the time needed to fill out forms.
19-
Problems in (b) and (c) can be overcome by measuring total patient response time (such as how long it takes from the time a patient makes an appointment to the time the actual appointment is concluded), in addition to average waiting time to meet the doctor.
Patient satisfaction as a measure of quality
This measure represents a common method for assessing quality. However, there are several concerns with its use: a. Patient satisfaction is likely to be influenced by a number of factors that are outside the groups control, such as how sick the patients are when coming in or the extent to which they follow doctors orders. b. It is influenced by the questions asked in the survey and the survey methodology. As a result, is likely to be noisy or very sensitive to assumptions. c. Patient satisfaction is not the same as patient health outcomes, an important measure of healthcare quality. A combination of measures may work well as a composite measure of quality. 3. Most companies use both financial and nonfinancial measures to evaluate performance, sometimes presented in a single report such as a balanced scorecard. Using multiple measures of performance enables top management to evaluate whether lower-level managers have improved one area at the expense of others. For example, did the better average waiting time (and patient satisfaction) between July and December in the Baltimore group result from significantly higher expenditures that contributed to the dramatic reduction in operating income? An important issue is the relative importance to place on the different measures. If waiting time is not used for performance evaluation, managers will concentrate on increasing operating income and give less attention to waiting time, even if waiting time has a significant influence on whether customers choose Mid-Atlantic Healthcare or another healthcare provider when given the choice. However, the president of the Baltimore group received a larger bonus in the second half of the year due in part to lower average waiting time, even though operating profits dropped by nearly 90%. Companies must understand the relative importance of different financial and nonfinancial objectives when using multiple measures for performance evaluation.

3. Delays occur in the processing of B7 and A3 because of (a) uncertainty about how many orders Brandt will actually receive (Brandt expects to receive 125 orders of B7 and 10 orders of A3), and (b) uncertainty about the actual dates when Brandt will receive the orders. The uncertainty (randomness) about the quantity and timing of customer orders means that Brandt may receive customer orders while another order is still being processed. Orders received while the machine is actually processing another order must wait in queue for the machine to be free. As average capacity utilization of the machine increases, there is less slack and a greater chance that a machine will be busy when another order arrives. Delays can be reduced if the uncertainties facing the firm can be reduced, perhaps by negotiating fixed schedules with customers in advance. Brandt should explore these alternatives before deciding on whether to manufacture and sell A3. A3 may be a strategically important product for Brandt in the future. For example, it may help Brandt to develop a customer relationship with Airbus Industries that could be helpful in the future. Even though manufacturing A3 is costly in the short run, it may be beneficial to Brandt in the long term. If Brandt could reduce manufacturing time for A3 (and B7), it could find it profitable to manufacture both harnesses. Brandt may also want to try to negotiate a higher price for A3 that would make manufacturing both B7 and A3 profitable.

19-34 (20 min.) Theory of constraints, throughput contribution, relevant costs. It will cost Colorado $50 per unit to reduce manufacturing time. But manufacturing is not a bottleneck operation; installation is. Therefore, manufacturing more equipment will not increase sales and throughput contribution. Colorado Industries should not implement the new manufacturing method.
1.
2.
Additional relevant costs of new direct materials, $2,000 320 units, Increase in throughput contribution, $25,000 20 units,
$640,000 $500,000
The additional incremental costs exceed the benefits from higher throughput contribution by $140,000, so Colorado Industries should not implement the new design. Alternatively, compare throughput contribution under each alternative. Current throughput contribution is $25,000 300 With the modification, throughput contribution is $23,000 320
$7,500,000 $7,360,000
The current throughput contribution is greater than the throughput contribution resulting from the proposed change in direct materials. Therefore, Colorado Industries should not implement the new design. 3. Increase in throughput contribution, $25,000 10 units Increase in relevant costs $250,000 $ 50,000
The additional throughput contribution exceeds incremental costs by $200,000, so Colorado Industries should implement the new installation technique. 4. Motivating installation workers to increase productivity is worthwhile because installation is a bottleneck operation, and any increase in productivity at the bottleneck will increase throughput contribution. On the other hand, motivating workers in the manufacturing department to increase productivity is not worthwhile. Manufacturing is not a bottleneck operation, so any increase in output will result only in extra inventory of equipment. Colorado Industries should encourage manufacturing to produce only as much equipment as the installation department needs, not to produce as much as it can. Under these circumstances, it would not be a good idea to evaluate and compensate manufacturing workers on the basis of their productivity.

19-35 (3040 min.) Theory of constraints, throughput contribution, quality, relevant costs. 1. Direct materials costs to produce 390,000 tablets, $156,000 $156,000 Direct materials costs per tablet = = $0.40 per tablet 390,000 Selling price per tablet = $1.00 Unit throughput contribution = Selling price Unit direct materials costs = $1.00 $0.40 = $0.60 per tablet
Tablet-making is a bottleneck operation. Therefore, producing 19,500 more tablets will generate additional operating income. Additional operating income per contractor-made tablet = Unit throughput Additional operating contribution costs per tablet = $0.60 $0.12 = $0.48
Increase in operating income, $0.48 19,500 = $9,360. Therefore, Aardee should accept the outside contractor&apos;s offer. 2. Operating costs for the mixing department are a fixed cost. Contracting out the mixing activity will not reduce mixing department costs but will cost an additional $0.07 per gram of mixture. Mixing more direct materials will have no effect on throughput contribution, since tablet making is the bottleneck operation. Therefore, Aardee should reject the company&apos;s offer. 3. The benefit of improved quality is $10,000. Aardee is using the same quantity of direct materials as before, so it incurs no extra direct materials costs. The 10,000 extra tablets produced generate additional revenue of $10,000 ($1 10,000 tablets) a month. The modification costs $7,000 per month, which results in a net gain of $3,000. Aardee should implement the new method. 4. Cost per gram of mixture = $156,000 = $0.78 per gram 200,000
Cost of 10,000 grams of mixture = $0.78 10,000 = $7,800 Benefit from better mixing quality Cost of improving the mixing operation $7,800 per month $9,000 per month
Since the costs exceed the benefits by $1,200 per month, Aardee should not adopt the proposed quality improvement plan. 5. Compare the answers to requirements 3 and 4. The benefit of improving quality at the mixing operation is the savings in materials costs. The benefit of improving quality of the tabletmaking department (the bottleneck operation) is the savings in materials costs plus the additional throughput contribution from higher sales equal to the total revenues that result from relieving the bottleneck constraint. 19-
19-36 (30-35 min.) Theory of constraints, contribution margin, sensitivity analysis. 1. Assuming only one type of doll is produced, the maximum production in each department given their resource constraints is: Molding Department 30,000 lbs = 20,000 1.5 lbs 30,000 lbs = 15,000 2lbs Assembly Department 8,400 hours = 25,200 1/3 hours 8,400 hours = 16,800 1/2hours Contribution Margin
$35 1.5 $10 1/3 $12 = $16 $45 2 $10 $12 = $19
Chatty Chelsey Talking Tanya
For both types of dolls, the constraining resource is the availability of material since this constraint causes the lowest maximum production. If only Chatty Chelsey is produced, LTT can produce 20,000 dolls with a contribution margin of 20,000 $16 = $320,000 If only Talking Tanya is produced, LTT can produce 15,000 dolls with a contribution margin of 15,000 $19 = $285,000. LTT should produce Chatty Chelseys. 2. As shown in Requirement 1, available material in the Molding department is the limiting constraint. If LTT sells two Chatty Chelseys for each Talking Tanya, then the maximum number of Talking Tanya dolls the Molding Department can produce (where the number of Talking Tanya dolls is denoted as T) is: (T 2 lbs.) + ([2 T] 1.5 lbs.) = 30,000 lbs. 2T + 3T = 30,000 5T = 30,000 T = 6,000 The Molding Department can produce 6,000 Talking Tanya dolls, and 2 6,000 (or 12,000) Chatty Chelsey dolls.
Since LTT can only produce 6,000 Talking Tanyas and 12,000 Chatty Chelseys before it runs out of ingredients, the maximum contribution margin (CM) is: CM = 12,000 $16 + 6,000 $19 = $306,000
19-
3. With 10 more pounds of materials, LTT would produce more dolls. Using the same technique as in Requirement 2, the increase in production is: (T 2 lbs.) + ([2 T] 1.5 lbs.) =10 lbs. 2T + 3T = 10 T=2 LTT would produce 2 extra Talking Tanya dolls and 4 extra Chatty Chelsey dolls. Contribution margin would increase by 4 $16 + 2 $19 = $102 4. With 10 more labor hours, production would not change. The limiting constraint is pounds of material, not labor hours. LTT already has more labor hours available than it needs. 19-37 (25 min.) Quality improvement, Pareto diagram, cause-and-effect diagram. 1.

The total costs of quality are less than 10% of revenues. 2. Students can probably discuss both sides of this argument. Evans is obviously concerned because he expected the customer complaints calculation to be based on the number of customers who actually complained, not on Williamss survey. However, Williamss approach has the advantage of being thorough and systematic. Having done the survey, it would be unethical for Williams to now modify her analysis and incorrectly report the costs of quality and various nonfinancial measures of quality. In assessing the situation, the specific Standards of Ethical Conduct for Management Accountants (described in Exhibit 1-7) that Lindsey Williams should consider are listed below.
Competence Clear reports using relevant and reliable information should be prepared. Preparing reports on the basis of incorrect numbers violates competence standards. Integrity Integrity requires that Williams report the numbers she collected. The standards of ethical conduct require the management accountant to communicate favorable as well as unfavorable information. Williams also has a responsibility to avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest and advise all appropriate parties of any potential conflict. If Williams revises the customer complaints numbers, her action could be interpreted as being motivated by her desire to please her bosses. This would violate the responsibility for integrity.
19-
Credibility The management accountant&apos;s standards of ethical conduct require that information should be fairly and objectively communicated and that all relevant information should be disclosed. From a management accountant&apos;s standpoint, adjusting the customer complaints numbers to make performance look good would violate the standard of objectivity.
Williams should indicate to Roche that the costs of quality and nonfinancial measures of quality presented in the reports are, indeed, appropriate. She could propose that she add another line item indicating the number of unsolicited complaints she received, that is, complaints she received independent of the survey. She should not, however, change the numbers she obtained in the survey. If Roche still insists on modifying the customer complaints numbers, Williams should raise the matter with one of Roches superiors, other than Evans, who has a vested interest in this dispute. If, after taking all these steps, there is continued pressure to change survey results, Williams should consider resigning from the company and not engage in unethical behavior.

19-39 (4550 min.) Quality improvement, theory of constraints. 1. Consider the incremental revenues and incremental costs to Wellesley Corporation of purchasing additional grey cloth from outside suppliers. Incremental revenues, $1,250 (5,000 rolls 0.90) Incremental costs: Cost of grey cloth, $900 5,000 rolls $4,500,000 Direct materials variable costs at printing operation, $100 5,000 rolls 500,000 Incremental costs Excess of incremental revenues over incremental costs $5,625,000
5,000,000 $ 625,000
Note that, because the printing department has surplus capacity equal to 5,500 (15,000 9,500) rolls per month, purchasing grey cloth from outside entails zero opportunity costs. Yes, the Printing Department should buy the grey cloth from the outside supplier. 2. By producing a defective roll in the Weaving Department, Wellesley Corporation is worse off by the entire amount of revenue forgone of $1,250 per roll. Note that, since the weaving operation is a constraint, any rolls received by the Printing Department that are defective and disposed of at zero net disposal value result in lost revenue to the firm. An alternative approach to analyzing the problem is to focus on the costs of defective units and the benefits of reducing defective units. The relevant costs of defective units in the Printing Department are: a. Direct materials variable costs in the Weaving Department b. Direct materials variable costs in the Printing Department c. Contribution margin forgone from not selling one roll $1,250 $500 $100 Amount by which Wellesley Corporation is worse off as a result of a defective unit in the Printing Department $ 500 100 650 $1,250
Note that only the variable costs of defective units of $600 per roll (direct materials in the Weaving Department, $500 per roll: direct materials in the Printing Department, $100 per roll) are relevant because improving quality will save these costs. Fixed costs of producing defective units, attributable to other operating costs, are irrelevant because these costs will be incurred whether Wellesley Corporation reduces defective units in the Printing Department or not. Wellesley Corporation should make the proposed modifications in the Printing Department because the incremental benefits exceed the incremental costs by $125,000 per month: Incremental benefits of reducing defective units in the Printing Department by 4% (from 10% to 6%) 4% 9,500 rolls $1,250 per roll (computed above) $475,000 Incremental costs of the modification 350,000 Excess of incremental benefits over incremental costs $125,000 19-
3. To determine how much Wellesley Corporation is worse off by producing a defective roll in the Weaving Department, consider the payoff to Wellesley from not having a defective roll produced in the Weaving Department. The good roll produced in the Weaving Department will be sent for further processing in the Printing Department. The relevant costs and benefits of printing and selling this roll follow: Additional direct materials variable costs incurred in the Printing Department Expected revenue from selling the finished product, $1,250 0.9 (since 10% of the Printing Department output will be defective and will earn zero revenue) Net expected benefit of producing a good roll in the Weaving Department
$ (100)
1,125 $1,025
By producing a defective roll in the Weaving Department, Wellesley Corporation is worse off by $1,025 per roll. Note that, since the weaving operation is a constraint, any rolls that are defective will result in lost revenue to the firm. An alternative approach to analyzing the problem is to focus on the costs and benefits of reducing defective units. The relevant costs of defective units in the Weaving Department are: a. Direct materials variable costs in the Weaving Department b. Expected unit contribution margin forgone from not selling one roll, ($1,250 0.9) $500 $100 Amount by which Wellesley Corporation is worse off as a result of producing a defective unit in the Weaving Department $ 500 525 $1,025
Note that only the variable scrap costs of $500 per roll (direct materials in the Weaving Department) are relevant because improving quality will save these costs. All fixed costs of producing defective units attributable to other operating costs are irrelevant because these costs will be incurred whether Wellesley Corporation reduces defective units in the Weaving Department or not. Wellesley Corporation should make the improvements proposed by the design engineering team because the incremental benefits exceed the incremental costs by $30,000 per month: Incremental benefits of reducing defective units in the Weaving Department by 2% (from 5% to 3%) 2% 10,000 rolls $1,025 per roll (computed above) $205,000 Incremental costs of improvements 175,000 Excess of incremental benefits over incremental costs $ 30,000

CHAPTER 20 INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, JUST-IN-TIME, AND SIMPLIFIED COSTING METHODS 20-1 Cost of goods sold (in retail organizations) or direct materials costs (in organizations with a manufacturing function) as a percentage of sales frequently exceeds net income as a percentage of sales by many orders of magnitude. In the Kroger grocery store example cited in the text, cost of goods sold to sales is 73.7%, and net income to sales is 0.6%. Thus, a 10% reduction in the ratio of cost of goods sold to sales (73.7 to 66.3%) without any other changes can result in a 1233% increase in net income to sales (0.6% to 8.0%). 20-2 Five cost categories important in managing goods for sale in a retail organization are the following: 1. purchasing costs; 2. ordering costs; 3. carrying costs; 4. stockout costs; and 5. quality costs 20-3 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Five assumptions made when using the simplest version of the EOQ model are: The same quantity is ordered at each reorder point. Demand, ordering costs, carrying costs, and the purchase-order lead time are certain. Purchasing cost per unit is unaffected by the quantity ordered. No stockouts occur. Costs of quality are considered only to the extent that these costs affect ordering costs or carrying costs.
20-4 Costs included in the carrying costs of inventory are incremental costs for such items as insurance, rent, obsolescence, spoilage, and breakage plus the opportunity cost of capital (or required return on investment). 20-5 Examples of opportunity costs relevant to the EOQ decision model but typically not recorded in accounting systems are the following: 1. the return forgone by investing capital in inventory; 2. lost contribution margin on existing sales when a stockout occurs; and 3. lost contribution margin on potential future sales that will not be made to disgruntled customers. 20-6 The steps in computing the costs of a prediction error when using the EOQ decision model are: Step 1: Compute the monetary outcome from the best action that could be taken, given the actual amount of the cost input. Step 2: Compute the monetary outcome from the best action based on the incorrect amount of the predicted cost input. Step 3: Compute the difference between the monetary outcomes from Steps 1 and 2.
20-1
20-7 Goal congruence issues arise when there is an inconsistency between the EOQ decision model and the model used for evaluating the performance of the person implementing the model. For example, if opportunity costs are ignored in performance evaluation, the manager may be induced to purchase in a quantity larger than the EOQ model indicates is optimal. 20-8 Just-in-time (JIT) purchasing is the purchase of materials (or goods) so that they are delivered just as needed for production (or sales). Benefits include lower inventory holdings (reduced warehouse space required and less money tied up in inventory) and less risk of inventory obsolescence and spoilage. 20-9 Factors causing reductions in the cost to place purchase orders of materials are: Companies are establishing long-run purchasing agreements that define price and quality terms over an extended period. Companies are using electronic links, such as the Internet, to place purchase orders. Companies are increasing the use of purchase-order cards.
20-10 Disagree. Choosing the supplier who offers the lowest price will not necessarily result in the lowest total purchase cost to the buyer. This is because the price or purchase cost of the goods is only oneand perhaps, most obviouselement of cost associated with purchasing and managing inventories. Other relevant cost items are ordering costs, carrying costs, stockout costs and quality costs. A low-cost supplier may well impose conditions on the buyersuch as poor quality, or frequent stockouts, or excessively high inventoriesthat result in high total costs of purchase. Buyers must examine all the elements of costs relevant to inventory management, not just the purchase price. 20-11 Supply-chain analysis describes the flow of goods, services, and information from the initial sources of materials and services to the delivery of products to consumers, regardless of whether those activities occur in the same organization or in other organizations. Sharing of information across companies enables a reduction in inventory levels at all stages, fewer stockouts at the retail level, reduced manufacture of product not subsequently demanded by retailers, and a reduction in expedited manufacturing orders. 20-12 Just-in-time (JIT) production is a demand-pull manufacturing system that has the following features: Organize production in manufacturing cells, Hire and retain workers who are multi-skilled, Aggressively pursue total quality management (TQM) to eliminate defects, Place emphasis on reducing both setup time and manufacturing lead time, and Carefully select suppliers who are capable of delivering quality materials in a timely manner. 20-13 Traditional normal and standard costing systems use sequential tracking, in which journal entries are recorded in the same order as actual purchases and progress in production, typically at four different trigger points in the process. Backflush costing omits recording some of the journal entries relating to the cycle from purchase of direct materials to sale of finished goods, i.e., it has fewer trigger points at which journal entries are made. When journal entries for one or more stages in the cycle are omitted, 20-2
the journal entries for a subsequent stage use normal or standard costs to work backward to flush out the costs in the cycle for which journal entries were not made. 20-14 Versions of backflush costing differ in the number and placement of trigger points at which journal entries are made in the accounting system: Number of Journal Entry Trigger Points 3
Version 1
Location in Cycle Where Journal Entries Made Stage A. Purchase of direct materials Stage C. Completion of good finished units of product Stage D. Sale of finished goods Stage A.

20-15 Traditional accounting systems cost individual products, and separate product costs from selling, general, and administrative costs. Lean accounting costs the entire value stream instead of individual products. Unused capacity costs and common costs that cannot be reasonably assigned to value streams are excluded from value stream costs. In addition, many lean accounting users expense material costs the period they are purchased, rather than storing them on the balance sheet until the products using the material are sold. 20-16 (20 min.)

The sizable reduction in ordering cost (from $200 to $30 per purchase order) has reduced the EOQ from 756 to 293. 2. The AT proposal has both upsides and downsides. The upside is potentially higher sales. FB customers may purchase more online than if they have to physically visit a store. FB would also have lower administrative costs and lower inventory holding costs with the proposal. The downside is that AT could capture FBs customers. Repeat customers to the AT web site need not be classified as FB customers. FB would have to establish enforceable rules to make sure it captures ongoing revenues from customers it directs to the AP web site. There is insufficient information to determine whether FB should accept ATs proposal. Much depends on whether FB views AT as a credible, honest partner.

Relevant carrying costs per part per year: Required annual return on investment 15% $60 = Relevant insurance, materials handling, breakage, etc. costs per year Relevant carrying costs per part per year With D = 18,000; P = $150; C = $15, EOQ for manufacturer is: 2 18,000 $150 = = 600 units $15 2. Total relevant = D P Q ordering costs 18,000 = $150 600 = $4,500 where Q = 600 units, the EOQ.
$9 6 $15
3. At the EOQ, total relevant ordering costs and total relevant carrying costs will be exactly equal. Therefore, total relevant carrying costs at the EOQ = $4,500 (from requirement 2). We can also confirm this with direct calculation: Q Total relevant carrying costs = C 2 600 = $15 2 = $4,500 where Q = 600 units, the EOQ. 4. Purchase order lead time is half a month. Monthly demand is 18,000 units 12 months = 1,500 units per month. 1 Demand in half a month is 1,500 units or 750 units. 2 Lakeland should reorder when the inventory of rotor blades falls to 750 units.
20-5
20-20 (20 min.) Sensitivity of EOQ to changes in relevant ordering and carrying costs. 1. A straightforward approach to the requirement is to construct the following table for EOQ at relevant carrying and ordering costs. Annual demand is 10,000 units. The formula for the EOQ model is: EOQ = where D = demand in units for a specified period of time P = relevant ordering costs per purchase order C = relevant carrying costs of one unit in stock for the time period used for D (one year in this problem. Relevant Carrying Costs per Unit per Year $10
Relevant Ordering Costs per Purchase Order $300 $200 2 10,000 $300 = 775 $10 2 10,000 $300 = 632 $15 2 10,000 $300 $20 = 548 2 10,000 $200 = 632 $10 2 10,000 $200 = 516 $15 2 10,000 $200 $20 = 447

2. For a given demand level, as relevant carrying costs increase, EOQ becomes smaller. For a given demand level, as relevant order costs increase, EOQ increases. 20-21 (15 min.) Inventory management and the balanced scorecard.
1. The incremental increase in operating profits from employee cross-training (ignoring the cost of the training) is: Increased revenue from higher customer satisfaction ($5,000,000 2% 5) $500,000 Reduced inventory-related costs 100,000 Incremental increase in operating profits (ignoring training costs) $600,000 2. At a cost of $600,000, DSC will be indifferent between current expenditures and increasing employee cross-training by 5%. Consequently, the most DSC would be willing to pay for this cross-training is the $600,000 benefit received. 3. Besides increasing short-term operating profits, additional employee cross-training can improve employee satisfaction because their jobs can have more variety, potentially leading to unanticipated productivity improvements and lower employee turnover. Multi-skilled employees can also understand the production process better and can suggest potential improvements. Each of these may lead to additional cost reductions.

Solution Exhibit 20-22 presents the annual net benefit of $315,000 to Champion Hardware Company of implementing a JIT production system. 2. Other nonfinancial and qualitative factors that Champion should consider in deciding whether it should implement a JIT system include: a. The possibility of developing and implementing a detailed system for integrating the sequential operations of the manufacturing process. Direct materials must arrive when needed for each subassembly so that the production process functions smoothly. b. The ability to design products that use standardized parts and reduce manufacturing time. c. The ease of obtaining reliable vendors who can deliver quality direct materials on time with minimum lead time. d. Willingness of suppliers to deliver smaller and more frequent orders. e. The confidence of being able to deliver quality products on time. Failure to do so would result in customer dissatisfaction. f. The skill levels of workers to perform multiple tasks such as minor repairs, maintenance, quality testing and inspection.

3. Personal observation by production line workers and managers is more effective in JIT plants than in traditional plants. A JIT plants production process layout is streamlined. Operations are not obscured by piles of inventory or rework. As a result, such plants are easier to evaluate by personal observation than cluttered plants where the flow of production is not logically laid out. Besides personal observation, nonfinancial performance measures are the dominant methods of control. Nonfinancial performance measures provide most timely and easy to understand measures of plant performance. Examples of nonfinancial performance measures of time, inventory, and quality include: Manufacturing lead time Units produced per hour Machine setup time manufacturing time Number of defective units number of units completed In addition to personal observation and nonfinancial performance measures, financial performance measures are also used. Examples of financial performance measures include: Cost of rework Ordering costs Stockout costs Inventory turnover (cost of goods sold average inventory) The success of a JIT system depends on the speed of information flows from customers to manufacturers to suppliers. The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system has a single database, and gives lower-level managers, workers, customers, and suppliers access to operating information. This benefit, accompanied by tight coordination across business functions, enables the ERP system to rapidly transmit information in response to changes in supply and demand so that manufacturing and distribution plans may be revised accordingly.

The economic order quantity is 1,800 packages. It is the order quantity at which carrying costs equal ordering costs and total relevant ordering and carrying costs are minimized. We can also confirm this from direct calculation. Using D = 234,000; P = $81 and C = $11.70 2 234,000 $81 EOQ = = 1,800 packages $11.70 It is interesting to note that Koala Blue faces a situation where total relevant ordering and carrying costs do not vary very much when order quantity ranges from 1,500 packages to 2,700 packages. 2. When the ordering cost per purchase order is reduced to $49: 2 234,000 $49 EOQ = = 1,400 packages $11.70 The EOQ drops from 1,800 packages to 1,400 packages when Koala Blues ordering cost per purchase order decreases from $81 to $49. D 234,000 And the new relevant costs of ordering inventory = P = $49 = $8,190 Q 1,400 Q 1,400 $11.70 = $8,190 and the new relevant costs or carrying inventory = C = 2 2 The total new costs of ordering and carrying inventory = $8,190 2 = $16,380 3. As summarized below, the new Mona Lisa web-based ordering system, by lowering the EOQ to 1,400 packages, will lower the carrying and ordering costs by $4,680. Koala Blue will spend $2,000 to train its purchasing assistants on the new system. Overall, Koala Blue will still save $2,680 in the first year alone. Total relevant costs at EOQ (from Requirement 2) Annual cost benefit over old system ($21,060 $16,380) Training costs Net benefit in first year alone $16,380 $ 4,680 2,000 $ 2,680

20-28 (25 min.) MRP, EOQ, and JIT. 1. Under a MRP system: Annual cost of producing and carrying J-Pods in inventory = Variable production cost + Setup cost + Carrying cost = $50 48,000 + ($50,000 12 months) + [$20 (4,000 2)] = $2,400,000 + 600,000 + 40,000 = $3,040,000 2. Using an EOQ model to determine batch size: EOQ 2 DP C 2 48,000 $50,000 $20
= 15,492 J-Pods per batch Production of 48,000 per year divided by a batch size of 15,492 would imply J-Pods would be produce 3.1 batches per year. Rounding this up to the nearest whole number yields 4 batches per year.
Annual Cost of producing and carrying J-Pods in inventory = Variable production cost + Setup cost + Carrying cost = $50 48,000 + ($50,000 4) + [$20 (15,492 2)] = $2,400,000 + 200,000 + 154,920 = $2,754,920 3. Under a JIT system Annual Cost of producing and carrying J-Pods in inventory = Variable production cost + Setup cost + Carrying cost = $50 48,000 + ($5,000 96 a) + [$20 (500 2)] = $2,400,000 + 480,000 + 5,000 = $2,885,000
a
production of 48,000 per year divided by a batch size of 500 would imply 96 setups per year. 4. The EOQ system resulted in the lowest costs, despite the fact that carrying costs were lower for the JIT model. However, the EOQ model, in this case, limits production to only once every four months. This would not allow managers to react quickly to changing market demand or economic conditions. The JIT model provides management with much more flexibility. JIT systems might also lead managers to improve processes, reduce costs and increase quality.

Total relevant cost = $77,459 + 129,100 = $206,559 Thus, the EOQ quantity and total relevant costs are higher if the company ignores holding costs when evaluating managers, but only by about 3%. The square root in the EOQ model reduces the sensitivity of the ordering decision to errors in parameter estimates. 4. Since managers will choose to order 5,164 computers instead of 4,000, the cost to the company will be $6, 559 ($206,559 - $200,000) higher than it would be if managers were evaluated based upon all carrying costs. Computers 4 U probably does not include the opportunity costs of carrying inventory because it is not tracked by the financial accounting system. The company could change the evaluation model to include a cost of investment in inventory. Even though this would involve an additional calculation, it would encourage managers to make optimal decisions.

Solution Exhibit 20-31 presents the $37,500 cash savings that would result if Margro Corporation adopted the just-in-time inventory system in 2008. 2. Conditions that should exist in order for a company to successfully adopt just-in-time purchasing include the following: Top management must be committed and provide the necessary leadership support to ensure a company-wide, coordinated effort. A detailed system for integrating the sequential operations of the manufacturing process needs to be developed and implemented. Direct materials must arrive when needed for each subassembly so that the production process functions smoothly. Accurate sales forecasts must be available for effective finished goods planning and production scheduling. Products should be designed to maximize use of standardized parts to reduce manufacturing time and costs.

2. While Induk will save Cow Spot $6,980 ($935,930 $928,950), Cow Spot may still choose to use Maji for the following reasons: a. The savings are less than 1% of the total cost of the mother boards. b. With ten times the number of returns, Induk will probably have a negative effect on Cow Spots reputation. c. With Induks higher stockouts, Cow Spots reputation for availability and on time delivery will be effected. d. The increased number of inspections may necessitate the hiring of additional personnel and the need for additional factory space and equipment.

20-36 (20 min.) Lean accounting. 1. The cost object in lean accounting is the value stream, not the individual product. FSD has identified two distinct value streams: Mechanical Devices and Electronic Devices. All direct costs are traced to the value streams. However, not all plant-level overhead costs are allocated to the value streams when computing operating income. Value streams are only charged for the percentage of space they actually use, only 85% of the $120,000 occupancy costs are charged to the two value streams. The remaining 15%, or $18,000, is not used to compute value stream profits, nor are other plant-level overhead costs. 2. Operating income under lean accounting are the following (in thousands of dollars): Mechanical Devices $1,200 Electronic Devices $1,350
Sales ($700 + $500; $900 + $450) Costs Direct material purchased ($190 + $125; $250 + $90) Direct manufacturing labor ($150 + $75; $200 + $60) Equipment costs ($90 + $125; $200 + $100) Product-line overhead ($110 + $60; $125 + $50) Occupancy costs ($120,000 40%) ($120,000 45%) Value stream operating income

In addition to the differences discussed in Requirement 1, FSDs lean accounting system treats all direct material costs as expenses in the period they are purchased. The following factors explain the differences between traditional operating income and lean accounting income for the two value streams: Mechanical Devices Traditional operating income ($100 + $105; $45 + $140) Additional cost of direct materials ($315 $300; $340 $325) Decrease in allocated plant-level overhead ($85 $48; $105 $54) Value stream operating income $205 (15) 37 $227 Electronic Devices $185 (15) 51 $221

20-37 (3540 min.) Backflushing. 1. Glendale has successfully implemented JIT in its production operations and, as a result, minimized work-in-process inventory. However, it still has a fair amount of raw material and finished goods inventory. Glendale should, therefore, adopt a backflush costing system with two trigger points, as follows: a. Direct materials purchases charged to Inventory: Materials and In-Process Control b. Completion of finished goods recorded as Finished Goods Control The backflush approach described closely approximates the costs computed using sequential tracking. There is no work in process so there is no need for a Work in Process inventory account. Further, by maintaining a Materials and In-Process Inventory Control and Finished Goods Control account, Glendale can keep track of and control the inventories of direct materials and finished goods in its plant. 2a. Glendale should adopt a backflush costing system with trigger points at completion of finished goods and at the sale of finished goods. This would approximate the sequential tracking approach since the question assumes Glendale has no direct materials or work-in-process inventories. There is, therefore, no need for these inventory accounts. b. A backflush costing system with two trigger pointswhen purchases of direct materials are made (debited to Inventory Control), and when Finished Goods are soldwould approximate sequential tracking, since the question assumes Glendale has no work-in-process or finished goods inventories. c. A backflush costing system with a single trigger point when finished goods are sold would approximate sequential tracking, since the question assumes Glendale has no direct material, work-in-process or finished goods inventories. This is a further simplification of the examples in the text. The principle here is that backflushing of costs should be triggered at the finished goods inventory stage if Glendale plans to hold finished goods inventory. If Glendale plans to hold no finished goods inventory, backflushing can be postponed until the finished goods are sold. In other words, the trigger points for backflushing relate to the points where inventory is being accumulated. As a result, backflushing matches the sequential tracking approach and also maintains a record for the monitoring and control of the inventory. 3. Some comments on the quotation follow: a. The backflush system is a standard costing system, not an actual costing system. b. If standard costing is used, an up-to-date, realistic set of standard costs is always desirableas long as the set meets the cost-benefit test of updating. c. The operating environments of the present JIT era have induced many companies toward more simplicity (backflush) and abandoning the typical standard costing system (sequential tracking). d. Backflush is probably closer to being a periodic system than a perpetual system. However, a periodic system may be cost-effective, particularly where physical inventories are relatively low or stable. e. The textbook points out that, to be attractive, backflush costing should generate the same financial measurements as sequential trackingand at a lower accounting cost. f. The choice of a product costing system is highly contextual. Its characteristics should be heavily affected by its costs, the preferences of operating managers, and the underlying operating processes. Sweeping generalizations about any cost accounting system or technique are unjustified. 20-24

CHAPTER 21 CAPITAL BUDGETING AND COST ANALYSIS 21-1 No. Capital budgeting focuses on an individual investment project throughout its life, recognizing the time value of money. The life of a project is often longer than a year. Accrual accounting focuses on a particular accounting period, often a year, with an emphasis on income determination. 21-2 The five stages in capital budgeting are the following: 1. An identification stage to determine which types of capital investments are available to accomplish organization objectives and strategies. 2. An information-acquisition stage to gather data from all parts of the value chain in order to evaluate alternative capital investments. 3. A forecasting stage to project the future cash flows attributable to the various capital projects. 4. An evaluation stage where capital budgeting methods are used to choose the best alternative for the firm. 5. A financing, implementation and control stage to fund projects, get them under way and monitor their performance. 21-3 In essence, the discounted cash-flow method calculates the expected cash inflows and outflows of a project as if they occurred at a single point in time so that they can be aggregated (added, subtracted, etc.) in an appropriate way. This enables comparison with cash flows from other projects that might occur over different time periods. 21-4 No. Only quantitative outcomes are formally analyzed in capital budgeting decisions. Many effects of capital budgeting decisions, however, are difficult to quantify in financial terms. These nonfinancial or qualitative factors (for example, the number of accidents in a manufacturing plant or employee morale) are important to consider in making capital budgeting decisions. 21-5 Sensitivity analysis can be incorporated into DCF analysis by examining how the DCF of each project changes with changes in the inputs used. These could include changes in revenue assumptions, cost assumptions, tax rate assumptions, and discount rates. 21-6 The payback method measures the time it will take to recoup, in the form of expected future net cash inflows, the net initial investment in a project. The payback method is simple and easy to understand. It is a handy method when screening many proposals and particularly when predicted cash flows in later years are highly uncertain. The main weaknesses of the payback method are its neglect of the time value of money and of the cash flows after the payback period. 21-7 The accrual accounting rate-of-return (AARR) method divides an accrual accounting measure of average annual income of a project by an accrual accounting measure of investment. The strengths of the accrual accounting rate of return method are that it is simple, easy to understand, and considers profitability. Its weaknesses are that it ignores the time value of money and does not consider the cash flows for a project.
21-1
21-8 No. The discounted cash-flow techniques implicitly consider depreciation in rate of return computations; the compound interest tables automatically allow for recovery of investment. The net initial investment of an asset is usually regarded as a lump-sum outflow at time zero. Where taxes are included in the DCF analysis, depreciation costs are included in the computation of the taxable income number that is used to compute the tax payment cash flow. 21-9 A point of agreement is that an exclusive attachment to the mechanisms of any single method examining only quantitative data is likely to result in overlooking important aspects of a decision. Two points of disagreement are (1) DCF can incorporate those strategic considerations that can be expressed in financial terms, and (2) Practical considerations of strategy not expressed in financial terms can be incorporated into decisions after DCF analysis. 21-10 All overhead costs are not relevant in NPV analysis. Overhead costs are relevant only if the capital investment results in a change in total overhead cash flows. Overhead costs are not relevant if total overhead cash flows remain the same but the overhead allocated to the particular capital investment changes. 21-11 The Division Y manager should consider why the Division X project was accepted and the Division Y project rejected by the president. Possible explanations are: a. The president considers qualitative factors not incorporated into the IRR computation and this leads to the acceptance of the X project and rejection of the Y project. b. The president believes that Division Y has a history of overstating cash inflows and understating cash outflows. c. The president has a preference for the manager of Division X over the manager of Division Ythis is a corporate politics issue. Factor a. means qualitative factors should be emphasized more in proposals. Factor b. means Division Y needs to document whether its past projections have been relatively accurate. Factor c. means the manager of Division Y has to play the corporate politics game better. 21-12 The categories of cash flow that should be considered in an equipment-replacement decision are: 1a. Initial machine investment, b. Initial working-capital investment, c. After-tax cash flow from current disposal of old machine, 2a. Annual after-tax cash flow from operations (excluding the depreciation effect), b. Income tax cash savings from annual depreciation deductions, 3a. After-tax cash flow from terminal disposal of machines, and b. After-tax cash flow from terminal recovery of working-capital investment. 21-13 Income taxes can affect the cash inflows or outflows in a motor vehicle replacement decision as follows: a. Tax is payable on gain or loss on disposal of the existing motor vehicle, b. Tax is payable on any change in the operating costs of the new vehicle vis--vis the existing vehicle, and c. Tax is payable on gain or loss on the sale of the new vehicle at the project termination date. d. Additional depreciation deductions for the new vehicle result in tax cash savings.

21-14 A cellular telephone company manager responsible for retaining customers needs to consider the expected future revenues and the expected future costs of different investments to retain customers. One such investment could be a special price discount. An alternative investment is offering loyalty club benefits to long-time customers. 21-15 These two rates of return differ in their elements: Real-rate of return 1. Risk-free element 2. Business-risk element Nominal rate of return 1. Risk-free element 2. Business-risk element 3. Inflation element
The inflation element is the premium above the real rate of return that is demanded for the anticipated decline in the general purchasing power of the monetary unit. 21-16 Exercises in compound interest, no income taxes. The answers to these exercises are printed after the last problem, at the end of the chapter. 21-17 (2225 min.) Capital budget methods, no income taxes. 1a. The table for the present value of annuities (Appendix B, Table 4) shows: 5 periods at 12% = 3.605 Net present value = $60,000 (3.605) $160,000 = $216,300 $160,000 = $56,300 1b. 1c.

Note how the accrual accounting rate of return, whichever way calculated, can produce results that differ markedly from the internal rate of return. 2. Other than the NPV, rate of return and the payback period on the new computer system, factors that Riverbend should consider are: Issues related to the financing the project, and the availability of capital to pay for the system. The effect of the system on employee morale, particularly those displaced by the system. Salesperson expertise and real-time help from experienced employees is key to the success of a hardware store. The benefits of the new system for customers (faster checkout, fewer errors). The upheaval of installing a new computer system. Its useful life is estimated to be 5 years. This means that Riverbend could face this upheaval again in 5 years. Also ensure that the costs of training and other hidden start-up costs are included in the estimated $160,000 cost of the new computer system.

The cash inflow occurs at the end of year
c. Increase in internal rate of return. The $10,000 terminal disposal price would raise the IRR because of the additional inflow. d. The AARR would increase because accrual accounting income in year 10 would increase by the $7,000 ($10,000 gain from disposal 30% $10,000) after-tax gain on disposal of equipment. This increase in year 10 income would result in higher average annual AARR in the numerator of the AARR formula.

Plan III has the lowest net present value cost. Plan III is the preferred one on financial criteria. Factors to consider, in addition to NPV, are: a. Financial factors including: Competing demands for cash. Availability of financing for project. b. Nonfinancial factors including: Risk of building contractor not remaining solvent. Plan II exposes New Bio most if the contractor becomes bankrupt before completion because it requires more of the cash to be paid earlier. Ability to have leverage over the contractor if quality problems arise or delays in construction occur. Plans I and III give New Bio more negotiation strength by being able to withhold sizable payment amounts if, say, quality problems arise in Year 1. Investment alternatives available. If New Bio has capital constraints, the new building project will have to compete with other projects for the limited capital available.

21-22 (30 min.) Payback and NPV methods, no income taxes. 1a. Payback measures the time it will take to recoup, in the form of expected future cash flows, the net initial investment in a project. Payback emphasizes the early recovery of cash as a key aspect of project ranking. Some managers argue that this emphasis on early recovery of cash is appropriate if there is a high level of uncertainty about future cash flows. Projects with shorter paybacks give the organization more flexibility because funds for other projects become available sooner.
Strengths Easy to understand One way to capture uncertainty about expected cash flows in later years of a project (although sensitivity analysis is a more systematic way) Weaknesses Fails to incorporate the time value of money Does not consider a projects cash flows after the payback period
1b. Project A Outflow, $3,000,000 Inflow, $1,000,000 (Year 1) + $1,000,000 (Year 2) + $1,000,000 (Year 3) + $1,000,000 (Year 4) Payback = 3 years
Project B
Outflow, $1,500,000 Inflow, $400,000 (Year 1) + $900,000 (Year 2) + $800,000 (Year 3) Payback = 2 years + ($1,500,000 $400,000 $900,000) = 2.25 years $800,000
21-11
Project C
Outflow, $4,000,000 Inflow, $2,000,000 (Year 1) + $2,000,000 (Year 2) + $200,000 (Year 3) + $100,000 (Year 4) Payback = 2 years Payback Period 2 years 2.25 years 3 years
1. Project C 2. Project B 3. Project A
If payback period is the deciding factor, Andrews will choose Project C (payback period = 2 years; investment = $4,000,000) and Project B (payback period = 2.25 years; investment = $1,500,000), for a total capital investment of $5,500,000. Assuming that each of the projects is an all-or-nothing investment, Andrews will have $500,000 left over in the capital budget, not enough to make the $3,000,000 investment in Project A. 2. Solution Exhibit 21-22 shows the following ranking: NPV $ 207,800 $ 169,000 $(311,500)
1. Project B 2. Project A 3. Project C
3. Using NPV rankings, Projects B and A, which require a total investment of $3,000,000 + $1,500,000 = $4,500,000, which is less than the $6,000,000 capital budget, should be funded. This does not match the rankings based on payback period because Projects B and A have substantial cash flows after the payback period, cash flows that the payback period ignores. Nonfinancial qualitative factors should also be considered. For example, are there differential worker safety issues across the projects? Are there differences in the extent of learning that can benefit other projects? Are there differences in the customer relationships established with different projects that can benefit Andrews Construction in future projects?

By interpolation: Internal rate of return $2,738 = 16% + 2% $2,738 $7, 427 = 16% + (0.2693 2%) = 16.54% 3. Accrual accounting rate of return based on net initial investment: Net initial investment = $137,500 + $10,000 = $147,500 Annual depreciation ($137,500 $37,500) 8 years = $12,500 Accrual accounting rate of return = $31,250 $12,500 = 12.71%. $147,500
4. If your decision is based on the DCF model, the purchase would be made because the net present value is positive, and the 16.54% internal rate of return exceeds the 14% required rate of return. However, you may believe that your performance may actually be measured using accrual accounting. This approach would show a 12.71% return on the initial investment, which is below the required rate. Your reluctance to make a buy decision would be quite natural unless you are assured of reasonable consistency between the decision model and the performance evaluation method.

a. Solution Exhibit 21-24A shows the NPV computation. NPV = $7,013 b. Payback = $88,000 $29,600 = 2.97 years c. Solution Exhibits 21-24B and 21-24C report the net present value of the project using 14% (small positive NPV) and 16% (small negative NPV). The IRR, the discount rate at which the NPV of the cash flows is zero, must lie between 14% and 16%. By interpolation: $763 Internal rate of return = 16% ? 2% $763 $2,960 = 15.59% 2. Both the net present value and internal rate of return methods use a discounted cash flow approach in which all expected future cash inflows and cash outflows of a project are measured as if they occurred at a single point in time. The payback method considers only cash flows up to the time when the expected future cash inflows recoup the net initial investment in a project. The payback method ignores profitability and the time value of money. However, the payback method is becoming increasingly important in the global economy. When the local environment in an international location is unstable and therefore highly risky for a potential investment, a company would likely pay close attention to the payback period for making its investment decision. In general, the more unstable the environment, the shorter the payback period desired.

 0.003 Internal rate of return = 26% + (2%) = 26.06%. 0.103 2. Both the net present value and internal rate of return methods use the discounted cash flow approach in which all expected future cash inflows and outflows of a project are measured as if they occurred at a single point in time. The net present value approach computes the surplus generated by the project in todays dollars while the internal rate of return attempts to measure its effective return on investment earned by the project. The payback method, by contrast, considers nominal cash flows (without discounting) and measures the time at which the projects expected future cash inflows recoup the net initial investment in a project. The payback method thus ignores the profitability of the projects entire stream of future cash flows.

Option 2 has the advantage of Crossroad having a closer relationship with the supplier. However, it limits Crossroads flexibility if Austin Corporations quality is not comparable to competitors. Option 3 has Crossroad entering a new line of business. If this line of business is successful, it could be expanded to cover souvenir jackets for other major events. The risks of selling the predicted number of jackets should also be considered.

4. Using the payback period, the modernize alternative is preferred to the replace alternative. On the other hand, the replace alternative has a higher NPV than the modernize alternative and so should be preferred. However, the NPV amounts are based on best estimates. Pro Chips should examine the sensitivity of the NPV amounts to variations in the estimates. Nonfinancial qualitative factors should be considered. These could include the quality of the prototypes produced by the modernize and replace alternatives. These alternatives may differ in capacity and their ability to meet surges in demand beyond the estimated amounts. The alternatives may also differ in how workers increase their shop floor-capabilities. Such differences could provide labor force externalities that can be the source of future benefits to Pro Chips.

On the basis of NPV, Pro Chips should modernize rather than replace the equipment. Note that absent taxes, the replace alternative had a higher NPV than the modernize alternative. In making decisions, companies should always consider after-tax amounts. 3. Pro Chips would prefer to: a. have lower tax rates, b. have revenue exempt from taxation, c. recognize taxable revenues in later years rather than earlier years, d. recognize taxable cost deductions greater than actual outlay costs, and e. recognize cost deductions in earlier years rather than later years (including accelerated amounts in earlier years).

3. Sensitivity analysis enables management to see those assumptions for which input variations have sizable impact on NPV. Extra resources could be devoted to getting more informed estimates of those inputs with the greatest impact on NPV. Sensitivity analysis also enables management to have contingency plans in place if assumptions are not met. For example, if a 5% reduction in selling price is viewed as occurring with 0.40 probability, management may wish to line up bank loan facilities.

21-30 (45 min.) NPV, IRR and sensitivity analysis. 1. Net Present Value of project: Period 0 Cash inflows Cash outflows Net cash flows $(42,000) $(42,000) 1 - 10 $23,000 (16,000) $ 7,000 $ 7,000 7.36 $51,520 (42,000) $ 9,520
Annual net cash inflows Present value factor for annuity, 10 periods, 6% Present value of net cash inflows Initial investment Net present value
To find IRR, first divide the initial investment by the net annual cash inflow: $42,000 $7,000 = 6.0. The 6.0 represents the present value factor for a ten-period project with the given cash flows, so look in Table 4, Appendix B for the present value of an annuity in arrears to find the factor closest to 6.0 along the ten period row. You should find that it is between 10% and 12%. The internal rate of return can be calculated by interpolation: Present Value Factors for Annuity of $1 for 10 years 6.145 6.145 6.000 5.650 __ 0.495 0.145
10% IRR 12% Difference
 0.145 Internal rate of return = 10% + (2%) = 10.6%. 0.495 Note: You can use a calculator or excel to find the IRR, and you will get an answer of approximately 10.56%. 2. If revenues are 10% higher, the new Net Present Value will be:

The NPV is positive, so they should accept this project. Of course, this result is to be expected since in requirement 1, the IRR was determined to be 10.6%. Therefore, for any discount rate less than 10.6%, the NPV of the stream of cash flows will be positive. 5. The sensitivity analysis shows that the return on the project is sensitive to changes in the projected revenues and costs. However, for almost all situations, the NPV has been positive and the IRR has been greater than the required rate of return. The one exception is the case where the revenues decline by 10%, but the costs do not. Overall, the project appears to be a good one for Crumbly Cookie, provided that the likelihood of the scenario where revenues decline substantially but costs do not is not too high.

The cumulative amount exceeds the initial $159,000 investment for the first time at the end of year 6. So, payback happens in year 6. Using linear interpolation, a more precise measure is that payback happens at: $159,000 - $114,000 5 years + 5.68 years. $66,000

Let $X be the additional recurring after-tax cash operating savings required each year to make NPV = $0. The present value of an annuity of $1 per year for 4 years discounted at 16% = 2.798 (Appendix B, Table 4) To make NPV = 0, Smacker needs to generate cash savings with NPV of $31,202. That is $X (2.798) = $31,202 X = 31,202 2.798 = $11,152

2. Accrual accounting rate of return (AARR): The accrual accounting rate of return takes the annual accrual net income after tax and divides by the initial investment to get a return. Incremental net operating income excluding depreciation Less: Depreciation expense ($320,000 6) Income before tax Income tax expense (at 40%) Net income per period AARR = $28,000 $325,000 = 8.62%. 3. Nate will not accept the project if he is being evaluated on the basis of accrual accounting rate of return, because the project does not meet the 10% threshold above which Nate earns a bonus. However, Nate should accept the project if he wants to act in the firms best interest because the NPV is positive, implying that, based on the cash flows generated, the project exceeds the firms required 10% rate of return. Thus, Nate will turn down an acceptable long-run project to avoid a poor evaluation based on the measure used to evaluate his performance. To remedy this, the firm could evaluate Nate instead on a project-by-project basis, by looking at how well he achieves the cash flows forecasted when he chose to accept the project. $100,000 53,333 46,667 18,667 $ 28,000

21-34 (35 min.) Recognizing cash flows for capital investment projects. 1. Partitioning relevant cash flows into categories: (1) Net initial investment cash flows: - The $98,000 cost of the new Flab-Buster 3000 - The disposal value of the old machine, $5,000, is a cash inflow - The book value of the old machine $4,000 ($50,000 $46,000), relative to the disposal value of $5,000, yields a taxable gain of $1,000 ($5,000 $4,000) that leads to a cash outflow for taxes of $1,000 Tax Rate (2) Cash flow savings from operations: - The 30% savings in utilities cost per year of $4,320 (30% $1,200 per month 12 months) results in cash inflow from operations after tax of $4,320 (1 Tax Rate) - The savings of half the maintenance costs per year of $5,000 (50% $10,000) results in a cash inflow from operations after tax of $5,000 (1 Tax Rate) - Annual depreciation of ($98,000 $10,000) 10 years = $8,800 on Flab-Buster 3000, relative to the ($4,000 $0) 10 years = $400 depreciation on current Fit-OMatic leads to additional tax savings of $8,400 Tax Rate (3) Cash flows from terminal disposal of investment: - The $10,000 salvage value of Flab-Buster 3000 minus the $0 salvage value of the old Fit-O-Matic is a terminal cash flow at the end of Year 10. There are no tax effects because both machines are planned to be disposed of at book value. (4) Data not relevant to the capital budgeting decision: - The $10 charge for customers, since it would not change whether or not Ludmilla got the new machine - The $78,000 cost of the machine Ludmilla does not intend to buy - The $50,000 original cost of the Fit-O-Matic machine

With inflation, we adjust each years cash flow for the inflation rate to get nominal cash flows and then discount each cash flow separately using the nominal discount rate.

2. As in the previous problem, with inflation, we adjust each years cash flow for the inflation rate to get nominal cash flows and then discount each cash flow separately using the nominal discount rate. Nominal rate = (1 + real rate) ? (1 + inflation rate) ?1 = (1.10)(1.055) 1 = 1.16 1 = 0.16 or 16%

3. Without the effects of inflation, we get a negative net present value. When cash flows are adjusted for inflation, we again get a negative net present value. In either case, regardless of inflation expectations, Cost-Less should not buy the new cash registers. 21-44
21-38 (45 min.) Net present value, Internal Rate of Return, Sensitivity Analysis. 1. Given the annual operating cash outflows of $160,000 and the payment of 10% of revenues (10% $260,000 = $26,000), the net cash inflows for each period are as follows: Period 0 Cash inflows Cash outflows Net cash inflows $(500,000) $(500,000) 1 - 12 $260,000 (186,000) $ 74,000
The NPV of the investment is: Annual net cash inflows Present value factor for annuity, 12 periods, 8% Present value of net cash inflows Initial investment Net present value $ 74,000 7.536 $557,664 (500,000) $ 57,664
And the IRR will be: $500,000 $74,000 = present value factor of 6.76, yielding a return just over 10% from the table, or using a calculator, a return of 10.17%. 2. For revenues of $240,000, the cash flows and NPV computation are given below. Period 0 Cash inflows Cash outflows Net cash inflows $(500,000) $(500,000) 1 - 12 $240,000 (184,000) $ 56,000

And the IRR will be: $500,000 $38,000 = present value factor of 13.16, yielding a return of less than 2% from the table or 1.35% using a calculator. 3. For revenues of $240,000, lower costs of $150,000, and payments of only 6% of revenues equal to $14,400: Period 0 Cash inflows Cash outflows Net cash inflows $(500,000) $(500,000) 1 - 12 $240,000 (164,400) $ 75,600 $ 75,600 7.536 $569,722 (500,000) $ 69,722

And the IRR will be: 500,000 75,600 = present value factor of 6.61, yielding a return between 10% and 12% from the table, or using a calculator, a return of 10.61%.
21-46
For revenues of $220,000, lower costs of $150,000, and payments of only 6% of revenues equal to 13,200: Period 0 1 - 12 Cash inflows $220,000 Cash outflows $(500,000) (163,200) Net cash inflows $(500,000) $ 56,800 Annual net cash inflows Present value factor for annuity, 12 periods, 8% Present value of net cash inflows Initial investment Net present value $ 56,800 7.536 $428,045 (500,000) $ (71,955)
And the IRR will be: 500,000 56,800 = present value factor of 8.80, yielding a return between 4% and 6% from the table, or using a calculator, a return of 5.12%. 4. Under the scenario of higher costs, Francesca will only be well off making the investment if she can reach the sales revenue goal of $260,000. Otherwise she will earn less than her desired return of 8%. In fact, her return at the lower revenue scenarios will be below 6%, her cost of capital (see the IRR calculations). If Francesca is able to lower the operating costs to $150,000 and pay out a smaller share of her revenues, the project will be profitable unless she only reaches the revenue level of $220,000; in that case, she will fall short not only of her desired return, but also her cost of capital of 6%. In summary, unless Francesca is either fairly certain to reach the $260,000 revenue level or fairly certain to lower her costs, it is advised that she not make the investment. It is not necessary to redo the NPV with different interest rates if you already calculated the IRR, since the IRR will not change with changes in desired rate of return. All you need to do is compare the IRR of the project to different desired returns if you are changing the required rate of return and not the cash flows themselves.

CHAPTER 22 MANAGEMENT CONTROL SYSTEMS, TRANSFER PRICING, AND MULTINATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 22-1 A management control system is a means of gathering and using information to aid and coordinate the planning and control decisions throughout an organization and to guide the behavior of its managers and employees. The goal of the system is to improve the collective decisions within an organization. 22-2 To be effective, management control systems should be (a) closely aligned to an organization&apos;s strategies and goals, (b) designed to support the organizational responsibilities of individual managers, and (c) able to motivate managers and employees to put in effort to attain selected goals desired by top management. 22-3 Motivation combines goal congruence and effort. Motivation is the desire to attain a selected goal specified by top management (the goal-congruence aspect) combined with the resulting pursuit of that goal (the effort aspect). 22-4 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The chapter cites five benefits of decentralization: Creates greater responsiveness to local needs Leads to gains from faster decision making Increases motivation of subunit managers Assists management development and learning Sharpens the focus of subunit managers
The chapter cites four costs of decentralization: 1. Leads to suboptimal decision making 2. Focuses managers attention on the subunit rather than the company as a whole 3. Increases costs of gathering information 4. Results in duplication of activities 22-5 No. Organizations typically compare the benefits and costs of decentralization on a function-by-function basis. For example, companies with highly decentralized operating divisions frequently have centralized income tax strategies. 22-6 No. A transfer price is the price one subunit of an organization charges for a product or service supplied to another subunit of the same organization. The two segments can be cost centers, profit centers, or investment centers. For example, the allocation of service department costs to production departments that are set up as either cost centers or investment centers is an example of transfer pricing. 22-7 The three general methods for determining transfer prices are: 1. Market-based transfer prices 2. Cost-based transfer prices 3. Negotiated transfer prices
22-
22-8 1. 2. 3. 4.
Transfer prices should have the following properties. They should promote goal congruence, be useful for evaluating subunit performance, motivate management effort, and preserve a high level of subunit autonomy in decision making.
22-9 No, the chapter illustration demonstrates how division operating incomes differ dramatically under the variable costs, full costs, and market price methods of transfer pricing. 22-10 Transferring products or services at market prices generally leads to optimal decisions when (a) the market for the intermediate product market is perfectly competitive, (b) interdependencies of subunits are minimal, and (c) there are no additional costs or benefits to the company as a whole from buying or selling in the external market instead of transacting internally. 22-11 One potential limitation of full-cost-based transfer prices is that they can lead to suboptimal decisions for the company as a whole. An example of a conflict between divisional action and overall company profitability resulting from an inappropriate transfer-pricing policy is buying products or services outside the company when it is beneficial to overall company profitability to source them internally. This situation often arises where full-cost-based transfer prices are used. This situation can make the fixed costs of the supplying division appear to be variable costs of the purchasing division. Another limitation is that the supplying division may not have sufficient incentives to control costs if the full-cost-based transfer price uses actual costs rather than standard costs. The purchasing division sources externally if market prices are lower than full costs. From the viewpoint of the company as a whole, the purchasing division should source from outside only if market prices are less than variable costs of production, not full costs of production. 22-12 Reasons why a dual-pricing approach to transfer pricing is not widely used in practice include: 1. In this approach, the manager of the supplying division uses a cost-based method to record revenues and does not have sufficient incentives to control costs. 2. This approach does not provide clear signals to division managers about the level of decentralization top management wants. 3. This approach tends to insulate managers from the frictions of the marketplace because costs, not market prices, affect the revenues of the supplying division. 4. It leads to problems in computing the taxable income of subunits located in different tax jurisdictions. 22-13 Disagree. Cost and price information are often useful starting points in the negotiation process. Costs, particularly variable costs of the selling division, serve as a floor below which the selling division would be unwilling to sell. Prices that the buying division would pay to purchase products from the outside market serves as a ceiling above which the buying division would be unwilling to buy. The price negotiated by the two divisions will, in general, have no specific relationship to either costs or prices. But the negotiated price will generally fall between the variable costs-based floor and the market price-based ceiling.
22-
22-14 Yes. The general transfer-pricing guideline specifies that the minimum transfer price equals the incremental cost per unit incurred up to the point of transfer plus the opportunity cost per unit to the supplying division. When the supplying division has idle capacity, its opportunity cost per unit is zero; when the supplying division has no idle capacity, its opportunity cost per unit is positive. Hence, the minimum transfer price will vary depending on whether the supplying division has idle capacity or not. 22-15 Alternative transfer-pricing methods can result in sizable differences in the reported operating income of divisions in different income tax jurisdictions. If these jurisdictions have different tax rates or deductions, the net income of the company as a whole can be affected by the choice of the transfer-pricing method. 22-16 (15 min.) Management control systems, balanced scorecard. Greystone follows a low-cost strategy that emphasizes high quality, timeliness, and a multiskilled workforce. Accordingly, Greystone should adopt financial and non-financial performance measures in its balanced scorecard that support this strategy. Examples of performance measures in each perspective are identified below. Financial perspective Revenue growth Operating income from productivity gain Operating income, EVA, ROI Gross margin percentage Growth in market share Customer satisfaction ratings Customer response time Number of customer complaints Number of new customers Yield Percent of defective tiles Manufacturing cycle efficiency On-time delivery Number of design and process changes made Employee turnover Employee satisfaction ratings Percent of employees trained in quality management Hours of training Percent of compensation based on team incentives Information systems availability

22-17 (25 min.) Cost centers, profit centers, decentralization. 1. The Glass Department sends its product to the Wood and Metal Departments for finishing. The Glass Department does not negotiate internal prices. The Glass, Wood and Metal Departments are cost centers because they are only evaluated on output and cost control (cost variances). 2. The three departments are centralized because upper management dictates their production schedules. 3. A centralized department can be a profit center. Centralization relates to the degree of autonomy that a department has for decision making. This concept is independent of the type of responsibility center used to evaluate performance (for example the Glass Department could be a profit center if upper management chooses a transfer price for the glass transferred from the Glass to the Wood and Metal Departments). A department may be organized as a profit center but it will be centralized if it has little freedom in making decisions. 4. a) With these changes, Fenster will be moving toward a more decentralized environment because each department will have more local decision-making authority, such as the ability to set its own production schedule, buy and sell products in the external market and negotiate transfer prices. These changes also make all three departments profit centers (rather than cost centers) because the managers of each department are responsible for both costs and revenues. b) I would recommend that upper management evaluate the three departments as profit centers because profits would be a good indicator of how well each department is doing.
22-
22-18 (15 min.) Decentralization, goal congruence, responsibility centers. 1. The environmental-management group appears to be decentralized because its managers have considerable freedom to make decisions. They can choose which projects to work on and which projects to reject. Top management will adjust the size of the environmental-management group to match the demand for the groups services by operating divisions. 2. The environmental-management group is a cost center. The group is required to charge the operating divisions for environmental services at cost and not at market prices that would help earn the group a profit. 3. The benefits of structuring the environmental-management group in this way are: a. The operating managers have incentives to carefully weigh and conduct cost-benefit analyses before requesting the environmental groups services. b. The operating managers have an incentive to follow the work and the progress made by the environmental team. c. The environmental group has incentives to fulfill the contract, to do a good job in terms of cost, time, and quality, and to satisfy the operating division to continue to get business. The problems in structuring the environmental-management group in this way are: a. The contract requires extensive internal negotiations in terms of cost, time, and technical specifications. b. The environmental group needs to continuously sell its services to the operating division, and this could potentially result in loss of morale. c. Experimental projects that have long-term potential may not be undertaken because operating division managers may be reluctant to undertake projects that are costly and uncertain, whose benefits will be realized only well after they have left the division. To the extent that the focus of the environmental-management group is on short-run projects demanded by the operating divisions, the current structure leads to goal congruence and motivation. Goal congruence is achieved because both operating divisions and the environmental-management group are motivated to work toward the organizational goals of reducing pollution and improving the environment. The operating divisions will be motivated to use the services of the environmental-management group to achieve the environmental goals set for them by top management. The environmental-management group will be motivated to deliver high-quality services in a cost-effective way to continue to create a demand for their services. The one issue that top management needs to guard against is that experimental projects with long-term potential that are costly and uncertain may not be undertaken under the current structure. Top management may want to set up a committee to study and propose such long-run projects for consideration and funding by corporate management.

$200 100 $100
$0 $ 0
$275 200 125 $ (50)
Since the Raw Lumber Division will be indifferent between selling the lumber in raw or finished form, it would be willing to maximize division operating income by selling raw lumber, which is the action preferred by the company as a whole. The Finished Lu mber Division will maximize division operating income by not further processing raw lumber and this is preferred by the company as a whole. Thus, transfer at market price will result in division actions that are also in the best interest of the company as a whole.

Bonus paid to division managers at 1% of division operating income will be as follows: Method A Internal Transfers at Market Prices Method B Internal Transfers at 110% of Full Costs $ 12,000 66,000
Mining Division managers bonus (1% $6,000,000; 1% $1,200,000) Metals Division managers bonus (1% $1,800,000; 1% $6,600,000)
$60,000 18,000
The Mining Division manager will prefer Method A (transfer at market prices) because this method gives $60,000 of bonus rather than $12,000 under Method B (transfers at 110% of full costs). The Metals Division manager will prefer Method B because this method gives $66,000 of bonus rather than $18,000 under Method A. 3. Brian Jones, the manager of the Mining Division, will appeal to the existence of a competitive market to price transfers at market prices. Using market prices for transfers in these conditions leads to goal congruence. Division managers acting in their own best interests make decisions that are also in the best interests of the company as a whole. Jones will further argue that setting transfer prices based on cost will cause Jones to pay no attention to controlling costs since all costs incurred will be recovered from the Metals Division at 110% of full costs.

(30 min.) Transfer pricing, general guideline, goal congruence.
1. Using the general guideline presented in the chapter, the minimum price at which the Airbag Division would sell airbags to the Tivo Division is $90, the incremental costs. The Airbag Division has idle capacity (it is currently working at 80% of capacity). Therefore, its opportunity cost is zerothe Airbag Division does not forgo any external sales and as a result, does not forgo any contribution margin from internal transfers. Transferring airbags at incremental cost achieves goal congruence. 2. Transferring products internally at incremental cost has the following properties: a. Achieves goal congruenceYes, as described in requirement 1 above. b. Useful for evaluating division performanceNo, because this transfer price does not cover or exceed full costs. By transferring at incremental costs and not covering fixed costs, the Airbag Division will show a loss. This loss, the result of the incremental cost-based transfer price, is not a good measure of the economic performance of the subunit. c. Motivating management effortYes, if based on budgeted costs (actual costs can then be compared to budgeted costs). If, however, transfers are based on actual costs, Airbag Division management has little incentive to control costs. d. Preserves division autonomyNo. Because it is rule-based, the Airbag Division has no say in the setting of the transfer price.
22-
3. If the two divisions were to negotiate a transfer price, the range of possible transfer prices will be between $90 and $125 per unit. The Airbag Division has excess capacity that it can use to supply airbags to the Tivo Division. The Airbag Division will be willing to supply the airbags only if the transfer price equals or exceeds $90, its incremental costs of manufacturing the airbags. The Tivo Division will be willing to buy airbags from the Airbag Division only if the price does not exceed $125 per airbag, the price at which the Tivo division can buy airbags in the market from external suppliers. Within the price range or $90 and $125, each division will be willing to transact with the other and maximize overall income of Quest Motors. The exact transfer price between $90 and $125 will depend on the bargaining strengths of the two divisions. The negotiated transfer price has the following properties. a. Achieves goal congruenceYes, as described above. b. Useful for evaluating division performanceYes, because the transfer price is the result of direct negotiations between the two divisions. Of course, the transfer prices will be affected by the bargaining strengths of the two divisions. c. Motivating management effortYes, because once negotiated, the transfer price is independent of actual costs of the Airbag Division. Airbag Division management has every incentive to manage efficiently to improve profits. d. Preserves subunit autonomyYes, because the transfer price is based on direct negotiations between the two divisions and is not specified by headquarters on the basis of some rule (such as Airbag Divisions incremental costs). 4. Neither method is perfect, but negotiated transfer pricing (requirement 3) has more favorable properties than the cost-based transfer pricing (requirement 2). Both transfer-pricing methods achieve goal congruence, but negotiated transfer pricing facilitates the evaluation of division performance, motivates management effort, and preserves division autonomy, whereas the transfer price based on incremental costs does not achieve these objectives.

22-23 (25 min.) Multinational transfer pricing, global tax minimization. 1. Solution Exhibit 22-23 shows the after-tax operating incomes earned by the U.S. and Austrian divisions from transferring 1,000 units of Product 4A36 using (a) full manufacturing cost per unit, and (b) market price of comparable imports as transfer prices. 2. There are many ways to proceed, but the first thing to note is that the transfer price that minimizes the total of company import duties and income taxes will be either the full manufacturing cost or the market price of comparable imports. Consider what happens every time the transfer price is increased by $1 over, say, the full manufacturing cost of $500. This results in the following: a. an increase in U.S. taxes of 40% $1 $0.400 b. an increase in import duties paid in Austria, 10% $1 0.100 c. a decrease in Austrian taxes of 44% $1.10 (the $1 increase in transfer price + $0.10 paid by way of import duty) (0.484) Net effect is an increase in import duty and tax payments of: $0.016 Hence, Mornay Company will minimize import duties and income taxes by setting the transfer price at its minimum level of $500, the full manufacturing cost. SOLUTION EXHIBIT 22-23 Division Incomes of U.S. and Austrian Divisions from Transferring 1,000 Units of Product 4A36 Method A Internal Transfers at Full Manufacturing Cost Method B Internal Transfers at Market Price

22-24 (30 min.) Multinational transfer pricing, goal congruence (continuation of 22-23). 1. After-tax operating income if Mornay Company sells all 1,000 units of Product 4A36 in the United States: Revenues, $600 1,000 units $600,000 Full manufacturing costs, $500 1,000 units 500,000 Operating income 100,000 Income taxes at 40% 40,000 After-tax operating income $ 60,000 From Exercise 22-23, requirement 1, Mornay Companys after-tax operating income if it transfers 1,000 units of Product 4A36 to Austria at full manufacturing cost and sells the units in Austria is $112,000. Therefore, Mornay should sell the 1,000 units in Austria. 2. Transferring Product 4A36 at the full manufacturing cost of the U.S. Division minimizes import duties and taxes (Exercise 22-23, requirement 2), but creates zero operating income for the U.S Division. Acting autonomously, the U.S. Division manager would maximize division operating income by selling Product 4A36 in the U.S. market, which results in $60,000 in aftertax division operating income as calculated in requirement 1, rather than by transferring Product 4A36 to the Austrian division at full manufacturing cost. Thus, the transfer price calculated in requirement 2 of Exercise 22-23 will not result in actions that are optimal for Mornay Company as a whole. 3. The minimum transfer price at which the U.S. division manager acting autonomously will agree to transfer Product 4A36 to the Austrian division is $600 per unit. Any transfer price less than $600 will leave the U.S. Division&apos;s performance worse than selling directly in the U.S. market. Because the U.S. Division can sell as many units that it makes of Product 4A36 in the U.S. market, there is an opportunity cost of transferring the product internally equal to $250 (selling price $600 variable manufacturing costs, $350). Minimum transfer = price per unit = Incremental cost per Opportunity cost per unit up to the point of unit to the selling transfer (U. S.) division $350 + $250 = $600
This transfer price will result in Mornay Company as a whole paying more import duties and taxes than the answer to Exercise 22-23, requirement 2, as calculated below:
U.S. Division Revenues, $600 1,000 units Full manufacturing costs Division operating income Division income taxes at 40% Division after-tax operating income
$600,000 500,000 100,000 40,000 $ 60,000

$750,000 600,000 60,000 90,000 39,600 $ 50,400
Total import duties and income taxes at transfer prices of $500 and $600 per unit for 1,000 units of Product 4A36 follow: Transfer Price of $500 per Unit (Exercise 22-23, Requirement 2) $ 0 50,000 88,000 $138,000

U.S. income taxes Austrian import duties Austrian income taxes
Transfer Price of $600 per Unit $ 40,000 60,000 39,600 $139,600
The minimum transfer price that the U.S. division manager acting autonomously would agree to results in Mornay Company paying $1,600 in additional import duties and income taxes. A student who has done the calculations shown in Exercise 22-23, requirement 2, can calculate the additional taxes from a $600 transfer price more directly, as follows: Every $1 increase in the transfer price per unit over $500 results in additional import duty and taxes of $0.016 per unit So, a $100 increase ($600 $500) per unit will result in additional import duty and taxes of $0.016 100 = $1.60 For 1,000 units transferred, this equals $1.60 1,000 = $1,600

22-25 (20 min.) Transfer-pricing dispute. This problem is similar to the Problem for Self-Study in the chapter. 1. Company as a whole will not benefit if Division C purchases from external suppliers: Purchase costs paid to external suppliers, 1,000 units $135 $135,000 Deduct: Savings in variable costs by reducing Division A output, 1,000 units $120 120,000 Net cost (benefit) to company as a whole as a result of purchasing from external suppliers $ 15,000
Any transfer price between $120 and $135 per unit will achieve goal congruence. Division managers acting in their own best interests will take actions that are in the best interests of the company as a whole. 2. Company as a whole will benefit if Division C purchases from external suppliers: Purchase costs paid to external suppliers, 1,000 units $135 $135,000 Deduct: Savings in variable costs, 1,000 units $120 $120,000 Savings due to As equipment and facilities assigned to other operations 18,000 138,000 Net cost (benefit) to company as a whole as a result of purchasing from external suppliers $ (3,000)
Division C should purchase from external suppliers. 3. Company as a whole will benefit if Division C purchases from external suppliers: Purchase costs paid to external suppliers, 1,000 units $115 $115,000 Deduct: Savings in variable costs by reducing Division A output, 1,000 units $120 120,000 Net cost (benefit) to company as a whole as a result of purchasing from external suppliers $ (5,000)
The three requirements are summarized below (in thousands): Purchase costs paid to external suppliers Relevant costs if purchased from Division A: Incremental (outlay) costs if purchased from Division A Opportunity costs if purchased from Division A Total relevant costs if purchased from Division A Operating income advantage (disadvantage) to company as a result of purchasing from Division A (1) $135 120 120 $ 15 (2) $135 120 18 138 $ (3) (3) $115 120 120 $ (5)

Transfer-pricing problem (continuation of 22-25).
The company as a whole would benefit in this situation if Division C purchased from external suppliers. The $15,000 disadvantage to the company as a whole as a result of purchasing from external suppliers would be more than offset by the $30,000 contribution margin of Division As sale of 1,000 units to other customers: Purchase costs paid to external suppliers, 1,000 units $135 Deduct variable cost savings, 1,000 units $120 Net cost to the company as a result of purchasing from external suppliers Division As sales to other customers, 1,000 units $155 Deduct: Variable manufacturing costs, $120 1,000 units Variable marketing costs, $5 1,000 units Total variable costs Contribution margin from selling units to other customers $135,000 120,000 $ 15,000 $155,000 $120,000 5,000 125,000 $ 30,000

22-27
(20min.) General guideline, transfer pricing.
1. The minimum transfer price that the SD would demand from the AD is the net price it could obtain from selling its screens on the outside market: $120 minus $5 marketing and distribution cost per screen, or $115 per screen. The SD is operating at capacity. The incremental cost of manufacturing each screen is $80. Therefore, the opportunity cost of selling a screen to the AD is the contribution margin the SD would forego by transferring the screen internally instead of selling it on the outside market. Contribution margin per screen = $115 $80 = $35 Using the general guideline, Incremental cost per Opportunity cost per Minimum transfer = screen inccurred up to + screen to the price per screen the point of transfer selling division = $80 + $35 = $115 2. The maximum transfer price the AD manager would be willing to offer SD is its own total cost for purchasing from outside, $120 plus $3 per screen, or $123 per screen. 3a. If the SD has excess capacity (relative to what the outside market can absorb), the minimum transfer price using the general guideline is: for the first 2,000 units (or 20% of output), $80 per screen because opportunity cost is zero; for the remaining 8,000 units (or 80% of output), $115 per screen because opportunity cost is $35 per screen. 3b. From the point of view of Shamrocks management, all of the SDs output should be transferred to the AD. This would avoid the $3 per screen variable purchasing cost that is incurred by the AD when it purchases screens from the outside market and it would also save the $5 marketing and distribution cost the SD would incur to sell each screen to the outside market. 3c. If the managers of the AD and the SD could negotiate the transfer price, they would settle on a price between $115 per screen (the minimum transfer price the SD will accept) and $123 per screen (the maximum transfer price the AD would be willing to pay). From requirements 1 and 2, we see that any price in this range would be acceptable to both divisions for all of the SDs output, and would also be optimal from Shamrocks point of view. The exact transfer price between $115 and $123 will depend on the bargaining strengths of the two divisions. Of course, Shamrock&apos;s management could also mandate a particular transfer price between $115 and $123 per screen.
22-
22-28 (2030 min.) Pertinent transfer price. This problem explores the general transfer-pricing guideline discussed in the chapter. 1. No, transfers should not be made to Division B if there is no unused capacity in Division A. An incremental (outlay) cost approach shows a positive contribution for the company as a whole: Selling price of final product Incremental cost per unit in Division A Incremental cost per unit in Division B Contribution margin per unit $300 $120 150 270 $ 30
However, if there is no excess capacity in Division A, any transfer will result in diverting products from the market for the intermediate product. Sales in this market result in a greater contribution for the company as a whole. Division B should not assemble the bicycle since the incremental revenue Europa can earn, $100 per unit ($300 from selling the final product $200 from selling the intermediate product) is less than the incremental cost of $150 to assemble the bicycle in Division B. Alternatively, Europas contribution margin from selling the intermediate product exceeds Europas contribution margin from selling the final product: Selling price of intermediate product Incremental (outlay) cost per unit in Division A Contribution margin per unit Using the general guideline described in the chapter, Minimum = transfer price Additional incremental cos t Opportunity cos t + per unit to the per unit incurred up to the point of transfer supplying division = $120 + ($200 $120) = $200, which is the market price $200 120 $ 80
The market price is the transfer price that leads to the correct decision; that is, do not transfer to Division B unless there are extenuating circumstances for continuing to market the final product. Therefore, Division B must either drop the product or reduce the incremental costs of assembly from $150 per bicycle to less than $100 (selling price, $300 transfer price, $200).
22-
2. If (a) A has excess capacity, (b) there is intermediate external demand for only 800 units at $200, and (c) the $200 price is to be maintained, then the opportunity costs per unit to the supplying division are $0. The general guideline indicates a minimum transfer price of: $120 + $0 = $120, which is the incremental or outlay costs for the first 200 units. B would buy 200 units from A at a transfer price of $120 because B can earn a contribution of $30 per unit [$300 ($120 + $150)]. In fact, B would be willing to buy units from A at any price up to $150 per unit because any transfers at a price of up to $150 will still yield B a positive contribution margin. Note, however, that if B wants more than 200 units, the minimum transfer price will be $200 as computed in requirement 1 because A will incur an opportunity cost in the form of lost contribution of $80 (market price, $200 outlay costs of $120) for every unit above 200 units that are transferred to B. The following schedule summarizes the transfer prices for units transferred from A to B: Units 0200 2001,000 Transfer Price $120$150 $200
For an exploration of this situation when imperfect markets exist, see the next problem. 3. Division B would show zero contribution, but the company as a whole would generate a contribution of $30 per unit on the 200 units transferred. Any price between $120 and $150 would induce the transfer that would be desirable for the company as a whole. A motivational problem may arise regarding how to split the $30 contribution between Division A and B. Unless the price is below $150, B would have little incentive to buy.
Note: The transfer price that may appear optimal in an economic analysis may, in fact, be totally unacceptable from the viewpoints of (1) preserving autonomy of the managers, and (2) evaluating the performance of the divisions as economic units. For instance, consider the simplest case discussed previously, where there is idle capacity and the $200 intermediate price is to be maintained. To direct that A should sell to B at As variable cost of $120 may be desirable from the viewpoint of B and the company as a whole. However, the autonomy (independence) of the manager of A is eroded. Division A will earn nothing, although it could argue that it is contributing to the earning of income on the final product. If the manager of A wants a portion of the total company contribution of $30 per unit, the question is: How is an appropriate amount determined? This is a difficult question in practice. The price can be negotiated upward to somewhere between $120 and $150 so that some equitable split is achieved. A dual transfer-pricing scheme has also been suggested, whereby the supplier gets credit for the full intermediate market price and the buyer is charged with only variable or incremental costs. In any event, when there is heavy interdependence between divisions, such as in this case, some system of subsidies may be needed to deal with the three problems of goal congruence, management effort, and subunit autonomy. Of course, where heavy subsidies are needed, a question can be raised as to whether the existing degree of decentralization is optimal.
22-
22-29 (3040 min.) Pricing in imperfect markets (continuation of 22-28). An alternative presentation, which contains the same numerical answers, can be found at the end of this solution. 1. Potential contribution from external intermediate sale is 1,000 ($195 $120) Contribution through keeping price at $200 is 800 $80. Forgone contribution by transferring 200 units
$75,000 64,000 $11,000
Opportunity cost per unit to the supplying division by transferring internally: $11,000 = $55 200 Transfer price = $120 + $55 = $175 An alternative approach to obtaining the same answer is to recognize that the incremental or outlay cost is the same for all 1,000 units in question. Therefore, the total revenue desired by A would be the same for selling outside or inside. Let X equal the transfer price at which Division A is indifferent between selling all units outside versus transferring 200 units inside. 1,000 $195 X = (800 $200) + 200X = $175
The $175 price will lead to the correct decision. Division B will not buy from Division A because its total costs of $175 + $150 will exceed its prospective selling price of $300. Division A will then sell 1,000 units at $195 to the outside; Division A and the company will have a contribution margin of $75,000. Otherwise, if 800 units were sold at $200 and 200 units were transferred to Division B, the company would have a contribution of $64,000 plus $6,000 (200 units of final product $30), or $70,000. A comparison might be drawn regarding the computation of the appropriate transfer prices between the preceding problem and this problem:
22-
 Additional incremental cos t Minimum = + per unit incurred up to the point of transfer transfer price 
 Opportunity cos t per unit to Division A 
Perfect markets: = $120 + (Selling price Outlay costs per unit) = $120 + ($200 $120) = $200 Imperfect markets: = $120 + Marginal revenues Outlay costs Number of units transferred $35,000 a $24,000 b = $175 200
= $120 +
aMarginal revenues of Division A from selling 200 units outside rather than transferring to Division B = ($195 1,000) ($200 800) = $195,000 $160,000 = $35,000. bIncremental (outlay) costs incurred by Division A to produce 200 units = $120 200 = $24,000.
Therefore, selling price ($195) and marginal revenues per unit ($175 = $35,000 200) are not the same. The following discussion is optional. These points should be explored only if there is sufficient class time: Some students may erroneously say that the new market price of $195 is the appropriate transfer price. They may claim that the general guideline says that the transfer price should be $120 + ($195 $120) = $195, the market price. This conclusion assumes a perfect market. However, in this case there are imperfections in the intermediate market. That is, the market price is not a good approximation of alternative revenue. If a divisions sales are heavy enough to reduce market prices, marginal revenue will be less than market price. It is true that either $195 or $175 will lead to the correct decision by B in this case. But suppose that Bs variable costs were $120 instead of $150. Then B would buy at a transfer price of $175 (but not at a price of $195, because then B would earn a negative contribution of $15 per unit [$300 ($195 + $120)]. Note that if Bs variable costs were $120, transfers would be desirable: Division A contribution is: [800 ($200 $120)] + [200 ($175 $120)] Division B contribution is: 200 [$300 ($175 + $120)] Total contribution
$75,000 1,000 $76,000
22-
Or the same facts can be analyzed for the company as a whole: Sales of intermediate product, 800 ($200 $120) Sales of final products, 200 [300 ($120 + $120)] Total contribution
= =
$64,000 12,000 $76,000
If the transfer price were $195, B would not accept the transfer and would not earn any contribution. As shown above, Division A and the company as a whole will earn a total contribution of $75,000 instead of $76,000. 2. a. Division A can sell 900 units at $195 to the outside market and 100 units to Division B, or 800 at $200 to the outside market and 200 units to Division B. Note that, under both alternatives, 100 units can be transferred to Division B at no opportunity cost to A. Using the general guideline, the minimum transfer price of the first 100 units [9011000] is: TP1 = $120 + 0 = $120 If Division B needs 100 additional units, the opportunity cost to A is not zero, because Division A will then have to sell only 800 units to the outside market for a contribution of 800 ($200 $120) = $64,000 instead of 900 units for a contribution of 900 ($195 $120) = $67,500. Each unit sold to B in addition to the first 100 units has an opportunity cost to A of ($67,500 $64,000) 100 = $35. Using the general guideline, the minimum transfer price of the next 100 units [801900] is: TP2 = $120 + $35 = $155 Alternatively, the computation could be: Increase in contribution from 100 more units, 100 $75 $7,500 Loss in contribution on 800 units, 800 ($80 $75) 4,000 Net&quot;marginal revenue&quot;$3,500 100 units = $35 (Minimum) transfer price applicable to first 100 units offered by A is $120 + $0 = (Minimum) transfer price applicable to next 100 units offered by A is $120 + ($3,500 100) = (Minimum) transfer price applicable to next 800 units =
$120 per unit $155 per unit $195 per unit

b. The manager of Division B will not want to purchase more than 100 units because the units at $155 would decrease his contribution ($155 + $150&gt;$300). Because the manager of Division B does not buy more than 100 units, the manager of Division A will have 900 units available for sale to the outside market. The manager of Division A will strive to maximize the contribution by selling them all at $195. This solution maximizes the company&apos;s contribution: 900 ($195 $120) 100 ($300 $270) which compares favorably to: 800 ($200 $120) 200 ($300 $270) = = $64,000 6,000 $70,000 = = $67,500 3,000 $70,500

2a.
At most, Division A can sell only 900 units and can produce 1,000. Therefore, at least 100 units should be transferred at a transfer price no less than $120. The question is whether or not a second 100 units should be transferred:

3. Bonus paid to division managers at 5% of division operating income is computed above and summarized below: Internal Transfers at 200% of Full Costs Harvesting Division managers bonus (5% $140,000; 5% $100,000) Processing Division managers bonus (5% $20,000; 5% $60,000) $7,000 Internal Transfers at Market Prices $5,000

$3,000
The Harvesting Division manager will prefer to transfer at 200% of full costs because this method gives a higher bonus. The Processing Division manager will prefer transfer at market price for its higher resulting bonus. Crango may resolve or reduce transfer pricing conflicts by: Basing division managers bonuses on overall Crango profits in addition to division operating income. This will motivate each manager to consider what is best for Crango overall and not be concerned with the transfer price alone. Letting the two divisions negotiate the transfer price between themselves. However, this may result in constant re-negotiation between the two managers each accounting period. Using dual transfer prices However, a cost-based transfer price will not motivate cost control by the Harvesting Division manager. It will also insulate that division from the discipline of market prices.

22-31 (25 min.) Goal congruence problems with cost-plus transfer-pricing methods, dual pricing system (continuation of 22-30). 1. Two examples of goal congruence problems that arise if a transfer price of 200% of full costs is mandated and Borges decentralization policy is adopted are: a. The Processing Division manager will prefer to buy cranberries from an external supplier at $0.60 per pound, incurring some extra purchasing costs and lowering Cranes overall operating income. Crango will incur costs of $0.60 per pound and save variable costs of only $0.10 per pound. b. The Harvesting Division manager is forced to sell to an outside purchaser (because the Processing Division prefers to purchase from an external supplier) when it is better for Crango Products to process internally. 2.
Transfer into buying division at market price Harvesting Division to Processing Division = $0.60 per pound of cranberries Transfer out of selling division at 200% of full costs Harvesting Division to Processing Division = 2.0 ($0.10 + $0.25) = $0.70 per pound of cranberries
As calculated in Requirement 2 of 22-30 and also shown below, under the dual transferpricing policy, the Harvesting Division will earn an operating income of $140,000 and the Processing Division will earn an operating income of $60,000. 200% of Full Costs Harvesting Division Revenues (400,000 lbs. $0.70 per lb.)

Under the dual transfer pricing policy, Division Operating Income Harvesting Division Processing Division Crango Products $140,000 60,000 $200,000
The overall company operating income from harvesting and processing 400,000 pounds of cranberries is $160,000 (see Problem 22-30, requirement 1). A dual transfer-pricing method entails using different transfer prices for transfers into the buying division and transfers out of the supplying division. As a result, the sum of division operating incomes does not equal the total company operating income. 4. Problems which may arise if Crango Products uses the dual transfer-pricing system include: a. b. c. It may reduce the incentives of the supplying division to control costs since every $1 of cost of the supplying division is transferred out to the buying division at $2.00. A dual transfer-pricing system does not provide clear signals to the individual divisions about the level of decentralization top management seeks. It insulates the Harvesting Division manager from the frictions and the discipline of the marketplace because costs, not market prices, affect the revenues of the supplying division.

22-32 (40 min.) Multinational transfer pricing, global tax minimization. This is a two-country two-division transfer-pricing problem with two alternative transfer-pricing methods. Summary data in U.S. dollars are:
South Africa Mining Division Variable costs: 560 ZAR 7 = $80 per lb. of raw diamonds Fixed costs: 1,540 ZAR 7 = $220 per lb. of raw diamonds Market price: 3,150 ZAR 7 = $450 per lb. of raw diamonds U.S. Processing Division Variable costs = $150 per lb. of polished industrial diamonds Fixed costs = $700 per lb. of polished industrial diamonds Market price = $5,000 per lb. of polished industrial diamonds
1. The transfer prices are: a. 200% of full costs Mining Division to Processing Division = 2.0 ($80 + $220) = $600 per lb. of raw diamonds b. Market price Mining Division to Processing Division = $450 per lb. of raw diamonds 200% of Full Cost Market Price

The South Africa Mining Division manager will prefer the higher transfer price of 200% of full cost and the U.S. Processing Division manager will prefer the lower transfer price equal to market price. Industrial Diamonds will maximize companywide net income by using the 200% of full cost transfer-pricing method. This method sources more of the total income in South Africa, the country with the lower income tax rate. 4. Factors that executives consider important in transfer pricing decisions include: a. Performance evaluation b. Management motivation c. Pricing and product emphasis d. External market recognition
Factors specifically related to multinational transfer pricing include: a. Overall income of the company b. Income or dividend repatriation restrictions c. Competitive position of subsidiaries in their respective markets

(3040 min.) International transfer pricing, taxes, goal congruence.
1. The minimum transfer price would be $82 to cover the variable production ($80 per unit) and shipping ($2 per unit) costs, because Calcia would want at a minimum zero contribution margin. The opportunity cost is $0 because there are no external customers for IP-2007. The maximum transfer price would be the $100 market price that Argone would need to pay to acquire a product similar to IP-2007 from the external market in the United States. 2. To minimize income taxes, Gemini should use a transfer price of $82. Canada has a higher tax rate so goods coming from Canada should have the lowest transfer price. Calcia would not like a transfer price of $82 because it would report no operating income from the transfer. Argone would like a transfer price of $82 because it is lower than the outside market price of $100. 3a. Calcias after-tax income on each unit from accepting the special order is: Revenue per unit $95.00 Variable cost per unit 80.00 Contribution margin per unit 15.00 Income taxes (0.38 $15) 5.70 Increase in division income per unit after tax $ 9.30
It is easiest to see the solution to this problem if we assume a selling price for the product that Argone manufactures, for example, $150. (The actual selling price you choose is irrelevant.) Argones after-tax income on each unit if Calcia accepts the special order and Argone buys the substitute product for IP-2007 in the United States for $100 per unit is: Revenue per unit $150 Variable cost per unit 100 Contribution margin per unit 50 Income taxes (0.20 $50) 10 Increase in division income per unit after tax $ 40 Geminis net income on each unit from Calcia accepting the special order is $9.30 + $40 = $49.30. If Calcia rejects the special order and instead transfers the units internally to Argone at $82 per unit, Calcias after-tax income would be: Revenue per unit $82 Variable cost per unit 82 Contribution margin per unit 0 Income taxes 0 Increase in division income per unit after tax $0 Argones after-tax income on each unit is: Revenue per unit Variable cost per unit Contribution margin per unit Income taxes (0.20 $68) Increase in division income per unit after tax
$150.00 82.00 68.00 13.60 $ 54.40
22-
Geminis net income on each unit as a result of Calcia rejecting the special order and transferring units of IP-2007 to Argone at $82 per unit is $54.40 per unit. Accepting the special order will not maximize after-tax operating income. After-tax operating income is maximized by rejecting the special order. 3b. Argone will not want Calcia to accept the special order. It is more costly to buy from the external market than from Calcia. 3c. Calcia will want to accept the special order because Calcias income per unit after-tax increases by $9.30 per unit by accepting the special order rather than transferring IP-2007 to Argone at $82 per unit and earning $0 operating income. 3d. Gemini should set the transfer price at $97 per unit. This will result in each division taking actions in its own best interest that is also in the best interest of Gemini as a whole acting as a decentralized organization. The opportunity cost of transferring IP-2007 internally is $15 ($95 $80) per unit for the first 10,000 units and $0 per unit thereafter. Using the general guideline, Minimum transfer Incremental cost per Opportunity cost per = unit inccurred up to + unit to the price the point of transfer selling subunit So, minimum transfer price = $82 $15 $97 per unit for the first 10,000 units $82 $0 $82 per unit for the next 10,000 units
Gemini should use these minimum transfer prices because they are also tax-efficient. At a transfer price of $97 per unit for the first 10,000 units, Calcia is indifferent between accepting the special order or transferring internally. Calcia earns $15 per unit if it accepts the special order. It also earns $15 per unit if it transfers IP-2007 to Argone ($97 - $82 variable cost per unit). Argone will prefer to buy IP-2007 from Calcia because the transfer price of $97 is less than the $100 price it would pay to buy a product similar to IP-2007 in the United States. The increase in Geminis income will be as follows: From Calcia: Revenue per unit Variable cost per unit Contribution margin per unit Income taxes (0.38 $15) Increase in division income per unit after tax From Argone: Revenue per unit Transfer price per unit Contribution margin per unit Income taxes (0.20 $53) Increase in division income per unit after tax Increase in Geminis income = $9.30 + $42.40 = $51.70 22-
$97.00 82.00 15.00 5.70 $ 9.30
$150.00 97.00 53.00 10.60 $ 42.40
This net income is greater than the $49.30 net income that Gemini would earn if Calcia accepted the special order. It is less than the $54.40 that Gemini would earn if Calcia had transferred IP-2007 at $82 per unit. Of course, if the transfer price is set at $82 per unit, Calcia would accept the special order, which would lead to a lower net income of $49.30. If Gemini wants to get the benefits of decentralization, it must be willing to suffer the consequences of higher taxes that Calcia would have to pay. Note that Gemini would not want to set the transfer price any higher than $97, the minimum transfer price that would induce Calcia to transfer internally to Argone. Why? Because setting the transfer price any higher would result in exactly the same action (transferring IP-2007 internally) but at a higher cost because of the higher taxes that Calcia would have to pay in Canada. Consider for example a transfer price of $99 per unit. The increase in Geminis income will be as follows: From Calcia: Revenue per unit $99.00 Variable cost per unit 82.00 Contribution margin per unit 17.00 Income taxes (0.38 $17) 6.46 Increase in division income per unit after tax $10.54 From Argone: Revenue per unit Transfer price per unit Contribution margin per unit Income taxes (0.20 $51) Increase in division income per unit after tax
$150.00 99.00 51.00 10.20 $ 40.80
Increase in Geminis income $10.54 + $40.80 = $51.34, which is less than the $51.70 Gemini earns if the transfer price is set at $97 per unit. A transfer price of $97 is the most tax-efficient transfer price consistent with Gemini operating as a decentralized organization. Note also that the transfer price cannot be set above $100 per unit because then Argone would buy a product similar to IP-2007 in the United States rather than from Calcia. This would result in a lower profit before tax and higher overall taxes because of the higher tax rate in Canada.

22-34 (30 min.) Transfer pricing, goal congruence. 1. See column (1) of Solution Exhibit 22-34. The net cost of the in-house option is $230,000.
2. See columns (2a) and (2b) of Solution Exhibit 22-34. As the calculations show, if Johnson Corporation offers a price of $38 per tape player, Orsilo Corporation should purchase the tape players from Johnson; this will result in an incremental net cost of $210,000 (column 2a). If Johnson Corporation offers a price of $45 per tape player, Orsilo Corporation should manufacture the tape players in-house; this will result in an incremental net cost of $230,000 (column 2b).

Comparing columns (1) and (2a), at a price of $38 per tape player from Johnson, the net cost of $210,000 is less than the net cost of $230,000 to Orsilo Corporation if it made the tape players in-house. So, Orsilo Corporation should outsource to Johnson. Comparing columns (1) and (2b), at a price of $45 per tape player from Johnson, the net cost of $280,000 is greater than the net cost of $230,000 to Orsilo Corporation if it made the tape players in-house. Therefore, Orsilo Corporation should reject Johnsons offer. Now consider column (2x) of Solution Exhibit 22-34. It shows that at a price of $40 per tape player from Johnson, the net cost is exactly $230,000, the same as the net cost to Orsilo Corporation of manufacturing in-house (column 1). Thus, for prices between $38 and $40, Orsilo
22-
will prefer to purchase from Johnson. For prices greater than $40 (and up to $45), Orsilo will prefer to manufacture in-house. 3. The Cassette Division can manufacture at most 12,000 tape players and it is currently operating at capacity. The incremental costs of manufacturing a tape player are $25 per unit. The opportunity cost of manufacturing tape players for the Assembly Division is (1) the contribution margin of $10 (selling price, $35 minus incremental costs $25) that the Cassette Division would forgo by not selling tape players in the outside market plus (2) the contribution margin of $5 (selling price, $20 minus incremental costs, $15) that the Cassette Division would forgo by not being able to sell the head mechanism to external suppliers of tape players such as Johnson (recall that the Cassette division can produce as many head mechanisms as demanded by external suppliers, but their demand will fall if the Cassette Division supplies the Assembly Division with tape players). Thus, the total opportunity cost to the Cassette Division of supplying tape players to Assembly is $10 + $5 = $15 per unit. Using the general guideline, cost per Minimum transfer = Incrementalup to per Opportunity costhe tape player the tape player to t price per tape player point of transfer selling division = $25 + $15 = $40 Thus, the minimum transfer price that the Cassette Division will accept for each tape player is $40. Note that at a price of $40, Orsilo is indifferent between manufacturing tape players inhouse or purchasing them from an external supplier. 4a. The transfer price is set to $40 + $1 = $41 and Johnson is offering the tape players for $40.50 each. Now, for an outside price per tape player below $41, the Assembly Division would prefer to purchase from outside; above it, the Assembly Division would prefer to purchase from the Cassette Division. So, the Assembly division will buy from Johnson at $40.50 each and the Cassette Division will be forced to sell its output on the outside market. 4b. But for Orsilo, as seen from requirements 1 and 2, an outside price of $40.50, which is greater than the $40 cut-off price, makes inhouse manufacture the optimal choice. So, a mandated transfer price of $41 causes the division managers to make choices that are suboptimal for Orsilo. 4c. When selling prices are uncertain, the transfer price should be set at the minimum acceptable transfer price. It is only if the price charged by the external supplier falls below $40 that Orsilo Corporation as a whole is better off purchasing from the outside market. Setting the transfer price at $40 per unit achieves goal congruence. The Cassette division will be willing to sell to the Assembly Division, and the Assembly Division will be willing to buy in-house and this would be optimal for Orsilo, too.

Benefit (3) = (2) (1) $20,000 (20,000) 0 20,000 $20,000
2. I would recommend a lump sum transfer of $40,000 (say) from Department B to Department A plus a transfer price equal to the variable cost per unit of $12 per unit. This would generate some operating income for Department A while Department A continues to make transfers at variable costs. Such a transfer pricing arrangement avoids the suboptimal decision making that can result from full cost transfer prices. Variable cost transfer prices often provide valuable information for decision making. The fixed payment is the price that Department B pays for using the capacity of Department A. 3. Asking the management accountant to reclassify costs is unethical. Lasker suggests that $14 per unit is a more appropriate variable cost per unit. However, he does not substantiate his claim with any costs that he thinks are misclassified. In fact, his variable cost per unit number seems arbitrary and specifically targeted to improve his transfer pricing negotiations. If that is the reason for his request and there is no fundamental problem with the current cost classifications, Bedford should not change the variable cost per unit. To do so would be unethical. To resolve this situation, Bedford should begin by explaining his decision to Lasker. If Lasker insists on using a higher variable cost per unit, then Bedford may need to alert Laskers supervisor in Whengons upper management.

22-36 (4050 min.) Transfer pricing, utilization of capacity. 1. Super-chip Selling price $60 Direct material cost per unit 2 Direct manufacturing labor cost per unit 28 Contribution margin per unit $30 Contribution margin per hour ($30 2; $4 0.5) $15 Okay-chip $12 1 7 $4 $8
Because the contribution margin per hour is higher for Super-chip than for Okay-chip, CIC should produce and sell as many Super-chips as it can and use the remaining available capacity to produce Okay-chip. The total demand for Super-chips is 15,000 units, which would take 30,000 hours (15,000 2 hours per unit). CIC should use its remaining capacity of 20,000 hours (50,000 30,000) to produce 40,000 Okay-chips (20,000 0.5). 2. Options for manufacturing process-control unit:
Using Using Circuit Board Super-chip Selling price $132 $132 Direct material cost per unit 60 2 Direct manufacturing labor cost per unit (Super-chip) 0 28 Direct manufacturing labor cost per unit (process-control unit) 50 60 Contribution margin per unit $ 22 $ 42 Overall Company Viewpoint
Alternative 1: No Transfer of Super-chips:
Sell 15,000 Super-chips at contribution margin per unit of $30 Transfer 0 Super-chips Sell 40,000 Okay-chips at contribution margin per unit of $4 Sell 5,000 Control units at contribution margin per unit of $22 Total contribution margin $450,000 0 160,000 110,000 $720,000
22-
Alternative 2: Transfer 5,000 Super-chips to Process-Control Division. These Super-chips would require 10,000 hours to manufacture, leaving only 10,000 hours for the manufacture of 20,000 Okay-chips (10,000 0.5):
Sell 15,000 Super-chips at contribution margin per unit of $30 Transfer 5,000 Super-chips to Process-Control Division Sell 20,000 Okay-chips at contribution margin per unit of $4 Sell 5,000 Control units at contribution margin per unit of $42 Total contribution margin $450,000 0 80,000 210,000 $740,000
CIC is better off transferring 5,000 Super-chips to the Process-Control Division. 3. For each Super-chip that is transferred, two hours of time (labor capacity) are given up in the Semiconductor Division, and, in those two hours, four Okay-chips could be produced, each contributing $4. Minimum transfer price = per Super - chip = = Incremental cost Opportunity cost per unit for per unit to + the Semiconductor Division the point of transfer $30 + $16 $46 per unit
If the selling price for the process-control unit were firm at $132, the Process-Control Division would accept any transfer price up to $50 ($60 price of circuit board $10 incremental labor cost if Super-chip used). However, consider what happens if the transfer price of Super-chip is set at, say, $49, and the price of the control unit drops to $108. From CICs viewpoint: Using Circuit Board Selling price $108 Direct material cost per unit 60 Direct manufacturing labor cost per unit 50 Contribution margin per unit $ 2 Using Using Super-chip $108 49 60 $ 1
Process-Control Division will not produce any control units. From the companys viewpoint, the contribution margin on the control unit if the Super-chip is used is: Selling price Direct material cost per unit Direct manufacturing labor cost per unit (Super-chip) Direct manufacturing labor cost per unit (process-control unit) Contribution margin per unit $108 2 28 60 $ 18
22-
The contribution margin per unit from producing Super-chips for the process-control unit exceeds the contribution margin of $16 from producing 4 Okay-chips, each yielding a contribution margin of $4 per unit. Therefore, the Semiconductor Division should transfer 5,000 Super-chips as the following calculations show: Alternative 1No transfer (and, therefore, no sales of process-control units): Sell 15,000 Super-chips at contribution margin per unit of $30 Sell 40,000 Okay-chips at contribution margin per unit of $4 $450,000 160,000 $610,000
Alternative 2Transfer 5,000 Super-chips: Sell 15,000 Super-chips at contribution margin per unit of $30 Sell 20,000 Okay-chips at contribution margin per unit of $4 Sell 5,000 control units at contribution margin per unit of $18 $450,000 80,000 90,000 $620,000
So, if the price for the control unit is uncertain, the transfer price must be set at the minimum acceptable transfer price of $46. 4. For a transfer of any amount between 0 and 10,000 Super-chips (which require 2 hours each to produce), the opportunity cost is the production of Okay-chips (which require hour each). In this range, the relevant costs are equal to the transfer price of $46 established in part 3. If more than 10,000 Super-chips are transferred, the opportunity cost becomes the sale of Super-chips on the outside market. Now the minimum transfer price per Super-chip becomes: Incremental Opportunity cost per Super - cost per Super chip up to the + chip to the = $30 + ($60 $30) = $60, the market price. point of Semiconductor transfer Division At this transfer price, it is cheaper for the Process-Control Division to buy the circuit board for $60, since $10 of additional direct manufacturing labor cost is saved. The Semiconductor Division should at most transfer 10,000 Super-chips: Internal Demand 010,000 10,00025,000 Transfer Price $46 60
