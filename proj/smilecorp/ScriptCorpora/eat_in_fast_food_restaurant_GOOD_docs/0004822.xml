Internet Explorer 6, eh? Sadly, we can no longer support your outdated internet cruiser.

Why? Because it&apos;s old. Older than the iPod, older than Windows XP, even older than East Timor. So we&apos;re pulling the plug, and some site
 features might not work for you. Switch over to Firefox , Google Chrome , or the latest version of IE .
