    Kind Words from Customers 
 
 
 &quot;There is no way I could have done this myself and had our corporate attorney review for
compliance for this price or anywhere near this price.

My state has too many laws to keep up with, so I needed an employee handbook written
by an attorney that has the legal language I need for my state and federal laws.

I found this Employee Handbook to be very simple and painless. It’s so easy to use.
It only took me 5 minutes and I’m almost done. It’s too easy, actually perfect.

It’s definitely worth the price, and I like all the things it came with. I also like that
you keep it up to date for me when my state laws change.

I needed this employee handbook because Employment Practices Liability Insurance
requires me to have an employee handbook for my state.

I recommend this Employee Handbook.&quot; 

 Melanie, Louisiana
 



 
 &quot;I needed an employee handbook that protects my business from employees who want to
break the rules and make disputes.

I found that this employee handbook is exactly what I need. It is written by a lawyer.
This makes me feel secure because I know my business is legally protected.

I like that it’s easy for me to edit, and that you can review my changes to make sure they’re legal.

I highly recommend this employee handbook.” 

 Anita L., Subway Franchisee
Subway Good4U, Utah



 
 &quot; I thought the price was more than what I wanted to pay since we’re a small business.
Then I noticed this employee handbook is specific for my state and ready to go; two
very necessary and important things I was looking for.

I found this employee handbook to be a turn-key H.R. Dept.

It’s very well written, simple and easy enough for my employees to understand. It was easy
to obtain and fully customizable. I liked that it is downloadable and that I could have it at
the click of a button. I definitely recommend this handbook.”

 &quot; I worked in upper management at a Fortune 500 company for over 20 years, I’m already 
familiar with the policies I need, and I wanted a strong base to start a new employee
handbook for my private business. 

 The fact that this employee handbook is attorney written and state specific gave me
confidence in buying this handbook. 

 I liked that you customized my employee handbook with my logo and company name.
The strong base of this employee handbook will make it easy for me to add my own policies
just the way I want. 

 I’m very satisfied with this handbook and I highly recommend it.” 

 PSP of Hollywood 
 
 
 “Starting a new business gives me a lot to worry about and a lot of expenses. 

 Having an employee handbook ready to go and customized for me was one more thing
to check off my to do list. 

 I like that it’s easy to edit. It was easy for me to add what’s applicable to my restaurant. 

 I would definitely recommend this employee handbook to anyone opening a restaurant like I was.” 

 Darren H., Texas 



 
 &quot; ...I especially appreciate how well you answered my questions about the changes I wanted to
make to the handbook
and how you helped me with the changes. I really like the quality of the handbook and your
excellent service. You gave me everything I need.

I already recommended your employee handbook to a friend. If you would like to give my
phone number to anyone who wants to know about my experience, you are welcome to do so.
I will absolutely recommend you. ” 

 Boris E., Jersey Limo, New Jersey               



 
 
 I&apos;m an HR Consultant and needed an attorney drafted employee handbook for a client asap. 

 I called late on a weekend evening and was pleasantly surprised that I was able to talk to
someone at an hour when one normally doesn’t get such service. 

 I am extremely pleased to have the ability to speak with a live person. I appreciate the
excellent service you provide, and I like that this employee handbook is attorney written and
current as of today. 

 Thanks to all your help, it took me no time and now I&apos;m up and running.
I am very happy with this employee handbook.” 
  
 Bill K., HR Consultant 

 
 &quot; Great resource to help protect against employment lawsuits.
 Costs less than 1 hour of an attorney&apos;s time, yet worth so much more. &quot;

 Hassan, Hassan&amp;Tuchman, Maryland 

 
 &quot;Our Clinic required an Employee Manual for California that was legally air tight.

As a former corporate Compliance Officer, I realized this was a daunting project to undertake for
legal H.R. demands.

You not only &quot;wrote the book&quot; for our Employee Manual, you indeed &quot;wrote the book&quot; on exceptional customer service.
Most importantly, you earned our trust. &quot;

 &quot;My lawyer recommended that I get an updated Employee Handbook.
This one hit the nail on the head. 
 
 It&apos;s very professionally written, tailored for my state and gives me the
type of protection that I need. I&apos;m very satisfied.&quot;

 “We needed an employee handbook that covered a broad range of employment problems,
and this fit what we were looking for.
 
This employee handbook is great, very extensive; and it brings out a lot of valuable things,

A friend told me about FingerTip Manuals.

My new Employee Manual was ready to go in a few minutes.
