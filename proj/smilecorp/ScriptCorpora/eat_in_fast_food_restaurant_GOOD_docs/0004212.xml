Cops need more pay, better benefits

Do you wonder why we can&apos;t get enough cops in Abilene?

I am the wife of an Abilene police officer who has been on the force approximately 15 years. People might wonder why we do not get enough applicants to test for this position. Let me list a few I feel we are lacking.

One is the pay and benefits. Neither of these compensate for this type of profession. What a lot of people do not understand is this is not just a job but a lifestyle. Police officers are constantly on duty. Whether they are at the grocery store, church, shopping, eating out or enjoying family time.

The primary reason I feel we do not get enough applicants is the amount of required college hours. My husband&apos;s academy back in 1993 was the last academy that did not require college hours. During this time, there were approximately 500 applicants. It does not take someone with college hours to put their life on the line for people they do not know. That takes heart and compassion. There are enough individuals with these two qualities and desire to work for City of Abilene without college hours. You do not get these qualities out of a book.

Abilene is a great community and the Abilene Police Department is a wonderful family to be a part of. The department is not good just because the officers are educated -- it is because they are dedicated and passionate about protecting the citizens of Abilene.

I am in full support of my city, county and state law enforcement agencies. We need to support these men and women in whatever ways possible, which sometimes includes our tax monies. Our law enforcement heroes are severely under appreciated to do a job the rest of us will not do. I am in full agreement of Mrs. Bell letter and want inform our local residents this information extends to the county and state levels as well. We know or should know that our city police are underpaid, but our county deputies are paid only 65 percent of our men in blue. They do not have the luxury of an association to speak for them, so the public is never aware of their situation. They have not had a pay raise in over 15 years, since Sheriff Dieken has been in office. A Taylor County deputy can work almost 20 years without ever reaching the pay of a Abilene Police Dept. first year cadet. Our county correction officers are paid equivalently to an employee of a fast food restaurant. What this means, a person that has the potential of having urine or feces thrown on them, cussed out continuously, or possibly severely injured or killed is paid the same as a teenager at your favorite burger place. Our prison correctional guards have the same problems and are being overworked due to the lack of potential employees. They are having to drive to Colorado City to help their brothers and sisters to keep the prison with enough guards to run it safely. We have all seen our city, county, and state government heads make excuses that due to the war the potential employee pool is shallow. The bottom line is that our law enforcement in this area of Texas is being forgotten about and is falling behind. We need to inform our city council, county commissioners, and congress persons that we support them and that they should too. If we do nothing the old saying “You get what you pay for!” will become a reality.

The low pay not only applies to our great men and women in blue. Abilene&apos;s pay scale across the board stinks. No matter what field you work in, the pay is very low. I understand why people move to the Metroplex and other large cities - they have to to make a decent living. Abilene is going to have to do something to recruit and retain not only police officers but employees in other fields.

TexasBob, you hit the nail right on the head!
I worked in law enforcement for several years until I got injured and couldn&apos;t return to my job. You get what you pay for! Being a law enforcement officer is not just an eight hour a day job that at the end of you take your badge off and go on about your life, being a cop is a lifestyle because you are a cop 24/7 and it definitely takes a toll on your life - higher divorce rates, higher suicide rates, shorter life expectancy, etc. etc. than most other occupations. I too was a corrections officer before transferring to another agency and the health risks there are unbelievable - I and many of my coworkers stayed sick with something or another that the doctors never could pinpoint. As a corrections officer you are dealing with convicted felons your entire shift, something no other law enforcement officer does. Corrections officers are the most mistreated of law enforcement and why? Is it because you need so many of them?, then stop putting so many non-violent offenders in jail. From a Del Rio viewpoint, the Abilene Police Department pay scale looks great. In fact for it&apos;s size and benefits it looks to be one of the better departments to work for. The fact that the Abilene Police Department is not able to be staffed makes you really wonder what our lowered paid departments are like - it scares me. Most sheriff deputies serve at the pleasure of the sheriff - the sheriff for whatever reason can terminate them, little or no competition but a lot of favoritism for promotions, miserable salaries. I don&apos;t agree with the entry level requirements requiring a college education - why am I going to go to college to earn this amount of money for all of the sacrifices involved with the job. Many of the folks with college that I ran across were totally bored out of their skulls with the job and did not stay in law enforcement. This is not an implication that law enforcement officers aren&apos;t intelligent in any way, but that it takes a certain mindset to be a cop - patience, dedication, perseverance, belief that however small my actions may be I made a difference for someone today. This matter is not just an issue that is affecting Abilene, it is basically a nationwide problem and if we don&apos;t do something soon it will only get worse.

Our son took a polygraft test to become a police officer in another town in Texas, but failed it because of one question,&quot;have you ever taken drugs prescribed for someone else?&quot;, and answered it truthfully, because he was married and took some of his wife&apos;s medicene for a stomach virus. He has never drank or used illegal drugs and was a policeman at the time in a small community. It&apos;s a ill worded question for applicants to anwser. His fate was to have a much better job now and safer job too, but the police situation is a travesty everywhere.

Low pay in Abilene for almost any job has always been a problem, and that&apos;s the reason I left over forty years ago. Dallas and Ft. Worth pay their police, firemen, and all other occupations quite a bit more than Abilene. It comes down to where do you want to live and I would have loved to have stayed in Abilene where two generations of my family had lived, but I cared enough to move my family where they could live at lot better standard.

Abilene&apos;s pay scale hasn&apos;t kept up with the national standard in almost any craft or profession. Corporate business look at places like Abilene and go there to get people to work at a lowest wage scales needed for a the job to be done, so your whole infastructure of wages and salaries are set from that graft. Abilene will stay probably where it has been for years to come...I know the truth hurts.

Hspower, your reasoning is as bad as your grammar. Do you see corporate businesses moving to Abilene? Have I missed something? Corporate businesses do not locate in a place like Abilene and the reason they don&apos;t is because of the low wages. They locate in towns and cities where wages are higher and quality of life is better. It is easier to keep their employees in such an atmosphere. A business cannot afford to train someone and then plant them in Abilene where they will be lured off in a year or two by someone who will pay more. The reason that the wages are low in Abilene is because people will work for those wages. The workers take these low wages and shoot themselves in the foot by doing so. Abilene is not a union town. Unions are almost non-existent in Abilene and most people here don&apos;t have a favorable view of them. As a result, wages and benefits are very low. This situation has nothing to do with the businesses; it has everything to do with the workers who take these low wages and poor benefits. Don&apos;t bellyache about it. If workers demanded higher wages then Abilene businesses would pay them. They have too much invested to refuse. ORGANIZE!!

It is silly for the city to whine and complain about a police shortage (which is dire!) and not increase pay to keep the officers that they have. If the City of Abilene wants to have 100,000 people policed by an Andy Griffith and Barney Fife sized police force then they simply need to do nothing. If they want to prevent a downward spiral into anarchy and a mass citizen exit then they need to quit buying busses that look like 19th century transport and use the money to start paying cops more. Frankly, we have had a wealth of idiotic expenditures here in Abilene over the last 20 years and we keep electing (and paying) the idiots who made them. Frontier Texas could be the greatest thing in the world and yet people won&apos;t come if they are afraid to get out of their car in downtown Abilene. Get the priorities straight!

&quot;You get what you pay for&quot;? I&apos;m here to tell you the citizens of Abilene have gotten way more than they ever dreamed of paying for when it comes to the quality of city employees from Administration to Refuse to Zoo. When you are talking about the folks who put their lives on the line every single hour of every day, both Police AND Fire, Abilenians are getting the greatest bargain since the Louisana purchase.

Good letter Margie! I worked with plenty of officers who lacked a college education and they were, for the most part, excellent officers. Then too, that was mostly back when officers only had to enforce the law, not be social workers, baby sitters, marriage counselors and dispensers of discipline for parents unable to raise their own children without police assistance. And all while being absolutely politically correct. That was also when officers weren&apos;t so burdened with paperwork and with a bubble form to fill out on ever single traffic stop. A simple arrest now could generate hours of paperwork. Lord help an officer arresting a DUI on an accident with even the most minor of injuries! There&apos;s a whole shift blown and one less officer to respond to calls.

A college education, in law enforcement fields, could certainly be helpful in making an excellent police officer but it is not necessary. The quality of the applicant and the training they receive, not the length of his/her education, is what makes a good officer here or anywhere else. Better pay/ benefits will definitely draw in more applicants as well as retain the ones we have.

Police with college hrs in criminal justice and hrs from police academies do make better officers. Trianing in handling situations, such as maritul disputs and family disputs are some of the toughest to handle. Putting up the crazy people in such situations is the most demanding and stressful of a police officer. Then he must go home to his own family and act as if nothing happened. Stress plays a big part in whether police stay or go in the long term. Making a good salary takes some of the stress away, when you know your family is being taken care of for the stuff you put up with while on duty......

Corporate businesses do look at communities, with low taxes, low wages and little or no union activities. The reason they don&apos;t move to Abilene is, the city is unwilling and unable to offer them suitable tax deferral years, so they can have winfall profits for their first years in business, and Abilene is not as visible as some other communities nearer to the DFW area.

I&apos;m very sorry about the grammer, but I was educated in Abilene, where school teachers were paid as little as possible like all the other working people in town. Teachers had thirty to thirty-five students during those years I went to school and not enough time for problems like me.

Despite all my problems robertwp, I have made a very decent living, into six figures for the past twenty years. My wife and I have six successful college educated children and are already looking at the next generation in our family to be successful planning and encouragement.

I feel like Mrs. Bell has described me and my current situation. I am a city resident who has wanted to become an Abilene police officer for many years. The reason I have not applied to the department as of yet is because of a lack of college credits. I did not complete college after high school but instead got into a trade and have pursued it for ten years.
There is nothing I want more than to apply for the Abilene Police Department. I am not a kid just looking for power. I am 31 have been married for eight years and have been in the workforce for almost half my life. I have never been in trouble with the law and yet the only reason I am not a police officer is because of a few college credits on a transcript.
My trade has taught me life lessons that 45 college credits (APD requirement) could never teach. Some of these lessons are responsibility, honesty and credibility; which are all characteristics we expect of our law enforcement officers. Yes, we do expect our officers to be articulate, but should we be concerned if he/she makes a common spelling mistake on a report that few people will ever read?
I believe that, in law enforcement, any required education beyond high school will be covered in the academy. I thought the purpose of the academy is to teach standard procedures, the Penal Code, and overall prepare the trainee for the expected duties. Practical street knowledge will be learned right there—on the street (field training).
As Mrs. Bell’s examples prove, there are many reasons for current or potential officers to relocate to other cities, but most important are pay and benefits. Most police departments have Web sites that specifically define pay/benefits of their department as public information. I have compared several other departments to Abilene and I wonder why anyone would stay here. The answer is: this is home, they have family and friends here, and this is a great community. My next question is: if this is such a great place(and it is), why is the community not taking care of its police officers and finding a way to increase pay/benefits and raise recruitment?
I could relocate to another city to become an officer. Lubbock has tried recruiting me on several occasions, and they have better pay/benefits (including take home cars). My reason for not relocating there is the same as most, if not all, of our current officers. The incentives may not be great, but this is my home. If the city ever decides to lower or even drop the college requirement for hire, maybe someday I will get the chance to serve this great community.

CZJ, I was once in your position, and it was very frustrating. I am currently the same age as you are, and I now hold an Advanced Peace Officer Certification and will receive my bachelor&apos;s degree in December. I have been an officer for 7 years, and it has been very rewarding. If you want to be an APD officer, PLEASE DON&apos;T GIVE UP!! I know you probably have a busy schedule, but I would encourage you to try and find a way to get enrolled in some courses at CJC. If there is any way you could take 15 hours a semester for an entire academic year (2 semesters) and another 15 over the following summer, you would have everything you need to be able to apply to APD. I was working a full-time job while I accumulated the college hours I needed to get into law enforcement, and although it was tough, I did it, and I found out that in addition to being a cop, I also liked being a student, and that encouraged me to finish my four-year degree. No one in law enforcement is there because of the money. They are there because it is a very tough and very rewarding job. If you REALLY want to be a cop and are willing to make some sacrifices to get there, let me know. I will personally offer you any advice that you might need to help you accomplish your goals.

Also, robertwp, I will accept lower wages ALL DAY LONG if it means keeping unions as far away from Abilene as is possible. The only people that TRULY benefit from unionization are union officials. If you love the idea so much, I hear there is plenty of available real estate in New York and New Jersey.

CZJ, you hit the nail on the head. As an area police officer I see and live the frustration everyday from being short handed on the street. Sometimes we get complaints on how long it took us to get to the call and its embarassing to explain that we were all busy on other calls do to being short handed. I wonder what it will take for the people that can make the difference in pay, benefits, and incentives to realize that we are losing quality officers and turning away potentially good officers due to college requirements. Granted, I recieved my degree prior to becoming a police officer and the reason I stayed in this area was because of friends, family and roots. For some, college does not make the person a better officer, maybe book smart but in this profession you have to have alot of common sense. You can&apos;t get that from college.
This is a great community as you stated. The problem is its hard to draw in outside applicants when there is not that much that appeals to them. For example: if the applicant is not from around here (or maybe he is) and he sits down and compares pay scale of other citys, then adds in insurance benefits, and see the difference in incentives that is offered from the other cities then one might understand why the applicant goes elsewhere. Incentives in this job include but not limited to; credit card to pay for uniforms/gear (Lubbock and others do this),and take home cars (Again Lubbock and others do this). These items help intice you to apply with that agency instead of the other. I hate losing quality officers to other agencies for that reason. As the news paper stated there were only 70 or so applicants that took the test. That is pretty low for a city this size. I believe it has alot to do with the college requirements, pay, benefits, and incentives. Maybe one day this can be changed. You seem like a very inteligent person to realize what you do and I hope to see you doing this profession someday.

I agree that police need more pay. I do think it is important to keep the college requirements as they are. I understand that it can be argued that you don&apos;t need an education to be successful. Not just in law enforcment, but any field. Many people know someone that has made it big without a college degree. However, if for no other reason, having college hours shows dedication to something. Being in law enforcement takes dedication. As many people have stated, it is a lifestyle and you are a cop 24/7. How can a department know they are getting someone, that once the time and money is spent to train them, they will stick with it, even when it gets difficult.
College is hard. You have to balance fun, work, and education. There is alot to balance. I don&apos;t think that the requirements should be there because intelligence is the main concern. I think that if you want dedication, there has to be something that you have done that is hard for everyone to accomplish. To be honest, I think that a degree should be required. College shows an employer that you have the ability to learn and do what is necessary to succeed. The actual education is minor. Look how many people have a degree in one thing, but work in a different field.

To CZJ. I say go for it. Show the department that you are willing to sacrifice time and money to reach the requirements. That will show you to be an impressive applicant, and one worthy of the uniform.

I do not understand why there is such a gap between what state troopers earn, Abilene Police Officers earn and Taylor County Deputies earn. All 3 deal with the exact same criminal element and could be run over or shot by the same bad guy. So why is it that a first year DPS Trooper&apos;s life is worth close to $40,000 a year, a A.P.D Officer about $37,000 a year and a Taylor County Deputy $25,000 a year? All 3 are licensed through the state and are required to continue their education. I have heard the arguement that there is not as much crime in the county as in Abilene. That may be true but on a good night in Taylor county you might have 2 deputies and a supervisor, and that is to cover over 900 square miles. EVERY peace officer in the U.S should be paid a salary equal to the risk and danger they place themselves in. If anyone reads this and say&apos;s&quot;my taxes are high enough as it is!&quot;Then look at other areas in goverment to suggest cutting cost, but do not short change the people whos job it is to come to your aid when you need them.

Since the Sheriff&apos;s dept seems to care so little about it&apos;s officers (correctional officers and deputies)salary and benefit wise especially, and the apd is having trouble finding qualified applicants, perhaps the APD should look into accepting lateral moves from deputies.

Remember all of this the next time the city council decides to spend $250,000 on a consulting firm to figure out the feasibility of developing resort property out at the dump. There has been a lot of wasted funds this year that could have gone toward something much more practical. They will continue to ignore the police pay problem and waste money on stupid things as long as we don&apos;t hold them accountable. When you see a city councilman at Walmart or at a restaurant, go up and tell them that you want something done about police pay. I bet that will get their attention.

I am not saying you should not try and speak to the City Council, County Commisioners, Sheriff and so forth, but remember they are elected. I know your are thinking&quot;yeah I elect them&quot;, you are right but but alot of others vote to and the elected officials consider spending money as&quot;bad&quot;. They want to win the next election to by bragging about keeping spending down. Well this is how they keep spending down, short change the ones who are really dedicated to&quot;the job&quot;and won&apos;t quit because it is a lifestyle. Well the cost of everything has gone up over the last 10 years, so why is law enforcement (including corrections officers) pay any different. If the Sheriff can make over $80,000.00 a year to play golf most of his days, his hard working employees should make at least half as much. I bet everyone would be shocked if the yearly salaries for elected officials and city hall management were posted in the paper.

There are alot of things with the Sheriff&apos;s Office that most don&apos;t know about. I use to work for the Taylor County Sheriff Office and it is a corrupt and twisted agency to work for. There are laws that state how many officers need to be working at the jail according to the population or number of beds in the facility. Taylor county just butter&apos;s the books and pretends to have enough people. the ratio is 48 inmates to 1 officer. Many times it&apos;s 2 or 3 times that many inmates to one officer. The jail is actually a larger facility than most will admit to. There is no officer association and if any officers show interest they are subject to harrasment, and termination from the facilty. There is low pay like many other&apos;s have mentioned the pay is equivalnet to that of fast food asst manager&apos;s pay. Hiring standards don&apos;t exist, many officer work there for extended period of times with out proper training as required by the state of Texas. The county is lucky if there is one deputy and supervisor on duty at anyone time on patrol in the county. Officers are neglected however the Jail Administrator and assistant administrator recieve pay raises. The jail has a comissary program for inmates to purchase items while they are detained at the jail. Law requires a program for inmates to be able to purchase writing materials and hygiene items. The S.O. has increased their program to include all sorts of food stuffs and drinks among other things. sure it increases prisoner morale and that doesn&apos;t bother me. what bothered all of us is the fact that the money the sheriff office makes goes unreported and untracked. Commissary is ran 2 to 3 times a week every week. Each time they run commissary the program brings in thouseands of dollars, there are many weeks when they bring in over $10k. This money can only be used on programs that affect and benefit inmates. The only thing I ever saw improvement on was new basketballs, and a few new televisions. Funny thing is that you see certain jail employees with new cars. Sheriff Jack Dieken rarely visits his jailers, after a few years working there I saw him once and he made no offer to say hello or ask of our morale. The sheriff recently had his second in command get demoted because of a harrasment issue. This posistion is still open, so instead of promoting a deputy into this posistion a new SOP was written. This SOP states if this posistion is left open and the Sheriff resigns, dies, or is incapacitated and cannot serve the jail administrator takes over. Rumor has it from some who have left the S.O. in disgust and others who have retired that Dieken plns on running for another term and is going to step down 6 months after re-election. The jail administrator is also married to high level deputy with in the organization. The current Jail Administrator is litteraly running the jail into the ground.

I am a current employee of the Taylor county Sheriff&apos;s Office. I work as a corrections officers in the county jail and the last comment made is sadly and severly true. I know that there are several officers who feel the same way that I do, but are afraid of administrative retaliation should they choose to speak out about current conditions. I have seen throughout the years many good officers leave because of the Administration, pay, morale and the just the way things are handled at Taylor County S.O. The officers have a ton of pressure put on them and they do not get any recognition or support for it. One major cause for added stress is that we do not have a nurse at the jail 24/7. If a medical emergency arises we are putting ourselves and inmates at risk, and that is unacceptable. We officers are only trained for basic first aid and CPR, we are not trained for severe medical emargencies. Also it is made an even more stressful situation to try and work for Taylor Co. due to not only the conditions at the jail themselves, but due a lot to the pay. In many instances a corrections officer has to go out and get a part time or even another full time job on top of working at S.O. just to make ends meet. Taylor Co is not up to par in pay when compared to surrounding counties who are making more money and house less inmates. To add insult to injury, Taylor Co will house inmates in our jail from those other counties due to their overflow. Believe that other counties are not sending us the model prisoners either; we get the problem inmates other counties can&apos;t or don&apos;t want to handle. I have witnessed many a good officer leave S.O. to pursue other jobs that pay more and are less stressful. This is a huge loss to Taylor Co, it&apos;s citizens and to those of us who stay behind at the jail and continue to try and maintain a high level of service at the jail. As far as the Jail standards go, there are a lot of discrepancies at Taylor County. The inmate to officer ratio is a bigger problem than anyone at the S.O would like to admit; Right now, we are so understaffed that an officer can rarely take any much deserved time off to spend with their families. Overworked is a common state among employees who are backlogged with time off not taken. We commonly work overtime because none of the work shifts have the manpower to fully and properly staff a shift. When an officer does manage to get time off, more often than not, the shift is left undermanned, and we have to ask another officer from another shift to fill in. This is a major stressor and a safety hazard for inmates and employees. What keeps me at Taylor Co S.O. is my personal concern for law and order but mostly for my loyalty to my fellow officers who would be one more man short if I were to leave too. If something is not done about the situation soon, I only fear to imagine what state Taylor Co. S.O. and Taylor county citizens themselves will be left to deal with.

The Taylor County Sheriff&apos;s Office is well known for double standard when it comes to Officers and Administration. They brag about officers having take home cars. Unless you live outside of Abilene you really don&apos;t benifit. And Certain individuals have unmarked COUNTY owned vehicles (or County Leased vehicles)that they use like a personal vehicle. Using County purchased Gas. If you don&apos;t believe me go to the front of the Taylor County Jail and look at the white impala parked just east of the main entrance. It usually has child safety seats in it. I think every employee would love to use county equipment and gas to haul the kids to and from daycare or school. Also what about liability, if an accident occurs with said child in the car what happens? It a county owned (or leased) car with county insurance and the child is not a county employee. This is just one example of how a select few at the Sheriff&apos;s Office do exactly what they want and no one can or will hold them accountable.Some Questions to ponder: How much money was paid out this year for sexual harrasment lawsuits at the Sheriff Office? Was anyone fired? What exactly is the turn over rate at the Jail? Does having a large turnover rate and constently having new guards cause a security issue? If we have a shortage of guards then why are they spending Millions of dollars to expand the Jail right now? Who will work it, or do they care. They really just want the revenue generated by housing other counties inmates. The only problem is Taylor County Tax payers are funding the Jail expansion and they will not get money back when we start housing out of county inmates. I know it sounds like several people are throwing rocks at the Sheriff&apos;s office on this site. But the gods honest truth is the Sheriff&apos;s Office has gone way to long without anyone actually taking a leadership role. We have high paid administrators, but not one leader. Checks and Balances, everyone needs to start questioning why thing are the way they are.

WOW. Were do i began to talk about the the sherrifs dept. first of all the comments above were so right. I will start to tell you about the administration. Well the major doesnt even know half her emloyees names unless they have been in some sort of trouble.
The major and the captain are never in the office they are gone to meetings were ever they go. It a very corrupt place to work they jail employees are over worked and way under paid. The sgts are all kids under the age of 30. It is like going to a jr high every day one has to go to work. I have seen some very corrupt and unfair decisions in the promotoion process. It is not about who can do the job the best it is about who the administration can controle. The jail emloyees get absolutley no baking from the front. If you make and inmate mad he or she will right the officer up and 99.9 percent of the time it is a lie and the jail envistagaore will take the inmates side. I can the major has foster kids she had one inmates kids the inmate was put on a 15 minutesuicide watch and taken off and moved to the trustee tank all in one day . The sgts dont work that much either they are in thier office blue toothing songs on thier cell phones to their favorite officers instead of having that prospective officer work his area like he or she is sopposed to. but instead the boards get pincel whipped. It is time for a new sherrif and a new jail administration so nxt nove i strongly encourage everyone to vote someone other than jack.

As far as the election is concerned, it will be decided in the primaries. It is an uphill battle to beat an incumbent, and a Republican at that. Honestly the voters in Taylor County are mostly older people who need assistance with the new voting machines. When they see (incumbent) by Sheriff Diekens name they will think to themselves&quot;he must be doing a good job, I haven&apos;t heard anything bad about him&quot;. They will vote like they have in the past. Kinda like ordering ice cream, you always order what you know and never think&quot;is there something better?&quot;What needs to happen is all the little skeletons need to be marched out of the Sheriff&apos;s closet. They should be lined up for the voters to see. If this were to happen we would have a new Sheriff this election. But unfortunately I believe things will continue on the downward spiral its currently on. I do not personally know the APD Officer running against Sheriff Dieken but if he wants to actually run a department instead of letting his underlings run the entire show, he has my vote. This county&apos;s law enforcement needs a new direction and I am all for anyone who can get it done. Stop wasting tax dollars on expanding the jail, training new jailers every couple of months, and by all means stop wasting tax dollars on settling sexual harassment lawsuits for supervisors who can&apos;t keep it in their pants.

As some of you have figured out, I am not a fan of the Sheriff&apos;s Departments current administration. Actually I hold a little but of a grudge against them. After working most of my life at different jobs I decided to pursue a life long dream of working in the Law enforcement Field. I was hired at the Taylor County Jail. I loved it, well for the first couple of months anyways. I began to see favoritism and preference given to certain people. I saw Officers spirits crushed by a Department that does not care. Officers are in no uncertain terms told&quot;you are replaceable, do what I say or quit!&quot;I have seen Sgt&apos;s demoted because they wanted to advance, while other Sgt&apos;s did the same thing and were not demoted. The Department has a weak foundation. The Major at the Jail is using Sheriff Dieken as a puppet. She is running the whole show, and this is with the help of her husband who has curiously advanced quickly in the department. It clouds the judgment of supervisors when you have a spouse or ex-lovers in the department. She has both. Well I have had a little too much to drink and fear I might fall off my soapbox If I continue so i will wrap it up. I just feel strongly about the Officers and others who are still working at the Sheriff&apos;s Dept. I made the decision to leave. But the conditions at the Dept made my decision ALOT easier trust me. I still resent the Taylor County Sheriff&apos;s Dept for helping me give up my dream. Shame on You. And for my fellow Officers who are still hanging in there, be careful because you may be replaceable to them but we care about you and want you to go home safe everyday.

The county jail failed a federal Inspection about a month ago. Normally when there is an inspection the jail has it on schedule and when it comes time verything works and it shines. All the paperwork gets done and everybody is made to rehearse some line of false practices that aren&apos;t actually done. Any ways they are about to loose out on a federal holding license. They have up to 6 months to correct the problems. the state has yet to make a suprise visit. But something i keep wondering, we all add our honest comments to this page and yet the paper still hasn&apos;t let out a big sunday morning press release. WHY?

Yeah we had better hurry and finish the new addition to the Jail, That way we will have hundreds more beds for Federal Prisoners we might not get. If we did not house inmates for other counties, the current jail is plenty big. Its when we get greedy and start housing several other counties inmates we come up short. But why not let the Taylor Count tax payers foot the bill for something that offers no benefit to Taylor County. I really hope lots of voters and Taylor County Commissioners are reading this. All the problems at the jail, from failed inspections to weapons being found in the jail, to Officers smuggling in contraband can be linked directly to mismanagement. If The Major and Captain at the jail had an ounce of integrity they would have letters of resignations on Sheriff Dieken’s desk Monday morning. But they are blind to the status quo that they have become used to. They believe they are doing a great job. But the letters here, the failed inspections, the HIGH officer turnover rate at the jail, and the laundry list of other problems say otherwise. That old saying comes to mind “If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem!”

I read all the comments to Mrs. Bell&apos;s letter with interest. However, the last several really caught my attention. Although hard to prove, the comments about Sheriff Dieken and his jail administrators are right on the money. I have seen it first hand. There have been many abuses of power, large and small. Out of fear of retaliation, I have kept my mouth shut. Someone should let the light of day in on these people and clean house. The jail administrator has had complete power for so long that she is completely corrupted. She doesn&apos;t have to conduct herself in a reasonable manner as she answers to no one. She has caused a lot of problems for her staff, past and present.

A good example of the Jail Administrators lack of accountability is the fact she has been reading these comments along with several county leaders, and she still has infant car seats in her county vehicle. I urge every Taylor County employee to use a county vehicle (when needed) to transport their kids home from school or other funtions. If anyone questions you about it, simply say that Use of County vehicle policy applies to ALL County employees and if the Jail administrator is given special treatment it would be improper to punish you for the same thing she does. The Sheriff should not be allowed to over-ride County policy.

Sheriff Dieken is a very nice personable man. He is also ineffective, a sheriff in name only; a figurehead that has delegated away his power. He doesn’t know many of his own policies. He puts his faith in what his jail administrator tells him. The jail administrator’s demeanor can be cold, disinterested, with a flat affect. She will give eye contact to everyone in her vicinity except the person who has fallen out of favor. She has often denied giving instructions to her supervisors if negative results are obtained. She has disciplined officers for following these same instructions. She is very often unavailable due to personal business. She disciplines for behavior that she herself indulges in. She has employee and inmate favorites. Employees report feeling disenfranchise and alienated . I have observed the administrator’s tacit approval and in many cases, active participation in what can only be described as workplace “mobbing“. This term describes employee to employee or supervisor to employee harassment and mistreatment. Swedish Dr. Heinz Leymann identified and pioneered research into the phenomenon of mobbing in the 1980s. Although he preferred the term bullying in the context of school children, some have come to regard mobbing as a form of group bullying. As professor and practicing psychologist, Leymann also noted one of the side-effects of mobbing is post-traumatic-stress-disorder and is frequently misdiagnosed. This type of treatment is costly in terms of usage of sick time (for anxiety, insomnia, headaches, depression, substance abuse, etc.), apathetic and dysfunctional officers as well as the turnover associated with this administration. I have also observed an air of desperation from officers because they have no recourse. Who are they going to complain to? They need their jobs. They stay as long as they can. Many do not leave with good feelings for the Department. This is not good business.
