 Personability is the name of the game at Rockcliffe Bistro, an Italian-Canadian casual dining restaurant. It&apos;s not just about the food; they take service very seriously here. Although it has a steady crowd of regulars, the staff at Rockliffe Bistro make a special effort to get to know everyone who walks through its doors. You don&apos;t have to dress up to come to this restaurant but an outing here will feel just as elegant. A candle on every table helps create a warm, cozy atmosphere. The Bistro tends to attract mainly the urban professional crowd who are out to unwind and relax with a good meal at the end of a hard week. The menu caters to a Mediterranean palette with an assortment of Italian dishes like chicken cacciatore, veal parmagiana and the traditional Italian pasta and pizza. However, also available are Asian stir-fry and surf and turf dishes which are big hits. For dessert, why not try a slice of pie or mousse cake. If a drink is on your mind, the Bistro offers specialty coffees and imported wine and beer.
