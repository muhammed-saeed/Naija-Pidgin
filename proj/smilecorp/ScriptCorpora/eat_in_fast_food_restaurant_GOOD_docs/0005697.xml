 07/07/11 Moe&apos;s Southwest Grill Review of Restaurant Chain This burrito was good. The ingredients were all rolled up in perfect proportions, with plenty of meat and cheese and not too much rice. The steak came in juicy, meaty strips; the corn salsa was fresh and ever-so-slightly sweet; the guacamole rich and chunky…An adequate amount of fresh jalapeno dice helps to give it more kick.

 06/08/11 Lenny&apos;s Sub Shop Review of Restaurant Chain The pepper relish at Lenny’s is a game changer in my book and puts it way over top in comparison to Jersey Mike’s or any other comparable sub shops. In this visit, I had them slather my sandwich in it in addition to having it prepared the traditional way (onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles, relish, oregano, oil) and I have to say it was delicious.
