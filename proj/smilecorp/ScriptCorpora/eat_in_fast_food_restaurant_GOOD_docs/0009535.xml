When I was making the reservation, they didn&apos;t even thank me for calling them, they just said&quot;La Castile&apos;s....&quot;. So I make my reservation and hung up, but forgot to ask if they take AMEX, so I called back and ask, they said yes, I said thank you, but they hung up right away (no&quot;you&apos;re welcome&quot;). It was like (i&apos;m sure you read in the previous reviews) that you were doing THEM a favour for reserving with them.

We get there, the hostess/reservations girl was sitting and talking to two staff member and didn&apos;t acknowledge us when we came in. When we went up to them, THATS when she was all smiles and stopped talking to her coworkers. We mentioned our reservation and the server with menus said&quot;follow me&quot;(no&quot;welcome to La Castile&apos;s or&quot;Hi, how was your day?&quot;) and we weren&apos;t even asked if we wanted to sit on the patio or dining room. They just assumed we were wanting the dining room. I had to interupt the waiter to ask if there was a smoking room. He just directed us to the patio, not even seating us (we actually had to look around like idiot for someone to seat us, but when we asked one of the patio waiters, they just said&quot;oh, sit anywhere you like.&quot;

We sat down, we waited for someone to give us menus for 10minutes (its just a menu, you&apos;re not cooking anything). We go our complimentary garlic bread and pickles 5mis after we got our menu, but for some reason, it didn&apos;t come with plates. We gave it a little more time for our plates but after a good patient 15minutes, we had to call a servers attention for our plates. (even 5mins for plates is unexecptable).

Our waitress was very nice but was very very very slow in giving us our orders. Our appetizers time was fairly acceptable, because of what we ordered. But when it came down to the main course, it all went downhill.
15mins for our complimentary salad and 40mins for our main course! The main course wasn&apos;t even that great for the price we were paying! Ruth Chris&apos; is better!

They failed to live up to their claim of fine dining. The music on the patio was modern pop radio music (not living up to it&apos;s classy environment). The patio itself could&apos;ve been built somewhere else besides right beside the road. For a fine dining restaurant, I was expecting cushions on your patio chair at least, but they had none. Only some of the tables had an umbrella, ours didnt (can you imagine if it suddenly rained in the middle of our dinner?). And DRESS CODE???? What&apos;s that? Guests came in wearing shorts, so on and so fourth. My suggestion would be to remove the&quot;dress code in effect.&quot;because obviously, it&apos;s not.

We didn&apos;t get what we paid for. I will not come back and will not recommend.

Also, we over heard the next table saying that they had ordered wine an hour ago. So I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s not just me. When they realized how unattended they were, they had to walk the bill to the cash register.

I don&apos;t know why this restaurant advertises so much for new customers when you&apos;re treated like you&apos;re disturbing them by coming into the restaurant. The staff feel like their doing you the favour by letting you have dinner at their place. THIS IS NOT FINE DINING. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER OLD STYLE GREEK STEAKHOUSE ON IT&apos;S LAST LEGS WITH RUDE WAITERS. If you&apos;re a desperate person who doesn&apos;t know where to eat and don&apos;t mind being treated like garbage, this is the place for you.
My husband and I are both doctors and do very well for ourselves. We have fine dining at least 3 times a week.
We have been here before for dinner and the service was terrible. We thought to give this place another chance, and realized what a mistake this was.
When we first came into the restaurant and told the hostess we were here for our reservation, she told us to wait over to the side and someone would seat us. We waited 10 minutes, she looked at us and went over to the&quot;headman&quot;and was chatting with him for 5 minutes without informing him that we were waiting to be seated. After my husband asked them why we were waiting, the headman said he had no idea why we were there and seated us at our table. The restuarant was practically empty on a Saturday night. Then the waiter came over to take our drink order and bolted before we could finish telling him what we wanted. He came back with the drinks and took our order. When we gave him our appetizer order, and we told him we had not decided on our main yet, he got offended that we were taking too long. We were ready to get up and leave. We had no idea this was a fast food restaurant. We requested another waiter and indicated to the new waiter that the other waiter was rude. The original waiter came over and defended himself to us and said he wouldn&apos;t bother us anymore. He admitted that he was rude. We won&apos;t go back. There are several other restaurants in the city that appreciate the business.

Well to start off,I thought the staff was indifferent ,like they didnt really care one way or another that you were there. I agree with another reviewer that the waiters should write down your order.They got a few things wrong and gave it to the wrong people.We had brought our own birthday cake and they must of almost dropped it, because it had shifted to one side. As far as atmosphere goes. It seemed too overcrowded and noisy for me.Now lets get to the food,I found the food to be great,large portions and very tasty, no complaints there. My wife and I are going again tonight for our 23rd aniversary. If we have the same experience again it will probably be our last visit
 Order: T-Bone Steak,Oysters,Calamari

I recently visited La Castile for the first time to celebrate my 10th wedding anniversary. We were seated at a beautiful table under a large stained glass window. The atmosphere was quite nice, much more plush than your average steakhouse. However the building does seem a little shabby around the edges, especially carpeting and the washroom, the last update there must&apos;ve been at least 20 years ago. Our server was attentive and there was a separate busboy who cleared plates and filled glasses. My husband had steak and scallops(huge) and I had the filet mingon. Both steaks were tasty, although they were both ordered medium, his was much pinker than mine, which was closer to well done in my opinion. The accompanying salads were definitely mediocre with FAR too much dressing slathered on them, in retrospect dressing should&apos;ve been ordered on the side. My baked potato arrived in the foil with some words/branding printed on it from the store presumably.. seemed a little tacky.

All in all it was a different dining experiece and adequate for our &apos;fancy&apos; dress up meal. Their website states that there is a dress code but many of the men were dressed in t-shirts, shorts, jeans, etc. so it was not enforced. A little disappointing when you&apos;re dressed up for a nice experience to be seated next to someone who looks like they should be eating at mcdonalds.
 Order: house cab, filet mignon, steak with scallops, truffle cake

I have frequented this establishment on many occasions. The atmosphere is truly spectacular. There is almost a medieval Victorian presence in the large steakhouse that is incomparable.

The service has been quite well each and every time I have been. I have eaten in both the dining room and the piano lounge.

I am in love with the garlic bread/ pickles/ cottage cheese placed on the table immediately upon sitting. The wine list is great, expensive, but this is complemented by the best cut of Kobe beef I have had. The chef always prepares blue rare perfectly and I like the large cut veggies. I have never had cold food and never sent a steak back.

Of course linens and priority and the silverware are always clean.

I have read some terrible reviews below, I suspect a shoemaker decide to take his princess to the castle; likely out of his league. Stick to Wendy’s.
 Order: Scallops, Kobe Steak blue rare with baked potatoe and veggies. Masi Amarone, and an Oban 14yr to complete.

Took fiancee for Valentines Day what a waste of time and money.

This is not a fine dining restaurant.

First the waiter took 20 minutes just to take our orders, did not suggest anything, had to ask for wine list. Had to ask for desert, had to ask for drinks. Spoke in Greek the whole time around customers, unprofessional I would think to do that.

Order was most expensive on the menu and came with a side dish of rice. Worst rice I ever had and to top it all off had hair in it. The platter itself wasnt anything special, not great food or presentation to make it worth what I was paying.

Only thing I like about the place was the decor.

Everything we asked for took 20 mintues the order, the food itself took 40min, the coffe I ordered, hers took and extra 5. The desert we ordered never came, they forgot about it and to top it all off when we asked for the bill they added items we never ordered.

For what I paid I expected better service, which I would get at the Keg or Pickle Barrel. To anyone reading this if your thinking of going dont.

I should have stuck to my gut and gone with Centro or North 44 now thats fine dining.

The kitchen staff should go back to school and find out what&quot;RARE&quot;means. And the pompous&amp;%^# of a chef had the nerve to parade my rejected steak through the restaurant to tell me that his opinion of&quot;rare&quot;was different than mine. However, he did not have the guts to do it him/herself, they sent the waiter, steak in hand, with the message. I receive better service at Wendy&apos; for a $10.00 meal when I travel.

Beautiful place decor-wise, shame the food didn&apos;t match.
Apetizer salad - a pile of iceberg lettuce with a dollop of dressing in the middle of the pile. Not even tossed, dressing tasted like Loblaws finest.
Steak was overdone and not as good as I cook at home.
V.disappointed. Won&apos;t bother wasting money here again.
 Order: salad, steak.
