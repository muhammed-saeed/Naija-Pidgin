 Suspect&apos;s lawyer says he was trying to rescue them 
 
&apos;A complete accident&apos;: Dillon Pearce&apos;s attorney says the teenager was actually trying to rescue the ducklings
 
A college student has been dubbed the world&apos;s biggest jerk after he allegedly ran over and killed four ducklings with his Hummer.


Dillon Pearce, 19, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, is accused of deliberately driving the immense vehicle over the delicate chicks outside a fast food restaurant, crushing them.


But Pearce&apos;s attorney claims that the aspiring hockey player was in fact trying to rescue the animals from other cars in the busy car park and that if he did squash them, it was an accident.


&apos;It’s just absolute baloney that they intended to run these ducks over,&apos; Pearce’s lawyer, David Nacht, said, calling the situation &apos;a complete accident.&apos;


&apos;It’s nonsense,&apos; he said. &apos;The notion that this was an intentional act is ridiculous. My client’s a normal guy from a good family. He cares about animals.&apos;


The ducklings, the mother duck and four to eight other ducklings had been nesting under a bush at a McDonald&apos;s restaurant in Ann Arbor, wandering in and out of the car park, police said.

A passenger in Pearce&apos;s Hummer tried to pick a duckling, but McDonald&apos;s employees &apos;yelled at them to leave them [the ducks] alone&apos;, Ann Arbor Police spokesman Detective Sergeant Brian Jatczak told the Detroit Free Press.

Pearce then drove the vehicle through the drive-thru restaurant - where he and his friends bought food - before parking in an adjacent car park, according to police.


Pierce has been charged with then deliberately driving the 6000lb vehicle back into the McDonald&apos;s car park and into the flock, crushing four ducklings.


Employees called police, who found Pearce at a nearby gas station. He was arrested after being questioned about the incident, Detective Sergeant Jatczak said.

 
Pearce&apos;s lawyer contradicted that version of events. He said Pearce and his two teenage passengers were actually trying to help the ducklings and had suggested to restaurant staff that they move the nest to a safer location.


&apos;Their impression was there were multiple people concerned about the ducks,&apos; Mr Nacht told the court. &apos;In fact, they had been taking active steps to try to protect them.&apos;

Mr Nacht said the three young men did not see the ducks when they returned to the car park - and questioned whether they had even hit the birds at all.


&apos;They didn’t see them, they didn’t hear anything,&apos; Nacht said. &apos;The first time my client heard of the accusation he had hit a duck was from the police when the police approached him.&apos;


Pearce was one of five students charged after a police patrol car had its rear window and lights smashed at Huron High School last June. The charges were eventually dismissed.
