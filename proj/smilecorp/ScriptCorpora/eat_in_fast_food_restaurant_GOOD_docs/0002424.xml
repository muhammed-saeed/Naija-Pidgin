 September 29, 2010 Likes it The Italian Chipotle by Amiet ( 51 reviews ) Piada has taken a cue from Chipotle and applied their assembly-line-style burrito production to a street food favorite, appropriately named a Piadina (or Piada, for short). It is essentially a thin, grilled, flour flatbread stuffed with pasta, seasoned meat, cheese, and a variety of veggies. It isn&apos;t really a burrito, doesn&apos;t quite fit the modus operandi of a wrap, and can&apos;t be categorized as a pita - so hey, I think we have a new and delicious category on our hands! Located on the south side of Lane Avenue, just west of campus, the interior takes on a very stylistic and minimalist feel, with all-white walls, concrete floors, and simple, modern tables and chairs. They cater to a fast-and-casual type of crowd, filling the niche one step above that of a fast-food restaurant. The restaurant was impeccably clean and the service was as friendly and welcoming as I could ask for.

Located on the south side of Lane Avenue, just west of campus, the interior takes on a very stylistic and minimalist feel, with all-white walls, concrete floors, and simple, modern tables and chairs. They cater to a fast-and-casual type of crowd, filling the niche one step above that of a fast-food restaurant. The restaurant was impeccably clean and the service was as friendly and welcoming as I could ask for. Having mentioned it was my first time in their establishment, each of the various cooks took the time to explain each option and ingredient, recommending their favorite combinations as I moved down the line. As mentioned above, the ordering procedure is the same as Chipotle - get in line and get ready to choose from a series of progressive options. You begin by selecting your format (piada, pasta bowl, or chopped salad bowl). If you choose the piada, you get to watch them grill your bread right in front of you on the griddle as a bonus. Then, you move on to your choice of meat (chicken, steak, Italian sausage, salmon, Italian deli meats, or veggies). After your base has been completed, your other selections encompass pasta (yes or no), your sauce or salad dressing (a basic pomodoro, the spicy diavolo, red pepper or basil pesto, parmesan, etc), your cheese (parmesan, feta, or fresh mozzarella), and finally any and/or all of their selection of 10-12 additional veggie options (roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, grilled onions, olives, etc.). Additionally, you can add a side dish of fried calamari, spinach and artichoke dip, or one of 4 flavors of piada sticks - which are rolled and baked piada breads that form an almost crunchy breadstick great for dipping in their parmesan sauce. Prices are very reasonable, as well, with most entrees ranging from $5-7, depending upon your meat selection, with the sides in the $2-3 range. You pay and pick up your food at the register, and then clean your own table once you&apos;ve finished. Piada certainly isn&apos;t fancy or pretentious. It is, however, fresh, fast, and a welcomed deviation from the typical fare. Whether you&apos;re on your way to catch a Buckeyes game or just taking a break between classes, I&apos;d recommend swinging over to see what the buzz is all about. Enjoy. Must-try dish: Piada w/Italian Sausage and Diavolo Sauce 3 out of 3 found this review helpful October 12, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Inexpensive, fast, Italian by JED ( 141 reviews ) A friend and I had takeout from Piada last week and we both really enjoyed our first experience. The atmosphere was simple, clean and very refreshing - too many restaurants fill their walls with crap. Each of the staff members were friendly, and more importantly, quick to fill our requests. I ordered the pasta bowl with chicken, basil pesto, grilled zucchini, shaved parm, olives, tomatos, and cucumber. My friend had the pasta as well, but with the Italian sausage, instead. The only change I&apos;ll make on my next visit is that I&apos;ll hold off on the basil pesto - it was tasty, but made with far too much garlic for my liking. For Italian under $6 - there isn&apos;t much to complain about. I&apos;m looking forward to trying the Piada instead of the pasta bowl next time. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful +1 more review from JED April 5, 2011 Disappointing Downward Slide When Piada first opened, I was a huge supporter: mentioned it to friends and family and wrote words of support various times.

Over the last six months, I feel like the quality of product they are using has really declined. Maybe a different supplier or a different kitchen staff is to blame for the downward slide. On my most recent visit a month ago, I was disgusted with the oily texture and taste of the grilled chicken. Some of the vegetable offerings even tasted like they were dipped in oil and set out to be served. I left feeling sick after eating the salad topped with grilled chicken and red sauce - my stomach doesn&apos;t lie. On a related note, I make fresh Italian food at my home on a regular basis and it is damn good. If I am not going to have food that is as good or better than mine served to me, then why would I dine out in the first place? My time and money are much better off replicating the ingredients used at Piada. There are plenty of other slower, Italian eaterys around Columbus that are worth your time. 2 out of 3 found this review helpful November 14, 2010 Likes it Good Food, Good Price by Coris ( 9 reviews ) Had the angel hair pasta bowl with salmon, pomodoro sauce, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, parmesan, and the artichoke and spinach dip with chips. Food was very good, and very good prices. To those that are complaining about the service, they weren&apos;t overly friendly, but were not rude either... when I go to a quick take out spot, I don&apos;t expect to make a new best friend. 3 out of 3 found this review helpful December 13, 2010 Likes it Sangrebene!! by A. Stone ( 13 reviews ) This food is really good and I&apos;m glad to see some authenticity make its way into Upper Arlington. Try the fried calamari Piada with artichokes. They drop them fresh so they&apos;re not just sitting out getting sogggy. I hope the community will learn to appreciate their food. It&apos;s a good bang for your buck. By the way, a&quot;Piada&quot;is a thinly rolled dough that helps contain all the deliciousness in the middle. It&apos;s like an Italian burrito. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful April 16, 2011 Really likes it Mobile review by Let&apos;stalkaboutfood ( 31 reviews ) This place gets better every time I go, I love the calamari in the bowl or piada. The grilled chicken is good along with all of the sauces and great fresh ingredients to make so many combinations. I didn&apos;t like the piada sticks, but everything else I&apos;ve had is great and big portions. Great prices for the quality. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful July 9, 2011 Likes it Good, greasy Italian. by Shayna ( 28 reviews ) It&apos;s basically the Chipotle of Italian food (except Piada is local, so extra thumbs up there!). Everything is already prepared when you arrive, and you simply go to the counter and put together your salad/pasta bowl/piada just the way you like it. They have plenty of options, and their veggies are always fresh! Depending on your sauce and meat choices, though, the food can get a little greasy. Overall, it&apos;s a great place to go for quick, fairly cheap italian. 4/5 stars! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful March 28, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by TheRev ( 40 reviews ) This place is freakin&apos; incredible. I am guessing there is going to be 100s of these places pretty soon. The food and portions are great and the fix ins are fantastic. Be prepared to make some friends and share a table because this place is always busy. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful December 15, 2010 Likes it Great alternative to fast food. by Dusty Grime ( 58 reviews ) My wife and I tried this place tonight after working out. The food was very tasty and fast. We both filled up for less than $15 and can&apos;t wait to go back to try some different flavor combinations. If you are used to the Chipotle set up, you will do just fine here. This place is high on my list of quick and delicious food. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful March 22, 2012 Will try again by Dianne ( 2 reviews ) We stopped in for a quick bite. I had a nice salad. All fresh and crisp ingredients. Hubby had a pasta bowl. He said the sauce was so-so, but the sausage was very good. We will stop by again. October 8, 2011 Likes it strange concept, but somehow it works by nomad508 ( 161 reviews ) if you&apos;ve heard that this is the italian version of chipotle, that is absolutely true. the menu looks similar, the prices are similar, the decor is similar. but thats not necessarily a bad thing. you can either order your meal in a wrap (piada), pasta bowl or salad bowl. I got a piada and my friend got a pasta bowl (which was a large amount of pasta). you choose a meat, veggies, cheese, sauce, etc. just like chipotle but slightly different. the veggies were excellent and probably the best part of my meal. I would probably go with a pasta bowl next time because it seemed like more food and was less messy. they carry pepsi products which I am not a fan of, but oh well. this place must be doing well because they now have about 4 locations and 2 more are currently being built. I will most likely visit this place again. March 17, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Caramel ( 3 reviews ) I ordered chicken fettuccine and it was nasty due to the sauce. The alfredo sauce is thin, runny, and flavorless. I was thoroughly disappointed and won&apos;t ever go back! April 30, 2011 Excellent by jerryg ( 25 reviews ) Quick and tasty. Kids love making their own bowl. Very busy at lunch. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful March 25, 2011 Likes it So good! by Kathy ( 17 reviews ) This is like an Italian Chipotle. It is so good. I always get the steak Piada with noodles, zucchini, tomato/alfredo, lettuce and tomato. The only thing I would improve would be making the bread less oily. Also don&apos;t forget you can try the Italian sodas if you get a soft drink! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful February 20, 2012 Likes it Excellent Healthy and Vegetarian Options by Leslie ( 5 reviews ) I am really starting to love Piada. I am eating a mostly vegetarian diet, and I can get a very interesting and healthy meal here. I&apos;ve been coming once a week for the past 6 weeks or so. I always see the same employees and they are friendly and efficient. I have only had their pasta bowls. The first time I went (before I switched to vegetarian) I got the sausage and pomodoro sauce. The sausage was exceptionally flavorful, as was the sauce. Unfortunately all of their sauces are loaded with garlic, which does not agree with my stomach. Now I get the past bowl with both mixes of sauteed veggies (green peppers, onions, mushrooms and zucchini), spinach, parmesan, artichoke hearts, red peppers, fresh tomatoes, and dried tomatoes. I no longer get a sauce, but I don&apos;t really need one. They provide large servings of vegetables, and everything is always fresh.

I seriously love just looking at all the different veggies in my bowl as I eat it. The berry Italian soda reminds me of the pomegranate soda you can get at World Market. The only thing that would make piada better would be if they could keep more of the fresh veggies hot, or could throw your whole bowl into a wok for a minute to heat everything up. May 3, 2011 Really likes it Fantastic by JP ( 13 reviews ) A friend of mine took me here and he talked it up a bit. Well, it certainly delivered. I can&apos;t believe this concept hasn&apos;t taken off yet to other locations. This will be the next Chipotle. Wish it was closer, but well worth the drive. Piada sticks=yum! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful September 12, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by Kel ( 32 reviews ) My husband and I both got piadas, very fresh burrito-like flatbreads rolled around whatever ingredients you choose. He had the steak which was moist and flavorful and I chose the Italian meats which were served cold, but made a very good sandwichy tasting piada. The pepperoni piada stick was tasty, but greasy, and they forgot to give us the dipping sauce that is supposed to accompany it. August 1, 2011 Likes it Surprisingly low price for upscale toppings and quality by Laura K. ( 5 reviews ) Wow, I was in shock the first time I ate here. I thought,&quot;This is going to TAKE OFF!&quot;It wasn&apos;t just the concept--Italian Chipotle, as other reviewers have commented--it&apos;s also the quality of the food for the price. Rave reviews: PERFECTLY COOKED ANGEL HAIR. I expected a disaster, honestly, but I am really impressed that they can cook pasta as well as they can for 1) the price and 2) the masses. THE SALMON.

Sometimes I do skip sauce/dressing because the grilled veggies and/or pasta look extra greasy that day. But at the same time, this is a huge, fast bowl of good food for $6 or $7. You simply can&apos;t expect Bravo&apos;s (parent company), Martini&apos;s, Rigsby&apos;s, or Marcella&apos;s at these prices. Also, the line workers were really fast and friendly when they first opened (Lane Ave.) but are now less professional; however I can appreciate that it&apos;s taxing to repeat the same thing for several hours. For the price, they&apos;ve done amazing, and I&apos;ll go back time and time again. Love it! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful April 6, 2011 Amazing by Jessica Lee Walter ( 3 reviews ) I just had it for the first time a couple weeks ago and let me tell you. It was the most delicious fast food italian I have ever had. I like to call it an italian version of chipotle :P but I think it might be better than chipotle. I love it :) 1 out of 1 found this review helpful December 11, 2010 piada by adquinci ( 1 review ) wow! nothing italian about this food, it is absolutely vulgar! 3 out of 5 found this review helpful May 2, 2011 Bravo Piada! by Lynn Bischoff Varney ( 4 reviews ) Bravo to Chef Mike Bomberger!!! finally found time to visit Piada on Lane...can&apos;t say enough good things about my meal. Pasta al dante to perfection, chicken the perfect blend of rosemary, garlic&amp;lemon, crunchy roasted veggies, pomodoro sauce delightful, parmigiano reggiano piada stick added extra and cannoli chips orgazmic! Will be sending my Harrison House Bed&amp;Breakfast guests your way to dine! Thanks for a truly marvelous lunch! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful
