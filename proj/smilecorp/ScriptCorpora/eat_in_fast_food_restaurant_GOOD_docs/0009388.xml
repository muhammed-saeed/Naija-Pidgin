Married dad jailed for Uzi deal in McDonald&apos;s car park near Southport

A MARRIED dad who was caught delivering an Uzi sub-machine gun in a fast food restaurant’s car park was jailed.

Police swooped on Shaun Connors, 41, after he dropped off the semi-automatic weapon in the car park of the McDonald’s restaurant near Kew, Southport.

Connors handed over the lethal weapon, complete with a silencer, to Liam Miller, then 20, who turned up in a taxi.

Ian Davies, prosecuting, told Liverpool crown court officers later followed Miller’s vehicle as it drove off along Town Lane towards Southport hospital and spotted him throwing the firearm out the window.
 
Connors was also stopped and found to be carrying beige rubber clothes and a broken mobile phone SIM card.

Connors, of Hazel Road, Whiston, refused to answer questions in police interview, but later admitted possessing a prohibited weapon and the sound moderator on November 9 last year.

In a basis of plea put before the courts, Connors said he agreed to act as a gun courier in &quot;the misguided belief&quot; he could clear a drugs debt his brother owed to dealers in Huyton.

He admitted picking up the weapon and delivering it to Miller in the car park, but insisted he had no knowledge of what the firearm would be used for.

Miller, of Colwell Road, Dovecot, was jailed for five years by Judge John Roberts on March 18.

Yesterday, Judge Graham Morrow QC ordered Connors to join him behind bars for five years.

He said: &quot;This was a genuine firearm with a sound moderator. It was a particularly lethal firearm.

&quot;There is no evidence it had been used in any criminal activities, but clearly it was intended to be used in the pursuance of criminal activities.&quot;
