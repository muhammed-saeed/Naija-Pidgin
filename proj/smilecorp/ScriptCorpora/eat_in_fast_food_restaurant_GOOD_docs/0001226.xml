 “The food is consistently good. For the price you really can’t beat it.”–Debbie O. 
 
Taco Casa&apos;s Mexican Cafe on 23rd Street
 
 Taco Casa is a locally-owned Mexican fast food restaurant in Panama City, Florida. With over 25 years in Panama City, we know what makes people happy: great food, great service, and a nice place to dine. With our original location in the Panama City Mall Food Court and our spacious restaurant in the 23rd Street Plaza, we have the county cornered when it comes to economical Mexican food! We have all the classics like tacos and burritos, along with our signature items—the Sanchilada and Chili Con Queso.

Our website will give you all you need to know about our restaurant so you’ll feel more-than-ready to visit one of our two restaurants. From an easy-to-read menu, pictures of our restaurants, information on takeout and catering, and a look behind the scenes—we’re here for you!
