Gracie&apos;s Station: Good quality in pleasant surroundings
 kop-queen   171 reviews 1 more image 
lovely themed restaurant modeled after a late 1800’s western railroad station. The motif, though primarily railroad specific, does reflect the characteristics of an entire old west railroad town. There is a sloon for drinks and three dining rooms, named Jenny&apos;s Hotel, TJ&apos;s Round House, and The Brothel, each take on their own atmosphere and offer an entertaining dining experience

 Favorite Dish: I had chicken but the steaks looked good as well

McDonald&apos;s: Unique Security System
 
 Helpfulness
 Basaic   5649 reviews 2 more images 
Normally, I would not put a fast food restaurant here; but there are three McDonald&apos;s in Arizona I will make an exception for. The one in Sierra Vista was the first McDonald&apos;s ever to have a drive-thru window. The one in Sedona is the only one with arches some color other than &quot;golden&quot; (they are teal green). And this one seemed unique too. You&apos;ve heard of a guard dog; they have a guard velociraptor out front. They also have these &quot;fossils&quot; by the parking area.

Beijing Restaurant: Chinese Food in Benson
 
 Helpfulness
 Basaic   5649 reviews 
The decor is pretty typical of a Chinese Restaurant. It is located in a strip mall near Safeway. I went there for lunch and even though it was after the rush they said it would be 20 to 30 minutes before they took my order. I left. I may try again someday, or just stick with the Horse Shoe Cafe. Hours are 11 AM to 8:30 PM Monday through Thursday; 11 AM to 9 PM Friday and Saturday and 12 PM to 8:30 PM on Sunday. They have a $5.45 all you can eat lunch buffet from 11AM to 2 PM Monday through Friday; and a $7.45 Dinner Buffet between 5 PM and 8 PM on Friday and Saturday.

 Favorite Dish: I don&apos;t know yet.

Horse Shoe Cafe: Nice Cafe, Pretty Waitresses
 
 Helpfulness
 Basaic   5649 reviews 
The Horse Shoe Cafe serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Breakfast fare includes omelets, eggs, ham, and pancakes. The decor is typical southwestern. Service was attentive and the waitresses were very cute. I did not see the menu for lunch or dinner but the sign advertised steak and spirits. The cafe was established in 1936. It is open from 7 AM to 8 PM.

 Favorite Dish: I had two eggs with some very good home fries and toast. Good coffee too.

 Benson 
 
   Benson - Home of RV parks and the elderly! The town, located between Tombstone and Tucson, is nothing more than a glorified truck stop. If you&apos;re looking for something to do... I suggest Tucson....
