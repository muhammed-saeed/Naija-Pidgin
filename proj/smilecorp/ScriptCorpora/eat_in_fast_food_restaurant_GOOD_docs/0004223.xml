When in a rush, I have to admit.. I do get my Daughter MCD! Its fast convenient&amp;the drive through service at this MCD is amazing! Silly to say but I&apos;ve never been inside, even to take my daughter to play in the play area, I&apos;ve never been inside!
The food is extremely fast here! Now that&apos;s what I would call a Drive-Thru unlike other MCD&apos;s I&apos;ve been to.

I only come here because it&apos;s the closest thing to work in the &apos;hood and I&apos;m not that fond of Popeye&apos;s.

Their drive-thru manages to be the slowest one I&apos;ve ever been thru probably in my entire life.  I thought it was fast food...and it is McDonald&apos;s.  There&apos;s no excuse of &quot;We don&apos;t make it &apos;til you order it.&quot;  So I don&apos;t know what their problem is.  And make sure you ASK for ketchup before driving off when you get your food.  Maybe it&apos;s just McDonald&apos;s in general, but they don&apos;t even ask, they just assume you don&apos;t want it.

It&apos;s also hilarious when you get this recording of a pleasant female voice  when you first pull up, asking you if you want to try whatever it is they&apos;re pushing.  Something like, &quot;Hi!  Would you like to try our new Caramel Frappe?!&quot;  After saying, &quot;No&quot; you get some dude&apos;s monotone voice asking, &quot;Can I take your order?&quot;

But whatever, it&apos;s McDonald&apos;s.  It&apos;s there for when I forget to bring my lunch or don&apos;t feel like driving to an area with more than 3 fast food joints.

WOW!! thats all I can say. I would rather eat from the trash then come back here. this place is a dump. ordered 20 dollars worth of food and when i sat down to eat it half the food was stail and cold. its like its been sitting for a while. then i went up to talk to the manager its as if she knew what went wrong. with a rude attetude she said what did we do now. after explaining the issue she rolled her eyes as if it was lying so i told her to feel the fries and tas the nasty burger you served me and tell me if you would eat this. she then took the food and tossed it in trash and told me if you dont like our food here is you money back go somewhere else. really I will never eat here again. I hope you dont spend your moneyy here they really need to shut this place down are find people that really cares about how they run things.

I&apos;ve been here a couple of times, the service is usually never that great but I come back because it&apos;s close, convenient and cheap on certain days. But perhaps no more.

Came here on a Tuesday afternoon, ordered a Big Mac meal MEDIUM (our order taker had asked if we wanted a large, we said NO, MEDIUM), two snack wraps and an iced mocha frappé. So our total came out to be 13 something, yes, pretty expensive for such few items but again, it&apos;s close by. We first got our drinks, then the girl says, &quot;Thanks, have a nice day.&quot; We would&apos;ve replied, &quot;Thanks! You, too!&quot; But we didn&apos;t because .. Where&apos;s our food? So the BF looks at her with confused eyes and she says, &quot;Oh, sorry!&quot; We checked our bag when we got it to see if everything was actually in it, yes they were. But my MEDIUM fries might as well have been a SMALL size since it was NOT filled up to the top like most other McDonald&apos;s, it was filled half-way, literally! I guess it&apos;s okay, not really, but whatever so we drove off.

The frappé was surprisingly good, we enjoyed the honey mustard snack wrap, too (wish they didn&apos;t stop serving salsa roja snack wraps). All would&apos;ve been well except this morning I glanced at the receipt and -- WTF! They charged us for a LARGE Big Mac meal when we specifically said NO, MEDIUM ?! And to make matters worse -- the girl who packed our food gave us a MEDIUM drink and a MEDIUM sized fries.

Definitely avoid if you want your money&apos;s worth at a fast food restaurant around this area.

Ok I have many bad experience with this location, but some force of nature had me try it again.
I went to the Drive thru and decided I was going to try something new today, (something I rarely do). So I asked the girl what comes on the #6 and she proceded to tell me that all combos come with fries and a drink. Not the answer I would have expected. So I calified the question wanting to know what came on the hamburger.
&quot;Everything you see in the picture.&quot; Ok so most of us can tell the difference in the vegtable but who can tell what the white or creamy red sauce is? I couldnt believe she couldnt tell me exactly what was on the burger.

Needless to say I didnt order the burger and simply ordered what I normally do. When I received the bag my order was correct but my fries, like always, were barely warm and soggy. They never cook their fries all the way so I am always disappointed.

Make sure you order is specific to hot fully cooked fries and I guess you need to go in if you want to know what sauce they use because you cannot see the menu board well enough to tell.
