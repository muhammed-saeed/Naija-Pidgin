Market Analysis Summary

Instead of building a business around a preconceived concept, we conducted market research and built a concept around our consumers. Our market analysis identified the following key drivers as areas of opportunity to service Atlanta&apos;s restaurant customers:

 Portion Selection: Nearly 95% of our surveyed focus group endorsed having a choice of different size portions. This statistic is in line with findings reported by the  Tableservice Operator Survey. Zara&apos;s Tapas concept is built to offer different-sized portions. Our customers want the option to choose what satisfies their appetite. 
 Menu Variety: Ethnic restaurants are increasing in Atlanta. The proliferation of international cookbooks, food magazines, TV cooking shows and imported goods offers ample evidence that America, as a whole, is currently on an international tasting spree. In fact, eating places that identify themselves as ethnic establishments numbered nearly 78,000 in 1999 and recorded sales of $30.5 billion. Our research results do not identify any single ethnic style of restaurant as desired, but rather suggest that incorporating strong multi-ethnic influences in the menu selection will be popular. Again, variety is the underlying element for this concept. 
 The Dining Experience: Customer satisfaction with food and service has been and continues to be of utmost importance, but our findings indicate that the décor, lighting, bar, and other options to improve the dining experience are also factors in customer decisions. Zara takes all these factors in consideration for the design of this cosmopolitan restaurant. 
 Reasonable Prices: This was no surprise given the economic tide. Although the restaurant industry as a whole has seen growth in 2002/2003, customers are demanding value for their dining dollar. Zara&apos;s menu is priced at a mid-tier level, with no entrée over $20. In addition we have an extended Tapas and Appetizer selection priced between $3.50 - $9.50, allowing budget dining in a full-service restaurant. 

Market Segmentation

Zara&apos;s Restaurant&amp;Lounge intends to cater to a wide customer base. We want everyone to feel welcome and entertained. We have defined the following groups as targeted segments that contribute to our growth projections:

 The Business Person Downtown Atlanta Couples The Destination Customer High-End Singles Tourists 

These particular market segments are 25-45 years old, have disposable income, and are seeking upscale, trendy, and comfortable restaurant options. These are the types of people who frequent other restaurants and bars in the area. They are likely to spend more on experiences they perceive as unique, cosmopolitan, and sophisticated. They are also the most open to trying something new, foodwise, and will embrace our international fusion cuisine.
