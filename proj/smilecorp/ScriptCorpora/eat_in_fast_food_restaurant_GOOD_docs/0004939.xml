Restaurantosaurus

This fast food restaurant is themed to resemble the dormitory of the archaeology students that are ostensibly digging Dinoland USA for fossils. The rooms of the building are strewn with the detritus of college kids in the middle of nowhere, doing their work and keeping themselves entertained.

   11-24-2006 Reviewer: shotwell Michigan   June 05, 2007 We had a wonderful breakfast experience at Restaurantosaurus. The food was delicious (my daughter loved the biscuits and gravy, and the waffles were hot and fresh), the service was good, and the character visits were absolutely wonderful. My family remembers this as the very best part of Animal Kingdom, which is saying a lot since we had a great time at the park. Based on the other reviews and our experience, I would *highly* recommend going there for a character breakfast (and skip lunch there instead!).

   June 18, 2006 Reviewer: Gislef Iowa City, Iowa   June 18, 2006 We had originally planned a breakfast character meal for 8 a.m. here, but a late night and bad weather forced us to cancel. We hit the park around noon after a late breakfast and ended up in Dinoland about 2 p.m. and decided to take a break from the rain.

Basically the place is a limited-selection McDonald&apos;s. A bit overpriced based on our Mickey D&apos;s at home. The one thing we weren&apos;t aware of was that there was a fixings bar and I probably would have got a cheeseburger if I had known (rather than chicken nuggets). The bar is the same one you find at Pecos Bill and as there, they&apos;re smart enough to separate the mushrooms from the onions.

I enjoyed the decor and got a few photos, but the rest of the family weren&apos;t that interested. In their defense, we were all pretty soaked from the rain. Still, the place is very large and spacious (giving us room to lay out our wet ponchos) and has some cute atmosphering. Service was a bit slow during a peak period and they probably should have opened up one more line.

Overall we found Restaurantosaurus a nice safe&quot;generic&quot;place for everyone to grab a bite to eat for a (relatively) reasonable price.

   1/15/04 Reviewer: Family5LovesDisney New Jersey   January 26, 2004 Lunch 1/15/04

We arrived shortly before 11:00 a.m only to find out that they would not be open until 11:30 a.m. My boys were disappointed since they were pretty hungry but we killed some time in the Dinosaur Playground and they had fun there.

Two of my boys enjoyed the Happy Meals. My oldest son had a hamburger. I asked for it to be well done (since he is only 9!) but it was medium well at best. Lots of pink. I guess my husband and I should have ordered the hamburgers (we didn&apos;t realize they had the toppings bar in the other room) but we had hot dogs instead. Our McDonald&apos;s french fries were cold! Very cold and soggy! And we were the first people in when it opened at 11:30. I guess they made them up 1/2 before the opened.

It was an okay lunch but I wouldn&apos;t go back there again.

It was one of the cheapest lunches we had while at Disney World. I think it was $34 or $35 for all five of us.

 History and Trivia - Hide Section 
 At this location: Restaurantosaurus has occupied this space since the park opened. This restaurant&apos;s history: This restaurant opened with the park as part of McDonald&apos;s extensive deal to sponsor the entirety of DinoLand, U.S.A., and was by far McDonald&apos;s largest presence inside any Disney theme park. McDonald&apos;s, however, decided not to renew the 10-year sponsorship agreement, and in March 2008 operation of the restaurant reverted to Disney.
