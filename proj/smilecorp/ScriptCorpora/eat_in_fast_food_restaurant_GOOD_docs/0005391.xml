Hand sanitizing packet and methods 
 

 Abstract: Described are methods and apparatus for promoting and attaining effective hand hygiene based on the employment of a class of packaging which provides timely access to and convenient use of hand sanitizing fluids for hand rubbing. A specific and novel type of package representative of this class found to be particularly useful in facilitating this method is a small, flat, disposable, twin chambered, multi-dose, self-sealing polymer packet designed to be pocket carried by the user. Through simple and direct finger manipulation a measured dose of hand sanitizing fluid is drawn on to the hand in a controlled and wasteless manner from a metering chamber opened for dispersal through a tear in the packet wall. The self-sealing packet reserves and preserves the remaining fluid for future uses and permits the packet to be immediately returned to a pocket without any closure manipulation. Rubbing the hands to distribute the fluid achieves an effective degree of hand sanitation by substantially reducing the presence of hand-borne pathogens. Distribution of the packets is encouraged by the use of lottery and gaming techniques that heighten the opportunity of using a hand sanitizing fluid for proper hand hygiene. ...

[0001] This is a Divisional application of parent application Ser. No.
 10/602,448 filed Jun. 24, 2003.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[0002] The present invention relates to hand sanitation apparatus and
 methods making the dispensing of a hand sanitizing fluid both timely and
 convenient. More particularly the present invention relates to the easy
 use features of small disposable multidose packets inconspicuously
 carried by a user and methods promoting their at hand availability which
 contribute to their timely use in reducing hand-borne pathogens.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] It is well understood that microbiological pathogens on the hands
 transferred to other body parts such as the mouth, nose and eyes are the
 primary cause of infectious disease in humans. The actual scope of the
 damage caused by infections resulting from hand-borne pathogens is
 generally less known. Fully eighty percent of all infections ranging from
 the usually benign cold and more debilitating flu to the truly horrific
 deadly Ebola, and everything in between, are transmitted by touch. The
 average American will contract two to four cold or flu infections in a
 typical year, experience four to six significant gastrointestinal
 disruptions during the same period. Colds alone account for an annual
 loss of 300 million person days of work and school annually; flus cost
 Americans $10 billion a year in lost wages and medical expenditures in
 addition to the 20,000 to 50,000 deaths each year from complications of
 influenza infections. Additionally, over and above the readily recognized
 cause and effect of the rapid onset of miseries characterized by the
 likes of a Norwalk virus attack, there is a growing body of evidence and
 in some cases solid proof that many major chronic diseases like gastric
 ulcers, stomach cancer, heart disease, cervical cancer, ALS (Lou Gehrig&apos;s
 disease), and Alzheimer&apos;s, most characterized by a much delayed onset,
 are infectious germ-based diseases that follow the same hand-based route
 into the body as the common cold rhinovirus. The scope of this generally
 unrecognized hidden plague associated with infectious diseases has been
 discussed for years within the medical community and more recently has
 found its way into the popular press, Atlantic Monthly, February 1999,
 (&quot;A New Germ Theory&quot;). It is sobering to realize the risk of a hand-borne
 infection is not just the occasional case of the sniffles but possibly
 the source of a life-long debilitating disease, a crippling condition
 leading to an early death, or most terrible, a tragic living death
 strangling all hope and affection. For years the famed Mayo Clinic has
 used the following blunt slogan in an attempt to drive home a point about
 the need for effective hand hygiene to combat serious diseases: &quot;The ten
 worst sources of contagion are our fingers.&quot;

[0004] Each year more than 2 million hospital acquired (nosocomial)
 infections occur in the United States, costing some $4.5 billion in
 additional charges. The Centers for Disease Control estimates more than
 one-third of healthcare associated infections can be prevented through
 better infection control programs of which hand cleaning is the
 centerpiece for reducing the spread of infection. Hospitals are only one
 of many organizations burdened with hand-borne disease costs. A recent
 school study found that classrooms that made hand sanitizing fluid
 dispensers simply available for use showed a 20% reduction in student
 absenteeism due to illness as well as a 10% decrease in teacher
 absenteeism. Several recent articles provide an understanding of the
 current level of technology available for hand sanitation and further
 describe the significant limiting problems the present art faces.

[0005] In March 2001 an American Journal of Nursing article (&quot;Impact Rate
 of Compliance with Hand Antisepsis . . . &quot;) stated that 80,000 hospital
 deaths occur each year as a result of nosocomial infections contracted
 during their stays. Further, that &quot;it&apos;s common knowledge that the hands
 of heath care workers can carry disease-causing organisms from one
 patient to another and that hand antisepsis before and after each patent
 contact is crucial to the prevention and control of nosocomial
 infection.&quot; The reasons most often cited by hospital staff for failing to
 clean their hands adequately are inconvenience and no time. Given the
 hectic and demanding nature of their workload these are not excuses but
 simply statements of reality. That convenience and time are critical
 factors in maintaining hand sanitation is underscored by the finding in
 this study that placing hand sanitizing fluid dispensers &quot;in the hallways
 outside patient rooms were nearly 30 times more likely to be used than
 dispensers mounted anywhere inside the rooms.&quot; Yet the most disturbing
 finding of this study was that full compliance with hand antisepsis
 guidelines was an unrealistic goal. That while hand sanitizing fluids
 took less time than washing and the placement of numerous dispensers
 bottles made matters somewhat more convenient, even with the heightened
 attention impact of the study itself (the Hawthorne effect), compliance
 did not achieve more than 60% at any time during the study. And it is
 well understood that over time, after the study is done and gone, a drift
 back to much lower compliance rates is inevitable, the dispenser bottle
 becomes just one more thing in the room, like soap at the sink, rarely
 used and only when time and convenience allowed.

[0006] In March 2002 an article in Infection Control and Hospital
 Epidemiology (&quot;Promotion of Hand Hygiene: Magic, Hype, or Scientific
 Challenge? &quot;) restates the conditions for promoting adequate hand
 hygiene. &quot;Among enabling factors, engineering control must be considered
 for the successful promotion of hand hygiene. In particular, it involves
 making hand hygiene easy, convenient, and possible in a timely fashion.&quot;
 Another observation made is that the higher rates of compliance seen in
 studies can only be sustained when some form of cost-effective,
 non-intrusive monitoring is invented. &quot;My personal opinion is that
 obtaining a sustained and never-ending Hawthorne effect associated with
 improved compliance with hand hygiene and decreased infection and
 cross-transmission rates should be the dream of every hospital
 epidemiologist. Let&apos;s find a cost-effective way to induce it.&quot; This need
 remains yet unfilled in the marketplace and published art.

[0007] In July 2000 another article in Infection Control and Hospital
 Epidemiology (&quot;Using Alcohol for Hand Antisepsis--Dispelling Old Myths&quot;)
 the qualities and values of alcohol-based hand antiseptics are described.
 The author points out the cost benefits of hand sanitizing fluids in
 hospitals. &quot; . . . administrators should consider that modest increase in
 acquisition costs for alcohol-based hand hygiene products are tiny in
 comparison to excess hospital costs associated with nosocomial
 infections. If increased use of an alcohol gel or rinse reduces the
 number of serious nosocomial infections by a few a year, the cost savings
 from prevented infections should more than offset incremental costs of
 using alcohol-based preparations.&quot; These offset costs are those the
 hospital would charge as operational costs. Not considered are the much
 more substantial costs of the damage awards issuing from pain and
 suffering lawsuits won by patient and their attorneys for the hospital&apos;s
 failure to follow best practice protocols.

[0008] In March 2001 an article in Emerging Infectious Diseases
 (&quot;Antiseptic Technology: Access, Affordability, and Acceptance&quot;) further
 reinforces the findings that time and convenience are critical compliance
 factors. Detailed costs of implementing a hand hygiene program are also
 provided.

[0009] A final article in the October 2000 issue of Family Medicine
 (&quot;Alcohol-free Instant Hand Sanitizer Reduces Elementary School Illness
 Absenteeism&quot;) reports a remarkable reduction in absenteeism when hand
 sanitizers were introduced in public school classrooms. Results showed
 students using hand sanitizing fluids &quot;were found to have 41.9% fewer
 illness-related absence days, representing a 28.9% and a 49.7% drop in
 gastrointestinal- and respiratory-related illness, respectively . . .
 Conclusion: Daily use of the instant hand sanitizer was associated with
 significantly lower rates of illness-related absenteeism.&quot; In this study
 the close monitoring and continual instruction of the test group by
 teachers largely abrogated the issues of time and convenience.
 Nevertheless, it clearly indicates the significant impact consistent and
 rigorous hand sanitation can have in schools and the implications for
 parallel benefits at all levels of society are obvious. As the reports
 point out in describing the interlinking cost of disease &quot;Even if one
 doesn&apos;t have school-age children, it is necessary to understand the
 importance and benefits of good hand hygiene, not only in clinical
 practice but also in the greater community. Vital tax dollars will be
 saved on expenses for remedial student services and employee work time by
 this simple and effective way to decrease illness-related absenteeism.&quot;

[0010] That improved hand hygiene can be achieved by using various hand
 sanitizing fluids is beyond question, the problems preventing this known
 technique for achieving a high degree of use (compliance) are equally
 understood as being time required and convenience use. These same twin
 factors are true in the vastly greater pool of the general population,
 with the addition of a third very important factor--easy availability to
 achieve timely use, in a word, timeliness. In hospitals and schools
 availability is defined in terms of convenience and it has been
 repeatedly shown the placement of bottle dispensers in rooms,
 particularly by a door, leads to statistically significantly improvements
 in hand hygiene and related disease. It has also been shown that
 recidivism is immediate when compliance monitoring stops. For the general
 population an approach emphasizing wide distribution, ready access,
 convenient use, inconspicuous, omnipresence, and timely applications are
 key factors. The state of the art as defined by the marketplace and
 patent literature does not provide either methods or devices that
 adequately respond to these requirements. Dispensers hung on walls or set
 on counters have proven only marginally effective in even the controlled
 environments of hospitals and schools; in public their effectiveness
 rating falls to near zero. The answer lies in development of an
 inexpensive, disposable, multi-dose, small, convenient, self-sealing,
 ubiquitous, inconspicuous, and pocket carried packet dispenser of hand
 sanitizing fluid that can be accessed in a timely manner and reused
 several times during the course of a day&apos;s normal activities. Successful
 methods promoting the wide distribution of such packets would contribute
 to eventual habitual use.

[0011] There are only two types of pocket carried hand sanitizing fluid
 dispensers known to be currently offered in the marketplace. The first
 type is represented by a small bottle containing a 62% ethyl alcohol
 antimicrobial agent manufactured by Gojo Industries
 (http://66.181.86.144/cgi-bin/gojo/). It is a 15-milliliter translucent
 thermoformed bottle of hand sanitizing fluid with a snap cap closure with
 overall dimensions of 5.times.2.5.times.1.5 centimeters and some 18 cubic
 centimeters in volume. Dispersement is accomplished by popping open the
 snap lid, squeezing or shaking out several drops into an open hand,
 recapping the bottle, and returning it to a pocket. This dispenser has
 been in the marketplace since at least 1997. A second dispenser type that
 irregularly appears in the marketplace is a single-use metal foil packet
 containing 1.5-millilters of 60% ethyl alcohol with various herbal
 extracts and sometimes various emollients. Lafayette Promotional
 (http://216.223.163.4/products/hand_gel_packets.htm) is one of several
 distributors of this packet form. The foil packet typically measures
 5.times.7.5.times.0.3 centimeters with a volume of about 2 cubic
 centimeters. Dispensing is accomplished by tearing the foil at a corner
 edge, pouring or squeezing out the fluid, and discarding the empty foil
 package. Both types of products appears to have achieved a degree of
 success in the marketplace as evidenced by their continued presence on
 the web, of the two the bottle is overwhelming more commonly found. There
 are literally dozens of other suppliers offering the same types of
 dispensers.

[0012] Why these two packaging styles have not met with more success in a
 potentially huge market has likely more to do with fashion, habit and
 convenient access than a failure of the public to appreciate the health
 threat poised by hand-borne pathogens. Many people understand and
 appreciate the need for clean hands but just fall far short in practice.
 It has proven so inconvenient to perform the frequent and necessarily
 timely hand rubbings that provide an effective level of protection that
 the habit has simply never become established in any significant
 population group. In the case of the bottle its size, particularly its
 thickness, creates such a noticeable bulge in a shirt or pants pocket
 that it makes a negative fashion statement only equaled by pocket
 protectors in high school; further, the highly visible process involved
 in handling the bottle during the act of dispensing definitely conveys an
 unfortunate phobic impression about the user. Despite the efforts of
 hundreds of school boards across the nation not even elementary kids
 could be persuaded to carry and regularly use these small bottles; it
 just isn&apos;t fashionable and certainly less than cool. In the case of the
 single-use foil packet the need to carry several, typically four to seven
 a day, plus the need to discard an empty packet each time, severely works
 against public acceptance. Further, the need for the antimicrobial
 material to be necessarily runny in order to be easily extracted from the
 opaque foil packet leads to loss of the material from the hand through
 accidental runoff, and increasing the viscosity leads to significant
 difficulty in emptying the foil packet in a expedient manner without an
 unfortunate degree of very unwelcome messiness. These and other
 shortcomings have left the only two known types of carried hand
 sanitizing fluid dispenser products with a somewhat limited public
 appeal. Based on an extensive review of commercial literature no other
 packaging techniques are known to be in the marketplace today nor could
 there be found any suggestion of a more effective alternative solution to
 the small bottle or the single-use foil packet approaches. There is a
 distinct and unmet need for a middle product, a hand sanitizing fluid
 dispenser that functionally fits between these current marketplace
 offerings. A product adequate for a full day&apos;s needs of four to seven
 rubbings, that is without bulk, operates in a self-sealing manner, can be
 accessed easily, permits discrete usage, and is sufficiently affordable
 to be omnipresent and disposable.

[0013] Other prior art as described in the patent literature offers few
 relevant disclosures and what could be found is discussed as follows. The
 pertinent patent art can be divided into four subject areas: Packets with
 Rupturable Barriers (6), Single-Use Packets (2), Tortuous Path Seals (4),
 and various Sealing Valves (6). There have been numerous prior art
 devices for dispensing liquids, but out of the entire prior art only one
 (Kocker U.S. Pat. No. 6,228,375) deals specifically with a disposable
 hand sanitizing fluid dispensing packet and an associated hand hygiene
 method based on the single-use packet. Kocker disclosed a packet that
 will be more fully described below in Single-Use Packets category. The
 other cited patents herein deal almost exclusively with techniques for
 opening, dispersing and sealing various packet configurations. As
 portions of the present invention use in unique configurations many of
 these features, in addition to a newly discovered deforming self-sealing
 choke valve and other original features, it is useful to review the prior
 art so novel differentiation and inventive fashions can be clearly
 delineated.

[0014] In the first group (Packets with Rupturable Barriers) there are six
 patents that are relevant in some fashion.

Miller U.S. Pat. No. 3,913,789 disclosed a fluid containing packet with a
 weakly sealed and thus breakable area in the peripheral seal which forms
 an opening when pressure is applied via a flexible wall to the contained
 fluid.

Strenger U.S. Pat. No. 4,759,472 disclosed a rupturable seal that when
 burst by fluid pressure flowed into a diverter area to meter out a
 controlled flow.

Farmer U.S. Pat. No. 4,872,556 disclosed a single portion packet with two
 seams that peel apart under pressure forming a discharge opening.

Lane U.S. Pat. No. 4,890,744 disclosed a single-use with one or more
 pressure rupturable frangible seals and controlled dispersing chamber.

Farmer U.S. Pat. No. 5,131,760 disclosed a single-use dual chamber
 dispenser with rupturable membranes to control the discharge of the
 fluid.

May U.S. Pat. No. 6,379,069 disclosed a tube dispenser with a rupturable
 dividing membrane with weakening folds and creases.

[0015] The present invention does not employ any rupturable membrane seals
 nor do any of the above disclose or suggest their usage in a hand
 sanitizing method. Two patents in the Single-Use group are as follows:

[0016] Kocher U.S. Pat. No. 6,228,375 disclosed a single-use, single
 chamber disposable packet containing a hand sanitizing fluid that is
 either dispersed as a spray when a seal bursts under pressure or a tear
 is made in the packet. A method using single-use packets for hand
 sanitation is claimed.

Sokolsky U.S. Pat. No. 6,360,916 disclosed a single-serving condiment
 pouch employing a trapezoidal shaped configuration and opening to
 dispense a flat ribbon of food condiment.

[0017] Neither of the two single-use packets disclose or suggest the
 multidose, seal-sealing valve packets, or methods using same of the
 present invention. Four patents in the Tortuous Path Seal group are as
 follows:

Kaplan U.S. Pat. No. 2,707,581 disclosed a flexible dispensing container
 with a tortuous passage serving as a spring check valve which allows
 fluid to flow when placed under pressure.

Jamison U.S. Pat. No. 4,491,245 discloses a flow channel with a
 serpentine configuration and a spout tear for dispersement.

Billman U.S. Pat. No. 5,018,646 disclosed a serpentine discharge
 configuration protected from being deformed by wall indentations of the
 container.

Zakensberg U.S. Pat. No. 5,839,609 disclosed a tortuous path valve of
 thermoformed ridges and recesses to form a positive seal for the pack.

[0018] None of the four Tortuous Path group disclosed or suggested a
 deforming self-sealing valve/choke of the present invention nor do they
 disclose or suggest any hand sanitizing method. The final group, Sealing
 Valves, with six patents are as follows:

Volckening U.S. Pat. No. 3,184,121 disclosed a flexible package with a
 discharge outlet passage of resilient material capable of self-closing
 following a pressure induced passage of fluid.

Brown U.S. Pat. No. 3,278,085 disclosed a liquid squeeze tube with a fold
 over flap seal for containing the remaining fluid following a use.

Hellstrom U.S. Pat. No. 3,635,376 disclosed a package container with a
 snap open/close valve of tensed flexible sheets to control flow.

Haggar U.S. Pat. No. 4,328,912 disclosed a dispensing package using a
 convex/concave pop valve to control a flow channel and thus regulate
 multiple doses.

Chan U.S. Pat. No. 5,529,224 disclosed a self-closing liquid dispensing
 package with a self-sealing flat channel valve that relies on pre-tensed
 resilience to resealing following pressure induced dispersement from a
 thermoformed reservoir.

Farmer U.S. Pat. No. 6,244,468 disclosed use of a spaced pair of
 pre-tensed transverse creasing folds as a self-sealing valve for
 dispersing liquid soaps by a stripping action.

[0019] None of the six Sealing Valves disclosed or suggested a deforming
 self-sealing choke valve of the present invention nor do they indicate
 any use in a hand sanitizing method. No prior art in either the
 literature or patents could be found which addressed the use of lottery
 or gaming promotion techniques associated with hand sanitizing fluid
 dispensers and packaging thereof.

[0020] The above discussed current practices and known forms of dispensers
 together with various packaging types, all were found deficient in
 several respects. Significantly, none of the above references taken in
 part or as a whole presents a convenient, timely, and effective way of
 facilitating the use of hand sanitizing fluids achievable by means of a
 small, flat, clear, disposable, twin chambered, multi-dose, self-sealing,
 polymer, pocket carried packet. None overcome the recognized problems of
 timeliness, convenience, and accessibility provided by the advancement to
 the art the present invention contributes.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0021] The present invention recognizes and addresses the foregoing
 disadvantages and shortcomings of the prior art. Accordingly it is a
 primary intent of the present invention to provide a distinctly novel
 product concept (packet) and equally important innovative method using
 the packaging concept to overcome the problems of time, convenience, and
 timeliness which have previously curtailed the effective use of hand
 sanitizing fluids by the general population. Further, a method is
 disclosed whereby distribution of packets is encouraged by the use of
 lottery and gaming techniques which heighten the opportunity of using a
 hand sanitizing fluid for hand hygiene simply because the packet was
 obtained and retained at hand in hopes of it being a winner. And hence
 the AtHand.TM. brand name and trademark identifying both the packet
 packaging and associated methods. A key element in making such a
 multi-dose packet a reality was the discovery that a simple arrangements
 of design components could constitute a seal-forming choke valve and an
 associated weakly adhesive film valve made from existing packet materials
 could retain and preserve highly volatile hand sanitizing fluids over a
 day&apos;s time despite many openings for usage. All hand sanitizing fluids
 have one important attribute in addition to killing pathogens, they
 evaporate very quickly from the hands. Understandable enough given they
 are typically some two-thirds alcohol. In less than a minute, usually
 under thirty seconds, the hands are dry, the liquid evaporated and gone.
 How could a cheap, simple packet retain such a vaporous fluid over hours
 or even days after being opened? Bottles used for such purposes have
 substantial caps, tight seals, and thick walled bodies to preserve their
 fluids, how could a necessarily cheap, flimsy packet accomplish such
 protection once opened? By trial and error investigation, pursued
 following a chance observation that a film of reagent grade alcohol
 trapped between two loose sheets of plastic film did not evaporate
 quickly, it was discovered that a packet could be created that employed a
 dispensing means that so limited evaporation the loss became
 inconsequential even over days of time. Later discovery of the deforming
 choke valve provided a necessary element of overall robustness to the
 fluid control. These discoveries held up even in the rough handling
 commonly found in pants pockets, even at the elevated temperatures
 generated by body heat. This discovery that highly volatile hand
 sanitizing fluids could be packaged in a new and novel manner opened the
 door to the present invention.

[0022] A primary object of the present invention is to provide a novel and
 significant advancement in the art of hand sanitizing dispensing
 apparatus in the form of a packet which overcomes the problems of time,
 convenience, and timeliness by being small, flat, multi-dose,
 self-sealing, inconspicuous, clean dispensing and pocket carried.

[0023] Another object of the present invention is a method promoting and
 attaining hand sanitation by using carried multi-dose packets of hand
 sanitizing fluid to reduce hand-borne pathogens and subsequently lower
 the rate of infectious diseases in the general population.

[0024] Another object of the present invention is a method to encourage
 the distribution and retention of hand sanitizing fluid packets through
 use of lottery and gaming techniques that heighten the opportunity the
 packets will be available for use in a timely act of hand hygiene
 maintenance.

[0025] Another object of the present invention is the use of transparent
 material for the packet body to assist in fluid manipulation, dose
 measurement, color based selection, quantity/quality determination, and
 other visually based judgements and actions made possible by a clear body
 packet material.

[0026] Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a very
 simple but effective engineered valve or choke arrangement to govern the
 passage of fluid within the packet and act as a self-sealing closure to
 retain and preserve remaining fluid for future dispersement.

[0027] A final object of the present invention is the use of a packet
 stripping chamber that deploys a measured dose of hand sanitizing fluid
 directly into a cupped hand and finger arrangement that substantially
 eliminates mess and waste while significantly improving convenient usage.

[0028] Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become
 apparent from the following description taken in conjunction where
 appropriate with the accompanying drawings wherein are set forth, by way
 of illustration and example, certain embodiments of this invention. The
 drawings constitute a part of this specification and include exemplary

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

[0036] While the invention will be described in connection with
 illustrations, descriptions, and examples of preferred embodiments, it
 will be understood these are not intended to limit the present invention
 only to these embodiments. On the contrary, the present invention is to
 cover all structural and/or functional alternatives as defined by the
 appended claims.

[0037] The term &quot;hand sanitizing fluid&quot; as used herein refers to any
 non-irritating, antimicrobial-containing composition in the form of a
 fluid, gel, spray, foam, cream, lotion, or tincture preparation designed
 for frequent use that can reduce the number of transient microorganisms,
 specifically pathogens, when applied to and dispersed over the hands and
 other skin areas. Such preparations have a broad antimicrobial spectrum,
 are fast-acting, and are often persistent. Representative of such agents
 are alcohols (e.g. ethyl and isopropyl), iodines (e.g. hexachlorophene),
 bisbiquanides (e.g. Chlorhexidine digluconate), and quaternary ammonium
 salts (e.g. Benzalkonium chloride) which are formulated singularly or in
 combination. This term is specifically intended to include all such
 preparations, known and unknown, that are capable of achieving a
 substantial reduction of skin residing pathogens when applied to the
 hands or other areas of human skin where such pathogens are found.

[0038] The term &quot;flexible polymeric material&quot; as used herein refers to any
 polymer film capable of being constructed into a packet for containment
 and preservation of a hand sanitizing fluid. Such polymer films as may
 prove useful for this purpose have sufficient flexibility to yield to
 finger pressure, are sufficiently durable to withstand reasonable
 hydraulic pressure created by fingers, have good crack and puncture
 resistance, have very good chemical resistance and low gas permeability,
 and are capable of being sealed to self or other materials.
 Representative of such films are polypropylene and polyethylene. Numerous
 grades, gauges, textures, combined in many lamination varieties, formed
 by many techniques, with numerous additives, and an even greater numbers
 of formulations provide a wide array of polymeric materials to select
 from, singularly or in combination, to satisfy the specific chemical,
 physical, and aesthetic attributes required for a specific packet&apos;s
 construction, its content&apos;s formulation, and the precise function for
 which it is intended. All known and yet unknown polymer materials
 functionally suited for use in constructing multi-dose packets containing
 hand sanitizing fluids are envisioned by use of this term.

[0039] The present invention is best understood by several examples that
 illustrates and describes how various aspects of each apparatus and
 method functions. Example 1 details the hand sanitizing fluid packet by
 means of illustrations (FIGS. 1-8) and operational descriptions. Example
 2 describes a method using hand sanitizing fluid packets to achieve and
 maintain an effective level of personal hand hygiene. Example 3 describes
 a method encouraging the distribution and retention of hand sanitizing
 fluid packets for hand sanitation by keeping them handy by various
 lottery and gaming techniques.

EXAMPLE 1

Multi-Dose Hand Sanitizing Fluid Packet

[0040] The preferred embodiment of the packet generally designated by the
 reference number 10 of FIGS. 1 and 2 has a peripheral seal 20 joining
 front and back walls 23 of flexible polymeric material (2-mil
 polypropylene) to enclose and contain a hand sanitizing fluid 11 (Purell
 Hand Sanitizer, 62% alcohol) with two chambers, a first chamber 12 and a
 second chamber 14. Overall dimensions in this packet embodiment are
 9.times.3.times.0.5 centimeters with first chamber 6-centimeters long and
 second chamber 2.5-centimeters long and the balance of the length in
 sealed edges 20 and margins 18. Creating and dividing these adjacent
 chambers is a partitioning means in the form of a two-part barrier 17a
 and 17b created by sealing the front and back walls 23 in a like manner
 used to create the peripheral seal 20. Creation of the seals can be
 achieved by a number of means well known in the art, herein the common
 technique involving heat and pressure are used to create the seals. The
 two distinct chambers, 12 and 14, are in fluidic communication in that
 the contained fluid 11 can be transferred between the two chambers, 12
 and 14, by a relatively small constrictive gap (about 1-millimeter or
 less) 15 in the thin barrier seal (about 1-millimeter wide) 17a/b. This
 inter-chamber fluidic transfer is made possible by appropriate placed
 stresses such as pressure applied to the pocket walls 23 of flexible
 polymeric material by fingers. In FIGS. 5 and 6 the filled reservoir of
 the first chamber 12 is shown in a cross section view, FIG. 6 shows
 fingers 41 and 42 applying pressure and filling second chamber 14 with
 fluid 11.

[0041] Typically, the first chamber 12 acts as a reservoir of hand
 sanitizing fluid (typically 3-millimeters, but ranging 2-8 millimeters)
 that constitutes plural doses of fluid 11 to be dispersed over perhaps a
 day&apos;s time. By applying pressure to the first chamber 12, fluid 11 is
 pushed through the barrier gap 15 into the second chamber 14. The amount
 of fluid 11 transferred from the first 12 to second chamber 11 is easily
 controlled by the amount of pressure applied and gauged by eye given the
 transparency of at least part of one wall 23 of the packet 10. When a
 predetermined amount of fluid 11 has been transferred, typically 1-2
 milliliters, into the second chamber 14, a tear 22 is created by fingers
 in the second chamber 14 walls 23 starting at a manufactured notch 19 in
 the margin 18 beyond the peripheral seal 20 at the top of the second
 chamber 14. This tear 22 forms the dispersal exit for the measured dose
 of fluid 11 from the second chamber 14. Dispersal is accomplished by
 holding the packet by the fingers of one hand in the area of the first
 chamber 12, placing thumb and forefinger of the other hand on opposite
 walls 23 of the second chamber 14 at the barrier seal 17a/b, and
 stripping the second chamber&apos;s 14 measured dose of fluid 11 toward and
 out of the exit tear 22 into the cupped hand created by the finger
 arrangement. The second chamber 14 has performed the role of first
 holding the measured fluid 11 transfer from the reservoir first chamber
 12 and then acted as a dispensing structures that cleanly, accurately,
 and with little or no waste deposited the dose into a hand for rubbing
 and reduction of hand-borne pathogens. A third role for the second
 chamber 14 is now begun; the interior surfaces of the second chamber&apos;s 14
 wall 23 still retain a thin film of fluid 11. This thin residue weakly
 holds the walls 23 together, partially by adhesion and somewhat by the
 dynamics that govern fluidic films. By holding the walls 23 together a
 minute surface area is exposed to evaporation in the area of the tear 22,
 consequently there is little lose of fluid 11 at the film/atmosphere
 interface and it slows even more as the interface edge surface does
 retreat between the walls to a point where the retreat stops, a point
 where the atmospheric boundary becomes so saturated with evaporated fluid
 11 and lack of atmospheric circulation that for all purposes a seal is
 formed preventing further loss. The second chamber 14 has become a
 dispensing valve means, a form of film seal, specifically designed to
 control loss of fluid 11 from the packet 10 by retarding evaporation and
 leakage.

[0042] This dispensing valve works in conjunction with a second fluid
 control means created by the barrier 17a/b and the gap 15 therein. The
 barrier 17a/b and gap 15 structures illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4 show
 alternatives positions of the two-part barrier 17a and 17b. In FIG. 3 the
 barrier parts 17a/b are placed so as to form a conjunctive angle to one
 another as they bear on forming the gap 15. This is in contrast to the
 aligned relationship of the barrier 17a/b shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. In FIG.
 4 the barrier 17a/b shows as offset, asymmetrical position of the gap 15.
 All these barrier gap 15 positions and barrier 17a/b alignments produced
 comparable results.

[0043] In FIG. 2 marks 32 and 33 on the body of the packet 10 are shown as
 printing on the exterior surface of a packet 10 wall 23. Such marks can
 denote a wide range of meanings and values, including such useful
 communications as addresses, advertising messages, call numbers, codes,
 company names, event commemorations, event dates, decorative art,
 facility names, formulas, fortune predictions, gaming symbols,
 instructions, internet addresses, logos, lottery numbers, lottery
 symbols, meaningful images, notations, promotional slogans, raffle
 numbers, schedules, trademarks, and other meaningful communications. In
 this example &quot;Tongass Bay Alaska Cruise August 2004&quot; commemorates a
 cruise ship&apos;s visit to a remote locale. Making one wall 23 or a portion
 of the packet 10 opaque facilitates the reading or deciphering of any
 marking placed on the packet 10.

[0044] The gap 15 forms a fluid passage governing means that can, when
 actuated by fluidic pressure originating from either chamber, stops
 fluidic communication between the chamber up to a moderate level of such
 pressure. This governing means takes the form of a self-forming choke
 that stops low level pressure pushing fluid 11 into the second chamber 14
 and destroying the weak film seal which could lead to substantial leakage
 and loss of fluid 11 after an initial usage. Under even slight pressure
 the gap&apos;s 15 design created by it small width defined by the two barrier
 17a/b ends resists fluid movement and builds pressure on the flexible
 walls surrounding the gap 15 area. In FIG. 7 this reservoir pressure 61
 distorts the packet walls 23 in the gap 15 and closes the opening 52 by
 lateral pressure 62 deforming in a crimping fashion the flexible nature
 of the polymeric material used to form the walls 23 of the packet. A
 choke valve 52 self-formed by pressure capable of moving the fluid 11
 through the choke area, the gap 15, restricts that same flow. This
 restriction is sufficient to control unintended discharges from the first
 chamber 12 into the second chamber 14 and out through the exit tear 22
 that would create unexpected leakage and similar undesirable discharges.
 The choke can be opened in two ways to allow fluid passage into the
 second chamber 14 when intended and desirable. Simply by continuing to
 increase the pressure applied to the walls 23, it will eventually become
 possible to overcome the self-formed choke and fluid 11 will squirt into
 the second chamber 14. The pressure required can be significantly high
 and possibly beyond the strength of some users. A second and easier
 method of opening the choke 52 is shown in FIG. 8 where tension 63
 applied to the notched 19 end of the second chamber 14. By pulling on the
 packet 10 end where the tear 22 is located, while holding and applying
 pressure to the first chamber 12 reservoir of fluid 11, the deformed gap
 15 area of the choke 52 is straightened out 62 sufficient to allow the
 fluid 11 to pass into the second chamber 14 for eventual discharge
 through the tear 22 exit. The release of pressure or it dropping below a
 certain level either removes the self-forming choke 52 or allows the
 choke 52 to reform, in either case fluid 11 flow is once again
 restricted.

[0045] Transparent walls 23 of the packet permit a number of novel
 advances in the art of hand sanitizing fluid dispensers. With clear walls
 23 it becomes possible to visually inspect the quantity and location of
 the fluid 11 in the first 12 and second 14 chambers so proper
 manipulation is possible. The same clear walls 23 facilitate stripping
 the fluid for dispersement. Visual inspection for the quality of the
 fluid 11 is also made possible. Packet selection made by sight based on
 the color of the fluid 11 is now also possible, as can the same
 opportunity for choice selection based on fluid 11 color indicating the
 inclusion of specific additives or formulation with specific
 antimicrobial properties. Clear walls 23 also permit inspection to
 determine the degree of completeness when kneading the fluid 11 is
 necessary to mix separated ingredients.

[0046] It should be noted that by design, materials are called upon to
 perform many different role, thus packaging is kept to a minimal amount
 to reduce ecological impacts, lower costs, and contribute to the packet&apos;s
 small size. Fluid waste is also negligible by virtue that every drop can
 be effectively stripped from the packet 10. Small bottles consume many
 times the packet&apos;s 10 packaging resources and are notoriously wasteful of
 the fluid left trapped inside. The packet 10 permits full extraction of
 hand sanitizing fluid 11 leading to a greater economy of usage.

EXAMPLE 2

Hand Sanitation Method

[0047] A disposable multi-dose packet of hand sanitizing fluid with
 self-sealing features that is unobtrusively carried in an easily
 accessible pocket would greatly contribute to the timely need to sanitize
 hands several times a day. Convenience of use and access are key
 features. For example, follow this narrative of a typical use that
 illustrates the promotion and subsequent attainment of effective hand
 sanitation. A father takes his daughter to a fast-food restaurant for
 lunch while out shopping. He places their order at the counter, pays,
 receives change, and their food tray. They find a booth and sit down.
 Before digging in, the father quickly retrieves from his shirt pocket a
 hand sanitizing fluid packet he had opened earlier in the morning after
 handling many items at a popular flea market. He offers the packet end to
 his daughter who reaches out and strips a dose of hand sanitizing fluid
 into her cupped hand and rubs. He does the same and drops the packet back
 into his packet without further ado. They now enjoy their lunch with a
 sense of well being, knowing the risk of hand-borne pathogens has been
 addressed.

[0048] This scenario is useful for purposes other than a functional
 illustration. The father may have bought the packet for his own and his
 family&apos;s health benefit, or he may have obtained the packet at a mall as
 a promotional item when he bought a book, conducted a bank transaction,
 or picked up a prescription at his health clinic. Or perhaps it was
 leftover from a recent air flight or vacation aboard a cruise ship. It
 might have been bought or distributed in a number of circumstances
 including air travel, assemblages, barrooms, business dealings, checkout
 counters, conventions, cruise ships, disaster relief, educational
 facilities, elder care facilities, expeditions, financial institutions,
 food services, ground transportation, health clinics, hospitals,
 livestock events, lodgings, malls, manufacturing facilities, meetings,
 military installations, offices, parties, political gatherings, potlucks,
 prisons, promotional events, public events, public facilities, religious
 services, rest homes, schools, service counters, shops, sporting events,
 theaters, toilet facilities, zoos and other situations. Whatever its
 origin, the wide distribution has contributed to its use this day, at
 this table, for their health benefit.

[0049] Various modes of carrying the packet are also useful in promoting
 and attaining hand sanitation. By placing hand sanitizing fluid packets
 in carrying devices other than pockets, the opportunities for a timely
 reminder and access are improved. Placing a hand sanitizing fluid packet
 in a backpack, belt pack, briefcase, computer case, garment, lanyard
 attachment, lunchbox, lunch bag, notebook, purse, pocket, sports bag,
 toolbox, telephone carrier, or wristband increases the probability of
 use.

[0050] Perhaps the narrative of the father and daughter at lunch would be
 more telling if instead of the father offering the packet to the
 daughter, the child offered a packet to the father. She picked up the
 habit in school and was now sharing it, with justifiable pride, with her
 father.

EXAMPLE 3

Lottery and Gaming Promotion Method

[0051] Habit formation is initially based on repetitive action and a key
 element in making that repetitive action possible is available
 circumstances. For example, the habit of using a fork to eat is not
 likely to develop if a fork is missing when food is served. The same is
 true in developing the habit of using hand sanitizing fluid packets to
 regularly sanitizing hands; the packets must be available at all times to
 form the habit of cleaning hands. Any and all techniques useful to
 distributing and having the user retain a hand sanitizing fluid packet is
 a major step toward developing a use habit simply because the packet is
 available in an opportune and timely manner.

[0052] One technique for promoting hand sanitation is to introduce lottery
 and gaming aspects so as to encourage the distribution and retention of
 hand sanitizing fluid packets. In the following scenario a lottery
 encourages and supports a significant health objective. A cruise ship&apos;s
 company is concerned about an outbreak of the nasty gastrointestinal
 Norwalk flu; two other ships in the fleet have had so many cases whole
 trips have been cancelled to decontaminate the vessels. The owners,
 officers, and crew can ill afford the staggering losses an outbreak would
 cause; passengers are understandable nervous about getting sick during a
 long planned vacation. The ship&apos;s officers and crew have done and
 continue to do everything possible to keep the facilities germ-free, but
 they know the problem does not lie with the ship. It is with the
 passengers that harbor the virus. When they came aboard from around the
 world, they bring with them a veritable menagerie of germs gathered from
 home and along the way. When they take day trips ashore during the cruise
 they bring new ones aboard from these ports of call that have become
 literally crossroads of world travel. To combat these continual
 infectious assaults the ship has introduced hand sanitizing fluid
 packets, and to encourage their distribution and retention has instituted
 a dining lottery. At each meal a hand sanitizing fluid packet is passed
 out or placed with the table setting. Each packet bears a lottery number
 23 as shown in FIG. 2 along with the ship&apos;s name and company logo. The
 winning numbers will be posted in the ship&apos;s paper the following day for
 prizes of caps, shirts, and other items and services available on board.
 Every passengers will acquire, retain and hopefully use the packet when
 the benefits of use are properly and repeatedly explained. Making the
 packets so widely available through the lottery, and stressing the fact
 that everyone is in the same boat so to speak regarding public health, a
 significant reduction of hand-borne disease is a likely outcome.

[0053] Whether the motivation for acquiring the packet is to have a chance
 at a lottery prize and then used for hand sanitation, or acquired the
 packet for hand sanitation and kept them for a possible prize, the end
 results of distribution and retention are achieved. Gaming can also
 achieve the same purpose. At lunch a group of men gather to open their
 lunch bags and socialize. Included in the bags are hand sanitizing fluid
 packets with a poker hand displayed as markings, each one different based
 on the statistical spread of winning hands inherent to the game. The men
 engage in calling out real and fictional holdings to determine who buys
 the cold soft drinks or the like. The packets are also used to clean the
 hands in that they are literally already at hand. Endless gaming options
 are possible based on this simple technique, and all of which encourage
 and promote the distribution of hand sanitizing fluid packets which can
 lead to usage. Good public and private health habits are in our own
 hands.
