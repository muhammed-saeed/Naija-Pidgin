This is my FAVORITE fried chicken spot in LA.  Put it this way, I would fly home from college (San Fransisco) just to get this chicken. I know, I know sounds way out, but there is something about this chicken that I cannot get away from. I am a true adict. The funny part is I live a couple blocks away from this place, and I&apos;m not 300 lbs.

Whenever i drive by this place, I can smell it. The chicken is always fresh, hot, and on time. The fries too!!  I cannot get enough...

The best creole fried chicken in Los Angeles! I only get the wings. The place is grimey and you don&apos;t want to eat there, you probably don&apos;t even want to go in the neighborhood but if you are in the area you must have their chicken!

Worst Customer service. The workers were rude. The food was gross and extremely greasy! You can tell everything was fried in OLD oil! The chicken was EXTREMELY let me repeat EXTREMELY salty! Definitely wont be going to this place again next time I&apos;m in LA. The only thing there that was good was their egg rolls. Smh....

Good chicken, very crispy. Fries sucked though, basically just a big greasy/soggy mess. Chicken is worth coming back for though, so will try a different side next time. I wish they would get some mics or something for the bulletproof glass though...I mean, everyone has bullet proof glass around here so that isn&apos;t special, but usually I can at least somewhat hear what you are trying to say. It&apos;s funny watching the customers literally yell their order and the person behind the glass moving their lips but no sound coming out. Fun.

The parking lot hustlers are definitely aggressive, but I can&apos;t fault the business for that.

I keep hearing this is the best location, but since it&apos;s the only one I have been to I can&apos;t comment on that.

I&apos;ve always been against writing reviews on places but I had to do it.
My work place decided to hire them to cater during lunch. The first day (11/10/10), at least 100 ppl placed their orders from their truck and some waited 2 hours to get their chicken. Even though some of my coworkers said their fried chicken is simply amazing but it was not worth the long wait. Luckily I passed on the first day because the line was too long. They actually ran out of chicken and dinner rolls.
They decided to have another one the following week, which is today to make up for last week. I placed an order of 12 pieces of chicken with 2 sides and 12 dinner rolls at 11:45 am. I notice that there weren&apos;t as many people compared to last week (possibly due to the fact that they weren&apos;t happy with the long wait). The girl who took my order said it should take only 20 minutes. I decided not to wait and went back to my office to get some work done. I went back down 30 minutes later and my order was not ready. The funniest thing (sarcasm) that happened is that as I waited, people who ordered after me got theirs within 10 minutes....WTF? I asked a lady if she called my number and she said &apos;nope&apos;. 50 minutes passed and I&apos;m still waiting and people getting their fried chicken before me. I decided to ask the cook how much longer would I have to wait to get my order and he told me, &apos;I&apos;m working on yours. It&apos;s just that we are getting rid of the individual orders of 2-3 pieces out first&apos;. Ummm...I must say that&apos;s bad business practice. As I waited longer, I grew more upset. They decided to clean up and close while I&apos;m still waiting. AFTER 1 hour and 20 minutes, I finally get my order and I was the 2nd to last person. Must I say, at least 40 people ordered after me and got their orders before me. In the end, I get 19 pieces of chicken, an order of fries, 14 rolls but I did not get my 2 side orders.
I must admit the Fried Chicken is awesome....better than Popeyes. The wait was ridiculous.

Some of the best fried chicken I&apos;ve had in LA and super cheap to boot. Very juicy meat with a nice, crispy breading and definitely not soggy or greasy. I got the half chicken dinner, which came with four pieces, a huge amount of fries, and a dinner roll -- all for less than $6.

I want to try to rice and gravy next time -- judging how good the rest of the food was I feel like it can&apos;t miss either.

(Side note: the Yelp listing says they accept credit cards, but they definitely do not.)

The chicken here is beyond words. Sure, this particular Louisianas Fried Chicken is in the ghetto (Wait.  Aren&apos;t they all?) and chances are people will either try to shoot you, ask you for money, or try to sell you Nation of Islam newsletters, but it&apos;s worth it.  Also worth a chuckle is the makeshift swapmeet they now have outside.  Because what&apos;s not to love about fried chicken and 5-for-$10 t-shirts?

The other great thing about this location is that it&apos;s multicultural.
Instead of french fries, you now have the option to get some chicken fried rice.  I know, I know.  Chicken fried rice with fried chicken?  Trust me, son, it&apos;s fucking delicious.  The bland, dry rice with bits and pieces of left over chicken are balanced by the spicy, salty, juicy chicken.  This Louisiana&apos;s also offers gumbo.  It&apos;s not too spicy and it&apos;s packed with sausage (as all good things are), shredded chicken and trace amounts of crab meat.  Dispite their advertisement, I did not see shrimp but the aroma of my half-pint of gumbo told me I was in the presence of seafood...or VD.

I got the two piece meal with chicken fried rice and the gumbo for under $6.  If that ain&apos;t value, I don&apos;t know what is.  And would you believe it?  I was plenty satiated.  The other reviewers ain&apos;t lying when they say $20 can feed a small army...or a pair of sauced-up boozehounds looking for something to soak-up vodka and diet Orange Crush cocktails.

Despite drive-by&apos;s, gang bangin&apos; and other nefarious things going on at this location, I still brave the long line and indulge in ghetto fabulous, greasy chicken.

This location is 100x better than the other LFC&apos;s in L.A. Louisiana Fried Chicken It&apos;s not really a franchise; it&apos;s kind of complicated, but basically, the owners purchase the licensing rights and the secret flour and red pepper recipe that coats all the food. As far as aesthetics and promotions, owners can do whatever they want.

Apparently, this location wants to sell the best fried chicken in town. Chicken is available in pieces, wings and strips. There&apos;s also fried fish and shrimp, sides like fries, mac and cheese and hush puppies.
It takes 10 - 15 minutes for the meal to be ready because they fry everything as ordered, which makes it fresh and flaming hot when it&apos;s served.

Though the restaurant location isn&apos;t much to write home about, it&apos;s CHEAP and the quality of the food is good for what it is...a fried chicken shack in the hood. By all accounts, it&apos;s always finger-lickin&apos; good.

When my friends said come over for fried chicken, I said, &quot;okay!&quot; I love fried chicken.  I just don&apos;t eat skin. But I still got to taste their intriguing spice rub.  What is that flavor? I just couldn&apos;t taste it...though it kind of reminded me of...Chinese food.  Yes, yes, they also sell Chinese food at their locations.

He brought this chicken all the way from South Central to Altadena so the box was very moist and the chicken actually kept its crispy skin (not that I would know anything about that).  I was just happy the chicken was so juicy.  I normally like to eat drumsticks and thighs but I would actually eat the breast here first.  They were huge and very filling.

The chicken came with rolls which were steamy and hot (even after a bit of a drive). The Altadena location which we grabbed sides from didn&apos;t warm up the bread.

Pricing is pretty cheap. Now that I&apos;ve had the chicken, maybe I won&apos;t turn up my nose on this weird Chinese food/ fried chicken place.

According to their website, they have 80 locations and are opening over a dozen more. Wow, rapid expansion!

Some of my co-workers raved about the fried chicken here.
So off they went and brought some back to the office. They
were right, very tasty chicken without all the grease,   I didn&apos;t
care to much for the fries though, but they were okay.
Don&apos;t bother going to nasty KFC when you have this LFC in LA.

I come here fully armed as this place is in the &apos;hood. Straight up NO LIE.

For all the people that stare I am here for the same reason. THE FRIED CHICKEN. The fish is excellent also. Seasoned and spiced perfectly. And as I was told from the get go the chicken always some out fresh. The fish is usually cooked to order when I get it. I get both when I come here. I get some fried rice and fries too. 10 bucks can feed a small army.

It is quite a drive from where I live but there is no fried chicken like this remotely close to where I live.

Ok, are they selling crack?

Everytime I pass this location the line is wrapped around in the inside. I tired it one day because I was curious to see what the hell is going on in there. Wasn&apos;t bad but it&apos;s not something that left a lasting, gotta have it type of impression on me. Maybe it&apos;s just me.

I&apos;m starting to think maybe I don&apos;t know the code name to get the good ish. Because people are going crazy over this chicken. Can somebody give me the code to give to the dealers (I mean cook) in the back?

Now the Louisiana on Central&amp;92nd (true hood) has the BEST chicken nuggets you can wrap your lips around. Not the best location (so be careful) but worth the nuggets.

I can&apos;t say anymore than anyone else has said about this spot. It&apos;s the BEST Louisiana chicken in L.A. I even went as far as nominating them for a &quot;Hoodie&quot; award through Steve Harvey&apos;s morning show years ago. I was that  sprung on their chicken. The Colonel, Popeyes, and Churches doesn&apos;t have NOTHIN&apos; on them.

I will travel from Gardena to Manchester and Normandie just to have Louisiana Chicken because I know it will be freshly cooked because they stay  very busy. They put just the right amount of seasoning salt on their fries (if you&apos;ve read my other reviews you&apos;d see that I HEART lawry&apos;s season salt). lol

It is in South LA, so you have to man up if you&apos;re going to venture out to the &apos;hood to get some fried chicken. Pay the street vendors for a couple of their items and I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll have your back if something should pop off....just kidding...a lil. haha

Some of the greasiest Fried Chicken Ever!  I think that is why I like it.  Kinda reminds me of a watered down Pioneers chicken without the hard shell. Menu is as expected from a Fried Chicken joint.  Sweet and simple is what you want from your chicken then this is the place to go.  Try some of the sides especially the weird ones and you&apos;ll be surprised.

Oh yeah . .  . make sure you don&apos;t spend any extended period of time here  . . .  there isn&apos;t any 2 inch bullet proof drive throughs here!  LOL

People who have eaten in this area know what I&apos;m talkin about a la Taco Bell and Burger King near Hoolywood Park/Centinela Hospital.

IMHO LFC is better than KFC(less greasy,cheaper,more tasty crust) but I still prefer Church&apos;s&amp;El Pollo Loco. They do a very good job cooking their breast meat / very moist.the drumsticks&amp;thighs were average. They don&apos;t cook the chicken to order like some other yelpers have mentioned.When I was there,the chicken was already cooked&amp;ready to serve like KFC.This location is on a very busy intersection&amp;I think it&apos;s pretty safe during the day.They have bullet proof glass like some check cashing places&amp;a porthole that your chicken goes thru.

I liked LFC but I would&apos;nt go out of my way to get it.

3.6.  This place is great.  It&apos;s actually not that greasy.  I mean, as much as fried chicken can be not greasy.  The breading is spicy, has a beautiful hard shell crust.  Best of all, it&apos;s cheap.  This stuff is better than popeye&apos;s, a MILLION times better than KFC, and well, I have to say, much cheaper than Roscoe&apos;s.  Oh, and their gumbo, while not chock full of tasties, was definitely decent, and had lots of celery in it.

It was the first stop on my day of Southern food with Josh, which I&apos;ll write much more about...it was just great!

I love a good  fried chicken and this is one place to go to find crispy, flavorful chicken.  I always order atleast three pieces and the rice with gravy....I know sounds weird gravy on rice but trust me its good.

True this place is always packed so be prepared to stand in line.  It is in a rough part but I 1have never been fearful ...but then again with chicken on the mind...lol

It&apos;s the best location for the Louisiana Fried Chicken!

I&apos;ve been to two other locations and they pale in comparision. I didn&apos;t even think they belong to the same chain of restaurants they were that disappointing. I usually get the 3 piece wing with chicken with fries. The food combos are very affordable. They have fried fish combos, soup, and even some fried rice. It&apos;s always crowd  especially on a Sunday and most likely because it is small in the inside with limited sitting.  The chicken is well seasoned, it&apos;s homestyle goodness on a budget.

Oh, yeah. It&apos;s that good. And I&apos;m not even a big fried chicken fan.  But this place might make a fan out of you. And yes, while they do have tables and chairs, I&apos;ve never seen anyone actually eat there. Everyone orders take out.

Sometimes there is nothing better than munching on a hot drumstick while driving home to finish up the rest. I definitely don&apos;t recommend going more than once every 2 months- unless of course, you have super hero metabolism.

Please note: I&apos;m only vouching for this location.

Is cheap and authentic southern fried chicken worth venturing into a rough part of Los Angeles and risking your life?  The answer after one trip to Louisiana Fried Chicken is a definitive: YES!

My Louisiana Fried Chicken adventure started before receiving the food, as my girlfriend and I noticed bullet holes in the car next to us as we pulled into our parking spot.  Later, while waiting in line, two men in front of us got into a huge shouting match over who should pay for the meal.  Profanities and threats of physical harm were hurled back and forth, but the funny part was that no other customers seemed to take notice.  So after sharing a cursory but concerned glance with my girlfriend, I acted casually too in hopes of blending in.

Upon ordering, we had to wait a nervous fifteen minutes for our food (a testament to the fact that it&apos;s made fresh and on the spot), but it was well worth the wait.

The chicken is downright orgasmic.  I&apos;m a fried chicken enthusiast myself, and with each bite, I could feel a tear of joy trickle down my cheek.  Popeye and the Colonel have flooded our poor country with atrocious fried chicken for long enough.  Never again!

Not wanting to miss out on anything, we tried all the possible sides which were perfect complements to the poultry - tasty but not overshadowing the main attraction.  My personal favorite was their chicken fried rice: Asian cuisine fused with a hint of soul.  Also worth noting was the fried catfish, jam-packed with rich Cajun flavor that came off a bit spicy, which was a pleasant surprise.

Rounding out the whole experience were the amazingly low prices, as we got a ton of food for a meager $12 (we&apos;re huge eaters).  Thus, I leave you with this advice.  Toss aside your apprehensions, ignore the sketchy surroundings, and make the trek down to Louisiana Fried Chicken.  Just get your food to go because you&apos;ll enjoy it much more in the safety of your own home.

the order.
20 pieces

the chicken here is great tasting and deceivingly healthy. the batter does not seem greasy at all. some pieces were juicier than others but the juicy ones were amazingly juicy- the juiciest i&apos;ve come across. the batter is more of a crunch than a crisp. which i think is kind of a hybrid between original and crunchy recipe (reference: KFC). all you need to know is that you end up devouring your chicken to bare bones. the spices remind me of jim dandy&apos;s but less poignant. this is most definitely a jewel in this neighborhood.
the buns were a less sweet version of hawaiian rolls. i was left wondering where the biscuits were.

Okay I&apos;ve had quite a lot of fried chicken and this place has got to be one of the top ones... I&apos;ve been FEEENIN for fried chicken for the longest time and finally got my fix. Mmmm boy was it GOOOOD!! The portions were filling, the chicken was not greasy, the seasoning was perfectly spicy and salty, and the meat was so tender and juicy on the inside with THICK pieces of meat... Mmm it was definitely quality fried chicken. The only thing is this place is located in... yep, the straightup HOOD. So don&apos;t be comin round in your Gucci and your Mercedes&apos; thinkin you the shit. Cause you&apos;ll probably get robbed. Or worst. Just sayin&apos;. Prices are more than reasonable... My meal cost about $5! Oh, and theres a man named Pookie who opens the door and I suggest you give him money in case somethin pops off... He&apos;ll have your back. Overall, definitely comin back to eat more chicken til my heart&apos;s content :)

I got to give it up to this place... they are way better than Roscoe&apos;s but the pieces of chicken are huge... it looks like they just ripped it off the chicken and deep fried it =)  Good place when you are craving chicken

Pros: Best chicken in L.A! The chicken is fried golden brown and seasoned properly. Chicken breast are moist and juicy. The food reminds you of that good &apos;ol home cookin&apos;. The sweet potatoe pie is good too. Manchester is the best location. Cons: Dinner rolls are hard, workers act irritated when you ask for napkins and condiments. The staff really makes you upset because you have to beg them for things that are usually complimentary at other places, such as sauces. (I am going to write corporate about this issue). Also, the people that come there are loud and pushy.
