Zaxby&apos;s Online Job Application
 
When you&apos;re looking for a fast food job, Zaxby&apos;s Online Job Application is a great place to start. If you enjoy working in the food industry, then why not consider a job 
or career with Zaxby&apos;s? Zaxby&apos;s is one of the fastest growing chains 
with nearly 500 locations in 12 southern states. This fast food 
restaurant specializes in chicken meals and side dishes with an added 
focus on customer satisfaction that keeps customers coming back for 
more. The great food and attention to good service helps ensure job 
security for employees at all levels.
 
Each Zaxby&apos;s store is independently owned and operated so the best way 
to find out about available openings is to go to your nearest store and 
ask. If you are seeking a job on the kitchen staff or counter then you 
may need to apply at each individual store in your area. You can locate 
Zaxby&apos;s locations by going to their official website and using the store
 locator.

Counter jobs and kitchen jobs are well suited for high 
school and college kids in need of part time money. They are also good 
for people needing extra income, or seniors who want to stay busy and 
make extra money. There are also several management positions available 
with Zaxby&apos;s at both the store level and in the corporate arena.

To
 get more information about the management positions, you can click on 
the link that says, &quot;Join Our Team&quot; at the top of their website. You&apos;ll 
find you can apply for corporate positions by sending your resume to the
 designated email address. If you are interested in store level 
management positions then you can use their online job locator and fill 
out an application online.

First you must select the store you 
are interested in working in and see what jobs are available. You may 
see an opportunity for an assistant manager, shift manager, general 
manager, or district manager. Choose the job you are qualified for and 
then proceed to register and fill in the online application.

You 
don&apos;t have to wonder if you are qualified to apply as the job duties and
 qualifications are clearly stated on the website. For example, to apply
 for a position as shift manager you should have a high school diploma, 
one year experience working in a restaurant, and three months working 
for Zaxby&apos;s. In addition you will need to pass skills tests to show your
 ability to work with office equipment and kitchen supplies.

Working
 conditions are pleasant in the fast food industry and Zaxby&apos;s in 
particular. Although some of the jobs require a lot of standing and some
 heavy lifting, overall the environment is appealing. Work load depends 
upon customer flow so boredom is kept to a minimum when compared to 
other jobs in the same pay scale.

Zaxby&apos;s is a great place to 
work but you must be a good match to get hired. They seek employees who 
put forth a cheerful and friendly attitude towards the customers and who
 are responsible at their jobs. If that sounds like you, then put your 
application on file so you can be considered when the next suitable job 
opening comes along.
