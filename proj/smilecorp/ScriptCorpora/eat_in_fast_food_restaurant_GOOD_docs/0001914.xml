&quot;The Advantage MotoBrake is sensational and has increased my enjoyment immensely. The downhill brake feature lets you walk down a steep slope without handling the buggy, and more importantly is great for the wonky knees. Very reliable and quiet and is the best electric buggy i have had&quot; ...... Alan Harris - The Coast GC NSW


 &quot;The new buggy is great.....the test was traversing down the steep 7th hole it performed precisely as you said, at the constant set speed.....extremely happy! thankyou for the information and your good advice on this excellent purchase&quot;  ....... Rob Rowley Bayview GC NSW 

 &quot;I bought my Ezicaddy four years ago. It was my first electric buggy and I did a lot of research to find the most reliable one as I had seen a lot of players having difficulties with breakdowns. The main feature for me was reliability and weight. I found that not only has my Ezicaddy been very reliable and it is very manageable for a small woman to lift into the car but it was also the cheapest! It was recommended to me by a woman golfer who plays very regularly and she shared hers with her husband so that the buggy was being used 7 days a week without any breakdowns. I have found that the service at Ezicaddy Battery Golf Buggies in Middle Cove, (in Sydney) is simply excellent as they do a instant repair on the spot which means that I do not have to be without my buggy or to have to return to collect it.&quot;

I originally selected the Ezicaddy Links because it folded easily and with a short enough wheelbase to fit into the small boot of my car. I&apos;ve now been using it about twice a week for near 5 trouble free years.

 Wow.  The improvement to my golf, my physical well being and my handicap has been incredible since I purchased the Ezicaddy Motobrake.  I only had the Motobrake for one month and took two strokes off my handicap (18 down to 16).  I no longer come off the course tired and exhausted after finishing a round of golf and my knees certainly appreciate the ‘cruise control’ effect that allows you to stay at the one set speed whilst going down steep slopes.  My concentration is much better, especially on our back 9 which is very hilly.  No more struggling up and down slopes, wasting energy on pushing and pulling.  Now it is just a casual stroll with the Motobrake doing all the work.   Thank you EziCaddy, you have put the enjoyment back into my game. 
 Cheers
