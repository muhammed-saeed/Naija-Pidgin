El Pollo Regio opens for business

By Amy Starnes


 El Pollo Regio , 2520 N. 18th St., is open for business. The Mexican fast-food restaurant dramatically transformed what was a run-down building in a neighborhood sorely needing some help.

The business opened on Father&apos;s Day. Its hours are 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily.

You can follow El Pollo Regio on Facebook or check out specials on the company&apos;s website .

Have you eaten here yet? What did you think?

Oh, boy. That blends in great with all the Mexican food trailers parked on all the other corners all the way down 18th street.

I ate lunch there on Saturday. I thought the food was great. I had the chicken which is their specialty. I couldn&apos;t eat it all. The beans are out of this world. Very clean and staff was very pleasant. I will definitely go back.

My parents are from Mexico and going to eat there brings back memories for them and for me. For the most part the food is very authentic and at a reasonable price. I highly recommend it for anyone and yes they do speak English there. Barbacoa tacos or the tostada siberia are two of my favorites.

This neighborhood does need some help; hopefully, this will spur some additional investment in the area. Sounds tasty!!
