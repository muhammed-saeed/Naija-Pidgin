Here are a few recipes to get you started and provide ideas for adapting some of your family&apos;s favorites.

 MAIN DISH 

 Turkey Meatloaf Muffins 

Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 15 minutes Cooking time: 30 minutes

 If your children like meatloaf, try this lighter version that uses lean ground turkey, instead of beef or pork, and walnuts, for heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. The muffin shapes make it easier to portion out servings.

1 1/4 pounds lean ground turkey

1 large egg, beaten

1 cup dried bread crumbs

1/2 cup walnuts, finely chopped

1/3 cup ketchup

3 tablespoons honey mustard

1/4 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup golden raisins, optional

1 large carrot, shredded, (about 1 cup), optional

1 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed, optional

1/4 cup preshredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Lightly oil or coat 12 muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.

Combine the turkey, egg, bread crumbs, walnuts, ketchup, honey mustard, salt and raisins, carrots or corn as desired in a large bowl and mix well.

Divide the turkey mixture evenly among the muffin cups and top each with a teaspoon of cheese. Bake until an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees, about 30 minutes.—From &quot;The Moms&apos; Guide to Meal Makeovers&quot; by Janice Newell Bissex and Liz Weiss (Broadway, $15.95)

 Per serving: 384 calories (35 percent from fat), 16 grams fat, 93 milligrams cholesterol, 37 grams carbohydrates, 29 grams protein, 620 milligrams sodium, 3 grams fiber.

 

 MAIN DISH 

 Southwestern Chicken and Rice 

Makes 6 servings

Preparation time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: 20 minutes

 Instead of cheese-smothered Tex-Mex casseroles that rely on salty packaged seasonings, try this lighter version made with spices and reduced-fat cheese and sour cream. Instant brown rice adds a bit more fiber than white rice—and slipped right past the kid testers&apos; &quot;new food&quot; radar.

1 tablespoon canola oil

1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut in bite-size pieces

2 cups frozen corn kernels, thawed

2 cups water

1 (15 1/2-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained

1 1/2 cups instant brown rice (about 3 cups cooked)

1 1/2 cups salsa

1 teaspoon chili powder

1 teaspoon ground cumin

1 cup preshredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese

1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream

Heat the oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.

Stir in the corn, 2 cups water, beans, rice, salsa, chili powder and cumin and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the cheese until melted.

Serve in individual bowls and top with sour cream.—From &quot;The Moms&apos; Guide to Meal Makeovers&quot; by Janice Newell Bissex and Liz Weiss (Broadway, $15.95)

 Per serving: 400 calories (17 percent from fat), 8 grams fat, 52 milligrams cholesterol, 51 grams carbohydrates, 32 grams protein, 701 milligrams sodium, 8 grams fiber.

 

 MAIN DISH 

 Salmon Burgers 

Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 8 minutes

 Try out this healthier burger on your family. This version is flecked with red bell pepper and lemon zest. For those who aren&apos;t crazy about canned salmon, try the pouch variety. Make whole-wheat bread crumbs by putting a slice of whole-wheat bread in a food processor and pulsing until soft crumbs form. Serve on whole-wheat buns.

2 (7.1-ounce) pouches or 1 (15-ounce) can salmon, drained

2 eggs, lightly beaten

1/2 cup finely chopped red or green bell pepper

1 cup fresh whole-wheat bread crumbs

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

1 teaspoon grated lemon zest

1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed

Pinch salt and pepper

2 teaspoons olive oil

Place salmon in a large bowl. With a fork, break up into small pieces. Add eggs and mix well to combine. Add bell pepper, bread crumbs, lemon juice and zest, rosemary, salt and pepper. Form into six patties, pressing well so they hold their shape.

In a nonstick skillet over medium heat, add the oil. Fry the patties for 4 minutes per side, or until lightly browned. Use a large spatula to turn, and don&apos;t move them around much; they are fragile.—Adapted from &quot;Fit Kids&quot; by Mary Gavin (Dorling Kindersley, $20)

 Per serving: 207 calories (37 percent from fat), 8 grams fat, 101 milligrams cholesterol, 14 grams carbohydrates, 19 grams protein, 581 milligrams sodium, 2 grams fiber.

 

 MAIN DISH 

 Squishy Squash Lasagna 

Makes 8 servings

Preparation time: 15 minutes

Cooking time: 60 minutes

 Forget the unfortunate name. This tasty vegetarian lasagna lowers the fat and calories of standard lasagna by using part-skim cheeses and eliminating high-fat meats like ground beef and sausage. For even more nutritional punch, sprinkle in a few roasted red peppers. Parents may find themselves fighting over who gets the leftovers for lunch.

1 (20-ounce) bag frozen butternut squash, thawed (see note)

1 (15-ounce) carton part-skim ricotta cheese

2 large eggs

1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

1 (26-ounce) jar pasta sauce

1 (9-ounce) box oven-ready, no-boil lasagna noodles

2 cups preshredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

Place the squash in a food processor and pulse until completely pureed. Add the ricotta cheese, eggs and Parmesan cheese and pulse a few turns until just combined.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

 To assemble the lasagna: Spread 1/2 cup pasta sauce in a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Place 4 noodles over the sauce, allowing them to overlap slightly. (Leave about 1/4 inch between the noodles and the edges of the pan; the lasagna will expand to the edges during cooking.)

Continue layering by placing a third of the ricotta mixture (about 1 1/2 cups), 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup pasta sauce over the first noodle layer. Repeat the next two layers with the noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella cheese and pasta sauce. End with 4 uncooked noodles, 1 cup pasta sauce and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.

Cover with aluminum foil and bake until the mixture bubbles, 50 to 60 minutes. Let stand about 10 minutes before cutting. Top with extra Parmesan cheese if desired.—From &quot;The Moms&apos; Guide to Meal Makeovers&quot; by Janice Newell Bissex and Liz Weiss (Broadway, $15.95)

 Note: You can substitute a 10- or 12-ounce box of frozen pureed winter squash, thawed, for the 20-ounce bag of frozen butternut squash. Use a food processor or simply combine the ingredients in a large bowl with a spoon or electric beater.

 Per serving: 337 calories (33 percent from fat), 12 grams fat, 82 milligrams cholesterol, 35 grams carbohydrates, 22 grams protein, 327 milligrams sodium, 2 grams fiber.

 

 MAIN DISH 

 Ham and Egg Pie 

Makes 6 servings

Preparation time: 20 minutes

Cooking time: 45-50 minutes

 This kid-friendly quiche features a winning ham-and-cheese combo. For extra-quick prep time, use a store-bought crust and deli sliced ham. Don&apos;t overfill the pie crust.

1 store-bought or homemade single pie crust

1 1/2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella or Swiss cheese

1/2 cup chopped cooked lower-sodium ham

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 1/2 cups low-fat milk

2 large eggs

2 egg whites

1/2 teaspoon dried basil

1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a 9-inch pie plate or quiche dish with pie crust and crimp edges. Line crust with foil and fill with dried beans. Bake for 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool crust on rack for 5 minutes. Carefully remove foil and beans.

Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine cheese, ham and flour. Spread in crust.

In the same bowl, whisk milk, eggs, egg whites, basil and pepper. Pour over mixture in crust. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the center is set. Check after 20 minutes; if crust is browning too quickly, cover with foil.

 Per serving: 296 calories (50 percent from fat), 16 grams fat, 86 milligrams cholesterol, 20 grams carbohydrates, 17 grams protein, 443 milligrams sodium, 1 gram fiber.

 

 SIDE DISH 

 Maple-Glazed Carrots 

Makes 4 servings

Preparation time: 5 minutes

Cooking time: 9-11 minutes

 Apple juice and maple syrup, not lots of butter, add flavor to these sautéed carrots.

2 generous cups carrot sticks or mini carrots (about 10 ounces)

2/3 cup apple juice

1/4 teaspoon salt

1 to 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup

1 teaspoon butter

In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, add the carrots, apple juice and salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the carrots are tender, 8 to 10 minutes (add additional juice or water if all the liquid evaporates).

Stir in the maple syrup and butter and continue to cook until the butter melts.—Adapted from &quot;The Moms&apos; Guide to Meal Makeovers&quot; by Janice Newell Bissex and Liz Weiss (Broadway, $15.95)

 Per serving: 73 calories (14 percent from fat), 1 gram fat, 3 milligrams cholesterol, 15 grams carbohydrates, 1 gram protein, 167 milligrams sodium, 2 grams fiber.

 

 MAIN DISH 

 Vegetarian Chili 

Makes 8 servings

Preparation time: 15 minutes

Cooking time: 30 minutes

 This makes a mild, thick stew. If your kids are not confirmed bean lovers, add only one can. To speed prep time, chop veggies in a food processor, using the pulse button. Top with shredded cheddar cheese if desired.

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 onion, chopped

2 cloves garlic, minced

1/2 cup carrots, chopped

1/2 cup celery, chopped

1/2 cup red bell pepper, chopped

1 teaspoon ground cumin

1 teaspoon chili powder

Hot pepper sauce or red pepper flakes (optional)

1 (28-ounce) can crushed or diced tomatoes

2 (14-ounce) cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained

1 cup frozen or canned corn kernels

Salt and pepper

In a large pot over medium heat, add oil. Add the onion and garlic and sautéfor 2 minutes. Add the carrot, celery and red pepper and cook until just tender, stirring occasionally.

Stir in the cumin, chili powder and hot pepper sauce to taste. Add the tomatoes with their juice and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Add the beans and corn. Simmer for 10 minutes, or until heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper.—Adapted from &quot;Fit Kids&quot; by Mary Gavin (Dorling Kindersley, $20)

 Per serving: 173 calories (21 percent from fat), 4 grams fat, no cholesterol, 29 grams carbohydrates, 7 grams protein, 568 milligrams sodium, 8 grams fiber.

 

 MAIN DISH 

 Oven-Fried Cod 

Makes 6 servings

Preparation time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: 10-12 minutes

 This healthier baked version of fried fish will appeal to adults and kids. Cornflakes give it a bit of crunch. Line the baking tray with foil for easier cleanup.

Nonstick cooking spray

2 tablespoons reduced-fat mayonnaise

2 tablespoons fat-free honey-mustard dressing

1 teaspoon lemon juice

2/3 cup dried bread crumbs

1/3 cup finely crushed cornflakes

6 cod fillets (about 1/4 to 1/3 pound each)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray. On a plate, combine mayonnaise, dressing and lemon juice. On a separate plate, combine bread crumbs and cornflakes.

Dredge cod fillets in wet ingredients, then in dry ingredients, coating completely with each dredge. Place on baking sheet and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until cooked through.—Adapted from &quot;Working Mom&apos;s Fast&amp;Easy Family Cookbook&quot; by Elise Griffith and Jeanne Besser (Gramercy, $14.95)

 Per serving: 180 calories (14 percent from fat), 3 grams fat, 50 milligrams cholesterol, 15 grams carbohydrates, 22 grams protein, 270 milligrams sodium, trace fiber.
