&quot;Our grandson sometimes gets a 
 horrible croupy cough, so we decided to try C.C.-W on him with wonderful 
 results. It stopped the cough almost immediately. Thank the Lord for the 
 gift of herbs and for knowledgeable people who know how to put the 
 combinations together. We also helped our grandson when he got a kidney 
 infection and was in pain. awful We gave him Cornsilk, Marshmallow and 
 Echinacea. Within three hours he was able to urinate totally pain free. I 
 couldn&quot;t believe how fast he improved! Herbs really do work! They&quot;re God&quot;s 
 medicine and who can make things better than our Creator? 

I also had a lady with cysts on her ovaries and she was in great pain. We 
 used CST-M, He Shou Wu, Bee Pollen and friendly bacteria on her. We were 
 amazed at how quick the results were! By the next day she had greatly 
 improved and by the second or third day she was almost totally pain free. 
 Needless to say, she&quot;s a happy client.&quot;

&quot;My neck had been sore when I 
 turned it from side to side for over a year. I take a lot of supplements 
 and herbs, but it would not get any better (no worse, but no better). Then 
 I heard about the desert herb SUTHERLANDIA that fights viruses and 
 their torments, even AIDS where the body is attacking itself. Each 
 morning, I applied Sutherlandia externally from each ear out to each 
 shoulder and then on the back of the neck and down the spine a little. I 
 then took 20 drops by mouth and gradually worked up to 40 drops per day 
 over the period of a month. After a month I am a good 80% to 90% better! I 
 am impresssed. Thank you Pure Herbs and thank you Sutherlandia!&quot;

--E. C. W., Detroit, MI

&quot;I have had very good results 
 with Sutherlandia. I believe it has definitely helped with my menopausal 
 symptoms. It has made me more energetic, given me more stamina and made me 
 less stressed. I have been under a great deal of stress and people wonder 
 how I keep on my feet. I know the Sutherlandia is a big part of it. Also, 
 for a long time I have had kinky&quot;knees (the only way I know how to 
 describe them) and they are completely better. No problem at all now. 
 Also, my teeth had become very sensitive to hot and cold and I had tried 
 taking extra minerals, etc. and I still had the problem, but then I 
 started taking the Sutherlandia and my teeth were no longer sensitive. In 
 addition to all of the above, my massage therapist was always commenting 
 on my swollen&quot;ankles. Well, guess what??? No more. They are fine now. My 
 massage therapist says, it must be the Sutherlandia that you are taking.&quot;She must be right because that is the only new product I am taking. The 
 only thing I found with the Sutherlandia is that if I take it too late in 
 the day it tends to keep me awake at night. I was giving it to my son, 
 Burt, at bedtime too and it doesn&quot;t seem to bother him though. It really 
 is helping Burt to be calmer and less anxious. One more thing is that I 
 mix the Sutherlandia in a half and half mixture with Five Good.&quot;

--Cheryl Lawson, Derby VT

&quot;I just praise and thank God 
 for these wonderful Pure Herbs that you have discovered for our good 
 health. I thank you very much for your love and kind consideration. My 
 family and some of my friends are very satisfied with your great products 
 and your God given knowledge.&quot;

--Fernando Mariano, Kekaha 
 Kauai, HI

&quot;I recently starting using a 
 very special herb and have experienced very positive results. I believe 
 this herb, Borage, needs to be re-introduced to all. Actually, I was 
 reading through the 2003 Pure Herbs calendar description of herbs and I 
 felt a divine pull towards the description of Borage. It brings joy to 
 the mind and purging sadness and melancholy from the heart.&quot;The past year 
 had some very negative moments so I thought I would give Borage a try. I 
 knew it would step in and uplift and it certainly did. I take 20 drops 
 3x/day. Thanks again Pure Herbs.&quot;

--Sheila Kaplowitz, Hendersonville, 
 NC

&quot;I have been a distributor and 
 user of Pure Herbs for many years.with this I have become a resource also 
 for my family assisting them with herbal remedies as needed. They have 
 learned to trust the herbs more than medications after seeing results and 
 as a mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother it is an honor to see them 
 using and respecting herbal programs above other treatments. Most 
 recently, we have experienced what we call a miracle. My 14 year old 
 grand-daughter has had severe problems since she started her periods 
 several years ago. Every month she has experienced pain so severe it 
 required a trip to the emergency room for pain medication strong enough to 
 help it subside. The pain was also accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea 
 and then a ten day period with continued cramping and heavy flow. As a 
 teenager she was not open to taking the herbs and it resulted in many 
 trips to specialist who diagnosed endometriosis and also found a cyst on 
 her ovary. Their treatment was to take, what we saw, as very dangerous 
 medication (because of side effects) and eventually surgery. She is very 
 tiny and weights less than 100 pounds and she dreaded each month and could 
 not plan activities around that time because of this situation. I was able 
 to convince her to at least try the herbs and had her take 10 drops of 
 each of Wild Yam and F.P.-W three times each day (she then increased it to 
 20 drops). After taking the herbs for only a short time, she called me one 
 morning and was crying (with joy) because she had started her period and 
 not even realized it. She had no pain, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no heavy 
 flow and was able to go to the beach party they had planned that day. Her 
 period lasted only four days and was very mild. Not only did the herbs do 
 the job, but in such a short time. She is now able to lead a normal life 
 and has cancelled her appointments for surgery and further medical 
 treatment. God had the answer in His creation of herbs from the 
 beginning..lest we take His Wisdom and Knowledge and use it.&quot;

&quot;Ive been a runner most of my 
 life and can&quot;t ever remember not finishing a run until one day last year. 
 I found myself slowing to a walk and then sitting on the ground roadside 
 knowing that what I was feeling was very wrong and that it was too far to 
 crawl home. Allow yourself to believe that you can figure it out.&quot;Thank 
 you, Dr. Watkins for that repeated admonishment. So many times over the 
 years it has cleared my mind when asked to help someone else faced with 
 pretty intimidating conditions. Now it was my turn. How I determined it 
 was a high mercury saturation level shutting me down is detail the need 
 for brevity here won&quot;t allow. Shortly after my little no option roadside 
 rest, I had all the mercury amalgams (tooth fillings) replaced with body 
 friendly composites and began an herbal regimen to assist my body to rid 
 itself of the poison. I believe my experience yesterday is an indication 
 that the herbal agenda was successful. I finished a four-mile run on an 
 August afternoon with a heat index of 110 degrees in Houston, Texas 
 feeling like I could run a couple more miles, but had other things on my 
 schedule. 

This is one detox agenda that might be considered following mercury 
 amalgam removal. As the iris indicates and kinesiology (muscle testing) 
 confirms, we are uniquely made. We each have our own genetic strengths and 
 weaknesses. Given this fact, it follows that my body may require support 
 in areas of weakness to fulfill this cleanse that yours does not. 
 Therefore you may require different nutrients or herbal sources.

Our first step should always be to eliminate those foods and beverages 
 that aren&quot;t contributing to health. To free up body energy to deal with 
 antigens (undesirable elements) it seems only logical that we would not 
 want to add to its workload, slow down the cleansing process and distress 
 it further by continuing to eat and drink or otherwise expose it to other 
 sources of poison. If you enjoy using the expression, Hey, we gotta live 
 in the real world&quot;to justify your food and drink, please know that the 
 world&apos;s diseases may also be yours to enjoy sooner and in a greater 
 measure. Immediately after the dental procedure I applied Arnica to my 
 face and upper and lower jaw hourly for the first day. I took 5 drops of 
 Arnica 4x a day for the shock to my entire system for about 7 days. I 
 drank about 2 quarts of cilantro green drink daily for about 2 months. I 
 applied Indian Tobacco and L.C.-W under the jaw and neck to encourage the 
 lymph&apos;s to release poisons. I applied Vitamin E, Oil of Cajeput, Arnica 
 and Scullcap to my gums to soothe the violated nerves. Because of their 
 analgesic properties, I was also relieved of the need for a pharmaceutical 
 pain killer as such deep and extensive dental work may require. 

When cleansing, it is imperative that the plumbing&quot;or the way out be 
 open. I used 80 drops each of C.C.E.-W and L.B.R.-W in the AM and PM. If 
 your diet lacks vegetable and whole grain fiber, add Psyllium to your 
 regimen to bind and help transport poisons out of the body. Some people 
 would benefit from a series of colonics (colon irrigation).  

On the cellular level, we know the body uses minerals to clean itself. I 
 used Research Formula 80 drops 4x/day. A.C.S. and T-W are other wonderful 
 sources. The sea vegetables have a capability to bind inorganic mineral 
 and radiation. In our EMF (Electro magnetic fields) polluted environment 
 they are truly our friends. On such an intense cleansing regimen, one 
 might consider the use of Black Cohosh, Plantain and Virginia Snake Root 
 as poison antidotes. I used 80 drops of each 4x/day for the first week and 
 then 3x/day thereafter. 

I used 80 drops of Formula Three and True American Ginseng each 3x/day for 
 adaptogenic support for my body&quot;s overall distress. It takes energy to 
 cleanse. Also, 80 drops a day of Sarsaparilla for its lymphatic support 
 and affinity to pull heavy metals. They&quot;ll put a smile on your face! I 
 knew it was working because my friends kept asking me what I was grinning 
 about. They said, What has gotten into you?&quot;to which I replied, I 
 believe it&quot;s what&quot;s getting out.&quot;I took 80 drops of Ginkgo and Gota Kola 
 each 3x/day for their brain enhancing, heavy metal pulling properties. I 
 believe they helped to remove mercury&quot;s finger from the delete button&quot;of 
 my short-term memory banks. And don&quot;t be surprised to be remembering 
 things you&quot;d rather forget. Take this cleansing opportunity to let the old 
 morbid, mental material go as well. 

Cranesbill, Inkberry, Horsetail and Oatstraw are known for their ability 
 to pull mercury. I took 40 drops of Cranesbill and 20 drops of Inkberry 
 3x/day. I also took 80 drops of Horsetail and Oatstraw 3x/day.

Don&quot;t forget the antioxidant properties and overall support for healing of 
 Vitamins: A, C, and E with Selenium. Pure Herbs, Ltd has excellent sources 
 of all of these nutrients. I took 80 drops of Wild Rose Hips 3x/day. 
 Bilberry and Chippewa Pine are also excellent sources of natural Vitamin C 
 with its full spectrum of bioflavanoids. I took 800 to 1200 units of 
 Vitamin E and 50,000 to 100,000 units of A and 2,000 to 4,000 units of 
 Vitamin D daily (Pure Herbs vitamins from fish oil).

My kidneys and bladder let me know they did not appreciate the mercury now 
 being eliminated through their channels. Cornsilk Comb and Buchu gave me 
 immediate relief. I took 80 drops of each and repeated the doses an hour 
 later. The discomfort passed. Our lymph&apos;s tend to act as a 
 repository when the body is on poison overload. My lymph&apos;s are especially 
 sluggish. I encouraged them to release by using 20 drops 3x/day of Red 
 Root and 60 drops 3x/day of Goldenseal&amp;Echinacea.  

Bad guys are opportunistic. They will gravitate toward a location of least 
 resistance, move in, shut the place down and take over. This must be a 
 principle of life, because it is also true within the body. For instance, 
 my heart, liver, pancreas, lungs an are working well and didn&quot;t need 
 assistance through this detox, but as my neurogenic eye signs indicate, 
 the (CNS) Central Nervous System (brain&amp;spinal cord) is not my strongest 
 component. It sustained the greatest injury from the mercury. For (CNS) 
 repair and comfort I took 80 drops each of Scullcap and Lady&quot;s Slipper 
 3x/day. I also took 5 to 10 drops of Indian Tobacco 3x/day. Thanks to a 
 compassionate Creator all of life is cyclic and so is cleansing. My energy 
 level and clarity of mind have been sustained over this past year and I&quot;ve 
 had some rough days as well. Recognizing the&quot;not so good&quot;days as being 
 more cleansing,&quot;I am welcoming the elimination of yet another pocket or 
 layer of mercury. The amalgams were put in between the ages of 10 and 15 
 years old. The big 60&quot;is not far off. Those were whole decades to absorb 
 and store a known poison. 

Any thoughts of the expense or inconvenience of such an intense regimen 
 were quickly dispelled as I contemplated, inconvenient as compared to 
 what? Sitting alongside the road and trying to remember my name?&quot;

I maintained this intense regimen for about 2 months and then began 
 tapering off until now I am doing a very low maintenance program of about 
 half the drops only 1 or 2x daily and alternating some of the herbs. On 
 the not so good&quot;days I return to the original program.

Thank you, Pure Herbs, Ltd. for making available to our nation herbal 
 sources with all the true virtue of some of God&quot;s best foods at a time on 
 this planet when we need their help as never before.&quot;

&quot;My husband has osteoarthritis 
 in his hands. He has tried several different natural remedies with no 
 relief. Finally, he tried L.P.-W (Liquid Pearle). On the second day 
 he remarked that his hands no longer ached. He continues to take Liquid 
 Pearle and is pain free. He takes one half dropper full three times a 
 day.&quot; 

--Barbara Burr, Derby, VT 

&quot;Our beloved 11 1/2 year old 
 dog Barney was diagnosed with Canine Anemia/Auto-immune Disease (his white 
 blood cells were attacking and destroying his red ones). The Veterinarian 
 put him on Prednisone and antibiotics with little encouragement for his 
 recovery. When I asked Dr. Watkins if he had any suggestions, he 
 immediately said Sutherlandia, Greasewood, Protein, HI.I.-W and A.C.S. He 
 also said Vitamin E would oxygenate the bloodstream and assist the herbs. 
 He said to apply them to the pads of his feet. We were surprised at how 
 absorbent the pads were. They soaked up the herbs like sponges. The 
 improvement was quickly noticed by everyone. The Vet said it was amazing&quot;how well he was responding to their treatments (we hadn&quot;t told them about 
 the herbs). In our last contact with them, they said they could not get 
 over how well our Barney had gotten. They said that by all accounts Barney 
 should no longer be with us. Thank you Pure Herbs and Dr. Watkins. We now 
 have Barney on A.M.F.-W (Animal Maintenance Formula) which we plan to 
 continue as long as he is with us.&quot; 

-- A friend 

&quot;I am a Nutritional Counselor 
 and Therapist. This is my husbands success story: In Florida we have 
 several different kinds of parasites. My husbands back was attacked by 
 parasites and was all puffed up like a growth or something. It got fatter 
 and fatter! We had it evaluated by a professional and they said it was 
 parasites. For three months we tried herbs and other remedies with no 
 success. Orinoco Extract did help with the pain. This growth was three 
 inches in diameter and was located on his spine. It was the size of a 
 goose egg and very painful! I put two drops of Sutherlandia straight onto 
 the growth and lightly spread it around until it was absorbed into the 
 skin. I repeated this procedure two-three times per day. The growth began 
 to shrink and the pain began to decrease. During the next three weeks it 
 just kind of went away. There was a minor recess and the skin looked 
 stained, but it is continuing to heal very nicely and has a healthy color 
 as it is healing! It also healed my intestinal infection! Thank you Pat 
 Courter for sharing Sutherlandia with me and Pure Herbs for making this 
 wonderful product available to us.&quot;

--Lynn, Ft. Myers 

&quot;I have had hot flashes and 
 night sweats for several years. I did not want to use estrogen, due to the 
 side effects it can cause. A friend introduced me to the Pure Herbs 
 product, MP.E.-P and to my surprise it worked instantly. Whenever I feel a 
 hot flash coming on, and those of who have them know they sometimes can 
 come with little or no warning, I simply take the recommended dosage and 
 instantly my flashes disappear. MP.E.-P is truly a God sent herbal 
 solution. I sincerely recommend it to anyone who suffers from hot flashes 
 and night sweats. Thank you, thank you, thank you Pure Herbs for your 
 products!&quot;

&quot;When I was 70 years old, 
 approximately two years ago, on February 20th I was riding my bike when a 
 taxi hit me. I was knocked to the pavement and ended up with ten broken 
 bones. The doctor that saw me from emergency was great. He let me continue 
 my herb nutrient program in the hospital. Used Ol&quot;Number 11 after every 
 meal, one dropper full. I also rubbed Arnica and Big Five on my broken 
 ribs and broken collar bone and my bruised ankle. I also used both of 
 these on my broken knee cap until it was in a permanent cast and then I 
 couldn&quot;t reach it. At night I took one dropper full of Willow. My cast was 
 removed on April 18th and I continued using my herbs. By the middle of 
 May, after receiving physical therapy and learning how to walk again, I 
 was able to go back to my Librian job. On June 14 I was able to ride my 
 bike again. I still continue to take Ol&quot;Number 11 for arthritis which has 
 eased up quite a bit since taking this product. My doctor said that for 
 all I&quot;ve been through I have made a remarkable recovery. I&quot;m glad he is 
 not opposed to me using my herbal supplements. I am grateful for my Pure 
 Herbs products and your company! Keep helping people in this prescription 
 crazy world.&quot; 

--Sister Mary Steinkamp, SNJM, 
 Portland, OR 

&quot;I helped a lady who had been 
 blind for about ten years. She couldn&quot;t even see light. The first time I 
 saw her was right after Thanksgiving; after her second visit, just prior 
 to Christmas, she phoned me crying. She said she had been sitting at her 
 kitchen table LOOKING at her wedding rings and her Christmas tree, etc. I 
 had her taking Stone Root, I.S.-F, minerals and Chromium. She is also 
 beginning to see colors!&quot;

  I 
 would also like to share a testimony about my daughter-in-law. She had 
 open heart surgery before we met her, over 20 years ago. She made annual 
 trips to Bethesda, MD to N.I.H. (National Institute of Health). On May 6, 
 1997, she died on her way to the hospital; she straight-lined between 1 or 
 1 1/2 minutes in the ambulance. She recovered before they used the 
 paddles. My son took her to N.I.H. after her second stay in the local 
 hospital. N.I.H. said she had about three weeks to live without surgery, 
 which she refused. At her request, we started mostly with Pure 
 Herbs HI.I.-W, H.I.K.-W, Bugleweed, Bladderwrack, tons of Arnica, Herbal 
 Adjustment and F&amp;F. Her Aorta Valve tested 46% functional, now = 100%, 
 the mitral valve =82% now 100%, she is maintaining good potassium, sodium 
 and iron levels. They told her she could never lose weight and she lost 
 70lbs. There are a few things from other companies that were used, but 
 mostly we used Pure Herbs. She has made medical history. Praise the Lord, 
 His Products and the dedicated people like you for producing them!&quot;

--Edna Ford, Connersville, IN

&quot;Dear friends at Pure Herbs, my husband and I have been 
 married for 12 years. We decided to try and have a baby, but could not 
 conceive. We went to see Reuben Schwartz and he thought I might have 
 Endometriosis and said I might try Red Clover Blended. He suggested I take 
 three bottles of the Red Clover Blended. This was August 17, 2001. I took 
 the three bottles of Red Clover Blended and made a visit to my medical 
 doctor and she couldn&quot;t find any Endometriosis at all. I called my medical 
 doctor one week later and she said to take a home pregnancy test. I did 
 and it was positive (December 12, 2001). I cried because on this same day 
 I received a paper saying that my husband had problems too and that we 
 would probably not be able to conceive. I thank God, Reuben and Red Clover 
 Blended for giving me my little miracle. Our miracle was born July 31, 
 2002, a boy. We named him Lukas. Reuben said he should have been named Red 
 Clover (ha ha). We went to see Reuben again on August 5, 2003 and he said 
 Lukas was perfect! Thank you so much, what a blessing he is!&quot;--Linda 
 Douglas, Scottsville, KY

&quot;Hurray for Sutherlandia! My whole family will not be 
 without this herb. One Big Caution with this herb, a little is more! We 
 have been using the Sutherlandia for about eight months now. I began with 
 eight to ten drops two times per day, because of the potency of 
 Sutherlandia. Wow! I began to have some awful looking bowel movements of 
 all kinds; along with all kinds of strange looking debris that was passed. 
 In the first few weeks, liquid would be mixed with solids. It is important 
 to drink plenty of water, especially while taking the Sutherlandia! The 
 water seems to be needed to help liquefy the fecal matter, and makes 
 things move easier! Be near a bathroom until you know what to expect! When 
 I had to go, I had about a two minute warning to get there and it was over 
 fairly quick! In about two months, my stomach had flattened to where it 
 was hard for me to see it unless I bent over. You know now what I was full 
 of? Shh.quiet don&quot;t say it!!! Whew! I&quot;m sure glad it is gone! If it 
 starts to come back I know what to do about it. It is extremely important 
 to get enough of an easily digestible form of protein. I craved pinto 
 beans and corn big time for the first six months of taking the 
 Sutherlandia and I feel better when I eat them often. At month three, I 
 increased to 18-20 drops twice a day. At month eight I began taking ten 
 drops each morning and five drops in the early afternoon, because 
 Sutherlandia seems to act as a stimulant with me! I was having three-five 
 bowel movements a day and I started having leg cramps. I took 80 drops of 
 HI.K-W and 80 drops of CA.-W and that seemed to solve the problem! Getting 
 rid of the poisons and accumulated waste (waist) caused me to feel better 
 all over! It was like a burden rolling off my shoulders. If you are 
 comfortable with yourself your immune system is stronger! When one of us 
 feels sickly or has a sore throat, we use a few more drops of Sutherlandia. 
 For extra support we also take 80 drops of both TL.-C and E.T.I.-W! 
 Sutherlandia has carried us over many health obstacles with flying colors! 
 Words just cannot express our joy and excitement over Sutherlandia!&quot;--The 
 Courters, Valley View, TX

&quot;I was introduced to Pure Herbs in March of 2003, by 
 Brenda Guerra from McAllen, TX. I had contracted a very painful urinary 
 tract infection and after four weeks and two full prescription of strong 
 antibiotics, I was still suffering. Brenda, a long time friend, 
 immediately took me to her mentor and herbalist, Bella Vladimirsky. Bella 
 suggested I take Cornsilk and Cranberry tablets. Within two days I felt 
 better and by the end of the week I was healed. Bella&quot;s knowledge of the 
 herbs healing properties was inspiring. I was also amazed at how quickly I 
 felt better. I am now a believer in the herbs. Thank you for these 
 wonderful all natural herbal products.&quot;--Velma Gonzales, Saint Ann, MO

&quot;Since taking your wonderful products, I have been very 
 satisfied. The only little drawback is when trying to swallow some of the 
 liquid combinations, particularly one called W.L.S. (weight control) which 
 contains a good amount of capsicum which severely burned my tongue on the 
 way down!! I remembered a trick thought up a couple of years ago that had 
 been forgotten and since I believe in the liquid extracts, it has come in 
 very handy. I take an empty gelatin capsule, which can be purchased from 
 most health food stores or pharmacies in packages of 100-1,000 (an 00 is 
 good for one dropperful). I fill it up and have numerous seconds to 
 swallow with water before it collapses. In fact, the minute it hits the 
 stomach I&quot;m aware it has landed safely! This idea has made a tremendous 
 impact in being able to take almost any objectable tasting combination. I 
 wanted to share it with other readers and hope they can benefit as has 
 been my experience.&quot;--Shila Van Wagenen, Penn Valley, CA
 
&quot;I&quot;ve suffered with Endometriosis since I was sixteen 
 and I am now thirty something. Back in 1991, my doctor told me I would 
 have to have a surgical procedure to remove the damaged tissue. So I did. 
 After the surgery I found out that the surgeons removed what they could, 
 but on my left side they were unable to remove the damaged tissue which 
 was wrapped around my bowel, fallopian tube, and ovary. They said this 
 would require about ten hours of surgery. I decided to look into other 
 options. I decided to wait on more surgery since one month after the 
 original surgery the junk that was removed was back. The doctors put me on 
 hormone replacement for about 6 months which I was told might help, but 
 no guarantees&quot;. Of course, this hormone replacement just made me a crazy 
 women with hot flashes and did nothing to help with the Endometriosis. My 
 doctor then decided to put me on a continuous cycle of birth control so I 
 could decide when I wanted to suffer with the relentless pain. He 
 recommended I only have a period two times per year. So up until February 
 of 2003, this is what I did. I still did have pain during my cycles, but 
 it was only really bad pain for a day or two. I finally grew tired and 
 worried about being on the birth control for so many years, especially 
 since it was not completely helping me with the unbearable cramping. So I 
 went off of it. Since I do the Newsletters here at Pure Herbs, Ltd. and 
 see all of the testimonials that come, in I knew we had about four 
 testimonials on Red Clover Blended helping women in the same situation as 
 me. I had tried it years ago, but not faithfully or for long enough. I 
 decided to really give it a go! By May 2003, I had NO UNBEARABLE CRAMPS 
 for the first time since I was 16, over half of my lifetime. I couldn&quot;t 
 believe it, but told all of my friends, co-workers and family members. Dr. 
 Watkins, of course wanted me to print my testimonial in our Newsletter. I 
 said I would after waiting one more month to be sure this was for real. 
 Well, as you can read from my testimonial, it worked. Two beautiful months 
 in a row of no cramps and looking forward to a life without those awful 
 days! I am truly grateful to Reuben Schwartz for all of the testimonials 
 his clients sent in which he had helped them with their Endometrioses. I 
 am also grateful to Dr. Watkins and Pure Herbs, Ltd. for without this job 
 I may never have known about Red Clover Blended and might have had more 
 surgeries than I want to think about. Since February 2003, I have also 
 taken Can-Sol capsules (one-two/day) Oregon Grape (one dropper full daily) 
 and 1 cup, about 6 oz., green drink* in addition to the Red Clover 
 Blended. These seem to be helping with my Fibromyalgia and I&quot;m sure my 
 Endometriosis too! So if the Red Clover Blended alone doesn&quot;t work for you 
 add these other products. I hope every women out there with Endometriosis 
 will try this and not have to suffer any longer!&quot;--Kim Clark, Sterling

 edible green leaves (such as Romaine lettuce) in a pint of reliable spring 
 water or distilled water. Blend for about one minute. Filter through a 
 paper coffee filter and drink up. This is fresh live&quot;chlorophyll or 
 plant blood&quot;. It cleans your blood and gives you plenty of energy.&quot;--Dr. 
 Eugene C. Watkins

&quot;My husband and I have been using the Sports Cream Plus 
 for our aches and pains following mowing our lawn. We also use the Cream 
 to repel mosquitoes, sand fleas, flies, brown and black ants and other 
 bugs. We have an 85 pound Doberman Pincher who hangs around while we mow 
 our lawn. We apply the Sports Cream on her to repel the bugs off of her. 
 She doesn&quot;t seem to mind. The cream even takes away the stinging, itchy 
 feeling of the bug bite. Thank you Pure Herbs!&quot;--Sue&amp;Terry Schafsnitz, 
 Bay City, MI

&quot;Dear friends at Pure Herbs, this past winter I 
 introduced my friend Carole Ann to UR.-W. She had been experiencing 
 frequent urination for many months with slight incontinence (four to five 
 trips to the bathroom during the night, with urgency). After only one 
 month of using UR.-W and drinking six to eight glasses of water and a 
 wholesome nutritional program, she is seeing great improvement. She sleeps 
 through the night and when she is out somewhere she doesn&quot;t have to seek 
 out the nearest restroom in a hurry. What a blessing!&quot;--Sheila Kaplowitz, 
 Hendersonville, NC

&quot;I am 60 years old. I would like to share with you my 
 testimony on my life living with pancreatic and liver cancer and diabetes. 
 In 1990, I had just purchased a small country store and shortly after 
 found out I had pancreatic and liver cancer. The doctors operated on me 
 and sewed me up to die, said I had six months or less. I was very 
 depressed and very scared. My daughter in Indiana told me of a Baptist 
 minister who knew a lot about herbs. I went to see him because I had 
 nothing to lose. His name is Frank Miesse from Springfield-Xenia, OH. He 
 knew I was in bad shape. He put me on a cleansing program using many 
 different herbs. I didn&quot;t even have room for food. I made all of my juices 
 from fresh fruit and vegetables. There were times when I felt so sick I 
 thought I would die any day, but I kept up on all the treatment he put me 
 on. After about six months, Frank told me about a man in Casper WY, Ralph 
 Schaus that had a good cancer herb that is like an herbal chemo. I started 
 on that and other herbs and I started improving. It was a slow go, but I&quot;m 
 so thankful, because it has been 12 years and I&quot;m still living and in fair 
 health. My regular medical doctors said it was a bunch of hog wash 
 (herbs), but could not believe it after I passed my six month mark. They 
 said, we may not believe in it, but go ahead with it, because you are 
 improving and we offered you no hope.&quot;I made many trips to Ohio to see 
 Mr. Frank Miesse. He is so happy with my results. He told me of an 
 herbalist that he trained in Tomkinsville, KY (Reuben Schwartz). I went to 
 see him and he had already heard from Frank about my life. I told him 
 about the problems I was having with my thyroid, colon, digest system, 
 kidneys and about my heart blockage. I also told him about other problems 
 I was having. He suggested T.-W 1 tsp. 4x/day, Mega-Chel (Nature&apos;s 
 Sunshine) to clean my arteries, Herbal Adjustment (mineral maintenance) 
 for my arteries, Slippery Elm, Psyllium (bowel softener and lubricant), L-Salivarius 
 for digestion (3 caps 3x/day), Maximizer for digestion (3 caps 3x/day), 
 S.D.-R (stone dissolver), U.R.-W (urinary tract), B.B.-W (Brain and 
 Balance), Vitamin E (immune system builder), H.T. Comb. (heart), body 
 balance (Fibromyalgia), E-Tea (breast), Formula Three (1 tsp. 3x/day), 
 N.-W (Pituitary gland), 5 HTP (Pituitary gland), Gotu Kola (Pituitary 
 gland) and Wood Betony and Eyebright (for loss of eyesight in left eye). I 
 have told so many people about these herbs. I personally know six people 
 who have beat cancer with herbal treatment and faith. I wish everyone 
 would try the natural herbs that God gave us to use. If only they knew the 
 damage that man-made&quot;medicines or drugs do to their body. God bless and 
 thanks for the PURE Herbs, because I know many are not pure!&quot;--Jane 
 Fishback, Edmonton, KY

&quot;I am a 75 year old man who had colon cancer in 1994. 
 The doctors operated and said they got all of it. I also had chemotherapy. 
 I have chronic emphysema (COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and 
 an enlarged heart. I&quot;ve been on inhalers for about 20 years. I made a bad 
 choice; I smoked for 60 years. I also worked at Johnson Motors and Die 
 Cast Metals for 30 years. I was exposed to various chemicals. I have taken 
 Puritan&quot;s Pride vitamins for ten years. My friend Jane Fishback told me 
 all about herbs. So when my lung specialist and other medical doctors told 
 me there wasn&quot;t anything else they could do for me, I decided to give 
 herbal treatment a try. I went to see Reuben Schwartz and he told me I 
 probably wouldn&quot;t live long if I didn&quot;t get help right away. He suggested 
 L.-W, A.E.A.-B, and Vitamin O for my lungs, Maximizer for digestion (3 
 capsules 3x/day), COQ-10 and Blessed Thistle for oxygen, Herbal Adjustment 
 mineral maintenance for my arteries and Mege-Chel to clean my arteries, 
 H.T. Comb. for my heart and Chromium for my pancreas. To my surprise, 
 after taking these supplements for only one month I felt somewhat better. 
 After two months I was much more improved and my oxygen level was coming 
 up. After taking the Herbal Adjustment and A.E.A.-B I can breath better. 
 I&quot;m so thankful for the herbal treatment. I am very pleased with my 
 results and hope to continue getting well. I&quot;ve recommended this herbal 
 program to others. Thank you so much.&quot;--Harold Hensley, Edmonton, KY

&quot;VANITY RULES! Just one 4 oz. Bottle of R.S.T.-C taken 
 orally and applied externally to my face twice daily in the a.m and p.m. and I am no longer considering facial surgery. I am 63 years young. 
 My skin had large pores and make-up would leak like blackheads. It made my 
 wrinkles look awful. After just one bottle of the R.S.T.-C I noticed a 
 difference immediately. I can only imagine what I will look like if I stay 
 on the R.S.T.-C forever as a daily regimen! Look out Miss America!&quot;--Suzanne Fraeyman, Warren, MI 

&quot;Recently, on a Friday, a customer came into my store 
 with a toothache. Her jaw had swollen and was spreading down her neck and 
 up to her ear. She was in considerable pain and had a slight fever. The 
 local dentist was out of town until Monday. Scanning the shelves, my eye 
 caught the E.T.I.-W formula. With its antibiotic properties of Echinacea 
 and Myrrh and the special affinity White Oak Bark has for the gums, it was 
 a perfect choice. I advised her to take a dropper full four times per day. 
 I also suggested that she soak a cotton ball in warm water and E.T.I.-W 
 and apply it directly to the tooth. She stopped in on Tuesday, all 
 smiles, no pain and no swelling. She was amazed at the quick relief.&quot;--Susie Yelverton, Smithville, TN
 
&quot;I have dark brown hair and I use henna to color it. 
 The Henna fades rather fast, but I found by using a mix of Rosemary and 
 Sage in a separate bottle at the rate of 50/50 and applying the mixture 
 directly to my scalp with a dropper the Henna does not fade. It also 
 maintains a rich color!&quot;--Sheila Naidu, Kennesaw, GA 

&quot;I wanted to tell you I am so thankful to Our Heavenly 
 Father Jehovah for having you all here on this earth to give us the 
 natural healers that our bodies can and do accept for our aches and pains. 
 Again thank you for all you have done. I will continue to use and 
 recommend your products.&quot;--Argie, Alice, TX

&quot;I am 65 years young, and I was diagnosed 10 years ago 
 with degenerative disk disease (sounds too medical)! Scoliosis appeared 
 when I was 13. Because of the 60 degree curve and compression of spinal 
 disks, pain is almost always present in my lower spine. I recently started 
 using Arnica Oil Blend and Sports Cream Plus. It has been a winning team 
 for me. I have less pain now. I apply a few drops of the Arnica Oil Blend 
 to the areas of discomfort, wait a few minutes, and then I massage a small 
 amount of the Sports Cream Plus to my lower back. Once in awhile I will 
 also apply a few drops of Indian Tobacco. I have noticed more flexibility 
 and my lower spine is more relaxed. Best of all, the pain diminishes. Also 
 great for arthritic knees and joints and also stiff neck and shoulders. 
 Thank you Pure Herbs for these winning products.&quot;--Sheila Kaplowitz, 
 Hendersonville, NC

&quot;Skin cancer has been in my family for years. My aunt 
 died from melanoma and I have had several moles removed from my face and 
 back. When I found a mole starting to grow at my hairline, I decided to 
 try Red Root and use it according to the directions in my Herbal Extract 
 book. It took several months, but it went away. My husband had a mole 
 growing on the inside curve of his ear which seemed to change color. We 
 decided to use the Red Root on it. The mole darkened and seemed to shrivel 
 and finally began to peel away form his ear. After what seemed only a few 
 weeks, the mole was hanging on by just a tiny bit of skin. My husband 
 pulled it off, the mole was black and much smaller than the original mole 
 had been! This was several months ago, and the skin is still clear. My 
 only regret is that we didn&quot;t take it to be checked for cancer.&quot;--Betty 
 Lynch, Hempstead, TX

&quot;A lady came to me because of an irregular heart beat. 
 Her doctors had told her that scar tissue on the heart was causing the 
 irregular heart beat. I recommended RST-C (Repair Scar Tissue). After 
 several months she returned with the following report, My doctors can&quot;t 
 explain why, but they cannot find any scar tissue and my heart beat is now 
 normal.&quot;&quot;--Lon Slider, Covington, IN

&quot;I had a sharp stabbing pain in my ear so I took Olive 
 Leaf and Vitamin C every hour. I also put Garlic and Mullein Oil and Olive 
 Leaf on a piece of cotton ball and put it in my ear. . . .did a heavy dose 
 at bedtime, plus rubbed the Garlic and Mullein Oil all around my ear and 
 the side of my face. The next morning the terrible pain was gone. I was so 
 impressed!&quot;--Cheryl Lawson, Derby, VT

&quot;The other day when I was shaving I nicked my face. I 
 decided to put our Sports Cream Plus on the cut. It burned a bit, but in 
 the end it helped the wound heal faster than normal and my skin felt 
 smoother. I decided to try the Sports Cream Plus on my entire face as an 
 after shave. The skin on my face now feels smooth and I feel more 
 circulation to the skin!&quot;--Dr. Eugene C. Watkins, Sterling Hgts., MI

&quot;My daughter and son-in-law were so sick with the flu 
 that they called my husband and me at 10:30 p.m. to drive the half hour to 
 their house to take them to the hospital even though they know we both 
 work and were already in bed. They felt awful; loose bowels, dizziness and 
 they couldn&quot;t even keep fluids down. We were exposed that night and I took 
 off the next day to go stay with them to take care of my four month old 
 grandson. My husband and I took one Tablespoon of C.C.E.-W once a day for 
 one week. Praise the Lord and Pure Herbs neither one of us got even a 
 touch of the flu.&quot;--M. C., Beech Grove, IN

&quot;The following is a testimonial regarding my almost 
 eight week old newborn. At the time my newborn was eight weeks old, she 
 was still jaundiced (slightly still in the eyes), and was demonstrating 
 some mild reflux symptoms, requiring us to keep her in an infant seat to 
 sleep. She also had a thick white-coated tongue. Even as a Distributor, I 
 was too exhausted to research what Pure Herbs product/s to use. I finally 
 phoned my upline Caletta Oakley who read a list of herbs for each of these 
 problems. Culvers Root (Black Root) was common to all three problems! I 
 immediately ordered a bottle, and after simply rubbing the extract on the 
 bottom of her feet and on her tummy area at diaper changes, we noticed her 
 white tongue and jaundice all clear within two weeks! Just proof again 
 that God intended . . . the leaves for healing Ez47:12&quot;&quot;.--Judy Orsborn, 
 Broomfield, CO

&quot;I was suffering with a very bad sore throat. I 
 couldn&quot;t even swallow! I decided to try Bee Propolis which is a natural 
 antibiotic. I took about 80 drops. WOW, within an hour my throat was 
 better. I was able to swallow and the unbearable pain was gone.&quot;--Betsy 
 Turnquist, Warren, MI
 
&quot;My daughter, Shannon, miscarried a baby in 2001 at 20 
 weeks gestation. She became pregnant again a few month later and began to 
 have slight cramping (contractions) almost every 30 minutes at about 10 
 weeks. Her OB/GYN advised her to stay on complete bed rest, but the 
 contractions continued anyway and he predicted she would miscarry again. I 
 prayed with all my heart that I would find a way to help my daughter. 
 Then, after researching through my HRG (Herbal Research Group) Volumes, I 
 called Pure Herbs and asked for the Crampbark and False Unicorn formula to 
 be overnighted to me. I began my daughter on the formula and she felt her 
 contractions subside within 20 minutes of taking it. She took the 
 Crampbark and False Unicorn 40 drops every four to six hours and it would 
 control the irritability of the uterus and calm the cramps. She never had 
 to set a clock to remember to take it because the cramps would come back 
 about the time the formula was due to be taken. We added Red Raspberry 
 Leaf 40 drops twice a day and P.N.-W 40 drops twice a day also. Each week, 
 we thanked God as we made a new milestone in the pregnancy. She was able 
 to make it to full-term, thanks to our Good Lord, and to Pure Herbs for 
 providing the formulas that saved my grandbaby&apos;s life. Joseph was born on 
 October 29th, 2002, at 38 weeks gestation, weighting 6 lbs. 11oz., healthy 
 and happy! By the way, my daughter&apos;s labor was very light and lasted just 
 four hours, thanks to L.6W the last month and Blue Cohosh for the last two 
 weeks. She took the Blue Cohosh during her labor and afterwards. She 
 delivered without any type of anesthesia or pain medicine. She had no 
 episiotomy either. Two hours after delivering the baby, she commented that 
 she felt as if she hadn&apos;t even had a baby. Shannon is a size zero or two. 
 She handled this delivery with confidence and calmness. Our family has so 
 much to be thankful for.Joseph is now 2 months old, breastfeeding well 
 and weighting about 12 pounds!.Shannon has now switched to several other 
 Pure Herbs formulas to ensure a good supply of breast milk (Blessed 
 Thistle) and plenty of nutrition and stamina herbs (Three Bees, A.C.S., 
 Rice Bran, Bilberry and others).And we are fortunate to be associated 
 with a company named Pure Herbs that allows itself to be a true instrument 
 of God, reaching out to those who need His healing herbs. Thank you, Dr. 
 Watkins for your personal commitment to helping others and thanks to all 
 of you that help make Pure Herbs possible.thank you, Bella Vladimirsky, 
 for introducing me to this awesome company.words seem so inadequate to 
 express my gratitude to all of you. May God bless and protect you today 
 and always!&quot;--Patti Felici, McAllen, TX&quot; 

&quot;I am happy to say Solomon Wickey&quot;s Can-sol capsules 
 really worked for my candida (yeast infection). I had a bad dose of it 
 under my breasts. It was extremely itchy and it would bleed and crack 
 open. It was very painful. When I received the pamphlet on the Can-sol 
 capsules, I decided to give them a try. I&quot;m happy to report that the 
 candida is almost completely gone. What I used was Can-sol capsules six 
 twice per day along with three Acidophilus each time the Can-sol was 
 taken. It works! Thank you Solomon and the good Lord that gives him the 
 wisdom to know what to put together that works!&quot;--S. M.Due West, S.C. 

&quot;After trying to have a child for two years with one 
 miscarriage, my husband and I went to visit Mr. Rueben Schwartz, an 
 iridologist located near Tompkinsville, KY. He suggested it could be 
 endometriosis and that I might try Red Clover Blend. He told me if taken 
 faithfully we would have a better chance at having children. Less than two 
 years later we were blessed with a beautiful son. We are convinced that 
 without Red Clover Blend this would never have been possible. After a 
 recent visit back to Mr. Schwartz, I am again taking Red Clover Blend at 
 his suggestion. Thank you for such a wonderful product.&quot;--Donna Hegan, 
 Bowling Green, KY

&quot;Oh happy day the day dry spots are going away! I have 
 been using Herbal Adjustment for dry spots that have been appearing on my 
 body, and they are just about gone. I had read in one of Dr. A. B. 
 Howard&apos;s books that Herbal Adjustment would destroy liver spots so I 
 decided to try it on dry spots and they are just about gone. It has taken 
 a long time, but I was persistent in doing so. Dr. Howard had stated that 
 it takes patience for things like this to disappear. I am also continuing 
 to use the Peppermint Oil for the allergies and headaches that I get from 
 odors. Whenever I go somewhere I have an opportunity to give a kleenex 
 that has the oil on it. People are shocked when they smell it and it helps 
 them so quickly. It has been truly a blessing to be a part of this company 
 and to be able to help people to get well without drugs. Thank you Dr. 
 Watkins and staff.&quot;--Kathleen Marasco Elgin, S.C. 

&quot;I am writing to say THANK YOU! I recently experienced 
 left chest pain, especially upon movement. At first I thought it could be 
 a heart attack or severe indigestion. After taking Herbal Adjustment and a 
 digest aide without relief I realized that my problem was muscle related. 
 Then I applied Arnica Oil Blend to my left chest area. It was amazing how 
 quickly the pain was relieved! That day the pain was gone. Your products 
 work! I use them on my family with great results. Thanks again!&quot;--Kim 
 Preston, Greenfield, OH

&quot;I have had osteoarthritis for 31 years. I have taken 
 everything natural for arthritis, but nothing has touched the pain until 
 recently. I heard about Pure Herbs A.R.T.-C by Pat Castro. Within about 14 
 days I felt 98% better from taking the A.R.T.-C. Because of the severity 
 of my arthritis, I take 40 drops of A.R.T.-C and Research Formula 4x/day. 
 I also no longer suffer with leg cramps at night. Ever so grateful!&quot;--Diane Baird, Morganfield, KY
 
&quot;After reading the testimonials regarding RST-C from 
 Peggy Ames and Lon and Sherry Slider in the Dec 2001/Jan 2002 newsletter, 
 I wanted to give RST-C a try! I had been experiencing discomfort in the 
 lower bowel and pelvic area due to prior C-sections as well as scar tissue 
 and a prolapsed bowel from an amoebae infection. My 15 year old daughter 
 was also still having pain from her 1997 appendectomy. We began by 
 applying RST-C topically as well as taking 40 drops internally. My 
 daughter also took 40 drops of Mayapple three times per day. Within a 
 week, my daughter&apos;s pain was gone and within two weeks, I passed a mass of 
 tissue through the bowel and was also pain free! One month later I 
 severely burned my arm french pressing coffee so I applied RST-C to the 
 burn area, soaked in gauze, and changed the dressing twice a day. Now 
 there is no scar or sign of anything! My arm completely healed. Because of 
 these amazing results, I decided to add 40 drops of RST-C to my daily 
 facial wash, as well as my face and body lotion. After about two months 
 what a difference it made in my complexion! Scars and wrinkle lines are 
 disappearing and my face has a healthy glow. And no blemishes! At least a 
 dozen people at church have started asking me what I&apos;m doing. They all say 
 I am looking much younger! I also added 40 drops of RST-C to my daughter&apos;s 
 facial wash and astringent and her blemishes are disappearing too! As a 
 teenager, you can imagine how thrilled she is! Thanks, Pure Herbs!&quot;--Roxanne Rodriguez, McAllen, TX 

&quot;I had to contact you folks and thank you. My 
 grandmother was the center of our very large family and one of the things 
 she swore by was Gold Thread! To us, it was the thing to use for mouth 
 sores, etc. But, when Grandma died in 1984, the secret of where to get 
 Gold Thread was lost and I never thought I&apos;d see it again. I&apos;ve seen 
 references to it on different herb web sites, but I&apos;ve never found anyone 
 who actually sold it, so when I found your site and saw that you had it 
 for sale it was actually a very poignant experience for me (as strange as 
 that may sound!). So, I just wanted to thank you. My order has been placed 
 and I can&apos;t wait for my little package to arrive. In a way it seems a 
 little silly, but that little package will mean a great deal to me!&quot;&quot;I 
 have arthritis in my shoulders and my one hip. I could not lift my one arm 
 first thing in the morning. In the beginning of December 2002 I started 
 taking Devil&apos;s Claw. In a little over three weeks when I wake up in the 
 morning I no longer have the aches and pains I used to have. My knees are 
 also feeling better. I can now stoop down and get up with no problem 
 thanks to Devil&apos;s Claw. I take two droppers full 2x/day.&quot;--Barbara Hastey 

&quot;I have had a terrible problem with acid-reflux for 
 several years. My chiropractor says I have a hiatal hernia. About every 
 two to three months she (my chiropractor) has had to pull the hernia down. 
 When she does this procedure it hurts like crazy, but the end result is I 
 don&apos;t have the reflux problem for a month or two. Last year my 
 chiropractor was away for three weeks and I was suffering terribly. I 
 couldn&apos;t even sleep well at night because of the reflux. So I pulled out 
 all of my herb books and researched like crazy to find something that 
 could possibly help my situation. What I found was by using Papaya Mints 
 and Formula Twelve 40-80 drops before meals I don&apos;t suffer from the reflux 
 problem. It is truly amazing! I wish I would have found this solution 
 years ago. Since using these two herbs together, I have not had to have my 
 chiropractor pull the hernia down and endure that pain. I&apos;m very grateful 
 and fortunate to have the herbs at my fingertips.&quot;&quot;I am 65 years old and 
 have had kidney stones for 30 years. I have had stones so large that 
 I could not pass them so doctors had to use laser treatment to burst the 
 stones in order for me to be able to pass them. I have had this 
 treatment twice. The stones came back again. I decided to seek 
 other alternatives. Someone told me about a man named Rueben 
 Schwartz who is a natural practitioner. I decided to go see him. He told me about a product called S.D.-R. I decided to give it a 
 try. I began taking the S.D.-R and within one and a half weeks I 
 began to pass small stones (nine in all that I was aware of). These 
 passed without any pain at all. I do not intend to ever be without a 
 bottle of S.D.-R in case of problems. Thank God for Rueben and 
 Pure Herbs and S.D.-R.&quot;--Randall Goodman, Lafayette, TN 
 
Note from Dr. Watkins: If you take A.C.S. (All 
 Cell Salts) along with the S.D.-R it will help balance out the minerals in 
 the body, which is extremely important to do.

&quot;A few months ago I gave a bottle of D.A.N.-C to my 
 daughter in New Jersey. She, like many others in the metropolitan 
 New York area, has felt much more anxiety and tension than usual, since 
 9-11. It was hard for her to get up and go into work every morning 
 and not focus on the negativity which surrounded her. Since taking 
 the D.A.N.-C, she is not as uptight over the things that have happened and 
 she feels more relaxed and more calm. Also, her anxiety and feelings 
 of depression have lessened. She now has a sense of well-being that 
 all will be ok. It also seems to strengthen the nervous system. In order for the D.A.N.-C to be effective you need to take it on a daily 
 basis.&quot;--Sheila Kaplowitz, Hendersonville, NC

&quot;In 1990 my wife was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the 
 liver by biopsy. With medicines given by doctors she held her own 
 until 2000, at which time she started to have other multiple problems 
 which placed her on the transplant list for a liver. After a year 
 and a half on the transplant list she was further diagnosed with Primary 
 Pulmonary Hypertension. After numerous stays in the hospital, 
 additional medicines and being put on oxygen full time, the doctors 
 determined she wasn&apos;t strong enough to go through a liver/lung transplant 
 and took her off the transplant listing. The last time in the 
 hospital was July 2002 and when I brought her home she was in an 
 essentially comatose state, sleeping all the time and not able to move 
 around by herself. The doctors called and said she had only &apos;weeks 
 to 2 months left&apos;. As this was totally unexceptable, we decided to 
 go another route. On August 3rd, 2002 we went to an Iridologist and 
 went on an herbal program. After one week she could breathe and move 
 around by herself. It is now October 12th, 2002 and we are still 
 holding in there. We are still a long way from being &apos;cured&apos;, if 
 possible, but the outlook is sure better than the doctors gave us. A 
 listing of Pure Herbs products used: A.E.A.-B, L.-W, HT. Comb., 
 Herbal Adjustment, P.C.-C, Red Clover Blended, Milk Thistle plus other 
 enzyme formulas and minerals. Note: Blood tests are still 
 showing high readings, but they are starting to come down some. Thank God, Pure Herbs and all the people that have helped us with 
 prayers.&quot;--Don Farris, Buffalo, KY

&quot;This past spring I was having trouble breathing. I went to the Herb House to see if they would help me. I started 
 taking Thyme. In only a few days my breathing was strong and I no 
 longer felt like I was smothering. It was so amazing! Thanks 
 so much. If any one should have trouble breathing I would highly 
 recommend Thyme. I go to the Herb House in Covington, IN and the 
 people there are so helpful and nice.&quot;--JeanAnne Montague, Perrysville, 
 IN

&quot;I have been taking R.&amp;S.-W for my nerves and it 
 works better than anything I&apos;ve ever taken. You all really know what 
 you are doing! Keep up the good work!&quot;--Kevin McKinney

&quot;This testimonial is for the products, Arnica Oil Blend 
 and R.S.T.-C (Repair Scar Tissue). My husband had a hernia repair 
 last October. It was bad enough that the doctor had to put a mesh in 
 place. My husband continued for two months with severe pain and 
 severe constipation. His doctor said be patient, a man of his age, 
 66, will take quite a while to heal and sent him home. I suspected 
 he had adhesions and had him see our family doctor. The scan 
 confirmed a terrible amount of adhesions. The doctor told us to use 
 whatever means naturally to help, because more surgery would cause more 
 problems. I researched Pure Herbs and made a poultice of Arnica Oil 
 Blend and R.S.T.-C externally daily. Internally he took R.S.T.-C 
 3x/day. Within one week he began to feel better. Within six 
 weeks the scar tissue was gone along with the pain and no more 
 constipation. Thank you Pure Herbs.&quot;--Janice McComb, Herb 
 Specialist, Danville, IN

&quot;We received a newsletter from Richard Dicks stating 
 that Purple Loosestrife eye washes got rid of cataracts. My husband 
 decided to try it. He had received word from eye doctors last year 
 that his one eye which has had a cataract in it, but not growing, was now 
 starting to grow and the other eye was just starting with a cataract. He decided to do one eye at a time one drop four times per day. It 
 does sting for a few minutes. He did each eye for 10 days. The 
 eye doctor just recently checked his eyes and behold - no cataracts! Thanks so much!&quot; P.S. &quot;This does sting for a few seconds.&quot;--

&quot;Smidge, Deloris Sipes grand dog took L.6W (last six 
 weeks) the last week of her pregnancy and safely and easily delivered on 
 July 31, 2002. She continued to take L.6W until her owner determined 
 that the milk production was too much. The puppies are little butter 
 balls and Smidge is a perfect mother. Thanks for all you do!&quot;--Deloris Sipes, Midland, TX

&quot;Since childhood, my two front teeth overlapped due to 
 crowding. When in my mid thirties it became fashionable for mature 
 adults to wear braces and so I did, six months later the braces came 
 off. The teeth were straight, but I was expected to wear a retainer 
 which felt uncomfortable to me so I tossed it aside. Shortly after, 
 the teeth overlapped again so I started using A.C.S. and within a year my 
 teeth were straight again. I use A.C.S. to this day. At first 
 I used 40 drops three times daily and now I use 40 drops twice daily. An extra bonus is that my jaw cracking is gone. Thank you Pure Herbs 
 for your wonderful formulas.&quot;--Simone Gaiarin, Windsor, Ontario, Canada

&quot;When we returned home from our vacation we found our 3 
 year old Silky Terrier on the brink of death. Evidently he had been 
 having diarrhea and had been throwing up all day. He was so severely 
 dehydrated that he was unable to walk and was listless and almost 
 unconscious. My daughter was hysterical! She wanted us to take 
 Bailey to the vet, but I knew he was near death, so we decided to use our 
 herb arsenal instead. Since I didn&apos;t know what was causing the dog&apos;s 
 illness (infection, poisoning or possibly a flea or tick bite reaction), I 
 just grabbed all the poison antidote and antibiotic herbs, as well as 
 A.C.S. and Research Formula, which would help with the dehydration factor. I began at 10 p.m. administering A.C.S., Research Formula, Black Cohosh, 
 Virginia Snake Root, IM.S.-W, A.M.F.-W, and W.-W, all by a small 
 dropper intermittently with droppers of water, and kept this going until 
 almost 2 a.m. (four hours). Bailey threw up the herbs twice during 
 this process, but by 2 a.m., he was able to get up and walk to where his 
 dry food and water had remained untouched during the day, and began to 
 drink water on his own and also began to eat! I stayed watching him 
 about 30 minutes after that and felt it was safe to go to sleep. In 
 the morning, we had a brand new puppy! Bailey was back to normal, as 
 if nothing had ever happened! I am convinced that if we had taken 
 Bailey to the vet, the dog would probably have died. My daughter 
 wants to become a vet someday and I hope she will, after seeing the 
 amazing results and use herbs whenever possible to treat her animals. Thank you Pure Herbs!&quot;--Roxanne Rodriguez, McAllen, TX

&quot;Additional uses for Virginia Snake Root: I have 
 a client who has dealt with both environmental and food 
 allergies/sensitivities for many years. This wonderful woman, coming 
 from a Jamaican background, is delightfully unaffected by the 
 sensationalistic media which aims to frighten people away from herbs. After she had made marked improvements with de-toxification, she still had 
 some problems with certain foods and environmental symptoms. After 
 supplying her with Virginia Snake Root to have on hand in case one of her 
 smaller children should need an anti-poison remedy for mosquito bites or 
 accidental ingestion of toxic materials; she surmised (I wish I had 
 thought of this) that the body regards any material that is either 
 undigested or an overload to a sensitive or toxic body, as poison..that 
 Virginia Snake Root may be helpful to neutralize the reaction in your 
 body. Now she carries it with her when out to dinner, for instance, 
 so that she can immediately neutralize the percepted poisons and avoid 
 symptoms. So please keep Virginia Snake Root in your herb cabinet 
 for those times when allergies prevail. The herb can be taken both 
 internally and applied topically for whatever the situation demands.&quot;--Dr. Gael Struck-Riverz, N.D., Hartland, WI

&quot;Sports Cream Plus is the best cream I have used for my 
 aches and pains, especially my neck, which has suffered four whiplashes. I find It also works really well on all other joints and muscles that may 
 be painful. Whatever the pain of the day is, Sports Cream Plus will 
 make it feel so much better. I love the smell of it too! I use 
 it after I shower and at night before I go to bed. Try it, you&apos;ll 
 like it!&quot;--Marcella Angelou, Basking Ridge, NJ

&quot;Repeatedly I had heard that Oil of Cajeput was helpful 
 with the flu and colds, yet I&apos;d not tried using it. After nearly 
 four months of listening to my 13 year old daughter complain about stuffy 
 sinuses and sinus headaches from a cold in December of 2001, I decided to 
 try the Cajeput. To my amazement her sinuses opened up in under a 
 week and three of us in the family who were suffering colds, rid ourselves 
 in a few days by sniffing the Oil. Also, my son got through a nasty 
 flu with very sticky mucus in the nose and chest by using the Oil of 
 Cajeput. Lastly, my third child who&apos;d had a boil since 
 November on her thigh, used the Oil on it and it is now almost gone. I respect this Oil and its many uses. Thank you!&quot;--The Twill 
 family, Summit, NJ

&quot;I want to thank Edna Ford for starting me on A.E.A.-B 
 extract for my asthma. Before taking it I would get bronchitis two 
 or three times a year. Since taking the A.E.A.-B I haven&apos;t had 
 bronchitis for over a year. I will continue to take this product in 
 hopes of never getting bronchitis ever again.&quot;--E. M. L., Riverview, FL

&quot;My feet, around my heels, developed this thick skin 
 that appeared to be out of control. Once it was soaked you could 
 begin to remove it, but it was spreading. I used tea tree oil and 
 kept after it and thought I&apos;d won the battle. However, it came back 
 and I finally made an appointment with the Podiatrist who was stumped. Since my visit wasn&apos;t until the following week I decided to try and use 
 Olive Leaf extract and it was improving by leaps and bounds. When I 
 went to see my Podiatrist I explained what I did. I left information 
 on Olive Leaf extract and cancelled my follow up visit. Thank you, 
 Olive Leaf extract!&quot;--Robert Martin, Collingswood, NJ

&quot;I have type 1 diabetes and have developed moderate to 
 severe neuropathy (nerve-suffering) of the right leg and both feet, and 
 also the stomach and chest nerves. Most days my feet burned 
 uncomfortably by the end of the day, and my legs felt numb and stressed. Also, I used to get sensations of my heartbeat racing, if my blood sugars 
 dropped too low, or were too high, but lately the neuropathy of those 
 nerves have given no warning of this. I told a friend about these 
 problems and she suggested I try N.P.-T. I used the N.P.-T 
 externally on my legs, feet and low back to see if I could get some 
 relief. After applying the combination for two days, morning and 
 evening, I felt such blessed relief that it was almost unimaginable to me 
 that the herbs could supply so much relief. I decided to try 
 applying this combination to my stomach and am pleased with the results. My enormous gratitude to Pure Herbs products and my good friend, Bonnie 
 Miller!&quot;--Patricia Ross, Shelby Twp, MI

&quot;A few months ago I visited my Primary Care Physician 
 for a toenail fungus. I had had the same toenail removed twice 
 before by other physicians over the past five years and each time after 
 growing back, the fungus returned. He asked me what I wanted to do. When I told him I wanted to get rid of the fungus and keep the nail, he 
 suggested a polish, told me I would have to use at least four bottles to 
 get rid of it and it would take approximately two months. I went to 
 pick up the prescription and it was $165.00 per bottle! When I 
 realized my insurance would not cover it I called my physician. He 
 told me he would not prescribe anything else because it could cause liver 
 damage. I had a bottle of Oil of Cajeput which I had purchased for a 
 candida protocol. I called my CNHP (Certified Natural Health 
 Professional) and she told me to use the Oil of Cajeput along with some 
 other things. My husband told me to just try the Oil of Cajeput by 
 itself, since I already had a bottle. In the past the fungus got 
 closer to the base of the nail as the nail grew out. After 
 using the Oil of Cajeput the nail grew, but as the nail grew out so did 
 the fungus.&quot; --L. O., Acworth, GA

&quot;Ever since 1982 I have had severe allergies. Nothing the doctors have prescribed has helped. My aunt told me to 
 go see Reuben Schwartz. I saw him in May 2002 and he told me to try 
 S.I.A.-R (Sinus and Allergy - Reuben Schwartz). Since I have been on 
 this product I haven&apos;t had a problem with allergies. My first spring 
 without burning eyes, stuffy nose and sneezing. I can breath!!! Thank you so much!!! I am now singing the praises about Reuben 
 Schwartz and Pure Herbs, Ltd.&quot;--John Turner, Louisville, KY&quot;I purchased 
 a bottle of Ol&apos; Number 11 for myself, I have lower back problems and had 
 tried DSK which didn&apos;t much help me, so I was told to try Ol&apos; Number 11. The DSK does help my husband, he swears by it! Anyways, the Ol&apos; 
 Number 11 didn&apos;t seem to help me, but here is my testimony: Our 
 family dog, Nugget, who was 15 years old at the time I used the Ol&apos; Number 
 11, was trying to jump on the couch and her back legs were not strong 
 enough and she fell back. I thought she broke her legs. I took 
 her to the vet and she said she didn&apos;t break anything, just might have 
 hyperextended them or sprained them pretty bad. Well, with her being 
 15 at the time I thought we would have to put her to sleep, but I wasn&apos;t 
 going to give up!  I decided to try the Ol&apos; Number 11 on her one leg 
 and also to pray a lot for her. By the third day she was able to 
 walk on the one leg. Praise the Lord!!! The next day I started 
 applying the Ol&apos; Number 11 to both of her hind legs. After a couple 
 of days she was walking stronger than ever. Thanks for distributing 
 a product that a lot of people know works.&quot; --Cheryl McGowen, 
 Urbana, OH

&quot;After years of suffering with ankle pain from sports 
 injuries, I was scheduled for ankle fusion surgery. Since there were 
 no successful results from former individuals who had this surgery done, I 
 decided to cancel the procedure. I found out about an athletic 
 injury therapist, Rawle Morris in Beaverton, Oregon (Back in Motion). Rawle inspected my ankles and found them to be the worst ankles he&apos;d ever 
 seen. He began therapy on them and had me rub on Big Five and 
 Arnica. He also told me I could take C.C.E.-W, CA.-W, Capsicum, 
 A.C.S. and Grape Seed for a maintenance program. I did as he advised 
 and after six months much of the pain is gone from my more painful ankle 
 (the right one). We are now working on my left ankle which is 
 realigning and causing pain. I know this is a somewhat long process, 
 but I know with time I will be able to walk again without 
 excruciating pain. Rawle Morris is a fantastic friend and therapist 
 and Pure Herbs are also my friends!&quot;--Merlin Ludwig, Portland, OR

&quot;A friend of mine has been trying to get pregnant for 
 over two years. Her gynecologist diagnosed a thyroid problem and 
 Endometriosis, but never prescribed medication to correct these problems, 
 thank goodness! After seeing Reuben Schwartz and taking T.-W and Red 
 Clover Blended for six months, not only did her condition improve she is 
 now two months pregnant. Also, my 13 year old daughter went to 
 Reuben with Endometriosis in October of 2001. She had been 
 complaining of abdominal pain frequently. After several months of 
 the Red Clover Blended she is now pain free. I am so thankful we 
 caught this early. Reuben Schwartz and Pure Herbs are truly gifts 
 from God.&quot;--Bobbi Cooper, Bowling Green, KY

&quot;I am so thankful and grateful to God and Joan Thompson 
 for the custom blend called E.H.2-T which is the only product I have found 
 to help with depression. I was not able to use the E.H.-T because it 
 contains St. Johns Wort whereas the E.H.2-T does not.  I have type O 
 blood and cannot tolerate St. Johns Wort. Also, the E.H.2-T contains 
 an herb called Wolfberry Root which helps to lower my blood pressure and 
 sugar levels. This blend has been a blessing to me for the above 
 reasons and because I do not have to take prescription medication for 
 depression. I don&apos;t know what I would do with out it. Thanks 
 so much!&quot;Lynn Schamens, Becker, MN 

&quot;My name is Juliann. I want to thank you for your 
 products! Last year my nine year old daughter was bitten by a brown 
 recluse spider in the arm. I had never heard about brown recluses 
 before. Well, my homework only began . . . I took my daughter to the 
 emergency room after one of my friends said the bug bite was by a brown 
 recluse. I got on the internet to look up information about brown 
 recluses. It was a scary ordeal. The outcome looked grim. At the hospital the doctor said there was nothing they could do but put 
 steroid cream on her arm and give her antibiotics then wait it out to see 
 how much damage the bite would make. Then the next step would be to 
 give my daughter skin graphs to repair the damage. Luckily, I 
 listened to my own inner guide and called a macrobiotic counselor and 
 friend. By this time the bite had ulcerated to the size of a dime, 
 with a hole, dark red in color. My friend suggested aloe vera gel 
 and instantly the hole started to turn white. The aloe vera cooled 
 the wound. I wasn&apos;t satisfied enough with that so the next day . . . by the guidance from God, I was lead to a local health store which 
 is no longer in business. There I was turned on to your product 
 P.A.-K and another product called green clay which is from another 
 company. I made the mixture and applied it to my daughters wound. It pulled the infection out and later I healed the surface of the skin 
 with an aloe vera, colloidal silver and tea tree mixture. If not for 
 your product, I feel my daughter would have gone through a tremendous 
 ordeal at the hospital and with surgery that would have left scars on her 
 body and emotional trauma for life. A few days later I took her to 
 Vanderbilt for them to check the wound just to be sure it was healing. The doctor there told me whatever I was doing to just keep it up and that 
 the wound was healing and there was nothing else they could do to help it 
 along. Sooooo, after a long story, A BIG THANK YOU!!!!&quot;--Juliann 
 Gates, Hendersonville, TN

&quot;During 1999, my pregnant daughter complained of side 
 effects of iron tablets prescribed by her doctor. I encouraged her 
 to try HI.I-W. She started with 20 drops and increased to 30 drops 
 per day. Within three days she was calling and telling me how much 
 energy she had and how much better she was feeling. Needless to say, 
 she continued throughout her pregnancy and delivered a strong, healthy, 
 millennium baby boy. I also had a friend try a bottle of HI.I.-W because 
 she complained of low energy. She was amazed at how much 
 better she felt after several days. She uses 40 drops three times 
 per day following menstruation.&quot;--Ellen Sumner, Harrisonburg, VA

&quot;My name is Rick Louden, Edna Ford&apos;s son. I&apos;m the 
 co-creator of the formulas you manufacture for us. (F.&amp;F. -F, 
 IS.-F,&amp;HR.-F) My mom said I should write and tell you about our 
 use of the F.&amp;F.-F, so here it is. My wife Paula has I.H.S.S. 
 heart (Idiopathic Hypertrophic Sub-Aortic Stenosis). She is the 
 longest lived survivor of this condition. We give F.&amp;F.-F a lot of 
 the credit for this as she has to go into I.C.U. at the least bit of a 
 fever. With her heart condition, the flu can be deadly. Thanks 
 to taking the F.&amp;F. -F at the first sign of illness, she hasn&apos;t been in 
 the hospital (for illness) for many years. Also, a man I knew at 
 work contracted genital herpes (this was years before we submitted the 
 formulas to Pure Herbs). He asked if there was anything I knew of 
 that could help with the horrible outbreaks. An Amish herbalist 
 friend (Solomon Wickey) had told us that our F.&amp;F.-F formula (by his 
 testing) should kill just about any virus it was used on. So, I did 
 a viral purge on my friend and gave him 120 drops to take 10 drops at a 
 time in 8oz. of water over a period of 24 to 48 hours. I told him 
 not to drink anything else in that time. Shortly after that he left 
 the shop and moved South. Last year he came back to work here. The first thing he did when he saw me was give me a big hug! He told 
 me he hadn&apos;t had a single reoccurrence since the day I gave him the F.&amp;F.-F. Furthermore, while in New Orleans, he had blood tests run and 
 he tested negative for the herpes virus. We tried the same regimen 
 for the lady he contracted the herpes virus from. She has not had an 
 outbreak since! If I contracted an &apos;incurable&apos; virus, I&apos;d take the 
 F.&amp;F.-F and do a virus purge as well. Then in a few weeks I&apos;d get 
 retested just to be sure it had worked. I&apos;ve had many other 
 testimonials given to me of people with all kinds of different viruses 
 that were helped using F.&amp;F.-F.&quot;--Richard Louden, Connersville, IN

&quot;In May of 1999, I was diagnosed with a periodontal 
 pocket in my lower jaw tooth. I started using Pure Herbs Myrrh in my 
 dental irrigation system, and within four months my dental hygienist 
 noticed an improvement. I have continued using the Myrrh once a 
 night since that time. In July 2001, I tried a bottle of T.G.&amp;P.-W. I used this instead of the Myrrh (40 drops in the irrigation system). Upon an October 10th dental appointment, I was surprised to learn there 
 had been more gum improvement. This was in spite of the fact that I 
 had been under a tremendous amount of stress the past several months. My dental hygienist was so impressed that she requested information on 
 this Pure Herbs product. To date, I am continuing with the T.G.&amp;P.-W 
 and occasionally using the straight Myrrh instead.&quot;--Ellen Sumner, 
 Harrisonburg, VA

&quot;The end of last year was a very sad time for me and my 
 family. My father passed away. I would like, though, to share 
 a blessing and that is that my father did not suffer. He also 
 knew who he was, who we were, where he was and he was virtually pain free. The only prescriptions he had from the medical doctor during his last 
 eight months were for his thyroid. He had been on 80 grams of Lasix 
 a day when we brought him home from the nursing home. We used UR.-W, 
 Pleurisy Root, and Milk Thistle internally to keep his legs and ankles 
 from swelling and to get him functioning free of the Lasix. We used 
 T.L.-C, E.T.I.-W (my husband rubbed it on and around my fathers neck and 
 ears) to keep his upper respiratory and chest free of mucus and the 
 wheezing caused from my fathers congestive heart condition. To heal 
 his bed sores, we applied Arnica Oil Blend and Olive Leaf. All of 
 the medical and health care people who visited my father regularly 
 commented on how healthy he looked and how good his color was! When 
 my father passed, he passed without violence, anguish or pain. He 
 just went to sleep. What better blessing is there?&quot;--The Courter&apos;s, 
 Valley View, TX

&quot;I have heavy bleeding during my menstrual cycle and am 
 also menopausal. My medical doctor put me on Ibuprofen 400 mg. one 
 or two tablets by mouth three times a day. While they do stop the 
 heavy bleeding, I feared what else this medication might be doing to me. I did not want any side effects from the Ibuprofen so I started using the herb Shepherds Purse which stopped the bleeding. When my menstrual 
 cycle has gone for four days, I take the Shepherds Purse and the bleeding 
 stops. Before I was having a heavy period for seven to nine days. I also take Greasewood daily and it also help me with my female problems.&quot;--A.F., Detroit, MI 

&quot;After being diagnosed with a severe case of 
 osteoarthritis in my right hip during March of 2000, I knew I would have 
 to be pro-active in dealing with this serious situation. Being a 
 believer in alternative methods, I tried Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM, 
 Sam-e, and vitamin and mineral supplementation. In March of 2001, I 
 added CA.-W 80 drops three times per day. After several months I 
 dropped back to 40 drops three times per day. Beginning in March of 
 2001, I had complemented my treatment plan with visits to an osteopathic 
 physician. These visits helped with range of motion and some pain 
 reduction. In April of 2001, I added 40 drops of Irish Moss three 
 times per day, after meals. After six to eight weeks, I noticed 
 improvement in the pain level in my hip. No other treatments had 
 been used during that time. Most of my pain reduction, I noticed, 
 came after taking the Irish Moss. To date, I have been able to 
 prevent a total hip replacement.&quot;--Ellen Sumner, Harrisonburg, VA

&quot;I had been going to a medical doctor and he had me 
 taking eight different drugs and told me I had a bad heart. I went 
 to Nashville, Tennessee to St. Thomas Hospital two times to see about it, 
 but they didn&apos;t help because they said I had a blood clot in my heart. I came back home and went to see Reuben Schwartz and he told me it was my 
 thyroid and that I also had something wrong with my heart. He 
 started me on the following herbs: H.T. Comb., Herbal Adjustment, 
 Sanicle, Target TSII, O.C.-M, A.C.S, and Sassafras. I started 
 feeling better within two weeks.  I have been back since, to see 
 Reuben and he says I am doing fine. I feel great! If it weren&apos;t for 
 Reuben I don&apos;t think I would be alive today. I believe with the 
 proper usage of herbs they can be better in some cases than prescribed 
 medication as the herbs are natural. They were in my case.&quot;--Thelma 
 Bacon, Tompkinsville, KY

&quot;I have had herpes (on my ear lobe, of all places) for 
 about 20 years. For about a year now, I have had one flare-up after 
 another with that constant itchy, tingly feeling in between. The 
 Zovirax that the doctor gave me didn&apos;t help, Lysine didn&apos;t help and Lemon 
 Balm didn&apos;t help. I heard about IVY-D and ordered some immediately! I took three droppers full internally and I applied a couple of drops on 
 my skin (at the ear). The next day that feeling was gone! I 
 continued to take it internally and rub it on externally until the 1 oz. 
 bottle was gone. I haven&apos;t had herpes since. I just can&apos;t 
 believe how fast it worked! I keep a bottle handy in case I feel a 
 flare-up coming on, but so far I haven&apos;t needed it! Thank you, thank 
 you, thank you!!!&quot;--K.L, Irmo, SC

&quot;Milk Thistle - the liver&apos;s best friend! This is 
 the best protector and detoxifier of the liver. The major 
 constituent is silymarin , which encourages the liver to produce its own 
 type of toxic avengers. I personally use it every day as a 
 preventative in my own personal program. I want my liver to function 
 as optimal as possible.&quot;--Marcella Angelou, Basking Ridge, NJ

&quot;Geneva Gile suggested that I write you about my 
 successful use of Purple Loosestrife to remove a cataract in my right eye. In February of 1999, my right eye was bothering me when reading. My 
 medical doctor said it wouldn&apos;t hurt my eye to read with the glasses I 
 had. When I returned home I went directly to see Geneva and she sold 
 me a bottle of Purple Loosestrife. After about 3 days I picked this 
 jelly like mass from the corner of my eye. I have been fine ever 
 since. I read with my right eye and see distance with my left 
 eye.&quot;--A. H.

&quot;I have been taking Pure Herbs for a long time. In 1999 my back and buttocks became so painful, I could barely get up and 
 down. I went to a chiropractor, but his help was only temporary. By chance I started taking Red Clover Blend and Super Bugs to keep the flu 
 away. After taking them both for about a month, 40 drops 3x/day, I 
 passed a mass of tissue through the bowels and I haven&apos;t had anymore low 
 back pain since. Also, I have stayed on both these supplements and I 
 haven&apos;t had the flu. I am so thankful that they have helped me. Thank you for these fine products!&quot;--C. J., Bloomington, IN

&quot;For all of you ladies who are going through &apos;the 
 change,&apos; I have found that S.M.&amp;W-S (Stimulant for men&amp;women -Solomon 
 Wickey) is WONDERFUL!!! It really helps out with the &apos;hot flashes&apos; 
 and it is very soothing. For myself, I use four droppers three times 
 a day. I hope others will try this awesome product and have as much 
 success as I have had in relieving &apos;hot flashes&apos;. As we women know, 
 going through &apos;the change&apos; is a real challenge, but with Doc and his herbs 
 it has truly made a difference. Thank you Doc and the girls for 
 everything!&quot;--L. Zirger, Lakewood, CO

&quot;After wheezing for 15 years, it was suggested by a 
 Pure Herbs expert that I use Astragalus for my immune system. So I 
 listened and I&apos;m happy to say I&apos;ve not used my inhalers (which I used to 
 help me breath after I started wheezing) in about 8 months. I am 
 able to clean my house, walk in the fertilizer dept at K Mart, play with 
 my cat and NO WHEEZING.&quot;--Chris Belter, Ormond Beach, FL 

&quot;I am only 53 and for several years when I got out of 
 bed I used to walk like I was 90 years old, all crunched over taking only 
 baby steps at first. Now I get out of bed and I feel like I&apos;m 20 
 again. I attribute this to all of the herbs I have been taking for a 
 couple of years now, especially the A.C.S. I take A.C.S. (for 
 mineral supplementation), Astragalus (to build my immune system), Yokum 
 (for hot flashes) which works unbelievably well, M.G.-W (for energy and to 
 nourish the glands), Herbal Adjustment (for circulation), and Vita-Lixir 
 (for vitamin supplementation). I have recently added to my daily 
 regime: N.-W (for my nerves), Milk Thistle (for my liver), B.C.-W 
 (to cleanse my blood), Vitamin A&amp;D (for my skin and eyes), and Vitamin E 
 (as an antioxidant). For anyone wondering how I take all of these 
 herbs at a time here is what I do: I use small containers called 
 smidgets (from Tupperware) you could also use their midgets (which 
 are normally used for salad dressing or to hold cake decorations), or you 
 could use film containers. Basically, anything small enough to store 
 easily and with a lid. What I do is every Sunday I line up my 
 smidgets and fill them with my mixture of herbs. I make enough to 
 take twice daily for one or two weeks. This helps me to remember to 
 take my herbs regularly and saves me time when in a hurry, like most 
 everyone is. I usually add a bit of juice to my container of herbs 
 when I go to take them and then down the hatch they go! Thank you 
 Pure Herbs you have improved my health.&quot;--Kathy Fallon, Ocean Isle 
 Beach, NC

&quot;My granddaughter Melissa when she was 12 was diagnosed 
 by the hospital with mono. She couldn&apos;t swallow and her spleen was 
 so swollen the doctor said she would have to start school late and would 
 not be able to play any sports that year due to the danger of her getting 
 hit in the spleen causing a hemorrhage which could be life threatening. I applied Peppermint Oil, IVY-D, and Herbal Adjustment to her spine and on 
 her neck twice in the morning and twice in the evening. She could 
 only drink sips of water because her throat was so sore. With the 
 sips of water I gave her internally, 20 drops of Oregon Grape, 20 drops of 
 A.C.S., and 20 drops of Sage to cleanse her lymph nodes. By 
 the third evening following the above procedures she was felling well. Two weeks later her doctor confirmed that Melissa&apos;s spleen was normal and 
 that she could start school on time and play sports if she wanted.&quot;--Willys 
 Judware, Brewer, ME

&quot;Michael Slider is five years old. Last week he 
 put the palm of his hand on his grandmother&apos;s hot stove. Michael 
 responded with screaming and crying, until I applied Pure Herbs Arnica to 
 his burn. Arnica removed the trauma and immediately Michael stopped 
 crying. He has not had as much as a blister or even redness on that 
 hand. We think Arnica is next to a miracle! Thanks!&quot;--Karryn

A VERY SPECIAL TESTIMONIAL (PICTURES NOT INCLUDED 
 ON WEB SITE)&quot;This is my son, Christopher Ames. Picture one was 
 taken before his accident; he was a normal healthy six year old getting 
 out of the swimming pool. Picture two and three are at his 7th 
 birthday party 6 months after his accident. Our dog leaped into the 
 air after a toy Chris was playing with and came down on Chris&apos; face. We would soon learn he had a lacerated cornea-center of his pupil. The doctor sent us to the cornea specialist in Indianapolis where he 
 became the most serious patient they were caring for. They told us 
 Chris had parasites, bacterial infection and fungus because of the dogs 
 dirty paw. Their concentration was on killing these infections and 
 hopefully save the eye. After an experimental eye drop they put 
 together, and traveling day after day 150 miles to Indy, and a biopsy as 
 well, they felt he was very lucky to have saved the eye. Now the 
 only hope they gave me of improving his vision was to come back for a 
 cornea transplant when he was 19. His vision was now 220/20, and he 
 was legally blind in that eye. He was suffering from intense pain 
 which can be seen in pictures 2 and 3. He almost never relaxed his 
 face or uncovered his eye. Sometimes he would put a coat or towel 
 over his head to completely shut out all light. His face was always 
 red and twisted. Since the doctor released us to go back to the eye 
 doctor in Danville for follow ups, I wanted to do something before our 2 
 week visit. We stopped at the Herb House in Covington, IN. My 
 hope and prayer was that there would be something to help with the pain. We started Chris on a new product called R.S.T.-C for scar tissue. I 
 put 3 droppers full under his tongue 3 times a day. After only 6 
 days, he put his hand down, opened his eye and the redness was gone. When we saw the doctor they questioned me about what I was giving him 
 because his eye was now 150/20 and improving. After 3 bottles his 
 eye sight is 69/20 and his beautiful face is back! Picture number 4. Thank you! Praise the Lord!&quot;--Peggy Ames, mother, Danville, IL.  

&quot;A picture tells a lot! The testimony above 
 reminds us of the scripture that says, &apos;and the blind shall see&apos;. We 
 were ecstatic over Chris&apos; recovery! Thank you for R.S.T.-C. R.S.T.-C stands for Repair Scar Tissue. R.S.T.-C works on any kind 
 of scar tissue anywhere in the body. Operations often cause scar 
 tissue (the doctors call it adhesions) which create problems. It is 
 often necessary to have another operation just to remove the scar tissue 
 from the first surgery, and then another to remove scar tissue from the 
 last surgery, etc., etc. We have many wonderful testimonies about 
 how R.S.T.-C removed the scar tissue which enabled people to avoid further 
 surgeries. Adhesions often cause pain. R.S.T.-C has been very 
 successful at relieving pain, often in only 1 week.&quot;--Lon&amp;Sherry 
 Slider, Herb House, Covington, IN

&quot;I would like to share with you how you can keep your 
 cost down for heating this winter. Last year I was able to keep my 
 thermostat between 60-64 degrees without freezing. I have a sponge 
 on a long plastic stick and I put Herbal Adjustment on this sponge. I put the Herbal Adjustment all the way up my spine, around my neck, 
 shoulders and across the girdle on the hips. And, if you really get 
 cold put it on the bottoms of your feet. I haven&apos;t had to do that 
 because I keep warm without it. Some people who have done this say 
 it burns when they take a shower the next day, but if they perservere the 
 burning will stop. This is how I have been able to keep my money in 
 my pocket and out of the heating source&apos;s pocket! Thanks again for 
 Herbal Adjustment!&quot;--Jan, Herbs and Things, Brighton, CO

&quot;Let me tell you of two experiences with Oil of Cajeput. Five years ago my husbands&apos; aunt had gangrene in two of her toes. She refused surgery to amputate her foot. She was 92 then. She 
 came here with us from the hospital and I started soaking her feet daily 
 and putting Oil of Cajeput on the two toes and bandaged her foot ever day 
 for about nine months. Here&apos;s the miracle. The black rotting 
 toes dried up gradually and fell of in the bandage one morning. Our 
 doctor checked the foot and cut the bone away and we cared for the area a 
 few months more until the skin healed over. She&apos;s 97 now and not a 
 diabetic. A month ago my husband went to our doctor for a check-up. He had a fungus infection under his big toe. The nail was lifted up 
 and didn&apos;t look good. Our doctor said the medicine for fungal 
 infection wasn&apos;t good for his liver so I told him I would try &apos;my herbs&apos; 
 first. I treated his foot with Oil of Cajeput every night. I 
 soaked the foot in true soap and a few drops of Oil of Cajeput in the 
 water. Then I rubbed Pure Herbs Aloe all over the cracks in his skin 
 and put a few drops of Cajeput under the nail every night. I did 
 this for three weeks and his foot looks good. It&apos;s all dried up 
 under the nail and the cracks are looking good too.&quot;--Jane Coons, 
 Johnstown, NY

&quot;I would like to share with you how I helped the man I 
 recently married who had viral pneumonia. His medical doctor had 
 given him up for dead (really!) because he had weak lungs anyway and said 
 there was nothing that could be done. One lung was entirely black 
 and the second was about half gone. I had never met a man with a 
 sweeter Christian heart, I did what I could. I used about ten 
 different &apos;mixes&apos; and single herbs; most specifically virus fighter Bee 
 Propolis and Pleurisy Root. I have always blessed the day I first 
 heard of Pure Herbs (they turned my own health completely around!) but now 
 . . . I keep my new husband on a maintenance program of herbs for liver 
 detoxification and lung healing and he is learning the use of many herbs. He&apos;s gotten to where he asks for specific things as he needs them. We keep a &apos;medicine chest&apos; of herbs such as Oil of Cajeput (everything 
 from brushing teeth to healing sores), Ol&apos; Number 11, and Red Clover 
 Blended (questionable &apos;sun spots) for a variety of ills. The 
 contagious sinus-y thing that goes around seems to respond well to 
 snorting S.I.-W (startling, but worth it) several times a day for several 
 days in a row. I also wanted to mention that my husband has had 
 severe problems with the so-called &apos;reflux&apos; disease. Turning him 
 into a guinea pig, I used the hypothesis that the real problem for most 
 people is not too much acid, but insufficient digestive enzymes (as 
 identified in past Pure Herbs research). I got him chewable because 
 reflux individuals have trouble swallowing at times. The difference 
 is amazing. He previously swallowed tums like candy, to no avail, 
 and would choke himself awake at night. Now he sleeps through the 
 night and no longer has the bloating, stomach discomfort, pain and 
 choking. Maybe this can help someone else?&quot;--Diane Floerchinger, 
 Littleton, CO

&quot;In July of 1999 I was diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism 
 (Graves Disease). The medical doctor immediately wanted to give me 
 radioactive iodine to kill the thyroid. In August 1999 I went to 
 another doctor who did more tests which confirmed the diagnosis. But 
 I just didn&apos;t see any sense in killing an organ in my body. In 
 September I went to see Doctor Watkins at his office in Southfield and he 
 put me on a regime to clean, repair, eliminate viral poisons and reduce 
 trauma to the thyroid. I applied Black Cohosh, Burdock, Ol&apos; Number 
 11, and Arnica to my neck and over my thyroid area twice a day and took 
 one tablespoon of Ol&apos; Number 11 orally. On my return to the medical 
 doctor in December, my thyroid hormone levels were normal. The 
 doctor was amazed! He had never had such a turn-around from full 
 blown Graves Disease. The doctor told me that whatever I did to get 
 better, not to tell anyone, because it would put him out of business!&quot;--Carol Schmitz, Commerce Twp., MI

&quot;I just wanted to let you know that my mother-in-law 
 came down with severe Rheumatoid arthritis. She went to a medical 
 doctor who just shook his head and gave her medication to stop the pain. He said there was nothing more he could do. We decided to attack it 
 naturally. Asking around, we found that it can come from silicon 
 implants. We began cleansing. Of all the products we used 
 (many herbs) I have to attribute much of the success to Research Formula. This neutralized the toxins as they were being cleansed from her system. If Research Formula wasn&apos;t used she could have become poisoned. After only two-four weeks the improvement was remarkable. She could 
 sleep at night with no shoulder pain. She even called to say (in 
 tears) that she could get on her knees and pray again!!! Her hands 
 can straighten now and the knots have gone down 50%. She&apos;s on her 
 way. I must again say hooray for Pure Herbs!&quot;--Lana Comstock, 
 Magnolia, TX

&quot;One of our customers had a girl that was nervous 
 because she didn&apos;t want to go to school. They wanted to hold her 
 back in her grade. The girl started taking Pure Herbs B.N.C.-W and 
 is now doing a lot better.&quot;--A Friend&quot;One of our children was so 
 absent-minded, forgetful, and had a real hard time in school and would 
 bite his finger nails off that we were told to try the B.N.C.-W. We 
 had good results. His grades in school went from almost failing to 
 an 82 (B) average, he quit biting his finger nails and isn&apos;t so irratible 
 when he takes his herbs regularly.&quot;--Miriam Yoder&apos;s clients, Reedsville, 
 PA

&quot;I have been taking supplements for over 20 years for 
 numerous ailments, even though my doctors said they really weren&apos;t 
 necessary. I had very low blood pressure, I was very weak , 
 depressed and moody. I also had stomach and gall bladder problems. At my requests my doctor did a thyroid and blood sugar test. He told 
 me they showed no problems. Then, I finally saw an Iridologist, 
 Reuben Schwartz who recommended I try H.I.K.-W for blood sugar and craving 
 sweeets, T.-W for my thyroid, Licorice Root for my adrenals and Big 5 and 
 Peppermint Oil for my back pain (resulting from an auto accident). I 
 also took S.I.-W for my sinus problems and it was very helpful. Since then I continue to use these herbal products and my son and husband 
 even use some of the herbs for their problems. We all feel much 
 better. I am so thankful for God sending these people and herbs to 
 help us. We feel obligated to give our testimonials and help as many 
 other people as we can. The reason is they really do work, but only 
 if you take them!&quot;--Virginia Rountree, Brownsville, KY

&quot;I am happy to say in my experiences truly your 
 products are the best! Tom Slider introduced me to Pure Herbs about 
 4 years ago. One day upon looking in my brother-in-laws eyes, I saw 
 glaucoma, he however know of his condition, his mother had it as well. I suggested B.&amp;B.-W. After one bottle, he returned to his eye 
 specialist to find the glacuoma was gone and his hearing was better as 
 well. I&apos;m saddened to say people with long-standing conditions don&apos;t 
 realize what true maintenance is until they have had the condition for a 
 year or two and it becomes a cronic condition and keeps reoccuring. Now when my brother-in-law orders B.&amp;B.-W he orders it two bottles at a 
 time. He says he will never be without the herbs again. I say, 
 &apos;thank God for the Pure Herbs family.&apos;&quot;--Rashawn Douglas, Camden, NJ

&quot;My husband had congestion in the base of his throat 
 for seven months. Three doctors gave him prescriptions for a nasal 
 drip. Finally, the third doctor took an EKG and sent him to a heart 
 doctor. The congestion was a symptom of a heart problem, an enlarged 
 weak heart. Richard Dicks told us to try Stone Root and in two days 
 it was cleared up. He is still taking it and the congestion hasn&apos;t 
 come back. My husband is now on H.T. Combination and Lily of the 
 Valley&amp;Blessed Thistle and is feeling stronger. I also have a 
 testimony to share. I took Stone Root and my hemorroids were gone in 
 2 weeks.&quot;--Barbara Hastey, Dover, NJ

&quot;For stubborn sinus problems use the following: 4oz. Distilled water with 20 drops of Olive Leaf Extract. Shake the 
 bottle a few times and drop up your nostrils four times a day. Easy 
 and it works! Olive Leaf removes bacteria, viruses, fungus, and 
 parasites, even in your sinuses. Olive Leaf along with Red Clover 
 Blended removes &apos;cancerous tumors&apos;. Also, Sanicle should be added if 
 there are several tumors. One man I have helped had 42 tumors - 
 malignant and the third time they returned verified by Cat Scan. Two 
 bottles each of Olive Leaf and Red Clover Blended and there were only 21 
 tumors, verified by Cat Scan. He has continued with the &apos;program&apos; 
 and upon last check only had 14 tumors and they are shrinking. He 
 then decided to cancel his planned surgery. He looks and feels 
 great! On the riddance of herpes: 40 drops of Olive Leaf three 
 times a day. It may take two or three bottles to clear this out of 
 the system, but it will and it does! This includes Shingles too. I recommend Olive Leaf first and then I go after whatever else is left, if 
 anything at all!&quot;--Judith Lorraine, Denver, CO

&quot;I had a mother come to me for help with her seven year 
 old son who was showing signs of compulsive behavior. He was 
 changing his clothes up to seven times before going to school and 
 constantly washing his hands. I suggested she try S.M.F.-B, Gotu 
 Kola, and Five Good. They noticed a difference right away. When they ran out of his herbs he started going back to his behavior 
 again. As soon as they put him back on the herbs he showed signs of 
 improvement again. Also, I have seen these herbs work on children 
 who have trouble concentrating in school.&quot;--Geneva Gile, Irasburg, VT  

&quot;After already seven years of success with herbs, 
 regarding seasonal allergies with children, I was very excited to try Pure 
 Herbs A.E.A.-B. My oldest daughter had developed bronchitits in the 
 Fall when allergies and molds were holding up in between frosts. This cough reoccurred in January with frigid temperatures and 
 artificial home heat. I knew Spring pollen would be a bother for her 
 cough. Naturally, after two weeks of A.E.A.-B she hasn&apos;t developed 
 the cough and has only minor phlegm from early pollens. The best 
 news is that she isn&apos;t on Zyrtec daily anymore, which was prescribed after 
 Claritin wasn&apos;t helping (both of these are prescription drugs). Thank you Pure Herbs!&quot;--Sally Twill, Summit, NJ  

&quot;When our daughter was just six weeks old, our 
 pediatrician decided to administer the vaccines recommended for children 
 at two months, which are five different shots! We were nervous about 
 this and only let them give her three shots with the understanding we 
 would come back in a week for the other two. Needless to say, our 
 daughter had a terrible reaction and almost choked to death! We did 
 not take her back for any more shots! After researching vaccines, we 
 have discovered that contrary to what the medical profession advocates, 
 vaccines actually damage our children&apos;s developing immune systems, making 
 our children their patients for life. We immediately consulted with 
 Bella Vladimirsky (she contacted Dr. Watkins) and both recommended we try 
 IMS-W, rubbing a few drops on our daughter&apos;s feet three times a day to 
 strengthen her immune system. We also are using Alfalfa&amp;Vita-Lixer 
 on the soles of her feet in the same manner. I am thrilled to tell 
 you that our daughter is now almost eight months old and thriving! While all the other infants we know have been sick constantly with 
 respiratory illnesses and chronic ear infections, (which also are caused 
 by vaccines), our daughter has not been sick with anything, with the 
 exception of her vaccine reaction. Most states allow for religious 
 exemption against vaccinations, and we have claimed this in our daughter&apos;s 
 case. We strongly urge all parents to research vaccines. We 
 think they will discover that Pure Herbs, Ltd. offers better health 
 benefits for their children than any drug in the medical world. Our 
 Creator has given us these natural gifts and we should use them, 
 especially for our most precious blessings, our children.&quot;&quot;I used to 
 suffer with arthritis in my knees. I began taking Ephedra as a means 
 to control my appetite (which works excellently) . It never occurred 
 to me that the herb was actually healing my arthritis as well. A few 
 months back we had a rain spell that lasted five days. Normally 
 under these conditions, I am sore and miserable. I didn&apos;t even 
 notice that I wasn&apos;t suffering any more . . . My husband did! He 
 asked &apos;did you notice that you haven&apos;t been hurting in a while?&apos; No, 
 I hadn&apos;t. I just knew that I felt great and pain free, and I haven&apos;t 
 had any pain, swelling or discomfort since! I take Ephedra every day 
 three times a day and it works!&quot;--Khadija Abdur-Rahmaan, Detroit, MI  

&quot;For the past 10 years I have used and carried in my 
 purse, Indian Tobacco. It certainly came in handy when I was out to 
 dinner with a friend. At the end of her meal my friend ate a cookie. A few of the crumbs started irritating her throat and she immediately went 
 into a coughing and wheezing spasm. She was red in the face and 
 unable to stop the cough. I told her to relax and placed 2 drops of 
 Indian Tobacco on her tongue. Slight relief followed. I put 
 one more drop under the tongue and suddenly after a moment passed the 
 spasm stopped. She then was ready for a few sips of water and 
 blessed relief. My friend exclaimed, &apos;This is a miracle, what did 
 you use!!?&apos; I told her it was Indian Tobacco also know as Lobelia. I never leave home without it. Note: I used my best judgement and 
 knew my friend was not in danger of choking. It was more of an 
 irritation from the cookie crumbs than anything. I had experienced a 
 similar type of cough irritation from food once. Pure Herbs are pure 
 and wonderful.&quot;--Sheila Kaplowitz, Henderson, NC  

&quot;I would like to share a testimonial on SI.-W and 
 ACS as a nasal spray. Nine eyedroppers of SI.-W and two eyedroppers 
 of ACS and fill the rest of a one ounce bottle with distilled water. Put in a nasal sprayer and use as often as needed.&quot;--Jean Kinnett, 
 Lawrenceburg, IN

&quot;Client reports after taking: Echinacea, 
 Goldenseal, and Oregon Grape on a regular basis that growth at left side 
 of neck and off-and-on severe pain are gone completely. She stays on 
 the supplements for maintenance.&quot;--Esther Miesel, C.N.H.P., Wyoming, MI

&quot;Pure Herbs products have helped me gain my health 
 back. I used to be dependent on antibiotics due to having so many 
 respiratory throat and ear infections. I also have diabetes that was 
 out of control. After some good cleansing herbs, diet and herbs to 
 help with my infections and prevention of my diabetes from advancing I 
 have felt great! Now I have more energy and I only get sick once a 
 year instead of every two weeks or every month. Hopefully soon I 
 will never get sick. My blood sugar is now normal. Thank you 
 Pure Herbs for all your help. Also, thank you Ella Faye Holder who 
 taught me all about herbal remedies and care.&quot;--Terry Arellano, San 
 Diego, CA

&quot;I am 37 years old and have always had female trouble. The doctors answer was hormones, which I didn&apos;t like the side affects.  The gynecologist answer was a hysterectomy. Thanks to Pure Herbs 
 and an herbalist at Country Herbs in Crothersville, I now have regular 
 cycles, with no cramping or flooding. What a blessing after 26 years 
 of suffering. I take Wild Yam and P.M.S.-W regularly and Crampbark&amp;False Unicorn when needed for cramps. I also recommend going to 
 someone who has a muscle response monitor or to an Iridologist. My son was 
 8 years old when he got out of bed to tell me it felt like something was 
 stuck in his throat. Our doctor put him on Pepsid A.C. because he 
 thought he had an ulcer. He had lost so much weight because he 
 couldn&apos;t swallow. He would cry every time I gave him the Pepsid A.C. So the doctor sent him to a specialist who ran a light down his throat and 
 removed a small cyst which was benign. I was praying several times a 
 day to help me find some way to help my son. I was sent to Country 
 Herbs and Pure Herbs. I am so grateful, especially for Pure Herbs. When he couldn&apos;t swallow capsules and opening them and putting them in 
 pudding was stressing him and me out, the extracts worked wonderfully. T.-W worked wonders on his thyroid, which was why he couldn&apos;t swallow. Pure Herbs, Ltd. has helped my family in so many ways. Especially 
 when I was having anxiety attacks. My doctor told me to go home and 
 go to bed. What was I supposed to do? Stay in bed the rest of 
 my life! God put these herbs on earth for a reason, so why not use 
 them instead of lining the pharmaceuticals pockets and having all the side 
 effects.&quot;--Ramona Cundiff

&quot;Early in 1992 my husband Charles had a stroke that 
 left the left hand and arm quite weak. The doctor did an ultra-sound 
 and determined there was an almost closed artery in his shoulder. The doctor put him on blood thinners which made him cold all the time. It was recommended that I use O.C.M. and that would dissolve what was 
 blocking the arteries and pass it out of the system without stopping any 
 place else. Charles took O.C.M. three times a day and we also 
 applied some to the area where the main blockage was supposed to be. At night I put a dressing over the area and covered it with a plastic wrap 
 to help it penetrate. In the weeks that Charles was going back for 
 physical therapy the doctor did another ultra-sound and found the blood 
 flow had increased to just about normal. He started to say something 
 about the blood thinner when I told him Charles hadn&apos;t taken the thinners 
 because they made him cold and tired. I told the doctor about O.C.M. and 
 he became very upset and told me I don&apos;t care what you&apos;re doing, but you 
 might as well keep it up. That was the last time we went there! In 1999, I was talking to my son, John, in North Carolina. John 
 calls himself a company representative, I call him a traveling salesman. 
 He was complaining his legs were giving him trouble, the veins were 
 swelling, popping out, and very painful. The doctor was going to 
 give him pain pills to try (didn&apos;t guarantee anything) and also a blood 
 thinner. I reminded him about the O.C.M. his father took. I 
 sent him a 4oz. size. He would not take it orally, but only applied 
 it to the affected areas on his legs. He rubbed it on his legs in an 
 upward motion and put the dressing on at night. Unfortunately, John 
 wouldn&apos;t stay off of his feet. After about two weeks his legs did 
 feel better though. In June John had a heart attack and needed a 
 triple by-pass. Guess where they got the veins good enough to use 
 for his heart? Right - the very legs he couldn&apos;t stand on a few 
 months before. If he had taken O.C.M. orally, I don&apos;t think he 
 would&apos;ve had the heart attack, but then he would still be smoking. Oh well, he&apos;s fine now thanks to Dr. Watkins and O.C.M.&quot;--Virginia Dodge, 
 Eastpointe, MI

&quot;I would like to share an 
 incident that changed my life. I had a recurring fever blister on my 
 lips for 22 years. For a while, it broke out every change of season 
 and when I was stressed out. Then, after about 10 years, the 
 outbreaks became more frequent. Once, I was very stressed and the 
 whole side of my face broke out. This was very embarrassing. In 1994, I began to take Broad Beans from Pure Herbs for several months. Then, I did the Oral Chelation (O.C.M.) that Dr. Watkins recommends with 
 All Cell Salts for about three or four times a day. He is right. You do get very good at estimating the amount. Anyway, I could smell 
 the toxins coming out of my body and began to feel better, in general, and 
 a lot more peaceful. About 6 months later, I noticed I wasn&apos;t 
 getting the fever blisters anymore. To this day, I rarely ever get 
 one and if I do they go away within a few days (stay off of chocolate and 
 all forms of caffeine at first sign of outbreak). Jesus Christ is the 
 ultimate healer. Thank you, Pure Herbs, for making the herbs 
 available and Dr. Watkins for writing the books that offer such wonderful 
 advice.&quot;

--Anonymous, Carmel, IN

Correction to the testimonial 
 from Anonymous (above). &quot;It was not O.C.M. that was taken and caused reoccurring fever blisters to go away. It was actually A.C.S. (All 
 Cells Salts) which caused the &apos;oral chelation&apos; to occur and help get rid 
 of the reoccurring fever blisters.&quot; Please make note of this 
 correction.   &quot;Here at my dog training center, I make use 
 of Pure Herb remedies for my canine friends. The veterinarians send 
 me dog clients with behavioral issues. Starting out with one of the 
 Universal Emotional Remedies (UER) addresses the emotional aspect of the 
 problem and works well. I have also had great success with Bee 
 Propolis for healing, especially the pads of the feet. Arnica is a 
 must for all my students to have on hand. I recommend it before and 
 after surgery especially. Oil of Cajeput works great to heal sores 
 that dogs keep after. The odor deters licking.&quot;

&quot;I don&apos;t know where to begin. If I were to tell you all the wonderful benefits of your high quality 
 herbal extracts, your fax machine would be tied up for a long time! I just want to relate my most recent miracle. I danced on pointe for 
 nineteen years and did considerable damage to my toe joints. In 
 addition, I was disabled for four years due to status asthmaticus 
 (essentially an asthma attack that lasted for four years) and was 
 taking up to 120 mg. of prednisone daily. If my joints were not 
 completely destroyed by the dancing, the prednisone finished them off! I have taken Hydrangea in capsule form for some time with great benefit 
 since it is very effective in releasing excess acids from the system. Acids contribute to joint destruction and PAIN. I wanted to soak my 
 feet in hydrangea, but who can make the time to sit for 10 or 15 minutes, 
 not doing anything else? Well, I decide to soak my feel while I 
 shower! I close the drain in the tub and let the water fill while I 
 take my usual shower. I add liquid hydrangea extract to the water, 
 thereby giving myself a foot soak without changing anything in my daily 
 routine. I expected relief of the stabbing pain in my toe joints 
 after a few weeks. To my surprise, I got relief immediately. And more, I actually had relief of the burning pain in my hips as well, 
 even without sitting in the tub! This would not be possible without 
 the highest potency and quality of Hydrangea that we are blessed to 
 receive from Pure Herbs, Ltd. Thank you from the tips of my toes! 
 (and my heart).&quot;

&quot;After being diagnosed with a 
 severe case of osteoarthritis in my right hip during March of 2000, I knew 
 I would have to be pro-active in dealing with this serious situation. Being a believer in alternative methods, I tried Glucosamine, Chondroitin, 
 MSM, Sam-e, and vitamin and mineral supplementation. In March of 
 2001, I added CA.-W 80 drops three times per day. After several 
 months I dropped back to 40 drops three times per day. Beginning in 
 March of 2001, I had complemented my treatment plan with visits to an 
 osteopathic physician. These visits helped with range of motion and 
 some pain reduction. In April of 2001, I added 40 drops of Irish 
 Moss three times per day, after meals. After six to eight weeks, I 
 noticed improvement in the pain level in my hip. No other treatments 
 had been used during that time. Most of my pain reduction, I 
 noticed, came after taking the Irish Moss. To date, I have been able 
 to prevent a total hip replacement.&quot;
