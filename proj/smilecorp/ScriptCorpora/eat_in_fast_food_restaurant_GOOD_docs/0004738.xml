 Two player mode 

  PlayStation2   Successfully complete the Burning Desire mission where
you rescue Denise. A red two player free roam icon will now appear
on Denise&apos;s porch near the door. The icon will appear there when
she is home and will go on a date. Stand on the icon and press Start on controller two to activate the icon. Note: If
both enter a car, the passenger will have free aim with a machine
gun.

Note: Do not try to kill Denise, as you will never be able to
date her again or play in two-player mode at her house.


Once you get your girlfriend, take her on a date. After you drop
her off, there will be a rotating icon of two people directly
in front of the door. Walk into it. It will tell you to push any
button on the controller two. Do so to start two player mode,
involving CJ and his girlfriend in a free roam.


For more fun in two player mode, start the two player mission.
Then, enable the&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;code and press Triangle to remove the Jetpack. Then, have player two get the Jetpack.
Enable the Jetpack code again, then have player one get it. Both
players can now fly around and do the two player missions this
way.

and Hydra will be delivered to CJ&apos;s house on Grove Street.

 
 Increase muscle or stamina 

At about 22:00, go to a gym and work out, maxing yourself.
After you have worked out enough for the day, wait another minute
until the time is 0:00. Max yourself out for that day then go
home. Save two or three times and you can repeat this process.


To get your character maxed out in the muscle and stamina attributes,
do the following. Go the gym near the Johnson house. Work out
until you are told that it is enough for one day. Go home (right
down the block), save the game to advance to the next day. Return
to the gym and you can work out again. You can now max out your
muscle and stamina in less then a half hour.


  PlayStation2   Note: This trick requires a controller with a turbo feature. Go
to a gym or Madd Dogg&apos;s mansion. Get on the treadmill and set
it to level 7, 8, or 9. Enable the turbo feature and just hold X instead of tapping it. Your stamina will increase easily.
You can also do this with weights, but you will have to tap Circle and X a little bit.

 
 Increase bike skill 

  PlayStation2   Enable the&quot;Massive bunny hops&quot;code. Keep
jumping very high by holding L1 for a long time. As you
jump, do some flips (backwards or any funny stunt) and land perfectly.
You will then receive a unique stunt award or an insane stunt
award and your skill will increase. To do this perfectly without
falling while doing the stunts, use the&quot;Never fall off your
bike&quot;glitch. Get some speed, jump as high as possible, do
stunts, and do not fall. This will increase CJ&apos;s bike skill.

 
 Increase driving skill 

Go to San Fierro and pass the tests at the driving
school.

Find a tractor or a slow moving car. Drive the roads without going
as fast as you can (move slowly). This will take awhile, but will
increase your driving skills.

 
 Increase underwater skill 

Repeatedly swim underwater to increase your lung capacity
and your underwater skill.
 
 Increase weapon skill 

Achieve a high wanted level and go into a restaurant.
Shoot everyone with the weapon that you want to raise in rank.
If you walk around and wait, police will spawn, but will not shoot
you. Police can raise your weapon skill faster than pedestrians.
This works best in Burger Shot because of the wide area that you
can walk around in. Continue until you reach Hitman status.


Use the following trick in front of any safe house. Use the gun
you want to get up to Hitman status to repeatedly shoot a car
until it explodes. Then, go to the next car. Repeat this until
you reach Hitman status for that weapon. Watch out for the police.
You can shoot them, then keep shooting the cars. When you are
almost dead, enter your safe house and save the game. Your health
will be restored and wanted level removed.


To attain Hitman level quicker, select your desired weapon and
go to a Pay &apos;N&apos; Spray. Park your vehicle directly next to the
Pay &apos;N&apos; Spray. Exit the vehicle and repeatedly shoot people, cars,
and cops. When your wanted level is raised to two stars or above,
run to your vehicle and drive into the Pay &apos;N&apos; Spray to cancel
it. If your vehicle is not damaged, the respray is free. Wait
for the wanted stars to stop flashing, then start shooting people
again.


Get lots of bullets for the guns that you want Hitman or Gangster
status for. Go to Tierra Robada. Look around at the north of the
island to find a little house. Stay in there and enable the&quot;Increase
wanted level&quot;code three times. Stay in the cabin and wait
for the police to approach. When they enter the house, kill them.


Go into a police station and find a room with one entry point,
and something that you can hide behind (like a desk). Take out
your weapon. You should now have a two star wanted level. Shoot
any cop who comes through the door. Every cop you shoot makes
your gun skill go up by about five. Do this until you either die,
run out of bullets, or enable the&quot;Lower wanted level&quot;code.

 
 Easy Pilot license 

Go to the airport in San Fierro and enable the&quot;Spawn
Jetpack&quot;code. Enter the Shamel jet and enable the&quot;Speed
up time&quot;code. Fly it until a message appears in the corner.
Fly it for about five or ten more minutes and you will have a
pilot license without going to pilot school. Note: Make sure you
save the game.
 
 Pass license tests easily 

Repeatedly fail the License Tests. Eventually Goya
will allow you to pass the tests anyway, due to your enthusiasm.

 
 Lose weight quickly 

If you want to lose weight quickly, enable the&quot;Speed
up time&quot;code.

 
 Stay underwater forever 

Dive underwater, and once your breath is out, you will
start losing health. If you want to stay underwater, keep enabling
the&quot;Armor, health, money, and street creds&quot;code when
your health is low. You will be able to remain underwater, and
max your Lung Capacity attribute easily.


Jump into deep water. Swim underwater to a decent depth. While
underwater, enable the&quot;Maximum lung capacity&quot;code.
You will notice that your lung capacity is full and will stay
full. This may require a few attempts. Try driving a Rhino tank
into the water and wait for it to sink to the bottom. You can
drive the tank and even shoot the boats that are on top of the
water.

 
 Restore breath faster 

When you are swimming and are about to run out of breath,
return to the surface. Keep jumping up and down with Square .
Your breath meter will refill faster.

 
 Raising stats quicker 

Go to any pier over any body of water. Swim under the
pier and stay in one position. This will immensely raise your
muscle, stamina, and lung capacity in just under a minute. Stay
under longer for better results.

 
 Survive high falls 

Max out your health bar and get full armor. Go to a
high building, such as the one in the Downtown area of Los Santos.
Get on the roof and jump off without a parachute in your inventory.
When you hit the ground, you will lose most of your life, but
still have a small amount remaining. Note: If you have a parachute
in your inventory, you will die when you hit the ground.


  PlayStation2   Repeatedly tap Square as CJ is falling to take less damage
when he hits the ground.

  PlayStation2   If you accidentally fall off a very high building, enable the&quot;Spawn parachute&quot;code. Press Circle to pop the
parachute and you will drift safely down to the ground.

 Return to land faster 

If you get stuck in the water, enable the&quot;Spawn
Hotring Racer&quot;then&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;codes. It will
not appear until you are on a non watery surface. Quickly jump
on the car. It may be a far ride, but it is better than swimming.

 
 Unlimited running boost 

  PlayStation2   Enable the&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;code. When you
have Jetpack on, take it off. Then, get about thirty feet behind
it so you have running distance. Run into it by using the running
boost (hold Left Analog-stick Up and keep tapping X ).
Just before you run into the Jetpack, release X and keep
the Left Analog-stick in running position. This will give
you unlimited running boost until the Left Analog-stick is released.

 
 Run faster 

To run faster, enable the&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;  PlayStation2   code. Then, hold X while pressing the Left Analog-stick Forward . If done correctly, CJ will run faster than any car. 

 
 Descend quickly 

When stuck at the top of a cliff or a mountain and
you need to go to the bottom, do not bother going the long way
around to get down safely. Instead, edge yourself to the end of
the cliff/ mountain and slowly but surely you will slide down
the side and land safely at the bottom.

 
 Reload instantly 

  PlayStation2   When you need to reload quickly press L2 then R2 or vice versa just before CJ runs out of ammo.

 
 Skydiving 

  PlayStation2   Go to any airport. Look for a yellow arrow at the entrances
of the airport where you can buy a ticket to another city. Buy
the ticket and start the flight. Do not press X and skip
the flight. Wait for the airplane to take off and get high in
the air. Press Triangle and CJ will jump out of the airplane
with a parachute and begin skydiving. When you want to open the
parachute, press Circle and float down. There are also
other places you can skydive, such as the tall building in the
Downtown area Los Santos, and off the top of Mount Chiliad. &quot;&gt; (Screenshot) 


To get a parachute very easily, get into any type of flying vehicle,
except the Jetpack. You will instantly receive a parachute. If
you fly high into the air, then jump out of your plane or helicopter,
the parachute will automatically be switched into your weapon
inventory.

 
 Skydive longer 

Enable the&quot;Cars fly away&quot;code. Go to any
airport and hit any aircraft. Then, enter that craft. All you
have to do is steer. Soon the height meter will just stay up.
You will get to fly higher than normal when you do this. Fly as
high as you desired, then Jump out for a long trip back to earth.
hotwing3.

Enable the&quot;Flying cars&quot;and&quot;Cars fly away&quot;codes. Lightly tap a car to put it in the air . Quickly get out
of your car and into the one that is in the air. Then, accelerate
and you can drive as high as desired without stalling. While driving
up, enable the&quot;Spawn parachute&quot;code. Fly all the way
to the game&apos;s ceiling and jump out. You can do air tricks while
falling, like spinning around. It will be awhile until you even
begin to see the ground. Note: Sometimes while you are falling
and you open your parachute, a glitch will occur and you will
not have any control over where the parachute goes -- you will
die when you hit the ground, as if you did not even open it.


Enable the&quot;Spawn Hunter&quot;,&quot;Spawn Parachute&quot;,
and&quot;Fast motion&quot;codes. Get in the Hunter and go as
high as it will go. With the&quot;Fast motion&quot;code, this
should only take about thirty seconds. When at the top limit,
enter the&quot;Fast motion&quot;code again to deactivate its
effect. Begin your jump, let the parachute out, and land.

 
 Unlock areas quickly 

Enable the&quot;Wanted level never increases&quot;code. Go to the shaded areas of the game and they will become
unlocked. If you go to a safe house and save the game, all areas
will be unlocked from now on. However, in order not to be wanted
when you go back into these areas, you must enable the&quot;Wanted
level never increases&quot;code again, but you will be free to
roam about.

 
 Basketball Challenge mini-game 

Go to one of the basketball courts that have full courts
and a chain link fence round them. One of the hoops will have
a basketball. Walk up to the basketball and press Triangle to start playing. While playing basketball, press R3 to
start the Basketball Challenge mini-game. A red marker will appear
on the court. Run to the red marker and shoot the ball. If you
make the shot, the red marker will move to a new spot on the court.
The goal of the mini-game is to sink as many shots as you can
before time runs out. Each shot you make adds a few seconds on
to the clock. When time runs out, CJ will automatically resume
playing basketball. Your highest score will recorded and shown
the next time you play the Basketball Challenge mini-game.

 
 Basketball tricks 

  PlayStation2   While playing basketball, press Circle to spin the ball on your finger. Press Square to roll the ball along your shoulders.


You can make CJ dunk over cars, trucks, vans by spotting any of the vehicles on a basketball court, just by any goal. Run, then dunk the ball. He will jump over the vehicle you placed.

 
 Dual weapons 

Reach the&quot;Hitman&quot;rank in a weapon skill
to be able to wield two of that weapon at once. To increase your
weapon skill, practice at the shooting range or use that weapon
frequently. You can dual wield pistols, the sawed off shotgun,
Uzi, and Tek.
 
 Double SMG ammunition 

  PlayStation2   Go into an Ammu-Nation and enter the shooting range.
Press Triangle as soon as it starts to exit the shooting
range. If you were carrying an SMG at the time, your ammunition
will have doubled. Repeat this trick to get as much as needed.

 
 Easy shotgun 

Find a police car. Force the cop out of his car, then
punch him until he dies and pick up his 9mm and nightstick. Get
into his car and drive about one block. Get out, and you should
have a regular shotgun and between 3 and 10 shells to fire. Note:
It is recommended that you do this near your homies so that the
Ballas will not kill you within the first few seconds.

 
 Easy weapons 

If you punch a prostitute, she may pull out a weapon in order to fight you, which is typically either a knife or a 9mm pistol. When you kill her, you can take her knife or pistol as well as her money. If you kill the prostitute without punching her, you will just get her money and no weapons.

 
 Quick reload 

When you are short on time (for example during the gang wars), you can quickly reload by switching to another weapon. Your ammunition must be 1 to 30. When at 0 it automatically does the longer reload.

 
 Infrared goggles 

To get the infrared goggles, complete the storyline
missions. They will be available in front of the car under the
Big Ear, in the rear right corner of Zero&apos;s RC shop, and in the
low security tower in Area 69.
and
 
 Nightvision goggles 

To get the nightvision goggles, complete all parts
of Breaking The Bank at Caligulas. The goggles can then be found
in Madd Dogg&apos;s crib and at the southern-most point of San Fierro,
southwest of the airport near the entrance to the building that
appears to be blue with white circles by it on the map.

 
 Stand over wheels 

Get a or spawn Bloodring Racer. Then, enable the&quot;Invisible
cars&quot;code followed by the&quot;All cars have nitrous&quot;code. Get in the car and enable the&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;code. Go up in the air with the car and press Triangle .
It will appear as if CJ is standing over some wheels. Note: Also
try this with the Rhino tank.

 
 Suicide bomber 

Enable the&quot;Weapon tier 3&quot;code and then
select the bombs which are blown up by a detonator. Throw one
of them at someone, and it should stick to them. You can now blow
them up like a suicide bomber.

 
 Cheap car bomb 

Get a fast car or a motorcycle. Either shoot the vehicle
or bang it up real good. When it is on fire, press Triangle to jump out. This technique is also good for taking over hoods
quickly and easily.

 
 Bike bombing 

Get a bicycle (BMX, mountain bike, etc.) and attach
as many satchels as desired to it. Select the detonator switch
form your inventory. Get on the bike and ride very fast towards
a group of gang members or other target. While the bike is moving,
jump off. The bike should continue towards the target. Once it
gets there, blow it up. After any fires have gone out or any other
dangers to CJ&apos;s health is gone, get back on the bike. Because
the bike does not have a gas tank, engine, etc., it can be used
numerous times as a bike bomb.
 
 Reaching other cities early 

Hijack the train. The easiest is when it is at one
of the stations. Then, drive it full speed to the bridges to the
other islands. You may need to use the entire city to pick up
enough speed. Also, you must be careful around sharp turns. The
train will de-rail. Note: This was done with the freight train.
When you approach the bridge at the edge of the city, you will
slow down, even if you are going very fast. The train will pass
through the barricade, as if it were a ghost. You will get a four
star wanted level. There is a police bribe on the train tracks
in the second city that you will pick up if you pass by it on
the train, but your wanted level will immediately jump back to
four stars. Also, the train is bullet proof. You cannot die from
bullets when inside the train.


  PlayStation2   The following is a multi-step process which may take some time
to get correct. Get the parachute located on top of the very tall
building a few blocks from the police station in downtown Los
Santos. The building is shaped circular inside and&quot;L&quot;shaped on your map. Walk around to the northeast corner of the
circular building and step into the yellow triangle to get the
parachute that is on the roof. Take it, and keep it (do not switch
to a weapon). Go back down and get armor from the police station.
It is nearby and has two sets. Do not draw a weapon in the station
or you will get a two star wanted level. Next, get the jet at
LSX, the airport at Los Santos. Drive up to the gate, climb up
on your car, and onto the guard booth, and climb over into the
airport. Walk back around to the gate. It will open, and you can
get your car and drive back in. Then, find the jet. It is called
the Shamal and is located at the end of the runway. Take off and
get some practice flying, diving, climbing, rolling, etc. Next,
choose a location on your map that you want to go. You can press Circle on the map screen to pin that location on the radar.
For example, choose the Binco store in Las Venturas. It is next
to the Las Venturas airport and the highway. Once you pass the
city line, you will get four stars on your wanted meter. Because
you are in the air, they will try to shoot you down with missiles.
Notice the two red blips on your radar that are fast approaching.
Dive, climb, and roll and the missiles will miss. Do not forget
to keep your eye on your target. Once you are over your target
and are very high, press Triangle to exit the plane. You
will drop straight down. You must be high enough for your parachute
to open or you die when you hit the ground. When you are safely
on the ground, start running. If you chose to go to Binco or another
store, notice that you can go inside and buy clothes. If you buy
clothes, you will get rid of the four stars wanted level, as long
as you remain in the store. Once you step outside, the four stars
will return to your wanted meter.


Enable the&quot;Drive on water&quot;code or swim across the
ocean to where you want to go. You will automatically get a four
star wanted level when coming ashore in Las Ventruas and a five
star wanted level for coming ashore in San Fierro. These stars
will not go away with the&quot;Lower wanted level&quot;code,
but will disappear when you leave the city.
Allen
Gaiownik.

When in Los Santos, you will find that all bridges to the other
two regions will be blocked by blockades. Sometimes if you try
to go through the blockade at high speed with a fast vehicle,
it will go through and glitch, along with the AI vehicles that
are following.


Enable the&quot;Wanted level never increases&quot;and&quot;Flying
car&quot;codes. You can now go to all of San Andreas without
that four star wanted level appearing. Note: This will have to
be done again every time you load a saved game. Also, if you shoot
cops with the&quot;Wanted level never increases&quot;code enabled,
some cops will get out and walk away but others will fire their
guns at you.

 Stealth kills 

  PlayStation2   With a knife, target a person and sneak up behind them.
Press Circle , and if they do not notice you, you will perform
an instant kill silently.

 
 Manual aim with any weapon while driving 

Enable the&quot;Manual weapon drive bys in cars&quot;code and run out of bullets in your Uzi, Tec-9, or Micro SMG.
Get out of your vehicle, then select the weapon of your choice
(except grenades and rocket launchers). Get back into the vehicle
and enable any&quot;Weapons&quot;code. The crosshairs are back
on and you can shoot that weapon.

 
 Keep weapons when dying 

When the screen turns black after you are killed, quickly
enable a&quot;Weapons&quot;code before you reappear in front
of a hospital. You will have the same weapons as before your death.
 
 Shoot rockets 

If you are having trouble with people who fire with
rocket launchers (for example, the man on the roof in the Los
Desperados mission), try to shoot their rockets to protect yourself,
especially when you are sticking near a wall where the blast radius
is still near you. Use a shotgun, Desert Eagle or a combat shotgun
to take out the rockets easier. Note: This is exceptionally easier
at night, where rockets light up and can easily be seen. However,
rockets are exceptionally fast.

 
 Destroying cars quickly 

To quickly blow up cars, shoot the gas tank. This is
useful when killing a lot of people at once.

 
 Destroying helicopters 

If you have three stars or more and are under attack
by a helicopter, you can score a one hit kill against it with
a sniper rifle. If it is night time, the helicopter will shine
a bright flood light in your eyes. However, if you zoom in with
the rifle it will disappear. To take it down in one hit shoot
the helicopter in the small spinning object under the rotors,
or close to the base of the object. It will crash just as if you
had killed it with a rifle. It is easier to shoot them if you
are on top of a high building.


  PlayStation2   When you have one or more police helicopters after you, take out
your satchel charges. Spawn a Jetpack, then fly up into the air.
Land on one of the helicopters. Press Triangle and get
rid of your jetpack. Stick a bomb to the top of the helicopter.
Then, jump off. Note: Having full health is necessary to survive.
Detonate the bomb, and watch the helicopter explode. Sometimes,
the helicopter that is exploding will take the other with it.

 
 Car surfing 

Hop on top of a car and fire your gun. When you fire any gun, all the drivers around you will start driving wildly to escape you, including the car that you are standing on. It feels like as if you are on a roller coaster. Try it on the highway, and try to pick off the cars around you. For even more fun, try this game with the&quot;Flying cars&quot;,&quot;Sports car traffic&quot;, or&quot;Carnival theme&quot;codes enabled.

 
 More time to steal cars 

Hijack a car. If the person you hijacked it from gets up and gets to the car quickly, and you do not think you can get away, trigger the horn of the car. When this is done, the person will stop and wave at you. This will give you some extra time to get away.

 
 Play pool for free 

First, enter a bar, such as&quot;The Green Bottle&quot;in the Ganton area of Los Santos. Find a pool table and wager
whatever desired. If you lose the game, just use the cue stick
to hit the person who just took your money to death. Then, pick
the money he drops, which may be slightly more than your bet.
,
,
and

  PlayStation2   When you walk in the bar, either play a game of pool or just kill
the man standing there and take his pool stick. Square up with
the pool table and start pressing Circle . The pool balls
should move. If not, then square yourself with the pool table.

 
 Free pool shots 

  PlayStation2   When playing pool you can get a free shot by pressing Triangle as you take your shot and hit the ball. If done
correctly, you should hit the ball and your cue should follow
your white ball like if you had never taken your shot. If you
pot the white ball by doing this, it freezes your game. Simply
press Triangle as you press the Right Analog-stick Forward and you will get an extra shot every time.

 
 Hit pedestrian with the front of your shotgun 

  PlayStation2   Note: This cannot be done with more than two weapons.
Get a melee weapon (baseball bat, dildo, or a police nightstick
and an ordinary shotgun. If you have more than those two weapons
then this trick cannot be done. Switch to your melee weapon. Walk
up to a pedestrian and hit them then immediately press Circle to switch to your shotgun. If done correctly, CJ should hit the
pedestrian with the shotgun as if he were using it as a melee
weapon.

 
 Recruiting gang members 

  PlayStation2   Press R1 to target a gang member, then press D-pad Up .
 
 Saving gang members 

To save a gang member or bodyguard when you turn off the game, go to your safe house. Go to your garage. Run in the garage with your bodyguards. Run out without your bodyguards, and then save the game.

 
 Make opposing gang members fight each other 

Enable the &quot;Spawn jet pack&quot; code. Go near a group of gang members and allow them to approach you. When they start hitting you, fly up a short distance. If your health is still going down, fly slightly higher then they will fight each other.

 
 Gang member drive-by 

  PlayStation2   Once you have a level one Respect upgrade, go to Grove
street and walk up to a gang member (dressed in green). Without
a gun equipped, hold R1 on a gang member and press D-pad Up . You have now recruited him into your own personal mini-gang. If you get into a car, they will follow you. If you get three
gang members and get in a four-door car, you can drive through
Balla territory and your homies will lean out of the car and shoot
at the Ballas who are driving by or standing around. They will
also attack anyone who could be a threat to you (for example,
the police). You can get only one gang member on the back of a
PCJ-600, and no gang members on a Rhino. Note: To tell your members
to stay, hold R1 and press D-pad Down . To tell them
to follow you, hold R1 and press D-pad Up .

 
 Keep gang territory easily 

If your gang turf is under attack, go to a save point
and save the game. When it is done saving, your turf will no longer
be under attack and it will still be yours.


  PlayStation2   When your hood is under attack, find a police car or motorcycle,
fire truck, ambulance, or taxi. Get in and press R3 to
start the vehicle&apos;s missions. Then, press R3 again to exit
and your hood will be safe.

 
 Taking over gang territories 

An easy way to take over territories is to find a high
place like a roof top. First, kill a few gang members to start
the war, then get onto a roof. When you are up there, they will
still shoot at you but will not have accurate aim and will miss
frequently.


It is recommended that the&quot;Air Strip&quot;missions be completed
first. To easily take over territories, go to the airstrip and
take the Jetpack. Go to any enemy territory and start a gang war
by killing some enemy gang members. Fly and land on any building
roof you can easily see incoming enemy gang members. Kill all
gang members from up there. By doing this, you can easily hold
all enemy territories. Be patient when killing gang members, and
try to stay inside the war zone. The distance between the airstrip
and enemy territories is long, but this is the easiest way to
quickly and safely hold enemy gang territories. All territories
can be held by using the Jetpack, but only one by one.


Go to another gang&apos;s territory. Kill some gang members until the&quot;You have provoked a gang war message appears. Get on the roof of a house and put down a large number of remote explosives.
When the other gang arrive to kill you, press the remote and it
should kill them. You must go through three rounds of the gang
to win the territory.
and Joshua Coyle.
 
 Gang member race 

You can do this trick in any race mission with the
checkered flag on your map. Bring a gang member with you. You
can even bring three if the race is with a four door car. Walk
into the red mission circle. Select a race and when it starts
and counts down, you will see your gang member spawn to the street
and walk towards your car. The races will start, and you must
wait a moment before he gets in your car.

 
 Gang member poses 

  PlayStation2   Get a camera and recruit one of your Grove Street members.
Hold R1 to look through the lens, and your gang member
will go in front of it and give a thumbs up or wave.

 
 Take a photo of yourself 

  PlayStation2   Have the camera active as your current weapon, then
target a member of your own gang. Press L1 to give them
the camera and they will snap a picture of CJ.

  PlayStation2   Have the camera and recruit a gang member. Switch to the camera
and get close to the gang member you just recruited. There will
be a menu pop up on the top left, telling you to press L1 .
After you press L1 , get into place and take the picture.


Go to your wardrobe and zoom in on the mirror. You can take your
own picture. You can also see that you hold the camera as if it
were a gun.

 
 Climbing trees 

To climb a tree, find a ledge that will allow you to
jump to the branches at the top of a tree. If you hit them correctly,
CJ should grab onto the branches and allow you to pull him up.
There is an easily accessible one just outside of Glen Park Hospital
to practice with.


  PlayStation2   Stand in front of a small tree and press Square to jump
up. This trick will help you hide from the cops and enemy gang
members.

 
 Breaking fences 

Walk up to a fence and either punch it or cut it with
a chainsaw.

 
 Stop climbing fence or ledge 

To stop climbing a fence or ledge, tap Triangle while CJ is trying to get over.

 
 Expand and shrink moon 

Use a sniper rifle to shoot the moon to make it expand,
then shrink in size.
Byram

and
 
 Lock on enemies 

  PlayStation2   When fighting someone (not with gun), press R1 to lock on to them.

 
 Spray paint as a weapon 

The spray paint is not only is meant for spraying tags.
It also can be used as a weapon. Aim the spray paint in the direction
of a pedestrian and they will lean forward, coughing.

 
 Surrounded by prostitutes 

Enable the&quot;Kinky theme&quot;code just before
you land after buying a ticket to another airport. A number of
prostitutes with dildos will surround you.

 
 Effects of clothing 

CJ&apos;s clothes will change his dialogue. For example,
if you bought and wear clothes from the first-available stores
such as Binco, SubUrban etc, CJ will talk smack and swear a lot.
However, if you buy and wear clothes from a store like Didier
Sachs, Carl will say lines similar to&quot;I may be dressed well,
but I&apos;m still a maniac&quot;or&quot;I am a well-dressed maniac,
fool!&quot;when shooting people. Mix your styles of clothing
to get different and interesting results.

 
 Gain respect 

To gain respect, stay in your neighborhood and get
a wanted star, then kill all the police that arrives. Once you
reach a four star wanted level (and if you killed enough police),
you will gain some respect.


Completing missions is not the only way to earn respect. By spraying
other gang&apos;s tags, you will also earn a bit, and by taking over
another gang&apos;s area you will earn a lot. Note: You must have completed
some missions before you can take over areas. You can see on the
radar witch areas you have taken over, and which areas the enemy
gangs own. Your own territory is marked with green, and your enemies
are yellow or purple.

 
 Respect status 

Your respect is made up of the following factors:

 Running Respect (see below): 40% Mission Progress: 36% Territory Under Control: 6% Money: 6% Fitness: 4% Clothes: 4% Girlfriend Progress: 4% 
Your running respect is changed by the following factors:

 Killing a dealer: +.005% Killing a gang member: +.5% Killing a member of your gang: -.005% A member of your gang is killed: -2% Territory gained: +30% Territory lost: -3% 
Your respect affects the number of gang members that you can recruit:

 Above 1%: 2 Above 10%: 3 Above 20%: 4 Above 40%: 5 Above 60%: 6 Above 80%: 7 
 Easy money 

  PlayStation2   In order to waste time to allow money to accumulate
without dealing with CJs eating needs, simply press Triangle in front of the television in your hideout. His health will remain
constant, without him needing to eat. You can leave the PlayStation2
idling in this state to accumulate money easily.


Go to a strip club. Note: There is one just northeast from where you start the game. Once inside, make sure there is someone else standing at the stage looking at the stripper. He throws cash to the stripper every so often. You can pick up this cash by standing on the stage where he throws it. Each stack he throws will be $100. This is useful if you want to score free private dances. Note: Be careful not to disturb (bump into) the stripper, or the bouncers will shoot you.


Find a save point that is close to a betting shop. The one in
the Montgomery are is ideal because it is near to the save point
where you have to do the four missions for Catalina. Save your
game, then go to the betting shop and bet all your money on a
horse. It takes awhile to enter the numbers, but is worth it because
you can make a huge amount of cash (especially if you bet on horses
with odds of 10/1, 11/1, 12/1, etc.). It takes roughly three to
four minutes to bet the maximum amount of money, which is $9,999,995.
You will not win every time. When you lose, reload your last saved
game. It is possible to get $250,000,000 by betting your winnings
of $30,000 to $700,000 to $2,000,000 to the maximum bet.
,
, and

Save up until you have $2,000 or $3,000 then save the game at
CJ&apos;s house. Get to the Horse Betting Shop. (Screenshot) .
Place your bet on one horse and stick with that horse until you
win. Place all of your money there and when you win, the payoff
will be big. Keep doing this as needed.


You can get money by stealing a taxi.


Walk into a bar and beat up all the customers with a bat, nightstick,
or pool cue. More customers spawn and your wanted level will not
rise. No one pulls out a gun, and your maximum health will increase
after a number of fights. Beating up the person next to the pool
tables gets you a pool cue, and every once in awhile a customer
will spill a few hundred dollars.


Enable the&quot;Flying cars&quot;code. Fly around for a few
seconds then touch the ground. You will get money for insane stunts.


Enable the&quot;Vehicle of death&quot;and&quot;Flying cars&quot;code. When you are up in the air, fly down to the ground and hit
it to get money for a unique trick. The higher you go and hit
the ground, the more money you can make. You can also deactivate
the code while in the air and hit the ground to make a lot of
money.


  PlayStation2   While on a BMX bike, enable the&quot;Massive bunny hops&quot;code. put on the code mad hops. Then, hold L1 and jump.
While in the air, hold L1 and as soon as you hit the ground
release the button. Do this continuously to get big combos.


Enable the&quot;Kinky theme&quot;code and wait until you see
all the girls walking towards you. When they approach, enable
the&quot;Super punch&quot;code. Punch one of them to kill her
to get get money and a dildo.


  PlayStation2   Get a bike (BMX, mountain bike, etc.) and go to a money location
(for example,, the floating dollar sign at your home in Los Santos).
Pull up next to it and Super Bunny Hop by pressing L1 then
quickly pressing Circle . If it work the first time, then
try it two or three more times. Usually by the third time (if
not sooner) you will have acquired $5.


Steal a fire truck. Drive to a secluded area and do the firefighter
missions. Either finish the mission to receive about $40,000.
or get at least enough to purchase a safehouse near a horse betting
location, with some money left over to gamble. Save your game
with the money you earned and go to the betting place. Bet on
the horse with the worst odds (12:1, 11:1, etc.} with all the
money you have. If you win, you can turn $40,000 into $400,000
or more. The more money you bet, the more you will get back if
you win. If your horse does not win, reload your game and try
again. This will take some time, but one to two wins will give
you enough money for the rest of the game.

 
 Saving money 

Buy lots of ammunition for the Tec-9 which costs about
$300. When you have enough, buy one SMG. The game will transfer
all your Tec-9 ammunition into your SMG, saving you thousands
of dollars. Note: This does not work for the pistols, rifles,
or thrown weapons.

 
 Easy races 

Before a race, enable the&quot;Pedestrian riot&quot;code. The racers will start fighting with fans and you can finish
in first without even trying.


Use the following trick to easily win the race tournaments. Enable
the&quot;City in chaos&quot;and&quot;Bounty on your head&quot;codes. The racers will get out of their cars and try to shoot
you, or have a fight. You can drive around them and not have to
compete with any other racers. You will finish first in every
race unless you destroy yourself or your car, but people will
try to fight with you. This trick also works well with the 8-Track
mission and the Blood Bowl located in San Fierro (a demolition
derby with the Bloodring Banger). Do not use this trick on the
Chilliad Challenge as it will not work on that event.

 
 Easy chases 

During missions where you must chase someone and kill
them, before you start the mission enable the&quot;Cars fly away&quot;code. When you catch them, ram them. They will float up. Destroy
the car with a gun to complete the mission. This works most of
the time.

 
 Easy Hitman rating 

Shoot at the black part of a wheel. If you shoot at
the rim it will not work. Keep on shooting until the skill bar
is all the way up for the desired weapon.

 
 Easy dual sawn-off shotgun ability 

It is recommended that you spray all 100 tags, as it
is easier for ammunition and early on missions. Get a cop car
(preferably a car, OT truck, rancher, etc.). Save it in the Johnson
family garage. Save the game if desired. Get a large amount of
sawn-off shotgun ammunition. If all 100 tags were sprayed, it
is available in Johnson kitchen. Go to the garage. Get as far
away from the car as possible without letting the garage door
close. Then crouch, aim for the grill of the police car, and shoot.
Every few shots (or every time the car catches fire), you should
have more weapon skill. It will eventually upgrade about every
minute. When it catches on fire, let the garage repair the car
and come back. This does not work as well at getting Hitman on
the other weapons.

 
 Eating too much 

If you eat too much in a restaurant you will vomit
on the floor and the cashier will laugh at you. After this happens,
you cannot eat again for a while.

 
 Effects of being fat 

When you are fat, CJ will say different phrases. For
example, when you are fighting he will say&quot;I got weight
on my side,&quot;or&quot;I may be big, but I ain&apos;t slow&quot;.
The downside to being fat is that when your body fat meter gets
full, you run the risk of having a heart attack. This only happens
in very rare circumstances. You will return to the nearest hospital.
Also, if you have no muscle stat, or very little, you may not
be able to climb high walls or&quot;super sprint&quot;. When
fat, CJ will waddle around like a penguin, and if you look closely
(this happens with no shirt) the fat on his body will wobble.

 
 Vending machines 

When you find a vending machine that serves chips,
zoom in on it with a pistol or rifle. It is blurry, but you can
tell that the chips inside the machine are real-life brands. Some
chips that can be easily identified are Doritos, Lay&apos;s Potato
Chips, and Munchos, to name a few.

 
 Wanted level officers, weapons, and vehicles 

Depending on your wanted level, different law enforcement
vehicles, officers, and weapons will be used against you.

 One star: Police officers on foot, in cars, and HPV1000s (police bikes) will go after you. They have 9mms and nightsticks. If you do not have a gun out, they will try to beat you with their nightsticks. If you have a gun out, they will shoot. Two stars: Police officers in cars and HPV1000s will come after you. They will have 9mms and nightsticks, although they will not use their nightsticks. They will shoot at you no matter what. If you are in a car, cops will drive faster after you. Three stars: Police officers in cars will go after you. They will have the same weapons. Police choppers are now involved and shoot you from their guns. Police cars will go fast enough to be able to keep up with you and roadblocks will be in place at times, with officers shooting 9mms at your car. Four stars: Cops in cars and SWAT officers will come after you in Enforcers (SWAT vans). SWAT officers will now rappel from the police choppers. SWAT officers are now in roadblocks and SWAT officers will have Micro SMGs. If you are in an aircraft, a Hydra will go after you to shoot you down. Five stars: FBI agents will go after you with FBI Ranchers. Most authorities going after you will be the FBI; there will be less cop and SWAT cars. The police chopper still goes after you, and the FBI will replace the SWAT men in roadblocks. FBI agents carry SMGs. Six stars: Military soldiers will go after you in Rhinos (tanks) and Barracks trucks. They will replace the FBI in roadblocks. The army will carry M4s. 
 Floating breasts 

Start two player mode and choose the prostitute. Enable
the&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;code and turn the camera towards
her.

 
 Radio comments 


 After doing some Grove Street missions and seizing territory, one of the DJs on the radio will say&quot;Have you heard Grove Streets making a comeback? That&apos;s great news. hope they don&apos;t take me out just for playing this music.&quot; After the 555 We Tip mission, another DJ says&quot;Did you hear about that D.A. with the trunk full of drugs?

food restaurant. Have something to eat if you have not done so
already, then wait. Cause chaos and after awhile, equip the rifle

at their mouths. They are still chewing their food as if nothing
is happening.

in the past, so&quot;Gardening With Maurice&quot;is still on.


While listening to Area 53 with Marvin Trill on WCTR, a man will
call and talk about masticating and doing yoga with a garden hose.
You may recognize him as Reed Tucker, the yoga and tofu enthusiast
