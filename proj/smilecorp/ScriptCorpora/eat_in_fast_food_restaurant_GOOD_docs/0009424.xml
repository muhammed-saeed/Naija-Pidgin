Must have been a long day for the guy who served us who was somewhat grumpy and unhelpful. But the pizza selection was good, and the Mediterranean pizza we ordered was delicious. Good value as well. Tables and chairs available for those who want to eat in. Open seven days a week till late, and they deliver too.

This restaurant was recommended by the manager at Seadar Inn and it did not disappoint. Had a meatball calzone which was oozing with cheese and loaded with sliced meatballs. They deliver too!

My wife and I happened upon George&apos;s for two reasons: they advertised in the Harwich Mariners&apos;yearbook, and they were open after the game let out. The restaurant was doing quite a lot of business for a late Sunday night (take out, delivery and eat in) so we had to wait a bit for our pizza, but it was worth... More

We were hoping for something different based on the reviews. It was like Chicago-esque type crust. Thick crust that was very crunchy from having a pan full of oil. We were all expecting Jersey/NY type pizza.
That said, it was still pretty good, just not what we expected. Ingredients were fresh.

Such great pizza. Service is wonderful, just go right up to the counter when your number is called. Have been going here for 10 years and counting. The pizza is the perfect blend of sauce and cheese.
