Junk Food - why do we eat it?
 
Junk Food Addiction, why do we eat bad food?
 
Despite enjoying a plentiful supply of food in
the Western world, many of us eat extremely poor diets resulting in a variety
of health problems. Why are we choosing
foods which are bad for us?
 
Convenience
 
Many women’s lives have never been busier; working
full-time, often with a long commute, looking after the family and home, caring
for elderly relatives, the list goes on and time is in short supply.  Junk food; sugary, fatty and salty foods which
are high in calories are convenient, taste good and provide a quick boost when we
feel tired.
 
Organisation is key to sticking to a healthy
diet and taking time to plan meals in advance pays dividends for your health
and bank-balance. Always make time to
eat a proper breakfast to boost energy levels and prevent a slump in blood
sugar triggering cravings for sugary snacks. 
Take a healthy lunch to work, maybe homemade soup or salad and use a
slow-cooker to return home to a hearty hot meal. Avoid situations where you are liable to make
bad food choices; most burger chains sell a salad, but honestly who buys them?

Comfort
 
Food can be used as a way of dealing with
emotions; grief, frustration, boredom. 
Maybe you were treated to food as a child and associate treats with feeling
loved.  Emotional eating can fill a gap
when basic human needs aren’t being met, or you feel stressed and upset about
things.  However it can quickly turn into
binge-eating becoming a vicious downward spiral with post-binge feelings of
disgust triggering another binge.
 
Try to address what issues cause comfort eating
and look for non-food solutions; a creative activity such as painting helps if
you feel a lack of stimulation, enabling the expression of pent-up feelings
whilst physical activity elevates mood and feelings of self-esteem.  Don’t use food as a treat, book a beauty
treatment, buy a glossy magazine or the latest paperback, enjoy a film or see a
theatre show.
 Relax and be pampered 
Habit
 
A daily fix of caffeine, chocolate or alcohol
can be very difficult to manage without; the Danish pastry at morning tea
break, impossible to resist chips in the canteen for lunch, 3:30 pm chocolate
bar for energy until you get home, a large glass of wine to unwind after you’ve
battled through traffic and finally get through the door, another chocolate bar
whilst your favourite soap is on TV. 
These habits become engrained and are difficult to break.

Have you ever wondered why it&apos;s so difficult to drive past your favourite fast-food restaurant, or ignore the slice of chocolate cake you know is in the fridge? Fat and sugar increase dopamine levels; this chemical motivates our behaviour, driving us towards food and increasing our focus on obtaining that food. Brain activity is also stimulated by food cues which suggest the food is nearby; the signal predicting the food generating the dopamine response. Each time you act on these cues you&apos;re rewiring your brain and eating becomes a habit.

 



A period of change in your life is ideal time
to break bad habits triggered by daily routine. 
Your mind is in “change mode” and the absence of cues which normally prompt
this behaviour can be used to positive effect. 
For example if you start a new job you can ditch the chocolate and start
eating fruit, your colleagues will think you always eat healthily.
 
Addiction
 
Food is
an emotional quick-fix her things masking feelings of grief and frustration and
the physical effects of lack of sleep and alcohol consumption. Junk food acts like
an opiate (painkiller) on the brain but the effect quickly wears off leaving you
desperately craving more.

The combination of sugar, fat and salt makes junk food &apos;hyperpalatable&apos; arousing the appetite; it often requires little chewing and goes down easily. The food stimulates brain neurons which release endorphins making us feel better.

 
Try to avoid cravings by eating a regular healthy meals, keeping
well-hydrated (drinking plenty of water) and taking regular exercise or
engaging in an enjoyable non-food activity. 
When hit with a craving make an effort to resist the urge, phone a
friend for a chat, do some household chores, take the dog for a walk.
 
Future Health Problems
 
The effects of junk food are not immediately obvious; we don’t see arteries
clogging and internal organs getting fatty and weak.  We don’t associate tiredness, anxiety, depression
and skin problems with junk food eaten during day.  The health problems creep up slowly; type 2 diabetes,
heart disease, liver disease and hypertension resulting in heart attacks,
strokes, organ failure, and death. 
Eating plenty of whole nutritious foods and avoiding processed foods
will improve health and increase life-expectancy.

Understanding why we do something unhealthy is the first big step in preventing or reducing it. So easy to relate to what you&apos;ve written. I voted for comfort, though my comfort foods are gradually becoming healthier too. Thanks for the hub!

Thanks for your comment - I eat junk food for a combination of reasons, but mainly convenience. I&apos;m not always as organised as I&apos;d like to be with meals and that&apos;s when everything goes wrong!

These are all great points.

One more I would add is the cost is very low.

Right now a person can feast at McDonald&apos;s for $3.

They can get a McDouble, small fry, and coke from the $1 menu. Wendy&apos;s has combos starting at $2.99.

Both places offer free refills on soda.

Some people find it difficult to spend $7.99 for a salad and a glass of water.

However as you point out if a person is willing to cook their meals at home they would save money by bringing their left overs for lunch to work.

This brings us back to the &quot;convenience factor&quot;.

A person can go to the drive through and pick up a cheap hot meal in less than a minute.

Still it&apos;s kind of sad to see so many parents feeding their kids fast food on a daily basis. Nice hub!

Look at everywhere on the road. You see all the junk food available. It is just so easy unfortunately. It takes a lot of will power to avoid eating junk food.

Hi DashingScorpio - yes price is a big factor; a small tub of prepared mixed fruit can cost up to £2.50 and you could get a burger for the same price, if you&apos;re hungry the burger is likely to prove most tempting.

DrChad - yes couldn&apos;t agree more it takes a LOT of willpower to avoid junk food. But if you can steer clear the less you eat the fewer cravings you get until the thought of it actually makes you feel ill.

Very very good hub on why we eat junk food. Loved learning about how the brain works in all of this and how certain foods trigger the brain. Excellent and I am voting Up, useful, awesome and interesting.
