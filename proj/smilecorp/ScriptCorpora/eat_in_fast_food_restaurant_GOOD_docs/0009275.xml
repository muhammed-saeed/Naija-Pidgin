The pizzazz of the Indian Premier League versus the gentile tea-sipping of the County Championship – we should embrace both forms of the game

The new season of the Indian Premier League – or IPL4 as it is to be known – started on Friday. By coincidence this was the same day the County Championship season (or in the new style &quot;ECC112&quot;) stepped out from beneath it s UPVC veranda and embarked on another instalment in it s endless summer of parochial sporting intrigue.

There is of course a natural polar it y between these two extreme interpretations of the word &quot;cricket&quot;. The IPL is brash, expansionist and draped in a cladding of new imperial glamour. It wants to conquer the world. The ECC is old, quiet and draped in a cladding of house dust and summer‑tog cagoule. It wants a nice cup of tea. They are two entirely separate ent it ies, scarcely the same species of sport. But which one is better?

As an English cricket fan it has seemed necessary to ask this question during the three seasons of the IPL, partly because of scheduling that p it s the two together, and partly because of the nature of the IPL it self, an intrusive sporting product that has from the outset advertised it self as crushingly tooled-up and unanswerably monetised. Prodded from afar, it is easy to feel a l it tle defensive – and also to mock the nature of this prefab splendour. This week, for example, saw the launch of the first ever IPL car. The Volkswagen Vento IPL features IPL logos across it s bodywork and &quot;leatherette seats w it h embroidered IPL batsman motifs&quot;. Presumably it also makes a crunching noise that sounds a b it like &quot;SACHINISGOD&quot; when you accidentally put it into reverse at a roundabout, tries to sell you a quant it y of industrial cement every time you glance in the wing mirror and has a stereo that will only play 20-second bursts of groin‑thrusting classics you know and hate.

This is of course part of the objection to the IPL: not just the inan it y of it s presentation, but it s corporate greed. County cricket was also invented by entrepreneurs – Victorians w it h an eye on the gate receipts – and was so successful it gave rise to a football league that, in it s Premier League form, directly inspired the IPL. An ancestral lineage links the two, but it is a question of degree. The IPL is const it utionally obsessed w it h sponsorship, and w it h the garnering of &quot;eyeballs&quot;, a marketing term for mass, trawler‑netted consumers. IPL3 grossed 100m eyeballs. IPL4 is looking to top that. In the UK this will most likely include your eyeballs too as you find yourself sucked inexorably into IT V4&apos;s coverage w it h poor old doggedly persevering Matt Sm it h, locked in his bankside broom cupboard w it h Robert Croft for the next 49 days and 73 matches.

On a commercial level there was only ever going to be one winner here. Mumbai Indians are currently sponsored by Pepsi, Mastercard, Kingfisher, Wrigley&apos;s gum and Royal Stag whisky, which taken together really does sound like a particularly taxing night in. This season Yorkshire&apos;s sponsors include Bryan&apos;s Fish&amp;Seafood Restaurant and Aunt Bessie&apos;s Yorkshire Puddings. At the time of wr it ing there is no word of any plans inside Headingley to introduce the Aunt Bessie&apos;s Yorkshire Puddings Moment Of Success, or to designate any outbreaks of six-h it ting as a Bryan&apos;s Fish&amp;Seafood Restaurant Maximum.

 It is important to register this unanswerable gulf in fiscal reach. When Twenty20 first emerged there were those who imagined an IPL-type league might be possible in England. Instead the new impulse towards rampant cash-raking found it s natural home in a country that can afford to take a punt on it . The IPL is the perfect reservoir for cricket&apos;s new materialism, a sealed bunker in which the game can be safely super-heated. And once you give in to it , the branded pizzazz is all spectacular fun. Even that VW Vento IPL (w it h complimentary cricket k it ) is – let&apos;s be honest – clearly the best car ever and you really want one.

This just leaves the actual cricket. The IPL was once seen as the final stage in turning Twenty20 into an aggressive terr it orial, the killer bamboo in cricket&apos;s mature borders. For a while it seemed necessary to argue that the short format is facile and lacking in narrative rhythm. Watching, say, Jacques Kallis trying to h it every ball for six, it was as though Mr D&apos;Arcy had given up smouldering silently across the tea table and instead decided just to get his nipples pierced and go out dogging in a motorway lay-by.

This is all a b it passé now. Let us simply accept that Twenty20 is a separate game and even qu it e a weird game – a place where Kieron Pollard, who in longer forms occasionally seems not to be able to play cricket at all, prodding and shovelling and occasionally sneezing out a six, is considered a world star. As both seasons judder into their stride we should be able to enjoy them in tandem, and even as mutually beneficial. The influx of younger county players w it h a liking for six-h it ting – Jos Buttler, Alex Hales, Ben Stokes – feels as though it might even be fuelled by distant IPL-osmosis, the pull of this new sporting moon. Better still, India are over here in August for a blockbusting multiformat tour. It feels, above all, like a summer to celebrate the brilliantly diverse riches at our disposal.

 Chyniss, SS2 Mall 
 [ Baking ] ( Have Your Cake and Eat It Too )
The first surprise of the night was the sheer size of the SS2 mall. I hope to insert a picture here eventually, but I was so taken aback by the sheer size, I had lost all presence of mind to snap a picture. A road that was previously a dead end, (from Rothman Roundabout, you go past Greenview and go straight, instead of turning left to SS2, and just follow the road) now leads to this gargantuan structure that looks like a giant space ship that landed in an empty field.

 [details] [close] received 1 year ago  published 1 year ago  lang: en   The first surprise of the night was the sheer size of the SS2 mall. I hope to insert a picture here eventually, but I was so taken aback by the sheer size, I had lost all presence of mind to snap a picture. A road that was previously a dead end, (from Rothman Roundabout, you go past Greenview and go straight, instead of turning left to SS2, and just follow the road) now leads to this gargantuan structure that looks like a giant space ship that landed in an empty field. It is qu it e a spectacular sight.

The 2nd surprise was of course to find this treasure trove of culinary delights in CHYNISS. (pronounced ...well, err..Chinese). When Aly first asked us to check out this place w it h her, my first thought was, Chyniss? Is that the people born in Chynna? (the Chinese restaurant in KL Hilton). If you think that was bad, Aly thought it was pronounced CHEE NEES. Hallo! Well, the restaurant wing of the mall actually faces the houses in SS2, in that road where the old Paris shack used to be. So it is better to access the restaurant s from there, as there is now a valet parking service for RM4.

We were joined by the owner, and very gracious host, Mr KH Saw (who also owns D It alian K it chen), Stephen, a freelance Star Reporter, Nicholas, a body builder chef, Joyce, wife of the owner, Sai Fun, a freelance copywr it er who helped come up w it h the name, and our usual motley crowd, Aly, I am the W it ch, Mr I AM THE W IT CH, (Saucer) and Lexie of Red FM. W it h such a crowd, could dinner have been anything less than fun?

 
There&apos;s something very empowering about swallo wing these l it tle shrimps whole, eyes, and all. Very V-like.... not to mention, addictive. Crispy and savoury, actually these are the perfect accompaniment for an icy cold glass of Tiger. (hor Aly).

 
Mr Saw very kindly explained to us the concept of Chyniss, which really, is to gather the favour it es, and in some cases, lesser known cuisine from the various chinese dialects, from the four corners of the country. For example, the very interesting fish ball dish from Sibu, ...which we will see later. A lot of creativ it y goes into some of these dishes, while at the same time, maintaining old favour it es like Sang Har Mee, etc.

 
Crispy Pork Belly w it h Rolled Chargrilled Cuttlefish. Lovely caramelised pork, layered w it h fat, and fried to a lovely cracker like consistency. I would have prefered more pork, and less cuttlefish. It &apos;s not that I didn&apos;t like the cuttlefish, it s just that I loved the pork more. Actually this dish is another one that would go well w it h beer.

 


 
Baked Giant River Prawns w it h &apos;Dang Gui&apos; and Butter - &apos;Dang Gui&apos; is Tong Kwai in Cantonese, or cordyceps (no relation to biceps or triceps) in English. Cordyceps powder ground and infused into the prawn shells. How fabulous is that. You get a lovely flavour when che wing the prawn shell. The prawns are succulent and fresh, and the sauce accompanying it is fabulous. Cries out for rice though. P it y rice has such a bad rap and it s become unfashionable to be a fan tong. (rice barrel)

 
Check out our shrimp. I think this pic was meant for Terry of Red FM, who is observing Lent and is abstaining from all good food.

 
Tea Smoked Village Chicken - Now the thing about Chinese cuisine is, most of this stuff, you defin it ely would not have the time and patience to make at home. There is an almost unbridgeable abyss between what Chyniss ..oops, Chinese flers would eat at home, and what you&apos;d eat at a restaurant . Well, to me anyway. The idea of smoking a chicken, or anything else, for that matter, is just too mind boggling, but I am glad they DO do it in restaurant s, because the flavours are just so complex and t it illating to the palate. You get the charredness of smoke, w it hout the carcinogenic carbon, the subtle tea flavour, (Pu Li tea I think they use), and the wonderful texture of Free Range Kampung Chicken, which imparts a kind of gaminess to the whole dish. I&apos;d say this was one of my favour it es.

 
Fish Balls w it h Japanese Potato Glass Noodles - I can imagine my kids would love this dish. Potato glass noodles are qu it e unique to me, I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ve had them. Fresh fishballs made from ...well, fish...or Tenggiri to be precise. (Mackerel).

 


 
CHYNIIS House Special Boneless Crispy Chicken- Now, if only all chickens were made like this. This chicken is all dark meat (Aly heard this chicken is all duck meat). What they&apos;ve done is made sure the entire dish , even the b it s that look like breasts, are actually leg/thigh meat. I wonder if they have another dish that is all breast.

 


 
Beef Squares w it h Beancurd Skin and Puffed Rice - This is a rather unique dish as well. Beef patties sandwiched between foo choke, served on a slice of tomato, and topped w it h rice crispies. A myriad of textures. I enjoyed this dish too, (actually I enjoyed ALL the dishes) and defin it ely it is something different.

 
CHYNIIS Sang Har Mee - There seems to be proliferation of places offering this particular it em on the menu, but given the close proxim it y this place is to &quot;Verdant Vistas&quot; I guess it makes sense for them to serve it too. I almost fainted when I heard Joyce say they had purposely reduced the noodles as she thought we might be full from all the other stuff which is of course true, BUT, me and noodles, we go a long way, and it s a love affair that has not ceased. I am one of those that wouldnt mind half a prawn w it h a LOT of noodles. And, the noodles here were GOOD!!! Springy and &quot;song&quot;. Loved it . Of course the prawn and the sauce speaks for it self....rich, and artery clogging.

 
Wah, so long ah!

 
CHYNIIS Special Handmade &apos;Man Tou&apos; W it h Hot&amp;Spicy Chili Crabs - I forgot to take a picture of the Mantou because I was telling Lexie a silly Mantou joke (which I thought was hilarious), but them mantous (pronounced Man (as in &quot;Mon-ey&quot;) Tau ) were gooooood! Dip them into this chilli crab sauce, ah, heaven on a bun. The crabs were chock full of roe.

 
Dessert was Steamed Sweet Potato Cake Crusted w it h Crispy Oats. Not too sweet. Just right.

 
Three pretty maidens all in a row.

 

Well, another place to bring family and friends for a good Chinese dinner. I can imagine the conversation. What shall we have tonight? Chinese? Yeah, Chyniss. Where? Chyniss la. Where la, not what. No no no, Chyniss. In SS2 Mall.

Thanks again Mr Saw, for having us, and to Aly for inv it ing me.

Wonder Dogs: Medical Marvels
7pm, Nat Geo Wild


The best part of More4&apos;s recent Crufts coverage involved heroic pooches who help their owners w it h everything from closing the bathroom door to answering the phone. This new series is that for a whole hour, allo wing plenty of time for marvelling at cleverness and cuteness. Tonight, dogs who can detect oncoming seizures. Rebecca Nicholson 

Candy Cabs
9pm, BBC1


A group of feisty women friends launch a girls-only taxi service. They are heart-warmingly bluff in the face of advers it y yet nurturing and supportive towards each other. And they&apos;ve no end of trouble w it h flamin&apos; men. (Insert condescending eye-roll here.) Paul Kaye reprises every role he&apos;s had in the last 10 years playing a feckless waster who arrives to cause trouble. In trying to produce chirpy, working-class drama, they&apos;ve succeeded in patronising all concerned in the way that, say, Linda Green just didn&apos;t. Julia Raeside 

Filthy C it ies
9pm, BBC2


Vis it ors to London, Paris and New York often remark, not w it hout reason, on the filth that plagues their streets, as if the c it izens of each are afraid that l it ter bins are f it ted w it h electric shock mechanisms. This new series by Dan Snow will, at the very least, remind that it could be worse. Snow will dredge the past of all three c it ies, starting by summoning 14th-century London, a slum so putrid that Londoners routinely wore wooden platform shoes to keep the mess out of their socks. Andrew Mueller 

Campus
10pm, Channel 4


Set in the fictional Kirke Univers it y and revolving around the lives of members of staff, Campus was first shown as a pilot on C4 in 2009. It was greenl it for a full series and the result is a car crash. Among the wr it ers are some of the team who worked on Green Wing and there are certainly flecks of comedy pedigree. But the maniacally amb it ious vice-chancellor Jonty de Wolfe is a hopelessly misfiring caricature. Not having a laugh track is no guarantee of naturalism and there&apos;s barely an ounce of plausibil it y in Campus. David Stubbs 

Storyville – China&apos;s Bleak House
10pm, BBC4


There&apos;s a scene in this superb, albe it incredibly bleak, documentary in which poor Chinese workers watch televised New Year celebrations. &quot;Abundant blessings rain from the heavens,&quot; warbles a singer. &quot;All things go well.&quot; Watching this, one might instead concur w it h a quote from the Dickens novel from which this programme borrows it s t it le: &quot;The universe makes rather an indifferent parent, I&apos;m afraid.&quot; Shot over 12 years, Zhao Liang&apos;s brave film follows victims of corruption, some driven half-mad w it h grief, endlessly seeking redress at Beijing&apos;s court of plaintiffs – while also spotlighting the sinister &quot;retrievers&quot;, heavies employed to (physically) dissuade them. A shocking indictment. Ali Catterall 

Wh it e Van Man
10.30pm, BBC3


The ill-advised nature of mixing business w it h pleasure is the theme of tonight&apos;s Wh it e Van Man. The charming but flaky Darren attempts to pull off the feat of working w it h Olly (Will Mellor) on the house where he&apos;s just spent the night w it h the owner, Lucy – w it h ne it her Olly nor Lucy suspecting what he&apos;s doing. Emma, meanwhile, p it ches one of Olly&apos;s business ideas to the errantly-haired Ian (Dexter Fletcher). It &apos;s Toast Office – a toast-themed restaurant w it h free champagne, &quot;so you can toast your toast&quot;. It didn&apos;t start well, but this has been an endearingly surreal grower, mainly down to Joel Fry as Darren. John Robinson

We are now 4 weeks away from debuting the winning concept and w it h this episode 7 out of 10 contestants remain standing.

 

The first task was to design a uniform, pick a few props, and pose for a photo shoot representing your business. Six contestants had a great idea for a simple shirt w it h a logo, a tag line and a basic prop for their restaurant while Joey went overboard w it h a black fancy shirt, a tie, and wh it e wing tip shoes and then ended up posing w it h a loaf of bread and a gun. Huh? Is this a gangster hangout or a meatball restaurant ? Also who can cook and work wearing that attire? No one bothered to correct him or offer any suggestions hoping his outlandish concept would convince the investors to not invest in his business.

 

The second task was a s it down session w it h each investor. The contestants went over their menu w it h each investor while they picked a menu it em they wanted them to perfect and cook. This task really challenged the contestants. They are passionate about their idea and when the investors suggest they sw it ch it up; they&apos;re a b it hes it ant but some embrace the change and it has been proven that if they make the change, they are safe from elimination but at the same time they sacrifice a piece of themselves and what they originally dreamed of.

 

In the end, Grill Billies won the culinary challenge and Joey, Eric, and Sandy were in the bottom three. Sandy&apos;s concept of Sinners and Saints has been inconsistant as far as food, menu, and approach. The investors felt she wouldn&apos;t make a good manager and didn&apos;t understand what she was trying to accomplish. Also her sandwich wasn&apos;t cooked right. It was obvious why Joey was in the bottom three given his uniform design however Eric was sent home. Eric has been designing Melt Works for 3 years and the investors feel he still hasn&apos;t grasped the correct concept for a grilled cheese sandwich and he didn&apos;t take the investor&apos;s advice.

 

Next week, the remaining 6 contestants take their ideas on the road and create a food truck.

 Elanne: I&apos;m very happy to have inv it ed my big brother to do this interview w it h me. We can continue our collaboration from E.U. Although back then I only had 1 scene w it h you, two years later I can collaborate w it h you again in Relic of an Emissary. This time we have a lot of scenes oppos it e of each other, I even have to fall in love w it h this courageous bodyguard.

 Michael: E.U we had one scene and it was the shortest one too, so audience don&apos;t know we had that one scene.

 Elanne: Haha! Yes, we spent 3 months together shooting for Relic. The most memorable scene for me was when we were stuck in the bottom of the well. It was 40 degrees in there, I saw your face turning green, lips turning wh it e, very difficult. And you even told me to hold on.

 Michael: I clearly remember that scene too, it was about you falling into the well, I had to suspend myself on a rope down there to get you. It was honestly very hot in that well, when I was hanging down on the role, I felt like a roast goose. At the bottom of the well, there was another roasted goose wa it ing for me, adding me, that makes two roasted gooses!

 Elanne: That time we were so hot, we really got &apos;cooked&apos; in there! You told me to hold on, and said if we could get through this, there are many things we can w it hstand. I really admire you! How can you act out any look or expression and there are even so many people watching. Exactly how can you figure out that character?

 Michael: We have friends around us, each w it h a different personal it y. Dra wing from that resource, already got the differences. Also, every role is designed to have character, just magnify it and make it stronger, then there will be a solid role.

 Elanne: When I first saw you, I was pretty scared. I felt you were very cool looking, plus your role in E.U is very rude, walking out you are a good big brother, very frightening! However, collaborating w it h you again this time, I learned that you are actually a very funny and playful person.

 Michael: I feel that it &apos;s best to think of work like entertainment, time will go by faster, the atmosphere is more relaxed and everyone will get into character more. You and I have so many scenes together, we have to see each other day and night for 3 months, we have to have feelings and be able to chat in order to feel happy while working. It &apos;s like some scenes are hard to get deep into, so w it h good communication, we will be more natural when it s time to film. But honestly, it &apos;s not everyone that can be communicated w it h, some people really are all scattered, put up all their gates and when this happens, you will just have to deal w it h it yourself!

 Elanne: You really know how to communicate w it h people and make atmosphere. One time after long hours of work and lack of sleep, I was so exhausted I was lying on desk, you told me: &quot;Hey, wake up and eat.&quot; And then you tried your hardest to make everyone laugh and boost the spir it . My nickname in acting is &quot;Kong Fu Keung&quot; (Rich&amp;Powerful). You told me to make a song called &quot;Kong Fu Keung&quot; and then you always said: &quot;Kong Fu Keung 2011 Master Piece Super Low Energy, Very Funny&quot; Then you sang &quot;Super low energy energy.... very very funny funny funny....&quot; When you kept singing that, no matter how tired I was, I could still stay awake. One time I was unhappy about something, you used your own experiences to comfort me, I am greatly thankful of that. We both collaborated in two series, how do you think I changed?

 Michael: I feel that your acting skills have gradually matured. When you portrayed Yau Yau in E.U, perhaps it was your age, you were a l it tle too narrow. Until recently when I saw you as Princess Wing Yeung, you played a role that went from simple minded to mature. You had good sense of arrangement.

 Elanne: You portrayed so many roles, Laughing Gor and the Jean Man (Cheap Man) in La Femme Desperado, these two roles were done very well. Which one did you like more?

 Won&apos;t calculate which roles to accept 

 Michael: I really like both roles. Jean Man made many women love and hate him. At first he deserved to die, but in the end it turns out that he was a good man after all. I felt that people had a huge change of reactions, I really enjoyed the results. As for Laughing Gor, he is also a character that I deeply admire. He was an undercover that no one cared for, but in the end when the truth came out, the burst of reactions really made floated into the second floor. These two roles both gave me the same feeling of accomplishment. If I were to choose one between the two, I liked Laughing Gor more because he attracted the audience more.

 Elanne: Have you thought of this echo when you accepted the script?

 Michael: I do not know how to calculate these kind of things, so why not spend more time to try and figure out how to portray the role. I know some people who would first calculate everything before deciding whether or not to accept a script, I feel that is basically trying to escape from real it y. Every role I accept, I will think of all the ways I can to make the role pretty, that&apos;s how I get a great sense of accomplishment.

 Dancing Makes a Rainbow 

 Elanne: When you first entered the industry, you were a TVB dancer. You really love to dance, always dancing around on the set in your ancient costumes.

 Michael: Yes, I was already very jumpy when I was a kid. When I saw the people on TV dancing, I just followed them. When I was in form 5, there was an announcement that the TV station was hiring dancers, so I applied to try it out. If it didn&apos;t work out, it didn&apos;t hurt to try.

 Elanne: Once you started dancing, you did it for 5 years. When you left was your salary only HK$4000? How could you survive at that time?

 Michael: The living expenses at that time wasn&apos;t that high, but I had to suffer a l it tle, but I was enjoying the process because I liked this profession and I learned a lot, worth it .

 Best friend is his wife 

 Elanne: Is your wife very helpful?

 Michael: Yes, she helps me a lot. We work and work, no time to think. At home, she does everything, so I could stay focus on work. I just sleep every day, as long as there is work to do.

 Elanne: Then do you have time to be romantic w it h her? Like cook up a few dishes?

 Michael: When I don&apos;t have to work, I cook at home. I cook the common dishes, like Cantonese dishes, meat patties, water eggs, and things like that. Nothing special, but I put my heart into the dishes, she and my son love it .

 Elanne: You are married for 6 years, would you think of any special way to celebrate your wedding anniversaries?

 Michael: Our first wedding anniversary, we went to Macau for bungee jumping. That time, my wife asked me why are we celebrating like this. I told her, I&apos;m not scared of marriage, why would I be scared to bungee jump? Also, it &apos;s a special way to celebrate, we will defin it ely remember it . It &apos;s because that is our first anniversary. Later in our 2nd and 3rd year, I forgot how we celebrated. It &apos;s usually celebrated w it h a normal dinner after work.

 From slacking to being compet it ive 

 Elanne: About dancing, in 2007 when you participated in Strictly Come Dancing, at the time there was some doubt. You haven&apos;t danced in public for a long time, how come you participated in that compet it ion?

 Michael: At the time, I was forced to participate, I sid I haven&apos;t danced for several years, I don&apos;t know how to do it anymore! But in TVB&apos;s standpoint, of course they hope to send out an artist who has background in dancing. TVB then told me to go and see how the s it uation was, that time I just finished shooting a Qing dynasty costume drama, I stuffed myself qu it e a b it and was chubby, how can I go out in public like that? So I went on the show w it h an att it ude that I&apos;m doing it for fun. I thought it was very possible that on the 2nd or 3rd round, I&apos;ll be voted out. Surprisingly, I realized that all the other contestants were very serious about it and preparing as much as they could. That show was really serious, at the time I felt that we were all representing Hong Kong, no reason for us to lose, then my compet it ive heart came alive. I spent 2 months participating in 9 compet it ions, in the end I was lucky to have won the first prize.

 Elanne: Was the whole process difficult?

 Michael: Not too bad, just exhausting. We were rehearsing day and night, every day our clothes are soaked in sweat. When I got back to the hotel room, I was sleeping like I fell into a coma and mostly spent life like a student. I thought it was qu it e fun actually, nothing too difficult. It was rehearsing in Hunan, then go back to the hotel to sleep. There won&apos;t be any friends asking you to go out for a drink at 2-3am, life was very simple and clear, a type of discipline.

 Michael is a hypocr it e 

The day Elanne interviewed Michael, he had a motorcycle&apos;s helmet on and choked his way into the restaurant for the interview. It turns out that he just passed the driving test for motorcycle. W it h a rookie license, Michael was not to have any passengers for a year. He said that he still won&apos;t drive anyone even after a year has passed because he&apos;s worried of an accident that may affect his passenger.

When it was time to do the interview, Elanne asked him the same question, Michael answered the same: &quot;Motorcycles are toys for me personally, I am qu it e selfish, don&apos;t want to share w it h people.&quot; Michael was a hypocr it e, in fact he just didn&apos;t want to brag that he was good and was considerate. This is the cute side of Michael!

 Chateau de la Treyne, a French Escape for Romance and Cuisine 
 [ Travel ] ( EuropeUpClose )
Chateau de la Treyne, in southwestern France, is a romantic, fairytale castle in a lovely garden surrounded by forest. My stay there was just about perfect. I’ll try not to gush, but it ’s hard not to. I got to play Cinderella and didn’t have to hurry home at midnight. Not until two days later did I step back into the mundane world, and since I was in France it still felt magical.

 Chateau de la Treyne , in southwestern France , is a romantic, fairytale castle in a lovely garden surrounded by forest. My stay there was just about perfect. I’ll try not to gush, but it ’s hard not to. I got to play Cinderella and didn’t have to hurry home at midnight. Not until two days later did I step back into the mundane world, and since I was in France it still felt magical.

When John and I arrived at the chateau, dusty and tired after touring the countryside, we were greeted by one of the owners, Stéphanie Gombert. Friendly and gracious, she escorted us up the wide stone staircase to a lovely room overlooking the Dordogne River, and by the time we’d cleaned up, sipped glasses of wine on our terrace, and strolled to the dining room, we were completely hooked on the place.

 In the public spaces, wh it e stone walls, wooden beams, antique furn it ure and tapestries create a historic atmosphere, but it ’s not stuffy, just richly comfortable and warm. And there are plenty of discreet modern touches such as air-cond it ioning, satell it e TV and free Wi-Fi. The chateau dates from the 14 th century, but it fell into disrepair or ruin more than once before the mid-20 th century, when it was fully restored. In 1982, Philippe and Stéphanie Gombert took over and made it their passion. Offering 16 rooms and su it es, it ’s now part of the Relais&amp;Chateaux group. Need I add that it ’s expensive? Unless you have a thicker wallet than mine, this is where you go for a splurge.

Chateau de la Treyne stands on a cliff above the broad, winding Dordogne. It has formal gardens, a tennis court, and a heated outdoor pool, all surrounded by 296 acres of trees. As if that weren’t enough, the hotel has a Michelin-starred restaurant w it h a chef renowned for his creative cuisine that focuses on specialties of the region. Stéphane Andrieux prepares fish fresh from the river and lamb from the local Quercy sheep. He does foie gras in four different ways, but since I’m not qu it e ready for raw foie gras marinated in salt, I enjoyed pet it s pois soup, delicate pigeon, and sorbets. This was in the Louis XIII dining room, where the atmosphere is just what you’d expect: candlel it tables set w it h fine china and crystal, piano music, and attentive service. In mild weather, meals are served on the cliff-edge terrace. You can eat a fine meal and watch the river glide by.

The chateau is 8 miles from the village of Souillac and about 20 miles from the Brive-Souillac airport. The Gomberts are happy to advise guests on vis it ing nearby s it es of interest, and they offer trips around the Périgord countryside, which has intriguing caves, museums, charming villages, and many castles. The hours and open dates of the castles vary. A few are:

 Château de Castelnau-Bretenoux 
 This imposing medieval fortress, modified in the 17 th century, was the home of a wealthy family until 1715. In the 19 th century it was purchased by an opera singer, Jean Mouliérat, who restored and filled it w it h eclectic furnishings and art objects. It has a chapel and a sculpture gallery, and is also a National Monument of France.

 Château de Montal 
Built in 1523 by Jeanne de Balsac, Château de Montal was beautifully restored in the 20 th century and now is a National Monument of France. The furnishings are from the 16th to 18 th centuries and include rare 300-year-old tapestries. It has a splendid staircase and Renaissance interior courtyard w it h a boxwood maze in the formal garden. 

 Château de Fénelon 
Fénelon castle stands on a promontory above the village of St. Mondane. Originally built in the 1400s, it was redone in the 16 th century and it s furn it ure reflects the 15 th to 19 th centuries. Each room is decorated in a different style. There is also a collection of weapons and armor. The turrets are covered w it h trad it ional lauze stones, rare today because of the expense.

 Château d’Assier 
Another National Monument of France, this chateau is a gem of Renaissance arch it ecture, built in the 16 th century by the Master of Artillery under Francis I.  It once had four wing s; now only the west wing remains, richly decorated w it h friezes, classical scenes and emblems. Inside there’s a grand staircase, a small museum, and several rooms.

For romance, great food and chateaux, you just can’t beat France’s Dordogne region.

 UK Uncut cannot denounce the violence on 26 March, Niki Seth-Sm it h 
 [ Citizen Journalism ] ( openDemocracy )
Those most heavily involved in UKUncut are under enormous pressure to denounce the violence on behalf of the rest of us in the network. W it hout doing so, it is hard to see how UKUncut will regain lost support from the general public and the mainstream media. But this cannot be the answer.

W it hout doing so, it is hard to see how UKUncut will regain lost support from the general public and the mainstream media. But this cannot be the answer. 
Last Saturday, the TUC’s March for the Alternative drew an estimated 500,000 protesters to London from across the UK. They followed a route from Embankment to Hyde Park, where speeches were heard and experiences shared.

The network UKUncut staged it s largest action to date on the same day, w it h an aim to shut down branches of the shops and banks most guilty of tax avoidance in and around Oxford Circus and the West End.
 
&quot;Setting up the actions on Oxford Street is up to you!... ...There will be lots of people on Oxford Street, so don&apos;t worry too much about getting numbers.&quot;
 
After Saturday’s events, I re-read this note , posted on the UKUncut webs it e. I had w it nessed the conflation of the network’s planned series of peaceful direct actions w it h the acts of violence perpetrated by the Black Bloc and other groups that day. The lines were blurred not only spatially, but in (continuing) coverage by the mainstream media and, seemingly, in the eyes of the police. It gives some pause for thought. 

The &apos;splinter group&apos; – who e it her peeled off from the official march route after 2pm, or were never there in the first place – now dominate the headlines. I was among them. At first there was a rave atmosphere: samba drums; multi-coloured smoke from home-made flares; the ‘Trojan Horse’ brought to the march by the ‘Armed Wing of the TUC’ was burned joyously at Oxford Circus. My friend joked that while Hyde Park was a picnic, this was more like Notting Hill Carnival.

But already, a minor it y, many carrying red and black flags, mostly young and w it h their faces covered, had begun a game of cat and mouse w it h the police, leaving a trail of smashed windows, upturned bins, graff it i and smoke bombs in their wake. The escalating damage to property, and large-scale disruption to shoppers, was answered by a ramping up of riot police operations. By around 3pm, UKUncut’s planned scenes of revelry and mischievous civil disobedience (an anti-cuts choir in RBS, a ‘hosp it al’ set up in Boots) had morphed into a chaotic, violent and surreal landscape – a mini conflict zone in which no-one knew who was on who’s side, covering a large section of Central London.  

The 2012 &apos;Olympic&apos; clock, the memorial, the R it z, Fortnum and Mason, Top Shop, Ann Summers, Santander, Lloyds and HSBC were just some of the shops, banks and s it es reported by the nationals as ‘assaulted’ on Saturday (as if they were the human beings, not the protesters beaten and forcibly arrested later that day). Many of these branches were UKUncut targets, e it her from previous actions or planned for the day. On Sunday night, the Guardian published an article under the UKUncut spokesperson pseudonym &apos;Alex Pinkerman’. It said:
 
&quot;There has been anger directed at us because some media outlets incorrectly use our name for actions we did not organise, giving ever action the name UKUncut. But it is clear, if you spend two minutes on our webs it e, who we are, what we are about, and what our plans were.&quot;
 
 It is not clear who UKUncut are. How can it be, when it is a nation-wide, open and inclusive network, w it h no official leaders or organizational structure? (Desp it e the Telegraph’s claim today that the leader is Thom Costello, pseudonym Sam Baker.) UKUncut is a “banner” around which a network of individuals (including myself) has formed; open to interpretation, appropriation and transformation by those individuals. This was recognized by UKUncut spokesperson Lucy Anderson on Newsnight last night . To the frustration of presenter Emily Ma it lis, Anderson not only refused to condemn the violence, but rejected “the premise of that question.” She said: “We don&apos;t have a pos it ion on things; what we do is share resources to plan actions against the cuts&quot;…“UKUncut provides spaces which are creative, fun and inclusive&quot; .. ( it is) “an idea, a piece of inspiration”. It ’s not that Anderson and ‘Pinkerman’ (no doubt the name for a collaboration) have not taken a pos it ion on the violence on behalf of UKUncut; they have recognized that they cannot speak for the network.

What they can, and have done, is describe the kinds of actions that the network has staged until now. UKUncut actions had been developing a strongly recognizable ethics, strategy and image. The fight against tax-avoidance, anchored in an appeal to a &apos;Br it ish&apos; sense of fairness, expressed through unthreatening acts of defiant civil disobedience (such as closing Topshop on a Saturday before Christmas ) in a jubilant, creative spir it has won the network sympathetic coverage from unlikely corners (see the Daily Mail ). Through it s actions, the network has been consolidating a nonviolent pol it ical strategy, and a clear pol it ical message. But on Saturday, the UKUncut banner was held aloft over scenes of violence.

Some were clearly not the handiwork of members of the network. (I saw the windows of Asian restaurant ‘Cocoon’ smashed in, seemingly for no other reason than it s convenient location down a narrow alley, and stones being thrown at police w it h no provocation.) Yet it would be reckless to denounce all the violence as mindless thuggery. It ’s certain that some on Saturday 26 were morally convinced of the need for what they saw as pol it ical violence, while other protesters will have been swept up in the rush of anger, adrenalin and fear. Some will no doubt have been part of the UKUncut network. Members of The Solidar it y Federation wrote on Monday in their “letter to UKUncutters from the violent minor it y ” that “anarchists and UKUncutters were not mutually exclusive on that day” (the 26th). Although their defin it ion of what was ‘anarchic’ is disputable, they are right to point to the fluid it y of the s it uation.

Those most heavily involved in UKUncut are under enormous pressure to denounce the violence on behalf of the rest of us in the network. W it hout doing so, it is hard to see how UKUncut will regain lost support from the general public and the mainstream media. But this cannot be the answer.

I did not perpetrate property damage or instigate violence against the police on Saturday 26, and I do not support those who did. Equally, I don&apos;t believe it is always morally wrong to damage property as a response to injustices, such as the billions of pounds in tax avoided by the super-rich, or the continued failure to regulate the banking system or hold the banks to account. Unprovoked violence against the police is deplorable. But I have w it nessed the rapid it y w it h which confrontations between police and protesters escalate into confused and violent clashes, in which it is by no means the case that the police are not also the provacateurs. 

I, like the tens of thousands in the network (including Lucy Anderson and ‘Alex Pinkerman’), am not a ‘member’ or a ‘leader’ of UKUncut. We are UKUncut. And we cannot be spoken for.

 Asian Wing z And Food D*cks: A Trip To Angelo From Top Chef’s New Restaurant

 [details] [close] received 1 year ago  published 1 year ago  lang: en   Two weeks ago, Top Chef finalist and Crocadile Aficionado Angelo Sosa opened a new restaurant in midtown Manhattan called “Social Eatz” (SIC). Since Noah Garfinkel and I are both exquis it e connoisseurs of fine cuisine, Top Chef, and putting the letter Z on the end of thingz, we decided to take a trip to the Asian-inspired snack-food jaunt to sample some real-life Top Chef cooking, just like our moms (the lesbians from Top Chef Season 4) used to make. Social Eatz — named for it s laid-back-but-upscale ambiance and also Z — is located at 53rd st and 2nd Avenue, right in the heart of Manhattan’s “What The F*ck Is Over Here After 5 pm, Werewolves Or Something?” District. When we arrived at the restaurant , we couldn’t help but immediately notice that it ’s conveniently located right next to a not-unpornographic DVD depot: Immediately after entering, Noah used the bathroom to “wash his hands” (like the people in the vie wing booths next door – high fivez!), and he took note of the oddly suggestive Bathroom Door Food Gen it alia: While Noah was taking phone pictures of a hot dog and a taco drawn on a bathroom door, I amused myself w it h the menu, which did, to my immediate delight, have Z’s at the end of l it erally every section: The menu was an interesting cross-section of American snack foods — burgers, hot dogs, wing s, tacos, etc. — each “Asianified” to varying degrees, e it her w it h some Vietnamese-style vegetables or classic Korean sauces or just anything to make the dishes slightly unique and extremely Angelo. The place wasn’t too crowded (we were there on a Thursday at 2:30 pm), and the service was friendly and efficient, besides one absolutely irredeemable oversight: We ordered one thing from each of four sections: Hot Wing s (App’z), a Korean Beef Taco (Taco’z), a Bulgogi Burger (Burger’z), and an Imperialist Hot Dog (Signature’z). Below, our rambly IM’ed reviews of each it em: Noah: I actually feel like, after some days to think about it , that I don’t like it as much any more. Dan: The restaurant ? Noah: Yeah. Like, if there was a wing night, w it h more than five wing s, maybe i would go back. But I feel like if I want a hamburger or taco there’s places i would rather go. Dan: The concept is a l it tle strange, it ’s too formal to be casual and vice versa — the hamburger and taco were as good as other places’, but I’m not sure I’d rush to go back to east midtown, s it down, order a weirdburger and pay. From the Menu: Bulgogi l it erally means “fire meat” in Korean, the beef charred, hence the name. sauteed w it h soy, sugar, scallion, garlic and sesame oil then garnished w it h cooled cucumber kimchee, kewpee and a Japanese mayo Dan: That said, that burger was really, really good. Noah: Yes, but I think Shake Shack is probably still better. Dan: Probably, but it ’s the most famous burger place in New York – what’s wrong w it h having a different also great burger? Noah: There’s nothing wrong w it h it , it ’s just not what I would do. Dan: If you owned a restaurant ? Noah: No, if I was going to eat – I would rather have the most famous burger in New York than the very good, but not qu it e as good Angelo burger. Me: So when you get pizza, do you cab down to Grimaldi’s every time? Noah: No I do not go to that pizza place I have never been to before for pizza, I just go to some place near my house. But since ne it her Angelo’s restaurant or Shake Shack are near my house, I would go to Shake Shack if i were to purposefully wander out for food. Dan: There’s a new one right by our office. Noah: Let’s go there next time, and if you really really want we can bring a cucumber and bottle of sriracha sauce w it h us and you can have your l it tle-b it -Asian burger. Made w it h organic chicken, served on a toasty bun, smothered in sweet and spicy relish. Ah, sweet harmony Noah: The hot dog i thought was unique, w it h that cheese sauce, but once again, if i wanted a hot dog, I probably would not go to Angelo’s restaurant . Dan: I thought the first b it e was very weird, in a part-intriguing part-confusing way, but then it settled into a nice rhythm. Noah: Yes. And the eazy cheese sauce – DON”T FORGET ABOUT IT . Dan: “(Don’t You) Forget About Cheese”. Remember, from the L it erally Breakfast Club Soundtrack? I think we’ve sufficiently covered this it em. Vintage skirt steak marinated in a sweet or savory sauce of cane sugar and gochujang. served in warmed corn tortillas w it h spicy bean sprout kimchee Noah: The Endless Summertime Truck in Williamsburg I think has better tacos. Actually, I would prefer Taco Bell to that taco, although this is mostly because of a shredded carrot issue, but also because there was nothing awesome going on there. Dan: I think the taco was the least noteworthy of the group; it was tasty but not that different than just any readily available taco. Noah: I would argue that it was actually just not as good as many readily available tacos. Dan: We could call the review “Tac-OH NO!”? And include no explanation or pictures? Crispy wing s glazed in a sauce of tamarind, garlic, shallots, palm sugar and togarashi, a Japanese spice blend of red chili, roasted orange peel and black sesame Noah: But those chicken wing s, my God…I think about them all the time. Wing z! So crizpy. Dan: ZZZZZZZZZ… I don’t mean they were boring, I mean that is how many Z’s I’m giving them by our Ratingz Zystem. OVERALL: Noah: It boils down to, all the food was good, but not so overwhelming that I would go back for any of those things. Except the chicken wing s, but I wouldn’t even go back for that because I never just want 5 chicken wing s as a meal. I’m glad I ate there and it was fun, but I can’t imagine a scenario when i will go back. In the end, I thought it was just zo zo. Dan: Mmm, I disagree. Noah: I mean, it was all good, but I’m never like “ugh, why isn’t this food that i love a l it tle Asian, jeeeeeeez.” I fully encourage people to try it , I just feel like I will never be on the east side of midtown ever again, ever. Dan: No, me ne it her, and that’s my biggest issue w it h it — if I worked right near there, it ’d be perfect for a special lunch thing now and then, but I don’t think I’m gonna take a group of people there for a birthday dinner or anything. Noah: “I really wanted to open a restaurant for the employees of one of the biggest financial inst it utions in the world to eat at.” – Angelo. Dan: Plus that area after 5 pm is full of werewolves. Noah: I wouldn’t know. Dan: Fact. It ’s the major it y of their business. We capped off our meal w it h an absolutely awesome (though tiny) chocolate toffee brownie, and because Noah “The Food Was Zo-Zo” Garfinkel was so full, I had to heroically pound the milk shot that came w it h it : Before we left, we worked up the courage (nerve?) to ask the server if we could get a picture w it h Angelo — who we’d already seeing walking by w it h a canister of liquid n it rogen earlier in the meal — and Angelo happily obliged: We chatted w it h Angelo for like 30 seconds — I did note his black and metallic-gold shoes, to which he responded “They’re my sister’s – nah, kidding.” Our obligatory smalltalk consisted of us complimenting the meal, asking about the wing s’ crispiness, saying we were fans of the show, and after that we were pretty much on our way. Angelo was completely friendly and accommodating, juuust short of the point where I felt comfortable enough to ask him about the Z’s. Like any great things in life, though, they will forever remain a mister-z* (*not true about major it y of great things in life). As for the restaurant , in the end, Noah and I slightly disagreed; I thought the food at Social Eatz was excellent, interesting, and reasonably priced to boot, I just thought the dynamic of an upscale super-casual place was a l it tle odd, and I’m not sure how far out of my way I’d go for what amounts to a spin on very casual, very easily-acquirable-in-New-York American food. We both agreed that the wing s and brownie were the most outstanding dishes — the crispiness of the wing s seemed almost magical — followed by the burger, while the hot dog was a solid A-/B+ and the tacos were nothing special. So our recommendation? Somewhat inconclusive. But we certainly agreed on at least one thing: That is defin it ely a food d*ck on the bathroom door. 
 The Truth About Guns in Sw it zerland

In Sw it zerland—a nation in which a “well regulated Mil it ia” still plays a leading role in national defense—guns are a hot issue. A February referendum on new gun policy proposals quickly turned into a national debate on Sw it zerland’s gun culture and c it izen/soldier trad it ion. The resulting dialogue in this landlocked nation of mountains and lakes has been fascinating and shed light on some long-perpetuated myths about Sw it zerland’s gun laws.

 Responding to Tragedy 
In 2007, a broad alliance of approximately 80 NGOs launched the referendum effort w it h the backing of center-left pol it ical parties in the Swiss government. The referendum called for mil it ia firearms, which are now stored at home, to be stored in public arsenals. It also called for a national gun registry and a ban on the sale of fully automatic weapons and pump-action shotguns. Jacques de Haller, the president of the Swiss Medical Association, described the referendum as follows: “ It is about public health and suicide prevention. This is our core business, to save lives ... As we learn from observations in England, Scotland, Australia and Canada we can conclude that there is a correlation between stricter gun laws and fewer suicide cases w it h firearms. There is a lower suicide rate altogether .” Criminology professor Martin Killias of Zurich Univers it y added, “ I believe that if the in it iative was accepted and the guns would have to be depos it ed in arsenals, gun violence would decrease .”

Opponents of the referendum argued that it s proposals would undermine trust in the nation’s c it izen army. The Swiss government openly worried that soldiers wouldn’t complete mandatory mil it ia target practice if their guns weren’t handy. Right wing groups appealed to anti-immigrant feeling in the country, telling Swiss they had better remain armed against foreign criminals.

The pro-gun Swiss lobbying group Pro-Tell, for their part, sounded more like America’s National Rifle Association (NRA). “ No gun law will ever stop the crazy man from doing outrageous things ,” they counseled. Then gun rights activists in America interjected themselves into the debate w it h customary hyperbole: “ If this rush to disarmament continues, Swiss c it izens may awake one morning to find that an airborne army has taken control of their country .”

In truth—referendum or no referendum—Sw it zerland’s gun laws have been progressively tightening over the previous decade, in large part due to several high-profile cases of suicide and homicide. One such incident that alarmed the Swiss public was a 2006 murder-suicide involving champion skier Corinne Rey-Bellet. Rey-Bellet’s husband killed her and her brother w it h his mil it ia rifle before turning the gun on himself. Then, three days before the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, a Swiss man opened fire w it h his army rifle at a hotel restaurant in Baden, killing one and wounding four.

According to the Small Arms Survey, Sw it zerland ranks fourth in terms of gun ownership among nations, w it h 46 guns per 100 people. An estimated 600,000 Swiss c it izens engage in target shooting as a sport. There are consequences to this gun proliferation, however: Sw it zerland and Finland—another country w it h a high rate of gun ownership—typically compete for the highest annual rate of gun death in Western Europe.

 “ It was a question of national ident it y ” 
A January poll indicated that 52% of Swiss c it izens supported the gun policy referendum, w it h only 39% against it . But opponents of the referendum closed that gap quickly through grassroots organizing and successful message framing. When the Swiss finally voted on the referendum on February 13, it failed to pass, w it h 56.3% of voters and 20 of the 26 Swiss cantons (member states) rejecting it .

Swissinfo.ch read the result this way: “ Opponents of a motion to tighten Sw it zerland’s gun laws succeeded by framing the debate as a loss of freedom, secur it y, values and trad it ion .” “ A gun in the cellar has become a metaphor for a trad it ional, well-fortified and independent Sw it zerland ,” said the St. Galler Tagblatt .

Daniel Mockli, a secur it y expert at the Swiss Federal Inst it ute of Technology, expanded on the latter point: “ This is a country where you are both a c it izen and a soldier. We have a mil it ia here and the gun reflects a sense of responsibil it y and trust given you by the state. Here the debate on guns is about national secur it y, whereas in the U.S. it is about protecting yourself .”

Dora Andres, the president of Sw it zerland’s sports shooting association, alluded to Swiss fears of a “nanny state”: “ Sw it zerland is different. In many countries, the government doesn&apos;t trust it s c it izens and feels it has to protect them. In Sw it zerland, because we have a system of popular referendums, the state has to have fa it h in it s c it izens .&quot;

But ultimately, even for those on the far right wing of the debate, the vote was a referendum on the Swiss mil it ary establishment. The right wing Swiss People’s Party celebrated the vote by declaring that, “ A disarmed army is a weakened army. The Swiss people have recognized this. W it h today’s’ &apos;no&apos; on the weapons in it iative, they have clearly rejected those army abol it ionists .”

 Sw it zerland’s “Draconian” Laws 
What was conspicuously absent from Swiss reaction to the referendum was any suggestion that it was an affirmation of the right to individual self-defense.

In the Un it ed States, the Second Amendment’s “well-regulated Mil it ia,” which today is maintained by the states and federal government in the form of the National Guard, has been mythologized by the gun lobby into a loosely regulated system of individual gun ownership that contributes nothing whatsoever to the “ common defense .” Aggressive lobbying by the National Rifle Association (NRA) led the conservative wing of the Supreme Court to overturn 200 years of precedent in 2008 and assert that one need not serve in any mil it ia to enjoy a broad right to keep and bear arms. The NRA has been largely successful in convincing legislators and jurists that access to guns should be completely unfettered by any type of obligation to country or one’s fellow c it izens.

That’s not the case in Sw it zerland, where members of the mil it ia and private c it izens alike are tightly regulated in regards to gun ownership. Desp it e NRA claims like, “ young adults in Zurich are subject to minimal gun control ,” the truth is that Sw it zerland has very strict gun laws that American gun rights groups would consider “tyrannical.”

For starters, it ’s important to differentiate between mil it ary and private gun ownership...

In Sw it zerland, all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 30 are conscripted for three months and issued e it her an assault rifle or a 9mm pistol (the automatic or rapid-fire function is removed from these firearms so they fire only in semiautomatic mode) after completing basic mil it ary training. These firearms are kept in the home and are to be used only for mil it ary purposes, not for sports shooting or personal defense. After in it ial training, members of the mil it ia are required to do three or four weeks of mil it ary service a year until they have served a total of 260 days or reached age 34. Add it ionally, a law enacted in 2008 requires all army ammun it ion issued to mil it ia members to be stored in a central arsenal. This c it izen’s mil it ia complements a small number of full-time mil it ary personnel to const it ute Sw it zerland’s army.

Many Swiss men buy their service firearms after they finish mil it ary service. Since January 2010, however, they are required to obtain a perm it to do so, and must provide some justification for keeping the gun.

[Ed it or’s note: Swiss women may volunteer to serve in the armed forces and can now join all un it s, including combat troops. Currently 1,050 women are active-duty members of the Swiss mil it ary .]

Laws governing the private ownership of firearms are equally strict. In 1999, a federal law on arms, arms accessories, and ammun it ion (the Arms Act) came into effect. The Arms Act requires a perm it for each transaction involving firearms or relevant parts of firearms purchased from an authorized dealer&apos;s shop. Perm it s for purchasing firearms are issued by the cantons. Buyers are carefully screened and have to meet a number of requirements (i.e., minimum 18 years of age, absence of any apparent risk to the buyer or third persons, no entry in the Register of Convictions for violent crimes and/or misdemeanors, etc.). Subsequent transfers of firearms among private individuals have to be documented through a wr it ten contract, which must be kept for at least ten years. Add it ionally, several cantons require c it izens to register firearms.

Any person wishing to carry a gun in public must obtain a separate, special perm it from their canton. The screening process is essentially the same as for the purchase of firearms. In add it ion, applicants must demonstrate a leg it imate need to protect themselves, other persons, or goods against specific risks. Applicants must further pass two tests, one on the correct handling of firearms and one on legislation concerning the use of firearms. Perm it s are valid for five years. Certain exceptions to these rules are made for hunters, those performing mil it ary service, and those participating in shooting events.

In the Un it ed States, mil it ary weapons are more strictly controlled than in Sw it zerland. The National Guard and the regular Army are armed by the federal government and service members are not allowed—under any circumstances—to bring their weapons home or use them for personal self-defense.

But it ’s in the laws for private firearms ownership where the you can really see the real contrast w it h the Swiss system. In an overwhelming major it y of states in the Un it ed States:

 · Individuals w it h misdemeanor convictions (including for violent offenses) can legally buy guns and obtain perm it s to carry concealed handguns.

 · Those obtaining concealed handgun perm it s are not required to demonstrate any specific need (or threat) to carry a weapon in public.

 · Law enforcement officials have no individual discretion in denying gun purchases or concealed handgun perm it s.

 · Private sales/transfers of firearms are completely unregulated, w it h no background checks or paperwork required.

 · Only a handful of states require licensing and registration, and typically just for handguns.

 It is no surprise that the Un it ed States has an astronomically higher gun death rate than any other industrialized democracy. The cr it ical concept of civic duty—which is such a central element of Sw it zerland’s gun culture—has been eviscerated in the Un it ed States over time by the gun lobby.

 A Bold Persistence 
In Sw it zerland, the national debate about guns is not likely to go away anytime soon. Desp it e the failure of the recent referendum, it s proponents have no intention of giving up their campaign. Ebo Aebischer, a Reformed Church minister who works w it h families of suicide victims, said, “ We will be proposing a professional [rather than a conscript-based] mil it ary. If successful, such an in it iative would fulfill the demands of the current one: army weapons would no longer be allowed in the home and the expensive shooting practices would drop by the wayside. That way, the savings arising from the abol it ion of shooting practices could be invested in suicide prevention .”

Perhaps more importantly, younger Swiss are the most likely of any demographic to favor add it ional curbs on gun ownership. One president of a pistol shooters association, perhaps indicating what the future holds, recently said the average age in Swiss gun clubs is now “ closer to 50 than to 40 .”

Over thirty years ago I became intrigued w it h insect flight. I had been constructing my own hi-speed flash guns when I saw a remarkable book by pioneering photographer Stephen Dalton Called ‘ Borne on the Wind’ where, through a collaboration w it h electronics engineer Ron Perkins he had begun to produce remarkable images sho wing the way insects ‘rowed’ their way through the air. These have been followed w it h incredible shots of animals of all sorts.

 Today, w it h an off-the shelf DSLR you can get some pretty impressive insect shots and if you invest in something like the Phototrap™   (reviewed in my next post) the only lim it s are your ingenu it y.

 The No-Frills Approach 

In the early summer heat here in It aly, Hummingbird Hawkmoths ( Macroglossum stellaturum ) tirelessly work the flowers of lavender bushes and, later in the year, the B uddleja bushes.

I have real affection for these beautiful l it tle insects and their mastery of flight since, years ago, when based in Cyprus, I used to watch how they would vis it an outdoor restaurant table to probe at the sugar incrustation left on the rim of a glass of brandy sour. I have seen them at the coast and then flying close to sunny, warm cliff faces at alt it udes of 2000m and more in mountains, where they rise on thermals.

 

Leaving the camera unattended in the hot sun was not a good idea so I did not set up the phototrap. Instead, I  used the Auto FP facil it y w it h a SB900 nikon flash - one of those amazing features not trumpeted loudly. W it h Auto FP (FP = Focal Plane) mode on a Nikon D300 and other cameras you can use a flash synch speed of 1/320 th and higher (up to 1/8000 th sec) w it h guns such as the SB 900, 800, 600 and the SB200 macro flash.

 It worked like this... first set the camera on manual exposure: do this to get the background illumination right and integrate flash and ambient light seamlessly. The background beneath the Buddleja bush was in shade so the flash provided the illumination. Camera plus flash was set on a tripod so I could tilt it to alter field of view and focus manually – the Nikon 105mm f/2.8 VR macro is fast to focus w it h AF but still hunts slightly.

The trick is to wa it aiming at a su it able flower and watch what comes along. The h it rate was very good circa 50%. The technique is easy and effective and can be modified to su it . It is surprising how many overlook this hidden high-speed synch capabil it y tucked away in the camera menu…I did.

 

 What goes on inside... 

As many will know, w it h a focal plane (FP) shutter the synch speed is lim it ed because the flash has to fire when both shutter curtains are wide open. It is a mechanical nightmare and the reason that shutter synch speeds are usually around 1/250 th at their fastest. If you try to use a higher speed you just get a strip illuminated as the curtains chase one another. The copal-type shutter used in rangefinder cameras (and Zeiss lenses for the Hasselblad gives a much faster synch speed.

Nikon engineers have effectively ‘lengthened’ the flash pulse so that the subject is then illuminated for the full time that the shutter curtains are travelling across the sensor. It is not a single long flash but a series of extremely rapid, sequential pulses. To achieve this the flash output power is reduced: Nikon do not just stop at a minimum synch speed of 1/320 th (the default when Auto FP is set) sec you can work up to 1/8000 th sec…

W it h Auto FP the Nikon metering system takes care of ambient light, too when the “TTL. BL” (balanced TTL) option is used. It is ingenious, to say the least and a feature not trumpeted loudly

For anyone w it h a Nikon system who wants to read more there is a very useful article here by Russ MacDonald 

 A more adventurous approach: Triggered Flash and insects in flight 

 
 

I have long used auto flash guns on manual and adjust the power ratio control to can get some very fast flash times. W it h fractional power the flash duration is shortened (and power reduced) by diverting some of the electrical energy provided by the capac it or into a ‘quench’ tube. 

 

For info, here is a table that gives the pulse durations at reduced power for a Nikon SB900 – data for other guns times will be similar since the trigger/quench circu it ry used will not differ much – just component values in terms of capac it or size and so on.

 

I used this technique to get the shots of large sphinx moths - Convolvulus Hawks ( Agrius convolvuli) - in flight in low light when the flash took care of all exposure and there was no need to worry about ambient light.

I discovered a form of photography that su it ed me down to the ground. It involved setting up Nikon D300 camera plus SB900 flash and an Infrared trigger device called a Phototrap ™ ...then settling down w it h a large glass of red wine and wa it ing in the encroaching twilight (the really testing part). I’ll post a separate review of this phototrap in a day or so – it is worth it .

 

A slight ‘dipping’ movement of the tobacco flowers (Nicotiana) heralds the arrival of the vis it ors at dusk for their rapid wing movement generates a breeze that make the flowers wobble. It increases your sense of anticipation....if he small child w it hin is still there.

The task - to capture a convolvulus hawkmoth in flight involved ‘thinking’ like a moth … where would I put my proboscis if I wanted nectar...as it were. It was not difficult to work out where to place the camera, the trigger and wa it for the action. Getting pin-point sharpness was a b it more tricky and needed persistence

The very first picture showed just part of the moth against the background of a dry stone wall, the second captured it , revealing a proboscis that must have been some 12 cm long. For two weeks this became the nightly routine and I got to recognize the three individual moths that came. No, I did not give them names!

 

This is a return to something that I experimented w it h three decades ago when, as a one-time physicist, I built my own flashguns and, indeed, a flash meter (not a thing of compact beauty). They were hardly portable, fired on 3,000 V and exploded like a rifle going off ...leaving the distinct smell of ozone in the air – lethal, you betcha, don’t try this at home kids. How much easier it is now w it h the Nikon SB 900 set on manual at 1/16 th power, a flash duration of about /10,000 th sec w it h sufficient light to give exposure at f/22 and /250 th sec. What pampered folk we are.

 I shall post a detailed, updated review of the Phototrap in a day or so

 PHOTOS BY JEN FARIELLO &quot;In my 1978 yearbook quote,&quot; says Oliver Kuttner. &quot;I said, &apos;Try and you&apos;ll make it .&apos; That&apos;s been my personal it y the whole time,&quot;   
The 49-year-old real estate and automobile developer, who won a $5 million prize in automobile innovation, has been chosen by the Hook&apos;s news team as the Person of the Year, the individual who most affected the news in 2010.




 The racer 

If his name Oliver Kuttner conjures some sharp associations, there&apos;s good reason. He&apos;s the one whose tussles w it h the Charlottesville Board of Arch it ectural Review became legendary-- so legendary that he packed his toolk it and took his urban visions to Lynchburg. But if building development brought him to that James River C it y, it was also the place he&apos;d reconnect w it h an old love: automotive innovation.

&quot;I wanted the fastest car-- but I couldn&apos;t afford to buy it . So I built it ,&quot; Kuttner recalls of his teenaged desire for speed.

Kuttner built his first car in high school. During college, he spent countless hours in his dorm room tinkering w it h car engines, trying to get it right. &quot;By my junior year in college, I made a car that went 160 miles per hour,&quot; he recalls. And before getting things really right by winning $5 million in the Progressive Automotive X Prize, Kuttner took third-- as a racer in a World Championship level race in e it her 1996 or 1997-- he can&apos;t qu it e remember which year the race was held.

&quot;I never became a great race car driver, but very few can say that they got third place in a World Championship race,&quot; notes Kuttner.

But Kuttner was not one to settle for a third place finish, no matter how illustrious the race.

&quot;At that point I decided that I&apos;m not a race car driver-- it was very clear. Too old, too big, too heavy, just outclassed,&quot; he explains. &quot;I wasn&apos;t going to dedicate my life to something if I wasn&apos;t going to win the gold.&quot;

There&apos;s a mantra Kuttner repeats frequently, one heard when he owned a body shop in downtown Charlottesville. &quot;If somebody&apos;s made it before, you can make it . It &apos;s just a question of figuring out how.&quot;

&quot;That&apos;s one of the rules that says you can go race in the World Championship race against Cadillac and Ferrari,&quot; even if you don&apos;t have impressive credentials, Kuttner says. &quot;I wasn&apos;t supposed to be there. Once you understand that, you&apos;re willing to take different challenges.&quot;
 
Runners Up

 Teresa Sullivan 

 


Coping w it h the high profile deaths of Morgan Harrington and Yeardley Love, the suicide of the managing ed it or of the Virginia Quarterly Review amid allegations of workplace bullying, and Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli&apos;s demands over controversial climate scientist Michael Mann&apos;s work were just a few of the issues facing brand new UVA prez Teresa Sullivan even as she unpacked her bags after arriving on the job in August. Let&apos;s hope she and Spiderman learned the same lesson: &quot;W it h great power comes great responsibil it y&quot;--- and may she continue to wield it wisely in 2011!




 Tom Perriello 

 


The hometown boy put the kibbosh on Virgil Goode back in 2008, but he couldn&apos;t pull off a repeat underdog victory against Robert Hurt this year, even w it h a presidential vis it to Charlottesville four days before the election. Still, in just two short years, Perriello made his mark in Washington, voting to pass healthcare reform, asking the president to fire the treasury secretary, and supporting the War on Terror-- and he promises we haven&apos;t heard the last of him.




 Halsey Minor 

 


A few years ago, Halsey Minor, founder of CNet, was best known for having heaps of money. These days, Minor may be better known for his heaps of lawsu it s-- and in Charlottesville, for a hulking skeleton building on the Downtown Mall. Maybe 2011 is the year the Landmark Hotel will get finished? Eh? Anyone?




 Maurice Jones 

 


Hello, new c it y manager! After years working as a sportscaster for NBC29 then at the Miller Center, Jones spent the last two years learning the ropes as assistant c it y manager before clinching the big job--- and $170,000 salary--- earlier this month. Congrats, Mo!




 Mered it h Richards 

 


Just call her the l it tle engine that could: former c it y councilor Mered it h Richards has made rail travel her raison d&apos;etre , and in 2010, she saw the fru it of her labor w it h the wild success of the Regional Northeast Train for which she&apos;d long advocated. Richards has also been a driving force behind Amtrak&apos;s hope to run the Cardinal daily instead of thrice weekly. Choo-choo!




 Rosa Atkins 

 


In her fifth year as superintendent of Charlottesville C it y Schools, Atkins-- who was recently named Virginia Superintendent of the Year by the Virginia Association of School Superintendents-- has accomplished something long discussed but not acted upon: reverting c it y elementary schools back to a K-5 model and creating one middle school. The topic was extra controversial since it &apos;s less than 20 years since the K-5 model was abandoned in favor of single schools for grades 5-6 (Walker Upper Elementary) and grades 7-8 (Buford Middle School).




 Dave Norris 

 


He might be a Democrat just like every other member of c it y council, but Mayor Dave Norris doesn&apos;t always go w it h the flow, and he&apos;s not afraid to ruffle a few feathers. He did it this year by forcing dredging into the controversial water supply plan and for advocating for a stricter panhandling ban on the Downtown Mall even as many progressives have pos it ioned themselves on the other side of those issues. Will his independent ways hurt him next election?




 The water group 

 


They don&apos;t wear peace signs, and they don&apos;t smoke bongs outside c it y hall, but Betty Mooney, Dede Sm it h, Bob Fenwick, Richard Lloyd, Rebecca Quinn, and a slew of others have shown that the days of c it izen activism didn&apos;t end along w it h the 1960s. Through sheer determination-- and their constant presence at any number of water related meetings-- this loosely organized consortium has managed to get a once-done deal reconsidered-- and may have helped save local taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. If that doesn&apos;t inspire you to get out and advocate for something you care about, what will?




 Jim Baldi 

 


All the neighbors of Belmont music hall and eatery Bel Rio wanted was for late night loud music to disappear. Owner Jim Baldi, however, took things a b it further this past summer and made himself disappear, leaving an arrest warrant in his absence and former clients and business partners gnashing their teeth over allegedly missing money. Where&apos;s Baldi? Maybe he&apos;ll turn up next year!




 Mark Brown 

 


Just when it looked like the Charlottesville Ice Park would go the way of Planet Fun and close forever, entrepreneur Mark Brown stepped in and saved the day, buying the whole shebang for $3.1 million and turning it into a multi-use facil it y now known as the Main Street Arena. The once low-profile property owner also helped launch a commun it y conversation about panhandling by working on an ad campaign that would have encouraged giving to organizations rather than individuals-- and by hiring patrons of downtown day shelter The Haven to lay down the floor for events. N&apos;ice!




 Peter Chang 

 


When Peter Chang popped up in Albemarle Square&apos;s Taste of China restaurant earlier this year, he prompted a foodie frenzy of epic proportions only to disappear just as suddenly as he&apos;d come. After months of speculation, in November, Chang formally announced his plan to open his own place in the former Wild Greens space in the North Wing of Barracks Road Shopping Center. Let the frenzy begin again!




 Hunter Craig 

 


When Hunter Craig headed up a group of investors to buy Biscu it Run farm in 2006 for $46.2 million, they broke a record for largest land deal in Albemarle County. In the final days of 2009, they may have broken a record for best wiggling out of an investment gone south. The State&apos;s $9.8 million purchase of the land for use as a state park might at first glance have appeared to mean a disastrous financial loss for Craig and his fellow investors, including DMB manager Coran Capshaw and fiddler Boyd Tinsley, but if you add in the value of land use tax cred it s-- the amount of which may never be known-- Craig and company may well have pulled off the deal of the century.




 George Huguely 

 


The actions of the men&apos;s lacrosse player on the night of May 3, 2010 ended the life of women&apos;s lacrosse player Yeardley Love and brought further national media attention of the wrong kind to UVA, already reeling from the disappearance and death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington. This month, Time magazine included Huguely&apos;s deed in it s top 10 crimes of 2010.




 Peter Van der Linde 

 


Dude knows how to talk trash. After investing millions in his trash sorting Murf, Van der Linde spent the last several years battling the powers that be for the right to do business. He scored big in 2010 as the area&apos;s biggest trash haulers finally saw the wisdom in his ways, and even the c it y-- whose leaders once hounded him via a Rivanna Solid Waste Author it y lawsu it -- broke down and started trucking trash to his sorting facil it y.   




 Ted Genoways 

 


The ed it or of the VQR was accustomed to fawning praise after leading the l it erary magazine to a variety of prestigious national awards, but the suicide of the magazine&apos;s managing ed it or this past summer amid allegations of workplace bullying cast Genoways as a villain who&apos;d alienated his staff. An investigation by the univers it y cr it icized his management style but cleared him of serious wrongdoing, and Genoways remains at the helm of the magazine, which will likely begin publishing again early in 2011.




 Patricia Kluge 

 


Housing slump? Apparently Patricia Kluge hadn&apos;t heard about that when she put her sprawling Albemarle House estate on the market last spring for a jaw-dropping $100 million. The price is now down to $24 million, and Kluge&apos;s money woes have made headlines all year, w it h auctions of her gl it zy belongings and the recent foreclosure of her Kluge Estate Winery and Vineyards.




 Elisha Strom 

 


Is she a stalker or a c it izen activist? Whatever you call her, blogger Elisha Strom is a thorn in the side of the local law enforcement departments w it h her I HeArTE JADE webs it e on which she has detailed the private lives and addresses of various officers. So far, though, the law seems to be on her side. While she spent a month in jail follo wing an arrest last summer, she was most recently cleared of stalking charges this month w it h the judge and even her own attorney acknowledging her blogging behavior is &quot;bizarre&quot; --- but falls under Const it utionally protected free speech.




 John Wh it ehead 

 


This year was a big one for Rutherford Inst it ute founder John Wh it ehead, who found love again and married longtime Rutherford Inst it ute employee Nisha Mohammed follo wing the 2009 death of his wife. Wh it ehead once again made national headlines by filing a legal objection to the invasive searches being conducted by the TSA in the name of secur it y. Locally, Wh it ehead&apos;s organization is fighting the red light cameras installed at the intersection of Rio Road and Route 29N.
 



 The thorn 

Challenge is a familiar landscape for Kuttner. The last decade saw him battling c it y bureaucracy more often than not in his years spent developing massive downtown buildings. In the late 1990s, he created the Terraces, a mixed-use project over the former Woolworth&apos;s space on the Downtown Mall that appears much smaller than it s 60,000 square feet. Around 2001, he converted the former Cavalier Beverage headquarters into the today&apos;s multi-use Glass Building, another 35,000 square feet of space, this one w it h the X Lounge as it s anchor tenant.

&quot;You have to have a lot of ego to continue building when someone tells you to stop a dozen times,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve been there, when I made a big bet and everyone says, &apos;No, this isn&apos;t going to fly.&apos;&quot;

Indeed, Kuttner displayed a stubbornness to get the job done his way. His Glass Building taunted naysayers as an early retail outpost not just past-the-railroad-tracks but immediately adjacent to Friendship Court, a subsidized housing project. Today, the Glass Building appears to have launched a commercial rev it alization in an area now known to shoppers as the &quot;Warehouse District.&quot;

According to Kuttner, there was never an instance of vandalism-- and, in fact, he welcomed the children from the housing project once known as Garrett Square into the construction space after working hours were over.

&quot;I&apos;d give them something to do, give them two or three bucks-- there were some that were regular. You could see that a lot of the kids were hungry for a male role model.&quot;

The boundary-pushing Kuttner-- all six feet, four inches of him-- might not strike the Planning Commission or the Board of Arch it ectural Review as the ideal role model. But the developer stuck to his convictions and created spaces for local businesses to thrive.

&quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;m radical-- a lot of people have it in them, they just don&apos;t dare to do it ,&quot; Kuttner says. &quot;I&apos;m a l it tle more outspoken, but this is where my parents come in. If you are raised by people who are there when you absolutely need them, you have a secur it y, so that you can go to the edge a l it tle more. Your willingness to take chances is directly proportional to your confidence, where you stand.&quot;

Kuttner simultaneously cred it s luck and upbringing for his success. &quot;A lot of what we do is luck, where we fall on the planet, when we fall there,&quot; he says. But ultimately it is the developer&apos;s slightly impatient nature-- his need for action now that drives his endeavors.

&quot; It is luck, but then you have to make something of it ,&quot; he continues.   Oliver Kuttner, a speed demon in all senses, has no patience for wa it ing.




 The car 

When the Progressive Automotive X Prize was announced in 2007, all systems were go for Kuttner. The developer, who had recently relocated to Lynchburg from an allegedly bureaucracy-laden Charlottesville (C it y officials asserted that he simply wouldn&apos;t follow the rules), found both his renegade nature and his need for speed provoked. The grand prize-- $5 million-- was enough to persuade Kuttner to call up some old racing friends and assemble a team w it h the expertise and the make- it -happen drive to create what would become the Very Light Car, 2010&apos;s X Prize winner.   

&quot;A lot of it has to do w it h luck-- what we did is something that&apos;s going to happen, and if we didn&apos;t do it , someone would do it ,&quot; explains Kuttner. &quot;What we&apos;re doing is defined by the laws of physics-- what put us there was the big prize. That&apos;s what got my interest.&quot;

In the months since September, after the Very Light Car-- a vehicle that weighs approximately one quarter the weight of a Mini Cooper-- won the prize, Kuttner and his crew, Edison2, have found themselves walking the cusp of a peculiar precipice-- courting international acclaim and attention while still dealing w it h the daily duties of automotive engineering.

The car is now in the re-design phase, where the team is tweaking and refining it s shape and size to f it mainstream needs.

&quot;We&apos;ve taken the car beyond the car you know, making it more customer friendly,&quot; Kuttner says. &quot; It &apos;s becoming awesome.&quot;

A full scale mock-up of version two is in the works, and all aspects of the car are being re-imagined to f it new and developing standards.

&quot;We&apos;re getting telephone calls from people w it h the open minds, from the ones who are going to be fans, in high places and in the right places,&quot; he boasts like a proud parent. &quot;The loss is for the ones who choose not to look at it . I&apos;ve been down that road before where I know this is going to happen; it just takes time.&quot;

Kuttner and his car have been met w it h skepticism, cr it icism, and push-back from all corners of the industry-- and the innovator willingly adm it s that his is not the be-all, end-all solution to the automotive crisis facing society. The Very Light Car is just the beginning, he says, and even if his contribution is done, he believes it represents the future of the automobile.

&quot;One of the biggest contributions of the car is that we showed that it can be done,&quot; he says. &quot;You don&apos;t have to agree that it &apos;s what you would buy or that it &apos;s the most elegant solution, but we&apos;re sho wing that we can do it .&quot;




 Thorn again 

&quot;What separates me from a lot of people is my willingness to take the next step and do something,&quot; says Kuttner. &quot; It involves risk.&quot;

Risk is another landscape familiar to Kuttner. It defined everything he did w it h his real estate in Charlottesville; it underlines his current project, the decision to cut back on his holdings and divest himself of 11 properties. In 2010, it was the headline for his innovations w it h Edison2: Huge Risk W it h Even Bigger Potential Payoff-- not only for Kuttner and his team.

Kuttner and Edison2 showed the world it could be done-- a car that can meet federal and state safety and emission standards while getting 100 plus miles to the gallon. But that doesn&apos;t mean America is entirely ready.

&quot;I&apos;m a thorn in the side of General Motors now,&quot; Kuttner says, c it ing a recent effort by eco-agencies to push the fuel efficiency standards higher, using the Very Light Car as proof of it s possibil it y. &quot;The Sierra Club is pushing a standard that&apos;s off the charts, saying, &apos;If this guy can do it and you say you can&apos;t...&apos;&quot;

Kuttner asserts that American companies are dragging their feet to offer support or lend credibil it y to the car which he contends can be affordably mass-produced.

&quot;We&apos;re starting to have serious inquiries from serious people, mostly from far away, asking &apos;Can we buy a license for it , can we hire you?&apos;&quot; says Kuttner.

The developer can&apos;t qu it e understand why American companies aren&apos;t ready to take the plunge into the future. According to him, supporting a development like this is a no-brainer-- just as developing a building across the train tracks from the Downtown Mall made sense for certain local businesses.

But Kuttner hasn&apos;t just made waves for the X Prize. Less than a month after being feted on national television including appearances on NBC&apos;s Today show and the PBS Newshour , Kuttner was pulled over for a traffic stop in Lynchburg-- then handcuffed and arrested.

&quot;I was not in a good mood that day-- I was pissed off,&quot; explains Kuttner, who reportedly asked for his ticket and then attempted to rush off to a pre-arranged appointment. &quot;But the guy pulls me over and doesn&apos;t tell me why-- I got the right to know.&quot;

Kuttner wonders if his striking size and personal it y may have provoked Officer Nathan Godsie into calling for backup. And he speculates that the fact that his car&apos;s passengers were two black men might have inc it ed the officer to pull him over in the first place.

&quot;His point was that he saw me as a very large guy who wasn&apos;t necessarily being friendly, and he was going to show me who was boss,&quot; says Kuttner. &quot; It doesn&apos;t feel good when you&apos;re being handcuffed. I didn&apos;t resist-- but then somebody hurts you, not just once, but three times,&quot; he says. &quot;He hurt me badly.&quot;

Godsie&apos;s not speaking, but Kuttner&apos;s complaint did launch an official c it y investigation which cleared Godsie and left the charges against Kuttner intact. Now, he faces an obstruction of justice charge in add it ion to problem that started it all: an expired plate.

Still, Kuttner openly praises the Lynchburg police for keeping his home and commun it y safe.

&quot;I&apos;m glad the police exist-- I&apos;m able to go home tonight and know my home is in good shape,&quot; he says. &quot;I do think there is another way to communicate, but I can also see it from his point.&quot;

Kuttner&apos;s scheduled to appear in court on the charges in early January. But for a man who&apos;s singleminded when pursuing his passions, it seems unlikely that this type of image setback will affect his larger goals. The Very Light Car, and the impact it could have on the mainstream automotive industry, provides Kuttner more than enough daily challenges.

&quot;I&apos;m very happy to be where I am,&quot; Kuttner smiles. &quot;I&apos;m given the opportun it y to make a difference, but just because I know how to make a car better doesn&apos;t mean I know how to do everything else better. It took a lifetime to get where I am, but it just fell in my lap.&quot;

Desp it e his optimism for the Very Light Car, and his uncompromising comm it ment to see it to the next level, Kuttner doesn&apos;t expect everyone to like him along the way. But who says he wants them to?

&quot;I&apos;m a thorn in the side of people who don&apos;t want to change, and I&apos;m a breath of fresh air for someone who actually wants to make a difference,&quot; he says flatly. &quot;This has been my life. Some people really like me, and others would rather that I never brought up a subject.&quot;







 Kuttner&apos;s solutions: Oliver offers advice on three of Charlottesville&apos;s Nagging Problems 




 On the C it y Market: 

 which has been seeking a permanent home for at least a decade 

Kuttner wants to put the farmer&apos;s market smack on Monticello Avenue-- a road that he alleges was grossly over-engineered w it h four lanes and a wide median in a planning era that emphasized speed over commun it y.

&quot;That was a misguided planning exercise,&quot; says Kuttner. &quot;You can land an airplane on it .&quot;




 On the local water supply 

 which p it s Charlottesville Mayor Dave Norris against Albemarle County 

Ever since the record drought of 2002, local consumers have been consuming less, and Kuttner wants to dredge the existing Rivanna Reservoir rather than building a massive new dam and uphill pipeline, a scheme favored by County interests.

&quot;The reason I know for a fact that the reservoir needs to be dredged is that when I was a crew coach for UVA, there were areas that my students would say, &apos;Three years ago, we could go out further, and now we can&apos;t.&apos; I saw the encroachment, and I know not dredging it as maintenance was a fool&apos;s game.&quot;

Kuttner would like to see the dredgers sell the excavated sand and dirt.




 On the unfinished Landmark hotel: 

 which has stood as an empty shell for about two years 

Kuttner disagrees w it h the conventional wisdom that the low ceiling heights preclude conversion into apartments. The Kuttnerian solution is simply to turn over two of the eleven floors for mechanical systems to free up at least a foot of ceiling height on the remaining floors.

&quot;Plenty of arch it ects will say you can&apos;t make it into something,&quot; says Kuttner. &quot;The 11 floors have already been built, so make it a nine-floor building where you can walk into the mechanical space. You could make a phenomenal thing, one of the most energy-efficient buildings in history if you suddenly have all this space to do stuff.&quot;

• From Al Cimaglia on the Chicago Blackhawks : &quot;The Marty Turco bandwagon should be about empty by now as Corey Crawford  came on in relief to almost save the day.

• Scott Bowman on Detro it Red Wing s defenseman/legend Nicklas Lidstrom : &quot;The thing I always said about Nick, for all the points he&apos;s had, his offense has been so good, but the thing that&apos;s always amazed me about him is that very, very seldom have I seen Nick caught up ice. Very seldom does he leave his partner alone.&quot; [ ESPN ]

Interesting b it from Rich Hammond: &quot;When the Kings went through their 1-6-0 slump last month, they were outscored 12-3 in the third periods of those games. Now, in their recent 4-0-1 streak, they have outscored opponents 7-1 in the third period.&quot; [ LA Kings Insider ]

• Via the great Ian Walker, Mike Sm it h of the Tampa Bay Lightning on the funniest thing he&apos;s ever heard on the ice: &quot;Another good question. I don&apos;t know ...

It was 8-7 and I was in for the last three and I asked Scott Hartnell if we were on Punked because it felt like there were soccer nets in here and he said, &quot;Mix in a save.&quot; [ Vancouver Sun ] 

• Interesting stuff on the Carolina Hurricanes , attendance and revenue: &quot;According to a recent report published by the Triangle Business Journal, the Hurricanes&apos; revenue dropped by over 25% from 2008-09 to 2009-10.  Of course much of that is to be expected because the team failed to make it to the post season last year, while they made it to the Eastern Conference Finals the year before. That fact alone is going to drastically affect all of Carolina&apos;s financial statements. &quot; [ Canes Country ]

• Finally, another victory for John Scott of the Blackhawks against David Koci of the Colorado Avalanche , who actually did qu it e well to overcome his obvious disadvantage of being David Koci in this fight: [ Hockey Fights ]

 It is w it h b it tersweet emotions that I s it and wr it e my last article as the club’s president, wrapping up an exc it ing two years filled w it h fun, fishing, friends. I do plan to take a l it tle step back after December to catch my breath, but on the example of many past presidents, I plan to jump right back in w it h helping next year’s leadership. You would think that I would have had ample time to prepare my closing message. Instead, I s it here stung by wr it er’s block wondering where to go w it h my message.

First, I want to remind everyone about the Christmas Party and Annual Fundraiser coming up on Tuesday, December 14th at Alamo Café on Highway 281. (Note that we had to move the date to Tuesday, due to unforeseen conflicts.) The party will be from 6-9 PM and is sure to be one of the best yet! Go on our web s it e for more details (www.alamoflyfishers.org) and make sure you call or send me an e-mail to RSVP, so we can get a good head count prior to the party.

Of course, we can’t mention the Christmas Party w it hout recognizing all of our great sponsors that continue to help out and support our club year after year. Our sponsors are given ad space at the end of our newsletter, so be sure to stop in and thank them all the next time you are in their shop. Our club sends out a great big “Thank You” in advance to all of our club’s supporters, since they are in large part the financial wheels that keep our club running year to year. Keep an eye out in the January newsletter for a full page “Thank you” to publicly recognize each of this year’s sponsors. Make sure you return the favor next time you are in need of fly tying gear, rods, reels, guided trips or anything else they can help you w it h. Support those that support us!

The easiest direction to go from here is to outline the accomplishments of the past two years. I can take very l it tle cred it for these successes, as they were made possible by the silent cast members that work tirelessly in the trenches and shadows of our club every day. If you have seen the small groups on Tying Tuesdays huddled together off to the side for brainstorming and planning sessions, you know what I mean. So, there is much more to address than just the accomplishments of the club. We need to recognize those who are responsible for these accomplishments. There is a b it of a risk in naming names, for fear that I will leave someone out, so please bear w it h me and forgive me if you are not mentioned. I feel the risk is worth taking to publically thank those who have truly changed our club for the better. So, a very personal thank you to…

- Gabe Avalos for unselfishly representing our club for the third year at the Boy Scout Powderhorn event, patiently teaching a group why we love to tie flies.
- David Beck for all of your help w it h Trout Days this past year (and for sharing the secret spot)! We have a lot to live up to this year. Thanks also for sharing your knowledge of Alaska.
- Joe Filer for your active role w it h GRTU and for lending a hand whenever you can. Thanks also for allo wing me to serve as your VP and teaching me the ropes.
- Steve Flanagan for your leadership w it h FFF and in helping to bring the Expo closer to home. You have shared your amazing talents and made many of us better tyers. You have also played a huge part as one of the main tyers w it h PHW and as a river helper w it h Casting for Recovery…you have truly taken both programs to heart.
- Todd Fleming for…well, everything. You have served nearly every pos it ion in the club, play an active role w it h FFF and Casting for Recovery and have helped at every opportun it y possible. You continue to take new members under your wing . You continue to be a mentor and inspiration for us all. You pour your heart and soul into this club every day!
- Jay Forrest for being the liaison to our bellies and for helping to set up a fabulous restaurant for the last two year’s January dinner meeting. Thank you also for your active support of CFR.
- Clay Gill for just being you. Your love of fly fishing is contagious, your advice is sound and unselfish and you are always there to help, no matter what we need.
- Mike Lee for being my technical sounding board, even when you were half a nation away. You have made our web s it e the best ever!
- Lloyd Mathews for your exhausting efforts in helping to get the Project Healing Waters [PHW] program up and running at BAMC. Spend a Monday afternoon w it h the soldiers and you can feel the difference the program makes in their lives.
- David McWilliams for being an awesome Vice President. You made my life easy this year and brought some fun and exc it ing new speakers to the table. Thanks also for your excellent outing photography!
- Joe M it chell for the fresh and exc it ing outings ideas you brought to life this year and for stepping in whenever we needed help. I can’t wa it to see the great new ideas you will bring to the club next year!
- Ed Niehaus for your tireless efforts on the conservation front. You have given our club great visibil it y w it h the right groups and have worked hard to give back to Mother Nature every chance you can.
- Andy Niland for always stepping in when we need help, especially during our annual donation round up and when we need club advice. You have been an active supporter of CFR. Thank you also for taking our newsletter to the next level…the best ever. You have big shoes to fill for next year!
- Mark Paulson for your generos it y and time in supporting the club, especially during the annual donation time.
- Walter Ross for representing our club well at Trout Days and the Houston Fly Tying Festival. Thanks also for sharing your knowledge of Alaska in your presentation.
- Bill Slough for always lending a hand and for being ever willing to share your knowledge of the Silver King!
- Bruce Young for always being there when we need advice in all things fly fishing and for unselfishly giving back to the club and for supporting CFR. You constantly give through your teaching and tying, especially w it h new members. Oh yeah…and for being the official meeting start whistle!

There are many others in the club, both past and present, that have made a difference in our club. Always remember that this club belongs to all of us, and it can be whatever we make it through using our passion and talents to leave things better than we found them. I challenge each of you to use the people listed above as great examples and mentors on how each of us can impact the club in great ways. Find something you love and run w it h it …you will be amazed at what a difference it can make. I tip my hat to everyone in the club for making the past two years a wonderful experience.

See you on the water!

After the new cold open, it ’s back to intro as usual — Sidenote: won’t a billion more people see the chefs on Top Chef than in Food and Wine Magazine, the prize? — and then it ’s off to the Quickfire, w it h special guest smiler Joe Jonas: Wa it , I thought the Jonas Brothers were murdered by the record labels and re-Frankensteined together to make Justin Bieber? Why did someone tell me that? E it her way, he’s there to judge the first Kidz Challengz of the year: For the Quickfire, the chefs have to make a midnight snack for kids sleeping overnight at the American Museum Of Natural History’s annual “Night At The Museum” event, popularized of course by this movie. The catch: The kids have no utensils, and also they’re insane because they’re kids: The chefs get to cooking while still taking turns being wowed by the multiplatinum recording artist (FYI: record companies changed that term to refer to any band that’s sold over 50 physical cds), even though Dale’s like “I thought he was a pastry chef.” Yeah, of SWOON CAKE. Tiffani is making a dessert that’s like if “A Snowball, a Moon Pie, and a Rice Krispie Treat had a threesome.” Make sure you explain it to the kids that way, Tiffani. And be prepared to answer their follow-up question, “Does the Moon Pie have to masturbate while the Rice Krispie Treat is going down on the Snowball?” Michael Isabella is making “F*cking f*ck chocolate polenta bars f*ck,” but his struggles don’t stop him from saying that Casey’s chocolate lasagna makes him want to throw up. You are serving kids cornmeal, dude — have you ever seen/been a child? Just order Domino’s and coast to immun it y (f*ck). As for the two favor it es, Richard is making, I don’t know, n it rogen chicken fingers or something, and Angelo is making “Cheese Crisps 2010: The New Evolution.” If this was a compet it ion for Top Dork, Padma would tell those guys “Please acquire add it ional knives and stay!” The winner of the Quickfire is announced: It ’s a tie between Tiffani and Spike! Maybe Spike’s finally turned his brim around and become a great chef? Oops! His restaurant is still called that: Wasn’t that the name of like eight challenges in the DC season? (Kidding – I know for sure that it was). The chefs pair off into teams (they just pick teams, still no crazy themes – looks like they’ve d it ched the arb it rary themes forever and ever…(FORESHADO WING )) to mass-produce the snacks for the kids, and the kids will vote for their favor it e one the only way kids can, by screaming. Fabio is picked last, desp it e his quoting abil it y: The food is presented to the kids, some of whom devour everything instantly, while some future Colicchios prove more discerning: Joe Jonas arrives (to a surprising lack of child-total-sh*t-losing) to decide the winner, and asks the kids if they like first thing (boo) or THE SECOND THINGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!! (YAYYYY!!!!) Kids always cheer louder for the second thing, dummies. After Tiffani is crowned Queen Quickfire, my friend Matt immediately commented “Did they have a contingency plan if the cheering had been close?” I reply “I was thinking the exact same thing!” Matt and I are useful people on this earth. Onto the Elimination Challenge, and hoo-boy, after Top Chef shockingly avoided the super-stretched themes for the first Elimination and two Quickfires, they more than made up for it w it h the Top Cheffiest theme that ever Top Cheffed: LOLOLOLOL! Dinosaurs! Museum! Didn’t they already do this challenge back in Season 2 when the dinosaurs from Dinotopia guest-judged? I dreamt that? Gotcha. The captains have to cook breakfast for the kids, their parents, and the museum staff for the follo wing morning, but one team will be Team “T-Rex” and can only use meat, and the other will be Team “Dilophosaurus” and can only sp it poison at Wayne Knight. I realize this stopped being a Recap like eight paragraphs ago, but let’s keep typing and see what happens. Tiffani has first pick and selects “T-Rex,” sticking Spike’s team w it h “Brontosaurus,” but when they go to the museum pantry, it ’s stocked to the brim w it h vegetables that are defin it ely always in the museum pantry, while the meat side has only meats and meat biproducts (eggs and whining). T-Rexes only eat meat, Tiffani, so you only get meat! You just got DINOSAURD’D! The chefs sleep overnight in the North American Mammals wing , because no kids have any interest in ever going there. Some of the chefs take a nap and others explore the museum, while the Bravo camera people get questioned by police for this B-Roll: The Teams get to cooking, and Bravo sets up l it erally every potential person-thro wing -person-under-the-bus combination imaginable. Everyone gets mad at someone else for some reason; Tiffani is mad at Tom for not making the challenge clear, Marcel is mad at Angelo for telling Tiffany to cut his plums in half (Marcel’s kind of a D, obviously, but I was w it h him on this one — I’d be furious if someone cut some of my jokes from this Recap w it hout telling me, no matter how obviously terrible), and everyone on Team Rex turns on Jamie when she cuts her finger and leaves to get st it ches. They all agree that in a real k it chen, if you cut yourself, you stay there and bleed into the food and maybe suffer worse long-term damage to your cooking hand, just like Chef Jon Voight from Vars it y Blues always said. Oh look, the ads for Top Che Funivers it y are back: Jenn adds some foreshado wing , saying “My father always told me that second place is still losing.” Jenn doesn’t mention that her father is an And1 T-shirt. The teams present their dishes to the judges, kids, and staff members, and I will again stress that it is TEAM T-REX versus TEAM BRONTOSAURUS: Tom actually says, “You know, it ’s tough, there were some good things on Team T-Rex, but there were some good things on Brontosaurus too.” This show is amazing. I really don’t say that enough. I’m down a couple drinks right now, but I mean it . Team Brontosaurus seems to be doing generally better, though, w it h some classic kids breakfast favor it es like Spike’s V9 Gazpacho and Fabio’s Potato Gnocchi w it h Leeks, Spinach&amp;Mushrooms (I used to get potato gnocchi Kid Cuisines all the time when I was l it tle, because huh?) The biggest h it is Richard, Angelo and Marcel’s Banana Parfa it w it h Seasonal Fru it &amp;Tandoori Maple, which is dang near Joe Jonas pretty: Gail takes the kid-patronizing in it iative and says “Ooh, isn’t that pretty kids? It ’s like a painting!” She adds, “Do you know what a painting is? It ’s like if Harry Potter waved his magic wand and had color appear on Batman!” Yaaay!!! The Top 3: Team Brontosaurus wins, which means that the judges obviously had the final say because no kid in their right mind would ever vote for a brontosaurus over a t-rex. Richard, Angelo and Marcel win for the banana parfa it , keeping my prediction of the eventual Richard / Angelo showdown intact. Your prize: You’re all going to Napa together! UHOH, only one bed! (Record Scratch) Etc. The Bottom: Team T-Rex suffers it s biggest defeat since that scientist popularized the theory that the T-Rex was just a scavenger to introduce kids to scientific debate while crushing their dreams of the awesome monster on their backpacks. Tiffany gets cr it icized for another surprisingly weak sho wing , Tre gets ripped for over-reducing his really salty sauce, Tiffani forces the judges to rip her when she complains about not fully understanding what she was choosing, and Jamie gets off surprisingly easily for l it erally not producing a dish, cut nonw it hstanding. The real fireworks, though, come when Tom cr it icizes Jennifer’s eggs for being bland. Jenn — who nervously cried several times during her previous Top Chef stint — goes ballistic: Jenn disagrees w it h everything Tom says, re- it erates that she’s pos it ive her eggs weren’t bland, and when Tom brings up that serving everything on one plate was too cluttered, Jenn snaps back “You’re the judges, you should be smart enough to say ‘hey can I get a different plate.’” Uhhhmmmm, you’re probably going home, Jenn. But wa it ! Tom says “If someone’s going home, it ’s gonna be for their dish, not because they got angry at us, I have no problem w it h that.” So maybe Jenn isn’t going home? Then Padma’s like, “Nahhhh, Jenn’s very going home.” The other contescheftants are shocked: Jennifer was clearly at least in the top half of chefs this season talent-wise, and was probably Finale-worthy, but if we take the judges’ word that they judge every challenge independently based solely on the dishes of a particular week, and that Jennifer’s dish was in fact that bad, then they had to eliminate her. That said, whether or not the effect was deliberate, Jenn’s elimination certainly does send a “we’re not playing around” message to the rest of the chefs, and adds some intrigue to the season’s early weeks, a fact which the producers clearly couldn’t have been unaware of in deciding to let her go. Although, Tre made one sauce and botched it , and Jamie l it erally did nothing. But, diff’rent judgestrokes, you know? Bye Jenn! Sorry you got kicked to the curb and have to get up from that curb and resume being an enormously successful chef at Michelin star-winning establishments. But no couple page-spread in magazine that I only remember exists during the intro of this show for you! Burn. Top Chef All-Stars episode 2 reactions? Jennifer elimination thoughts?

 It begins at a trot w it h the teams if they are on them, no one is willing to bare to open gates to counterattack enemy, it turns out one quarter of an hour far from exc it ing, in which goalkeepers are spectators and boredom is the host. 

 
 

 The first emotion comes suddenly to 15 ° when Gimenez steals the ball in pressing the central guests and they are all alone in front of Sanchez, the top Uruguayan but blew it w it h a shot to the side that loses lopsided. 

 The ti tic toc you nauseous, landlocked is stopped at 22 w it h a free kick whistled in favor of the Venetian, right on the edge of the area, but shoots high Pellissier, meets again w it h the Bologna Gimenez who flies to the area, but Perez instead of serve, passing to a distracted Ekdal wasting all, then the turn of Marcolini to defeat a good opportun it y at the side instead of concluding serve Moscardelli free at the far post. 

 Accident before leaving for Constant, replaced by Bogliacino, Perez then gives way to Casarini. 

 At 39 ° the Bologna took the lead, free-kick from the left wing that Di Vaio football around to the door, Sorrentino spoke awkwardly, pushing foot, pounced on the loose ball Br it os that, outside the door slides open, the second goal in 3 days for the Uruguayan and a big party to Dallara. 

 

 The recovery begins w it h the Bologna, on the wing s of enthusiasm, pushes strongly and succeeded in freeing Di Vaio shot twice, in both cases the conclusions, well directed, from the bomber rossoblu are parade ground not w it hout difficulty by Sorrentino 

 Suddenly, and against trend, comes the balance of Verona, the development of a corner kick from the right, the ball comes to the center where Cesar, w it h a wonderful twist of his head, and anticipates all places the ball in the far corner, out the reach of Viviano. 

 The goal immediately off the heat of Bologna, which leaves the game leaving the in it iative to Chievo, who, almost obligatory, began to attack w it h greater continu it y and conviction. 

 The 70th finally sees the Bologna Di Vaio&apos;s free-kick that ends at the side, but a minute later is sensational opportun it y for the Venetian, a misunderstanding between Moras and Della Rocca delivers the ball into the feet of the newly entered Granoche not believe such grace and from 7 feet, let fly a shot which Viviano you babbling about over turning a corner. 

 The public is trying to support their heroes in a clear moment of difficulty, the yellow and blue continue to run the ball and create potentially dangerous s it uations from parts of Viviano, but never pull the danger of the door in the mirror. 

 After a bailout on Marcolini, only in the area, in the beautiful restart Siligardi Morley serves only area, unwatchable his conclusion that we lose high. 

 The finish is a real bullfight, Bologna dragged from their fans is poured, w it h the energy of despair, yellow and blue in search of the winning goal. 

 86th seems to be made when a free kick from Casarini beats band Meggiorini head sends the network, jumped up screaming in liberating us off the linesman waving his flag in his throat to emphasize a very dubious off side, if any. 

 It is played in 20 in Verona, Br it os good w it h the ball 10 meters from the door but instead of firing to the door looking for an unlikely assist for Di Vaio, Di Vaio, 92 ° is to be released in the area, but his shot to shot sure it is saved on the line almost Marcolini, who canceled! 

 Just last assault on the 93 ° Di Vaio asked and obtained a triangle by Moras and occurs only in the area, and beat Sorrentino w it h a soft shot that slips around the first pole for the delirio of the rossoblu people, I jump for an exaggeration exult, wowwwwwwwwwwwwww

 Finally the referee blows his whistle, the Bologna has won again, w it h mer it , at least for the desire and determination shown in the finale, when, after fifteen minutes of suffering to the horse half hour of shooting, took the fort enfilade yellow and blue, in which the Venetians were holed up in defense of the precious balance, creating opportun it ies on occasions. 

 Chievo has proven to be very solid team and organized, but it seemed perhaps too defeatist, content from the beginning of the draw, and just believing in victory even when Bologna had seemed in distress. 

 For Bologna a success that brings another 3 important points in a ranking that it is really nice to share 19, the players show great presence of mind, will and spir it of devotion, fighting tirelessly and believe always, supported by a moving and commendable result, eventually the right to collect the prize. 

 Now, and I say, entrepreneurs in Bologna, it &apos;s time to put aside the talk and resolve this unfortunate s it uation, if you have the money and the real desire to invest in Bologna, this is the time to take the field. 

 This team and fans deserve this! 

 The best: in Bologna Di Vaio and Morleo, in Chievo Marcolini and Moscardelli.

 Wing lovers, rejoice. Dog owners, maybe not so much.

H Street NE&apos;s contentious chicken bone debate came to what appears to be a final resolution Tuesday, as D.C.&apos;s Board of Zoning Adjustment ruled that 7-Eleven does not need to be reclassified as a fast food establishment.

The decision came out of an appeal filed by Advisory Neighborhood Commission 6A that argued that the 7-Eleven at 957 H St. NE ought to be forced to re-apply for a new certificate of occupancy, one that reflects the convenience store&apos;s emphasis on the sale of fast food it ems. The ANC has long been concerned that the store&apos;s offerings of ready-to-eat snacks like pizza slices, nachos, and hot dogs were contributing to an increase in l it ter around the neighborhood.

But negotiations between the commission and 7-Eleven broke down last month over a single sticking point: boned chicken wing s. The operator of the store refused to stop selling them, desp it e commun it y concerns that chicken bones were ending up on the ground, potentially attracting vermin and posing a choking hazard to dogs.

Tuesday&apos;s hearing before the Board of Zoning Adjustment didn&apos;t actually end up addressing that bone of contention, however, as the board established early on that the appeal process could only concern it self w it h the method by which the c it y&apos;s zoning administrator, Matt LeGrant, arrived at his decision to grant 7-Eleven a certificate of occupancy in the first place. Commissioner Drew Ronneberg, representing ANC 6A at the hearing, had lined up a handful of w it nesses to testify about the convenience store&apos;s trash issues, but none of that testimony ended up being presented to the board.

Instead, Ronneberg was forced to focus strictly on the mer it s of his appeal, which pos it ed that LeGrant had made an error in granting the certificate of occupancy based on two mistakes. One, that the certificate listed the type of business as a &quot;market,&quot; which is not technically one of the classifications listed w it hin the c it y&apos;s zoning regulations. And more importantly, that the 7-Eleven exceeds the standard threshold of 15 percent of it s business devoted to &quot;fast food&quot; type sales, a no-no for an establishment that is not zoned as a fast food restaurant .

What followed was a laborious, three-hour hearing that went way down into the weeds of zoning regulations and procedures. Fully 30 minutes were devoted to determining whether Ronneberg had even had a chance to review the materials that LeGrant used to make his original decision, and it eventually came out that he hadn&apos;t specifically asked for most of them. The board then had no choice but to deny the commissioner&apos;s motion to push the hearing back another 60 days.

&quot;I understand that it is frustrating sometimes to get documents from the D.C. government,&quot; said board member Konrad Schlater. But &quot; it is the appellant&apos;s burden to provide the information to support it s appeal.&quot;

W it h the hearing then going forward, the board was left to weigh Ronneberg&apos;s remaining arguments, the &quot;market&quot; issue and the 15 percent cap on sales of it ems that const it ute a &quot;subordinate&quot; or &quot;accessory&quot; use. &quot;7-Eleven has seen a decline in it s tobacco sales, and so has focused more on fast food,&quot; Ronneberg said, pointing to the large advertisements seen on bus shelters all over town offering &quot;2 slices for $2.22.&quot;

&quot;If this C of O is in danger, then every 7-Eleven all over our c it y is in danger, as is every mom and pop market in all eight wards of our c it y,&quot; countered attorney Jerry A. Moore, representing 7-Eleven.

As the hearing wore on, subtle smiles could be seen on some of the board members&apos; faces as the two sides went back on forth on the minutiae of what const it utes fast food and what doesn&apos;t. Turns of phrase such as &quot;the hot dog roller was never put to the test,&quot; or, &quot;I did not include the Slurpee machine&quot; made what was otherwise a typically dry zoning hearing just ever so slightly less dull.

Ultimately, the board voted 3-0-2 to deny Ronneberg&apos;s appeal, w it h the caveat that the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs must issue a revised certificate of occupancy that classifies the 7-Eleven as a &quot;grocery,&quot; as zoning rules dictate, as opposed to a &quot;market,&quot; which it turns out is a building regulation term. The evidence that 7-Eleven came close to exceeding the 15 percent threshold on fast food, the board reasoned, while &quot;not insignificant,&quot; still showed that fast food was &quot;clearly subordinate&quot; to the convenience store&apos;s ident it y as a grocer.

The battle of Saigon Grill flared up again Sunday as at least a dozen picketers braved the b it ter cold to assail new management. Placards reading “Boycott Saigon Grill” recalled the protests that began in 2007 after former owners Simon and Michelle Nget fired 36 delivery workers — and were later ordered to pay them $4.6 million in back wages by a federal judge. When they were arrested in 2008 , the Ngets had to sell their restaurant s at 620 Amsterdam and on Univers it y Place. The new UWS owners, Bei Lin and Quiao Lin, opened on October 1; however, protesters began picketing on November 23, accusing management of discriminating against wa it ers and busboys referred by the mil it ant Chinese Staff and Workers Association, a labor-rights group based in Chinatown.

&quot;We referred ten and they actually hired them,&quot; said Wing Lam, executive director of CSWA. &quot;They wanted one of them to be the manager. But they said they could keep only four (wa it ers) and wanted to get rid of the three older workers. The other (workers) said that&apos;s not right, so they fired everybody,&quot; he claimed. The referrals were on the job for just one day.

Lam also contended the new Saigon Grill management was &quot;harassing&quot; the delivery workers that CSWA referred to the restaurant for trying to organize a union. CSWA organizer Josephine Lee says the group will soon file a complaint against the restaurant w it h the National Labor Relations Board. She said management had agreed to abide by the labor laws but had not kept it s promise.

Saigon Grill manager Frank Chang denied Chinese Staff&apos;s allegations, claiming that wa it ers they had sent &quot;were not qualified.&quot; He told us, &quot;They sent seven people, and only one or two were qualified. Customers complained.&quot; Chang adm it ted CSWA helped his boss get a liquor license after it was suspended because of the criminal charges against the Ngets. But he claimed the labor-rights group &quot;wants to control the business. They want to pick the wa it staff. I said one or two. They wanted all of them (hired).&quot;

Chang estimated that Bei Lin paid about $2 million to buy the UWS restaurant from Simon Nget. He noted his boss is &quot;very sad&quot; about the protests, adding that business has slowed because of the picketing.

 Update: &quot;I am deeply troubled by allegations of worker mistreatment, including age discrimination and a refusal to hire union members, especially in light of Saigon Grill’s long history of explo it ation under the old management,” says New York State Assembly member Linda B. Rosenthal. “I will be meeting w it h the new owner this week and thoroughly revie wing the charges workers have identified.”

Kate gets her Wills; NHS receives praise; pension-age criminals; Kinder Scout needs help; animal awareness; refurb for Stonehenge; bill goes up in smoke

 It has been nearly 30 years since the last big royal wedding, so the announcement that Prince William is to marry his long-standing sweetheart Kate Middleton was Big News. She will not only be his wife and his princess, but in the not so distant future she will be his queen.

Alongside all the usual guff about frocks and fol-de-rols, there has been some earnest discussion about morganatic marriage, for the future consort is a commoner. When the royal father-in-law-to-be, Prince Charles, married Diana Spencer in 1981, blue blood was considered essential in future queens. Now it has become irrelevant.

That is not to say that we are at last reaching the nirvana of classlessness. The coming wedding will almost certainly be muted by previous standards, given that even royals must accept that we live in austere times. But for all that it will be a gl it tering affair, w it h gorgeous clothes and uniforms, carriages, cheering crowds and, as they used to say in the north, several kinds of cake.

Given the disastrous mar it al record of the royal family, there has been some speculation about how long the latest romance will last. That seems distasteful as well as baseless. The future king is to have a stunningly beautiful wife and they deserve joy of each other.

 NHS is good for you 

Diehard lefties who cannot take pleasure in the royal nuptials may instead turn for comfort to the latest survey by the US health thinktank the Commonwealth Fund. It has found that Br it ain is the only one of 11 leading industrialised nations in which wealth does not determine the provision of high-qual it y healthcare.

The report&apos;s starkest finding is that one-third of American adults &quot;went w it hout recommended care, did not see a doctor when sick or failed to fill prescriptions because of costs&quot;. The corresponding figure for the UK was 6%. What is more, the National Health Service (NHS) was found to be extremely cost-effective, w it h spending on health per person almost the lowest of any country surveyed.

None of this has much impressed government ministers, who are hell-bent on &quot;reforms&quot; to make the NHS more efficient. This is a none-too-cryptic way of saying that they want it to spend less.

 The grey-haired gang 

We no longer much use the phrase &quot;lager louts&quot; to describe yobs and rowdies. But now we have a new label for another section of the misbehaving public: Saga louts, or pensioners who end up getting arrested and locked up.

The grey crimewave, as it is called, is increasing. Statistics compiled by various police forces show that the number of pensioners being arrested is up by between 15% and 25%. In Derbyshire, for instance, 260 over-65s were arrested for serious crimes in 2009, compared w it h 88 the previous year. In Scotland the number of over-65s charged w it h drug and weapons crimes has more than doubled in four years.

Experts are puzzled by the trend. Some believe that elderly people on low pensions are turning to crime through necess it y. Others think the figures reflect an increasingly tough att it ude in the courts. E it her way, the elderly are beginning to have an impact on the justice system and even on the prison service. Kingston jail in Portsmouth has become the first in the country to have a special wing for the older criminal, w it h stairlifts and other aids.

 Kind to Kinder Scout 

Kinder Scout is one of the most evocative place-names in England. Almost 80 years ago, campaigners for the so-called right to roam gathered on the windswept plateau in the Derbyshire Pennines in defiance of local gamekeepers and police. There were bloody skirmishes before the demonstration was broken up, but the mass trespass set in train the events that led to the creation of national parks – including the one that embraces Kinder Scout – and a much greater freedom for ramblers to enjoy the countryside.

But now Kinder Scout is in trouble. Barely controlled sheep grazing and tens of thousands of walking enthusiasts, combined w it h air pollution from the surrounding c it ies and occasional catastrophic underground peat fires, have eroded the fragile surface of the bleak but beautiful Pennine moors.

Now the National Trust, which owns most of the plateau, has come up w it h a bold plan to put up sheep-proof fences, w it h access points for walkers, to encourage the regeneration of v it al plants like cottongrass, heather and bilberry.

 Kinder still to animals 

We are daily bombarded w it h food scares – salt kills, butter maims, fast food will wipe out civilisation; that kind of thing – but not many of us take the doomsaying seriously. A new EU-wide survey has found that concerns in the UK about pesticides, pollution, bird flu, mad cow disease, genetic modification, food add it ives and salmonella have all fallen significantly in the last five years.

But, true to Br it ish form, our concern for animal welfare is increasing. More than two-thirds of Br it ons are worried about cond it ions for farm animals. Awareness of the issue is thought to have been raised by high-profile campaigns by celebr it y chefs, and by proposals for a super-diary in Lincolnshire.

Slowly, it seems, we are becoming aware of the dominance of factory-farming and industrial food processing. Still, though we might feel sorry for penned-in pigs and cooped-up chickens, we show no loss of appet it e for shoving fast, packaged food down our necks.

 Stonehenge revamp 

In a troubled and austere world, it is good to report that the long-awa it ed new vis it or centre at Stonehenge is looking much closer to real it y. No thanks to the government, of course, but because of a £10m ($16m) grant from the Her it age Lottery Fund. There is now hope that the £27m replacement for the existing drab, tatty facil it ies will be ready by 2012, when the London Olympics are expected to bring a flood of tourists to Br it ain.

The Her it age Lottery Fund is also forking out £2m for a comprehensive refurbishment of Charles Dickens&apos;s only surviving London home, in Clerkenwell. It , too, should be ready for 2012.

A third beneficiary of non-government funds is the Royal Opera House, which is about to open a spanking new production workshop by the side of the Thames in Purfleet, Essex. The bulk of the cost was met by Arts Council England.

 The bouncing bill 

 It seemed a very ordinary slice of London life: a young, well-dressed couple enjoying an excellent dinner at the posh L&apos;Autre Pied restaurant in Marylebone. Each had three courses, w it h two bottles of champagne between them. When, after the main course, they said they were going outside for a smoke, staff thought nothing of it , and even helped them on w it h their coats.

That was the last they saw of the smart young couple, who vanished into the night w it hout paying. A petty crime, you might think, except that there is very l it tle petty about an unpaid bill of £572.74. What is even more astonishing is the reaction of the restaurant manager, Leonara Papaj: &quot;They looked like a very genuine, very lovely couple. Their bill was an average spend. Nothing was out of place or unusual.&quot; So, next time you have a sausage roll for lunch, think of yourself as qu it e extraordinary.

 PHOTOS: More shots of the Isabella Stewart Gardner construction 

 The opening of the $345 million Art of the Americas Wing at the Museum of Fine Arts this week represents but the latest — and the biggest — crest in a wave of new-museum construction in Boston that began unofficially w it h the opening of the new Inst it ute of Contemporary Art building on Fan Pier in December 2007. Down the street from the MFA, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is in the midst of it s own $114 million construction of a new wing by Pr it zker Prize–winning arch it ect Renzo Piano. ( See photos from the June &quot;Topping Ceremony&quot; here .) Keeping a lower profile — except to it s immediate mid-Cambridge neighbors — is the renovation (some might say reconstruction) of the Fogg Art Museum, also designed by Piano (cost as yet undisclosed). 

 But first things first. The Gardner began s it e preparation October 9. By late 2011, it expects to complete it s new 70,000-square-foot wing , which would then open to the public in early 2012. (The total area of the original 1903 building is 60,000 square feet.) 

 As of a few weeks ago, the major features of the Gardner were coming clearly into view. The Gardner has always been lim it ed by the stipulation in Mrs. Gardner&apos;s will that, in essence, each object in the museum must remain where she left it . Special exhib it ions were always lim it ed to a 500-square-foot gallery. The special-exhib it ion gallery in the new wing will be a three-story, 1500-foot room w it h full-length north-facing windows and adjustable ceiling, plus a small, 500-foot ante-room. The old entrance will be closed; the new one, on Evans Way, will lead into a more spacious lobby. The new wing will also include a &quot;Living Room&quot; orientation area, a restaurant , a gift shop, new greenhouses, and two artist residences on the second floor w it h atelier-like windows. 

 But the jewel of the new wing will be it s 296-seat concert hall. Last year, when Piano spoke at the museum, it seemed that this was his main incentive for taking the job. It s capac it y will be about the same as that of the Tapestry Room, the s it e of concerts in the historic building. But that long hall, though attractive and intimate, was never ideal for concerts — especially if you were seated more than 20 rows back. The new concert hall will have it s performers in the center, surrounded by the audience on all four sides, w it h two rows of seats on the first floor topped by three single-row balconies. 

 The s it uation at what are now being called &quot;the Harvard Univers it y Art Museums&quot; is more complicated. In February 2006, Harvard announced a &quot;comprehensive academic plan to transform facil it ies for teaching, research, and presentation of it s renowned collections.&quot; Most immediately, that meant a complete renovation of the Fogg Art Museum building at 32 Quincy Street, which was constructed in 1927. What casual observers probably didn&apos;t realize was that this also meant the demol it ion of Otto Werner Hall, the adjoining structure that since 1991 had housed the collection of the former Busch-Reisinger Museum on Kirkland Street. 

 The Fogg has officially been closed since June 2008, during which time it s various collections have been represented in the Sackler Museum down the block on Broadway.

As the moneymen from the IMF move into Dublin, novelist Colm Tóibín considers his country&apos;s bloody past, turbulent present and uncertain future

In the spring of 1985 while I was reporting on the trial of Leopoldo Galtieri and the other Argentinian generals for crimes against human it y in Buenos Aires, I was asked by a friend who lived outside the c it y to collect two American guys on a Saturday morning in a c it y centre hotel and go w it h them to San Isidro in the suburbs. We were going to spend the weekend sailing on the river Plate.

In the railway station as we wa it ed for the train I discovered that the two American guys were in the c it y to deal w it h the economic crisis which was affecting Argentina in the aftermath of the generals&apos; rule.

One was from the World Bank and one from the IMF. As the train got going, I remarked on what a fantastic service it was, that it ran every half hour even through the night, and the tickets were incredibly cheap. The two Americans looked at one another and then one of them told me that this would not be continuing, that it made no sense, that they had been studying the economics of public transport in the c it y, and the system was insane.

 It would be cheaper, one of them said, actually to pay people to go on this train than to maintain the current way of selling and checking the tickets, especially if you included pension costs. I should enjoy the train while it lasted, they said, because it would not be in existence much longer in it s present state.

When I told them what I was doing in Argentina, they seemed mildly bored. Every day w it nesses were coming into court to tell of how they had been detained illegally and tortured. Most of the stories were horrific and beyond belief.

The trial, which was reported each day in the newspapers, was likely to go on all year. Finally, my American friends said that they believed it was a waste of money and a waste of time. Argentina, economically, they said, was a basket case, in desperate need of root and branch reform. The trial was, at best, a distraction.

We had a good weekend sailing and I saw them a few times over the weeks that followed. I remember one evening as we made our way from the hotel to a restaurant in a taxi we found that streets were blocked, and then we came right up against a group of angry protesters, w it h placards about jobs being lost and wages cut.

One of the guys I was w it h grew really angry, could barely contain himself in the taxi. This was the last thing Argentina needed, he said. Protests like this were not just a waste of time, but they were irresponsible.

The country was going to have to go through years of hardship, he said, to get to a pos it ion where it could begin again. There were no choices. Argentina was not just broke, it owed a fortune and the costs of public services were outlandish. Protesting would not make the slightest difference.

I remembered my American friends this week as news came that a delegation from the EU and the IMF were to arrive in Dublin on Thursday. I think I have an idea how dedicated and serious-minded these fellows would be, especially on weekdays, and how l it tle interest they might have in Irish history, Irish pride, Irish sovereignty or even Irish doublespeak. They like to get the job done and then get home.

On the night before these figure-crunchers arrived in the c it y, I watched a discussion programme on Irish television in which commentators, people younger than me, invoked the dead heroes who had fought for an independent Ireland, naming some of them, including patriots from the 18th century, and wondering how they would feel now were they to find out about the shame we Irish felt.

We had fought so hard for our freedom, they said, and now, w it h the arrival in Merrion Street, where the government is housed, of besu it ed stone-faced economists w it h German and Scandinavian names and number-crunching knuckles, we had betrayed our dead. Patrick Pearse eat your heart out, the Germans have arrived.

On Thursday morning the main ed it orial in the Irish Times had a headline Was it for this?, a quote from WB Yeats&apos;s poem September 1913:

 Was it for this the Wilde Geese spread 

 The grey wing upon every tide 

 For this that all that blood was shed 

 For this Edward F it zgerald died 

 And Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone 

 All that delirium of the brave? 

The ed it orial asked if this was &quot;what the men of 1916 died for: a bailout from the German chancellor w it h a few shillings of sympathy from the Br it ish chancellor on the side. There is the shame of it all. Having obtained our pol it ical independence from Br it ain to be masters of our own affairs, we have now surrendered our sovereignty to the European commission, the European central bank and the International Monetary Fund. Their representatives ride into Merrion Street today.&quot;

 It was hard to know whether to laugh or to cry while watching the commentators on TV invoking dead patriots and the Irish Times ed it orial going on about the men of 1916. Patriotism, it seems, is the first refuge of Ireland, now that the scale of the crisis and the urgent need to solve it has been fully recognised.

I should perhaps declare an interest before I burst out laughing or fall around crying. My grandfather fought in the 1916 rebellion and was imprisoned afterwards. I was brought up in the proud memory of his bravery. My uncle and my father worked all their lives for the Fianna Fáil party which has run Ireland most of the time since 1932 and which is in power now. I have never ceased to believe in their patriotism and idealism.

But just now I don&apos;t care about sovereignty and I don&apos;t want to hear about dead patriots and how they might feel. I care about the actual problems which many of my compatriots are facing – losing their houses, their jobs, their dign it y as c it izens – and believe that the task of the Irish government is to defend the rights of those who are suffering as best they can rather than consider the fact that they have betrayed the memory of the patriot dead.

The problem is not merely that there is no blueprint in Ireland now, no agenda, for how this might be done. The problem is also that it wasn&apos;t there before the Celtic Tiger e it her, nor during it s heady reign. In areas which really matter, such as health and education, Ireland has, since independence, been deeply divided.

There are two health systems here, for example. One is for middle-class people who pay health insurance and the other for those who can&apos;t afford to pay. There are short wa it ing lists for one, and long wa it ing lists for the other. Often, both see the same doctors, who treat the first group in private hosp it als, or private rooms in public hosp it als, and the second group in public hosp it als.

Everyone here knows that the difference can be a matter of life and death. Some of the doctors make a fortune. There has been no serious effort to reform this, but many efforts instead to copper-fasten it . This is one example of what sovereignty has done to us.

What sovereignty has done to us also is to create a pol it ical system in Ireland in which pol it ical vision or skill or seriousness are not valued. The four main Irish pol it icians, for example – the taoiseach, the tánaiste (the deputy prime minister), the minister for finance and the leader of the oppos it ion – all come from pol it ical tribes; all of their fathers were members of parliament as well.

They inher it ed their pol it ics and, it seemed, their seats in parliament. Thus they came into pol it ics w it hout having to think seriously, or try very hard. Normally, they made sure not to change much, and they generally did no real harm. Under the pressure of the banking crisis, however, they have been no use at all. They are out of their depth.

And they have a sense of ent it lement which, as they ruined their country, has become an awful arrogance. Everything they have told us over the past two years has turned out to be untrue. And that is putting it mildly.

 It is clear now what will happen to Ireland over the next five years. It will be treated as an economy rather than a society, as a problem to be solved by looking at figures rather than considering the needs of c it izens. One possibil it y is that the arrival of the outsiders in Merrion Street will involve the destruction of the power of the ruling Fianna Fáil party and it s ent it lement to rule.

The problem is that there is no Irish pol it ical figure or Irish oppos it ion party in a pos it ion to replace them w it h any serious social vision or sense of purpose and determination to build a new country. Listening to the debates on radio and television, or in the Irish parliament, over the past two years, or the past week, has not been inspiring.

Yet there have been changes which have mattered. There are two things which have happened in my lifetime which I still feel a sort of reverence for. One is the Good Friday agreement, and the other is the European Union.

The first allowed for compromise and nuance in Ireland over issues of ident it y and sovereignty. It allowed for the idea that you could be Br it ish in Ireland, or both Irish and Br it ish, or just Irish. It allowed for the idea that history carries as much shadow as substance, and that nothing is simple in our her it age. It was negotiated w it h imagination and openness by Irish pol it icians and civil servants as well as Br it ish ones.

The EU did not merely pay for roads and other necessary infrastructure in Ireland, it opened the country up to the world around it . The more I found out about contemporary Germany, for example, and the more I travelled there, the more I came to admire it and the more I came to hope that some of it s best qual it ies could come to influence and affect Ireland.

Thus when the Irish Times on Thursday mentioned &quot;the German chancellor&quot; I did not automatically feel that this person was in some way a malignant force in the world. Instead, I saw someone rational and prudent, sensible and deeply intelligent.

So, too, when the Irish Times mentioned &quot;a few shillings of sympathy from the Br it ish chancellor on the side&quot;, I didn&apos;t feel any shame at all. I noticed in the past week that the tone of the Br it ish chancellor has seemed both sympathetic and reasonable.

Europe remains, it seems, especially when placed under pressure, a loose and uneasy collection of competing nation states. But we need to think of it also as a collection of c it ies, each of which has been vastly improved by membership of the European Union, w it h some space in between.

Anyone wandering in the c it y of Hamburg now, for example, has a right to sense not only the beauty of the place, but how rich it has become, and how well run it is. And that goes for London too and Madrid. The way those c it ies have opened up to the outside world, and exude, most of the time, a sense of tolerance which is at the heart of European humanism, should be a matter of pride to all of us.

In the meantime, around the corner from where I wr it e this, men in su it s are crunching numbers in Merrion Street. Many of them are experts in how to cut public spending, in the cost of bailout packages, and the price to be paid by bankrupt countries in exchange for systems of support.

I can imagine the looks of bafflement, pure boredom, that would come on their faces were they to be told about Irish history or our patriot dead.

I could list a number of wonderful pubs in the centre of our c it y, Dublin, and some great art museums and theatres and book shops they might enjoy, I could name the wr it ers they should be reading, but I know they will be busy, working late into the night.

 America - He&apos;s your President for Goodness Sake! 

 By William Thomas 

There was a time not so long ago when Americans, regardless of their pol it ical stripes, rallied round their president. Once elected, the man who won the Wh it e House was no longer viewed as a Republican or Democrat, but the President of the Un it ed States . The ?oath of office was taken, the wagons were circled around the countrys borders and it was America versus the rest of the world w it h the president of all the people at the helm.

?Suddenly President Barack Obama, w it h the potential to become an exceptional president has become the glaring exception to that unwr it ten, patriotic rule.
Four days before President Obamas inauguration, before he officially took charge of the American government, Rush Limbaugh boasted publicly that he hoped the president would fail. Of course, when the president fails the country flounders. Wishing harm upon your country in order to further your own narrow pol it ical views is selfish, sinister and a tad treasonous as well.

Subsequently, during his State of the Union address, which is pretty much a pep rally for America , an unknown congressional representative from South Carolina , later identified as Joe Wilson, stopped the show when he called the President of the Un it ed States a liar. The president showed great restraint in ignoring this unprecedented insult and carried on w it h his speech. Speaker Nancy Pelosi was so stunned by the slur, she forgot to jump to her feet while clapping wildly, 30 or 40 times after that.

Last spring, President Obama took his wife Michelle to see a play in New York C it y and republicans attacked him over the cost of secur it y for the excursion. The president cant take his wife out to dinner and a show w it hout being scrutinized by the pol it ical oppos it ion? As history has proven, a president in a theatre w it hout adequate secur it y is a tragically bad idea.

Remember: Apart from that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?

At some point, the treatment of President Obama went from offensive to ugly and then to downright dangerous.

The health-care debate, which looked more like extreme fighting in a mud p it than a national dialogue, revealed a very vulgar side of America . President Obamas face appeared on protest signs wh it e-faced and blood-mouthed in a satanic clown image. In other tasteless portrayals, people who disagreed w it h his pos it ion distorted his face to look like H it ler complete w it h mustache and swastika.

Odd, that burning the flag makes Americans crazy, but depicting the president as a clown and a maniacal fascist is accepted as part of the new rude America .

Maligning the image of the leader of the free world is one thing, putting the presidents life in peril is qu it e another. More than once, men w it h guns were videotaped at the health-care rallies where the president spoke. Again, history shows that letting men w it h guns get w it hin range of a president has not served America well in the past.
And still the birthers are out there claiming Barack Obama was not born in the Un it ed States , although public documentation proves otherwise. Hawaii is defin it ely part of the Un it ed States , but the Panama Canal Zone where his electoral opponent Senator John McCain was born? Nobodys sure. ?

Last month, a 44-year-old woman in Buffalo was qu it e taken by President Obama when she met him in a chicken wing restaurant called Duffs. Did she say something about a pleasure and an honour to meet the man or utter encouraging words for the difficult job he is doing? No. Quote: Youre a hottie w it h a smokin l it tle body.

Lady, that was the President of the Un it ed States you were addressing, not one of the Jonas Brothers! Hes your president for goodness sakes, not the guy driving the Zamboni at Monster Trucks On Ice. Maybe next it ll be, Take Your President To A Topless Bar Day.

In President Barack Obama, Americans have a charismatic leader w it h a good and honest heart. Unlike his predecessor, hes a very intelligent leader. And unlike that presidents predecessor, hes a highly moral man.

In President Obama, Americans have the real deal, the whole package and a leader that c it izens of almost every country around the world look to w it h great envy. Given the opportun it y, Canadians would trade our leader, hell, most of our leaders for Obama in a heartbeat.

What America has in Obama is a head of state w it h v it al it y and insight and youth. Think about it , Barack Obama is a young Nelson Mandela. Mandela was the face of change and char it y for all of Africa but he was too old to make it happen. The great things Obama might do for America and the world could go on for decades after hes out of office.

 America, you know not what you have. 

 The man is being challenged unfairly, characterized w it h vulgar it y and treated w it h the kind of deep disrespect to which no previous president was subjected. It s like the day after electing the first black man to be president, thereby electrifying the world w it h hope and joy, Americans sobered up and decided the bad old days were better. 

 President Obama may fail but it will not be a Richard Nixon default fraught w it h larceny and lies. President Obama, given a fair chance, will surely succeed but his triumph will never come w it h a Bill Clinton caveat if only hed got control of that zipper. 

 Please. Give the man a fair, fighting chance. This incivil it y toward the leader who won over Americans and gave hope to billions of people around the world that their lives could be enhanced by his example, just naturally has to stop. 

 Believe me, when Americans drive by the Wh it e House and see a sign on the lawn that reads: No shirt. No shoes. No service, theyll realize this new national rudeness has gone way, way too far.

 America - He&apos;s your President for Goodness Sake!

 There was a time not so long ago when Americans, regardless of their pol it ical stripes, rallied round their president.

 [details] [close] received 1 year ago  published 1 year ago  lang: en   I just returned home a few weeks ago from FL to complete my Cave diver course. I have been working at this for almost 2 yrs. This was my 3rd attempt at finishing Full Cave. Here is a synopsis of what I did. Thurs. Oct. 21- I left w it h another gent (Kevin) who was also going through to complete his Full Cave. We left after I got off work Thurs. The instructor (Larry) flew down&amp;Kevin&amp;I drove his truck&amp;equipment down to him. We drove through the night&amp;arrived at the cabin we were staying in About 6 am. Fri. Oct. 22- Larry took another student, who was down to finish his intro course, to Peacock Springs work w it h him 1 on 1, while Kevin&amp;I slept for a few hours. We were going to do some intro level diving for some practice, but Larry had accidentally picked up the keys to his truck&amp;took them w it h him (he was riding w it h the other student). After a frantic&amp;unsuccessful search, we called him&amp;he then came back about an hour later&amp;returned the keys (strike 1). We got to Peacock Springs&amp;prepared to do an intro level dive. As entering the water, the strap buckle on Kevin’s fins broke apart (strike 2). He was able to put it back on, but it was not very stable. When he jumped in, his inflator hose started leaking badly where it was screwed onto his wing . The inflator hose had been removed&amp;reinstalled for recall work. I tried a few times to re- screw it on w it h no success. I could not access it good because of it being trapped between Kevin&amp;his tanks. (strike 3). At that point (3 strikes&amp;you’re out) I called the dive. Another student (Wes) that was going Cavern- Full arrived&amp;we went to a good dinner that night. Sat. Oct 23- Kevin got his equipment issues straightened out. While Larry worked w it h his students, Kevin&amp;I made an intro level dive into the cavern. Peacock I has 2 main tunnels, the Peanut tunnel&amp;the Pot Hole tunnel. I ran a primary reel to the Peanut line (after a few minutes to find it )&amp;Kevin ran a primary to the Pot Hole line. After surfacing for a while, we recalculated 1/6th of our air supply that we could use to in on. We swam up the Peanut line about 700 ft. After refilling tanks, we then did a swim up the Pot Hole line about 600 ft. Found a fabulous Mexican restaurant to eat at. Sun.Oct.24- Kevin&amp;I did a couple more intro level dives while Larry Worked w it h his students. We went to L it tle River&amp;then back to Peacock. The one student who came down to only finish his intro level training went home that night. That left Wes, Kevin&amp;I to go through Full Cave together. Mon. Oct 25- Full Cave Begins. We set up a complex Circu it by swimming up the Pot Hole Line. We set up the jump reel&amp;were going to also do a traverse to Olsen Sink, but 1/3 (of air supply) was called, so we returned to the entrance. We Then went up the Peanut line&amp;set the second jump in the crossover tunnel to complete the circu it , then returned. On the way back we did a 3 man lights out drill w it h me being an OOA diver, leading,&amp;Kevin the donor. Wes just did touch contact w it h us. Very slow going, but we made it . On the 3rd dive, we did the traverse&amp;swam the circu it , picking up the reels behind us. Tues. Oct. 26- Went to Ginnie Springs. We were going to do a short circu it , but I got to fighting the current too much&amp;we couldn’t do it on the air supply at my consumption rate. Second dive was a l it tle better, as we went up the Hill 400 line until 3rd’s. Wes did a lost line drill on the way out. Wed. Oct 27th- We did Ginnie Again. We went up the main line until 3rds. on the way back out I did another lights out air share drill w it h Wes, while Kevin watched. We did this from the Corn Flakes area, through the lips until the line termination. In that high flow, that was interesting,... to say the least. On the second dive we tried to get to the Wh it e Room, but once again, we reached 1/3 of our air supply before getting there. Kevin did a lost line drill&amp;we also did a lost diver drill. Thurs. Oct.28th- We were back at Peacock again. The first dive we swam 1900ft to the end of the Peanut Line, through a very tight restriction. Larry decided to let us try it . We wiped it out (sand, so it settled out very quickly). Swimming back out, Larry had us set up a jump at a very silty tunnel. Both the guys had a lot of trouble. Fortunately, I did well w it h it . On the way out, Larry went through a lot of drills&amp;failures. I got to air share w it h him w it h multiple tank valve roll off’s of my secondary regulator. I had to keep reaching back to turn it back on. It was qu it e a busy dive. The second dive was our graduation dive. We went up the Pot Hole Line to a low, silty tunnel. The goal was to swim up it w it hout stirring up silt. The tricky part there was also another class going in there, so it was Larry&amp;our group of 3 ...

 And
 
 Chicken Wing Tteokbokki topped w it h Cheese 
 and
 
 WTF: Waffles topped w it h Strawberry Syrup 
 I would normally say, restaurant owners: WTF, but in Korea it seems to work. It seems to work very well. Bloated menus w it h thousands of it ems and l it tle novelty things like PATBINGU and WAFFLES W IT H STRAWBERRY SYRUP seems to work. Especially in a college town (This Fish and Grill was in Gyeongju&apos;s Seonggun-dong), but all I have to say is WTF.

Next time, I will insist on picking the restaurant , because here it was qu it e bleh. We didn&apos;t go for the food but for the company, but shouldn&apos;t they go together?

Anyone else had experiences like this? Warn us where not to go in the comments section^^

 Last Week&apos;s Tw it ter Links [more] Nipun shares: A fascinating research points out the surprising power of neighborly advice -- in experiments, participants more accurately predicted their reactions to a future event when they knew how a neighbor in their social network had reacted to it than when they knew about the event it self.  In one experiment, women made more accurate predictions about how much they would enjoy a date w it h a man when they knew how much another woman in their social network enjoyed dating the man than when they just read the man’s personal profile and saw his photograph. In another experiment, men and women made more accurate predictions about how they would feel after being evaluated by a peer when they knew how another person in their social network had felt after being evaluated than when they previewed the evaluation it self. Moreover, by a wide margin, participants (and judges) held the oppos it e intu it ion -- that personal analysis in isolation would be more powerful than neighborly advice. My moral of the story: servant leaders are more effective because they understand this bias and seek out neighborly advice.

He has studied religion, been a champion junior golfer and worked under a Japanese chef who wore only underpants. Now David Chang&apos;s Michelin-starred noodle bars – and especially his pork belly buns – have made him New York&apos;s hottest chef

David Chang never set out to be the king of pork buns, and the fact that this is now the case is something he finds a l it tle weird. As he puts it : &quot;Can you imagine being Neil Diamond and having to sing &apos;Cracklin&apos; Rosie&apos; every time you get on stage for the rest of your life?&quot; The whole thing was an accident. In 2004, Chang signed a lease on his first Manhattan restaurant , a noodle bar he called Momofuku, which means &quot;lucky peach&quot; in Japanese, but is also a nod to the inventor of instant noodles, Momofuku Ando. The menu was simple: ramen noodles w it h shredded pork, $7; Momofuku ramen w it h pork and a poached egg, $12; spicy noodles, $9; rice w it h chicken and egg, $10. The business was cash only. But he had no business to speak of. No one came. Chang would gaze on the &quot;terrible&quot; Japanese place across the street, which was always packed, and wonder what in hell he was doing wrong.

His luck only changed when he decided that if he was going to go bust, he should do it in style, and cook whatever he felt like. He added bowls of tripe and sweetbreads to the menu, and a Korean-inspired burr it o. In time, it was normal for Chang to rock up for work and see a l it tle crowd outside, wa it ing for him to open. But it was his pork buns that people were really mad for. &quot;Every ticket started to have a pork bun on it ,&quot; he says. &quot;Four people would get four orders of pork buns. They&apos;re only pork belly sandwiches, and usually people are so afraid of fat. I didn&apos;t understand it . It &apos;s not like we reinvented the wheel.&quot; He shrugs. Six years on, 33-year-old Chang is the owner of six New York restaurant s, one of which – Momofuku Ko – has two Michelin stars. Is it fair to say that he owes all this to pork buns? &quot;Oh, yes. I wouldn&apos;t be here today if it wasn&apos;t for pork belly.&quot;

What makes his pork buns so special? Chang wriggles on his banquette (we are in a London hotel; he is here to publicise his Momofuku cookbook). &quot;I&apos;ve no idea! We needed stuff to fill out the menu, we had pork belly because ramen is pork-based, and there are only so many ways you can turn it into a dish. That&apos;s all. People say I&apos;m playing dumb when I tell them this, but I&apos;m not.&quot; Chang&apos;s pork is, however, served w it h hoisin sauce, pickles, cucumber and spring onions, exactly like the Peking duck served in most Chinese restaurant s; the difference is that he has swapped pancakes for the pillowy steamed bread that is more commonly eaten in northern China. Where did he get this idea? Apparently, he nicked it . &quot;I&apos;ve had more meals at Oriental Garden in Chinatown [in New York] than anywhere else, and they served their Peking duck w it h buns rather than pancakes.&quot; He asked the restaurant &apos;s owner, Mr Choi, how to make steamed buns – and was promptly directed to a Chinese restaurant supply company. He started using this company himself and, in his cookbook , he suggests that the home cook guiltlessly vis it s the freezer section of the nearest Chinese supermarket. Sure, they&apos;re perfectly easy to bake. But why kill yourself? After all, he built a small empire on bought-in buns.

Chang is the son of Korean immigrants and the food that he cooks is an inspired and occasionally counterintu it ive fusion of Korean and the American. But then there are other twists. Chang grew up in Washington, and has relatives in Richmond, Virginia, which technically counts as the South. He also, as a young man, spent time working in k it chens in Japan. So, he knows his gr it s, his barbecue, and his ham; and he also knows that, among other things, it takes 17 hours to make proper ramen. Combine all this w it h his technical expertise and you will understand that, on Chang&apos;s table, qu it e a lot is going on. He is perhaps the only chef in the world who can put kimchi – the spicy, fizzy, sweet-sour fermented cabbage he adores – on the same menu as his own riff on red-eye gravy. He makes these juxtapos it ions seem not just daring, but elegant, too. He turns out dishes of astonishing creativ it y and tastiness, but they are also, very often, humble, at least in origin. Chang&apos;s chicken wing s, for instance, look like anyone else&apos;s chicken wing s. Only when you stick one in your mouth, at which point you think: Jeez! How in God&apos;s name did he make these b it s of gristle taste so good ? Answer: they have been brined in a salt-and-sugar solution for a whole day, cold smoked over mesqu it e for 45 minutes, poached in a vat of pork fat for an hour and a half, browned on the grill, and then, finally, glazed in a chicken-infused soy sauce combined w it h mirin, garlic and pickled chilli peppers. There is a reverence for process in Chang&apos;s k it chens that you taste in every b it e; it makes perfect sense to discover that, at college in Connecticut, where he was a religious studies student, he wrote a thesis on Thoreau, a wr it er who believed that quotidian repet it ion and simple living can, in the end, lead a man to happiness and self-fulfillment.

But is Chang happy? Not exactly. Although he used to be known for his temper, and his excessive swearing, these days, he is much calmer. &quot;Before I had my own restaurant , I was never top dog in the k it chen. I&apos;ve always had a low opinion of myself as a cook. I was always yelled at by the chefs I worked for. It was like high school. You&apos;re the freshman, and the seniors are so cool, like gods; I never thought I&apos;d be one of them.&quot; He thinks this att it ude may have something to do w it h his once having been a junior golf champion. &quot;I was qu it e cocky, but having been hailed as this great young golfer, I couldn&apos;t even make the high school golf team once I got there. I had a big dose of humble pie then, and ever since, I&apos;ve always known that there is always someone out there better than you, more talented. Always.&quot;

 Chang&apos;s father, Joe, had just $50 to his name when he arrived in America. He started out as a dish washer, then opened a couple of restaurant s before starting a golf supply business ( it was successful enough that he was able to lend his son $200,000 when he decided to open his first noodle bar).

After college, and stints at the Mercer K it chen and Craft, Chang knew he wanted to work as an apprentice in a Japanese noodle shop. His father knew a Korean businessman who had turned part of a Tokyo building into a ramen shop; upstairs was a church and shelter for the homeless. The friend said he could work in the shop, and sleep in the shelter. Unfortunately, the ramenya turned out to be a dive. The chef wore only his underpants, no trousers or shirt, and tucked into his apron strings were greasy newspapers which, for some reason, he favoured over tea towels. He was also a chain smoker w it h a strong aversion to refrigerators. Chang was only able to stick it out for a few days. His next berth – a soba shop – was better, and the one after that – a kaiseki restaurant – a life-changing experience.

But he missed America and so, in the end, he went home. In New York, he chose to work for Daniel Boulud, on the grounds that Boulud was a superstar who had worked for &quot;t it ans&quot; such as Michel Guerard. He had jet lag the day he started there, and he felt like he still had jet lag the day he left. &quot;I couldn&apos;t get to work early enough. No matter how early I got there, I was already behind when I walked through the door.&quot; He lasted five months, though he only left because his mother was ill, and he wanted to look after her.

His mother on the mend, he touched his father for a loan, and set up Momofuku on the s it e of an old chicken wing place in the East Village. He worked like a dog – and still does. He has no time for anything else. A few years ago, wanting to furnish his apartment, he went into Crate&amp;Barrel, pointed at the nearest mocked-up room, and said: &quot;Just give me all of that.&quot; Nothing has changed indoors since. As for a private life, am I kidding? His parents are desperate for him to find a nice Korean girl. &quot;I wish! But it &apos;s so hard.&quot; Nor is he willing to respond to the siren call of television. &quot;I do b it s, but it &apos;s not something I&apos;m comfortable w it h. I doubt I&apos;d ever do television to the extent that, say, Gordon Ramsay has. It &apos;s always, to some degree, a real it y show – or they want me to be yelling at people. &apos;Just get mad!&apos; they say. I think you can be successful w it hout it .&quot;

He is obsessed w it h standards, and worries aloud to me about the future of cooking. &quot;People are getting famous now for serving food out of a truck , or for, well, pork buns. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m really pleased to be a part of that. I&apos;m somewhat terrified of what the future holds, especially in America. I don&apos;t think we&apos;re producing the cooks we used to produce. I think a cook has to have a classical French foundation, and if not that then a classical Japanese foundation. Someone has to discipline the young chefs. Now if you ask a young chef who the Roux brothers were, they&apos;re not going to know, and they don&apos;t care that they don&apos;t know!&quot; His face is as plump and as round as a baby&apos;s, but he sounds suddenly very old. I want to cheer him up. What&apos;s the dish he&apos;s most proud of? &quot;My mum says everything I make is too salty,&quot; he says, w it h a forlorn laugh. Poor thing. If he wasn&apos;t due at Claude Bosi&apos;s k it chen at Hibiscus – the two of them are cooking a special tasting menu together – I would take him home and feed him a toasted cheese sandwich.

A postscript. All the talk of pork buns has left me plainly desperate to eat one. So Chang and I strike a deal: I will toddle over to Hibiscus while he is prepping for the big dinner, and he will feed me. This I duly do. There follows the strangest encounter. At 4pm Chang emerges from the k it chen, and makes his way, zen-like, through the dining room to the front desk, where I am wa it ing. He is very sweaty. In his hand is an oval-shaped stainless platter which he carries before him, butler-style, and on it is a single and somewhat exiguous pork bun. I pick it up, and put it in my mouth. It &apos;s great: warm and pillowy w it hout, salty and sweet w it hin. But I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m only allowed one! &quot;Don&apos;t I get another?&quot; I say. He shakes his head. &quot;No.&quot; He smiles, offers his hand, and then turns on his heel, back to the k it chen. Was he being priestly – it felt to me as if I&apos;d just taken communion – or was he merely embarrassed at my having travelled for the best part of an hour merely to taste his oh-so-humble dish? I really don&apos;t know – though his delectable offering has stayed w it h me. I wonder when, exactly, I will get my seconds.

 Rant of the Day (There&apos;s Someone on the Wing !!) 
 [ Israel ] ( The Muqata )

I wonder how many readers remember my infamous Manila posts, my rant about a certain restaurant in London, the origin of the Muqata Wafflemaker or Elvis the Drug Dealer Regardless, I don&apos;t rant everyday but it s time to let off some steam.

 [details] [close] received 1 year ago  published 1 year ago  lang: en   There was a time when I used to post all sorts of stories like the upcoming one. I wonder how many readers remember my infamous Manila posts, my rant about a certain restaurant in London, the origin of the Muqata Wafflemaker or Elvis the Drug Dealer... 

Regardless, I don&apos;t rant everyday but it s time to let off some steam.

Last time I flew to India for business, I brought all my food w it h me. Not that there&apos;s so much Kosher food to eat in India to begin w it h, but I brought everything : cereal, boxed milk, tuna-fish, p it ot , a bunch of manachama (manot chamot) [just add hot water for an instant meal], and bottled water.

I sparingly ate every meal kno wing that there was no margin of error, and I didn&apos;t want to get stranded w it hout any Kosher food.

After a few days, it was time to fly home to Israel, via London and I was thrilled that I&apos;d have a &quot;normal&quot; kosher meal on the plane, even if it was &quot;airline food&quot;.

During check-in, I double checked to ensure that my kosher meal was in fact reserved, and I&apos;d be receiving it on my flight. All was in order.

Luckily for me, this leg of the trip was in business class and I sat in the upper deck of the plane (you&apos;ll soon see why this factoid is important for the story)

About 30 minutes into the flight, the stewardess (air-hostess? what&apos;s the proper pol it ically correct term?) came by and reassured me that my kosher meal would be ready shortly. My stomach growled in anticipation -- I guess there&apos;s something about flights that makes one hungrier than usual, and having spent the week rationing my food, I was famished.

 Meal service began.

Meals were given out one at a time, as I hungrily looked on in anticipation...one more minute...and I&apos;d have &quot;normal&quot; food for the first time in a week.

And then, the stewardess smiled and presented my meal to me.

A linen napkin covered tray w it h steaming hot food, smiled at me.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; I said, &quot;I ordered a Kosher meal.&quot;

 &quot;This is a Kosher meal,&quot; stated the stewardess, as she smiled and pointed to a piece of paper wr it ten in Hebrew, Yiddish and English which was neatly lying on the tray.

Shaking my head in hungry disbelief I asked, &quot;didn&apos;t you see that the entire tray was wrapped in plastic, w it h big red letters on it , &quot; ONLY TO BE OPENED BY THE PASSENGER &quot;, and that the hot dish of the meal had the same warning on it ?&quot;

The stewardess smiled back, &quot;This is India. They didn&apos;t want you to feel bad that your meal looked different than everyone else&apos;s, so food services opened up your meal, and we heated it up w it h everyone&apos;s food, so you wouldn&apos;t feel different than everyone else .&quot;

 It took a minute for all this to sink in.

&quot;Do you know that I&apos;m not able to eat this now?&quot; I asked?

The stewardess sighed.

I asked her if she could look out the window of the airplane for a second, and if she could read what it said in big letters on the wing .

 
&quot; DO NOT WALK OUTSIDE THIS AREA ,&quot; she read from the wing .

&quot; Exactly! &quot;, I said, &quot;Maybe...just maybe someone in the India ground crew thought the wing would &apos;feel bad,&apos; and walked all over the wing . After all, you can walk on other parts of the airplane, but not that specific part of the wing , and we wouldn&apos;t want the wing to feel differently, would we? Even though there&apos;s a clear warning on it , how do we know that no one walked all over it ?&quot;

The stewardess nodded her head seriously and said, &quot;You&apos;re absolutely right. Would you like anything else to eat?&quot;

She managed to find me some fru it and a coke.



Ten minutes later I was surprised when a member of the cockp it crew, perhaps the Captain or Co-pilot walked over to me.

He bent down to talk to me and in a very serious voice said, &quot;We radioed back to Bangalore airport. Apparently, the person you saw walking on the plane&apos;s wing was a fuel technician, and he is specially trained where he is allowed to walk on the wing , and where not to walk.&quot;

I stared at him in disbelief.

&quot;I didn&apos;t say I saw someone walking on the wing ,&quot; I blurted out, &quot;I was trying to make a point by comparison of my meal to the wing , and how instructions should be listened to...&quot;

The cockp it officer gave me a puzzled look, and said, &quot;I thought you would be happy to know that the person you saw on the wing knew where he was allowed to walk.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; I said, &quot;I&apos;m very relieved now,&quot; and he turned around going back into the cockp it .

No one seemed to &quot;get it .&quot;

And why am I reminded of this now?

I&apos;m going back to India soon, and needed to apply for a visa. The procedure required that I provide my current and expired Israeli passports, as well as my US passport to the Indian Embassy in Tel Aviv.

Now, my US passport was very recently issued and is therefore a &quot; USA Electronic Passport &quot;. You can tell from the weird symbol underneath the word &quot;Passport&quot; that this is electronic passport.

 The exc it ing features of an electronic passport include some of the follo wing (but isn&apos;t lim it ed to)...

* Securely stored biographical information and dig it al image that are identical to the information that is visually displayed in the passport;

* Contactless chip/RFID technology that allows the information stored in an Electronic Passport to be read by special chip readers at a close distance; and

* Dig it al signature technology that is used to verify the authentic it y of the data stored on the chip. This technology is commonly used in cred it cards and other secure documents using integrated circu it s or chips.

 Sounds great, right? 

Located on the inside back cover (where the electronics are located) is a message in clear, bold, block letters:

 THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS SENS IT IVE ELECTRONICS:
FOR BEST PERFORMANCE, DO NOT BEND, OR PERFORATE,
OR EXPOSE TO EXTREME TEMPERATURES 

Imagine my surprise when I received my Israeli passport w it h the new visa to India in it and all my other passports...AND THEY WERE ALL STAPLED TOGETHER BY THEIR BACK COVERS.

The &quot;do not perforate&quot; rule doesn&apos;t apply to India...(after all, you wouldn&apos;t want your passport to &quot;feel bad&quot; that other passports can be perforated, and not new US electronic passports...so who cares what it says...who cares if it ruins the electronics?)

Will this affect the valid it y of my US passport, now that it has 7 pairs of staple marks in the back cover, probably ruining all the high tech invested in it ?

Probably not yet, but I doubt the friendly people in TSA will care or even believe me when I say, &quot; it &apos;s not my fault, the Indian embassy in Tel-Aviv did it ,&quot; as they drag me off to one of those newfangled full body naked scanners.
 
PS: My travel agent informed me today that the airline I&apos;m flying on from India to London leg of my trip, no longer offers Kosher meals when leaving India. I guess follo wing directions proved to be impossible...

 49ers; The Old Heart Attack Kids Are Not Yet a Cohesive Team 
 [ New England Patriots , Sports , Fantasy Football ] ( Bleacher Report - Front Page )
I’ve been a 49er fan since 1980, the year my new father-in-law took me under his wing and taught me how to watch a football game. He was a well-known radio announcer for the Denver Broncos and was appalled that I did not watch football because I thought football to be a game for dumb jocks.

 I’ve been a 49er fan since 1980, the year my new father-in-law took me under his wing and taught me how to watch a football game. He was a well-known radio announcer for the Denver Broncos and was appalled that I did not watch football because I thought football to be a game for dumb jocks. Sho wing me the strategies, tactics and skills used in the game, as well as introducing me to several professional football players, among them a doctor, a philosopher and one soon-to-be history professor disavowed me of my old prejudices and gave me a new and wonderful pleasure to pursue. 

Craig Morton, the Bronco quarterback during the “Orange Crush” days, met us for dinner one night after a game, walking in w it h the help of two clumping, heavy, metal canes. I had watched him wander about the pocket for the entire game and it never occurred to me that he was playing on painful knees that had long since seen their better days. I found him to be humorous, urbane and educated, as well as gr it ty as all hell playing on those knees and still winning games. I do not remember what we ate, but I remember Craig Morton.

Since I lived in the San Francisco Bay area, my team became the about-to-be “Team Of The Eighties” 49ers.

I know a b it about management of groups of people from my mil it ary and business days and what I have seen so far this year is a dispir it ed bunch of guys trying to play football w it hout being part of a team. They have no morale and almost no team spir it . Three people have walked away from the group so far this year in displeasure. The group expects their fellows to let them down, and, because there is no team as such, it does let them down. There may be no “I” in “team” but there is no team in the current 49ers, e it her.
 
The group of 53 players has impressive talent on both sides of the ball, but it does not have a center—and I’m talking about group dynamics here, not the pos it ion. Coach Singletary is the kind of guy I’d love to have over for dinner, a man guaranteed to entertain w it h great stories and a full and impressive personal it y. Singletary is a Hall of Fame football player, a man to be reckoned w it h. And he deserves kudos because he showed up when the team needed him in the middle of a playing season. I firmly believe he has given his best to the 49ers. He gave us all hope for a while.

But the 53 individuals are not yet a team and that is the first prior it y of a coach. The 49ers are a bunch of talented individual football players w it hout being a cohesive group.

As an example of team building skills, 49ers&apos; coach Bill Walsh had an old boxer’s trick he used in coaching. Boxers are often trained to try differing punches, footwork and defenses during the first round, “feeling out” the opponent. Based on the reaction of the opponent to these tests, the boxer’s manager could then plot a course for his man to use during the rest of the bout.

Bill Walsh, a boxer in college, would script 15 or so varied plays for a game, having them practiced and ready to go at kickoff. As the scripted plays played out in the first quarter, he could analyze the oppos it ion’s reactions to them and then modify the game plan based on the success or failure of those first testing plays. He would “feel out” the oppos it ion, testing the talent, speed, reaction time, strengths, weaknesses and the knowledge of the opposing players on that particular day. And, importantly, he would stay intellectually nimble during the course of the game.
 
Other, purely team building exercises were used. I remember a cat fishing day when the pond at the training facil it y was stocked w it h fish. The whole team was issued poles and ba it and the day was followed by a fish fry. Other times, there was a restaurant that the whole team met at on the Monday follo wing games to eat hamburgers and generally mix w it h one another. This forced the people on the team to get to know one another apart from football, to give them some semblance of a cohesive group.

The result was that teams the 49ers played against often did not know what h it them. They blamed the “West Coast Offense,” as if Walsh was cheating to be playing the game of w it s as well as brawn. They said he used short passes like running plays, as if that was going against the culture of smash-mouth professional football. They complained he used “finesse” against them, as if psychological strategies were alien to football. But he forged a team that won football games, many of which a lesser coach and team would have lost. They won so many tough games in the last few minutes (or seconds) that my gang of fans labeled them “The Heart Attack Kids.”

Walsh seemed uncanny at explo it ing the weaknesses of the oppos it ion, even when the oppos it ion appeared to be (and often was) the stronger team. Remember the Chicago Bears, in their house and their freezing weather? I’ll bet Coach Sing does. That is why the guys came together as a coherent self-sacrificing team for him. They suspected he knew more than they did, they admired and looked to him for solutions. His creativ it y on the sidelines became legendary in the NFL and his “suggestions” were followed even when the team members had no idea what he was up to. Even w it h the many changes in personal it ies that came and went during his tenure, this cohesion of the team could be easily noticed and was often noted by his ex-teammates. Many, very successful under his tutelage, went on to other teams, w it h mixed results.
 
The team went through a period where it produced an inordinate number of stars for a single team. But it was not only the talent of the players that made them stars; talent is a prerequis it e to get into the NFL in the first place. It was the brilliant creativ it y of the coach that made their play so successful and their winning games so commonplace. Nothing makes a star as quickly as winning does.

There was a time when the fact that the San Francisco 49ers were coming to your house to play you was a fact that engendered both fear and awe in both players and fans. That psychological edge won some games in and of it self.

I would love to see that 1980’s dynamic return, but sadly I cannot clone Bill Walsh, so it is up to the team owners to find a creative and effective team builder to forge this group into a team. If Coach Singletary can forge them into a team, then they will begin winning and he can save his budding career. If he cannot, they will continue to lose in the last few minutes and the 49ers will be looking for a new coach.

If they look to a new coach, they would be well served to look at coaches that do creative things w it h a team—and are successful. They would be wise to look for a coach that can bring a group of guys together as a coherent team and, as is often said, feels like a “family.” The team model is not unlike the Army squad or the Air Force ‘finger’ flight of four fighters, a small group of guys that cover each other’s back every day, help each other and become so loyal they hate to leave the field of operations because of the loss of that closeness to and dependence on other members of the team.

The ownership and Coach Singletary has the onus of doing something dramatic, and soon, if they want fans to fill the seats and for the 49ers to make a prof it . The current 49ers are “The Heart Attack Kids” again, but for a decidedly negative reason.

Scott&amp;I spent the weekend in Charleston, SC for his 10th C it adel reunion. It was the first time I was back in Charleston since our wedding  and since I was vegan. 

 

Although the South--and especially Charleston, is known for it s hosp it al it y, I had to wonder how hosp it able it would be to some rather picky vegans from New York C it y.

Turns out the South has charm even for the vegans. Three of the restaurant s we vis it ed, Caviar&amp;Bananas ,  Fish and Mellow Mushroom , had vegan options on the menu. (C&amp;B actually had a vegan sandwich called &quot;Herbivore&quot; which I just *had* to order). Then, Coleman Public House had vegetarian it ems aplenty (that were easily adaptable to be vegan) and even Wild Wing s  (a famous wing house) bent over backwards to create two vegan dishes we could eat! (p.s. I think my idea to put their famous BBQ sauce (that&apos;s vegan!) over some fries was pure genius! It was like eating the wing s again but w it hout the cruelty and cholesterol!)

I also found this l it tle gem that was vegan, too:

 

 A Charleston Sweet Tea Vodka Martini.  

 And we enjoyed one of our most beloved Southern foods which are naturally vegan---boiled peanuts! 

 

Here are some photos from the C it adel reunion: 

 

Inside the barracks Scott lived in (the checkered floor is called the &quot;Quad&quot;)

 

Scott (in blue) saluting his company as they passed by during parade.

 

Our beach house--qu it e the spacious change from our NYC studio!

 

Also, here, Scott&amp;I are s it ting at the exact table, in the exact seats, where we met almost seven years ago. It was purely accidental that we ended up at this restaurant (we&apos;d ducked in to get out of the rain and suddenly realized where we were). When the hostess asked us if we wanted to stay for a drink, and we saw that our table was open, we sat and savored the seven years we&apos;ve been together. It was a fine start to a memorial trip.

Going back was indeed interesting. It feels as though we lived there many lifetimes ago. I suppose it is true, then, that life does indeed change you and w it h each passing moment, you are a new and slightly different person.
 
 MEN&apos;S FILE PARTY AT RALPH LAUREN 
 [ Motorcycles ] ( The Vintagent )
While best known in the motoring world for his collection of exquis it e cars, Ralph Lauren is one savvy character, and it &apos;s merely a matter of time before we see his silver-haired visage at Pebble Beach, standing beside some outrageous two-wheeled acquis it ion.

 [details] [close] received 1 year ago  published 1 year ago  lang: en   While best known in the motoring world for his collection of exquis it e cars, Ralph Lauren is one savvy character, and it &apos;s merely a matter of time before we see his silver-haired visage at Pebble Beach , standing beside some outrageous two-wheeled acquis it ion.
 
The only speculation will be, &apos;which bike?&apos;... and judging by the recent Men&apos;s File magazine party at the flagship RL store on Boulevard St. Germain in Paris, I have a pretty good guess what his first purchase might look like.
 
As noted in these pages previously, not since the late 1960s have the disparate worlds of motorcycles, fashion, art, photography, publishing, and film/video collided in such a spectacular manner. There&apos;s motion afoot, and two recent parties in completely different parts of the world illustrate my point. The scene in LA ( see my Comune post ) has already well integrated the vintage and custom motorcycle scene into the world of &apos;swimming pools and movie stars&apos;; the Men&apos;s File party was a checkered flag planted on new soil, the ultra-chic 6th Arrondissement , right across the street from legendary cafés de Flore and Deux Magots .
 
The connection between Men&apos;s File and the Double RL (&apos;RRL&apos;) boutique atop the chez Ralph is a natural, as RRL is the &apos;vintage&apos;-inspired branch of the Lauren empire...yes I know all RL is &apos;vintage inspired&apos;, and some lines fairly dated and bourgeois, but the man has recognized and seized on the late-cap it alist-era desire for &apos;authentic it y&apos; and &apos;her it age&apos; more successfully than any other company. Sticking true to a uniquely Anglo/preppy aesthetic, he has become the authentic it y he sought to create, transforming himself in the process from Ralph Lifsh it z, a poor Brooklyn immigrant&apos;s son, to the scion of American clothing culture. Such is his success, and such the state of American culture, that no paradox is seen between the &apos;her it age branding&apos; of the man and his business, and chimerical creation of that her it age from whisps of air and inspiration....such is his genius, and his exemplification of the uniquely American promise of a renewed ident it y for any striving individual.
 
 Men&apos;s File , having recently pressed it s third issue , is treading similar ground to Double RL, exploring the worlds of cars, motorcycles, fashion, surfing, bicycling, et al, from a distincly &apos;vintage&apos; perspective, in search of the Timeless. As RL has done, MF is digging through grandfather&apos;s trunk to find what is relevant today - and that old fisherman&apos;s sweater or Red Wing boots or &apos;66 Triumph still looks pretty damn good.
 
The photography is exceptional, especially the work of Nick Clements , who has a knack for setting up &apos;s it uations&apos; w it h models and vehicles which have the feel of the past, yet are completely contemporary and use mostly clothing which is available in stores, occasionally even designed/sold by Nick himself.  [As I&apos;ve been privileged to w it ness one, I&apos;ll dive into a Men&apos;s File photo shoot in another post] .
 
If you&apos;re reading this, you&apos;re interested in exactly what Men&apos;s File is offering; it &apos;s the best magazine printed today exploring how our &apos;magnificent obsession&apos; can be contextualized in our modern world. Shameless plug - support qual it y publishing!
 
Now back to the party: the miracle of the s it uation was the easy mix between very different worlds, from the bemusement of the ladies from &apos;bonne familles&apos; shopping for the latest RL fashion, to a horde of 60 bikers who rode in for what was clearly a novel event. The crowd was international, w it h vis it ors from the US, England, and all of Europe. The stars of the evening were the motorcycles, which included a plinth display of Yves J. Hayat&apos;s beautiful l it tle Velocette MAC s it ting beside what is perhaps my favor it e production design of all time, a 1928 Brough Superior &apos;Pendine&apos; w it h straight open pipes and no street gear.
 
Three other Broughs, provided by Mark Upham of Brough Superior , sat outside the RL store, lending heavy-h it ter caché to the party, and looking completely at home on the Boulevard w it h the fancy ladies walking by in their minks. Even rough-knuckled and staggering &apos;Basil&apos; Brough, swilling a heady brew of pure alcohol in great gulps through wide open bellmouths. Basil was built for sidecar racing and wears heavy boots, his brawn held in check by steel straps and bars, like Kong. The ladies got a secret thrill from his &apos;gorilla in a tux&apos; demeanor.
 
As the evening wore on, the street began to fill w it h the creme of the Parisian vintage bike scene, especially the Tr it on Club of France, whose members brought out some very impressive machinery. First to arrive was a proper Tr it on in green, second a covetable Triumph Thruxton - and I&apos;m not talking about a new one, this looked the proper business, ca. &apos;67.
 
The atrium of the RL compound, as well as the bar and Ralph&apos;s restaurant (yes, a bar and resto at retail...civil!) filled completely w it h hundreds of revellers, and the store was open to browsers, especially the Double RL salon in the penthouse, which had an exhib it of Nick Clement&apos;s photos plus other contributors to the magazine. The photos of course looked completely at home nestled between vintage horsehide &apos;D&apos; pocket jackets, reproduced shawl-collar sweaters, and native American jewelry. In truth, RL should just buy Men&apos;s File and make it the coolest &apos;house media organ&apos; imaginable...but for now, we can treasure MF&apos; s independence of vision, and the fact that they feature plenty of interesting suppliers of clothing, gear, bikes, accessories, etc.
 
Highlight of the evening was the &apos;forbidden&apos; firing up of the Pendine, it s sharp crackling thunder banging on the stucco walls of the great House of Lauren, filling the atrium w it h liquid sound, rattling the thin glass separating fine cashmere and pearls from the healthy roar of motorcycling Life, declaiming to the full moon it self, &apos;We are Here&apos;.

Once elected, the man who won the Wh it e House was no longer viewed as a Republican or Democrat, but the President of the Un it ed States. The oath of office was taken, the wagons were circled around the countrys borders and it was America versus the rest of the world w it h the president of all the people at the helm. Suddenly President Barack Obama, w it h the potential to become an exceptional president has become the glaring exception to that unwr it ten, patriotic rule. Four days before President Obamas inauguration, before he officially took charge of the American government, Rush Limbaugh boasted publicly that he hoped the president would fail. Of course, when the president fails the country flounders. Wishing harm upon your country in order to further your own narrow pol it ical views is selfish, sinister and a tad treasonous as well. Subsequently, during his State of the Union address, which is pretty much a pep rally for America, an unknown congressional representative from South Carolina, later identified as Joe Wilson, stopped the show when he called the President of the Un it ed States a liar. The president showed great restraint in ignoring this unprecedented insult and carried on w it h his speech. Speaker Nancy Pelosi was so stunned by the slur, she forgot to jump to her feet while clapping wildly, 30 or 40 times after that. Last spring, President Obama took his wife Michelle to see a play in New York C it y and republicans attacked him over the cost of secur it y for the excursion. The president cant take his wife out to dinner and a show w it hout being scrutinized by the pol it ical oppos it ion? As history has proven, a president in a theatre w it hout adequate secur it y is a tragically bad idea. Remember: Apart from that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play? At some point, the treatment of President Obama went from offensive to ugly and then to downright dangerous. The health-care debate, which looked more like extreme fighting in a mud p it than a national dialogue, revealed a very vulgar side of America. President Obamas face appeared on protest signs wh it e-faced and blood-mouthed in a satanic clown image. In other tasteless portrayals, people who disagreed w it h his pos it ion distorted his face to look like H it ler complete w it h mustache and swastika. Odd, that burning the flag makes Americans crazy, but depicting the president as a clown and a maniacal fascist is accepted as part of the new rude America. Maligning the image of the leader of the free world is one thing, putting the presidents life in peril is qu it e another. More than once, men w it h guns were videotaped at the health-care rallies where the president spoke. Again, history shows that letting men w it h guns get w it hin range of a president has not served America well in the past. And still the birthers are out there claiming Barack Obama was not born in the Un it ed States, although public documentation proves otherwise. Hawaii is defin it ely part of the Un it ed States, but the Panama Canal Zone where his electoral opponent Senator John McCain was born? Nobodys sure. Last month, a 44-year-old woman in Buffalo was qu it e taken by President Obama when she met him in a chicken wing restaurant called Duffs. Did she say something about a pleasure and an honour to meet the man or utter encouraging words for the difficult job he is doing? No. Quote: Youre a hottie w it h a smokin l it tle body. Lady, that was the President of the Un it ed States you were addressing, not one of the Jonas Brothers! Hes your president for goodness sakes, not the guy driving the Zamboni at Monster Trucks On Ice. Maybe next it ll be, Take Your President To A Topless Bar Day. In President Barack Obama, Americans have a charismatic leader w it h a good and honest heart. Unlike his predecessor, hes a very intelligent leader. And unlike that presidents predecessor, hes a highly moral man. In President Obama, Americans have the real deal, the whole package and a leader that c it izens of almost every country around the world look to w it h great envy. Given the opportun it y, Canadians would trade our leader, hell, most of our leaders for Obama in a heartbeat. What America has in Obama is a head of state w it h v it al it y and insight and youth. Think about it , Barack Obama is a young Nelson Mandela. Mandela was the face of change and char it y for all of Africa but he was too old to make it happen. The great things Obama might do for America and the world could go on for decades after hes out of office. America, you know not what you have. The man is being challenged unfairly, characterized w it h vulgar it y and treated w it h the kind of deep disrespect to which no previous president was subjected. It s like the day after electing the first black man to be president, thereby electrifying the world w it h hope and joy, Americans sobered up and decided the bad old days were better. President Obama may fail but it will not be a Richard Nixon default fraught w it h larceny and lies. President Obama, given a fair chance, will surely succeed but his triumph will never come w it h a Bill Clinton caveat  if only hed got control of that zipper. Please. Give the man a fair, fighting chance. This incivil it y toward the leader who won over Americans and gave hope to billions of people around the world that their lives could be enhanced by his example, just naturally has to stop. Believe me, when Americans drive by the Wh it e House and see a sign on the lawn that reads: No shirt. No shoes. No service, theyll realize this new national rudeness has gone way, way too far.

 Remember the good old days, when families used to s it down for dinner together? No? Well, no worries, because a handful of Seattle&apos;s most beloved restaurant s are resurrecting the trad it ion of Sunday supper w it h a series of monthly or weekly dinners. In a c it y known for it s comm it ment to green living and locavorism , it just makes sense

Each meal is served at a communal table, and dishes are family-style, passed from one diner to the next. Communal dining is exploding in popular it y nationally, for a variety of reasons. The poor economy makes family-style meals a smart choice--for chefs and restaurateurs, as well as diners--and comfort food, even if it &apos;s gussied up, is popular in trying times. These dinners also foster a sense of commun it y, and provide a resp it e from the shackles of ringing cell phones and pinging in-boxes. Bonus: they&apos;re a great way to make new friends ( it &apos;s amazing what wine can do).

The public&apos;s gro wing interest and concern over our food supply is also a likely factor for the popular it y of family dinners, since they usually have a strong emphasis on regional product. Diners get a chance to learn about family farms and seasonal eating, sometimes w it h the growers in attendance. Some chefs choose a theme for each meal, and plan their menus ahead, while others prefer to wing it , looking to the farmers market for inspiration. E it her way, a Sunday supper is a way to engage w it h the local scene...even if you&apos;re just vis it ing. Don&apos;t forget to make a reservation.

 Palace K it chen 
 Sunday dinners debut November 7th at pioneering PacNW chef Tom Douglas&apos; iconic, downtown restaurant . Chef de cuisine Brian Walcyzk will prepare three courses for $30, including Prosser Farms acorn squash salad w it h maple-pancetta vinaigrette, Beacon Hill arugula, and ricotta salata, and applewood sp it -roasted turkey breast. Dinners will run weekly throughout the month, and into December.

Tea Party America | Tw it chers | Ace of Cakes | Coppers | Made in Sheffield | The Trip

Tea Party America: This World
7pm, BBC2

The Tea Party movement that has dominated US pol it ics in the last year or so is precisely the sort of occurrence that Europeans will be predisposed to find quaint – both because it is ridiculous (Americans complaining that their government is a socialist tyranny) and because it pretends to patriotic principle (c it izens seeking to remind their government w it h whom ultimate power rests). Andrew Neil saunters through this eruption of petulant rage, considering what this hijacking of the Republican party by it s angry wing means for Obama&apos;s first midterm elections.

Tw it chers: A Very Br it ish Obsession
9pm, BBC4

Tw it chers are birdwatchers-cum-trainspotters who vie w it h each other to spot as many rare birds as possible across the Br it ish Isles. These are men who, at the drop of a hint of a sandhill crane in the Orkneys, will drive all the way up from Sussex to add it to their personal tally, sometimes w it h families in tow. &quot; It &apos;s about birds and people – because they go hand in hand.&quot; says one. Hand in wing , surely? All entertainingly revealing about the anal retention and sheer lack of proportion fundamental to the Br it ish male character. 

Coppers
9pm, Channel 4

A surfe it of series that focus on the bish-bash-bosh! side of policing has devalued the real-life cop doc of late. In contrast, Coppers allows officers and those taken into custody to talk about their lives. The results, as we eavesdrop on life at Medway Custody Su it e, Kent in the first episode, are both bleak and hilarious. Bleak, because so many suspects are sad cases – repeat offenders who get arrested time and time again; hilarious, because of the officers&apos; world-weary perspective on their charges: &quot;They never want their mums to know.&quot;

Ace Of Cakes
9pm, Good Food

Series six of the docusoap about Duff Goldman&apos;s Baltimore bakery. They make novelty cakes. This week their most exc it ing assignment is for the International Bridge, Tunnel And Turnpike Association. Actually, just watching them constructing the cakes is qu it e interesting, but a dryer, less camera-friendly bunch of bakers you could not find. We know Baltimore can&apos;t always be drive-by shootings and fast-talking alcoholic cops, but really.

Made In Sheffield
9pm, Sky Arts 1

Last year&apos;s BBC4 doc Synth Br it annia vis it ed some of this material in a more swish and contextual way, but there&apos;s a lot to be said for the rawness of this film from 2001. Not for Sheffield the pub rock nouveau of London punk. Instead, inspired by the c it y&apos;s industrial noise and a ham radio-style curios it y about electronics, bands like Cabaret Voltaire and the Human League made avant garde noise and, later, era-defining pop. Heaven 17&apos;s Martyn Ware (the Martin Clunes of the scene) is a particularly wonderful interviewee; Phil Oakey is statuesque in both personal it y and haircut. Listen to the voice of Buddha, as they said back then.

The Trip
10pm, BBC2

This new, Michael Winterbottom-directed six parter sees Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon reprise their roles as &quot;themselves&quot; in A Cock and Bull Story as slightly feuding buddies. This time they&apos;re on a voyage around the north of England as Coogan wr it es restaurant reviews for the Observer having broken up w it h his American girlfriend. A lot of it consists of the two trading impressions and funny voices – but the show exists to explore Coogan&apos;s perceived (and actual?) persona as an ennui-riddled womaniser. It &apos;s very self-aware, but often very funny. And an enjoyable foodie travelogue, too.

 7:38  Ok not everything is perfect in the suburbs. Wa it for a party of four at Coastal Flats in Fairfax is more than an hour.

 7:35  Costume reports beginning to filter in. TBD&apos;s Amanda Hess spotted a &quot;candy corn w it ch,&quot; which leaves TBD Night baffled.

 7:30  This from the Buffalo Wing Factory&amp;Pub in Chantilly: No wa it , and $5 buffalo b it es are available all day and night.

 7:27  And a check of the suburbs: According to Kim, the Hooters in Fairfax is not at all crowded. More to come from suburbia.

 7:22  And now for a check of the weather: Temperatures at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport are holding steady at 57 degrees w it h 15 mph winds out of the south and southwest. By midnight, 52 degree temperatures are predicted. Rain is unlikely.

 7:16  The Argonaut on H Street has been &quot;super slammed&quot; since 3, a &quot;nice&quot; bartender tells Sarah Larimer. She says a ton of folks left when she got there (maybe they smelled the sandwich in her purse and got hungry) but bartender expects it to pick back up. When, Larimer asks. His helpful reply: &quot;Nighttime.&quot; He&apos;s got a cool towel though.

 

 

 7:04  Bread&amp;Brew rearranging and removing tables to make room. Loud, but space is still available. 

 7:00  STRONG DRINKS ALERT: at Fox&amp;Hounds, says TBD&apos;s Sommer Mathis. And no wa it !

 6:52  Jamieson fears that the out-of-towners lined up for Jumbo Slice pizza on Barracks Row, particularly the New Yorkers among them, are in for an unpleasant surprise--&quot;that the pizza tastes really sh it ty.&quot;

 6:48  Attention thirsty people of Cap it ol Hill: you have 72 minutes left to enjoy $5 moj it os and margar it as in the moderate-crowded comfort of Fusion Grill. TBD&apos;s Dave Jamieson reports that Matchbox, however, &quot;is hopeless.&quot;

 6:46  Elegance Nails on U Street:

 

Not experiencing a discernible bump in business from rally. Hat tip Erik Wemple.

 6:42  Larimer is now carrying a sandwich in her purse .

 6:35  Taylor&apos;s on H Street has been swamped all day, an employee tells TBD&apos;s Sarah Larimer. Right now Taylor&apos;s is &quot;busy but not insane,&quot; though another rush is expected in the late night.

 

 

 6:25  More from TBD&apos;s Dave Jamieson, reporting live from Cap it ol Hill: Starfish Cafe continues it s October special of $2.50 domestic bottle at all times. Enjoy this deal for the next 29 hours because that&apos;s all you&apos;re getting until next year. Notes Jamieson: &quot;They&apos;re also hyping their po-boys.&quot;

 6:22  Erik Wemple continues his one-man coverage of the economic impact of today&apos;s rally on local businesses. Says Wemple of Peking Express:

&quot;Hard to say whether this spot benef it ed from Stewart-Colbert. When first questioned, employee said, &quot;Not really.&quot; Then she said, &quot;L it tle b it better.&quot;

Wemple interprets these statements to mean that business was slightly better. Also: honey mango chicken is listed as &quot;new chef special&quot; and is compet it ively priced at $10.35.

 

 

 6:16  Exc it ing news for those weary of lines and crowds. TBD&apos;s Sommer Mathis reports that &quot;Stetson&apos;s is basically empty&quot; and the &quot;back patio is quiet.&quot; The dining room is booked at Masa 14, but plenty of room at the bar to take your $5 tequila shots. Bar snacks are $6.

 6:13  Desp it e the crowds, the transportation headaches, and the infin it e wa it for a table practically anywhere in the c it y, life goes on at Edges Barber Beauty Salon on U Street.

 

 Khalid gives his son his trim.

 6:03  TBD&apos;s Erik Wemple brings us an update from the world of local fashion merchandising.

 

Redeem, a 14th Street clothier that sells mostly independent lines, has &quot;experienced the good and the bad from today&apos;s events.&quot; The store was empty of customers during rally time; just in the past few hours has foot traffic been restored. TBD Night wishes them an evening of strong sales.

 5:55  Whew, at least one Barracks Row bar is offering their regular specials tonight. You can still get your $4 Yuengling, $5 Jack Daniels drinks, and discounted nachos and pretzels.

 5:52  TBD&apos;s Dave Jamieson checks in w it h this update from Cap it ol Hill:

Lola&apos;s and Molly Malone&apos;s on Barracks Row are &quot;relatively jammed&quot; and &quot;will probably remain that way for most of the night.&quot;

Jamieson, always looking out for the local consumer, reports that most of the Barracks Row bars &quot;have conspicuously removed their specials signs tonight.&quot; Be wary, Captiol-Hill patrons.

The scene outside Lola&apos;s. Lotta fleece out there.

 

 

 5:42  Seekers of anchovy bruschetta: seek no more. It awa it s you at Cork Wine Bar. No wa it at the present.

 5:40  If you can&apos;t stomach a 2.5 hour wa it at Posto for THIS gorgeous pie: 

 

you can try Pizzeria Orso--reportedly the wa it is just 15 minutes. Of course it might take you 2.5 hours to get to it s Falls Church location.

 5:32  From Dupont Circle: Cafe C it ron is &quot;not packed&quot; according a staff member, but all the tables are full. All three bars are open though, so plenty of room to stand and suck down their delicious moj it os.

 5:28  STOP THE PRESSES. Er, stop the Internet. BREAKING. DRAGON SPOTTING in LOGAN.

 

 TBD&apos;s Elahe Izadi predicts the dragon will be on U Street in minutes.

 5:21  Logan Circle dining establishments packed w it h rally-goers and PATRIOTS (see below); Stoney&apos;s, Logan Tavern, et al are full.

 5:19  PATRIOTS!

 

 Spotted in Logan Circle.

 5:15  Yikes, readers, looks like the aforementioned space at the bar/30 minute wa it at Ping Pong Dim Sum in Chinatown is fiction. &quot;More like an hour wa it ,&quot; according to a new report, and &quot;you can&apos;t just s it at the bar.&quot; Bummer. It &apos;s worse at nearby La Tasca--host says the wa it for a table is two hours.

 5:09  Spotted: TBD Night Car of the TBD Night.

 

A true thing of cherry-colored beauty. Hat tip to Erik Wemple.

 5:00  Reports coming in from all sides about the &quot;chaos&quot; downtown. And I thought this rally was supposed to restore san it y. One TBD reporter, who will remain unnamed, has managed to both step in horse droppings and fall over a child. Folks, get out of the epicenter of all this madness and consider venturing to Cleveland Park, where you will find $4.50 Coronas at Atomic Billiards. Better: hostess says it &apos;s not crowded. 

 4:52  Major bathroom update: unconfirmed report has come in through the social networking service Tw it ter of bathroom hijinx at a downtown Barnes&amp;Noble. Allegedly, women &quot;overtook&quot; the men&apos;s room. Precise location, details unknown. More to come on this developing story.

 4:44  BREAKING: John Legend controversy erupts on Tw it ter. Was his performance at today&apos;s rally &quot;good&quot;? Or was it &quot;BORING&quot;? More to come on this contentious issue.

 4:36  Ok people, if you can&apos;t stomach out-the-door lines, scoot over to Ping Pong Dim Sum in Chinatown. Have $5 cocktails while you wa it at the bar, which still has some seats available. Table for two will be ready in 30 minutes.

 4:30  Apparently the story of the night will be what restaurant is NOT packed. Hearing of &quot;lines around the block at almost every food establishment in a 30-block vicin it y of the Mall.&quot; This will not do, Washington. People must eat. Please notify TBD of any dining establishments w it h room to spare.

 4:26  And another one--ChurchKey is reportedly packed.

 4:22  And so it starts--the first report of lines at restaurant s out the door. Might want to steer clear of Ray&apos;s Hell Burger.

 4:19  TBD Night is getting reports of clever and correctly spelled signs at the Stewart/Colbert rally. Photos are requested.

 4:10  TBD Night loves seasonal-themed adult beverages. Starting at 5, Sushi Rock is offering $5 pumpkin shooters all night. First 20 people that say they saw the deal on Tw it ter get one for $2.50.

 4:00  W it h Misters Stewart and Colbert in town, Halloween a few mere hours away, and the most gorgeous fall weather ever, this Saturday night in D.C. won&apos;t be anything less than bananas. Please check in w it h TBD Night, your local guide to all things nightworthy, as the evening progresses, and send us your tips about what you&apos;re seeing (and what bar bathrooms haven&apos;t run out of toilet paper yet). Tweet using the #tbdnight hashtag, or send me an email at jrogers@tbd.com . Yah for Saturday!

 [details] [close] received 1 year ago  published 1 year ago  lang: en   When was the last time you went to a restaurant and wanted to lick your plate clean? That’s how we felt the other night at Commun it y Table, the remarkable locavore restaurant that opened a few months ago in Washington, CT. Highly-principled, highly-styled but down-to-earth, Commun it y Table is one of those restaurant s that boldly prints it s mission statement on the first page of the menu—“to prepare the highest qual it y locally grown and procured ingredients and to serve our commun it y in a casual, vibrant atmosphere”—and then follows through magnificently but humbly. You know there’s something special happening inside when you see a middle-aged foursome wrapped in blankets on the porch on a chilly Saturday wa it ing for their table. You see, there is a no-reservations policy that is central to the restaurant ’s ident it y (and there’s a basket of fleece blankets by the front door if you have to wa it outside.) “We wanted it to be super democratic,” says chef Joel Viehland. “We didn’t want it to be a clubhouse for high-powered New Yorkers who would make their reservations weeks in advance. We didn’t want it to be fussy, and the only way to do that was to make it first come first served.” W it hout a bar for wa it ing and only a small vestibule that can hold perhaps a half-dozen people, Ct, as regulars call it (pronounced: “sea tea”), is bracing for it s first winter. “We’re going to get some heaters for the porch,” say Viehland, who is getting his larder ready for winter, too. “I’ve been drying, preserving, freezing, and curing,” he says. “This week, we’re building cold storage.” Viehland brings a worldly perspective to New England cuisine. He used to cook in New York and New Orleans and also worked a stint at Denmark’s Noma, which is devoted to local cuisine and has been called the world’s best restaurant . He chose northwestern Connecticut for his restaurant because the local agriculture could support his vision. “I was really distraught about getting a job at a normal restaurant ,” he says. “A great normal restaurant doesn’t care where in the world it s ingredients come from. A normal restaurant has three or four suppliers, I want to source as much locally as possible so I have 35 to 40 vendors I work w it h. It ’s a lot of work. It means our menu has to be flexible— it ’s cooking they way people have cooked for hundreds of years.” However, one constant is the semolina peasant bread from the Bantam Bread Co. that is served w it h incredibly delicious and creamy butter. “We whip it ourselves and add sea salt,” Viehland explains. The menu is an intriguing mixture of tweaked-out comfort food—such as beef and barley borscht ($7), rabb it w it h celery root puree and caramelized carrots ($23), spaghetti w it h merguez sausage, tomatoes, eggplant, preserved lemon, cured olives and goat’s milk pecorino ($21)—and more audacious dishes like pickled vegetables in a warm, bone-marrow vinaigrette ($9) and a skate wing served w it h quinona, walnuts, sunflower seeds, roasted beets, cauliflower, mustard greens and apple vinegar c it rus brown butter sauce ($24). When it came time to order dessert the other night, the molten chocolate cake was sold out but the fresh apple sorbet w it h wh it e-chocolate yogurt cream and apple chips ($6) was as dazzling as it was refreshing. The wine and beer list is modest because it ’s local, too, which is why the restaurant inv it es diners to bring their own bottles and charges a corkage fee of only $5. “We know some people are used to drinking only very good French wines and we want them to be able to enjoy their meals here,” says Viehland. The restaurant is so earnestly comm it ted to sustainabil it y that the front of the menu pays tribute to the waterless Kohler urinal in the men’s room. “ It s [sic] estimated that we will save thousands of gallons of water over a full year and yet provide a clean and odorless experience for our guests. Enjoy one or two of our local beers and give it a try!” The back of the menu lists more than a dozen farms and purveyors who contributed to the evening’s menu. Indeed, the men’s room, like the entire restaurant , has a contemporary Scandinavia-in-New England, Dwell magazine aesthetic—a synthesis of the sensibil it ies of local Washington Depot arch it ect Peter Talbot and owner Peggy Anderson who is a native of Sweden. W it h back-to-the-land values, an egal it arian vibe and seriously delicious food, Commun it y Table is the quintessential country restaurant for our times.

 Bar Agricole: How Many Artisans Does it Take to Build a Modern Tavern? 
 [ San Francisco , San Francisco, CA ] ( )
Chefs get all the glory these days, but anyone in the business can assure you that opening a restaurant is anything but a single-handed endeavor. Nowhere is that more true than at Bar Agricole, SoMa’s new LEED gold-certified, eco-perfect tavern.

Chefs get all the glory these days, but anyone in the business can assure you that opening a restaurant is anything but a single-handed endeavor. Nowhere is that more true than at Bar Agricole , SoMa’s new LEED gold-certified, eco-perfect tavern. Headed by Thaddeus Vogler, a preeminent and devoted spir it s master (or bartender—call him what you will), the modern but casual bar and restaurant opened in late summer after three years of planning. It ’s hardly all about Vogler though. He willingly shares the spotlight w it h a cadre of other talented participants, including visionary arch it ects, urban farmers, woodworkers, textile designers, and glassblowers—even a concrete craftsman. “I knew I wanted the food, beverage and design to be as amazing as possible, to sort of battle each other for center stage,” says Vogler.

 

 (from left) Thaddeus Vogler: owner, bartender and artisan in his own right. Walls lined w it h reclaimed oak. 

The building—formerly an abandoned industrial plumbing warehouse—was taken to new heights by arch it ects at Aidlin-Darling Design. They renovated it in 2009 w it h Matarozzi/Pelsinger Builders, who own the building and have set up their offices in the structure’s main wing . Before Bar Agricole opened, the building generated buzz, winning numerous design awards (a 2010 Award for Best Sustainable Structure from California Home+Design magazine, a 2010 Re-Skinning Award from Zerofootprint, and a 2010 Grand Mer it Award from Remodeling magazine). As the restaurant took shape, it became something of an incubator for a host of local artists and designers. “I needed people in the process w it h me to have shared sensibil it ies and be people that I really liked,” says Vogler.

 

 Skylights designed by glassblowers from Nikolas Weinstein Studios are made up of 1,362 glass tubes. 

Along the gr it ty stretch of 11th Street, the restaurant is separated from the road by 1,200 square feet of outdoor space, where a custom fountain by Sebastopol’s Flowform Artisans muffles the sound of traffic. Raised planting beds are cultivated by green-thumbed forager Mark Ellenbogen, who also directs the wine program. Inside, walls lined w it h reclaimed oak provide a rustic foil for sleek concrete floors, two rough-patterned concrete bars, and the wave-like forms of concrete booths, all by Mark Rogero of Concreteworks in Oakland. The wh it e oak tables and chairs were handcrafted by local furn it ure designer Sebastian Parker and got their rich reddish brown stain thanks to a past life as turn-of-the-century wine barrels. Most striking, though, are the skylights, the meticulous work of glassblowers from SF’s Nikolas Weinstein Studios. They drip w it h thousands of fused tubes of clear glass that appear to be frozen mid-breeze.

 

 (from left) Sebastian Parker worked for four months to cut and mill the restaurant ’s 60 chairs and tables by hand. Chef Brandon Jew’s sustainably minded food makes it s rounds to the tavern’s diners. 

The staff uniforms—aprons in pinstriped denim that call to mind a railroad conductor—have a pedigree too: Matt Dick, textile designer and owner of Tsurukichi Clothing Boutique in the Tenderloin created them. Images by SF photographer Thomas Winz hang above the bar, where Vogler and Eric Johnson mix cocktails made from mindfully selected craft spir it s.

 The Longaberger Basket Company Headquarters (Newark, OH) 
 When I get a lot of inquiries from clients and potential clients regarding a particular subject, we usually spend some time in research mode. This month, the theme has been: business remodeling. Oftentimes, most business owners portray hes it ancy when it comes to a remodel. Usually, it &apos;s because they think of a business remodel as the &quot;scarlet letter&quot; of doom that a business carries. Some startups even refuse to consider remodeling until it becomes too late.

Truth is, a lot of companies have found success in business remodeling--companies like Monster.com, ReMaxx, eWomen Network, and a few others.

One company that has caught my attention is the Longaberger Company . An entrepreneur who built a sophisticated business model based on a simple idea, Dave Longaberger is one to be studied.

Using some examples from The Longaberger Company, here are some reasons to remodel your startup business:

 When The Going Gets Tough!  
We often hear how small businesses are more flexible than bigger businesses when it comes to change. Well, startups are even more flexible than small businesses when it comes to change. Sometimes you as a startup have to remember that you cannot follow the exact rule book of small businesses. Once you&apos;re in the startup phase, you are in a test phase. You have to wired for change!

In his startup phase, Longaberger found his company faced w it h a lot of debt and a l it tle revenue. His startup costs and the economy had drained him. So he decided to remodel his business via his sales methods. He wanted to tell his company story and he found out that retail employees were not delivering the message. So his idea for direct sales representatives was born. And oh did it make a difference w it hin his business! 

 2 Ways to Revamp Your Startup Sales Methods: 


 Change your Distribution . This is a part of the business planning process that you must revis it once you start your revamp. Distribution is the medium w it h which your products and services are being distributed to your potential clients. For example, an online business owner could decide to include an offline sales distribution method strategy. To phrase it simpler, a restaurant could decide to include a catering aspect to it s business, because it wants to reach small business clients. An offline startup business could decide to add an online seminar platform that is designed after it s offline seminars--in order to reach a different demographic. Change Your Sales Process . Ask yourself this: when a potential client contacts you, what happens next? This is the process that you want to revis it . Are you getting a lot of prospects that are not turning into sales? For instance, if you have a 3-Step Process and you have a ridiculously high amount of clients going to the 3rd Step w it hout purchasing, you may want to revamp your step. One thing that helped me in my process a year ago was asking these simple questions, what do you think so far?   OR  what&apos;s stopping you from signing up right now? You&apos;ll never get a straight answer to these questions but you will defin it ely get clues.   
 When Your Customers Give You Non-Verbal Cues 
 You can sense that it &apos;s time for a makeover when your customers give you cues. Dave Longaberger started his basket making business in it ially to test out the idea. At the time, his father was weaving baskets as a side job and Dave asked whether he could make a few baskets for retail sales. When Dave saw that people were willing to pay $10 per basket (instead of $1.50 that his father was charging) he knew that he was onto something.  
 2 Ways to Revamp Your Pricing Model 
 
 Review package options . Package pricing is a hidden gem that a lot of startups should take advantage of. It allows you to maintain some control of your time, services and values. It also gives you a great way to analyze who&apos;s buying and for what reasons. For instance, if someone keeps choosing a package of a higher value that includes some great essentials, you know then that they buy based on qual it y.  Add different pricing options . Nobody wants to be the business who starts w it h a higher price model and ends up w it h products on sale every week. So one good way to change your prices (particularly if you&apos;re trying to decrease the value) is by adding an introductory pricing option. Think of how you can introduce someone to your services in a more affordable and less time consuming way. Add a price tag to that and watch what happens. I mention creating some form of paid-for education in my December 2009 post, Be Creative; 3 Quick Tips To Help You Remodel Your Small Business in 2010.  
 When You Want To Make A Difference W it h Your Startup 
 Business altruism intrigues me, and businesses whose sole purpose rely on making a difference, inspire me. In fact, this infatuation led me to wr it e my first book, A Different Business; 7 Easy Steps To Starting&amp;Planning A Business Around Your Purpose.   Take Dave Longaberger for example. He decided to create a difference w it hin his commun it y--through business. He began to rev it alize the small c it y w it hin Ohio called Dresden. After adding a Longaberger commun it y center, swimming center, senior c it izen&apos;s center, a new wing to the high school, a farm, a museum, basket landscaping, etc., the small town attracted tons of tourists per year.  
 2 Ways to Include An Altruistic Model W it hin Your Startup Remodel 
 
 Support A Non-prof it or Inst it ution whose cause you support dearly . For example, I host an educational one-day inst it ute every year. Every year, I also travel to Washington D.C. for a fundraiser whose purpose is to raise scholarship funds for students in Liberia. Part of the proceeds from my educational inst it ute, goes towards providing 2 entrepreneurial scholarships for students in Liberia. I suggest you find a non-prof it whose cause may be indirectly related to your business&apos; cause, and one whose employees or programs are directly associated w it h the individuals deemed beneficiaries.  Create An Underlying Mission For Your Prof it -Producing Business . Take Hello Rewind for example. The company is a design company that produces laptop sleeves. However, their underlying cause is to help sex-trafficking victims prepare for jobs. As a result, they partner w it h companies who can send them victims to employ. The best way to go about this is to partner w it h a company or non-prof it whose mission is your underlying mission. A simple google search could lead you in the right direction.  
 
 What steps will you be taking to remodel your startup business for 2010-2011?

 I received another of those fwd fwd emails this morning, most of which I&apos;m copying here.  

 Once I got past the bizarre idea of Dick Cheney, Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey et al as &quot;real people&quot; doing &quot;real work&quot;, I noticed the piece is attributed to Bruce Walker of &quot;American Thinker&quot; infamy, a huge part of the right wing echo chamber.  But I digress.... 

   The Lawyers&apos; Party ~ By Bruce Walker *

The Democratic Party has become the Lawyers Party .
Barack Obama is a lawyer.  Michelle Obama is a lawyer.
Hillary Clinton is a lawyer. Bill Clinton is a lawyer.
John Edwards is a lawyer. Elizabeth Edwards is a lawyer.
Every Democrat nominee since 1984 went to law school
(although Gore did not graduate).
Every Democrat vice presidential nominee since 1976, except
for Lloyd Bentsen, went to law school.
Look at leaders of the Democrat Party in Congress:
Harry Reid is a lawyer. Nancy Pelosi is a lawyer.

The Republican Party is different.
President Bush is a businessman.
Vice President Cheney is a businessman.
The leaders of the Republican Revolution: Newt Gingrich was
a history professor.
Tom Delay was an exterminator. Dick Armey was an economist.
House Minor it y Leader Boehner was a plastic manufacturer.
The former Senate Major it y Leader Bill First is a heart
surgeon. Who was the last Republican president who was a
lawyer? Gerald Ford, who left office 31 years ago and who
barely won the Republican nomination as a s it ting president,
running against Ronald Reagan in 1976.

The Republican Party is made up of real people doing real
work, who are often the targets of lawyers.
The Democrat Party is made up of lawyers.

Democrats mock and scorn men who create wealth, like Bush
and Cheney, or who heal the sick, like First, or who immerse
themselves in history, like Gingrich.

The Lawyers Party sees these sorts of people, who provide
goods and services that people want, as the enemies of
America .

And, so we have seen the procession of official enemies, in
the eyes of the Lawyers Party, grow.

Against whom do Hillary and Obama rail? Pharmaceutical
companies, oil companies, hosp it als, manufacturers, fast
food restaurant chains, large retail businesses, bankers,
and anyone producing anything of value in our nation.

This is the natural consequence of vie wing everything
through the eyes of lawyers. Lawyers solve problems by
successfully representing their clients, in this case the
American people. Lawyers seek to have new laws passed, they
seek to win lawsu it s, they press appellate courts to
overturn precedent, and lawyers always parse language to
favor their side.

Confined to the narrow practice of law, that is fine. But it 
is an awful way to govern a great nation. 

When pol it icians as lawyers begin to view some Americans as
clients and other Americans as opposing parties, then the
role of the legal system in our life becomes all-consuming.

Some Americans become adverse parties of our very
government. We are not all l it igants in some vast social
class-action su it .

We are c it izens of a republic that promises us a great deal
of freedom from laws, from courts, and from lawyers.

Today, we are drowning in laws; we are contorted by judicial
decisions; we are driven to distraction by omnipresent
lawyers in all parts of our once private lives.

America has a place for laws and lawyers, but that place is
modest and reasonable, not vast and unchecked.

When the most important decision for our next president is
whom he will appoint to the Supreme Court, the role of
lawyers and the law in America is too big.

When House Democrats sue America in order to hamstring our
efforts to learn what our enemies are planning to do to us,
then the role of l it igation in America has become crushing.

We cannot expect the Lawyers Party to provide real change,
real reform or real hope in America Most Americans know that
a republic in which every major government action must

be blessed by nine unelected judges is not what Washington
intended in 1789. Most Americans grasp that we cannot fight
a war when ACLU lawsu it s snap at the heels of our defenders.

Most Americans intu it that more lawyers and judges will not
restore declining moral values or spark the spir it of
enterprise in our economy.

Perhaps Americans will understand that change cannot be
brought to our nation by those lawyers who already largely
dictate American society and business.

Perhaps Americans will see that hope does not come from the
mouths of lawyers but from personal dreams nourished by hard
work.

Perhaps Americans will embrace the truth that more lawyers
w it h more power will only make our problems worse .
 

 My reply to this was relatively simple, and hopefully pointed out to the sender what his real choices are: 

 This one would be fun to pick apart, line by line, but I&apos;ll lim it myself to two salient points, sho wing that corporate interests, not the good of middle class Americans, are at the heart of this campaign.   

 One is that the &quot;creating wealth&quot; meme is being used to cause average Americans to vote against their own self interests. The concentration of wealth has shifted dramatically in the last 10 years, w it h more and more going to the super rich at the expense of the middle class. The last time the gap was this wide was in 1928.....Think about that.  Yet the Republicans in Congress are fuming over allo wing the tax cuts for the wealthy to expire. They rant and rave about &quot;tax increases, convincing many people this is about them, the middle class. So they follow blindly, voting against their own interests, putting or keeping in office those who will continue to widen that gap. 

 Second, the importance of Supreme Court Justices cannot be overstated. The current court, of which 5 are conservative appointed, is the very one that gave &quot;personhood&quot; to corporations w it h a 5-4 vote..giving the mammoth companies the same rights as you and I. This laid the groundwork for another 5-4 vote giving corporations unlim it ed spending power in elections.....this means corporations can spend freely on pol it ical ads leading up to elections.   

 These two ruling alone are victories for, and give ever more power to, big oil, Wall Street banks, pharma, health insurance companies and other powerful interests.  
 This week, the GOP blocked a bill that would stop tax incentives from being given to companies who outsource jobs to foreign countries. Yet, the sheeple allow themselves to whipped into a frenzy by red herring emotional non-issues, convincing themselves that these people are really on their side, and once again, they vote against their own self interests, while declaring themselves &quot;Patriots&quot; for doing so

 TBD Night is now also for Thursdays and Fridays during happy hour! Send updates from where you&apos;re drinking using the #TBDNight hash tag, to eizadi@tbd.com, or by using the &quot; Subm it Tip &quot; button on the TBD mobile app .

 7:00 p.m: I&apos;m officially checking-out on the blog here, but keep tweeting your to your heart&apos;s content using the #TBDnight hashtag. Goodnight, folks!

 6:55 p.m:  OK, my live-blogging is about to end, but TBD’s Erik Wemple provides details on where to drink and eat cheaply until well past 7 p.m.

Tombs in Georgetown has a night beer special from 10 p.m. until midnight and “you get what&apos;s known as the ‘Tombs p it cher’ for $11. That&apos;s 60 ounces of the pub&apos;s own amber-colored brew. Get there at 9:59 pm,” wr it es Erik.

Then there’s The Bottom Line, which has specials until closing at 1:30 a.m. Erik declares that “this watering hole at 17th and I NW has some pretty good deals,” and I trust the man, so there it must be true. Employees tell him “Thursday’s feature $2.50 Bud and Bud Light bottles plus Longhammer IPA drafts for $3.50. Comestible offerings are $4.50 baskets of tater tots or ‘ wing zingers.’”

Whether “zingers” are better than “poppers” was something Erik did not disclose.

 6:50 p.m: Hurry up to get to Jaleo on U Street before happy hour finishes at 7 p.m. Pay $4 for drafts, wine, and sangria. The bar does seem a b it crowded, however, so good luck.

TBD&apos;s Sarah Larimer inquired about happy hour specials near Terminal C at Reagan National Airport. She &quot;almost got laughed at&quot; and took her beer to-go.

 6:45 p.m: More on the football front: TBD&apos;s Daniel Victor sends me a report ahead of kick-off:

&quot; It &apos;s half-business, half-Mountaineer for the happy hour crowd at Ragtime in Courthouse. West Virginia plays at 7:30 and the some jerseys are starting to mix w it h the su it s. They&apos;re offering $2.50 Miller L it e, $3 Flying Dog Oktoberfest, $3 well drinks and a Hot Tamale-infused vodka drink for $6.50. Yum.&quot;

 6:33 p.m: TBD&apos;s Rebecca Cooper breaks into the #TBDNight game by sending this photo of one of Sushi Rock&apos;s half-priced specialty cocktails. This one, the &quot;wh it e rabb it ,&quot; has &quot;gin, lime, cucumber and champagne.&quot; Rebecca also wr it es that she didn&apos;t partake of the cocktail, as she&apos;s headed to an Arlington County Board meeting that begins at 7 p.m. The girl&apos;s got her prior it ies in check!
 (Photo: Rebecca Cooper) 
Also, get over to DAR Const it ution Hall for the 7 p.m. Belle&amp;Sebastian show. Tickets are still available, so tweets @930Club .

 6:23 p.m: I now have some information regarding football and beer, in case you&apos;re into that sort of thing. TBD&apos;s Paul Volpe provides details on where to watch the West Virginia Univers it y vs. Univers it y of South Florida game.

McFadden’s (which The List reported is the place for West Virginia alums to watch their beloved team) has their “standard football special” until the end of the game, wr it es Paul. They include “$3 Bud Lights, $10 p it chers, and a $20 ‘super tube’ (which apparently is the equivalent of five p it chers, and just s it s on the table), and $5 wing baskets.”

Go to Crystal C it y Sports Pub to get half-priced appetizers until 7 p.m. and also watch the Kansas vs. Kanas State game. The Ugly Mug on Cap it ol Hill has $6 margar it as, $15 buckets of Sol, “which the guy who answered the phone all-but-adm it ted was a poor-man’s Corona,” wr it es Paul.

 6:13 p.m: Washington C it y Paper&apos;s Mike Madden ponders &quot;If I&apos;m at a bar, and looking at Tw it ter, am I automatically part of #TBDNight , even if I work at @wcp ?&quot; This isn&apos;t a rhetorical or &quot;if a tree falls in a forest, and no one is around to hear it , does it make a sound?&quot; kind of a question. The answer is yes Mike, yes.

Back to the happy hours! TBD&apos;s Sommer Mathis reports that H Street Country Club &quot;is basically empty,&amp;tonight&apos;s specials are $5 margar it as, $3 Buds&amp;Dos Equis&quot; but then later tweets &quot; it &apos;s actually too quiet in here. No music, even. Somebody put some $ in the jukebox! Those specials go until 8pm, though.&quot; So head there for quiet drinks.

 6:07 p.m:  We have some conflicting reports as to who in fact has the best happy hour in D.C. TBD’s Sarah Godfrey tells me that Mad Hatter, “which calls it self ‘the best happy hour in D.C.’ has $2.75 Bud/BudLight Drafts, $2.75 Rail Liquors, and $4.50 House Wine” from 4 to 8 p.m., plus “Buy One Get One” appetizers.

Sarah continues, “Chef Geoff&apos;s Downtown, also a self-proclaimed ‘best happy hour in D.C.’ has 7.95 ‘super mugs’ (33.8 ounces!) 2.95 long necks, 5.95 select wine” plus lots of cheap food. And “then, the ever-modest McFadden&apos;s has $20 ABSOLUT COCKTAIL P IT CHERS for happy hour, yet only calls it self ‘one of’ the best happy hours in D.C. Are you kidding me? $20 p it chers of vodka drinks? I&apos;m crowning this THE BEST happy hour in D.C.”

We have a winner? 
 

 6:01 p.m: TBD&apos;s ace photographer Jay Westcott has found a deal! Well, maybe. Throw down $22 for this beer tower at Pour House near Eastern Market. And if you consider yourself a l it tle more on the &quot;pour&quot; side (pun, intended!), you can pay $3 for Yuenglings. Goes until 7 p.m.
 (Photo: Jay Westcott) 
 5:55 p.m: Want to drink for a worthy cause? TBD&apos;s Ryan Kearney alerts me to the Raise the Roof happy hour fundraiser benef it ing Courtney’s House. It ’s presented by the Cap it al C it y Ball at Mie N Yu in Georgetown and ends at 9 p.m. Give a $15 donation at the door and get drink and fund specials. Courtney’s House works to ending domestic sex trafficking.

Also, head to Public Par in Dupont for Lawyers Have Heart’s fall kick-off event. Pay $20 for a one-hour open bar, complimentary food, and a 3-hour happy hour extension.

 5:45 p.m: Yes, the weather is depressing, but Phase 1 in D.C. purports to have the cure: karaoke! They have $2 kami shots and PBR to making singing a l it tle easier for all.

And 14K Restaurant and Lounge at 14th&amp;K streets, N.W., has &quot;rush hour happy hour&quot; until 7 p.m. Trying to recast a miserable rush hour, I suppose? Anyway, pay $4 for premium drafts, premium well drinks, and for glasses of the house wine.

 5:35 p.m: Although I haven&apos;t heard many reports of crowded bars yet, it &apos;s good to plan ahead in case the late post-work crowd gets thick. TBD&apos;s Sommer Mathis tweets that &quot;Cuba Libre isn&apos;t doing happy hour specials, but seats at the bar are already scarce.&quot; Don&apos;t believe her? See for yourself:

 5:25 p.m: Why does TBD&apos;s Ally Schwe it zer know all? She wr it es, &quot;Asylum is still doing their daily happy hour w it h $1.50 tacos. $1 off rail liquor and drafts, but the dirty bike messengers are FREE.&quot; (And by &quot;know all,&quot; I mean where to find dirty bike messengers.)

Over in Bethesda, an employee at Ri Ra Irish Pub says there&apos;s &quot;plenty of space&quot; in the bar. Pay $3.50 for draft beers, $4 for Guinness, and $2.50 for domestic beers.

 5:15 p.m: @TBDCommute asks how could one forget about Bacon Week at Restaurant 3 in Clarendon. In the interest of full disclosure, I kind of did. BUT now that I remember, I present the details: bacon happy hour until 7 p.m. w it h bacon-infused treats and $3 craft beers. You may want to eat plenty of fru it later to make up for it .

Want something more, um, well rounded? Tonight is burger night at Cap it al C it y Diner and $9 gets you a burger, fries, and a beer. Ends at 10 p.m.

 5:05 p.m: Not in D.C? No problem. Copper Canyon Grill in Downtown Silver Spring has plenty of space at the bar. Their happy runs until 7 p.m. and specials include $4 house wines, $4 margar it as, and $5 mixed drinks. Oh, and they also have sliders! Pay $2 for two sliders and fries. Not bad, not bad at all.

And we have another dispatch from TBD’s Ally Schwe it zer, who informs us that Piola on Wilson Boulevard in Arlington has a happy hour until 8 p.m. in the bar, and 7 p.m. in the dining room. You may want to get there soon though as they have free h’ors d’oeuvres at the bar only.

 4:55 p.m: I know you’re dying to know where you can find some jalapeno poppers in Dupont Circle, because I know I am. Thank goodness TBD’s Erik Wemple sent us this update:
 
Lucky Bar: Here&apos;s the thing you need to know about Lucky Bar on a Thursday night: The specials never end; they&apos;re in effect until this elegant hole-in-a-wall in the bustle of Connecticut Avenue turns out the lights. That&apos;s around 1:30 am, Friday. Anyhow, three bucks is what you need to know about LB. You got three-buck Bud in bottles, three-buck Bud Light in draft or bottle, three-buck Bud Select as well. Also, three-buck rail or &quot;well&quot; drinks. Again, all night long. As for food, get ready for some calories. LB provides something that goes by the name of &quot;Deep-Fried Fun,&quot; which is a basket of mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders, onion rings and, get this, &apos;jalapeno poppers.&apos;
 
 4:45 p.m: TBD’s Jenny Rogers tells us that the weather may or may not have an effect on today’s happy hour crowd. Rogers called the Iron Horse in Chinatown and “a breathless employee informed me that all beers are $2 off and rails are $5 until 8. When asked to speculate on whether the weather would have an effect on tonight’s happy hour crowd, she said: ‘I have no idea. It ’s really hard to say.’”

Also, BlackFinn near Farragut Square has $3 Millers, $4 Amstels and $5 wines, and Sushi Rock in Arlington tweets they have half-priced specialty cocktails until 2 a.m.  

 4:30 p.m: TBD Night is back at it , live-blogging all the happy hour-goodness in the D.C.-area until 7 p.m. Today&apos;s rainy weather may have put a damper on happy hour for some, but we trust there are plenty of folks out there who would rather wa it out the traffic and h it the bar instead of the Beltway.

First up is the very uncrowded Logan Tavern at (14th&amp;P streets, N.W.), where happy hour began at 3 p.m. They have half-priced appetizers and $3.95 glasses of wine and $5.95 draft beers.

TBD&apos;s Ally Schwe it zer has sent along some breaking happy hour news: the doggie happy hour at Hotel Monaco is no more! At least not tonight, thanks to all the rain. More from Ally: &quot;The furn it ure is all wet and &apos; it takes a while to dry out,&apos; says a staffer at the Jackson 20 restaurant . They say it ’ll happen next week. Weather perm it ting.&quot; And no, you can&apos;t bring booze to the dog park.

Also, Rock and Roll Hotel tweets: &quot;ZOMBIE BAR CRAWL TONIGHT! DRINKS SPECIALS FOR THE LIVING DEAD&gt;&gt;$3 RAILS&gt;&gt;$4 Rogue Dead Guys! ONLY IF YOU DRESS UP!&quot; Oh my. It is a b it early for zombies, isn&apos;t it ?

 Dan Riehl of Riehl World View has a b it of a bombshell to drop on the arrogant, self-reverential &quot;Senator of the people,&quot; Alaska&apos;s Lisa Murkowski -- she of the second hand Senate seat bequeathed to her by her father who held that seat himself. Riehl says that it is a commonly known, not-so-secret secret in Alaska that Lisa Murkowski is and/or was a major drug addict even as she served as Alaska&apos;s Republican Senator.

Murkowski recently lost her primary, as we all know, and suddenly she is now Mz independent because obviously having her in the Senate is far, far more important than anything as silly as the will of the voters! Perhaps her drug use explains her completely incomprehensible decision to continue running desp it e being turned out by her own voters?

So what did Riehl find?
 &quot; It was back during the primary that I first heard reports that Alaska&apos;s independent candidate for Senate, Lisa Murkowski, may have routinely ignored the state&apos;s drug laws by regularly abusing cocaine. Given a lack of solid sources and Lisa Murkowski&apos;s loss to Joe Miller, I moved on, though some reports suggested the abuse may have been hab it ual, even while her influential pol it ician father, Frank Murkowski, pos it ioned himself as something of a hardliner on drug enforcement.&quot;
 After calling Murkowski&apos;s office and getting no reply, Riehl sent five questions via email that he wanted answered regarding this rumored drug use.
 1) Has Senator Murkowski ever used cocaine recreationally prior to her holding elective office at the state, or federal level? Has she ever shared same in the past, w it hout cost, w it h friends and or associates, including at a then downtown Anchorage restaurant owned by her husband?

2) It &apos;s also been alleged that this was something of an open secret w it hin a relatively small circle of friends and associates in Alaska. If true, is that a correct characterization?

3) Has the Senator ever been confronted w it h said allegations? If so, how did she respond?

4) Has her husband, Verne Martell, ever been involved w it h a police matter in California? Did Lisa&apos;s father Frank ever use his influence to minimize said matter, if not in essence, make it go away? Has she ever been approached by CA or AK media in this regard?

5) Finally, as it will likely be briefly re-vis it ed in a pending it em, the Senator recently spoke well of PMBR, see link below, desp it e it s having been h it w it h an 11.9 million dollar judgment for copyright violation. Would the campaign care to comment as to how her experience w it h PMBR relates to the copyright issue? Any comment as to any concerns that the acknowledged assistance from PMBR could be construed as her having gained insight to copyrighted questions for which (bar exam) testing candidates should not have had access?
 Still no reply.

Riehl looked up one of Murkowski&apos;s former opponents and he said he got many reports of Murkowski&apos;s drug use when he ran against her in 1998. &quot;I received many calls back then alleging that Ms. Murkowski used cocaine in substantial amounts for a prolonged period of time,&quot; said Richard J. Helms.

Riehl has a lot of other anecdotal evidence concerning Murkowski&apos;s drug use at his blog post but it all raises an interesting question. Why has Murkowski not addressed this persistent question, one that has been around in Alaska since at least 1998? One would think that Murkowski would have at least denied the allegations and moved on if they are, indeed, deniable. But Riehl could find no statement from Murkowski shooting down the rumors.

These are pretty strong charges, to be sure. Why no reply?

Now, many of you reading this may dismiss this as all just rumormongering, unsubstantiated blather, nothing to get exercised about. Of course there&apos;s that whole media propens it y to think the &quot;seriousness of the charge&quot; is enough to talk about this accusation until the cows come home (for you c it y folks that means &quot;for a long time&quot;).

Yet, even as the media would normally give this sort of rumor a full court press, the same media has wholly ignored this long-time rumor. One has to wonder why?

On the other hand, let us contrast the media blo wing off this Murkowski rumor to it s drummed up reports about another Alaska pol it ician: Sarah Palin. Remember the idiotically absurd rumors that Sarah&apos;s baby son Trig was actually her own daughter&apos;s baby, one born out of wedlock?

This rumor was really one of the most idiotic rumors of the age, one easily disproven, yet the Old Media played this rumor to the hilt and for months used it as a staple of cr it icism of Palin during the 2008 presidential elections.

So, in light of the halfw it Trig truther rumor that the Old Media went wild to report I have to ask once again: why is the Old Media ignoring this much more substantive Murkowski drug use rumor?

In any case, it &apos;s all a pretty good reason to vote for Joe Miller for Senate in Alaska!
