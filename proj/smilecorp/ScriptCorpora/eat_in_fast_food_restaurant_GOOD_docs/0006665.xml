Business Highlights Centralia Deli, Steak&amp;BBQ is Lewis Counties newest premier dining experience Locally owned and operated by the same people who have been providing great food and service for over 30 years at the Chehalis Deli, we decided to add a larger, family friendly location to continue the tradition of excellent food, down home hospitality, and great service at affordable pricing!

As strong community supporters we have built everything on our menu around our local traditions, friendly outgoing citizens, and laid-back country living.

Bring the family and come sample the Tiger, Bearcat, Wildcat, or Bobcat Sandwiches We bake our own bread fresh each day! Salads and Soups are varied and healthy, or try one of our famous BBQ entrees Desserts are down home famous and we do some magical things with ice cream.

Conveniently located just off I-5 on Harrison Ave in Centralia we are open 7 days a week You can dine in and experience our new, locally built, state of the art restaurant with our eclectic atmosphere We have tables and booths or you can even sit in one of our saddles at the counter! We also offer delivery, take-out, and the famous catering you have come to expect as the best from Chehalis deli.

We are not a fast food restaurant; we serve great food as fast as we can!
We look forward to hosting you, your family or your next event.
Sincerely, Tim Weible and Debbie Slemp Languages Spoken Spanish English Tagline We&apos;re not fast food; just great food fast.
