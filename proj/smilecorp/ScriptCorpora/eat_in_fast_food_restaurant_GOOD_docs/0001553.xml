Hotdogs, L.A. Style
 
Pinks–it’s not just hotdogs, it’s an institution. It’s been featured in movies, stars’and politicians’limos regularly stop by to pick up food, and there’s almost always a huge line.

So, what’s the attraction? Pinks is the ultimate in hotdogs. Bite into a Pinks dog, and you’ll note the perfect hotdog flavor, the nice crunch of the skin, and the tender insides. If you’re a true hotdog afficionado, it’s the best. It’s hotdog perfection.

Pinks also offers endless varieties of hotdog dishes for your dining pleasure. Pinks offers a wide variety of dogs (regular, footlong, polish hot or mild, jalapeño, turkey, tofu, etc), prepared in a wide range of creative configurations.

My favorite, for example, is the Double- Poli-Bacon Burrito Dog. It features a pair of hot or mild polish dogs, sliced open, layered on top of melted cheese, wrapped in bacon, covered in chili and wrapped in a burrito. Pure heaven.

 BTW …even better the next day, chilled, the chili solidifies (congeals?) and you can slice it into round pieces….Yum!

Pinks has something for everyone. There are chicken dishes, hamburgers, and even vegetarian dishes available.

Infamous hot dog stand in LA–you’ll even see it featured in movies! If you’re in the area, its worth a visit. Get a chili dog, and check out the photos of famous patrons.

The most unreliably hyped and overrated restaurant in L.A...
 
I am a hot dog lover and I can’t tell you how many people have over the years told me to eat at Pink’s. I finally did, and the disappointment on my face was visible from bite number 1. I believe that no one that told me to go to Pink’s ever had the hotdog at Costco.

Let’s start now with the many problems at Pink’s and to make it easy to read—I will sequentially number them: 1) Take out a dime from your pocket. Your Pink’s hotdog will not be thicker than the diameter of your dime. It will disappear between the buns. You will wonder if there is a hotdog in your bun. 2) No worries if you burnt your taste buds the day before—the Pink’s hotdog is tasteless. It is the most tasteless hotdog I have ever had in over 35 years of eating hotdogs all over the world, on streets, fairs, and deli’s. 3) Be prepared for a line at all times. The staff monitors the line and will slow down service, and sometimes walk away to make sure that there is always at least two lines in front of the shack so that it looks busy and desirable to everyone passing by or waiting. 4) There are magicians working at Pink’s who have made real chili disappear and reappear as watered down, tasteless slop on your hotdog. I ordered Chili! on the dog and I have no idea what that brown watery stuff was. 5) The Pink’s $5.00 commandment: There shall be no hotdog on the menu that shall sell for less than $5.00. The $5.00 hotdog without anything on it at the ballpark is way, way better my friends. 6) There is nothing fun, exciting or nostalgic about eating at this dump.

So, the next time someone tells YOU to go to Pink’s, claiming that it is such a great hotdog, and they have recently been there—just do one thing: DO NOT trust anything that person ever tells you about food again!

Hi PleasurePalate,

Here in the LA area, one of the best hotdogs ever is remarkably, the COSTCO food court hotdog. Wherever I have lived, or traveled, if I pass a COSTCO , I stop for the hotdog. It tastes the same all over. It has only been $1.50 for past many years, is 100% beef, and from the highest quality hotdog manufacturer in the USA : Hebrew National. It is perfectly spiced, very large and if you ask, they will give you the Sauerkraut to put on it. I really don’t know how they can bring this hotdog in at $1.50. The same brand hotdog is over $3.00 and closer to $4.00 at most deli’s. If the COSTCO food court is outside (some store food courts are outside, some are not), you do not have to be a member to eat there. They never ask for your card. The other hotdog, which is great, is the Dodger Kosher 100% hotdog. If you are in the mood for a $6.00 hotdog at the ball game—you can’t go wrong.

Order a chili cheese dog. The long lines are always there for a reason. This place is a constant. Cheap food, good quality, and a dash of heartburn. :)

Way too expensive, over-hyped, saturated in grease, and simply too long a line for a seriously average food experience.

I make better hot-dogs.

An LA staple but they’re just that, hot dogs. Though, once you add different toppings or get it a certain way, I can understand why they have such a loyal following. *Note: there is almost always a line.

Classic Hot Dogs. I come here when ever I get a chance. I really enjoy all their hot dogs. I hate how there&apos;s rarely ever parking around there so you need to do a lot of walking. And there is usually a big line.

 Note: There is always a line out the door but it is worth the wait! Lots of good food for not so much money and they are open late for the night owls. The service is always courteous and fast. I just discovered this place but I can&apos;t get enough of it.

 Dishes: onion rings spicy polish dog (with chili, onions and mustard)
