 View Kop Profile Annie Roader Join Date Mar 2009 Posts 480 Asda car park fine query – 15-7-10, 09:04 My mrs parked in an Asda car park for a few hours because it&apos;s handy for work (though she does shop in there as well)

She was not in a disabled bay (can&apos;t stand people that wrongly use those) or in a parent/child spec, but she&apos;s got a fine through the post because the car was there over the permitted &apos;free&apos; time.

The letter is actually in my name because I&apos;m the registred keeper, but I work nights and hardly ever drive during the day, so it wasn&apos;t even me in the Asda car park in the first place.

This was the Adsa car park in Huyton, it&apos;s a huge car park and she was parked out of the way were it was virtually empty.

I&apos;ve heard various stories about such parking fines and in the main people seem to think it&apos;s safe to just ignore them, as the company that issue them have no legal clout to follow up non payment....any thoughts.

cheers.
