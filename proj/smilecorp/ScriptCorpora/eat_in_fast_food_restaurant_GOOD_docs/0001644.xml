Came here for my birthday because I have always wanted to try this place and figured something local would be good. This place is located in the same plaza as the El Pollo Loco off of Huntington Dr. There is plenty of parking in the parking lot.
The restaurant inside is pretty small with only 10 or so tables. The place was pretty empty when we arrived a little after 6 pm (but as the time progressed, a few more tables filled up). We were seated right away and since the sun was shining in our eyes, the owner was nice enough to lower the blinds.
I don&apos;t remember all the names of the dishes we ordered, but I do remember we ordered the Nasi kuning (some kind of a lemon grass similar tasting beef with a potato cake, tumeric rice and a piece of fried chicken), some kind of a steamed vegetable that is covered in a peanut sauce, Indonesian chicken fried rice, some kind of fish dish and a combo meal that came with fried tofu, potato cakes, steamed and fried chicken.
There wasn&apos;t a real long wait for our food to be brought out and the young man who was helping us (I am assuming he is the son&apos;s owner) was nice and great at answering our questions about the menu and different types of foods. Wish he would have been a little more attentive, but that doesn&apos;t stop me from coming back because the service he gave wasn&apos;t bad.
Overall, thought the food was really good. Prices are very affordable (by the way, they take cash only) and no need to wait to sit down and eat. Will definitely come back here again and try other dishes.

This is definitely in my Monrovia lunch rotation.  This is a no frills mom and pops shop.  Not a ton of indonesian places out there, so I can&apos;t really say that I&apos;ve tried them all and this is the best.

Four stars because the food is good, prices are cheap, and the owner/manager is a nice guy.  Can&apos;t exactly say that I would drive out here from another part of town, but I would come if I was within a 5 minute radius and craving some indonesian.

My fav dish there is the Soup Buhut-- basically it&apos;s an oxtail soup with veggies served with some white race.  You really can&apos;t go wrong with oxtail for me, the broth is tasty, and I like how some of the potatoes are deep fried first so it retains a bit of it&apos;s crunchy texture.

Call ahead if you know what you want so you can be in and out quickly, and also remember he does not accept credit card!  make sure you bring that cash

I was in the mood for some Indonesian food, specifically mi goreng.  After searching for some places on Yelp, I decided to try this place out for dinner before playing some badminton.  Definitely a mom and pop, hole-in-the-wall type of place.  Seating was pretty limited at the time of our visit since they had a couple groups of reserved seating and people gathered there probably for some special occasion.

I ordered a Bakmi Goreng Sapi dish for $6.95 which is basically their traditional fried noodles with beef and vegetables. The portion size was pretty generous and definitely looked like a good meal for the price, however, it wasn&apos;t as good as it appeared.  I actually had to spit out a couple pieces of beef which by the way, I hate doing because it was too chewy and rubbery.  To top it off, it felt like my portion of the meal was like it came from the bottom of the pan so to speak.  Some parts of the noodles kinda tasted a bit burnt.  I did finish the dish since it was only my 2nd meal of the day and was starved.  Despite all that, It was flavorful or maybe I was just hungry.  I didn&apos;t exactly taste like restaurant quality personally but more like a &quot;hodge-podge&quot; dish that a grandma would make for their grand kids.

Oh one last update.  For dessert, I had an avocado smoothie.  This had to be probably THE WORST I&apos;ve ever tasted.  I just had a couple of sips and that was just trying to figure out what I was exactly eating.  I was done with it.  It definitely was not &quot;smooth&quot; and had chunks of avocado in it... bad tasting bits of it too.  I grew up with an avocado tree in my backyard and I used to be so sick of all the avocados because my mom would use it so much.  Avocado shakes, ice cream, etc.. you name it.  My mom could have made a better avocado smoothie with her eyes closed.

It seems other Yelpers had a better experience than I did so that&apos;s a good sign.  Maybe I just caught them on a bad night or their main cook/chef was not there that day because my experience was just not as good as it needs to be.  This place isn&apos;t exactly local to me so I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be back and probably search for some other Indonesian place.  Ironically, this place is right next door to Asian Garden (a mongolian bbq buffet).  That would be my next stop if I was ever in the area again and I had a choice between the two.  I&apos;ll upload some pictures so check &apos;em out.

I love Bali. But, I am hardly have chance to go there lately. This restaurant reminds me the smell and flavors there. I especially like their sweet soy bean sauce putting in the fried rice or noodle. Chili sauce is straight forward and fresh. You cannot miss their chicken satay. Juicy and flavored.

I was not going their in high traffic hour. I didn&apos;t wait for long and the service is good. But, if you are going their in dining hours, be patient and good luck.

terima kasih!

When I crave Indonesian food, I always head to the Duarte Inn where, on Saturdays, they have more than a handful of Indonesian Food stands that sell wonderful Indonesian BBQs, noodles, and snacks. Unfortunately, the Food Stands are open during the Spring and Summer months. It was a bummer to find the parking lot was vacant when I visited a few days ago. Oh well. The next best alternative, however, is to visit Chicky BBQ&amp;Grill; an actual restaurant in the same compound of the Duarte Inn.

Chicky BBQ is a tiny establishment. Their food is not as great as the Indonesian Food stands that I love, but it&apos;s decent to satisfy a craving for Indonesian food. The Service is laid back and so is the kitchen, but that&apos;s what I expect with the culture. I like how the Server approaches you some 30 minutes after you&apos;ve ordered to tell you that they don&apos;t have a particular dish available. Again, I expected this from culture.

The Fried Chicken with Spicy Chili and Eggplant sauce was awesome. It&apos;s the sauce that makes this dish out of this world. (3 Stars)

The Laksa was beautifully presented in a chafing dish. Impressive presentation, however, the taste underwhelmed me. I&apos;m not sure how they can screw up a national dish like Chicken Laksa. Anyway, I recommend avoiding their Laksa. (1 Star)

Southeast Asian food is known adding a fried egg to their dishes. At Chicky&apos;s, their Jakarta Noodles, a stir fried street food, looks like all the other stir fried noodles that I&apos;ve eaten at Asian restaurants. However, what makes these noodles special is that it&apos;s tossed around a hot wok with beaten eggs. OMG! I can&apos;t get enough of these noodles, because the coating of eggs makes this dish so delicious and comforting.  (4 Stars)

Overall, Chicky BBQ&amp;Grill is not a replacement to my beloved Indonesian Food stands at the Duarte Inn, but it&apos;s a decent place to eat Indonesian food while the food stands are in hiatus. Note this is a cash only establishment.

I am a food travel and a chef, &quot;Real chef&quot; not rookie or who just got hired yesterday. And grew up with many culture and cuisine, From Creole food, comfort food, French, European to Asian - pan pacific food, you name it. I do lots a crazy stuff beyond you can&apos;t imagine. When it comes to my plate, I am very critical what goes to my body and sometime I scale myself is extremely picky of what I eat. My mouth is very sharp like knife when I critic somebody in anyway at work or my daily life. I could be a jerk and cold than Gordon Ramsay or cool like Guy Fieri.
I appreciated Quality not quantity, if you can have both, great!
Believe me, when you appreciate quality over quantity, you have enough to satisfy your stomach.
I love Indonesian cuisine which my heritage also from. I went to almost each Indonesian restaurants every corner of any states in America. Some of them are Excellent and some of them also are really, really bad.
I&apos;m so sick went to restaurants who claims their food are authentic and delicious, but what I got is whatever, whatever. Food was whatever, customer service was whatever and price was whatever. Sometime you find too watery, not enough sauce, rice look like a plate of porridge (because they bought cheap quality product), they did short cut over here over there, nothing was right. My understanding &quot;RICE&quot; is fundamental of Indonesian cuisine, and Asian in general. They cannot be fail on this. Is a &quot;basic&quot; and is a &quot;necessity&quot;. I normally just come onetime, or not finishing the food at all, and just pay and walk away, and I rather cook something for myself at home than pay for nothing!
I know restaurant business is tough right now, food cost it wasn&apos;t always about cutting of your cost. Tell me, which way you want, you rather spend more in cost to exceeding customer expectation and you created more customer base or you cut some cost, lousy food and no customer, then next day you might close your business. I found this a lot, one day, one restaurant is open and next couple month they closed down. I saw this many time and That&apos;s our dilemma.
But until last Saturday, just like any other day, I was driving to get my lunch, and my head got stuck with Indonesian food for the whole 2 weeks. And guess what, I am cool this time, just wanna have a good lunch and nothing else.
I went to Chicky BBQ and Grill. A small family owned Indonesian Restaurant in Duarte Inn shopping center. I love chicken satay and nasi rendang, just like I want everything in one day lunch. Although, they have lot of choices, you know, we can have it all. Damn it, after all these years, I finally found a spot that I can have all in one, in an excellent way. I ordered chicken satay with rice cake and Nasi Padang with Beef Rendang and my dessert was delicious Es Cendol.
The chicken satays are delicious, tender, perfect well seasoned and marinated. Enough grill mark strip which is cooked well. The spicy peanuts dipping sauce are perfectly delicious, well done, well done! And the rice cakes (lontong) are fork tender, and excellent bite for your mouth.
Oh yeah, Beef Rendang in my Nasi Padang are excellent perfectly delicious fork tender, well seasoned, I bet they cooked it for hours. They added those with some tender Kale leafs cooked in coconut curry soup, some green chili (sambal), curry chicken, and spicy fried egg.
This is what originality taste of Indonesian comfort food is all about. I don&apos;t know if you are one of those who understand quality of great food, not the price, it was worth every of my penny. I never understand definition of &quot;Expensive&quot; or &quot;Cheap&quot; in my dictionary. I went to many Indonesian restaurant in my beloved Los Angeles and many state, but I never had such full feeling until today. For those Indonesian restaurant who claims they are the best, seriously! Wake up! Reviews what you do. We all work so hard to make a living! and a good food is a great reward for our hard working. Until today I never had such an honest Indonesian cuisine is all about and I found it in Chicky BBQ and Grill. They took seriously what they are doing and they worked hard to prove it. I spoke with Tjiky and his wife Lenny (owners), They were very friendly and energetic to explain their passion about Indonesian cuisine. The food speaks itself and that&apos;s what I like about this restaurant. They took very seriously what they do. They did a great job. They want to present diversity of Indonesian culture by its cuisine. I gave them 2 thumbs up!!!
They all delicious and mouth watering. I ate some at the restaurant, and ordered some to go. I normally never order food to go. I like fresh not microwave, this one exceptional, because it was so good. I just wanting some more. They made everything in simple way and plating food in wise design. You know is hard to find home cooking restaurant these day. Although, some improvements need, I&apos;ll definitely be back, and this is the best INDONESIAN CUISINE RESTAURANT in Los Angeles by far.

I tried this restaurant when it first opened up a couple of years ago!  I thought it had closed down since its rare that restaurants survive unless they&apos;re good.

I&apos;ve tried a couple of dishes here.  Unfortunately, I do not remember their names.  They were pretty good.  The last dish I had was a stir fried noodle dish with shrimp, cabbage, and pickled cabbage.  This was pretty good.

I would give this a 3.5.  Its not the best food I&apos;ve tried but still pretty good. I will have to try some more dishes to give it a more accurate rating.

This little place is hidden behind an El Pollo Loco. Great food, great price. Ordered a fish with egg stuffed inside with fish sauce the first time. Then I tried the fried rice.
I&apos;m excited to eat something different the next time I visit.

Being of Indonesian descent and growing up with this kind of food all my life; you would think I would be pretty bias in my review. Well, actually I could be more critical due to my experiences with different chefs and cooks throughout the year.

Service is great but the food is excellent! I&apos;m the rice kind of guy so I will always order the rice dishes; Nasi Padang, Nasi Rames, Nasi Bungkus, Nasi Uduk or Satay plate... Okay I&apos;ll admit I&apos;ve been eating here for some time, but the food really is good. For those not to familiar with Indonesian food I would suggest the sweet BBQ flavor beef or chicken Satay which comes with rice, salad, sweetened peanut butter sauce and 2 egg rolls. And don&apos;t forget your cold drink like the es cendol or coffee flavored avocado smoothie.

Portions are reasonable, but if your used to Hometown Buffet than this place is not for you. Price for what you get is quite reasonable. Remember each plate has a variety of meats, vegetables, eggs and rice.

Tried ketoprak and lamb satay.  Excellent.  Service was considerate.  Will definitely go back, even though it&apos;s a considerable drive.

(Put 5 stars in context.  This is an ethnic, family-run spot with exceedingly reasonable prices.  All the stars are for flavor and their demonstrated respect for humanity and Indonesian food;  not for ambiance, suck-up service, or valet anything.)

Chicky BBQ hides behind the El Pollo Loco.

Wow, I can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t Yelped this yet.  I am a regular here since I work down the street. I have tried and loved many things on the menu, but what it comes down to is this crazy jonesing for their curry kale and coconut rice. Often times I only call that in. A LARGE kale please and coconutty rice and my eyes roll back in my  head and I moan, and I am in Chicky heaven. I can&apos;t get enough.

I would definitely call your order in first if you are picking up to go. They can be a bit pokey, but its worth it.

Warning: Closed on Tuesdays.  Don&apos;t want to see you standing there sobbing with your face pressed against the glass and the closed sign. No, that wasn&apos;t me. Really.

This place must sit on blessed ground cuz once you step in there&apos;s pleasantness all around.  Customers were helping other customers, the owners were getting hugs and I got extra chili sauce, no problem!

Ordered the es durian (durian smoothie), nasi padang (rice with curry meat and kale) and sate kambing (lamb satay) to go.  Es durian was more milky than durian.  I like my durian smoothies stankified.  The kambing was not gamey and smelled like they cooked it over a flame.  Nasi padang was outstanding!  I asked to substitute more beef instead of chicken.  Beef was tender, kale was so good.  I&apos;ve had better chili in west covina but it all mixed well together.  Separating each part of the food in the packaging was a nice touch.  I&apos;m so happy to find a good indonesian place that&apos;s close by.  Will be eating many more times here.

Cash.

First, I was served Hot tea in a plastic water Cup! Who does this! after that I became very concerned about the quality of the rest of the meal. Then to my horror all I heard was Ding, Ding! the sound of the microwave going off! Oh my a microwaved dinner. The server was glued to her laptop, I mean like glued. I really wanted to just leave but was not sure if it was legal when I heard the microwave. Then The food arrived and it was a big disappointment. No flavor at all, the oils they used were obviously as cheep as the 1 lousy paper napkin that the penny pincher owner allowed. The same cheap mentality carried over to the ingredients and It tasted like a Roman noodle meal. Save your money and skip this dive.

I went to this place a long time ago and forgot all about it.  I remember getting really good gado gado ( Indonesian salad with peanut dressing) at one of the Indonesian bazaar.  It was the best gado gado I had in Los Angeles.

I went to the restaurant for the first time and my gado gado wasn&apos;t that good.  I think that&apos;s why I never went back there until recently.

Holland Spreken!! Wow this place is a Dutchville ;)  So many Dutch @ the restaurant when I went there.  The amount even doubled after I finished eating.  Check out the store next to the restaurant if you are interested in buying either Indonesian or Dutch groceries.

We ordered nasi timbel and nasi padang.
Nasi Timbel: rice with salted fish, spicy sour soup, cabbage, cucumber, fried chicken, fried tofu and fried tempe (soybean cake) served with green chili sauce.  It was pretty good.  I would get this again.
Nasi Padang: rice with curry beef, curry chicken, boiled egg with chili sauce and curry veggie.  Not as good as nasi timbel but good also.
Pork Satay: I don&apos;t really like pork satay but you can buy the satay per stick.

Overall I was very satisfied with my lunch.  I will be back with my Dutch baby again.  The owner came out from the kitchen and told me to let her know if there&apos;s anything I need.

4 stars!!

Chicky BBQ&amp;Grill is yummylicious!!

Definitely a fan! I found this place right before I decided to go veg for a year, but now I&apos;m off the wagon and already craving Chicky again!

I agree with other posters: this place is addictive. The only problem when I was coming here a lot is that they would often be out of their beef before I would get there for supper.

One of my favorite loves about L.A.&apos;s food scene is the wonderful representation of many ethnic cuisines. Case in point, Chicky in Duarte, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite lunch spots in the San Gabriel Valley.

A fairly small strip mall fast-casual eatery specializing in Indonesian fare, their dishes are generous in portions and wonderful in flavor and aromas, a complex mix of sweet, savory and tangy with a good dose of spiciness that makes it perfect for a rainy day.

It&apos;s hard to decided on a favorite dish, but one I reliably order time and again is the nasi kuning (simply meaning yellow rice, from the color it takes on from the tumeric), that is served with tumeric-flavored fried chicken, beef and egg in a vibrant and spicy red sauce and potato croquette (also tumeric/curry flavored). It may sound like a spice-overload, but it is very well balanced with the other ingredientss (like coconut in the rice, or the plain starchy-ness of the potato), making for a combo plate that is infinitely vibrant and ever more intriguing and delightful with every bite. And all that for $6.95!

And oh, they also have avocado and durian shakes too (for those who are into that, like I am at least for the former)

For those with more conservative palates, they also serve Americanized Chinese/Japanese fare like orange chicken, teriyaki salmon, egg foo young and tonkatsu curry too. But if you&apos;re as foodventurous as I am, stick to the stuff that needs pronounciation and explanation guidance from the staff ;)

As a true fan of food, I believe whole-heartedly that one must plunge into various cuisines for which you know nothing about.
Also, I think Chicky BBQ&amp;Grill is a good time to implement my own wait-till-at least-the-second-visit-for-the-five-stars rule.  Although, surely the five will come.
Very friendly owner (or guy that walks around acting like he owns the place)...talked to him for awhile about how business was going...popular dishes, etc. before we actually got to ordering.

I don&apos;t claim to know anything about &quot;traditional&quot; Indonesian fare, but the flavor of my lamb dish seemed on par with the characteristics of a dinner once scrumptiously made for me by a good Dutch-Indonesian friend.

Had a fun coconut juice drink, right out of the coconut. I&apos;m used to drinking the Whole Foods (non sweetened) versions as a hydrating-electrolyte-replacing strategy during workouts, so the &quot;rose water&quot; addition, made it a pleasantly different sort of treat.

A return visit will be happening soon...

I&apos;ve been visiting this restaurant on a casual basis because a colleague is extremely obsessed with their Indonesian cuisine. Quality has definitely been consistent. However they&apos;re awfully slow on the cooking/preparation part. They&apos;re closed on Tuesdays. Price range would start from $6.50 to like $9.

A few of my favorites is the Laksa (coconut curry rice noodle soup), Satay (bbq skewers of pork, chicken or lamb), Nasi Padang (rice wrapped in banana leaf with meat..not sure on this one).

The laksa has a very rich creamy broth as their main ingredients is curry and coconut milk. It might be a tad greasy for some people but the taste is honestly really amazing. The perfect blend of bean sprouts, spices, sliced boiled egg, chicken and chewy vermicelli rice noodle makes it the perfect noodle soup. Spice blend was not overly powering and the rich flavor just married perfectly together.

Satay here is also amazing. They come in sticks of three if you order their meal like me. My favorite is the lamb satay because when you marinate them right...it rids that strong lamb scent. The skewers were perfectly charred and the meal came with two egg rolls, heap of salad, rice, and a peanut-flavored dipping sauce. The presentation is always nice because they arrange everything on a cute japanese style food tray that has divided sections.

This is a typical mom and pop shop with very curteous service. Abundant parking and is located in the same plaza as El Pollo Loco.

You really have to look for this place to find it.  Thank you Yelpers once again for discovering this wonderful little Indonesian restaurant.  I ordered the Nasi Padang and found it flavorful and plentiful.  I also had their drink with avocado and coconut shavings, which was refreshing.  I have to come back and try the noodle dishes.

I love this restaurant.  I have tried many Indonesian restaurants in the Los Angeles area, and Chicky BBQ is my favorite.  One of my all-time favorite dish is the &quot;Pork Satay&quot;.  Since I moved to US from Indonesia, I have never found a tasty Pork Satay such as the one that Chicky BBQ serves.

They have a good variety of dishes on the menu.  A lot of them are authentic Indonesian dish.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are fulfilling.

The place is definitely not a fast food restaurant and fresh quality cooking does take time.  So, take some time to enjoy dining in with your family or if you don&apos;t like waiting, call ahead for a tasty meal to pickup!   If I miss any dish from Indonesia, Chicky BBQ is where I go to find them.

Indonesian food at an awesome price. We went there with a group of 12 or so. They forgot to serve one person in our group. Still good food though.

Ive tried only four indonesian restaurants in California, and I must admit, Chicky is by far my favorite one. Ive been there multiple times, and I really enjoy ordering their Nasi Padang. I like the unique flavoring indonesian cuisine has to offer..! And this is a really good place to check out. Whether you are new to their food or just want to try something different... you should def. come!

but yes.. everything on their menu is good... and i highly recommend this restaurant.

Tried Indonesian food for the first time last week.

A co-worker of mine had sold plates from this place as a fund raiser for her church.  I had had Thai skewers before, but this was the 1st time that I had ever had the Indonesian kind.  The ones I had last week were chicken only and they were pretty good!

Tonight, I tried the chicken again (this time it was a lot fresher than the ones I had last week) and lamb.  They were both very good.  The portions were pretty sizeable and the juice goes onto the rice, which makes for a good side dish.

The owner, who&apos;s named Chicky, go figure, is a cool guy.  Very hospitable and was willing to stay open for like 15 mins extra while the remaining customers were finishing their food.

This is definitely a place that I would go to again.  Probably with more of a group next time!

Tried this off the beaten path Indo joint and I have to say it&apos;s one of the better indonesian eateries in L.A. Chicky has mad selection too! I had the Nasi Padang - would have loved the bento box it&apos;s served in if I were eating Japanese. Side note, real Indo&apos;s don&apos;t separate their foods...it tastes better when the items mix together a bit.

All in all, this place serves pretty authentic Indo cuisine but I gave it a 3 because my food arrived lukewarm another big no-no for real Indo&apos;s, but if you look beyond that, this place is worth a try! The es cendol was really good but I really wanted an avocado&amp;coffee smoothie, Chicky said the avo&apos;s weren&apos;t ripe today, needless to say another reason why I gave it a 3.

Better luck next time.

The food here is great and the service is wonderful! I went there last Saturday and it was very crowded. We had to be patient in getting our food, but it was DEFINITELY worth the wait!  My favorites at the restaurant would have to be their Nasi Padang, Chicken Satay, and Ayam Penyet. Those three dishes HAVE to be ordered when coming here :)

I&apos;ll make this short ! Best Indonesian food around the Los Angeles area! I have been coming here for the longest time and the food is delicious! People working here are so friendly especially once they get to know you. Also a bunch of Dutch/ Indonesian people hang out here! What do you expect it is an Indonesian restaurant !

Food and service were excellent and it had all the warm and fuzzies of a lovely family run place.  The chicken and beef satay were very tender and juicy.  We&apos;ll definitely visit again.  It is cash only and there is a Dutch grocery store next door, but it was closed...we&apos;ll have to visit that place next time too.

Usually you are greeted by Chicky himself and he gets your order. I think the Ayam Kalasan is really good, the ikan bandeng presto is always nice, and if you like some spicy food, the ayam goreng penyet is really tasty.  It is really easy to passby this joint, since there is an el pollo loco in the front, this place sits further back from the street.  Cash only though.

This place is GREAT! We were actually looking for an Indian restaurant located on my phone app and instead stumbled onto this place. It was a wonderful error. We decided to go in and check it out and what a great surprise! So many different flavors, coconut, curry, it was like Thai food and Indian food all in one (both our favorites). two thumbs up...

Wow!  Just discovered this place, its really good.   I&apos;m no expert on Indonesian food but love to try new cuisines.

Had the Laksa (curry noodle soup) for lunch - pretty good for a lunch dish.  Friends had chicken bowl (boring!) and satay lunch (#8).   Thumbs up all round

Intrigued by this, went for dinner last night (hint - don&apos;t go late, they were closing by 9 and might have closed earlier if we weren&apos;t there)

We got different dishes - mine was a combo of different meats and vegetables - all tasty.  Sorry don&apos;t remember the proper name.  I just asked the server for recommendations.   Friend had one of the banana leaf wrapped things, looked exotic and he said it was great.

Give it a try.  Closed Tuesdays btw

Loved their ck satay (big n tender), and their mie ayam jamur with baso abang2 (noodles are handmade!). es delima is not the way i like it. Soto betawi is not strong enough. Nasi padang is quite good. I wanna try their es avocado, cendol, duren and  doger next time. And the toge goreng.

Oh my! I&apos;m finding that I always have to have my Chicky BBQ!! Indonesian food has definately become a staple of my diet.

Chicken satay is highly recommended served with lontong. On weekends there is an outdoor Indonesian market where Chicky serves this and it is excellent! The chicken is moist and juicy and the peanuty leftover satay goes well with the chilled compacted rice.  Yet as a dinner, it comes with extra sides and salad and is very economical!

However, I am always drawn to the Nasi bunkus or nasi Padang.  There are so many flavors poured over rice, all wrapped in banana leaf.  Traditional indonesian food, but i doubt you will find such flavors around here unless you stop by Chicky!

One of my favorite restaraunts ever.
