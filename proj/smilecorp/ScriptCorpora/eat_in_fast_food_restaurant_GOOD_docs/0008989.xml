 Tweet our visit to this restaurant was very short lived, we ordered our food, as we had children we went to find a seat, after searching round the restaurant for a table clean ish to sit at we sat down awaiting our food which was delayed due to incompitance, the person serving me went off to take another persons order and didnt take payment for my order, once sat i felt uncomfortable about the mess of the table so i asked a member of staff if they could clean the table i was sat at with my 4 children. this wasnt followed through my food was brought to me still the table was dirty i asked the person delivering my food if he could clean the table so we could eat our food this person did so with such A fuss, non of the 15 tables was clean the floor was dirty chips on the floor was very dirty and not at all clean. why i am making this complaint is i feel the standards had been dropped imencly as the bins were ful inside and out. I also went to the toilet to find solids stuck to the pot and put on the wall discusting, luckyly i had eaten my tea before seeing this as this pic shows it on the wall.
i have attacted some pictures of the restaurant,
hope to see this restaurant in more of a cleaner state or i will have to take this further.
many thanks,
