 5 Hour Energy Berry–Review 
 
 
 5 Hour Energy Berry–Retail Price: about $2.99 per bottle (2 fl. oz.)
Available Size: 2 fl. oz. (60 ml)
 Taste: 5.5/10
 Price: 5/10
 Energy Level: 8/10

5 hour energy is a dietary supplement drink designed to boost your energy quickly and conveniently. This supplement drink is distributed by Living Essentials which is located in Novi, Michigan, United States. In spite of its small size, 5 Hour Energy Berry packs a tremendous amount of energy, it will wake you up! After drinking this energy supplement drink, I felt a caffeine-energy-rush that peaked for about 30 minutes. The energy was noticeable up to two hours. This energy supplement drink gave me minor side effects, such as headaches and stomachaches. The side effects was nothing major and it didn’t bother me much. I suggest drinking 5 Hour Energy Berry on a semi-full stomach to reduce the minor side effects.

The most noticeable flavor from 5 Hour Energy Berry was sweet-berry-citrus. The flavor of its light-pink energy juice was sour at first, then overwhelmed by a sweet-berry medicine like taste. Its sweet-berry flavor had a burning sensational feeling that reminded me of liquor. Its energy juice also had a strong smell similar to children cough medicine.

If you have never drank 5 Hour Energy Berry before, I recommend drinking half of the bottle until you get use to it and don’t drink it on a regular basis. 5 Hour Energy Berry is very high in synthetic vitamins, caffeine and energy blends. Worst of all, it contains sucralose which is an artificial sweetener that has been known to have toxic side effects. Because of these synthetic ingredients, I urge people to drink this energy shot with care.

 The pros 

 Energy kicks in quick and very strong Convenient to carry around Low in calories 

 The cons 

 Energy kicks in strong but disappears quickly Has a medicine-like taste and is too sweet Smells like children cough medicine Contains a lot of synthetic B-vitamins and caffeine Contains artificial sweetener May cause stomachaches and headaches A little on the expensive side 

 5 Hour Energy Berry Supplement Facts (serving size–2 fl. oz.)
 

 Calories: 4 Niacin: 30 mg–150% DV Vitamin B6: 40 mg–2000% DV Folic Acid: 400 mcg–100% DV Vitamin B12: 500 mcg–8333% DV Sodium: 10 mg–&lt;1% DV Caffeine: about the same as a cup of coffee (80 mg of caffeine on average)

I’m a personal trainer as well as a student at GA Tech research institute. I’ve looked into all the active and inactive ingredients in this product, and did some research after taking Extra Strength 5-Hour Energy for the first time about an hour ago. I’m pretty wired; I would compare the effects to drinking an espresso coffee drink.

*** Pros *** Won’t make you fat. Seems cheap, easy, and a potent, magical elixir to give you that“extra boost”whenever you need it. Great in moderation…Seemingly no“crash.”Gives you near-instantaneous boost of energy comparable to doing cocaine–a powerful stimulant–for an extended period of time. However, this is definitely a con as well (very strenuous exertion on your heart, just like the effects of doing any other stimulant have on the body)!

*** Cons *** All the preservatives in 5-Hour Energy are extremely potent carcinogens, meaning they cause cancer if consumed in large amounts. This product also elevates your blood pressure to an almost dangerous degree, meaning it should not be consumed by people with any history of heart problems. I also think that you WILL develop heart problems if you take too much of this product. The caffeine levels are comparable to drinking 12 ounces of espresso coffee (it even says so on the back of the bottle), again, very, very unhealthy. The dangerous levels of B12 and B6 (over 8300% daily intake and 2000% daily intake, respectively), are DANGEROUS and TOXIC (symptoms of excess consumption of B6 include pain and numbness of the extremities, and in severe cases difficulty walking; symptoms of excess consumption of B12 include diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems) unless you drink a LOT of water (since vitamin B is water soluble) to flush out your system.

*** Conclusion *** I would not recommend this product to any of my clients. I’d do it only when I necessarily have to, and then, only in small amounts. It is essentially the same as drinking an espresso coffee drink from Starbucks without the after-effects. Half the bottle should be sufficient to give a huge boost of energy to anyone…doing the whole bottle will F you up (try it for yourself, it’s a crazy little drink). Don’t do too much, I guarantee it will F your body up, and fast. Balance is the key to life, so do everything in moderation and you should be fine. Make your own call.

This is DANGEROUSE of couple of my friends thought it would be hilariouse to slip a bottle of 5 hour energy Berry in a few cups of fruit punch and although bitter I drank them thinking nothing of it. I sufferd a heart attack not an hour later. My friends drove me to the e.r where they informed a nurse I had drinken six of them unknowingly within a twenty minute time frame. These should not be available to minors!!!

I can’t believe you suffered a heart attack. I have heard people having an increased of heart rate after drinking energy shots but a heart attack, Scary! Energy shots contain such high levels of synthetic chemicals that we shouldn’t drink more than one per day. Even better don’t drink them at all.

 Ryan K says: January 6, 2011 at 5:47 am 
I can definitely believe he suffered a heart attack though. After all, it says right on the bottle (admittedly, the text is really small), not to have more than two bottles a day, and to have those two bottles several hours apart. Drinking six of these will give you as much caffeine as if you gulped down a quart and a half of black coffee.

This applies to all highly-caffeinated drinks. Having more than one every few hours can be dangerous, whether it’s an energy shot, an energy drink, or even a cup of coffee.

I highly recommend it. We drive 20 hours to visit my son and it’s the only thing that works for me. I have high blood pressure and have never felt an adverse effects. Yesterday we returned and I had taken a decongestant (no good w/high blood pressure) and a second bottle about 1 1/2 hours after the 1st. That I would NOT recommend doing–I did feel nauseous and had pain in my stomach. 1 bottle with some food worked great for me!!
 Reply Taylor L. says: February 7, 2009 at 5:18 pm 
Michael McCarty is wrong about B12 being toxic. Studies have shown even injections of extremely (well above anything put into 5 shot energy) do not cause a“toxic effect”. Yes, you can get very mild diarehea as a side effect of drinking these if taken on a completely empty stomach, such as if just getting up in the morning. Any B12 that your body does not need after taking this drink, after filtering through the blood stream, will simply be passed out of the body as urine. If you really are an unbeliever in the wonders of your body’s ability to remove B12, drink some water to help it pass along . However, there are some very very very very very rare signs of a toxic/allergic reaction–so far only allergic reactions have been (Rarely) documented, there has been no reported b12 poisoning.

 PL Chang says: February 7, 2009 at 8:42 pm 
It is true that vitamin B12 is easily excreted by the body because it is water-soluble. The truth is, too much of anything can be toxic to the body, even pure water. I do agree with Taylor that it is rare to have toxic/allergic reactions from consuming vitamin B12. If we are talking about consuming synthetic vitamin B12, than toxicity may be greater. Most B-vitamins in energy shots or energy drinks are usually synthetic because it is cheaper. Drinking too much synthetic B-vitamins will probably cause more harm than good.

Just an FYI, take it for what you will. After approx 3 hours from consumption of this, I developed tachycardia (Very Rapid heart beat), and had to be transported via squad to the hospital. Dr’s are saying they believe that I could have undiagnosed high blood pressure which this product really aggravated, but they aren’t sure. I want people who have or may have heart, bp, etc. problems to check with their doctors and be careful with this product.

Our 29-year-old very healthy (former high school and college athlete) son drank a whole bottle of 5 Hour Energy after an intense work out and had heart attack like symptons on his drive home! He pulled over, called his wife, and she convinced him to call 911. Ambulance medics said he checked out ok, but it was a definite warning that there is something in this drink that is dangerous. You would think that his crisis would have made me think twice about drinking it one month later…but, no. Because I had consumed it in the past without any problems I drank a whole bottle of 5 hour energy on a semi-empty stomach before a trip. (Big mistake) My husband and I were traveling out of town at night to attend a wedding the next day. After the first 45 minutes of our 3 hour trip, I had stomach cramps so badly I had to stop at a Rest Area where I was on the toilet for 1 hour! I thought I was going to pass out. At first I had consipation with profuse sweating. Then diarrhea with profuse sweating and later dehydration. It’s a wonder I didn’t faint. Thank God my loving husband checked on me every few minutes and later raced me home. I was an irritable patient due to the annoying muscle twitching I had from the dehydration and/or product leaving my system. He encouraged me to drink some GatorAde we luckily had with us. (Yes, we unfortunately missed the wedding of our dear friend’s daughter.) Although I have sipped on 5 Hour Energy in the past WITH NO PROBLEMS, I’ll never consume it again because I’m convinced there is something in this energy drink that can cause some very serious problems.

 PL Chang says: May 22, 2010 at 2:00 pm 
5 hour energy contains a lot of synthetic ingredients. One of its worst ingredients is sucralose which is an artificial sweetener. Independent researchers concluded that sucralose is a neurotoxin and works similar to aspartame.

5 hour energy should only be consumed in small quantity. People who have health problems or are worried about their health should stay away from this energy shot.
 Reply L.A. says: May 26, 2010 at 2:03 pm 
I want to be completely fair, so I came back online to update my earlier post where I suspected that 5 Hour Energy may have been the cause of sudden diarrhea and sweating. Since I posted this entry, I have learned that there is an outbreak of the stomach flu or viral gastroenteritis that has been going around. This may have been the reason for the reaction, and NOT the 5 Hour Energy.
 Reply Nancy says: September 11, 2010 at 9:45 pm 
I was taken to the hospital by ambulance after drinking this. Head to toe hives, vomiting&amp;passing out, irregular heartbeat, pounding headache, extreme weakness and exhaustion, constricted throat, etc.! This product is not safe. They don’t list all the ingredients and I tried to get them to know what I should be avoiding, but the company rep refused to give them to me citing“proprietary blend”. They said they will get back to me.

They were not helpful, and I was very sick. Drink coffee and give up these energy shots. Stay safe.

I had my first shot today. To begin with it tasted bad. But instead of giving me energy it totally left me lethargic. Later I broke out from head to toe with rash and hives. This product should have better warning labels. I agree that they should list all ingredients and possible side effects.

This product is horrible, it is like taking speed, LSD, crystal meth or some drugs I’ve read about that makes you jittery, nervous, heart palpatations, tightness and pressure in your head like it will explode.

Heart racing, loose stools, almost vomited, blood rushing to my head, head was burning ect…. It feels like you are high or in a trance. Could not sleep properly at least for two days. it’s been 3 days Iand i’m still experiencing negative syptoms. I am healed by the Lord’s stripes but I will never take this product again……. Stay away from it, dangerous poison-witch tonic….. something else is in this bottle besides vitamins and niacin…..

If you have never had caffeine before then yeah, you will feel jittery and much like the way you felt. That’s why you start small…i mean what do you expect to happen when you drink something that has a high amount of caffeine in it and you’ve never had it before?

I looked forward to trying it as I have a long 1600 mile drive coming up. Bought a 6 pack at WallyWorld, shook it up and drank a bottle and went about my business. I forgot I had taken it and an hour later I’m driving home yawning. It did absolutely nothing. I’m average 5’10..170 lb. don’t do drugs, so its not like my system is used to something strong.
Go figger.

I’ve tried some others way in the past that had ephidrine in them, but couldn’t stand the crash. Was hoping this was the product I was looking for to use now and then. But it just did nothing. I have 5 bottles left, and will drink then because I’m too cheap to waste them.
Maybe the next bottle will work.

if you feel jittery eat a small meal. Moreover, 5 Hour energy should not be taken with coffee or other caffine supplements.

I took this energy shot today because Wal-mart was giving them away to try for samples. I literally thought I was going to die about 20 minutes later. My heart was racing so fast that I started to black out. I thought I was going to pass out and I couldn’t catch my breath. I was praying so fervently to God to save me. I was terrified. I have an 8, 5, and 3 year old at home and they were all I could think about. I think this stuff must be dangerous. I took it at 11:30 a.m. and it is now 11:05 and I still don’t feel right. I called the ER. I didn’t go in but I seriously considered it.

I had a terrible experience with this product. I took this product twice on day. Once in the morning and then in the afternoon. The next morning when I peed…It was crazy burning. It was like that for three weeks afterwards . I had to goto the doctor and got a STD test, prostate exam, and uti sample. The doctor couldn’t figure it out. Everything came back clean. It’s no coincidence that I took 2 one day and my piss felt like fire the next day. It does wake you up, but unless you enjoy buring pee, I suggest you stick with coffee.

All these scary experiences with 5 Hour Energy sound like a reaction to more than the caffeine in the product. I suspect in the worst cases, it is the combination of the caffeine and the L-phenylalanine. Some of us can’t easily process and excrete phenylalanine ( I am one of them) and it is like a bad trip that just goes on and on. Adding a cups-worth of strong coffee to it could have been the factor that put so many of these folks over the edge.

I would never drink anything that has either coffee or phenylalanine in it, after the experience I had on it.

I see from the label it also contains sucralose, which is similar to aspartame, and reportedly, an excitotoxin. Why mess around with your brain? That’s one organ they don’t do transplants with.

I review a number of the leading energy drinks on my Web site and have some informative ingredient/price comparison charts there. http://www.healthyplanetdiet.com/ 
 Reply caboaaron says: May 30, 2010 at 1:37 pm 
If you take just 1/2 a bottle, vs. the whole shot then you’ll have a much different reaction. It works and you must eat something first before taking it. In addition, drink plenty of water as well. My fiancee is taking it, its at costco for a great deal, in place of drinking mt dew. Starting out..only 1/2 a shot at first otherwise you’ll get a rush from the niacin. 
 Reply Lady McHerb says: June 14, 2010 at 6:42 pm 
I took this product last night as I had only gotten about three hours of sleep the night before.

I’ve taken this product a few times, and will never drink one of these again. While it does work, the rapid heart rate it causes scares the crap out of me. I’ll stick to coffee, thank you.
 Reply Paul Kemp says: July 12, 2010 at 7:32 am 
It sounds like a lot of people are being turned off to the potential of energy shots because of bad formulation in this one product. That is unfortunate because the energy mix I use has none of these side effects.

No headaches, no diarrhea, no weirdness—just clean, even happy energy at less than half the cost of 5-Hour Energy. And it comes in powder form, so you can make it as strong or weak as you like.

I review a number of the major energy drinks and 5-Hour on my Web site, with an energy drink comparison chart to help consumers weed out the junk from the jewels.

Energy drinks and shots are an improvement over coffee or tea—IF they don’t have crazy levels of synthetic vitamins and artificial preservatives and sweeteners.

Before you write them off entirely, or hurt your heart/liver/kidneys/brain with some of the poorly formulated crap out there, become an educated consumer.
 Reply Jasminee says: August 8, 2010 at 5:06 am 
I read alot of these negative comments about peoples bad experiences and it kind of makes me think for a second. Well I was really tired todayy but I still wanted to work out so I went to the the gym and bought a 5-Hour energy drink ( I had never tried it before ) I just wanted to see if it would work and give me energy to have a good work out. I don’t drink coffee or sodas and all that. I just drink water onlyy ha. So I drank the whole thing and I didn’t feel much different but I had a extremeeeelyyy good work out but after I twitched a little bit. It was really weird.. Idk if that was from the drink or exercise. I felt perfectly fine and I had to go number 2 like 45 minutes after but other then that I didn’t feel sick or anything. Plus I didn’t eat much before. I just had pineapple. But I’m gonna be more careful next time I drink that because I don’t want to end up in the hospital, but I do reccomend it for anyone whos wanting to have an intense work-out session! But I do not recommend it to anyone with heart problems just from what I’ve read. I’m still going to look into this product more.

Even the bottle says do not exceed more than twice a day…so its obvious to use your discretion and use only as much as u need. We are all adults here. This product is awesome! No side effects but tons of energy!
 Reply Paul Kemp says: March 29, 2011 at 2:07 pm 
I keep hearing bad things about 5 Hour Energy. It amazes me that adults take this stuff without first researching the ingredients to get some idea what kind of reaction they might have to them.

If you aren’t used to drinking coffee daily, then even the moderate dose in 5 Hour may be too much for you.

More than that, though are all the other ingredients such as high doses of B vitamins and the sucralose and L-phenylalanine combined may push your unique body chemistry over the edge.

Why take the chance? If you aren’t familiar with the substances you are consuming, don’t assume that just because they are legal that they will provide you a pleasant“trip”.

There are much safer and more pleasant energy drinks on the market. My philosophy is,“Find a good one and stick with it—don’t play Russian roulette with strange potions!”

5 hour energy is not healthy for you. If you are worried about your health, avoid all energy shots. Energy shots are extremely high in synthetic vitamins and chemicals; therefore, they are not good for your body.

The answer to your question is yes. It is not a good idea to drink energy shots on a daily basis for longer periods of time.

Kinda figured the sucralose was bad but what i didn’t know was that the B vitamins were synthetic. I won’t be doing any more of these. I don’t like to consume synthetic ANYTHING. The body isn’t designed for that. Short term may seem fine but it’s the long term effects….the ones that will be hard to trace back to this stuff that worries me. Kinda like a“soft kill”over time.

Most energy shots, energy drinks, junk food and vitamin supplements contain synthetic vitamins and a good portion of them contain genetically modified ingredients. If you are worried about your health, avoid them as much as possible.

I have used 5HE for a few years with none of the nightmare side effects that people here keep posting about. Common sense is paramount…proceed with caution until you know how your body will tolerate mega-doses of B-vitamins and amino acids. Drink plenty of water to help flush the unabsorbed B-vitamins. And when all else fails, read the instructions! Are caffiene and sucralose healthy? Probably not…but you gotta love it when someone complains how dangerous 5HE is because their idiot friends poured 6 of them in their drink and they ended up in the ER. Or someone compares it to LSD…gimme a break. Some of these posts are so dumb. Be smart…don’t try to substitute energy drinks for actual sleep; don’t use energy drinks every day, let alone multiple times a day; and parents, don’t give energy drinks to small children to boost their performance on the friggin soccer field…what are you, stoopid or sumthin?

Never again! I was the designated drive one night, so I thought I would stay alert at the concert with my friends by trying one of these little drinks. How harmful could it be? They sold it at every gas station we stopped at on our 5 hour drive to the venue.

Wow was I wrong. Within 30 minutes i was feeling really weird, racy heart, jitters, clammy and anxious. I had just enough time to tell my girlfriend“I don’t feel good”. Next thing I know I was looking up at the sky with my friends all looking down at me. I passed out right in the middle of the concert. I was so confused and disoriented. I thought I was going to have a heart attack.

Needless to say, I ruined the concert for my friends by freaking them out, I was sore from hitting the ground and I was not the designated driver anymore.

What an awful experience. I admit, I didn’t research the 5 hour energy drinks. I know sometime what effects one person will effect someone else totally different. I don’t think it is worth the risk. At the end of the day: passing out or freaking out does effect the people around you. STAY AWAY FROM THESE!!!

These comments make me laugh!!! You people remind me of that moronic woman who sued McDonald’s because she put her coffee between her legs and burned her“area”because, guess what…Coffee is hot!! Idiot!! Energy drinks make your heart rate increase. 5 Hour Energy shots are awesome. They do what they say they will do which is more than I can say for a lot of other products out there. Maybe they don’t need a warning label, just an I.Q. test for stupid consumers.

Hahahaha fools who are bashing 5 hour energy for there friends or child’s heart attack give it a break. Ive been drinking 5 hour energy drink extra strength every day for work for the past month and it helps me be faster and more mental clarity allowing me to remember things essential to perform my job duties. This and spike energy are my heroes. I have a hard time waking up and jumping into work full speed but with 5 hour energy I get motivated, energetic and an overall mood lift which helps since I have to talk to customers and act go lucky and happy which im generally not into. Thank you 5 hour

I’m all for freedom to do whatever a person can handle. Obviously some people can handle 5 Hour Energy better than others. I know that I would not be one of them.

The bigger question is,“What is 5 Hour Energy doing to the bodies of those who use it over a multi-year period?”Life can last a long time and who really knows what effects users of 5 Hour Energy will face twenty years down the road?

I work with people who regularly use 5 Hour Energy and I have noticed weird irrational personality changes in them. They seem, at times, to be losing their sense of humor and their humanity in their driven approach to their work.

When there are healthier alternatives to things like 5 Hour Energy, I’d be checking them out—or just finding a new line of work that didn’t require me to use a damaging substance to do a job I really wasn’t suited for.

In the short term, drinking 5 hour energy is not going to dramatically affect your health. However, in the long term, it will cause health problems. It would be wise to drink 5 hour energy in moderate, or even better not drink it at all.

I have been a“speed freak”for years, taking stackers and such until ephedrine was banned a few years back. Then 5hr energy came out so I started drinking those. Its been several years of pretty much 1 a day and I haven’t really had problems with it. I have noticed the upset stomach if you don’t eat before you drink it. But recently I have been breaking out in hives and itching really badly about 2 hours after drinking it. Im wondering if having such a build up of it in my system is causing an allergic reaction? It was so bad today I thought I might need to go to the ER…Laying off of them for a while to see if this is the cause of my problem.

There are so many ingredients in 5 Hour Energy that I wouldn’t want in my body even once, so it is entirely possible your body just had too much. Hard to say which ingredient did it. Could be the Sucralose or the preservatives.

One way or the other, I would accept hives as my body’s way of saying,“That’s Enough!”

There are better herbal ways to get a cleaner, better buzz without the weird ingredients that most likely caused your reaction.

I’ve drank 5HE many times in the past couple of years without any adverse effects, until last week that is. I drank a half a bottle after lunch and spent the night in the hospital hooked up to a heart monitor. At first the Dr. thought that I’d suffered a mild heart attack, blood pressure spiked at 200/110. So a word of advise, try taking a B+ vitamin after lunch for an energy boost, and leave this shit alone. I won’t be surprised to see this crap pulled off the market at some time in the near future. I wonder if the makers of this witches brew have ever been sued.
