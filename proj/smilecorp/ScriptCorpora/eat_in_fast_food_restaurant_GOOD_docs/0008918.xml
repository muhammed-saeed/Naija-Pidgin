		Activity #1: Where Did Our Food Originate?

Introduction

Most foods were domesticated in prehistoric times by Stone Age peoples. This
activity helps students gain an understanding of point of origin and
domestication, as well as an understanding of the debt that we owe to our early
ancestors.

Objective

 To understand the concepts of
 point of origin and domestication. To understand that the food
 we eat originated in other places and times. 

Materials

A cheeseburger and a cola (or other foods) purchased from a local fast-food
chain; a map of the world; access to an encyclopedia (in the class, school
library, on-line or at home); you may wish to purchase or request that your
school library acquire Reay Tannahill &apos;
s Food in History (New York: Crown, 1988). It is the single best
history of food.

Procedures

Place the food on your desk. When the class has begun, take each item out of
its packaging. Ask students if they have ever consumed these foods. The
majority will report that they have done so, and some will report that they eat
them regularly. Some students may report that they don&apos;t eat these foods due to
religious restrictions , health concerns, or ethical
reasons. Others may not for reasons of taste.

Ask students to list the components that go into making cheeseburgers and
colas. List these ingredients on the chalk board. Brainstorm or examine the
food products. Have students look up ingredients listed in Handout
#1 .

Ask students to identify the geographic area of origin or domestication of
each ingredient. Most students will have no idea, but encourage students to
make guesses. Ask students to copy the list of products from the chalkboard.
Assign groups of 3 or 4 students to find out when and where each product
originated or was domesticated. If you have resources in the classroom, this
can be an in-class activity; if not, request that students go to the library to
seek answers or use the Internet if they have access. Please note that not all
products have a single point of origin (such as salt). Some products have one
point of origin and another point of domestication (such as the tomato which
originated in South America, but was domesticated in Central America). For some
foods, their points of origin and domestication are unknown or disputed. After
students have conducted their research, have them report on their findings.
Distribute Handout #l and discuss differences where appropriate.
