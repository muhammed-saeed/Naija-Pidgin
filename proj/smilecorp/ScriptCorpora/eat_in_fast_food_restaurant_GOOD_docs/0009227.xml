 An Open Letter to Taco Bell 

 

Dear Sirs:

I have been a regular Taco Bell customer now for 30 years. As a kid I&apos;d
 ride my bicycle 15 miles to the nearest Taco Bell. I&apos;d purchase and consume
 5 to 7 bean burritos, a large pop and a dozen or so packages of hot sauce.. At
 27 cents apiece I&apos;ll admit that your company didn&apos;t make a wad on my business. Never
 the less, over the years I&apos;ve been a regular customer. Where else can you
 take the whole family out for dinner, eat all you want, and leave with change
 from a $10 bill? Even today, I frequent my local Taco Bell establishments
 at least once and many times twice in a week.

Now, making this kind of public statement is not how I would usually choose
 to deal with the issue at hand, but it seems that your website is broken,
 and has been for the last couple of months. Every time I attempt to communicate
 this information to you in a more private manner, my attempts are rejected. Your
 website insists I provide information that is already clearly provided on the
 communication form. Since no other method of contact is listed, I
 am resorting to standing here on this street corner and shouting to every
 passerby, hoping one of them will get the word to you.

Last August I chanced to visit a Taco Bell restaurant in east Port Angeles,
 WA. My
 initial concern was for the condition of the restroom. I have seen cleaner
 filling station restrooms. The toilet had obviously not been cleaned in
 days, the sink was filthy, the trash can was overflowing, and there was no soap
 in the dispenser. The rest of the facility was in disrepair as well,
 featuring missing floor tiles, dirty tables and generally disgusting conditions.

Next, my wife ordered a bean tostada. What? you don&apos;t make those any longer? That&apos;s
 really too bad, since they&apos;ve only been a part of your menu for, like, forever! Well,
 she&apos;s a good sport - she ordered a burrito.

After 30 years of eating at Taco Bell, I know what I like, and maybe I&apos;m
 in a little of a rut. I always order a bean burrito or two with green sauce. I
 was a bit surprised when my burrito arrived with a plastic tube of green sauce
 on the side. OK, I&apos;ll try most anything once. It was bad. It
 was cold and just didn&apos;t have the same taste of the green sauce I was used to. If
 the plan is to convert all green sauce to this method of distribution,
 I&apos;ll probably have to bid a sad farewell to Taco Bell as my fast food restaurant
 of choice.

Now, last evening I visited a Taco Bell in Tacoma, WA. Maybe I should
 just not eat at Taco Bell in Washington. The place was filthy, the floor
 was sticky, no tostada, and no integrated green sauce. What&apos;s going on
 here? It&apos;s time to get it together or I&apos;ll not be the last customer
 you lose.

Sincerely,

tb!

 UPDATE (09/27/2004) - This letter probably garners the
 most response from visitors to my website. Most of them respond with&quot;Hey, it&apos;s Taco Bell, what
 do you expect?&quot;OK, I&apos;ll tel you what I expect - I expect a clean environment.
 It&apos;s the law. I also expect them to listen. After all, if they aren&apos;t listening
 to their customers, they will go away eventually. That listening may take
 the form of &apos;market analysis&apos;, but let me remind you of a debacle experienced
 by the Chex cereal line a few years back - The machine that manufactured
 Wheat Chex wore out. After much &apos;market research&apos; they settled on a new process
 that, according to the &apos;research&apos; was as good or better than the old product.
 Unfortunately, sales dropped precipitously, the new process was abandoned
 and a new machine was built to manufacture Wheat Chex the old way.
