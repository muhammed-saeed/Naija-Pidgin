Continental Airlines To Tall People: Pay Up For Comfort

​ Houston&apos;s Continental Airlines, all but admitting that its coach seats are torture for any human being taller than Tom Cruise, has decided to do something about it.

They&apos;ve decided to charge people for the right not to have their knees in their face for a three-hour flight to New York or San Francisco.

Of, course, the airline has a somewhat different spin on things: &quot;Continental Airlines to Sell Seat Assignments Offering Extra Legroom at Check In&quot; is the sunny headline on the official announcement.

&quot;Our customers want more choices,&quot; said Jim Compton, Continental&apos;s executive vice president and chief marketing officer. &quot;Seats with additional legroom are higher-value seats, and we want to offer them to customers who recognize that value.&quot;

 Of course, up until the new program goes into effect March 17, those seats could be had for no extra charge, but that didn&apos;t help Continental any.

The seats in question are in the exit rows, and have at least seven inches of additional legroom.

Pricing will depend on the length of the flight, Continental says -- the more you&apos;d suffer, the more you have to pay to get out of suffering. A spokesman told the Associated Press that the charge on a Houston-New York flight might be around $59 on top of the ticket price.

If you&apos;re in Clooney-like levels of Continental&apos;s frequent-flier program, you can get the seats with no additional charge.

Oh, I guess you are talking about the brand new Schlock Airlines....previously known as United Airlines...a quality airline before they were acquired by Continental. Apparently, the only thing that Continental is concerned with is Business Travelers....everyone else is given upgrade on a 24 hour basis.....don&apos;t waste your money on United and its MileagePlus Program...worthless with the new management.... unless you are a business traveler.
 
I am 6,11 and I am happy that airlines company start to understand certain people&apos;s needs.
However I didn&apos;do anything to grow 6,11 and I don&apos;understand why I have to pay extra to have the same benefit that normal people has.
Isn&apos;t enough to pay more for clothes, customized stuff and food (cause we eat more too...)
 
Great, another airline is giving us&quot;more choice.&quot;Only it&apos;s not more choice, it&apos;s another money making scheme that serves to force tall people to pay extra money or risk DVT.

Delta were still allowing you to get an exit row at check-in, for free, when I last flew with them in December? It&apos;s less to do with chance when you show up 4 hours ahead of your flight.

Be careful with the&quot;health issues&quot;claim, if you say it is bad for your health to sit in a&quot;regular&quot;seat and they don&apos;t have a&quot;better&quot;seat, they&apos;ll just take you off the flight.
 
This crap would stop if airline employees were charged extra fees every time they wanted something.

Wearing your Continental badge at the airport fast food restaurant? That will be $0.25 extra for napkins.

Crew checking in at the hotel? There should be an extra fee for each piece of luggage that you bring.

Airport taxi driver? Add a charge for use of the seat belts.
 
honestly. i believe that if you have a phobia or disability they have to accomodate you to keep you from freaking out losing your mind or having a panic attack. if you get your psychologist or therapist to write a letter saying you have a VALID phobia of the extra smallness of being crammed away from the isle.. or better yet.. your chiropractor or spinal specialist to say that to cram you into a small space would cause you signifigant physical damage... they HAVE to accomodate you.. and i don&apos;t believe they can force you to pay extra any more than they can charge you for overweight luggage if the extra weight is medication. oxygen. or life assistance devices you medically require. 

if they want to get technical on you. get technical back. fight fire with fire.
 
Funny they used to ask us tall people if we wanted to sit in the exit row. The extra leg room in the exit row seating isn&apos;t there by choice, it is the law. So for any airline to charge extra for it is ridiculous. Believe me, if the airlines could cram an extra row of seating in there they would.

Rather than nickel and diming us with charges for extra bags, being fat, being tall, changing your flight plans, first class, business class, no class, just charge everyone what it costs for the airlines to make some money, fly safe planes that get us to and fro on time.
 
I don&apos;t understand the complaint with this article. If anything, tall people now have an ability to be more comfortable whereas before, that ability was based on chance. And the airline gets more money which hopefully translates to a lower cost for everyone else, or at least better service or less cuts. Its a win win. And to those cheapskate freeriders who were getting the exit rows before, tough luck but you were impeding progress. It seems like this country gets more anti free market every day.
 
That&apos;s not charging people for being tall, it is charging people for requesting higher value seats that have more leg room.
 
Tall people everywhere should boycott some of these airlines. Let them feel the sting of loss profits. that might change their minds!
 
This sucks, i&apos;m 6&apos;7 and let me tell you, its not only uncomfortable to sit in a small seat, its painful! I&apos;m a broke college student, i can&apos;t afford to be flying as it is, let alone spending an extra $60 to sit in an exit row!
 
I can totally understand going after overweight. Given that most overweight people inadvertantly choose to be that way. Furthermore, overweight people are clogging up our hospitals with all the health problems they eventually develop. I on the other hand, am 6&apos;2 and in very good shape. I do not think people who are taller should be persecuted in the same respect. Furthermore, why can&apos;t we all just load into personal pods, that we can lay down in, and they can stack us up like lugage. I realize that having to go to the bathroom poses it&apos;s problems, but I would even be willing to wear a diaper/cathiter/colostomy bag just so I don&apos;t feel the pain when the idiot in front of me feels the need to recline their seat. They need to take the reclining feature out of seats! Does ANYONE feel that much more comfortable on these shitty seats, when they are able to adjust the angle by 2 degrees?
 
United has been doing this for years. I purchased extra leg room 2 years ago on a United flight. Best $50 ever.
 
Tall people can&apos;t be short...fat people can be skinny. They should make a fat section on the cabin and charge fat people more money. that&apos;s it.
 
As someone 6&apos;2&quot;that used to go online and book the exit/bulkhead seats, I&apos;m not too happy to be charged for what I used to get free. And I&apos;m betting my employer isn&apos;t going to pony up extra $ to keep me from suffering from the kind of claustrophobia that can only be cured by $5 drinks. So guess what... Just booked my 20 hour flight(s) from Houston to Delhi on Emirates instead of Continental. Never flown Emirates, but I&apos;ll give it a shot, and I think I&apos;ll still get my Continental miles for it. Message to Continental... If Emirates is comfy, and they continue to compare price wise, I&apos;ll just give them the $6k a year I spend on tickets.
 
Let me get this straight... you are all complaining because Continental is offering&lt;i&gt;MORE&lt;/i&gt;choice???

So you can either sit where you have always been sitting, or you can pay extra and be accommodated. And like everyone has already mentioned -- all the other airlines do it. This isn&apos;t even news.

And let&apos;s face it, if you are like most people, you are going to take the cheapest flight, regardless of their philosophy on tall/fat people... because in most airports, the second cheapest is a lot more expensive.
 
All I can do is laugh at Continental. Charging to sit in an exit row? They better hope one of their planes doesn&apos;t go down with a bunch of cheapskates riding on it.
 
Just because other airlines already do this does not make it alright for Continental to jump on the bandwagon. I have been flying Continental for a long time and I think they are the best airline by far for a number of reasons (especially over the past few years when other airlines started for many, many things that were once free). The fact that they did not charge for exit row seats was only one of the reasons. This may signal that they are going to change other policies to align with other airlines and that is incredibly disappointing.

For those wondering why this is&quot;news&quot;since other airlines do it -- this is Houston-based Continental, so we tend to write about them more often than other airlines.
 
I can&apos;t wait for the new high speed rail systems around the country, I am totally fed up with the BS the airlines are pulling these days...
 
welcome to every other airline..? united, us air, southwest, delta, etc. have been offering more legroom for an upcharge for a while.
 
United has been doing this for years - they call it economy plus and it&apos;s the same crappy seat with a few extra inches between rows.

What&apos;s the big deal?
 
Crap...Guess I&apos;m never flying Continental again.
 
uhhhhh you can choose not to fly... I see that option hasn&apos;t crossed the brilliant troll minds here.
 
5,5 and i get stiff after an hour.

It&apos;s ok little buddy, don&apos;t go into a manlet rage over this.

Like what? Being able to reach something on the top shelf? Being crammed into a tiny ass plane seat sucks. They should be giving it away to the tallest person. OR at least offering it for nothin.
 
I am 5&quot;7, and one of the only advantages of being that height is a comfortable airlplane ride. Who cares if they pay more?
Tall people get enough advantages on the ground anyway.
 
it seems like a safety hazard to auction off the exit rows to the highest bidder! I&apos;d rather than be a random assignment, to be honest.
 
I am skinny and tall, and this would be a great option to be able to choose these seats. But only at the right $.
 
they should have a movable seat position system so less legroom is allocated to smaller people more to bigger ones. in my class very few people were under 6ft tall the standards for average height airlines are using are decades out of date.
 
Umm, northwest and delta have been doing this for years? Where has the outrage around that been? Solid reporting...
 
This really isn&apos;t a big deal. I&apos;m 6&apos;4&apos;&apos; and fly well enough, so it&apos;s not like they&apos;re forcing me to sit in these special seats...
 
Its downright absurd isnt it? I mean seriously. Wow, These stupid airlines will do anythign they can to pinch every dime they can from you.
