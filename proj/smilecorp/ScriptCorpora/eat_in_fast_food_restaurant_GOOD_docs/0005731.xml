T ravel Rewards Credit Cards have become the 
 latest rage in the credit card industry.
 In the past, consumers shopped for credit cards that offered 
 the lowest
 interest rate. Next came cards with low interest rates and 
 no annual
 fees. Today, consumers can shop for cards based on what type 
 of&quot;reward&quot;they can earn for using a specific issuer&apos;s card.

A recent survey found that nearly half of U.S. cardholders 
 enrolled in
 a credit card rewards program have never redeemed their 
 points.
 However, 60% of consumers said rewards program influences 
 their decision when
 deciding which credit card to use for a purchase.

How does a Travel Rewards Credit Cards program work? Typically, the program 
 awards points,&quot;dollars&quot;or a cash value based on the amount you charge. 
 The rate at
 which you collect points varies depending on what you charge 
 or where you
 charge it. Some programs offer extra points for using their 
 card at a
 specific place such as a supermarket or fast food restaurant 
 or for
 certain items. Some Travel Reward Credit Cards programs offer a variety of rewards. 
 Consumers can earn
 meals, tickets to sporting events, airline tickets, 
 electronics, or
 even create their own reward program.

Upward of 50 credit cards reward their customers with 
 flights,
 upgrades, car rentals, hotel stays and cruises. Each card 
 differs in the kinds
 of perks and the ways they&apos;re doled out.

The United Airlines Mileage Plus 
 Signature Visa and the Continental
 Airlines World MasterCard , both from Chase Bank, award 
 customers one mile for every dollar charged. Sometimes you 
 can pile up miles at an even faster pace: After your first 
 purchase, the United Visa awards 17,500 bonus miles as well 
 as a certificate for a one-way seat upgrade, and the 
 Continental card always gives double miles when it&apos;s used at 
 Macy&apos;s, Avis, Bed Bath&amp;Beyond and other partner 
 establishments.

With airline-affiliated cards, miles accrued through 
 purchases and miles earned through flying are 
 interchangeable. They&apos;re combined into the same 
 frequent-flier account and can be traded in for free flights 
 and upgrades.

The Capital One No Hassle Miles card from Visa gives 
 customers up to two miles for every dollar spent, there&apos;s no 
 annual fee, and miles can be redeemed on any airline -- even 
 foreign airlines and carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest. 
 The MBNA WorldPoints Platinum Plus MasterCard and Discover&apos;s 
 Miles Card likewise allow you to build up points -- one per 
 dollar charged -- with every purchase, and the rewards 
 include flights as well as cruises, cash, and gift 
 certificates from the likes of The
Home Depot and Toys&quot;R&quot;Us. And when it comes to reward 
 flights for all of these cards, there are never any blackout 
 dates.

No Travel Reward Credit Card program is more flexible than cash. The Citi Dividend 
 Platinum Select MasterCard pays you back 5 cents for every 
 dollar charged at pharmacies, gas stations, and grocery 
 stores, and a penny for every buck spent otherwise. American 
 Express&apos;s Blue Cash Card begins by paying you 1 percent on 
 many purchases, and after you&apos;ve spent $6,500 that year on 
 the card, the rebate bumps up to 5 percent.

Many of hotel-branded credit cards, including the Hilton HHonors 
 Platinum Card by American Express and the Priority Club Rewards Platinum 
 Visa (for Holiday Inn and other InterContinental hotels), 
 don&apos;t charge an annual fee. Cardholders build up points to 
 be exchanged for rooms, meals, parking and spa treatments at 
 hotels, as well as rewards that range from golf clubs to 
 iPods through partner companies.

Capital One doesn&apos;t add any extra charges and even absorbs 
 the 1 percent fee from Visa or MasterCard when used outside 
 of the U.S.
