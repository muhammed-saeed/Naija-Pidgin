 Posted - 03/24/2006 : 11:24:08 PM     I am wondering now if I am the only one who received an email entitled: CERTIFIED FIELD ASSOCIATE RATING PROGRAM

This was a survey from Certified Reports (techsupport)

It seems they want to start rating their shoppers (like USDA prime beef) and test shoppers to determine if they are competent.

I would appreciate if anyone else received this message.

Thanks.
