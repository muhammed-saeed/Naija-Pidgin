 The Kreme Team 
 By BILL DALEY; Courant Staff Writer , October 3, 2002 This stretch of the Hempstead Turnpike between the Meadowbrook and Wantagh parkways is lined with fast-food restaurants, strip malls and the occasional office building. If not for the Long Island accents and the crazy driving, you&apos;d think you were on one of the more congested stretches of our own Berlin Turnpike. That may explain why Mike Dillon of South Windsor has spent the past three months living out of a hotel and working, happily, at the local Krispy Kreme Doughnuts store. ARTICLES BY DATE BUSINESS 
 Pop-Up Firework Shops Open 
 By BRIAN DOWLING, bdowling@courant.com and The Hartford Courant , June 29, 2012 They are hard to miss, in parking lots and in unleased storefronts across the state. Around the Best Buy in Manchester. Next to the Super Stop&amp;Shop in Windsor. In front of the former Krispy Kreme shop on the Berlin Turnpike in Newington. Connecticut&apos;s fireworks trade took off this week, as dozens of pop-up retailers, well, popped up Sunday or Monday. They plan to stick around until July 4 and for the most part, their owners and managers say fireworks are selling well. But concerns about the holiday&apos;s mid-week timing and ongoing limitations on what products are legal in the state are weighing on the shops. Advertisement NEWS 
 Krispy Kreme Dream Fades 
 December 15, 2005 It would be unusual to find a town that rejoices over the loss of a business. Newington&apos;s residents, however, could be forgiven if they breathe a sigh of relief over the recent closing of the Krispy Kreme doughnut shop in their town. In 2002, when the North Carolina company broke ground for its first New England store on the Berlin Turnpike, politicians, residents and a brass band were there to celebrate the occasion. Many said the shop would put Newington on the map. Krispy Kreme, whose claim to fame was that its fluffy doughnuts were made and sold hot on the spot, had a national cult following. ENTERTAINMENT

 Calling Krispy Kreme! Come Quickly To Connecticut! 
 By GREG MORAGO , July 17, 1997 If there is a God, Krispy Kreme will come to Connecticut. For now, however, the faithful will have to make worshipful pilgrimages to New York, the closest outpost for the heavenly delight known as the Krispy Kreme doughnut. Anyone who grew up in the South or has been lucky enough on travels there to stumble onto these doughnuts -- yes, darlin&apos;, they&apos;re doughnuts, not donuts -- will know the allegiance Krispy Kreme inspires. (Carrying two dozen Krispy Kremes home on the Metro-North, I was eyed suspiciously and hungrily by commuters until one bold woman asked plaintively, &quot;Are they really that good?&quot; NEWS 
 Setting The Record Straight

 Krispy Kreme&apos;s Wholesale Plan Faces Public Hearing Wednesday 
 By MARYELLEN FILLO; Courant Staff Writer , February 23, 2004 Krispy Kreme will make the news this week, but it won&apos;t be the positive kind usually given the popular North Carolina-based doughnut chain. Residents near the 2-year-old Krispy Kreme store on the Berlin Turnpike have a list of complaints. They plan to present those complaints at a public hearing Wednesday on a request to allow expanded operations in the chain&apos;s first shop in Connecticut. The hearing is scheduled for 7 p.m. in town hall. &quot;Look at the trash all over the street, and the smell of grease because they don&apos;t have any air filters,&quot; said Lori Dubowsky, one of the opponents of the franchise&apos;s request for permission to make doughnuts for wholesale distribution.

 Family Business Lands Sweet Deal 
 By ANICA BUTLER; Courant Staff Writer , January 9, 2003 A family-owned company in Ellington is getting more from Krispy Kreme than its famous doughnuts. For Action Packaging, Krispy Kreme&apos;s continuing nationwide expansion has brought new business supplying labels and label-application machines for doughnuts that are sold in grocery and convenience stores. &quot;It&apos;s one of our biggest deals,&quot; said Doug Rice, 46, president and founder of Action Packaging. Rice explains that an average deal involves the purchase of between 50,000 and 1 million labels in a year. NEWS 
 Just Play By The Rules 
 March 16, 2004 Owners of the Krispy Kreme doughnut franchise on the Berlin Turnpike knew exactly what they were buying into when Newington officials approved their plan to open the store in 2002. Zoning officials cleared the project with a restriction against selling doughnuts to other stores, a profit-making sideline of most Krispy Kreme stores. Whatever possessed the doughnut shop owners to accept the terms and then secretly operate a wholesale business has not been satisfactorily explained. BUSINESS 
 Krispy Kreme: It&apos;s One Sweet Sell 
 By MATTHEW KAUFFMAN , October 9, 2002 This is not a column about doughnuts. Yes, that&apos;s a picture of a glazed ring of dough up there, and today&apos;s food for thought does concern Krispy Kreme, which opened its first New England store Tuesday on the Berlin Turnpike. But we&apos;ll leave it to the foodies to focus on the chow. Because back here in the business pages, the Krispy Kreme phenomenon is about so much more than sugar-packed bakery goods. For the hundreds of hearty souls who lined up outside the Newington store in 40-degree weather Tuesday morning, the payoff was 52 grams of melt-in-your-mouth bliss. SPORTS 
 60 Minutes (Really, Just 4:30) With Diana Taurasi 
 August 25, 2011 I went to the Mohegan Sun today, as I often do in the summer. Despite what you might believe, I did not go there specifically to visit Krispy Kreme, which is usually what I do. On Thursday, I went to watch the Connecticut Sun practice and then say hello to Diana Taurasi and Ketia Swanier of the Phoenix Mercury. Phoenix plays the Sun Friday night at the casino, its only visit here this season. Standing in Diana&apos;s presence, even more intense when just for 4 minutes, 30 seconds, is still much like it&apos;s always been; eye of a hurricane, swirling action, words and jokes flying all around you. Basically, here is what she had to say... BUSINESS

 Charlie Sheen&apos;s A Train Wreck Few Can Resist Watching 
 By Jennifer Lahmers and No Makeup , March 8, 2011 Our stars need to lay off the drugs. First it was James Franco, hosting the Oscars on Xanax. Then, not 24 hours later, we witnessed Charlie Sheen belly-flop off the deep end on ABC and NBC. Both networks were competing for the best promotable sound bites produced by Sheen&apos;s tweeked-out, sweaty head. He tweets about warlocks and tiger blood. He talks about sabres, faces&apos; melting off and rocket fuel like he&apos;s a lonely Internet weirdo playing &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; in his mom&apos;s basement. NEWS

 The Big E: How Much Willpower Do You Have? 
 By LEEANNE GRIFFIN, Special to the Courant , September 22, 2010 Nobody goes to the Big E to stick to a diet. If they did, people wouldn&apos;t be lining up for fried butter. For years, New England&apos;s biggest fair has been churning out increasingly ludicrous foods like the infamous Craz-E Burger, a bacon cheeseburger served on a grilled Krispy Kreme doughnut. When the 1,500-calorie creation debuted in 2009, it was met with both desire and revulsion. But, as you might have guessed, it sold quite well—about 16,000 during the West Springfield fair&apos;s 17-day run, according to Big E spokeswoman Catherine Pappas. ENTERTAINMENT 
 Spilling The Beans With … Sue Lavoie 
 By Java: MaryEllen Fillo , September 16, 2010 For some, a better name for the annual &quot;Big E&quot; Eastern States Exposition that opens Friday would be &quot;The Big Eat. &quot; Each year it is a junk-food fantasy world, one of those rare opportunities, other than Christmas and Thanksgiving, when you can put concerns about health and calories aside for a day and indulge yourself on sugar, butter, fat and dough. For anyone who thinks the deep-fried jelly beans, chocolate-covered bacon, bacon cheeseburgers on glazed doughnuts and deep-fried peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches just magically appear, here&apos;s the scoop: A committee at the Big E dreams up what they would like to entice you with from those food carts, trucks and buildings, spending months on planning and sampling morsels to tempt your palate.

 Krispy Kreme Vs. The Rest Of The Doughnut World: A Taste Test 
 By Bill Daley , October 3, 2002 How do Krispy Kreme doughnuts stand up to the competition? A 122-mile drive to East Meadow on Long Island provides a sneak peak at what the battle will be like once Krispy Kreme opens in Connecticut. Unfortunately, I can&apos;t report on the famed hot doughnut because I get lost in the Bronx (don&apos;t ask) and miss the morning &quot;Hot Now&quot; time zone by about 20 minutes. The East Meadow staffers playfully scold me for missing this morning ritual and then pull a half-dozen of the glazed off a cooling rack. 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Next FEATURES 
 Big E Returns Sept. 17 With More Artery-Clogging Treats 
 August 18, 2010 Hey, remember the Craz-E Burger? How could you forget it? The bacon cheeseburger served between a split, grilled Krispy Kreme doughnut returns to the Big E (Sept. 17 through Oct. 3) this year, along with an impressive array of new, fatty, fried treats. The Northeast&apos;s largest fair features everything from competitive exhibits, animals, parades, crafts, rides and live entertainment. But foodies know that the Big E is all about the eats. NEWS 
 Sonic Drive-In: The Day After 
 By The Hartford Courant , July 15, 2010 Few fast-food restaurant openings have garnered as much attention in Connecticut as Sonic Drive-In, which debuted Wednesday morning in Wallingford.
