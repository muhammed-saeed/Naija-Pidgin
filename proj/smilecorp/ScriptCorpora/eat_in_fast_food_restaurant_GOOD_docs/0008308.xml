Oct 3 : NYC
 


Saturday–October 3rd; A full day in Manhattan. This was what we waiting for. Had to sleep in just a bit after traveling so much the day before, but 10:30am was late enough for everything we had on the Road Trip Itinerary. The first thing James said when he woke up was, “I’m starving!” We had been stretching our stomachs out, despite the fact I’m as skinny as they come. After we all got our things together, we dipped out, heading to the Red Line at the 72st Express Subway Station. Next stop, Breakfast.

Breakfast was unique because it for the first food item we were having from the TV Show that wasn’t food at all; it was a beverage. Getting off the subway, James whipped his iPhone out, launched Google Maps, and lead the way, to Jacques Torres .

Jacques Torres is a chef that is all about my favorite thing in the whole wide world, Chocolate. His website is MrChocolate.com , haha. Giada De Laurentiis (my sisters’ twin) from the Food Network came here for the Wicked Spicy Hot Chocolate. Thank you Giada, I’m ecstatic you did. The chocolate shop was actually quite large, huge for New York City. Divided down the middle, one side was the Bakery, and the other side was the Shop. Approaching outside we gazed through the large windows at all the gadgets the chef’s use to make chocolate, pretty cool to stop and watch. Inside, the decor screamed autumnly colors, awesome looking shop. Yes, I know, “autumnly” is not a word. You got 2 bars to order from; the sweet tooth bar, and the espresso bar. We hit the espresso bar.

“Wicked Spicy Hot Chocolate, small please. Thanks.” Chris and James got the same, Grant went old school and got straight up Hot Cocoa. The name of this drink is kinda different, but it’s the perfect explanation of what it is. It’s Wicked! Taking my first sip, the shear heat burned my tongue. After letting it settle, I got to the good stuff.

It was the creamiest Hot Cocoa ever. Lovable just for that alone. But it wasn’t alone, it had spice a kick. Not hot spicy though, wicked spicy. Apparently they put peppers in the hot chocolate, but don’t compare it to putting tabasco on your grilled chicken sandwich. This spice was soft and delicate, as delicate as the milk chocolate they put into it. Simply Outstanding. Best Hot Chocolate I’ve Ever Had. Wickedly Bad Ass. Now I know what you’re thinking, that wasn’t a breakfast. And you’re right, we still hadn’t eaten yet, and it was almost 1:00pm; Lunch Time.

James
 
Think of what a cup of hot, melted, Hershey’s bar would taste like…that’s how rich this hot chocolate was. It was like drinking pure milk chocolate with a hint of hot tamale. Awesome for a cold New York morning, but it had me down to a t-shirt in minutes.
 
Grant
 
Jacques Torres is like the Starbucks of hot chocolate. They offer gourmet version of hot chocolate, with the fancy designer labeling and marketing printed over the packaging and cups that you would expect from this type of place. But I wasn’t impressed, if I were to do a taste test with Jacques Torres hot chocolate and Swiss Miss, I would not be able to tell a difference. Actually, I would be able to tell a difference, because the one that is served at a temperature too hot to be enjoyable would be the one that came from Jacques Torres. And to me, $4 for a cup of hot chocolate seems ridiculous.
 
Chris
 
This place was harder to find for us than it should have been. When we finally stumbled upon it, we discovered a massive chocolate factory, complete with several impressive looking machines that we could only guess their function. The atmosphere was really cool – part coffee/chocolate shop, divided by all glass walls so guests can watch the chocolate magic in action. Very cool. The hot chocolate itself was very thick and perfectly flavored, and had a touch of spice that was noticeable but not overwhelming. It was a little chilly outside, so this was a perfect start to the day. I liked it so much that I downed the whole thing and broke a sweat before we left.

All in all, this place is really cool, and if you are looking for anything (and I do mean ANYTHING) chocolate, this is the place to go. A very specialized shop with its heart covered in chocolate. I would most definitely stop by Jacques Torres again if I ever am in the city and have a hankering for something sweet and creamy.
 
Our stomachs lead us East across the island to Nicky’s Vietnamese Sandwiches , another spot on the show. During the “Between Bread” episode, both Aaron Sanchez and Anne Burrell showcased different sandwiches. And both, from the same place, Nicky’s. Had to eat it. Grant and James had Annes’ Classic Ba’hn Mi’, which was Vietnamese Ham and Roasted Ground Pork Sandwich. Chris and I went with Aarons’ Pork Chop Ba’hn Mi’. Both come on a Toasted Baguette laced with Pickled Carrots, Cucumber, Cilantro and Mayo, all for around 5 bucks.

The Viet Deli itself was no wider than the family room in my apartment, 10 feet at most, and maybe double that deep. Three two-seater tables, a beverage frig, and an order counter. Kitchen out back. Service was quick and thank god for that. After my first bite, all that went through my head was, “this is the freshest tasting sandwich I’ve ever had.” The carrots and cilantro were an amazing touch, I’m going to have to start doing that when I pack lunch for work. And with the cucumber, perfect texture to your mouth. Never having a vietnamese pork chop before, I could tell a massive difference from the american pork chop I’m used to having. Usually cooked until a soft white, this pork chop was heavily marinated and spiced. Not over done. Just right, perfect. And I would say it was definitely worthy of being on “The Best Thing I Ever Ate.” Thanks Aaron and Anne for the recommendation. Ba’hn Mi’ was beast. Lunch isn’t over yet though. We needed a side dish. Chips, but not chips.

James
 
This was the one disappointing place in my opinion. The sandwich, especially the vegetables, was amazingly fresh…but otherwise nothing special. No sauce, flavoring, ect to really stand out. Simply a really fresh sandwich.
 
Grant
 
Nicky’s Sub’s is a very small sandwich shop that makes fresh sandwiches that taste great. This is another place where local people go to pick up lunch during their lunch breaks on an average day, and you can taste why. In addition to tasting great, these sandwiches really are a good value. This is the type of thing that I could eat every day, and not get tired of it. The bread was soft, the vegetables were fresh, and the combination of sweet and tangy flavors combined perfectly for a great meal that I wish I could have every day.
 
Chris
 
While this wasn’t my favorite sandwich in the world, I must say that it was incredibly fresh and unique. It was very simple – seasoned pork, carrots, and fresh cilantro packed tight in an amazingly fresh hoagie-type bread. Nicky’s is a very very small place, with two tables shoved tightly against the wall so people can attempt to scoot by and make their order. There were only two employees – one taking orders&amp;helping the other prepare and cook the sandwiches. Both of them were very friendly and wanted to help us with anything we asked for.

As a side note, I enjoy a bit of spice in my Vietnamese food. At this particular location, I had a mishap with the Sriracha sauce, and it exploded all over my sandwich. So needless to say, I had my spice and then some. I broke a sweat for the second time in one morning just from food. Now that’s serious eating!
 
 Nate , a friend from back at college, just a day before we left posted on Facebook he’d be up in Manhattan on the same dates we were. As I walked outta Nicky’s he gave me a call on the cellular. Told him we had to make a stop real quick to finish lunch, but to meet us at this bar in Greenwich Village for the Virginia Tech @ Duke game in an hour or so.

Headed out on foot, we went through Nolita to the middle of Manhattan for a snack. Bobby Flay on the show went to Balthazar for French Fries. And like Aaron McCargo Jr. said “these wings are crunchy,” Bobby said “these fries are crunchy.” Yea, I know, all fries are crunchy. Once again those, these french fries are double fried if I remember correctly. They also ship in the potatoes from some special place, Idaho of course, russett potatoes.

Staring at the bold red awning out front, I forgot that Balthazar is an upscale french restaurant. Walking in and getting a table just for a basket of fries was not going to be an option. So I said, let’s go to the bar, I bet if we order a drink and wait around, we can order some through have the bartender. We came out of the rain, and decided to at least try. The interior is pretty darn classy. Had I dressed like Don Draper from Mad Men, woulda fit right in. Maybe picked up a model or two. The wine bottles behind the bar went all the way up the 20 foot tall wall and had collected dust to give it more of an antique look. Column Statues too. Service from the bartender was too awesome, really nice and didn’t ignore us for maybe wearing a triple 5 soul hoodie in such a nice place.

Chris went with a Bloody Mary while I looked of the beer list. I came across a Hefeweizen by Weihenstephen. Trumped Blue Moon as a dirty beer, and trying Chris’ Bloody Mary it was the best I’ve had. The place was absolutely packed with late lunch eaters, and in waiting 20 minutes, no one budged from the bar. But I was not going to leave without getting the rest of my lunch. I would of eaten the fries in the rain if I to, so I ordered take out. And…nowww there’s a seat available, great. They still came in a box ready to go, but you should see the real presentation of the frites in the photos. They are stacked high wrapped in thin white paper within a metal cylinder. Time to eat.

French Fries

Grant (4th Time)
 
Crunch. Yes sir, these were fries were crunchy. Not thick like five guys, and not like shoe string fries, but right in the middle. The thing about them is they have no seasoning except salt. No garlic fries, no old bay fries, just a really fresh and natural approach to a great fry. Take these hands down over most other fries. But if you’re not convinced, I was after dipping them in their homemade mayonnaise. Put it over the top. And I never dip my fries in mayo. More of a Ketchup guy, but the mayo was good and fatty. Nothing left to say, except that it was pouring outside and we had to go out in it.

James
 
The fries themselves can be rivaled by places with a drive-thru, need I say more?
 
Grant
 
The fries at Balthazar can be best be described as a standard order of fries. They were not bad, there was nothing wrong with them, and I would say that they were good in fact, but nothing special. There isn’t much else to say about them. To me, a great fry is well seasoned fry, but these were just your standard salted fry.
 
Chris
 
Bobby Flay tells us that these are the best fries he’s ever had, so naturally, we wanted to see for ourselves. Balthazar has an interesting, wide open French atmosphere, and was packed when we walked in. The four of us were soaked as it had suddenly begun raining on our way over. We sat at the bar, and one of the people next to us was sipping a delicious looking Bloody Mary, so I had to try one. We watched the bartender throw it together, and while it was very quick and simple, it was a fantastic drink and I would have had another if we had a place to sit. The fries came out in a large paper tube, and we all dove in at once. These fries in particular are double fried, so really had a perfect consistency all the way through, as well as a fantastic flavor. Here’s the thing – they were delicious. Don’t get me wrong. But, on a good day at McDonalds, you are coming pretty close to these fries. I didn’t really think they were the BEST fries I had ever tasted. Balthazar had quite an extensive menu, and I think that as a compliment to a lot of their dishes these fries would have been fantastic. But I am still up in the air as to whether I would make the trek all the way back just for the fries. Sorry Bobby!
 
We took cover underneath some scaffolding across the street since about 15 people were packed in the doorway of Balthazar. Chris and I had to catch the end of the Tech game, so we hailed a cab and went up to Greenwich Village to my favorite sports bar in the city; The Village Pour House. My brother-in-law Matt introduced me to this place a few years ago the week of Thanksgiving. I’ll be there this thanksgiving as well.

 The Village Pour House , so I’m told, is a huge Virginia Tech Alumni Bar. Well, the back bar at least. Matt and my sister starting dating while attending VT. I know they hold many other Universities there as well, but I don’t go for those football games, haha. If you’re a Tech fan and you’ve never been here, check it out. Lot of fun and the staff is great. Meredith, one of the bartenders, nice as can be, and also been there since it opened over two years she told me. Funny part was the Tech Duke game was on ESPN360, so they brought in a laptop, hitched it on the projector, and streamed it off the internet. Got to see ‘em 34–26 win. Nate’s ringing, met him outside where he shared that the previous he spent the night in his car, haha. After the game finished we cleared out with the rest of the crowd and brought Nate along with us.

Chris
 
The signature hangout for Virginia Tech grads and fans. We went to watch the game and had a great time. I even saw someone I knew from school – it never fails. The Pourhouse has a great atmosphere and the bartenders are very friendly.
 
Remember how I said Chris helped me by suggesting a few places? Next, he lead us over to one of the most famous streets in all of Manhattan, St. Mark’s Place. On the way, we saw that famous spinning cube sculpture named The Alamo, over on Astor Place. Couldn’t refuse spinning it at least once, ha. On to one of Chris’ favorite bars, Grassroots Tavern .

Straight out of an old western film, this bar is located on St. Mark’s Place, basement level. It was only 4:00pm, but the five of us wanted to see it. Completely empty. Saturday, bar empty? Never seen that before. However, I’m not knocking it. Actually a sweet hang out, and I could see why Chris used to frequent here. Rather than go to a packed over priced swanky nyc bar, bring your friends here for some good times. Oh, and for the free popcorn. I downed a few baskets. Only thing on the trip consumed that wasn’t planned out. Well, except for exactly 12 hours from now. Get to that later. No TV’s to distract you, just good conversation. The owners/bartenders were old school and kept the place clean. Told us a whole bunch about the Tavern, including how the cash register was from the 1940’s, and still in perfect working condition. Gotta go back on a lazy day.

James
 
I have to comment on this bar. Dive, no question. The bartender reminded me of Clint Eastwood from Gran Torino. He told us stories while I housed 2-3 baskets of free popcorn and drank beer that some guy I didn’t know bought for us.
 
Grant
 
Props to Chris for showing us the Grassroots bar. This place is amazing. The two men managing the bar were really cool, and took pride in letting us in on the history of the place. If I had to describe the place in one work, I would describe it with the word&quot;character&quot;. From the Civil War era bar top, to the 1940′s working cash registers, this place, to the people behind the bar, everything about this joint screams&quot;old school&quot;.
 
Chris
 
This used to be a favorite spot of mine and my friends when I used to live in New York. Quite a dive, but very unique, and has quite a bit of history. The bartenders made sure that we knew that. Very nice old guys but serious about the business. Don’t cross their path.
 
We had already had french fries just a few hours ago, but Chris lead us around the corner to Pommes Frites Frite Shop; he raved about the fries. Didn’t get any because I had bigger plans. The Bamn! Automat. I saw it on “Extreme Fast Food” on the Travel Channel. An automat is a fast food restaurant that is more like a vending machine, but food was served on real dishes with metal utensils, and drinks in glasses. Widely popular in the 1950’s. Bamn! opened back in 2006 and is the last automat in the U.S. Asking randoms on the street where it was, we learned it closed back in March. So now there’s zero left in the nation. Crap. Nate left us at this point to meet his friends two hours away on Long Island.

Around the corner was my next spot on the trip, Dessert before Dinner; Stand Burger. Here they make this milkshake, and on TV, the way Michael Simon described it just blew my mind. I was on edge all day waiting to try this; The Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake. Yea, just hearing the name makes you want it, and believe me, you do!

 Stand Burger . Obviously this place was known for it’s burgers, but we had to pass them up if we were gonna fit a 3 course dinner in a few hours later. Sitting at the bar and looking around, Stand Burger reminded me of that Steak N’ Shake type decor, however more modern. The boys and I all ordered the recommendation from Iron Chef Michael Simon, The Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake. It comes out in this tall old school malt glass, milk and ice cream filled to the top, and two enormous marshmallows on top of that practically hanging over the edge of the glass. First, the ice cream; the smoothest milkshake ever. I cannot stand it when I get a milkshake that’s so thick you can’t even drink it, forcing me to use a spoon. Chef’s, that is NOT a milkshake, that’s just ice cream in a glass! This milkshake, is a milkshake!

Now the ice cream itself. Freaking awesome. Straight up tastes like toasted marshmallow pureed right into the cream. You’ll love it. But the best part, the marshmallows on top. They place them in the ice cream and then torch them until they are perfectly golden brown on top. Hot and Cold, great combo. Take a sip, then pick up a marshmallow and pull in apart stretching the melting section until it break. Take a bit, die happy. This was, The Best Milkshake I’ve Ever Had, all thanks to that wonderful feeling of being a kid again around a campfire making smores. I could of easily pounded about 4 of them and been fine. 2 minutes a piece to finish. Money.

James
 
The picturesque toasted marshmallows sitting on top really skyrocket your expectations, but dive in and it tastes like a rather thin vanilla milkshake. Somehow I expected the whole thing to taste like marshmallows, but maybe I misunderstood what the name meant. That being said, I still could’ve drank 2 of them, it was a great vanilla milkshake.
 
Grant
 
Burger Stand serves a Toasted Marshmallow Milk Shake, and this thing is AWESOME. What a great Idea; take a classic camping treat, and turn it into a cool shake. Out of everything that we had, this was one of the best looking items that we had. I know a lot of food coinsures are big on“presentation”, and I am not usually sure how one judges that, but I will say that these shakes looked incredible. If you wanted to take a picture of them, you would have to fight of the temptation to just start digging in. I seriously want to buy one of these for each of my friends so they can taste this unique and incredible taste. This is a place that is worth traveling to try the shake.
 
Chris
 
Walking down the street, you can’t miss this place. There is a giant bull out front, painted with the American Flag. A perfect metaphor for what lies within – a great all-American meal. Now, we didn’t have the burgers at Stand, which I hear are fantastic. The place was very wide open, had a massive bar, with all sorts of beers on tap, and a very contemporary yet almost familiar burger joint feel to it. We sat at the bar and all ordered the toasted marshmallow shakes, and told the barkeep about our pilgrimage to try these things, along with many of the best foods on the east coast. He told us that this was not uncommon, and that quite a few people order only a shake. At first glance, these things were a work of art – a tall shake in a classic diner glass, with two perfectly browned marshmallows on the top. The flavor and the consistency of the shake was perfect to me, and was an amazing alternative to your typical chocolate or vanilla shake. The marshmallows somehow maintained the warm, gooey consistency, even on top of an ice cold milkshake. It was perfect! I highly recommend one of these to anyone looking for a unique dessert or afternoon treat.
 
Our next stop was actually way of the beaten path as far as being on a Food Road Trip, but Grant really wanted to do this, and it sounded cool to us. We flagged a cab and headed back down town to this fire station, 8 Hook&amp;Ladder. Unless you’re from New York, you probably don’t know what this is famous for, but it’s actually where they filmed all the station scenes from the Ghostbusters movies. Well, everything filmed outside with the Ghostbuster car dipping out and stuff, while all the scenes filmed inside were shot in another station in L.A. I enjoyed it. Check the photos. Grant even walked inside and filmed for a split sec, ha. After what seemed like the longest day ever, we were frickin’ beat, and we still had to hit dinner. Better head back and rest up for 10 minutes.

Resting up Chris’ phone keep blowing up with his friends, who still live in the city, asking us to meet them out for a drink before our last dinner is Manhattan. Which meant we had 30 minutes for us to all get ready. Suit Up Ted! It’s New York. If you’re not wearing a suit, you look outta place. No seriously. Anyways, after we scrambled around for a half hour and popped downstairs, the bellman grabbed us a cab. Chris lead the way once again. McSorley’s Old Ale House.

About 2 weeks before this trip, Chris and I were walking back to my place from Pho 75, next to Hell Burger. His anticipation for the trip really showed through his attitude. As we passed Four Courts Pub he started telling me about the oldest Bar in Manhattan. McSorley’s Old Ale House . Established 1854, and still standing. They serve two kinds of beer. McSorley’s Light, and McSorley’s Dark. Both very good, classic beer. The Mugs are tiny with handles, probably 3/4 a regular beer, and if you ask for 10 Lights and 10 Darks, believe me, the barkeep will pour it all and grip 10 mugs per hand and slam it down in front of ya. And don’t think you can go and just chill on some water b/c if other customers come in, they’ll give you the boot. Living by the rules of 1854. The decor even looks that way. They haven’t dusted the ceiling and the fixtures for almost a century it looks like. It’s not gross, it adds the old antique atmosphere of the place perfectly.

Go to the bar, order two Lights, and while your waiting, look up. See the wishbones hanging caked in dust? Amazing story. Chris shared it with me that day coming back from lunch. Time Period: World War I. A group of about 15 or so men were only a day away from being deployed to war. So they all went to their favorite bar, McSorley’s, for one last horray of good food and drinks all around. The Special that night? Fried Chicken. All the men ordered it, and when they finished, a pact was made. Everyone hang your wishbone on the chandelier, and when you return, come back to McSorley’s and take it down. Something to come home to, to look forward to. None of the men returned home. The wishbones still hang. Respect.

When we arrived to the bar, Chris’ friend, Jeff, and his fiance were waiting for us. Sidenote: They married about 3 weeks ago. Congrats! For the rest of us, we were just meeting for the first time. We were greeted with about 15 beers on the table, which was basically about a beer and a half a person really. Perfect amount considering we just went like 80 blocks south of my sister’s, and in 15 minutes we had to go back like 60 blocks back, so we were in a rush. No worries, we’d meet up with Jeff later on after dinner. Said our goodbye’s, and ran the hell outta there to make dinner, literally.

Grant
 
McSorley’s is the oldest bar in New York, and you can tell. It looks like a Wild West bar. They have two types of beer, light and dark, both McSorleys. The floors are covered in sawdust so you can just sweep the floor away every so often and it is good as new. Everyone in the place is lively and loud, this is a place where you go to have a good time, which is ironic, because if you start thinking about the chandelier and the meaning behind it, you would have the opposite type of feeling.
 
Chris
 
The oldest bar in all of Manhattan. I had been here a few times when I lived in the city, and we met up with a friend of mine before going to dinner at Gordon Ramsay at the London. Legend has it that an entire squad of WWI soldiers came to McSorley’s before going overseas to war, all ordered the whole chicken, and hung their wishbones on the chandelier when they were finished. To this day, those wishbones still hang there, and the soldiers never returned from the war. Talk about history!
 
Dinner, Times Square: Gordon Ramsay At The London . Yes, I’m a huge Gordon Ramsay fan due to all the reality shows he’s put out. I find ‘em hilarious. My mom even watches them now. And No, I’ve never had his food, and despite I know he won’t personally be cooking the dishes, didn’t matter to me, they are his recipes, had to still try‘em. When I made the reservation a week prior on the phone, the lady asked me if I wanted to Dine at Gordon Ramsay The Maze, or At The London. Had to go high class all the way, At The London please.

Arriving, I was slightly confused, I checked in, but the only check in desk was at The Maze. Where the finest of fine Gordon Ramsay dining? As they were escorting us to our table, I figured I messed up, and I had no problem with The Maze. But then, after walking through the entire maze, two massive doors, floor to ceiling opened in front of us, and we landed in London. Bam, that’s what I’m talking about. Nice round table almost center of the rectangular room. Wine bar glowing of blue backlit led’s. Fresh off-white’s mixed with shiny metal and glass. Definitely screamed Gordon Ramsay, the best of the best. Not a place for four dudes to dine together, more of an engagement dinner or anniversary place. And actually the couple across from us got engaged that night in the restaurant. Never witnessed that before. What’s with this trip and couples getting married? In a nutshell, the decor was nothing short of freakin’ brilliance. Gordon has a lot of pride and it shows. Sidenote: the pictures are all blurry and such because there wasn’t a lot of light, my camera is like 5 years old, and I didn’t “let the flash go” to show some respect for other patrons.

After we all ordered our courses, all three, we were presented with some bread. The waiter started listing off about 5 different kinds but I stopped listening after the first one; “Bacon and Rosemary.” Sauteed and baked right into the bread, need I say more. Sorry Gramercy, Gordon trumped you already, haha. Rosemary is be far my favorite herb with meat because it’s flavor has unparalleled strength, and when combined with bacon, soft bread, butter, and sea salt, Welcome to Flavor Country. A shot glass of mango puree and celery later, the first courses arrived.

My theory in ordering was to compare dishes to Gramercy, so for the first course I went with the King Fish. Never had it before, only heard of it once. Came out with evenly cut bite size pieces of king fish in a clock formation. If your plate was a clock, there was a piece of fish on every other hour marker. King fish, if you EVER see it on a menu, order it, no questions asked. If I was a chef on Hell’s Kitchen doing a blind taste test and Gordon gives me a spoon full of king fish. Without a doubt, I’d yell “Ham!” Gordon would have killed me, but I seriously thought I was eating ham, similar taste, similar texture. Blew me away. It came literally a point behind the trout in taste from the night before, however beat it for the originality factor. The King baby.

Next, I got the Veal. Best Veal I’ve Ever Had. And that is really saying something considering Veal has got to be in my top three favorite meats to eat. The menu read, “Fillet of Wisconsin Veal, Tramezzini Bread and Chilled Foie Gras, Périgord truffle vinaigrette”. My second foie gras of the trip. Take a wild guessed who’s won? Maybe I shoulddd name my first born Gordon. Only the initials would just make people refer to the first president ever and I’m not really political so that won’t work. Gordon won this round. The vinaigrette made from truffles from the Périgord region of France made this dish,…bar none. The texture of the bread to tender veal all dipped in truffle vinaigrette. Drowl.

Last dinner, means last dessert. Oven roasted spiced pineapple, crushed pumpkin seed madeleine, goat’s milk sorbet. Ordered it for the pineapple and the “goat’s milk” part since I had Goat’s Milk Cheesecake at Gramercy. I wish I ordered James’ Earl Grey soufflé though, once again he outdid me at desserts (like at Woodberry). Lightest soufflé ever. Can’t be beaten. My dessert, while the main ingredients were no where near complex, they are excelled as a whole. The delicate hot pineapple is the flavor boast to get your taste buds going at high heat, and then make sure you go for the sorbet being suffocated in madeleine crumbles after to cool off. Might not have have beaten Gramercy, but bravo none the least.

The building, restaurant, and small dining room oozed class. I decided on Surf&amp;Turf and paired the Scallops with the Filet. The Scallops were big, juice, and perfectly cooked. I don’t know why they provide a steak knife, because you can cut the Filet with your fork, it’s that tender. Having never eaten Soufflé I had to try it. It came out in a tall hot metal cylinder. The Earl Gray flavoring was unique and the soufflé was amazingly light and warm. The Scallops and Soufflé earn best I’ve ever eaten status.

The London is another place that someone that is a fan of fine dining would go to. The employees were a lot more serious and business like in their attitude then they were at Gramercy. I did think that the employees showed understanding and patients with us considering that our group was a bit wound up after coming from several different bars, and that I didn’t know a thing about French Cuisine. And I can say that the best tasting single item that I got on this trip came from The London, when they offered a Gourmet Vanilla Cotton Candy. What a great idea, take a favorite carnival food, and put a fancy and gourmet twist on it. It tasted great, I love the flavor of vanilla, and I love cotton candy, this was the first time I have hear of Vanilla cotton candy, and it tasted great. However the London is not a place that I would come back to, because Gramercy has them beat in almost every regard.

Upon arrival at the London, which is a beautiful hotel in midtown Manhattan, we were escorted through Gordon’s other restaurant at this location – Maze. It was in fact a maze, and when we finally reached our destination, we were led through two giant doors into what appeared to be an oversized private dining room, with a massive wine cooler in the back. I was very taken aback by the décor in this room – it was simple, yet the amount of class it exuded was almost intimidating. We were seated at a table in the middle of the room, and at first glance I felt as though we were outnumbered by service employees by at least 2-1. The first thing all of us noticed were that the chairs were padded leather, and were extremely comfortable. We all felt very important back here.

Starter – Spanish Mackerel
I am not sure if I had ever had a Spanish Mackerel dish before ordering this at Gordon’s restaurant. It was a very interesting flavor, and had a very deep “fishy” flavor to it – not in a bad way, but an intense flavor of the sea that I am not accustomed to. The skin was left on and was nice and crispy, and also had a great flavor to it. This fish was served in a bouillabaisse sauce, with a chorizo marmalade. I must say it was a very unique dish and I was impressed by the presentation and the boldness of the flavor. I don’t think it was my favorite dish, and don’t think I would order it again, but it was an experience I am very glad to have had.

Main Course – Boneless Rack of Lamb
This dish appears to have been removed from Gordon’s menu, which is a shame! The lamb was prepared perfectly – it was one of the best lamb dishes I’ve ever had. Simple, but amazing. It went very well with the Pinot Noir we had.

Dessert – Chocolate Cake
Again, I wanted to compare this cake to the Woodberry cake. Still not the same! It was of course delicious, but it didn’t have the same zip to it that the flourless cake at Woodberry Kitchen did. Another item that is no longer on the menu. Did I eat them out of all these items? Perhaps.

Overall, Gordon Ramsay at the London was a killer experience. I must say, however, that there was a certain attitude there that I could not put my finger on – suggesting that we didn’t really belong there. The wait staff was efficient, but not nearly as friendly as the staff in Gramercy the night before. One of our waitresses had a tough time speaking English, and that compounded with all the French cuisine she was trying to describe to us made it quite a confusing experience.
 
We all finished up. James, Chris, and I ordered some coffee, Grant went with some Cotton Candy off the cart, haha. We headed out and hit Times Square, since you can’t go to New York City on vacation and skip that place. Magicians, bootleggers, street performers, pick pockets, artists, Elmo, you name it, Time Squares’ got it. It was our last night after all, and the boys and I set out to make the best of it. 26th and 3rd Ave please.

We decided to go meet Jeff and bunch of other friends Chris knew over at this place called Vertigo . The weather was so nice it was practically out door seating, inside. Completely open. Grant, James, and I did the whole meet and greet thing, but we were just stalling here until the rest of the group arrived so me could head a couple blocks up to Vig27 . I enjoyed this place immensely. Nice lounge to go and have a drink. Outside I was hanging out and this guy starts talking to me asking me what I thought of the place, was I from outta town, etc etc. So I told him, it’s like being in D.C. but not too packed, not too light, easy access to the bar, great music (even played some Cobra SS), thought that was beast. Turned out he was the owner, haha. Good thing I liked the place! After a couple hours of living it up in NYC on our last night, we had to head back to my sister’s. I remember our cab driver was sitting indian style in his seat with one foot down, also moved his seat to slam up against the steering wheel. Bit scary, but damn that lil guy could drive.

Vig27 was a cool lounge that we found Saturday night. The thing that made it cool was that they had tables set up, that you didn’t need to reserve to sit at, the music they played was great, and they played it loud, but not so loud that you couldn’t talk to a group of people without yelling. It was ligit lounge, that you would actually feel relaxed to hang out at. If there was a place like this near me, I would be at it all the time.

Vertigo. A great time – we just met up with some friends to kick off the night after our glorious dinner at Gordon’s restaurant. We weren’t here for long, as it was just a meeting point, but with all the walls open to the streets outside it was a pretty cool site to see.

Vig27. This was more of a club. Loud music, but somehow we still felt on top of the world after eating with Gordon. We came here to hang out after Vertigo, and just relaxed, still being full of some fantastic French food and wine. It was great to see my friends from New York.
 
I’m sorry, but when I got back, I just keep thinking about all the food I had on this trip. Truly amazing looking all the way back to Hell Burger and Woodberry Kitchen, mmmm.

 I couldn’t fall asleep, so the night just kept going…
