 Fried Chicken = High Carb Count?
 I&apos;ve searched a few sources and it seems as though Fried Chicken Thighs have high carb counts?

Where are these carbs coming from?

Chicken thighs, seasoned with Salt&amp;Pepper and deep fried?

(from another forum)
Fried chicken drumsticks or thighs
2 pieces (about 5 1/4 oz.)
15.7 g

 Re: Fried Chicken = High Carb Count?
 If you&apos;re using a site like Fitday, they&apos;re assuming the chicken is breaded or dusted with flour, which is where the carbs are coming from.

Why don&apos;t you just look up the carbs counts for the chicken, salt and pepper? That&apos;s what the carb count will be!

Thanks!

 Re: Fried Chicken = High Carb Count?
 A low carb forum lists carb counts?
Can you elaborate?
Or was it a person on a low carb forum posting a carb count?

 &quot;Doing Atkins, you&apos;ll find that you&apos;re cleaning out a lot of metabolic garbage from your life, in addition to excess pounds and junk food. Many of my patients have discovered that instead of a weight loss program,this is for them a rejuvenation program.&quot;

15.7 g those are number from carb counts all over the net. That is carb counts from breaded chicken bought at a fast food restaurant. And yes breaded chicken from fast food restauratns will have that many carbs.
