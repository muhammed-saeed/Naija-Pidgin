 Healthy Fast Food Options 
 Posted in Your Biggest Supporter Is YOU! Apr 04 
Happy humpy day! It is almost impossible to end the use of fast food chains. Impossible I say, but you can enjoy it and still be healthy and/or lose. Really, you can.

There are more than 140,000 fast food restaurants with more popping up daily. It’s quite easy to see how one of every five Americans eat from a fast food restaurant daily, especially with our“on the go”society.

How do you remedy that? Planning ahead 

When that is not possible, because“life”happens use these helpful tools:

-The fast food chain that you frequent the most, learn about it. Look up the nutritional facts of your food choice. Become familiar with your food.

-Try to avoid deep fried options like French fries, chicken, etc., that golden oil is a bad combination once it meets the breading.

-Do no select to supersize, upgrade, to add anything. Keep it simple. Too much greasy goodness, means too much fuel for the body to process. Meal time will come around again.

-Limit sugar intake. Keep in mind all beverages have calories. There are some diets drinks without calories. But why drink your calories if you are eating them too? Ice creams, pies, shakes, and cake are obvious avoidable due to sugar content. Be wise. (personal accountability)

-Balance your small meals, condiments and, food choices. Mayo, cheese,“special sauces”, butter, sour creams, usually have a high fat content. Try to develop a taste for mustard and ketchup. When possible, swap the fries for fruit, baked potato, or side salad with balsamic or low fat dressing.

Bigger is not better, select wisely. Meal time happens several times during the day.
