When you have determined the correct grease hood, view the product page for recommended add-on items to customize that specific model to your kitchen equipment and local code requirements.
 Do you require a restaurant or concession grease hood manufactured to your local code?
Order a grease or heat hood customized to your specifications. Tips from the Experts: 
There are several types of exhaust hoods that you can choose from, depending on your particular needs. In a restaurant setting, the vent hood is designed to be the entry to the commercial kitchen aeration system.
Before purchasing a hood for your restaurant, consider that the national fire code states that you have to have 6&quot; of overhang on EITHER side of the equipment, so 6 feet of equipment requires a 7 foot hood, 7 feet of equipment requires an 8&apos; hood, etc. etc. You should also check with your local municipality for local codes and ordinances. -Josh
