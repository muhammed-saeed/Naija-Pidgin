Fast Food has hit a bit of a problem as Americans are realizing they need to cut weight. Fast Food restaurants are quickly realizing there juicy greasy dripping food that&apos;s so cheap and fast to make is exactly what more and more people are shying away from. Since that fat food is pretty much the core of a fast food restaurants business model they realized they need to adopt to the trend of slimming down.
 


Most of the Major fast food restaurants are now offering salads in their menus, for people on diets or those of us who just want to eat healthy. It seems like the Salad is the new hip thing in fast food restaurants for people looking to eat healthy. McDonalds, Wendys, Burger King the three big chains will all of salads and some other healthy meals.

More specialized fast food restaurants such as In-N-Out Burger and Five Guys have a very limited menu which some would argue is why they have the best burgers. But because of their limited menu these specialty fast food restaurants are not offering salads due to their limited menus.

But there are tricks to eating healthy at fast food restaurants that are not widely known and if you know the Wendy&apos;s substitution trick then Wendy&apos;s is the healthiest. Wendys offers substitutions for there meals so for instance if you order a chicken sandwich combo you normally get a chicken sandwich a soda and fries. If you have ever watched the documentary, &quot;Super Size Me&quot; you will know that the fries are one of the most unhealthy part of fast food. At Wendys if you ask when you order you can substitute out your fries for a salad instead making your meal much healthier.

The next big killer at fast food restaurants for eating unhealthy is soda. Almost every fast food chain offers a soda fountain and a lot have free refills. If you do get a soda, don&apos;t kill yourself with the free refills limit yourself to one drink (the cups are large). There usually is also an option at fast food restaurants for a non-soda beverage. Almost all have water which would definitely be the healthiest but most may not want it cause it really doesn&apos;t taste like much, but if you want to eat healthy go for the water. If water is to bland for you yet you still would like to eat healthy most soda fountains have a fruit juice drink, lemonade, or ice tea and these would be your next best drinks after water and are much healthier then soda.

If your looking to eat healthy fast food restaurants are normally not your best bet since healthy food is usually more money and fast food restaurants are usually all about fast cheap food. But if you know your fast food eating tips you can go into a fast food restaurant confident that you do not have to eat unhealthy.
