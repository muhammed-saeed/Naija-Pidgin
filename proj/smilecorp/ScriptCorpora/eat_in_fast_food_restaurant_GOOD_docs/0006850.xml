 New Diet Craze: I Gross You Out So Much That You Quit Eating Crappy, Disgusting Fast Food! 
 Apr 16 
 

We’ve all heard the horror stories about gross, nasty things found in the food at some of the most popular fast food joints in the world – fried mice, hair, severed finger in chili, condoms, chemicals, and many more – some are actually myths, but many of them are 100% true! I figured I’d take advantage of these disgusting tales of food filth, and introduce my new “Grossed Out Food Diet”! Ok…So, it’s not a real diet, but at least it may help to persuade you from eating these unhealthy fast food choices next time you get a craving.

These are a list of food horror stories that have either been verified to be true, or at least had a lawsuit filed against the restaurant by the victim, so prepare to be grossed out! Next time you get a craving for some McDonalds, KFC, Taco Bell, or Burger King, just remember this post and proceed with caution! 

1. In 1995 a man in Alabama was dining at McDonalds when he found a condom in his burger. No word on whether it was a used condom or not, but does it really matter?!?

2. An Ohio man found skin, apparently from part of a thumb, in his sandwich at Arbys back in 2004.

3. In 2003 a man was enjoying a three-piece combo from Popeye’s Chicken, and as he took a bite out of his chicken, he noticed that a mouse had apparently lodged itself between the skin and the meat of the chicken. This restaurant had been cited for rodent infestations in the past – why wasn’t this place shutdown!

4. Clam chowder gone bad! A woman eating a bowl of clam chowder in 2002 at a McCormick and Smicks’s seafood restaurant in Southern California found a condom in her chowder, which she originally mistook for calamari, but soon after noticed that it was something else rubbery. She sued the restaurant and won an undisclosed settlement amount.

5. Employees at an Oregon Jack in the Box decided to “amuse themselves” one day by adding a variety of disgusting things to customers’burgers, including acid, soap, phlegm, hair, and staples.

6. In 2000 a woman purchased a box of chicken wings at a local McDonalds only to find that one of the chicken pieces was actually a chicken’s head! FYI: Deep fried chicken head is not on the McDonalds menu.

7. A firefighter in Virginia Beach found two used bandages in his quarter pounder from McDonalds. I imagine that this happens more often than most people think.

8. A man in Tennessee allegedly bit down on a hypodermic needle while eating a Big Mac from McDonalds (this one is not confirmed to be true, but it’s scary to think about nonetheless).

9. A 50-year-old man in Houston contracted a disease called cysticercosis caused by employees using poor hygiene, such as not washing their hands after going to the bathroom, at a local restaurant. His food was contaminated with tapeworm eggs which nearly killed him. The tapeworm larvae spread to his brain and caused him to pass out and not wake up for eight days. Apparently, he was the fourth patient treated for the disease in that area within the past few months back in 2007.

10. Check out this disgusting Burger King in Florida that just leaves their hamburger buns outside for the pigeons to eat! 

11. A 2003/2004 study conducted in Durban, South Africa (a popular tourist town) concluded that 20,000 food outlets, including popular fast food joints, in the area inspected by the City Health Department failed to meet minimum health requirements. Health officials found hair, insects, cigarettes, weevils and fingernails in the food at these places. Senior official at the City Health Department, Umar Singh, said “We have found foreign objects coming into contact with food, including insects, weevils and cockroaches. We have also found unsanitary conditions, the smoking of tobacco products, defective fume-extraction units and a lack of protective clothing for the staff.”

12. A 2009 video shows an employee at Dominos doing some very disgusting things to a couple of sub sandwiches. Needless to say, the employee was immediately fired after the big-wigs at Domino’s saw the video on the Internet. Click here for the disgusting Dominos video .

“2. An Ohio man found skin, apparently from part of a thumb, in his sandwich at Arbys back in 2004.”

REALLY? Did he find any other body parts in there?? Like, maybe a leg or some chest muscle? Maybe something taken from a corpse’s thigh? I WOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED THAT THERE WERE DEAD THINGS IN MY ARBY’S SANDWICH.

Carnists never cease to amaze me. Bravo, you beautiful idiots.
 
 Lisa April 27, 2010 

I don’t eat fast food very often, but I think it’s safe to say that I can live without it!!
 
 Cough Hermanburger April 29, 2010 

I like how you put Burger King up there in the picture next to loads of disgusting stuff–yet Burger King is the most tame on the list.
As for McDonalds, I’m not surprised this stuff is turning up in their“food”–it’s all probably part of the recipe. McDonalds have been serving barf since they were established and anyone who eats there deserves all they get.
 
 Fellow Veggie, However... May 6, 2010 

Narf, there is a big jump from eating domesticated animal meat raised for consumption and inadvertently becoming a cannibal, k?

I don’t eat meat, but I wouldn’t want my meat consuming friends and family members to discover friggin’slices of a human thumb in their Arby-que.

Actually, I take that back. My husband can discover human thumb slices, given that the cheque settlement is big enough.

I am glad I went vegan two years ago, I worked at KFC for 4 years in australia and its fair to say we violated alot of OH&amp;S
 
 Renee June 23, 2010 

I ordered a diet coke from my local McDonald’s. I was halfway thru it when I took a sip and felt something come thru the straw and into my mouth…I took it out of my mouth and it was a WORM!!!!! SOOOOOOO disgusting! It has totally driven me away from ANY fast food or even restaurant food!
 
 chevelle July 3, 2010 

Wow and I thought I was only dreaming of this stuff
 
 Ceej July 3, 2010 

Burger King is the most tame?? Are you having a laugh? Now im from the uk and in their kitchens staff were able to smoke up until we had the smoking ban come in last year…i used to work at one of these restaurants, and also worked in a hotel’s kitchen when i was younger, and i saw first hand that actually the fast food restaurant’s kitchen was cleaner and had better food hygiene practices in than a 4* hotel’s kitchen.
 
 ranggaw0636 July 8, 2010 

eywww, wonder who the owner of the thumb skin
 
 Sims July 27, 2010 

I swear, you and your propaganda! No one is going to stop eating fast food just because you say so. Just stop pushing your beliefs down others throats, but apparently it worked because they are all believing you like sheep. Yes, fast food is unhealthy, but people eat it all the time. Let me think: If there was nothing in your house to eat, you were poor and you couldn’t buy groceries, there was nothing in your house except a piece of dust, and between two choices, McDonalds or dust, what would you choose?? Dust?? And theses stories may be true, but this stuff is rare. Just don’t eat fast food all the time, you’ll be okay.
Oh, and just because people eat meat, that DOES NOT mean they are IDIOTS. geez, people these days. *rolls eyes*

 Big_Foot: I wear a size 13 in womens shoes and i am a girl! January 25, 2011 

I am doing a research paper on fast food restraunts and the secrets about their food. I loved this article, well not like to eat it, but other than that its good info and i was wondering if i could use it as a source?

I also have a story…
i was in Florida and we were eating at an Arby’s and the roast beef sandwiches tasted really funky, and the meat was green. But my dad forced me to finish, and when we got in the car to head to our hotel, i started puking to to food poisioning because the meat had been LEFT OVERS from a week ago. My whole family got sick from it and it ruined our vacation.

 Mike April 25, 2011 

This post has to be the dumbest collection of urban legends around.

Let me tell you something kiddies: Ive eaten in more fine restaurants than you can count–and believe me: There is worse shit going on in many of these places–and im not talking about playing pranks on customers but using food that went bad, sweat, spit, rotten and dirty food.

Pretty much every place you eat will have things like that happening every once in a while–a stressed cook might wipe his sweat away and then touch your food, others might have a runny nose or sneeze, some use food that went bad and spice it up to seem tasty and others may drop your food and pick it up again–jesus christ you may think! But hey, thats just the way it is–it isnt gonna kill anyone and the food will probably still taste good. Never wonder of what might have happened–just enjoy it for christs sake! Cooks are humans, and food suppliers are humans–and humans make mistakes. thats just the way it is–live with it. There are children around the world drinking from puddles of mud and eating freakin roadkill and trash–be happy that you have the possibility to eat cheap and anytime. Its a luxury not a problem!
 
 OMG!!!!!!!! June 8, 2011 

This is totally disgusting (but I bet half those guys who have commented that they work in those places are lying) 
 
 Yoa-chan June 14, 2011 

Okay, this is kinda funny, some things on the list might be true, but some stuff is also blown up or completely thought up. I agree with people saying that the thing with the thumbskin is utter bull. OH NO, a tiny piece of human being got into my burger! oohhh, we dont care a whole cow died for your damn burger, a life was taken away. But the moment someone even hints to eating tiny bits of human, its gross. In all honesty, if i had to choose to eat a human or an endangered species for instance, i would choose the human. Theres way to many of those anyway. Putting that aside, the human probably barely noticed and i’d be more scared of what they touched before that piece of skin came off…
Other than that i also know that good, firstclass restaurants do just as bad, probably even worse stuff. When i worked in a restaurant as a simple helper/diswasher i frequently saw the cook smoking a sigar while cutting up the meat, other girls just smoking in my kitchen and i had to give half-rotten food to the cook so he could use it quickly…I even had people just putting out their cigarettes in my dishwater -.-. So yeah, this kinda stuff happens everywhere. I find the story with the condom in the clamchowder friggin funny though :p . Silly mistake made, lets just hope it wasnt used.

When my husband was young he worked in a restaurant called Sweeden House, he had a very large cookie sheet of meatballs just cooked for sweedish meatballs, he dropped the whole pan on the dirty floor by (slipping on the floor), the manager made sweep them up with a broom using a dust pan and put them into the pot of gravy and they were served to the old folks from a community called Century Village in WPB, Fl this was in the late 70′s.
 
 Liz August 1, 2011 

And not just disgusting things, too. Stupid actions, as well, occur with food from fast food. I’ve had a Jack in the box, when I asked them for a plain burger, just give me a burger patty and nothing else. A burger king, when my dad asked for a burger with ketchup only, gave him two buns with ketchup and nothing else.
 
 JustForThisMoment August 6, 2011 

I work in a McDonalds and I just want to clear some stuff up.
Firstly, we are required to wash our hands at the very least every hour on front counter (every 30mins in kitchen)but we mostly do it more often. If you sneeze or spill sauce or clean something you have to go wash your hands. You also have to wash your hands everytime you go get a drink, fix your hair/cap/hairnet, or go to the bathroom.
Secondly, if you cut yourself or are wearing a plaster you are made to put a neon blue one on so you can see it very easily if it drops into food.
Food in binned after a certain amount of time so you never get“old”food.
The only experience I’ve had there with out of date food is when someone can’t be bothered to bin apple pies on the late shift. (The people who are first in in the morning double checked it though and noticed and they were binned immediately).

About a week ago I purchased a sandwich from Arby’s. I brought the sandwich home (I was alone) and began eating it. I too a bite and swallowed it and it felt like an explotion in my throat by my windpipe. Well, needless to say I was choking to death! I could get no air and could not even get to the phone to dial 911 or get to the door to get help. I finally performed the Heimlich maneuver on myself 3 times and finally a huge amount flew out of my mouth and the rest I swallowed. Well, when I looked at the part that flew out there were MACHINE PARTS in my sandwich! I immediately called Arby’s and they instructed me to go to the hospital immediately. I was scared to death. I thought maybe I had swallowed metal and would need emergency surgery. Being a single mother with no family around scared me terribly! Well, the hospital kept me for hours,did testing and finally released me. They counseled me and told me I would have a melt down due to the fact I came so close to death. Well, all I can tell you is my life has not been the same since it happened. I wake up shaking and soaked in sweat. I think horrible thoughts of what if….all of buying a sandwich!

Great items from you, man. I have be aware your stuff prior to and you are simply extremely great. I actually like what you’ve obtained right here, certainly like what you are stating and the best way wherein you assert it. You are making it entertaining and you continue to take care of to stay it smart. I can’t wait to learn far more from you. That is actually a wonderful website.
 
 stacie February 2, 2012 

never eatin at fast food places again yak xx
 
 worker February 22, 2012 

Yea, I worked at a Taco Bell for a little over a year and a half and its not just a free for all. You have to always wear gloves, food gets time marked, wash hands constantly, all that good stuff. Maybe the worse thing that has happened is dropping a wrapped taco on the floor and picking it back up. If people are spitting and puttting crap in the food, you just need better managers that’s all!!

&amp;&amp;I’m gonna have to say some of those“stories”seem like total B.S.

BTW: the person up there talking about cannibalism, gross!!!
