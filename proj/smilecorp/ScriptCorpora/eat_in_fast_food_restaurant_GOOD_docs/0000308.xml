 where to get a job at 15 
 
When you are 15 and start looking for work its a sign that you have grown up and start to think about the future

to my own personal experience these are  things you need to know when looking for a job at 15:

t depends on where you live. but generally :

 Babysitting. 

 Bagging or stocking job at a local grocery store. Many grocers will hire baggers that are 15. 

 They might be a little too young for a job but they might be able to work at a fast food restaurant (e.g. McDonald’s or Chick-Fil-A). 

 If you are able to work and do not want to work at fast food restaurants, try motels, daycares and lawn services in your phone book. 

 Go to a neighbors house and ask if you can help around the house if you do a good job they will recommend you with friends but be courteous and friendly at all times! 

 A little ice cream place. 

 I know that a son of a friend of mine, that was your age (15), put an ad in the little nickel paper (weekly ads) expressing his interest in earning monies. He received several responses from the ad. 

 Try looking at a simple, independent local store rather than a chain. When you turn 16 you will at least have some experience which is good. 

 A farm. 

 If you know computers you could try programming or being a Web developer, or you could do data processing. 

 I got a job in a pub in the kitchen when i was 14, washing up and things. Don’t be scared to ask it doesn’t get you anywhere! 

 Go to your school counselor and talk to them about a job your given application and you will receive back your choice of jobs
