What could be better than information about Restaurants in Greenville SC?  Welcome to Greenville SC Dining.

I have news to share with you from Greenville SC, as well as some updates from the SC Hospitality Association , SC DHEC Food Safety , and the National Restaurant Association . I am a connoisseur of fine foods, whether it’s seafood restaurants in Greenville SC , romantic restaurants in Greenville SC , or a German restaurant in Greenville SC . That’s why I wanted to share with you some key information to make your dining experience memorable with Greenville SC Dining .

 Have you noticed all the different restaurants in Greenville SC? I mean REALLY noticed? How fortunate we are to have so many different cuisines to choose from. Main Street Greenville and South Main Street Greenville are not the only places to find good food these days. Just the other day I was over on Woodruff Road Greenville and I discovered the neatest little out-of-the-way bistro. I’d never been there before, and my casual dining experience was unforgettable. I even had a small glass of Sangria wine
while I was there. It’s definitely a place I will visit again.

Wade Hampton Blvd. Greenville is loaded with great places to eat. If you’re looking for an elegant comfortable atmosphere, you can find it there. Greenville SC restaurants offer award winning entrees, whether it’s pancakes for breakfast, pizza from a brick oven, authentic Mexican restaurants or modern American food.

White Horse Greenville. Orchard Park Greenville is another hot destination for soothing your palate.

Some family members of ours flew into Greenville-Spartanburg Airport last week, so we stopped for brunch in downtown Greenville on the way home. We found a quiet little cafe and had a delicious combination of breakfast and lunch goodies in a welcoming dining room. The atmosphere was pleasing and our food was cooked to perfection. We had a gourmet feast fit for a king! We definitely will go back to eat some more of their great food soon! The friendly restaurants in Greenville SC downtown
area offer great service and a surprising array of cuisine.

Poinsett Hwy Greenville and Broad Street Greenville are two more destinations for fine food, whether it’s an American steak, the best beef you ever tasted, burgers, Chinese, fresh fish, fresh pasta, International, or Italian cuisine. In fact, my husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary last week and he surprised me with dinner at my favorite Japanese restaurant. To try and give you descriptions of everything on the buffet bars would be impossible since it’s such an extensive menu, but restaurants
in Greenville SC know how to lay out a feast! I ate way too much and even topped it off with some samplings of three or four of their desserts. It was close to an ethereal experience!

When our daughter comes home from college, her favorite restaurant is a popular Italian restaurant just around the corner from where we live. She likes the chandelier in the middle of the dining room, especially when the lighting is low and the atmosphere is homey. She has a favorite table, and when we make reservations we always ask for that table. The nice part about our dining experience there is that the food is good!

No matter which zip code you live in, whether it’s 29601 or 29607, there’s a restaurant in your area that will become your favorite. Some of them have meeting event rooms available for your meetings or for your family reunions. Private events meetings are nothing unusual, and most of the larger restaurants have rooms set aside to accommodate your needs. You can order off the menu, or you can ask the restaurant to set up a buffet bar for you and your group. The best fine dining Greenville SC has to offer isn’t necessarily always listed on a dining guide brochure, so that’s why I’ve done the research for you here on this website, Greenville SC Dining .

Greenville SC restaurants also offer catering services if you’re planning a big get together and don’t have time to or don’t want to cook the meal yourself.

The best restaurants in Greenville SC usually offer this service, so check with them if you don’t see it posted inside.

There’s a small pizzeria near Reedy River that has the best pizza and pasta dishes I’ve ever put in my mouth. I’ve watched their chef cook the pizza, and he’s a perfectionist. The crust always turns out perfect, and the ingredients are layered just right. I invited a friend of mine from Facebook to join me for a pizza after attending an event at the Palmetto Expo Center, and she agreed with me that it was the best she’d ever eaten. She usually only eats southern soul food, but she did like the pizza.

Greenville SC Dining offers many different styles of restaurants in Greenville SC

Casual Style

A casual dining restaurant is a restaurant that serves moderately-priced food in a casual atmosphere. Except for buffet -style restaurants, casual dining restaurants typically provide table service . Casual dining comprises a market segment between fast food establishments and fine dining restaurants. [1] 

Casual dining restaurants usually have a full bar with separate bar staff, a larger beer menu and a limited wine menu. They are frequently, but not necessarily, part of a wider chain, particularly in the United States.

Entrepreneur Norman Brinker was the“father”of casual dining. [2] 

Family style

 Family style restaurants are restaurants that have a fixed menu and fixed price, usually with diners seated at a communal table such as on bench seats. True to their name, these restaurants tend to be single-family businesses .

Fast food
 See also: List of fast food restaurants 
 Fast food restaurants emphasize speed of service. Operations range from small-scale street vendors with carts to franchised mega-corporations like McDonald’s .

 Fast casual restaurants do not offer table service, but may offer non-disposable plates and cutlery. The quality of food, and price point, are higher than those of a conventional fast food restaurant.

Fine dining

 Fine dining restaurants are full service restaurants with specific dedicated meal courses. Décor of such restaurants feature higher quality materials with an eye towards the“atmosphere”desired by the restaurateur. The wait staff is usually highly trained and often wears more formal attire. Fine-dining restaurants are almost always small businesses and are generally either single-location operations or have just a few locations. Food portions are smaller but more visually appealing. Fine dining restaurants have certain rules of dining which must be followed by visitors. [3] 

Variations

Most of these establishments can be considered subtypes of fast casual dining restaurants or casual dining restaurants.

Bistro and brasserie

In France , a brasserie is a café doubling as a restaurant and serving single dishes and other meals in a relaxed setting. A bistro is a familiar name for a café serving moderately priced simple meals in an unpretentious setting, especially in Paris ; bistros have become increasingly popular with tourists. When used in English , the term bistro usually indicates either a fast casual dining restaurant with a European-influenced menu or a cafés with a larger menu of food.

Buffet and smörgåsbord

 Buffets and smörgåsbord offer patrons a selection of food at a fixed price. Food is served on trays around bars, from which customers with plates serve themselves. The selection can be modest or very extensive, with the more elaborate menus divided into categories such as salad, soup, appetizers, hot entrées, cold entrées, and dessert and fruit. Often the range of cuisine can be eclectic, while other restaurants focus on a specific type, such as home-cooking, Chinese, Indian, or Swedish. The role of the waiter or waitress in this case is relegated to removal of finished plates, and sometimes the ordering and refill of drinks.

In the United States , Buffets, Inc. , is a large buffet chain corporation which owns Old Country Buffet , Country Buffet, and HomeTown Buffet . HomeTown Buffet popularized the“scatter buffet”, which refers to the layout of separate food pavilions. Other American restaurant chains well-known for their buffets include Golden Corral , which features food products presented in pans, Souplantation /Sweet Tomatoes (known in particular for its soups and salads), Gatti’s Pizza , CiCi’s Pizza , Fresh Choice (a smaller competitor of Souplantation), Pancho’s Mexican Buffet , Ryan’s and Ponderosa Steakhouse . Sizzler is another prominent restaurant offering a buffet.

Café

 Cafés and coffee shops are informal restaurants offering a range of hot meals and made-to-order sandwiches. Many cafés are open for breakfast and serve full hot breakfasts. In some areas cafés offer outdoor seating. The major difference with a café and most other casual dining establishments is how the guest orders and pays. A café can offer table service, but many times the guest orders at the front, and the food is brought out to the table. Then, while at most casual dining restaurants the guest pays with the server, at a café the guest most often times pays with a single cashier.

Cafeteria

A cafeteria is a restaurant serving ready-cooked food arranged behind a food-serving counter. There is little or no table service. Typically, a patron takes a tray and pushes it along a track in front of the counter. Depending on the establishment, servings may be ordered from attendants, selected as ready-made portions already on plates, or self-serve their own portions.

In the UK, a cafeteria may also offer a large selection of hot food similar to the American fast casual restaurant , and the use of the term cafeteria is deprecated in favour of self-service restaurant .

Coffeehouse
 See also: Tea house 
 Coffeehouses are casual restaurants without table service that emphasize coffee and other beverages; typically a limited selection of cold foods such as pastries and perhaps sandwiches are offered as well. Their distinguishing feature is that they allow patrons to relax and socialize on their premises for long periods of time without pressure to leave promptly after eating, and are thus frequently chosen as sites for meetings.

Destination restaurant

A destination restaurant is one that has a strong enough appeal to draw customers from beyond its community. [4]
