Burger King Complaint–Fast Food With Cardboard and Managers That Don’t Care About The Customer
 By robertsonnr 
 




I went to my local Burger King on Friday, Sept. 24 here in Silver City, NM.  I had a craving for a fish sandwich so I decided to go through the drive thru at BK.  When I drove up to the menu to place my order, I had to wait a few minutes before someone came over the speaker.  When I had passed the side windows, I noticed that there was nobody inside, so there was no reason for them to serve me right away.

When I finally got asked what I wanted to order, the guy was absolutely rude to me!  I couldn’t believe my eyes–He rudely said,“what do you want!”and on top of that I had to keep repeating myself because he couldn’t understand what I said to him.  It was as if I was from Mars. When I finally got done with placing my order, I was really excited to get my food because I was so starving by then.

When I got my BK fish sandwiches, they both contained pieces of cardboard with the fish crust stuck on them and you could tell they had the fried grease soaked on them. These sandwiches were not edible and gross! I assumed the store manager would have been interested in the matter.

I called the store and asked to speak to the manager and was told he was too busy to come to the phone–can you believe that? I got disgusting sandwiches that no one could eat and he didn’t care at all! I could not believe this was actually happening at Burger King of all places!

I told the worker my find, left my name and number and guess what? No one at all returned my call! No one there cared in the slightest! When no one returned my call, I called back. The manager once again was not interested.  Bad news. He could have at least said sorry. So much for paying almost $8.00 for two cardboard sandwiches. Silver City, New Mexico Burger King–no wonder you do not have much business. You serve disgusting food and don’t care at all about your customers!

I will not return to any Burger King restaurant anywhere because of this horrible service I experienced and the lack of care and concern from the store manager.  Burger King needs to look long and hard into whom they allow owning franchises and whom manages their stores.  I can’t believe that the owner hasn’t fired this manager!!

One Response to Burger King Complaint–Fast Food With Cardboard and Managers That Don’t Care About The Customer

Burger King is gross with a capital G. I ate their once and had pieces of rubber gloves in my burger and I will never eat there again after that. BK gives me the creeps.
