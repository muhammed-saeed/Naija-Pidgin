 close to Chicago&apos;s downtown. Originally known as the 
 Municipal Pier nr 2, it is one of two piers called for 
 in Daniel Burnham&apos;s 1909 Chicago plan. The other pier 
 was never built. Construction Construction 
 started May 1914 and in 1916 it was opened to the public. Navy Pier Entrance to Dock Street At the time it was the world&apos;s largest pier, 292 ft 
 wide and 3000ft long (89m x 914m).

The 
 pier was designed as a shipping and entertainment area. 
 In its first decade, the Municipal Pier was successfully 
 attracting both visitors and ships. It was also temporarily 
 used as a military facility during the first world war. 
 Decline By the end of the 1920s, the Navy Pier&apos;s success started 
 to decline. The introduction of cars and the opening 
 of movie theaters created more competition for the Pier and the number of visitors dwindled. 
 Shipping started to decline in the 1930s due to the 
 Great Depression and the competition of transportation by 
 trucks. 
 Navy Pier In 1927 the pier was renamed Navy Pier in honor of World 
 War I veterans. It would turn out to be a prophetic 
 name change, as the Navy Pier Navy Pier seen from
John Hancock Center served as a naval training 
 facility during the second World War. After the war 
 it served as the Chicago branch of the University 
 of Illinois. In 1965 the university moved to its new 
 location and the Navy Pier started to decay. 
 Redevelopment The first step in the redevelopment of the Navy Pier was 
 the 1976 restoration by Jerome R. Butler, Jr. of the 
 Auditorium building at the eastern end of the pier. 
 One year later it was designated a Chicago Landmark. 
 Another step to the redevelopment of the Navy Pier was 
 taken in 1989, when the city of Chicago and the State 
 of Illinois installed the Metropolitan Pier&amp;Exposition 
 Authority, an organisation responsible for the management of the pier.
At the same time they committed 150 million 
 dollar for reconversion of the pier as a recreational 
 center. The renovation by Benjamin Thompson&amp;associates 
 started in 1992 and was completed in 1994. Beer Garden The result 
 is a very successful recreational center next to Chicago&apos;s 
 downtown area. Thanks to its many attractions and 50 acres of 
 parks and gardens (20 ha) it attracts more than 8 million visitors each year. 
 Headhouse&amp;Auditorium The two major buildings on the Navy Pier, Headhouse and 
 Auditorium - both designed by the architect Charles 
 Summer Frost and constructed in 1916 - have survived 
 its ups and downs.

The 
 most western building, a brick and terra cotta building 
 with two prominent towers is the Navy Pier Headhouse. 
 The name was derived from the area, which at the time 
 was known as the Headlands. Each tower housed a huge 
 2-million liter tank for the fire sprinkler system. 
 The Headhouse is now home to Auditorium Building Chicago&apos;s children museum. 
 At the western side of the building is the 19 acre 
 (8 ha) Gateway Park, featuring a modern, computerized granite 
 fountain with 240 jets.

At 
 the other end of the pier is the Auditorium, also known 
 as the Hall. This 
 beautiful building with a magnificent Grand Ballroom 
 measures 138 ft by 150 ft (42m x 48m) and has a 100ft 
 (30m) high half-domed ceiling.
