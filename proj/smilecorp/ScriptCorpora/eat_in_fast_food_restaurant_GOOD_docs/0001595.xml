Jollibee Fast Food
 Posted by: pinoyentre Posted date: August 24, 2006 In: Featured , Food Chain and Restaurant | comment : 64 
Jollibee is one of the Philippines’phenomenal business success stories. Starting in 1975 as a two-branch ice cream parlor, it later expanded its menu to include hot sandwiches and other meals. 

 

With encouraging success, Jollibee Foods Corporation was incorporated in 1978 with seven outlets to fully explore the possibilities of a hamburger concept. Thus was born the company that revolutionized the fast food industry in the Philippines.

In 1984, Jollibee reached the P500 million sales mark, catapulting the company into the list of Top 500 Philippine Corporations. In 1987, barely 10 years in the business, the company joined the ranks of the Philippines’Top 100 Corporations. It then became the first Philippine fast food chain to break the P1 billion sales mark in 1989. In 1993, Jollibee became the first food service company to be listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange; thus broadening its capitalization and laying the groundwork for sustained expansion locally and beyond the Philippines.

Hello! Good Day!

I am really interested to franchise Jollibee! I just want to ask if pwedeng magstart muna sa maliit na store?
Yung puro take out lang muna? maganda kasi yung area namin, wala pa syang fast food chain, mini stop lang ang meron, but I am really and perfectly sure na okey na okey ang location.

I just want to ask if :

1. Can I franchise that kind of store?
2. How much it will cost if I franchise it?
3. What are the requirements needed?
4 .Does Jollibee provide sites and store personnel?
5 .How long does it takes to open the store?
6 .What is the duration of the franchise?

I will really appreciate your response,
