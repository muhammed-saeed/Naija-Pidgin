 About Your Essix Retainer

Always wear your retainer as Dr. Stuckey instructs you to prevent your teeth from shifting. Following these guidelines will help as you proceed with your treatment:



Unless otherwise instructed, your retainer should be worn at all times, except during mealtime and when you are brushing

 Never chew gum with your retainer in your mouth

Anytime your retainer is not in your mouth, it should be in it’s retainer case

Never leave your retainer in a hot car or near a heat source, like a heater or stove, as it will melt, wrap, or distort

Never leave your retainer on a school tray or on a tray at a fast food restaurant, as it will inadvertently be thrown away

Keep your retainer away from all pets

To clean your retainer, you may soak it in a non-alcohol-based mouthwash for about an hour a day to give it a fresh, clean taste

You can also soak it in a denture cleaner, such as Efferdent or Retainer Brite, available OTC from local pharmacies

Your retainer can also be cleaned by soaking it in a half and half solution of hydrogen peroxide and water. Dip a cotton swab in hydrogen peroxide and gently work the swab into the grooves of the retainer to clean and remove debris

Never boil your retainer. It is not heat-resistant

Your tooth relationships and your entire facial appearance will continue to improve over the next eighteen months to two years as nature assists us by adjusting to these corrected tooth positions

Please take care of your retainer because it is an expensive orthodontist appliance and there is a charge to replace any lost or broken retainers

If you experience any problems, lose, or break your retainer, call the office for an appointment as soon as possible. Do not attempt to adjust your retainer yourself
