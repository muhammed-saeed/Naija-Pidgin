 iTouch software is a powerful, yet easy to use point-of-sale solution for the Hospitality industry. The “Fastfood Solution” is an end-to-end solution for fast food outlets that helps improve customer service and maximise profitability. The fast-paced environment of fastfood restaurants requires a point of sale system that is easy-to-use and will quickly handle customer transactions. iTouch is fast, intuitive and simple to use. The touch screen interface helps reduce staff training times and operator errors. Servers register items on the user-definable touch screen that has been tailored to your menu and operation’s needs, orders are sent to the kitchen and credit cards processed in seconds. Transaction times are reduced and iTouch helps increase customer flow to maximize sales volume during peak periods . Orders are automatically sent to kitchen printers or kitchen video screens (KVS) which are wall mounted in the food preparation area. iTouch’s packing display will also show the last four or eight orders taken which allows servers to gather the ordered items and pack the order or place it on a tray.

 Liam Green began ‘Wheelers’ as a traditional fish&amp;chip shop in 1971 and recalls buying his first cash register form Neil Bradley, Managing Director of RST in and around that time. “It was an old push down mechanical NCR 100 Series” recalls Neil “at the time this model was as state of the art as there was and cost around £15”. Wheelers has developed into a well known family restaurant and has been an institution in Derry for many years and has always been a customer of Neil’s and RST.

Liam has a unique relationship being one of RST’s oldest customers “In terms of length of doing business, not my age” explained Liam. “I have always bought my cash registers from RST, like many of my suppliers I have had a long term relationship with them, we prefer dealing with people who look after us.”

 
Through the years Liam has had a number of EPoS systems from Retail Systems Technology, from Sharp Cash Registers in the late 1970’s and 1980’s to Panasonic terminals from the mid 1990’s. Equipment supplied by RST has always been selected to provide customers like Liam with the utmost reliability in the harshest hospitality environment, in fact the last system installed was over 13 years old before being recently replaced! “That was a great return on investment!” explained Neil “I fully expect the Senor APOS and iTouch software to keep Liam going for the next 13 years!”

Retail Systems Technology recently installed a number of Senor APOS touch screen terminals which are designed specifically for demanding hospitality applications such as bars, restaurants, cafes and fast food. With its spill proof design and built in UPS battery they provide the peace of mind of many years of service to come. Orders are entered easily by touch screen using Itouch POS software, and all critical information relayed to the KVS (Kitchen Video System) in the kitchen. The KVS uses Senor Composer terminals which are IP65 Waterproof screens and orders can be summarised or ‘bumped’ using either touch screen or external bump bars.
 
 

 Liam Green, Owner Wheelers with his latest EPoS terminal 
 
Wheelers has recently introduced a home delivery service and is currently implementing iTouch’s delivery module which uses a telephone call logger to pop up customer details on screen and track delivery and collection orders as well as despatches to delivery drivers. “The information I get from the system is fantastic from sales trends and hourly figures to customer spending trends, when customers phone in we can even see what they ordered the last time from us.”

When deciding to upgrade cash registers&apos;s or EPoS customer’s always have to take into consideration problems caused by change however as Liam says “People are used to a system and any change will cause disruption, however RST and their team put a lot of work in before going live and there was no disruption to our business”

Retail Systems Technology was established in 1977 and supplies innovative and state of the art EPoS systems, cash registers, printers, scanners and peripherals throughout Ireland, the UK and Europe. With offices in Londonderry, Belfast and Dublin RST specialise in hospitality and retail solutions and software for bars, restaurants, hotels, fast food, convenience stores, giftware, and specialist retailers.
