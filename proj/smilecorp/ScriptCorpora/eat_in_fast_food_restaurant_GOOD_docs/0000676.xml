 Wendy&apos;s Deserves to Move Up the Fast Food Chain 

 Posted by Emily Abbate on March 20, 2012  
 Fast foodies -- LISTEN UP! There&apos;s a new head honcho in the fast food world by the name of Wendy&apos;s . OK, well second head honcho. Dave Thomas&apos; brainchild recently passed Burger King in U.S. sales volume for the first time since it was founded in 1969 to become the second biggest hamburger chain in the country, next to McDonald&apos;s (duh). Wowza! Seems like the whole making Wendy&apos;s more upscale thing may not have been such a bad idea after all, eh?

But I mean, let&apos;s be serious here. If you are an actual fast foodie, then you know Wendy&apos;s is really where it&apos;s at. Hellllooooooo, have you HAD the Frosty !?

 Something about Wendy&apos;s draws me in every time . While I&apos;m not a fast foodaholic, I&apos;d say that I head there more than 
any other on-the-go place. After I get over the innate guilt that comes 
with stepping foot into any high cal ristorante, I&apos;m always happy that I
decided on Wendy&apos;s. Every single time, it&apos;s fresh, delicious, and shoot
-- I&apos;ll be damned if I walk outta the restaurant without downing at 
LEAST two packets of their absolutely ballin&apos; honey mustard . My mouth is actually watering just thinking about it all.

But hey -- that&apos;s just me. Whether it&apos;s Wendy&apos;s, McDonald&apos;s , or something on the other end of the spectrum like Subway or Chipotle ,
everyone has that one fast food place that they choose more often than 
the others. With the recent overtaking, though, it&apos;s clear that more and
more people are heading toward the land of the No. 6 spicy chicken 
combo. If you ask me -- they&apos;re making the right choice.

 What&apos;s your favorite fast food restaurant? Do you eat at Wendy&apos;s?

 I like Sonic. I cannot stand Wendy&apos;s, first they never get the order right, second the last time I went for DH to get lunch for him and the guys at work, drive through mind you, they said it would take 15 minutes for our order because they had to &quot;drop&quot; the burgers. Does that mean they had to cook them? I don&apos;t know, I went to McDonalds down the street.

  I eat at Wendy&apos;s a few times a week~ whenever my son (who works there) is working. Its also the closest fast food closest to the college I attend.

  &quot;to drop&quot; means to cook your order. My son works for Wendy&apos;s and he says they make the order when you place it that way the foods hot and fresh. Unlike some places that make and let sit under a heat lamp for awhile.

  I wish we had a local place to eat, however, our Wendy&apos;s uses fresh food (ours gets a delivery daily).

 For actual drive-thru fast-food, I&apos;ll take Wendy&apos;s. 

 For speedy sit-down, I like Chipotle, even though the portions are gigantic and I always have leftovers. 

 But we eat fast food maybe once every month or two.

 We actually like Runza they use fresh ground beef for their hambugers. 

 I am not a huge Wendy&apos;s fan and I actually am not a fan of Buger King at all.

 since the kids are all grown now I hardly ever do fast food, I do like Wendys as far as burger places but we are more likely to order pizza hut or stop at KFC but mostly we cook
