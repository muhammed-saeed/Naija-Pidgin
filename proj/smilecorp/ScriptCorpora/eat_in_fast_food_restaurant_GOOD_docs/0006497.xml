Xi the wordii In each of tbe respettlTe lists before attempting to read the lesson that 
follows. The words In tbe tables are to be pronounced&amp;i&gt;m left to nght, as In ordinary 
reading. 

The separate letters of the Alphabet may be easily aud ezpeditiously taught while tbe 
young pupils are learning tbe lists, by asking questions with regard to the formation of 
words, similar to the follo-iflug: What letter is placed after a, to tarm on/ after an to 
fom and 1 before oful, to form land 1 before land, to form Hand t 4c. 

Wben pupils ha-e learned the word« of one. two, aud ibree letters, they ahould be 
taught all of the letters in alphabetical order, on tbe sixth page ; after which their atten- 
tion should be directed to the letters of similar form&amp;tlon, as arranged&lt;m the seTenth page. 

Classes should not be permitted to leave a lesson before tb«y can read it with ease and 
Brecislon. Proceeding thus, from the twenty-second pige they may take an ontire list of

PREFACE. 



■at The Spelling-book ought to occupy a place in primary instruc- 

0^ tion second in iniportauce to that of no other work. We have 
H aimed, therefore, in the preparation of this volume, to furnish all 
kJ *he facilities necessary to teach successfully the orthography, pro- 
nunciation, meaning, and use of the more important words of the 
English language. 

It is now generally conceded, b}- eminent American and Euro- 
pean educators, that the shortest and most successful mode of learn- 
ing spelling is by the et/e ; that the definitions and the use of words, 
IT) as well as their orthography, are soonest acquired by frequently 
^ writing exercises from dictation; and that orthoepy and orthog- 
&quot;~ raphy should be simultaneously taught. This book has been pre- 
—&lt;pared in accordance with these views. 

—&apos; In Part First, containing monosyllables only, the pupil is taught 
to observe the construction of words, and to form tliem by prefix- 
ing and affixing single letters. The lessons are presented in the 
following order : Words of one letter ; words of two letters, formed 
first by prefixing, and secondly by afiixing, a single letter to words 
of one letter; then follow words of two letters only, not thus 
formed. This principle is then extended to words of three, four, 
and more letters. Thus, for example, by affixing n to the word a, 
we have an; by affixing d to a/i, it becomes and ; by prefixing I to 
j;;^ a)id, it becomes land; and lastly, by prefixing&amp;, it becomes bland. 
i£ The words are arranged with regard to their vowel sounds, in al- 
K phabetical order; and, though they appear in columns, they are 
^ divided into paragraphs, and designed to be read from left to right, 

as in ordinary reading. 
&apos;- Part Second contains words of more than one syllable, classified 
2 with regard to their formation, their vowel sounds, alphabetic 
order, accent, and number of syllables. Tlie following miscellane- 
ous exercises are then introduced: Words pronounced alike, but 
differing in spelling and signification; words improperly used for 
each other; eftect of accent in certain words; rules for spelling; 
rules for the use of capital letters; marks used in written lan- 
guage ;_ names of persons; prefixes, their meaning and efiect; 
prepositions used after certain words; abbreviations; and words, 
phrases, and expressions in common use, borrowed from other lan- 
guages. Due discrimination should be used in determining at what 



I&apos;RKIACK. 

stage of tlie pupil&apos;s progress to teach the miscellaneous exercises, as 
well as the orthoepical principles aud exercises ia the first part of 
the ho(jk. 

We have given unusual prominence to pronunciation, not only 
from the consideration that, if neglected in youth, it will rarely, if 
ever, be learned, but because, in its acquisition, the form of words 
is so impressed upon the mind, that it serves as an important aux* 
iliary in teaching orthography. The system of classification is so 
comjdete, that a single word serves as a key to the pronunciatioa 
and spelling of an entire class. By the use of numbered vowels 
and consonants with peculiar marks, a list of which will be found 
on each leaf, we liave been enabled to indicate the ])ronunciation 
of every word, with the necessity of respelling but few; and, in 
their syllabication, to exhibit their roots, ])refixes, and a^xes. 

Great ])ains have been taken throughout the work so to prepare 
the Dictation Exercises sus to familiarize the pupil Avith the best 
forms of constructing sentences; to teach the meaning and use of 
the important words; and to illustrate the rules of spelling, the 
use of capital letters, punctuation, abl)reviations,&amp;c. Those exer- 
cises may be used in various ways. The teacher may read the sen- 
tences slowly and distinctly, wliile the pupils write all the words, 
or the more difficult ones only. When slates are used, they may be 
expeditiously examined by reipnring pupils to exchange, so that each 
one shall become the inspector of liis neighbor&apos;s work, while the 
teacher spells the several words. All mistakes should be corrected 
by the pupil who made them. 

It will be seen, from tlie explanati(m of our plan, that this book 
is adapted to the wants of all classes of pupils, without regard to 
the mode of instruction. Teachers may resort to oral spelling 
only; to spelling both by oral and dictation exercises, which is 
preferable; or, in advanced cla&apos;^ses, dictation exercises only may be 
used. Pupils, however, should always be required to study the 
lists of words, and to pronounce them in the class, before attempt- 
ing to spell, or to read and write the dictation exorcises. This will 
also 1)0 found a valuable work, if used only to teach orthoepy. In 
that case pujiils should be required to study the lists of Avords, and 
to pronounce them in the class; after which, the reading of the 
dictation exercises will serve as a test and conlirmatit)n of their 
pnmunciation. 

Dr. Wehstkk&apos;s lJlCT^o^■AI:Y, as revised by Prof. C. A. GooD&apos; 
Ricn, D. D., in 1850, has been adopted as our standard of orthog- 
rdphy. This Avork has also been our ])rinci])al autliority on t!ie 
subject of prohiuiciatioti ; tiiougii, in (lis|)Uled cases, wo have con- 
stantly consulted Du. Woucesteu&apos;s Dictioxaky, and the works of 
B. H. SiiAKT, Esq., the veteran orthoepist of England. 



ORTHOGRAPHY. 



Definitions. 

1. Orthography treats of tlie nature and properties 
of letters, and the correct spelling or writing of words. 

2. The English Language consists of fortv-three Oral 
Elements, or Elementary Sonnds. 

3. Oral Elements are the sonnds that, uttered sep- 
arately or in combination, form syllables and words. 

■i. Elements are produced by diflerent positions of 
the organs of speech, in connection Avith the voice and 
the breath. 

5. The Principal Organs of Speech are the lips, 
teeth, tongne, and palate. 

6. VoiGE IS PRODUCED by the action of the breath 
upon the larynx.^ 

7. Elements are divided into three classes : eighteen 
Tonics^ fifteen Suhtonics^ and ten Atonies. 

8. Tonics are pure tones produced by the voice, with 
but slight use of the organs of speechf 

9. SuBTONics are tones produced by the voice, modi- 
fied by the organs of speech. 

10. Atonics are mere breathings, modified by the or- 
gans o.f speech. 

11. Le&apos;fi&apos;ers are characters that are used to represent 
the Oral elements. 

12. The English Alphabet consists of twenty-six let- 
ters, viz. : a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, 1, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, 
t, n, V, w, X, y, z. 



» The larynx is the upper part of the trachea, or windpipe. 



8 NATIONAL PKONOUNCING SPELLER. 

13. The Alphabet is on^mED into Yowels and Conso- 
nants. 

14. Towels are the letters that usually represent the 
Tonic elements, and form syllables by themselves. Tliey 
are a,&lt;?, /, o, n, and sometimes y. 

15. A Diphthong is the union of two vowels in one 
syllable ; as, oi in oil, on in oav. 

i«3. A Digraph, or impro])er di}&gt;htliong, is the union 
of two vowels in a syllable, one of which is silent ; as, 
Oil in lo«f. , 

17. A Triphthong is the union of three vowels in one 
syllable ; as, eau in heau, ieu in adieu. 

18. Consonants are the lettei-s that usually represent 
either Subtonic or Atonic elements. They are of two 
kinds, single letters and combined, viz. : b, c, d, f, g, h, 
j, k, 1, ni, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z; fli Subtonic, th 
Atonic, ch, sh, wh, ng. 

The term Consonant, literally meaning sounding with, isapplietl to these 
letters because they are rarely used in words without having a vowel 
connected witli thoni in the siinie syllable, although their elements may 
be uttered separately, and -without tiic aid of a vowel. 

10. Cognates arc lettei-s whose elements arc produced 
by the same organs, in a similar manner; thus,/&apos; is a 
cognate of -y / A of&lt;/,&amp;c. 

20. Alphabetic Equivalents are letters, or combina- 
tions of letters, that represent similar elements, or sounds ; 
thus, i is an equivalent of e, in p«&apos;que. 

Vowels. 

A usually represents six Oral elements, or sounds ; as 
in ale, And,&amp;rt, 411, bare, dsk. 

E usually represents three elements ; as in me, ^-nd, 
tvr. 

&apos;Hie element indicated l)y 5, is also represented by t, o, w, and y; na 
In nurth, word, fur, in;/rrh. 

/usually represents two elements; as in ice. Inch. 



CONSONANTS. 9 

usually represents three elements ; as in old, on, do. 
C^ usually represents three elements; as in tube, tab, 

full. 

J&quot;, when used as a vowel, represents the same elements 
as // as in type (tip), hynni (hini). 

OU usually represents one element ; as in oux. This 
element is also repi&apos;esented by ow • as in nou&apos;. 

01 and O Y are equivalent to a, followed b}&apos; i ; as in 
oi\ (Ml), hoy (bdi). 

Consonants. 

B represents one element ; as in Inh. Before ^, and 
after m, it is silent ; as in deZ/t, thum^y. 

t&apos;has no element peculiar to itself. It represents the 
sound of k before- the letters «, 6&gt;, u^ /, r, ^, and at the 
end of a word, wlieii, in this work, it is printed with a 
dot over it ; as in cane, cot, cure, click, crank, district, 
music. Before e, «&apos;, and y, it represents the sound of s ; 
as in cent, cider, cyst. In a few M&apos;ords, it has the sound 
of z ,&apos; as in suffice. When it comes after the accent, and is 
folloM&apos;ed by ea, ia, io, or eons, it is sounded like sh / as 
in ocean, social, tenacious, cetaceous. It is silent before 
^/ as in hack, lack. 

D usually represents one element; as in d\d. At the 
end of a word, it is sometimes sounded like ^, as in 
imxad ; and in a few words is silent, as in serZge, hec/ge. 

i^ represents one element, as mf&apos;vfe.; except in of. 
when it is sounded like v. 

G usually represents one element ; as in g2ig. Before 
c, i, and ?/, it is usually sounded like J, and is marked 
thus, g ; as in gem, gin, gyve. 

77&quot; represents one element ; as in Aome. It is silent at 
the beginning of a number of words, and after r aud g ; 
as in Aonor, rAyme, gAost. 

e/&quot; represents one element ; as in Just, 

K represents one element ; as in Idwk, It is silent 
before n ; as iu ^nee. 



10 NA&apos;nONAL PRONOUNCING SPELLER. 

L represents one element ; as in ^i/ac. It is silent in 
many words ; as caZt&quot;, lui/f, taZk. 

M represents one element ; as in iiidXin. 

iV^ represents one element; as in no, on. It is some- 
times sounded like ng., when, in tliis work, it is marked 
thus, n; as in bank, thank, an&apos;ger, fin&apos;u;er. It is silent 
after /, or in^ when it ends a syllabic ; as in kibi, liym;«&lt;/* represents one element ; as in pxpa. It is silent 
before n^ s, and t, in the same syllable ; as in j^neumatic, 
^salni, prony&gt;t. 

Q has no element pecnliar to itself. &quot;With u, by which 
it is always followed, it commonly represents the sound 
of ho, as in quaff, qnWt, quoth ; but in many Avords 
derived from the French, it has the sound of A&quot; ; as in 
coquet, cti^uct, Arc. 

7? represents one element; as in rare, for. Wlieii it 
})recedes a vowel, it may be trilled ; as in roll, ronnd. 

S usually represents one element ; as in save, same. 
In many words it is sounded like s as heard in s&apos;inc, 
when, in this \vork, it is marked thus, s ; as in rose, I&apos;ise. 
In a few instances it has the sound of z, as heard in 
azure ; as in pleasure, osier, It sometimes represents 
the sound of sAy as in sure, diversion. 

T represents one element ; as in ^ar^, ^as^e. 

V represents one element ; as in -yalve, rit&apos;id.

to (j2, when the next syllable foUowini^ begins with an 
accented vowel, as in ea^alt, ea&apos;ert; and to l^sh, in some 
words, when the accent immediately precedes it, as in 
ana^ious, hL-rurv. 

J^, when a consonant, represents one element; as in 
yet, yes. 

Z represents two elements. The first may be heard in 
sest, sine. The second, in this work, is marked thus, z; 
as in azure. 



TABLE OF ORAL ELEMENTSo 11 

Til represents two elements. When a Subtonic, in 
this work, it is marked tlius, fii ; as in fliis, wifli. As 
an Atonic, it is heard in tK\\\^ brea^A. 

CII nsually represents one element ; as in cAange, 
mncA. In words derived from the ancient langnages, 
ch is generally sonnded like h / as in acAe, cAasm, scAool, 
It freqnently represents the sonnd of *A, wlien, in this 
work, it is marked thus, di ; as in diaise, dhivalrj, 
madliine. 

/S// represents one element; as in ^Aame, niar^A.

&apos; First require the pupils to utter an element by itself, then to pro- 
nounce distinctly the words that follow, uttering the element after each 
word — thus : ^ge, h, ; ite, k ; bine, i,&amp;c. Exercise the chiss upon the 
above table, till each pupil can utter conseculivelij all the Oral elements. 
The attention of the class should be called to the fact that the first 
element, or sound, represented by each of the vowels, is usually indi- 
cated by a horizontal line placed over the letter, and the second sound 
by a curved line. 

2 Theffth element, or sound, represented by «, is its first or Alphabeiui 
sound, motlificd or softened by r. 

^ The sixth element represented by a, is a sound intermediate between 
a, as heard in at, ash, and a, as in arm, art. 

* The third element represented by e, is e as heard in end, modified or 
softened by r. It is also represented by i, o, u, and y ; as m bird, word, 
burn, myrrh.

the Atonic element, tlien the Subtonic Cognate, uttering the element 
after each word — thus: Wp, p ; orb, b,&amp;c. The attention of the pupil

Words. 

A WORD is one or more Oral elements or letters tised 
to represent an idea. 

Words are divided into primitive, derivative, simple, 
and compound. 

A PRIMITIVE WORD is not derived, but constitutes a root 
from which other words are formed ; as faith, love, ease. 

A DERIVATIVE WORD is 0116 that is formed of a primi- 
tive, bj the addition of an aflix or prefix ; as i\iithful, 
lovely, disease. 

A SIMPLE WORD is ouc that can not be di\&apos;ided without 
destroying the sense ; as an, the, book. 

A COMPOUND WORD is formed bv two or more words: 
as inkstand, bookbinder, laughing-stock. 

Syllables. 

A Syllable is a word, or part of a word, uttered 
by a single impulse of the voice. 

A Monosyllable is a word of one syllable ; as 
home. 



16 KATIONAL PRONOUNCING SPELLER. 

A Dissyllable is a word of two syllables ; as home-less. 

A Trisyllable is a word of three syllables ; as con- 
fine-meiit. 

A Poly&apos;Syllable is a word oi four or vwre syllables; 
as in-no-cen-cy^ un-in-tel-li-gi-hil-i-ty. 

The Ultimate is the last syllable of a word ; asful, in 
])Ciice-J&apos;id. 

The Penult, or penultimate, is the last syllable but 
one of a word ; as mdk, m \iQacc-nuik-Qr. 

The Antepenult, or antepenultimate, is the last syl- 
lable but two of a word; Sisj}eace, in j?&lt;?a6&apos;d-mak-er. 

Accent. 

Accent is the peculiar force given to one or more 
syllables of a word, 

A mark like tins &apos; is often used to show which syl- 
lable is accented ; as read&apos; ing, eat&apos; iiig, re ward&apos;, com- 
pel&apos;, mis&apos; chiev ous, vi o lin&apos;, fire&apos;-eat&apos;er. 

In many trisyllables and polysyllables, of two syllables 
accented, one is uttered with greater force than the other. 
Tlie more forcible accent is called jt^Wma^&apos;y, and the less 
forcible, secondary. 

A mark like this is sometimes used to indicate sec- 
ondary accent ; as, ed&apos; u ca&apos; tiou, ed&apos; u eate , mul&apos; ti pb 
ca&apos; tiou.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. The able and aged man bad tlic ague. Tbe gamester threw 
an acorn to the apex of the gable. Be graciou.s to the crazy brasier. 
Hasten to the lazy glazier and favor bini, for bis UinienesH may jjrove 
fatal. A famous lady, when lately in danger, said of iier baby, &apos;&apos;If

apron, and hasten to liis labor in tiie chamber.

ranging by the spacious station for our native sliips, to see a naval 
pageant. 

3. Champagne ■will inflame, abase, and deprave the sedate man. 
Awake, and engage a clerk to replace and arrange the brocade. 
Unlace your vest, and inhale ihe vapor from the cascade. Forsake 
those that would disgrace yon, or estrange your friends. Do not 
dei&apos;ange nor misplace the tilings. Do not let the grimace of the in- 
sane man enrage you ; but if he escape, aid to retake him. 

4. The plaintiff daily sent the bailiff to take the caitiff. I plainly 
heard the plaintive mt)an of the traitor. The painter drew a cut 
of a railroad, a prairie, and a daisy. The dainty gaiter was pain- 
ful to the dairy-maid. The poor sailor vainly put on more raiment, 
for he had his waistcoat and waistband wet each rainy day. 

5. I am afraid, if I do not constrain him to acquaint his wife 
with his plans, that he will not abstain from the use of rum. De- 
tail a fit man, and retain him to appraise your champaign land. If 
you do not prevail and obtain your right, do not disdain the wretch, 
but bewail his sad end. Though he declaim, and maintain the 
right, and upbraid you, naught will avail. 

6. Can the layman use the crayon? The drayman saw the day- 
star at daybreak. The child gayly said, &quot; In the daytime that play- 
ful dog is my plaything.&quot; Do not delay, but assay to make the 
payment at once. I learned, to my dismay, that the youth would 
not stay away from the affray. Did the wayward player waylay 
tjie mayor by daylight? 

I 7. I heard my neighbor, the weigher, inveigh at the false weight, 
as a heinous cheat. Large birds purvey for their young, and con- 
vey the prey to their nests. Obey my friend.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. Was he angry at the absence of the agile boy? He is absent 
from the alley. Alum is acrid. This man is an arrant anarch. 
Make a bannock of the batter. The blanket and arras are for my 
bed. Can the athlete walk as fast as the horse can amble? In the 
,&apos;barrack, I saw an anchor, an axle, an anvil, a balance, and a box of 
blacking. The barrel of brandy fell on my leg, and hnrt my ankle 
badly. The Baptist wrote a ballad on baptism. An adder lay in 
ambush, with a keen aspect, and made me shake like an aspen, for 
fear he would give battle. 

2. Tlie captain ate a carrot, a cabbage, and some candy, in the 
cabin. The chaplain left the chapel in his cassock, and sat on a 
cannon in the cavern, to read a chapter. His teeth clatter with 
cold, though lie is clad in warm flannel. Do not famish the cham- 
ois, and my cattle. If he drink claret, I fancy he can do no dam- 
age with that fragile dagger. 

3. If you see the gallant captain lashing his horse into a gallop, 
you may gather near; but, in your gladness, do not gabble. Not a 
thing is lacking to fill the landscape with grandeur. My grandsire, 
having a javelin and halberd, made great havoc. My grandson 
went gladly up into the garret, in the granite house, to learn his 
grammar. The lackey left a jacket, handcuff, and lantern, on ray 
hammock. 

4. The ragged, mammotli madman, in his ramble, did madly ran- 
sack each pantry in the parish. I would rather meet a panther in 
the passage, than try to manage his madness. I saw, on the platter, 
some marrow, a radish, a mango, and a napkin. 

5. Tlie saddler says tliat the saddle is now of no value, for it was 
sadly torn by that thankless savage. Be thankful if you get some 
salad and a sandwich in that shanty. Do not shatter that statue near 
the stanchion. Will you traverse the sea in a shallop, or travel in 
a wagon ? 

6. Adapt the cravat to the boy&apos;s use, and attach it to his neck. 
Dispatch some one for the ratan, and abash the cabal ; for, if the 
boys do not decamp, they may attack you. That mishap in tho 
morass, near the canal, was much like a romance.

1. Even tli.is decent being tells a legend of a demon. In a pre- 
cinct of that region, he had a fever ; and, as a sequel, a series of fits. 
A tetrarch in Egypt prepared a legion, in secret, for the war. 

2. The austere man, if sincere, will recede from such an extreme, 
concede tliat I am riglit, and accede to my demand. I will precede 
you and secrete the gold, if they impede your march. I can not

3. When the weary seaman, on the dreary deep, sees a beacon 
gleaming on the seashore, he is eager for the seaside. If the dealer 
did get some treacle in that greasy beaker, he has no regard for 
cleanness. Can an eagle kill a weasel, a beaver, and a peacock? 
Is the deacon that sent the streaked cloth to the heathen, a weaver? 
Tiiough the seamstress like neatness, and do her work neatly, J 
liave reason to think that she is squeamish. 

4. Unsheathe the dirk, and let the smith anneal it. I entreat yon, 
if the judge appear, not to mislead liim, nor to conceal the appeal 
for the release of the youth ; but repeat all that was said, reveal 
the truth, and appease him. If you maltreat the old man, and do 
not endear your son to him, should the disease cause his decease, 
he will bequeath his wealth to a stranger. 

5. Del^n the crack with a beetle. The greedy bear was fleeing 
with a bMhive. Hand me a needle and the tweezers. The sleep- 
less clockmi the steeple must be wound up weekly. She meekly 
I)laced a klepsake by the peerless sleeper. The peevish, feeble free- 
man feeblj^, fought for freedom. 

6. Indee(i, I agree, if they agreed to redeem the razee, to decree 
that she proceed on her passage. If we succeed, and are discreet, 
I foresee thaj between us we can buy some moreen, a settee, a tu- 
reen, a canteen, and a fusee. I beseech you, if that genteel grandee 
is your compeer, to name him for a trustee. 

7. Do you perceive a wasp on the ceiling? Do you conceive that 
seizing the machine was right? I believe that he cither meant to 
deceive, or to aggrieve me. If I had leisure, I could show that I 
am neither moved by conceit nor deceit. People act from caprice. 
The casliier wrote a receipt. These deeds were achieved by valor. 
The police made a seizure of the valise, in a ravine, near the front- 
ier. If the marine force besiege the fort, we will march to its relief, 
when our trends can make a sortie, and retrieve their loss.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. Beckon to the gentle boy that is heljjiiig fill the empty cellar, 
and send him on an errand to get my Icger. A bedbug is on the 
bedding, on the bedstead, in my bedroom. That blessed cherub is 
a blessing to lar erring father. The kettle and fender are at the 
ferry. She said in her letter, that the merry, clever lad had earned 
a medal. The chemist will not meddle with that melon, near the 
hemlock. The despot left liis liehnet in the belfry. I fear the melt- 
ing snow may cause a deluge on the level ground, that will bear 
away the levee. 

2. I wrote a message to my messmate, witli a pencil. There never 
was method in the nether room. I relish a plenty of pepper in my 
food. The sheriir made a second schedule&lt;tf the goods. The self- 
isji .Jew, in his splendor, would not give a shekel to the starving 
shepherd. Twenty yards of that velvet would be a splendid pres- 
ent. The seven men in lliat vessel must perish, if she can find no 
shelter from the storm. When tlie skejitic, in his terror, sought a 
refuge in the temple, the tempest caused it to tremble. 

3. I consent not to avenge my wrongs, if you confess tliat you 
did abet the adept in his attempt to gain access to my room, when 
I was abed. Collect the assets, and accept the beijuest. He will

4. Be content to contend for the right, and to defend all that are 
in distress. Do not contemn and detest those tliat dissent from 
your express views ; but divest your mind of the bad efiect of con- 
tempt. Do not expect to excel, if not exempt from defect. After 
they elect your son, if lie must contest liis seat, direct him not to 
regard expense ; but to dispense favors freely, and to depend on his 
friends in his defense. 

5. Inspect the gazette, and read the farewell address. Do not 
lament, if he invent a tale of the immense extent of the land I 
possess. If she herself, by a finesse, intend to foment the feud, or 
to impel my friend himself, for any i)retense, to object to extend the 
time of my payment, I will neither forget nor neglect to perplex 
and oppress her. 

6. I regret that, for any pretext, you should profess to protect the 
girl, and redress her wrongs, when she does not repent for the past, 
nor respect you. Unless you yourself relent and prevent her suc- 
cess, I will resent this slight; and, to end your suspense, revenge 
my wrongs. If you susj)ect that James will transgress, I suggest 
that you request your son to select a man to do the work. 

7. If I have any horse from so many, I want a steady one. 
Again ask that cleanly kd to have some breakfast. The healthy 
peasant found a treasure in the meadow. When you are ready to 
kill the pheasant, rest that heavy, deadly weapon against the fence. 
N^either deafness nor headache can daunt that deathless soul. If 
the weather is i)leasant, that zealous, steadfast lad is bound for 
pleasure. 

8. I will go, instead of the maid, to see if the cloth is unspread. 
Do not jeopard your life, if the leopard seize the heifer. If you 
long for friendship, be friendly. Tiiat saddle has but one stirrup. 
Do squirrels gnaw ?

country caused their migration liitlier. On what occasion wa? he 
so outrageous ? In his oration, he tried to ingratiate himself with 
the people. 

4. Tliongh persuasive in manner, it was vexatious to hear his 
])rosaic attempt at persuasion. The fox is sagacious and rapacious. 
Will you exchange some jwtatoes for pomatum? The relation of 
their privations on the plantation, caused a sensation. Though the 
spectator saw the tornado, he was unable to escape. Tlie vivacious 
youth says that voracious virago fell into a volcano. 

5. The cavalcade will ambuscade&apos; ibr the enemy. We will sere- 
nade our friends, as they promenade around the balustrade. In- 
struct them to barricade the street near the colotmade, if they 
expect a cannonade. They may drink lemonade on the esplanade, 
or grass-plat. 

6. Are ^^ou an acquaintance of that traitorous aid-de-camp ? I can 
etfect my maintenance unaided. The unfaithful appraiser, tiiough a 
surveyor, is not surveying the land. The complainant will expend 
tlje &apos;•emainder of his estate, to procure the arraignment of his as.^ail- 
ant. &quot;With liis attainments and unfailing gayety, he can not fail to 
entertain the meeting. The nmsket has no bayonet. Ascertain the 
amount payable. The conveyer was conveying a conveyance of the 
estate.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. If the king&apos;s power be absolute, lie will not abdicate; but lie 
will abrogate the treaty and attack the am&apos;buscade. Tlie accident 
to the admiral required abstinence from solid aliment. &quot;What could 
actuate the alTable advocate to refuse to make an accurate state- 
ment of the actual aggregate received ? The alchemist seeks, by al- 
chemy, to gain afHuence, and to aggrandize himself. Alcohol will 
agitate, aggravate, and cause agony. The alphabet is nrnch used in 
algebra. &apos; 

2. My friend saw an antelope, witli other animals, near the Am- 
azon river. Tlie ambergris was found at the ancliorage. He took 
an anodyne and an antidote. To prevent anarchy, the king declared 
an amne-sty. My ancestor told an anecdote of an anchoret who 
was noted for liis apatliy and appetite. He received an annual sum 
for repairs on the aqueduct. What is the average price of that ara- 
ble land? If that arrogant man attempt to arrogate power over 
my friend, I will animate him to oppose. 

3. Tiuit bacchanal on the balcony is a bachelor. The barrister 
says the baluster was no barrier to the battery. The cabinet will 
send liim into banishment for a casual remark. Did the candidate 
castigate him for calumny ? Did the cannibal eat carrion ? Tlie can- 
opy is made of calico. He Avill calculate the cost of tlie calamus 
root, calomel, candlestick, canister, and cassimere. Take my cate- 
chism and catechise the child. The cavalry fouglit near a cataract. 

4. Cliamomile is bitter, and cranberry sour. His cliarity and 
his character as a champion for tlie poor are well known. Clarify 
the tluid. The feculty are versed in classical lore. It&apos;ihe lad lu- 
jtire the daffodil, send him to the gallery for chastisement. The. 
farrier left his chariot and liorses at my factory. The garrulous 
dramatist did not fascinate my family, with his flatulent flatteiy. 
The garrison, for their gallantry, deserve the gratitude of the peojjle. 

5. Put some lavender on the handkerchief. Do not lacerate my 
flesh with manacles. A laxative may remove his malady and lassi- 
tude. The lady took tlie manuscript, and read a madrigal in a mas- 
culine tone. Read my Manual of Magnetism. Did the peo[)le of

tliat inarititne town appoint magistrates? Does tlie mariner I&apos;Cnow 
tlie maximum price of maclcerel? The magistrate said, &quot; It is man- 
ifest that tlic matri(;ide does not respect the mnjosty of tiie law, nor 
regard tlie magnittidc of his eriiiie.&quot; 

fi. Without reading my paraphrase, you would think the paradox 
in my narrative a palpable err(U\ The passenger should know that 
we can nut navigate the river without patronage. A piiragraph 
iVom that parable would pacify the child. In the jiantomime, a 
paroquet appears to hold a ])arasol. The jiarasite declares that yoin* 
daughter is a paragon with uo parallel. A practical man will not 
]&quot;»atr()nize (juackery. 

7. &quot;Ramify the treaty, if the king ratify, it. The sasafras and 
tamarind are a rarity in this county. The raspberry has sanative 
and .saccharine qualities. Is it sacrilege for a man without .sanctity 
to partake of the sacrament? The vagabond will scandalize us by 
some tratredy or scandalous rhapsody. The receipt of the valentine, 
on Saturday, tranquilized his mind and jjleased his vanity. 

8. I will reijuest my companion to abandon his bombastic style 
of Avriting, for it is not attractive. Put on ai)parel proper for 
aqnatic sports. The assassin joined the battalion and crossed the 
Atlantic. Neither disparage nor end;arrass that erratic youth, if 
you have an attacliment for iiim. Some botanic extracts are good 
cephalics. That ecstatic poem is didactic, as well as dramatic. De- 
traction from that fanatic can not injure my financial prospects. 
Tlie detachment did establish a fantusiic encampment exactly in 
front of the wood. 

9. The meclianic made a galvanic engine. A gigantic mulatto 
taught gynmastic games on the i)iazza. If there be an infraction 
of that tyrannic law, do you imagine that inactive sheriff will im- 
panel a jury? People who inhabit that volcanic J&apos;cgion lead a 
monastic life. A river meanders tiirougli tlie romantic savanna. I 
trust we can substantiate the fact, tliat this unthankful rascaliou 
was engaged in that unhappy transaction.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. I desire the arbiter to liear my argument, if he arbitrate. 
Archery was prized by barbarous nations. Did the arcliitect show 
tlie archetype of the arcliitrave? During the armistice tliey Avill 
prepare an armament for the ship, at the armory. Tlie artitice of 
the cardinal during carnival is chargeable to the parliament. Tiie 
charlatan artfully practiced pharmacy. My guardian says tiiat the 
carpenter, if a partisan, will sutler martyrdom. Tlie marcliioness 
sent some marmalade to the parsonage. The luirmonist liarmonized 
the tune, and produced harmony witli the liarpsichonl. 

2. My copartner, with much nonchalance, has taken my apart-

menial recently went to the city with a vehicle. Previous to that 
period, I !?aw a meteor. Do not deify a thing formed by Deity. 
The regency, though lenient, govern by secrecy. 

2. Tiie secretion is acetous. Wax is adhesive. His adherent, 
tliough your coequal, gave in his adhesion to my party. Behemoth 
was a primeval animal. Were the cathedral and museum coeval 
with the Pantheon ? He is unequal to the completion of the task. 
Tiie facetious lad told an egregious falsehood about the hyena. The 
ideas of the plebeian, at the lyceum, were indecent. It is illegal to 

&quot; subiwena the vicegerent. 

3. If he be insincere, antecede him and contravene his measures. 
Unless you persevere, the work will be incomplete. If you do not 
intercede nor interfere, you may supersede my clerk. 

4. Is the fricassee eatable? Do not be uneasy nor indiscreet, if 
the proceedings are feasible. Judging from his appearance and 
demeanor, you would think the buccaneer peaceable. In his be- 
reavement, the financier listened to my entreaty and made an agree- 
ment to pay the arrearage. The patentee is a nominee for an office. 
I Avill buy a magazine and a gazetteer. If the referee try to inveigle 
the pioneer, he will meet with unforeseen trouble. The devotee is 
speaking of the unbelief of the absentee. A mandarin, on board 
the ship at quarantine, has a dress of bombazine. Did the overseer 
domineer over the refugee? The brigadier, cavalier, chevalier, 
grenadier, and volunteer were armed cap-a-pie.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. Will yon decoi&apos;ate my bedcliamber ? If ^ron use that bever- 
age, beggary will be your destiny. Though credulous, he has no 
deference for the decalogue. The delicate dentifrice had a chemical 
eifect. Though there is a clerical error, the writing is credible. 
Witliin a century, much has been learnt with regard to dentistry 
and chemistry. The deputy will designate a definite time to ded- 
icate the temple and celebrate our victory. That desperate delegate, 
though a democrat, is a denizen and a demagogue. If he deprecate 
despotism and be not destitute of clemency, lie will not devastate, 
or de.solate, the land. 

2. He is in ecstasy with that elegant ebony cane. The epicure 
says that evergreen is an excellent esculent, or edible. The episode 
in that eloquent address will tend to edify and elevate your mind. 
That eminent man wrote an epitaph, elegy, and epilogue, at one sit- 
ting. Emphasis is one element of eloquence. Enmity must not move 
you to execrate your enemy, nor to burn Jiim in effigy. Estimate tlie 
value of that emerald. From this eminence 1 saw an elei)hant. 
The emperor sent on tliis enterprise an embassy who was noted for 
his elegance. The excellence of that exquisite equipage is evident 
to every one. Energy will enable you to extricate yourself from 
that exigence and to execute your enterprise. 

8. In the Federal courts, felony is a crime severely punished

No gentleman can be present at tlie feminine festival. Did the 
mendicant indnlge in levity? The lexicon has medical terms. Tiio 
melody roused him from his letliargy. The heroine of the ta.y 
is a genuine native of the Western hemisphei&apos;e. The negligent 
messenger left the medicine. The generous general is noted for his 
lenity and heroism. If the heretic hesitate to renounce the heresy, 
lie will lose his legacy and heritage. 

4. Tiie pedagogue is noted for his pedantry. The penitent will 
not suffer the penalty, during the pendency of the suit. AVill the 
pelican eat pepj)ermint? The i)erilous descent at the precipice will 
petrify you with fear. Petulance is not a mark of penitence. The 
qUL&apos;rulous pensioner, though reduced to penury, now has a perj)et- 
ual income. lu the plenitude of his mercy, God stayed the pesti- 
lence. If you have a preference for virtue, its prevalence will re- 
move your prejudice against this city. The presbyter read the peii- 
tateuch on the (lay of pcutecosi. 

5. Kectify your error, and reconcile and recompense your servants 
No one questioned the rectitude of the regicide, in our regiment. 
That remedy and regimen will renovate your health. My relative 
kept a regular register, while a resident of the city. Do not reprobate 
the renegade, but reprimand him. If, on taking a retrospect, I deem 
it requisite, I will change my residence for the residue of the term. 
Reverence the reverend gentleman, though he has but a small rev- 
«.&apos;nue. That sedulous senator is iu)t sensible that he is in a reverie. 

6. The veteran uttered a noble sentiment. I saw a skeleton in 
the .sepulcher. Several men wish a separate settlement. The spell- 
ing-book, the telegi&apos;aph, and the telescope are useful. The ground 
taken in your argunient on skepticism is not tenable. Ventilate 
the vestibule of tlie tenement. Temperance has a tendency to pro- 
mote temporal good. Did that terrible spectacle terrify the child, 
yesterday? Verily I will testify to this verity. 

7. The amendment was made to the acceptance oi the convention. 
The contentious appellant accepted the correction as authentic. lu 
that aggressive adventure he madi an accession to his wealth. Tho 
appendix is a useless appendage. The athletic apprentice gained 
the attention of the assembly, and wan in tho nscc nuaut. .1 conjor- 
ture tlicy had a clandestine meeting last bis.sextile. A fair com- 
plexion needs no cosmetics. 

8. After the declension of liis business in DeccinlKT, tlie decep- 
tive defendant knew his debenture was worthless. The decrepit 
dependent is in a state of dejection. After the election of that ec- 
centric man, his excessive demerit caused the defection of his do- 
mestics. Ilia depression led t(; the detection of the crime. He

will develop the plot in his digression. His distemper and deten- 
tion placed him in a dilemma. Embellish the book with expensive 
cuts. An emetic will remove the endemic. Did the thoughtless 
expression envenom his mind? The expectant did embezzle the 
money received from the exchequer. 

9. Before the inspection, I had ai) impression that the indenture 
was worthless. What incentive could secure his incessant etForts 
in this inclement weather? Take a preventive, if you would avoid 
the infection. I shall inherit the estate, if it be intestate. It was 
the intention of the intendant to foment intestine feuds. I listened 
intensely to that otfensive invective. If you otier no objection, in 
November I will make an investment of all my possessions. On 
that momentous occasion the majestic polemic made a pathetic 
speech for the prevention of oppression. 

10. His unerring perception and transcendent judgment insure 
iiis progression in that profession. The measures are prospective 
and progressive. Prudential reasons will prevent the reception of&apos; 
our prospectus in September. Tlie protective tariff, you will re- 
member, is for the protection of mechanics. Retiection led to the 
rejection of the prunella and suspendei-s. While the rebellion 
is in a state of quiescence, they will replenish the fort. Do not fear 
the resentment of that i-espectful and repentant youth. His reten- 
tive memory, and his resemblance to the general, secured his selec- 
tion. A succession of resplendent exploits caused the surrender of 
tlie fort, a suspension of the war, and the subjection of the people. 
The ruins of those stupendous works are tremendous. 

11. I will circumvent him, if he make an indirect attempt to 
intercept my letter. Y(jur subtrahend is incorrect. Intersect means 
to divide. Do not reprehend the man, if he recommend satinet, or 
represent it as good. 

12. The unhealthy lad will endeavor to i)ractice cleanliness. That 
unpleasant, treacherous man is moved by jealous}-. Tlie peasantry 
are already in jeopardy from the treachery of their pretended friends. 
The unsteady treasurer is noted for his pleasantry, at the treasury. 
The unfriendly man was at the burial.

1. The clerg3&apos;man at the liermitage will certainly certify the king 
of the inarriage. Know for a certainty, that perjury and perfidy 
shall receive their deserts. Fertilize the soil hefore the seeds ger- 
minate. The merciful herrnitess prayed fervently for that merciless 
personage. Secure a permanent place in a mercantile house. Pay 
for the mercliandise with tlie perquisites of your office. AVill that 
servitor servilel}&apos; permit a termagant to persecute hira? That per- 
sonal remark was pertinent. That serpentine wood is not pervious 
to an army. In his verdancy he did not know that his labor would 
terminate at the terminus of the road. 

2. lie will report adversely concerning coercive measures. His 
advertence and discernn)ent i)revented desertions. He has an aver- 
sion to coercion. Bis infernal assertions and aspersions caused the 
dispersion of my friends. The conversion and inunersioii of my 
fraternal preserver made my heart glad. If that emergence discon- 
cert hiiu, I fear it nuiy cause tiie insertion of an imperfect sentence. 
Is the wound internal or external ? That observant child receives 
maternal and paternal love. The reversion is uncertain. His per- 
verseness caused the subversion of the empire. 

3. The courteous journalist, who was present at the rehearsal, 
obtained a circular for me. The circumspect attorney pressed his 
denmrrer with much urgency. The turpitude of the journeyman 
led him to commit burglary. Moved by my urgency, he is furnish- 
ing the nursery with new furniture. His nocturnal disbursements 
exceed his diurnal receipts. The usurper says the insurgeuts shall 
reimburse the expenses of the war.

1. &quot;When going to the bir lery to get a diary, .Tames saw a binary 
or double star. Jf the hierarch of the diocese use irony, lie &quot;will be 
liable to censure. Tlicre is little likelihood that he can obtain the 
diadem by bribery. The sciolist has written a dialogue in a strange 
dialect. Among other finery in the library, I saw a diamond and 
some ivory. He earned Jiis liveliliood with his microscope. Did a 
nightingale disturb tlie (juictude of liis jirivacy? lie gained a sine-

Dictation Exercises. 

1. In llic civilized world, biblical knowledge has not removed 
bigotry. The chivalrous citizen regrets that the days of chivalry 
are passed. Bigamy is made criminal in all Christendom. If my 
finical friend criticise that frivolous work, see that his criticism is 
just. I saw a cimeter at the citadel. There is a marked dilference 
between ditTidence and ignorance. Hitherto, that diffident man has 
berii diligent in business. That impudent lad will soon dissipate 
lii&gt;sliare of the dividend. You will be in imminent danger, if that 
]ii(k&apos;()us idiot seize the hickory cane. 

2. What incidence caused his indigence? The increment of his 
garden indicates a rich soil. That infamous woman Avill indurate 
her son&apos;s heart, in infancy. Indolence and insolence often lead to 
infamy. What could instigate the infidel to irritate that innocent 
youtli and cause such an injury? Industry was the instrument that 
gave him influence. Intellect sweetens intercourse. During the 
interview, what led you to draw the inference, that that intricate 
business will cause infinite trouble? Iterate the remark, &quot;It will 
be for your interest, in the interim, or interval, to institute no 
suit.&quot; 

3 That liberal man will esteem it a privilege to liquidate the 
debt and liberate the debtor. The libertine was (tf good lineage. 
Liberty is the ligament that binds the states together. Tlie liturgy 
was prepared for the churcii militant. Did the minister perform a 
miracle, at Michaelmas? The mischievous lad was noted for his 
mimicry. Will the milliner, in her misery, litigate her claim? Did 
you hear the piteous cry of that miscreant ? 

4. Is that timorous and rickety cliild exposed to the ridicule and 
ribaldry of that villainous man? Will that rigorous man observe 
tiie ritual service? The signatures are similar. Though the de- 
fense was vigorou.s, he fought skillfully, gained the victory, and 
signalized his name. His vigilance will enable him signally to de- 
feat their villainy, and vindicate his honor. Tiie simpleton chose 
a slippery path near a rivulet, in the wilderness. Rocpiest your 
visitant, or visitor, to signify his most trivial wants. 

5. The benignant committee, after reading an abridgment of the 
law, favored the acquittal of the i)risoner. In his affliction, if he 
gain admission into your liouse, he will implore your assistance. 
On that auspicious occasion, ambition induced t)ie capricious civil-

ian to secure a commission in the army. The collision was contin&apos; 
gent. Consider the condition of tlie parties. If he feel contrition 
and continue consistent with himself, the trial can not lead to his 
commitment and conviction. 

6. Tlie delinquent was deficient in decision. Did the efficient 
youth deliver my epistle and the delicious fruit? If you would 
avoid derision, speak distinctly, and he explicit in your description. 
Exhibit the map before dismission. The empiric, or quack, will 
distribute an edition of the book among his friends. If you enkin- 
dle a rebellion in his dominion, can he extinguish it with these 
equipments? 

7. They are too familiar to be litigious or malignant. The mu- 
nitions and nutritious food are on the flotilla. The fruition of il- 
licit or forbidden things is brief. I will visit that infringement with 
an infliction. What led to the omission of the initial letters of the 
musician&apos;s name? The magician puzzled the logician. The dcci&quot; 
iou was both judicial and judicious. Though the optician is offi- 
cious, I value his opinion 

8. The religious patrician favors pacific measures. I had permis- 
sion to present the pernicious petition at the pavilion, though it 
places the jihysician in a false position. The postillion, though un- 
skillful, is submissive. A restrictive provision, if stated with pre- 
cision, to prohibit the sale of rum in the provincial towns, would 
further the cause of religion. Subn&apos;iission is not sufficient at that 
punctilious court. Did he solicit aid to quell a sedition? The un- 
thrifty farmer is unwilling to pay for the violin. Suspicion and 
tradition did not warrant that vindictive and terrific measure. 

9. The column was not a cylinder, but a pyramid. How bodies 
crystallize is a mystery. Josepli is a hypocrite and a sycophant. 
That mystical book says that there are a myriad physical mysteries. 
Do you observe the symmetry of that sycamore ? That symphony 
awakens sympathy. Though the laws are tyrannous, the king will 
not favor tyranny.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. Mary is not amitible, for lier temper is variable. One who 
is guilty of ])lai,narisiii, or .stealing from the writings of others, is 
called a i)Iagiarist. If the light be favorable, variegate the paper 
with blue and white. 

2. The writ is abatable. The agrarian was guilty of chicanery. 
If the barbarian subsist only on spontaneous i)roductions, his living 
will be precarious. Sheep are gregarious animals. That extrane- 
ous matter is calcareous. The grannnarian declares with compla- 
cency, that he has recovered from the cutaneous disease. The 
librarian was incapalde of so nefarious an act. That sectarian is a 
vicarious agent. Tiie earth is called terracpieous because it is com- 
peted of land and water. 

3. Having; gained tlie aduiiration of the congregation, ho was

elected by acclamation. His adoration was sincere. The affidavit 
and allegation are false. That advantageous measure will secure 
their afiprobation. His adulation was an aggravation of the evil. 
You can easily determine the calculation by the application of an 
algebraic formula. His conversation, after the celebration of the 
marriage, awakened contemplation. His commendation of the 
compilation is a sufficient confirmation of its value. The confla- 
gration caused much consternation in the convocation. A due cul- 
tivation of the head and the lieart will lead to a glorious consum- 
mation. 

4. Emulation and the expectation of a reward moved him to 
make a declamation. I rely on liis declaration. Defamation and 
dissipation caused his degradation. Demonstrations of joy ill be- 
come the desperado, after his depredations have made my garden a 
desolation. If, in his desperation, you provoke his detestation, you 
will incur his imprecatio!i. His deviation from the path caused the 
dislocation. Her invocations of the gods was to secure the power 
of divination. Your illustrations will provoke no exclamation of 
surprise from the ignoramus. Her education will surpass your ex- 
pectations. The exportation of cotton and importation of silk may 
benefit the nation. He has no inclination for information. Her 
intimation enabled ine to find your habitation. 

5. Wicked legislation and regulations caused the lamentation of 
the people. The mediation of the literati secured his liberation. 
Meditation leads to moderation. He devotes to navigation all the 
time that his other occupations will permit. If you secure my 
nomination, you will place me under obligations. His pharisaic 
life and ostentation injure his reputation. Do not regard his prot- 
estation, if the operation will secure the preservation of the prop- 
erty. He urged the provocation in palliation of his profanation. 
In the preparation and publication of the proclamation, observe the 
rules of punctuation.. Recreation and a relaxation of study will 
promote his reformation. Her respectful salutation and the value 
of her revelation secured her restoration to her friends. His wild 
speculations and destitute situation caused their separation. When 
I was in tribulation, God heard my supplications. If he encourage 
the violation of just stipulations and accept a false valuation of the 
goods, I can have no veneration for the man. 

6. The abecedarian says that his teacher is a good disciplinarian. 
His speech was extemj)oraneous. The y)redestinarian is a sexage- 
laarian. Will the valetudinarian accept t&apos;-ie administratorship?

Dictation Exercises. 

1. If you make an amicable arrangement with your adversary, 
he will be an admirable accessory to the felony. The accuracy of 
his statement does not excuse liis acrimony. His ideas of agricul- 
aire are antiquated. He Avishes to secure the magistracy for his 
own aggrandizement. That amatory poem is an allegory. The 
antiquary has a valuable alabaster vase. That janizary is a gladia- 
tor, or prize-fighter. That fashionable tabernacle is now habitable. 
It is a lamentable fact, that the chariKble lapidary has a&quot;i attack of 
apoplexy. The river is navigable, jn January, when she is mar- 
riageable, she will enjoy her patrimony. Is tlie foe at the sanctu- 
ivry vanquishable ? 

2. After the abandonment of the academy, he labored with alac- 
rity. Solve the problem by analysis. Tlie anatomist has prepared 
a Manual of Anatomy. If he take my asparagus, 1 will i)unish his 
audacity. Ilis barbarity, or brutality, caused this catastrophe. Ilia 
want of capacity led to this calamitt)us treaty. Acid will coagulate 
or thicken milk. He enjoys comparative ease. That comparison 
is not compatible with justice. Congratulate your friend on his 
success. Vice contaminates character. 

3. Decapitate is to cut off the head. Tlie tenor of his letter is 
declarative of Ins depravity. In his embarrassment, he could not 
tell tlie meaning of diameter. Will they evacuate the fort and di- 
lapidate the walls? To practice frugality is no disparagement to 
an embassador. Tiic evangelist will elaborate that dogmatical ser- 
mon. Emancipate the serf. The sentence is empliatical and gram- 
matical. Tiiat extravagant speecii will not eradicate errors. Avoid 
formality and fanaticism. His humanity led him to exaggerate the 
sufferings of the poor. 

4. If his salary be inadequate to his sujiport, the church, if not 
unanimous, will increase it by a plurality of votes. He is noted 
for his rapacity and ingratitude. The ])rii)ter will italicize that in- 
transitive verb. If you question the legality of the marriage or 
try to invalidate it, she will commit infanticide. No one is infal- 
lible. Flax is iiitiannnal)le. 7\jat dog is noted for his sagacity and 
Toracity. Do not let misanthropy, t&gt;r hatred of mankind, move 
you to infatuate the yc^&apos;i,n and cause him to pursue that erratic 
course. His hxpiacit&apos;&apos; and inondacity are di-;gusting. Tliat refract- 
ory servant is noted ior liis rascality, vulgarity, and rapacity. If he 
[)rocrastinate, prevaricate, and retaliate, I shall (juestion liis morality. 
That law is unnatural and tyrannical. Tlie tobacconist is a soni-

nambulist. The inhabitants of that locality often speak of the ur- 
banity and veracity of tliat magnanimous pliilanthropist. 

5. His speech -vvas declamatory. This letter is declaratory of 
your father&apos;s wishes. His trouble is imaginary. His words are 
defamatory, or false and injurious. That island is not inhabitable. 
Attend to your preparatory studies. 

6. My benefactor is a democratic leader and a di[)lomatic agent. 
Tlie malefactor stole coriander seed. If you manufacture those 
goods, keep a memoi-andum of them. Mathematics should be pur- 
sued in a systematic manner. 

7. The popularity of tlie biographical, geographical, and mathe- 
matical works is satisfoctory to tlie publishers. Without question- 
ing my criminality, they received me with coi&apos;diality at the car- 
avansary. Thongli the generality of mankind commend liberality, 
they condemn prodigality. If his manufactory wa^re burned, liis 
])unctuality, regularity, and pertinacity Avould enable him to rebuild 
It. If our host indulge in personalities, he will violate the rules 
of hospitality. Vice and virtue are incompatible. His sensuality 
has made him pusillanimous. There is a tj-pographical error in 
that topographical work. That indefatigable student will study 
mineralogy. 

8. Tlie aristocratic ecclesiastic addressed the people of that mu- 
nicipality in entliusiastic strains. I enjoy conviviality. I question 
the perpeudicularity of that post. The universality of that law is 
not doubted. The immateriality of the spirit is not understood.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. Since the collegian is amenable to the college laws, he may 
deem it expedient to abbreviate liis essay. Hear tlie aerial song- 
sters. That obedient and abstemious son will alleviate the care ot 
the inebriate&apos;s wife. That imperious manner is not congenial to 
the comedian. Anterior to that event, my limited experience had 
led me to take tlie exterior as a criterion of character. Tlmt tra- 
gedian has few superiors. The ingredients were prepared from 
materials found in the interior of tiio country. That ob.-jequious 
man secured tlie vicegerency in a mysterious way.

That sacrilegious Presbyterian used tlic ministerial fund for magis- 
terial purposes. It is immaterial wlu-ther they buy tallow or .sper- 
iriafc&apos;ti. A clay soil is uncrtugeiiial to that jilant. The cpicureairs 
trouble is irremediable. Much may he learned from an encyc]o])e- 
dia. That heterogeneous mixture was called a panacea, or remedy 
for nil diseases. 

a. Is Ills ])roperty concealable, or iriconcealalde? Water is con- 
pealable. At this unseasonable hour, it is unreasonable to visit our 
friend. Ilis conduct is unimpeachable, and Ids lille indefeasible. 
Wii.-ii could cause tlio disagreement between those agreeable people 
is inconceivalile. Time once past is irredeemable. His credit is 
irretrievably lost.

Dictation iL&apos;xercises. 

1. Tliat estimable youth, wlio is so exemplary in his life, is justly 
celebrated for his efficacy in an exigency. A man Avho is given to 
epicurism generally prefers celibacy. The ceremony at the ceme- 
tery was credible to those present. In a desultory conversation, 
the legislator said that his friend, though eligible to that office, and 
sustaining an enviable reputation, is restrained by his delicacy. 
That despicable emissary, w^ho is employed on tliat execrable busi- 
ness, ridicules epilepsy. The decision of that equitable judge 
with regard to mendicancy is not explicable by the usual rules of 
law. His excellency the governor wrote his memorable letter to 
the legislature in February. 

2. It is necessary that the teacher at the seminary be peremp- 
tory. The prebendary, in his prefatory remarks, declared necro- 
mancy merely speculative. Tliough her character be not reputable, 
she is i&gt;enetrable to kind entreaties. The predatory party destroyed 
all vegetables and other perishable property. That speculator is a 
sedentary man. If the decree be revocable, his testimony will be 
valuable. The presbytery will elect that venerable man to the 
presidency. 

3. The celebrity you acquired from the celerity of your move- 
ments will accelerate the march of your competitor. If that de- 
lectable mountain be accessible, an invitation to visit it will be 



loi NATIo:SAL PRONOUNCING SPELLER, 

ige, kt, art, ill, bare, ask ; m6, knd, 6rr ; ico, Sn ; old, 6n, do 

acceptable. Man is the appellative, or coiiiinoti name, of tbe whole 
liuniaa race. It&apos; lie gain the ascendency in tlie conventicle, or 
Kecret assembly, his asperity and austerity will disgnst his confed- 
erates. Beneficent means doing good; benevolent, merely having 
a desire to do good; but both arc commendable terms. His bien- 
nial fast, for two consecutive days, is designed to commemorate tlie 
sufferings and virtue of his father. The degenerate and detestable 
directory did not manage the affair with dexterity. That contem- 
plative old man, in his decre[)itude and dependency, Cuds nothing 
in tills life commensurate with his desires. 

4. Effectual means were taken to secure the electoral vote fur 
that irresolute, intemperate, and effeminate candidate. It is in- 
credililo tliat that impetuous speecli, witli its many embellishments, 
was delivered extempore. Were the executor and executrix guilty 
of embezzlement ? The equestrian statue of the executive will elec- 
trify the spectators. His fidelity as a minister, and his integrity in 
business, exemplify the value of his precejits. After the impedi- 
ments were removed, that incredulous teacher deferred making the 
experiment for an indefinite time. If tliut ingenuous man lose his 
inheritance, he will retjuest you, in his extremity, to investigate his 
affairs. If you interrogate that intelligent lad, and he ct)nfess that 
lie used an indelicate expression, his frankness will extenuate iiis 
offense. That inveterate drinker, who has suflered so much from 
intemperance, is impenitent. 

5. The progenitor of that family and his posterity were noted 
for their longevity. His malevolence is jierceptible. Millennium 
means a thousand years. If the obstreperous pedestrian have the 
temerity to disturb our triennial solemnities, he will necessitate us 
to resort to severity. His necessitous friends are the cause of that 
ungenei&apos;ous man&apos;s peri)lexity. T(^ his poetical, susceptible, and re- 
generate heart, the beauties of nature are a source of perennial or 
perpetual cheerfulness and serenity. The grave is the receptacle 
of the dead. On that tempestuous night, I took my supper at a re- 
fectory. I do not question the supremacy of Congress in making 
war and peace. Death ends terrestrial scenes. His sincerity does 
not excuse liis severity. 

6. That commemorative act is unnecessary. A cotemporary 
writer speaks of that poet&apos;s effeminacy, and the degeneracy of the 
jieople. That song was extemporary. Do not deprive your sti- 
pendiary of liis iidieritable estate and inestimable rights. Those 
incendiary remarks, hi&gt;hereditary pride, and the inveteracy of his 
hate, liave rendered that mail&apos;s character unenviable. 

7. If that energetic b&lt;&gt;y, iu his ad(&gt;lescence, recdve academic

honors, I am ai&gt;prelicnsive that they will prove detriineutal. That 
l)]ant is aliinental. Ilis convalescence, after suffering from an epi- 
leptic attack, an apo])lectic fit, and an epidemic, was not accidental. 
If I secure your acquiescence, my circumspection will enable mo to 
avoid his circumvention. He uses many comi)limental plirast~. 
Glory is evanescent. His faults were not fundamental, nor detri- 
mental to his business. 

8. The inattention of my predecessor was instrumental in render- 
ing him unsuccessful. Tlie inattentive youth did not understand 
your incidental remark. Can you read tliat oriental and monu- 
mental inscription? Though independent, that lady is inoffensive 
and unaffected. During the interregnum, or time in which the 
throne was vacant, the regent encouraged regimental display, and 
sanctioned retrospective laws. Christ is our intercessor with the 
omni[)resent Jehovali. That unexpected and sentimental appeal 
will move her .sympathetic heart. 

9. In that elementary and catechetical book, which is designed 
for academical classes, the subjects are arranged in alphabetical 
order. That representative employed an amanuensis to copy the 
supi)lementary part of his argumentative speech. If that remedy 
be ineffectual, asafetida will be indisi)ensable. The evangelical 
i)reacher is diametrically opposed to that rei)rehensible measure. 
Is that exegetical or explanatory remark designed to be apologetic? 
The rebellion was iri-epressible. Experimental knowledge is not 
unacceptable to unregenerate persons.

1. Tliat fertilizer will be serviceable in the garden. lie depends 
on nic rconary troops for the pernianoncy of his ride. Is that leather 
l)ernieable to water? The pcri)etrator of that deed niereifnlly

that persecutor be beaten mercilessly. 

2. lie concernedly declared that, in his adversit}&apos;, he conld not 
j)ay for an advertisement. In an emergency, they would watch 
alternately. Owing to tiie [jroverbial impertinence of the frater- 
nity Avho were conterminous with the estate, and having no other 
alternative, the ])rince determined to exterminate them, and seize 
their convertible property. She is deservedly noted for her super- 
lative beauty. He is subservient to my views. He understood 
grammar so imperfectly tliat, in his uncertainty, he did not know 
an impersonal veib. Diversify the colors of the robe. A univer- 
sal preservative would not be sui)erfluous. 

3. The jdaiits are in the conservatory. The (incstion is determ- 
inable. They fought determinat&apos;jly. India-rubber is impermeable 
to water. The imperviousness of the forest, and the unrcserved- 
ne.ss of the coniinander, caused their subserviency to his will. Dur- 
ing the anniversary week, they unreservedly condemned uiiiver- 
salism, and exi)elled a universalist from the university. 

4. He spoke cursorily of the burdensomeness of the tax. Tliey 
fought murderously. Tiie writ is returmible to-morrow. The 
preaclier enjoined taciturnity on the subject of purgatory, though 
he questions its absurdity. i

1. The act to promote sobriety, and to prevent ebriety, is botli 
advisable and desirable. There is no assignable reason for his anx- 
iety with regard to that advisory letter. No human power can 
annihilate matter. The proprietor undesignedly&quot; caused your in- 
quietude. His unsightliness, iuii)oliteness, and impiety make tlie 
advertiser despisable. Ills mind is inclinalde to truth. Society 
consider the supervisor reliable, for inviolate truth and propriety 
of conduct are dear to him. Variety in food often leads to satiety. 
Is that air respirable? Though undecided, the difference between 
tlie parties is reconcilable. A contrariety of opinions with regard 
to the notoriety of that crime is undesirable.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. The literary dignitary has great difficulty in conquering his 
dilatory habits. Tiiat intimacy witii vice leads to ignominy, is not 
disputable. That imitator found many figurative expressions in my 
miscellany. Since man is an imitative being, he should follow the 
Saviour in all his imitable conduct. The intricacy of that miser- 
able man&apos;s affairs, and his pitiable conduct render it difficult to 
take an inventory of his property. That military chief encouraged 
literature. The i)rovince was tributary to Rome. 

2. Ilis civility, benignity, ability, and activity in a contingency, 
render the general conspicuous. After the belligerent king had 
ranged his artillery on a gentle acclivity, he summoned the city 
to capitulate. His ambiguous excuse is not admissible. Do you 
notice the affinity of those articulate sounds? The artificer&apos;s agility 
enabled him to anticipate mj&apos; movement. Crocodiles arc ampliib- 
lous and carnivorous animals. The centrifugal and centripetal 
forces are called central forces. His continual avidity for food, the 
restraint his captivity jilaced upon his convivial habits, and his cu- 
pidity, which Avas tempted by property contiguous to ids estate, led 
the prince to become a conspicuous member of the conspiracy. 

3. 11&apos; fever debilitate that diminutive man&apos;s system, and produce 
delirium, I will (.-xcuse his ddiii(|uency. If that deistical writer de- 
liberate, lie will understand that definitive sentence. Will lie de- 
lineate the dui)licity of that fastidious lady? There was a divinity 
that moved our deliverer to come to our deliverance. Can he dia*

criminate primitive from derivative words? Tii.^t elliptical phrase 
i.s eciuivucal. Docility and ductility are not equivalent words. An 
epitome of that hook would facilitate his study. Tlie festivity -will 
felicitate your friend. The frigidity of the corpse proves the futil- 
ity of trying to revive it. 

4. To gesticulate in the street is not a mark of gentility. Ha- 
biliments of sorrow do not always indicate humility. Though tiie 
iniquitous municipal officers, during our imprisonment, attempted 
to intimidate our counselor, and hahituate us to indignities, they 
found us invincihle. Those indigenous plants are not injured by 
the humidity of the air. During the incipient stage of hostility, 
the insidious king tried to insinuate himself into the good graces of 
the nobility. That inquisitive itinerant should know that invid- 
ious comparisons are inimical to friendship. I trust that the 
iudge, who is attending to his legitimate judicial business in that 
magnificent hall, is unmoved by malignity. My munificent patron 
will visit the place of his nativity. 

5. That perfidious political act j)roves his moral obliquity. Ob- 
livion alone can obliterate his reproach. The Being that can orig- 
inate worlds must be omnipotent. J participate in your sorrow. 
Notwithstanding the prolixity of his ])romiscuous remarks, their 
meaning is perspicuous. His precipitous relinquishment of the 
pontifical robes, the publicity of his ofi&quot;ense, the rai)idity of his re- 
treat, and his rusticity placed the bishop in a ridiculous predica- 
ment. 

6. The satirical letter is free from scurrility. His servility is 
significant. The poet, in his solilociU}-, speaks of the vicissitudes of 
life, and his similitude to his bi-other. The solidity of the wall in- 
sures its stability. The statistical reports show the sterility of the 
soil in that vicinity. The solicitor is solicitous to conceal the sim- 
])licity of his client. The timidity and stupidity of the king insure 
tranquillity. The ventriloquist&apos;s vociferous argument on the utility 
of ventriloquism was sophistical. 

7. That that deliberate assemldy used considerable discriminative 
ability at the preliminary meeting is iiidisputable. That epistolary 
communication concerning the ejiiscopacy is uninteresting. Owing 
to his inimitable tact, and the precipitancy of his friends, the legit- 
imacy of the measure was not called in question. 

8. The Calvinistic divine questioned the jurisdiction of the pope, 
and regarded neither his benediction nor interdiction. A scientific 
man said that the calorific or heating rays of the sun often act a? a 
sudorific. Af\er an intermission of an hour, the time will be in- 
auspicious. Your recognition of the child awakens many a remi-

iiiscence. Tliat scliolar is snperficiiil. The liypocritio and the irre- 
ligious were included in his unforirivini:: malediction. 

9. The testimony is contradictory ■with regard to his capability, 
aflubility, credibility, and consanguinity. The president&apos;s want of 
equanimity, and his eccentricity, inconsistency, in^iglli^u■ance, and 
i.Tibecility will prevent the durability of the club. Much electri 
City is in the air. That individual has erysipelas. Remember tha 
man&apos;s fallibility, Avhen judging of the feasibility of his measure. 
After that indiscriminate slauglitei&apos;, the inconsiderate youth suffered 
an ignominious deatii. The insipidity of the valedictory oration is 
attributable to the multiplicity of his duties. He is Avanting in sen- 
sibili&apos;.y. The magnanimity and intrepidity of the general rendered 
his army indivisil)le and irresistible. Ilis plausibility led theiii 
to regard tlie possibility rather than the probability of success. 
Though the enemy&apos;s loss was inconsiderable, the general incon- 
sideratc^ly demanded the unconditional surrender of the fort. 

10. Tlie generalissimo (juestions his accountability to the senate. 
I doubt the applicability of the law to this case. A compatibility 
of tempers is desirable. The susceptibility of water to compressi- 
bility is slight. Sarsaparilla is a plant. His pusillanimity rendered 
his eligibility doubtful. His respectability and responsibility are 
undoubted. 

11. Impenetrability and indestructibility are two essential prop- 
erties of nuitter. The imperceplibilitv Cx a i;badow to the touch 
is easily proved. The impracticability of the measure is evident. 
Asbestus is noted for its incombustibility. The indivisibility of the 
soul is conceded. TIi3 uiconnnunicability and incomprehensibility 
of the way3 of Providence are no obstacles to ths eyo of faith. 
The uniutelligibility of that sentence is evident. 

12. Ho has the dysentery. Define a dissyllable, n, trisyllable, 
c:,nd a monosyllable. His enjoyment was emj)yreal, or lioavenly. 
Polygamy is forl)idden by Christian nations. Tho e::perimcnt was 
analytical. Does ho like metaphysics? Di:l you read the pane- 
gyric? Have yon seen hisroirlyphic writing?

Dictation Exercises. 

1. Praise liis adorable name in liarinoniuus and melodious strains. 
Be not censorious in colloquial intercourse, but use appropriate 
words. The demoniac i)hreu.sy and indecorum of this notorious 
man cast opprobrium upon liis name. The conduct of that inde- 
corous and uxorious man i « deplorable. Tlie diplomatist&apos;s diplo- 
macy is worthy of encomium, or eulogium. His belief is erroneous. 
That act is felonious. The historian&apos;s commodious house is ap- 
proachable on the south. The virtuoso took a restorative for his 
hoarseness. 

2. His acrimonious language and uncontrollable temper render 
his wife inconsolable. Tlie matrimonial rites were ceremonious. 
The editorials with i-egard to the gubernatorial duties and the ora- 
torio were excellent. Equatorial climates are warm. Spirits are 
deemed incorporeal substances. This patrimonial estate has been 
in our family from time immemorial. Owing to the servant&apos;s ir- 
reproachable life and meritorious acts, his parsimonious master 
gave him a testimonial. This territorial question renders the me- 
diatorial office important.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. The competency of the commissary to abridge the I&apos;ights ot 
the commonalty was the subject of a commentary. Tiie contro- 
versy at the monastery with regard to the profligacy of the clergy 
encouraged proselyti^m. That man, though honorable and hospi- 
table, is noted for his contumacy, or obstinacy. And is a copula- 
live conjunction. Repeat the corollary. His obduracy may prove 
monitory and profitable. Will the operative accept your promis- 
sory note? The man who occupies the solitary house on the prom- 
ontory is a voluntary exile. 

2. The compositor received an abdominal wound. 1 abominate 
an anomalous pronunciation. The accoaiplishnients of the cosmop- 
olite enable him to apologize gracefully, make due acknowledgment 
when in a fault, and accommodr^te himself to circumstances. An 
anonymous author of a late biography tries to prove, by astrouo- 
my and astrology, the Apocrypha canonical. Is tlie chronometer 
one of the fruits of clironology? If atrocity be n concomitant of 
your authority, 1 will not cooperate with you to consolidate it. To 
my astonishment, he did corroborate that doubtful news. 

3. A historical writer says: &quot;It is demonstrable that a democ- 
racy always tends to economy.&quot; Do you denominate that a de- 
monstrative argument? Notwithstanding the ferocity of that idol- 
atrous nation, a decree to depopulate and impoverish their land 
would be impolitic. If yoa intoxicate the offic&apos;r and seize his 
t-molument-s, he will sufl^er from despundenoy. My ex|)06itor un- 
derstands geography, geology, geometry, and lithogra[)hy.

4. I l)oiiglit tlio iiiiilMiir;uiy liurean in the metropolis. If the ma- 
jority favor a monopoly, tlio minority must submit. At sea, such 
a plienomenon breaks tiie monotony of the surrounding expanse. 
This learned man understands orthogra{)liy, jjhilology, philosopliy, 
stenograph}-, zoology, and theology. Knowing the predominance 
of verbosity in his style, you alone -will be responsible, if you give 
liiui ])riority in the discussion. If it be your prerogative to govern 
a child, I trust that the law of love will jirt&apos;doininate in your mind. 
Buy a thermometer and a theodolite. The rhinoceros has but one 
horn. Can you prognosticate what the velocity of the wind will 
be an hour hence? 

5. It is consolatory to know that that unprofitable business has 
not been derogatory to my cliaracter. An arsenal is a repository 
for arms. The incorrigible drunkard has an unconquerable appe- 
tite for rum. 

6. My correspondent uses allegoric language. The apostolic 
faith satisfies tlie philosophic mind. Paregoric is an economic 
anodyne. 

7. Are there anatomical plates in yonr Avork on physiology? 
Restrain your animosity toward tl)e aristocracy. That astrological 
work is a curiosity. Tiiat interrogative sentence requires a cate- 
gorical answer. Copy the cliroiiological table. Deuteronomy- 
means the second law. That It-xicograplier understands etymol- 
ogy, ))l»ysiogiiomy, physiology, and trigonometry. Tiiis periodical 
advocates the reciprocity treaty. 

8. His impetuosity caused him to lose the superiority. Meteor- 
ology treats of the atmosphere and its phenomena. His inferiority 
is conceded.

nary. Things that may be numbered are called numerable. The 
ditTiculty is superable. 

2. Thongli public evils accumulate, the judge will not be accu- 
sable. If proof be deducible from these facts, he will adjudicate 
jour claim and grant an annuity. That alluvial soil will yield an 

&apos;exuberant crop. The effluvium of the rose is ]ileasing. The on- 
tliusiast received fi gratuity. Tlie garrulity and enthusiasm of that 
communicant enabled him to impose on the credulity of the com- 
munitj-. If they communicate the story that this man&apos;s interfer- 
ence destroyed our connubial love, I will declare it confutable. 

3. If you illuminate his mind to an unusual degree, and raise

fact that God only can fill every vacuity of the soul. 

4. My coadjutor jirepared a constitution for an institution of 
learning. The destitution among the poor was caused by the dim- 
inution of contributions and the substitution of machinery for

titution of goods unjustly taken, and to prevent a revolution and 
the dissolution of Congress. 

5. Moved by the importunity of his friends and the incredulity 
of his enemies, notwithstanding the ambiguity of the language, he 
was enabled by his ingenuity and assiduity to demonstrate the in-

of the creation in the Bible. [See Genesis, chap, i.] 

10. Marks of Quotation [&quot; &apos;^] are used to sliow that 
the real or supposed words of an author, or a speaker, 
are quoted; as, Socrates said, &quot;I believe that the soul

&quot; Charity suffereth long, and is kind ; * * * * Bearetli 
all things, believeth all things, endureth all things.&quot; 

15. The Hyphen [-] is chiefly used to unite the words 
of which a compound is formed, when each of them re- 
tains its original accent ; as, I thank the all&apos;-wise&apos; God

Dictation Exercises. 

1. &quot;Twas certain he could write, and cipher too.&quot; Sin, or 
moral evil, should excite the greatest abhorrence. He, and he 
only, is worthy of our supreme atFections. Sound, sound the tam- 
bourine. Remove, expel, the blustering, blundering blockhead! 
The mind is that which knows, feels, and thinks. Honor, afflu- 
ence, and pleasure seduce the heart. The poor and ricii, and weak 
and strong, have all one Father. The twin sisters. Piety and Po- 
etry, are wont to dwell together. Speak for, not against, these 
princi[)les. He who teaches, often learns himself. The eye that 
sees all things, sees not itself. James set out early, and, before 
evening, arrived at our house. Boast not, ray dear friends, of to- 
morrow. Come hither, Moor. Shame being lost, all virtue is lost. 
Such, in general, is the aspect of the country. At the bottom of 
the garden, a little rivulet ran. When beggars die, there are no 
comets seen. Such as the tree is, such will be the fruit. Man was 
created to search for truth, to iove the beautiful, to desire what is 
good, and to do the best. 

2— i. Passion overcomes shame; boldness, fear; and madness, 
reason. Economy is no disgrace ; for it is better to live on a little 
than to outlive a great deal. Religion must be the spirit of every 
hour; but it can not be the meditation of every hour. The noblest 
propliets and apostles have been children once; lisping the speech, 
laughing the laugh, thinking the thought, of boyhood. If we think 
of glory in the field; of wisdom in the cabinet; of the purest 
patriotism; of the highest integrity, public and private, — the au- 
gust figure of Washington presents itself as the personation of all 
these ideas. Every thing grows old ; every thing passes away ; 
every thing disappears. Many words are diff&quot;erently spelled in 
Engli.?h; as. Inquire, enquire; jail, gaol; skeptic, sceptic. To 
rule one&apos;s anger is well ; to prevent it is better. Men&apos;s evil man- 
ners live in brass: their virtues we write in water. Laziness 
grows on people: it begins in cobwebs, and ends in iron chains. 
Every one must, of course, think his own opinions right; for, if he 
thought them wrong, thev would be no Ioniser bis opinions : bu»

there is a wide difference between regarding ourselves as infallible, 
and being firmly convinced of the truth of our creed. The dis- 
course consisted of two parts, in the first was shown the necessity 
«)f exercise ; in the second, the advantages that would result from it. 
J. Wm. Webb, jun., Esq., at length became M. D., A. M., A. A. S. 

5-7. Are there not seasons of sj)ring in the moral world? and is 
nt»t the present age one of them ? You say you will repent to-mor- 
row : but are you sure of to-morrow? Have you one hour in your 
liand? Have you one minute at your disposal? Away, all ye 
ghosts and fiends! to your dark and frightful domains! Alas! 
those happy days are gone! How beautiful is all this visible 
world! how beautiful in its action and itself! If you will listen, I 
will show you — but stop! I do not know that you wish to know. 
1 take — eh ! oh ! — as much exercise — eh ! — as I can. Madam Gout. 
To pull down the false and to build up the true, and to upliold 
what there is of truth in tiie old, — let this be our aim. You speak 
like a boy, — like a boy who asks for the moon. There are times — 
they only can understand who have known them — w&apos;hen passion is 
dumb, and purest love reigns. I see iu this world two heaps — one 
of hapi)iness, and the other of misery. 

8-11. Whether writing prose or verse (for a portion of the book 
IS in prose), tlie author knows both what to blot, and when to 
stop. C&apos;onsider (and may tlie consideration sink deep into your 
iieart \) the fatal conse(iueiices of a wicked life. The captain had 
several men died |\vho died] in the sliip. You must be careful 
(nothing can be well done without care) not to mistake the proper 
use of brackets. [See Pai&apos;kcr and Fox&apos;s Grammar. J &apos;&apos; Know th\-

PREFIXES.&apos; 

A Peefix is a word, or part of a word, placed before 
another to form with it a new M^ord. 

A Prefix usually changes or Increases the meaning of a word before 
■which it is placed ; as un, not, in wnholy, which means not holy ; though 
it is sometimes used to make a word more euphoniom, or agreeable in 
sound, without changing the meaning ; as un in M?iloose — loose and 
unloose meaning the same thing. 

I. SAXON OR ENGLISH PEEFISES. 

A means at, in, or on; as, afar, at a far or great distance; abed, 

in bed ; ashore, on the shore. 
Be, to male, he/ore ; as bedim, to make dim ; Jespeak, to speak (for) 

hefo7&apos;e. 
En or EM, i7i, into, on; also, to make ; as, encamp, to form into a 

camp ; enroll, to place on a roll ; enable, to make able. Em 

is another form of en ; as, embrace. 

&apos; Pupils should he required to thoroughly master the following Pre- 
fixes and Affixes ; the Teacher carefully explaining hoiv they modify or 
alter the meaning of the words here given. Short lessons should be 
assigned ; and pupils should change, for each recitation, a given number 
of primitive words, with which they are familiar, into derivatives, in- 
troducing them into sentences in such a manner as to illustrate their 
meaning and use.

in which both the correct and tlie incorrect use of prepositions shall be 
given. To illustrate the manner in whicli sentences may thus be con-
