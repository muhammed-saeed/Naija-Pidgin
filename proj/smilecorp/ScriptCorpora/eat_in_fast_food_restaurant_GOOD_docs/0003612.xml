A 32-year-old Helena man pleaded guilty Monday to stealing a
woman&apos;s credit card number while working at a local fast-food
restaurant and then using the account to make calls to phone sex
lines from work.

Robert James Clemo Jr., 32, pleaded guilty in Helena City Court
Monday to identity theft and theft of services, both
misdemeanors.

Clemo, a former employee of the now-defunct Burger King on North
Montana Avenue, took the woman&apos;s number while working at the
fast-food restaurant, according to court documents. He then used
the account to call three different phone sex lines from both the
Burger King phone and his own cell phone, racking up $425 in
bills.

City Court Judge Myron Pitch ordered Clemo to pay $425 in
restitution and $830 in fines. The judge also gave him credit for
one day served in jail along with a 359-day suspended sentence on
the two misdemeanors. Police cited Clemo on Friday for the two
charges and also on a felony charge of failure to give notice of
change of address by a violent or sexual offender.

Clemo is considered a violent offender after he was sentenced in
January 1999 for felony robbery after he, with the assistance of
his mother, robbed a Helena casino. According to court documents,
Clemo pulled a BB gun on a casino employee and walked away with
$2,900. He was sentenced to seven years in Montana State Prison,
with five suspended. Clemo is being held in the Lewis and Clark
County Detention Center in lieu of $5,000 bond for the felony
charge.
