Demand to Buy Gold Rising Amongst Central Banks, Asian Investors&amp;US Consumers as Greek Euro-Exit Rumored Again - 16 February 2012
 
Prices to Buy Gold fell further Thursday lunchtime in London, dropping towards 3-week lows beneath $1710 per ounce as the Dollar rose following a raft of positive US data, which contrasted with fresh rumours of a Greek debt default or even Eurozone exit.

The Moody&apos;s rating agency today warned it may downgrade the status of 17
 global and 114 Eurozone banks and financial services firms.

Wednesday&apos;s teleconference of European finance ministers concluded that Greece must submit itself to greater external oversight of taxes and spending if it is to receive further bail-out funds before the critical bond-repayment deadline in mid-March.

US crude oil prices meantime held near 5-week highs above $101 per barrel, while silver retreated 2.4% to its lowest level since 25th Jan. at $32.70 per ounce.

Falling earlier amid what brokers called &quot;a broader sell-off in risk assets&quot;, the price to Buy Gold fell Thursday to £1090 per ounce for UK investors, but held above €42,300 per kilo for Euro buyers.

&quot;Key support is in the $1706 area and resistance is at last week’s high around $1752,&quot; reckons the latest technical analysis from bullion bank Scotia Mocatta.

&quot;Market sentiment towards [ Buying Gold ] seems broadly bullish, but some large stops lurking above $1730 are helping to keep a lid on things,&quot; says a London dealer.

Longer-term, &quot;As a whole gold is adopting a more prominent role in the financial system,&quot; said the World Gold Council&apos;s Marcus Grubb to MineWeb this morning, launching the market-development organization&apos;s latest quarterly Gold Demand Trends report.

&quot;Central banks are [now] a key part of this market. They bought 439 tonnes last year, which is a huge move on the demand side, but they also were leasing more gold into the market...largely [to raise cash for] adding liquidity to help the European banking system.&quot;

With &quot;no end currently in sight to the woes of Greece and Italy,&quot; says the WGC&apos;s new report , &quot;ongoing difficulties in the [Eurozone] will further stimulate Gold Investment demand.&quot;

China&apos;s private demand overtook world No.1 India in the fourth quarter of 2011, the WGC&apos;s report shows, holding equal with the last 3 months of 2010 by volume while India&apos;s demand fell 42% to the lowest level since the global recession of early 2009.

France saw positive net gold investment in 2011 for the third year in a row , after being a consistent &quot;dishoarder&quot; for almost two decades.

Producing some 80 tonnes of Gold Coins , Turkey was the world&apos;s top bullion minter once again, according to the WGC&apos;s data.

On the economic front Thursday, new US jobless claims fell to a near 4-year low last week, new figures showed, while housing starts were also better than analysts forecast.

Excluding fuel and food, factory-gate prices in the US rose 3.0% year-on-year in January, compared with Wall Street estimates of 2.6%.

In contrast to US gold investment demand, which slipped 29% by value at the end of 2011, US demand to Buy Gold jewelry rose 12% in the last quarter compared with Christmas 2010, says the WGC&apos;s report, reaching $2.3bn.

But &quot;Household debt remains elevated by historical standards,&quot; says a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, &quot;and other determinants of consumer spending remain weak.&quot;

Chinese households meantime grew their demand to Buy Gold jewelry 27% by value year-on-year, spending three times as much as did US consumers.

China&apos;s physical Gold Investment demand rose 20% by value.

&quot;It will probably take some time before investors in Hong Kong fully warm up to this [ Gold ETF ] product,&quot; UBS strategist Edel Tully said today, noting lackluster demand for the financial center&apos;s new exchange-traded gold trust, which was launched on Monday.

&quot;One of the main appeals of gold in its key markets such as China and India is that it is a tangible, hard asset and easily accessible to retail consumers in physical form.

&quot;The shift from Gold Coins and bars to an exchange-traded product may take some getting used to.&quot;
