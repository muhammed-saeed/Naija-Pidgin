Introduction:
 
There are a hundred reasons why you should not stop at the bright yellow arches and eat at McDonald&apos;s. Today, this list is five great reasons for an occasional stop at America&apos;s favorite fast food restaurant.
 
Convenience

Driving through is fast and easy. There is usually a very quick run through and you can easily eat your meal on the way to somewhere else because they package it so well. It&apos;s a no brainer.
 
Taste

The food tastes good. They take great care to serve food that people enjoy and they add what ever is needed to make it taste great.
 
Price

You can eat an entire meal for around $3.00 if you work it right. It easily has enough fat and calories to carry you to the next meal. Even their gourmet items like an Angus burger with mushrooms and Swiss is reasonably priced compared to other fast food places.
 
Coffee

They have great coffee, better than any other restaurant bar none. Better than Starbucks or any other specialty coffee establishment. The price rocks. Bonus: As a Senior you can get a medium cup for $.69 but you have to ask for it.
 
Location

No matter where you are going, if its over a few miles you will probably pass a McDonald&apos;s or two or even three before you arrive.
 
 

 
Final Thoughts

McDonald&apos;s bright yellow arches are pure Americana spread &apos;round the world. It&apos;s impossible not to patronize them, because they try so hard. They have nutritional items, junk food, desserts, and great coffee. Something for everyone. A word to the wise, keep it to an occasional vist, and work hard at not ordering a hot apple pie to go with that great coffee.

Hehe, oddly enough, where I live McDonald&apos;s are few and far between. I like Jack in the Box when I crave fast food. :)

OK, so not the healthiest place to dine, but I confess I like McD&apos;s too ... had lunch there today!

Good rationalization, but I still won&apos;t be going to McDonald&apos;s any time soon.
