Do you think you should have to tip Sonic ppl?
 im serious, i mean come on all she is doing is taking 10-20 steps out the door to hand me something, i could understand if it was freezing cold or really hott, but on a normal day when all i do is go and ask for a large cherry lime-aid, why should i have to give this girl my money? its not a huge accomplishment. and ppl say well they dont get paid that much, but why should i feel bad about that when they chose that job, nobody asked them to do it. and there have been times i&apos;ll give them the money for my food but it costs $8.50 and i gave her a 10 and she said thanks and walked away and that upsets me! So do you think it should be nessasary to give the sonic girls a tip?

 ok it is not being cheap i would tipp if i ordered so big crazy off the wall order, but if i just order a burger and drink, what are they doing? nothing they walk out the door and hand it to you, when you see the bag boys at the store helping ppl to their car they dont get tipped so, why should you tip someone who just hands ya something when you cant tip someone who brings the basket to your car and then puts it all in there for you.... i dont think you should unless they are going out of their way to do so.

 I don&apos;t believe you should tip unless the waiter or waitress does their job. If they don&apos;t offer good service then they don&apos;t get tipped as good. As far as Sonic issue no she does not deserve a tip. She did the basic job she is paid to do.

I have a tip policy. Hope it will help you or someone else out. If I go to a restaurant an eat I start out with 10% tip. If my tea glass gets empty I deduct 2 percent each time. If the waiter/waitress passes the food down the table I deduct 5%. If the waiter/waitress doesn&apos;t smile or isn&apos;t friendly I deduct 3%. If the food isn&apos;t good I call for the manager and the waiter/waitress gets 10% they can&apos;t help the food. I have left a note for a waitress saying that she owed me money and left.

 First, unless you say&quot;keep the change&quot;they should offer you change and the manager should be told if this happens.

Second, though, if you can afford to eat out you probably can afford a small tip. People in low paying service jobs are not doing well and may not be able to afford to eat where they work or stay in the hotels and resorts that employ them. If you have an opportunity you should tip.

If you can afford a big tip, you just may save a person from some really big financial problem.

Random acts of kindness can save the world, or at least make you feel really really good.

Being cheap probably has the opposite effect.

 I think it depends on how much they make. If they&apos;re only paid 1/2 of minimum wage, like a normal waitress, I think maybe you should. But if they get at least minimum, it&apos;s up to you.

BTW...Tips used to be given before the meal. It stands for :To Insure Proper Service

 I think if the girl was nice to you and your order was right then $1 would be good enough. And if it is cold, then $2 is just fine. They should be the last one to check your order before it comes out to you to make sure it is right.

 Ya, she definitely shouldn&apos;t have assumed that she&apos;d get a tip, let alone almost 20% for taking 20 steps.

I don&apos;t think that you should have to tip if you don&apos;t want to.

That aside, I usually do try to help people working at restaurants, whether it be Sonic, or like a Chili&apos;s to go, or whoever. But that&apos;s just me.

Do what feels right. If he/she does a great job and you like the service, give her the change or a buck or something. She&apos;ll feel better; you&apos;ll feel better. The world will be at peace. ;-)

 YOU FREAKING CHEAPSKATE! Yes you tip at a drive in restaurant. Ask your grandparents (or someone older than your parents) if they tipped at drive in restaurants.

 Well think of it this way, you could walk those 10 or 20 steps yourself and give her nothing to save yourself the dollar. . . .Nobody is forcing you, just drive through, and then you don&apos;t have to tip anyone. They are providing you a service, there is no reason to not tip them, the same way you would tip another server.

 It would be a different conversation if she walked away with my money, fastfood restaurants piss me off the way they expect a tip, in my opinion unless it&apos;s a nice place tips are something the customer should decide

 No. They just have a different type up drive up. And plus it&apos;s just fast food. You wouldn&apos;t tip the guy at Taco Bell or Wendy&apos;s would you?

 Wow I can&apos;t believe they didn&apos;t make change. That&apos;s crazy.

Usually I only have a credit card and I was told they only take cash tips anyway so I usually just play it off that I don&apos;t have cash. I usually give them the change though if paying with cash. If I really don&apos;t feel like dealing with the tip I go through the drive through window.

Sometimes on the weekends they have charities vollenteer and serve for tips only for their charities. Then, you should definatly tip.

 NO! That is like Applebee&apos;s carside to go. All they do is take the order and bring it out. At some McDonalds if there is a long line they will bring it to your car, but they don&apos;t expect a tip.
It is FAST FOOD, and no service (for the most part) therefore not deserving of a tip. If they want one, tell em&apos;to go to a real restaurant.

 If you gave a Sonic employee $10.00 for a $8.50 meal, and without telling them you want change back, then I guess they just assume the remaining is a tip. If it were me, I would complain. Tell the manager unless you specifiy the $1.50 is a tip - then they should automatically give you your change. That was completely wrong of the employee to take your money, tell you thanks and walk away.

 I usually do. It&apos;s a small price to pay to make someone&apos;s day a little better. The way I look at it, there is another human being who is waiting on me, so they deserve a little show of thanks. We all know that fast food workers don&apos;t make super-high wages.
