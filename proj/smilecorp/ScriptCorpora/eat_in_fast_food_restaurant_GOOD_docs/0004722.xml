		The Fast Food Diet 
Want fast-food options that won&apos;t blow your 1,500-calorie-a-day diet? 
 It can be done -- if you follow what I call the 3-4-5 program. Eat 300 
 calories at breakfast, 400 at lunch, 500 at dinner, plus 300 anytime 
 for snacks. I&apos;ve chosen suitable meals from fast-food chains across 
 the country. By working these into your 1,500-calorie diet, you can 
 have it your way -- and lose weight. 
 

 300-Calorie Breakfasts 
Rise-and-shine meals that will make your morning -- really! 

 McDonald&apos;s: Plain English muffin (150 calories) plus two scrambled 
 eggs (160 calories), Egg McMuffin (300 calories) or Sausage Breakfast 
 Burrito (290 calories).

Burger King: Croissan&apos;wich with Egg and Cheese (350 calories). Skip 
 the sausage option on this one; the meat adds another 260 calories.

Subway: Western Egg Breakfast Sandwich (300 calories). Note that all 
 breakfast sandwiches are between 300 and 350 calories -- a touch high, 
 but not bad.

Arby&apos;s: Biscuit with butter (280 calories), sourdough with ham (220 
 calories) or croissant with ham (310 calories).

Rule of thumb: Bread and eggs are fast-food breakfast staples. Avoid 
 bacon and extras, and the choices will still fit into your diet plan. 

 

 400-Calorie Lunches 
Two dozen ways to get your midday energy boost.

McDonald&apos;s: Chicken McGrill (400 calories) or four Chicken McNuggets 
 plus a small fries (420 calories total).

Burger King: Four Chicken Tenders and a small fries (400 calories 
 total). Or, for 50 calories less, swap the fries for a small order 
 of onion rings.

Wendy&apos;s: Large Chili with Cheddar cheese and saltines (395 calories) 
 or Grilled Chicken Sandwich (300 calories) and side salad with low-cal 
 dressing (125 calories).

Subway: Any&quot;7 Under 6&quot;sandwich (230 to 320 calories), 
 Subway&apos;s Select Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki Sandwich (380 calories) 
 or Subway&apos;s Select Red Wine Vinaigrette Club Sandwich (350 calories). 
 But watch out: The moment you add mayo, oil, or cheese, the calorie 
 count starts climbing.

Dairy Queen: Grilled chicken sandwich (310 calories) or DQ Homestyle 
 cheeseburger (340 calories). Stay away from the fries: At 350 calories 
 for a small order, they&apos;re over 100 calories more than McDonald&apos;s 
 and Burger King fries.

Taco Bell: Two soft tacos with chicken (190 calories per taco), two 
 soft tacos with beef (210 calories per taco) or taco salad with salsa, 
 without the shell (420 calories). Be very wary of the burritos: The 
 plain bean burrito is a healthy 370 calories, but the Grilled Stuft 
 Beef Burrito takes a giant leap up to 730 calories! Generally, the 
 simpler the dish, the fewer the calories.

KFC: Tender Roast Sandwich without sauce (260 calories), Tender Roast 
 Sandwich with sauce (390 calories) or individual Popcorn Chicken (450 
 calories). Steer clear of the&quot;classic&quot;KFC meals: One Original 
 Recipe fried drumstick is 140 calories, and one wing is 150. And you&apos;ve 
 got to ask yourself: When&apos;s the last time anyone ate just one wing?

Arby&apos;s: Regular Roast Beef sandwich (350 calories) or Light Grilled 
 Chicken sandwich (280 calories). Careful with the curly fries: A small 
 order starts at 310 calories -- more than the entire chicken sandwich!

Boston Market: Marinated grilled chicken (230 calories per breast) 
 with new potatoes (130 calories) or quarter-pound skinless white-meat 
 chicken (170 calories) with butternut squash (150 calories). Look 
 out for the Chunky Chicken Salad -- it sounds healthy, but at 480 
 calories per three quarters of a cup, it&apos;s a little bit of bird for 
 a lot of calories.

Pizza Hut: Two slices of Thin &apos;n Crispy Cheese Pizza (200 calories 
 per slice). The golden rule of pizza eating: Thinner crust and fewer 
 toppings equal fewer calories (except vegetable toppings, which are 
 virtually calorie free). 

 

 500-Calorie Dinners 
Satisfying -- and slimming -- end-of-day meals.

McDonald&apos;s, Burger King or Wendy&apos;s: Plain hamburger, small fries (kid-size 
 at Wendy&apos;s) and a diet drink (530 calories total). Don&apos;t be fooled 
 by&quot;healthy fish&quot;choices. Burger King&apos;s BK Big Fish Sandwich 
 is 565 calories! (For the record, the Original Whopper is 710 calories.)

Taco Bell: Go for the 7-Layer Burrito (530 calories), Cheese Quesadilla 
 (490 calories) or try the Nachos Supreme (450 calories).

Arby&apos;s: Beef &apos;n Cheddar sandwich (480 calories). Skip the side orders 
 here -- most are too caloric to fit into your diet plan.

Pizza Hut: Three slices with reduced-fat cheese (500 calories). It 
 may not be on the menu, but they can do it -- just ask.

KFC: Original Recipe Chicken breast and a serving of mashed potatoes 
 with gravy (500 calories total).

Boston Market: Meat loaf (310 calories) with potato salad (200 calories) 
 or Marinated Grilled Chicken sandwich (470 calories, without mayo). 
 Warning: Add in mayo, and whoosh -- the calorie count rises to 670. 
 And adding cheese (as in the Meat Loaf and Cheese Sandwich) ups the 
 count to 730 calories. 

 

 Caveats for Calorie Counters 

When you&apos;re in a fast-food restaurant, everything is tempting. But 
 beware of the following:

Condiments -- From mayo to salad dressings, these add major calories.

Croutons (a.k.a. deep-fried caloric wasteland) -- Innocent-sounding 
 but lethal to your waistline.

Diet destroyers -- Boston Market&apos;s Turkey Bacon Club couldn&apos;t be that 
 bad, right? Wrong! At 770 calories, it&apos;s a dieter&apos;s nightmare. Avoid 
 caloric sticker shock by asking for the nutritional info beforehand.

Liquid (wasted) calories -- Research shows that juice and soda don&apos;t 
 fill you up; drink water or diet beverages instead.

&quot;Supersize&quot;portions -- Don&apos;t be a victim of portion distortion. 
 If you supersize any of the choices listed here, calories skyrocket.
