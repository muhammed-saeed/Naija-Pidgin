		Zero Tolerance
 Political correctness displaces common sense 
 

 Zero Tolerance for 
guns is not about school safety, it is 
about gun control . Zero Tolerance 
for bullies is not about school safety, it is about legitimizing and 
promoting homosexuality . Zero 
Tolerance in general seems to be mechanism used by teachers 
and school administrators to escape the burden of tough decisions, avoid charges of 
favoritism, and let the local police do their dirty work.

By refusing to consider each individual&apos;s personal history and the intentions that inspired 
their actions, zero tolerance policies deny the unique worth and dignity of every 
person. * 

If public schools have become so dangerous, and if guns, knives, drugs and inappropriate touching are such
great problems that the administrators have had to resort to these measures, then it is time to
take your kids out of the public school system.  Private schools are expensive, 
and home schooling is 
a lot of work, but it is a viable option for many families.

 Introduction:  

A &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy is one that enacts harsh punishment for any violation of school 
rules, without exceptions and without any consideration of mitigating 
circumstances. * 

There are many cases surfacing, all over the country, in which Zero Tolerance has 
trumped common sense. An eight-year-old was suspended from school for 
three days, for pointing a breaded chicken finger at a teacher 
and saying &quot;Pow, pow, pow.&quot; Two eight-year-olds were charged with 
&quot;making terrorist threats&quot; because they were playing cops and robbers with 
a paper gun. And the list goes on and 
on. Someone at the Rutherford Institute stated it well: &quot;By refusing to consider each individual&apos;s personal 
history and the intentions that inspired their actions, zero tolerance policies deny 
the unique worth and dignity of every person.&quot; 1  Zero
Tolerance policies put teachers and principals in the position of having to make 
irrational decisions in relatively simple cases. It makes no sense to 
suspend children for playing cops-and-robbers on the playground or giving a 
cough drop to a friend. 2
