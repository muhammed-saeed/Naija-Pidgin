Charlie Sheen -- Fast Food Boss ... for Friend&apos;s Video
 7/8/2011 12:25 AM PDT BY TMZ STAFF Charlie Sheen -- Fast Food Boss ... for Friend&apos;s Video If you&apos;ve missed seeing Charlie Sheen act -- watching him play a fast food restaurant manager in a rap music video ... probably won&apos;t help.

 

Charlie played the role in &quot;Steak and Mashed Potatoes&quot; for free -- as a favor to his pals Simon Rex and Jack Splash -- who recorded the song as the rap duo Chain Swangaz .  2 Live Crew member Brother Marquis was also featured on the track and in the video.

We&apos;re told it was shot about a year ago when it was still smooth sailing on &quot; Two and a Half Men &quot; -- and ironically ... in the video Charlie plays the kinda hard-ass boss he accused Chuck Lorre of being.

The song is ... umm ... enjoy Charlie&apos;s performance.

Seriously, I wouldn&apos;t let him anywhere near my food, my drink, my toilet, or my dog. With where he&apos;s been he has to have every STD known to humankind and probably even a few that are reserved for the animal kingdom.

Back in 2008 a &apos;highly popular&apos; CW announcer told me &quot;We are going to make your life so difficult that you will NEVER get a job. Get used to saying &apos;would you like fries with your order&apos;. True to their word, that bunch has made my life oooooooooh so interesting. It is a great thing I have a long memory. Good luck Charlie, I don&apos;t think you need to worry unlike many still looking for jobs.

We&apos;re pretty sure it started as a joke ... but now that Charlie Sheen seems into it -- could he be the next &quot;American Idol&quot; judge? We think it&apos;s not the worst idea ever.Plus, Daniel Tosh apologizes for spewing rape jokes at a female heckler during a stand-up gig! Did Tosh cross…
