What jobs do illegal immigrants do that Americans won&apos;t?
 I stay out of here because of the unreasoning hatred that fills the topic. But I&apos;ve come up with a few, and I wonder how many others you can think of.

Spraying herbicides and pesticides without protection.
Demolition of old buildings filled with lead and asbestos, and carrying off the debris without a mask.
Painting and sand blasting and other construction work without protection.

In fact, any job that it would be illegal to perform without OSHA-approved protection is commonly handed off to people who don&apos;t understand the language well enough to realize that they are putting their lives at risk. They aren&apos;t&quot;real&quot;people, are they? That seems to be the thinking, at any rate.

Any others?

 Ruby, in order to qualify for welfare, you are fingerprinted and your identity checked. While a very few illegals might sneak through, most who try would be deported. Illegals do NOT fill up the welfare rolls!

 katsu, my source is three guys who now work with my son. All three were once illegal, but are now legal, and making approximately 5 times more money.

My son did once happen to work in a slaughterhouse, though. I think he lasted three days.

 Jesi, Hooray for you! (I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m saying this) Hooray for OSHA! As you can tell by reading some responses, many Americans are more than happy to employers kill off illegals. Hooray for anyone who saves another person&apos;s life!

 Davie, you wrote,&quot;So they&apos;re putting legalized citizens in america in poverty. thanks to people like you.&quot;I am in no way responsible for the behavior of others! MY poverty was caused by 5 years of illness in my immediate family, and the poverty of the citizens I know mainly came from Mom being too poorly trained to support her children after a divorce. But even if illegals caused it, it sure as hell isn&apos;t my fault! I&apos;ve NEVER hired an illegal (or a citizen, for that matter.)

 The illegal’s want the jobs that pay $5.15 and hour. They will even take them for less pay. It’s not the tasks or the job duties that are at issue in this question. It is the amount of money that these jobs pay. If picking tomatoes paid 100K a year, American college’s graduates would be clamoring to stand in the fields all day long. On the other hand, if the top pay for lawyers for $6.50 an hour, (with no over time) no one would touch that job.

We American are funny. We want our hamburgers to cost .99 cents. But the only way to achieve that is to pay the people who pick the lettuce and tomatoes slave wages. If we start paying American 50K a year to work in the slaughter houses, and 60K a year to pick vegetables, guess what your local burger is gonna cost.

If you are willing to pay 10.99 for that BIG MAC, then more power to you. You have the right to complain about the illegal alien problem.

But if you love the .99 cent menu at the local fast food restaurant then sit down and shut up and let the illegal immigrants do what they came here to do.

 Asker&apos;s Rating: Asker&apos;s Comment: I wish I could have given 2 BAs. Jesi shows that even the US g&apos;vmt recognizes that these people do jobs that can kill them, and at wages that keep goods prices low.&quot;Shoot&apos;em at the border&quot;won&apos;t fix the problem.

 It&apos;s not that legals are not willing to do the job, they just want fair pay for hazards.Illegals have very little choice of taking jobs.there outlook is take what is best right now because they need to survive today, if something better comes the next day,then they take it.Most safety equipment is provided by the employer and the employer has the legal obligation to make sure all employees are safe.Not everyone follows those rules,just like the illegals don&apos;t follow rules as well.

I voted for the guy with the burger statement for best vote,because he made a very good point.

 They WANT those jobs to show a paycheck that is small enough to qualify for WELFARE with their stolen ID card!! They get the cash under the table, and it&apos;s not reported, can&apos;t be traced. If they show too much income on their checks they will have to pay for food, housing, medical, all out of their paychecks. They make a real good wage with the paychecks, the cash AND the WELFARE.

LazlaHollifield - Welfare recipients DO NOT get fingerprinted. Some counties may be more strict than others, but I have NEVER heard of them getting fingerprinted. I hope they do SOMETHING so illegals won&apos;t continue to get welfare. But, they don&apos;t do that yet.

 That&apos;s bull, companies get fined for not following OSHA guidelines , if the get caught they are no longer a company . The idea behind this is as long as those company&apos;s don&apos;t have to pay the going price for those jobs they will hire someone who will work for less . and really end up paying more . I have seen it first hand on the gold mines around my area that these people are not taking the&quot;crap&quot;jobs they claim to be here for . They wont even take them and even if the boss can get them to work for a nickle less 18.70 an hour as apposed to 18.75 under the table of untaxed income , how the hell do you think these people drive the new 8 and 10 cylinder pick up they rife around in with 20 thousand dollars worth of extras so they can have shiny tired , there last name written across the windshields . All those jobs you suggested contract for a high paying job , don&apos;t look at the workers look at the business owners , there the ones screwing the United States by not hiring citizens first ..............you have been seriousely blind sided if you dont see that

 Working in slaughterhouses and meat packing plants.
Working in car washes and fast food places.

I am opposed to illegal immigration, but someone has to do these jobs. Perhaps we should do what the Danes do. Permit laborers to enter the country and then send them home when the job is complete. Denmark has 0 immigration. They allow no foreigners to migrate to their country.

 I live in South Georgia where a lot of farms use illegal workers, one of the biggest farms I know of decided to try and see if they could get the job done with out illegals, they put an ad in the paper for farm jobs paying 9/hr. Only about 10 people applied and out of them none were willing to work out in the heat all day with only a few breaks, they all thought the job would be inside in the factory. So it looks like the americans are not willing to do that job.

 I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m thinking field work mainly, but they work EVERYWHERE. In college the kids would work at bars and restaurants, clubs (they had student visa but not legal to work). I suppose maid/housekeeper. But mainly field work...

I don&apos;t think its the jobs per se, but the MONEY paid. Illegals coming from making $1 per hour to $3 or $4 is a big deal. I live in the Bahamas and not too long ago our minimum wage was $1.50 per hour (like 5 years ago) it&apos;s now $4.00

 I&apos;m an OSHA outreach trainer and have been asked to conduct OSHA 10 hour classes for the illegal day workers. OSHA gets together a few trainers and they go to a location where day workers gather. Rather than work that day the dayworker gets $20 plus lunch for their day and we give them the training.

We try to get workers to think safety to protect themselves. OSHA realizes that this problem won&apos;t be going away anytime soon and the workers need at least basic awareness.

 Where is your source,where are your facts? I can say anything I want to but if I don&apos;t offer a source of indisputable facts it wont fly on here.
I don&apos;t see anyone doing those jobs you describe as done by illegals ,being done by anyone without the proper equipment.They are very well paid jobs that require a lot of specialized skill and tools.We bought a home in Oklahoma,as an investment,.that was 114 years old ,it had lead paint and asbestos in it .And it cost us $50,000. to have it removed and disposed of .There were no illegals employed on that job.
The most commonly refered to jobs are ,picking veggies ,fruit,working on farms etc .The reason Americans don&apos;t want those jobs is because of the low pay.They cant live on the wages that the illegals will work for.They don&apos;t live all crowded into one apt.or house and not have anything.If those jobs paid a living wage for Americans they could and would be filled.There are many people that love working out side.Get your facts straight before you make statements without sources.
This has nothing to do with racism to me its about the legality of the immigrants.and the negative effect it has on the USA.
I see lots of Americans working at fast food places and car washes,and the slaughter houses pay very good money for varies types of skills .I live in Arizona and we have been invaded by way too many illegals,but if you don&apos;t hire them they will stop coming.The company&apos;s don&apos;t need training for illegals,they need to STOP hiring illegals.Problem solved.
I will gladly pay more for my food and produce if it will stop the flow of illegals to this country.it would all be relative because if Americans did those jobs and made a living wage they could afford any increases in prices that came from it.

Although illegal immigrants are ineligible for welfare, food stamps and other public service programs, they can obtain them by using false identification papers. It&apos;s a big business and not difficult to create an identity for this purpose.

 There are plenty of&quot;legal&quot;americans that will do this work, the real question is why are the companies that employ illegals unwilling to pay the prevailing wage for such hazardous work?
