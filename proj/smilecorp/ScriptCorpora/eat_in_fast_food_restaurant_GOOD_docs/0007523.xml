Fast food fight: Crazed woman wrecks restaurant after saying workers spat in her burger

This is the shocking video of an enraged woman attacking Burger King staff after she said they had spat in her food.

Tara Lyons, 38, told sheriffs in Miami that she started throwing food at staff after she thought they had deliberately tampered with her $1.06 breakfast sandwich.

In the low quality security camera shots, Lyons can be seen shouting at staff before pushing a tray of food over the counter.
 
Attack: At first Tara Lyons appears to be just talking to staff at the store...
 

 
...however very quickly she starts throwing food and pushing her tray towards staff
 

 
...before then climbing over the counter and threatening staff
 
As the woman grows even more angry, she attempts to climb over the counter.

A brave member of staff then pushes heavy set Lyons to the ground before running out of a back door.

Lyons is then seen throwing condiments and pushing over a coffee machine.

Leaving the store she then apparently returned, finally clambering over the counter to chase the fleeing employee.

Grabbing a cup of scalding water she then chased several cooks out the back of the store.

When police arrived, diners had all but fled the restaurant.

Employees were apparently so scared they barricaded themselves in back rooms while the cooks had to hide on a nearby bus.


Lyons has been charged with assault and battery and burglary.
