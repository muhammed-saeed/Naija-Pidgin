Plummer River Rally
 Monday, August 9, 2010 
 By Nick Schneider , Assistant Editor Jim Lawson took some time at the Plummer River Rally on Saturday to add some pinstripes to his motorcycle. The Rally started Thursday night and continued into Sunday in Washington Township. 
 (Photos by Shad Cox) [Order this photo] The inaugural Plummer River Rally was this past weekend with a smaller-than-expected crowd.
Exact attendance figures were not released, but co-promoter Luke Gechtman said it was less than 3,500 for the four-day motorcycle rally event.
Also during the weekend two men were taken to Greene County General Hospital following a fight.
 Comedian Joe DeVito performed at the Plummer River Rally on Friday and Saturday nights. [Order this photo] &quot;We didn&apos;t have as many people as we wanted, but as far as I&apos;m concerned it was a success. Every single person I talked too -- our EMT crews, our vendors, they all said everybody would return. The atmosphere was great,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&apos;t have one negative comment from any one person that I talked too. The sound guy and every band said the stage was awesome.
&quot;All of the vendors who have done rallies for years said the potential was there. They said within the next year or two it&apos;s going to be unreal. They said we had awesome entertainment, and the atmosphere, everything was great and it all has he makings of being a great rally.&quot;
Gechtman told the Greene County Daily World that plans are under way for a second motorcycle rally event next year.
 Shane Kendall of Linton &quot;burns out&quot; at the Plummer River Rally on Saturday. [Order this photo] He also said the 240-acre Washington Township site just off of County Road 350W could be the location for future entertainment venues, like a bluegrass event.
&quot;I got cards from people who are promoters who said it would be a shame to only use this stage one time a year and they want to try to get us together and promote other music festivals ... at different random weekends throughout the year. They said it&apos;s just too nice of a facility to only use once a year. We&apos;re going to do that. We have too. There is no use to let it sit when it could be making some money for us.&quot;
Prior to the event, Gechtman, of rural Bloomfield and his partner, Matt York, of Lyons, had a 60 feet by 30 feet main stage that features a 40 feet by 12 feet walkout built. They also constructed a ticket booth and installed water lines and electrical service at the leased site.
 Rumor Factor performed at the Plummer River Rally. [Order this photo] Gechtman noted there was a fight and two individuals were taken to Greene County General Hospital in Linton for treatment of injuries.
Greene County Sheriff Terry Pierce said his department was only involved in one incident, a stabbing with a knife that resulted from a fight at about 10:15 p.m. on Saturday near the campsites.
Alcide W. Dagley, 39, of Greene County, faces a preliminary charge of battery with a deadly weapon -- a class C felony.
He is alleged to have stabbed Chris Whitfield, no age given, multiple times with a lock blade knife, according to a probable cause affidavit filed by Greene County Sheriff&apos;s Department Det. George Dallaire.
Whitfield was treated for a puncture or laceration to his left ear, a laceration to his left shoulder, a scratch on his right chest area. Dagley received treatment in the emergency room for a broken nose, a swollen right eye, cut lip and two cuts on the back of his left forearm, according to the court document.
Det. Dalaire noted that both men had been drinking alcoholic beverages prior the fight that was allegedly between Dagley and Billy Ogden.
Whitfield is alleged to have been attempting to break up the fight when the confrontation with Dagley unfolded.
&quot;I think it (the rally) was pretty peaceful. That was the only call I (the Greene County Sheriff&apos;s Department) received about it (the rally),&quot; Pierce said.
The rally, which was open to anyone 18 years old and older, started Thursday afternoon and continued until Sunday.
Greene/Sullivan County based band, Philpot, won the Battle of Bands Contest staged on Thursday to earn a place on the headliner show card Saturday night. Philpot followed national act Seven Mary Three to the stage to close out the entertainment part of the four-day entertainment card near the banks of the west fork of the White River.
A three-hour bike rally on Saturday drew about 30 participants and raised money for the Multiple Sclerosis Society and the American Legion Riders Veteran&apos;s Assistance Fund.
Gechtman said while it was hot and humid, it turned out to be what he called a &quot;perfect weekend for camping out.&quot; © Copyright 2010 Greene County Daily World . All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

I wonder how many people attended? Does anyone know?

How about a report on the Saturday night activities that filled up the hospital ER ?
 -- Posted by OldMurph on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 9:47 AM 
Wow OldMurph obviously you weren&apos;t there or know what you are talking about there were two people that went to the hospital I think someones imagination has gotten a little out of hand! The Plummer River Rally was a wonderful time, lots of good people, good food and good entertainment. Can&apos;t wait till next years. They did a great job putting this event on, lots of people worked really hard around the clock to make sure everyone enjoyed themselves.
 -- Posted by Proud2beme on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 9:58 AM 
Proud2beme you must have a short term memory.As a direct witness to the E&gt;R&gt; admits and the explanations....well then what say ye now.
 -- Posted by sergeantmajor on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 10:23 AM 
yes at least one guy was cut and one was beat up, one was from odon .
 -- Posted by mamason on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 10:43 AM 
well I heard they lost money on this event? people where coming in and living shortly after getting there. I talked to several who said it was a joke and would never go back, said their biggest complant was the roads getting there. and the prices after getting there. they said nothing was laid out right, to much space in between everything? and that the security sucked, two people stabbed and one beaten up. LOL knew it was going to happen
 -- Posted by halfsize on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 11:35 AM 
That was the first one put on.. Give me a break its trial and error. I was there Saturday and it was alot of fun. Sure there is things that need to be change and Im sure they will change them next year.
 -- Posted by BABY GIRL 3 on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 12:22 PM 
security was a joke! and i heard around 2000 people were there!
 -- Posted by really29 on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 12:24 PM 
They needed 3500 people to break even, according to the organizers, and they had less than 500 people show up.
 -- Posted by Try-Common-Sense on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 12:48 PM 
I think alot of people were afaid of it being like the boogie and thats why most people did not go. Like too much boobs and beer.
 -- Posted by frog976 on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 1:09 PM 
Nothing like a bunch of Rumor Mills! 2 went to the ER. Maybe people could have found out the truth about things before they start writing on here. halfsize, is that the size of the brain you used to make these statements not knowing first hand? As far as Security, people had fun without someone in there face all the time. The people that went to the ER had their problems away from everyone at a campsite while a concert was going on and security was concentrated at the stage. And family disagreements were the other issues. So, unless you have something you found out first hand to say, keep it to your self people.
 -- Posted by iowp66 on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 1:15 PM 
There was more security than meets the eye. Most of the security roamed in plain clothes and communicated with cell phones. Do not judge what you don&apos;t know. You cannot have secuirty standing at every campsite. 2 fights and one guy dropped his bike, really seems like a lot of ER.

&quot;Like too much boobs and beer.&quot;
Hello! Motorcycle Rally!!!
Sorry NO Knitting allowed!
 -- Posted by Proud Vet on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 1:20 PM 
Forgot, one lady ripped her toenail and went to hospital.
One guy overshot the roadway in his car because of the Fog, not sure if he went to get checked out.
I guess that makes 4-5 over 4 days, would be pretty busy at Greene County ER.
 -- Posted by upseventh on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 1:25 PM 
Have to laugh about the arguing over how many went to the ER.
Some will defend the party at all costs, and some will rip it apart.
 -- Posted by BloomburgBanter on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 1:27 PM 
The reviews on their website and facebook pages say the opposite from alot of the comments posted here. They are from people that ACTUALLY attended the event.
 www.plummerriverrally.com , check out the guestbook
check out the facebook page, Plummer River Rally
I can say as a volunteer over the weekend the first year is always a trial/error with any business adventure. As for loosing money, I am not sure how anyone can say that especially if they are knowledgable in business. I am not sure if they did or didn&apos;t but with any business it takes time to grow. I am sure they have learned alot and have ideas/plans already in the works for next year to improve.
I think what they are doing is good for the community overall and I wish them well!
 -- Posted by 1st lady on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 1:28 PM 
Nothing like the Boogie, pretty tame compared to other Rallys
 -- Posted by upseventh on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 1:32 PM 
unless you were there how could you no what went on.. o i forgot this is bloomfield, let the rumors fly...
 -- Posted by brt.1 on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 1:37 PM 
ya know for a bike rally with as many ppl that were there it went really good and u cant drive arount every 5 minutes to shine a light on ppl that are camping away from everything and if u were there u had a good time and if u werent then dont judge i bet if u ask the guy that got cut he was havin a good time till the whole fight started !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 -- Posted by biggun on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 1:51 PM 
I am sure Greentucky ER keeps records, check them out. Then talk smack.
Did you expect the National Guard with M16&apos;s at every tent to keep Adults from hurting themselves? Maybe hold their hands and skip through the field. You cannont expect that at any large event. What kinda security do you have in a bar? How many end up in ER from bar fights every weekend? For that matter, what kind of security do you have in a grocery store or Church?
 -- Posted by upseventh on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 1:53 PM 
i was there and i had an AWSOME TIME
 -- Posted by biggun on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 1:57 PM 
&quot;Like too much boobs and beer.&quot;
Personally, I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s possible. I&apos;ll continue to investigate though...
 -- Posted by JW on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 2:35 PM 
I was at this event from Thursday until Sunday. Luke and Matt put on a great weekend. This event will only grow with time. Thanks to everyone that put on this event. If you were not there you don&apos;t know what you were missing. Nice facility, great vendors and awesome music.
 -- Posted by riverrally on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 3:01 PM 
really for a bike rally i didn&apos;t see to many boobs, and i didn&apos;t have the first beer...or anything ealse. before you judge this try going to a few events like it. at least someone is trying to do something around here, rather than sit back and complain.
 -- Posted by brt.1 on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 3:10 PM 
If less then five hundred showed up then who were all the people back at the stage during the concerts while others were partying at their campsites and others were eating at the vendor stands? There was plenty of security but they are not there to babysit. If you want to know what goes on then I guess you need to go next year because obviously the people making the negative comments were not there. It was a great time and great people any time you have that many people there are going to be some problems especially when people are drinking.
 -- Posted by Proud2beme on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 3:20 PM 
With any kind of entertainment there will be those who like it, and those who don&apos;t. But it would be better if those who didn&apos;t like it just keep quiet. Opinions will always differ, if it is not your cup of tea, leave the rest of us alone. These guys worked their butts off to make something special, and they got off to a great start for their first year....And as far as having music out there more often, I welcome it!
 -- Posted by Rokker on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 3:32 PM 
Hi Proud2beme - It so happens that I was at the Greene County Hospital Saturday night -- at about 11:00 or a bit after, there were three ambulances, two sheriff cars, and at least 10 folks in the ER parking area being interviewed by deputies -- I was just curious about what happened -- sorry if you thought that was an insult or based on rumors, but I was there :-)I actually thought it may have been an accident --
 -- Posted by OldMurph on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 4:17 PM 
99.99% of the people around Greene County have no idea what it takes to plan and promote an event on the same scale as the River Rally or Linton Music Festival even though in comparison to most events, they are extremely small-scale.
It might surprise you to know that there&apos;s not a while lot of money to be made in event promotion.
In 2007, LiveNation produced over 22,000 live events, brought in just over $4.2 Billion in total revenue and had a net income for that year of just under -$12 million. Yes, that&apos;s negative $12 million.
Event promotion is a huge gamble and these guys really put themselves out there to put on the rally. They would have been better off financially to either put all that money on a roulette table or put a few grand in a pile and set it on fire.
Naysayers: please close your mouths and don&apos;t worry about what happened at the Rally. Big events like this in general are good for the county from an economic standpoint. They bring in a lot of outside money as well as promote the area. Bikers can be tourists too!
So a few people went to the ER... at least the hospital made a little money from it. How many kids go out on stretchers during high school football games? No one seems to be putting a stop to that.
There is a need for events like PRR, you don&apos;t HAVE to go. It wasn&apos;t my taste, so I didn&apos;t attend, but I appreciate what the guys down there are doing.
 -- Posted by krebstar on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 4:25 PM 
Dam I missed it! se ya next year,sounds like we got a lot of haters on this one.
 -- Posted by xdrill on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 4:36 PM 
I don&apos;t condone the &apos;boobs and beer&apos; thing, but it sounds to me as if it was rather quiet for a &apos;bike rally&apos;. I really wouldn&apos;t know, as that&apos;s not my thing, but I really do think people should check their facts before they start mouthing off.
I would think it would take a lot of commitment, time and effort to pull this off.
I really don&apos;t think those guys have anything to do with how bad the roads into the place are. You might want to speak with the Greene County Commissioners about that.
Police only called once? I would think that was very good.
 -- Posted by Sue62 on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 5:54 PM 
OK WELL I WAS THERE BOTH FRIDAY AND SAT NITE I SEEN NO FIGHTS AND EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE HAVING THE BEST TIME EVER.......GREAT JOB YORKS FAMILY AND EVERYONE THAT HELPED OUT.....I DEFINATELY WILL BE BACK NEXT YEAR FOR YOU HALFSIZE......YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT U OBVIOUSLY WASNT THERE....AND FOR THE ONES WHO LEFT EARLY....YOUR LOSE!!!!!! IT WAS A ROCKING GREAT TIME ALL BANDS ROCKED AND EVERYONE GOT ALONG GREAT........ANGIE DHAHIR
 -- Posted by polkadot on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 6:08 PM 
Plummer River Rally, in my opinion, was a great success!! No attendance wasn&apos;t as high as expected but for a first year I think it went great. I was there all three days, and as a person who volunteered their time, everything was handled professionally. The entertainment for all three nights was outstanding.
To the people who like to pass judgement, PRR was at least a great attempt at bringing a little economic and cultural help to this dying county.
Although bikers in general seem to bring a negative opinion with them, most everyone I encountered was of good character and very respectful. Just as with anything else, you will have those who cannot control themselves.
So to Luke, Matt, Crystal and all those involved, great job!!! I can only hope that next year will be bigger and better.
 -- Posted by theotherside on Mon, Aug 9, 2010, at 6:35 PM 
I want to Congratulate Luke and everyone else!!! I hope to see it next year!! Was to go Saturday when I got off work, but was at GC ER after work with my family.Had pix and txt all 4 days from friends. Not the same as being there but was there in spirit!! Everyone that I know that went had a great time, no it&apos;s not the Boogie no one said it was!!! Im glad they had the rally!! Again congrats to everyone!!
 -- Posted by rebelbrat71 on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 12:05 AM 
WEll hmmmmm guess it doesnt matter if I was there or not. now does it, what I wrote it from the mouths of ppl that were there and they said it was a freakin JOKE! they had NO beer garden, the restrooms where placed in wrong areas...the list goes on and on!! I know some of the ones who attend also and they said the only thing that it had going was they had a couple good bands!! so I guess I can comment and say what I choose, just like anyone else on here can! there problem with this whole thing is THEY WENT TO BIG THE FIRST YEAR, THEY SPENT MONEY GETTING THE GROUND READY FOR THIS AND THAT, AND THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO SOMETHING TO THE MAIN ROAD TO GET THERE. GRAVEL AND SAND IS A BIKERS WORST NIGHTMARE!! AND I DO KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!
 -- Posted by halfsize on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 5:29 AM 
They should have offered a $20 day pass for those not wanting to spend the night. $40 just to hang out for a day is ridiculous.
 -- Posted by whatanut on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 6:16 AM 
you want to play you gotta pay...
 -- Posted by brt.1 on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 7:01 AM 
LOL.........appears to me that Halfsize is experiencing some jealousy. Ouch!lol
Considering all the good/positive comments out weigh the negative!
Nothing is ever perfect and there is always room for improvement. THAT is what makes a business successful. Nothing is an overnight success, it takes time, determination, and dedication
 -- Posted by 1st lady on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 8:09 AM 
Well &quot;Halfsize&quot; you tell the people that you talked to if they didnt like it dont come back!!!!!!!!! It was a great time.
 -- Posted by BABY GIRL 3 on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 8:27 AM 
A beer garden? Want beer garden go to a bar!! Its a rally!!! Let me guess they thought theyd have bartenders and waitresses too!! People are stupid and they wonder why people make fun of others down here.
I agree you pay to play. Dont like it dont conme. And repeating hat you hear and standing by their convictions is wrong unless YOU were there. And you werent so that means your opinion counts for naught. Like if you were in court-u werent there, u personally didnt see anything wrong, so what you have to say is based on hear say, doesnt stand up in court.
And 1st lady&apos;s comment is right-it was the first year!! Every year its hosted they will come up with ways to improve it. Like anything in life you learn from your mistakes. You just build upon them making things better. For the amount that had to go to the ER and the Deputies only being there once I think it was a good job to the security and everyone else.
And obviously halfpint knows what they&apos;re talking about obviously they are a lil addled from dumping a bike. Tell you what put your money where your mouth is and pave the road for them or shut up!! not too hard~~
 -- Posted by rebelbrat71 on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 11:27 AM 
NOPE none of the above sorry you didnt hurt my feelings or any such thing. thing is its not just hear say. I never said I wasnt there now did I? you all are asuming I wasnt?? hmmmm go figure, this is from actual ppl who were there and didnt enjoy what they seen or had going on, most left friday morning! ALSO I know for a fact that at least one couple demanded their money back and was given their money back!! so hmmmm dont think I am saying anything but truths here guys!! get a grip!!
 -- Posted by halfsize on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 11:44 AM 
halfsize, why you so mad about this? Nobody come to your bar? I just talked to Mr. Gechtman and he said he would personally trailor your bike in on that nasty road and take you to your site on a golf cart. And he would have Security escort you to the bathroom that was to far for you to reach. Also if you disclose who you are he will give you 2 free passes. If not, keep up the comments, because it is great publicity for the Plummer River Rally! Thanks!
 -- Posted by iowp66 on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 1:43 PM 
That was GREAT!! thanks iowp66
 -- Posted by frog976 on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 2:04 PM 
Well for one what bar?? I dont own a bar or have any business, so where that comes from who the heck knows? now who is jumping and throwing stuff out there, not knowing who someone is and playing guessing games LOL. Anyways it doesnt matter what I think to you, only matter what I think and what I KNOW to be a fact. so take your shots doesnt matter, cause you arent bringing me down nor what I think isnt going to change. so have your fun and take your shots.
 -- Posted by halfsize on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 2:30 PM 
u make ur self look like a joke, have fits, then act like whatever. maybe u need the 5th floor and medication. good ur friends left probably would have brought others down that were there? they got their money back? awesome just the kinda a man luke is. u know to b fact ur loser friends that wouldnt know fun if it dry humped their leg to b fact. question for ya halfsize...r ur folks related?
 -- Posted by rebelbrat71 on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 2:41 PM 
awwww look someone is getting upset? awwww poor baby..hey you know everyone has a opinion. and I was just giving mine. so blah blah blah.
 -- Posted by halfsize on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 3:04 PM 
oh and there you go assuming again, I never said they were my friends just said I knew for a fact with out a doubt that it happened!!
 -- Posted by halfsize on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 3:05 PM 
Halfsize, the name says it all, not enough of a person to come to something as good as the rally and not big enough to say that you can take a couple of peoples word on something instead of looking at all the rest of the commentsor knowing first hand. Maybe the people you heard it from are &quot;quartersize&quot;. Because your comments on what they said to you were the only thing that anyone has negative to say about the rally. So either decide to be fullsize and check it out for yourself or keep other peoples opinions to yourself and let them express their opinion.
 -- Posted by iowp66 on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 4:59 PM 
People, people, people... None of this really matters does it? All the bickering and trash talking? Those who went to the rally know it was a good time and was just as safe as going to a fast food restaurant or going to work. NO place in this world is 100% safe. I&apos;m not even saying anything crazy or unsafe happened at the rally, but some people have a low tolerance to anything outside their comfort zone. That&apos;s fine, those people are welcome to stay at home, but don&apos;t criticize others for enjoying what they find appealing. I think we still have some freedoms left in America don&apos;t we? We&apos;re all entitled to our opinions, but let&apos;s try to be a little more understanding of an individual&apos;s rights. I give kudos for the effort, finances, and thought of putting on this rally. Maybe some day people will realize that events like this do actually bring in a significant amount of business to the local area. People purchase gas, food, supplies, and some stay at hotels. Some people see something they like in the area and make plans to come back again in the future. The list goes on and on. Try supporting an event like this. It doesn&apos;t hurt to support a little cash flow into the local economy and have a good time while doing it.

WELL SAID!!!!
 -- Posted by brt.1 on Tue, Aug 10, 2010, at 6:29 PM 
LOL!! Im not upset. Y would I be? Ur opinion means naught. Im just happy they done this! It was good for the community, it was good for alot of reasons. And ole boy was right its not everyones cup of tea and for the most part everyone did have fun. Am ready to go next year!!
 -- Posted by rebelbrat71 on Wed, Aug 11, 2010, at 1:37 AM 
i agree rebelbrat on my way to the rally both fri and sat there were bikes at iga and hucks spendind money so i am sure all the small towns took in alittle money because of this event so my hats off to the ppl that went outta the way to put om the plummer river rally and i will go and donate my time as long as they keep putting it on !!!!!!!
 -- Posted by biggun on Wed, Aug 11, 2010, at 8:37 AM 
well said Coda... only one real dissenter on this whole topic. that says something if only one guy with an anonymous keyboard has a forum for his hate. congrats to you guys (Luke, Matt, Crystal), i as a business owner in the county understand that this did bring business to the area, and i am speaking for not only myself when i say sincerely thank you. not only for the uptick in my business, but for having the guts to put something like this on, things like economic development, and tourism, and political terms for interest in an area mean absolutely nothing if people like yourselves didnt put their butts behind their mouths and do something to show interest in our own backyard. rome was not built in a day, dont worry about the (few)naysayers and be proud of what you have started. it looks like it could be the start of some interesting events. although i didnt make it to the rally, ( i dont own a bike or listen to hard rock but thats ok), im really excited about the possibility of a blue grass event there.... wow music i love,and i know many people in the area really love, in that beautiful setting in the cool fall weather....mmmmmm....set it up and i will come, with friends. fall foliage in southern indiana looking over the river with sweet mountain music sounds like heaven to me...thanks again guys..dont feel like all of your hard work was wasted, it wasnt.
