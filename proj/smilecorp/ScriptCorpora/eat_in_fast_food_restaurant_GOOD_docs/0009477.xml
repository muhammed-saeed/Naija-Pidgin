 Green Lawn Community Cleanup, 2007

 Resor Road Cleanup, Summer 2007

 
 Community Outreach 
The Ghosts of Ohio organization is proud to be a member not only of the paranormal community, but also of the Ohio community. So whenever possible, we try to give back to the community that has supported us all these years. Here are just a few examples of projects we are currently involved in.

If you have a community-based activity you would like The Ghosts of Ohio to help out on, contact info@ghostsofohio.org .

 Green Lawn Cemetery 
The Ghosts of Ohio is proud to be an active member of Green Lawn Cemeterys Adopt-A-Lot program. We have adopted Section 50 of the cemetery and as such, are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the section. That means that at least once a month, we visit the cemetery and walk our section, picking up sticks and raking leaves along the way. We also weed, trim unruly bushes, and make sure all the graves are in good shape and that none of the stones have fallen over or been damaged.

Some of the famous people buried in our section include author James Thurber and eccentric businessman Emil Ambos. We have begun cataloguing and researching some of the over 300 people buried in our section to find out more about them and who they were in life. If you have any additional information regarding individuals or families buried in Section 50 of Green Lawn Cemetery, please contact info@ghostsofohio.org 

 Roadside Cleanup 
In 2006, The Ghosts of Ohio adopted a section of Resor Road in Fairfield. At least 4 times a year, we all roll up our sleeves, don reflective vests, and pick up trash along the road. 
 So if you time things just right, you might be able to see a bunch of ghosts walking alongside the road. If you do, be sure to give us beep of encouragement!

In addition to the typical beer bottles, cigarette butts, and wrappers from every conceivable fast food restaurant, we&apos;ve found some pretty strange things lying along our section of road. As you look over the list below, you&apos;ll probably ask yourself the same question we did; what happened to cause these things to be thrown from a car window?

 Top Ten Strange Things Found Along Resor Road (in no particular order): 

 Computer parts Used pregnancy test (the results were &quot;negative&quot;) Pornographic DVD still in its original case Brad Paisley CD Molotov cocktail (yes, a real one. The police were notified.) Expensive-looking corsage Pocket Knife Cordless drill minus the battery (battery was found about mile down the road and yes, the drill still worked) Remains of a stolen wallet (police were notified) Hypodermic needles
