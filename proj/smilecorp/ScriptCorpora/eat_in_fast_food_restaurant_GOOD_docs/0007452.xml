 Soul Food is a 1997 film, produced by Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds, Tracey Edmonds, and Robert Teitel, and released by Fox 2000 Pictures. Featuring an ensemble cast, the film stars Vanessa L. Williams, Vivica A. Fox, Nia Long, Michael Beach, Mekhi Phifer, Jeffrey D. Sams, Irma P. Hall, Gina Ravera, and Brandon Hammond. Written and directed by George Tillman, Jr. (his major studio debut), the film centers on the trials of an extended African-American family, held together by longstanding family traditions which begin to fade as serious problems take center stage. Tillman based the family in the film on his own, and Soul Food was widely acclaimed for presenting a more positive image of African-Americans than is typically seen in Hollywood films.

What does Mr. Gates plan to do with all the extra people that won&apos;t die from malaria now that his foundation has found a cure? It&apos;s one thing to cure people of disease, but in a country without much food, how do we keep them alive? For each person kept alive, it costs $500 to set up a farm to feed them. Where will Africa get the money?


&quot;Last month’s IPCC report predicts dramatic changes in rain distribution around the world. One likely consequence the scientists point to is&quot;severely compromised&quot;access to food in many African countries by 2020.&quot;In some countries,&quot;it estimates,&quot;yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 per cent.&quot;&quot;
