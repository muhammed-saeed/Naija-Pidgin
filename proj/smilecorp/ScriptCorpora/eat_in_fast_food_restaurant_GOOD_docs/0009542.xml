 3 men accused of robbing elderly women 
 Posted by Meghann March 31, 2011 4:50 p.m.  •  0 comments 
A 19-year-old man accused of robbing an 88-year-old woman is suspected of targeting four other elderly women.

Jonathan R. Crisler was charged Wednesday with Isaac J. Murphy, 19, for a string of purse snatchings between March 17 and March 19.

In each case, an elderly woman was followed home from the grocery store and attacked.

Crisler was arrested March 19 with Andrey A. Murray, 20, after a motorist witnessed Crisler running with the 88-year-old victim&apos;s purse near 3604 N. Washington St. before getting into a Green Pontiac driven by Murray.

Police believe the men used the stolen cash to buy OxyContin.

Crisler is charged with four counts of second-degree robbery and one count of attempted second-degree robbery.

Murphy is charged with two counts of second-degree robbery and one count of attempted second-degree robbery, and Murray is charged with second-degree robbery.

 Plea deal expected after shooting mistrial 
 Posted by Thomas March 31, 2011 2:30 p.m.  •  0 comments 
A judge has declared a mistrial in the case against a Spokane Valley man who was facing up to 50 years in prison following an attack on his ex-girlfriend and his former best friend.

Superior Court Judge Jerome Leveque declared the mistrial Wednesday after a witness offered testimony that the defense said was a surprise.

The witness said defendant Don R. Davis, 29, admitted possessing a gun that investigators said was used in a drive-by shooting as part of the case.

Defense attorney Rob Cossey objected because that information had not been presented to him by the witness or by Deputy Prosecutor Gayle Ervin in preparation for the trial.

“It was completely out of the blue. It was out of the witness’s mouth before I could do anything,”Cossey said.“I asked for a mistrial and the judge granted it.”

Davis is expected to plead guilty to some of the charges on April 6.

“We think we can reach a resolution,”Cossey said,“but it doesn’t include the attempted murder charges.”

Ervin had charged Davis with 10 criminal charges, including two counts of attempted first-degree murder, following a series of events that began on Oct. 4, 2009, with wild vehicle chase on Interstate 90 that included several collisions as Davis attempted to force his former best friend, Clayton Cooper, off the roadway, according to court testimony.

Davis was also charged with breaking into an apartment and stealing a shotgun that witnesses said was used in a drive-by shooting. Just minutes after that event, deputies conducted a search warrant and found the stolen gun in the trunk of the car Davis was driving, according to court testimony.

If convicted of all charges, Davis faced as much as 411 months in prison plus about 200 months for the weapons charges.

 Posted by Meghann March 31, 2011 1 p.m.  •  0 comments 
Two teenagers were arrested for breaking into vehicles at a Spokane Valley car dealership early today, police said.

William Russell Kelly and Mecayla Ann Santjer, both 18-year-olds living at 8100 E. Appleway Ave., are due in Superior Court this afternoon on a second-degree burglary charge

A private security guard for Gus Johnson Ford told police about 2:15 a.m. that two people were prowling cars at Appleway Honda on East Sprague Avenue.

Officer Mark Benner arrived to find Kelly and Santjer crawling under a fence. They said they&apos;d been drinking and decided to look at vehicles.

Kelly pocketed disposable face masks, a key fob and several keys while prowling 10 to 15 cars, police said.

 DOJ launches probe of Seattle police 
 March 31, 2011 noon  •  0 comments 
SEATTLE (AP)—The Justice Department today launched a formal civil rights investigation of the Seattle Police Department following the fatal shooting of a homeless woodcarver and other incidents of force used against minority suspects.

Seattle U.S. Attorney Jenny Durkan and the assistant attorney general for the DOJ&apos;s Civil Rights Division, Thomas E. Perez, held a conference call Thursday morning to discuss the investigation. Durkan previously said her office was reviewing the Seattle Police Department&apos;s actions.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and 34 other community groups called for the inquiry after a Seattle officer shot and killed Native American woodcarver John T. Williams after he crossed a street downtown. The officer who shot Williams, Ian Birk, resigned from the force but was not charged criminally.

Other incidents captured on surveillance or police-cruiser video include officers using racial slurs and stomping on a prone Latino man; an officer kicking a non-resisting black youth in a convenience store; and officers tackling and kicking a black man who showed up in a police evidence room to pick up belongings after he was mistakenly released from jail.

ACLU of Washington spokesman Doug Honig welcomed the announcement.

“We think the DOJ has a lot of experience and expertise in dealing with situations like this around the country,”he said.“Our hope is that they can make recommendations that will help the city of Seattle curtail the use of excessive force in the future.”

 Robber targets couple in Valley home 
 March 31, 2011 11:30 a.m.  •  0 comments 
A man at the door of a Spokane Valley home pushed his way into the residence and robbed a couple in their 60s, police said today.

The robber knocked on the couple’s door about 8:45 p.m. on Tuesday, asked for someone named Steve and then forced his way inside demanding money.

The robber pushed the husband over the couch and grabbed the wife’s purse and ran out. The purse contained credit cards and other items.

Officers and a K-9 team checked the area, but were unable to find the man, described as white, in his mid-20s, 5-foot-6 to 5-foot-10 and unshaven with dark hair and dark eyes. He was wearing a brown hooded sweatshirt and khaki-colored pants.

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Check at (509) 456-2233.

 Grand jury indicts Hells Angels leader 
 Posted by Meghann March 31, 2011 10 a.m.  •  0 comments 
The sergeant at arms of the Washington chapter of the Hells Angels has been indicted by a federal grand jury.

Ricky W. Jenks, 33, faces up to 10 years in federal prison after the jury indicted him in U.S. District Court for felon in possession of a firearm. He pleaded not guilty to the indictment on Friday and remains in the Spokane County Jail without bond.

Jenks, whose felony convictions include manslaughter , was the only suspect arrested at the clubhouse after investigators found eight firearms. The five other men at the clubhouse during the March 3 raid were from out of town and are not prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition, prosecutors say.

One of those men, Hells Angel member Jameal A. Hadeed, has claimed ownership of five of the eight firearms, according to court documents filed Tuesday. Another, Travis I. Vanweerdhuizen has claimed ownership of one.

But prosecutors have said four of the five men with Jenks at the clubhouse arrived in Spokane via airplane and did not check firearms.

Prosecutors are refusing to release the affidavit that authorized the search because it“contains material regarding an ongoing investigation,”documents said.

Another Hells Angel arrested March 4, Michael R. Fitzpatrick, 33, was  jailed on a marijuana charge but released the next day .

 Charge filed in head-on South Hill crash 
 Posted by Meghann March 31, 2011 8 a.m.  •  0 comments 
A 41-year-old Spokane woman has been charged with vehicular assault for a crash on the South Hill last summer that severely injured her and the other driver.

Maxine Kristen Tindle pleaded not guilty last week for a head-on collision that injured Molly P. Sutor at 1600 Southeast Boulevard on Sept. 20.

Both women were rushed to the hospital with what police described as life-threatening injuries. Sutor, who was northbound when southbound Tindle crossed the center line, fractured an ankle, punctured a lung and lacerated her liver and spleen. She suffers from long-term disabilities that affect her vision and mobility.

Tindle&apos;s fiance told police she was coming from a doctors appointment and shopping trip and may have“overdone it and exhausted herself.”But police say Tindle&apos;s blood sample showed methamphetamine in her system at the time of the crash, along with medications legally prescribed to her.

Spokane police Cpl. Dave Adams said in court documents that Tindle has a history of blackouts“due to her physical ailments”as well as a history of muscle spasms.

Tindle is represented by the Spokane County Public Defender&apos;s Office. Trial is scheduled to begin June 13.

 No death penalty in triple murder case 
 March 31, 2011 6 a.m.  •  0 comments 
CHEHALIS, Wash. (AP)—The Lewis County, Wash., prosecutor won&apos;t be seeking the death penalty in the case of a man accused of killing three people last August in the town of Salkum. 

KOMO-TV reports that Prosecutor Jonathan Meyer has filed court papers indicating he won&apos;t seek capital punishment. John Allen Booth Jr., who was arrested in Spokane, is charged with aggravated first-degree murder.

Life in prison without parole is the only other punishment in Washington for conviction on that charge. Authorities have said they believe the shooter in the Aug. 21 triple killing may have been trying to collect on a drug debt.

Booth was arrested three days later in Spokane at 1911 W. Gordon St.

Killed were 52-year-old David J. West Sr. and his 16-year-old son, David Jr., along with 50-year-old Tony E. Williams, of Mineral. A woman was injured.

Three suspects have been charged in a gunpoint home-invasion robbery in Cheney last week.

Merle Leon Weeks, 17, Meshion M. Woodruff, 19, and Samuel Chavez, 23, are accused of breaking into their marijuana dealer&apos;s home, handcuffing and binding him with an iPod cord and stealing cash, pot and electronics.

Weeks appeared in Superior Court today on charges of second-degree assault, first-degree burglary, first-degree robbery and unlawful imprisonment. Woodruff appeared in court Tuesday. Both are in the Spokane County Jail, along with Chavez.

The robbery occurred at March 21 at 15 N. 3rd St.

The victim, David K. Lindsay, 25, went to the Cheney police station at 2:30 a.m. and said two men broke into his home with guns and told him they were the police before ransacking him home. .

Weeks“was a bit emotional”when he was arrested Friday at 620 W. 7th St., in Cheney, and apologized to his mother as he was led to the police car, according to court documents.

He gave a detailed interview to police and has been charged as an adult.

 Sex offender, WSU library patron jailed 
 Posted by Meghann March 30, 2011 4 p.m.  •  0 comments 
A sex offender suspected of using college library computers to look at pornography is in jail for failing to register in Spokane County.

James Robert Sorrell, 66, alias Douglas Doolittle, was convicted in Ada County, Idaho, in 1987 of lewd conduct of a minor and infamous crime against nature. He was released in 1997, then convicted of failing to register as a sex offender in Oregon in 2008.

The U.S. Marshals Service began looking for him earlier this year after learning he may be in Washington. He was arrested Friday after security at Washington State University&apos;s Riverpoint campus told federal investigators that Sorrell was looking at pornography on the library&apos;s computers, including a visit on Thursday.

Sorrell was arrested near the House of Charity, where investigators believe he sometimes stayed. He faces up to 10 years in federal prison for failing to register as a sex offender.

U.S. Marshal William Downey said he regularly saw Sorrell near Main Street and Lincoln Street in downtown Spokane.

“He actually would walk right by the courthouse here on his way to the library,”Downey said.

Sorrell is pictured above last April on the Gonzaga University campus. He told the photographer he was taking a research break.

 March 30, 2011 3 p.m.  •  0 comments 
A Spokane transient faces 10 to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaguther for the beating death of a man last April. 

Roland E. Benton II pleaded guilty Friday to first -degree manslaughter with a deadly weapon in the slaying of Douglas J. Klages, 46.

Klages&apos;badly beaten body was discovered by hikers April 30 in a small cave at Camp Caro Community Park at Dishman Hills.

 Detectives retracing Klages&apos;final hours found surveillance video of Klages leaving a Spokane Valley Rosauers store with Benton the day his body was discovered. Benton was arrested May 5.

Benton, who appeared in Spokane County Superior Court before Judge Sam Cozza, initially was charged with first-degree murder . The lesser charge to which he pleaded guilty carries a sentencing range of 102 to 126 months.

The deadly weapon adds two years to the sentencing range, and Benton will not be eligible for an early release based on good behavior. His sentencing is set for April 25.“The victim&apos;s family members were present and were satisfied,”Deputy Prosecutor Jim Kaufman said. Klages is pictured with his two daughters.

 Ex-lover on trial after shooting, chase 
 March 30, 2011 2 p.m.  •  0 comments 
The criminal trial began Tuesday in a case the prosecution presented as an angry, drug-induced ex-lover threatening both his former girlfriend and his former best friend.

Don R. Davis, 29, faces a total of 10 charges, including first-degree burglary, drive-by shooting and violation of a no-contact order, in a trial being argued in front of Superior Court Judge Jerome Leveque.

Deputy Spokane County Prosecutor Gayle Ervin told the jury that Davis disapproved of the new relationship between his former girlfriend, Nicole Allen, and his former best friend, Clayton Cooper.

The dispute culminated on Oct. 4, 2009, when Davis confronted the couple as they tried to leave Cooper’s home.

 Father: MLK bomb suspect‘pretty worried’ 
 March 30, 2011 1 p.m.  •  0 comments 
The father of domestic terrorism suspect Kevin W. Harpham said he believes his son was set up by someone wanting to pocket the big reward posted by the FBI. 

“They put out a reward for $20,000, and one of his slimy friends turned him in for the money,”Cecil Harpham, 68, of Kettle Falls, Wash., said Tuesday.“Now, the government won’t admit it to me, but I happen to know it’s true.”

Harpham, in his first comments to The Spokesman-Review since his son’s March 9 arrest, said it appears federal agents quit trying to solve the case and focused in on his son simply because of his racist Internet postings.

“He’s sad and he’s pretty worried,”said Harpham, who visited with his son Monday at the Spokane County Jail, where he’s being held while awaiting trial on federal charges.

“To detain him for a year, or as long as the feds drag this thing out, that’s got to be… terrible.”

 Suspects keep showing up after burglary 
 Posted by Meghann March 30, 2011 11:36 a.m.  •  0 comments 
Suspects in a south Spokane County burglary continued to show up after deputies were called, leading to the arrest of six people Tuesday.

Blaze E. Smith, 40, and William George Tapio, 35, were arrested after a 61-year-old home and shop owner on West Purvis Road blocked them with his vehicle and called Crime Check.

The homeowner had discovered the buildings, which were unoccupied but filled with property, burglarized Monday. The burglars left a hand cart behind; the victim told Deputy Matt Gould he suspected they might return to retrieve it, according to the Spokane County Sheriff&apos;s Office.

Gould responded Tuesday about 12:20 p.m. and found the victim in a Dodge Ram pickup truck on the front lawn as a Chevrolet Lumina tried to leave.

Smith and Tapio were inside, along with 34-year-old Christina Marie Simmons, aka Johnson. Johnson was not arrested but will be charged with burglary later, Detective Dan Blashill said.

At 9:45 p.m. Tuesday, the victim&apos;s daughter called Crime Check to say her father was again at the property blocking additional burglars.

Three deputies, a K-9 team and Patrol Sergeant Kris Thompson arrested Richard C. Rasmusan, 33, who also had an outstanding misdemeanor traffic warrant; Scott G. Klassen, 24, who was driving on a suspended driver’s license; and Joseph A. McKee, 35.

Klassen’s Mazda pickup was also seized pending a search Wednesday.

 Feds: Ex-bank manager embezzled $500k 
 Posted by Meghann March 25, 2011 3 p.m.  •  0 comments 
A former North Idaho bank manager is accused of stealing $514,000 over a 12-year period.

Mary A. Head is charged with false entries, a federal felony that carries a maximum 30 years in prison.

Head worked at Bank of America, 162 W. Hayden Ave. in Hayden Lake, from 1993 to 2009 and was the assistant branch manager and banking center manager.

In 1997 she was given control of the ATM and charged with balancing the machine on a regular basis. That&apos;s when she started taking money from the ATM“and used it for a variety of purposes,”according to the indictment.

In September 2009, Head&apos;s control over the ATM changed because the bank installed a new imaging machine. Three months later, she was confronted about discrepancies in the books, records and ATM statements and admitted embezzling more than $500,000, according to the indictment.

Along with the criminal charge, Head is being asked to forfeit the stolen money. She is not in custody.

A smiliar indictment was returned Thursday in U.S. District Court in Spokane. 

Melissa K. Garcia is accused of stealing $5,000 from U.S. Bank in Othello in July 2006. She&apos;s charged with bank embezzlement, which carries a maximum 30 years in prison.

 Court: Zehm’s innocence not admissible 
 March 25, 2011 1 p.m.  •  0 comments 
A jury likely will not learn that Otto Zehm was innocent of a crime when he was confronted by a Spokane police officer in a fatal encounter five years ago, federal appeals court judges ruled Thursday. 

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals supported a decision by U.S. District Court Judge Fred Van Sickle to exclude from the trial of Officer Karl F. Thompson Jr. the evidence that Zehm had not committed a crime prior to the incident on March 18, 2006.

Carl Oreskovich, one of the attorneys defending Thompson against the felony charges of excessive force and lying to investigators, said he was“obviously”pleased with the decision.

 Felon arrested w/ pistol, cocaine, weed 
 March 25, 2011 9 a.m.  •  0 comments 
Here&apos;s a news release from Sgt. Dave Reagan:  

A 23-year-old Spokane man was arrested Wednesday evening after a deputy discovered drugs and a pistol inside his vehicle during a traffic stop.

Deputy Daryl Smith was southbound on Market from Hawthorne Road about 7:30 p.m. when he saw a blue car ahead of him with a defective license plate lamp. He stopped the car and identified the driver as Rodney E. Barce, 200 E. Wedgewood.

Barce’s driver’s license is suspended and Smith arrested him. The deputy identified the female passenger to see if she could drive the car away, but she too had a suspended license. She was the registered owner of the car and gave the deputy permission to search it.

Smith opened the trunk and discovered a loaded .22-caliber pistol and two plastic baggies, one containing marijuana and the other cocaine. During interviews with both Barce and the female passenger, he determined that the woman knew nothing of the gun and drugs, and that they belonged to Barce.

A criminal records check revealed that Barce has a prior conviction for a crime of violence, third-degree assault, which makes it unlawful for him to possess firearms.

Smith drove Barce to the Spokane County Jail and booked him for the misdemeanor license and marijuana violations and felony counts of Possession of Cocaine and First-Degree Unlawful Possession of a Firearm.

Appellate judges on Thursday rejected South Hill rapist Kevin Coe’s claim that state prosecutors in his recent civil commitment trial should have been prohibited from presenting evidence from dozens of sexual attacks that never resulted in charges.

Coe had asked the Division III Court of Appeals to undo the civil commitment that’s expected to keep him locked up for the rest of his life under state laws allowing for the detainment of rapists deemed sexually violent predators by the juries.

SCRANTON, Pa. (AP)—Police in northeastern Pennsylvania say they recovered more than 50 bags of heroin, cash and loose change from a woman following a cavity search.
 
Authorities say 27-year-old Karin Mackaliunas was detained last weekend following a crash. Scranton police say they found three bags of heroin in her jacket and after being taken to the police station she told investigators she had more hidden in her vagina.

A doctor performed a search and recovered 54 bags of heroin, 31 empty bags used to package heroin, prescription pills and $51.22.

Mackaliunas was jailed on $25,000 bail on charges including possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. It was not clear if she had an attorney.

Burglars used a wheeled dolly to steal a safe from a Spokane Valley bakery early today or Wednesday, police say.

Employees at Oroweat Bakery, 5424 E. Sprague Ave., believe the theft occurred between 6:45 p.m. Wednesday and 7 a.m. today. An employee arrived at 7:30 a.m. to find the garbage man standing by the unsecured front door.

Police believe the burglars disassembled the front door locket, then rifled desk drawers and files before pulling the“large and heavy”safe from its concrete fixture and rolling it outside on a dolly, according to a news release by Sgt. Dave Reagan. The safe contained cash, business keys and paperwork.

Police also are looking for tips on a burglary that occurred early Wednesday at Spokane Quik Lube, 14704 E. Sprague.

Police responded to an alarm about 1:45 a.m. and found loose change scattered on the floor. The manager said the suspect entered the officer but did not steal cash.

Anyone with information on the burglaries is asked to call Crime Check at (509) 456-2233.

 Ex-clerk pleads not guilty to $139k theft 
 Posted by Alison March 24, 2011 1:27 p.m.  •  0 comments 
A former Kootenai County deputy clerk accused of embezzling $139,000 over 10 years has pleaded not guilty to a grand theft charge.

Sandy Martinson, 62, entered the plea Monday in 1st District Court. Her attorney, Frederick Loats, estimated in court documents that a trial would last three days. Grand theft is punishable by up to 14 years in jail and/or a $5,000 fine.

When Martinson retired in November, a routine review of records revealed irregularities that led the county to suspect embezzlement, officials say.

Bonner County Prosecutor Louis Marshall is handling the case because of Martinson’s more than three-decade career with Kootenai County.

 Cocaine suspect already on DEA’s radar 
 Posted by Meghann March 24, 2011 9 a.m.  •  0 comments 
A Canadian man arrested with 71 pounds of cocaine near the international border is believed to be a major drug smuggler who&apos;s been on the Drug Enforcement Administration&apos;s radar since 2009, prosecutors said Wednesday. 

Family members of Jonathan Darren Smith, 39, wrote letters to the court describing Smith as a former professional rugby player known as Grundy.

The DEA suspects Smith is the same“Grundy”described as a major drug smuggler during a briefing with a drug informant in 2009, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Ohms said Wednesday at Smith&apos;s bail hearing.

Smith matches the physical description of Grundy, and aspects of his personal life match what the informant told drug investigators, Ohms said. Smith also has a“Grundy” tattoo.

Ohms said the informant described four or five drug smuggling trips conducted by Grundy, including the transport of Ecstasy into the United States by foot, then to Redding, Calif., by automobile, and the transportation of 11 kilos of cocaine from the United States into Canada.

Grundy&apos;s father also was convicted of flying a plane full of marijuana into Redding. He served 60 months in prison, Ohms said. Grundy also“has done extensive traveling”including trips to Australia, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Mexico.

“The inference is that this defendant is, in fact, occupied as a smuggler,”Ohms said.“That&apos;s what he does. This is not an isolated incident.”

Should Smith be allowed to return to Canada,“he&apos;s going to be subject to answering to that organization, and perhaps that organization won&apos;t want him to return. Because why would they? He might cooperate,”Ohms said.

Smith&apos;s lawyer, Jeff Niesen, emphasized that Smith has“serious medical problems”that likely won&apos;t be address at the Spokane County Jail.

“It would have been nice if he had been married. It would have been nice if he had 15 kids,”but he&apos;s still entitled to be considered for pre-trial release, Niesen said, noting that Smith has never been accused of violence.

Smith, who played on the Canadian Rugby Junior National team in 1990 and 1994, has been at the Spokane County Jail since his arrest Feb. 16.

U.S Magistrate Cynthia Imbrogno&apos;s decision on whether to hold Smith without bond has not yet been filed.

A would-be thief pepper sprayed a car dealership employee who tried to stop him from stealing a pickup last week, police say.

Brandon K. Hutchinson, 26, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to six felony charges related to his arrest last Thursday at Avista Stadium. He&apos;s accused of assaulting an employee at Affordable Auto, 4229 E.

 Alleged child molester assaulted in cell 
 Posted by Meghann March 22, 2011 6:10 p.m.  •  0 comments 
A convicted robber jailed on federal gun charges is accused of assaulting an alleged child molester at the federal courthouse. 

James D. Bacon, 23, (pictured) is charged with misdemeanor assault for punching Darrel W. Monzingo, 44, as the men shared a holding cell at the Thomas S. Foley United States Courthouse on March 10.

Another defendant in the cell, Fabian Vaksman, said Bacon punched Monzingo after Monzingo refused to discuss his charges, which include two counts of production of child pornography .

Bacon“made statements to the effect that he hated sex offenders,”Vaksman told U.S. Marshals. Vaksman also noted blood on Monzingo&apos;s face; Marshals say his lower lip was split.

Bacon and Monzingo were Spokane County Jail inmates but were at the courthouse for hearings before U.S. District Judge Wm. Fremming Nielsen.

Monzingo, whose trial is scheduled in September, faces up to 30 years in prison after Spokane police found child pornography during a search of his home at 3403 E. Fairview Ave. on Dec. 16.

Bacon pleaded guilty March 10 to felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition and faces up to 10 years in prison when he&apos;s sentenced in June. The new assault charge, filed today, carries a maximum six months incarceration and a fine of up to $5,000.

Bacon, who was convicted of armed robbery in 2004, was wanted for a felony drug violation and Department of Corrections warrant when he ran from police near Wellesley Avenue and Regal Street on Dec. 7. Police arrested him in a struggle, then realized he was armed with a sawed-off 12-gauge shotgun.

 Man in‘97 slaying gets 7 years for gun 
 Posted by Meghann March 22, 2011 4:30 p.m.  •  0 comments 
A convicted killer arrested in a widespread methamphetamine investigation was sentenced to seven years in prison Monday for a gun charge. 

Christopher Clay Gober, 32, was on probation when a search was conducted on his hotel room in Coeur d&apos;Alene last April.

Investigators say they found used syringes, two meth pipes, a box of .38 ammunition and lockbox inside his Dodge Charger that contained a loaded .38 caliber pistol and six rounds of ammo.

Gober is prohibited from possession firearms or ammo because of felony convictions that include manslaughter, escape, aggravated assault and intimidating a witness.

In 1998, he was sentenced to nine years in prison for shooting a Spokane Valley man to death in what Gober said was self defense . Gober originally was charged with first-degree murder for the death of Jeremy Moore, 20, who died on Dec. 23, 1997.

He was out of prison only a short while when he was arrested in the current case, which stems from a federal methamphetamine investigation that led to prison sentences for several people.

He&apos;s been attending anger management and drug addiction classes while in state prison for probation violations and is committed to continuing his rehabilitation, according to documents prepared by his public defender.

In addition to 84 months in prison, U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge ordered Gober to serve three years probation and perform 100 hours of community service.

Bisher had a loaded .40 caliber Glock handgun in his jacket and a knife in his pants pocket upon his arrest, as well as methamphetamine. Bisher told the FBI after his arrested that he&apos;d bought about four pounds of methamphetamine from a source and Washington and from people involved with Palomera-Palomeras.

Other defendants sentenced in the case include Brenda Barron, Amber Larsen, Harold R.“Hank”Dillon, Daniel Napier, Charlotte Wilson, Randi Peil, Gregory Herron and N&apos;Quala Bigman.

 Jewelry store owner tracks theft suspect 
 Posted by Meghann March 22, 2011 1:30 p.m.  •  0 comments 
A jewelry store owner tracked down a theft suspect and Idaho fugitive Monday by warning nearby pawn and jewelry shops to be on the lookout for someone selling a gold wedding band. 

Donald Jack Seed, 23, of Liberty Lake, was arrested on a misdemeanor third-degree theft charge after trying to sell the stolen ring at Pawn One, according to the Spokane Valley Police Department.

Seed is accused of stealing the ring from Artistry in Gold, 13817 E Sprague Ave., after looking at a pair of rings but only returning one, police said. Seed ignored an employee&apos;s command to stop and drove away in a gray Saturn, police say.

The owner described the Saturn to nearby businesses when calling to warn them that a thief may soon be trying to sell a gold ring.

Shortly after the warning, Seed allegedly tried to sell the ring at the pawn shop. Employees called police, and Officer Ken Dodge arrested Seed without incident.

Seed also was booked into jail on a felony fugitive charge related to a probation violation for a drug conviction in Idaho.

 Undercover probe nets meth, 6 firearms 
 Posted by Meghann March 22, 2011 10 a.m.  •  0 comments 
An undercover police investigation Saturday led to the seizure of six firearms as well as methamphetamine, scales and packaging materials at a north Spokane home. 

Jeffery S. Finney, 30, is accused of selling two of the guns to a confidential informant being followed by members of the Spokane Police Department&apos;s drug unit.

Police followed Finney and the informant to a location in north Spokane County, where Finney picked up three other firearms for sale. He was arrested as they returned to the Spokane area.

Police then executed a search warrant at his apartment, 13110 N. Addison St., and seized the drug evidence, according to an affidavit. Finney was arrested with a loaded a Colt MK IV Series 80, which police seized, as well as the guns for sale: a .38, a cap and ball revolver, a Mossberg 500-A shotgun, a Bolt action M77 Ruger rifle and a Hawken black Powder Rifle.

Finney is a convicted felon, which prohibits him from possessing weapons. His felony convictions include delivery of methamphetamine, third-degree assault and second-degree burglary.

In 2001, he fled the Public Safety Building just as a judge was to sentence him to jail for domestic violence. He was caught hiding behind a garbage bin behind Russell Van Camp&apos;s law office west of the courthouse on West Broadway Avenue, according to news archives.

 Pot advocates speak to City Council 
 Posted by Meghann March 22, 2011 8 a.m.  •  1 comment 
Medical marijuana supporters on Monday urged the Spokane City Council to support local dispensaries after a jury c onvicted an owner last week of felony drug charges.

 Representatives from Spokane Indicare and other dispensaries said they fear being shut down after Scott Shupe was found guilty last Thursday.

Indicare co-owner Surisa Arispe said the dispensary has paid $10,000 in sales taxes in the six months it’s been open.

City Council President Joe Shogan said he has no control over the state’s medical marijuana law.

“You want us to do something we have no power to do,”Shogan said.“Really, you should be contacting your legislator.”

Though the Spokane County Prosecutor’s Office has said dispensaries are illegal, authorities say more than 40 are operating in the area. No law enforcement actions against dispensaries have been reported since Shupe was convicted.

Lawyer Pat Stiley, who works with dispensaries, said Monday that he’s hoping Senate Bill 5073, which addresses dispensaries, will proceed in the Washington Legislature this week and give amnesty to current operations.

Stiley compared the fear from dispensary supporters after the Shupe verdict to the fear gripping Japan in the wake of a tsunami, earthquake and potential nuclear catastrophe.

“As you can imagine after that verdict, there was a lot of terror and fear in the community,”Stiley said.“The dispensary community in Spokane sounded a lot like the northern Japanese communities to me.”

 Sheriff, ombudsman want patrol cameras 
 March 21, 2011 5 p.m.  •  0 comments 
For police agencies, cameras that record officer encounters with the public can help prove suspects are guilty and set the record straight if officers are wrongly accused of misconduct.

“It tells you the facts,”Post Falls police Capt. Pat Knight said.“It keeps us out of trouble.”

Over the years, law enforcement officials in Spokane County have largely dismissed cameras as not worth the cost. But as agencies deal with high-profile cases of alleged misconduct, the cameras are getting a new look.

Spokane police Ombudsman Tim Burns recommended in his annual report to City Council earlier this month that cameras be installed in police cars to provide definitive evidence in cases that otherwise would be mostly the officer’s word against the accuser’s.
