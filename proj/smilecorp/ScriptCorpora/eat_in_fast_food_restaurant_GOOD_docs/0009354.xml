How to Make NBA Team Nicknames Thunder-Centric: Fan Take
 
By William Browning , Yahoo! Contributor Network Mar 19, 12:24 am EDT 
 
The Oklahoma City Thunder are one of the best teams in the NBA in the 2011-2012 season. Only the Chicago Bulls have a better record in the league to this point. The smaller-market team leads the Western Conference standings over the San Antonio Spurs .



With all of the publicity surrounding superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook , the Thunder have turned quite a few heads as the young team has blistered much of the NBA field thus far.

Here are several ways to turn any NBA team into a Thunder franchise.



 Thunder Nuggets 



My favorite is an amalgamation of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Denver Nuggets . Next time I&apos;m in a drive through at my favorite fast food restaurant, I should try ordering some&quot;thunder nuggets&quot;with fries and a soda. Some local Oklahoma City restaurants might try serving some&quot;thunder nuggets&quot;on the menu. There actually is a restaurant in Chicago that serves a menu item called&quot;Thunder Nuggets&quot;at Wishbone . Chicken strips are rolled in potato chips before frying and then baking.



 Thunder Bucks 



If the team wanted a promotion to buy OKC Thunder gear, having a pseudo-currency known as&quot;Thunder bucks&quot;would be a good way to promote team merchandise. Colorado State University at Pueblo has already got the idea. Students can spend&quot; Thunder Bucks &quot;at campus dining halls and stores. The Thunderwolves are the school&apos;s athletic mascots. When referring to the Bucks of the NBA, it means the Milwaukee Bucks .



 Thunder Pistons 



If you want a really fast or loud automobile, consider a combination of the Thunder and the Detroit Pistons . Even though the product doesn&apos;t exist, Oklahoma City can market&quot;Thunder Pistons&quot;for improved performance in your engine.



 Thunder Hawks 



A very cool bird nickname would be the Thunder Hawks, a combo of the Thunder and Atlanta Hawks . Miami University of Middletown, Ohio, is nicknamed the ThunderHawks. A semi-pro football team in Menomonie, Wisc., also bears the nickname Thunderhawks.



 Thunder Suns 



Perhaps the most paradoxical nickname of the bunch would be the Thunder Suns. The Phoenix Suns play in a part of the country where there is very little rain and a lot of sun in the desert Southwest. The Thunder play where it is relatively warm in the summer but there can be some strong and severe weather in the spring. When the Thunder and Suns get together, the weather is perfect.



 William Browning has been a fan of the Oklahoma City Thunder ever since the team relocated from Seattle. As the closest NBA team to Branson, Mo., the Thunder serve as the regional team for southwest Missouri.
