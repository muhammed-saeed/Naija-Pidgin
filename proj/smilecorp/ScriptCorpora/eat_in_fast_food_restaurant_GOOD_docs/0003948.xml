TAKE OUT TIPS

Stop at the gourmet coffee shop, the bakery or the smoothie counter for a quick snack. As you pay for your treat, you may notice a jar on the counter, marked &quot;tips.&quot; Many customers will drop a few coins or a small bill into the tip jar. A few may deposit the change they receive with their order.

Should restaurant patrons off tips when paying for take-out food?
 
TIPPING FOR GOOD SERVICE

By definition, tipping is a service gratuity. That means, you tip someone who has provided a service to you. Wait-staff in sit-down restaurants perform a valuable service, so you tip them.

Restaurant employees who wait on tables, tend bar, or serve counter patrons often earn reduced hourly wages, based on the assumption that they will earn and declare tips (for tax purposes) as additional income.

In fancy restaurants, you might tip coat room attendants and valet parking staff as well.

TIPPING FOR TAKE-OUT?

However, if you arrive at a restaurant in person to purchase and carry out your own food order, you are not obligated to tip the restaurant staff, whether you pre-ordered by telephone or in person. Tipping for take-out food would be similar to tipping for food and grocery purchases, which simply is not done.

Generally, cashiers do not expect tips, and their employers often do not allow them to accept gratuities at all.

TIPPING FOR FAST FOOD?

At fast-food restaurants, customers are not expected to tip. In fact, many fast-food establishments do not allow tipping at all. And, of course, no tipping is needed at the drive-through window.

TIPPING FOR DELIVERY

On the other hand, a generous tip is more than appropriate, if your food is delivered to you. In fact, if you receive a delivery in a distant or difficult-to-find location or inclement weather, you might offer a particularly nice tip.

Also, hotel room service requires tipping, although a gratuity is often added automatically to the room bill. It is perfectly acceptable to ask the person who delivers your order to you whether his or her tip is included in the bill, as you sign. If the tip is not included, or if you wish to offer an additional gratuity, you may do so on the bill itself or by presenting the staffer with cash in person.

TIPPING FOR COUNTER SERVICE

Those who choose to eat in the bar of a restaurant, instead of waiting for a table, will need to leave a gratuity for their food server. Customers dining at a counter ought to tip their wait staff as well, although it generally is not the high percentage (15% to 20%) that one gives to table service staff.

TIPPING AT BUFFETS

In smorgasbords, buffet houses and cafeteria-style establishments, where customers pay a fixed rate and serve themselves, tips are not required, either, especially if customers are expected to dispose of their own trays and dishes.

Certainly, however, it is always better to err on the side of generosity. One never knows when one may be serving others, and it is nice to be appreciated. If you are unsure about whether or not to tip an employee who has helped you, it is certainly acceptable to ask.
