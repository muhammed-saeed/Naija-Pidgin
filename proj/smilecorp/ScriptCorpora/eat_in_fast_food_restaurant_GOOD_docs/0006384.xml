 &gt; Posted by Barbara Hijek on March 31, 2011 07:31 AM 
 
Hernando County Sheriff&apos;s deputies say Timothy Ray Brooks, 49, used a chain saw to break into a Best Western hotel room in Brooksville and assault his wife&apos;s date, Eyad Alaghawani, reports Tampa Bay Online. 

 

Brooks also broke a couple of car windows in the hotel&apos;s parking lot before shattering the window to the couple&apos;s hotel room using the chain saw—then barged inside.

Alaghawani told deputies he knew Brooks&apos; wife only for a few days.

Will this couple try for another date?

Man accused of choking girlfriend over spilt beer
 &gt; Posted by Barbara Hijek on March 31, 2011 07:30 AM 
 
His girlfriend had thought Alec J. Sims, 24, had too much to drink.

 

So she poured out his beer, reports the Ocala Star-Banner. 

Big mistake.

His girlfriend told deputies the Ocala man unintentionally hit her in the leg with a refrigerator door to prevent her from spilling out the beer.

During a struggle, he choked her.

All over spilt beer.

In Florida, it seems, you risk your life if you mess with someone&apos;s beer.

Don&apos;t believe it?

FloriDUH: Man at bar wanted a threesome—got to chill in jail instead
 &gt; Posted by Barbara Hijek on March 31, 2011 07:09 AM 
 
Just another day in paradise.

The Paradise Pub in Key Largo, that is.

A husband and wife were at the Paradise Pub on Tuesday night when a man, Dustin Hicks, reportedly asked them for a cigarette before extending an intimate invitation to them: Hicks put his arm around the wife and asked if she’d like to have sex with him and his girlfriend, according to a Monroe County Sheriff&apos;s Office release. 

 

 

 

This apparently didn&apos;t go down well with the woman&apos;s hubby, who confronted the man.

Hicks then slapped and punched the husband before hitting him with a bar stool, according to the release.

During the altercation, 20-year-old Jessica Brown, of Wildwood, Fla., wanted to get into the action.

She allegedly walked up to the husband and also punched him—and his wife as well, according to the release.

Another person in the bar told a deputy that Hicks also punched him “for no reason”. That was before Thomas Gallagher, 26, of Key Largo, pushed him to the ground during the altercation, according to the release.

Brown was still fighting during her arrest, allegedly kicking a deputy several times. She continued to fight and kick as she was transported to the Plantation Key jail.

Once at the jail, she also fought with corrections officers.

Brown was charged with two counts battery on a law enforcement officer, two counts of battery and criminal mischief. Hicks was charged with three counts of battery and one count of aggravated battery. Gallagher was charged with one count of battery. All three are in the Monroe County jail.

FloriDUH tip: Stay away from folks called‘Stab’
 &gt; Posted by Barbara Hijek on March 31, 2011 06:54 AM 
 
Especially at bars.

For example:

Man at bar:‘Hello, I&apos;m‘Stab.’How about a ride?’

Big clue: He&apos;s probably called‘Stab’for a reason...

Stephen Roberts told Alachua County Sheriff&apos;s deputies he was robbed after giving an acquaintance a ride from Panama Joe’s bar to an apartment complex. A stranger appeared and hit him with a gun at the complex. Then the stranger and the acquaintance took his wallet in the planned robbery, reports The Gainesville Sun. 

 

His acquaintance&apos;s name?

Stanley “Stab” Hunter, 19.

Woman swallowed by sinkhole in her backyard
 &gt; Posted by Barbara Hijek on March 30, 2011 07:42 AM 
 
While gardening in her backyard, Carla Chapman, of Plant City, says a sinkhole opened up in the ground underneath her feet Monday morning, reports WTSP News-10 in Tampa Bay.

The sinkhole left her 7 feet underground screaming for help, buried under heavy sand and clay and having a hard time breathing.

She dialed 911 and threw her phone up out of the hole, which allowed the call to go through.

Good thinking.

Let&apos;s hope their idea of Saturday night fun doesn&apos;t‘catch fire.’

 

Two men are accused of stealing lighter fluid and a newspaper from a Daytona Beach Walmart on Saturday, then starting a‘large inferno’by igniting pallets and cardboard outside of the store&apos;s automotive department, police and fire officials said, reports the Orlando Sentinel. 

The men were later spotted running from the store.

But they couldn&apos;t run from surveillance video.

FishTALES: 200-pound ray strikes tourist in Keys
 &gt; Posted by Barbara Hijek on March 30, 2011 07:31 AM 
 
The Hausch family of Illinois was enjoying an eco-tour boat ride on Friday afternoon in the waters off Islamorada when the 200-pound spotted eagle ray with a 5.5-foot wing span that they were photographing leaped into their boat and struck Jenny Hausch in the chest, reports the South Florida Sun Sentinel. 

&quot;She was not harmed and managed to get out from under it,&quot; said Officer Robert Dube of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Hausch was with her husband and three kids when the incident happened.

After the ray landed on Hausch, the family&apos;s screams summoned a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission team that was patrolling nearby. The officers waited for the ray to wear itself out before tying a rope around it and pulling it into the water, where it swam away.

Oops! Drunken dad drops baby at parade
 &gt; Posted by Barbara Hijek on March 30, 2011 07:27 AM 
 
Last Saturday the family went to the Chasco Festival parade in downtown New Port Richey, reports the St. Petersburg Times. 

 

Mom handed over their 2-month-old daughter to dad, Daniel Knapp, 33.

But Knapp dropped the baby about 5 feet—and her head hit the concrete.

Police say Dad &apos;fessed up to drinking five or six Bud Lights during the parade and was so drunk that he could not remember how to spell the baby&apos;s name or even remember her date of birth.

Babba&apos;s bad: Motocross superstar charged with impersonating a cop
 &gt; Posted by Barbara Hijek on March 30, 2011 07:18 AM 
 
Motocross superstar James &quot;Bubba&quot; Stewart Jr. was arrested Monday evening at Orlando International Airport after he tried to stop another vehicle by flashing red and blue police-type lights that he bought at a flea market.

 

Problem: The vehicle was full of legitimate off-duty officers, reports the Orlando Sentinel .

And the vehicle Bubba was driving—a 2008 Toyota Tundra pickup suped up with extra-large tires, tinted windows and black rims—hardly looked like something police would use, even for undercover work.

The stunt earned Bubba, 25, a trip to jail for impersonating a police officer.

Deputies: Teen pistol-whipped mom to get a new car
 &gt; Posted by Barbara Hijek on March 29, 2011 07:46 AM 
 
  

The 17-year-old Fort Myers teen is an honor student who has recently been accepted to several Ivy League colleges on scholarships, according to her mom.

But on Thursday night, the teen insisted her mom co-sign on a loan for a new car for her, reports the Naples Daily News. 

Mom refused her daughter&apos;s request, according to mom.

Later that day, according to the mom, the teen returned home with a 9-mm Sig Sauer and pistol-whipped her in the head and pointed the gun at her head and stomach before demanding she accompany her to a dealership.

The teen got a 2004 Nissan 350 Z.

But on Friday, while her daughter was in school, mom called the cops.

They recovered the gun, which happened to be stolen from a Lee County Port Authority employee’s house last summer.

Mom, what took you so long to call the cops?

Could this be a bizarre tale of buyers&apos; remorse?

In the meantime, the teen got to experience a different set of wheels—a police cruiser.

FloriDUH: Big beef at McDonald&apos;s
 &gt; Posted by Barbara Hijek on March 29, 2011 07:23 AM 
 
Could it have been a Big Mac attack?

Brant Goodwin Stephens, 43, is accused of hurling a hamburger at someone&apos;s vehicle at a St. Lucie County McDonald&apos;s on Saturday afternoon, reports Will Greenlee in his blog Off the Beat for TCPalm.com.

 

The burger left some ketchup and burger bit evidence on the vehicle.

So the victim in the beef got proactive and took down the thrower&apos;s auto tag number.

Later, when authorities tracked him down, he told them &quot;I threw a cheeseburger at that (racial epithet&apos;s) truck. He pissed me off and if I have to go to jail for it then that&apos;s OK.&quot;

So the cops tossed his buns into jail.

The couple had been living together since Valentine&apos;s Day.

Hopefully they won&apos;t be together for April Fool&apos;s Day.

 

Raymond Michael Lankheim, 60, is accused of chasing his girlfriend with an axe. She ran into her car and locked herself inside.

But this didn&apos;t stop the attack.

He lifted her vehicle off the ground 4 to 5 feet with a backhoe before dropping it to the ground—while she was inside, reports TCPalm.com. 

The Stuart man then retrieved the axe and got into the swing of things some more.

Jilted ex drops dime on rival, but both wind up in jail

FloriDUH tip: Never become engaged in a love triangle if you have an active warrant on your head.

West Pensacola resident Kaneatha Sheri Harris, 27, thought she had hatched a plan to get back at her ex and his new girlfriend, Lateefah Moore, 32, reports the Pensacola News Journal .

 

 

Harris posed as Moore, who was wanted for violation of probation following a 2009 conviction for petit theft and trespassing, then called authorities Sunday morning and said she wanted to turn herself in and gave them her rival&apos;s address.

When deputies came to the residence, nobody answered.

Things spiraled out of control—eventually a SWAT team arrived.

Authorities got to the bottom of the situation and determined that Harris, not Moore, made the calls.

In the end, both Harris and Moore were busted.

Sadly, they&apos;re now prisoners of love.

Stephen M. Deasey of Dublin, Ohio, was at Rookies Bar and Grill in Marco Island when he decided to go outside and have a cigarette. When he returned, a woman was seated in his bar stool and refused to leave, reports the Naples Daily News. 

 

Deasey, 56, became belligerent and began yelling at other patrons.

The bartender asked him to leave, but he refused—so cops were called.

But he even refused the officers&apos; order to leave.

Report: Former embalmer dumped human organs

Claude Holmes Jr., of Haines City, tested positive for cocaine on March 9, which violated the terms of his probation, reports The Lakeland Ledger. 

 

The reason he is on probation is very unusual.

Holmes was arrested in 2009 after county workers mowing grass discovered the remains in a garbage bag, which also contained empty bottles of formaldehyde, between two vaults at a Haines City cemetery.

Holmes told detectives that he dumped the remains because he &quot;didn&apos;t want to put it in the casket because it would stink up the whole funeral home,&quot; according to an arrest affidavit.

In a plea deal he was charged with littering, but lost his embalmer&apos;s license.

Stabbing suspect just wasn&apos;t serving pie

Joshua L. Woolley thought getting out of an attempted murder rap was as easy as pie.

Woolley was charged with attempted murder on Monday—nearly four months after he stabbed his girlfriend in the throat, rendering her unable to speak, reports The Bradenton Herald. 

 

At the time he told Lee County Sheriff&apos;s deputies that, as he was serving his girlfriend a piece of pie while holding a fork and steak knife, he fell and accidentally cut her throat.

Woolley thought he had successfully pulled the wool over their eyes.

However, while in the Manatee County jail on unrelated charges, Woolley told officials &quot;that he had gotten away with attempted murder,&quot; according to a sheriff&apos;s office release.

Oops! He really slipped up this time.

Indicted: Woman who kept her dead mom in their home
 &gt; Posted by Barbara Hijek on March 26, 2011 08:01 AM 
 
Last June Lee County sheriff’s deputies performed a wellness check on Gail Andrew&apos;s mother. They found her badly decomposed body hidden underneath 2-foot-high piles of trash.

Now Gail Andrews, the woman who lived with her dead mother for more than a year in their Fort Myers home, has been busted: The Feds say she cashed nearly $74,000 of her mom&apos;s Social Security checks, reports the Naples Daily News. 

Andrews, 62, was a Lee County teacher for 20 years.

And there&apos;s a stiff penalty for taking a dead person&apos;s money: If convicted she faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in federal prison.

What happened to the money?

Andrews has offered an explanation: Some cash was lost during the search of her home.

And then there were some nasty cash-eating rats.

She&apos;d wouldn&apos;t say how many checks she&apos;d cashed.

A registered sex offender, Phillip P. Heidt, 20, and his girlfriend, Deeanna M. Murray, 24, both face charges of child abuse after Daytona Beach Shores police caught the woman trying to drop one of her children from a bathroom window onto a small dangerous rooftop, reports the Orlando Sentinel. 

 

The reason?

Just to make sure her sex-offender boyfriend would not be caught with her children in his apartment.

Police were checking out a tip that children had been seen there when the incident occurred.

Joshua Krakat bit the bullet, literally.

The 21-year-old Hobe Sound man removed the bullet magazine from a 9 mm handgun, then held the gun up to his cheek and pulled the trigger in front of friends—apparently forgetting there was a round in the chamber, reports TCPalm.com. 

Now he&apos;ll face some serious damage: A broken jaw, a wound and hearing loss due to the loud gunfire.

Deputies: Man attacked roommate with machete, steak knife
 &gt; Posted by Barbara Hijek on March 25, 2011 07:30 AM 
 
Orange County Sheriff&apos;s Office deputies said 54-year-old Colin Duncan attacked his roommate with a machete and a steak knife Thursday in Orange County, reports the Orlando Sentinel. 

 

And the attack appears to be over the front door being left open, according to the victim&apos;s girlfriend.

The blade somehow gashed Duncan&apos;s face and injured his eye.

Time to outlaw machetes?
