 EPCOT RESTAURANTS 

 Garden Grill Character Lunch The Land Future
World Epcot 

 Garden Grill 
Lunch - The Land - As of October 6, 2008, Epcot&apos;s Garden Grill is no 
longer serving lunch. 
 
Highly Recommended Excellent American home-style food 

Our party of 7 ate lunch here while visiting in September 2000. Id made a
Priority Seating months in advance; it probably wasnt necessary as the
restaurant wasnt crowded, but it is really a good idea when a character meal
is a&quot;must do.&quot;We arrived at 11:30 and were seated almost
immediately.

This restaurant rotates very slowly around a portion of the path that the&quot;Living with the Land&quot;ride takes, so the scenery changes gradually
while you dine. The characters we encountered were Farmer Mickey, Farmer Minnie,
Farmer Chip and Farmer Dale. If you can do a meal like this at an off-peak time
as we did, the characters will spend more time with you. They all came around
several times. Chip spent quite a few minutes interacting with our kids,
including running to an empty table to grab a cloth napkin, which he used to
wipe the sauce off my daughters cheek!

This restaurant features&quot;all you can eat family style dining&quot;lunch and dinner are served from large skillets, with childrens meals served
in smaller skillets. The lunch and dinner menus are the same, but I think the
dinner price for adults is just a little bit more than the lunch price. We
started with a small loaf of warm Sunflower Bread and Sweetened Butter. We had
all ordered lemonade, although beer and wine are available for an additional
charge. Part way through the meal our server dropped off pitchers of lemonade at
each table that we could help ourselves from. The big adult skillet included
large portions of Roasted Rotisserie Chicken, Farm Raised Catfish,
Hickory-Smoked Steak, Roasted Potatoes, Corn Bread Stuffing and Garden
Vegetables. If we wanted more of anything, another skillet would be brought (we
found the single skillet to be just right for two adults). The kids skillets
came with macaroni&amp;cheese and fries or chicken tenders and fries. They
even had a complementary&quot;under 3 combo&quot;for our 10-month-old that was
an even smaller portion of macaroni&amp;cheese with fruit. Deserts are also
included; the kids meals came with Butterfly Cookies (round sugar cookies cut
in half to make the wings, licorice antennas and frosting bodies dotted with
tiny sour candies). Grownups were given strawberry shortcake, family style with
coffee. This review is courtesy of Cindy 

 from
Massachusetts.

 Germany - Biergarten - This is a
buffet, with a dinner show. The show takes place every hour for 30
minutes. You are welcome to stay for more than one show. There is a
band that involves the audience in a number of different ways - the boys and I
got up and did the Chicken Dance at one point! It was a lot of fun - I
highly recommend it. You are seated at large communal tables, so get an
opportunity to talk with other vacationers. This would work very well with
a large group. The buffet offers several
types of sausage, frankfurters, chicken cooked in several different ways, beef
marinated in wine, spatzael (tiny dumplings), gravy, several types of potato salad, rolls,
etc. Beverages and desserts are not included. The show only takes
place at dinner time, but they do offer some form of entertainment at lunchtime,
such as yodelers.  

 Japan - Teppanyaki -  You are seated
at a table for twelve that surrounds a hot cooking surface, where the chef
prepares your food, similar to the Benihana chain of restaurants. First a
waitress in traditional Geisha costume takes your order. The chef then
arrives with the raw ingredients for each meal being served at your
table. You are seated in a room with 4 such tables, and can see into other
rooms just like yours. Each chef performs differently, so no matter
which table you watch, you will see a different&quot;show&quot;. The boys
can&apos;t wait to come back to this restaurant. They really liked the food
here, as well as the show.  

 China - Lotus Blossom Cafe - I
tried the red-bean ice cream here. If you like vanilla ice cream with red
candies in it, give it a try. This is a fast-food restaurant where you can
get quite an affordable dinner. Outdoor seating is available. Prices
are around $7/plate for typical Chinese style take-out dinners. 

 Canada - Le Cellier - This
restaurant used to be cafeteria style. It is now a regular restaurant,
which is decorated to resemble a wine cellar. They serve a tasty Canadian
Cheddar Cheese soup here. I also ordered the Maple Butterfinger Mousse,
which was wonderful. It came with two different sauces, which really gave
each bite a different flavor. Click here for their Menu .    

 Chefs de France - The lunch menu
has more choices that appealed to me, but I really enjoyed my dinner (I chose an
appetizer) of large seared scallops on a bed of crunchy rice, accompanied by a
glass of house wine. By ordering an appetizer, I was able to save room for
dessert. The warm upside down caramelized apple tart with vanilla ice
cream was scrumptious. We were seated just as the Tapestry of Nations
Parade came by and we had a fairly good view from our table close to the
windows. During dessert, we watched a Living Statue perform. 

 The Coral Reef - Future World -
What a view! One entire wall of the restaurant is an aquarium, with many
different types of fish, and dolphins. Sometimes you will see divers in the
tank. The main selections here are seafood, and the prices are high. If you want the atmosphere without the price, go in the afternoon and order
dessert. The boys and I ate lunch here for about $11. They ordered
kids meals, and I got a salad. (I also got a 10% Magic Kingdom Club discount,
which was available at that time). 

 Ice Station Cool - Future World -
NOT a Restaurant, but a cool place to get free Coke. They have samples of
Coca-Cola, as it is served in different countries. You can drink as many,
and as much as you like. Watch out for the Beverly, which is from
Italy. It tastes awful! It&apos;s really fun to watch other people
try it though.

Kingdom Restaurants 

 C inderella&apos;s
Royal Table - We&apos;ve eaten here for the Character Breakfast, lunch, and
dessert. This is my favorite restaurant. The food is wonderful, as
is the atmosphere. You really feel like you&apos;re dining in a castle. One of us ordered a Chocolate Brownie Mousse. The waiter brought it with three
forks. It was yummy, but so rich, we couldn&apos;t even finish it between the
three of us. For lunch, I got Major Domo&apos;s favorite pie. This was a
puff pastry filled with mashed potatoes, topped with shaved beef marinated in
burgundy, lightly covered with gravy, summer squash, and a little cheese. I ate every bite on my plate. The kids got a kick out of decapitating the
Mickey Mouse-shaped butter to spread on their rolls. The straws in their
glasses were Mickey Mouse-shaped, and they brought them home as souvenirs. The Character Breakfast featured Cinderella, The Fairy Godmother, and several
other princesses: Belle, Jasmine, Snow White. Sometimes Peter Pan
and Prince Charming appear, although not during our visit. The meal is
pre-plated. They bring you a basket of muffins and rolls, a large bowl of
cut fruit, juice, coffee, and milk for the kids. You can order either the
cold (healthy) breakfast (cold cereal), or you get the hot food: Scrambled eggs, bacon, a deep-fried cheese Danish, and home fries. For the
kids up to age 11, they bring scrambled eggs, sausage, and a waffle. You
can get refills of anything!   

 Casey&apos;s Corner Restaurant - This is counter-service,
offering hot dogs, Coke products, curly fries (yummy), and brownies. We
always stop here at least once per trip. You can sit outside on Main
Street, and people watch, or you can sit inside. They have a large-screen
TV inside. Also, outside, on the side away from Main Street, there is a
piano. If you are lucky, a pianist will be playing.   

 Tony&apos;s Town Square Restaurant - This Italian
restaurant has a Lady&amp;The Tramp theme. There are lots of pictures of
the canine couple all around the restaurant and lobby area, as well as a
fountain of Lady and Tramp in the center of the restaurant. There are two
different seating areas, one inside, and one in an enclosed sunroom, from which
you can look out at busy Main Street. The menu here is all Italian
specialties, including, of course, a plate of spaghetti and meatballs, just like
Lady and Tramp shared in the movie. They bring Italian rolls to the table
with salsa for dipping. This was very tasty. When I asked for the
dessert menu, they brought out a dessert tray. Of course after seeing the
desserts paraded in front of me, I just had to have one. I chose the
chocolate mousse parfait, which was very rich and chocolaty. The kids
pizzas are Mickey Mouse-shaped.

   DISNEY-MGM
STUDIOS     

 Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant - We&apos;ve eaten
here twice. You are seated in a dark restaurant, in old-fashioned cars,
facing a drive-in movie screen. The screen shows movie trailers for sci-fi
movies, and cartoons. The waiters are all on roller blades. Really
cool! Lots of fun. Food is only so-so though and not cheap.

 ANIMAL KINGDOM 

 Pizzafari - This counter-service restaurant has 5 rooms
all with different themes. We sat in the butterfly room. As the name
suggests, the main fare is pizza. In the morning, a breakfast pizza is
available, which is pizza dough topped with scrambled eggs and cheese. You
can have sausage on it as well. I enjoyed mine, as did Jon, but Jay didn&apos;t
like it. Kids really like this restaurant due to the theming and bright
colors.

 Rainforest Cafe - This is a non-Disney owned chain of
restaurants. Inside, it looks like a tropical rainforest, with about 5
different rooms, each with a different animal theme. You can see into the
different rooms, so it doesn&apos;t really matter where you are seated. They
have gorillas, and birds, and elephants that move and make sounds. Every
20 minutes, a storm erupts, with mist, water, thunder and lightening.  If
the restaurant is really busy, consider sitting at the bar. You are seated
underneath a&quot;mushroom&quot;canopy. The bar itself has water
bubbling all over the place, and the chairs look like the lower halves of
various animals, such as zebras, and each one has a tail. We went into
this restaurant at 3:00 in the afternoon, with no priority seating
arrangements. We were told there would be a 30-40 minute wait. We
browsed in the gift shop for 10 minutes and I was just about to suggest we sit
at the bar, which had stools available, when they called our name.  The
food here has interesting names. The waffle fries are especially
delicious, as are the Mojo Bones (barbecued ribs). The Leaping Lizard
drink was quite delicious as well. It was a slushy tropical drink that
really took effect as soon as I walked out into the heat of the day. This
restaurant is especially cold. It feels great at first to cool off, but
you can soon become quite chilled if you are dressed in something
sleeveless. I suggest carrying a light sweater if you plan on dining
here. By the time I left here, my fingers and toes were numb with cold,
and it was about 100 degrees outside. They have a website where you can
check out their menu:  www.rainforestcafe.com .

 RESORT RESTAURANTS 

 Fort Wilderness - Pioneer Hall - Hoop Dee Doo Review Dinner Show - The
best fried chicken I ever ate! They&apos;ll bring you as many buckets of fried
chicken and barbecued ribs as you want, as well as bread, corn, beer, wine, or
soda, and strawberry shortcake. Hard drinks can be ordered, but do not
come with the meal. The boys and I did not even ask for refills on our
drinks, they just brought them. This is all served during a hokey, but
hilarious western style show (with hee-haw like humor and costumes). They involve the audience at
times.  The kids (ages 11 and 14) really got a kick out of this show, and insisted we go back,
so we went again in 2000. We brought a group with us and everyone
enjoyed the show! Our waiter noticed that one of the kids at our table
wasn&apos;t eating, so he brought him two slices of pizza. Jokingly, someone at
our table asked if we could get shrimp too. A few minutes later, the
waiter plunked down a bucket of shrimp on our table! All in all, a good
show and a great meal. We&apos;ll be back.

 The Yacht Club - The Yacht Club Galley - This restaurant has a
nautical theme. We ate breakfast here several times. Once we got the
buffet, which was quite extensive. Another time, we ordered from the
menu. I ordered coffee and the boys ordered hot chocolate. The
waitress brought a full pot of each. The restaurant was more than 1/2 empty on both
occasions, so priority seating arrangements don&apos;t seem to be necessary.  

 The Beach Club - Beaches and Cream - You will probably have to wait a
short time for a table here; we did. We lunched there. It is a busy
spot, right beside the arcade, and next to the pool. It is decorated like
an old-fashioned ice cream parlor. Ice cream is the specialty here, with
such dishes as The Kitchen Sink (which consists of 8 scoops of ice cream, and
several different sauces). You can also get burgers, hot dogs, and fries
here.

 Polynesian Resort - O&apos;hana&apos;s - This large, friendly restaurant serves
a family style meal. Everyone is your cousin, and the kids will be invited
to play games during dinner, including hula-hooping and a coconut race. A
strolling musician entertains between games. There is a lazy Susan in the
center of each table, and the food is placed there. You turn this to reach
all the dishes. Skewers of meat are brought to your table, which consists
of grilled turkey, sausage, beef, and large shrimp. The set price for
dinner does not include beverages. Beware, the tropical drinks run about
$8 each, but they do come with a keepsake glass parrot-topped stirrer.

 Polynesian Resort - Kona Caf - I simply had to try the Tonga Toast
I&apos;ve heard so many people rave about. It is a large slice of sourdough
bread stuffed with banana, fried, and coated with cinnamon and sugar. It
was so sweet you can eat it without maple syrup. I tried it both
ways. It is also served with your choice of breakfast meat. Yummy! 

 Polynesian Resort - Captain Cook&apos;s - This is a 24-hour counter-service
restaurant that offers seating both indoors and out. The ducks that hang
around outside are adorable and will come right up to you looking for
handouts. This is a great place to stop on your way out to the parks for a
quick bite, or after a day at the parks. We stopped here a number of times
during out stay for breakfast sandwiches or Danish, and for ham and cheese
sandwiches for lunch. They also serve hot lunches, such as chicken
teriyaki sandwiches.  They also sold refillable mugs here. 

 DOWNTOWN DISNEY 

 Rainforest Cafe - See description above under
Animal Kingdom. The one at Downtown Disney can be seen long before you
arrive, as the entrance looks like a volcano, which erupts with smoke every few
minutes. Really cool! Each one has a large gift shop attached, and
tropical fish tanks throughout.  Check out their menus at their
website:  www.rainforestcafe.com 

 Fulton&apos;s Crab House - to make a priority seating
arrangement at this restaurant, you must call (407) 934-BOAT up to 30 days in
advance.
