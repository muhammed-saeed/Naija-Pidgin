 This road-trip food is healthy and tasty -- not that you&apos;d think of having anything else! Pull over and eat at these restaurants guilt-free. 
Boneheads

 Fact: Each day about one in four Americans eats at least one meal at a fast-food restaurant. If that number includes you, check out these healthy meal choices.

Let&apos;s start with Boneheads.
 Here&apos;s what they serve: Fresh grilled fish and chicken fire-grilled with Piri Piri sauce, made with spicy chilies from South Africa.

 Where you&apos;ll find them: In California, Florida, and Georgia. In the next two years, they plan to open in North Carolina and expand in Florida, Georgia, and California (eatboneheads.com).
 What to Order 

 Boneheads offers four types of fish, including mahi mahi and grouper. You pick one of three toppings to accompany the fish -- we like the pineapple salsa -- and a choice of one side. Go for grilled zucchini strips or chilled marinated broccoli. Roasted portobello mushroom over a house salad with dressing on the side. 


Note: Boneheads doesn&apos;t currently offer nutrition information.

This info is from 2007! Since then many restaurants have shut down or opened in other locations. And most have changed their menus. How about writing a new story with current info!
