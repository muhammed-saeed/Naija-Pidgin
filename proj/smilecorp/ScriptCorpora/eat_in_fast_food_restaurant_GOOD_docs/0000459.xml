Had good experiences at this burger king... Since the food at every Burger King tastes the same, what matters is the service and cleanliness.  The service earns five stars -- I&apos;ve had multiple employees demonstrate above-average customer service, even giving me discounts for no reason! They are all very patient while I make up my mind or make a custom order / substitution.  Lastly, the cleanliness is only average -- a few tables still needing to be washed down, trash cans remaining full -- but nothing gross.  Overall I commend the manager(s) for training employees who know how to treat the customer.

I&apos;d never had a problem with this burger king before till about a month ago when I was really craving a hamburger so my husband and i made a trip over to BK.  My food was made completely wrong (which i found out after i&apos;d already arrived back at my house) so i decided instead of just letting it slide i&apos;d make the trip back and have them remake my food...... Horrible idea the manager informed me that &quot;its not like we made your food wrong on purpose&quot;  and the proceeded to be a complete jerk about the whole situation.  I understand this is a fast food restaurant, but a little kindness and great customer service goes a long way, and this place has neither of those!!

How hard is it to make sure that my BBQ sauce is in the bag?  It&apos;s not my job to dig through the bags after you hand them to me while a line of people wait for me to leave.  It&apos;s your job Mr. Lazy drive thru guy...  He didn&apos;t even give me my receipt so that I could call in the survey.  So I turn to my only other outlet to vent my frustrations... All hail the glorious, anonymous power of Yelp.  P.S. My Whopper was cold.   This BK officially sucks!

Granted the fast food will ALWAYS taste the same, I am rating this location for it&apos;s service. I probably eat Burger King once every 3 to 4 months but I would expect that when I do go that I am treated properly. This last occurance was in the drive thru. I ordered my food just fine, but when I drive around to pay the freakin&apos; worker walked away and looked at me like I was interrupting her from her work. Like excuse me! I am here to give you my money, take my food and drive away. I don&apos;t need your sassy attitude because it&apos;s late and you probably hate your job!
