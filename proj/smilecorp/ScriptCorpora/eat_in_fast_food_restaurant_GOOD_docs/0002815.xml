 Wordless Wednesday - Maybe I Won&apos;t Spray the Squash 
 
 This is what I found this morning in my little garden. In fact, most of the blossoms were sporting 2-4 bees. I was given a reminder of why it may not be best to spray insecticides in every situation. The cucumbers beetles are not in great numbers at the moment, so I&apos;m just squishing the ones I find.  
 I&apos;m still not sure how my harvest will turn out, but for now I will enjoy all of the buzzing.
The bees seem very happy!

 Outsmarting Nature 
 
 Many people would like to see food production go“back to
nature,”and I think that sounds like a fabulous idea. But where I live, Nature
could care less if my family eats. I have tried raising backyard chickens for
eggs, and vegetables in a small garden, and I have been met with challenge after challenge. My latest
challenges have more than two legs. 
 
 Rest in peace, girls. :( 
 I’m posting this because my chicken coop has officially
become a playhouse for the kids. The last of my beautiful, jumbo-egg laying
hens are gone, becoming another meal for the local wildlife. I commented on an
article in my local paper about urban chicken farming, saying that maybe an
urban backyard may be the ideal place for raising chickens, since my woodland
home has become a banquet hall for hungry predators. Someone was quick to“educate”me, telling me I needed to provide them a coop so they would roost. Thanks for
the tip, but my chicken mansion had Fort Knox-like security at night. It provided
not an ounce of safety, however, for my free-rangers during the day from
coyotes and hawks. If I try it again, the days of go-where-you-want will not be
an option for my girls. And some wonder why commercial chicken producers keep
their birds in houses. Hmmm–cruelty or protecting your investment and the
food supply? 
 
 Cucumber beetles. Thank you, Ric Bessin, entomologist
friend at the University of Kentucky, for the photo. 
 In addition to my latest chicken chapter, we also attempted
a small garden. It is close enough to the house that the deer and rabbits have
not been visiting, but the Cucumber beetles absolutely love the squash and cucumbers
that I have provided for them. Since I do not have to rely on this garden to
feed my family, I have not used any chemical pesticides. I would go out occasionally and
knock them away, but didn’t discover their damage early enough. They were
clipping off all the blossoms. No blossoms, no fruit. Did I mention that I also
have a mysterious, volunteer gourd growing near the garden? The Cucumber
beetles really like that one, too. 
 I obtained the vegetable seeds from Seminis, which is
currently marketing a much-talked-about genetically modified hybrid sweet corn
called Obsession II. I asked their marketing team recently if any of my seeds
were genetically modified, and they said,“no.”I put in a request for beetle
resistant squash. If that does not happen soon, and I expect to have any decent
harvest, I believe I’ll have to go to chemical warfare. Maybe organic methods work
in other places and growing systems, but I have yet to be successful with them.
I even had a conversation with an organic farmer in Nebraska explaining that I
have had no luck growing cabbage. And to my surprise she said,“That’s why we
don’t grow cabbage.” 
 
 My chewed up cabbage from last year. Something enjoyed it! 
 Our final challenge this spring and summer has been the insects that feed on me and my animals: ticks, mosquitoes, horse flies, deer flies and chiggers, as well as the diseases they
are known to carry. I&apos;ve tried just about every product and method available,
and the only real relief comes from dousing my kids head to toe with Deep Woods
Off every trip outdoors. I can only imagine what that stuff is doing to our
bodies as we breathe and soak it in. Nothing works for the horses (but our bond
grows stronger every summer because they know I am pleased to provide them a
good scratch or squash a juicy horse fly). I am waiting for some smart person to develop a pill or
injectable medicine to keep the little bloodsuckers off our skin.  
 My challenges are not unique. Our farmers face similar adversity every day, and they are using technology and better management methods to help keep nature from destroying the food supply: 
 Crop rotation and natural predators Crop protection products Structures for plants and animals Conventionally-bred hybrids Irrigation Genetically modified varieties that withstand drought and pests, and allow more efficient pesticide use Vaccines and antibiotics that keep animals healthy Maintaining wildlife refuge areas 

 And I even know of a vaccine that controls horn flies  on cattle ( www.flyvax.com ) that could significantly reduce their stress.  
 Are there any of these methods that you approve of? Any you don&apos;t? Are some okay to use when maintaining a lawn or golf course, but not on food? If you do not want antibiotics used for meat animals, does that mean you would forego the same medicine for your child or pet to manage antibiotic resistance? If you don&apos;t want any trace of pesticide residues on your produce, does that mean you don&apos;t use manufactured pharmaceuticals in your own body. Are their methods you feel do more damage than good? 
 On one hand I appreciate technology—where would be without it? Hungry, diseased, dead?—but on the my semi-misanthropic hand, I  sometimes  blame technology for growing the population in the first place, thus providing us the challenge of finding, using and growing the resources to sustain weaker selves. And I understand why  some blame technology for creating more challenges or environmental problems, like antibiotic resistance or reductions in beneficial insect populations. 
 
 Did I happen to mention one of these
ran 25 ft. behind me and kids on Saturday
night? I&apos;ve had just about all of &quot;nature&quot;
that I can stand. 
 Some believe going  back to basics  (no pesticides, no manufactured fertilizers, no genetic modification, no animal confinement) will put the Earth back into a more natural  balance , as &quot;God intended.&quot;  This philosophy may actually work for some farmers and gardeners. And these food producers have a pretty good base of customers and supporters in our current day.  
 
 
 But i s going back to the
beginning really the answer? Do we sit back and pray for the best, or do we use the
minds that God gave us to continually outsmart the nature He created in order to flourish? 
 The biggest issue I have is that
some are encouraging our lawmakers and regulators to restrict the use of
technology and dictate how food should be produced. Based on my experience, I
don’t think there is any way we could produce enough food for our increasing
population using 19 th century farming methods. I also know that some technologies may need to change —  or get better —  to protect the Earth and future generations. 
 What I find as the silver lining here is that I think we can
have it all –enough food for everyone, today and in the future, with less strain on our environment.  I believe environmental
responsibility is a value shared by all farmers, whether they are USDA
certified organic, heritage seed savers, or the 3000-acre corn farmer using the
latest genetically-modified variety so she does not have to spray as much
pesticide or use as much fuel. I see a future of farmers working together for that common goal, and it may be as simple as a crop farmer having a conversation with his bee-keeping neighbor to manage when is the best time to spray any insecticides.  But farmers must be able to choose what works
best for their climate and the nature-created challenges on our changing planet. At my house, that may be GMO squash and a shotgun. 
 In the end, I believe that nature will continue to change, and organisms will continue to adapt. The winner will be the one that adapts the quickest. And if a manufactured technology is what it takes to prevail, I will not pass judgment. Nature is a beast, and I want to survive!

 Friday Forward:“No Antibiotics Ever”Does Not Equate to Safer Meat 
 
 Last night I was watching my local NBC affiliate news.“You’ll
want to hear what could be in your meat when we return,”caught my attention.
It was a good 15 minutes before the story appeared (a tactic no doubt to get me
to stay tuned–reminds me of the Saturday Night Live skit many years ago). The
segment was the health reporter repackaging a story released by Consumer Reports about antibiotic use in meat and food labels.
I was very unhappy with what I saw and heard, so I just had to respond. This is
what I sent to the reporter: 
 Hi, XXXX. I appreciate all of the health info you cover, but
I was a little disappointed about tonight’s“Antibiotics in meat/superbugs”story that aired tonight. I think it was very misleading (wish I could refer
back, but the video is not offered online - UPDATE it is not featured on the homepage, but I&apos;m not sharing a bad story!). 
 While I don’t believe anyone can discredit that routine feeding
of antibiotics to animals, as well as overuse and misuse of antibiotics in
humans contributes to resistance, my“take-a-way”from the story was that
superbugs occurred in meat only from animals that were fed antibiotics any time
in their lives. You led the viewers to believe that if they purchased meat that
says“No antibiotics ever”or“Organic,”this would be a safer option. 
 I have talked to a local meat processor, and I learned that
superbugs can be in any meat from anywhere, whether they were given antibiotics
or not. But, I did not hear the Consumer Reports lady say they tested any meat
and found superbugs. In fact, she didn’t say she tested meat at all. While
contamination can occur, meat is routinely tested. This would have been an
excellent opportunity to stress that all meat should be cooked to the
recommended internal temperature. Food safety is critical. It would have also
been helpful to relay that all animals must be antibiotic free when they arrive
at the processor. USDA routinely checks this and removes any contaminated
product they may find. In fact, they have stepped up their monitoring process. 
 I also noted the comment that routine antibiotics are given
because of“unsanitary conditions”, another assumption. Have you ever visited a
commercial poultry house? I have, and could not get over how much cleaner and
less stinky it was than some more“natural”operations I have visited. (I have also
now learned that routine antibiotic use is no longer industry practice - 40 years of industry experience offersopinion about antibiotic use in livestock .) 
 Lastly, I would like to encourage you to utilize the
knowledge of our many Kentucky farmers for stories about food. Get a farmer’s
perspective on why he or she may need to give antibiotics (I would be more
inclined to eat a healthy animal than one that has been sick). Ask how
antibiotic use has changed and how the livestock industry is addressing this
issue. If you ever need help finding the farmers to talk to, I would be glad to
put you in touch with them. 
 Here is a great post from John’s Custom Meats  –farm and meat processor in Bowling Green–that explains the issue at hand: http://www.johnscustommeats.blogspot.com/2010/09/increased-federal-beef-oversight-needed.html#more 
 I hate thinking this story was a way to get people to stay
tuned to the end of the broadcast. It got my attention, but I wish the story
was covered from all sides. I’m afraid people will be led to believe certain
meat products are safer, when in fact they are not. 
 Sincerely, Jennifer Elwell
Blog: “Food, Mommy!” www.foodmommy.net 
Twitter @foodmommy 
 I was also able to call on Kentucky farmer and meat
processor Amy of John’s Custom Meats to tell me more. She offered this: 
 FSIS (USDA
Food Safety and Inspection Service) is
revamping the residue testing program. There is a new (and more
accurate...better) test available that they will be using. In addition, they
are increasing the amount of testing being done. 
 Here&apos;s
the link to the FSIS press release http://www.fsis.usda.gov/News/NR_070212_02/index.asp 

 Translation: This is a good thing!   The new test method can test for a whole
multitude of residues all from one sample. This will provide a more accurate
baseline to zero in on the main problem residues. What will result from that is
focusing in on the main problem areas and increasing sampling in those areas.
Eventually, leading to the source of the issue or just finding there is no real
issue to begin with. 
 
 NOTE: On Friday’s, I will select a topic that I feel was“forward
worthy.”Find many more posts and articles I have forwarded on my Facebook Page - http://www.facebook.com/FoodMommy  - or Twitter account (@foodmommy).

 Reinventing Our Plate 
 
 All of the information about portion size and what we should
be eating must be sinking in, because I’ve got a new way of loading up my family’s’plates. Vegetables and fruits take center stage while the meat, dairy, and
grains play side dishes. 
 
 The sweet potato and fresh-from the garden squash and beans play the main role on this plate.
We got a few more veggies in by adding a small salad. 
 As I became more concerned about the nutrition in our
household, I realized that we may not be getting enough of the recommended
vegetable servings in our diet. I try very hard to always provide something plant-based
and colorful at lunch and dinner, but I’m thinking it’s time to step it up and
at least follow the USDA MyPlate suggestion: Half your plate should be fruits
and vegetables. I’ve been consciously doing this for a little over a year now. 
 Here are a few ways that we have increased on fruit and
veggie intake: 
 
 You can’t leave the breakfast table without having at least
one fruit, but two is better . I always try to keep bananas and berries on hand.
I like grapefruit and usually eat it 3 times a week. I’m not a juice person,
but will drink it if I’m running behind on time. Have a serving of fruit at lunch and one at dinner or for a
snack . I always have 4-5 different kinds of fruit on hand depending on what is
in season or on sale. Bananas and apples are always around (my husband gets
very unhappy if they are not), and I will pick others depending on what is in
season or on sale. Frozen fruit is great for smoothies, and canned fruit is a
last resort, but I keep it in the cupboard just in case.   When buying apples, I like getting the bags of
small apples. Occasionally, I can only find the large apples that are worth
eating. In those cases, we share. I also keep dried cranberries or raisins
around; they are a great substitute for candy. Think &quot;Veggies&quot; at lunchtime. Load sandwiches with spinach and other vegetables like cucumbers, pickles, peppers and more . Then add a baked sweet potato or a
few baby carrots instead of chips. If chips are easy, opt for corn chips and
chunky salsa (limit the chips–don’t let your kids eat out of bag). I also
make sure my kids finish the salsa (1/2 cup serving). You can also serve a salad as the meal with different types dark green lettuces and 2-3 other veggies or fruit. At dinner, serve at least two colorful vegetables . White
potatoes and sweet corn are counted as starches in my kitchen, but a better option
than white bread. Sweet potatoes have become a family favorite and very easy to
cook. I actually prefer to cook them in the microwave.   In fact, the microwave or steamer is my
preferred way to cook most my vegetables. Figure out how to add more veggies to your standard recipes. I have started adding squash, peppers and onions to my spaghetti sauce. I add a
can of black beans and onion to my taco meat. Fajitas are a favorite because
you can cook the meat with onions, peppers, squash and more, and then add salsa
and avocado to finish. Stir-fry dishes are also easy to add lots of veggies to.
Think about trying veggie-full soups. On pizza night, I limit my kids to one
slice, and we add a salad or baby carrots and a fruit. 
 
 For additional tips, I found these resources at  http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/ten-tips.html : 
 Add More Vegetables to Your Day Focus on Fruits Smart Shopping for Veggies and Fruits Liven Up Your Meals with Vegetables and Fruits Kid-Friendly Veggies and Fruits 

 
 Size Matters 
 One thing that we all need to be careful to do as we are
adding vegetables and fruits is to decrease the portions of the other foods.
Taking a cue from the 250 to 400 calorie frozen meals like Lean Cuisine and
Healthy Choice, I serve most of our meals on a 7-inch plate or a soup bowl
(daddy is excused from this). I get the bigger plates out when I want to add
more veggies, but know that I don’t have to cover it entirely–keep food out
of the outer rim. 
 For anyone who needs a visual guide to help them fill a
healthier plate, there are several“portion”plates on the market:

 Last year I rated USDA’s new My Plate, and did not give it a
very good review - I Give the New USDA Dietary Guidelines a C Minus  - but now realize that the My Plate is a good place to start for better eating,
and is best used with the store of healthy eating tips on its website: www.choosemyplate.gov Posted by Food, Mommy! at 8:05 AM 2

 Wordless Wednesday: Our Foodie Summer 
 Our summer has been full of food milestones:
 
 
 We were asked to take part in a sweet corn taste test. The corn is a genetically-modified hybrid developed by Seminis to protect the crop from insects. It was fabulous! I&apos;m all for reducing pesticide use if possible.  
 
 My first homemade banana nut muffins. It was a great use of too-brown bananas. I hate throwing away food! While the bananas were obviously not local, I used a packet of Weinsenberger Mills Biscuit Mix instead of Bisquick (which my Betty Crocker cookbook called for). Weisenberger Mills is located in Midway, Kentucky and purchases grain from many of my farmers!
 
 
 
 We put out our first official garden. I prepared the spot with my trusty garden claw and some of my horse manure. Then we just stuck in some seeds. We planted tomatoes, cucumbers, scallop squash, carrots, and beans. The beans emerged first, followed closely by the squash and cucumbers. The cucumber beetles have really enjoyed our garden, but they seem to be gone now. Keeping the weeds out is also daily work. 
 
 
 
 This mysterious plant cropped up about two feet behind the garden in the hard clay. We are still unsure what it is. Someone suggested it may be a gourd. We will see. It&apos;s getting bigger by the day. 
 
 Our first harvest. Not enough to feed a family of four, but I did cut up the squash and add it to some spaghetti sauce. I am about ready to harvest a few cucumbers. 
 
 The wild blackberries are thick at our house. There are about 50 or more bushes on our property. I loaded the kids up with Deep Woods Off and bowls and off we went. I am amazed they have grown so well without human intervention. It has been very dry here this spring and summer, but I guess we had just enough rain. 
 
 
 
 The first of many blackberry cobblers. It was so delicious. I&apos;m also thinking about trying my hand at blackberry preserves. For breakfast the other morning, I added them on top of a whole wheat tortilla and peanut butter. Roll it up and you&apos;ve got a great on-the-go meal. 
 
 I lost all of my original laying hens to coyotes and hawks.I purchased two new hens and they did not take to the coop. We have yet to catch them, but I recently found where they were laying their eggs... in my hayloft. They are half the size of what I was getting before. I sure do miss my girls. If I try chickens again, I will have to put up a fence. So much for free-range chickens.

 My Meatless Monday: Broccoli Cheese Soup 
 
 If you’ve read my other posts, such as“ Why I choose to eat meat ,”you know I’m a full-fledged omnivore, and not the least bit interested in
trading in my steak knife. Occasionally, however, I do think it is perfectly
acceptable to have a meat-free meal as I believe in providing a variety of
proteins in my family’s diet. But be forewarned: my broccoli soup is far from vegan. The dairy cow was my best friend
in helping me achieve this delicious, kid-approved meal. 
 Finally, My Perfect Broccoli Cheese Soup 
 I learned to love broccoli cheese soup after having it at
several restaurants. It was also a food I never had a problem getting the kids
to eat. I’ve tried a few recipes, but never quite got one I loved until this
one. I started with a recipe I found online ,
and modified it a bit after trial and error (believe me, I had lots of errors.
The last time I made it, I accidently used seafood stock instead of chicken
stock–my sensitive-palleted husband was not happy). 
 Ingredients: Large broccoli crown or 2 small crowns–You need about 3
cups of chopped broccoli
1 medium onion
1 large carrot
3 Tbs. butter for onion
½stick butter for rue
½cup wheat flour
2 cups milk&amp;2 cups heavy cream (or use 4 cups half and half)
4 cups of chicken stock
1 cup sharp cheddar cheese
1 cup Monterey Jack cheese
Salt and pepper 
 Directions: 
 Involve your kids! Learning to cook encourages them to try new foods. 
 
 Sautee’a medium white or yellow
onion in 4 tablespoons of butter. Set aside. Chop broccoli into fine pieces
(about 3 cups). Set aside. Grate a large carrot or several
baby carrots. Set aside. In a stockpot, melt a stick of
butter (1/2 cup) and add 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour, stirring constantly for
3-5 minutes on medium heat. Slowly add a mixture of 2 cups
milk and 2 cups heavy cream while stirring. Add 4 cups of chicken stock and
simmer for 20 minutes. You may need to turn up the heat a bit, but be sure to stir
often. Add the broccoli, onions and
carrots. Cook for 20-25 minutes. Salt to taste (my kids don’t like
pepper, so I don’t use it). I also learned something from seeing the Voltaggio
brothers (Top Chef) at the Incredible Food Show in Kentucky.“If something
doesn’t taste quite right, you probably only need to add salt or sugar.” Add 1 cup of sharp cheddar cheese
and 1 cup of Monterey Jack cheese, and stir until melted. Serve with your favorite bread, another serving of veggies, and
fruit for dessert.

 What Does Healthy Look Like? 
 Today was the moment of truth. I gave myself until the end of the month to be able to complete 25 real push-ups simultaneously, AND I DID IT! My arms felt like they were going to fall off, but I did it, and I am so proud of myself. I am now wondering what my next little fitness goal should be–run the distance between the house and bus stop and back in under 8 minutes, or run two miles on the treadmill in 20 minutes or less. Honestly, I need to work on my flexibility–I’ve never been very flexible, and it seems to be getting worse as I age. So maybe I will try to fit yoga into my routine a couple days a week so I can touch my knees with my forehead.

This entire period of goal setting and exercising with the kids encouraged me to pose this question: What does“HEALTHY”look like? I know that I am medically“defined”as being overweight–10 pounds shy of being at the high end of an optimum BMI–but does that mean that I am unhealthy? I am hoping not.

 Instead of going by physical aptitude, physicians’tests, and the like, most people today tend to dole out the“healthy”adjective to those that look a certain way. She will hate me for doing this, but the photo is of my little sister two years ago when she was competing in a Natural Physique Council bikini contest. Yep, she looks healthy to me! I could be envious and say that I was duped out of getting those good genes, but I know she worked really hard to look that way. She also has a degree in health and fitness and is a certified personal trainer. The interesting thing about her journey to that awesome body is that she said she would never tell a client to eat the way she did for good health. Food choices are very limited. She ate plenty, but her diet was not varied at all. And you should see what all the competitors ate the day of the competition…SUGAR, SUGAR, and more SUGAR.

It was not that long ago–it must have been before the rise of the supermodel–when somebody was referred to as“healthy”it meant they had some meat and fluff on their bones. Parents were worried if their kids were getting enough to eat, and having a little extra in the middle and on their cheeks was a sign of getting plenty. But where is the line between healthy and unhealthy? Can we really tell by“looking at a person?”

I try to remind myself on a regular basis when talking with my child that I need to focus on fitness and quality of diet - not what they look like or the numbers on the scale - but it has been a real struggle for me worrying about how they will be perceived by others.

I was shocked at my kid’s last checkup when my pediatrician called attention to my 3-year-old son’s numbers–he is in the 75th percentile for height and 85th for weight.“I don’t really worry about those things at this age, but we may look at it in the future,”she said. Really? LOOK AT HIM! He is solid as a rock and extremely healthy! So now I’m thinking all this number business needs to be thrown out the window as well. BMI, ideal weight, muscle mass, body fat percentage, waist to hip ratio? What is the real determination of“healthy?”We are unique individuals, and what is healthy for one, may not be healthy for another.

When I was in high school (late 80s/early 90s), I remember hearing a commercial on the radio for a weight loss product while I was riding with other students to a Quick Recall meet. The commercial was a conversation between two teenage girls who were making fun of another girl who weighed 150 pounds. I remember feeling like a complete loser, because I weighed about 160 at the time.“Do they think I weigh that much,”I fretted?“I’ll just have to lie if someone asks me how much I weigh.”And thus the reason why most men think any woman, who is“trim,”no matter how tall she is, weighs 120 pounds or less. WE’VE BEEN LIEING ABOUT OUR WEIGHTS FOR YEARS! I would be thrilled to be 150, or even 160 again, and I know I would look pretty darn good!

I always find myself comparing myself to the Biggest Loser contestants. &quot;I weigh that much, and look nothing like that.&quot; &quot;They must be much shorter than I am.&quot; &quot;Honey, do I look like that?&quot; Finally, I told myself to get over it. We have a wide-screen TV.

My new philosophy is that“healthy”is a feeling, and right now I’m feeling pretty healthy. Will it make me live longer? I don’t know, but at least I’ll be happier than if I was constantly worrying if my dress or pant size makes me an adequate human being. I hope to instill this in my kids as well.
