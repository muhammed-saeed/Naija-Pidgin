McDonald&apos;s goes upscale with Starbucks flair
 
Goodbye, fiberglass tables and bright colors. Hello, faux leather and WiFi.
 By InvestorPlace May 10, 2011 9:11AM 
Right now, the only reason most adults stop and sit awhile at their local McDonald&apos;s (MCD) is to watch their kids hang out at the indoor playground. That or because they have no place to take the take-out, since they work out of their car or truck.




Well, the king of fast food hopes to change that with a massive makeover of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. McDonalds plans to do away with its fiberglass tables and steel chairs to make the restaurant an inviting destination with padded recliners and warm painted interiors that help customers linger -- and maybe spend a few extra bucks.




McDonald&apos;s inspiration? None other than coffee king Starbucks (SBUX) .



 Post continues after video :
 


The plan includes wooden tables, Wi-Fi access, comfortable faux leather chairs and other cafe-style decor that Starbucks has long used to make its stores as much of a selling point as its trademark coffee.




It will be no small undertaking, considering McDonald&apos;s has long been known for its bright colors, fluorescent lights and cartoon mascots. Reports put the price for the move at more than $1 billion.

In addition to stylish interiors, there will be a push to overhaul the iconic exterior of McDonald&apos;s restaurants -- replacing ketchup-red roofs and bright yellow accents with more earth tones and grassy landscapes.




McDonald&apos;s tried several designs before it decided on one used in Tampa, Fla., as the model. It hopes to have that design in about 800 restaurants by year&apos;s end. The chain and franchise owners hope the vast majority of restaurants will be completed by 2015.




So what gives? Surely such an expensive effort isn&apos;t just artistic.




Well, the renovations are the latest and largest effort to date by McDonald&apos;s to attract more high-end customers. The company already has revamped its menu, adding premium sandwiches, cappuccinos and smoothies. It also has added Free Wi-Fi service for laptop and iPad users.

Now the chain, which built its early success on serving customers quickly and getting them out the door with cheap food in hand, obviously believes the $1 billion-plus in renovations can take its operations to a new level.




That&apos;s where the Starbucks model comes in. McDonald&apos;s has already proved it can compete with the coffee crowd, with its highly successful McCafe business fueling a lot of the stock&apos;s success in the past few years. MCD shares are up a stunning 125% in the past five years, compared with just 10% gains for the Dow since May 2006.




Now McDonald&apos;s needs to maintain its dominance -- not just in casual dining but also on the coffee front. Restaurant chains Panera Bread (PNRA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) have seen explosive growth even across the financial crisis.  And after a dip in 2009 revenue, Starbucks is making a comeback and 2011 sales are on track to top pre-recession revenue by 20% to 25%. The Seattle coffee giant is clearly looking to make up ground lost to McDonald&apos;s and others in the past few years.




Of course, McDonald&apos;s is risking a lot with the renovations, with the $1 billion capital outlay only the tip of the iceberg. There are very few restaurants parents can take their kids to for a meal they know they will eat. And there are even fewer restaurants that allow youngsters to run around and burn off penned-up energy. If the newly remodeled stores become too popular with leisurely adults seeking a relaxing atmosphere, McDonald&apos;s could alienate a customer base that has been the cornerstone of its growth for decades. A January Ad Age report estimated Happy Meals account for about 10% of total McDonald&apos;s sales.




The Golden Arches had better be sure the push toward laptop-toting professionals doesn&apos;t alienate this important customer base, or else it will find its renovations not just costly but counterproductive.

 naplespro May 19, 2011 1:46PM I feel this could be very good for Mcdonalds. I&apos;m not sure whom to give feedback to but I would design a separate area for the coffee, stay awhile crowd and PLEASE install receptacles near tables and booths so folks can stay awhile with their laptops..you&apos;d be surprised at how much coffee, cold fraps and other snacks people buy as they are doing business, having business meetings and doing email

They are too young to remember &quot;new Coke&quot;. I even remember Edsel, and I only saw one on the road. Those who do not learn from history....

Cheap, decent coffee is always welcome, but they need to be careful not to forget who they are and who they serve.

 

ELONGBEACH: What do you want, blood from a turnip? So get a salad - they *do* have those there. They even have oatmeal (never been an oatmeal person, but it looked kind of good so I was persuaded to give it a chance). Somehow I have a feeling that nothing they do will be good enough for some of you unless they turn it into a full-blown Whole-Foods-on-deman​d -- and even then, you&apos;d probably still prefer to go somewhere else.

The problem is that you stayed at the &quot;nice&quot; Mcdonalds for over an hour, but didn&apos;t buy any more stuff than if you went through the drive through.

Even though drinks have the margin, and you are much more likely to buy those when you dine in, there are much higher cleaning, decorating, and heating cooling costs with dine in.

I think it&apos;s a great idea...I&apos;m a mother of two and I&apos;m not a big germaphobe but I will never go to a McD&apos;s that has a playland. They&apos;re disgusting. There&apos;s no way they can properly keep that huge thing clean. We avoid them at all costs. I&apos;d rather my kid play in a pile of good old dirt first...

 

We have a newly remodled McD&apos;s in our area that I just love. It&apos;s decorated very nicely, all neutral tones, really cool lighting and artwork on the walls, cozy nooks to sit at and many other seating arrangements that doesn&apos;t make you feel like you&apos;re eating in a fast food restaurant. There is a section geared towards kids that has some video machines which is done nicely but doesn&apos;t consume the place either. Last time I was there I found myself sitting there with my sister and my kids for well over an hour. It was just nice and relaxing and comfy. The one that was there before, it had that huge enclosed play land...I was happy to see it go. If I want my kids to play...we go to a park...there&apos;s another McD&apos;s in the area that was remodled about 10 years ago...I hate it...everything is GRAY!!!!! Gray floor, gray tables, gray seats...everything..​.it&apos;s depressing...not to mention all the seating is out in the open...not comfortable at all. I avoid this one and hit the drive through.

 

And as a mom of two, we&apos;re not obese, we don&apos;t eat at McD&apos;s daily or even weekly for that matter. For us it&apos;s a treat. I don&apos;t see why people keep bashing fast food. You have control over what you eat and what your kids eat. People need to be responsible for their own choices. Plain and simple. Bring on the new McD&apos;s!

RedKngt May 10, 2011 4:34PM this is the worst idea i have ever heard come out of a fast food chain, look what happened to burger king when they &quot;remodeled&quot;, i know and realize it may be different in bigger cities than where i live, but this is beyond stupid. Burger King &quot;remodeled&quot;, i know people who are 6 feet tall that have issues trying to sit down in their &quot;bar seat tables&quot; you cant even fit 2 trays on one of their tables anymore. now mcdonalds thinks its a brilliant move? HA! just wait till someone sues when they spill their coffee on them in one of those chairs lol

 Actually you can polish a turd. They did it on Mythbusters lol. It&apos;s still a turd though. 

 

 So, maybe Starbucks should start making and selling substandard hamburgers to counter McDonalds trying to copy their way of doing things. I bet people would still pick Starbucks.

John Fitzgerald May 10, 2011 4:22PM Greetings to all, look I&apos;m not the &quot;sharpest&quot; tool in the shed, but how about business(s) instead of paying for fancy looks. Pay more to the staff which brings better employees &amp;pay for better quality product? Companies find the $$$ for the frills, but yet to pay employees better there is no cash? If one wants a better product usually one needs to pay more. If you want quality staff then pay more. Companies offer benefits such as insurance yet if your making $7.25 hr. how are you to pay for these benefit(s)&amp;still have $$$ left over to pay over-head of living expenses? Product&amp;service brings consumer into biz the 1st time, it is how the consumer is treated brings them back. Is the product&amp;service quality. Not looks that keep biz going. Just a thought from a fool.

This is a BIG turnaround for them. However, I agree with the poster who suggested that they stop naming items &quot;Mc-something.&quot;

 Previous replies Write a reply... cablecop May 10, 2011 3:26PM McDonalds. Hmmmm.  Egg McMuffin- good. Fries - best in the industry. Times I went to one last year? maybe 3. Worst hamburgers in the industry. Always lukewarm from the plastic holding tray. Every one from hamburger to double angus whatever. Warm and lots of ketchup and a sprinkle of miniscule onion squares and cheap pickle slices. The worst there is. Now free Wi-Fi? Great. Now when traveling cross country, I can stop in the parking lot and bring up TripAdvisor.com and see what else there is in the particular town, and get ratings. Motels too. Ever notice when you think of McDonalds, you can smell the food and the gross oily patties? Can you imagine a real hamburger, just &quot;Primo&quot;, coming out of the worlds largest fast food chain?...........naw.
