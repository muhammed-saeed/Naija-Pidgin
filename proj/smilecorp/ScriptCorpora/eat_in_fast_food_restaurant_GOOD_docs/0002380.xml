		A Barrel of Rants

Tell us how you really feel.
 1 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 11:27:05 AM 



Welcome to The Rants thread.

This thread is designed for people to go off on a rant about what troubles them. Anything that you want to rant about is fair game.

This thread is not The Inferno. Posts containing insults or flames will be moved to The Inferno immediately, even if other parts of the post are on topic. Don&apos;t you hate when that happens?

This is your chance to whine. Enjoy it.


 2 . seadate - 2/15/2001 11:29:08 AM 
I hate these freakin&apos; rules!
 3 . seadate - 2/15/2001 11:30:22 AM 
I hate it that people side with conservatives or liberals and deny themselves an opportunity to search for truth.
 4 . seadate - 2/15/2001 11:31:07 AM 
I think that the conspiracy to kill the Man thread sucks.
 5 . seadate - 2/15/2001 11:32:02 AM 
I hate being ignored when I&apos;m bitching!
 6 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 11:32:56 AM 

Don&apos;t hold back. You&apos;re doing great!


 7 . JudithAtHome - 2/15/2001 11:32:58 AM 

I can&apos;t stand it when people beg for attention by posting the first 4 rants on a new thread!
 8 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 11:33:54 AM 

JAH:

It is like a new jar of Peanut Butter.


 9 . seadate - 2/15/2001 11:34:22 AM 
Ok Judith, you finally figured it out. I&apos;m Rosie.
 10 . mgleason - 2/15/2001 11:36:36 AM 
I loathe and despise the term &apos;politically correct.&apos; People who yap about it are probably the same ones who used &apos;groovy&apos; in the 60s without a trace of irony.
 11 . JudithAtHome - 2/15/2001 11:38:11 AM 

Arrrrrggghhhhhh.....I hate that for sure, seadate!!


Almost as much as I hate having to leave now because a thunderstorm has hit my area. Catch y&apos;all later with more gripes!
 12 . seadate - 2/15/2001 11:38:15 AM 
... and are having tatoos removed. Tatoos ... I hate permanent reminders of temporary feelings.
 13 . seadate - 2/15/2001 11:39:30 AM 
#12 was referring to #10.
 14 . seadate - 2/15/2001 11:45:20 AM 
I hate:

- blown boat engines

- cold days

- warm beer

- doing acrobatic stunts in convertible sports cars

- women who frequently fall overboard

- a day without a belly laugh

- waking up with someone I shouldn&apos;t have ......

 15 . seadate - 2/15/2001 11:45:59 AM 

Now I feel better.
 16 . janjon - 2/15/2001 11:46:51 AM 
I hate abusive behavior of all types. I hate hypocrisy.

Contrary to the views, no doubt, of some, I do NOT hate Republicans. I pity them.
 17 . mgleason - 2/15/2001 11:53:38 AM 
People who come to my house and make remarks like &apos;What do you do with all those books?&apos; in horror-stricken tones make me crazy. All the replies that spring to mind are pornographic in nature.

I wish I had a boat, Seadate, so I could make them walk the plank.
 18 . seadate - 2/15/2001 11:53:54 AM 
Kinda hard pitying anyone who got blow jobs with Clinton&apos;s regularity.
 19 . seadate - 2/15/2001 11:56:13 AM 
Maria,

haha - one reason to leave a tabloid in the guest bathroom.
 20 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 11:57:33 AM 

I hate it when people say &quot;for all intensive purposes&quot;.

I hate it when people say &quot;ek cetera&quot; (sic).

I hate it when people say &quot;aren&apos;t you busting?&quot;.


 21 . seadate - 2/15/2001 11:58:41 AM 
how about &quot;irregardless&quot;?
 22 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 12:01:30 PM 

&quot;Relevency&quot;



 23 . theDiva - 2/15/2001 12:09:38 PM 
or people who use &apos;impact&apos; as a verb.

AAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHH
 24 . Jenerator - 2/15/2001 12:10:11 PM 
Hate is a pretty strong word that I rarely use, so let me tell you what and who I can&apos;t stand:

The word &quot;disengenuous&quot;.

The word &quot;behoove/behove&quot;.

Bill Maher.

Cokie Roberts.

The liberal frenzied side of Crossfire.

Marilyn Manson.

Most &quot;booty&quot; music. It makes me physically ill when I hear women singing about how their man owes them something Ie. gots to be a Gucci. I can&apos;t stand it when men sing about &quot;pounding&quot; some girl he&apos;s cheating on his girlfriend with.

Bad service in restaurants.

People who work as sales associates in stores but don&apos;t know squat about their merchandise. Nothing like asking someone in Lowes, &quot;Where are outdoor mats?&quot; Having them reply, &quot;Is this them?&quot;

Teenaged drivers.

Snobs; especially snobby sales clerks. I was in Neiman&apos;s last week and it was like pulling teeth trying to get the 45 year old clerk to help me. She got nicer when I purchased something, ick!

Electric bills.

The show &quot;Jack Ass&quot; on Mtv, it&apos;s truly terrible.



Okay, that&apos;s enough to get me started on this dreary afternoon.


 25 . seadate - 2/15/2001 12:21:25 PM 
Jen, check your last post, sweetie. *You* were in Nieman&apos;s. (g)
 26 . mgleason - 2/15/2001 12:23:57 PM 
OK, two small nits to pick: &apos;boundry&apos; and &apos;quandry.&apos;
 27 . jexster - 2/15/2001 12:27:03 PM 
Jen and I - oil and water...she&apos;s soooooooooooooooo disingenuous in her rant against my icon Bill Maher
 28 . seadate - 2/15/2001 12:30:55 PM 
Letters from the IRS! They make me feel like I&apos;ve been called to the Principal&apos;s office.


I received a letter yesterday and my stomach turned to a knot. I opened the letter - it was a check for $1.74 (includes $0.01 interest). haha
 29 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 12:40:33 PM 
I hate to be so self-involved.

I hate myself for that. 
 31 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 12:50:52 PM 
I hate any tribal allegiances that restrict the ability to reason. 

 32 . seadate - 2/15/2001 12:54:03 PM 
It&apos;s Britney.
 33 . bubbaette - 2/15/2001 1:00:46 PM 
Jen

Just so&apos;s you know, &quot;disingenuous&quot; is a nicer way of calling someone a liar.
 34 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 1:01:37 PM 
What I hate the most about is the propensity of those who govern to make decisions which are not based on reality but rather on emotions or self-interest. 
 35 . bubbaette - 2/15/2001 1:01:50 PM 
 I loathe and despise the term &apos;politically correct.&apos; People who yap about it are probably the same ones who used &apos;groovy&apos; in the 60s without a trace of irony. 

The folks that I&apos;ve seen use the term want to be able to hold forth on their obnoxious views without any negative feedback.

 36 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 1:04:13 PM 
I hate that Cellar&apos;s list doesn&apos;t include our pretender leader and his cohort. 
 37 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 1:05:08 PM 

Cellar&apos;s post number 30 was moved to The Inferno. Sorry, Cellar, I liked the post, but I&apos;ve got to call them tight or else this thread will turn into another Inferno.


 38 . janjon - 2/15/2001 1:06:46 PM 
so far this is nice fun and games, and it adds a bit of insight about people, I suppose.

But, where, if anywhere, is it supposed to go? Anything more than just a series of what are in effect one liners?


 39 . bubbaette - 2/15/2001 1:07:04 PM 
I am &quot;put out&quot; by restaurants that serve margarine in place of butter and coffee whitener in place of half and half.

I hate and despise people who get dogs, lose interest in them when they&apos;re no longer puppies, and then chain the poor things up in the back yard and give them no further attention except to yell at them to shut up when they bark.
 40 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 1:07:52 PM 
Well, are you going to move my post # 36 too? 
 41 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 1:08:03 PM 

BTW, Cellar&apos;s deleted post included:

 &quot;Brittany Spears, Eminem, Ace of Spades, Sean &quot;Puffy Combs, Sean &quot;Faggy&quot; Hayes, Christina &quot;Screechy&quot; Aguilara, Guy Ritchie, Mrs. Guy Ritchie, Wolf Blitzer, Tucker Carlson, Tucker Quayle, Jim Carrey, Charles Krautheimer, Gertrude Himmelfarb,

oh I could be here &apos;til next week!&quot; 


 42 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 1:09:48 PM 
Oh, don&apos;t worry, Fielding, I am sure that the posters are just testing the ground.
 43 . seadate - 2/15/2001 1:09:51 PM 
yc, you&apos;re much more refined than that. I doubt any of your posts will be moved.
 44 . bubbaette - 2/15/2001 1:11:11 PM 
I hate our disgusting General Assembly who is passing legislation to do away with prohibitions against usery so that &quot;Virginia banks can compete with out-of-state banks.&quot;

I hate banks who charge $1.50 to use their cash machine when the cash machine saves them money over using a teller. In fact, I hate banks in general.
 45 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 1:11:13 PM 
Oh, thanks, Seadate. You mae my day.
 46 . theDiva - 2/15/2001 1:11:16 PM 
Goddammit, I am TIRED of having a backache.
 47 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 1:11:45 PM 
MADE, merde!
 48 . seadate - 2/15/2001 1:12:55 PM 
Bubb,

I agree with you re: margarine. What a freakin&apos; scam the food industry pulled off convincing the general public that margarine poses less of a health risk than butter.
 49 . theDiva - 2/15/2001 1:14:23 PM 
I am TIRED of not being able to put on my own socks and tie my own sneakers.

I am TIRED of people asking me &apos;HAVEN&apos;T YOU HAD THAT BABY YET?&apos;

I am TIRED of not sleeping through the night.

I am TIRED of looking like a whale.

I am TIRED of WHINING AND COMPLAINING.
 50 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 1:14:26 PM 
Seadate, merde is not s****, you know. Just in case you regretted your vey much appreciated compliment. 
 51 . Al D - 2/15/2001 1:16:04 PM 
Oh man, what a bunch of junk this trhread has turned out to be. Fielding, delete all post about except maybe Jen&apos;s &apos;cause there is not one rant no way no how. there is just a buch of grips, whines, chatter. Now I am not saying that I&apos;m the Roger Dangerield of the Mote, but if I&apos;m not, who is. How long ago did I come up with rant idea and even gave a few good examples and told you bozos to go study jexster&apos;s posts &apos;cause he makes better rants by accident than you guys do on purpose. So shape up or ship out, seadate, and quit posting silly little grips and work yourself up to a real blow. this is just the same old crap where one guy comes up with an idea and another bloke confiscates it. I came up with the idea of a story Thread, well not really, it was stamper, but who finally took credit. I can&apos;t remember. e.e. came up with the idea of a sports thread and I think P.P stole that idea or maybe it Ace. Well, don&apos;t expect any more great ideas from me and if I do give them, for god&apos;s sake gert the idea right.

Judith
I forgive you &apos;cause it&apos;s very hard to rant in a thunder storm. That&apos;s a nature rant.
 52 . seadate - 2/15/2001 1:18:50 PM 
Ah, this thread is proving to be a beneficial outlet for sweet Deever.

 53 . theDiva - 2/15/2001 1:18:57 PM 
hey, my #49 is a rant!
 54 . theDiva - 2/15/2001 1:19:23 PM 
seadate

you got that right.


 55 . janjon - 2/15/2001 1:20:45 PM 
Fielding. Cellar had repeated one name twice. You deleted it only once in your repeat listing above.

FWIW.

Which is not much.


 56 . Cellar Door - 2/15/2001 1:24:00 PM 
Well then is this the place to complain about &quot;things&quot; rather than people?
 57 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 1:26:25 PM 
Why don&apos;t you wait before criticizing, Al, and give it a chance.
I hate it when people are forgetful. You didn&apos;t have a thread but I remember that most Moties were rather nice about your Stamper persona. 
 58 . seadate - 2/15/2001 1:26:44 PM 
I obviously don&apos;t meet AlD&apos;s minimum requirements:

1) Incessantly verbose

2) Spell check not allowed

3) Minimum blood alcohol level = ?
 59 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 1:31:52 PM 
Cellar, maybe it happened because Ace was on your list.
 60 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 1:31:57 PM 

Al D:

Niche rant. Spelling counts, otherwise you would have gotten a 6 from the East German judge.


Janjon:

You are correct. I should have done a better job reposting it. I don&apos;t think its worth the trouble fixing now, with the point already made.


Cellar:

You can post about people, but no flames. I recognize that the line can blur.


 61 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 1:32:47 PM 

&quot;Nice rant&quot;, I meant to say.


 62 . Al D - 2/15/2001 1:32:49 PM 
Well, if that don&apos;t beat all. Here I come on and try to be helpful and all I get is misunderstood and insults. Listen, seadate, first in case you haven&apos;t noticed there is no spell check on the Mote, and if one is really ranting you don&apos;t go check for dust and polish the thing up. And lord have mercy, I&apos;m told don&apos;t criticize on a rant Thread. Well, I guess I&apos;ll just go over the the Spiritual Thread and harp at people.

And, seadate, don&apos;t go using that alcohol nonsense when it&apos;s 8:28 am over here and I don&apos;t start my drinking &apos;till 4 pm. Now Fielding, are you going to allow people to make comments about me when I&apos;m nice enough to give you a good rant?
 63 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 1:35:48 PM 

Al:

I didn&apos;t see anybody saying anything nasty about you. ycm said give it a chance, and seadate said he needed to be more drunk to satisfy your criteria. I will watch this closely.


 64 . Al D - 2/15/2001 1:36:13 PM 
Fielding
My response is in the Inferno, where it belogs, or will be soon.
 65 . seadate - 2/15/2001 1:37:26 PM 
Fielding,

I think #62 would score about a 7 1/2.
 66 . PelleNilsson - 2/15/2001 1:38:56 PM 

I&apos;m conflicted.
 67 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 1:40:07 PM 
Al, Fielding did not steal your thread. So you came first with the idea of a rants&apos; thread,...a long time ago. Everyone had forgotten your idea. I never knew about it. I posted to Pelle somewhere around here just a few days ago and asked him about a rant thread. I was not about to take credit for it but you&apos;re being unfair to Fielding. 
 68 . seadate - 2/15/2001 1:40:24 PM 
and confusing
 69 . seadate - 2/15/2001 1:41:07 PM 
68 refers to 66
 70 . Al D - 2/15/2001 1:41:09 PM 
Pelle
Answer in Inferno.
 71 . Jenerator - 2/15/2001 1:47:50 PM 
Oh!! Two more things.

I can&apos;t stand it when people say &quot;maa tour&quot; for mature or &quot;Shhhhhed yule&quot; for schedule.



 72 . Jenerator - 2/15/2001 1:49:06 PM 
Jextser,

It ill behooves you to learn that I am not disingenuous regarding Bill Maher.


 73 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 1:51:58 PM 

Jen:

I hate when people pronounce Nuclear as &quot;Nook-yuh-ler&quot;


 74 . CalGal - 2/15/2001 1:53:16 PM 
I hate the way that Julie Andrews says &quot;sexual&quot;. (check out Victor/Victoria or Our Sons).

And I love Julie Andrews in every other way, so it has to be bad for me to hate it.
 75 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 1:54:18 PM 

Welcome, CalGal. Glad to have you here.


 76 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 1:55:06 PM 
Re-Inferno post to Pelle From AlD: I HATE it when people make jokes and I don&apos;t get them.
 77 . CalGal - 2/15/2001 1:56:34 PM 
I also hate moralistic drivers, earnestness, gender feminism (in fact, identity politics of all sort but there&apos;s a special place in hell for NOW), idiocy, and overcooked beef.
 78 . seadate - 2/15/2001 1:58:19 PM 

I hate the sound of subtlties whizzing over my head.
 79 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 2:02:18 PM 

What is a &quot;moralistic driver&quot;?


 80 . seadate - 2/15/2001 2:04:13 PM 
A male who pisses her off.
 81 . JudithAtHome - 2/15/2001 2:04:56 PM 

I hate going to some party where I know a few but not all of the people there and, upon being introduced, the first thing out of their mouth is &quot;And what do you do?&quot; whereupon I reply &quot;Nothing I don&apos;t want to do...&quot; and after a nervous little laugh, they say, &quot;I mean, what type of work do you do? Where are you employed?&quot; and when I say &quot;I don&apos;t work&quot; they look at me as though I am some species of South American jungle frog crawling across their toe and then they nervously begin to carp and moan about their own job and how much they loathe and detest it and regale any and everyone within earshot about the latest horrible occurance at work and how they want to murder their boss, assistant, customer, anyone they come in contact with during the 8 hours they are forced to endure 5 days a week at this abysmal job they have and when they finally get that out there, they turn to me and say &quot;I don&apos;t see how you can stand not working...I would just go insane!&quot; and I just smile and mentally comment to myself so they don&apos;t hear me, &quot;I think you already have.&quot;

That&apos;s what really bugs me.
 82 . seadate - 2/15/2001 2:05:47 PM 
Not to be confused with a &quot;menopausal hyenic&quot; driver.
 83 . Fielding - 2/15/2001 2:06:42 PM 

Excellant, JAH!


 84 . Al D - 2/15/2001 2:07:26 PM 
Judith
Hear, here (just to be on the safe side.
 85 . JudithAtHome - 2/15/2001 2:08:08 PM 

I hate it that seadates post about menopausal hyenas landed right after my rant.
 86 . JudithAtHome - 2/15/2001 2:08:53 PM 

Thank you, thank you very much!
 87 . seadate - 2/15/2001 2:09:54 PM 
Judith, toldya I&apos;m really rosie.
 88 . JudithAtHome - 2/15/2001 2:11:12 PM 

seadate:

I know you are not...you make far too much sense.
 89 . mgleason - 2/15/2001 2:12:30 PM 
That happens to me, too, J. I tell those people that as a lily of the field, I toil not, nor do I spin. You should see their faces after that .
 90 . janjon - 2/15/2001 2:12:44 PM 
I&apos;m not sure I can say that I hate, but I certainly dislike intensely, stores where the help is too friendly. Used to be that New York was immune to this, but even here you get those perky greeters at the door (I take comfort in knowing that their REAL job is to look out for shoplifters.) But elsewhere, especially in this country, it is like a plague. When I go to a store to buy, say, a shirt, I don&apos;t want to be verbally accosted by the sales help wondering how I am, where I am from, and am I having a nice day.

Of course, this problem is abating somewhat because even in the nicer stores there is less and less sales help around.

But that is another peeve.
 91 . seadate - 2/15/2001 2:13:55 PM 
Judith, Maria:

You shoulda seen the looks I got when I told &apos;em I was a deckhand.
 92 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 2:14:54 PM 
A real rant. Great sentence, Judith! I am out of breath. -:) 
 93 . JudithAtHome - 2/15/2001 2:16:48 PM 

YC:

I&apos;ve got a million of &apos;em!
 94 . seadate - 2/15/2001 2:20:06 PM 
I hate it that, due to my random attention span, I can&apos;t post a rant as lengthy as Judith or Al or janjon.
 95 . mgleason - 2/15/2001 2:21:17 PM 
Ah, Seadate, how socially unacceptable of you.

Occasionally I run into people who are very much shocked by the idea that I don&apos;t do anything with myself, since I am no longer actively involved in my profession. To them I reply that I spend a large portion of the day giving thanks for not being shackled by bourgeois sensibilities.
 96 . seadate - 2/15/2001 2:27:50 PM 
Maria,

My typical answer is either &quot;I&apos;m a Peacemaker&quot; or &quot;I&apos;m Director of Janitorial Services for (the local school district)&quot;. For the latter, I go into detail about my duties, their challenges, and how I climbed to this pinnacle after starting at the bottom - this is the truth.
 97 . bubbaette - 2/15/2001 2:29:07 PM 
Tell em&apos; you&apos;re a Nuclear Theologist.
 98 . JudithAtHome - 2/15/2001 2:29:55 PM 

I say I&apos;m a creative leisurist, and I say it with one eyebrow raised and a slight smile.
 99 . mgleason - 2/15/2001 2:30:26 PM 
That would be &apos;nucular,&apos; Bub.

seadate - in New York City, being the chief janitor at even an elementary school is a BIG deal. Lots of money to be spent and virtually at the janitor&apos;s discretion, since the way the system works it is virtually impossible to hold the janitors to any standard of accountability. I kid you not.
 101 . seadate - 2/15/2001 2:33:54 PM

ha...Al...great rants bout the rant thread. Hello to ee also...just want to point out that PP&apos;s SportsBar was an idea of the original Mote Fathers/Mothers, and that before that I hung out a lot in the old Fray Sports Thread(unhosted). Wouldn&apos;t hurt anyone to make Al D a co-host...the more involved here the better.
 106 . JudithAtHome - 2/15/2001 2:38:28 PM 

Okay, this may get me in trouble with those who usually frequent the Religion thread but I don&apos;t like going to a civic function where a business meeting is about to take place and have a prayer to the Lord offered up prior to the opening of business. They do this in my village at all civic business meetings and I don&apos;t think the Lord, if indded there is one, is all that interested in whether the Garden Club is going to vote on spending a wad of money on spring bulbs for village beautification projects.
 107 . janjon - 2/15/2001 2:38:56 PM 
I thought surely someone would have addressed this one before now, but since not, here goes: I get really surly when I pick up the phone and say hello and am met by a second or two of dead air, since I now know that this is yet another computer driven call and that within the next second or so some usually young or if not young certainly inexperienced telemarketer is going to ask to speak to Mr.XXXXXX (almost always managing to mangle my not terribly difficult name) and then go into a pitch. It is only a residual pity for the poor telemarketer that keeps me from going ballistic (which I will do if the telemarketer, poor or not, becomes unduly persistent.

My tolerance, limited as it is, is inverse to whether the call is after, say, 9 in the evening or on Saturdays or Sundays.
 108 . seadate - 2/15/2001 2:40:13 PM

Judith - one of the many, many virtues of living in New York City is that the Lord is kept in his place and only those who want to venture forth to those places need endure him/it/whatever.

I hate sales parties (plastic, jewelry, crystal, cosmetics, etc.) where &quot;friends&quot; and acquaintences put you on the spot to buy over-priced crap that you don&apos;t want or need so that they can get &quot;free&quot; crap from the catalog. Right --there&apos;s nothing better I&apos;d like to do than to come over to your house on one of my two days off work this week to get made-up like a clown by some gal driving a pink escort.

When I was young, my mother used to always buy that &quot;Grit&quot; newspaper that kids would sell because, she said, they were likely poor and needed the money. Does the same thing apply to Amway, Tupperware, Mary Kay and the like? If you need the supplemental income, how&apos;s about I just make a direct donation rather than endure a sales pitch in your home?

Re #116. Bigwigs in Russia answer with &quot;Speak!&quot;. A certain type of French answer &quot;J&apos;ecoute&quot; (I listen).

But my gripe with the &quot;Hello&quot; answer has to do with efficiency. Suppose you call the office of Mr Smith with whom you have never spoken before. The following ensues:

He: &quot;Hello&quot;
You: &quot; Mr Smith?&quot;
He: &quot;Speaking&quot;

Because of my age, people often make assumptions that I have grandchildren...of course, the types of people who make these assumptions do it to people 10 years younger than I am, too. But I wouldn&apos;t mind so much if they would just take no for an answer. Instead, these pushy assholes say things like &quot;Oh, you must be kidding? YOU don&apos;t have any grandchildren? But you are so perfect to be a grandmother! Tell that boy to get busy and give you some grandchildren!&quot; and on and on, ad nauseum, til I want to scream. And then, when they have pushed this all beyond the bounds of normal, polite discourse into the realm of bonafide rudeness, they become offended when I am driven to respond with &quot;I&apos;m sure he&apos;d love to have a child but unfortunately chemotherapy left him sterile.&quot; I realize this is lowering myself to their level by saying something so startling but it is worth it to see the shock and dismay on their faces and that is usually the last thing I ever have to see of them, too.

Fielding, we&apos;re counting on you to keep this thread going. You can&apos;t allow the dark forces of the Mote (conspiring jealous heffers(sp) who hate to see the possessors of penii enjoy themselves) to send this thread the way of the sorely missed Man Thread.
 213 . JudithAtHome - 2/15/2001 6:01:25 PM 

All we need to see this thread succeed is to stay angry at lifes little irritations...all we need to see it fail is be content with the status quo.

I think it will succeed.

If my next-door neighbor, a lovely woman, tells me one more time that I &apos;need to get more sun,&apos; she will be courting grievous bodily harm. As I have told her about a half-billion times, I am photosensitive, and lupus symptoms are exarcebated by prolonged exposure to the sun. Not only that, but I&apos;m very fair-skinned and even though this is FLORIDA, land of relentless sunshine, I DO NOT TAN, I burn. So no, I won&apos;t go to the beach in the middle of the day with her, I won&apos;t lay out by the pool, I won&apos;t play tennis unless it&apos;s dusk, etc. This is news to her? I feel like telling her that I&apos;m a fucking vampire, and then demonstrate, la the ineffable Dr Lecter.

Bah.

Could I talk to you in Health Policy?

Sure, J.

The life of the thread will be dictated by its users. So far it looks pretty popular. Lets see what people think a month from now.

I do promise this: I won&apos;t wimp out like some other hosts.

I agree...but Dr.X is the little &quot;g&quot; god. (That is sort of a joke.)

Dadgum. I just hate it when a new thread gets started on a day when I have to work and I really want to read the posts in it but it&apos;s so blasted popular I already have 220 to go through. Guess I&apos;d better get busy reading.
 222 . labwabbit - 2/15/2001 7:47:48 PM 
Ya..hop to it!
 225 . mgleason - 2/15/2001 8:04:05 PM 
You can&apos;t leave it at that, YCM. You&apos;ve already copped to the Scientology books; what could be worse than that? (Unless it&apos;s a collection of Hubbard&apos;s SF, that is.)
 226 . concerned - 2/15/2001 8:04:14 PM 
I don&apos;t know precisely &apos;who&apos; ycmeehan is, but I recall she got suddenly and remarkably pissy over a mildly kidding comment I directed her way.

Here&apos;s an idea. Leave those Scientology books at a fast food restaurant or donate them to charity, if one will take them.
 227 . labwabbit - 2/15/2001 8:07:05 PM 
yc

Sneak em to the library &quot;donation&quot; box. Sort of like leaving the baby in the basket on the church steps technique.
I for one wouldn&apos;t &quot;hate&quot; you for doing so.
 230 . mgleason - 2/15/2001 8:17:57 PM

 231 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 8:31:09 PM 
mgleason,
Must be a Scientologist trick. 
 232 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 8:53:12 PM 
because I hate cats, just as labwabbit does. Look at the last sentence of the Lawabbit&apos;s last post. 
 233 . labwabbit - 2/15/2001 9:00:21 PM 
So the variable remains undefined of what&apos;s in the mystery box, perhaps to meet fate&apos;s next progression....
 234 . mgleason - 2/15/2001 9:02:26 PM 
The smart money says it&apos;s a collection of Hubbard&apos;s SF. She wouldn&apos;t be that ashamed about mere porn.
 235 . labwabbit - 2/15/2001 9:04:12 PM 
...a cat...a step-son...perhaps a collection of cold and snowy weather reports.

Probably an empty one...a soul sold to scientology.
 236 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 9:21:33 PM 
A snowy ninny is still ninny, Neaner.

A Rants thread, huh ?

Okay, let&apos;s see...

&quot; Independent &quot; Truthseekers and Problem Solvers such as Matt Drudge and Bill O&apos;Reilly, et all, who continually claim that all they are really interested in is dispensing all the &quot;facts&quot; that our supposedly &quot;Liberal&quot; media misses out on. Nevermind that they&apos;ve elevated strawmen, red herrings, slippery-slopes, dyphemisms, false dilemmas, subjectivist fallacies, and outright falsehoods to a never before seen art level, but that the target of their rants curiously enough always seems to be anything or anyone on the left.

I concur with:

Seadate&apos;s Message # 3 

Judith&apos;s Message # 81 

Janjon&apos;s Message # 90 

People who blow their nose during a meal. I guess it&apos;s an accepted practice in this culture, but I just don&apos;t understand it ... Would one flatulate at the dinner table ?

Hypocrites

Dates who want to go everywhere and do everything in one night -- with the exception of the sex thang, of course. ;-)

Any type of Betrayal .

Materialistic people

Bob Dornan, Dick Armey, Jesse Helms, Phil Gramm, Bill Hannity, Madonna, BSB&apos;s, InSync, Misogynistic rap music which instead glorifies gold chains, nice cars, and 40 ouncers...There&apos;s too many to mention here.

People who don&apos;t make the slightest effort to recycle.

Illegitimate parents

Cold food

Thieves

( What a &quot;whiner&quot;, huh ? )
 238 . ycmeehan - 2/15/2001 9:30:29 PM 
Well, thanks, Concerned, I am flattered that you talk to me now. I was in the Slate&apos;s Fray. I am the one who got in trouble with JJ in Politics. Thanks for the suggestion.

mgleason,
There&apos;s porn and porn but no, it wasn&apos;t that.
I&apos;ll tell you if see you one day.

 240 . arkymalarky - 2/15/2001 10:34:51 PM 
I enjoyed this thread, but Bubba&apos;s two posts made me laugh out loud. Those home parties have got to be the most torturous of inventions. The marketers know how hard it is to tell &quot;friends&quot; and neighbors no. Thanks to them, I&apos;ve developed that skill pretty well.
 241 . concerned - 2/15/2001 10:40:52 PM 
Hey, cellar. Can I have Buddy?
