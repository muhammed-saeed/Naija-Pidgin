 The Facebook reply I should write 
 
When you have a Facebook feed full of friends, family and acquaintances, you often see a post that makes you desperate to reply honestly. If you wish the author to stay a friend or acquaintance however, often you can’t answer how you would like.

 

For example…

 Girl’s Status: Now. What should I wear for the church NYE party this year. Are skin tight, leather leggings too much?

 What I’d like to reply: Too much? No, not too much–it’s obviously not enough! How are skinny leather leggings going to cover an arse that sports cheeks that live in different postcodes? Far, far too little, please don’t do it. Hope this helps.

 Ferguson:“Kiss my arse or I walk” 
 
 

 Above: Sir Alex pictured outside the City of Manchester stadium last week 

Sir Alex Ferguson has toughened up his already dictatorial press conference rules, and today issued an ultimatum to the world’s media saying “Kiss my arse or I walk”

The Scot recently walked out of a press conference after a journalist dared to suggest that Manchester United were “struggling in Europe”.

Man Utd are in a Champions League group with Benfica, who last won the competition in the early 1960’s, FC Basel who have hardly any European Cup history to talk of and the third team are a team that I have never heard of and cannot pronounce. This ‘team’ from Romania are playing in their first ever UEFA Champions League, and have not yet got a point on the board.

Despite being in what should be an easy group for Ferguson’s team who have won the European Cup three times, they sit second in the group behind Benfica, having drawn three games and won only twice. Both of those wins were against the new boys from Romania who are yet to pick up a point incidentally. So they’re second, in a three horse race.

It would therefore appear a fair shout to describe Manchester’s second team as “struggling in Europe” but clearly the old soak didn’t agree.

Today, Sir Alex decided to spell out exactly what he would and wouldn’t tolerate in future press conferences by setting out a manifesto for journalists to read and remember called “Kiss my arse or I walk”

Inside, the document prohibits a starling array of things that journalists will not be allowed to do from now on, unless you want to see him walk off in a strop.

 They include: 

 Mentions of Manchester City being top Mentions of Manchester City spending money Mentions of Manchester City (other) Any words that directly criticise Sir Alex Any words that indirectly criticise Sir Alex Any words that criticise Man Utd, its players, staff or results. The numbers 6 and 1 are underlined and in bold Noisy neighbours Quiet neighbours Granny shagging The first iffy penalty to be awarded against Man Utd Old Trafford in the club’s history Slavery, and its likeness to playing at Man Utd 

 The list went on and on …

 Domino’s Pizza complaint letter 
 
This email went to Domino’s Pizza yonks ago…I am yet to receive a reply.

In the time since this email was sent, I estimate that I have ordered around 30 Papa John’s Pizza’s and 0 from Domino’s. If we say the average order is £15,  that amounts to about a £450 loss in takings because their store‘manager’acted like a dick.

 

Dear Tracey,

Thank you for your prompt email, I’m only sorry that my response has been somewhat delayed.

Since that day I have learned that the payment did indeed fail, but that wasn’t really the point of my complaint. For the record, the card failed because somebody had attempted to hack my account, and Santander in their infinite wisdom had placed a block on the card until such a time that they were able to speak to me.

The focal point of the complaint should be that I had been a regular customer of Dominos Pizza for many years, and there had never been a problem with payment previously. Incidentally, I was not asked to make additional payment arrangements when the payment failed–and I received an email to say my order had been accepted. Maybe this is the first thing that needs to be addressed if you are interested in stopping this sort of thing happening again?

Anyway, back to ‘Pizza-gate’ The pizza arrived, and I told the driver that I had paid online, and he went away looking slightly puzzled but satisfied on the whole I thought. I tucked in to what, as it turns out, was my last ever taste of Dominos Pizza. The very polite, sensible and apologetic driver returned a few minutes later to tell me that the store had told him that I hadn’t in fact paid. I told your very polite and apologetic driver that I had in fact entered my card details, and the order arrived, so I was pretty sure that payment had been made. It was at this point that the driver asked if I would be so kind as to call the manager, as he was clearly and understandably stuck between a rock and a hard place. I have since learned that the ‘rock’ was located somewhere between your store manager’s ears at precisely the point where you would normally expect to find logic, reason and human thought.

Tracey, this call is when the wheels came off.

I called the manager and explained that I had ordered with my card online, and nothing had given me any reason to suspect that there had been a problem. Tracey, I know now there was a problem now but I didn’t at that time so please do bear with me here.

Your manager basically told me I had to give my card details again immediately, pay cash, or return a pizza that I was one and a bit slices into already. I incredulously asked him if he would seriously rather have a part eaten pizza back that take a punt on a regular customer coming up with the readies the next day, and he confirmed that to be the case.

THAT is where a man who clearly has no common sense or customer service acumen managed to ruin my day.

What use prey is a pizza, with bits missing and by the time it arrived back and pretty cold I’d imagine to Domino’s Pizza at after 11pm on a Monday night? You had already paid to make it and assuming for a second that the market for second hand pizza is not buoyant, what in the name of Beelzebub was he trying to achieve?

I offered to check with my bank first thing the next morning, and if there was a problem, I would have gladly dropped the cash into the store that day. I asked him to check my order history. Dominoes have delivered to my mortgage heavy house many, many times. I would be amazed it you told me that you have terrible trouble with regular customers selling up and running for the borders when their Hot&amp;Spicy with extra pineapple turns out to be a pain in the wallet?

The man was devoid of any common sense, and offended me into the bargain. Not only did his demands suit nobody, but also he has now ensured that I don’t use your company again.

It’s a shame, because I do like your pizzas but it is the principle.

It’s the only way a mere customer like me can register his disgust after receiving poor, poor service.  I dare say that Papa John’s will not notice their profits increase any more than Domino’s will notice theirs diminish. One customer, however regular, doesn’t make or break a business (despite your invigorating“Every order counts”motto) I realise that having worked at several national newspaper groups over the years. I just thought you should have the chance to put such“computer says no”thinking to the sword before that one customer turns into a hundred, or a thousand …

I hope you have a good day.

Best,

Mike

P.S. The beans on toast with grated cheese I was forced to eat that evening was nutritiously more beneficial, and saved me a few quid it’s fair to say, but honestly it didn’t hold a candle to the pizza that I had whipped from under my expectant nose that evening.

 Racists defiant and point to ‘world-wide support’ 
 
 

Racists everywhere were defiant yesterday, which is most out of character for your average racist, and pointed to ‘worldwide support’ as if this in some sort of way was vindication for their racists ways.

These nasty bastards are usually as quiet as a mouse, but something said by someone yesterday sparked a fire within this lot, and they all started alluding to the fact that they must be right to persecute those who do not share their particularly poisonous white gene pool, because of this ‘worldwide support’ that they have.

Mr Black, the most inappropriately named leader of a white nationalist group that you could ever wish to avoid said “We have support all over the world, so fuck you lot. I’m right, and you’re wrong.”

A spokesman for the KKK also piped up with a pearler saying “If I say something to a black man, and then my racists brethren across the globe support me, then this makes me right does it not?”

Politicians were last night worried that anarchy could break out across the land, if ‘world-wide support’ would stand up in a court of law. Judge Ludicrous said “How am I supposed to send the nations scum away for a ten stretch, if they are going to start waving ‘world-wide support’ in my face like a get out of jail free card?”

 Heinz make me suspicious of food 
 
I have grown up with the view that fruit&amp;vegetables are good for you. At some point in my journey from childhood to adulthood I was taught about the magical 5-a-day.

About two months ago on my drive back from the golf course I heard a radio advert from Heinz, who were trying to tell me that a tin of Heinz tomato soup counted as one of my five a day. A tin. Of soup. I let that slide, but it has been in the back of my mind ever since. Today it resurfaced, when I pulled a tin of Heinz baked beans out of the cupboard to find that they too are supposed to contribute towards my five a day.

I know that tomatoes feature in the manufacture of both products, but surely there can’t be much goodness left in either tin, by the time it reaches my home?

I looked at the back of the tin for more information on how Heinz came to make this surprising claim, and found that 1/2 a tin of beans contributed one of my required five a day if eaten as part of a balanced diet.

Sorry, say that again? How does that work then? So if I have 1/2 a tin of beans of a morning, they will only give me the nutrients and goodness expected of one of your five a day if I promise to eat well for the remainder of the day?

What happens if I eat the beans, then gorge on fast food and deep fried Mars bars for the rest of the day? How do the beans take back the goodness? They are either one of my blessed five a day or they aren’t, surely?

This on the day that I read online that frozen vegetables can be more healthy than fresh in some cases. I really don’t know what to think about food anymore, and I think the Food Standards Agency, the NHS or the British government need to do a lot more to make it absolutely clear what is good, what is best, and what isn’t so good ASAP. I am trying to be healthy, but there is so much misinformation on the internet, mixed with marketing guff that I don’t know what is best anymore.

 Gary Neville has Liverpool roots 
 
Despite making a career out of claiming to hate Liverpool and everybody from Liverpool, it has hilariously been announced today that Gary Neville’s family tree took root there long before the runt faced little cunt was born.

 

Genealogists have found that Neville’s great, great, great grandparents hail from Merseyside.

Neville was the player that opposing fans loved to hate, opposing players would love to punch and all wrapped up with a face that only a mother could love. These revelations are likely to heap more embarrassment on to a family who counts a man by the name of Neville Neville in its number.

The former Manchester United defender who is currently ruining Sky’s football coverage with his year-round Movember effort and rabbit-in-the-headlights commentary famously said“I can’t stand Liverpool, I can’t stand the people, I can’t stand anything about them”

Gary Neville was unavailable for comment despite now being a media whore, but the City of Liverpool are reportedly shocked and embarrassed about these shocking revelations.

 Rant! Spatial awareness&amp;boarding the train 
 
Anybody that gets a train at the same time each day knows that there are rules of engagement.

 

Firstly, you need to make sure you are standing precisely in the place in which you will be greeted by open doors when the music stops. If you end up staring at a window when the train stops your chance of getting a seat are gone. In fact, depending on how close the train is to its final destination you may well have ruined any chance you had of even boarding the train! I give thanks to South West Trains every morning for this particular delight. Higher fares, less space. It’s a mantra that any fat cat would be proud of.

Anyway, don’t get me started on that now, maybe another time.

Secondly you want to be as near the track as you can be so you have a heightened chance of getting a seat. If you are in the right space but three or four people back from the track you are on dodgy ground, and may come up short.

Thirdly, you need to‘please move down right inside the car and make use of all available space’once you have actually made it board. It’s an announcement made every morning, on every train, to ever cunting commuter and yet it seems the hardest thing for people to grasp.

People are very good generally at putting points one and two into place. They tend to struggle with point three.

A cynical person might point to the fact that commuters stand to personally gain something from putting the first two edicts into practice, whereas point three requires the average commuter to think about somebody other than themselves for a few seconds.

A non-cynical person would probably put forward some warm and fuzzy reasons that absolve the commuter in question if being a massive selfish cunt, before being forced to agree with the cynic.

Picture the scene if you will. Twenty or so people have placed their stake in the ground. For them, this spot here is where the doors will stop and open the way to the Promised Land. Every bastard one of them is looking around as casually as they can act, pretending to look at the arrivals board, or the horizon from which a train is hoped to arrive, but what they are actually doing is calculating which of these other selfish bastards are competition for an early entry and what they can do to further advance their own chances while trampling on the hopes of others. Fuck ‘em runs richly through the veins of this horrible crowd.

You see them fiddle with bags, newspapers or whatever else while ever so slightly edging forward to gain an advantage. It’s almost invisible to the naked eye, which is testament to the saying that‘practice makes perfect’if ever I there was one. Sometimes however an attack-minded move is not possible, but a sideways move is on the cars in order to ensure that nobody sneaks past you. Spatial awareness is at an all-time high for these utter cunts in this moment and it’s only a matter of minutes before they learn whether their tactical play will yield them the right result. For them. Fuck everybody else, naturally.

At this moment, each one of those insufferable pricks could tell you the position of everybody around them, so why is it that as soon as the doors open and the cunt in question is on board, does all the urgency leave their lumbering frame?

People behind them are still very much in their personal zone, and are panicking slightly as they are not yet on board. They get to the yawning mouth they so desire, only to find that the person before that, you know the one who was so keen to block them off and lunge on board milliseconds before them has stopped dead just inside the door!“MOOOOOOVE!!!!”

In this situation I can feel the rage build within me if I’m still on the outside of the train and it’s as much as I can do to stop myself screaming“move down you utter, utter cunt!”

By now the people just outside the train are bunching up because the rate of entry is slowed to a trickle. This is of course because once the early winners in the commuter game are on board, they stop for a bit of a mooch.

“MOVE OUT OF THE WAY YOU SELFISH, INCONSIDERATE BASTARDS !!!”

The guard blows his whistle on the platform, and now slight panic on the outside manifests itself into action. The collective mind-set seems to say“well, the doors are about close, so if that fuck wit in front isn’t going to move out of the way into the pockets of space further inside, then we’ll give him a bit of a shove”…and so it begins.

Selfish cunts just inside the doors being slowly squeezed into the space that any decent human being would have walked into before it came to this. Then we get the cherry on top, the icing on the cake, the piece de resistance if you will allow such Frenchness.The fucktards that were blocking the door in their selfish fug, start to look put out that the people behind with whom they had just been jostling, actually want to get on this train and make it a little more crowded! Raised eyebrows and tutting ensues until everybody is on-board.

This happens every single day and that from the so-called ‘intelligent race’

 Breaking news … Tevez refused to play with Balotelli 
 
As if things couldn’t get any worse for Mancini in the Tevez saga, reports are emerging today that Carols Tevez refused to play with Mario Balotelli at his home in Mottram St. Andrew earlier this month.

 

Tevez was reported to have said “Mario asked me to play with his bangers and his massive rocket. We were in his bathroom at the time, and I thought it was too dangerous so I refused and went home”

Mario Balotteli was apparently furious at being spurned by Tevez, and went on a drinking spree, playing with his own bangers and rocket. He was playing so furiously however that disaster struck and he set fire to his house as has been reported recently.

Mancini will not want these fresh allegations to do anything to hinder Man City’s impressive recent form, but I bet the City manager can’t wait to off–load the egotistical, stupid wanker in January. Mancini is also reportedly looking to off Tevez in the same transfer window.

 Stoke City forced to admit Ba has two legs 
 
The Stoke City physiotherapy team led by Dave Watson were forced into an embarrassing climb down last night, when Demba Ba was seen at the club using two legs to carry himself around the Britannia stadium scoring goals for fun.

 

Stoke turned down the option to buy the Senegalese striker in January because they feared that he may in fact have three legs, but after smashing three goals in against them last night Tony Pulis was left to explain why his head physiotherapist had not noticed that he had only two fully functioning legs.

“It’s baffling” opined the Stoke boss. “I remember seeing Demba in the physiotherapist’s office having his medical, naked as the day he was born, and I too could have sworn he had three legs.”

Sky Sports were at the Britania Stadium last night, and close-ups of the player clearly show just the regulation two legs protruding from his shorts. “After the second goal went in, I had to go and check my medical notes” said Dave Watson. “Incredible. Newcastle Untied must have given the lad an operation.”

Stoke City’s entire squad have only managed eight goals so far this season, which ironically is the number Demba Ba has managed on his own for Newcastle. “I am very happy to be at Newcastle and to prove that I have just two legs like the rest of the team” said the jubilant striker. “I just don’t understand why they thought I had a third leg”

Stoke City fans were booing the Newcastle hitman and one of the more vocal supporters was heard to shout“he’s only got two legs yer twats”as an ashen faced Tony Pulis looked on.

 Breaking news … Police called to Wayne Rooney’s house 
 
Greater Manchester police were called to the house of footballer Wayne Rooney today after he made a complaint about his neighbours.

 
 

Rooney complained that the neighbours were “dead noisy, and won’t shut up. He also complained that they had spent a load of other people’s money on gravy and that they are beating everyone that goes near them”

When police asked how he could hear his neighbours when they were so far away from his house Rooney said “Well I haven’t heard them meself like, but the boss went mental in training today and started shouting&amp;ranting about them. He’s dead upset, so I just wanna get them sorted for his sake really”

Rooney has this week been nominated for the prestigious Ballon d’Or, but isn’t thought to be troubling the annual award at Mensa.

 Breaking News … Chelsea urge council to let them stay at the Bridge 
 
Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea FC owner, has pleaded with Hammersmith&amp;City council to help the club stay at their home ground of Stamford Bridge after the billionaire oligarch had a failed bid to buy the freehold.

 

Chelsea fans gathered outside the ground to talk to the BBC cameras, and one particularly industrial gentleman said “The council ave got to let us stay here, yer knaa what I mean?” Surprisingly, the interviewer did seem to know what he meant and he continued by saying “You can’t just come in here with yer bawllldozers and destroy ten years of history, it aint right, yer knaa what I mean?”

Hammersmith&amp;City council were unavailable for comment.

 The day the banter died 
 
Football fans all over the country are fed up with being called names, it was revealed yesterday.

 

Brighton&amp;Hove Albion started the movement by lobbying the Football Association to do more to stop homophobic chants and a wave of uprising crashed through the country in the clearest sign yet that ‘enough is enough’ for the nations football fans.

It seems that banter is the latest thing to be under attack in today’s game where you can barely make a tackle without being sent off. Mike Angryman took to the streets of the UK to ask if football fans agreed that banter had to stop.

First stop had to be Brighton of course, the epicentre of this new storm, and as we got the camera gear out of the truck we heard local resident Wayne hail us “Ooooooooooh eeeee, hellloooooooooo” When asked about the gay chanting at Brighton’s new stadium, Wayne couldn’t really help as he had never been to a football match in his life. “I sleep most of Saturday to be honest love, after a HEAVY Friday night if you know what I mean”

Next up we went to Swansea to try and find some Swans. Whilst driving through the country we saw a bloke talking to woolly beast, so we stopped for a chat. “yeah, I’m sick of it personally” Said Swansea City fan, Dave. “Sheep shaggers isn’t a very nice thing to say isn’t it? It’s not all about sex, we do have feelings as well you know”

We caught up with Eddie from Liverpool who seemed to have locked himself out his car when we met, and he seemed to agree.”Yeah I’m sick of it to be honest. If I had a pound for every-time I heard opposition fans singing that we’re thieves&amp;a jobless then I’d be a rich man”. I’m pleased to say that Eddie managed to get into his car as we left, although he made a terrible mess of the drivers-side lock.

In Ipswich we spoke to Farmer Giles about football and his views on the terrace chanting that seems to have got people’s goat. “We’re not all farmers. Well, I am obviously, and my three brothers are who have season tickets, but there are some other professions that go as well”

So there we have it. The nation has spoken. In a week where the gay capital of the UK complained about homophonic chanting, we have proof that fans up and down the country are subjected to some sort of banter from opposing fans. Shocking and revelatory as I am sure you will agree.

 Betting scandal latest! It’s just not cricket … or sport. 
 
A betting syndicate have allegedly won millions of pounds illegally, by fixing the recent test match between Pakistan and England. The protagonists are thought to be overloads and gangsters in Pakistan, as well as some people on the ground in the UK.

 

The gangsters paid Pakistani cricketers to make certain actions happen during the match with England, so that they could place bets on that action and illegally win large sums of cash from unsuspecting bookmakers.

New Scotland Yard intercepted several of text messages however that were sent between the Pakistan cricket team and the ‘fixers’ in the UK that appear to prove that there was match-fixing taking place.

In one such message, the fixer asked “Make the team – with the obvious exception of the man bowling – stand absolutely still for the first two hours of play” and low and behold that action happened and bookmakers lost millions in fraudulent pay-outs.

Although there was a substantial amount of money bet on the above action, police chiefs said on its own that message wasn’t conclusive proof of any wrongdoing. Detective Inspector Marshal explained “If you’ve ever watched cricket happen, you’ll notice that 95% of the men on the field do absolutely nothing for very long periods, and so the action explained is too common for it to raise suspicions of corruption”

However, further messages were intercepted which most certainly did set the alarm bells ringing.

One message from a man in Kentish Town to the team captain in Pakistan read “One by one, remove all of your fielders from the pitch, until you only have the bowler and the batsman playing”. This action was successful and yielded millions more in won bets. “This is highly irregular” said D.I. Marshal. “We know from watching tapes of previous cricket matches that although most of the players on the field do fuck all for most of the match, they do at least have the decency to stay on the field”

Police finally swooped when they saw a text message that asked the Pakistani fielders to all “do the Macarena while the bowler runs up to the wicket”

More as we get it.

 Breaking…Anton Ferdinand DOES know what he is! 
 
As the race row rumbles on, Anton Ferdinand responded to Chelsea fans and their taunts in Genk last night by confirming that he does indeed know‘what he is.’

 

As Chelsea made hard work of it against what are surely must be a made up team, their fans amused themselves with witty chants such as “Anton, you know what you are” which is probably one of the finest terrace chants to ever pass human lips as I am sure you’ll agree.

After training today, we asked Anton Ferdinand the question. The interview would have gone a little bit like this had it not been completely fictitious:

 Mike – So Anton, do you know what you are?

 Anton – Yeah I know what I am.

 Mike – Oh I am glad. The Chelsea fans in Gonzo or wherever it was said you did, and this seems to confirm it.

 Anton – They don’t need to worry, I know what I am. Do you know what you are?

 Mike – Yes. I think so.

 Anton – Good, good. So they know what they are, I know what I am and you know what you are.

So there we have it. More cryptic crap worked out.

 Notice: The Chelsea Pen-Pushers are looking for more members to meet at Fulham Baptist church every Tuesday night. The group claimed responsibility for last night’s witty outburst, and want to try and pen more terrace gold for future matches.

 Shower gel that cleans your insides? 
 
Whilst showering away the surface dirt on my skin the other day, I suddenly realised that my shower gel actually offered a‘deep clean’which put me on edge a bit if I’m honest.

 

Am I being naive here, or is it a fact that all we need, all we will ever need from a shower gel, is to help us remove the dirt that sits ON TOP of our skin?

If soap gets the dirt off the surface of the skin, what does a‘Radox Deep Clean’product do; clean the blood? If so I suggest that we airlift this miracle drug to every biologist and doctor in the land, with explicit instructions to stop dialysis treatment immediately and just pop a few squirts of this gear on infected patients.

Or maybe it can’t quite reach the blood, and it only cleans the inside of your skin? If that is the case, I am at a loss as to how we might be able to advance medical science with its use.

What if though, it goes even deeper than the skin&amp;blood into our very souls? I think that men of god the world over would be very interested in this development should it be true!

The only other reason I can fathom is that the word ‘deep’ is completely superfluous and a load of old marketing bollocks? I’m not sure which of the above to plump for.

 Water suitable for vegetarians 
 
Wow. I can honestly say I have never heard anybody ever ask the question “Excuse me, waiter. Is your water suitable for vegetarians?”

 

What sort of whining, moronic half-wits must we have roaming this planet if Tesco feel compelled to announce that their water is suitable for consumption by people who do not eat meat? It’s water. Has anybody EVER seen any water that contains even the merest trace of meat? No, of course you fucking haven’t! This totally redundant statement is right up there with ‘this packet of peanuts may contain traces of nuts’

The world has gone fucking mental!

 Wall’s place porn in the high street! 
 
What the fuck do Wall’s think they are playing at?

 

This is a picture I took in broad daylight, in central London recently. The company sell ice creams. The message reads “Beejays. Lick It.” and the picture shows a woman, her mouth wide open, about to go down one a hard one.

I know in marketing circles they say that‘sex sells’but this is so thinly veiled that there were people wanking in the street. It’s not right.

 BREAKING NEWS…jury convict the wrong man for Jacko manslaughter! 
 
The jury in the Michael Jackson case spoke for the first time last night about their relief of‘getting their man’as Dr Conrad Murray, known to the world only as ‘Michael Jackson’s doctor’ was sentenced to up to four years behind bars for the involuntary manslaughter of the pop superstar, Michael Jackson.

One juror spoke of the moment when he became convinced that the doctor was guilty.“I was sitting staring at Michael Jackson’s Doctor for three days man, and I was sure he reminded me of somebody. Somebody guilty, but I couldn’t put my finger on who”

Another lady from Arkansas said “It felt like I was sitting in a TV drama or something. I was sure I had seen this man in the dock before.”

As the judge passed sentencing, the jury had a collective ‘eureka moment’ and looked more excited than a fat kid in a cake shop when one of them said “My God. That’s OJ Simpson”

The judge later dismissed the jury, and one juror interviewed outside the court said “fuck him. He got off before for something he definitely did, so I guess this is karma”

 

Top: OJ Simpson sent down for the manslaughter of Michael Jackson.

Bottom. Michael Jackson’s Dr, pricking about in the Bahamas.

 Tomas Kuszczak confused slavery with the lap of luxury 
 
Tomas Kuszczak has likened his job at Manchester United, where he is paid thousands of pounds a week to stop a ball going in a net, with slavery.

 

Despite the fact that the Polish goalkeeper is being paid more a week than many people earn in a year to prick about with a football, a pastime he would have been doing for free had he not been paid so handsomely, the former West Brom keeper feels that he is being treated like a slave.

History will tell us that slaves were forced with violence to work very long hours for free, and could be physically abused if they refused to obey their masters. Kuszczak is paid thousands of pounds to train once a day, and play in a match every now and again.

This is how my interview with the ridiculous cunt would have gone had it taken place:

 Me: Tomas, does Sir Alex whip you?

 Tomas: No, of course not.

 Me: Does he force you to live in squalor, and work 16 hours a day for no more payment that sustenance?

 Tomas: No, I have a lovely big house in a nice area, and I only train for a few hours each day.

 Me: I see. Do Man Utd not pay you for your training?

 Tomas: Yes, I get shit loads of cash! More than the entire population of my hometown in Poland put together in fact.

 Me: So, let me get ths straight. You get thousands of pounds a week for doing a few hours training a day, and you live in the lap of luxury while hard-working people pay a vast proportion of their disposable income to come and allow you to live this life of riley. Why exactly do you feel like you are being treated like a slave, you utter cunt?

 Tomas: Because the manager is playing the more expensive, better goalkeeper in the team, and he won’t let me play!

 Slave complains of being treated like a professional footballer 
 
A slave who wishes to remain anonymous has today spoken of his horror at being treated like a professional footballer.

 

Mr X as he’ll be known in this report said “I am used to being whipped and forced to pick cocoa beans with my bare hands for 14 hours a day, and in return I wouldn’t be kicked to death, and would get a bowl of rice and a glass of filthy water before collapsing exhausted into my bale of hay. It was a life of simple pleasures, but it was mine”

In a Trading Places style switcharoo, Mr X was suddenly picked by a Premiership football club who shall remain nameless, and forced to receive nearly £30,000 a week, to live in a mansion, and to have more rest hours in a day than he used to get in a month in his old job.

“It’s bang out of order treating me like this. I’m not a fucking footballer you know! I have my pride” snarled the understandably angry Mr X.

A source at the Premiership club in question told as that they apparently forced Mr X to endure as much as two hours light exercise EVERY DAY and that’s not all. He may even be expected to play in a game spanning a gruelling 90 minutes once or twice a week, coming into contact with a football maybe as many as ten times in each match.

“I just think it is fucking out of order” complained Mr X. “I used to have a right cushty little number and now this shite?”

Human rights activists are looking into Mr X’s claims, and they feel that his human rights have almost certainly been breached since his move to the Premiership football club.

 Water-logged Burger King versus water-tight McDonalds 
 
Dear Burger King,

Your restaurant on Tottenham Court Road, right near the underground station, is a total shambles. I won’t need to remind you that there is a McDonalds right around the corner, on Oxford Street, and it is less than an angry minute’s walk away.

 

I popped into your afore mentioned restaurant at around 12.15pm to be greeted not by the smiling staff your marketing people would probably envisage being at the door on my arrival, but by a fairly large queue at the tills all standing in what looked suspiciously like a puddle of piss.

Not a good start as I am sure you will agree, but I persevered in the hope that I could fill my rumbling tummy with a Whopper Meal in the near future. This is after all a fast-food restaurant, so I was hopeful.

There were around five staff milling around in the area between the huge metal grills where the food should have been, and the tills, all looking busy without actually doing anything that remotely resembled service.

The crowd of hungry people grew, as did the damp feeling in my shoes, but the number of food items to cross the great divide still stood at zero.

After a few minutes of standing there willing your staff to do something, anything to help, I gave up and left. Nobody in those two minutes had received a single food item, no orders had been taken, and people were just stood in desperation.

Mirror the above experience with what happened to me in McDonalds after my angry minutes’ walk.

No sooner was I through the door that a smartly turned out young lady bid me a good afternoon with as genuine a smile as you could hope to see from somebody who has clocked-in to deal with the general public for eight hours straight.

As I drew nearer to their version of the great divide, eye contact was made with another cheery looking lady who took my order immediately, and as I paid with my debit card (£4.20 if you’re interested) another member of staff gathered my food. By the time I had taken my card out of the machine, my food was in front of me. I then wandered upstairs to sit and eat my Big Mac Meal and I was once again greeted warmly by a charming young lady who was cleaning tables. The same lady bid me a good afternoon as I left.

Now, I must admit I clearly caught McDonalds on a very good day, because this level of brilliance is not always attained, but when held up and examined next to the piss-poor ‘service’ your restaurant didn’t offer, I think you can see what I am driving at?

Rant over.

 Daily Mail in bulimia balls-up 
 
The Daily Mail have scored a double own goal on Bulimia and potatoes today.

 

This beautifully placed Tesco newspaper advert, resplendent with images of a juicy turkey, roast potatoes and a glass of something chilled was placed under an article about bulimia.

I think this sort of placement would be enough to make Diane Keaton sick, although to be  fair further reading reveals that even  ice cream has that same effect on her.

The oversight in the paper product is not the only faux pas with this story however. If you are more digitally inclined and you read about Diane Keaton’s ‘nightmare’ you may have been lucky enough to see the advert that I did, for more potatoes!!!

 

I wouldn’t want to be the newspaper sales rep at The Daily Mail this morning, as I would imagine that the Tesco’s client&amp;their media agency are more than a little bit miffed. This is not the advertisers fault by the way, as they would have placed those adverts in good faith.

 James Murdoch suffering from PTSD? 
 
The News International Executive Chairman has been through the ringer somewhat recently. Wave after wave of fresh phone-hacking allegations has rocked News International so heavily that it resulted in the closure of the News of the World newspaper, famed for talking utter shite on a Sunday.

Yesterday the News International executive went before a Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, and fears were raised when the News International executive couldn’t recall a single incriminating shred of information about the whole sordid affair.

 

“It would seem to be a classic case of PTSD, where the sufferer blocks out harrowing details of a stressful situation such as a car crash” said mental health expert Dr. Porkiepies. “Straight-forward questions can appear to confuse sufferers” continued the doctor.

Colleagues of Mr Murdoch appeared baffled as to why he could suddenly not remember a chuffing thing about how he helped cover-up phone hacking on a biblical scale.

Mind, the mental health charity, was thought to be trying to make Mr Murdoch comfortable last night after his ordeal.

 Fans would swap character for success 
 
A recent FSF survey has shown that football supporters the length and breadth of the country are getting more than a little tired of hearing about their team’s character. In football parlance, the showing of character is something that is usually waved about in front of the nation’s media by a manager that has just taken a bit of a beating by way of taking the spotlight of their inadequacies at actual football.

The most recent exponent of the character mind trick is the Manchester United Manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, who recently told the press “The criticism has been understandable because you lose a derby game 6-1, get knocked out of the Carling Cup by Crystal Palace, a Championship team, and then lose to Basle, which is not a power in Europe. You can understand the criticism…”By this At this point in the interview, the old Jedi mind-trick master has taken their fans as far along the road of truth as he is prepared to stomach. With puppy-dog eyes, the Scot* then stares solemnly at his interviewer and follows up the precise facts of the matter with “but we‘ve come back and I think that shows the character of the team”

One Manchester United fan who was interviewed outside Rick Stein’s famous fish restaurant in Padstow, Cornwall said “I don’t travel a 626 mile round-trip to see fucking character. I want glory innit?”

Sir Alex isn’t the only manager who has tried to put an Elastoplast over a severed limb, metaphorically speaking, as the under fire Blackburn Rovers manager, Steve Kean, recently trotted out the C word twice in one sentence.‘We’ve got character in the side. We’ve been unfortunate in the last couple of games not to have more points, but we’ve got character” It’s unclear as to whether Blackburn fans are buying this or not at this stage.

 

The Football Supporters Federation has received thousands of emails asking why fans should give a flying fuck about character, and how they should drop that into the footie banter that they are being crucified in week in, week out.

 

*Can I still call a Scottish man a Scot?
