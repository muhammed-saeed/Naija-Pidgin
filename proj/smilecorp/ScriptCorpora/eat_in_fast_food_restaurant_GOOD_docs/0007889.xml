 Quirks: Is Their Ignorance Our Bliss? 
 By Melissa Chandler | March 8, 2012 
 You know how sometimes people in your life do something habitually that&apos;s so strange/cute, your first instinct would be to tell them, and express how endearing it is, but then you catch yourself because you realize if you told them, they might become self-conscious and stop doing it, or even if they didn’t stop doing it, the action would forever be tainted by the acknowledgement?

My brother, a decade my senior, never got the memo on excessive lol’ing being passé, and so after each message I get from him, there is sure to be not just a &quot;lol,&quot; but a hearty &quot;LOLOL!&quot; (even if the message wasn&apos;t quite as funny as all that). I like it. It makes me smile, and though I’m not above making fun of my brother to his face, I think I’ll let this one remain sacred.

An ex of mine routinely included “gum” on his grocery lists.

Another used to neatly stack things (any things) that wound up in front of him.
