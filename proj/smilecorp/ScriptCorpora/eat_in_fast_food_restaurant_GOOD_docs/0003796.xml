 Take Out Place Added a Tip When I didn&apos;t leave one

 Last weekend I picked up a pizza from a locally owned place. I used my credit card and signed the receipt without leaving a tip (we can debate this if anyone would like). I was checking my account this morning and noticed that the charge came to$5.00 more than the actual bill. I called my bank and it appears that they added a$5 tip. While it&apos;s only$5, I go to this place a fair amount and I wonder how often they&apos;ve done this.

Do you think it&apos;s common for places to add a few dollars knowing hardly anyone saves receipts or bothers to check the charges at a later date?

No, seeing as this is theft. Also, the use of a credit card means this is interstate commerce and a federal offense.

It is absolutely not common and is actually criminal. I would notify the owner of the store and the police.

I do tip for takeout (not much), but it is always in cash form, even if I pay by credit. On the&quot;tip&quot;section on the credit card receipt, I draw a line. It is pretty easy for someone to add a tip, and if you make it low enough, nobody will really realize it when checking their statements.

If it happened to you, someone is ripping off other customers. Definitely call the police.

Doesn&apos;t matter. A blank tip line is not an invitation for someone to give themselves a tip.

 The owner of a local shop around my parts caught one of his employees doing this exact thing. He was watching live video of his register one day over his smart phone. He noticed the cashier pocketing some money after a customer had left with their purchase. He checked his books and never found any$$$missing. At that time he realized that the employee had been doing exactly what the OP experienced in adding tips of just a few dollars here and there.

I was told (by the above acquaintance) to always cross out the tip line, and ask for a receipt. On top of that, when they hand you the receipt, circle the total. Even if you have no intention of actually saving your receipts and checking them against your statement. It just sends a signal to the cashier that you may not be the best person to target, and move onto someone else.

Try this: on the tip line, right next to the word&quot;tip&quot;write&quot;of my penis&quot;. And then on the&quot;total&quot;line, write&quot;Priceless&quot;. I can&apos;t imagine anything bad could come of this strategy.

I wouldn&apos;t go that far. I worked in more than a few pizza place in HS and college and never expected tips on pick-up orders.

 If you can&apos;t tip a couple bucks for pickup, then eat at home. Cheapness is way out of hand these days.

Just about to post something similar.

Although if you are picking up from what is typically a dine-in place (Chili&apos;s, Macaroni Grill etc) then there is a little more to it than picking up from McDonald&apos;s or a pizza place. I can see tipping 10% or so there.

 It basically comes down to cheapness. Any decent human being knows they should tip at a pickup restaurant...not fast food.

 I&apos;d call and have a chat with the owner of the business before you call the police. I wouldn&apos;t want to get the owner of a small local business I like to frequent in trouble because one of his employees is doing something he likely doesn&apos;t know about. Give him a chance to fix it, he&apos;ll know who was working that night, and you&apos;ll get some goodwill out of the deal (and likely some free pizza.)

Just don&apos;t be a #### when you call him and tell him

Also, tipping on takeout is stupid. I tip very well at a restaurant, and consider it part of the cost of going out. I&apos;m unsure what I&apos;m tipping for with takeout.

Seems like an ambiguous differentiation that has nothing to do with decency.

 I frequent a place for takeout and almost never tip. I always see them check the signed receipt for a tip after I hand it back to them. Uncomfortable. I always just say I tossed a dollar in the tip jar.

Actually, if more people were cheap, this country would be in much better shape economically.

So I&apos;m sure you tip at fast food restaurants in order not to be cheap.

 People love to spend money they don&apos;t have to eat out frequently...that&apos;s why obesity is out of control in this country. It takes too much time to cook a healthy meal I guess.

 The person that works the counter/drive-thru at a fast food place doesn&apos;t do those things? Do they just grab a bunch of food at random and throw them in a bag?

As a matter of fact, the last time I was in a fast food restaurant the cashier was the one who put my burger and fries in the bag. So yes, they do check for accuracy.


If your posts made any frigging sense you&apos;d get more respectful responses from me.
 Thanks,

Haven&apos;t been around all day, but I got a chuckle to see that I&apos;ve been diagnosed as stupid, cheap, not a decent person and surprisingly, trustworthy.

 

I&apos;m not calling the police or the owner because of$5. It only took a 2 minute call to my bank and they are looking into it. If they deny it or argue, I will never go to this place again. I moved a few months ago and it&apos;s no longer as convenient.

As far as tipping for take out, not going to happen. Servers, bus boys and bartenders get tipped out at restaurants. None of those people are involved in preparing a take out order at the pizza place.

You know what drives me nuts? Tip jars at fast food/take out places. They&apos;re not serving me, they&apos;re just completing a sale. There is no value added by the servers or the cashier.

 I hope you cheapskates that don&apos;t tip and frequent the same places often enjoy saliva in your food because I can only imagine how often that happens...although I don&apos;t condone that at all.

Just don&apos;t be a #### when you call him and tell him

Also, tipping on takeout is stupid. I tip very well at a restaurant, and consider it part of the cost of going out. I&apos;m unsure what I&apos;m tipping for with takeout.
 
I&apos;d go one step further and just show up in person, especially given it is a place he frequents.

I understand tipping a server, who waits on you and checks in to see if you need anything. Who exactly are you tipping when you tip takeout? For what service... tipping someone for ringing up your bill?
 There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.

Did you ever expect a corproration to have a conscience, when it has no soul to be damned, and no body to be kicked? 0

The restaurant should tip you for not having to wait/bus your table.

At Burger King, yes.

You should still call the owner - it&apos;s not about the$5.

 I frequent a place for takeout and almost never tip. I always see them check the signed receipt for a tip after I hand it back to them. Uncomfortable. I always just say I tossed a dollar in the tip jar. 
 

If you have to lie about it, then you definitely know that you are doing something wrong...

For the record I tip about half the time for takeout, generally depending on the restaurant.
