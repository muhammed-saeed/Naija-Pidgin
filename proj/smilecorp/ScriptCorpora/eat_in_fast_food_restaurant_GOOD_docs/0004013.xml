 Pick Up Stix joins list of Chinese food delivery in Orange County 

October 1st, 2010, 4:30 pm· ·posted by Stefani Peterson, The Orange County Register 
 
 Editor’s note: I’d like to welcome back Chapman University student Stefani Peterson to the blog. She did a fantastic job this summer, and has found some time to write for me again this fall.   She tells us today about Chinese restaurants that deliver in Orange County, including Pick up Stix.
 

 —————————-
 

 

Though some Pick Up Stix locations have been offering delivery for years, the San Clemente-based chain recently rolled out the delivery option system-wide.

Now, all but four California locations offer delivery. Out of state locations are expected to launch delivery this month.  In Orange County, Pick up Stix restaurants that deliver are in Dana Point, Foothill Ranch, Fullerton (2 locations),  Laguna Niguel,  Irvine, La Habra, Lake Forest, Mission Viejo, Santa Ana, San Juan Capistrano, Seal Beach and Tustin. ( See full list of locations /addresses).

 The lowdown: Delivery is available every day after 5 p.m. and all day on Sundays for almost all California locations. There is a $2.50 delivery charge per order and a $15 minimum order. The chain still delivers all day every day on catering orders more than $150.

 

All delivery orders must be phoned in. Online orders are not available for delivery.

Chinese food delivery is not a new concept to Orange County, but it is for a Chinese fast-food chain. Here are a few other Orange County Chinese restaurants that deliver:

 Green China –595 N. Tustin St., Orange, CA 92867- (714) 633-3136 California Wok –3033 Bristol St., Costa Mesa, CA 92626–(714) 751-0673 China West Express –17292 McFadden Ave., Tustin, CA 92780–(714) 544-2222 Go&amp;Go Asian Cuisine –2300 SE Bristol St. # C, Newport Beach, CA 92660–(949) 852-9700 ($2 charge) Yen Ching Restaurant –574 S.
