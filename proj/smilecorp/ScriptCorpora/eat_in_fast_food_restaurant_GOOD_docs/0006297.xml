Why Your Busboy Hates You

 Carol Blonder Cinder-fella 
 
​In the tradition of Sarah Ventre (Why Your Cocktail Waitress Hates You) , as well as our anonymous Starbucks barista  and pizza delivery guy , the quintessential busboy shares his anecdotes of restaurant service and Why Your Busboy Hates You, as told to this writer.

No we are not revealing his identity, as he respects his employer and the crew he works with, and does not speak as his employer&apos;s representative.

 The real me: I am a college student with an interest in Restaurant and Hospitality Management. I work in the restaurant service industry (have since high school) because I like the fast pace, being on the food scene, and the people. I get it, my job -- barista, bartender, busboy and server -- is all about the service. But there are times when I roll my eyes and shake my head at you, the customer.

Hey, call me &quot;Cinder-fella&quot;.   To you I may just be the bitch&apos;s bitch, just a mule pulling the wagon. My work begins hours before you even think about coming in to get your next meal. I clean the floors where you deposit yesterday&apos;s trash from your purse or pockets, scrub tables and chairs deposited with chewing gum and snotty tissue, and scrape food you didn&apos;t even purchase here off plates.

So yeah, I&apos;ve got my gripes . Here are a few: 

 This is a dining experience, not a track meet: Flagging me over to your table and sending me running is fine. What is annoying is asking for a clean napkin, and as soon as I return with it, you have decided you need mustard. I deliver the mustard, and now you need an extra plate to share your food with your mother. Here comes the extra plate, and now you are ready to order that glass of wine. Why is this annoying?   Maybe the other five tables in my section would like some service, too.

 Enough with the PDA: Glad you like your date but I don&apos;t want to watch your foreplay.   Grabbing her ass is embarrassing to her, to me, to the table next to yours. I get it, your girlfriend is hot, so go home and get freaky later. A nice nibble on the ear then cut the action. And don&apos;t bother giving me the stare down, I&apos;m just here to bring the drinks, I can get my own action, privately.

 And as for your potty behavior.... Yep, the staff cleans the bathrooms. If you shut yourself in the bathroom for 20 minutes, and we can smell the stink, we have a pretty good idea it was you who crapped all over the toilet seat and left. Clean it up, man. Paper towels stuffed in urinals and bloody napkins floating in the toilets? Who does that? Do you trash your house like this? The same goes for your vomit; if you can&apos;t control your alcohol go outside. If you are going to puke in the restroom, try to aim for the toilet and hit the flusher before you exit.

 Tips on tipping and how I really feel about your kids, after the jump. 
 
 
 
 




 




 
 I like little kids, just not yours:  You don&apos;t want to pay attention to your little kids, what makes you think I do? I am not a babysitter, and if I go the extra mile for you and your baby mess, think of what you would be paying to leave baby at home with a sitter and show your appreciation (it&apos;s called a tip). While you were on your cell phone your barefoot toddler ran around the booths, emptying saltshakers on the tables. Thank you for leaving it for me to clean up along with the empty jars of baby food and dirty baby wipes. Oh, and that cereal you brought to keep baby quiet, is now ground into every crevice within 5 feet of the high chair.









 

 No psychics work here: The purpose of a menu is to list the dishes we prepare and the ingredients. Your server and the chef want to get your order right. Read the menu and ask questions if the information isn&apos;t given, but don&apos;t bust my ass and send back your food because you didn&apos;t pay attention when you gave the server your order. Own it and let me know in a civil manner why you are cranky. Then give the kitchen time to work their magic. If you send a dish back to the kitchen, don&apos;t wine to me about the wait. If you want fast food, try the intersection down the road.

 Tip Like a Trump: Think about it. Don&apos;t assume that because you are ordering take out you don&apos;t need to tip. I check your order, package your order, make sure you have eating utensils, napkins and condiments, and cashier the bill. Just because you aren&apos;t being served at a table, doesn&apos;t mean you didn&apos;t get served.

 

 Million-dollar schmuck: The worst tipper I ever encountered was a local sports celebrity. He was with his kid and ordered breakfast, drinks and dessert. He left eighty-five cents on the table, the change from his bill. Seriously, like I don&apos;t know who you are. Way to treat the fans.

 

 Circle of love: The best tipper was a local chef-restaurant owner, well known here and on the national scene. He came in with his girlfriend, sat on our patio and ordered wine. They quietly enjoyed the wine, and left fifty bucks on the table. Guess where I&apos;m going to choose to go out to dinner next time I have a night off?

 

 
 


 
​ FYI: Restaurant servers are paid less than minimum wage. We depend on a well-known system of tipping to earn our bread. We did not invent the system. I know my job is all about customer service; I will be polite and take care of you even if you act like a self-centered jerk. If you have a complaint about the food take it up with the manager. If the service was good don&apos;t stiff the wait staff, the kitchen doesn&apos;t get a share of the tips, you are punishing the wrong people.

While I agree with you about the level of to go service being somewhat on par with a fast food employee, the biggest difference is that a fast food employee makes at least minimum wage while most to go people make as much as a server. It&apos;s a stupid system, but unfortunately not the fault of the employee.

Most people in the service industry would agree that a ten percent tip is good for a to go order, and the extra eight percent be reserved for when you&apos;re actually sitting down.
 
what is the&quot;us&quot;? is it somewhere by the U.S?
 
sadly, we did...
 
you americans, do you realize that if you don&apos;t tip your server, there won&apos;t be ANY servers, and then who&apos;s going to get your &apos;refill&apos; you ignorant prick?
 
this comment makes up for youre other one
 
THANK YOU!!
 
oh my god, you ignorant bastard! you americans (not all, just the ones like you) are HUGE duches and don&apos;t deserve to live. do you even know any history at all? if you did, you would know that with no europe, america wouldn&apos;t exist like it does.
(this is assuming youre american, which you probably are given your attitude.)
to americans not like him, i deeply apologize if i offended you.
 
true, being a star doesn&apos;t make him less human, but not believing in tipping does.
 
you sir, are a jackass. the minimal requirements for the food transaction is nothing. we busboys don&apos;t HAVE to work there. what if takeout didn&apos;t exist? then you would have to get off your fat ass and learn to cook. oh, and it&apos;s people like you who end up eating spit.
 
PLEASE tell us what restaurant you work at ... I&apos;ll be sure to not go there.
 
This ridiculous American system is shameful. What brilliant restaurant/eatery manager came up with the idea&quot;let&apos;s pay below minimum wage and get the customers to pay the staff&apos;s wages&quot;.&quot;Minimum wage&quot;means minimum. If people can be paid below that it obviously isn&apos;t the minimum. Redefining a word and continuing to use it is moronic at best.
All food service staff who deal with the public deserve a lot more than minimum wage and I don&apos;t begrudge paying for service. Tipping should be used as it is in any other country on Earth and be reserved exclusively for staff who perform their duties exceptionally well, had to do extra duties for you or in one way or another went above and beyond their normal job description for you. it works everywhere except America, the one country where overly powerful lobbyists managed to convince your politicians to make exceptions to&quot;minimum wage&quot;for one of the hardest working, most under-appreciated and most abused sections of the workforce.
Don&apos;t even get me started on the supposed Christians who won&apos;t tip on a Sunday because you shouldn&apos;t be working on the Sabbath. They are the lowest of the low.
 
So you didn&apos;t invent the system? Neither did I, but you chose to make a living that way.
Of course the kitchen doesn&apos;t run on tips - the management could never keep cooks that way.
You earn your tip by balancing the whole deal.
The kitchen&apos;s slow? Let me know that my meal might take 40 minutes instead of the usual 20.
They made a mistake? Catch it before I do. I expect you to check my order against what I actually asked you for - don&apos;t bring me the wrong meal and blame it on the kitchen.
Then have the balls to tell me - hey, the kitchen did this wrong, but I caught it - would you like the correct part now or with the rest? Maybe the rest of my table would like their food hot, instead of cold while you wait for that last plate? And telling me that really, you&apos;re sorry, and asking if I&apos;d like a refill on my Cola goes a long way towards my seeing you as the good guy, and not just that jerk who&apos;s expecting a tip after my dinner sucked.
 
Apparently there are very few out there that understand the distinction between ordering take out from a restaurant and putting in an order from a drive-thru fast food restaurant. Pretty much the same work is going in on a take out order, so yes - it is definitely appreciated when people tip their wait staff! As a former bartender who also was responsible for putting together all the finishing and side components of a full meal (salads, dessert prep, garnishing, special requests, etc.) for takeout, trust me - it was time-consuming and a lot to juggle while also running a busy bar! 

No one expects tips for fast food ... but there is a huge difference from the quality of food, variety of meal components served, and involvement of your serving staff when you place a take out order from an actual quality restaurant ... TIP ACCORDINGLY! We just ran around getting everything together for your convenience, certainly not our pleasure. The $2/hr wages confirm that tips would, at the least, be considerate.
 
I don&apos;t think Ecolifornia was trying to offend, but one could imagine that working as a janitor or a garbage man could be...gross/messy. Might not bother you, and that&apos;s great, but you could imagine that maybe some people might notbe able to handle a job like that.
 
In the US tipping is not optional. You only should not tip if the service sucked. 
Bad service can and will ruin an otherwise enjoyable meal. 

But walk in expecting to pay 20% more then the menu prices. Period. If you cannot afford then eat at home or some place cheaper. Or get your take out from fast food joints. 
Because this is how our &apos;system&apos; is designed to work.

All not tipping will do is force a &apos;system&apos; change and bring up the actual ordering costs and remove the power to send a message for bad service from the hands of the customer. 

I enjoy tipping - my servers are usually really great and it feels good to let them know I am grateful for thier efforts
 
Drive through workers make min wage and go to work where tips are not part of &apos;the deal&apos; restaurant servers do not make min wage. It is assumed tips will cover the difference. 

Also the person who carefully bags your order is &apos;neglecting&apos; a regular tipping customer to do it.

The right thing to do for take out is give @ least 10%. 
I think that is fair. I think restaurants should just charge that as a service fee for the servers.
 
I&apos;m Canadian and here servers generally do get paid minimum wage or more. So, in Canada, sorry. I don&apos;t tip for shitty service. If you can&apos;t do your job, you don&apos;t get free money.

However I tip adequately for adequate service, and I tip well for good or outstanding service. 

In the States, though, it&apos;s a different story, of course.
 
And you report all your tips, right? You report and pay full taxes on ALL those tips, right? Not bloody likely. Go ahead and add a chunk of sweet treasure to your hourly calculations because most of us have to hand it to the guv&apos;ment.
 
Good article, and part of the reason I personally think everyone should have to work in the service industry at some point in their lives. So many replies concerned with the fairness of being&quot;forced&quot;to tip. Statements about how service employees are somehow exhibiting a sense of entitlement by expecting to receive a tip. It&apos;s largely missing the point. The point is, tipping is something that should be done as a demonstration of appreciation and consideration for others. 

I&apos;ve always appreciated the maxim that&quot;someone who is nice to you, but rude to your waiter/waitress is not a nice person&quot;. Just because someone is serving you food does not make them your servant. This attitude that the customer is in no way responsible to make the server&apos;s job any easier, or more pleasant is simply asinine. No one, in any line of work, enjoys dealing with customers that think that part of your job is putting up with their rude and obnoxious behavior. So, try not to make a mess, keep control of your kids, and generally don&apos;t make a nuisance of yourself when you&apos;re in public. That&apos;s just common decency.

As to tipping, in North America it is considered common decency to tip when receiving certain services. It can be confusing in terms of when and how much to tip, but regardless of how you feel about the practice, it is part of the norms of living in our society. There certainly is no rule saying you have to tip. Just as there is no rule saying the customer next to you can&apos;t spend the whole night swearing at your children or making lewd comments to your wife. However, the probably won&apos;t, and if they did the restaurant would probably ask them to leave on your behalf. Not because there is a rule or law against them doing so, but because it is poor manners and makes everyone&apos;s life more unpleasant.

So join the rest of us in trying to actually have a pleasant and decent society and just tip your servers.
 
Why do I give a fuck whether or not my busboy hates me? Why do I need to impress you? You work in the service industry, not me. If you don&apos;t want to watch me fingerbang some hottie under the table, don&apos;t look. This isn&apos;t your private home, and you don&apos;t get to make shit rules. 

Finally, and most importantly: it&apos;s not my fucking job to pay you - it&apos;s your bosses job. Not even, it&apos;s your responsibility to accept a job that pays a salary you&apos;re happy with. I&apos;ll tip you if I damn well feel like it. I don&apos;t&quot;owe&quot;you shit. Furthermore, I don&apos;t care that the restaurant is making you pay for tips I don&apos;t leave. That&apos;s retarded, but again, YOUR problem when you took the job. If they&apos;ve got more costs to cover, they can put it in the damn menu - I don&apos;t have any secret responsibility to pay any part of their expenses - staff, silverware, lightbulbs, nah.

tell your friends
 
Do you pay the restaurant for giving you a roof over your head,and the food that was cooked for you? Yes. So why do you feel that it is so unnecessary to pay the server that delivers your food, and does their best to accommodate your every need? You want to stop tipping? Well that means your 25 dollar steak just became 30 dollars to cover paying the waitstaff, whether the service was unsatisfactory or commendable.
 
wow. you&apos;re kind of an idiot.

if someone came into your house and made a huge mess of your bathroom, how would you like to clean it up. thats disgusting, don&apos;t be such a pig.
if you can&apos;t control your kids, don&apos;t expect everyone to love them. it&apos;s common courtesy to keep your children from disturbing everyone else&apos;s dining experience. i for one hate parents who let their little morons run around the restaurant and disturb everyone. if my kid&apos;s did that, which i would never allow, i&apos;d be downright embarrassed about my obvious lack of parenting skills and/or intelligence, as well as blatent disregard for anyone but yourself.
if you don&apos;t ask for what you want the first time your busboy/server is there,don&apos;t blame them because they didn&apos;t read your mind.
 
my deepest sympathies to your wife, who must have one hell of a time putting up with you. try being a decent person with a little class.
 
sorry don&apos;t pay for take out_ I pay for my own time and gas
 
8779900, I appreciate all your points but they don&apos;t address most of the issues I raised, especially the part about why tips are based on the value of the meal which bears absolutely no relation to the level of service provided.

There is nothing wrong with working as a waitress and supporting your family and I do not look down on people in the service industry, it is this idiotic custom of tipping that I object to for all the reasons above.

As for your employer paying minimum wage. Yes, he would have to raise his prices but every other restaurant would have to do the same thing so it all evens out.
 
Amen
 
6.&quot;Tipping is a tax dodge.&quot;I am a waitress so I can explain this. My employer pays less than minimum wage, so TIPS ARE REPORTED. You can report either the ACTUAL amount of tips you earn, [must be documented], or 8% of sales, {also documented.] If you tip me 15-20%, you are making up for the ones who tip 5-10% ,[ or don&apos;t tip me at all.] If I don&apos;t make 8% tips on my daily sales, I pay taxes on money that I have not received. If I make more than 8%, I don&apos;t pay taxes on money that I have received- but it evens out in the end ,[for me], to about 10% of my overall sales. So, 2% off my tip money escapes the tax man. 
 Your may have misunderstood the waiter who told you that 10% of his tips are reported. The IRS is strict about the minimum 8% of sales. If 90% of his tips are not reported, than that waiter, or waitress, is making 80% tip average. This just does not happen. Ever. 
 Mr. Do Your Job, respectfully I tell you these things because I want you to understand. I work at a City golf course cafe, I raised up two fine sons doing this work,[one a butcher the other a Navy corpsman] and no, it is not easy work.[ it is part of my job to make it LOOK easy.] 
 My employer does not pay minimum wage, and without raising prices he cannot afford to do that. Tipping watstaff is an old bargain, and it works for YOU and ME- here is why.
 When you come into my cafe&apos;, I want you to be happy- with your service AND your food. I take your order, cook your food, serve the food AND clean up. I do this happily, and yes I do it well because I want a good tip. My employer pays part of my wage and YOU pay me DIRECTLY part of my wage. That makes you my boss too. If I do not serve you good food promptly and in a friendly manner, make you feel as if I appreciate your patronage, I did NOT earn my tip! Do not tip me! 
 If the girl has a tip jar at the register, people who just want a candy bar or a fountain drink are not expected to tip, [But thank you ,those who do!} The tip jar is for when I make you a nice sandwich, or burger, or made to order breakfast. And I will strive to make it a GREAT meal, you will be happy OR DON&quot;T TIP ME!
 Waitstaff has to be nice to everyone ALL day, no matter what. This is the first rule. These articles from waitresses and busboys are just a little blowing off steam for us because we have to be nice to people who treat us rotten. Most customers are LOVED, not hated. 
 When you eat out, you should be waited on and treated well. And you should be prepared to tip for that part. Or you could pay more money for your meal, and I will have no incentive to do more than&quot;my job&quot;. Which do you think gives you a better experience? 
 Panhandlers do nothing for their money , I don&apos;t expect you to pay me for nothing
 Hard working Mom, [and Grandma!} PS I love what I do and I love our costumers, but some people JUST DON&apos;T GET IT!
 
i don&apos;t work in a restaurant i work in a games store but jesus im sorry you totally do not deserve tips for take-away. if thats the case when you come to my shop you should tip me because you pick the item but i get it ready and put it through the till and make sure you get your receipt and bag it up for you...i mean come on man...be reasonable!
 
Yes, god or whatever forbid I believe the wait staff is there to serve me.

You&apos;re an idiot. That&apos;s what the entire job is THERE FOR. If the wait staff wasn&apos;t there TO SERVE ME, we would all line up at a counter like, place our orders, go sit somewhere, wait for our number to be called, bring our own food back to our own tables on a tray, and refill our own drinks/napkins/silverware/whatever.

You know. Like McDonald&apos;s.

If there is a wait staff at a restaurant, it is there for the EXPLICIT purpose of serving the customer. And you think it&apos;s a bad thing that we think the wait staff is there to serve us?
 
And?

That&apos;s the point Nospammy was making. The kid putting something in a styrofoam container and paper bag isn&apos;t doing any more work than a McDonald&apos;s drive-through employee. If you don&apos;t tip in drive-through, why should you tip in take-out? And don&apos;t bring up the below-minimum-wage crap--if you don&apos;t like that, there are other jobs out there. I&apos;d rather clean toilets for minimum wage than write whiny articles about why I deserve things people won&apos;t give me because I work in food and get paid less than minimum wage.
 
Uh, as far as I am aware, they usually do. Anyone I know who has worked in the restaurant industry had to give a percentage of their tips to the hostess, the people cooking the food (be they head cook or potato chopper), and the bussing staff.
Maybe it is different in very high-end restaurants where the kitchen staff are paid well, but most average restaurants you have to. And yes, they get paid REAL wages, not the extremely reduced wage of wait staff.
 
I agree with everything in this article. I too have been in the food business for a very long time. The one question I have is WHY? are restaurants,cafe&apos;s or diners allowed to get away with not paying their staff? Every other industry has to pay it&apos;s employs. IE: department stores, liquor stores, bakeries...well you get the idea. 
I believe you (waiters, buss boys hostesses etc.), should be paid what you are worth by their employer. Everyone behind the running of a food establishment works hard, but to have to rely on tips for the majority of their pay is not fair. 
I can&apos;t believe that Wolf Gang Puck, Bobby Flay or Alice Waters is on the verge of bankruptcy! We should include tips in the price of the meal or an added percentage added to the bill (very European of us). This way no one would have to worry about their tips.
I think that their are enough people behind the scenes of a restaurant to make their point. The only problem is that everyone is afraid of losing their JOB!
 
You must remember, TIPPING IS OPTIONAL, IT&apos;S FOR GOOD OR GREAT SERVICE!! As a Customer, I don&apos;t automatically expect great service - so when I get it, the tip I leave is a reflection of that!! I DO, HOWEVER, expect ADEQUATE SERVICE - and for this, you are BEING PAID by your EMPLOYER. If you are going to go &apos;above and beyond&apos;, you&apos;re going to get a nice tip for it. If you just &apos;go through the motions&apos; I might just leave you the change from the few dollars you brought back after I pay my bill. And don&apos;t call me &apos;cheap&apos; for not being an automatic tipper - TIPS ARE FOR GOOD OR GREAT SERVICE - not just because I choose to sit down in your establishment and eat a meal. Take it up with your EMPLOYER if you have a problem with this. Also, I am going to REQUEST to be seated AWAY FROM SMALL CHILDREN if I&apos;m coming in to eat at your restaurant as a PAYING CUSTOMER. The INSTANT you seat one of them next to me - after I&apos;ve told you NOT TO - is when you LOSE any hope you had of a good tip from me. That means if you&apos;ve got an ignorant seating staff, you might pay for it at the end of the night. If I&apos;m going out in public and paying for the experience, the LEAST you can do is to provide a GOOD ONE FOR ME.
 
No they aren&apos;t... unless you&apos;re from a particularly backwards part of Europe. You would only tip in the UK if service was actually good.
 
For the last time it&apos;s YOU&apos;RE for YOU ARE. NOT YOUR. I hope you&apos;re a former bartender because you&apos;re going back to school because that&apos;s certainly where you need to go. You&apos;ve gotten it wrong in every single post you&apos;ve made.
 
No - why should the customer make up the shortfall in the server&apos;s poor wages? This is a uniquely American problem and it&apos;s time you dealt with it. Pay servers a fair wage and we can stop having this debate.
 
&quot;It&apos;s your job to clean the restroom, not mine. And I&apos;m not going to clean it even if I had a shit explosion on the toilet. Deal with it.

My kids are way more precious to me than you are. If I&apos;m paying for food and service then you&apos;ll be nice and friendly to my kids even if they make a mess. If you are friendly then I&apos;ll tip you accordingly. If you give me attitude I&apos;ll call the manager over and explain why I&apos;m unhappy.&quot;Are you an asshole all the time? No one, NO ONE, should have to put up with your kids being shits. If your kids can&apos;t behave or you can&apos;t control them then don&apos;t go out. It&apos;s no one else&apos;s responsibility to look after them. And if you can&apos;t control your bowels CLEAN IT UP. You wouldn&apos;t shit everywhere in someone else&apos;s house so why would you do it in a restaurant? People like you are the pits of the earth.

And I&apos;ve never worked in the service industry, but I can still spot a dickhead a mile (or 3000) away.
 
Or just come and live in Europe if you think tipping is an odious, outdated practice and the wages you make should simply be high enough to live off. Come to Europe where the minimum wage applies to servers so we don&apos;t NEED to tip to give them a suitable income. The minimum wage in the UK is £5.83 / hour. That&apos;s about $8 / $9. If you yanks got your asses in gear and joined the 21st century we wouldn&apos;t keep having these pointless debates about tipping.
 
If you don&apos;t like tipping, cook at home, douchebag
 
About the FYI:
Having bussed quite a few years now I can agree with everything said except the last bit. The state I live in has a minimum wage, if you don&apos;t meet it through&quot;tips&quot;your employer must pay you the remainder based on a 2 week average. I had it occur, told my manager, and we were square. Dependent on your state laws, not getting tipped isn&apos;t so bad. For you.
 
Actually the act of tipping started out as TO INSURE PROPER SERVICE with the customer meeting the staff on an equal basis not as servants hired to provide your every whim
 
I think they&apos;re talking more about the people who do take out in actual restaurants, like the service that Ruy Tuesday, Applbee&apos;s and others offer. The people taking care of the take out orders almost always get stiffed, even with orders well over $100.
 
The kitchen staff get paid actual wages, while wait staff get about 2.13 an hour. And believe me, waiting tables is real work. Try having 10 tables to attend to at once.
 
I tip flat rate minimum wage. I don&apos;t care how much I spent, I will tip at a rate of minimum wage x hours I was there. If service was particularly good, an extra $10. Sometimes this means a 50% tip, sometimes it&apos;s a 5% tip. I don&apos;t see why I should tip more just because I ordered a steak rather than the spagetti.
 
If you haven&apos;t worked in food service you won&apos;t get it, its often a thankless and underpaid job, and the entire industry is that way unless you&apos;re at the top. Remember, before you bitch about tipping, that your server is probably getting paid less an hour than you would pay the kid next door to mow your lawn. It&apos;s because the industry expects their servers to be tipped that they are paid so little. Granted, great servers make great tips and make up for it, but everyone has slow or off days.
 
Get a real job and quit whining. Retards like you are why I don&apos;t tip -- entitled idiots.
 
Wine is a drink, whine is a noise a person makes when they are cranky.
 
A lot of restaurants require the waitstaff/bartender to tip out a percentage of their food sales to a food runner/busser so if you DON&apos;T leave a tip, they are in turn paying out of their pocket for you to have gotten a take out order.
 
TIP, an acronym for&quot;to insure promptness&quot;. 
As a server, I look at each patron that I&quot;take care of&quot;as a potential tipper. Every single one is treated with courtesy, a real smile, not the fake one that doesn&apos;t reach your eyes.
Kids, no problem...extra running, no problem...extra work, no problem...that&apos;s why it&apos;s called work and not going on vacation. 
Do I get tipped every time? NO. Do I hope for a tip every time? YES. Do I treat EVERY customer the same? YES. Even the ones that are regulars that NEVER tip get the same service as the regulars that ALWAYS tip. 
Even the ones that don&apos;t tip make it possible for you to have a job.
Cultivate a professional attitude and you will be paid accordingly, cultivate an attitude of entitlement and your customers will see you for what you are...driven by money and not genuine desire to give good service and a desire for you to return.
 
Well stated. I am a waitress (with a college education), and I think people everywhere should learn a little more manners while dining out. 

 I don&apos;t expect tips from take out orders though, except the ones that come every day and order 11 plates. I check each one myself and make sure everything you need and want are there. While doing so, I may be giving up one or more tables, depending on how well the kitchen staff is doing. 

I think you should tip based on service. If you receive good service, tip your waiter/waitress accordingly. If you don&apos;t, then don&apos;t tip them accordingly.
 
however, they make way more than wait staff usually.
 
Why do I need to consider all of that when determining if I should tip you for service above the bare minimum? I go to eat to have a pleasurable experience, not to have some kind of guilt trip laid on me. 

And as I wrote below if tipping is for the service why in the world is it pegged to the value of the food?

Wouldn&apos;t it make more sense to have a system where I tip $x per person for good service and not $10-50 depending on how expensive my meal is.

I mean does it really makes sense that a table of 5 can run up a $150 bill and tip $15-30 and yet a table of 2 can run up a $150 bill and be expected to tip the same for less work for that table?
 
I myself think of my tips as a rating system of how happy you were with the dining experience I provided you with. Tipping is optional, you&apos;re right. The problem is that most companies/restaurants have taken advantage of a big loophole and pay us less than minimum wage because they expect us to get tipped and they want to have to pay out as little as possible. So they take the minimum wage and subtract what you&apos;re average tips should be and that&apos;s what you&apos;re left with, basically we get screwed cause everyone else is wanting to be money grubbers. That&apos;s not our fault, it&apos;s the states that say it&apos;s legal to do, not all states allow lowering wages because of tips to happen.

The other piece that most people don&apos;t realize is that we servers often have to tip out the other co-workers that help us make your dining experience perfect: the bussers, bartenders, and expediter are the typical three. And the percentage we tip out to them from our tips is usually preset by the restaurant and is based off of our sales meaning if you&apos;re dinner was $100, you&apos;re server receives $10 as a tip and that server has to tip out lets say just 2% to each of those then that server only actually takes home $4 of that tip.

So please just keep these things in mind when you give us our optional tip.
 
Actually...in a lot of restaurants the kitchen does get a cut of the tips.
So do the bartender, the hostesses, and the bus staff.

And your waiter still has to tip out at the end of the night whether they got stiffed or not.
 
1. Tipping no longer bears any relation to service. What started as a way to reward great service has now become a culturally enforced “forced” payment where you are still expected to leave a tip regardless of the service you received. This means the incentive behind the tip is gone so the server really has no motivation to provide great service because he knows 95% of the customers will still leave 10% or more regardless.

Friends who have worked in the service industry argue it a hard job and they rely on tips to survive. This is crap. The guy digging a ditch for minimum wage as a general labourer has a hard job and no on tips him. Also if you can’t make enough money doing what you do, find another job like the rest of us have to do.

2. You must tip according to the value of your meal. This makes no sense at all. A tip is supposed to be based on the service you receive and yet somehow it has arbitrarily become based on the value of your food which has no relation at all to your service. If 2 people have a $200 meal and leave $10 they are considered cheap. If 2 people have a $50 meal at the same restaurant and leave $10 they are considered generous. Why should this be the case? If we assume all things were equal and those 2 people had the same number of plates delivered to them but simply ordered the least expensive items then the wait staff didn’t provide any more service yet they expect more of a tip.

This also causes more inequality because the hard working waiter at an inexpensive restaurant will always receive less money than the slacker, lazy waiter at a high end restaurant regardless of how great his service is. 

3. Tips are sometimes forced on you. If you bring 6-8 or more people to a restaurant depending on where you eat the restaurant will often tack on an “automatic” gratuity of 15-18% which is an oxymoron. Leaving aside for a moment that such gratuities are legally unenforceable, this will be added on regardless of the service you actually received. Strangely, in any other business of I bring you more business I usually get a discount for bulk buying. Yet somehow if I bring a restaurant more business I get an automatic INCREASE in my bill. 

What’s the rationale for this? Because there are more people your wait staff has to work more? Is that somehow my problem if I have more than 3 friends I want to have dinner with? It’s not as if we’re taking up space and not eating.

4. Tipping allows employers to get away with paying unconscionable wages. Did you know states allow employers to pay service staff less than the minimum wage because of the assumption that those staff will make up the wages in tips? Because of this not only is there a cultural pressure to leave a tip but now there is a moral pressure to make up for the fact that these employers are not even paying the staff minimum wage because they expect you to subsidize the wages of their employees.

People argue if wages went up so would the price of food? So what? You&apos;re still paying the same amount, the waiter has a better guaranteed salary and all restuarants prices would increase so everybody is still even.

5. When tipping is actually related to service it feels I am demeaning the waiter by basing how much to give him depending on how nice he is to me. First of all he should be doing his job well no matter what. But secondly this idea of basically holding out your hand for a favour strikes me as being a little like sanctioned panhandling. “I have been very nice to you, please, grease my palm.” 

6. Tips are a tax dodge. People are supposed to report all tips as income. From the waiters I have spoken to only about 10% of tips are reported. This means that those people are not paying taxes on a good portion of their income. This isn’t fair to the rest of us who pay tax after tax on the money we earn including those people who earn minimum wage and pay tax on all of it.

7. People who should be tipped aren’t and people who shouldn’t be tipped are. I am not expected to tip the lady making minimum wage who works all night to clean the toilets at my office after my filthy co-workers spend all day making a mess of it. Yet the person who gives me my change at the cash register has a tip jar out so I can reward her for being able to count out money what the fuck is that?

Tipping is a big fucking gong show and yet I still do it just to avoid becoming a social pariah.
 
Hey stupid, I don&apos;t know what kind of take out you order but usually I just get my food and leave. I don&apos;t generally open the boxes at the restaurant lobby and start eating and asking for glasses of water.
 
Well Said! I completely agree. Especially the whole&quot;box your own food&quot;thing. When did it become,&quot;do it yourself, but still tip me like a trump&quot;?
 
Wow I have no right to be in a restaurant giving it business because I don&apos;t believe in some stupid custom that has gone completely off the rails? Ok. Stupid.
 
Hey stupid the majority here is not defending the right to crap all over the bathroom or to be rude. Most comments are about getting crap or basic service and still being expected to tip. As for your&quot;option&quot;of not tipping while that is what it should be, but for some reason restaurant workers in N.A. seem to think that a tip is expected regardless of the level of service. Seriously I have to tip you for take out? Really? Because you gave me the food I ordered without fucking it up?

I also agree with others. Rather you include the total price instead of playing this begging game with me. Then I can compare prices and go where I want to go.
 
Well. If you ARE ENTITLED to me giving you a tip. Then include it, explicitly and clearly, on the menu. Don&apos;t tell me it&apos;s&quot;optional&quot;and then frown when I either opt not to participate, or participate proudly but you find my participation meaningless. That&apos;s my problem. I don&apos;t mind paying for things unless you make it clear. And let me clarify that when a server DOES make my day, I&apos;m usually so happy I even overtip way (over-board).

If tipping is optional and up to my satisfaction, then why should *you* really dictate how I tip? Telling me it&apos;s for you to make a leaving is not a valid reason. I shouldn&apos;t have to tip exceptionally for mediocre or okay work. 
To get paid extra at my job, I work extra. 
If you are entitled to my tip as a result of me coming to your restaurant, then please include it in the price and I would gladly pay for it. 
Don&apos;t tell me its optional and then complain. That just doesn&apos;t make any sense. Sorry.
 
I&apos;m a garbage and I take offense at your comment. I work for the city, get paid well and come home with benefits. Some of my friends work in the mines, and those are well paying jobs. Thanks for insulting my life on your high horse . Ecolifornia, that name says it all.. joke.
 
You&apos;re stupid. You dont get a tip for takeout. Thats your job... McDeal with it.
 
As a server, bus boy, barback and fellow employee in the service industry for many years, I could not agree with this more.
 
Clearly you can&apos;t read. The comment was about take out service not sit down service. Some day those letters will make sense... keep trying!
 
The tip for take out should reflect on the overall quality of service (food included!!!), do you even take the time to look inside the box before you leave with your food? There&apos;s more than one person doing things for you, even if you phone in take out, the overall quality of your experience should reflect on your tip.
Also, if your kids are horrible, you are horrible. Children are merely a reflection of the environment they are raised in.
 
The drive through lady does not bring you fresh glasses of water, nor does she expedite bills to make sure food is properly timed, nor does she attend to requests during the eating of the meal, nor does she provide you with entertainment information, directions, or even really have to be anything above cordial.
So yeah, I&apos;d say sit down service just goes a TEENY step beyond what you get at the local McDonalds.
 
More often than not, the busser or server does go wayyyy out of their way to help those more&quot;deserving&quot;of their time than other patrons. This affects tip out on a grand scale, while you&apos;re attending to the needs of one desirous group, another goes without quality service.
And yes, I even tip the shoe salesmen if he does a great job, it&apos;s called professional courtesy.
Jackass.
 
what excuse? there&apos;s no excuse, that&apos;s the reality of the way the restaurant business works in North America. Geezus, what&apos;s the difference if you pay the server or the restaurant? someone has to pay for the service and you&apos;re going to do it directly or indirectly. At least this way you have a direct recourse to poor service.Time to grow up and stop being a whiny self-righeous douchebag
 
I know this is not the case in some restaurants, but in every establishment I&apos;ve worked in as a line cook, prep cook, and sous chef the kitchen has been part of the tip pool. In fact, your issue can go one of two ways, the way you described with poor food quality reflecting on the server, and with poor serving quality reflecting on the kitchen staff&apos;s tip out.
Remember, you&apos;re often the only ones that interact with customers, try to put on a quality show for the whole team, even the ones who can&apos;t be seen.
 
A lot of my friends are servers (and would punch you in the eye for calling the &apos;Bus Boys&apos;. I understand both sides of this even never having worked food service. I batch my requests and normally give my card before my bill, saving the server at least two more trips. I tip about 20%. That being said, I have some entries for Why Your Diner&apos;s Hate You.

1- When I walk in, give me a reasonable expectation of how long the wait is (if there is one), and what seating choices are available. I&apos;m not in fucking prison, I am paying, and the seat is damn-well part of that.

2- If you aren&apos;t going to get to my table for the meal order, take my damn drink order way up front. Don&apos;t send the $1/hr person to refill my damn water 40 times-and then act perplexed when I try to get a drink order in. 

3- If I say I am in a hurry, give me a reasonable expectation of time, and if it works, get my order taken and to me quickly. This free&apos;s up your table in short order and you&apos;re going to get the same tip as if I stayed there for two hours.

4- Keep Europe in mind- they don&apos;t know what the hell you are trying to pull when you tip, as well as Miami who already adds the gratuity in to the bill. I will echo the above at this point and say if you don&apos;t like working harder for tips, get a different job.

5- IF my food isn&apos;t cooked right (even safely), I am going to send it back. I don&apos;t roll out of the tire shop with the wrong-sized tire on one wheel, and this shit isn&apos;t going to be any different.

6- I will ALWAYS be polite to you. I know the job is not easy, and for many it&apos;s all you have going. That being said, don&apos;t take advantage of it by stuffing crappy service in my face because I seem like I will&quot;take it&quot;compared to table 14 that wants you spread out over the country side.

7- Box my damn food up for me. At what point did this become self-serve? Really? Take my plate and shovel my shit in a box for me. I didn&apos;t cook my meal either, I&apos;m not wearing an apron, and I don&apos;t get a portion of your tips (although you&apos;re going to be missing a chunk for this). Because have to box-your-own is now more common than not, if you do it for me, I will certainly tip better, and I will remember the experience and come back.

8- I will tell you if something is wrong. A study said that it is critical to feel empowered to give a restaurant negative feedback. IF I don&apos;t I won&apos;t come again, you won&apos;t fix the problem, others won&apos;t come again, and you&apos;ll be looking for work or switching your cuisine under a new name.

9- My kids are well-behaved and have been taught that your job is hard and they should treat you with respect. Don&apos;t be a dick and soil my lesson.

10- Serve like you would want to be served.
 
Well. You know what? I&apos;d rather the restaurant charged me directly -- and I&apos;ll decided whether to eat there again or not. That excuse is not valid.
 
when I take my sometimes bratty kid to a restaurant, I will generally leave a better tip than if was just me and my wife because we know you just had to deal with him like I did, even if its just cleaning up crushed cheerios.

There have been plenty of times when I wished I could tip the kitchen instead of the wait staff, if the food was awesome but the waiter a jerk I would much rather my tip go to the people who helped me enjoy my meal.

Tipping for carry out? sometimes yes, but a lot of times they don&apos;t do their job and your long gone before you realize it, so you might not know how bad the service was until you get where you are going. thats why I don&apos;t tip for carry out.

The rest is common sense, if you have an explosive a*s then you have no business using a public toilet, leave it for the civilized people.
 
I think the tip like Trump idea is all based on your interpretation of how a server is doing. Each person has their interpretation of how they want to be served. There may be things out of his/her control that may delay you being served the way you want to be served. 

Things like, being double or triple sat, getting a big top, or having the place short-staffed is not the servers fault. Additionally food quality or speed of cooking is not at the control of the server. And normally the cooks are yelling at servers to get the food of the hot plate.

Granted if the server fails in his job (incorrect ringing of the order, wrong drink multiple times, seen farting around) I will scale my tip accordingly. But if there is an effort being put out, tip.
 
Actually, tips ARE expected in Europe as well...
We, somehow, took this ridiculous concept from you guys. :(
 
Wow, so I should tip the guy for doing what his job requires him to do? Amazing concept former bartender. Talk about a douche.
 
If someone doesn&apos;t&quot;believe in tipping&quot;they have no business being in a restaurant wasting someone&apos;s time.
 
Hey former bartender, you strike me as really stupid because this comment contradicts the other comment you made where you claimed tips are expected. Dummy.
 
That&apos;s the problem moron. Tips are expected. That&apos;s not how they are supposed to work. But now every lazy waiter expects to be tipped even if they do a crap job. Just because YOU think its&apos;s established doesn&apos;t mean I do.
 
wow. what a bunch of douches. so in summary, most of you seem to be saying that a) it&apos;s ok to go crap all over a public toilet then walk out leaving for the next patron to walk in on b) your kids can disrupt other people&apos;s meals to their hearts&apos; content c) wait staff is there to serve you and you have no obligation to be polite or civil to them. Nice, I bet your all are fun at parties...and as far as tipping goes, here&apos;s another way to look at it: the restaurant could pay their employees a living wage directly, in which case your $15 steak would cost $20 or things can keep the way they are and you at least have the option of stiffing a particularly bad server. Instead of thinking that servers have to&quot;earn&quot;their tips by kowtowing to your every whim, why not assume that normal, decent service gets a full 15-20% and that can go down with poor service?jeebus, how about treating people the way you would like to be treated?
 
The service industry as gone to the dogs. People expect tips now for anything regardless of how well they perform. I tip according to how well they please me and tipping for a&quot;carry out&quot;will NEVER happen!

www.web-anonymity.tk
 
Tip like a Trump. Bwahahaha. I&apos;ll tip like a Trump when you work like a superstar. You expect me to tip for you doing the minimum required of your job? Really? This might explain why you are a busboy, your standards are low and your sense of entitlement out of whack with reality and goes a long way to explaining why you are still a busboy.

Do you know what happens when I do the minimum required of me at my job? I get paid what I signed on to get paid, that is it.

Your employer doesn&apos;t pay you enough? Tough. I am a customer, I am here to subsidize your paycheck with tips that you pocket without having to pay taxes on. All you servers don&apos;t even lie about it. You are all pocketing lot&apos;s of tax free money so stop your whining. A tip is for service that goes above and beyond. The fact that it is expected regardless of what you do demonstrates that the whole tipping issue has gotten out of hand.
 
The best thing is, all of these people in the comments are saying,&quot;If you don&apos;t like it, quit..&quot;If that was a viable option, there would never be any garbage men, or janitors, or coal miners, or yaddayaddayadda. I don&apos;t see anything particularly wrong with the article. He&apos;s just asking for common decency. If you want to destroy bathrooms with your crap explosions and let your kid wreak havoc, stay at home and hire a maid. Only point I disagree with is regarding take out. That&apos;s your job, checking to make sure it&apos;s right.
 
Haha keep the untensils and don&apos;t check my food. Here&apos;s my tip if I wanted to be served I would eat in. And btw don&apos;t become a server anywhere outside the us
 
whatever.... Wow, talk about entitlement! I bet you&apos;re one of those guys that thinks it&apos;s better to be feared than liked. And I bet people in your life just think you&apos;re a jerk. I feel for your wife. She&apos;s probably so busy trying to keep your hand out of her crotch she can&apos;t watch your bratty, rude children.
 
Hey Chem, I hope Karma pays you a visit. Your deluded. Tips are expected in that environment, and they always will be. It&apos;s a preconceived establishment that is dominant in our country. It&apos;s not changing, it is what it is. Move to Europe if you don&apos;t like you schmuck!
 
Hey Jaiotu, 

If your not getting refills the server isn&apos;t expecting a good tip. He or she will obviously know your doing a bad job. Where are you eating Applebees or something?
 
Wow whatever, your an obnoxious ahole. I hope karma kicks you in the face and some teeth break.
 
Don&apos;t forget his inspecting the quality of your food as well. Timing the input to coincide with your pick up time so you schmucks like you get hot food. It&apos;s no joke. Go live in europe if you want to be a douche.
 
If your tips add up to less than minimum wage, the management is required by law to pay the difference. You will make at least minimum wage regardless of tips. It is not up to the customer to ensure compliance with labor laws.
 
I don&apos;t get tips for doing my job correctly. Why should you? Don&apos;t give me that&quot;I don&apos;t get paid well&quot;shit either, I worked in a restaurant for 3 years and if you don&apos;t like it quit. Expecting tips is just like being a beggar.
 
Great writing!
 
Never tip for takeout. I don&apos;t tip at McDonald&apos;s, why would I tip you for giving me my food to take home? 

Tips are earned.
 
Wow ... I&apos;m not in the restaurant industry and never have been, but this sort of rude, entitled, unpleasant, obnoxious, downright boorish behavior is intolerable anywhere. If you make a mess, you clean it up. Period. Why do you think you are entitled to leave it for someone else to deal with? You do realize someone else may need the bathroom before the staff has a chance to clean it, right? And it may be an emergency? And perhaps you should teach your bratty children some manners before you take them out in public. Those precious monsters you happen to be rearing are growing up to be the next generation of entitled brats who are going to expect to be bailed out every time they wreak havoc on an unexpecting world, a-la Lindsay Lohan/Britney Spears. As for you and your wife, not everyone wants to see it. Truly, they don&apos;t.

Learn some manners. Then go out in public. Skip the tip, I don&apos;t care, but learn about being considerate of your fellow man when you go amongst them.
 
What someone needs to write is the article&quot;Why Your Customer Hates You.&quot;Great to hear all of these&quot;service industry&quot;types yapping and moaning about how horrible the customer is. As though the server/waitress/barista/busboy is the only one who ever gets put upon.You want a good tip? How about bringing me that refill on my drink that I&apos;ve asked for twice? And don&apos;t tell me 20 minutes after I placed my order that your out of the item I selected. If there is something wrong with my meal, or it comes out prepared differently then I requested, don&apos;t push off blame to the kitchen. I&apos;m not tipping you because you need the money, I&apos;m tipping you on the basis of my overall dining experience. If the kitchen staff keeps messing up and your tips take a hit, it&apos;s up to you, the server, to let management know that there is a problem. You&apos;re the advocate between the customer and the rest of the establishment, so don&apos;t blame the customer if he or she doesn&apos;t leave an 18% tip when the meal had to go back to the kitchen because it was over or undercooked. I&apos;m paying good money for my meal and, good service or not, if the dining experience was sub-par, don&apos;t expect me to be a big tipper. I&apos;ll say it again; the customer has no direct interaction with the kitchen staff but the server does. Part of why I leave a tip is because the server is supposed to make sure that what I order is what I actually get.
 
... Again...&quot;Or get another job...&quot;What you&apos;re paid is not my problem, unless you really make my day(s), and I like you. But don&apos;t confuse&quot;possibility&quot;and&quot;entitlement&quot;.
 
It&apos;s clear based on the comments, who has actually worked a customer service job. FYI: In my experience, take-out orders are always a pain in the ass, as they disrupt the workflow. Besides, unlike this article states, there are many restaurants where the kitchen staff is part of the tip pool. In that case, don&apos;t the cooks deserve a tip for making your food?

Also, waiters/bussers are service workers, not indentured servants as Whatever seems to think. Why would someone want to treat another person poorly?
 
Maybe he had just gotten back from a foreign country and was absent-minded. Maybe he did think he was leaving you enough&quot;extra&quot;for what he had ordered. He *was* unhappy with your service. Maybe he doesn&apos;t believe in tipping. Did you ever consider that? 
That he is a star doesn&apos;t make him any less or more than human...
 
You&apos;re silly!
 
Perhaps it is time for you to consider a different career choice... I pay for the food I order, and how much I&apos;m enjoying myself at the restaurant. How much I tip is up to what *I* consider to be a satisfactory amount of extra/unexpected pocket money for anyone (even myself). 
I really do not understand this notion of tipping. Why should I be in charge of your salary and not your employer?
Other countries don&apos;t have that and are even surprised if you tip. 
Frankly, If I&apos;m going to leave a tip I&apos;m proud of, but that you&apos;re going to stare back at with disappointment, I&apos;d rather you include *every* expectation in the menu.
If there is anything that should be&quot;optional&quot;on the menu, then don&apos;t look at me with those eyes when I opt not to accommodate.

If you do decide to join the food/service industry, then that&apos;s really up to you. Isn&apos;t it? Why should it be my bargain? 

Perhaps if you stop going to work *and I do miss you*, then I&apos;ll realize I should have been tipping&quot;like a trump&quot;and start doing so to get you back, and keep others like you on the job. Until then, please stop rolling your eyes at me and nagging me. 

I chose a job I like and that pays me satisfactorily. I&apos;m not asking you to come and pay for me to do my job. I only talk about that sort of stuff with my boss. Perhaps you should do the same, and stop bitching at everyone but your boss or yourself...

Really. If you&apos;re that unhappy, change jobs, and BE HAPPY! (Or clearly reinforce the so-called&quot;optional&quot;rules in your restaurant.)

Cheers,

-- Just_saying_it_like_it_is.
 
Last restaurant I worked in, the carryout position started at $7/hour. Tips appreciated, but optional.
 
This article come across as really whiny....

It&apos;s your job to clean the restroom, not mine. And I&apos;m not going to clean it even if I had a shit explosion on the toilet. Deal with it.

My kids are way more precious to me than you are. If I&apos;m paying for food and service then you&apos;ll be nice and friendly to my kids even if they make a mess. If you are friendly then I&apos;ll tip you accordingly. If you give me attitude I&apos;ll call the manager over and explain why I&apos;m unhappy.

If you want a tip for take out then you&apos;re just living in fantasy land.

If you don&apos;t like running back and forth then make sure I have what I need the first time. 

If I go out for a romantic time with my wife and want to grab her ass, it&apos;s not any of your business. 

Look, if you&apos;re a busboy then your job is to keep me happy. If you don&apos;t like that, then get a better job.
