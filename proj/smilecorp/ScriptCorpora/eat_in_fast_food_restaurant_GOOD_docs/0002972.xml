We think that Dickie Jo&apos;s is a far cry from the Five Guys burger joint. Always clean and staff that are helpful and friendly, locally owned and managed...why go anywhere else for a fast burger with fries? Really like this affordable and local alternative to others like Carls, McD, or Burger Kings for certain if not Five Guys or burger joints trying to be something they are not like McMinemans, (all about the beer) which makes a really bad burger for a really big price.

I happened upon this joint in between considering Not Your Moms Sandwich Shop and my search for a now non-existant Farrels. Hungry, desperate, and in the mood for an old fashioned burger were the three adjectives of the day, people. I wish I read Chuck B.&apos;s review first.

It wasn&apos;t so bad that it was inedible. It was just a flavorless burger. The fries were ok, and the &apos;DJ&apos; sauce was too--except that the tiny cup it was served in was embarassing to pick up. It felt like a piece out of a Barbie playset. Need I mention that the &apos;vine ripened tomato&apos; they promised would adorn my burger was pink? Blech.

I should have known better the moment I walked in and saw that all the items are sold ala cart. I hate burger joints that do that (see: Five Guys, Willamette Burger Co., etc.).

Unlike the rest of the reviewers, my weren&apos;t greasy at all. Nor were they luke warm. the place wasn&apos;t busy at all, most likely because the newness has worn off. This could also be the reason for the near-water like consistency of the mustard from the self serve pump (saving money?). I had to play the &apos;don&apos;t spill it&apos; game all the way back to my seat. I&apos;m sorry to say, I did not win the game.

This is the only place I know where you can get a Carl Jr&apos;s $6 Burger that&apos;s really $3.99 equivalent for $9! These people cannot be serious.

It is inconceivable to me that this rip-off joint would be so busy! $5.99 for a freaking Hot Dog! Are you kidding me? Let&apos;s see, they also feature: An interminably long wait in line just to order, French Fries hovering between luke-warm and cold when served, Fries ordered extra crisp arriving limper that crudest analogous image your mind can conjure, Overcooked &quot;Chicken Fingers&quot; as dry as the Mojave, And, oh yeah, a single seat men&apos;s room with a line rivaling the one at the order counter.

What little service there was (you order at the counter and bus your own table), was lousy. Our &quot;server&quot; managed to dump one of my indescribably bland rubber Chicken Fingers on the table top. After it finally came to rest, I suggested that I was not inclined to eat that one and requested its replacement which arrived after we were all finished eating.

How would our party of four rate our Rickie Joe&apos;s experience? Can you say &quot;Train Wreck&quot;?

I&apos;ll be back.......when dementia eats this memory from my brain!

Finally got in to try this place. Their food looks really, really good but it fools you. I liked the fries because they were fresh cut style, but the like stopped there.

The burger was very wet from grease and had no pickles on it. (How can you not have pickles on a burger??) It was impossible to eat without the paper wrapper and even that didn&apos;t help because the patty itself literally fell apart into small pieces halfway through. Couldn&apos;t even eat it. It was a bit bland as well. What wasn&apos;t bland though was their ranch dressing... it had so much garlic in it I could have used a toothbrush afterwards.

Not impressed. I wont be back.

Right in the heart of Eugene, it doesn&apos;t seem like the &apos;50s-diner theme just should work. Yet the place is always packed during the day. During the lunch hour, you&apos;ll see the parking lot full of peevish middle-aged SUV drivers honking at each other, and I guess that sums it up for me. I am just not the target clientele. For better or worse, it&apos;s a place to avoid Eugene&apos;s particular charms.

As for the food, the burger is better than you would get at, say, a freeway offramp Carl&apos;s Jr., but not by much. It&apos;s good, but not very remarkable.

The Chicago dog is done right, however, with all the toppings. The chili makes for quite good comfort food on a cold day, and their shakes are really tasty.

Let me mention the hamburger thing again, because they get nominated for &quot;Best Burger in Eugene&quot; every year. You want a burger in Eugene? Unless you&apos;re dining with elderly Midwesterners, this is not your best bet. This town has some great options. The best burgers are found at certain pub-style restaurants, typically with tons more variety, substance, and flavor. And local flavor, too.

You&apos;re in Eugene, people, face it. We&apos;re not living in the &apos;50s anymore. We&apos;re up to the &apos;60s now.

I have only had their veggie burger so I can&apos;t rate their meat burgers. It&apos;s a good veggie burger as they go, but you mostly taste the thousand island dressing. There&apos;s nothing adventurous in the burger to report: iceberg lettuce, tomato slice, the thousand island. One time I ordered the vegan burger which I believe was bean based, and I did not like it, but others might. Not crunchy enough for my taste.

Their fries are really perfect. Thin style, which I prefer.

But literally every single time I have eaten there (appox 10 times) I am acutely aware that their music is TOO LOUD. I look around and it&apos;s not a very young crowd here so why are our ears being bombarded this way?

I just don&apos;t get it and I&apos;m at the point of dreading eating there in spite of their great fries.

My mom orders a kid sized meal and saves a lot of money that way. Something to consider because it does add up.

In general the people they have up front taking orders are friendly and offer good customer service.

All in all: too noisy, a but too pricey.

Meh... I put this place in my &quot;fast food&quot; list. Sooo... When ya compare it to Mc D, Burger King, Wendy&apos;s.. I&apos;d go here first. But, not even close to a GREAT burger. A bit too greasy..

Hhmm..I do like the fries. I prefer long skinny crunchy fries to the fat jojo style so they suit me fine here. I also dig the decor. I love &quot;oldies&quot; thing. Car. Fashion. Music. Dance. So the only thing this place is missing is a Juke Box . Some Bobby socks. Pony Tails. And Letterman Sweaters..

Why all the bad reviews? It&apos;s not that pricey and it tastes good.

Greasy? It&apos;s a BURGER joint.... That&apos;s all I get so I can&apos;t speak to the other menu items...

Garlic fries are top notch, I go for the bacon and blue cheese with caramelized onions. I really like these burgers.

After a few visits here, I stand by my previous review. I just don&apos;t get it? The $10-12 meal is just not worth it.

The burgers are small, and I would definitely skip the fries if you visit, they are like soggy potatoes weighed down by cooking oil.

Good soft serve... but that&apos;s not saying much is it?

This shant be very long.

I paid about $10 for a 1/3 pound burger with cheese and bacon.  Both the cheese and bacon cost extra, .50 cents each extra.  A plain burger is about $6.50.  For a pretty small burger.   I also got the garlic fries and a soda.

The garlic fries were...well, I guess I expected crisp.  Perhaps my fault.  They were greasy and squishy.  Big huge hunks of a garlic paste were thrown haphazardly on them.  I love garlic, but not in a lumpy paste form.

The burger was good enough, but not $7.50 good.   For less money, you can get twice the burger with a lot more stuff on it from 5 Guys Burgers and Fries.

The decor is what it is.  I like 50&apos;s Diners, but it didn&apos;t do much for me either way.

I gave it a shot because it looked like my kind of place, but the reviews on Yelp! were pretty spot on.  Give it a pass.

I haven&apos;t been here in awhile, but I can&apos;t give it a thumbs-up based on my experiences here.

The food is fine to above-average.  Not great, not crappy like Carl&apos;s Jr. or something, but fine.  Tasty enough.   Unlike others, I don&apos;t mind the &quot;fake&quot; 50s atmosphere--what the hell does that mean?  &quot;Oh, this place is too 50s, I can&apos;t eat there because it&apos;s fake and I&apos;m a 22 year old hipster who acts like I&apos;m 12 and that&apos;s not cool.&quot;  Rant over.  Anyway, atmosphere is fine. It&apos;s clean. The service is good.

So why only 2 stars?  Well, I&apos;ll tell ya.  One cheeseburger (with bacon), fries, and a soda cost me almost 12 dollars.   Sorry. That does not cut it for a fast food joint. Or even a &quot;fast casual&quot; joint.  I can go to Chili&apos;s or up the road to Taylor&apos;s tavern and get a BIG burger (not the little 1/3 lb patties at DJ) and a drink for the same or LESS.

I can&apos;t justify paying 12 bucks for a meal I can get at Burger King (admittedly not as good) for half the price.

They must be doing something right though, as they seem to have Greater Eugene hoodwinked.  Not this guy.

I ate here during spring break. It was dinner time about 6 pm. It was not busy at all but that may have been due to spring break.
I ordered a cheddar cheese burger with everything, all the burgers come with fries.
The burger came quickly and was warm and juicy, the fries were fresh but I like mine a bit crunchier. the burger also seemed to lack any real character that would set it apart from any other family kind of restaurant like Red Robin or Applebees.
I&apos;ll go back and try it again when I have more time and hungrier. There was a guy sitting near me that was having a shake that looked pretty tasty.
By far a superior burger when compared to any fast food joint but not a great burger

Very good burgers and fries!! I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a better place to get a burger in Eugene.

I love Five Guys, and this place is just as good. Different, but just as good. I got the burger without sauce because I&apos;m usually not a fry sauce fan, but when I dipped my fries it was actually pretty good. The meat was cooked medium with just a little pink, which is a such a hard thing to find these days. The fries were fantastic shoe string fries, fried in clean oil and salted perfectly. I also tried a taste of the chili cheese fries and they were delicious!

This place will be on my list of places to stop when I&apos;m in Eugene.

Trevor B. wrote to inform me that I was wrong about the sign that indicates how they actually cook the meat....and my review was inaccurate or some such nonsense.  However this establishment states they serve the meat,  (and I could be wrong, I am certain I read a sign above the register stating the meat was cooked, but I may have misread) I was not mentally or physically prepared for steak tar tar; and the blood soaked bun was not estheticly pleasing.  Regardless of how you cook it, medium or medium well or well should not equal BLOODY.

Sorry if you&apos;re offended by my review, Trevor.... I stand by it.

For the full 411, hit my profile page (apparently my update bumped my initial review.) Don&apos;t Go to this place to eat and expect a good meal... just sayin.

Can you say &quot;greasy&quot;? My word... this place has the greasiest burger and fries I&apos;ve had in this town. The burger patty broke apart in 5 different places when I was eating it. Also, it was PINK IN THE MIDDLE. Absolutely disgusting! I&apos;m one of those people who cannot stand meat being the least bit undercooked (food paranoia). Plus the prices are pretty high. The quality of food is not nearly good enough to justify it.

The only reason I&apos;m giving 2 stars is because the strawberry shake I got was pretty damn good.

LOVE the ambiance!  But the ambiance doesn&apos;t fill my belly (unfortunately) so the low rating is for the overpriced mediocre food.  WHY can&apos;t we have both you say?  Ambiance AND great food?  I&apos;m not in the restaurant business so I don&apos;t know the answer, but this seems to happen ALL THE TIME in Eugene.  Is it the lack of heart and soul and instead just the necessity to make a money pit?

I understand what they&apos;re trying to achieve here - simple burger joint with good eats - and thats great except it&apos;s too expensive to fit with that profile.  I&apos;m all about simple, mediocre eats as long as the price is right.

It pains me to complain - I am thankful for the location they chose, close to downtown and campus - we need more fun places in these areas.  In my book ambiance is definitely important, but clearly it isn&apos;t everything.

Went here for lunch.  It was extremely busy, took them about 20 minutes to get my order out.

The prices are steep for what you get.  I got a cheeseburger (with fries) and a soda for $10 and it was not enough food to fill me up.  The burger was poor (burger patty was weirdly shaped, weird sauce that killed all flavors and a soggy bun) and the fries were very greasy.

I might just be a hater, but if I were to spend $10 on a burger meal I would definitely go to a different, non-sleezy joint.

I should probably give this place another try once they&apos;re fully functioning.

Update:  Went here again a few weeks later and had basically the same experience.  Do NOT get the garlic fries, you get a weak handful for 3$!

YUM!!!!

Gina and I met my friend DottieLou here for lunch and it was a great pick on her part.  We got there just as the lunch rush hit, but we were able to quickly order and get settled.  I went with a double burger with blue cheese and caramelized onions and I was thrilled at my choice.  I also ordered the garlic fries, which were chock full of awesome.  The fries were super garlicky and perfectly cooked, and the burger was moist, cooked exactly how I asked, had fresh perfect blue cheese atop the beef, and the caramelized onions were cooked to perfection.  The bun was fresh and delicious.  It was about $9 for my lunch (I had water for my drink) and it was well worth it.   I&apos;d definitely come back if I want a burger in Eugene again.

We tried to go to Cornucopia on 5th street, too crowded. So plan B...there was a line but we dropped a person off to get into it, and by the time I found a parking space on the next street, it was time for us to order.
Plenty of clean tables available. Free refills on milk! Nice. A separate line for re-ordering drinks was also a plus.
Burgers were good. Fries, just ok. A little greasy and pretty tasteless. Worst of all, the onion rings, with zero flavor. We received a green dipping sauce which sort of tasted like ranch dressing. For the onion rings? We didn&apos;t know, and we didn&apos;t like it anyway.
Overall, not the best, but not bad.

Brianna, Great Review! Spot on.

The food is mediocre at best, and very overpriced. $8 for a burger and fry, ouch!

The line is always a mess and the youngsters that work there don&apos;t have a clue as to how to manage the line and the customers needs. I think the owner needs to travel to Chicago say and get a better idea of how to make his food, service, and cost of food better.  Or maybe instead the owner should just go back to California where he belongs. Alright that last comment was a little mean, but I mean it. This guy thinks he&apos;s in San Diego... but Hello, This is EUGENE... how about a hot dog and fries deal for $3. Then I might reconsider my rating. Until then, avoid this place.

It was a cross between In N Out / Dairy Queen.  The food was OK, but the dinning experience was very lacking.  The burger was pink on the inside.  I am pretty sure there is not supposed to be pink inside a hamburger.  The red/white interior was visual intense, I felt angry and hungry while dinning inside.

Not going back.

This place is a mixed bag. The burger I got was quite tasty, well cooked with a delicious bun. The fries were just okay, I prefer the beefier thicker fries, not the tiny little shoestring variety, but that&apos;s just personal taste. There was a line to order, but it moved quickly and I got my food within a few minutes of ordering, even though the place was full.

The prices are a bit on the high side given the portion sizes, and they really nickel and dime you on the upgrades like cheese and mushrooms. Most burger places include such &quot;luxuries&quot; in the burger price. The restaurant was clean and I have no issue with the decor or ambiance, it&apos;s a fast food burger restaurant after all, not Marche! I will have a hard time coming back here when I can go to Chilis or Red Robin and get more bang for the buck.

Very good &apos;greasy 50&apos;s diner&apos; burgers.  Good shakes and fries with fry sauce!  This is not where you go if you want something healthy, but if you want a good old school burger and fries this is the place.  They had a bit of a hard time getting all the kinks worked out when they first opened and the line does seem to move a bit slow at times and it is a tad on the pricey side for a simple burger and fries, but it&apos;s usually worth it.

Love that they use Painted Hills meat for their burgers!

Some say that Cornucopia has the best burger in town and I won&apos;t argue against that.  Although, I would suggest that Corn&apos;s and DJ&apos;s burgers are very different and come from two very distinctive ideas about what a hamburger should be.

OK, OK, I may have over spoke before, we&apos;ve been back again and there are some kinks to work out. I disagree with some of what Clay S. said in his review but not everything. The food value is a little misleading, don&apos;t order a $3 side of fries and think you will get more than a handful, and the navigation of the ordering is a bit awkward.

The restaurant looked a lot better when there was nobody in it but employees. I do really like the look of the place but it is not running smooth yet. When we went in the staff was using the lunch counter space as a psuedo office with things laying around haphazardly, apparently what you see is what you get. There is no back room.

Still haven&apos;t tried the burgers yet, only the shakes and soft serve. They are both excellent and I would say the soft serve is the best value on the menu.

*I would recommend to the owners doing a little more proactive ordering system to avoid long lines where a cashier goes around old school style with a pad and takes orders from people waiting in line and takes them back to the kitchen. This is what In-N-Out does in the drive thru lines in Cali when the lines get ridiculous.

I really enjoyed the burger and garlic fries.  I had the regular burger with pepper jack cheese and all around it was just a nice burger.     It did resemble a homemade burger.   Nice and juicy, not cooked to death.   The garlic fries were very good as well, if you like garlic that is.   Prices are a little steep I think, but not high enough to stop me from visiting again.  Maybe not with the whole family though....

Was going to go to La Pearla for Pizza but hit Dickie Jo&apos;s across the street instead.

Nice clean burger joint, counter service, they give you a number though and deliver your food.  You buy a base burger and then the price just goes up with additions.  I got a double double with fries $8.99.  They have been and wine, bottle of Oregon IPA was $2.99.  Food came fast though they were not busy when we came in.  Lots of counter seating.

Kind of a take-off of   In-n-Out.  I would go again, burgers were ok, service was ok and place was clean.

Aside from the excess grease, I really like the way that the food tastes here. Everyone has been pretty harsh on this place so I&apos;ll put in a good word.

A plus for the quality of meat - that does need to be cooked longer.. I can&apos;t stand anything under well done.

Garlic fries taste great, especially dipped in their thousand island sauce.

Every time I&apos;ve eaten here, I find it extremely difficult to keep my burger from falling apart :(

I have yet to try any of their frozen treats, though I&apos;ve heard good things. That&apos;ll be on my to do list.

And yes, I know what the food from In-and-Out tastes like, but until I head down to Cali, the occasional Dickie Joes will have to suffice.

Just had my 1st experience at the New Dickie Jo&apos;s.  Been waiting for the tide to ebb back a bit.  I thought that the food and choices were excellent.  The burger reminded me of an &quot;In-n-Out&quot; style burger, but with more flavor.  I chose the double cheese (blue) with garlic fries (outstanding!), and found it plenty of food.  I&apos;m a big eater and I was surprised.

I do have to mention that I agree with others that the prices ARE a bit on the high side.  A double blue cheese, add bacon and garlic fries ran $8.95.  Not really bad, but if you consider that you have to serve and order yourself, a bit on the steep side.

Bottom line:  Although a bit towards the pricey - I&apos;ll be back... And often!

I&apos;ve eaten here 6 times and it&apos;s just getting better. I didn&apos;t like the chili I had once but I think it&apos;s the type of chili that I don&apos;t like. It&apos;s the Cincinnati style or the stuff like at Exterminator Chili in New York City.

I like the burgers, only got a burnt one once, and I don&apos;t have any beef with the portion size either. They use good meat so you must pay for it. I wish they had a buffalo burger though.

On the very rare occasion that I eat at McWendyKings I can eat a lot more food and still feel hungry for the rest of the day no matter what else I eat. I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that the HFCS or some other chemical they add stimulates hunger. I don&apos;t have that problem here. I also hate burgers that are hard to eat because they&apos;re too large. These are just the right size.

I usually get the addition of grilled onions and mushrooms. Good. And I like the shoestring fries. I grew up on them at Steak n&apos; Shake.

Forget about those people who talk about In-n-Out. That&apos;s just not such a great place unless you have nostalgia for it. Dickie Jo&apos;s is comparable to Five-Guys. Compared to Burgerville, the burger is better than a regular Burgerville burger but not better than the Burgerville seasonal specials.

Dickie Jo&apos;s is pretty good. It&apos;s a In-n-Out style place, with a relatively spartan menu compared to some of their competitors. Burgers, dogs, shakes&amp;sides; that&apos;s more or less it.

I&apos;ve been a half-dozen times and not ever gotten burger that wasn&apos;t cooked well. Sometimes the toppings arrive more on the wrapper than on the burger itself, but that&apos;s easy enough to fix.

The regular fries aren&apos;t as crispy as cornucopia&apos;s, but they aren&apos;t bad. Much better than the average fast food joint, for sure. My lady likes the garlic fries. And the fry sauce that comes with has a nice tangy taste to it. I get the chocolate shake too, when I&apos;m craving something sweet, and it&apos;s one of the best in town.

Portion size is just right; a burger and fries fills me up perfectly. Of course I would eat more fries if they doubled the serving, but that doesn&apos;t mean I actually need more. Still, I can see where other complaints come from about the price relative to how much you get.

What isn&apos;t so great is the location, and layout of the place. It&apos;s almost always impossible to get a parking spot, and there is always a wait. I know that part of the wait comes from food being made to order, but part of it also comes from the place just simply being overwhelmed.

Dickie Jo&apos;s has enough going for it to be on your list. For the shakes alone it&apos;s worth the trip, and you can do much worse than their burgers. Just be sure to bring change in case you have to park down the street at a meter.

I&apos;d heard this place compared to In-N-Out, which I miss to an embarrassing extent, so I had to give Dickie Jo&apos;s a try.  I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s up with the warring five-star and one-star reviews, but here are my thoughts:

First of all, the food is good -- really delicious, especially for fast food.  The burgers ARE actually comparable to In-N-Out&apos;s, and there are more topping options: different kinds of cheese, bacon strips, etc.  The garlic fries are awesome, and the milkshakes are yummy.

My boys were happy with their kids&apos; meals, too -- kids can choose between a burger, a hot dog, or a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, and all come with a small portion of fries and a drink.

The only real downside is price.  The ingredients really are much better than typical fast food, but I still feel like I paid too much, especially since the portions are just average, not huge.  I&apos;ll definitely go back, though.

Sure it&apos;s a burger. But that&apos;s about it. It sure is red and plaid in there too. I&apos;m not mad at the food there but that&apos;s about the best I got. Great place for anyone looking for a non memorable meal. They have veggie options too.

It&apos;s just not happening.  $12 for a cheese burger with onion rings and a drink for a burger that is marginally better than fast food is just too much. I&apos;ve given them plenty of opportunity to impress me but I&apos;ve thrown in the towel on this one.  If you really want to spend this much on a burger go to Eugene City Brewery, I think you will be much happier and you can get really good beer!

We put off going to Dickie Jo&apos;s for a long time because of all the gripes about the high prices. But it kept coming up in family conversation, so finally we took the plunge.

On a Thursday night, the line was to the door and we stood in it about 5 or 10 minutes before ordering. Our food arrived within about 5 minutes after that.

We ordered three cheeseburgers, a hot dog with rings, two sodas and two DJ&apos;s mixers, which are like Blizzards at DQ. Total: $40. It&apos;s overpriced, but considering the quality of ingredients, not terribly so. For us, the expense was tolerable because the experience overall was good and the atmosphere unique, the food is good and fresh, the service was decent, and our middleschoolers enjoyed the place.

I don&apos;t see how you can call DJ&apos;s fast food, and I don&apos;t think that&apos;s what it&apos;s meant to be. Don&apos;t expect that pace and don&apos;t expect that low quality of food. Yes, it&apos;s similar to In-n-Out, but the ingredients and choices take the food to another level.

I think everyone should try Dickie Jo&apos;s once. But go when it&apos;s not busy so you have a chance at a good experience. You might just enjoy it.

One note: Avoid the hot dogs. Colossal rip-off! Dickie AND Jo should be ashamed.

Without a doubt, this place is a knock-off of In-N-Out. With that said, it&apos;s not a bad idea to take away the brighter ideas from the most successful quality fast-food chain on the West Coast.

The burgers are definitely solid; nothing spectacular but certainly satisfying. However, they can get a bit expensive quite quickly, as your standard burger starts off at a decent price, but then every single addition from that point on tacks on some change.

All in all, Dickie Joe&apos;s is a nice change of pace from most of the restaurants and burger joints in the Eugene-Springfield area.

This 50&apos;s style diner can get really crowded, but it&apos;s a fun and hip place to people watch and eat. In my opinion Dickie Jo&apos;s is the closest thing to an In N&apos; Out burger around Eugene. It reminds me of a healthier version though for some reason. Maybe it&apos;s their all organic beef  shipped in from Alpen Rose Dairy in Portand? When I want a cheeseburger I usually come here if I&apos;m too tired to make my own at home.

Been hearing a buzz about this place so we tried it out.  My wife went and picked it up and brought it home.  At first, I thought to myself, This is pretty good! Garlic fries!?!? Right on!  But after eating a few more, I realized that these things look like shoe laces that&apos;re drenched in grease.  That kinda made me lose my appetite really....I liked the taste, but I couldn&apos;t eat more than 3 of them.  The burger was OK....I got blue cheese and grilled onions...price goes up with each item you get extra.  My burger alone was close to 8 bucks and I dont feel it&apos;s worth 8 bucks at all.  I would MUCH rather go to Red Robin and get bottomless drinks and bottomless fries with a Blue ribbon burger for $10 a person.

This place is just plain good.  Their burgers are probably the best in town.  And yes, I have been to the Vintage, Hop Valley Brewery, and Cornucopia.  Their food is cheep, consistent, and tasty!  The only complaints I would have is sometimes the fries are a little too greasy (although I have always ordered the garlic fries and maybe it&apos;s just the sauce they use for the garlic flavoring) and once my chocolate shake tasted like chemicals (and I don&apos;t mean aspartame or red dye #4, I mean strychnine or antifreeze.  But hell, I lived to tell the story!
