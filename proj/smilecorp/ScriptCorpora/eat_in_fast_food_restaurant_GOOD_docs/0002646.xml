 Mounties in Surrey, B.C., have cordoned off an area and set up an evidence tent after the discovery of a body behind a fast food restaurant. 

Police say the body is that of a man in his early forties.

RCMP Insp. Randall Marquardt says the body was found Sunday morning behind the restaurant just off King George Boulevard.

Marquardt says the man is known to police.

Police aren&apos;t saying how the man died or if the death is suspicious.
