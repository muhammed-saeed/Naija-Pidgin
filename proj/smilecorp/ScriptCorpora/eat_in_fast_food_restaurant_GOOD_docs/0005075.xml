Treeplanting (Prince George)
Date: 2011-04-26, 12:55PM PDT
Reply to: see below [Errors when replying to ads?] 
I work for Spectrum Resource Group. 
www.srgi.ca 
My name is Branden Beatty and I run a tree planting camp of around 45 planters in the spring and summer months outside of Prince George, BC. 
Spring 2011 season begins May 13th 
1.9 million trees, L&amp;M;Vandeerhoof. Average price 10.5 cents. 
Summer 2011 season begins June 24th 
1.1 million trees Mackenzie, Average price 10.5 cents. 
We expect to have between 34-45 planting days this season. 
We are looking for experienced resource workers, preferably veteran planters, to join the team. 
My camp tries to be environmentally responsible given our circumstance. I also try my hardest to maintain an open and inclusive social environment within the camp, in promotion of gender and LGBT equality. The camp has everything a seasoned planter would expect in the field (shower trailers, internet, $25/day camp cost). I would be happy to answer any questions you might have about the approaching season. 
If you are interested in working with us, my name is Branden and my cell is 250 858 2056. Please call directly, no employment agencies. 
Keep in mind, with Spectrum, there is much more work than just planting, therefore a versatile worker could expect to have access to brushing, herbicide (basal and broadcast contracts), layout, beetle probing, fall and burn, and other forestry resource jobs from early spring until late fall. 
Location: Prince George 
Compensation: $150-400/day
