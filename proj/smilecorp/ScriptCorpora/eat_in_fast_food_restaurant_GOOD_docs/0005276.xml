The First Years Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Sleep System 3073

 Compare Prices Date Published: 4/7/08 


If you like a product that can multi-task, you&apos;ll appreciate the metamorphic qualities of The First Years Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Sleep System. It can be used as a bassinet, bedside sleeper, play seat, changing table, and portable sleeper.

Plus, the Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Sleep System is easy on the eyes. With ruffled fabric and tastefully hidden storage pockets, the bassinet is able to fit into nearly any decor. When used as a bassinet, the portable sleeper (with a comfy carrying handle) fits right into a sturdy stand that can be set to either rock or remain stationary. A carrying handle with built-in vibrating and music options, makes it simple to remove a sleeping baby from the bassinet base and carry the baby from room to room with little disturbance. Once the portable sleeper is separated from the bassinet stand, a vinyl-covered changing surface is revealed beneath the portable sleeper.

When it&apos;s time for bed, you can still keep baby close by, thanks to the adjustable height function of the bassinet. What&apos;s more, it tethers to an adult bed to keep the base stable when moving the baby from (or into) the bassinet.

The Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Sleep System includes plush toys that attach to the portable sleeper&apos;s canopy to convert the portable portion into a play seat to help keep a baby entertained.

We appreciated this easy-to-assemble product, which took one person less than an hour to put together, but warn that the base does not fit through all doorways. That said, removing the portable sleeper from the base made this an obstacle that was easy to overcome.

We liked the nightlight feature, which offers a handy way to keep a baby&apos;s sleeping area gently lit, but overall, the Sleep System 3073&apos;s ability to function in so many different ways is what made it a winner.
