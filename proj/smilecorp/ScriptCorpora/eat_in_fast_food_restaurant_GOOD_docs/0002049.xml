Dinner @ Mak&apos;s Place
 No it was not at Mak&apos;s as in mum&apos;s place. It is Mak&apos;s Place - The Hawkerant, serving restaurant food at hawker prices! Yeah we had dinner there and this hawkerant serves a wide variety from western food to porridge to noodles and seafood.

I have been craving for seafood dinner. DH had promised to bring me there to eat. I brought mum and Liza along as well.

And these were what we had ...

 Sweet and Sour Sliced Fish
