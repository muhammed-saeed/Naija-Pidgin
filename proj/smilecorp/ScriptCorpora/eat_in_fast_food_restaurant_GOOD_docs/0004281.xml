 Sunday, March 04, 2007 
 Kia Ora (Hello), I have listed the foodie blogs on the side-bar as given time, the post which currently has them listed will eventually move down to the bottom of the bog - oopp&apos;s blog !!! 
 
 I intend making a few changes to this blog and given time I may even change the name. On second thoughts I might not change the name.........I typed World Recipes&amp;Foodie Blogs into Google just to see if it would show up and it did - it was #1 out of 13,600,000 which also meant typing in and clicking on the I&apos;m feeling lucky button also brings it up. 
 
 Anyway, first things first - there is a lot of truth in the saying &quot;You are what you eat&quot;. I don&apos;t follow and never have believed in the old saying of &quot;you have to eat five a day and drink 8 glasses of water&quot;. To me that is a total load of crap. To prove my point, in a few days when I return, I&apos;ll tell you what I have eaten and drunk from now till then the time I return. You will see for youselves how much I eat. A few facts - I don&apos;t smoke, I don&apos;t drink alcohol. I don&apos;t do drugs of any sort. I weigh 65 kilos wringing wet. I don&apos;t sit down at night and have an evening meal; I eat breakfast sometimes; I drink coffee, tea and soft drinks. As for drinking water, I may drink one glass per day. I eat almost anything and I eat when I feel like it. I don&apos;t have set meal times. I can&apos;t recall the last time I went to the doctor - I know that it was many many moons ago and I went then only because it was a condition of employment to have a check-up. I have worked at my present employment for about 15 years and never had a day off work sick all that time. I don&apos;t play any type of sports - come to think of it, I don&apos;t watch any sports either, be it on TV or live. The only thing I do a lot of is walk, averaging around 6 - 7 kilometres per hour at a normal pace. 
 
 So, hold on to your seats, so you don&apos;t fall off - skinny friends that is - the bigger friends no doubt have enough weight to anchor themselves to the chair so they don&apos;t fall off. I have beat about the mullberry bush long enough with some of you bigger friends out there - you need to lose weight. 
 Skinny friends who are supposeably the ideal weight for their size, age, etc give yourselves a pat on the back, because I can&apos;t reach from where I sit. Bigger friends, just remain seated and raise your hands because I know you can&apos;t reach around to pat yourself on the back. Come on, I can&apos;t see any raised hands and I know there are some big friends out there. It&apos;s not a shame to be over-weight. It&apos;s only a shame if you keep eating the way you do and adding to that weight when you know full well, that you could and should eat less. 
 
 I know some of you have tried so many diets that I have to take my shoes&amp;socks off to count how many times because I don&apos;t have enough fingers. My simple answer is stop eating !!! You don&apos;t have to eat 3 meals per day plus snacks, day in, day out. Miss food for a day - drink fluids. Use up some of those &quot;love handles&quot;. Make it a day that you don&apos;t have to work, a Saturday, Sunday or whenever so you can relax at home. By relaxing, I don&apos;t mean plop yourself down on the couch with the TV remote in one hand and weight-lift a beer can with the other hand. Get outside, do some gardening, mow the lawn (if you have got one) or get out and go for a walk. You know, one foot in front of the other and leave the car at home, walking. I don&apos;t mean arm-swinging, fast pace walking (that will come in time) just a steady as it goes nice 5 km walk arould your neighourhood. Try 30 minutes out and 30 minutes back with no pit-stops for take-aways or just a quick chat with the neighbour in the local watering water. (I sat on the doorstep of someones place for 3 hours one time so I know someone&apos;s idea of just a quick chat) 
 
 I know it&apos;s alright for me to say to you to miss meals, because I don&apos;t have to prepare food for other members of the family like you do but if you sit down to eat with them, whatever you put on your plate to start with, cut it in half and put half on another plate. You may find that half is plenty - if not, and you feel the need to eat the other half go for it, but keep doing that - half your meals, including your breakfast. Given time, you will find yourself dishing up less. 

 I&apos;ll love&amp;leave you with this..........Many moons ago, there was a saying about a bigger person been a 2 x 2. That is two axe handles wide by two axe handles high. I don&apos;t hear it very much these days for the simple reason that people are no longer 2 x 2 - they are 3 x 3 instead. I have seen people so big travelling on the bus, that they have to board the bus side-ways so they can get in. Then when they finally squeeze themselves into a seat, they take up both seats - well one and a half, with me squashed on the other half. I seem to be a magnet for the bigger person, when ever I am on a bus. Just as well I am just a little person, krazy maybe, but still little. 
 
 I&apos;ll be back.............. Posted by Kelvin at Sunday, March 04, 2007

 Meat Not So Cheap 

As the meat industry marks 125 years this week since the first export shipment of frozen meat, you have to wonder why we are paying the same prices as people in the UK. Despite the fact, that the meat has travelled 20,000 kilometres, a shoulder of fresh lamb sold in UK supermarkets costs NZ$17.10 per kilo, yet here in NZ we are paying NZ$18 per kilo. Diced NZ lamb is even cheaper at NZ$15.62 per kilo, while we still have to pay NZ$18 per kilo. A fresh leg of lamb though in UK costs NZ$16.23 per kilo, while we pay NZ$14 per kilo.
NZ exports 92% of its lamb, which leaves only 8% for local consumption - mainly unwanted legs, I bet.

 Cheap as Chips
 
You would of thought with NZ been surrounded by the sea, that fish would of been one of the cheapest foods available to purchase, but it isn&apos;t. Snapper, one of the more popular fish has risen to $14.95 per kilo for whole fish. If you don&apos;t want to go to all the trouble of filleting the fish yourself, you can expect to pay nearly $32 per kilo for fillets. It seems that a kilo of whole fish after it has been de-headed and boned results in only around 350 grams of fillets. The bones&amp;the head are the best part of the fish and make the best soup. You get to suck the eyeballs out of the fish head as well so buy a whole fish and enjoy. There are still places arounnd that wrap their fish&amp;chips in newspaper.

 Hot News 

If you thought that chilli peppers, aren&apos;t all that old, think again. An archaeological study has discovered that chilli peppers (why they call them chilli is beyond me, as they are as hot as Hell) were added to change the flavour of other wise bland-tasting food, long before the construction of the first pyramids in Egypt. In fact they have achieved the culinary accolade of being the oldest known kitchen condiment after scientists found evidence that people were cooking with them more than 6000 years ago. Scientists used a technique that involved analysing microscopic starch grains found on cooking and grinding tools from 6100 years ago at two sites in Ecuador. Chilli peppers belong to the capsicum group but are technically classed as fruits.

 Farmers Markets 

No, it&apos;s not a market where you can pick up a farmer for a song, but where you can purchase produce&amp;other goodies sold direct to you from the vendors. The markets have a code of practice, that says farmers / vendors may only sell what they themselves, grow, farm, pickle, preserve, bake, smoke or catch. The markets are intended to foster community spirit. You need to take along your own basket or cloth bags - remember you are been green - as some of the stall holders don&apos;t have plastic bags. The nearest market that I know of to where I live is the one called City Farmers Market, held at Britomart (behind the train station) in the central city area on Saturdays from 8.30am - 12.30pm. There are 32 Farmers Markets around NZ.

 Northland Pineapples 

If you thought pineapples were only available in yellow and could be grown only in places with tropical heat, like Queensland, well think again, because a Northland grower has set up NZ&apos;s first RED pineapple farm / plantation at Rangiputa. What can you do with a red pineapple ? Well, everything that you usually do with a yellow one except sit on it of course. It seems that pineapples are hardy little growers and can withstand drought, wind, full sun, shade or even a light frost, but in Northland ? I remember when I was a kid living in the north it was so cold in the mornings sometimes, that clothes left out overnight on the clothesline would be as stiff as a board. There&apos;s them growing pineapples of all things.

 Off The Menu 

Sugar laden soft drink, Spite is to be taken off all menus of a NZ fast food restaurant chain and replaced with artificially sweetened Sprite Zero. One small step for mankind, one big step for trying to combat the high level of obesity and the development of diabetes, especially in children - I don&apos;t think so. To me, it&apos;s not the wrong type of food and the drink that is the cause - it&apos;s the amount of food&amp;drink that is consumed, that is the cause. The old saying of - you are what you eat, rings true. I eat all foods in moderation and as friends will tell you, I am as skinny as a rake. In fact if I took all my clothes off and stood next to the rack, you wouldn&apos;t see me. Come to think of it, you wouldn&apos;t see any of my friends either - all you would see would be their dust !!! (hehe) Posted by Kelvin at Saturday, February 24, 2007

 World Recipes&amp;Foodie Blogs 
 &quot;Spolit For Choice&quot; 

We, New Zealander&apos;s are spoilt for choice when it comes to the amount&amp;the variety of food available not only in our food stores, supermarkets, service/petrol stations with mini supermarkets which are open 24/7 but also the variety of food available from takeaways, restaurants and cafes. Last year, NZ had a total of 3524 takeaway outlets, as well as 6705 restaurants&amp;cafes. New food places seem to be sprouting up all the time and one place that has sprouted is the Nosh Gourmet Food Market in Glen Innes, one of Auckland&apos;s suburbs. I haven&apos;t been out there to have a look yet, but one day.........!!! From what I have heard from friends though is that it&apos;s a great place for &apos;&quot;fresh food&quot;, although a little on the high side price wise, but it&apos;s the same old story - you get what you pay for and when you pay a little extra, well you get top-nosh !!! Don&apos;t take my word or my friend&apos;s word for it - check it out for yourself, if you just happen to be out that way.

 Spud Lovers !! 

It seems that people in the deep south who love oysters, pay top $ to get the first of the season&apos;s harvest, while here in the north, people will do the same to get the first of the season&apos;s new potatoes - Jersey Benne !!! The new potatoes are intitally selling at $10 per kilo - a dollar up on last season&apos;s prices but the price is expecting to drop to $8 per kilo. The grower planted his organic crop in June and is just starting to harvest them now. As more potatoes from other growers start to be harvested, the price is expected to drop to $5 per kilo.

 Curry Flavour Mushrooms - Nothing New 
 
 A company is selling small brown, curry-scented milkcap mushrooms (10 pound for 250 grams) which are said to be a natural food that grows wild in their country. When I mentioned the fact to Granny Smith, she said that curry-scented mushrooms were nothing new. She said that many moons ago when she grew her own mushrooms in cold&amp;damp places she used to mix packets of curry powder into the mix in which the &quot;mushrooms&quot; grew. The mushrooms picked up the &quot;curry&quot; which resulted in &quot;curry-tasting&quot; mushrooms, so there you go. Also when she saw mushrooms growing wild on her property she made up a &quot;curry mix&quot; and feed that to the mushrooms . Another thing she used to grow was &quot;pink daffodils&quot; !!! They will be a couple of the things, I will grow on my property, when I get old(er). As for mushrooms, well I already have friends who treat me like a mushroom - &quot;they fed me shit and keep me in the dark&quot; !!! (hehe)

 Healthy Food ??? 
 
The Board of Health in New York is out to keep New Yorker&apos;s healthy with a proposal to ban cooks at any of its more than 24,000 food service establishments from using ingredients containing the artery-clogging substance, commonly listed on labels as partially hydrogenated oil, otherwise known as artificial trans-fat. Under the proposal, which has yet to be approved, restaurants would need to get artificial trans-fat out of cooking oils, margarine and shortening by next July 1st and all other foodstuffs by July lst, 2008. The proposal would create a huge problem for national fastfood chains.The ban would not affect grocery stores and would not apply to naturally occuring trans-fats found in some meat and dairy products. A similar ban has been proposed in Chicago, but is still under consideration.

 Jumbo Chocolate Chip Cookies 

Beat 500g softened butter, 1&amp;1/4 cups of brown sugar, and 1 - 395gram can of condensed milk in a bowl until light&amp;fluffy. Combine together 2 cups self-raising flour&amp;3 cups plain flour and add to the mix.Stir in 500g Dark chocolate bits.Roll 1/3 cupfuls of mix into balls. Place 4 at a time on greased oven trays . Press balls to form a 10cm circle. Cook in a moderate oven, 180 degrees C for about 15 minutes or until lightly browned.


 
 Ice Cream !!! 
 
 Street&apos;s Ice Cream one of the oldest brands of ice cream, is made by Unilever Foods. It is also one of the several different brands sold in supermarkets&amp;dairies, throughout Australia&amp;NZ. With so many brands avaiable, it is difficult trying to &quot;pick&quot; what sort of ice cream to choose.


 More Ice Cream....... 

One of NZ&apos;s own ice cream companies, Tip Top Ice Cream was started in 1935. Some of NZ&apos;s favourites would have to be - Hokey Pokey; French Vanilla and just plain Vanilla. As well as supermarkets&amp;dairies, there are small shops in the shopping malls, which sell nothing but ice creams and or sorbets. There are also &quot;mobile ice cream&quot; trucks, which ply their trade driving around the streets playing a tune, which would have to be the second worst tune, next to that frog or whatever you like to call him.

 Peppercorns !!! 
 
 Peppercorns grow as a symbiotic climbing vine called &quot;piper nigrum&quot; on a tall thin tree in India, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. The berries are green, then ripen to bright red and hang in clusters like grapes. 
 Black pepper is the unripe berries that have been picked by hand and then left toi dry and shrivel in the sun. 
White pepper ripens on the vine than is hand-picked, soaked and milled to remove the outer skin. Because of this treatment, they never taste as aromatic as the black ones.
Green peppercorns are picked unripe then freeze-dried or preserved in jars.
Pink peppercorns which come from South America have a mild flavour and are appreciated for their colour.
It is best to grind peppercorns as you need them, not only because the smell tickles your tastebuds, but because once ground, pepper rapidly loses it&apos;s flavour.
Pepper is of course a stimulant, a diuretic, improves sexual ardour, reduces fever and aids digestion. If food is love, pepper enchamces that love with mystery&amp;eartiness.

Grind a peppercorn or two over a &quot;dish of softened ice cream&quot; and......... ???

 I&apos;ll be back............ Posted by Kelvin at Saturday, October 14, 2006 Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom)
