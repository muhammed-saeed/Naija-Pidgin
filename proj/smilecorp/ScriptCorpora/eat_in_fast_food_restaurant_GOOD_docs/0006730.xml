 Los Angeles to ban fast food restaurants for a year 
 Friday, July 25th, 2008 
 

Under the guise of protecting people from themselves, the city of Los Angeles has decided to ban new fast food restaurants for a period of 1 year in a 32 square mile area.

So what is a fast food restaurant according to the city of Los Angeles?

 The city defines fast-food restaurants as those that sell food to eat there or to take out and have a limited menu, items prepared in advance or heated quickly, no table orders and disposable wrapping or containers.

That’s right, if you don’t finish your food the city of Los Angeles would prefer that you throw it away instead of having a snack the next day. Preposterous? We think so.

The city does seem to have some numbers which support its case and we would certainly agree with some of them. For example, they say that south LA has the highest concentration of fast food restaurants. If our analysis of Starbucks and McDonalds near Santa Fe Springs (South LA) is any indication of the rest of the area then they are most definitely correct. Additionally they claim that 30% of adults are obese in south LA compared to 20.9% for the county, and for children the city has rates of 29% compared to 23.3 for the county. These correlations don’t prove a link, but it is certainly suspicious.

The real issue here isn’t that some consumers are eating too much, it is instead a more philosophical debate between people who think that ordinary citizens can think and make choices for themselves and those who think that the city government should think and decide for them. Laws like this treat citizens as children and hamper businesses. We would like to see the city promoting more healthy choices, perhaps giving tax credits to healthy restaurants instead of this kind of draconian ban. Clearly there is some reason why these fast food restaurants are doing so well in south LA, and it seems to make more sense to find out why that is (cost, convenience, service, etc), and help healthy restaurants meet those challenges.

If healthy restaurants in the area could provide alternative serious competition to the fast food places then the problem would sort itself out naturally (pun intended ), but this is not the best way to go about this.

In short, eat your McDonalds and drink your Starbucks in moderation.
