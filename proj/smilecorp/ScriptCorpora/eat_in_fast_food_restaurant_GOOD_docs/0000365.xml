Love Greek/ Mediterranean food. I had it to go at this location after an awesome workout at the gym. I want something not too heavy and tasty, of course, after a hard workout. Daphne&apos;s does the job.

Chicken wrap, hummus and Greek salad on the side with a ice cold black tea. Perfect meal.

From some of the reviews, it looks like there are unpleasant staffing. But the service I received was good. The girl got my order and it came out in a timely manner.

I was a happy camper.

Daphne&apos;s California Greek was a very big disappointment when I went there last night (5/6/12)  with a few of my friends.

My friends and I were hungry after the movies and one of them decided upon coming here. I wasn&apos;t opposed to the idea as I&apos;m a very big fan of greek and mediterranean food.

We got there and the place wasn&apos;t too busy so we were able to order and waited for our food. We sat down at a table and placed our numbers indicating our order next to the unique looking salt and pepper shakers. (Those salt and pepper shakers might have been the only good thing about this place)

After waiting a good while, our food started to slowly come out.

My one friend ordered a meat dish with pita bread and such and it didn&apos;t look too bad. He said it was pretty good so the rest of us were eager to have our taste at this place.

My boyfriend order the flatbread pizza&amp;I ordered the mix and match plate with chicken and beef kabob with side orders of hummus and tabouli.
My boyfriend said his pizza was pretty ok, but in the end &quot;it was just pizza.&quot;

My food itself was rather dissatisfying as the meat was dry, the tabouli tasted old and the hummus kind of tasted like watered down paste.
I understand that this place is a chain, but the quality of food for even a chain restaurant was below sub-par.

My other two friends ordered a pita burger and another mix and match plate.

The friend that ordered the pita burger told us why he ordered that by showing us what he thought it  was supposed to look like by comparing it to advertisement.
Now granted that food advertisements are stylized and etc, his meal was so far from the actual image that you couldn&apos;t help but feel bad for the guy. (It was THAT... sad..)

As for my other friend who ordered her mix and match plate, she was served with two incorrect sides and when telling the worker about the mistake, the employee merely responded with &quot;it must be someone eles&apos;s then.&quot;
After my friend had to explain to her that it was actually a mistake, the employee resentfully walked back to the kitchen and brought back the correct sides.

Now, I&apos;ve worked in food service and I understand the pains of customers and misunderstandings, etc. I get it-- it&apos;s annoying; but mind you, my friend was politely informing the employee of the error and merely wanted to get what she ordered and paid for.
The employee did not even apologize for her mistake (as she was the one that took her order) and then tries to claim &apos;it might be someone else&apos;s&quot; ?

As my friends and I finished up, yes we ate our food because we were hungry we knew we were never going to come back.

Long story short, aside from the dry food and rude service, there really isn&apos;t much else to say about this place.

Daphnes  California Greek has left such a sour taste in my mouth and it wasn&apos;t just from the tabouli.
It&apos;s quite the bummer as I&apos;m such a fan of this type of food and it&apos;s a shame I will never be coming back here.

Mmm I love Daphne&apos;s.  I know it&apos;s pretty generic food but they pull it off for a quick craving of hummus or kabobs&amp;rice pilaf.  I&apos;m not sure about other locations but I really favor this one on Huntington.  They recently revamped their menu and they finally crossed over to Coke.  I hated the Pepsi options, gross.  They also added a &quot;flavor shots&quot; option so I turned my Light Lemonade into a Cherry Light Lemonade.  Sometimes the drink is just as important as the meal you&apos;re gonna wash it down with.

I usually order the Chicken Kabob plate- 2 kabobs, 2 sides, pita bread.  That&apos;s all you really need and it&apos;s carb loaded so it&apos;s probably best to order lunch here.

I&apos;ll be back Daphne!

Oh yes, they also cater incase you&apos;re craving generic Greek food for a party ;-)

Since the health kick change has been made by Daphnes&apos;, I have to admit my attendance has been less. They used to have these fried pitas that were this shiz, but I get it...they want to be healthy.

All in all, i realize that after I ate here, I don&apos;t really enjoy  real greek food at other places b/c I compare them to how Daphnes preps them. So I&apos;ll start off with saying, I&apos;m probably being bias.

Dolmas - hellz yes
Spankopita - perfect crisp and ooze of filing
Greek salad - good mix
Pita burgers w/ fire feta - droollllling and so infectious
Street pita - pretty good
Fried shrimp - tasty
Gyro meat - me likey
Lemon chicken soup - OMG freeakkin fantastic
Feta fries - so simple, so tasty , so addictive

It&apos;s a franchised Greek restaurant cafe, so I&apos;ll be brief.

+ Very meticulous, dining area and restrooms (2 single occupancy, male and female).
+ Friendly staff
+ Receipt has a feedback survey coupon (2 free sides and drink with the purchase of an entree)
+ Promo: Mondays $3.99 pita burgers, Wednesdays $1.25 street pitas.
+ Indoor and outdoor seating.
+ Soda fountain has flavor dispensers (vanilla, cherry, orange)

Last night, had dinner here with the family (we had coupons). Discovered their Monday and Wednesday promotions. I thought to myself, &quot;Dang it, wish it was Monday because that burger looks good!&quot; But the street pitas are good; bites-sized (the gyro equivalent of sliders). They&apos;re normally about 2 for $6, so it&apos;s quite the deal! I had about 5 of them (3 gyros, 2 chicken). *haha*

I find the environment and food to be enjoyable. I&apos;m surprised that this place is only getting an average rating (as of today, May 26, 2011). It&apos;s still not a place I&apos;d go regularly, but as long as that Monday and Wednesday promotion continues, I&apos;ll be a fan. (^_^)
