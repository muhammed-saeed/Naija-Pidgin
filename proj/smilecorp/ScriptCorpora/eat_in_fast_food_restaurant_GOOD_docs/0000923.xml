	<description>There&apos;s a good amount of seats and looks comfy.. more so than your typical fast food restaurant. The cashier who took the order was quite handsome, which is a plus.</description>

I rarely post reviews, but this place ticked me off. I waited 15 minutes in the drive-thru for a breakfast burrito..and there were no cars in front of me. When it finally came I said &quot;long wait for a burrito&quot;. The snarky window attendant said  &quot;I know, sorry&quot; and quickly shut the window. The burrito was as subpar as the service. I will never return.

This review is only for the Garden Avocado Cheeseburger and fries. Based on the reviews and just by glancing at the menu, I was not expecting much at all! But it&apos;s within walking distance to the office and I was looking for something quick and easy.

I&apos;ve been there a couple of times now. The first time, I only ordered the garden burger. It came with veggies, pickles, cheese, avocado, and 1000 Island dressing. I thought it would get soggy halfway through eating it, but it was good to the last bite! It&apos;s not the best veggie burger I&apos;ve ever had, but it was decent and pretty filling. It had good texture.

The second time, I got the burger and an order of fries. Waaaay too much food! Potatoes really fill you up! This time, I had them omit the dressing, but they left out the cheese too! I was kinda bummed, but it was still good. I love avocado on my sandwiches and burgers! So yummy!

This place is a decent lunch place when I&apos;ve forgotten my lunch or if I don&apos;t want to drive to go get it.

We love the onion rings here and I like that they have 2 sizes to chose from. They also have no problem giving out Ranch dressing with your order. I usually get the 1/4lb burger combo and my hubby gets the taquito plate with rice and beans. They have very good crispy fries here too. The drive thru takes a long time to get though so you have to have some time to spare.

Went here for lunch, quick service and a very, very yummy Gyro wrap. The fries are the thick kind and they cook them to just the right crispness. Soft on the inside, crispy out. I&apos;ll definitely be returning. There are so many choices on the menu, there is sure to be something to please everybody. Parking can be a bit of a pain, since it is a small lot and lots of people go here for lunch. However, waiting for a spot will be worth it if you want a good &apos;ol comfort food lunch.

Your typical burger place that serves practically everything.  They even serve breakfast at lunch time. I got a cheeseburger, and the husband got a steak burrito.  My cheeseburger was ok, everything except onions and they put a lot of pickles which I like.  The husbands steak burrito was another story.  It was really wet.  After 2 bites, the bottom end opened up and it was no longer easy to pick up.  It had to be eaten with a knife and fork.  Besides being super messy, it was just ok....

Not sure if we&apos;d return.

Parking can be hard as they&apos;re super busy at lunch time.

So, you don&apos;t know what you want to eat, but you want it fast, now, hot off the griddle, with no fuss? Well, then, Tom&apos;s has got your next meal.

There is a Tom&apos;s just a short drive away so, driven by curiosity, we stopped in. Just like the outside, the inside is clean, no frills, and ready for your appetite sort of place. A cross between a to-go grill counter and a salad-bar centric Denny&apos;s, Tom&apos;s has a huge menu. If it can be fried, grilled, or heated up quickly, Tom&apos;s will make one for you.

We stood staring at the huge menu board posted above the counter, caught in a state of indecision. What to order? Burger? Mexican? Diner food like fried chicken? Go light with a simple salad? Nearly frozen with hunger, we finally took the leap.

Our first visit, it was the burgers. These are classic diner burgers. They are big, fresh, and just messy enough to mean business. You may not say that this is the best burger you have ever eaten, but you&apos;ll be happy enough to wolf this down with a smile.

Next time around, we opt for diner food. The fried chicken plate wins us over. It comes with an obligatory salad bar, which was surprisingly fresh. and clean. Again, we left full and content.

If you are looking for gourmet food or an eye-opening experience, then this isn&apos;t the place. However, they earned my four stars because they are exactly what they look like. This is a diner/grill with counter ordering and a server who smiles when your food is brought to your table. The menu is expansive and the food is satisfying.

I&apos;ve written another review about how much I love Tom&apos;s on a whole, but the following is my past experience:

I tried a &quot;vegetarian&quot; meal. I got the avocado burger with cheese and subbed the meat for a veggie-patty.  I also ordered a side-salad. this location (unlike the new one) has a salad bar, so I got to pick whatever I wanted for my salad. I also got an orange bang with free refills!

Ah man, breakfast burritos will hit the spot when a craving comes along and there&apos;s nothing better than one the morning after a heavy night of drinking.

With eggs, hash browns, salsa, tapatio and ketchup, you are amazing.  My only complaint is that I don&apos;t eat meat and I asked for mine without bacon, but apparently no bacon or meat meant &quot;please lace my breakfast burrito with as much bacon as you can possible put in it.&quot;  I tried to pick it out but I was so hungry I didn&apos;t care.

But gosh does the drive thru take forever!  Cheap food with large portions, I inhaled my burrito.

I always get the veggie sandwich w/zucchinis.

Veggie sandwich  - just perfect amount of alfalfa sprouts, avocado, tomato, lettuce and cheese. Just ask for your fav bread choice =)

Zucchinis always perfect, cut in the right bite size and nicely crisp. Make sure to wait till it cools down a bit =)

There is a lady there that isn&apos;t so friendly... shoulder length blondish red hair. other than that, All to the Good

The service seems a little.... Lacking. My boy friend wanted the combo and they didn&apos;t ring it up that way. Then his mom ordered large Fries and they brought a small. I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t order anything.

Talk about &quot;bad timing&quot;!!!

Yesterday I was seriously wanting a breakfast burrito so I popped on yelp to find a drive-thru place that was nearby.
I found a couple and decided on Tom&apos;s Place. I had been here once before but it was many years ago.
I remembered having coworkers that loved this place.

So I headed over... Sunday morning about 10am. .. The inside had a few people, but no one in the drive thru.
I ordered my breakfast burrito with no meat, add potatoes and a drink, it was $5.65.. not bad.
Service was quick and friendly.

The burrito was OK, except for that fact that it was loaded with chunky tomato salsa that was very watery and a little spicy.
I had to spoon out most of it because that is all I could taste.
If I ever went back I would get &apos;NO SALSA&quot; and the burrito would be entirely different and better.

So about an hour later I am flipping thru the OC Register and read that this place had their permit suspended 3 days prior due to cockroach infestation.
How&apos;s that for timing???

My husband brought me here a lot before he started working a lot of morning shifts, and I&apos;m kind of glad he works in the AM now so I can avoid coming here...

The only word that comes to mind for their breakfasts is oily or greasy. Everything was always glistening and dripping with grease and I always ended up feeling sick or gross after eating here to the point when he did bring me I&apos;d just order toast and fruit. When I bit into the sausages, more yellowish oil would drip out. This place is also not the cleanest and the plates are so old and worn that there&apos;s no shine to them and were usually dull and chalky. Not sure if I&apos;m willing to try their lunch items if their breakfast is that oily.

I wanted to give this place a higher review... but I just couldn&apos;t. Anyway, my parents and I decided to try out this place, b/c we drove by it earlier and noticed lots of cars parked in their lot and it seemed like a happening place. So, later in the day, we decided why not.. let&apos;s go get some burgers for dinner.

So, this is strictly a review on their burgers...
1) avocado bacon cheeseburger
2) avocado bacon burger
3) bacon cheese burger

Overall, the burgers were huge, so in that sense you are getting a pretty good deal. The total cost of the three burger plus 1 small order of fries was about $17.00.

According to my parents, there wasn&apos;t a lot of avocado since they had variations of the avocado burgers. As for me, I had the bacon cheeseburger.. and it was meh, nothing was wrong with it in particular and nothing was special about this burger. It&apos;s like something one would make at home with their own BBQ grill.

We didn&apos;t eat here, but there&apos;s the option of sitting in if you wish. There&apos;s a good amount of seats and looks comfy.. more so than your typical fast food restaurant. The cashier who took the order was quite handsome, which is a plus. :)

Anyway, I might come back again and try something else.. They do have an extensive menu -- covers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert (I saw ice-cream and sundaes, etc..). Oh, and there&apos;s a drive-thru which is convenient for those who are in a rush.

It&apos;s been a while ....

So after a night of drinking and waking up with the worst hangover EVER.  I just wanted something to eat that had everything, something that I could eat with my hands and something fried.  So I decide I&apos;ll have a breakfast burrito.

I saw this ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 

Don&apos;t fall for it.

It&apos;s not even the best breakfast burrito on the corner and this is the only place on the corner.

I mean, the signage boasts about the fresh home fries in the burrito.  I ordered mine with no cheese but when I finally went to take a bite, there was no cheese, they got that right ... but also no home fries.

Not only that, they put so much salsa in the burrito ... when I tried to pick it up, it kinda squirted.  (I&apos;ll leave this alone)

Maybe the food was bad because of the hangover, maybe not.  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be going back to find out with all the other choices around the area.

Anyway ... since it&apos;s been a while since I had a 1 star review, you can imagine how happy I was to throw away my food after taking a 1/2 a bite.

Great Burgers and  Gyros!

Ok, there are at least two locations. One on Orangethorpe and this one. I think they are the same owners because of the address on the bag.

I have pretty much had everything on the menu here and now stick to two items that are yummy. Details are as follows:

1. Double Cheeseburger with Grilled Onions-4 stars
2. Gyros: All of them are great-4 stars.
3. Good breakfast deals, but I am not much of a fan: 2-3 stars.
4. Mexican Style Food-2 stars.
5. Service-3 stars.
6. Ambiance: This is a corner hamburger joint-3 stars.
7. Prices: I would estimate 5-7 bucks per person including a drink.

I do return here but only for the double cheeseburger with grilled onions..YUM and the Gyros!

Note: If you are at Kaiser Lakeview the closest places for you to eat are across the street from Kaiser or this place which is down the street.

I happened upon Tom&apos;s Place after driving around lost for 45 minutes looking for this stupid Prometric testing center I had to go to for some continuing education for work. Starving, knowing I would be locked up for a few hours, Tom&apos;s Place was a very welcomed surprise.

I was going to order my usual #2 no tomato, but as I approached the door, I noticed 2 things: 1) The photo advertisements were very VERY LARGE- so large that they almost assaulted you with their full-color yumminess, and 2) The numerous strategically-placed ads for the breakfast burritos &quot;Best Breakfast Burritos in Town- TRY IT!&quot; ....&quot;TRY IT!&quot;... (..tryyyyyyy iiiittt......)&quot; were just too hard to ignore. So I did what they asked.

I was about 10:30 when I ordered- and that wasn&apos;t a problem, because apparently, Tom&apos;s place serves breakfast all day! Even thought the drink cup did say &quot;gourmet fast food&quot;, the prices are normal ghetto burger prices; the breakfast burrito was $4- something for the sausage and bacon combo.
I liked all of the questions the girl asked while building my burrito order- what kinds of meat, she went through all of the things that went inside, like salsa, tomatoes, onion, cheese? Yes yes, yes. Then she asked, &quot;Do you want potatoes inside the burrito?&quot; Why is that even a question? Duh. Don&apos;t call yourself a breakfast burrito if there&apos;s no taters in there, hon.

The end result was a served wrapped tightly in yellow paper and served in a cardboard box with a fork and knife with a cup of salsa. How did they know I was eating in my car? I think I love this place...

I got back over to the testing center and unwrapped my burrito-baby and it held up to the near-end (I&apos;m not a fan of forking and knifing certain foods- must be a Filipino thing). Salsa on the side wasn&apos;t impressive, but wasn&apos;t needed. The burrito itself was the perfect blend of meat, cheese, salsa, potatoes, potatoes, bacon, potatoes, cheese, egg, etc. yum! Not greasy, no weird seasonings. Best breakfast burrito I&apos;ve had in years!! That big-ass sign didn&apos;t mislead! Try it- Try it...
