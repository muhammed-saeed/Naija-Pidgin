Success Starts With A Strategy

The New Year is a great time to think about the changes we want to make in our lives. Being and staying well is a resolution many people make for the New Year. Making a resolution to change one thing that will make us healthier is a priceless gift that only we can give to ourselves. I am committed to helping you to achieve that goal. However, it will require you to make up your mind to charting your own action plan.

Sticking to your resolutions and making changes can be difficult but not impossible. Aim for success by employing these strategies. 

 Be Committed.  You must think through what you want to change and commit yourself to the long-term process it usually takes to achieve change. Then come up with a realistic plan to help you reach your goals. For example, if you want to shed some pounds, create a schedule that incorporates regular physical activity and eating a more balanced diet.  Try again. Everyone has made, and broken past resolutions, that does not mean that you won’t succeed this time. Start with a positive approach, including thinking about what has disrupted your good intentions in the past. Don’t discourage yourself with a negative outlook. Forgive yourself and get back on track.   Don’t make too many resolutions. Trying to eat better, exercise more, quit smoking, and reduce stress is too much to tackle at once. Start by picking one realistic, attainable goal within a reasonable time frame. Then strive to achieve another goal. Make a plan and monitor your progress. Plan what you’d like to accomplish in three or six months. Achieving small goals over time gives you a sense of accomplishment and motivation to keep going. Writing your goals down is a good way to keep track of your progress. A good approach is to evaluate yourself every week or two weeks. However, don’t over-monitor yourself by doing a self-assessment every day. That’s just likely to end in frustration. Don’t compare yourself to others. Accomplish your goal in a way that’s best suited to you. Involve friends and family. They can support your efforts, and can motivate you to keep going. Setting a personal goal is not a“promise”which can never be broken. Don’t paint yourself into a corner by overstating an unrealistic change you plan to make. Congratulate yourself. Reward yourself when your intermediate goals or resolutions are met preferably a non-food related award–a spa treatment, a day shopping, a makeover, or a relaxing day at the beach. 

The most important point to consider when deciding on your resolutions is to decide if you are truly willing to make the change in your life. Deciding to make the change just to have a resolution will not keep you motivated to attain your goal. Many people fail because they are afraid or don’t fully realize how the goal can benefit their every day lives. When you decide on your resolution, make a plan of action and list the ways it will improve your life. When you can see the prize, you are more likely to keep up the fight.

 Thought to Ponder: 

The people who succeed this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can’t find them, make them.”                                 George Bernard Shaw
