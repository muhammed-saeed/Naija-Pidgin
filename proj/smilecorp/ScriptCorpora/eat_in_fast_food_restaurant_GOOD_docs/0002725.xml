Food Fight! Mr. Chow Sues Philippe Chow Over SoBe Gansevoort Restaurant

When the uber-expensive Chinese eatery Philippe opened in the Gansevoort Hotel last year, most reviews ( including our own ) pointed to chef Philippe Chow&apos;s time as head chef at the acclaimed Mr. Chow&apos;s in New York as evidence of his pedigree.

 
 via miamism&apos;s flickr Philippe&apos;s kitchen 
 But wait! A lawsuit filed in Miami&apos;s federal court this week by Mr. Chow&apos;s owner says that Philippe Chow made it all up. In fact, the suit says Philippe is a trademark-stealing, name-changing experience-exaggerating fraud.

Michael Chow says that Philippe Chow&apos;s real name is Chak Yam Chau, and that he started out in Mr. Chow&apos;s New York kitchen in 1980 as &quot;a lowest level kitchen assistant.&quot; Here&apos;s the full allegation as to his lacking skillz:

 Prior to that time, he had absolutely no kitchen experience, whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere. During his 25 years with the Mr. Chow Restaurants, Chau was a chopping assistant, a chopper, an assistant chopper-expeditor and ultimately, for the three years before his resignation, leading expeditor. He never rose to the position of executive chef, as he falsely claims.

 According to Chow&apos;s lawsuit, Chak Yam Chau only changed his name to Philippe Chow after meeting with Stratis Morfogen, a South Florida businessman who wanted to get into the upscale Chinese restaurant game.

The suit says that Morfogen and Chau &quot;misappropriated&quot; Mr. Chow&apos;s recipes for their first restaurant, the original Philippe in New York&apos;s Meatpacking District.

And when the pair opened a second restaurant in South Beach, Chow says it was no coincidence that they chose the Gansevoort -- just a few blocks from the new W Hotel, where Mr. Chow plans to open a new restaurant.

In case you haven&apos;t caught the gist of Michael Chow&apos;s feelings toward Philippe Chow, he summarizes:

 Defendant Chau was never a food chef and only very occasionally actually cooked any of the food at Mr. Chow Restaurants.
 
 
The lawsuit accuses the pair of exploiting the similarity in names between Philippe Chow and Michael Chow, going so far as to purchase weblinks on Google, Yahoo and TMZ so that searches for &quot;Mr. Chow&quot; directed readers to philippechow.com.

Philippe Chow also told staff at the Gansevoort to tell interested patrons that the restaurant is associated with the Mr. Chow franchise and that Philippe Chow &quot;was the chef behind the Mr. Chow restaurants,&quot; according to the suit.

Reached on his cell phone, Stratis Morfogen says that the company&apos;s publicist will respond to the suit later this afternoon. We&apos;ll post their response as soon as we get it.

 
 Update: Morfogen and Chow&apos;s publicist just emailed a statement. Here it is: 
 Philippe Chow, Chef/owner of Philippe restaurants, would like to confirm that he did in fact change his name from Chak Yam Chau to the more westernized Philippe Chow, when he arrived here from Hong Kong in 1977. From that point on, everyone in his life, including family, friends, employers and even the US government have known him as Philippe Chow. Many people, including Michael Chow, who was born Zhōu Yinghua, change their given Chinese names to make them more familiar to the English speaking population. 

 Since opening his own successful restaurants over 4 years ago, Chef Philippe Chow has gone out of his way to make it known that he is in no way related to restaurateur and art collector Michael Chow. &quot;I specifically chose to name my restaurant Philippe to alleviate any confusion with Mr. Chow. I have nothing but respect for Michael Chow, and the fact that we have the same last name is pure coincidence,&quot; says Philippe Chow.

 While there are Philippe and Mr. Chow outposts in several of the same cities, there is clearly enough demand for high-end Chinese cuisine to keep both restaurants busy. Chef Philippe Chow has created his own niche and his loyal following has been the reason for the success of his five Philippe restaurants.

Morfogen is scum. They will loose their lawsuit n all their money. It couldnt of happened 2 a nicer dirtbag.
 
Who came first is not important. Each restaurant has it&apos;s own unique name, with&quot;Chow&quot;as coincidence.

In the end, we all have different tastes and dislikes. We should just let the public go to the restaurants that they like and forget the rhetoric.

Though the lawsuit may be a matter of public record, it is ultimately a battle between two private parties, over an apparently personal grudge - and should be a deciding factor between which eatery to dine at.

Yes, customers need to maintain a professional attitude too.&gt;&gt;S&lt;&lt;
 
Philippe Chow is FAR superior to that or Mr. Chow...

Look who opened in Miami first... I doubt that is a coincidence
 
I ate at both restaurant and they are both really good. I personally like Philippes better because it seemed more intimate to me. The service is excellent at both places. Who cares where celebrities go and as far as comparing them to authentics bags, its like comparing Louis Vuitton to Chanel. At the end of the day, they are both great designers. The chicken satay is the best, so enjoy!
 
Hello, great blog, I truly enjoyed reading it. the post gave me the momentum to attempt my own blog, please check out my blog by clicking my name at the top of this post, Many thanks
 
Both places suck as far as I&apos;m concerned. At Philippe&apos;s the food was not bad, but service always horrible. After having gone there three times, four of us walked away on the last one before the appetizers rolled (and they had the nerve to ask us money for the sparkling water brought to the table). According to public records, we were not only ones to walk away. Chaka Yam Chau tried to walk away from paying his fish wholesaler Port Royale Trading Co. , Inc. (Port Royal Seafood)-(305) 406-2662, but Port Royale sued CYC and won judgment for $34,000.

The Gansevoort Hotel just filed for BK weeks ago, which I&apos;m sure will not help the already most times empty Chak Yam Chau&apos;s (to go please) place.

AT Mr. Michael Chow&apos;s, we had reservations through Opentable, when we arrived and the wannabe model/porno actress d&apos;jour asked me my name without even looking at my face. When I gave her my name. she asked at what time was our reservation, (again without making contact). By then I&apos;m walking to the table ready to leave, but figured everyone deserves a second change, they tried to sit us on a table where I would not even sit any of my own maids and you could not pass by in between the space with the other table (I&apos;m 175 pounds, not obese), when I asked for a bigger table the&quot;ma�e d&apos;h�&quot;gave me the looks (another wannabe) and went he walked us to the bigger table we kept going out to the door to never come back.

So, I think that instead of asking:&quot;Will the real Mr. Chow stand up&quot;. We should ask Chow-Chow to take their petty fight to another state/country and leave Miami! Please? Me no love you, long time...We have enough circus and embarrassing&quot;celebrities&quot;and the likes, as it is.
 
Phillipe is the most overrated, overpriced restaurant in existence.
 
Philippe is all hype, I went there and it is nothing special, the service was not that great and it seemed to be more interested in seating and taking care of celebrities then running a restaurant. Don&apos;t read everything you read, seems like just publicity stunts, philippe&apos;s Miami location was pretty empty the couple of times I went, I&apos;m suprised it&apos;s still open. Mr. Chow is the original and the idea is obviously stolen.
 
I agree with Frod wholeheartedly. And let the public decide if the food is good. They will fail if it isn&apos;t. If you ask me,there aren&apos;t enough good Chinese restaurants in this city. bring it on! 
For those who are on Mr. Chow no. 1&apos;s side, you have a reporter in your camp here: http://networkedblogs.com/p7269175
 
first off..... the only authentic chow is mr. chows (as in michael) .... and if the miami public wants to be defrauded and forced to pay $$$ for chinese food - it&apos;s obvious this happens because it is miami. competition between 2 high-end chinese restaurants has to be the lo-point of miami&apos;s culinary repertoire considering that it would cost anywhere else half as much of what it would here. it seems tragic that restaurateurs are not interested if making food with soul and only focus on the soul-less-ness of miami. good luck to both chows, just count me out.

Isn&apos;t there enough room in Miami Beach for two glitzy, overpriced, uninspired Chinese restaurants?
 
Phillippe Chow is and always will be second best to the original. He has done the all american un original thing and taken someone else&apos;s ideas and re-marketed them as new and improved where in fact the food is second rate at best and maybe its success has to do with the fact that it lacks the exclusivity and class that Mr. CHows has offered its high profile patrons for years. 

This is America and there is a market for everything and everyone. While a Louis Vuitton bag from Canal Street may look and feel like the real thing, a fake is a fake, and while you may save money by buying the copy the integrity of the brand is compromised and the so is the integrity of the consumer. So for those that support Philippe Chow, I salute you, because with out those that support the second rate, the copies of the world, the burning of un purchased music, who knows where the economy would be as not everyone would be able to&quot;enjoy&quot;it all as it costs money. 

As far as quality, originality, and prestige go, well it goes unsaid that it belongs to those with original thought to create something that the test of time has not destroyed.

At the end of the day, Phillippe Chow will never be what the original is. It lacks the creativity and the standard that Mr. Chow preserves. Phillippe Chow will end up being another chain of Chinese Restaurants with a cooler name, and if Im correct the chain has begun as it has a take out spot somewhere in downtown NY.

But hey don&apos;t they say that imitation is the best form of flattery?
 
Petulant Children! All the pedigrees in the world, it is still dog meat when the mystery meat is dog. The bottom line in any restaurant is the talent of the chef and not a written recipe. Sun Hao! Is not the world of fine eating my oyster? Two cooks can take the same recipe and one will taste better than the other. 

Talent will always rule. Let the best chef win and the other go out of business. When Mari Taki took me to China Town in Chicago, she went to half a dozen Chinese restaurants hunting a particular chef whose talents were superlative. 

The owners of the different places kept raising their offers and the talented cook, always in demand, moved around a lot. The patrons also moved around a lot shedding money in the lucky restaurant. Customers liked his cooking and followed him. But one thing did not change. It was fine eating. He had this ability to take simple things and bring out a voice of flavor. 

Petulant children, stop fighting and cook! Anger takes the love out of the pot. Do you wish Master Kuan to send patrons somewhere else no matter how much joss you burn? Be Chinese and stop this waste. Wu wei Wu!(Do without doing!)

its funny that the success of philippe is what caused this lawsuit! where was mr chow for the past 4 years??? he obviously see&apos;s that philippe is growing to a very successful business and his jealousy provokes this lawsuit! not to mention that most of mr chows regular customers prefer philippe over mr chows
