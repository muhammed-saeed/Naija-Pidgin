 Eating at a Restaurant ,
Preparing Lunch for Guests, Using Newspapers , and Planting a Windowsill Garden 
 
Thematic Unit on Going to a Restaurant 

Rationale: Students with mild intellectual disabilities need to function as
independently as possible. One aspect of independence is being a skilled consumer. A
skilled consumer is able to effectively use a restaurant. To do this, a person makes
decisions, interacts with peers and restaurant staff, and uses money.
 
Student Characteristics: The class consists of students classified as mildly
intellectually disabled. The students range in age from 11-14 years. The average reading
level is third grade. The students know the value of money, bills and coins, and have some
are able to make change. They have some table manners but lack some social skills. The
students have difficulty dealing with glitches or problems.
 
Curriculum Area: Skilled Consumer 

Goal: The student will eat in a sit-down restaurant.
Conditions:
Location: local sit-down restaurant
Time: lunch, dinner
Tools and Materials: money, menu, price chart

Post Test: The students will take three separate trips to restaurants: one to a
fast-food restaurant, one to a cafeteria-style restaurant and one to a sit-down
restaurant. Each will bring an appropriate, teacher-assigned amount of money to each
restaurant and independently choose, obtain and pay for meal. Teacher will keep track of
student success on checklist.
 
Age Modifications: No age modifications are necessary to adapt these goals for an
older student. Some higher accuracy expectations may be appropriate for math and
vocabulary skills, specifically in the area of giving and receiving change for payment.
Some modifications for younger students would include reducing the number of vocabulary
words that the student is expected to master. The younger student would add money amounts
up to and including $10 with 70% accuracy. See Sample IEP goals for examples of similar
goals across age groups.
 
Resources, Vocabulary and Materials: 

Resources for this project were largely limited to our creative thinking, past
knowledge of teaching, publishing and word-processing software and a sample menu from a
popular chain bar/grill that we modified.

Materials include the Chilly Fridays menu made for student use and a few related
worksheets and checklists. Outside the ten lesson plans, access to similar menus
replicating other types of restaurants would also be useful. Checklists can be created in
whatever form a teacher finds most efficient for keeping the required data.

payingand be able to give brief description of each with 100 percent accuracy.
 
Procedure:
 Review difference between a sit-down and a fast-food restaurant 

 remind students that there are different kinds of restaurants and two of these are fast
 food and sit-down. ask or remind we have been talking for several days about sit-down restaurants ask students to give differences between the two types of restaurants 

 Begin discussion with related leading questions 

 A. Who went to sit-down restaurant recently? B. What restaurant did you go to? 

C. What kinds of things happen in a sit-down restaurant?
 List as many things that students mention on the board. Add ideas the students dont mention which fit main objectives 

 Introduce Objective with statement explaining such as&quot;There is a certain order
 that we follow and that people who work in a restaurant follow when we go to a sit-down
 restaurant. All of the things you told me happen in a restaurant are part of this
 order.&quot; 

 Ask students which things on the list they made happen first, second, etc. Explain that each of the small things that students listed belongs to a larger or
 general category or group and that they fit into one of the 5 main listed on the poster or
 paper (see materials). Help students assign each item on board to a category on poster board (teacher can also
 use dry-erase or chalk board and write the main categories up separately. Talk through each major step, telling students what might happen in each. Be sure to
 anticipate exceptional steps like the possibility that the restaurant is&quot;seat
 yourself&quot;or&quot;wait to be seated,&quot;and explain the host/ess may ask&quot;How many?&quot;and this means&quot;How many people will be sitting at the
 table?&quot; 

 Behavioral aspectonce list is established, hand out restaurant social skills cards
 listed below. 

 Go through each main category (steps of going to restaurant) and ask students to talk
 about things that they or the waitstaff say, how they act toward each other 
 
.B. Ask how they might use each of the three skills on cards at that time. Ask students
 to give an example of how they would order a dish, ask for more water, etc. Social skills
 should focus on:

 non-smoking?&quot;answer:&quot;Non-smoking, please&quot; 


 Ask each student to review the list of major steps of going to a restaurant and tell
 them that tomorrow they will get to practice using the skills. 
 
Materials: Chalk board and chalk, poster or piece of paper with 5 steps of going to
a sit-down restaurant written largely on it, Chilly Fridays menus for each child,
restaurant social skills cards.

Lesson 8: Role-play Visiting a Sit-down Restaurant

Objective: The student will, with necessary prompts, role-play the five steps of
visiting a restaurant discussed in previous lesson and receive feedback about their
role-play
 
Procedure:
 set up room area with two tables and a sign which indicates&quot;SEAT YOURSELF&quot;or&quot;PLEASE WAIT TO BE SEATED&quot; Review last lesson by asking students to tell what you did. Be sure that order of five
 main steps of going to a sit-down restaurant and three restaurant social skills are
 review. explain that each student will have a chance to go to the&quot;restaurant&quot;and
 practice the five main steps and the social skills they learned. hand out peer evaluation form 

 explain that each of the students watching a student practice will use this form to make
 sure the person is using the right steps. Tell them to put a check next to each step the
 student does perfectly and to circle any step that the student needs work on. Explain that
 these instructions are on the sheet. Explain to students that they will each receive feedback from the group and should
 accept it by listening carefully and not arguing. 

 Allow a students to come up and role-play the process of going to a restaurant, from
 entering to leaving and paying. Provide a play money twenty-dollar bill and explain that
 when they pay they will just use it, because we are focusing on social skills and not
 paying today. As each student comes up, remind her/him to check the sign to see how they
 will be seated. Help students to give role-play student feedback by following peer evaluation form, then
 return to step E with another student 
 
Materials: Sign which can be turned to say&quot;SEAT YOURSELF&quot;or&quot;PLEASE WAIT TO BE SEATED&quot;, two small tables with two chairs each (could simply
be two school desks facing each other), Chilly Fridays menus, peer evaluation forms.
 
Evaluation: Each student who participates in the role play and receives feedback
from peers and teacher has met todays objective.

(Additional information about this student s goals and objectives follows several of
the lessons).

  

Lesson #1

Goal: Students will follow a recipe.

Objectives:

--Students, with verbal assistance only, will measure out ingredients using measuring
cups (i.e. 1 cup, 1/2 cup, 1/3 cup, 1/4 cup). They will do this with 80% accuracy on three
trials.

--Students, with verbal assistance only, will measure out ingredients using measuring
spoons (i.e. 1 Tablespoon, 1/2 Tablespoon, 1 teaspoon, 1/2 teaspoon, 1/3 teaspoon, 1/4
teaspoon, 1/6 teaspoon, 1/8 teaspoon) with no more than two errors for the 8 measurements.

--Students will work cooperatively in groups of 2, with no more than one reminder, 100%
of the time.

QCC Objectives: Math - 11,12,13. Health 2-18.

Student Demographics: This lesson would be for students operating on a third/fourth
grade level, regardless of age.

Adaptations: For students in level K-2, students would explore with the measuring
utensils, measuring a number of different substances; like sand, and sugar. We would
discuss concepts of more than and less than.

Prerequisites needed: Students would have already had the opportunity to explore and
practice using measuring cups and measuring spoons in the math measuring center, measuring
a variety of materials such as water, sand, rice salt, etc.

Materials:

One set of measuring cups per pair of students.
One set of measuring spoons per pair of students.
One chart showing graduated sizes of measuring cups and measuring spoons.
One chart showing recipe.
One cooking magazine or section of magazine per student.
One bowl per pair of students.

flour, water, baking soda, sugar, oil, baking powder, salt, and pepper.

Method:

--Pair off students.

--Remind students of what they have been practicing in the measurement center this
week. Ask them where do they use this skill? (In cooking.) Ask students why is it
important to measure out each ingredient correctly, according to the recipe? (Because the
dish will not taste right or it will not turn out if the amounts are incorrect.)

--Using the chart, we will review the different measuring cup sizes. Students will line
up their measuring cups in a row to match the chart. I will ask different students to
identify different amounts (i.e. Which of those cups is 1/2 cup? One cup? 1/3 cup). Repeat
procedure with measuring spoons.

--Using a second chart, I will assist students in reading the recipe. Working together
in their groups, students will follow along measuring out the instructed amounts.

--I will give each group a section of a cooking magazine and ask them to look through
their section until they find a recipe that interests them. Using the recipe and a second
bowl, they are to measure out the ingredients called for. I will float checking for
understanding by having each group demonstrate some of what they are doing, and giving
needed assistance. I will check off degree of mastery and note any problems.

--Upon completion, students will clear their own area. We will then discuss the
activity and students will self assess themselves. How many students, by a show of hands,
followed the recipe directions. How did you do? Did you encounter any problems: What were
they: How did you solve them: Assess yourself on how well you did: 1 - I understand how to
measure without any problems: 2 - I think I understand how to measure, but I need more
practice; or 3 - Im not sure I understand yet I need more help.

Evaluation:

1. Working cooperatively will be scored by teacher observation and data collection:

Did student take turns? 1________1________1

None of Some of All of

the time the time the time

Did student actively participate in group? 1________1________1

None of Some of All of

the time the time the time

Did student allow for free exchange of ideas? 1________1________1

None of Some of All of

2. Measuring with cups and spoons; data collection.

Students were able to correctly identify and measure:

__One cup __One Tablespoon __1/6 teaspoon

__3/4 cup __1/2 Tablespoon __1/8 teaspoon

__2/3 cup __1 teaspoon

__1/2 cup __1/2 teaspoon

__1/4 cup __1/4 teaspoon

Lesson #2

Goal: Students will sit at a table for a snack/meal using socially acceptable table
manners.

Objectives:

-- Student will each ask for what he/she wants ending requests with the word
please. Students will do this 4 out of 5 times with no visual or verbal prompts
necessary.

-- When students receive requested items, students will respond to the giver by saying
thank you.

-- During snack, student will swallow the food in his/her mouth before speaking, on 4
of 5 attempts with no more than 1 verbal prompt.

-- Student will wipe his/her face and hands with napkins needed. This will be done with
100% accuracy, needing no more than 2 verbal prompts.

Prerequisites: No prerequisites are needed as this is an introductory lesson.

Student demographics: This lesson is designed for a special needs kindergarten.

Adaptations: Students with limited or no language, will sign or use augmentation
boards. For some students visual prompts may be necessary. Students with CP. may receive
physical help as needed. Students functioning at higher levels would use the Book of
Manners . We would role play appropriate manners and each student would elaborate on
one behavior/manner. They would color appropriate signs and post as a reminder.

Method:

-- Have students sit at the small group table. Tell them that they are going to listen
to a very unusual book. Remind them to listen carefully because when we finish we are
going to talk about it.

-- Present the book Ask the students to predict what they think the book might be
about.

-- Read the book aloud to the class. Periodically check for comprehension with oral
questions.

-- Upon completion discuss what Thingumajigs do and whether their actions show good
manners. Use picture cards to contrast wrong and right manners.

-- Explain to students that we are having snacks and we are going to practice using a
napkin, swallowing before we speak and using please and thank you.

Evaluation: Evaluation shall be a check sheet containing all of the lessons
objectives. Students shall be scored individually as to mastery. 0 = student did not
attempt task. 1 = student demonstrated skill sometimes. 2 = student demonstrated skill
most of the time with no more than one mistake. 3 = student performed skills independently
and consistently.

Lesson # 3 The Food Pyramid (introductory lesson, 2nd grade level)

Goal: Students will be able to identify foods in each major food group.

Objectives:

-- Using a food pyramid the students will classify foods into the five major food
groups with 80% accuracy.

-- The students will read names of three foods from each of the five food groups with
80% accuracy.

Prerequisites:

Prior knowledge of many food vocabulary words.

Prior experience using a food journal.

Experience using spelling word study steps: look at word, read it, spell it, close eyes
and spell it again, look and check, repeat steps as needed.

Food Pyramid Activity Center

Materials:

1. Read aloud book, Bread, Bread, Bread by Ann Morris

2. Large food pyramid

3. Empty food containers

4. Vocabulary cards

5. Real foods: yogurt, nuts, lettuce, apples, pita bread

6. Food journals

Procedures:

-- Introduce read aloud book using a riddle: What has a crust, is soft inside, and
people all over the world eat it? Add more clues if necessary. After student guesses
correctly, say: Yes, today we are going to read a book called Bread, Bread, Bread! Have a brainstorming discussion tapping students background information. Then ask a
student to find the round, flat bread in the book. It is called pita bread. Next the
students will locate breads on the food pyramid.

-- Explain the importance of eating a variety of foods because they give us energy,
help us grow, and support good health. The five major food groups will be discussed
starting at the bottom of the pyramid and working upward. Tap students prior knowledge
about foods and record on chart paper.

-- Working with a partner the students will classify food picture cards into five
categories, using the pyramid chart for self correction.

-- The students will read food vocabulary word cards with a teacher and demonstrate
steps for word study in preparation for an end of the week spelling test.

--End the lesson with a food tasting party. After clean up have students identify foods
tasted on the food pyramid.

-- Students will write a sentence about a food that they tasted, then read the sentence
to the class.

Evaluation:

(The students have a basic concept of time, including an understanding of the words
yesterday, today, and tomorrow.)

The students will receive a food journal sheet for recording foods eaten yesterday for
lunch. Each child will point to the food group the foods are in.

Post test:

Allow students to evaluate what they ate for lunch today, asking themselves the
following questions:

!. Did you make healthy choices? Yes, No, explain your answer.

2. Did you select a variety of foods? Yes, No, List the foods.

3. Can you find the kinds of foods you ate on the pyramid?

 
Age Modifications:

Younger students can match real or plastic foods to pictures on the food pyramid chart.
They can make a food group picture book.. Extension activities might include:

1. Identifying the beginning letter/sound of foods. Write the letter or trace it from a
model.

2. Play food categorizing game on the apple computer.

Older students can match food picture cards with word cards, and make a food group
book, writing a sentence or short paragraph on each page. Extension activities might be:

1. A research project on food, using Internet resources.

2. Put foods in food groups, then list them in alphabetical order and read.

3. Read the bread book to a younger student.

Lesson #6

Goal: Students will plan trip on MARTA bus.

Objectives:

--Given the words school bus, MARTA bus, and bus stop, will print the correct phrase
legibly under the picture of each item in each of five trials.

--When shown pictures of a MARTA bus and a school bus and asked which requires money
students will point to MARTA bus in one hundred per cent of trials.

--Given coins and asked how much money is needed to ride MARTA bus, student will count
out $1.50 in one hundred per cent of the trials.

Adaptations:

--Students may match communication symbols or printed words to each picture, rather
than copying phrase.

--If necessary, coins given may be limited to quarters, or student may be permitted to
select bus token from assorted coins

Prerequisites: Students have ability to discriminate and sort coins. They have
experience using calendars to plan future events. They have the ability to copy simple
phrases or to choose symbols to represent ideas.

QCC Objectives: Math 1 - 13, 14; Language Arts K - 8, 1 - 13, 2 - 7.

Materials:

Pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, MARTA tokens, sorting chart, MARTA bus, picture
symbol of MARTA bus, school bus, picture symbol of school bus, bus stop marker, symbol of
bus stop, permission slip, calendar, symbols for day, destination , yes, and no.

Method:

--Teacher announces future trip on MARTA bus and marks date on calendar with picture
symbol of MARTA bus which also contains words MARTA bus. Teacher asks Who wants to
go? Those who indicate yes are given permission slips.

--Students who have necessary writing skills will fill in own name and copy day, date,
destination, and method of transportation on permission slip as illustrated on overhead
projector. Other students will glue corresponding symbols at top of permission slip and
writing will be done by teacher. These students will also glue both a yes and a no symbol
at the bottom, so parent can indicate whether she is giving permission.

--Teacher announces that we are going outside to look for a MARTA bus. Teacher leads
class in a direction so that they will pass a parked school bus.

--Group pauses at school bus. Showing symbols for both a school bus and a MARTA bus,
teacher asks which this is. Using repetitive questioning, teacher guides group to state
that this is a school bus, not a MARTA bus. School busses are yellow. No money is needed
to ride a school bus.

--Group proceeds to bus stop. Teacher points out bus stop post, guides the students
to read the post and match it to the symbol. Students will state that money is needed to
ride. Some students will spell bus, stop, and MARTA.

--Teacher presents MARTA token, and guides students to identify as money, for use on
MARTA bus, and not needed for school bus.

--Group waits and watches for MARTA bus. When bus arrives students identify as MARTA
bus and indicate token needed to ride.

--Group returns inside. Guided as needed by teacher or aid, students choose MARTA coin
from other possible coins to show fare needed to ride. Students with more advanced skills
count out six quarters, or work out other combinations of coins adding up to $1.50.

--Students who are working at coin combinations totaling $1.50 will take turns buying
tokens from one another using as many different coin combinations as they can think of.

--Students who are identifying MARTA coins will independently sort pennies, nickels,
dimes, quarters, and tokens on sorting chart marked with symbols for the coins and tokens.

 Evaluation: Teacher observation. Teacher will count number of coins correctly
sorted or number of correct coin combinations made by child.


Lesson # 7

Goal: Students will be able to shop in a grocery store.

Objectives:

-- Shown pictures of the interior aisles of a grocery store and food cards, students
will match the food cards to the appropriate location in a store, with 100% accuracy in
two out of three trials.

-- Using a calculator, students will total the prices of a list of groceries with 100%
accuracy.

QCC Objectives: Math- 11,13; Health - 14; Science 1 -1.

Prerequisites needed:

Prior knowledge of calculator use.

Prior discussions of grocery stores, including use of, locating items, and paying for
products.

Purpose:

This lesson is a follow-up review of where to locate foods in a store by their food
group classifications. It is also a follow up on paying for purchases.

Materials:

1. Numbered photographs of food aisles.

2. Food items

3. Grocery Store Game

4. Calculators

Method:

-- I will begin by reviewing that we have been studying the steps in preparing a meal
including shopping for food. Today we are going to play a game at the end of Health class.
In order to play the game we need to review some steps of grocery shopping.

-- I will put out various store aisles and arrange them in an order similar to what
they will find in the actual store we will be using. I will ask students to look at the
photographs and volunteer to tell me what they notice about which foods are on which
aisle. We will talk about the fact that products are grouped three ways: non food items
are grouped according to purpose (Books and Magazines, Cleaning supplies, Cooking
utensils, Cosmetics, Health and Beauty, Office supplies, Paper goods, School Supplies);
food items are grouped according to their a. common food group and b. storage requirements
(do they need refrigeration, or freezing?). I will show them an object and model finding
he correct aisle in which it belongs. Students will each be given two items and place them
in the correct category.

-- I will remind students that we must pay for any groceries which we purchase. How do
we know how much each product costs: I will point out that prices are usually either on
the item itself or on the shelf just below the item. Produce prices are usually posted
just above the item. What can we use to add together the amounts of the items we are
buying. (Accept all reasonable answers). Remind students that one way to add up the items
is to use the calculator.

-- Review the steps of adding dollars and cents using a calculator.

-- Introduce the Grocery Store game. Explain to students that the object of this game
is to complete our shopping list and get to the cash register to pay the cashier. In order
to do that you must locate each of the items in the store and keep a running total of the
purchases on your calculators. Check for understanding. Each player receives a calculator
and an equal number of food cards face down. Students are instructed not to turn over
their cards. Explain that the foods they will be looking for are the actual ingredients of
the lunch we will be preparing next week. Each list is different; but combined together,
they makeup our menu. Explain the rules of the game:

(1). Each player spins. The highest number goes first.

(2). The player turns over his/her top card and searches the game board for the correct
aisle. He/she identifies the aisle where the item is found. If the player is incorrect,
He/she turns the card back over, puts it on the bottom of the deck, and waits for the next
turn. If the player is correct, he/she spins the spinner and moves that number of spaces.
If the turns are taking too long a time limit can be instituted. At the end of the move,
the player will enter the amount of the item in the calculator.

(3). Play continues until one player reaches the cash register. At that time the player
will announce how much he/she will pay for his/her groceries.

(4). Time permitting, play will continue with remaining players; otherwise each player
will tell what they have spent thus far.

-- At the conclusion of the game ask students to take turns recalling how to locate
different items in the store. What are the things you need to know: (What group do they
belong in. Do they need refrigeration, etc.) What problems did they encounter in the game
locating the items: Explain to the students that we will be practicing this skill by
setting up a pretend store and by going to a real grocery store.

Adaptations: This lesson plan was setup for students on a third grade level; however,
it would be appropriate to use, without modification for students on a first and second
grade level who had prior knowledge of using a calculator. If the group had not had
previous experience with a calculator, the game could be played without calculators,
simply by finding the right location and spinning.


Lesson #8

Goal: To ride MARTA to food store and purchase items on list.

 Objectives:

-- Given a supply of assorted coins, students will purchase MARTA token by handing
correct amount of money to seller and accepting token.

-- When taken near-by and shown picture symbol of bus stop marker, student will
indicate he has located bus stop by pointing to it in two locations.

--Given a bus token, student will board bus and drop fare in box, with no more than one
prompt, in each of two tries.

--Students will demonstrate appropriate bus riding behavior with no more than two
prompts on each of two ten minute bus rides.

--Working as a group, student will locate and place in cart 80% of food items on
shopping list.

--Student will make purchase by placing items on counter, handing money to clerk,
accepting change, safely storing change, accepting bag, and saying thank you, with no more
than two prompts.

Adaptations: Teacher may count money with student, or may provide student with only
quarters to count. Teacher may guide group to specific area of the store where items will

-- Using vocabulary cards and pictures students will classify foods into two groups:
foods to eat daily, and foods to eat once in a while, with 100% accuracy.

-- The students will categorize foods in the five food groups with 100% accuracy.

-- The students will write a paragraph about our luncheon, using complete sentences
with 80% accuracy .

Food Pyramid Activity Center

Materials:

1. Read aloud book, The Victory Garden Alphabet Book by Jerry Pallotta.

2. Pictures of foods, including sweets and fatty foods.

3. Food pyramid.

4. Eat right! activity sheet.

Procedures:

-- Each student will put pictures of foods and matching word cards into two categories:
foods to eat daily and foods to eat once in a while. Then they will explain why.

-- Working with a partner students will place food vocabulary cards under the correct
food group picture.

-- Students will work in pairs and quiz each other on food vocabulary words in
preparation for a spelling test.

-- The students will write, revise, edit, and print a copy of their paragraph using a
computer. Students will read the paragraph to the class.

Evaluation:

1. Make a large KWL chart and have a class discussion. Begin by asking the students
what they know about food. Complete the three categories with student responses (what we
know, what we want to know more about, and what we still need to learn).

Post tests:

1. Spelling test. The students will spell ten food vocabulary words with 80% accuracy.

2. Each student will get an eat right activity sheet. They will fill in the food
pyramid with foods they ate in one day and then write the answers to he following
questions:

Do you think you are eating right? yes or no

If not, what can you do to change the foods you eat?

Answers will be shared in a group setting.

3. Students will write a paragraph with ten complete sentences, using correct
punctuation, capitalization, and spelling, with 80% accuracy.

Age Modifications:

Younger students will write complete sentences about foods we should eat every day and
about the foods we should avoid. They cold read The Hungry Caterpillar and then
share the list of foods he ate that are good to eat daily, and which ones we should not
eat very often. Students cold have a spelling practice period and quiz on three letter
words such as: cut, mix fat, nut, and egg. They would be expected to score at least 80% on
the quiz. An extension activity would be to create a food alphabet book and read it to the
class.

Older students could read the nutrition facts on labels on empty food containers, and
then evaluate the percentages of fat and sugar, in comparison with other ingredients. They
could also read and compare newspaper food ads. Extension activities might include writing
poems about favorite foods and organizing a team to lead the planning and development of a
classroom window sill garden.

 The Newspaper as a Resource for Teaching Students 

 Rationale: 
The newspaper can help make subjects such as social studies, science and mathematics come
to life by relating them to studentseveryday lives. It is a proven way to motivate
students and stimulate their thinking. For many students, such experiences can be the&quot;missing link&quot;to understanding. The newspaper is an innovative resource for
bringing a fresh new perspective to your studentslearning process.
 
Aim:
 The student with MID will be able to independently use the newspaper as a
resource in their daily lives. Using the newspaper affords the MID student an opportunity
to participate in a normalizing activity. Reading the newspaper gives the MID student a
sense of doing something that is&quot;grownup.&quot; 

Characteristics of students:
 Students will be in the 4 th grade reading on a variety of levels. They will
be functioning below grade level in math. The disabilities will include MID, SLD, EBD, and
others. The setting will be a resource classroom with a total of eight students. 

Curriculum area: 
Science, Math, and Language Arts will be the curriculum areas used for instruction. The
students will be able to take useful information from the newspaper and use it in daily
living. Conditions: location- at home and at school, time - when the student
chooses to read the newspaper, tools and materials - the newspaper.
 
Description of the Behavior Pattern: 
The student will have a newspaper delivered to them at school once a week. The students
will respond to the teachers instruction for assignments and activities in order to reach
the planned curriculum goals. The students should already know how to read up to the third
grade level. They should be able to do 2 digit addition and subtraction. The students will
also need to know the 4 seasons. They will be learning how to use decimals in 2 and 3
digit operations. The students will be reading for the main idea and recalling information
from the newspaper. The students will recall information in sequential order. The student
will read the newspaper and comprehend the stories written.
 
Modifications: 
The teacher will make modifications for the students that cannot independently read the
newspaper. The teacher will orally read all sections that require reading. Peer tutoring
will be utilized to assist students who are having a difficult time. Also, extended time
will be given if needed for students who may need it.
 
Functional Objectives:
 The students will be able to interpret daily weather forecasts. This includes using
the weather map in the daily newspaper. The students will also be able to use the
newspaper to shop wisely. The students will also be able to use a newspaper article to
determine the 5 Ws and the main idea of a feature article. 

QCC Objectives: 
 Science 1 st grade-- #15 Makes observations about weather. Records
daily weather observations and changes as they relate to seasonal variations.
 
Math 3 rd grade --#48 Adds and subtracts whole numbers (one-two-and
three-digits, without or with regrouping), initially using manipulative and then
connecting the manipulations to symbolic procedures (problems presented vertically and
horizontally with the horizontal problems rewritten vertically).
 
Language Art 3 rd grade -- #14 Increases vocabulary to reflect a
growing range of interests and knowledge. #25 Recognizes EXPLICIT main idea, details,
sequence of events, and cause-effect relationships in fiction and nonfiction.
