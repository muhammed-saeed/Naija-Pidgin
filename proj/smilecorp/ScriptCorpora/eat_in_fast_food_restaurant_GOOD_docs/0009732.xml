Introduce myself
Ph.D. this summer in Astronomy and Astrophysics
from Penn State Aug 9.
T.A. for Lab sections 2, 3, 6 is Cody Landis (Engineering Physics
 Senior). Cody will grade labs for Lab sections 2, 3, 6 and grade
 homeworks for the Harlow lecture section.


 



Introduce course web site on computer
NOTE: Section 2 does not conflict with Genetics. There is a section
from 9:30-10:40 AM taught by Alward, if you would rather take that, I
know there is space and the Physics secretary (Olson 101) would be
happy to help you with the paperwork to transfer.
discuss syllabus.
discuss textbook. DOUBLE READING ASSIGNMENT FOR NEXT CLASS: ALL of
chapter 1, plus sections 2.1 and 2.2 of Chapter 2. Please try to get
the first Study Guide (Study Guide 1) done by Friday. The Study
Guides are NOT graded, but you should complete them anyway.
NOTE - two sets of Study Guide Answers in Library. They can be
checked out for up to 2 hours for photocopying. Please do not use the
answers as a crutch! Attempt the problems yourself first, write down
your answers carefully (good practice for the Exam), and THEN look at
the answers.
Exams will include WRITTEN ANSWER questions, in which you must show
your work.


 



This course: Mechanics. That means how things move.
Description of motion: Displacement,
Velocity, Acceleration.
Why do things move? Forces: Gravity, Friction, Surface-to-surface
(push), Tension in ropes (pull).
- How does a human arm lift?
- what is the best way to pry out a tooth?
- What does ``blood pressure&apos;&apos; mean?
- How do the wheels make your car go? What&apos;s the best way to drive
over ice?


 



1.2 - The Metric System
AKA ``S.I. Units&apos;&apos; advantage: All derived units are factors of 10.
stands for ``Systeme International&apos;&apos;
Dimensions: like Length, Time, Mass, Volume (actually Length )
So some dimensions are combinations of several simpler dimensions.
Units: a particular amount of some dimension, used in specifying
things (ie meter, second, kilogram, liter)
Length (there are 3 perpendicular length dimensions, that&apos;s
why we say the Universe we live in is ``3-D&apos;&apos;)

 Dimension S.I. Unit other metric other Length meter (m) cm, km foor, inch, mile Mass kilogram (kg) g ?? - not pounds! Time second hour, day   Dimensionless       



 



Quiz 1 (NAME ON TOP)
Give the dimensions of the following quantities:
20 miles
80 kg
0.01 m
20 minutes
5/6
a dozen
65 mph (speed limit)


 



Refer to Table 1.2 on page 4 for standard prefixes for factors of
ten. Most common:
kilo = 1000 = 
centi = 1/00 = 
giga = 1,000,000,000 = 
mega = 1,000,000 = 


 



To convert units, use a conversion fraction which equals one! For
example,


 


also


 


So if you want to find out how tall your are in meters, and you are
six feet tall:



 



to convert to centimeters:



 





 



Don&apos;t forget your trigonometry! For a right angle triangle, there is
sin cos and tan which give the ratios of lengths of sides.

Hand Back Last Day&apos;s Quiz!
Note to students from Celia:
``I will be in the office after class today (1:40 PM) Lab sections 1,
2, and 4 are FULL. You may not switch IN to a full lab section unless
you have a ``switching partner&apos;&apos; who wants to switch OUT of that
section. I will post lab rosters by Wednesday, so you can seek out
switching partners. Lecture section 2 is FULL. No students will be
added to the roster UNLESS: you are enrolled in Genetics and are in
your 4th year and need PHYS 23 for your degree. You must bring me
proof of these things before she will add you to Lecture Section 2.&apos;&apos;
QUIZ Notes (from separate sheet)


 



Units can be a problem solving aid.
 All terms in an equation must have the same units! 
(Terms are added or subtracted. This is the ``you can&apos;t add apples
and oranges rule&apos;&apos;)
Example:
A sparrow flies with an air velocity of 20 miles per hour toward the
East. There is a steady wind whose velocity is 20 km/hr toward the
West. What is the ground velocity of the bird in km/hr?
see page attached


 



NOTE: For the trig functions to work properly on your calculator, the ``mode&apos;&apos;
must be set to degrees!! You can check: sin(45)=0.707.... We won&apos;t
be using radians in this class, so you can set it to degrees and leave
it there.


 



TRIG Review continued.. sin, cos, tan are dimensionless!!
Last time, (height of building example) we knew an angle and one
side in a right-angle triangle, and found the length of the other
side. If we know two sides, we can get the angle.
Example
You drive 8.0 km along a straight road with a downward slope (as read
by your trip odometer), and descend 150 m. What is the angle of your
displacement vector? (this is the arrow which connects your initial
and final positions)
 DIAGRAM 






Units: 8.0 km (1000m/1km) = 8000 km



 






 






 





 



Also, don&apos;t forget pythagorean theorem: .
In last example, what was the horizontal distance traveled?
  m
  m
 
 
take square root of both sides, noting that !
 m
to within two significant digits, horizontal distance is 8.0 km.


 



 SCALARS are numbers which can be added or subtracted in the
regular way. It only takes ONE number to specify a scalar.
Examples of scalars: mass, volume, temperature, speed
2 kg + 2 kg = 4 kg always.


 



 VECTORS 
A vector is an arrow; it is a straight line with a length and a
direction.
It always takes TWO NUMBERS to specify a vector (in 2-dimensions,
which is what we will be dealing with in this course).
Either: Magnitude (length) and Direction (an angle)
or: x-component and y-component.
Examples of vectors: displacement, velocity, acceleration, force
How to add vectors (geometric way):
connect the tail of the second vector to the head of the
first. The sum is the vector which connects the tail of the
first to the tead of the second. (DIAGRAM)
How to subtract vectors (geometric way):
multiply the second vector by -1 (reverse its direction). then add it
to the first.


 



 Quiz 2 
Two displacement vectors are:
  m, due North
  m, due East
1. Find the displacement vector: 
2. Find the displacement vector: 
NOTE: you will need a magnitude and direction for your answer to be
correct!!

NOTES:
Exam 1 from Fall 1999 is in the red book at the library, which
you can check out for 2 hours.
Celia has posted lab section rosters in the glass cabinet. You may
find ``switching buddies&apos;&apos; here. NO SECTION MAY HAVE MORE THAN 24
students enrolled! YOU MAY NOT ATTEND A LAB YOU ARE NOT ENROLLED IN
WITHOUT SPECIAL PERMISSION FROM YOUR INSTRUCTOR!


 



Hand Back Last Day&apos;s Quiz. - - The answers:
  m, due North
  m, due East
1. Find the displacement vector: 
perpendicular vectors, so find magnitude with Pythagorean thm:



 



find direction from diagram:



 



final answer:  m, 45 East of North.
2. Find the displacement vector: 
perpendicular vectors, so find magnitude with Pythagorean thm:



 



find direction from diagram:



 



final answer:  m, 45 West of North.


 



1.7 components of a vector
Any vector in 2-D can be ``projected&apos;&apos; onto the and axes. The 
projections are called the vector components.
Each vector component has a corresponding ``scalar component&apos;&apos; which
is the magnitude of the vector component (positive if the vector is up 
or to the right, negative if it is down or to the left)
Any vector is completely specified by its two scalar components.
 DIAGRAM 
















When is measured counterclockwise from the axis, as it
usually is in the text, we can use the following formulae:
To convert from Magnitude and direction to scalar components:



 





 



To convert from scalar components to Magnitude and direction:



 





 





 



1.8 addition of vectors by components
Steps for adding two or more vectors which are not necessarily
parallel or perpendicular:
1) convert each vector to scalar components notation.
2) add the components and components separately, just as you
would add regular scalars.
3) if necessary, convert final vector back to ``magnitude and
direction&apos;&apos; notation
 Example 
A boat travels  km/hr along the -axis relative to the water.
Judy walks relative to the deck of the boat at  km/hr, with measured counterclockwise from the -axis, as shown in the diagram. What is the velocity of Judy
relative to the water (magnitude AND direction)?
Step 1: convert all vectors to , components, write in a table.

   -comp -comp boat 0 +45 km/hr Judy relative to boat 5.0 cos 25 5.0 sin 25 Judy relative to water 4.532 km/hr 47.113 km/hr 

The magnitude of the velocity is and the direction is 
Final answer (after rounding):  km/hr, .
NOTE: Only round-off FINAL answers to the correct number of
significant digits (the fewest number of significant digits among the
input values). In intermediate steps, keep a lot of digits, to avoid
``round off error&apos;&apos;. Several people got instead of on the quiz because they rounded too early and took instead of .


 



2.2 average speed, average velocity, instantaneous velocity
average velocity = displacement vector / elapsed time



 



(the bar over top means ``average&apos;&apos;)
This is the physical quantity which we can actually measure, but we
sometimes would like to discuss the velocity ``right now&apos;&apos;. What if
we could shrink the elapsed time interval to near zero, what would
happen to ? It would also get small. would
approach its ``instantaneous&apos;&apos; value, or ``instantaneous velocity&apos;&apos;
 the limit of as .


 



2.3 average acceleration, instantaneous acceleration
average acceleration = change in velocity vector / elapsed time



 



(the bar over top means ``average&apos;&apos;)
The instantaneous acceleration is:
 the limit of as .


 



Quiz 3 (YOU WILL NEED A CALCULATOR for Q.2 - or at least tell me
exactly what you would type in your calculator if you had brought it!)
1. Billy is stationary at a stop-light in his car. 11 seconds later,
his velocity is  m/s, , with measured counterclockwise from the axis (see diagram).
What is Billy&apos;s average acceleration during the 11 seconds he is
speeding up?
2. What is the component of Billy&apos;s average acceleration vector
along the -axis?


 



Often, motion is restricted to one-dimension (along a line). We often
define the line to be the -axis, and say that positive (negative)
numbers represent vectors which point to the right (left). Then
vectors are parallel and they can be added like scalars.
2.4 The equations of constant acceleration in 1-dimension (along the -axis):
The equation of zero acceleration ( ):



 



where is change in distance (1-D) and is the corresponding
change in time.
The definition of acceleration:



 



where is the final velocity, is the initial velocity (1-D)
and is the change in time between initial and final.
The four equations of constant acceleration :

 
 (1) (2) (3) (4) 
 



Equation 1 tells how has changed with time . Use it when is not involved.
Equation 2 tells that the change in is the average velocity times
the time interval. Under constant acceleration, average velocity is
initial plus final divided by two. Use it when is not involved.
Equation 3 tells how has changed with time when is known. Use
it when final is not involved. Note also that is often
zero, in which case this equation becomes .
Equation 4 is a tricky equation which relates the squares of the 
initial and final velocities. Use it with care when is not
involved. (note that the square-root of a number may be positive or
negative)

and the decimal place.
The answer should not contain more significant digits than the piece

significant digits. ie, at rest can be taken to mean v=0.000000...

Quiz 4 (three one-word answers)
1. A car is traveling along a straight road and is decelerating.
Does the car&apos;s acceleration necessarily have a negative value? (yes
or no only is fine)
Can the following statements be correct?
2. ``The car traveled around the track at a constant velocity.&apos;&apos;
3. ``The car traveled around the track at a constant speed.&apos;&apos;


 



NOTE: ``deceleration&apos;&apos; is when the acceleration vector is pointing in the
opposite direction of the velocity vector.
Steps in solving Chapter 2-like problems:
1. draw a diagram
2. decide which direction is positive, and where is .
3. write down the ``known&apos;&apos; variables and the ones that you need, or
are asked to ``find&apos;&apos;.
4. Select the best equations.
5. if there are segments to the motion, remember that the final
velocity of one segment is the initial velocity of the next.
6. there may be two possible answers, since: , .


 



 Example 
A cart is traveling along a table with  m/s. At , a
fan is turned on which gives the cart an acceleration of  m/s . When  m, what is the velocity of the cart?
 Answer 
Note that time is not mentioned in the problem - it is not known, and
you are not asked for it. So, use Equation 4:


 
 








What does this mean, physically??? How can the cart have two
different velocities?

NOTe


 



Completing discussion of friction:
Why does it occur? Smashing of mountains on the microscopic scale.
Do we understand it? Not completely. It would require an exact
knowledge of the microscopic shape of a surface and its fracture
properties to know exactly what the macroscopic friction force is.
However, we do have empirical formulae which work quite well.


 



Static Frictional Force:



 






 



where is the coefficient of static friction (dimensionless)
ie:
aluminum on aluminum: 
wood on wood: 
rubber on dry concrete: 
waxed wood on snow: 
 is the normal force of the surface on the object.
The magnitude of is not allowed to exceed , or the
object will start to slip. Otherwise, is equal to exactly the
force needed to keep the object in static contact with the surface.


 



Kinetic Frictional Force:



 



The direction of is always opposite to that of the
velocity of the object relative to the surface.
 is the coefficient of kinetic friction (dimensionless)
ie:
aluminum on aluminum: 
wood on wood: 
rubber on dry concrete: 
waxed wood on snow: 
(NOTE: is always less than - that is why you should
not spin your wheels frantically when trying to get your car out of
the snow.)


 



Example: 1a) A sled of mass 5 kg sits on waxed wooden skiis on snow. What
is the minimum horizontal force needed to get this sled moving along
the snow?
1b) If you push with this force and the sled does start moving, what
is its acceleration?
ANSWER
DIAGRAM.






















 



Tension Force.
When a cable or rope is stretched ``taut&apos;&apos;, it has some value of
``Tension&apos;&apos;, which is measured in Newtons.
On each end of the rope where it is attached, the rope pulls with a
force of magnitude equal to the rope&apos;s Tension. This is called the
Tension force. There are always two places where tension force acts,
at either end of the rope!


 



Quiz 12: Drawing Free Body Diagrams
This is IMPORTANT for your worked problems on the next exam.
1. A skydiver has opened her parachute and is descending at a constant
velocity. Draw the f.b.d. of forces on the diver which stop her from
accelerating.
2. A sled is pulled at a constant velocity by a rope which makes an
angle of 20 above horizontal. Draw the f.b.d., indicating the
direction of all forces on the sled.


 



4.11 Equilibrium Problems.
Definition:
An object in ``Equilibrium&apos;&apos; has zero acceleration (or no acceleration,
or .)


 



Example (like quiz problem 2)
A sled of mass 5 kg is pulled at a constant velocity by a rope which makes an
angle of 20 above horizontal. What is the force in the rope?

6.7 Power
When work is done during a period of time , the average power
is given by:



 



SI Unit of power is Joule/second = Watt. dimension: [ ]


 



Example (Ch 6, pr 62, pg 185)

Recall from last time:
The work done by non-conservative forces (at this point, that means
forces other than gravity) is given by:



 



When this is zero, it means , which is conservation of
mechanical energy (which I proved with the pendulum last class).
However, sometimes there is friction or an outside source of energy
which can provide non-conservative forces which do work.


 



Example
A car of mass 1200 kg begins at the top of a windy hill on Lombard
Street in San Francisco with an initial speed of 5.0 m/s, and height
above sea level of 59 m. At the bottom of the hill the car&apos;s speed is
15 m/s, and his height is 23 m above sea level. What was the work
done on the car by non-conservative forces?
Answer


 
 








This NEGATIVE work is probably done by a combination of brakes and friction
between the wheels and the car. Friction usually does NEGATIVE work,
because it opposes motion, and therefore the angle between and is 180 .
NOTE: In this example, 250 Joules of HEAT ENERGY is produced by the
brakes and wheels, through friction. So, although Total Mechanical
Energy is not conserved, Energy in the universe is conserved.


 



6.8 Forms of Energy

 Kinetic due to motion Potential Gravitational Potential Energy Electrical charge times voltage Heat thermal energy transfered between objects Light photon energy Chemical released when molecular bonds change Mass released by nuclear reactions 

 Conservation of Energy 
In any closed system, energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it
can only be converted from one form to another.


 



 Quiz 20 
Describe three processes that occur in your house on a daily basis
that convert energy from one form to another. Describe the process,
and name the initial and final forms of energy.


 



6.9 Work done by a variable force.
Recall, work done by a constant force is



 



In general, forces are not always constant along a path, but can vary . With calculus, work can be computed as:



 



where the sign is an integral sign. An integral is just the
area under a curve. So this equation just says that Work done is the
area under a plot of versus . (this is the area
between the plot and the -axis)

 Transfer of Heat
 13.1 - 13.4 
Lecture plan:
Convection, Conduction, Radiation


 



DEMOS: transparency


 



The transfer of heat from one place to another is extremely important
part of our lives! One of the main functions of our bodies is to
maintain a 37.0 degree body temperature. We use
the food we eat to generate heat and give energy to our muscles and
brain to work. This heat must constantly be exchanged with our
environment at a certain rate in order to maintain our 37.0 degree
temp. The origin of all this energy is the Sun, 150 million km away.
The energy travels across the vacuum of space by electromagnetic
radiation: light.
Chapter 13.
There are 3 ways to transfer heat (transparency):
Convection (circulating fluid flow)
Conduction (heat traveling through a static solid or material)
Radiation (electromagnetic radiation, ie light)


 



Convection - no equation for this! (yet) ``transfer of heat from
place to place by the bulk movement of fluid.&apos;&apos;
- can only be described qualitatively - One of the last great
problems of physics, still unsolved, is that of convective heat flow.
We need equations or numerical methods which describe turbulent fluid
flow. ie, how gases travel when an explosion occurs in a piston of an
internal combustion engine. What is the most efficient piston shape?
We have some guiding principles:
hot air has lower mass density than cold air - buoyancy force on warm
air carries it upward, while cooler air tends to sink.
Therefore: heaters are best placed near the floor in a corner.
air conditioners are best placed higher up.


 



Conduction
differs from convection: No bulk motion of material
Only the heat ENERGY moves.
DIAGRAM: Row of neighboring atoms. Someone vibrates the one on the
left. It transfers some of its energy to its neighbors. They
transfer energy, etc, until they are all vibrating. Every point is
trying to move toward local thermal equilibrium.
Net heat flow travels from the hot end of an object to the cool end.
Consider a long object like a rod, length , cross-sectional area . One end is held at temperature , the other is held at
temperature . What is the rate of heat flow through the rod?



 



where . Heat flows from high temperature end to
low temperature end. is the thermal conductivity, given in
Table 13.1 for different substances - units: Joules per (second meter
Celsius) 


 



Example.
One end of an iron poker is placed in a fire where the temperature is  C, ,and the other end is kept at a temperature of C. The poker is 1.2 m long and has a radius of  m. Ignoring the heat lost along the length of the
poker, find the amount of heat conducted from one end of the poker to
the other in 5.0 seconds.
DIAGRAM
Note: .
The radius of the rod is the cross-sectional radius, which determines
the area, assuming a circular cross-section:
 



 






 



  J


 





 



Example.
A styrofoam cup holds liquid nitrogen at 77 Kelvin, and is held by a
human hand, 37 Celsius. The cup is 2 mm thick, with an area touching
the hand of 50 square centimeters. How much heat is transfered out of
your hand in one second?
Note: .
77 Kelvin = C
50 cm = 50/100 m = 0.005 m 
L = m



 



  J

Radiation = the transfer of energy by means of electromagnetic waves.
Example: infrared light. This is light whose wavelength is longer
than red light - our eyes do not detect it. But it carries energy.
Example: the lamps they shine on French fries in a fast food
restaurant - they carry heat energy in the form of infrared. A
cast-iron stove in a cabin: You can&apos;t see the fire, but the black
stove emits infrared which you absorb as heat.
How fast is heat released from an object via EM-waves?

NOTE: 
A black surface absorbs all visible light: absorption coefficient, 
A white surface reflects all visible light: absorption coefficient, 
For a surface at a constant temp, energy absorbed = energy
emitted. (conservation of energy)
Therefore, the emission coefficient is always equal to the
absorption coefficient : . So a blackbody is the best
emitter: . That is why this form of radiation is often called
blackbody radiation, when can be left out of the equation:

Chapter 16.
Waves are a traveling disturbance.
They carry energy from one place to another.
DIAGRAM: Boat bobbing up and down. waves travel outward. distant
boat starts to bob later.
Note: The WAVE moves from one boat to the other, NOT the water.
Think of waves in a field of long grass, traveling across the field.
The blades of grass do not travel across the field with the wave.
They just sit there oscillating - same with water - indiv. water
molecules in a water wave stay in the same region, oscillating in
circular motion.
Two main types of wave:
transverse - disturbance is to direction wave travels.
longitudinal - disturbance is to direction wave travels.
Examples: electromagnetic waves (light, radio, etc) are transverse
sound is longitudinal


 



Properties of a wave.
A wave is an oscillation, repetitive disturbance, which travels. The
disturbance has:
Period (of repetition): = time for a complete cycle [seconds]
Frequency: = number of complete cycles per second [s ]
Speed: = speed that disturbance travels [m/s] or [m s ]
Wavelength: (lambda) = = distance wave travels per
complete cycle.
Three important relations between , , and :



 






 






 



NOTE: for sound traveling through air at room temperature,  m/s.

Speed of Sound
In an ideal gas, the speed of sound is:



 



where is a dimensionless constant for the gas
 = Boltzmann&apos;s constant = J/K.
 = temperature in Kelvin
 = the mass of one gas particle.

NOTE: Units are important for FINAL ANSWER on worked problems of
exams. You do not need to explicitly show units in intermediate
calculations, but they MUST be there in final answer.


 



Always try to THINK about a new equation when you see it. For
example,



 



Rearranging:



 



So, for a fixed wave speed (like speed of sound), and are inversely proportional - as one goes up, the other goes down.
That&apos;s true for sound: high frequency corresponds to short wavelength.


 



Other wave speeds to be aware of (and put on your aid sheet):
Sound wave in a liquid:



 



where is the adiabatic Bulk modulus for the liquid. (bulk
modulus for volume changes with no heat transfer) [N/m ]
 = mass density of liquid [kg/m ]
Sound wave in a solid:



 



where is the Young&apos;s modulus for the solid. [N/m ]
 = mass density of solid [kg/m ]
(recall learning about Young&apos;s modulus in PHYS 23, chapter 10)
Transverse waves on a taut string:



 



where is the tension in the string [N]
 = linear mass density of the string [kg/m]


 



Example:
A guitar string is pulled so that the tension is 12 Newtons. The
string is 55 cm long and its mass is 5 grams. What is the speed of a
transverse wave traveling along its length when it is plucked?
DON&apos;T FORGET TO CONVERT TO S.I. (aka MKS units: meters, kilograms, seconds)
length: =55 cm=0.55 m. (since 100cm=1m)
mass: =5 g=0.005 kg. (since 1000g=1kg)
 =0.005/0.55=0.009091kg/m



 





 



We have discussed:
The nature of waves (Transverse, longitudinal)
The frequency of waves (determines pitch for sound, color for light)
The speed of waves.
Today we will discuss the intensity of waves.
This is related to the ``amplitude&apos;&apos; of the disturbance, as I
mentioned briefly last day.
Waves carry energy. A wave emitter emits a certain amount of energy
per second (power). A wave detector absorbs a certain amount of
energy per second, based on its collecting area - more collecting
area, more received power. (that&apos;s why a satellite dish works better
than a thin antenna, or why we have ears rather than just little
holes)


 



Definition: Power, , of a wave is the amount of energy per time carried
by it (into all space). Units: Watt = Joule/second.
Definition: Intensity, , of a wave at a point is the amount of power
passing through a perpendicular surface divided by the area of that
surface, . Units: Watts/m 
relation:



 



Note that a speaker emits a certain power, . The volume knob
determines this power.
What you hear with your ear is proportional to intensity, . That&apos;s
why, as you are farther away from the speaker, it sounds quieter - the
power is the same, but the intensity has decreased.
For waves traveling out into all directions in 3-d (spherically
symmetric), the intensity drops as one over the distance squared:



 



where is the power of the source, and is the intensity
received at a distance from the source.
DIAGRAM
Note: as the wave travels out, it is evenly distributed around a
sphere at distance . The total area of this large sphere is , so this equation is really the same as .


 



The Decibel System ( ) - used for describing relative sound intensity
Defining equation:



 



where is the ``intensity level&apos;&apos; [decibels], is the sound
intensity [W/m ], and is a reference or standard intensity of . ``log&apos;&apos; means the logarithm to the
base 10. It is probably the LOG button on your calculator (not LN)
Because it is a logarithm, adding 10 decibels makes the intensity 10
times greater.

Doppler Effect.
If the wave source and the observer are steadily moving closer, then
the observed wavelength will be slightly SHORTER than ``rest&apos;&apos;
wavelength, and the observed frequency will be slightly HIGHER than
``rest&apos;&apos;.
If the wave source and observer are steadily moving farther apart,
,then the observed wavelength will be slightly LONGER than rest, and
observed frequency will be slightly LOWER.

Doppler Effect.

the observed wavelength will be slightly SHORTER than ``rest&apos;&apos;
wavelength, and the observed frequency will be slightly HIGHER than
``rest&apos;&apos;.
If the wave source and observer are steadily moving farther apart,
,then the observed wavelength will be slightly LONGER than rest, and
observed frequency will be slightly LOWER.
Note: Car driving past you with radio on sounds weird.
Also, if YOU are in your car driving past the Burns Tower while the
bells are ringing, it sounds weird!
Two possibilities:
The observer is at rest relative to the air, and the source is moving
toward observer:
DIAGRAM (source stationary)
Natural wavlength (source at rest) = The speed of sound
in air is .
DIAGRAM (source moving)
New wavelength (source moves a distance in one period)



 






 



Note: our ears actually don&apos;t detect the wavelength of the sound, they
detect the frequency! (How can they know the wavelength without
detecting pressure at several different locations?)
To get frequency, note that the speed of sound for the observer is , and use so that


 


and so


 



Note: if the source is moving away from the observer, use a negative
number for .
Second Possibility: Source is stationary, observer is moving toward
the source.
In this case, the wavelength of the sound as seen by the observer does
NOT CHANGE!! What changes is the speed of sound. Instead of , the
sound appears to be coming toward the observer at a speed . So
the frequency and wavelength are related by: 



 


where so:


 



Note: if the observer is moving away from the source, use a negative
number for .
Combining these two equations for a general case in which the source
AND observer are moving: (equation 16.15)



 



where is the Observed frequency, is the ``rest&apos;&apos;
frequency, emitted by the source. is the speed of the observer
moving toward the source relative to the air ( is negative if
observer is moving away). is the speed of the source moving
toward the observer relative to the air ( is negative if source
is moving away from observer). is the speed of sound, which is
always positive.
As long as the speeds involved are much less than the wave speed, then
the doppler shift is a fairly minor shift in . If the
speed is much less than the wave speed, then there is an APPROXIMATE
Doppler Shift equation that works quite well:



 



where is the shift in frequency ( if source approaches, if source recedes), is the relative speed of source and
observer, and is the wave speed.


 



Examples.
A fire truck drives at 25 m/s toward a stationary observer, with a
siren set to emit sound at 550 Hz. What frequency does the observer
hear? (Assume speed of sound is 345 m/s.)
Answer. (we expect higher). Use exact equation (16.15), with , , , :

A stationary fire truck is heard by an observer that is driving at
25 m/s towards it. The siren emits sound at 550 Hz. What frequency

Note: depth of water under a boat can be measured by emitting a sound
wave and waiting for the echo - SONAR. Sound is transmitted through
water, but reflects off the bottom. The shape of the bottom can be
mapped. (and fish can be found this way)
The limit to the precision of distance measurement to the bottom (or
fish) is the wavelength of the sound. distance uncertainty is always
greater than the wavelength. So to get more precise measurements,
you can use shorter wavelength (or higher frequency) sound.
Ultrasound has a wavelength of 0.3 mm in skin tissue. So it can
``image&apos;&apos; objects that reflect sound with an imagine accuracy of
0.3 mm. This can give a nice view of a developing fetus.


 



Sensitivity of Human Ear:
Human ear is not equally sensitive at all frequencies. See Figure
16.37 - most sensitive at about 3500 Hz. Or between 600 Hz and
6000 Hz.
Demo: Try different frequencies with the signal generator: which
sounds the loudest?
Note also: The shape of the Fletcher-Munson curve is like a sharp-V
for quiet sounds (low intensity): We have a peaked sensitivity near 3500 Hz. But for
loud sounds (high intensity) the curve is more flat, meaning that
lower and higher frequencies are heard at a more even level: the RANGE
of hearing is better. That is why music concerts are often so loud,
it is easier for our ears to pick up the high and low notes then, and
the music sounds better and richer.

Principle of superposition. ``when two or more waves intersect
 at the same place and time, the resultant disturbance is the sum of
 the disturbances from the individual waves.&apos;&apos;
DIAGRAM:
Draw on board two examples of harmonic waves adding for constructive
and destructive interference. (same phase angle, ``in phase&apos;&apos;, phase
different by radians, ``out of phase&apos;&apos;)
Example: two speakers emiting ``in phase&apos;&apos;. Whether the observer
hears them ``in phase&apos;&apos; or ``out of phase&apos;&apos; depends on the distances
to the individual speakers.
If the difference is 0 or some integer multiple of , then
there is constructive interference.
If the difference is ( ) times , where is
some integer, then there is destructive interference.

17.3 Diffraction of waves.
Define a ``wave front&apos;&apos;: locus of points with same phase angle: ie,
connect the crest.
A point source emits spherical wave fronts. Look like circles in 2-D.
Many sources on a plane or in a line (2-D) emit plane waves: look like
lines in 2-D. But this is really the superposition of many little
spherical wave fronts all propagating in the same direction.
called ``Huygen&apos;s wavelets&apos;&apos; Many spherical wavelets combine to make
one plane wave.
So when there is an obstruction with an opening in it, and a plane
wave passes through it, the wavelets at the edges do not have
neighbors on one side to complete the plane wave. So the wave spreads
out.
The amount of spreading depends on the ratio of the wavelength to the
size of the opening.
If is large (narrow hole compared to wavelength) the
spreading angle is large.
If is small (wide hole compared to wavelength) the
spreading angle is small. The wave continues to be a plane wave with
a sharp ``shadow&apos;&apos;.

17.5, 17.6 Standing Waves
When a wave hits an obstacle, the energy must either reflected or
transmitted or absorbed by the obstacle. For sound, the ``echo&apos;&apos; is
the reflection from the boundary at the surface of the obstacle.
For waves on a string, when the end of the string is encountered, a
reflection comes back.
Property of harmonic waves: When two indentical sine waves traveling
in opposite directions are superimposed (add) they form a standing
wave.
Google Demo.
A standing wave on a string fixed at both ends is actually the sum of
multiple traveling waves and their reflections from the ends!
Standing waves have ``nodes&apos;&apos; (no disturbance), and ``antinodes&apos;&apos;
maximum time-varying disturbance.
For a string of a length fixed at both ends, the number of
intermediate nodes plus one is the ``harmonic number&apos;&apos;. ie 0 nodes is
1st harmonic. 1 node is 2nd harmonic.
The frequency for vibrations on a string is given by:



 



where is the harmonic number (number of intermediate nodes + 1)

Electric Force
Coulomb&apos;s Law
Definition of electric field


 



Ben Franklin decided: Neutral = no net electric charge, no electric
force between objects.
Positive = charged like a glass rod
Negative = charged like a rubber rod.
Franklin observed that if two glass rods were rubbed, they repelled.
If two rubber rods were rubbed, they repelled. But if a glass and
rubber rod were rubbed, they attracted each other.
This is called the ``Electric Force&apos;&apos;, . acts between any
two objects with electric charge. Like charges repel, opposite
charges attract.
Examples of electric force direction:
DIAGRAM: , (show forces)
 , (show forces)
 , (show forces)
 , (show forces)
 , (no electric force)
 , (no electric force)


 



The magnitude of the electric force depends on both the amount of
charge and the distance between them:



 



where  N m  C is Coulomb&apos;s constant
 = charge of object 1, in Coulombs, C.
 = charge of object 2, in Coulombs, C.
 = distance between objects 1 and 2, m.


 



Note: we now have three things for which lower-case is the letter,
all totally different, with totally different units:
Coulomb&apos;s constant: ,  N m  C (used in electric force)
Boltzman&apos;s constant: ,  J K (used in
speed of sound in ideal gas)
thermal conductivity: , J s  m  C (used in heat
conduction)
Also, there are now two meanings for upper-case C:
C = Celsius, a unit for the quantity (temperature)
C = Coulomb, a unit for the quantity (charge)
Please don&apos;t get mixed up - look carefully at units, and which
concepts they apply to, before inserting a constant into your equation.


 



Electric charge: what the heck is it?
All matter in this room is made up of three types of fundamental
particles: electrons, protons, and neutrons. these are the building
blocks of matter.
neutrons have zero electric charge.
protons have  C
electrons (2000 times smaller than neutrons or protons) have  C
The electron and proton charges are EXACTLY opposite, so that if an
object contains an equal number of electrons and protons, it is
neutral.
Example
A neutral glass rod by itself has more than electrons, and
the exact same number of protons. If you rub it, many thousands of
these electrons can be stripped off. That will give the rod a slight
residual excess of protons (NOTE: protons don&apos;t move around easily in
any solid - they are firmly anchored in crystal structure of solids.
electrons are tiny and can fly through a some solids quite easily)
So stripping the electrons from a glass rod leaves it with a net
positive charge!
When you rub a rubber rod, you tend to deposit more electrons upon
it. That give it an excess of electrons, which registers as a net
negative charge.


 



Conservation of charge.
Charge can never be created or destroyed, only transfered from one
place to another (this just says that protons and electrons cannot be
destroyed or created from nothing - fairly obvious).


 



Quiz.
Two short metal wires are identical in size, shape and mass.
Wire A becomes electrically charged so that its final charge is  C. Wire B becomes electrically charged so that
its final charge is  C.
1) Does the number of protons in either wire change?
2) Does the number of electrons in either wire change?
3) Which wire ends up with a larger mass?
4) A single electron has a mass of  kg, what is
the final difference between the mass of wires A and B?


 



Where does the coulomb come from?
One of the seven fundamental S.I. units is the ``Ampere&apos;&apos;. This is a
unit of electric current that produces a certain magnetic force around
it. A Coulomb is the amount of charge delivered by one Ampere of
current in one second.


 



Electric Field
A certain point in space may be surrounded by various distributions of
electric charges. All of those charges will produce a certain force
if a certain test charge is placed at that point. Since the force per
charge is all we often care about, we define the Electric Field, , so that:



 



where is the electric field, which is a vector [N/C]
 is the force (vector) on a small test charge, [N]
 is the charge of the test charge [C]
So we think of the electric field as a property of space. When you
hold up a charged glass rod, it alters the space around it: It
provides an electric field. This field is there even if there are no
charges to feel it. But if a charge, , is placed in an electric
field, , then the force on this charge is:
 


 



Example 1. Between two metal plates, the electric field is =20 N/C, upward. What is the electric force on a proton
placed in this field?
Answer,
 
  Newtons, up.


 



Example 2. Same question, but for an electron instead of proton:
Answer,
 
  Newtons, down.

What is lightning?
The clouds and the ground act as a huge parallel plate capacitor.
Charge may flow in the clouds easily, and charge may flow in the
ground easily, but the air is an &apos;&apos;electrical insulator&apos;&apos;: it is very
difficult for electrons to flow in it. But when the Electric Field
magnitude is high enough (about Volts per meter) air can
conduct: this is a spark or lightning.


 



Conductors and Insulators
Different materials have different abilitys to allow charge to flow
through them.
DIAGRAM: If a material is placed in an electric field, electrons will
feel the electric force and try to accelerate (in the opposite
direction of the -field.
In a good electrical conductor, such as copper or aluminum, these
electrons will move: Motion of charge is called electric current, or
``current&apos;&apos;, and is measured in Amperes=Coulombs/second. The electrons
will keep moving as long as there is an electric field to accelerate
them.
In a good thermal insulator, such as plastic or wood, the electrons
will not move.
That&apos;s why wires are made of copper and have a plastic coating on the
outside of them, so you don&apos;t get shocked.


 



Charge by induction.
A neutral conductor normally has its positive charge and negative
charge spread evenly throughout it. But if it is placed in an
electric field, the electrons will be accelerated within the
conducting object until they reach their boundaries.
Example: Rolling Can demo.
The can is still neutral: And yet it gains a net charge on one side of
it and an opposite net charge on the other. But since electric force
from the rod drops as (1/ ), the attraction to the near side wins,
and the can is attracted.
That&apos;s ``charge by induction&apos;&apos;, as opposed to ``charge by contact&apos;&apos;,
in which the object is actually touched and electrons are transfered
in or out of the object.


 



NOTE: Why do electrons orbit the nucleus in an atom?
The nucleus is positively charged, and the electrons are negatively
charged. Therefore, there is an attractive electric force, which
pulls the electrons toward the nucleus. This is exactly analogous to
how gravity pulls the planets toward the sun or pulls the moon toward
the Earth. The electrons may either fall directly toward the nucleus,
or, if they are moving, the electric force may provide the
centripetal force needed to hold them in orbit.
Example: Hydrogen. An electron is at a distance of  m from a proton. The proton is fixed, while the
electron moves sideways. At what speed must the electron move in
order to travel in a circle around the proton?
Answer:
Set:
Centripetal Force = Electric Force



 



solve for :



 



about 2000 km/s!! These electrons are really trucking around!


 





 



Electric field is a Vector. It is a property of space.
It points in the direction a positive test charge would be
accelerated.
Units of are [Newtons/Coulomb] or [Volts/Meter] (these are
equivalent)


 



Demo: Show transparencies.
Rules for drawing electric field lines.
1. lines begin at positive charges, and terminate at negative
charges. - when lines touch a conducting surface, they are always
perpendicular to the surface.
3. lines don&apos;t cross.
4. lines get radially condensed near a point charge.
5. lines tend to be parallel near a flat charge, like a plate

A closed conducting surface shields the inside from the effects of any
charge distribution outside the surface.
NOTE: similarly, a closed surface shields the outside from the
effects of a charge distribution inside the surface.

Ben Franklin decided: Neutral = no net electric charge, no electric
force between objects.
Positive = charged like a glass rod
Negative = charged like a rubber rod.
Franklin observed that if two glass rods were rubbed, they repelled.
If two rubber rods were rubbed, they repelled. But if a glass and
rubber rod were rubbed, they attracted each other.
This is called the ``Electric Force&apos;&apos;, . acts between any
two objects with electric charge. Like charges repel, opposite
charges attract.
Examples of electric force direction:
DIAGRAM: , (show forces)
 , (show forces)
 , (show forces)
 , (show forces)
 , (no electric force)
 , (no electric force)


 



The magnitude of the electric force depends on both the amount of
charge and the distance between them:



 



where  N m  C is Coulomb&apos;s constant
 = charge of object 1, in Coulombs, C.
 = charge of object 2, in Coulombs, C.
 = distance between objects 1 and 2, m.


 



Note: we now have three things for which lower-case is the letter,
all totally different, with totally different units:
Coulomb&apos;s constant: ,  N m  C (used in electric force)
Boltzman&apos;s constant: ,  J K (used in
speed of sound in ideal gas)
thermal conductivity: , J s  m  C (used in heat
conduction)
Also, there are now two meanings for upper-case C:
C = Celsius, a unit for the quantity (temperature)
C = Coulomb, a unit for the quantity (charge)
Please don&apos;t get mixed up - look carefully at units, and which
concepts they apply to, before inserting a constant into your equation.


 



Electric charge: what the heck is it?
All matter in this room is made up of three types of fundamental
particles: electrons, protons, and neutrons. these are the building
blocks of matter.
neutrons have zero electric charge.
protons have  C
electrons (2000 times smaller than neutrons or protons) have  C
The electron and proton charges are EXACTLY opposite, so that if an
object contains an equal number of electrons and protons, it is
neutral.
Example
A neutral glass rod by itself has more than electrons, and
the exact same number of protons. If you rub it, many thousands of
these electrons can be stripped off. That will give the rod a slight
residual excess of protons (NOTE: protons don&apos;t move around easily in
any solid - they are firmly anchored in crystal structure of solids.
electrons are tiny and can fly through a some solids quite easily)
So stripping the electrons from a glass rod leaves it with a net
positive charge!
When you rub a rubber rod, you tend to deposit more electrons upon
it. That give it an excess of electrons, which registers as a net
negative charge.


 



Conservation of charge.
Charge can never be created or destroyed, only transfered from one
place to another (this just says that protons and electrons cannot be
destroyed or created from nothing - fairly obvious).


 



Quiz.
Two short metal wires are identical in size, shape and mass.
Wire A becomes electrically charged so that its final charge is  C. Wire B becomes electrically charged so that
its final charge is  C.
1) Does the number of protons in either wire change?
2) Does the number of electrons in either wire change?
3) Which wire ends up with a larger mass?
4) A single electron has a mass of  kg, what is
the final difference between the mass of wires A and B?


 



Where does the coulomb come from?
One of the seven fundamental S.I. units is the ``Ampere&apos;&apos;. This is a
unit of electric current that produces a certain magnetic force around
it. A Coulomb is the amount of charge delivered by one Ampere of
current in one second.


 



Electric Field
A certain point in space may be surrounded by various distributions of
electric charges. All of those charges will produce a certain force
if a certain test charge is placed at that point. Since the force per
charge is all we often care about, we define the Electric Field, , so that:



 



where is the electric field, which is a vector [N/C]
 is the force (vector) on a small test charge, [N]
 is the charge of the test charge [C]
So we think of the electric field as a property of space. When you
hold up a charged glass rod, it alters the space around it: It
provides an electric field. This field is there even if there are no
charges to feel it. But if a charge, , is placed in an electric
field, , then the force on this charge is:
 


 



Example 1. Between two metal plates, the electric field is =20 N/C, upward. What is the electric force on a proton
placed in this field?
Answer,
 
  Newtons, up.

Question: What is a ``Volt&apos;&apos;? Most have heard of it, but few
understand what it is.
Volt is the S.I. Unit of ``Electric Potential&apos;&apos;. The difference
between electric potential of two points is often called ``Voltage&apos;&apos;.
A voltage between two points can drive an electric current.


 



Let&apos;s look at the math underlying this:
 Scalar Field: Assigns a single value (ie pressure or
temperature) to every point in 3-D space.
 Vector Field: Assigns a vector (ie electric field)
to every point in 3-D space.
Electric Field is a Vector Field. It has direction, is a property of
space determined by some external charge distribution.
Electric Potential is a Scalar Field. It is has no direction, but is
a property of space determined by some external charge distribution.


 



We define ``Electric Potential Energy&apos;&apos; of any small charge, as:


 


where [Joules], is electric potential [Volts], and is charge in [Coulombs].


 



Example. Tesla Coil.
  C of charge travels between my wand ( ) and the
ball at the top of the Tesla Coil. ( ) What is the change in
K.E. of this charge as it travels between the wand and the ball?
Work-Energy Theorem:



 





 





 





 





 



For the space surrounding a point charge, , the electric potential
due to this charge is;



 



where is electric potential in [Volts] or [V], is the Coulomb&apos;s constant, is the charge in [C]
(including sign), and is the distance from (always
posistive).
NOTES:
 potential has an arbitrary zero point (much like ``height&apos;&apos; or
gravitational potential). We could have just as correctly written:


 


where is some constant.
 By convention, we choose when .
So in the above equation.
 When two or more charges are present, the total potential is
the sum of the potentials of the individual charges.
 A positive test charge tends to accelerate from high to
low . It gains kinetic energy as it does this, and we say that
this energy comes from the electric potential.


 



Example: Electric Potential due to more than one charge is MUCH easier
to compute than Electric Field due to more than one charge.
Two charges are located in the - plane. One has C
 and is located on the -axis at , shown as the black dot in
 the figure below. The other has C and is located on the -axis at , shown as the white dot in the figure below.

For the space surrounding a point charge, , the electric potential
due to this charge is;



 



where is electric potential in [Volts] or [V], is the Coulomb&apos;s constant, is the charge in [C]
(including sign), and is the distance from (always
posistive).
NOTES:
 potential has an arbitrary zero point (much like ``height&apos;&apos; or

 A positive test charge tends to accelerate from high to

this energy comes from the electric potential.


 



Lesson learned from this week&apos;s lab:
Equipotential Surfaces: can be easily mapped with a volt-meter. -
surfaces of equal electric potential (volts)
Things to NOTE:
 -field is always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces
 -field always points toward lower potential.
the surface of a conductor is always an equipotential surface.
Example:
The electric potential around a point charge drops as one over the
distance:



 



 and are constants, so equipotential surfaces around a point
charge are spheres, of constant . DIAGRAM - is perpendicular
to these surfaces - it points radially outward.


 



Let&apos;s do an example to review all the concepts involved in
electrostatics so far:
The plates of a capacitor are separated by a distance of 0.03 m.
There is an electric potential difference between them of  V. A free-floating positive charge of mass  kg and charge  C begins at rest
at the positive potential plate, and accelerates toward the negative
plate. What is the speed of the charge when it arrives at the
negative plate?
THE MAIN IDEA: The positive charge accelerates toward the negative
plate - its speed is zero at first, and steadily increases toward
final speed.
Two approaches to problem: 1) Electric Field gives Electric Force
gives acceleration. Acceleration can be used to find final speed.
OR
2) Electric Potential give E.P.E. gives work. Work done can be used
to find final kinetic energy and therefore speed.
USUALLY Method 2 is EASIER - but lets do both:


 



Method 1 - electric field:
equation 19.7 (pg.569):


 


 is always directed toward the plate with lower potential -
the negative plate.
electric field gives force on a charge:



 



(here we have used the fact that in S.I. units, [V/m] is equivalent to
[N/C])
force gives acceleration by Newton&apos;s 2nd law: F=ma:



 



we know distance traveled, and initial speed=zero, so:


 






 





 



Method 2 - electric potential



 



Since the charge ends at E.P.E.=0 J, it has lost  J
of E.P.E. in its travel of 0.03 m. All of this E.P.E. is converted to
kinetic energy. The initial K.E.=0 since the charge begins at rest.
Therefore the final K.E.=  J



 





 





 



Quiz 11
A 12 V single battery is used to power a flashlight. In 7 hours, a
total of 23,000 Coulombs of charge has flowed from the plus to minus
terminals of the battery, through the flashlight bulb. How much power
does this flashlight draw, in Watts?
hints: calculate the E.P.E. of this much charge at each terminal of
the battery - the drop in E.P.E. is the work done. Power is Work / time.


 



NEW ENERGY UNIT (non-S.I.)
How much energy does an electron get if it is accelerated through a
potential difference of magnitude 1 Volt? Answer:  Joules. So we define a
new unit, sometimes used in electronics:
1 ``electron-Volt&apos;&apos; = 1 eV = Joules


 



Capacitors and Dielectrics
What is the electric potential in a parallel plate capacitor?
DIAGRAM: plate with , plate with , is distance toward from . Area of both plates is .
if a vacuum separates the plates:



 



where is the electric potential at a point a distance from the
negative plate. is the magnitude of the charge on either plate
(positive), and is the area of the plate.
 is the dielectric constant of the material between the
plates. is a dimensionless number always greater than or
equal to 1. For a vacuum, for other materials, is
listed in Table 19.1 on page 572.
NOTE: all numbers in this equation are positive.
- by convention, we always choose the negative plate in a parallel
plate capacitor to have .


 



Parallel plate capacitors are commonly used in electronics.
Abbreviation = ``capacitor&apos;&apos;
The main application of a capacitor to store some charge. In
these cases, we wish to know, for a particular capacitor ``How much
charge can this capacitor hold, for a given voltage, ?&apos;&apos;
so solve for in the above equation:



 



where is now the total distance between the and plates:



 



For a particular capacitor, and are fixed, so the quantity is a constant. We define a new number:



 



 =capacitance (since it measures the ``capacity&apos;&apos; of a capacitor to
hold charge, given a potential difference).
Units of Capacitance, are [Coulombs/Volt] or [Farad] [F]
So, our equation simplifies to:



 





 



One last equation to ponder over the weekend. When you have a
capacitor with a capacitance charged up to a voltage , the
energy stored in this capacitor is:



 



Doesn&apos;t this equation remind you of something (kinetic energy?).
Isn&apos;t Physics beatuful? The symmetries and analogies to be drawn
between equations and related phenomena are endless.

NOTE: A non-vacuum always REDUCE between the plates of a

Voltage of a capacitor:



 



the reason the Voltage is decreased is because the electric field
magnitude is decreased. The reason the electric field is decreased is
because little pairs of charge are stretched throughout the
dielectric material, causing a net reduction in effective charge on
either plate. (Figure 19.20)


 



Example:
Two parallel aluminum plates are hooked to a battery so that there is
9 volts potential difference between them. The positive plate holds  C of charge in this configuration. How much charge do
they hold if a book is slipped between them (all other things

Chapter 20:
Current: . when charge flows from one place to another, the rate
of charge flow is called ``electric current&apos;&apos; or just ``current&apos;&apos; for
short. The units are Coulombs per second, or ``Amperes&apos;&apos; or ``Amps&apos;&apos;
for short.
 
Example
30 Coulombs of charge flows through a wire in 15 seconds. What is the
current in the wire?
answer:
 


 



A DC circuit is created when we hook the terminal of a battery to
the terminal, connected by wires and possibly other components.
(note DC stands for ``direct current&apos;&apos;, as opposed to AC which stands
for alternating current)
Charge flows through the circuit from to because of the drop
in electric potential.
The rate that charge flows is called ``electric current&apos;&apos;, .
That is determined by the potential drop and the resistance of
 the circuit, :

low pressure, narrow windy pipe:
the water goes round and round (like current)
if you turn up the pressure in the pump, the water flows faster (like voltage)

resistance)
(The difference is that you can NEVER empty the pipe of water -

20.3 Resistivity
Any particular resistor you buy has a resistance, in 
wires, or anything that carries current has some resistance
for a wire, the resistance is given by:



 



where = ``resistivity&apos;&apos; of the material in [Ohm m]
 is the length of the wire [m]

Quiz 12

the current through this wire?
First find resistance:



 



Next use Ohm&apos;s law to find current:



 





 



Power
When current runs through a wire or resistor, it creates HEAT. If,
instead of a normal resistor, we have an electric engine, mechanical
work can also be done. In either case, the power is proportional to
the voltage drop times the current:



 



where is the power dissipated in the wire or circuit [Watts]
 is the current in the wire or circuit [Amps = Coulombs per second]


 



Note, since we can solve for in terms of and :

which wire goes in which socket



 
NOTE: Power used by a resistor is always positive! This is why AC or
alternating current works! (DIAGRAM)


 



Alternating current: We look at a particular wire with a resistor. We
define positive current as flowing ``toward the right&apos;&apos; for example.
Therefore, negative current means it is flowing ``toward the left&apos;&apos;.
Similarly, across the resistor from left to right can be positive
or negative. The only thing that is ALWAYS positive is resistance.
So in Ohm&apos;s law, if and always have the same sign.
A DC battery always pushes current in the same direction. The voltage
supplied by the battery is sometimes called ``emf&apos;&apos; (curly-E). (For
historical reasons)
But an AC generator alternates repeately pushing current back and
forth through the resistor. The supplied voltage is a function of
time:

Question: if the voltage across the battery is , what is the

to go up, since the current must travel through BOTH. when two
resistors are put in parallel, resistance tends to go down, since the
current may travel through EITHER.



 
 20.8 Parallel/Series Circuits

you must compute the resistances of the individual parts.

4) Find the current flowing through the 9 V battery



 
 20.9 Internal Resistance 
It is important to note that all batteries have some resistance inside 
them. So when you draw a current through a battery, there is a
voltage across the internal resistor ( ), and this potential drop 
effectively reduces the voltage of the battery.



 


where is the current that is being drawn across the battery. The
terminal voltage is the actual voltage used in the circuit. As increases (battery ages, leads get corroded, etc.) the
terminal voltage will decrease, even if the is fine.

resistivity (of a type of material in  m).

It is ALWAYS true that:

increased. and of the wire remained the same (except for some
very small thermal expansion), therefore MUST have increased.

 20.11 Ammeters, Voltmeters 
- the fundamental measuring device in an ammeter or voltmeter is
called a galvanometer. It is a spring loaded coil between two magnets 
that rotates an amount that is proportional to the current passing
through it.
- A voltmeter must be hooked in parallel across to points to measure
the potential difference between A and B. It draws a small amount of
current through it, which will effectively reduce the voltage being
measured. So voltmeters must have a very high resistance in order to
prevent much current from going through them.
- An ammeter must be hooked in series with the circuit, to find the
current flowing between point A and B. Ideally, the resistance inside 
an ammeter must be low, or it would affect the current being measured
significantly (by adding to the resistance of the circuit) Note, if
the ammeter is the ONLY source of resistance in the circuit, the
current ( ) will be very high and you will destroy the galvanometer!
NOTE: Multimeters in lab have a fuse in them when used as ammeters.
This 5-cent fuse will be destroyed if you hook a 9 Volt battery in parallel
across the ammeter (thereby saving the 30-dollar galvanometer).



 
 20.12 Capacitors in Series and Parallel 
For many capacitors all in parallel:



 


where is the total capacitance in a parallel circuit
 Example

battery, the total capacitance of the ``equivalent
capacitor&apos;&apos; is .
For many capacitors all in series:



 


where is the total capacitance in a series circuit
 Example 
 DIAGRAM 
4 capacitors in a series circuit with
DC battery, the total
capacitance of the ``equivalent capacitor&apos;&apos; is:



 





 






 

   Series Parallel Effective Resistance Effective Capacitance 




 
 20.13 RC Circuits - A resistor in series with a capacitor is a clock 
 DIAGRAM Fig 20.38, 20.29.








When a resistor is in series with a battery and a capacitor, it takes
some time for the capacitor to charge to its maximum. It is an
asymptotic rise in charge on the capacitor, so it never actually reaches maximum. But there is a time constant (similar to
``half-life&apos;&apos;) for such a circuit called the time constant :


 


strangely enough, the units of times is seconds.
An example is when a charged capacitor is placed in a circuit with
resistance , it acts as a DC battery for a while. Its charge
decreases with time:



 



So an circuit can use this time to build up a measurable charge
as a timer - this is what is used in pacemakers and windshield wipers.



 
 21.1 Magnets 
- Permanent Magnets have a North and South ``pole&apos;&apos;
- The names come from the fact that when allowed to rotate without
frictional torque on the surface of the Earth, the North pole points
North, and the South pole points South
- When two permanent magnets are brought together, like poles repel,
opposite poles attract. Force Of Magnetism!
 DIAGRAM (bar magnets N-N, S-S repel, N-S, S-N attract)








- demos: two strong U-magnets to repel and attract
- demos: the little pile of levetating annuli
- demos: compass
The microscopic reason: Magnetic fields are created by moving
charges. An iron atom has electrons orbiting its nucleus. Each
electron is a rapidly moving charge in a tight circular orbit. In
most materials the magnetic fields of all the atoms are oriented
randomly and cancel out. In iron there is a tendency for neigboring
atoms to all have the same alignment of electron orbit directions -
yielding a net magnetic field.



- The Earth has electric currents flowing in circles within its liquid
metallic core - this causes it to act like a giant magnet!
- Note, the ``South Pole&apos;&apos; or label for the Earth goes up in
Canada, since that is where the sides of compasses are attracted to.
- the Magnetic North Pole is not at the same location as the Earth&apos;s
spin axis (True North Pole)
- transparencies Magnetic North is in Nunavut, Canada - near
there, compasses don&apos;t work!
- transparencies In U.S.A., true North and Compas North differ
by as much as 20 degrees (angle)
 21.2 Magnetic Field, 
Surrounding a permanent magnet or some moving charges is a Magnetic
Field, . This is a vector field, similar to Electric Field:
 : Electric Field - gives direction of force on any positive
test charge
 : Magnetic Field - gives direction that the North end of a
``test compass&apos;&apos; would point.
 points toward poles of nearby permanent magnets.
- demos: transparency, transparent compass on it. Put a magnet down,
compass changes direction depending on where it is - sprinkly iron
filings down, it traces field lines.
 21.2 Magnetic Force, 
The magnetic field strength and direction also gives the strength and
direction of the force on a moving charge in the field. The magnitude
of the force on a moving test charge in a magnetic field of
strength is:


 


where is the particle&apos;s speed, and is the angle between
the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector.
- The Magnetic Force is always perpendicular to both and .

Right Hand Rule: Hold your right hand with your four fingers together
and your thumb pointing to the side. Point your fingers in the
direction of the field lines, your thumb in the direction of

Magnetic Force, on the positive test charge. Negative test
charges would be pushed in the opposite direction.

 21.2 Magnetic Field, 
Surrounding a permanent magnet or some moving charges is a Magnetic
Field, . This is a vector field, similar to Electric Field:
 : Electric Field - gives direction of force on any positive
test charge. SI Unit of magnitude of : [N/C] or [V/m]
 : Magnetic Field - gives direction that the North end of a
``test compass&apos;&apos; would point. SI Unit of magnitude of :

 21.2 Magnetic Force, 
The magnetic field strength and direction also gives the strength and
direction of the force on a moving charge in the field. The magnitude
of the force on a moving test charge in a magnetic field of
strength is:


 


where is the particle&apos;s speed, and is the angle between
the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector.
- The Magnetic Force is always perpendicular to both and .

Right Hand Rule: Hold your right hand with your four fingers together

direction of the field lines, your thumb in the direction of
the velocity . Your palm should ``push&apos;&apos; in the direction of the
Magnetic Force, on the positive test charge. Negative test
charges would be pushed in the opposite direction.


 



Example. At the equator, the field of the Earth is  Tesla, to the North. If a positively charged
golf-ball falls directly down, what is the direction of the magnetic
force on the ball?
[East]
NOTE: If the golf ball had been negatively charged, the answer would
be West (the opposite of what you get for a positive charge)


 



Example. If the ball in the previous example has a charge of  C on it, then what is the magnitude of the force
on the ball, at the instant it is falling with speed 3 m/s,
perpendicular to ?

 21.3 Circular Trajectories of charged particles in B-fields 
- NOTE: the force is always perpendicular to the velocity, which
should remind you of centripetal force.
- the path of a particle in a constant magnetic field is circular.
Recall, centripetal force is given by:



 



if  degrees, then , solve for :



 



stronger magnetic field yields ``tighter&apos;&apos; circular trajectories.
lower speeds yields ``tighter&apos;&apos; circular trajectories.
lower masses yields ``tighter&apos;&apos; circular trajectories.
 21.4 The Mass Spectrometer 
 DIAGRAM a mass spectrometer, field out of page, ion source,
detector











When you singly ionize some of the particles in a gas, each individual
particle will receive a positive charge equal to the charge of an
electron:  Coulombs. ( )
- the radius of the curved path of a charge is therefore
determined by the mass and the strength of the magnetic field. By
putting a detector at a certain distance, and varying the strength of
the magnetic field, we can measure the mass of the individual atoms or
molecules, using the above formula. (mass of the individual particles
vs number of particles per mole of material = ``Mass Spectrum&apos;&apos;)

 21.5 The Force on a current in a Magnetic Field 
 - When a straight wire is placed in a constant magnetic field, there
is a force on this wire perpendicular to the wire and the magnetic
field. 
Begin with the equation for the strength of the magnetic force:



 


where is some amount of moving charge.
Multiply and divide by , a small change in time:



 


where is the current, ,
and is the distance this current travels, or the length
of a wire, . We write:


 



Where is the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire of length .
- The right hand rule may be applied to find the direction of this
force.
 DIAGRAM of a section of a longer wire (length ) carrying
current through a magnetic field , where the angle between the field and the current is . Show the Force and Direction!














 QUIZ 16 
An electric power line carries a current of 1400 Amperes in a location
where the Earth&apos;s Magnetic field is  Tesla, in a
horizontal direction, due North. The power line is also horizontal, and
makes an angle of with respect to the field. Determine the
magnitude and direction of the magnetic force on a 120 meter length of
the line.
Answer



 



Force direction on a map is out of the page, or ``vertically upwards&apos;&apos; 
in real life.
 
 21.6 Torque on a coil - Electric Motors 
 - When a loop of current is placed in a constant magnetic field,
there is a torque on the loop which tends to twist it so that the loop
normal becomes aligned with the magnetic field 
For a coil in a constant magnetic field:



 



where is the number of loops in the coil, is the current
running through the coil, is the cross-sectional area of the coil, is the strength of the magntic field, and is the angle
between the coil and the magnetic field.
 DIAGRAM of a coil in a magnetic field with loops, and a
cross-secional area , at an angle . Show the direction of .
 - example A circular coil of one turn is made from a wire of
length  m. There is a current of   in
the wire. In the presence of a  Tesla magnetic field, what is
the largest torque that this loop can experience?
 DIAGRAM +solution:
The maximum torque as the coil rotates will be when is at
its maximum value of 1. This occurs when . So we
have:



 



In our case there is one turn, so . The coil is a circle and the 
length of the wire must be its circumference, . Solve for  m. The area is then  m . So:

Review of last lecture material:
- when a charge moves in a magnetic field there are THREE vectors:



 


is the Magnetic Field [Tesla] = [Newton second Coulomb meter ] is a vector quantity defined anywhere in space.



 


is the Force due to the Magnetic Field on a test charge of .
Units = [Newtons]



 


is the velocity of the test charge .
 is always perpendicular to BOTH and .
In order to find the direction, you can use the ``Right Hand Rule # 1&apos;&apos;:
Fingers along , thumb along , then will
be in the direction the palm lifts for positive moving charges, and
the opposite direction for negative moving charges.
The magnitude of the Force of Magnetism on the moving particle is:


 


where is the angle between the velocity vector and the
magnetic field vector.


 



 21.3 Circular Trajectories of charged particles in B-fields 
- NOTE: the force is always perpendicular to the velocity, which
should remind you of centripetal force.
- the path of a particle in a constant magnetic field is circular.
Recall, centripetal force is given by:



 



if  degrees, then , solve for :



 



stronger magnetic field yields ``tighter&apos;&apos; circular trajectories.
lower speeds yields ``tighter&apos;&apos; circular trajectories.
lower masses yields ``tighter&apos;&apos; circular trajectories.

particle will receive a positive charge equal to the charge of an

 21.6 Torque on a coil - Electric Motors 
 - When a loop of current is placed in a constant magnetic field,
there is a torque on the loop which tends to twist it so that the loop
normal becomes aligned with the magnetic field 
Consider for a moment a square loop in a magnetic field. Use RHR#1
to determine the force on each wire: they are equal and opposite, so
there is no net force on the wire, but there is a torque!
The torque tends to turn the coil until the loop normal points in the 
direction of the external magnetic field.
For a coil in a constant magnetic field:



 



where is the number of loops in the coil, is the current
running through the coil, is the cross-sectional area of the coil, is the strength of the magntic field, and is the angle
between the coil and the magnetic field.
 DIAGRAM of a coil in a magnetic field with loops, and a
cross-secional area , at an angle . Show the direction of .


 



 21.7 Currents in wires Create Magnetic Fields. 
Up until now we have dealt with wires in the presence of external
magnetic fields, and found the forces and torques on them. NOTE: a
current carrying wire all by itself in the universe creates a magnetic 
field. (moving charges create fields)


 



 Long, Straight wire 
A long straight wire creates its own field which goes in circles
around the wire. The strength of the field is given by:



 



where is a constant (permeability of free space = ), is the current, , and is the
perpendicular distance from the wire.
The direction is given by the ``Right Hand Rule # 2&apos;&apos;:
Point your thumb in the direction the current is moving. Allow the
tips of your fingers to bend. This is the direction of the circular field.
- NOTE: the magnetic field strength due to a long wire carrying
current decreases as one over the distance.


 



 Loop of wire 
At the center of a some circular loops of wire, the strength of the
magnetic field is:



 



where is the number of loops, is a constant
(permeability of free space = ), is the
current, and is the radius of the loop.
The direction in this case can be found with the Right Hand Rule # 2.
 A long circular coil (many many loops like above in a long row) 
In the interior of a long coil (solenoid):



 



where is a constant (permeability of free space = ), is the number of loops per meter, and is the
current.
- NOTE: The strength of a magnetic field in a long solenoid is
constant throughout the interior volume.
 21.8 Ampere&apos;s Law 
This is basically just a statement of the rule for magnetic field
around a straight wire. It says that the magnetic field lines are
closed loops which surround the current. If several wires are added
side by side, you add the currents to get the total current, needed to make the magnetic field. Without calculus it is difficult
to appreciate the beauty of Ampere&apos;s law. In the end, Ampere&apos;s la
reduces to:



 



which is what we had in the last section

 21.9 Magnetic Materials 
Ferromagnetic materials: Iron, Nickel, Cobalt, Chromium Dioxide)
Materials whose atoms or molecules tend to form with adjacent electron
orbits parallel. Magnetic ``domains&apos;&apos; form in the material, which act
like little magnets (0.01 to 0.1 mm in size) Aligning some of these
domains makes the entire object like a magnet.
Induced Magnetism: when an external magnetic field is applied, domains 
in ferromagnetic materials realign themselves, making themselves
magnetic. Usually this magnetism disappears when the external field
is taken away, but sometimes in can remain (``memory&apos;&apos;) this is how
magnetic tapes and computer hard drives work.


 



What is the difference between a ``right-hand spiral&apos;&apos; and a
``left-and spiral&apos;&apos;?
A ``right-handed&apos;&apos; spiral is such that if you go clockwise, it goes
away from you. Peanut butter jar lids are right-handed, in this
sense. So are most screws and bolts.
A ``left-handed&apos;&apos; spiral is such that if you go counter-clockwise, it
goes away from you.

22.1 Induced Current in a coil in a Magnetic Field
induced emf, induced current
changing B, changing Area of coil, or changing orientation of coil
induces a current (the associated voltage is called induced emf)
Any voltage which is the cause for current through a circuit is called 
emf (historical tradition). The symbol for emf is a curly capitol E, 
the units are Volts.
The current through a circuit with total resistance due to an
emf will be:


 


(this is the same as with instead of .






 
22.2 Moving rod in a B field
QUIZ. Diagram: a vertical rod sitting in a Magnetic Field, which is
out of the page. Vertical rod has a velocity to the right.
1) Imagine the positive charges inside the rod. They will feel a
magnetic force, since they are moving to the right along with the
rod. Which way will this force be.











2) The magnetic force will generate a current in the following circuit 
(DIAGRAM), show the direction of this current.











3) Now that there is a current in the bar, there is some magnetic
force on the bar itself (force on a current-carrying wire in a
magnetic field). Which way is this force? Does it oppose the
right-ward motion of the bar or increase it?



 



``Motional EMF&apos;&apos; is a voltage or potential difference across a rod
which is moving in a magnetic field when , and are all
perpendicular:


 


where the (induced voltage across the bar) is also called the
``Motional EMF&apos;&apos; and has units of Volts.
 is the speed, is the
magnitude of the magnetic field, and is the length of the
conducting rod.
Note that it takes WORK to make this current flow. Once the current
flows, there is a force which opposes the motion, wanting to slow it
down. You have to apply a steady FORCE over a DISTANCE in order to
keep the current going. You do Mechanical Work per time, which is
converted into Power in the resistor(s) in the circuit. (this is
conceptual - no worked problems are associated with this idea)
22.3 Magnetic Flux through an area, 



 


where is the Magnetic Flux [Tesla m ] through an area ,
and is the angle between and the normal vector to the 
surface .
 may be the area within a coil or loop of current. As changes, this will induce a current through the loop. (Faraday&apos;s Law)
DIAGRAM: coil perpendicular to field, , is maximum

passes through a surface

22.4 Faraday&apos;s Law ``Electromagnetic Induction&apos;&apos;
Last time we introduced as the magnetic flux through an area . If is the area of a flat loop, or coil of loops, we can
discuss the magnetic flux through this coil.
As changes, the rate of change determines the amount of voltage 
induced in the coil:



 


where is the change in magnetic flux through one loop in 
a time , and is the number of loops in a coil.
Why is it negative? Because the voltage causes a current in the coil
which yields a magnetic force which opposes the motion of the coil.
So it always takes WORK to create a current in a coil by
electromagnetic induction.
QUIZ:
A uniform and constant (in time) magnetic field has a magnitude of
0.15 T and is perpendicular to a circular loop of wire (one turn) that 
has a radius of 0.3 m. This circle, without changing its orientation
relative to the field, is bent into a square with sides of
length 0.47 m, in a time interval of 0.22 seconds. Find the magnitude 
of the emf induced in the wire (Volts).
22.5 Lenz&apos;s Law
 The induced current in a coil produces an ``induced magnetic field&apos;&apos;.
This induced magnetic field opposes the original change in magnetic flux. 
So if the field through a loop is toward the right, and is
increasing, then the current created in the loop will be in a
direction such that its induced magnetic field will be toward the
left.

Lots of loops in a long conducting slinky = Long Coil = Solenoid = Inductor
When a constant current is being sent through a coil, it sets up a
magnetic field inside it - no resistance (or just a
small resistance due to the copper in the wire)
BUT - when the current changes, the magnetic field changes, and an
induced emf (voltage) in the wire opposes this change. This is called
``Self-Induction&apos;&apos; or just ``inductance&apos;&apos; of the coil. Inductance is
called , the S.I. units are [Henries] or [Ohms second]=[ ]

- It works both ways, in the latter case the EM-wave is transferring
its energy to the wire (the wire is absorbing radiation)
for a typical AM radio signal passing a wire, the current generated
would normally be VERY VERY low. But consider the following circuit:

In a medium such as air, or water, the speed of light is slightly less than this. Usually - the thicker the medium, the slower is .
Also, usually, the shorter the wavelength of the light, the slower is . (this wavelength-dependence of the speed leads to prisms,
rainbows, etc)
 
QUIZ.
1) The wavelength of visible light is near 500 nanometers. Find the
frequency of the variations in the EM-field due to visible light (Hz).
2) How many km does light travel in one second?
3) How many times around the Earth would light be able to travel in
one second? (Note that the radius of the Earth is 6380 km)

The Doppler Effect.
When a source of light is moving relative to an observer, the
frequency (and wavelength) of the observed light change. The new
frequency is given (in 1-D) by:



 



 approaching 
 receding 
where is the observed frequency, is the emitted, or rest
frequency. is the speed of light (wave speed) and is the
relative speed of the observer and light source. The plus sign is
used if when the observer and source are moving toward one another.
The minus sign is used when they are moving apart.
- this formula works in 1-D only - is actually the component of
the velocity along the line of sight
- is the rate of change of distance between the observer and
source (the distance the light has to travel)
- this formula works only when (much much less than). If becomes very large (significant fraction of ) all Physics changes
because we have to use Special Relativity (Einstein, Ch.28)

 example like Example 6, Ch. 24.
A police car is parked on the side of the road, and emits a radio
signal with a frequency of  Hz. The radio signal 
bounces off an approaching car, and is received back at the police
car. The signal has increased in frequency by 2100 Hz. What is the
speed of the car?
 Solution Note that the distance the radio wave (light) travels
is TWO TIMES the distance between the stopped police car and the
moving car. So if the car moves 1 meter closer, the light travels 2 fewer
meters.
So for a reflection or echo, the formula for Doppler shift becomes:



 



in our case, the car is approaching, so we have:

causes image - same size, same distance on other side of mirror, and

Law of Reflection - always applies at the microscopic level.
For practical applications, law of reflection only applies to specular reflection , ie. MIRRORS
For all other objects, light rays can reflect at any random angle.
This is diffuse refluection . The cause is that at the
microscopic level the surface is not smooth. (Whiteboard is example,
or any other object such as professor).
When you see an object (that is not glowing), there is always some light 
source providing light rays which REFLECT off that object, then end up 
in your eye.
Go over Quiz. - draw the ray in each case.
DIAGRAM















NOTE: When a dentist moves a light over a patient&apos;s mouth, those light 
rays are all focussed onto the mouth, and they then reflect off the
mouth and teeth and back up into the dentist&apos;s eye, so the dentist can 
see the teeth.


 
QUIZ 23 - Using the Law of Reflection
The drawing shows two perpendicular mirrors, one along the -axis,
and one along the -axis. A ray comes in with a direction , where is measured counter-clockwise from
the positive -direction. Sketch the double-reflection of this ray
off both mirrors, and find the direction of the final ray ( ).
DIAGRAM


















 26.1 The Index of Refraction
In materials, the speed that light travels is slower than it is in a
vacuum.



 



where is speed of light in material [m/s], is speed of light in
vacuum [m/s], and is the index of refraction [dimensionless]
Every type of transparent material has an index of refraction (for a
particular frequency of light - note, index of refraction generally
goes up as light frequency goes up - this is why rainbows and prisms
happen)
examples: Air: , water: , diamond: .


 26.2 Snell&apos;s Law of Refraction.
Light rays change direction due to reflection or refraction.
Reflection: Light bouncing off a surface.
Refraction: Light going from one medium into another, and bending it&apos;s 
path.
DIAGRAM: Wave-fronts going from . , causes change in ray
path, if ray is to be perpendicular to wave fronts.

DEMO: laser in tray of water, showing refraction.


 
26.3
When light travels from higher to lower index of refraction, the
refracted ray bends away from the normal. It can only bend to a 
maximum of 90 deg away from the normal, or it would not pass through
to the other side. The angle inside the higher material at which
the in the lower material goes to 90 degrees is called 
the critical angle.
When the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, all light is
reflected back into the higher material - ``Total Internal
Reflection&apos;&apos; The critical angle, , is given by:

Go over quiz:
A Light Ray reflecting off two perpendicular surfaces returns back in
the same direction (180 degree turn). This is true in 3-D for the
corner of a cube. Light always is reflected straight back, exactly in
opposite direction from which it came. - safety reflectors on bikes
or cars are often made of tiny cube corners, reflecting headlights
directly back to the driver.

TRANSPARENCIES Fig 26-2, 26-5, 26-10


 
NOTE: The refraction of light depends on two refractive indices.
Example:
A beam of light exits a block of ice sitting on land. Inside the ice,
the ray has an angle of 10 degrees relative to the surface of the ice.
DIAGRAM.









a) Will the ray exit the ice into the air? If so, at what angle.
b) Same question, but now the block of ice is immersed in water.
Answer: Note first that degrees, since MUST be
measured relative to the surface normal, not to the surface.
 , , 
So going from ice to air, index DROPS, so there is a chance of total
internal reflection. Check critical angle:

 
 (5)   (6) (7) 
 



Since , Total internal reflection does happen.
NOTE:
Total Internal reflection happens when Angle of incidence is GREATER
than critical angle. (in this case, 80 49.8)
b) when the block is immersed in water, it is going from lower to
higher index of refraction, so there is no chance of total internal
reflection.
Snells law gives refracted angle:

 
 (8) (9)   (10) 
 



POINT: Refraction depends on two indices of refraction. A diamond
does not look as good under water.

28.1 Special Relativity
Sound is a wave, the ``thing&apos;&apos; that is oscillating is the air - air
molecules vibrating.
If there is an 80 km/hr wind blowing toward the East, sound travels
that much faster toward the East than toward the West. By measuring
the speed of sound, we can measure our speed relative to the air.
(or if we drive in a car at 80 km/hr when there is no wind, we will
measure sound coming from behind as slower than sound waves coming
from in front.)
Light is a wave, but what is oscillating? Light travels through a
vacuum, where only the Electric and Magnetic field exist.

If we travel very fast, will we measure a change in the speed of
light? Michelson and Morley (1891) tried to measure the difference
between the speed of light East and West for different times of day.
Since the Earth is orbiting the Sun at 30 km/s, they expected to see
changes in the speed of light as the Earth rotated. - They found NO
changes. The speed of light in a vacuum is ALWAYS measured to be m/s to a very high precision, and it doesn&apos;t
depend on your speed.
This is VERY STRANGE!
So if I am traveling in a space ship at 0.9 times the speed of light,
(0.9c), and a stationary person behind me shines a flashlight at me,
and I lean out and measure the speed of that light as it passes me, I
will measure c. Even though I am already traveling forward at 0.9 c.
The stationary person with the flashlight also measures c! Who is
right? What the hell is going on?
In 1905 Albert Einstein published the special theory of relativity,
which explains it all by giving up our fixed ideas of time and space.


 



28.2 The Postulates of Special Relativity
All of special relativity is based on two assumptions:
1) All the laws of physics are the same in every intertial reference
frame.
(in other words, constant velocity is relative. No one can same ``I
am stationary, you are moving&apos;&apos;, because relative according to the
other guy, he could say ``I am stationary, you are moving&apos;&apos;.)
2) The speed of light in a vacuum is measured to be in any
inertial reference frame.
RECALL (PHYS 23): An inertial frame is one that is not accelerating or
rotating. Newton&apos;s Laws apply in inertial frames. A frame that is
moving at a constant velocity relative to an inertial frame is also an
inertial frame.
From 1) and 2), all the properties of Special Relativity can be
derived (including ).


 



28.3 Time Dilation
(kind of like pupil dilation - it ``gets bigger&apos;&apos; or stretched out for
the moving observer)
The Light Clock. Two mirrors with a short beam of light bouncing
between them. Every time the light beam bounces off a mirror, it is a
``tick&apos;&apos;, and you can keep time this way.

QUIZ 28
1. Two mirrors are 1 m apart. How long does it take light to travel
from one to another? (this is one tick.)
A gentleman with a light clock passes by in a bus at 0.5 c. We
observe the light to travel from his bottom mirror up to his top
mirror, but in this time he has moved 0.5 meters to the left.
2. How far does the light have to travel on the bus light-clock?
3. How long does one ``tick&apos;&apos; take for the bus light-clock?


 



NOTE: This gentleman&apos;s clock is slow. Also, the speed of light
determines the speed of electricity, information travel, and all
chemical reactions. So, not only has this guy&apos;s clock slowed down,
but all biological processes in his body, including aging, also slow
down.
-- the fountain of youth!!!!!
If you can travel at high speeds, you can live longer!
BUT, WAIT!!!!
What does the gentleman on the bus see?
According relativity, there is no special ``rest-frame&apos;&apos;. He may say
that he is the one at rest and you are the one moving in the other
direction. He sees that his light clock is working just fine. But
when he looks at your light clock, as you whiz by in the other
direction, he sees that your light beam appears to have further to
travel. He thinks YOUR CLOCK IS SLOW! He thinks that you are the
one aging more slowly!
Who is right? You are both right!
Time is relative!


 



Time dilation formula (derived from light-clock example on pg 869 of
text)



 



where is the time interval between events that happen at
the same place in a particular inertial frame.
 is the time interval between the same events measured in
another inertial frame in which they happen at different places.
 the relative speed between the two frames.
 is the speed of light in a vacuum.


 



Example 2, Ch 28.
Alpha Centauri is a star 4.3 light-years away. (it takes light 4.3
years to travel there). If a rocket leaves Earth at a speed of
0.95 , how much will the passengers have aged by the time they get
there.
Answer.
According to a person on the Earth, the ship travels 4.3 light years
at 0.95 . equals one light-year per year. So the rocket takes
a time: = 4.3 years / 0.95 (light-years/year) = 4.5 years
The two events in this case are 1: leaving Earth. 2: arriving at
Alpha Centauri. In the case of people on Earth, they happen at
different locations, so this is . In the case of the
travelers, these events happen at the same place (just outside their
space-ship door!!), so this is . We wish to find (the time the trip seems to take according to the travelers),
when = 4.5 years.



 





 



= 1.4 years
So if you go fast enough, you can seem to travel 4.3 light years in
only 1.3 years! You must think you are going faster than the speed of
light! BUT - relativity also predicts length contraction. Moving
things seem shorter. So, in fact, as you travel towards Alpha
Centauri, you observe the distance you need to travel to shrink. So
you think you are going 0.95 relative to the Alpha Centauri, but it
just seems much closer, only about 1.2 light years away, so it is
natural that it only takes you 1.4 years to go that distance.

 is the time interval between the same events measured in
another inertial frame in which they happen at different places.
 the relative speed between the two frames.
 is the speed of light in a vacuum.


 



NOTE: An event is something which occurs at a specific time and space
coordinate. Like a firecracker going off, or


 



Example (like Example 2, Ch 28.)
Epsilon Eridani is a Sun-like star-system 11 light-years away. (it
takes light 11 years to travel there). If a rocket leaves Earth at a
speed of 0.99 ,
a) How long will the trip take as measured by a person on Earth?
b) How long will the trip take as measured by the passengers?
Answer.
As measured by a person on the Earth, the ship travels 11 light years
at 0.99 . equals one light-year per year. So the rocket takes
a time: = 11 years / 0.99 (light-years/year) = 11.1 years
The two events in this case are 1: leaving Earth. 2: arriving at
Alpha Centauri. As measured by the people on Earth, they happen at
different locations, so this is . As measured by the
travelers, these events happen at the same place (just outside their
space-ship door!!), so this is . We wish to find (the time the trip takes as measured by the travelers),
when = 11.1 years.



 





 



= 1.56 years (19 months)
So if you go fast enough, you can seem to travel 11 light years in
only 1.56 years! You must think you are going faster than the speed
of light! BUT - relativity also predicts length contraction. Moving
things seem shorter. So, in fact, as you travel towards Epsilon
Eridani, you measure the distance you need to travel to shrink. So
you think you are going 0.99 relative to the Epsilon Eridani, but
it just is much closer in your reference frame, only about 1.5 light
years away, so it is natural that it only takes you 1.5 years to go
that distance!

Pole in Barn Paradox
Bob has a barn which is 5 m in length.
Joe holds a pole which is 10 m in length (rest length), and runs
through the barn with it at 0.95c.
Does the pole fit into the barn?
 Bob&apos;s frame (at rest relative to barn):
length of moving pole is:



 





 





 



Yes, it should fits in as Joe runs through, since the pole is now only 
3.1 m long, and his barn is still 5 m wide.
 Joe&apos;s frame (at rest relative to pole):
length of pole is still 10 m. (no change)
However, length of moving barn is:



 





 





 



No WAY! Joe still has a 10 m pole, but now he has to fit it into a
1.56 m barn, which is completely impossible from his point of view.
From his point of view, the front end of the pole is already through
the short little barn long before the back end has gone in. The pole
does NOT fit.
Who is right? Did the pole fit into the barn or not? Bob could
quickly close the front and back doors of the barn while Joe is in
there, and take a picture of Joe with his pole in the barn and win the 
bet.


 



Other results of Special Relativity:
- you cannot travel faster than the speed of light in a vaccuum, or
even at it. You can only approach the speed of light.
(this is verified every day in particle accelerators. They pump more
and more energy into those particles and they just get closer and
closer to the speed of light. The highest velocities attainable at
SLAC are around 0.999999999  . But Never, ever, ever, has anyone
measured a particle to travel at 1.01  or even . That&apos;s okay,
since it is theoretically impossible.)
- mass and energy are equivalent. The formula for equivalence is . (rest energy) SI Units. [Joules], [kg], [m/s]
(this is used by the Sun to convert its mass to energy. It is also
used in Nuclear Fission reactors, to generate electricity on Earth.
It is also used in nuclear bombs.)

the table? (use  kg, )
2. A 100-Watt light bulb, left on, uses Joules of
energy per day. How many light bulbs could be powered for one day by
this cup of water? [3 billion]


 



Mass is highly concentrated energy.
Note also that if an object is moving, its total energy is:



 



This is Einstein&apos;s formula for rest energy ( ) plus kinetic energy
of an object. It approaches as approaches . This is
why you cannot accelerate an object to speeds greater than or equal to - - it would take infinite energy!

29.2
Blackbody spectra: draw some. (radiation intensity per wavelength)
[Watts per meter per nanometer nanometer]
















Observed: peak intensity, falls of sharply for shorter, and falls of
more slowly for longer wavelengths.
Peak Intensity determined by temp - higher temp, shorter wavelength peak.
Theoretical prediction for waves: intensity should always decrease for increasing wavelength. This implies infinite energy
released at the shortest wavelengths. This was called the
``Ultraviolet Catastrophe&apos;&apos;.
Theory did not match with experiment, and, in fact, the wave theory of
light had a serious problem of predicting infinite energy at short
wavelengths.
In 1900, Planck tried the following: Assume that not any energy
could be emitted by an atom as an EM-wave, but only certain energies.
In particular:



 



where is the allowed amount of energy or absorbed from a material
to an EM Wave. [Joules]
 is an integer 0, 1, 2, 3, ....
 is the frequency of the EM Wave. [Hz]
 is the ``Planck&apos;s Constant&apos;&apos; [Joule seconds]
Planck chose this discrete energy bundle equation, and was able to
derive the shape of the blackbody spectrum EXACTLY! . That is
why the blackbody spectrum is sometimes called the ``Planck
Spectrum&apos;&apos;.
BUT Planck was not able to describe why the EM waves could only
give or take this amount of energy.


 



29.3 Photons and the Photoelectric Effect
Photoelectric Effect:
When light is shone onto a metal, electrons can be emitted by the
metal. The light is absorbed, thus imparting energy to the
electrons. The electrons must first be ``lifted&apos;&apos; out of their atomic
orbits, this takes some energy. Then, when the electrons leave the
metal with some speed, they have some kinetic energy. (they are
moving). Both the kinetic energy and the Work required to lift the
electron out of its orbit come from the light.
RESULTS:
1. When you shine monochromatic light (one wavelength) on a metal, it
must be above a minimum frequency (below a maximum wavelength) in
order for electrons to be emitted. The photoelectric effect does NOT
happen for frequencies below this cut-off.
2. The higher the frequency, the higher the kinetic energy of the
individual electrons.
3. The higher the intensity of light, the higher the NUMBER of electrons
emitted.
EXPLANATION
Light itself is not a wave, but a stream of photons, or
``light-particles&apos;&apos;. Each photon has an energy of:



 



where is the Plancks constant, and is the frequency of the
light [Hz] (what does ``frequency&apos;&apos; mean for a particle??)
Each photon has a momentum of:



 



where is the Plancks constant, and is the wavenlength of
the light [meters] (what does ``wavelength&apos;&apos; mean for a particle??)
The frequency of an EM wave is determine by the frequencies of the
individual photons. The intensity of the EM wave is determined by the
number of photons per second.


 



QUIZ 30
A HeNe Laser Pointer shines light at 632 nm, and outputs a power of Watts into the light at this wavelength.
1. What is the frequency of the HeNe photons? [Hz]
2. What is the energy of each HeNe photon? [Joules]
3. How many photons per second leave the HeNe laser? [number/second]


 



In the Photoelectric Effect, one electron is emitted for every photon
absorbed. But, in order for an electron to be emitted, the photon
must have enough energy to ``lift&apos;&apos; the electron out of its orbital.
- This explains effect 1) - a minimum frequency corresponds to a
minimum energy of photon - the energy equal to the work of lifting a
photon out of its orbital.
Also, effect 2) is explained: if the photons have higher energy, the
individual electrons they release will use the extra energy as kinetic
energy:



 



where = photon energy [Joules]
 = kinetic energy of ejected electrons.
 = ``work function&apos;&apos; = the amount of energy needed to lift the
electron out of its orbital
Also, effect 3) is also explained: since there is only one electron
released per photon, the only way to release more electrons is to
shine more photons - higher intensity light.


 



BUT: Recall Young&apos;s Double Slit experiment.
When light is shone through two slits, it interferes . This
effect is due to the wave nature of light and the superposition of and fields at the detector. You get bright and dark fringes
depending on the wavelength and angle. ( )
This proves light is a wave!!!
But we just showed that a different experiment shows that light is
composed of particles - photons.
The truth is, light is neither a particle or a wave. Light is light.
The Wave-Particle Duality - the split personality of light.
Some experiments reveal the wave-like nature of light. Some
experiments reveal the particle-like nature of light.


 



Next time: (Ch 29.5)
In 1923, a silly graduate student named Louis De Broglie decided to
try the Young&apos;s Double slit experiment with electrons.
OBVIOUSLY there should be no interference, because electrons are
``things&apos;&apos; - they are definitely particles and not waves.
The result: Interference fringes - - just like the light!
Electrons are just like light - they exhibit wave-like properties.
The same is true for protons, neutrons, baseballs, EVERYTHING.
Nothing is real, we are all waves in some Quantum Mechanical
Probability function space.

29.5
In 1923, a graduate student named Louis De Broglie decided to
try the Young&apos;s Double slit experiment with electrons.
OBVIOUSLY there should be no interference, because electrons are
``things&apos;&apos; - they are definitely particles and not waves.
APPLET - showing result.
individual electrons land at seemingly random places on the screen.
But, after enough have landed, a pattern starts to emerge.
Interference fringes - - just like the light!
Electrons are just like light - they exhibit wave-like properties.
The same is true for protons, neutrons, baseballs, EVERYTHING.
The probability that an individual electron will land at a
certain place is governed by a wave equation. As the electron
travels, the ``probability wave&apos;&apos; spreads out, goes through both slits, and then interferes on the other side. The interference
pattern is what we see as fringes.
The wavelength of a moving particle is given by:



 



where is the wavelength of the probability wave of the
particle (De Broglie wavelength), = Planck&apos;s constant. = the
particle&apos;s momentum.
(Note, this formula also works for light, where is the momentum of
the photon)


 



Example
What is the wavelength of an electron traveling at 1000 m/s?
Answer:



 





 





 



Example
What is the wavelength of a 150 gram baseball traveling at 100 km/hr?
Answer:



 





 





 



This is why baseballs do not seem to diffract around openings or past
baseball bats. The slit-size would have to be comparable to the
wavelength, or only nm.


 



QUIZ 31
1. An electron in a parallel plate capacitor speeds up as it travels
toward the positive plate. As it is speeding up, is its De Broglie
wavelength increasing or decreasing?
2. An electron and a neutron travel at the same speed. Which has a
longer De Broglie wavelength?


 



29.6 Single-slit diffraction of particles - the Heisenberg Uncertainty
principle.
DIAGRAM
slit, width , electron, momentum , .
















The electron probability wave can ``diffract&apos;&apos; when it passes through
this opening. Recall (Apr. 5 notes)
The angle of diffraction can not be much greater than , where is given by:



 



So the electron may now have a momentum which gives it a component of its velocity which causes it to go up or down by an angle .
We don&apos;t know what the electron&apos;s momentum is after it passes through
the slit. But we do know where the electron was - it passed through
the slit.
So, by going through a doorway, we learn where the electron is in the direction, but we
lose information about the momentum in the direction. We can
never know both to infinite precision. This is the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle:



 



where is the uncertainty (or error) in any momentum
measurement, is the uncertainty (or error) in the position
in this direction, and = Planck&apos;s constant.
The product of the uncertainty in position and the uncertainty in
momentum must always be greater than or equal to Planck&apos;s constant / 2 .
In addition, there is a Heisenburg uncertainty principle for energy
and time:



 



where is the energy of a particle in a certain state, and is the lifetime of the particle in this state. For
particles with very short lifetimes, their energy can never be known
to great precision.


 



Example
We know the speed of an electron is 123.23 m/s 0.01 m/s. What
is our minimum uncertainty in its position?
Answer:



 





 





 



If we know that electron&apos;s speed to a precision of 0.01 m/s, then we
cannot measure it&apos;s position to any better than 1 cm!


 



Example
We know the speed of a 150 gram baseball is 123.23 m/s 0.01 m/s.
What is our minimum uncertainty in its position?
Answer:



 





 





 



We can effectively know the speed and position of a baseball to
arbitrary precision, without noticing quantum mechanical effects.

Note to Instructor: DEMO: Hydrogen Lamp - hydrogen line spectrum -

30.1 - What&apos;s an atom?
An atom is a tiny but heavy nucleus (positive charge proportional to
number of protons) surrounded by a cloud of light electrons
(negatively charged).
A neutral atom has an equal number of electrons and protons.
Almost all the mass of an atom is in the fixed nucleus
(protons and neutrons).


 



30.2 Line spectra of atomic Hydrogen.
A free-floating hydrogen atom (in a gas of atomic Hydrogen, for
example) can only emit and absorb light at certain exact frequencies
(or wavelengths).
These frequencies correspond to the photon energies by the formula .
The energy of the photon emitted or absorbed is equal to the
difference in energies between the orbitals that the electron
``jumped&apos;&apos;
The photon energies emitted from a hydrogen gas always obey the law:



 



where is the Rydberg constant =  m , is
Planck&apos;s constant, is the speed of light, and and are
integers 1 or greater.
(note, this seems to mean that the energy of a particular orbit is


 


, but what is ?)
Since , this means that the wavelength of the light
is given by:



 



If and this is called the ``Lyman Series&apos;&apos;, and
all the wavelengths are too short to be seen with the eye:
ultraviolet.
If and , this is called the ``Balmer Series&apos;&apos;.
These lines can be seen with the human eye, so they are very famous.
NOTE: The colors of the rainbow are:
 
 R 622 - 780 nm O 597 - 622 nm Y 577 - 597 nm G 492 - 577 nm B 460 - 492 nm I 440 - 460 nm V 390 - 440 nm 
 


 



Quiz 32
1. What is the wavelength, in nm, of the first Balmer line, , ? What should be its approximate color?
2. What is and color of second Balmer line ( , )?
3. What is and color of third Balmer line ( , )?
4. Which (if any) of the above lines can you see in the spectrum of
the Hydrogen lamp? (remember, when looking through the diffraction
grating, keep ``Made in USA&apos;&apos; on the bottom; to see the spectrum, look 
off to the left of the lamp (or right). Wavelength should increase as 
angle away from the central ``zeroth&apos;&apos; order increases.)
DEMO: Hydrogen Lamp - hydrogen line spectrum - compare with the one in
the book - distribute diffraction gratings again.


 



30.3 The Bohr Model of an Atom.
So, electrons orbit around the nucleus, just like the planets orbit
around the Sun, right? Right. (Sort of)
DIAGRAM















Two problems with this:
1) By the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, if we know precisely the
momentum of the electron as it orbits the nucleus, we cannot know its
position.
2) If the electron really did travel in circles around the nucleus it
would have centripetal acceleration - thereby radiating EM waves. If
it radiated energy away like this, it would spiral in toward the
nucleus very quickly.
Bohr proposed (1913): The electron orbits are ``stationary states&apos;&apos;.
Yes, the electron has momentum, just as if it was really orbiting, but
since we can never really know its moment-to-moment position, it must
exist only as a ``probability cloud&apos;&apos; around the nucleus, not really
moving or accelerating. (therefore not emitting any EM waves)
The electron only emits or absorbs a photon when it jumps between orbits ( between stationary states)
Each state has an energy, which is determined by the properties of the 
atom and an integer, . Only discrete values of energy are
allowed, is the energy of the state.

30.3, 30.4 review:
The energy of the stationary states of an atom in the Bohr model are
labeled with an integer, . They are:



 



where is an integer, 1,2,3,4...., is the atomic number, or
number of protons in the nucleus.
For Hydrogen, , and the constants work out to:



 



This is negative energy: the electron has negative total energy when
it is in an orbit. Higher orbits have higher energy (less
negative). As , the total energy 
approaches zero.
(Transparency of Fig. 30.9)


 



30.8 The Laser
When an electron makes a transition between states from one with
HIGHER energy to one with LOWER energy, it emits a photon. This can
happen in one of two ways:
 spontaneous emission : The electron jumps down a level for no
apparent reason. The higher energy state may have some half-life, for
example, and as time elapses it becomes more and more likely that the
electron has dropped.
 stimulated emission When a photon passes by with the exact
amount of energy between a higher level and lower level of an
electron, the electron may want to jump down emit a photon which
``joins its buddy&apos;&apos; - a copy-cat photon can be emitted which has
identical wavelength, identical direction of travel, and identical
phase.
1 photon goes in - stimulates the electron to drop -
2 photons (identical) come out. - the light beam is amplified
Light Amplified by Stimulated Emission Radiation (LASER)
Normally, an atoms in a gas have more electrons in lower levels than
higher levels. Stimulated emission is only effective if a large
number of electrons are already in higher levels, ready to ``jump
down&apos;&apos;.
A gas in a laser has a ``population inversion&apos;&apos;, with more atoms in a
gas have more electrons in lower levels than higher level
DIAGRAM: laser, one end completely silvered - reflective. one end
partially silvered, partially transparent.
















A photon with the right frequency which encounters an electron in the
higher energy level will cause the atom to emit two photons (including
the original photon). These two photons will stimulate two other
atoms to each emit two photons - yielding 4. And so on! To keep the
cycle going, each end of the tube is silvered so that the in phase
photons travel back and forth between the ends, always stimulating
more photons. One mirror is partially silvered so that the photons in
the laser are allowed to escape.
HeNe Lasers use the Helium energies to sustain a population inversion
in Neon. Neon has a state 20.66 eV above the ground state which
gathers a higher population than the state which is 18.70 eV. The
energy difference is 1.96 eV:

30.9 Medical applications of the Laser
Laser light is: monochromatic - all the light is at one exact
frequency or wavelength or color.
a narrow beam - allowing for precision focussed work
If a particular kind of tissue can absorb at this frequency, then an
intense, sharp laser beam can be used to destroy small amounts of this
tissue.
For example, the cornea absorbs well at  nm, so a laser
can be used to cleanly and precisely destroy small amounts of the
outermost surface of the cornea without damage to underlying layers
(such as the retina) - this is corrective eye surgery - which is why
Weird Al Yankovich no longer wears glasses.

31.3 Binding Energy of a nucleus
TRANSPARENCY
It takes energy to break apart a nucleus.
 (a result of Special Relativity).
So, when breaking a nucleus apart into its constituent neutrons and
protons, you must add energy - as you do this you add MASS.

(  kg)

where is the speed of light in a vacuum.
Other useful numbers:
mass of a proton = 1.0073 
mass of a neutron = 1.0087 
mass of an electron = 0.000549 


 



EXAMPLE

31.4 Radioactivity
Historically, we were able to detect high energy particles long before 
we knew what they were. It was not even recognized fully that these
were particles, and so called ``rays&apos;&apos;. Rays from space were called
``cosmic-rays&apos;&apos;
Magnets have been around a long time and experiments were done to pass 
various types of radiation through a magnetic field. 3 different
things were observed to happen:
















Rays veered left ( rays )
Rays veered right ( rays )
Rays went straight through, with no deflection by the magnetic field 
( rays )
All were named after the first 3 letters of the Greek alphabet.
Why might this happen?? RHR# 1. Q: Are positive or negative?
Q: Beta? Q: Gamma? This is neutral!
TRANSPARENCY Fig 31.8 - the answer.
The three most common forms of naturally occuring, possibly harmful
radiation are:
1) fast-moving Helium nuclei (stripped of their electrons) 
- these are positive `` rays&apos;&apos; or, particles!
2) fast moving electrons (these are negative) `` rays&apos;&apos;
3) high energy (high frequency, or very short wavelength) EM
radiation, or photons. `` rays&apos;&apos; (neutral, no deflection in a 
magnetic field)


 



A nucleus can undergo decay by releasing two protons and two
neutrons together (a Helium nucleus).
A nucleus can undergo decay by releasing an electron. This
happens when a neutron in the nucleus decays and becomes a proton.
The element gets one extra proton this way, while conserving atomic
mass number.
A nucleus can emit energy by changing its internal energy ``state&apos;&apos;.
When this happens, a very high energy photon is usually released - in
the MeV range - or picometer wavelength. (  m) Such a
photon exists in the Gamma part of the EM spectrum (shortest
wavelength, even shorter than X-ray)


 



Note that associated every particle has a corresponding
``anti-particle&apos;&apos;. This is a particle with the same mass, but in
every other way is completely opposite to the original particle. This
is anti-matter.
For example, an anti-proton has negative charge. An anti-electron has 
positive charge (equal to that of a proton). Anti-electrons have a
special name: positrons. (since they are positive)
When an electron is emitted (classic decay), this is often
called decay, since the emitted particle is negative.
When a positron is emitted, this is called decay (same mass 
particle is emitted, but opposite charge)


 



Electrons and neutrinos are a kind of particle called ``leptons&apos;&apos;.
Protons and Neutrons are a different kind of particle, called
``baryons&apos;&apos;. When a nuclear reaction occurs, baryon number and lepton
number must both be conserved. When a neutron decays into a proton,
it emits an electron. This is creation of a lepton, so an anti-lepton
must also be created in order to conserve lepton number. The
anti-lepton in this case is an anti-neutrino. In decay, a
regular neutrino is usually emitted, in order to conserve lepton number.

The corresponding Anti-particles:

There are two main types of particles:
Hadrons (proton and neutron are examples)

In a nuclear reaction mass/energy must be conserved, and charge must
be conserved. In addition, lepton number must also be 
conserved.
When a neutron beta decays to a proton, an electron is also created,
in order to conserve charge. In order to conserve lepton
number, a neutral ANTI-Lepton is created: an anti-neutrino

Geiger Counter Demo (31.9)
The wand contains a gas-filled cylinder with a high-voltage DC wire in
the center. When a high-energy radiation particle ( , or ) enters the cylinder, it causes atoms in the gas to be
ionized (electrons knocked off). The electrons create current which
feeds into a speaker, creating a ``click&apos;&apos;.
This can be used to measure Bq of a source.


 



Ch. 32 up to 32.4
Just as in a geiger counter, a high-energy particle can ionize many
other particles when it is absorbed. Molecules can be ionized, and
their structure can be altered. If enough molecules in a cell are
changed by a radiation particle, it can kill the cell.
Amount of radiation absorbed is measured in either charge/mass
(roentgen), or energy/mass (gray, or ``rad&apos;&apos;). The formulae are:



 



where is charge in Coulombs and is the mass of the sample in
kg.
or



 



To convert to rad, .
Also, there is a measure of radiation which specifically gives how
much damage can be caused to human skin tissue:



 



One human absorbing one roentgen of ionizing radiation has received
approximately one rem (Roentgen Equivalent Man).
You should probably not absorb more than about 1/2 a rem per year, to
stay healthy.


 



Radiation is all around you.
The important ones:
Radon. ( 200 milli-rem per year)
Radon is a gas which is released naturally by the Uranium in
the Earth&apos;s soil. It has a half-life of 3.83 days. It decays, which is not important if it is out in the air. particles don&apos;t travel very far. But if you inhale radon, and it is
in your lung when it decays, that particle, and the
radioactive nuclei left behind by the original Radon nucleus do
serious damage to your lung and blood cells.
We always breath Radon.
Natural and Man-made sources of radiation which always surround us.
( 100 milli-rem per year)
Dental X-rays X-rays are high energy photons ( particles) They
can be ionizing in human tissue, causing radiation damage. ( 40
milli-rem per year)
Cosmic Rays. Absorbed by the atmosphere and deflected by the global
magnetic field of the Earth. When you travel in an airplane it
radiation levels go up significantly. Space travel is very hazardous
for this reason. ( 30
milli-rem per year)
Long term effects: Cancer, general degradation of DNA in cells.

RBE = Relative Biological Effectiveness.
Different types of radiation can do different amounts of bad damage to 
human tissue when absorbed. This is measured by RBE. By definition,
200 keV X-rays have an RBE=1. Also, -rays and -rays
(electrons) have RBE of about 1. Protons and particles can
do a lot more damage to your cells, so their RBE values are up around
10-20.
You calculate biologically equivalent dose (in rems) from the
radiation Energy absorbed, dose (in rad) times RBE.
Recall
1 rad = 0.01 Joule/kg absorbed
biologically equivalent dose [rem] = dose [rad] RBE

32.2 Nuclear Reactions (already discussed)
nucleon number is conserved
charge is conserved
lepton number is conserved
 
There is a new notation for this, which is shorthand. You write:
First Nucleus ( added particle, created particle ) Final Nucleus.
For example,



 



is written:



 



since (an particle) is added, and a proton is
produced.

32.3 Nuclear Fission (splitting one big nucleus into two smaller)
If you bombard a nucleus with a neutron, it
instantly becomes unstable to many decays, such as:



 



(check that this works)











the that is released carries ENERGY or HEAT.
the neutrons that are released can collide with other nuclei, setting off a chain reaction. This is called a nuclear
fission bomb - very dangerous. But it must be started by a focused
flux of neutrons - you can&apos;t accidentally set off a nuclear bomb.
By controlling the input of neutrons, you can carefully stabilize the
fission reaction - this is a nuclear reactor - power plant.
Energy is produced, since mass is lost. This creates heat, which
boils water and turns a turbine. This turbine is connected to a
magnet near some coils, and uses Electromagnetic Induction to create
AC power - electricity.
Unfortunately, when you split Uranium you get some nasty isotopes of Barium,
Krypton, Strontium, etc, many of which are radioactive, difficult to
get rid of, with half-lives of thousands of years. - Radioactive
Waste. Nuclear Fission Power is NOT very clean


 



32.5 Nuclear Fusion (forcing together two nuclei (Hydrogen) onto one
(Helium))
The basic fusion reaction (simplified) is:



 



It turns out that when two heavy Hydrogen nuclei form a Helium
nucleus, the final mass is less . So energy is released in the
form of 
This is how the Sun works.
We have been able to make this reaction work on Earth, but we cannot
control it. It is the Hydrogen fusion bomb.
If we could control it, Fusion energy would be very clean. The only
waste product is Helium and some neutrons.

of a particular isotope a sample had when it was formed ( ), and
we can measure activity to find present day , we can solve for in the above equation as follows:
solve for :



 



take the natural logarithm ( ) of both sides. Use the fact that:
