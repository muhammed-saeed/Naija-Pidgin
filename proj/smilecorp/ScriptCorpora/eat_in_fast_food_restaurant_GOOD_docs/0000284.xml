Thanks again for the great pizza!!! -Mary Andrus, Fort Smith 
I would like to say that Eureka Pizza is our family&apos;s favorite! We have 4 children and one on the way and we can always please everyone for under $25! And that is a task with so many different children and different tastes!
My husband and I love the Bacon Cheeseburger pizza. It is the best ever! It is probably my #1 craving right now during this pregnancy! We will never get tired of Eureka. With the prices of everything going up right now, it is great to see that you all are not trying to raise prices. That is something we can count on! Thank You Eureka Pizza!

We always order from Eureka. They have the best pizza for a good price.
 ~Nicole&amp;Charles Rickey, Siloam Springs 

 
Dear Rolf,
Being a stay at home mom to two little girls and one very hungry husband, we have to try and find creative and save ways to save money when eating out. I can only handle so much cooking and after all, a woman needs a break now and then!
Each and every time we visit out local Eureka Pizza on Zero Street in Fort Smith, we get not only a great value, but also quality. Our pizzas are always hot and appetizing. We&apos;ve visited other chains and by the time we arrived home with our meal, it did not look like something we wanted to eat. This is not true with Eureka. Thank you so much for providing our family the &apos;break&apos; of getting to eat out every once in a while without breaking our budget. I am blessed with the opportunity to stay home with my children and businesses like yours who appreciate the value of a dollar make it a lot easier. The addition of the VIP club makes this go even farther since we can earn free food every time we visit! Wonderful idea! Thank you so much! -Amanda Johnson


 I like the service. It was good and they were very friendly and very nice to me. Yes, I will be back again, and thank you.
 ~Sandra Faye Clark, Bentonville 

We hadn&apos;t purchased Eureka Pizza in a while. The flavor was delicious and the crust reminded us of what we have been missing. We love the thick pan crust. Our old pizza place went out of business and we were searching for a new pizza place. After 5 others we selected your, we will always be back!
 -Deborah Dalton, Bentonville 

This is the best pizza we have had. It was a deep dish Gourmet - extra cheese Supreme - good, ~Charles&amp;Pat John,

Excellent Pizza and great service.

Riley - a very nice young man and friendly! Explained&quot;tree giveaway&quot;A GREAT idea from your company! ~Natalie Pomeroy, Fayetteville 

I appreciate you alls willingness to give the customer the choice in getting the type of toppings asked for... ~ Patsy Holder, Springdale
 
I love your sauce and low prices. Send me more coupons. The Bailout Deal with 3 pizzas and Cheese Sticks and soda was a great deal. ~Melissa Williams, Springdale 

Employees have such a great attitude it&apos;s refreshing in comparisom to other places. The girl working was so sweet and the guy delivering drives much better than the Mazzio&apos;s person. ~Kaycee Mason, Siloam Springs 
 Eureka Pizza has the best pizza in town. Every time I order a pizza I&apos;m greeted with friendly smiling faces every time. Their delivers are great to, every time when I have my pizza delivered to my door I am greeted with a friendly smiling face and a hot fresh pizza that just came out of the oven. So when you wont a good hot fresh pizza that tastes great. Go to Eureka Pizza were you will be greeted by the friendly staff and you feel welcome every time you go there. I know I sure do.  Sincerely, Rose Neal 
 
Hello
Let me start by saying my husband and I love your pizza. With the economy the way it is, eating out is a treat for us, and we ALWAYS order our pizza from Eureka. We love the pizza, love the service, and love the emails! We have always preferred local businesses rather than large chains, and Eureka is the picture of perfection in &apos;small&apos; businesses! You always have great deals, great food, and great employees! Even the ads make us smile! You all are doing a great job and are very much appreciated! Keep up the good work! –Chris Mason 
 
 I can remember growing up, we would get treated to Eureka Pizza once a 
 month. My mom would always get pizza on payday. We all looked forward to 
 the 1st of the month. Now, my kids love pizza and I try to get it for them 
 as much as possible. They love Eureka Pizza. Every time we drive by Eureka 
 Pizza or see a delivery driver for them, my kids spot it every time. You 
 know its good if a 2 and 4 year old can tell the difference. -Sandra Ward - Fayetteville 
   

 
Dear Rolf,
I thought it was interesting that, in your latest article, you talk about your son, Max, and also about being an Eagle Scout. I have attached a picture of my son, Max Wilkinson, at his Eagle Scout Court of Honor. The ceremony was a couple of weeks ago. I have also emailed you the article about his project last fall. The attached picture is of Max, a friend, Brent Houston, and Max&apos;s little brother Hunter. Hunter crossed over last year from Webelos to Boy Scouts. His favorite food is Eureka cheese pizza. He eats it several times a week and won&apos;t eat another brand! Our favorite vacation destination is Destin, Florida. We wish that you would put a store there. Thank you, Burt Wilkinson

 
 Eureka pizza is the only pizza we order...Seriously fresh and affordable, and being a local company we know they care about the locals. Even before times were hard all over EP Made having a pizza treat affordable for our family with the VIP and great pizza deals. I don&apos;t even bother looking at other pizza places, quality is not there and price does not compare. Thanks to eureka I can afford to treat my family and my son has one pizza all by himself...(That’s why he gets to go pick them up- he can do a little work if he wants it and usually cannot control himself on the way home) yep growing boy! When wanting the best…forget the rest and just call eureka pizza...Fast, affordable and yummy. -Sandy Umber, Springdale   
As a chaplain for John Brown University, I have always been impressed at the price, speed and quality of the pizza I have purchased, from time to time, for the students that I support in the evenings. It doesn&apos;t matter which store I have ordered from, the pizza is always hot and ready for pickup at the time that was promised over the phone. The staffs at all the NW Arkansas stores care about doing whatever is necessary to make the customer happy, even if it means providing extra things like paper plates, napkins or cayenne pepper spice. While this might seem like a small thing, it really makes a difference for people who have worked all day then have an additional 4 hours to spend in class. It is a blessing to know that I can rely on Eureka Pizza to provide a quality product at a cost that my budget can afford. Blessings! 
 -Steve McClain   Thank you, thank you! I am a regular customer and visit at least 3 times a month. I received a VIP coupon in the mail. I called in my order and the employee, Matthew, was so nice. I can&apos;t believe how much food I got for $19.99! WOW! Great Price 4 pizza! -Robert Graham, Bentonville 
  I&apos;ve been on your card before but my mind hasn&apos;t changed. ;-) Eureka Pizza is the absolute best deal for the money around. Ate at Chic-fil-A the other day and paid more for 3 sandwiches (simple ones) than I would have for your pizza. Your pizza has the best flavors; they are so good you just want to roll around on them!!! ;-) Eureka is very aptly named for when you eat it you want to shout EUREKA!! 
 - Ann Coody/Springdale 
 

   
 I have enjoyed Eureka Pizza for years. Several times as a management person, I have ordered Eureka Pizza for our employees because it was always a good quality product at an extremely reasonable price. It has always been the best deal for the money.
 I went to Eureka Pizza during the holidays when they were collecting the canned goods for the needy. I was impressed w/ the offer of a pizza for, if I remember correctly, .99cents and a canned good. There were sooooo many people lined up at the Springdale location, it was unbelievable. The table holding the canned goods was over-flowing. It was so nice to see one of our successful local companies making such a contribution to those less fortunate. While I was there, more employees were showing up to help make pizzas. I&apos;m sure these people had to be called in (I don&apos;t think anyone expected that kind of response). It&apos;s a good feeling to see such compassion from the employees who came in to help (probably on their time off) and the company for making such an offer. What a fine company to have in our local area! 
 -Sincerely, Kachina Edgmon 
 
 
My son and I are big pizza eaters. We eat pizza at least 3 times a week.
Back in the 80s when I was in high school, I thought the best pizza in the world was
God Fathers Pizza. That was the only pizza I would eat back then, despite all the other pizza places. When they left the area, I didn’t think I would find another to replace them. When Eureka Pizza came to town I was hoping for something better then what we already had here. I was so amazed!! The pizza was fantastic. It was the best tasting pizza I have eaten in many, many years. It’s the only pizza we eat now. The quality of the ingredients, the crust, and of course the taste is what got me hooked. Every time we pass a Eureka Pizza place..We all sing the song from the commercial.
We have our own little motto now when it comes to pizza....

When it comes to pizza..theres no doubt,
EUREKA PIZZA, is what its all about,
Forget the others..and what you think you know,
EUREKA PIZZA is the only way to go!!
 GO PIZZAAAAAA!!!   -JIM in Fort Smith

Hi Rolf
 I just wanted to drop you a note to tell you a couple of things. Every time we have used you guys for our employee appreciation dinners everyone really seemed to enjoy the pizzas very much. The buy one get two is such a great deal and makes it so much easier to feed our whole department. Also, we can have such a huge variety of choice for everyone we can make everyone happy from the meat lovers to the vegetarians.
The newsletter is a wonderful idea for your friends (which we all feel like we are your friend) to stay in touch with all the things you have going on. Heck, the only thing you need to do now is build a drive-in movie here in town and we can all get together and really party ,movies and pizza what else could you hope for!!!!  Keep up the good work and you should know…….“when we choose pizza, it’s always Eureka!!!!!” -thanks,  Sherri

The Buy 1 Get 2 FREE deal is fantastic, and the new Gourmet menu has given us one of the greatest pizza creations of all time with Mediterranean Chicken. Flavorful crust, two sauce choices (tangy tomato or pesto) and just the right amount of cheese and toppings provide the perfect combination for the best pizza around. Believe it or not, I&apos;m talking with someone every day about Eureka Pizza. I&apos;ve been told to&quot;shut up&quot;more than once, but I can&apos;t stop! I love racking up rewards points for free pizza, too. One word sums it all up.....WOW! 
-James, Sharla, Ashley and Emily Scott, Fayetteville AR We moved to Arkansas, from California, last October. We have searched and searched for a good pizza. I think we have tried a new pizza every week. All we wanted was a pizza that compared to the pizza we had in California.

We totally love it and will now become their best customers!

 -Derek Ballance, Rogers AR

 We ordered you new pizza, it was really really good. -Ginny Goodsell, Springdale AR This message is for Rolf. It seems most business owners appear to their customers as being&quot;Snooty, High Brow and down right Arrogant.&quot;At least that&apos;s how I view them from their commercials. They want you to think that they are&quot;Really Something Special&quot;. But Rolf... after seeing your last flyer on my latest pizza boxes (you know the one with you in the straight jacket screaming your brains out) I have come to realize that you aren&apos;t afraid of getting your hands dirty just like the rest of us. I can see the passion you have for your customers in your face and I can taste it in your product. It might seem crazy to other business owners to sell Hot, Delicious and Fresh (Large) pizza&apos;s for $6 a piece but you know what? That&apos;s not the work of a crazy man...That is the cleverness of a Genius! 
-David Tartar Joplin Missouri 

Great pizza, best in town, Cheese Burger is our favorite.
 -Bob Wills, Fort Smith, AR

Great Service! Great People! Great Food!

 I love your Cheese Sticks! YUM :)
 -Holly Gobin, Webb City MO 
   Our VBS has served your pizza for years. We are pleased with cost, quality, and service.
 -First Indian Baptist, Tahlequah OK I am originally from the north (yup a real Yankee) and grew up on Chicago style pizzas. Though I love living in the south and most definitely don&apos;t miss the hard cold winters of the northern states I did miss what I classified as&quot;real&quot;pizza. I missed the snap of the hot cheese, the tangy sweetness of the tomato sauce, and the hearty meatiness of the pizzas of my childhood memories.... that was until I found Eureka&apos;s Pizza! You guys just keep on getting better and better! It goes without saying that your 3 for 1 deals are the best in town, but what pleases my sense of a&quot;real&quot;pizza most is the addition of more cheese on your pizzas, and the large selection of healthy organic toppings. You have combined the hospitality of the south with the great pizzas of the north, and thrown in value for the money spent... Who could ask for more?
 -JoLynne Fisher, Fayetteville, AR   Just moved to Tahlequah, OK and I’ve tried pizzas in two other places and we were very dissatisfied. Saw Eureka Pizza Advertised in the local paper, so we decided to try it. It was excellent. That thin crust was fabulous and that Specialty was out of this world. We know where we will be buying our pizzas’at, Eureka Pizza. Keep up that excellent job!
 -Sally C Stoops, Tahlequah OK 

Dear Eureka Pizza, I believe Eureka Pizza is the best pizza in the city because of all the deliciousness of the pizza itself. Such as the pizzas amazing crust its so wonderful....I love how you use grains in your crust, which makes the pizza a good food for you to eat. Especially Eureka Pizzas&quot;pizza&quot;, it also has the right amount of sauce on every pizza unlike some of those other pizza restaurants. The sauce also has so much flavors that it like totally blows everyone&apos;s minds and makes them want more of your delicious pizza. Even all the yummmmmmy cheeses and tasteful toppings are all so good. Thank you Eureka Pizza you are the best pizza in the city ever! Everyone on my family loves you!!!!!!!! Love, -Jennifer Guess, Elkins AR Eureka Pizza is the one pizza company I can count on to provide delicious pizza without the typical stomach distress and/or acid reflux from the highly processed pizza of the other chains. You guys helped get me through a tough senior year in college while working and doing other various projects as I couldn&apos;t stand cooking in my little one bedroom apartment and you made it an easy choice - especially on busy weekends. As long as a phone was close by, it didn&apos;t matter how busy I was or what time it was, a quick phone call and one of your friendly drivers would show up, regardless of challenging weather conditions, with a Eureka, Meat Fest, or Cheeseburger, always more than one! I&apos;ve forgotten the name of the driver, but, for a few months I was ordering so much pizza the individual brought me all three pizzas for my patronage. That&apos;s service that will always bring consumer loyalty! Just wanted to mention all of this because Eureka Pizza became a weekly part of my life during that busy time and I want to thank you for that. In addition, something I didn&apos;t even mention was that by purchasing your pizza over competitive pizza chains, the total savings that year alone could&apos;ve paid for an entire year of college education! 
Jesse Hopkins, Bentonville AR   Eureka Pizza is #1 in the world!
 -Dave M, Neosho MO 

Great Staff! Fair price! People assured me I had what I needed before I left.
 -Steve McClain, Fayetteville AR

 -Susan Fraser, Fort Smith AR 

Ready on time - hot and loaded with toppings, employee was very nice.
 -Frances Layne, Fort Smith AR 

Your new white sauce is terrific -our pizzas (Chicken&amp;Spinach) were perfect. Thanks for the gift card! - Karla Hyde, Fayetteville AR 

Awesome tasting pizza, awesome customer service, awesome pizza prices. 
Dawn Hawking, Bentonville AR 

We like Eureka Pizza because it’s good. Also, its easy on our pocketbooks. With the high gas prices, we still make sure we can get Eureka Pizza, But the most important thing about Eureka Pizza. It’s a good company. It cares for its customers.
 Pat W Puetone, Tahlequah OK 


 
Eureka Pizza, what can I say? It reaches out and grabs me every time I drive by. The sign out front that says $6 Pizza&quot;hot&quot;and&quot;ready&quot;- WOW Pizza is a separate food group for our family and always has been. David 26, now married - still loves Pizza, especially the alfredo; Greg, 21 has a new trick - he shakes P. Cheese over all the pizza left overs so no one else will eat it. That leaves more for him. Gary, my husband just eats whatever he can get his hands on first and I have my own little secrets as well, Eureka gladly adds a little extra sauce&quot;just for me&quot;. When I ask for it - they really do it. That&apos;s why I keep going back. They&apos;re honest, hot, and the way I like them. Extra Sauce and Well Done!
 Debbie Kenny, Joplin, MO 

 I have chosen Eureka Pizza now for yrs. Each time I have placed a order the pizza has been Hot and made to order as I have placed the order. My family of 4 usually has visitors and friends over when we get Eureka Pizza and the value that we receive - Quality, Price, and Quantity have far outweighed your competitions product and offers. I really enjoy your pizza, keep up the exceptional work.
 Tim Campbell,West Fork , AR 

I just heard about this testimonial contest from a co-worker and we both knew it was screaming my name. I love Eureka pizza! I am 20 and live on my own and your buy 1 get 2 free deal is a fabulous deal for me because it is so cheap and is more than one meal. I can eat pizza for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I work on campus, and live just down the road from Eureka pizza and it is an ongoing joke that I eat pizza every meal. I only buy Eureka pizza because I love the crust and I can reheat and it still tastes yummy, plus it&apos;s fits my budget. I love canadian bacon, but I also love the Chicken Florentine. So thanks for making great pizza and making it affordable!! 
Amy Kerr, Fayetteville, AR

   
 have got to thank Eureka Pizza for saving our big family christmas dinner. Things had been pretty hectic for everyone last year, we planned the date and reserved the club house. When we all started to arrive, we realized that no one was bringing food!! Due to the fact that we had forgotten to plan who was bringing what. With all the decorations done and the club house paid for we were in a bit of a quagmire ...until I found my eureka pizza coupons. We ordered around 10 pizzas and all the out of towners were amazed--then slightly saddened because there were no left overs to take home! So thank you again you wonderful pizza makers!! 
Hailey Lahman, Neosho Mo

 I had never had Eureka Pizza before this week. At my job, our physician medical director was buying Pizza for our staff and he asked us to order from Eureka Pizza, Grand Avenue in Fort Smith AR. He said he liked Eureka&apos;s best. Everyone commented on what GOOD pizza it was. I have always been a Pizza Hut person, but will go to Eureka from now on. Some of the comments from the group who enjoyed it were:&quot;Great Taste&quot;&quot;Not Sodium Loaded&quot;&quot;Homemade Taste&quot;

My family has tried all the pizza places in our surrounding town and the only place we like to call our own is EUREKA!!! Nothing else can compare.For a family of 7 we get the Family special and that feeds everyone and we still have some left over.We love the Eureka&amp;Cheeseburger they are the best! You are #1 in our house! Rita Williams, Watts OK
 
I like Eureka Pizza because you get a fabulous deal. You are always told,&quot;You get what you pay for&quot;; however, there are always exceptions. I truly believe that the quality and taste of Eureka Pizza is just as good as those higher priced places, and we all know who they are. I can feed my family of three for under $20, with lots of leftovers for the next day. And who doesn&apos;t like leftover pizza the next day. Rolf, please keep up the good work...and may your mother live to be 81 years old! Sincerely,
 Ann L. Brown Gentry, AR 
   My son just finished 3rd Grade and he loves Eureka Pizza. At his school, Liberty Elementary, we have a program called Math Facts. This is where the children take math tests and if they pass with a 100%, they move to the next level. With this program, all the children move at their own level. He started this program in 1st grade. To give him a little encouragement, his dad and I said we would buy at least 3 Eureka Pizzas every time he passes a test. He has the opportunity to pass once a week. Sometimes once a week, we have had 3 Eureka Pizzas. He just finished the 3rd Grade and won the award for being on the highest level in his grade (4-8). This means he is on the last 4th grade level. This means in the last 3 years he has got Math Facts Eureka Pizza 32 times. Three pizzas 32 times is 96 pizzas. This doesn&apos;t include our regular family Eureka Pizza outings. My youngest son is 3 years old and everyday when Jacob comes home Jackson ask&quot;Did you pass your Math Facts?&quot;He knows if Jacob passes we get Eureka Pizza. This was such a wonderful reward that I also rewarded my 1st grade class with 6 Eureka Pizzas for the past two years. Eureka Pizza is not just a Place to get Pizza but a part of our everyday conversation. All his friends at school, his teachers, his grandma, grandpa, aunts and uncles know he wants to pass Math Facts so he can get EUREKA PIZZA! Thanks for the Affordable and Enjoyable encouragement for my son. My son loves Eureka Pizza the best. So we used that love to help him pass his test. A healthy little bribe never hurt anyone. A reward for passing the most is what he won. We&apos;ve bought 96 pizzas but that&apos;s alright. My whole family has enjoyed every bite. So Thank You we say again and again. We consider you to be a very close friend. Carrie Keith, Muldrow OK Eureka Pizza has the best pizza for the money. I can&apos;t eat alot of pizza, since it gives me heart burn. Eureka Pizza doesn&apos;t though. I also love their chicken wings, I have to order them every time I order pizza. I think it&apos;s great that they do offer a lot more options then just there pizza!
 Mary Frost, Rogers AR   For me it is simple. I prefer Eureka Pizza because it is good, cheap and convenient. I&apos;ve never had a bad experience when ordering Eureka Pizza. They always taste good and I receive the same great tasting pizza every time fast. 
Donna Ramsfield, Fayetteville AR I work a full time job and also a part time job one evening a week. My husband gets up at 3:00 AM to go to work. He doesn&apos;t feel like starting supper when he gets home. I have a son in college that comes home for the occasional weekend and during the summer and when he&apos;s home there are usually at least 3 other young men visiting. Sometimes a wife and mom just gets tired of having to figure out what to make for dinner every night. Especially when you always here the same answer; I don&apos;t care what you make. Why do I always have to be the one to&quot;make&quot;. It is wonderful to have Eureka Pizza do the&quot;making&quot;once in awhile. Or when I get that phone call at work 5 minutes before I&apos;m walking out the door,&quot;Bring home pizza and by the way Patrick, Taylor and Julio are over too.&quot;There is no better pizza or better value than Eureka Pizza. I can call in my order and it&apos;s hot and fresh waiting for me to pick it up on my way home. Thank you Eureka Pizza, for giving mom a break once in a while and I don&apos;t have to take on another part time job to pay for the pizza either. 
Jackie Casson, Rogers AR   I have 4 boys ages 3, 6, 8, and 11 and they LOVE Eureka Pizza. We have a once-a-month tradition of&quot;Eureka and a Movie&quot;where we crowd around the tube with a three classic deal for the boys (cheese, sausage and hamburger) and a deluxe for my hubby and myself. Now, feeding a large hungry husband and 4 energetic boys could get costly, but with Eureka, we can do it every month! If they had it their way though, we would have it every weekend. Thanks Eureka for making&quot;yummy&quot;affordable for my guys and our family night!
 Katie Charlton, Miami OK 

I have been eating Eureka Pizza from day One, I think. I have seen it grow and, though I never thought it possible, get better. The new Specialty Pizzas are incredibly delicious. I always loved the thin crust buy one get two free pizzas but boy oh boy, these new pizzas are the best. I have never been disappointed whether it be delivery and super hot pizzas (never cold or barely warm like some other delivery places) or pick up-the same temperatures. Just can&apos;t say enough about these pizzas. I also have what is called The Ride Card. This entitles me to free bread sticks. I have never been disappointed in this product either. No getting around it....Eureka Pizza is definitely the BEST and has been chosen by the people for many years as the best in the area. Keep up the good work, Rolf. We love it.
 Bobbye Beecher, Fayetteville AR Your new pizza is the best! Besides price, the taste is just superior to other pizza chains. The cheese is cheesier, the sauce is smoother and the crust....mmmmm...the crust! I don&apos;t even have to ask my family where they want their pizza from, it&apos;s a no brainer that every time its Eureka! For a family on a budget, the 3 for 1 is the way to go! Thank you again for providing such a great product at such a great price! Amanda Johnson, Arkoma OK   When I first heard about Eureka Pizza, I remember thinking that it couldn&apos;t possibly be very good for the price, but when you&apos;re a full time student with a limited budget for Friday nights, I figured I&apos;d give it a try. My first purchase was slow and the pizzas weren&apos;t ready when they said they would, but without my saying a word or complaint, they gave them to me for free! I was surprised at the quality and taste of the pizza, and decided I liked it much more than Dominos, and more than Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. So, for the last year, I haven&apos;t ordered anything but Eureka Pizza. The promotional deals and coupons for the free tasty cheese sticks have kept me happy and my friends from having to think up cheap ways to feed the group. Thanks Eureka Pizza for letting me and my friends eat well on weekends for a small price! -Matt McNelley University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR Every Friday at our company is Pizza Friday. We are adding on to our shop and office and have had several construction workers here during lunch on Friday&apos;s, not to mention our employees. In order to accommodate everyone, we started trying Eureka Pizza because their prices couldn&apos;t be beat for the amount of people we were feeding. To our amazement, the pizza was actually very good! The favorites seem to be the Cheese sticks with Ranch Dressing and The Deluxe Specialty Pizza (Bacon Cheeseburger). It&apos;s a consensus that the mustard, pickles, onions and bacon are the right touch and definitely unique on a pizza! For those of you who haven&apos;t tried it - do it! Pam Bunch, Rogers AR   Thursday. That&apos;s our pizza day. Every single week - AND ONLY Eureka Pizza will do! I am mom of 3 teen and pre-teen kids and they ONLY ever ask for Eureka Pizza. It&apos;s fresh, fast and FUN! The price is just right for any budget and the service has always been the best (we have been eating at the one on Leverett for YEARS!)! Oh and I guess I must admit - Thursday is OUR pizza day...but there are 6 other days of the week to fill and when mom doesn&apos;t care to cook we travel to our favorite place - EUREKA PIZZA!!!!
 Teresa Taylor, Fayetteville AR I have three teenager and a 5 year old who eat all the time. When I don&apos;t feel like cooking for and Army calling Eureka is a life saver!! I get fabulous tasting pizza and a lot for my money. In the end I have 4 kids who have full bellies and my kitchen doesn&apos;t look like a nuclear bomb has gone off. Thanks Eureka!!! Shannon Tucker Springdale AR   I absolutely love the new Eureka Pizza and so does my family. The organic sauces and the awesome crust is just delectable. We eat your pizza at least twice a week and always look forward to it. When I tell my family that we are ordering out Eureka Pizza is always their first request.
 Rebecca Shields, Joplin MO Eureka Pizza is the BEST! Where else can you get fantastic pizza, to feed a family of 7, for under $20! This pizza is top notch. Top quality food for a low budget price. GREAT Pizza, GREAT price. Who wouldn&apos;t love it!
 Jodeana Lewis, Orongo, MO   My family has bought Eureka Pizza almost every week for several years. We love the pizza the price can&apos;t be beat and you are the only place we know of that delivers in our area. My favorite is the double pepperoni and my husband loves the Canadian bacon mushroom and onion my sons go for the sausage and mushroom. Friday night is pizza night and any night i am tired and don&apos;t feel like cooking is also pizza night. Your pizza is the best!!!! Tonya Pierce, Fayetteville AR I have lived in Fort Smith for 4 years. In which time I have had the chance to eat a lot of pizza. Normally when I order from other pizza places I will usually get a specialty pizza. One thing I love about Eureka is you have a huge variety of specialty pizzas. Not just meat lovers and so on. I have to say that my favorite is the Cheeseburger Pizza. I won&apos;t order from anyone else in town. You guys are great! 
Amanda Medlock, Fort Smith, AR

 Shannon Tucker, Springdale AR 
   I have been eating pizza from Eureka Pizza since I was a little girl. I grew up in Springdale, Arkansas, and every Thursday was pizza night for our family. With me, my sister, brother, mom, and dad we all liked different topping, so 3 large pizzas that had the best flavor and a variety of toppings for $16.99 it was the best deal around. Now at 26 years of age I still continue to order from Eureka Pizza. My 7 year old, Travis, loves the cheese sticks and sausage pizza. My 3 year old, , loves the pepperoni pizza and cheese sticks. We usually order 2 large pepperoni, 1 large sausage, and an order of cheese sticks. Most of the time we have two full pizzas left over, that we re-heat for lunch the following day. Everyone knows pizza is always better the next day. The price has not gone up a bit, and they still beat everyone else in price and flavor. I feed my family their favorite food twice for about $25. Pizza parties are a must for Eureka Pizza they have the best deals of anyone, 6 large pizzas for under $35. For birthday parties my family orders Eureka Pizza at home or the park for everyone, and then goes to Chuck E. Cheese after the party and pizza.
Respectfully, Alicia Lane, Centerton AR My friends and I get together every week to order pizza, and play games or watch movies. It wouldn&apos;t be the same without the GREAT pizza from Eureka, the only problem is choosing from all the tasty toppings! 
Chad Carter Fort Smith, AR   Eureka Pizza is great, how many restaurants offer so many choices. You can get lots of food for the big game with their three for one deals or you can get a Deluxe pizza with all the upgraded toppings for just the family. Jeremy Devers, Fayetteville, AR We had been shorted by Pizza Hut, and when we caught them, they sent us a 
 coupon for a free pizza. With 7 little girls, 1 medium pizza was NOT going 
 to cut it. So we decided to try Eureka Pizza. We had heard great things 
 about the quality and price, so we ordered a couple of cheese pizzas to eat 
 along side the Pizza Hut pizza. Boy, were we amazed at the difference! 
 Everyone loved the fresh taste and crispy crust on the Eureka Pizza! We 
 wouldn&apos;t even dream of using the other guys now!
3 of your large pizzas is 
 just about right for our family, and I just can&apos;t figure where else you 
 could feed 9 hungry people for less than $25.00. Thank you for the wonderful 
 pizza and the great prices. 
 Christa Bartok, Greenwood, A   Since Eureka Pizza has opened in Fort Smith, Arkansas. I have not found a reason to go to the other pizza places that I used to frequent. I think I have become addicted to your style of pizza and the courteous people that wait on us either on the phone or directly at the counter. We eat your pizza about once a week during our lunch break at the Federal Building located south of town. Personally, I enjoy the all-meat pizza, but usually we end up getting the usual pepperoni, the supreme pizza with everything and then one with all-meats. I am allergic to most of the vegetables so that is for me and anyone else that can get it away from me. Thank you for providing such a great quality crust with fine ingredients for our group; the munch a bunch for lunch.
 Jill Dahlem, Fort Smith AR We Always order your pizza for our staff and it is great! Keep up the great work! Neosho Powersports, Neosho MO
