 Nuvaring, the hormone-relesing contraceptive ring you insert once a month and leave in place for 21 days is finally on the market. It received FDA approval in October.

Then bring the coupon and a prescription from your doctor to your pharmacy. Last edited by shopperDiann; 08-05-2002 at 10:16 AM . Reply With Quote 08-05-2002,  10:48 AM #2 lekker

 Registered User Join Date Feb 2002 Posts 86 Hi Has anyone tried this? I am really forgetful with taking the pill and this sounds so convenient. This was recommended to me by my doctor, but right now my insurance is not covering this. I am considering just paying for it out of pocket if I like it. If anyone out there who is using this, I would appreciate some insight. Thanks for your help in advance!! Reply With Quote 07-25-2003,  07:14 PM #5 SweetTart

 Registered User Join Date Mar 2001 Location Southern California Posts 29 I just started using this - so far so good, it&apos;s nice not to have to remember to take a pill every day!! Also the pill has higher doses of estrogen because is has to go through your whole system, this requires less because the estrogen goes directly where its needed. So to me it&apos;s an all around better choice, and the effectiveness is the same as the pill - probably higher because it&apos;s easy not to be perfect about taking pills.

Thanks for mentioning this. My doc is such a jackass, he won&apos;t even talk to be about birthcontrol. He took me off the pill 6 years ago because it made my blood pressure high.

Well 6 years of&quot;you know what&quot;is still risky. Every time I bring it up, he tells me to consider all these options, then the same thing next time. I&apos;ve told him time and time again that I&apos;m tired of talking about it and I&apos;m ready to choose.

Still no action. I&apos;m gonna ask him about this and If he shy&apos;s away from the conversation one more time, That&apos;s it. I&apos;m outta there and gonna find a real doctor. Reply With Quote 07-26-2003,  06:57 AM #7 delfinafilms

 Registered User Join Date Mar 2001 Location Southern California Posts 29 Shelvis, one of the advantages of not ingesting birth control and using a method like this is that the hormones dont pass through your vital organs like heart, liver etc., so you pretty much eliminate risk of side effects like high blood pressure. I am lucky, I have a great doctor, she tells me MORE than I want to know sometimes, and answers ALL of my questions!! Reply With Quote 07-26-2003,  04:00 PM #9 yolex

 Registered User Join Date Jun 2001 Location Texas, y&apos;all! Posts 166 I&apos;ve been using this for 3 months now, just to reduce the pain of my periods. Cramping is much better, and my period only lasts for 2-3 days, with much lighter&quot;flow.&quot;I HIGHLY recommend the Nuvaring to anyone looking for another alternative to the pill.
