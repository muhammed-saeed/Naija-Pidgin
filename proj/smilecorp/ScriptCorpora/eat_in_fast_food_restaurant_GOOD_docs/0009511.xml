&quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; and Pesticides
 The Environmental Working Group is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, founded in the 1990&apos;s for public education on issues of environmental health. Among other things, it publishes an annual list of &quot;the dirty dozen,&quot; twelve kinds of produce that are most likely to contain pesticide residues. More recently, they have also begun publishing a list of &quot;the clean 15.&quot; The lists are available online.
 
Pesticides are Poison, Often Neurotoxins
In Latin the ending &quot;-cide&quot; indicates something that causes death. &quot;Homicide&quot; is the killing of a human. &quot;Suicide&quot; is the killing of the self. &quot;Patricide&quot; and &quot;matricide&quot; are the killing of parents and our modern words &quot;pesticide&quot; and &quot;herbicide&quot; were coined to refer to chemicals used to kill plants and unwanted animals. At a basic level, most pesticides are poisons, and most pesticides used on foods for sale in the United States are organophosphate nerve agents. Organophosphates are considered less dangerous than the organochlorides (such as DDT) they replaced, but they are still neurotoxins. For this reason, many people choose to avoid pesticide residue in their food.
The Dirty Dozen for 2009
Conventionally-grown crops having the highest level of pesticide residue are sometimes referred to as the &quot;dirty dozen&quot; and tend to include soft-skinned fruits or low crops: those just above ground level that are most prone to insect attack. For this reason, many people prefer to spend a little extra to purchase these foods as organics
 Peaches Apples Bell Peppers Celery Nectarines Strawberries Cherries Kale Lettuce Imported Grapes Carrots Pears 

2009&apos;s Clean Fifteen
The &quot;clean fifteen,&quot; by contrast, are those organic foods which have the lowest levels of pesticide residue. These tend to be crops with thicker skins.
 Onions Avocados Sweet Corn Pineapple Mango Asparagus Sweet Peas Kiwi Cabbage Eggplant Papaya Watermelon Broccoli Tomatoes Sweet Potatoes 

For Further Information

 The Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides has a variety of agricultural and other resource articles The Environmental Working Group web site includes a downloadable PDF of the two lists Wikipedia has articles on pesticides , including organophospates such as parathion and malathion

The Old Apple Tree
 As any fourth-grader knows, Vancouver was established as Fort Vancouver by the Hudson&apos;s Bay Company in the 1820&apos;s. Serving as the central gathering-place for the beaver trade (and other European-influenced commerce) the fort was the northwest&apos;s first gated community, under the direction of John McLoughlin from 1824-1846, when he retired to open a general store in Oregon City (a suburb of Vancouver, and end of the Oregon Trail). Fort Vancouver and The Old Apple Tree are at the northeast corner of the Interstate Bridge, just north of Portland, Oregon (a suburb of Oregon City).
 
The fort was a sophisticated, multi-cultural settlement, with British officers inside and a mixture of Hawaiian cooks, French-Canadian workers and Native Americans on the outside. The fort included a variety of crops and other enterprises, such as a dairy, lumber mill, blacksmith and several gardens, fields and orchards.
Legend has it that a man named Simpson of the Hudson&apos;s Bay Company attended a dinner party in London before heading to Vancouver, and apples were served for desert. A young woman gave him a few seeds to plant in the new world, and one of these became The Old Apple Tree, currently at one end of Maya Lin&apos;s &quot;Confluence Project&quot; land bridge, connecting Fort Vancouver with Old Apple Tree Park, between SR-14 and the railroad tracks just north of Columbia Way.
Reportedly planted in 1826, the tree was reportedly to have born its first fruit within two years and has been called &quot;the matriarch of Washington&apos;s apple industry.&quot; The current interchange of SR-14 and I-5 was designed around it, and a plaque at the site says that &quot;The apple culture of the Pacific northwest began at Fort Vancouver in 1826. This is the oldest apple tree in this territory.&quot; Grafts from the tree have periodically been sold as a historical fundraiser, and the park is the central feature of Vancouver&apos;s Old Apple Tree Park at 112 Columbia Way on the Waterfront Renaissance Trail.
This park is the site of the Old Apple Tree Festival, traditionally held on the first Saturday of October, and focusing on northwest heritage and proper tree care.
Apples grown directly from seed are famously inconsistent, and most nineteenth-century apples were planted for use in alcoholic cider or &quot;apple jack.&quot;

Bud Burst&amp;Cherry Blossoms
 &quot;Bud burst&quot; is a phrase sometimes used to refer to the time when a fruit tree blossoms. Coming as they do before leaves are fully out (making pollination simpler) this is traditionally a time of great joy and symbolism. Nowhere is this more evident than sakura observances in Japan, inspiration for Washington DC&apos;s annual Cherry Blossom Festival and a similar observance at Clark College this Friday, April 17, 2009.
 

Symbolism of Cherry Blossoms in China and Japan
The flowering cherry is known as the sakura in Japan, where it is often the focus of special flower-viewing events or parties. Although a powerful symbol of female beauty in China, the sakura (a different tree than our fruiting cherry) are even more culturally significant in Japan, serving as a symbol of beauty and the transience of all life. Fleeting and delicate, flowering cherry petals often fall within a few days and may cover the ground like snow.
This characteristic of &quot;blossoming trees&quot; is sometimes used to distinguish them from &quot;flowering trees.&quot; Staying for a week or two at most, cherry blossoms (like all fruit blossoms) can also be stripped early by hard spring rains, reducing the chances for pollination and lowering fruit yields among agricultural crops.
Clark College Sakura Festival Friday, 17 April 2009
From 2-5pm this Friday, 17 April 2009, Clark College shall have its fourth annual sakura festival and flower viewing, in honor and celebration of the hundred Shirofugen cherry trees donated by John Kageyama, President of America Kotobuki. Planted on Earth Day, 1990, these marked the Washington state centennial, and this year&apos;s festival is part of Clark&apos;s 75-year anniversary celebration.

Clark County &quot;Old Poor Farm&quot; 78th Street Farm Project
 The Clark County &quot;78th Street Farm&quot; is located at 1919 NE 78th Street, north of Vancouver, Washington. An agricultural research station for the Washington State University extension service from the 1940&apos;s to this decade, the property was the Clark County poor farm before that, with low-income housing in what is now the administrative building and burial for indigents on the west crest of the hill. With almost a hundred acres of contiguous (and mostly-undeveloped) land, it represents a unique opportunity. The future of the site is currently in the balance, as various parties jockey to see what will become of it, making now an important time for input and increased public awareness.
 

History of the Property and Project
The first recorded owner was reportedly named William Anderson, and an 1888 map of &quot;Clarke County, Washington Territory&quot; already shows it as county property. It served as the Clark County poor farm from the 1880&apos;s until the 1940&apos;s and was deeded to Washington State University for use as an agricultural research station from 1949, reverting to the county as WSU moved to their new campus. Initial plans for conventional development by the county were not well-received, and the project was suspended in late 2004.
The current &quot;garden park concept plan&quot; emerged from this process, including a series of technical workshops on permacultural concepts in 2008 and a citizen&apos;s &quot;sounding board&quot; of &quot;stakeholders&quot; that first met in August of 2008. This concept plan is scheduled to be completed by mid-year, and as part of this there will be a presentation and &quot;public workshop&quot; on Thursday, 9 April 2009, from 6 to 8 pm at Gaiser Middle School Cafeteria, just east of I-5 exit 5 at 3000 NE 99th St.
The Once and Future Farm
The rich history of this site and its unique topography present many unique opportunities, as an aerial view of the area demonstrates. Situated atop one of Clark County&apos;s most productive wells and crested by a smooth east-to-west ridge, it contains superb traffic access from 78th Street, good soils, a gentle south-facing slope and many other features. Among the possibilities are
 A no-frills &quot;grower&apos;s market&quot; in the compacted field area at the property&apos;s northwest corner, to nurture emerging local growers without a carnival atmosphere New warehouse and educational facility for the Clark County Food Bank in the northeast corner, with easy access by freeway and for low-income residents Certified community kitchen to encourage economic development by local micro-businesses Various possibilities such as meeting space or agriculture and culinary training for young people, leveraging existing utilities along 78th Street Community gardens in currently certifiable organic areas slightly southeast of the current building Greenhouses and other facilities for education, showcasing programs such as WSU Master Gardeners, who are currently on the site Small, multi-acre &quot;incubator&quot; farms to help train and establish a new generation of younger, local farmers Outdoor education opportunities for youth of all kinds, from 4H to class groups to after-school programs, perhaps leveraging the science of agriculture and ecology to provide less-expensive, hands-on learning opportunities formerly provided by outdoor school, but across grades and for more children Senior activity and nutrition programs, such as &quot;meals on wheels&quot; and other programs run by local groups such as Loaves and Fishes Extensions or tie-ins with Hazel Dell Park at the southeast corner, perhaps to include a community center or conventional community gardens 
The possibilities are tremendous to use this site for multi-generational education and recreation, in a way which will benefit and filter out to the entire county. Whether you are young or old, rural or urban, comfortable or poor, grower or eater, there are many great possibilities for you.
May we have the vision to develop them in a way which honors the history of this site and promotes health for this and future generations to come.

Food Policy Councils
 &quot;Food policy&quot; is a term often used for public policy around issues of food access and distribution, with organizations such as the Food Security Coalition working for the explicit development of &quot;food policy councils.&quot; Originating in Knoxville, Tennessee, this movement aims to bring together various parties concerned about food issues to increase local economic development and access to wholesome and nutritional foods as a matter of public health, safety and security. Both Multnomah and Clark County have local food policy councils.
 
Recognizing Food as a Public Policy Issue
From ancient Rome to modern Africa, distribution of food has often been key to political control and the maintenance of public order. Hunger and malnutrition have political consequences and, even in the absence of food riots, inequitable distribution creates significant moral and economic problems. From short-term hunger abatement to land-use planning, health inspection, nutritional education and toxics management, government and private agencies can promote or discourage a reliable food sufficient for public health. By bringing together different groups involved in food distribution, food policy councils aim to inform all policy decisions.
The Portland Multnomah Food Policy Council
Founded in the early 2000&apos;s, the Portland Multnomah Food Policy Council aims to coordinate food policy throughout the region, with such projects as inventories of arable land and farm-to-school nutrition programs. Recognizing an adequate supply of nutritious, affordable and culturally appropriate food as a public good, the council works to promote a healthy regional food system by encouraging communication and coordination among a wide variety of agencies, including governments and private organizations such as restaurants, universities and food banks. Details of the Portland Multnomah council (including past minutes) are available online.
Clark County Food System Council
Although not as well-established as its larger sister to the south, the Clark County Food System Council is well ahead of the national curve, emerging in concert with the Community Choices 2010 program a few years ago. Coordinated by WIC program manger Tricia Mortell of Clark County, the council meets on the fourth Thursday of each month at the CASEE Center in Brush Praire.
The Clark County council is currently looking for new members and is accepting applications until April 15.
