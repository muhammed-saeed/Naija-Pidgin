 Fast Food Restaurant Nutrition 
 Apr 26, 2011 | By Susan Stopper Photo Credit hamburger image by max blain from Fotolia.com 
Fast food is convenient and often tasty, but it has gained a bad reputation in the nutrition department. Studies have found that people who consume more fast food are more likely to be obese, such as one published in the August 2000 International Journal of Obesity. As people have become aware of the contents of their favorite fast food items, many restaurants have responded with healthier options, making it possible to dine on fast food without sabotaging your diet.
 
The Basics

Hamburgers, bacon and cold cuts such as roast beef and salami are all high in fat and readily available on fast food menus. French fries and other fast food items can be cooked in oils high in artery-clogging fat. If you add high-fat toppings and condiments such as cheese and mayonnaise, the fat and calories really start to add up. Fast food also tends to be loaded with salt, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Fast food portions may be larger than you need, making it possible to consume more than a day&apos;s worth of calories, fat and sodium in one sitting if you don&apos;t choose wisely.
 
Unhealthy Choices

The nutrition information for some fast food items is quite telling. According to a sampling of fast food restaurants&apos; online nutrition information, many of the larger burgers with more than one patty or toppings that include mayonnaise, bacon or cheese contain as many as 700 to 1,100 calories, 12 to 42 grams of saturated fat and high levels of sodium and cholesterol. A large order of French fries generally contains around 500 calories and fast food milkshakes contain 500 to 1,000 calories.
 
Healthier Options

Many fast food restaurants try to cater to the health-conscious diner, but according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, many of the lighter items don&apos;t last very long on the menu. When you&apos;re ordering, look for sandwiches and salads with grilled chicken or other lean meats that are heavy on vegetables and don&apos;t include cheese, mayonnaise or other high-fat toppings. If you&apos;re craving red meat, satisfy your craving without over-indulging by ordering a basic hamburger. For instance, a McDonald&apos;s hamburger contains just 250 calories and 3.5 grams of saturated fat.
 
Warning

Beware of fast food items that might make you think they are healthy choices. For instance, a salad can pack a load of fat on its lettuce when it&apos;s topped with fried chicken, cheese and a high-calorie dressing. When choosing a sandwich or salad with chicken, look for grilled chicken, which generally contains lower levels of fat and calories than its crispy counterpart.
 
Fact Finding

Most fast food restaurants provide nutrition information for their menu items on their website or somewhere in their restaurant, and soon you&apos;ll be able to see calorie information right on the menus and menu boards, including at drive-throughs. These new calorie posting requirements are part of the health care reform legislation signed into law on March 23, 2010.
