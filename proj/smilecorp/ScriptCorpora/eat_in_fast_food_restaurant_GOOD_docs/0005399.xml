 Why Holiday in Dubai 

For those who love to travel, Dubai means holiday in a place that in recent years has become a destination not to be missed.

Only in Dubai, you can see huge buildings that rise from the desert. Holidays in the Emirates allows a look at the most modern country in the Arab world. It is one of the most important centres of Asia and entire world economy. In Dubai’s shops are the finest products of the planet.

Frances Gordon recommends in his book &quot;Oman, Yemen and United Arab Emirates&quot;, by EDT Editions (one of the best guides for Dubai and surroundings):

&quot;When we talk about the contemporary architecture, the grandeur is definitely considered a good thing in the Emirates. Residents like impressive, bright and garish buildings. Dubai aspect has dramatically changed, within the space of about twenty years, with the help of a group of international renowned architects, which are happy to accept the assignments more profitable in the world. Maybe they not respond to the aesthetic taste of all people, but Dubai skyscrapers are true architectural whims, which testify, however, a certain engineering audacity. The Dubai Burj al-Arab is probably the most famous example of this type of architecture, but other buildings, currently under construction, are as amazing. Of course, these are huge, too.

 What to See on Holiday in Dubai 

 Palm Island 
It was built on a stretch of reclaimed land. This vast complex has added 720 km of beach to the coast of Dubai. It consists of two palm-shaped islands and hosts 40 luxury hotels, 200 private homes, two marinas, shopping centres and cinemas. Private homes were sold quickly, perhaps when was spread the news that Posh Spicé Victoria and her husband David Beckam would be the first to buy one of them.

 Burj Dubai 
Currently under construction, it is conceived to be the tallest skyscraper in the world. You do not have to confuse it with the Burj al-Arab. The architect, landed from the United States, literally said, &quot;Dubai is like Chicago, we do not have mountains and we must build it ourselves”.

 Hydropolis 
Welcome to the world of James Bond. A submarine inspires this underwater hotel, designed by a German architect, where you move by an underwater train.

 Dubai Museum 
Dubai Museum is an interesting place, which introduce you to the Emirates’ history and culture. Then go for a walk, just around the corner, in the Majlis Gailery placed in a traditional mansion crammed with handmade crafts to bay as souvenirs. After a lunch in the courtyard of the nearby Basta Art Café, go on foot towards the historic Dubai Souq, where you can admire the wooden roof and a myriad of fabric shops. Proceed toward the pier in Bur Dubai and climb aboard of an abra that will take you to the old Deira suq. In your travel, you will not have to miss exploring this area, which is charming and teeming with people, especially the bright gold soq and the exotic perfume soq. In addition, go for a walk along the pier of the dhow (elders) on the Creek. After another crossing in abra, go towards the Fatafeet Café. From here, the view over the treek and the Deira towers is spectacular, and there is no better place for a drink with sheesha. Return to the hotel to get dressed up and go to dinner at one of the many fantastic restaurants in the city. End the evening in the elegant Vu&apos;s Bar, in Emirates Towers, from which you will enjoy a magnificent views of the city in all its glory.

A whole day could be devoted to the enchanting area beaches. If you have the fortune to be in the city on Thursday or Sunday, be sure to book a visit to the Jumeira Mosque in the morning. Have lunch at the nearby Lime Tree Café, before spending the afternoon relaxing in the Jumeira Beach Park or in the exciting Wild Wadi Waterpark. In the evening, go towards one of the restaurants in the area of five-stars hotels. Tagine the One&amp;Only Royal Mirage is without doubt the best choice. After dinner, permit yourself a sheesha and a drink in the magic Kasba, in the courtyard next to the Tagine, or to the magnificent Barasti Bar, on the beach of Le Meridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort.

 Holiday in Dubai: Visiting Abu Dhabi 

In Abu Dhabi there are many money, the real ones, the big cars and the big shots. Only 50 years ago, Abu Dhabi was nothing but a fishing village with a fort, a couple of coral palaces and a few barasti houses scattered here and there. The rest of the Emirate was pure desert dotted with oases, like Al-Ain and Liwa. Where survived thanks to the earth products. Today the city has reached a level of prosperity, which has exceeded the most optimistic hopes. The Emirate has literally blossomed thanks to the implementation of the green program &quot;Greening the Emirates&quot;, while continuing the extraction of a seemingly endless river of black gold from oil wells. Looking Abu Dhabi at work will give the traveller a fascinating viewpoint of the sheiks world who governs the country. Although it does not have the Dubai cosmopolitan look and that charm a bit cheeky which makes the &quot;second city&quot; so interesting.

 Holiday in Dubai: Food and Drink 

The Arab Emirates cuisine is extraordinarily varied due to the presence of numerous foreigners in the country. Lebanese, Indians and Iranians (also called Persians) restaurants are the most common and the dishes are consumed in both restaurant and home. From simple shawarma or kebab (meat sliced by a vertical spit and wrapped in an Arab bread sandwich with tomato slices and condiment) of the hawkers, to the sophisticated menu of one of the best restaurants in Dubai, you will find the best suitable food for your pocket and your palate. There are no many opportunities to taste the real &quot;Emirates cuisine&quot;, but there are dishes in addition to the tough camel meat, which are worth tasting. Try khuzi, stuffed roast lamb served on a bed of spicy rice; the makbus, meat or fish pie with rice; the hareis, a dish of wheat and lamb cooked slowly; and the Umm Ali, a pie with raisin and nuts. You must definitely sample the delicious local dates. Some hotels served the pork, but it is not very common. Only international restaurants sold alcoholics.
