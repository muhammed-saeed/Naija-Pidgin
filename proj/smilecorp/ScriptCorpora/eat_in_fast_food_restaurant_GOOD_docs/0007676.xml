Food Stamps at Fast Food Restaurants?

&quot;Welcome to Taco Bell , will this be cash, charge or food stamps ?&quot;

Just when I thought I&apos;d heard it all, now fast food restaurants want Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients to be eligible to use their food stamp benefit at selected restaurants. Restaurants such as Taco Bell, KFC and Subway believe that there are certain types of SNAP recipients who are homeless or living in conditions that do not allow them hot meals and these people would benefit from being able to use their food benefit at fast food restaurants.

Seriously?

Fresno, Calif., officials are considering legislation that would permit SNAP benefits to be used at fast food restaurants in their area. Arizona, Michigan and other parts of California already allow the practice and Kentucky is currently considering it.

I already object to the many things that can be purchased with SNAP benefits. Junk food, soft drinks, pre-packaged frozen foods and candy are all permitted under current law. This is really a no-brainer. The law should restrict use of those taxpayer-provided funds to the basic staples: meat, starches, bread, milk, vegetables and cheese. Maybe there should be even an allowance for toiletries. But, it&apos;s a moral crime to have public aid recipients eating better then the very taxpayers who pay for their benefit and a sad reflection of just how far this sense of entitlement has penetrated into our society.

There have been too many times that I watch someone in front of me at the checkout lane pile steaks, roasts and even lamb chops into their cart and then pay for it with a food stamp card . They&apos;re eating better than me, and I work two jobs just to keep my head above water. And, the last time I went grocery shopping, the person even had a birthday cake from the bakery in the cart as well. All paid for with food stamps .

Soon middle class workers will find themselves driving home from work to eat a box of Hamburger Helper because payday is still a week away and the money is gone. Meanwhile, Joe Homeless person is standing in line at KFC waiting for his bucket of original recipe chicken, hot biscuits and two sides. Oh, and he can super size his soft drink too.

 Ron  •  Golden Valley, Arizona  •  26 days ago he&apos;s wrong on one point when money was short between paydays my wife would buy a lg roast,hot roast beef dinner,one night,hot roast beef sandwiches2nd nite.cold roast beef sandwiches,for lunch.beef stew for rest of week.that was a family of six.we would do the same with turkey.it was healthier and cheaper than hamburgers and hotdogs.plus most of the time we had homemade soup and breads. wandering fawn  •  Palm Springs, California  •  7 days ago Some people at some times in their lives, need help. We are a nation of people who have helped people all over the world. We can certainly afford to help our own. Our main expense now, and always has been, is corruption in government and banking. That is just about to be rendered extinct. Let&apos;s help each other. You never know when your world will collapse and you find yourself empty-handed and needing help. Steve  •  Pensacola, Florida  •  2 mths ago This is ridiculous. If you think free phones and free meals at restaurants will get this country back on its feet you are wrong. What would people do if they did not get all the tax supported benefits? They would get jobs and who would benefit from them converting from consumers to producers? America, we just might pull ourselves out of the hole. It would be nice if the world could go a couple more generations before everyone is working so a small group of government officials can live in luxury. This country was founded to take power from the government leaders and give the small guy a chance to make it. We are giving it all away, because a few politians are giving it away for votes. Villainous Charm  •  New York, New York  •  3 mths ago is the snarky attitude needed? Chris Kronenberger  •  1 yr 0 mths ago Well said. Chris  •  Newark, Ohio  •  5 mths ago restaurants like taco bell&amp;subway make there food&amp;sell it for a fraction of what it would cost me to make it at home people could eat healthier at subway&amp;there food stamps would last them longer if some of the cheaper restaurants would accept food stamps Chris  •  Newark, Ohio  •  5 mths ago when i buy food sometimes it spoils b4 i can use it&amp;has to be thrown out not at a restaurant, sometimes i under-cook it&amp;i get sick not at a restaurant , sometimes i burn it&amp;it has to be thrown out not at a restaurant, I think there would be much less wasted food stamps if some restaurants would take food stamps Chris  •  Newark, Ohio  •  5 mths ago children of food stamp families cant eat if the parents refuse to cook but they could eat if they take there food stamps to a restaurant MargaretD  •  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  •  5 mths ago I sure hope they do this in Pennsylvania. I know they already allow it in Florida. It would sure help because alot of people are homeless and don&apos;t have access to a stove. Plus Mcdonalds and Taco Bell has really cheap food! I think are society are too hard on the disabled. And I&apos;m not talking about the criminals. Rayn_bo  •  Flagstaff, Arizona  •  5 mths ago Why aren&apos;t most of you mad the corporations like Taco Bell, KFC, and Mickey D&apos;s want the food stamps? You&apos;re talking smack about the individuals that get them, but who&apos;s REALLY trying to benefit from it?? Wake up 99%. Paris  •  Atlanta, United States  •  7 mths ago Can you say a real big hater!!! If he were to lose his job as of today then he will understand why most of us are on Foodstamps!!! I work part time, student full time, wife, mother of 2 children soon to be 3 in February, my husband has been laid off and my job cut me down to 17hrs a week and I am having health issues while pregnant! I see nothing wrong with help from the government as long as I am not abusing it! H#ll I have paid my taxes, I&apos;ve been working since I was 14 and I am now 28yrs old!
