It is not uncommon for McDonalds to be the employer of first resort for young people just entering the workforce, older workers desiring extra income, or for those planning on transferring from one corporation to another. So, employee is impacting McDonalds in this way.


e. Technology:

McDonalds is producing their main product that means burger ,salads in their own kitchen, they are cooking all fries ,nuggets and meat patties in their own grill .So, the use of equipment, special control devices, temperature regulators, point-of-sales systems, inventory upkeep, financial information and communications are all linked to different technologies. In this way technology is impacting McDonalds.

McDonald&apos;s is growing day by day by increasing the number of restaurant. The main source of ingredient and packaging is nature. McDonald&apos;s has a Rain Forest Policy, which declares its commitment to beef purchasing practices that do not contribute to tropical de-forestation. Everyday McDonalds using a huge amount of napkins, carryout bag, tray lines, clamshells. Oil and water is other major ingredient using in McDonalds. . The continuous and enormous use of natural resources can disturb the balance in the ecosystem. In Europe, McDonald&apos;s has been recycling vegetable grease by converting it to fuel for their diesel trucks Now, every body are conscious about environment. So, McDonalds need to careful about environment that, what McDonalds are doing that&apos;s environmental friendly.


i. Culture and religion:

That&apos;s way, if MacDonald&apos;s do good business and if its prospect is good, then price of share will increase and there is a possibility of getting more dividend for shareholder. On the other hand if company needs more money for invest then McDonalds will issue more share in market.


Critical evaluation of current strategies in use:

SO strategies:

 Expand into Chinese market (increase advertising and restaurant locations) 
Two decades ago, McDonald&apos;s was largely unknown in Beijing. The first McDonald&apos;s was in Shenzhen in 1990.And now, by this time McDonald&apos;s expanded into China rapidly.

After home market USA, China is the no 1 growth market for McDonalds. , now, McDonalds got more than 960 restaurants and over 60,000 employees in China. McDonald&apos;s is operating in more than 100 cities in China with plans to open 500 stores in next five years. McDonald&apos;s is planning to open 125 restaurant this year,150 in 2009 and 150 in 2010 in China. The main reasons of expanding business in China are increase advertising and restaurant location. Company is choosing bustling Commercial Street of the capital city.

 b. Acquire krispy kreme Corporation: 
McDonald&apos;s is trying to acquire other food company to make it strong. krispy Kreme is one of those ,which operate whole sale doughnut distribution business. It suppose to be help McDonald&apos;s to grow more and do more profit but krispy Kreme did not have enough reputation about profit and share value.

For the quarter ended Oct. 31, 2004 Krispy Kreme reported a net loss of $3 million, or 5 cents a share, versus a profit of $14.5 million, or 23 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Income from continuing operations before impairment charges and store closing costs was $2.4 million, or 4 cents a share, below average analyst expectations of 13 cents a share, as reported by Thomson First Call. The company&apos;s share price declined 16 percent to $9.64 on Nov. 22, 2004,

So, its a challenge of McDonald&apos;s to deal with krispy Kreme. If McDonald&apos;s doesn&apos;t handle krispy Kreme carefully company couldn&apos;t be benefited



WO Strategies:

 Menu development(healthy lifestyle Hispanic foods lines): 
McDonald&apos;s is promoting a healthy lifestyle to customers ,that&apos;s way they are couching kids in cool sports activities like bike riding, show boarding and playing baseball. From the given case study, we realize that, they put rating 2 for developing a &quot;healthy lifestyle program to attract health conscious consumers, where weight is 15 and weighted score is 0.30.

McDonalds is also introducing more health-conscious menus such as the fruit and walnut salad and the option to replace fries with fruit in Happy Meals.

Recently Hispanic population has increased by 14% in U.S. That&apos;s way McDonalds always introducing Hispanic menus like Fiesta menu, and lots of chicken menus. And these Hispanic foods are not only popular for Hispanic people but also for general market.



ST Strategies:

 Increase the number of restaurants located in theme parks Disney&amp;ocean Park: 
McDonalds not only open their restaurant in general in busy place it also increasing the number of restaurant in theme parks Disney&amp;ocean park .At first McDonalds did struggle to open and do business in Walt Disney ,Disneyland. Company opened its ninth restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, in suburban Chicago, Illinois in 1955. And surprisingly the first day revenues were $366.12.kroc. After that company is always trying to build restaurant in all famous and popular theme parks like Disney and Ocean Park.

 Increase advertising of coffee line in key markets (China. North America): 
As, in China and North America McDonalds got a big market .That&apos;s way McDonalds took strategy of advertising of coffee line in those key market. But in China, there are lots of traditional small coffee shop all over the country, which price is really cheap. On the other hand North America the &quot;land of coffee&apos;&apos;. People of this zone are habituated to take nice and fresh coffee with cheap price. So, it&apos;s really a challenge for McDonalds to increase coffee sales in those key markets.



WT Strategies:

 Develop the menu to keep up with competition (Asian and Latin American) 
Customers got complain against McDonalds about the product variety. From the given case study we saw that McDonalds rating is 3 for product variety where weight is 0.10, and weighted score is 0.30. Where as two competitors Wendy are rating and weighted score 4 and 0.40 and Burger Kings are is 3 and 0.30. So, McDonalds could do product develop by taking new food idea from Asia like lam burger, vegetarian burgers and food ,chicken tikka masala which is really popular for Indian people. As like as Teriyaki Mac from Japan, variants of Filet-O-Fish from China, ice cream with green beans or red beans from Hong Kong. And from Latin America McDonalds could take idea of Roasted beef Burritos, taco recipes, fajitas etc.

 Redesign the website to make it more user-friendly and o compete better with completion: 
Customers always complain that McDonalds website is not user friendly .so, McDonalds should redesign their website to make it friendlier. Otherwise they will be failure to compete with other. McDonalds should put all restaurant location, food value nutritional content of their meals, price, new food, all promotional offers, and special menus of week in website.

 Increase sales promotion and advertising expenditures in key markets: 
McDonald&apos;s has for decades maintained an extensive advertising campaign. In addition to the usual media (television, radio, and newspaper), the company makes significant use of billboards and signage, sponsors sporting events from ranging from Little League to the Olympic Games, and makes coolers of orange drink with their logo available for local events of all kinds. Nonetheless, television has always played a central role in the company&apos;s advertising strategy. . McDonald&apos;s Europe introduces Fairies and Dragons video game concept include with classic children&apos;s Happy Meal. For sales promotion and advertisement McDonald&apos;s spend huge money in their key marker. From the given case study, we know that McDonald&apos;s rate is 3 for advertising when weight is 0.13and weighted score is 0.39.but its true that McDonald&apos;s should choose right media to advertisement and right sales promotion on right product on right time.

From the above discuss we could easily say that, which strategies McDonalds is using ,those got some drawback ,so McDonalds should modify those strategies and should use right place on right time.



Conclusion:

Though, still McDonald&apos;s is the largest over the counter quick service food restaurant in the world. After that McDonald&apos;s should consider the environmental factors which impacting company. And the strategies which company is using now, those have positive and negative effect on business. The management of McDonald&apos;s have to continuously keep an eye on the umbrella activities of the organization, by evaluating what works and what don&apos;t to create the organization strategies. In order to implement the strategies effectively and successfully, the upper level management should create a safe environment for reassure, support, changes, and commitment of the organization. It is then recommended that McDonald must make sure that all the strategies are well planned and implemented carefully beforehand, because these changes and strategies will be the deciding for the success or failure of any organization.
