Orbis gambles on big buy-in as fast food stocks continue to struggle

CONTRARIAN fund manager Orbis Investment Management has plunged into one of the most poorly fancied stocks in the market, fast-food restaurant owner Collins Foods, seizing an 11.9 per cent stake to be one of its biggest shareholders.

Heavy buying in Collins Foods by the fund manager between December 5 and December 28 helped it quickly amass an initial stake of 8.397 million shares, representing 9.03 per cent of Collins Foods&apos; issued capital, before a final spending spree before New Year&apos;s Eve saw Orbis collect a total of 11.05 million shares. This gives Orbis, which has a history of taking 10 per cent-plus holdings in small caps and other stocks viewed by the market as &apos;&apos;down and out&apos;&apos;, an 11.89 per cent holding in Collins Foods to make it roughly the group&apos;s third-biggest shareholder.

Collins Foods, which operates 119 KFC and 85 Sizzler restaurants, was the second-biggest sharemarket float of last year, and earned the wrath of investors when only three months after its listing it issued a savage profit downgrade.

Shares in Collins Foods lost a quarter of their value in one day, when the company warned its pro forma after-tax profit for the first half of this financial year would be roughly $8 million, compared with a prospectus forecast of $10.3 million.

The share price dived to $1.43 and closed 2011 at $1.29.

Collins Foods was floated by private equity group Pacific Equity Partners in August at $2.50 a share, and the fallout has left a sour taste in the mouths of investors and dented the reputation of the private equity sector.

Notices issued to the Australian Securities Exchange show Orbis paid an average of $1.256 a share for Collins Foods stock early last month.

It picked up its second parcel of stock in the last week of December at an average of $1.254 a share.
