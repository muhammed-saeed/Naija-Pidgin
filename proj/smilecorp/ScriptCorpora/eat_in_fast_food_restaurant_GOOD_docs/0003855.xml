 YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR TURNS TRASH INTO CASH
 Serving Up Success 
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. - Phil Tapia can testify to the manifest virtues of occasionally cleaning out the family garage.

It was during a day spent with his dad, Mike Tapia, amid boxes and oil stains two years ago, that Tapia discovered his Tray Display Advertising business, or at least the idea for it.

Uncovering examples of the advertising Mike Tapia had done with his Billboard Bags Inc. - on liquor store and fast-food bags - in the early &apos;90s reminded the Tapias of an idea Mike Tapia had for selling ads on fast-food restaurant placemats.

&quot;My dad always thought it could work, but he just didn&apos;t go forward with it at the time,&quot; Phil Tapia said. &quot;The more we talked about it, the more excited I got about bringing this idea back and turning it into a business.&quot;

Just about two years later, Tray Display Advertising Inc., is supplying 125,000 advertising sheets a month to 23 Wendy&apos;s locations in Colorado Springs, Pueblo and Woodland Park, with another 15 stores to come next year in Tucson, Ariz.

Since May 15, the firm also has been creating pizza box lid toppers for 12 Little Caesars stores in Colorado Springs and Pueblo. Tapia will work with eight more Little Caesars in Denver beginning in January.

Months after finishing classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Tapia banked sales of $60,000 for 2005 - the company&apos;s first full year. The 22-year-old expects to more than double that figure this year.

Phil Tapia currently operates Tray Display by himself out of his home. He expects to hire sales people as the business grows.

&quot;I was raised in this business,&quot; Tapia said. &quot;My dad has always been in advertising and marketing, and he brought me to radio appearances and promotional events when I was growing up.

&quot;It&apos;s all I&apos;ve ever wanted to do. I&apos;ve come to love the business just like my dad does,&quot; he said. &quot;Honestly, I wanted to be like my dad. I looked up to him.&quot;

Working with his father as a teen helped Tapia meet the people who would become his clients, including local Wendy&apos;s franchise owners.

But what made the idea take flight was its simplicity.

Tapia sells ads to a mix of a dozen or so local and national companies, has the 8 1/2-inch by 11-inch sheets printed in Oklahoma and then delivered to a central distribution point for his clients.

Wendy&apos;s of Colorado Springs estimates it saved thousands of dollars last year by not having to pay for its tray placemats. And the restaurant gets the central position on the sheets for its own advertisement, without cost.

&quot;We&apos;ve always put a coupon or a bounce-back ad on the box,&quot; said the owner of the city&apos;s four Little Caesar Pizza stores, &quot;and this seemed like a common sense approach to do that. It saves us a little money on printing, probably $200 a month, and it makes the point that we are part of the larger community. We like supporting local businesses.&quot;

Tapia puts advertising on the front and coloring contests tied to advertisers on the back. For Little Caesars&apos; advertising flyers, Tapia sells both sides of the sheet and even both sides of the sticker that holds the sheet to the box.

Fast Fix Jewelry Repair at Chapel Hills Mall was Tapia&apos;s first advertiser and is still a customer, joined by Crayola, Ringling Bros. and Barnum&amp;Bailey Circus, Bally Total Fitness, Earl Schieb Auto Paint&amp;Body Repair, Sunshine Car Audio, Colorado Springs Bike Shop, Ace Cash Express, Joy-Rides Family Fun Center, Colorado College hockey and the Imagination Celebration.

&quot;My main goal is to grow this concept and go all over the country with it,&quot; Tapia said.

In the meantime, Tapia is his own cottage industry. He also does promotional work and commercials for the local Pepsi distributor, print ads for Mister Neat&apos;s formal wear and is appearing in a TV ad campaign for Diamond City jewelers as a sort of James Bond character named Phillip Diamond.

&quot;Anything to do with marketing and advertising...I just love it all,&quot; Tapia said.
