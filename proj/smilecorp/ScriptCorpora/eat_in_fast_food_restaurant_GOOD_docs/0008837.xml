On Time-Traps and Waste

Regarding the Physics of Queueing, or the science of lines, we really only control the number of servers and the queue discipline (LIFO, FIFO, etc.). But, in the realm of operations improvement, we can improve the process, while not being able to control the stochastic nature of the batch size and queue arrival and interarrival rates. One of the major pieces that we need to identify and eliminate immediately are time-traps.

What is a Process?

A process is an systematic activity comprising of smaller activities that culminate in an outcome—service or product. A process can take up time, space, and resources. All processes can be categorized into the following categories, from the Customer’s Perspective:

 Value-added: This step in the process adds form, function, and value to the end product and for the customer. Non-Value-Added: This step does not add form, function, or assist in the finished goods manufacturing of the product. Non-Value-Added-But-Necessary: This step does not add value, but is a necessary step in the final value-added product. 

For example, when a customer goes to a fastfood restaurant, their perspective is thus: they want to be (a) served the right order, (b) in the right temperature, (c) in a timely way, and (d) in a cost-effective fashion. That’s it. But, to satisfy items (a), (b), (c), and (d), there is a lot of work that goes on, some of which are value-added, non-value-added, and non-value-added-but-necessary. For example, from the customer’s point of view, (a), (b), (c), and (d) might be value added, but cleaning the stove might be non-value-added-but-necessary.

One of the non-value-added steps in any process are what we call time-traps. Time-traps are non-value-added because they require attention, time but, at the end of the day, they don’t add value from the customer’s perspective. For example, the time-trap analysis below:
