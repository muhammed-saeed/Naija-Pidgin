I&apos;m a strong supporter of the humane society so this is my preferred thrift store for dropping off goods to donate.  As a shopper, this is actually also my preferred thrift store to hunt for bargains on used items.  The volunteers check through all donations and it seems to me that they mainly keep merchandise that is in pretty good shape.  For example, I don&apos;t come across stained clothes as often as I tend to see at Goodwill.  They also have 50% off sales several times during the year which are very popular, so if you hear of one, go early for more selection.

This place has tons of everything!

They have a huge furniture selection and at prices to make things move. I took away one star because they have so much furniture it&apos;s hard to browse without fear of something toppling over on you.

I love charity thrift stores because they&apos;re usually run by cute little old ladies who are too cool to stay at home all day--and this place is no exception. Everyone is friendly and ready to help and answer any questions.

I&apos;ve gotten some cool cactus here as well as a leather mini-skirt for $15! I beat myself up for the Mid-Century modern dresser I let slip through my grasp.

The parking lot next door makes it easy to load your trunk full of treasures.
Whenever I have to take my husband to SFO, I make sure to include a stop here.

GREAT little store, lovely staff and awesome store manager (John), but BEWARE the incredibly rude, curt and just plain weird donation center lady who &quot;runs&quot; the donation area--we were greeted as if we had just broken a fine China set in their store...?!? We went out of our way to choose this place because we are ardent animal lovers and support all causes that give $ to animal related places and charities. We regretted it as soon as we had to deal with the weird donation lady.

She had a dour look on her face the entire time. She has medium long brown hair and fair eyes, medium height.

We all have drama in our lives, but really, leave yours at home and don&apos;t treat community members who are DONATING valuable items as if they are dipped in sh*t. Awful. It&apos;s a shame, because we really love that store, but that lady is so VERY unwelcoming and cold. If possible, give your donations to the younger girl in the back or one of the senior citizens who assist, but stay away from that lady. Bad vibes!!

OR donate to your local Goodwill.

I don&apos;t even know where to begin, all I can get out at the moment is: I love this place!!

Let&apos;s start with parking. Parking is super easy. There is a parking lot right beside the store. It is metered, however one quarter gets you at LEAST 25 minutes. Amazing! The store itself is very organized. Furniture in the front, books in the back, and racks of clothes in between. There is also both a men&apos;s and women&apos;s restroom as well as two fitting rooms. The selection is great! The prices stay around one digit. I walked out with a $4 Michael Kors lace tanktop and a $7 cream cable knit sweater. I would have walked out with more but my cousin beat me to the cash register with items we both wanted. There is a resident cat who wanders around but it didn&apos;t bother me one bit. I love this place!! I will definately be coming back very soon!

I&apos;m not a frequent shopper, but a frequent donater.  I love supporting the animals with my donations.  We actually donated a car to the Humane Society once.  :)

The folks that work/volunteer there are all very, very sweet.

BTW, I drop off Banana Republic, Ann Taylor and stuff like that in small sizes.

I love everything about this store!  I love the ladies who work here, I love that they have cats roaming around the store looking for loves, I love that the proceeds are benefiting more aminals who need loves ....and I LOVE the Burlingame castoffs!!!

I have collected enough vintage dresses and hats to dress an entire tea party.  I have found work attire, jackets and even a HAWT leather vest for my best gay.  Like all thrift stores, I recommend you get there early for the best selections, but we&apos;ve spent plenty of weekends going post lunch and always leave with treasures.

Bring quarters for the meters!

5:00pm - Get off work.

5:20pm - Get home, change, look for local thrift stores online.

5:25pm - Call what looks like a great little thrift store to check store hours, get told that store is open until 6pm.

5:30pm - Depart for thrift store, looking forward to 20 minutes of bargain hunting and maybe letting my money go to help an animal shelter.

5:40pm - Walk into thrift store and head for the housewares section.  I hope they have a blender!

5:47pm - Curt female employee announces the store is now closed and to head to the register.  Exchange confused looks and smiles with the old lady also browsing housewares.

5:49pm - Store shuts interior lights off, confused old lady mentions something about not being able to see to find her way out.

5:50pm - Employees turn lights back on so we can find our way out of the store, and give us dirty looks.

5:51pm - Vow to girlfriend to write yelp review.

The Parental Unit and I decided to do something different in terms of gift giving this year after I suggested we come up with a fixed amount to spend on one another.  I then suggested we shop at thrift stores just to make it interesting since we both have just about everything we could ever want already.  The game is on!

I went in knowing that my chances were slim of finding what I &apos;wanted&apos; so I just went in open to what would be there.  Unfortunately, I missed the &apos;everything 50% off&apos; day but still got some nice deals:

*Five bestseller books for $10 (for me)
*One blockbuster movie (Mom - she&apos;s never seen Indiana Jones!)
*Gap silk sweater (Not sure if I&apos;m keeping this for me or not)
*Paris Las Vegas fleece hoodie (Mom - she loves to walk out in the cold)
*SF 49er stadium cushion (Mom - for sitting on cold benches)
*Lucky Brand tshirt (Mom - she&apos;s a bit of a thrift store label diva)
*Plastic water pitcher (Me - for iced tea next summer)

$29.53 spent and she&apos;ll be thrilled that it will benefit animals since she&apos;s all about pets. Would have been flat-out blown away if they&apos;d had an Apple arm band for her ipod.  Oh, well.  Maybe Best Buy will have it on sale.  :)

Parking is tough but I found a space on Chula Vista about 2.5 blocks away.

I would never have thought to review a thrift store . . . you know dirty, cold/hot, crowded and sometimes a bit stinky.  They have a fat-arse cat who owns the place and sually one or 2 mental/homeless cases wandering around all day.

Otherwise, I&apos;d be scared to wear anything from here and the only time I go in is to see if there are some good deals on pet carriers or the like which I have purchased, sanitized over a few days and used again.  Prices are reasonable.  They also give back to the Peninsula SPCA for their sales and have a lot of good pet-centric deals.

When I was little, my mom and I used to drive down to San Mateo to shop for furniture at the Pick of the Litter. Now, it&apos;s even closer to home, so my mom and I still bond over raw food from Que SeRAW down the street and a shopping trip into Pick of the Litter.

I can&apos;t say enough good stuff about this place. Really, it should be more like a list:
- They have cats. I&apos;m SOLD.
- They usually have some really cute antique jewelry in the front.
- Rich Burlingame ladies continually drop off their Ann Taylor and BCBG stuff, so stuff is always ripe for the picking.
- They have a great book collection at great prices.
- You can usually bargain with the staff if you&apos;re feeling poor.
- Great furniture and housewares selection
- The proceeds go to helping animals.

So this place is definitely worth planning your day around their limited hours. Get yourself a cute new purse and support kittens! Yeah!

I nearly gave POTL four stars, then realized I would be cursed. And who needs that? So I&apos;ll simply describe the missing star instead. But not until you know the important stuff:

Shop There. You&apos;ll be helping animals in need of homes. You may even see a few eligible felines around the store.

Pick of the Litter has furniture, clothes, jewelry, purses, and occasionally animal cages (bird, small critters...), etc. I have found some great shoes and purses there, but the women&apos;s tops and sweaters I see are very out of date and often look worn. Which of course they are, but they shouldn&apos;t look it.

It is definitely worth browsing, and any money you spend is automatically money well spent.

Good sized store, not tons of clothes but some.  Women&apos;s pants, $6.  A lot of housewares type of stuff.

They run 50% colored tag sales, the day I went, my colored tag wasn&apos;t on sale.

Metered parking next door, .25 for 30 minutes.

Fantastic little thrift shop that give all proceeds to the SPCA! (help the little homeless chihuahuas out! *wo0of* *meow*)

Mind you, I am just not a thrift shop type of gal. People that shop at thrift stores LITERALLY come from all walks of life.

-people who want new clothes but would rather buy used clothes because it&apos;s cheaper
-hipsters and scene kids thrifting for the sake of trendiness
-people looking for that hidden gem

Then there&apos;s me, curious, but not quite into digging through old, used things that may closely resemble trash.

Ah...I&apos;m not talking shit, but that&apos;s the case with most thrift stores. Pick of the litter is entirely opposite and is always kept neat and tidy. I love walking through the store just browsing quickly... I rarely DIG because ... well maybe i&apos;m just not that hardcore yet. For now, it&apos;ll be one of my fav thrift stores...(if i ever decide to go thrifting again) I think it makes me appreciate it more because it&apos;s proceeds funds the homeless animals. I love em.

Here&apos;s a tip, every THIRD tuesday of the month, it&apos;s 50% off everything in the store! =)

Where else can you find gems like the Peninsula Players (a CD) and mugs that say &quot;Love at First Byte?&quot;

Pick of the Litter, that&apos;s where.

I love the 50% off days. I found a new with tags shirt here for $4. The money benefits local animal shelters too.

Rare finds? That&apos;s an understatement.

With a cutesy name like Pick of the Litter, it&apos;s got to be good right? Yup, RIGHT-O! I moseyed over here while waiting for my bushy monster (aka, the husband) to get a hair cut. I didn&apos;t expect them to be open at 3 pm on a Sunday but lo and behold, they were!

It&apos;s a very small shop but they had several racks of stuff outside and they certainly had plenty of stuff crammed (but nicely) into the actual store. Within a few minutes I had scored a cool pair of Gap pants ($5), a darling little sky blue shrug with roses on it ($3), and an Ann Taylor black sweater with sequins and beads around the hem and cuffs ($4) and all in PERFECT condition. I saw many more things my heart desired but I could not talk my sensible self into making them mine, damn my practicality! Sadly they were closing shortly after I arrived so I didn&apos;t get time to peruse the books or furniture, of which they had some interesting stuff at a quick glance.

The woman that checked me out (heh heh) was a total sweetheart who clearly enjoyed her job :) I will definitely be back!

I could not in good conscience give a store that helps out animals less than five stars, especially after seeing the two adoptable kitties at Pick of the Litter when I went.

Great selection for a thrift store, everything was in good condition, lots of books (which is what I usually look for in thrift stores) and records.

It must have been a sale day, because for $1.35 I walked out of there with 5 books and a burning desire to adopt another kitty.

This is a great place! I donated 5 giant bags of stuff today and they were very helpful in getting it done quickly (I was in a hurry.) I love efficiency :)

My favorite thing is that they benefit my favorite - animals. I will now no longer be lazy and call for donations to be picked up for/from various other charities as I prefer all my donations help animals.

I didn&apos;t get much of a chance to look at what they offered for sale ( I am admittedly a horrible thrift store shopper.) But they are a decent size shop and are located in Burlingame so they probably get a fair amount of goodies.

They also had a good size parking lot which is a nice perk when needing to unload bags of stuff! Just be careful - Chula Vista Avenue is a 1-way street so you can&apos;t turn left out of the parking lot to get back to Broadway like your spouse might tell you to do...:)

I absolutely love this place, there are so many great finds. They carry a lot of Banana Republic, Ann Taylor, and a few designer pieces such as Burberry and True Religion.
The store is clean and doesn&apos;t smell like other thrift stores. The clothes are sorted by color, which makes easier to shop!
People prefer to donate their items here, rather than Goodwill, since all proceeds benefit the Peninsula Humane Society:)
BTW there is a metered parking lot, so I suggest you bring some change.

GREAT place to pick up some treasures!

It is also a great place to donate . . . i always take my bags of clothes and odd housewares there. You get a slip to use for your taxes (which YOU fill out) and it all goes to a great cause.

If you are a PSPCA volunteer, you get a discount! Score.

My sister and I agreed that if we were to live together in the future, we would have TONS I mean TONS of animals in our house.

Have you ever noticed how the best thrift stores are always the ones in strange little towns and suburbs? I DID! If you love cheap antiques and grandpa sweater like I do, this adorable little hole in the wall (with a parking lot bigger than its store) will surely satisfy your taste and your budget!

This is a great little thrift shop. I shop for certain vintage items that I won&apos;t reveal (cuz I don&apos;t want you to get them first)! If I find them here they are always half the price of similar items at Goodwill or St Vincent DiPaul.

The volunteers are pleasant and cheerful which makes my treasure hunt just that much more fun.

This place represents a very worthy cause in that proceeds go to the Peninsula Humane Society.

Pluses: they usually have one or two dogs or cats from the shelter on site that is available for adoption.  Smart way to increase exposure to the animals and get them adopted.  They also have what appears to be a well-sorted inventory of things people might actually want, not a whole lot of useless junk.

Minuses: it&apos;s very crampled and not in a very big place.  Also, it is staffed by well-meaning but S-L-O-W elderly folk, which means that there was a long, slow moving line at check-out.  We were going to buy something small, but bagged it because we didn&apos;t want to wait in line.  Don&apos;t shop here unless you&apos;re not in any kind of hurry and are willing to wait.

Only 3 stars because parking is a nightmare (metered) and it is painfully difficult to find. I went on the 3rd Tuesday of the month, which, I admit may have been a mistake. I ended up finding one t-shirt for $8 so it was 50% off for $4 which was about right for a t-shirt. Overall, a bit spendy, but I do appreciate that the funds go to help the animals. Cashiers were nice. People took advantage of the (only) 2 changing rooms that had a big sign saying ONLY 3 ITEMS by bringing 10 or so items in with them...the wait to try things on became ridiculous. They do have a 3 way mirror and I would recommend wearing something form fitting so you can try on most of your items outside the changing rooms in front of the mirror. Then you can pare down your selection before your final fit in the room.

Love this thrift shop. It&apos;s slightly off the main drag of Broadway, but the NICEST people run this place. Really nice stuff can be found there too! Got an incredible shabby chic cream colored coffee table there for only $15.  What&apos;s more it&apos;s for a worthy cause, and the people there are so helpful and kind. You can even schedule Saturday truck pickups if you want to donate things to their store. Can&apos;t say enough good things about this place: full of good karma, so good to give some back there too.

The best thrift shop around.  I have both purchased and donated items and you can find quality merchandise at great prices.  More importantly, the proceeds go to the homeless animals.

The employees are super nice, hard working and very accommodating.

I highly recommend this place for shopping!

I recently found out about this place from a volunteer at the Peninsula Humane Society.  I LOVE the idea of helping out the animals at the shelter, so I went to check this place out.

They have a meter parking lot, which is nice since finding parking on or right off of Broadway can sometimes be a huge hassle.  It&apos;s pretty small, so it&apos;s easy to keep tidy and organized and you can make donations easily in the front.

Every third Tuesday of the month is mobile adoption day where they bring in a couple shelter animals. To get more traffic this day in hopes of finding a home for one of the adorable dogs or cats, the whole store is 50% off.

Shopping and donating at this place is a win win! I always find a couple good books or CDs here for pennies on the dollar, and know my purchase is helping out my furry little friends over at the Humane Society!!

I liked the store better when it was in San Mateo in the bigger space (off Concar, now a carpet store) because they seemed to have more retro furniture and clothes. But I still love to donate my stuff to here because it benefits the PHS. They have a new-ish service where you can call ahead when you want to drop off items and they will come out to the curb (loading zone in front) and get them for you! What a great service.

I love the two ladies that run that place - you will probably leave with a pair of wings if you talk to them. They have the most incredible collection of Grandma&apos;s suitcases at all times. So, if I need something to match my vintage pumps - they will most likely have it. They have a lot of books, and some very nice furniture pieces. Service is incredible, and their prices are not to match. Most loved is their cause - POTL is actually an animal rescue and care organization that is suppored by their store. I really can&apos;t see how the world can&apos;t have more people like these.

This is the best thrift store in San Mateo County in my opinion.  Why? Not because they don&apos;t always have the largest or best selection, but  because unlike Goodwill and Salvation Army, they KNOW they&apos;re not a regular retail store and don&apos;t try to sell things at ridiculously high prices.  The best part is if something&apos;s missing a price tag, you can ask someone and they&apos;ll actually give you an amount unlike some of these other places that immediately confiscate the goods and tell you they have a &apos;no tag, no sale&apos; policy&apos; which is so stupid as it&apos;s not like they&apos;re selling rolex watches or something.

Love this store! It&apos;s much cleaner and better lit than most thrift stores. Prices are excellent. If you still have a VCR, you can find some great movies for $1 (or 50 cents on 1/2 price days). After you&apos;ve watched it, donate it back and get a tax deductible receipt. Great selection of pet stuff. Also good books, furniture... I&apos;ve even seen wedding dresses!

Some of my scores: Two very fancy dog beds, $7.50&amp;$10, which would cost $60 and $120 new. Dinnerware for 4, $9. A couple of like-new purses, $4 each. A gorgeous Lane cedar chest, $50.

The one negative is that check-out is very slow, but it&apos;s staffed with (mostly elderly) volunteers, so you have to be patient.

I donate all my stuff here because all the proceeds go to help the animals.

I&apos;m so weak when it comes to adorable animals.  This thrift shops proceeds help the ASPCA, how cool!  They had a cat in the store who was up for adoption, she was so cute, I just petted her while my boyfriend was scoping out the book section.    The selection on clothes looked thin, but this place seemed to have a lot of nick knacks that could be good finds.  I am thumbs up for a place that supports the welfare of animals.

I started becoming disenchanted with thrift stores on the peninsula. They were all way overpriced and the stuff was mostly trash. I felt this way until I discovered Pick of the Litter. It is a lot smaller than Goodwill or the Salvation Army, but it is stocked with great treasures and everything is cheap! I&apos;ve found Ferragamo shoes for $5, amazing records for pennies and great jewelry. This place really is a gem, I almost wish I could keep it to myself, but considering that the profits go to the SPCA, everyone should know about it. I also love that sometimes there are cats waiting to be adopted that you can pet while looking around. They also have 50% off sales, mostly on holidays for you that are looking for extra deals.

I am a fairly regular patron of &quot;The Pick&quot;.  I am always happy to purchase goods there to benefit the animals.  The volunteers are friendly and helpful.  I have come away with some great finds over the years.  There are my three stars.  Two were left blank because of the following.  A great deal of the merchandise sits in the store for way too long.  If things don&apos;t move after a certain period of time, they should be put in a clearance area at rock bottom price and off loaded. At times, the line at the register becomes exceedingly long. I have left without purchasing something if I see this happening.  I have waited as long as 20 minutes to check out.  It would be nice if there were someone in back that could pinch hit if it was apparent the cashier was overwhelmed. Help her bag and wrap or open another register! Just peek over and see how she is doing every 15 minutes or so.  I am not talking about sale Tuesdays.  It can get busy on just a regular day.  Please visit the store.  It is such a wonderful cause!

This thrift store rocks!  Not only does it benefit a great cause...but there seems to be ample parking (quarter for half an hour)&amp;lots of interesting goodies.  I dropped off a donation today&amp;wound up buying a TON of baby/kids clothes for less than $2 a piece.  i also saw a wide variety of furniture&amp;clothes.  The books...omg, the BOOKS!  Tons and tons of great reads that are, get this, fairly well organized!   Go on Tuesdays where everything is half off (except for jewelry).  I bought two anthologies for $1 (total!).   Ok so the cashier may have forgotten to given me the discount on a couple of items, but it&apos;s a great cause so I didn&apos;t mind terribly.

I really enjoy coming here. Any chance i get on my free days i hop on over to this little treasure. I always head first to the books section to find some neat books to pick up. They have by far the largest selection of books in a thrift store compared to other thrift shop&apos;s... while probing for a neat novel to pick up i occasionally pet the cats that just chill on top of the cage waiting for a foster home. :( i wish i can just take them all home. They have the neatest treasures sometimes. I often look at their craft and arts drawers and find some neat things as well. I also got a neat steal for a Halloween costume during Halloween season. It was perfect for my best friend&apos;s costume. So i just had to get it. and got it i did.  i also got some neat jewelry finds here. I was able to find a nice steal in the jewelry counter . i got a $5 ring that is adorable and to my surprise it is 100% silver. So i wear it on the daily since i am sensitive to fake metals. anyways. COME HERE IF U LIKE DIGGING FOR TREASURES LIKE ME :) :) .

oh yes and cant forget !
ALL PROCEEDS GO TO SPCA!
so yay! :)

the old ladies working here are so nice :) especially the one with the nice nails! she always tells me about how she got them just done! lols

I&apos;ve found some cool stuff here (a wine cork-board making kit!?).  They are part of the Peninsula Humane Society, so it is a good cause to support.  I love turning a corner around some clothes and seeing a kitty just hanging out, hoping to be adopted.
