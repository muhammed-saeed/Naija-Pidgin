 8.8 Highly Recommended 

 Food   9     Ambience   7     Service   9     Value   10    


The Hi-Tech Chinese Super Fast Food restaurant in the town. The founder of Yum Sing Express has been running two successful fine dining restaurants for over 20 years in South Australia. After the experience of so many years in food industry, the founder compiled his best selling dishes&amp;innovate them to become fast&amp;easy prepare with quality sealed within the box. The Satay Chicken is the one must not be missed.
And the value is good too...

Avoid, avoid, avoid, last day in Adelaide and we chose a restaurant at lunchtime on a Saturday with no one in it, alarm bells should have gone off. Boy outside trying to entice you in, big mistake. Food not fresh by no means!
