 Yolo County DA reports surge in scams targeting seniors 
The Yolo County District Attorney&apos;s Office is alerting residents to a surge in scams targeting older adults in the county.

Reports from victims in West Sacramento, Davis and Woodland indicate that phony sweepstakes and the &quot;Grandma, It&apos;s Me&quot; telephone scams are continuing to be used to trick people into wiring money outside the country, according to a District Attorney&apos;s Office news release.

In one instance, more than $4,000 was lost in a phony sweepstakes scam after a con artist pretending to be from the Federal Trade Commission persuaded a local senior citizen to wire money to Costa Rica, officials said. In another recent case, an elderly woman was tricked into sending all the money she had in her savings account to someone claiming to be her grandson who was out of the country and in trouble. She believed him and sent the money in an effort to help.

 Students arrested for Woodland middle school &apos;works bomb&apos; 
Two juveniles were arrested this afternoon after they allegedly placed a homemade explosive device in a school cafeteria trash can in Woodland.

At 12:22 p.m., a Woodland Police Department school resource officer was called to investigate an explosion at Douglass Middle School at 525 Granada Drive. School officials had already detained two boys, both students at the school, who were allegedly responsible for the explosion.

Police said the students created a &quot;works bomb&quot; and dropped in into a trash can in the cafeteria. The device is made of common household items that are placed in a plastic container and sealed. A chemical reaction occurs that releases gases, which eventually cause the plastic container to rupture, creating a loud noise, according to a Police Department news release.

He was also arrested on suspicion of burglary of a vehicle, a charge related to another officer&apos;s independent investigation.

 Possible West Sacramento shooting suspect killed in firefight 
 

Interstate 80 from West Sacramento to Davis is now open in both directions after 6 hours of closure after a suspected gunman crashed his first carjacked pickup truck in West Sacramento.

The hunt for the suspect, who also stole a tractor and ditched a second hijacked vehicle, involved swarms of officers and continues across a wide area of Sacramento.

 Yolo Causeway shutdown stops commuters in their tracks 

 Here is the story as it is unfolding: 

8:26 p.m.

A man who exchanged gunfire with deputies and who may be the West Sacramento shooting suspect is dead, said Sheriff&apos;s spokesman Deputy Jason Ramos.

Firefighters said in scanner traffic that flareups in the apartment fire are continuing, but they are worried about damaging the crime scene in their efforts to extinguish it.

8:07 p.m.

Authorities are making their way into an apartment in the 1900 block of Ethan Way after Sacramento Sheriff&apos;s deputies fired on a possible suspect in today&apos;s West Sacramento shootings and carjackings.

&quot;It&apos;s certainly very possible,&quot; it&apos;s him, said Sheriff&apos;s spokesman Deputy Jason Ramos. &quot;We&apos;re waiting to hear if he&apos;s dead.&quot;

The suspect was outside the apartment when deputies fired on him, Ramos said. He did not know if the man had fired on deputies.

Investigators began focusing on the apartment about 6 p.m., Ramos said.

&quot;It&apos;s a place that our investigation brought us to. I don&apos;t want to say how obviously. This place came on our radar.&quot;

A fire started inside the target apartment at some point but was under control, he said. &quot;How that was started, we don&apos;t know yet,&quot; Ramos said.

7:46 p.m.

Police believe they may have the man wanted in connection with the West Sacramento shooting and carjackings barricaded in an Arden Arcade apartment.

That apartment on the 1900 block of Ethan Way apparently caught fire following a firefight between officers and the suspect. Sacramento sheriff&apos;s spokesman Jason Ramos said it is &quot;certainly very possible&quot; that the suspect is the man wanted for the day-long ordeal that started this morning in West Sacramento.

6:15 p.m.

West Sacramento police Sgt. Nathan Steele reports that police have discovered a third carjacking they believe is tied to the suspect.

Steele said he did not have much information, but that police believe the newly discovered carjacking was the first to occur, shortly after the suspect fired at employees arriving to work at a Harbor Boulevard machine shop and before he stole a pickup that he later crashed on Interstate 80&apos;s Yolo Causeway.

Meanwhile, Sacramento County sheriff&apos;s deputies are shrinking their perimeter around Lerwick Drive and might soon leave the scene altogether, without a suspect in custody.

5:14 p.m.

Sacramento County sheriff&apos;s deputies have released the man they had detained as they continue to search for the suspect associated with a stolen car found abandoned in northeastern Sacramento County.

Authorities have not identified the man who was detained.

Another Lerwick Road resident, Al Purdy, said he was handcuffed and placed in the back of a squad car after a Ford F150 pick up truck pulled up in front of his house around 11:30 a.m.

Purdy, who had taken the day off from his job at the U.S. Postal Service, said and a young man, who fit the suspect&apos;s description, got out of the truck and walked away. The truck matched the description of the pickup stolen in Yolo County.

&quot;All of a sudden all there was police activity in front of the house. Guns were pointed at me. I was cuffed and put in the back of a squad car. They searched my house,&quot; Purdy said.

3:03 p.m.

A sheriff&apos;s helicopter is hovering over the area and through a speaker is urging the residents of 314 Lerwick Road to come out with their hands up.

2:26 p.m.

Sacramento County Sheriff&apos;s spokesman Jason Ramos said deputies have detained a white male in the area near Lerwick Road and Morse Avenue where the second carjacked vehicle was found.

Detectives believe the man is responsible for stealing the car, but Ramos said they are not sure the incident is connected with the carjacking in West Sacramento.

12:29 p.m.

Interstate 80 from West Sacramento to Davis is now open in both directions after 6 hours of closure.

The freeway was closed about 6:20 a.m. when the suspect crashed his initial carjacked pickup truck in West Sacramento.

A tow truck has carried away the pickup and officials said that allows for the opening of the interstate.

11:50 a.m.

The brown Ford F150 has apparently been found miles away from where it was carjacked, police said.

Authorities apparently have found the pick-up at Lerwick Road and Morse Avenue along the Capitol City Freeway in Arden Arcade.

11:40 a.m.

Police now say that an empty rifle case was found at the West Sacramento machine shop where the entire incident began this morning when the suspect shot at employees.

 Grandparent scam cheats Woodland woman out of $14,000 
A Woodland grandmother was recently bilked out of $14,000 when she fell for a well-known telephone scam.

Woodland police called attention to the swindle and released tips on how to avoid what is commonly called the &quot;Grandparent Scam.&quot; In the most recent instance it went like this:

The woman received a call from a person claiming to be her grandson. He told her that he had been arrested in Canada following a traffic accident and needed money to fix the vehicle.

She wired $1,000.

Over the next few weeks, more phone calls were received from the phony grandson and his phony attorney. Money was needed to help defend a lawsuit stemming from the made-up car crash, the scammers said.

The Woodland grandmother kept making wire transfers and is now out $14,000, said police. Police were contacted March 7 by the woman who finally figured out she had been scammed.

Tips to avoid the scam:

- Verify the caller&apos;s identity by asking personal questions a stranger could not answer.

- Resist acting immediately

- Call someone you know to help verify the story.

- Avoid giving credit card or bank information to anyone you don&apos;t know personally.

 Two men convicted of Woodland Taco Bell robbery 
A Yolo County jury has convicted two men in the armed robbery of a Woodland fast-food restaurant.

Aaron Dufour, 25, of Woodland, and Nathan Espinoza, 24, of Sacramento, were convicted of the Dec. 9, 2009 robbery of the Woodland Taco Bell. The jury also convicted Dufour of robberies of two other Woodland businesses in November 2009, Little Caesar&apos;s Pizza restaurant and an AM/PM gas station, according to a Yolo County District Attorney&apos;s Office news release.

Officials said that Dufour -- wearing a dark mask, dark gloves and dark hooded sweatshirt -- entered all three businesses, indicated that he had a gun and demanded money. Espinoza drove the car that witnesses saw leaving the Taco Bell robbery, and led police on a high-speed chase from Woodland to Davis, eventually crashing the car.

Dufour and Espinoza are to be sentenced Aug. 28 by Yolo County Superior Court Judge Stephen Mock.
