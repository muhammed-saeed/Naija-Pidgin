 7. Who was Ray Kroc? 
Ray Kroc was the founder of McDonald&apos;s.


Back in 1954, as a 52-year-old salesman, Ray Kroc was an exclusive distributor for &quot;Multimixer&quot; milkshake machines when he came across the small hamburger stand of Dick and Mac McDonald in San Bernardino, California. He took one look at the rapidly moving line of customers buying bags of hamburgers and French fries and thought, &quot;This will go Anyplace!&quot;


After the McDonald brothers explained that they didn&apos;t have the personal desire to oversee the expansion of their concept across the nation, Ray Kroc became their exclusive franchising agent for the entire country. A great salesman had discovered his ultimate product. Kroc formed the new franchising company on March 2, 1955, under the name of McDonald&apos;s System, Inc. This was the start of McDonald&apos;s, as we know it today.


Many of our core values and guiding principles that are the foundation of our business today were developed throughout the years by Ray Kroc.


 8. Who runs McDonald&apos;s Canada today? 
John Betts, President, McDonald&apos;s Canada is moving the company forward into the new millennium with a continued commitment to our people and our customers


 9. I have food allergies . How do I know which McDonald&apos;s products I can eat? 
McDonald&apos;s has assumed a leadership role in ensuring, where possible, the development of new food products that do not include the use of unnecessary allergens.


McDonald&apos;s provides a complete ingredient and nutrition breakdown called McDonald&apos;s Food Facts, which is available in every McDonald&apos;s restaurant across Canada and online under Our Food . By referencing Food Facts prior to a purchase, consumers with allergies can easily identify any ingredients that they may be sensitive to.


 In addition, with McDonald&apos;s system, your meal can be prepared to your individual specifications on every visit . It can be, but we should not guarantee that any certain product has been made allergen free - i.e., Big Mac - no onions. Because of the proximity of onions to lettuce, we can only make a best effort to remove onions. Our restaurants should not be promising/guaranteeing that the product is &quot;onion&quot; free.


 10. What is McDonald&apos;s doing to help the environment? 
McDonald&apos;s is recognized as an environmental leader for our commitment and our actions - to protect the environment for future generations. We recognize that our customers&apos; quality of life tomorrow will be affected by our environmental efforts today.


McDonald&apos;s Canada demonstrated industry leadership in the 1980&apos;s by leading the foodservice industry in phasing out CFCs in the manufacturing of polystyrene foam food containers. We still have foam breakfast packaging.


We continually monitor and refine our Waste Reduction Action Plan that focuses on the three R&apos;s - Reduce, Reuse and Recycle - in our restaurants and with our suppliers. McDonald&apos;s has always been responsive to our customers and, over the years, has sought the advice of industry experts and the environmental community to ensure that we continue to make a difference in this important area.


McDonald&apos;s is the largest user of recycled paper in our industry, which includes such items as trayliners, fry boxes, serviettes, carry out bags and drink holders.


The most significant reduction of packaging has occurred behind the counter at McDonald&apos;s restaurant locations. A decrease in the cardboard weight of corrugated containers and the introduction of larger shipping containers has helped minimize the amount of packaging materials required by McDonald&apos;s.


 11. What is McDonald&apos;s policy about protecting the rain forest? 
Our global rainforest policy is simple: we do not purchase beef from rainforests or recently deforested land.


This rain forest policy is strictly enforced and closely monitored. Any McDonald&apos;s supplier that is found to deviate from the policy or cannot prove compliance will be immediately discontinued.


 12. How can I get a donation from McDonald&apos;s? 
McDonald&apos;s founder Ray Kroc built the company on the principle of giving back to the communities in which we do business. That same basic philosophy still holds true at McDonald&apos;s today.


A McDonald&apos;s franchisee and his/her team can be found supporting various local schools, youth athletic teams, senior citizens&apos; groups, safety awareness campaigns, literacy programs, environmental projects and local fundraising initiatives in their communities.


McDonald&apos;s national, registered charity, Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) , was established in 1982. It has one simple objective: to help children in need. Ronald McDonald House Charities supports Ronald McDonald Houses throughout Canada and other registered charities that help improve the physical and emotional quality of life for children with life-threatening illnesses or disabilities.


 13. How can I become a McDonald&apos;s franchisee? 
McDonald&apos;s is always looking for hard working men and women with an entrepreneurial passion. We continue to attract highly qualified and motivated individuals from a diversity of cultures. In Canada today, more than 70 per cent of our restaurants are owned and operated by independent business people who hire locally and are committed to giving back to the communities in which they operate.


For a franchise information package, please call the McDonald&apos;s Franchising Department at (416) 446-3870.


 14. How can I get a Happy Meal® Toy that I missed? 
Happy Meal toys and other McDonald&apos;s premiums are distributed directly to our restaurants for in-restaurant promotions. Toys and premiums are not available through the McDonald&apos;s corporate offices. You may want to contact the following collector&apos;s club:


McDonald&apos;s Collector&apos;s Club
1153 South Lee Street
Des Plaines, IL
60016


The Club requests that all correspondence include a self-addressed, stamped envelope. The Club may also be contacted by visiting www.mcdclub.com .


It&apos;s important to know that the McDonald&apos;s Collector&apos;s Club is an independent group which is not affiliated with McDonald&apos;s Restaurants of Canada Limited. They may, however, be able to assist you in your search for toys and premiums.


 15. How do I contact McDonald&apos;s Canada head office?

 16. Does McDonald&apos;s use 100% beef in its hamburgers? 
Yes. McDonald&apos;s hamburgers are made with 100% beef - no additives or fillers- and seasoned only with salt and pepper.


At McDonald&apos;s, we use only quality beef and other raw ingredients. McDonald&apos;s hamburgers are made from the same cuts of meat that you would buy at your local supermarket.


 17. Where does McDonald&apos;s source their ingredients? 
McDonald&apos;s sources most of its ingredients from over 100 top Canadian suppliers.


At McDonald&apos;s, we essentially shop where you shop. Brand names that you&apos;ll find behind the counter at our restaurants include: Coca-Cola, Danone, Heinz, McCain, Minute Maid, Mother Parker&apos;s, Nestle, Quaker and Saputo.


 18. Who are the suppliers to McDonald&apos;s Canada? Aren&apos;t you really just a big U.S. burger chain? 
No. McDonald&apos;s Restaurants of Canada Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of McDonald&apos;s Corporation. At McDonald&apos;s, we operate locally, employing and sourcing suppliers in the countries and communities in which we do business.


In 2005, McDonald&apos;s purchased more than $700 million worth of food and paper goods from our Canadian suppliers - that&apos;s more than 90 per cent of our total purchases for that year.


 19. How does McDonald&apos;s ensure that food is prepared properly? 
Serving our customers a great tasting, quality meal is our top priority. All menu items at McDonald&apos;s are prepared for our customers under a carefully monitored process using specialized equipment.


For example, we conduct a series of tests and restaurant audits every day to ensure that our procedures are being followed and our high standards are being met.


We train our crew members on food safety and food handling processes.Trainees work shoulder-to-shoulder with crew trainers while they learn the operational skills necessary for running each of the 25 positions in our restaurant - from front counter to the grill area.


 20. How do you train your employees? 
At McDonald&apos;s, training never stops. Crew members are trained extensively on all food safety and food handling processes. Our trainees work shoulder-to-shoulder with crew trainers while they learn the operational skills necessary for running each of the 25 positions in our restaurant - from front counter to the grill area.


We believe in fostering growth. All managers and franchisees receive business management and restaurant operations training at one of McDonald&apos;s premier, state-of-the-art training facilities: Hamburger University or the Canadian Institute of Hamburgerology.


 21. Who ensures that McDonald&apos;s is providing me with a quality meal? 
McDonald&apos;s meets or exceeds the strict standards set by all appropriate government and regulatory bodies. For example, our beef is purchased only from government inspected and approved facilities.


At McDonald&apos;s, we impose our own high standards on ourselves and our suppliers. These self-imposed standards are often more rigorous than those imposed on us by government and regulatory bodies.


 22. Where can I get information about the ingredients in my McDonald&apos;s meal? 
McDonald&apos;s &quot;Food Facts&quot; brochure provides customers with a complete list of ingredients for regular menu items and includes detailed nutrition information, including calories, carbohydrates, sodium and fat content.
