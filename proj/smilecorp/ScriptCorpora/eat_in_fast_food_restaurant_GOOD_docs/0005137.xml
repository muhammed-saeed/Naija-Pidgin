Council to hear redesign plans for restaurant
 October 24, 1994 | By Ellen Gamerman | Ellen Gamerman,Sun Staff Writer 
Annapolis citizens will offer their views on the proposed redesigns of a popular downtown eatery and a fast-food restaurant tonight when the City Council meets at 7:30 p.m. in City Hall.

First on the agenda is a plan to rebuild part of Harry Browne&apos;s, at 66 State Circle, near the State House.
 
Rusty Romo, the restaurant&apos;s owner, wants to enclose the outdoor dining area, which seats about 60 people. Mr. Romo said he&apos;d lose about 15 seats, but could use the space year-round. The enclosure would take about four months to complete, he said.

&quot;We&apos;re really not asking for a whole lot, just the enclosure of an existing space,&quot; said Mr. Romo, whose plan has been approved by the Historic District Commission.

But don&apos;t most people like to dine alfresco?

&quot;Basically the Maryland weather stinks,&quot; Mr. Romo said. &quot;I&apos;ve found over the last 15 years, it&apos;s either been too hot or raining or covered in leaves or bugs or bees.&quot;

Fans of fast-food might take particular interest in the second item on the City Council&apos;s docket. The McDonald&apos;s Corp. wants to to bring its restaurant at 1941 West St. in line with the times.

The redesign plan for the restaurant, last rebuilt in 1963, calls for more windows and a more narrow, sleek shape, said Stanley Fine, a Baltimore lawyer representing the fast-food giant.

The restaurant also would change its drive-through design by creating three windows, one for ordering, one for paying and one for food pick-up. Mr. Fine said the lone window in the current design makes waiting for burger and fries longer than it needs to be.
