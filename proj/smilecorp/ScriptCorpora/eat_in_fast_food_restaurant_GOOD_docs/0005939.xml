		Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers: Apple Valley, MN 

 November 9th, 2006 in Apple Valley , Restaurants , South Metro 
 


If you haven’t noticed, the defunct eyesore that was located at the corner of 42 and Cedar is finally gone. I realize it might have been difficult with the political sign waving that has been happening on that corner for the past week or so but, nevertheless, it’s gone.

The Burger King, that has been closed for years (since 2003?) has been torn down and a new pile of shit chain is going up in its place. Yes, this is *exactly* what Apple Valley needs—yet another eyesore to go up in BK’s place.

 Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers is building a new location right in the *real* heart of Apple Valley (not the fake center that they are trying to create over by Founders and Galaxie which I will get into in a different post tonight). Why oh why did the Apple Valley City Council decide that a brick and stucco building would be a better replacement for the abandoned eyesore at the corner? It’s not like it should be surprising being that they love the 153rd/Galaxie hellhole they have created.
Anyway, my problems with Raising Cane’s doesn’t stop with their look…It continues with their amazing menu of *four* items and the fact that they are located within 1000 feet of two other chicken serving restaurants (KFC and Buffalo Wild Wings ). Wow!




If Burger King couldn’t succeed in that awful location (getting in and out requires you to drive down 42 to the McDonald’s entrance or enter from southbound Cedar) do you really think that some unknown chain selling four meals will?

I’ll be sure to stop in and suffer the first bellybombing fried chicken ingestion so that the rest of you can remain safe at one of the 1000 other chain restaurants in town.

I honestly believe that a chain restaurant moratorium would be in the best interests of Apple Valley. Then again, what do I know other than where to eat decent food?

Bill and Kim, You never know, Raising Cane’s might be good. People down in Louisiana know a thing or two about food! There is no debating that…..it’ll beat having a vacant building there. Perhaps Apple Valley can do something to make it more accessible, don’t see an easy fix to that however. If the location is so bad and you don’t want a food joint, what do you think would have worked in that space. A real nice oil and lube place? LOL! Have a nice day.

Cane’s is leeching on your area too? What a freaking joke of a restaurant! No salads, no grilled“fingers”, nothing but MSG in all of the food, packaged slaw (weak AND bland), cold fries, soggy“toast,”terrible service, and that“signature”sauce? Pffft, mayo, ketchup, worcestershire, garlic salt, and black pepper. Just another flash in the pan, they should’ve just stayed in LA. See you at BW3′s (Buffalo Wild Wings for the less experienced)

Adam,

Sorry but we don’t tend to share the same obsession with fried chicken that the“South”seems to.

Hopefully this restaurant will fail quickly and become yet another vacant storefront to be replaced by some other worthless chain.

well it seems you have made up your mind that you won’t like it already without trying it…so probably nothing anyone will say will do anything to change that but i grew up in Louisiana and Cane’s is very simple but i have never had“soggy fries”or“bland coleslaw”like the other commenter…i have only had good experiences and frankly fast food in the south is hardly a dining experience (not like it is here but at least in minnesota the people are fairly polite where in the south people are plain rude in fast food)the ambiance is better than most fast food joints and i know they don’t use MSG at all in their food…i don’t know where that came from…i knew many people that worked there in their college days and have said that the company is a decent company (pay decently and have benefits)and a fun place to work so that should count for something too…frankly i am excited it is coming to town as it does have good fried chicken and lemonade and on a spring/summer day- that’s a perfect combo!! obviously it isn’t a healthy choice really but if you want that then any fast food is pretty much out…you should try it before heckling…you may find it’s pretty tasty even though it’s a simple menu

I can’t find any conclusive evidence of what the other poster claimed about their using MSG, but normally when a national chain doesn’t use MSG in their cooking they are proud of it.

In this case, I see nothing on their website that states that they don’t use MSG in their foods so neither of your comments can be easily validated.

You need to open your mind (and your Mouth) and try raisng cane’s. From the tone of your blog it must be hard for you to close your mouth very long (ha ha)…but I must tell you…. I have been to Raisng Cane’s and though I was at first shocked by the limited menu, it was fast that I was wooowed by the great chicken, the hot crispy fries and the wonderful Texas toast. Bill this is not KFC style greasey fried chicken, this is healthy, fresh chicken, never frozen flash fried to order in a light and tastie batter. Give it a try, you may have a new favorite roost……and the people behind the counter, they act like they work for a great one store outfit, they are pumped, and happy to be working at Raising Cane’s.

Oh and the Iced Tea, it is to die for!!!

You sound like a shill. Especially after I read your second comment which was nothing more than an advertisement.

You might want to refrain from doing that in the future—it doesn’t make anyone want to pay attention to anything you have to say.

I am not a shill, just a fan. Raising Caine’s is hard to describe till you go there and try it. It really is like no other chicken, and tha passion of the staff flows through at least in the south.

I am going to have some this week-end, I hope you give it a try yourself.

Thanks for the Blog.

I find it odd that you are an employee of a company located in St Paul, MN that specializes in funding property acquisitions—especially many which are chain restaurants.

It doesn’t surprise me at all why you are so fond of Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers and why you would be getting some this weekend when they open here in Apple Valley.

That’s why I think you’re a shill.

Man you guys are tough. I am not from the south, I grew up on a minnesota farm so you are right I don’t know my southern tea well.

I do like the chicken Cane’s serves and thought that this was the space to share my feelings. I am sorry that you many of you are so hostile, I wish you joy and peace in your life.

It is only chicken–there is room in this world for chicken lovers, well run chicken chains from the south and Minnesota farm boys.

It might not hurt to give it a try, I think the slogan is WHAT ARE YOU–CHICKEN?

Again, best wishes to you all–I am going to try it tonight.

Hans,

Nice ownage, thanks.

He’s probably the VP for AEI Fund Management (from the research I’ve done on him) and his company funds property acquisitions, many of which are fast food or other chain restaurants (or businesses in general like Auto Zone).

So, I have a feeling that George from AEI Fund Management is trying to get people that read my blog (I’m a top hit for“Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers”and the #1 hit for“Raising Cane’s Apple Valley”) to think that Cane’s is really better than it is. Afterall, they have a financial stake in how this business does.

Too bad this is only an ethical issue and isn’t illegal.

I think your comments would carry a little more credibility if:

1. you had actually been to Raising Canes.
2. you didn’t complain about it being a chain, and yet list Houlihan’s (a nice *locally owned and operated family restaurant* from Leawood, KS) at the top of your favorite restaurant list. Is Bennigan’s also one of your favorites?

Raising Cane’s is great. I haven’t been to this new location yet, but am anxious to try it. Is it open yet?

While you are correct, I do prefer to eat at non-chains in general, what you happen to be referring to is my displeasure with more and more chains cropping up in Apple Valley, not Eagan.

Thanks for the comment.

I have no stake in Rasing Canes. My employer does not either.

We also do not have any auto zones.

I did find your site as I was researching the concept. I do not believe this to be either illeagal or unethical.

I did have some chicken tonight and I enjoyed it.

I do hope people try it–then let the chips fall where they may.

I do get a kick out of you, you take this stuff a lttle to seriously for me.

and to the gentleman that feels I am“lying”about my upbring–I am not. I grew up right here in minnesota and live here today. There is no consperiacy here. sorry if that is a let down. I just like the food.

Best wishes,

George

Darren, a moron, writes in that Cane’s was so packed today that he had to use KFC’s lot…

I find that odd as KFC isn’t immediately next door and I have my suspicions that if it were really that crowded, no one with half a brain would continue to wait for nothing more than fried chicken.

I’m not going to bother to post Darren’s e-mail which claims I’m“uneducated”but if true his comments prove that he’s just another moronic sheep running to wait in line for nothing more than fast food fried chicken with a different name.

Way to go Darren! You win the Silver medal for being one of this week’s top douchebags to e-mail me.

I agree putting a chicken place in that spot was just stupid on the other hand KFC if you havnt ate there in the last few years has gone down hill. I myself keep trying thinking maybe I just got em at a bad time but heck lately its always a bad time. I personally think the”buck”would have been much better. We need another Starbucks with a drive thru and I believe that would have been the perfect spot. This Cane Chicken place only having 4 things on the menu wont last.

I was shocked that the Starbucks over by Rainbow closed. I didn’t think that Starbucks ever closed! I’ve never ever stepped foot in one before (and my caffeine free lifestyle will continue to keep me out) but the way that they seem to thrive *everywhere* else I was just in awe that they closed up shop in that seemingly busy strip mall.

Tried this place today…the menu is what you’d expect…chicken fingers…and they were good. but how good (or how bad for that matter) can a chicken finger be? My problem with this place is that if you have a chicken finger restaurant…you would assume they would offer various dipping sauces and condiments? Not so, they only had cane’s creamy dipping sauce…my kid wanted bbq or sweat and sour, they didn’t have it. They also didn’t serve milk. Not a real good place for kids…that being said they won’t last 2 years at that location that is impossible to get thru from any direction except south to north on cedar.

Those came with numerous dipping sauces.

To the uninitiated,

I am from Louisiana and, until recently, did not even realize that there were Cane’s restaurants outside of this state. Considering the success that they have had, I assure you that your new Cane’s location is not going anywhere. I am shocked and amazed that you people even discuss KFC or Buffalo Wild Wings in the same sentence as Canes; both are grossly inferior. I am not a Cane’s employee, nor do I even eat Canes more than 4 times a month (not the healthiest food out there). But I am certain, unless the palates of its patrons in this area are so far skewed from those of my neck of the woods, they will be just as successful there.

Joe,

Let’s rehash the details:

1. Restaurants (including a Starbucks) don’t succeed very well in our area. This particular location housed a Burger King before.

2. This location is not easily accessible from either main road it is adjacent to and you have to pass several other similar restaurants to get to it.

3. They have a single dipping sauce? While in the South this might be acceptable (mayo and ketchup?!) it won’t fly here when there are numerous other choices in the area that offer a much better selection.

I’m not promising that it won’t last but it’s highly unlikely.

Bill,

I see a lot of judgmental pessimism coming from you about Raising Cane’s. I hope that you have tried it by now. I have and I found that the chicken fingers (though the only item on the menu) were excellent, and the sauce was very good as well.

I am curious about your opinion on“Chipotle”or“Noodles and Company.”Both these restaurants have found a lot of success with only serving one item on the menu. Have you had a chance to try“Lion’s Tap”in Eden Prairie? They too focus on one item on the menu, and in my opinion, as well as many others’serve the best burgers in town.

This seems to be a successful trend at these establishments, and I have a feeling it’s because the food tastes better, not because you have a less then perfect access to the drive-through.

I feel that being the wise restaurant connoisseur that you are, you should really try the food instead of whining about the aesthetics of the exterior and previous tenants at that location. You may find despite your opinions on architecture and location choice, the food actually tastes great.

Good Luck,

John

I neither work for Raising Cane’s or any other restaurants mentioned above. I’m Just thought it would be good for you to know.

 I see a lot of judgmental pessimism coming from you about Raising Cane’s. I hope that you have tried it by now. 

Sorry, I have been busy at other restaurants since Raising Cane’s opened like Osaka Seafood and Steakhouse next door. Fast food isn’t high on my priority list especially when there’s a threat of MSG involved.

 I have and I found that the chicken fingers (though the only item on the menu) were excellent, and the sauce was very good as well. 

I’m thrilled for you that your simple tastes have been met. While I like mayo and ketchup, I would just rather it not be on chicken. I prefer a multitude of other sauces such as BBQ, ranch, blue cheese, honey mustard, sweet and sour, and buffalo. YMMV.

 I am curious about your opinion on“Chipotle”or“Noodles and Company.”Both these restaurants have found a lot of success with only serving one item on the menu. 

I’ll break this down for you into two parts:

1. Chipotle

While Chipotle serves“one”kind of food (burritos) it cannot even come close to being compared to Raising Cane’s one meat. Which the only difference is in how many pieces of chicken you get. Chipotle serves beef, pork, chicken with a variety of beans or sauteed veggies, guac, and sour cream along with cheese. You could also dump the tortilla and just eat it as a salad but whatever.

They aren’t even in the same league.

2. Noodles and Company

Again, you’re thinking incorrectly here. Yes, they serve“one”kind of food—something that includes noodles (well, not all of their soups and not their salads but we’ll ignore that). They also offer beef or two different kinds of chicken (and it doesn’t only differ by the number of pieces they put on your plate like Raising Cane’s“variety”) as well as about 16 main entrees (which you can mix and match with something like the“pick three”) but we’ll ignore that here even though it’s fairly significant.

They aren’t even in the same league.

 Have you had a chance to try“Lion’s Tap”in Eden Prairie? They too focus on one item on the menu, and in my opinion, as well as many others’serve the best burgers in town. 

There you go, you finally mentioned a restaurant that is quite a bit closer in operation to Raising Cane’s, The Lions Tap in Eden Prairie.

It seems that plenty of people share your opinion on the Lions Tap, and while I have mentioned in the above post (IIRC, I didn’t bother to read it) that they have the best burgers it’s mostly a tongue-in-cheek comment repeating the mantra that many Metro individuals have even if they’ve never tried the burger which I liken it to people repeatedly saying that if you’re an outdoorsy type that you should go to the BWCA because it’s just so beautiful—even when most of them haven’t ever been there or anywhere else in the state for that matter.

Their burgers are just ok. They demand that they cook them“Medium”which is a fucking atrocity that’s been gaining more and more momentum in the days of our ever increasing litigious society where everyone else is responsible for your choices and not you as an individual. Their burgers remind me very much of In‘N Out burgers which also kinda suck. Give me a juicy, medium-rare, homemade burger any day. If you’re looking for something that’s overcooked, go to White Castle .

 This seems to be a successful trend at these establishments, and I have a feeling it’s because the food tastes better, not because you have a less then perfect access to the drive-through. 

You misspelled“restaurant”as“drive-through”.

 I’m Just thought it would be good for you to know. 

I’m glad that I could be given such a thorough lesson. I hope you learned something too.

Funny story about Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers in Apple Valley:

So my coworker, Jen, goes to Raising Caneâ€™s and doesnâ€™t realize they only serve chicken fingers. She is squinting at the menu because she isnâ€™t wearing her glasses and the guy behind the counter says, â€œI bet I know what you want.â€

Jen gives him a confused look and says, â€œWhat do you think I want?â€

â€œChicken fingers.â€

Jen says, â€œNo, I donâ€™t like chicken fingers.â€

The guys says, â€œWell, thatâ€™s all we have hereâ€ and she tells him, â€œWhat kind of restaurant only has chicken fingers?â€

Jen eventually decides on one of the chicken finger meals, but doesnâ€™t want the coleslaw that comes with it.
The guy behind the counter says with a straight face:

â€œOh, you can substitute with whatever you want. We can give you another chicken finger, more toast, or some more fries.â€

Meanwhile Jen is thinking to herself, â€œWow, whatever I want. Three things Iâ€™m already getting, awesome.â€

I’ve heard that this chicken is very good. Well I went there for lunch today and the chicken was moist and the bread was excellent, sauce wasn’t too bad. But the breading didn’t stay on the chicken, it was hard to eat it on the go. The fries were warm and limp. The place was busy at 1:30pm and yes, KFC is right next door, Bill. So I can see if that person had to park next door in your previous comments. I was a little surprised at how much it was also. If I ever go back, I’m eating the chicken with a fork and the tea is very good also. Oh, and make sure you have the correct order, I wanted sweetened tea, but mine wasn’t, so I had to add my own sugar.

“Mary Jane”,

All new restaurants are“busy”until people who might be interested try it and find out it blows.

Kim went there while I was on vacation last week and said it wasn’t good nor was it bad. It was just“blah”. I will have her write something more specific but she said it was way overpriced and nothing stood out as great that would make her want to go back.

Why the hell put a chicken resaurant with no extensive menu, right next to a nationally known restaurant like KFC? STUPID! KFC has Chicken Fingers, the only difference is that Canes has a special sauce, will it be enouph to keep them operating? Time will tell.

ok…first of all.. i work there..
it is not a piece of shit. for the last two or three months we have been open we have been more busy than any of the restaurants around there. not only with new customers..but with the same people over and over again…saying they love our food.. and we are much much cleaner than any other fast food restaurant in the metro area!!! and as for building it right next to kfc?? well the only cars in the kfc parking lot, are the cars of our customers..that have to walk over to canes..because the other parking spots are taken. so the next time you want to call raising canes a piece of shit, take a drive by, go in there and talk to some of our customers, maybe then you will change your opinion.
thank you fro your time.

You aren’t *that* busy, I drive by there all the time. Just because you have a tiny parking lot for the size of the business does not make it“busy”. Rascal’s Apple Valley Bar and Grill has a tiny parking lot that requires people to park on the street and they have plenty of seating inside.

The fact that we have contacted Raising Cane’s and found out from an internal staff member (name is available but I will not post it publicly—you may ask via e-mail if you provide me with valid contact information) that they haven’t had their food tested for trans fats (literal translation: they do contain them) and while they wouldn’t directly admit to not using MSG they did say“almost every food you eat has MSG”which just isn’t true. MSG is an unnecessary food additive that may have severe reactions in some people.

My wife has already visited your location and even though she has absolutely no issue with chicken fingers (before she met me that was one of her staples) she said the boring selection (echoed by this hysterical comment) was incredibly awful and that the lack of choices in sauce (one!) is a joke.

Thanks for openly admitting that you are an employee and not attempting to astroturf. It’s appreciated.

Addendum to the post above. Reading back over my notes, we were warned by the Raising Cane’s rep that if you have reactions to MSG, they suggest that you not eat at Raising Cane’s.

Just thought you’d like to know that; Ranch is just Mayo with a spice packet added and Honey Mustard is really just mayo and mustard. Most of the other suaces you talk about a mostly made up of mayo or ketchup. But mayo and ketchup togeather?!?! that’s just gross

Uhh…Well, yeah, when you get down to it I guess:

Ranch is mayo and spices but certainly more than what you allude to (buttermilk, sugar, garlic, dill, parsley, onion, salt, and paprika off the top of my head).

Honey mustard is, at a minimum: mayo, mustard, sugar, and honey. Obviously everyone has their own additional items that they throw in.

Raising Cane’s sauce is mayo, ketchup, salt, and pepper. Couldn’t they have worked it up a little more? Hell, a simple BBQ sauce would have been nicer and they could have started with the same base.

While I understand the lack of enthusiasm towards the sauce I would extend an invitation to sample the homemade honey mustard they have. Canes is a well known brand with over 60 stores located in 13 states. this is not a mom and pop operation. The company was built on one thing…chicken fingers. While you may not have a taste for that I would tell you that the vast majority of the customers in the south return to the stores for the immaculate appearance of the restaurants, smiling and friendly crew and cool culture that the restaurant has. Canes is more in line with a place like starbucks where people can come to be joyful and enjoy good music and hang out for a while with friends. I would encourage anyone to stop by just for a test run…remember food should be and experience, at least that what they say in the south!

Wow. Are all people from MN as shallow as you? Let’s hope not…You must have been picked on as a child to be so melancholy.

Anyway, Cane’s is quite impressive for a 10-year-old company to boast 50+ restaurants with a positive growth trend every single year. Besides, I will put money on the fact that you will find no other place that is as clean, friendly and culture-rich as Cane’s.

One Love.

I’ve never been to a Cane’s, but I find the concept interesting. I like the idea of a restaurant that specializes in one thing and does it good.

I truly believe Noodle&amp;Co. has a good pasta dish, and Chipotle’s probably has a heck of a buritto. Likewise, it makes sense that Cane’s, probably has a very good box of chicken tenders…It’s all they do!

Most fast food joints that offer“variety”are just awful. McDonald’s, Jack in the Box, etc. They have everything for everybody–a real catalog of offerings. Problem is, it all sucks.

From the comments I’ve read, I’ve concluded that I’d like to try Cane’s chicken and I wished they had a few more sauce choices.

Thanks for checking into the MSG&amp;Trans Fat, Bill. I’m surprised Cane’s responded to you at all, they don’t even have a nutrition guide (I’ve requested it more than once and there is nothing online). And FWIW, it sounds like a few of these Cane’s“defenders”are from Cane’s, especially this yatz:

If that’s not a corporate mouthpiece, I don’t know what is. The fact of the matter is, Cane’s will never have ambiance or atmosphere like Starbucks so that comparison is asinine. It’s fried freaking chicken fingers! Trans fat fried, MSG breaded and marinated chicken fingers at that! And, NEWSFLASH!, Starbucks has VARIETY! :0 4 combos does not a great place to eat or“experience”make. One sauce, crummy lemonade, loud music, tooth rotting“sweet tea,”etc. Yes, the dog with the sunglasses is cute but cool CULTURE?

It’s clean, I’ll give it that. But, a polished turd is still made of…you get the idea.

I pulled into the place thinking“great, I love fried chicken! A new chicken place.”I was immediately alarmed when I saw the menu but was too embarressed for them to turn around and leave.“I don’t like chicken fingers, but how bad can it be?”I thought.

It was that bad.

Soggy, unidentifiable chicken pieces, limp, lukewarm fries, throwaway toast and the“special sauce”…jeez I won’t even go there. Yuck. Don’t let these people fool you, this is not the“taste of Louisiana”or whatever.

Any chicken restaurant that doesn’t even have hot sauce by request is a freaking joke. I’ll keep driving to Minneapolis for Popeyes I guess. WHY COULDN’T IT HAVE BEEN POPEYES!!???

Raising Cane’s is a great fast food place in my opinion. They are different from“KFC”and“Wild Wings”. Go the site and read the history. They are“fresh”not frozen chicken which makes a big difference when it comes to taste. They have“four”items on the menu because they are focused on providing the best not variety! Because they servce FRESH never frozen their cost is more than those other fast food chains. I love the menu because it is simple…you want chicken fingers go to Cane’s. Simple. The only thing I wish they did have was dessert. Cookie or Brownies would be simple….but then again I dont need those anyway. So there is my input on the matter.

I am in complete agreement with Bill on this topic. Unfortunately, I’ve tried Raising Cane’s and it’s mediocre at best. Mark my words, it won’t last long. Just because it has succeeded in the South, doesn’t mean it will automatically be a smashing success here in Minnesota. Minnesotans are more educated and tend to lead healthier lifestyles than to eat daily at a chicken fingers establishment. Unless everyone from Louisiana and New Orleans plans on moving to Apple Valley within the next year or so, good luck. Let’s face it, southerners are the only ones dumb enough to think chicken fingers are fine dining. They are really the only people I ever hear raving about and defending the place. Keep in mind that people from the east coast thought Krispie Kreme was going to be a smashing success in Apple Valley and look what just happened? It closed, which I’ve been saying would happen since the day it opened! Nobody in this state is stupid enough to drive completely out of their way to eat artery clogging food each and every day. Healthier eating is the wave of the future and for all you morons that think otherwise I guarantee time will tell that I’m correct on Kane’s. Don’t get me wrong, I very much enjoy fried chicken, but it isn’t the type of food that you’d want to be basing a restaurant on given all the dining competition in AV. Once we weed out all the people who go to Canes to try it once or twice, mark my words that place will be extremely slow and dead. I personally wish TCF Bank would have moved into that location, tore it down, and built a brand new branch right there on the corner and got out of that old strip mall they are currently in that’s a block away.

I grew up on KK and it’s just not the same eating it in a clean, brand-spanking new, and strip mall building in Apple Valley. Eating 24 of them, fresh off the line, in a hole in the wall place with a huge cup of coffee in a stained cup while most of the patrons smoked Camel unfiltered, was the way to go.

The clean, shiny, new places that they put up all around here (while inundating you with them in gas stations, office parties, and seemingly everywhere else) just made them boring and like any other donut shop out there.

Thanks for the comment Steve and thanks for reminding me of KK ;)

Don’t get me wrong, I never hated Krispy Kremes’product but I’ll admit that I’m somewhat biased toward Dunkin’Donuts due to the fact that I grew up on Dunkin’Donuts and liked their donut selection a lot better than KK’s. Although neither Dunkin’Donuts nor KK would have survived the Apple Valley market, Dunkin’Donuts probably had a slightly better chance due to the fact that it is more well known in the Midwest and has a loyal following. Plus it has always had much better coffee than KK could ever dream of having. To change the subject, the chicken strips basket at Dairy Queen is as good or better than the chicken fingers at Raising Cane’s. That doesn’t say much for Cane’s considering chicken is their focus. Some of you fried chicken obsessed southerners should try DQ’s chicken strips basket and maybe you’ll shut your mouths about how special Cane’s is. Hell, the fried chicken you can buy hot at Cub Foods is just as good as Raising Cane’s chicken fingers.

“Let’s face it, southerners are the only ones dumb enough to think chicken fingers are fine dining.”-Steve

Itâ€™s one thing to say that you donâ€™t like something but a completely different thing to insult an entire group of people in the process. I grew up in southern Louisiana and I can assure I do not think chicken fingers are fine dining. I know that none of the people I grew up with would confuse chicken fingers with fine dining. There is no need for personal attacks against any one group of people here. You donâ€™t like Canes and that is your prerogative but please donâ€™t confuse the enjoyment of southern style junk food with diminished intelligence on the part of the people who enjoy it.
I will go on record here again with the fact that Iâ€™ve been to Caneâ€™s and found it meh. Not really my thing. But not because Iâ€™m so much more health conscious or smarter than anyone else I simply didnâ€™t like it.

Donuts and MN seem to be a bad mix. Minnesotans eat less donuts per capita than anyone else in the country. Even the people in California eat more donuts per capita than we do. Shocking I know ;). Dunkinâ€™ Donuts did have a few stores here at one time. The last one I know about was north of the cities and I think itâ€™s closed. Minnesotans like bagels. Huge, bread-y, high calorie cream cheese delivery systems. :&gt; Are they healthier than donuts? No! Bur we like them better.

Itâ€™s all about personal choice. Are some choices better for us and healthier than others? Of course. Does my making choices that are different than yours make me stupid? I donâ€™t think so. To each their own.

Random thoughts:

Judging from the number of people loading up on donuts for their office mates at Byerly’s every time I’m there, I would argue that a reopened Dunkin Donuts would do just fine in the south metro (Eagan and Burnsville specifically).

If you grew up on Dunkin Donuts and want to replicate that experience (the donuts, not the coffee), head up to South Robert Street in West St. Paul (1555 Robert St S.) and stop in Granny Donuts. Really great people and outstanding donuts. Absolute must if you like apple fritters.

Tearitup, it’s funny you mention bagels—the bagels in Minnesota just flat out suck because there’s no place to get good, real food to put on a bagel (i.e. smoked/cured fishes, good cream cheese, etc.) And eating a bagel in the Twin Cities just isn’t the same as eating a bagel in NYC.

Steve, your thoughts echo some that I posted on chowhound.com last Wednesday, including the Krispy Kreme analogy although I had no idea the AV KK has closed. Here’s a link to the discussion: http://www.chowhound.com/topics/342761 

Since those with a stake in the AV Raising Cane’s seem to be loyal readers here (or do they just post and not read?) I would like to send them a closed-circuit comment: Get on the phone with HQ and ask/beg them to dust off their southern food cookbooks and test market some southern cookin’here at the AV location. I have absolutely nowhere around home to satisfy my craving for a basket of catfish, fried okra and grits. I’d have to drive all over MSP to assemble that meal. I won’t go back to Raising Cane’s as it is now, but I would probably go there once a month if they offered some southern foods, even if they are as mediocre as their current stuff.

Heck, there’s even a chain down Florida/Alabama way that they can go to and steal the menu (called Po Folks).

MSPD is correct. Minneapolis doesn’t have bagels. We have baked dough cooked in round shapes with a hole in the middle. The Sunday tradition in my home was to go to the bagel shop down the street and get the fresh bagels that had been shipped in from NYC that morning. If you weren’t there by 6:30 AM it was pointless, they weren’t fresh enough after that.

Bagels aren’t subjective. They’re bagels. People who think that the bagels we have here in Minnesota are acceptable are either crazy, been out of touch with real bagels for too long, or are like many people here and have no taste-buds in the first place.

I am worried that at some point I too will forget what a Philly cheesesteak , a NYC bagel, or a dirty water hot dog with red onions, sauerkraut, and spicy brown mustard are like.

Bill, I feel the same way about pizza strips, Del’s frozen Lemonade and New York system wieners. I guess that’s why regional food is just that, regional. Some things just can’t be commodified and maybe bagels fall in that category. I agree that a real NY bagel with cream cheese and lox is wonderful. I also know that if I want one chances are I won’t find it here and that’s ok. Wanting to experience the foods of an area or a particular city are a great reason to travel.

Well…a bit off topic but as long as we’re straying into east coast nostalgia…there are just some things that can’t be duplicated no matter how hard you try. Bill, I’m with you on the Philly cheesesteak but how about the soft pretzel??? Can you imagine the reaction you’d get from motorists stopped at a red light at Cedar Ave and County 42 if you tapped on their windows and offered up a beautiful, steaming hot pretzel torn from a row of six? (Not to mention you’d be thrown in the Dakota County clink). Oh man.

And forget about bagels…how about a bialy? Or knishes?

Or a deli case with sable, butterfish, whitefish, sturgeon, a dozen varieties of lox, fish spreads, half dozen pickled herrings (creamed, no cream), fresh horseradish, chopped livers, gefilte fish and cream cheeses? NOW you have something to put on your bagel.

Or a decent stromboli? My first REAL stromboli experience was visiting a friend in NE Philly about 15 years ago. I was hungry from traveling so I ordered a cheesesteak and a stromboli. When the guy showed up with a 24 x 24 inch pizza box, I thought he screwed up my order until I learned that a single Philly stromboli can feed a family of six (well, small exaggeration).

And why can’t all of these people who insist on putting“NY Style Corned Beef or Pastrami”on their menus figure out that NY style corned beef and pastrami are kept in giant slabs in a steamer beneath the cutting board until you order it? And HAND cut, because NY style meat is served too thick for a machine to cut. It should NEVER touch a machine slicer (are you listening Pastrami Jack’s?) or a griddle (are you listening Cecils deli in St. Paul?)! Take slab, cut 1/4 inch thick by hand, dump onto fresh Jewish rye slathered in bright yellow deli mustard and serve with a pickle and Dr. Brown’s.

I don’t even want to start with downtown food carts.

They might be. They are the closest thing I can find around here to authentic IMHO. I also love their service (except take out, they always manage to screw something up with my order).

One of my favorite thing growing up was a soft pretzel at the mall. Not the“soft”pretzels we have here…We didn’t have a lot of money but I could always get one of those out of my parents. Nothing can compare.

Thanks for making me long even more for the Coast. I miss the seafood, great ethnic foods, and real restaurants. Everytime I return I am always shocked how many privately owned restaurants there are compared to here :(

A year ago I would have told you to go to The Lone Doughnut Cafe in the skyway above Kieran’s for a good donut. Really interesting and out of the box ingredients. It was always a huge hit in the office when I’d bring them in. Breakfast pizza was always a huge hit too, we went through a breakfast pizza slump downtown for about 2 years until just a couple weeks ago when I heard through the grapevine about another place that makes a good one and delivers.

I too work for raising canes so i will just throw that on the table right away…yes people consider us fast food…but the i can tell you as an employee that i like almost everything on the menu. Bill, if you would ever take time in your“busy”life to stop in at raising canes in apple valley you would find that we offer our canes sauce as well as our home made HONEY MUSTARD sauce. Our coleslaw is not packaged we make that too. All the drinks except for the fountain drinks are made at canes too (sweet tea…un-sweet tea and lemonade). I don’t know where people get off saying all we have is cane’s sauce. I’m not saying cane’s is the only way to go…yes i like other sauce options such as the flavors BDUBS has and even KFC, but what i am talking about is our chicken fingers. If you put any sauce on them from BDUBS or KFC im sure you will find that our chicken is superior to the other places. Okay if you dont like our canes sauce don’t rip on it just an opinion come in and try our chicken we don’t care if you bring BBQ or ranch or what ever from home. Our stuff is never frozen. Regaurding soggy fries…its fast food it happens everywhere…even sit down restaurants have soggy fries undercooked burgers whatever. I agree with you that there is a limited menu and people at work are always talking about new ideas and bringing it up with our store owners…Another thing our store managers are very honest why dont you just call in and ask then if we use MSG or what ever i have no clue if we do or not…but if you ask im sure your opinions will either become varified facts or just not true at all…I myself dont like the coleslaw at canes but the texas toast is wonderful. Seems like you don’t like fast food but yet you will eat chicken wings on occasion Bill…so why not give Cane’s a try…it really isn’t that bad

You don’t have to disregard everyone who raves about (or works at) the restaurant as a“Raising Cane’s troll.”I’ve read about as much of this as I can take. This is immature, to say the least.

Ok how are you people judging this place without EVER being there. First thing i love chicken fingers. Second thing i love yellow labs(had one died less then a year ago). So pairing the two things together was like ZOMG.

It is a great place. VERY CLEAN. Its a clean join unlike every other drive through place I’ve been to. The evironment is fun.

Now the food, best chicken fingers that are ALWAYS hot, and fresh. Fries are pretty good not to salty either. Coleslaw pretty good to. The sauce is what i like to call awesome sauce. SO good. The breading on the chicken is really good, not that crap they do at applebees or where else. If you want hot buffelo wings go to wild wing place, if you want gross fried chicken go to KFC. If want the greatest chicken fingers go to cain’s. Everything is amazing there. Would eat there everyday if I lived closer.

If any of you people say oh its so unhealthy, you must be a fatf^ck that worries about their weight. Im skinny I dont care. I’ll eat what i want. The place is amazing just a bunch of kfc or buffalo wings people here. No other drive through place can touch it.

First thing, you need to work on your capitalization. Second, you need to work on proper use of“to”and“too”. Third, even if you’re“skinny”and not a“fatf^ck”you need to worry about the contents of what you put into your body.

Finally, you must have come home from the bar, logged onto the Internet at 2:30 and posted some trash to a random website. Don’t drink and post, seriously.

Yes, you’re absolutely correct. A restaurant that has a menu of four items (all which include fried chicken fingers) beats Rudy’s Redeye Grill in Rosemount hands down.

Boy, you should start your own website and call it“Drunken and Misspelled Reviews from a Fucking Douche.”I’d read it for sure!

Northerners really need more hobbies–do you really spend time worrying about this stuff? Just go eat some damn chicken and shut up. And if you don’t like Cane’s, don’t go there. Simple as that! Y’all need to visit Louisiana and learn some southern hospitality. Obviously some of you weren’t raised right. I was undecided as to whether I wanted Raising Caneâ€™s today or not–- thanks for helping make my decision. Iâ€™m going to support my Louisiana â€œchainâ€ restaurant today and enjoy some chicken. Damnit.

I find it extremely distressing that Andrew Zimmern finds Raising Cane’s an acceptable eatery . I have followed a lot of his stuff for quite some time but the statement that Raising Cane’s“serves some killer chicken fingers,”and that he’s glad they are opening yet another location (this time in Stadium Village ) because his drive out to Apple Valley was“getting tiring,”just made me seriously think twice before taking under serious consideration any restaurant he reviews.

Andrew, you have proven that your tastes are truly awful and you have now earned removal from my RSS reader. Congrats!

Yeah, I’ve seen and heard him praise the place more than once. In the past it was more focused on the sauce (which I find laughable). While I obviously share your mystification on the appeal of Raising Cane’s, it doesn’t really form (or kill) my opinion of the guy or undermine my trust in his taste. Most people I know, even those with vast culinary credentials and people like myself who, while not as“credentialed”, have experienced a LOT of food from some of the finest restaurants in the U.S. to the crappiest of crap holes, have some inexplicable vices.

I would never say“they make a killer burger”but I’m the first to admit I love an occasional Wendy’s triple with cheese, McDonalds double quarter pounder with cheese or even an 8-pack of sliders from White Castle. There’s something about low grade, institutionalized, fat-and-grease-infested food that just sometimes calls my name. It’s the same reason why every time I pass through Des Moines, I stop at the Flying J Truck Stop on the west side of the city for a bag of gizzards and the world’s largest bagel dog (it’s really obscene to be honest with you).

That said, while I excuse the fact that he enjoys a vice like I do and many people I know do, it is a bit uncomfortably incongruent to hear him celebrate the proliferation of the chain. Personally, I’m not so happy if another White Castle, McD’s, Wendy’s or Flying J shows up.

Haha this post is so much fun. Couldn’t resist. I would never step foot into that dump whole that is Raising Canes unless I wanted to speed up my road to having a heart attach in my early 20′s ;).
I don’t understand how that place is staying in business with a KFC, Boston Market, and BWW surrounding it.

Ugh.

Meanwhile..being from the East Coast…I saw the threads from earlier…and I too miss so much of the east coast food. I’ve heard the reason that NY’s bagels are so good is seriously the water. Everytime I’m back home I always go straight for the bagels and pizza.

I will say though, living here a short time..and although I’m nota big fan of large chains–I really would love to bring back dunkin donuts…I grew up on it. If it didn’t do well here before, it wasn’t being marketed correctly. So you say Minnesota isn’t a fan of donuts? Well…the thing I’m a fan of with dunkin donuts is extremly cheap yet really good coffee. (Oh and by the way my very first job at the age of 16 was Starbucks…yet I’m still endorsing D&amp;D)

Anywho..if Apple Valley’s gonna keep opening more and more chains..maybe they need to do a good market study first..and see what the residents actually want.

Emily,

Yeah, Dunkin Donuts is all over the East Coast and it’s kinda surprising how few we have here—oh well. If you want cheap and decent coffee, get it from SuperAmerica.

As far as the market studies go—people in Apple Valley want what’s fed to them (which happens to be chain restaurants). It’s really unfortunate that someone hasn’t come into town with something really different and spectacular. Rascal’s is so successful because they might as well be Applebee’s (menu wise) :(

It’s a chicken finger fast food joint. If you don’t like chicken fingers, why would you go eat there?
Cane’s is more of a regional than national chain, as it is still relatively small and incomparable to places like Popeye’s…another Louisiana chicken chain.
If you don’t like it, don’t go, but your blog only fuels the business.

For someone searching for nutritional information, like so many others, I’m 100% sure it doesn’t fuel their business.

Amen on Rascals.. I’ve never figured out the appeal of eating shitty chain-like-food in bombshelter atmosphere. Occasionally I like seeing my decrepit neighbor in there hitting on women half his age, that’s worth the price of an ice tea.

“It’s a chicken finger fast food joint. If you don’t like chicken fingers, why would you go eat there?

This is missing the point.

Simply put, businesses can add to the uniqueness and quality of life of a community or they can add fuel to its cultural downward spiral.

The entrepreneurs that spend a ton of money to become a franchisee of a national chain that sucks could just as easily spend that money on a restaurant or cafe that serves food, but also enhances the identity of the community by providing something unique. It’s their right, and a wise decision, to engage in whatever venture they think will be most profitable, but profit comes in many forms.

I take every opportunity possible to applaud the likes of the owners of Luxury Sweets for risking their capital to open an independent gelato shop instead of becoming the next proprietors of a Coldstone Creamery or Dairy Queen. Apple Valley needs to recognize the value of that kind of business. The community is richer for it and I hope we return the favor.

While I’m not always in lock step with his opinions, I also applaud Bill for encouraging people to not accept averageness and ubiquity (not to mention misguided local government priorities) just because we live in a suburb.

MSPD,

Thanks for another insightful comment. While I don’t expect anyone to always agree with what I have to say, I do hope that someone starts to think a little differently about the way things are working wherever they live.

Bill,

I am curious as to the origin of your hatred for establishments such as Raising Cane’s. Did you mother not love you enough when you were a child? Seriously though, I hope that by now you have had the opportunity to visit the Cane’s in your area. I am quite certain you can dig into your couch cushions and come up with enough loose change to cover the cost of a three finger combo.
It’s kind of pathetic to you talk such crap about the place but have never given it a chance. I would also love to know where you get your information about MSG’s used at the establishment.

Jason,

I haven’t eaten at any fast food restaurant since August and thankfully, partially because of that choice, I am now 80 lbs lighter. After 7+ months without eating food like Raising Cane’s I don’t see why I would go back now.

We spoke with a representative of Raising Cane’s via phone and they were kind enough to provide us with the information about MSG. I have the name of the individual we spoke with and I will be happy to discuss the issue at length, via e-mail, if you really want to know the specifics that I am not comfortable sharing here.

Jason, my kids eat a Canes about once a month (all I would allow) and I can, from direct experience attest to the fact that it is A) really expensive for what you get and B) when you get it.. it’s awful stuff. The chicken is way to salty and the batter isn’t all that crispy, which is why I would eat fried chicken to being with. The fries are soggy every time we get them. On the plus..the ice tea is pretty good. There are much better options for fast food. I would put canes somewhere below Taco Bell.

I am from Louisiana. the young man who owns Rasin Canes is a hard worker who did not give up on a dream. You do not have as many Canes around because the food is bad.

I visited Minnisota and you might want to give this spicy flavorful new chicken a chance. Your food is quite different from down South but give it a try.
