I was recently contacted by the folks behind Cruzers to come give their signature burger a try. I appreciate the request, not only does it mean that more people are perhaps starting to read this blog, but maybe that some restaurant owners and chefs actually value my opinion. Well that&apos;s wishful thinking at least. Either way I ventured there the other day for lunch to give it a shot. Both the Yelp and Urbanspoon reviews were very mixed so I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect. Long story short, it wasn&apos;t so bad.

Cruzers is located way out in Henderson on Boulder Hwy so it&apos;s definitely not in a convenient central location to most folks in the Valley, especially some of my out of town readers that are looking for places to try while visiting. The area definitely has an older feel to it, one that I&apos;m not too familiar with these days as I rarely venture this far out of town. The restaurant has been set up in an old school fast food formatted building, I&apos;m not sure what was there before but if you told me A&amp;W, Sonic, or any of that variety I wouldn&apos;t be surprised. The interior could use a little bit of work, but it&apos;s very clean so that&apos;s really just a matter of taste. Also from what I was reading online and what I experienced with the guy in front of me, they seem to occasionally have some credit card machine issues, but mine went through instantly.

The menu is pretty slim and straightforward; some salads and sandwiches such as pastrami, chicken breast, cheesesteaks, etc. I&apos;ve read many good things about the grilled chicken breast online so I might have to make it back at some point to try it. The star of the show is their burger, which is made from 100% certified Angus beef ground daily on site and made into patties each morning. They offer their hamburger with lettuce, tomato, onion and sauce at a small or regular size, or the signature PCH burger which comes on a fresh roll and includes any 2 extras such as cheese, bacon, chili, mushrooms, pastrami and a fried egg. Also something to note was the sign I read in the seating area about their fries; they are made from scratch every day, partially peeled and cooked to order so they are very fresh each time.

Because it&apos;s one of my go-to burgers I went with the PCH burger with mushroom and Swiss. The food took a few minutes to come out which is totally fine since they are making it to order. Upon arrival I was instantly impressed with the overall look of everything as it didn&apos;t look like your typical fast food meal. It was also brought out to my table by the chef herself which definitely added to the locally owned feel of the place. The burger has two thin patties, but they weren&apos;t dry at all. The meat had great flavor, and quite a bit of seasoning which I liked. The bun was really fresh and good, and well-proportioned to the meat. My mushrooms had good flavor, although I was longing for a few more than I got and there was a bit more grease than I would have anticipated. The mayo, onions and tomato were all good, although the tomato had a bit of green in it. I&apos;m sounding a bit nitpicky, as I&apos;m here to be, but overall this was a really good burger.

The fries were really good too, fresh as claimed, crispy, flavorful, and a million times better than Five Guys&apos; greasy overrated offerings. They were cooked perfectly and consistent all the way through the pile which is often surprisingly hard for some places to do. Combine all this with a very reasonable price of $7.95 for my meal and you have a really good deal. Just a few dollars more than In-N-Out, several less than Five Guys, but arguably better quality than both.

You can tell that the folks behind the counter really pay attention to each meal prepared, just as expected from a much fancier place. A few times during my meal the chef and gentleman behind the counter came out to speak with everyone dining there and check on their food. Between the pace of ordering as well as preparation of the food the experience could potentially sway from friendly and attentive to slow and aggravating as you can read in the many reviews already written on Yelp and Urbanspoon. I appreciate what these guys are doing and encourage you to support a local spot such as this. They may have some kinks to work out, and could really use an interior designer&apos;s touch on the dining area, but if you are anywhere near the Henderson area you should give these guys a shot.

We had been to Cruzer&apos;s a couple of times and were not super impressed.  The staff was very friendly and the place was clean, but the food was just average at best.

I went back yesterday for lunch.  They had an item of which I was not aware earlier, the spicy chicken sandwich.  This is a large chicken breast that has thin breading on it.  It was excellent.  Perfectly cooked and juicy.  Clearly fresh.  I got chili cheese fries, which were also good.  This food is clearly prepared by people, it&apos;s definitely not uniform l ike a fast food restaurant.  But, I like that.  They also had new fries since the last time I was here, and I like these fries a lot more.  If I had been on yelp the first time I went, I would have only given this place 2 stars.  But, I was very impressed with the improvement and will return.

The staff is very friendly, but not overbearing.  Eager to help, but leave you alone to eat as well.

I&apos;m a bit surprised on the past reviews of this place, because of the past yelpers only had only a few reviews behind them, and I had to see this for myself

Cruzers is located between Discount tires, and the Omelet house on Boulder Highway; just north of Lake Mead Parkway in Henderson.    So it&apos;s pretty easy to find if you&apos;re in the area.

When I walked in, the place was pretty clean, and the menu was pretty straight forward.    Burgers, Sandwiches, a few salads, Milk shakes, some kind of orange smoothies drink, home made fries, and a few other items.

They pride themselves on using certified Angus Beef that is grind on a daily basis, and I won&apos;t disagree with that statement, because it tasted quite like Create burger; Also t I notice they listen to one our reviews due to the salt and pepper that was shaken while it was being fried.

Going back to the start of my order,  the gentleman who  nicely asked me how I wanted my burger got me a little confused, because I wasn&apos;t to sure on what he&apos;s asking at first, so I asked him if it was how I wanted made or what I wanted on top of it?    My guess it was because of Southern Nevada Health district rules on cooking hamburger, and their office is just up the street from this business.   I just told them, just do it medium well, because I wanted to see what it tasted like, then I selected their signature PCH burger; which consisted of the usual suspects, and two picks of the extras...which I picked out Pastrami, and mushrooms.

My order didn&apos;t take too long, and I was quite surprised when I got it, because it was very juicey, and had a lot of taste to the burger.    The fries are freshly cut, and cut very thin....there very good, but I didn&apos;t notice much of difference between my friends small order and my large order of fries.    I was very happy that they had Coke Zero in their fountain!

For those in Uniform,   Police, Firefighter, and even the Military, they have a great special for you.   If you come in dressed in your uniform, you will receive a free cup of coffee, and if you order a hamburger , you will automatically get upgraded to a combo meal.      Talk about having your benefits!   Henderson police,  fire department, Nellis, and our National guards...take advantage of this offer.

Styled to look like a chain fast food, Cruzers is actually just a singular store out in the greater Las Vegas area. Started by a fellow and his daughter who&apos;d just finished culinary school, it was apparently an acceptable compromise between fancy high cuisine as she&apos;d learned, and roadside stand fare as he liked.

To that end, Cruzers focuses on providing the freshest ingredients as they possibly can - grinding angus sirloin daily for the burgers, clearing the fries out regularly so they don&apos;t sit idle under a warmer, that sort of thing. It seems like that insistence pays off, too, because the food is pretty good.

Burgers are pretty good - albeit kind of small - but they are just like what you&apos;d make at home, served piping hot and juicy. You can load them up with several toppings, but that menu might be a bit overpriced. The fries aren&apos;t bad, most come off as a little soft, but that&apos;s my preference - your mileage may vary.

I&apos;m pretty good with the service, I don&apos;t mind things taking a bit longer when the food is cooked to order, instead of hanging out in steam trays all afternoon. And in-uniform service members (police, fire, military) always get free coffee and free combo upgrades, which while I can&apos;t personally take advantage of, it&apos;s a nice gesture to the community.

Ultimately, it&apos;s very clear that Cruzers is a small business, family project. They don&apos;t have the budget for all the bells and whistles and it shows. Things are still pretty new and they are working to get their feet under themselves. However, I think the things they do, they do it well, and while there&apos;s lots of room for improvement, they are off to a good start!

I decided to check this place out after reading the reviews. Brought my wife and daughter for lunch. We all got the regular burger combo meal. It came with the usual lettuce, tomatoes and thousand island type dressing. My wife had mentioned that the bun was really food. It tasted like they had made it there. Very fresh tasting just like the Patty and the fries. I liked the fact the burger wasn&apos;t all greasy like at say in &apos;n out burgers. We also liked how clean the place is. You can&apos;t beat a good burger, fries and drink for 5 bucks. They also have great prices on breakfast stuff. We&apos;ll definitely be coming back. One more thing, the guy working the counter was nice also. He even came over later to ask how we we&apos;re doing. That goes a long way with me.

Admittedly not a big burger fan so I opted for their #1 which is a 6 ounce with lettuce tomato and onion. Acer ordered the BBQ Angus, looked like about an 8 ounce patty.  We ordered fries and zuchini sticks on the side.  We arrived earlier than burger time so the staff informed us there would be a wait while the oil heated up for the fries.  No problem.

While we waited we noticed what looked like about 10 pounds of fresh beef being cubed and ground for customers later in the day.  No doubt about their claim to fresh Angus beef ground on site.

The burgers arrived on schedule, with an apology and a smile from our order taker.  Friendly people.  The burger was pretty good with a light mayo type of sauce.  They could possibly switch to a different onion, or cook them a bit as that was the dominant taste until I took about half of them out.  The burger bun was a little to bunny for me, I like them thinner, but it was fresh.  The fries piping hot and crispy. The zucher sticks came in a variety of sizes and were lightly seasoned.  Maybe more parmesean next time?  Offer parmesean as a condiment?  They were pretty good though.

The condiments available on our side of the counter were limited to ketchup and mustard.

The menu has some breakfast items as well as some sandwiches.  Pastrami caught my eye.  Apparently they also rotate their special burgers.  A previous reviewer yelped about the Hawaiian but was not on the menu today.  Still there is a variety of stuff to choose from.

How about a signature sauce?  Or adding a crazy good corn dog or chili dog to the menu?  I could sooooo seee a chillidog in a hot dog version of their hamburger bun.

Our total order including a small soda and an Orange Ceaser was under $15 so pretty good deal for the money.

As the staff and establishment matures to find their niche I can see this place being more well received as they are obviously trying to please. Our visit today was borderline between three and four but what I found lacking was something on the menu that sez &quot;Come back for me&quot;.

I will still be back though, I&apos;d like to see how they come along.

A co-worker and I tried to come here when they first opened - before they were set up to take cards and could only accept cash. We didn&apos;t have cash the first time, so we ate somewhere else. We were addressed politely and saw potential in the establishment (and needed variety in our work day lunches), so we decided to try again another time.

Today was our &quot;another time&quot;. We were there around 12:30PM, just after. We entered at the same time as another patron, and a couple of people had just finished ordering as we walked in.

There were 3 or 4 people working at this time. It was apparent that the cashier was pulling double duty as a cook, as his shirt was very grease stained and a little sloppy. He was also working the drive thru. This I found out, while I was attempting to place my order.

We arrived, browsed the menu while waiting for the customer before us to finish. My co-worker ordered with no issues. Her card had to be run twice because &quot;the machine doesn&apos;t like cards, always have to run them more than once&quot;. The young man at the counter then greeted me and appeared ready to take my order. As I began to order, however, he placed one hand on the button to his headset and another hand in the air extended in front of him giving me the &quot;just one second&quot; signal while walking away.... really?!?

I placed my order, we got our food relatively quickly. While waiting for our food we got our drinks - their ice machine is very slow, don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not broken... then I went to get some ketchup. There was a large puddle of soda on the ground, with traces of people having walked through it (so it wasn&apos;t a fresh spill). No signs of anyone coming by to clean that up anytime soon. When I went to join my coworker at the table she picked out, I noticed a lot of food droppings under the table. I looked around and saw dirty tables as well.

We got our food - I ordered a regular burger with lettuce, onion, american cheese, bacon and grilled mushrooms. With all of those toppings, you would have expected amazing flavor. Nope. In fact, there was hardly any flavor at all. The onion was so thin it was transparent and might as well have not been there at all. The mushrooms had no taste to them. I ditched the bun for the last few bites to see if that would help, but it didn&apos;t improve much except I could finally taste the cheese.

The service (aside from the finger in the air) was pretty friendly, but the quality of the food and cleanliness of the lobby were definite turn-offs. Both my co-worker and I made the statement that we&apos;re not planning on returning... ever.

This place is good, but still needs help. The restaurant seems to be a family owned joint.

The food is fresh and good. The staff has been nice to me both times I&apos;ve been there. They are very friendly and explain everything thoroughly. The hours are bad... Close at 7pm on the weekdays and closed Sundays.

There is a lot of room for improvement. This place has a lot of potential. I hope they grow the business and are successful.

Ok let me start by saying I like trying new places and when my wife&amp;I saw this place on Boulders Hwy it looked like it was worth taking a shot on.

What a mistake that was.

When we pulled up in the drive-thru we were the only car there on 12/3/11. In total we waited over 25 mins to get our food and we had order two #2 regulars combo with fries&amp;drink. We figured &apos;hey if its taking longer it must be fresh, right?&apos; Wrong.

What we got looked, felt&amp;tasted like it had been reheated in a microwave from the night before&amp;the same thing with the fries, there was no WAY they had been made within the last couple of hours as they were rock hard, I&apos;ve had fries I put in the fridge the night before that tasted better the next morning.

To top off the 20 minutes wait in the drive-thru, they had not given us our drinks after they handed us our food then 5 minutes later when I banged on the drive-thru window the guy working the drive-thru looked at me like I was crazy for asking for the drinks I had paid for and never received.

When he tried to fill up the drinks and hand them too me with soda all over the outside and I had to ask him to wipe them off, &apos;I dont want soda all over my steering wheel while I&apos;m driving there guy&apos;. Probably would have helped if they had someone that didn&apos;t have his fingers wrapped up in tape from either being broken or sprained working the drive-thru. The kid could barely hold the drinks so obviously the manager in charge that day had thought that one through pretty clearly eh?

Bad service, bad food, bad attitude, probably from bad management. Really is too bad because it looks like it could be a great place to eat. I wont be visiting this place again&amp;I&apos;m going to recommend to other people I know&amp;don&apos;t know not to either

This place is terrible. The service was the worst I&apos;ve ever experienced, inside the place felt like a steam room at a rec center. The cook looked like he had just been paroled, the front counter person didn&apos;t know what she was doing. The manager was just as clueless as the order taker. So finally after I ordered my food and waited for 20 minutes I finally got my pancake, I mean hamburger. It seemed as though they tried to cram my food down with their palm to make it fit. I get the food out and I try the burger first, very tasteless and bland. It seems as though they hired out the rejects from in n out and tried making a burger joint. The experience was terrible. I suggest to stay far far away from here.

Great burger. I got a PCH burger with egg,chili,cheese,and bacon. Amazing. It&apos;s refreshing to have a fresh ground burger. The service was good. I had no problems. Wish they had a few more condiments out but with a full burger you don&apos;t really need it. Just watch out for the egg. When I took my first bite the egg yolk jumped out of the egg and on to my hand burning it. Overall great burger

If I could give zero stars, I would. We gave this place a chance after reading a write up in the Henderson Home News. Anxious to support locally owned businesses in our area we completely ignored previous poor reviews in hopes of finding a gold mine.
It was the day after Christmas and many local restaurants were closed so we called AND called their listed phone and only received voicemail. Nothing indicated that they were closed so we drive over there to find them open and empty, (a potentially ominous sign).  Turns out, as explained by the girl at the register, the staff isn&apos;t allowed to answer &quot;that&quot; phone.  Really???
We were greeted promptly.  The menu is extremely limited, but does boast freshly ground angus burgers, fries and shakes. There were six in our party. We ordered everything from a regular burger, cheeseburger, a couple of PCH&apos;s&amp;a pastrami sandwich on rye, along with several orders of &quot;fresh&quot; fries and a couple of shakes.
The food took forever, 30 minutes, which as indicated by the posted sign, should be expected, as everything is made FRESH. However, when our food did arrive it was clear immediately that it was NOT fresh. All of the burgers were a pale grey color, certainly NOT freshly ground or grilled. The fries appeared promising, but they too were a false rendition of fresh. They were cold and hard, just as another reviewer said, I&apos;ve had better come out of my fridge as leftovers. Two of our PCH burgers got messed up, sauce one the one that wasn&apos;t supposed to have it, Swiss instead of American, onions, missing bacon, the list goes on. When we brought this to the staff&apos;s attention she told us to switch buns and the problem would be miraculously   solved. Huh???
She eventually, begrudgingly agreed to remake only one of the burgers and not the other one. Odd.
While waiting another agonizing 20 minutes, the replacement burger arrived. Mediocre at best. At some point, we were told there was no rye bread for the pastrami sandwich. No big shakes it happens. The hoagie roll was fresh, but the pastrami was cold, dry and rubbery with an very generous slathering of mayo. The shakes were freshly made. There were two staff members on duty. The girl at the register was not very efficient as it was her first day, but the tried to be polite. The other kid operating the grill seemed to be more senior and he was polite, too. But no amount of apologies could make the food taste better.  I had really high hopes for this place, hopefully the ownership can turn things around.

Our first and ONLY trip to Cruzers was a total disaster!!!! My wife, daughter and I all order burgers, fries and drinks. When my wife orders, the lady asked he how she wanted it and my wife says well done. When I order, I ask for my burger medium. The lady trips out on me and tells me they only cook the burgers well. It made me laugh because she asked my wife how she wanted hers cooked. Oh well, we ventured on. With 3 burgers, 3 fries, 3 drinks and a side of chili the bill was over 30 bucks. I hand the lady my debit card and she tells me &quot;cash only&quot;. I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only. I told her I had no cash on me and I would need to go get some. She says &quot;sorry, next in line please&quot;. Well now I&apos;m pissed, and I tell her they needed a cash only sign. As we walk out another customer that had just finished his meal told the lady that they should start out with telling the customer about the cash only. She ignored him and started taking the next order. We will never attempt Cruzers again.

Okay, I went to this place and it was okay, the orders were prompt and correctly made. Good burgers  but nothing special. We had a to go order for my daughter and it was made wrong. My wife took it back and got a lecture for not having a receipt. The staff just saw her there a scant 10 minutes before. The counter girl had a bad attitude and said &quot;you better bring a receipt next time &quot;.  They made a mistake and gave us a lecture ?. There will be no next time. I will stick with five guys burgers and fries.
