Another good place to grub! I live by campus and Lucky Star is the first place I think of to grab a breakfast burrito in the morning and any time of the day or night.

I like their El pastor nachos too. They have thin or thick chips and hook it up with a lot of meat.

Lucky Star isn&apos;t just all mexican food! Price is affordable and you can get a 10% discount if you&apos;re a student.

it&apos;s 6:20a an there&apos;s some place else open for breakfast other than Mcdonalds? Sweet.

They have a huge menu, most of it Mexican flair, but for the most part all looking good.

Friendly service at such an early hour, i guess I could say, thank my - &quot;Lucky Star&quot; that this was here and open at such an early hour!

Enjoy, if you&apos;re ever down in this neck of the woods.

&quot;You must be my Lucky Star
&apos;Cause you feed me lunch wherever I want
I just go to you and get treated right
You excel in being a multi-cuisine restaurant
And baby you know you don&apos;t serve nothing lite&quot;

hmmm, I think I just punched myself in the gut of manhood for using Madonna lyrics to open a review, but what the hell, I&apos;m feeling creative.

Lucky Star is one of those places that almost every LA neighborhood has.  It&apos;s not entirely Mexican food, although staffed completely by Mexicans and serves the top choices, it&apos;s not American food, because of the aforementioned and it&apos;s not any of the other half dozen or so different types of cuisines listed on the menu. It&apos;s a catch-all spot to go for a Burger and Fries or a Greek Salad washed down with an Horchata!  Interestingly enough, they must buy paper cups and napkins from defunct/no longer in SoCal fast food chains, cause you might be lucky to get a Grand Junction Hamburger cup with napkins from Captain D&apos;s.

Not a bad choice if you&apos;re in the area. And you might even get to catch up on your favorite Tella Novella on one of their many T.V.&apos;s

I love this place...it gives me such warm and fuzzies. Such variety and everything I&apos;ve ordered or tried has just been..sigh...amazing. Stuck on what to get? Try and salad! They&apos;ve huge! Or try a pastrami burrito or grilled cheese or enchiladas or...I could go on for days but get the idea! And in case anyone&apos;s wondering...their catering services are excellent.

This is a pretty good place to get food, but a bit pricey. But they do give large size portions. Most of the times that I have been here it&apos;s been a bit crowded. But the food is good. I&apos;m not a seafood lover but my coworkers say their seafood is excellent. There salads are really good like the chicken strip salad is great. They have nice looking waitresses/reps. Check it out.

Ive gone here and had pancakes, french toast, and a breakfast burrito with bacon and sausage (which i can never finish). I love them all! They have a huge menu. I normally stop by on my way to work. I wouldnt mind trying a burger, but I cant&apos;t eat one that early in the morning lol.

Found this place by accident. It ended up being a really good accident. The food is good and reasonably priced. This is my go to spot when there is no food at home. From the burgers to the breakfast it&apos;s all good. My personal favorite is the breakfast burrito. A must have for early morning traffic.
