 The Best of NileGuide Sometimes you just need to eat and run. In Beijing, this is easy thanks to the myriad of fast food restaurants around the city. Everything from Italian to Japanese, from American to British-- you&apos;ll find a fast meal around the corner to please your tummy and get you back out seeing the sites as quickly as possible.
Fast food in Beijing is everywhere. You&apos;ll find the expected number of McDonald&apos;s restaurants on every major street corner as well as accompanying and surprisingly popular KFC restaurants around the city. These two staples of the fast food world are not in short supply in China&apos;s capital city.

For a more unique fast food experience, head to No More Bunz, a small shop near Sanlitun that specializes in quick food that is tasty, hearty and fast, fast, fast! A favorite in the summer for the short walk from the Village, you&apos;ll enjoy a bit of unique food on the go. Crazy Dogs, in Haidian, its the response to No More Bunz from the West side of Beijing, the student quarter.

Saizeriya is an Italian fast food restaurant where you can be in, order,eat and out in half an hour. The prices are cheap and you get more for your money at Saizeriya than most other restaurants in the entire city.

For Asian fast food, check out the Hot Bean Cooperative downtown, where you&apos;ll find fast and ready chicken wings that range from insanely hot to bordering on medically dangerously hot. You can also get honey flavored wings that wont burn off your tongue.

Quick fast food fish and chips are on order at Fish Nation, a staple among late night fast food eaters near Sanlitun. You&apos;ll find the small shack packed with Brits at all hours of the day and night proving that although they travel in large numbers the Brits never stray too far from their home cuisine.
