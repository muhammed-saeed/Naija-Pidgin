 From Kyoto to Tokyo! 
 By Jason, on July 8th, 2012 
How was Kyoto? Well, despite swearing to all that is holy that I would never return to that city so long as I breathe, I had a good time! It’s nothing personal , you see. It just takes very little for me to swear to never do something ever again.

So anyway, yep, had a good time! We only had about 9 hours, so we just went to a few temples that look kinda like this:
 
Tenryuji Temple
 
And shrines that looked like this:
 
Kurumazaki Shrine
 
And heard important explanations that I obviously wasn’t paying attention to from ex-students  who look like this:
 
Saki; my tour guide!
 
And went to forests made entirely of bamboo that look a lot like this:
 
The Bamboo Forest
 
I have to say, if you can only go to one place, I really am fond of the bamboo forest. I mean, sure, there are world heritage sites and famous temples/shrines to see.. but c’mon! It’s a forest of bamboo ! What could be better than that? It’s also surprisingly quiet. Even with all the people around, the noise somehow just seems to kinda fade away, making for a nice atmosphere. Maybe it has something to do with growing up in a desert. I’m still shocked and amazed to see trees.

What else have I been up to in my crazy life? Studying , of course! Still no results back on my kanji exam (I think I did all right, though), but I need to start preparing for the next one, which will be held at the end of October. It’s more of a hobby than anything else, so there’s not a lot of stress involved. I’m also , as I may or may not have mentioned, preparing for a Microsoft Excel certification thing, so I need to sign up for that eventually. It’s not really necessary, but it’ll help with my job. Beyond that? I’m still planning to move into translation someday, so I’m reading books on translation techniques and legal vocabulary. Yaaaaaaaay?

 “Youth ,”as they say,“ is wasted on the young .”

But it’s not all boring, dear-god-I-wish-Jason-had-a-hobby stuff! I went out to dinner with some ex students last weekend (they’re doing well!), had lunch with a friend of mine on Sunday (she’s pregnant! It strikes me that I’m reaching the age where my friends are starting to have babies and get married–hopefully not in that order), and next weekend I’m going to an art exhibit. See? I do know how to have fun!

I have more to say and more to ramble on about, but I think I’ll leave it here for now, so I don’t stray into too many topics and come off as random (too late for that!). Best to keep to a common thread, you know? But I will write again sometime soon about life and all that!

For now, I need to watch this movie I rented. Gotta return it tomorrow!

 Trains, Planes, and…Trains 
 By Jason, on June 23rd, 2012 
On the bullet train now, heading toward Kyoto. Why? Because I can ! Well, that and I’m off to go meet an ex-student of mine. Through the wonders of Facebook and mixi (a Japanese networking site, akin to Facebook, that is populated by mostly crazy people. Considering my love for crazy people, I’ve naturally been a member for 6 years), it’s relatively easy to keep in touch with a great many people no matter where you happen to end up in the world. While I taught a wide range of students (3 years old to 82), most of the students I keep in touch with that way were ex high school students of mine. Having taught at the high school from 2008-2011, it means that not only did I see a class from incoming through graduation (Japanese high schools are 3 years long), but it also means that the first class I saw graduate is going to graduate from university next year.

That’s the situation for the student I’m going to visit today. To make it even more interesting, she is majoring in English education and will be an English teacher herself from next April. So it will finally come full circle! My student will have students of her own shortly and the cycle will continue.

So while helping her during her teaching practicum with lesson planning and such, somehow we made lunch plans. Yes, Jason! travels for two and a half hours by bullet train for lunch plans (don’t put it past me, I’ve done far more eccentric things on a whim). I’ll be in Osaka today (going to tour around the university campus and catch up) and then we’re going to Kyoto tomorrow for a whirlwind, 1-day tour.

For those who know the back story, I’ve actually been to Kyoto before. Almost exactly 3 years ago, to the day, in fact (only off by 3 days). There’s only one small caveat: I swore to all that is holy (be it Buddha, Muhammad, or–my personal fave–Jesus) that I would never, ever, ever, never go back to Kyoto as long as I am still alive. I even actually flat out deny that I’ve ever been there (which is especially weird for people who’ve seen the photos). It’s not that I didn’t have a good time–it’s a really nice place–it was just a very awkward set of circumstances that lead into and out of Kyoto.

Not like that matters, ’cause I’m going back to Kyoto anyway ! Sorry Buddha, Muhammad, and Jesus. All the same, I’m sure I’ll have a good time!

What else? Not a whole lot. Worked late, woke up early, on the train now and rambling. One thing I would like to note, though, is that I find it MUCH easier to stand long bullet train rides than airplane trips. I’m not exactly sure why that is (no free drinks…), but I suspect the more liberal ability to get up and walk around if you choose, the lack of pressure differential and your ears popping, and knowing that there are no engines to explode and send you spiraling to your fiery demise must help. Not that I particularly fear airplanes (I love turbulence), but when you fly across the pacific, you always know in the back of your mind that you may end up stranded on a deserted island.

….or am I the only one who packs my carry-on with deserted island survival gear? Huh…I thought everyone did that.

Where was I? I swear, I’m a master at random tangents.

I think that’s my sleep-deprived brain’s way of the telling me it’s time to end this blog post.

Rest assured, I’ll be posting again soon with some more random ramblings and some photos of my adventures. I didn’t spend 4 years of my life on a degree in Japanese history for nothing!

 Are you smarter than a sixth grader? 
 By Jason, on June 17th, 2012 
I’m not sure if I’ve talked about it much in the past, but ever since coming to Japan, I’ve been taking the JLPT , which is the government-sponsored Japanese Language Proficiency Test at every chance. It’s offered twice a year and has five levels, 5 being to lowest and 1 being the highest  (don’t ask; that’s how most Japanese tests work). It tests grammar, vocabulary, listening, and kanji ability. There are no speaking or writing components, so that makes it a little easier, but it’s also a ~3 hour endeavor, so.. yeah. I’m sure you can imagine how much fun that is. The passing rate for level 1 is 30.5%. Did I mention it’s hard?

Anyway, I was busy with job-hunting last year, so I don’t know if I mentioned it, but I finally passed level 1 last summer. In fact, I got my passing notification the same day I got my contract for signing. Not a bad day, I have to say!

Needless to say, it was a pretty awesome feeling to finally finish the proficiency test I had devoted two and a half years to (I started at level 2, finally got that, then the test was revamped to be more difficult. I passed level 1 on my.. third try?), but it was also a little disappointing to have that goal no longer there to reach for. What went from an impossible task that I literally spent 2 hours studying for every single day for 9 months (the people at the coffee shop knew me by name) was now nothing but one sentence on my resume. It’s kinda like graduating from university: you spend 4 years on this, graduate, and then…?

So anyway! With the start of the new year, that brought up the interesting question of what I should do now to keep studying Japanese. Obviously, I read novels in Japanese and watch tv and movies in my free time, but there really is something to be said for motivation if you’ve got a test you’ve paid for and have pass/fail hanging over your head.

 Enter KanKen ! Or, the kanji kentei . This is a test for native Japanese to test their knowledge of kanji. There are 12 levels, from 10 to 1 (yes, I can count. There’s also a Pre-2 and Pre-1 , which makes 12) with 1 being highest again. This requires not only knowing the kanji (to pass the other test, you have to read at a high school graduate level), but how to write them, what components they’re made up of, the names of the components, and all sorts of stuff that probably isn’t useful in day to day life. Today, I just got back from taking my test, level 5, which covers all the characters that one would learn through elementary school. Yes, I got to play out a real-life“Are You Smarter than a Sixth Grader?”

This may seem a bit odd, as I just mentioned that previous tests required knowing all high school kanji, I’m sure it seems a bit odd to have to take on elementary school characters. But again, there’s a big difference between reading and writing, and all the pointless other stuff you need to know. It’s kinda like reading and spelling in English. How’d I do? I won’t get the results for another week or so, but I feel good about it and think I passed. If I did, I’ll try level 4 next time or redo 5 if I didn’t.

Alas, since I am one of those weird people who likes taking tests, I don’t have much time to worry about the next Japanese test. I’ve recently learned that there are proficiency tests for the Microsoft Office programs (Word, Excel, Access, etc.) which I use a lot in my day to day life at work. I’m pretty decently versed in the programs and tasks I do daily, but it can’t hurt to be better. So! I’ve got about a month or two of studying Microsoft Excel. Who’s having fun??

In other news? Not much has changed recently; things have lightened up a bit and I’m not quite as busy, though free time is still kinda limited. I’ll be going to Kyoto next weekend to visit an ex-student of mine (she’s a senior in university now and will be an English teacher next year. Things have come full circle!) and visit some temples. I’ll be sure to take pictures!

Well, it’s about time for me to finish up my weekend. I’m sure I’ll have some exciting shortly. Mmm.. spreadsheets and kanji!

 You’ve all heard it before 
 By Jason, on June 3rd, 2012 
Busy, tired, no time.. yeah, you know the drill. I’ll write something of substance soon (yesterday, 6/2, marks my fourth year anniversary in Japan. That deserves something of note).. but in the mean time, I leave you with a brief summary of my recent life. IN PHOTOS!
 
Nope.. I&apos;ve got no shame
 
I don’t believe in necessarily putting things in order (I’m a“best foot forward”kinda guy, regardless of in which order that foot happened to come), so we’ll start with today. I went with one of my ex-HS students to her university and got the full tour today.
 
The aforementioned student
 
Obviously everything is closed on Sundays, but it was still a lot of fun to look around a Japanese university campus (especially one out away from the city, where it has more room to spread) and see the facilities. University life here is way different from that in the states, so I still find it rather fascinating. It’s also nice for me as the ex-teacher to catch up with some of my students that I taught through high school and see them coming into their own as adults and getting ready to move on into the adult world. I’ve also recently been catching up with another student of mine (but lives elsewhere, so we’ll have to make actual, concrete plans to go out for lunch. Probably this summer) who is actually doing a teaching internship at the school I taught her at and will become an English teacher next year.

I’ve got to say, being in Japan for 4 years is odd enough. Having seen your own student graduate and then getting ready to become a teacher in their own right is even stranger. But a nice kinda strange.

NEXT!
 
Should&apos;ve stopped while he was ahead..
 
I’ve always wished that when you see some sort of police situation, you were given a number you could call for an update. I know it’s absolutely none of my business, but I really want to know what happened here! I was on my way home from work (I get off around 5p, so usually nothing exciting is happening) and walked past a police officer trying to placate the young man while his partner stood by. The guy started yelling and kicking the railing (the police stood there and calmly asked him to stop. In Arizona, we’d have pulled out the taser) and in a matter of minutes, the car came up and more police showed up.

I dunno what happened. I really wish I did. Life is fully of regrets.

LAST!
 
Pon de Lion cupcakes
 
Look at this and tell me that they aren’t adorable. Okay.. now do it with a straight face.

Basically, I got bored one weekend and decided to make cupcakes, throw doughnuts on top of them, and make PON DE LION CUPCAKES! Sure, they’re about 500 calories and will throw a healthy adult into diabetic shock, but.. that’s really not my problem . My job is to make delicious food. Well, not technically , but you know what I mean.
 
Feeling hungry?
 
There just wasn’t enough sugar in between the cupcakes, icing, m&amp;ms (for eyes), chocolate (for the mouth), and the full doughnut.. so I threw candy inside for the confetti look.
 
The Pon de Lion collection
 
And this is what the spread looked like when I brought it all into the office. I try to make our department look like a group of professionals. That’s why I decorate my cubicle with stuffed animals.

That lion means business.

Other than that.. still alive, doin’good.. just tired and busy. I’ll write more later! Now, I need sleep.

 An end to the magic 
 By Jason, on May 6th, 2012 
Well, the Gilded Week has now come to an end, and we get to all go back to our normal lives bright and early tomorrow morning. We also had Cinco de Mayo thrown in for good measure, which reminded me that I really need to make Mexican food again sometime soon (like the awesome party I threw last year with some of my coworkers at the time.. need to find people in the area who have also love tacos.)

So, how’d it go? Well, as I’m pretty sure you all already know, I’m just not terribly exciting. Especially when . . .→Read More: An end to the magic

 (A few days shy of a) Golden Week! 
 By Jason, on April 25th, 2012 
I’d say something about being“really busy lately”, but I’m pretty sure that it’s become a nearly constant refrain in my e-mails and phone calls (as well as here). It’s not really worth mentioning anymore, is it? My schedule seems to be clearing up for the near future, anyway, so it’s not so bad. In fact, next week is the not-quite-a-week-long-holiday called“Golden Week”!

What is Golden Week, you so rightly ask? That is a wonderful question! It’s basically a series of holidays at the end of April and beginning of May that happen to line up so well . . .→Read More: (A few days shy of a) Golden Week!

 Let the 13th day be a Fri… 
 By Jason, on April 12th, 2012 

When your name is Jason, this is going to be a near constant refrain throughout your life. Everyone thinks they’re the first person to notice, and they’re sure to remind you of the hilarity that your name is Jason and that it’s Friday…the thirteenth. Get it???

Oh, it never stops being hilarious. Trust me.

Anyway, haven’t written much lately since I’ve been busy with work. Like.. Really busy. In my free time, I’ve started a translation project, which I’ll talk about soon (once it officially gets off the ground). Right now.. I’ve gotta run . . .→Read More: Let the 13th day be a Fri…

 Stupid Ghost Cat… 
 By Jason, on March 29th, 2012 

Because, for some strange reason, I hear a cat outside my apartment at night.. Even though I live on the third floor and we have a locked security door downstairs. Obviously, it’s a ghost cat. What else could it be?

I should go to bed (gotta wake up in 6 hours), but I’ll leave you with the Japanese version as well. Night!

 A different kind of sushi roll.. 
 By Jason, on March 27th, 2012 
You know those times where it’s a horrible week and nothing’s going right…and it’s only Tuesday? Yep. Been one of those weeks. So I did what any other self-respecting 26 year old man would do:

I made candy!

Don’t tell me you didn’t see it coming. You should know Jason! well enough to know that’s where he’s gonna take it.

I believe I mentioned it last week and briefly outlined my plan. I was going to put off my candy sushi-roll until next weekend, but I kinda needed something to keep me busy for the evening and pick . . .→Read More: A different kind of sushi roll..
