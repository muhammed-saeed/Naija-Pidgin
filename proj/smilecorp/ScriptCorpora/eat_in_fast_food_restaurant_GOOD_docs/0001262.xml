Comments about RadioShack 5-Piece Basic Soldering Set :

This unit performs as advertised.I&apos;ve owned this soldering set for many years, using it several times a year.I have used it on automobile radios,computers and welded a plastic gas can nozzle to boot.None of the negative issues stated here have I experienced.

I would recommend this kit to the casual user without hesitation.

Comments about RadioShack 5-Piece Basic Soldering Set :

I was given this iron as a gift 7 years ago and it still works fine as is today! Ive never used any other soldering iron before, and im not sure how much they have changed in the past 7 years, but mine heats up quickly enough and handles everything I throw at it. I replaced the tip though my improper tinning was actually the problem and I have no complaints. Best [$]I never spent!

Comments about RadioShack 5-Piece Basic Soldering Set :

I can say one thing about this iron. It is great for beginners that are new to soldering. I used it about a year the tip got corroded because I didn&apos;t know how to tin or clean the tip. Then when the tip got bad the generators got weak ended up in the garbage that&apos;s about the cons I can think of? This soldering iron is great for old CRT TV&apos;s and old video-games. This iron fixed my Sega Genesis DC input jack. Keep the tip cleaned at all times. It may last about 10 year or more depending on how you use it. Great for the price even on-sale you can&apos;t go wrong not a bad iron an OK iron.

Comments about RadioShack 5-Piece Basic Soldering Set :

I bought this kit just to try out for simple projects to get myself started soldering. I have completed several different projects already over the last two months, working anywhere from 1-5 hours at a time, and have not had any issues with the tip not heating properly or soldering effectively yet. I would not be surprised if it is not a great product for larger or more complex prijects, but for the simple circuits I was working with (using thin high tech silver solder) it has been a wonderful tool for what is now one of my favorite hobbies. Yes, it takes 2-3 minutes to heat up initially, and the handle can get a little hot, but for the price, I can&apos;t complain much at all.

Comments about RadioShack 5-Piece Basic Soldering Set :

Bought one of these irons when I was just starting out. Yeah... Bad idea. I shouldn&apos;t blame Radio Shack for this though seeing as serious work should requires serious tools that cost more than a lunch at a fast food restaurant, but I was being a cheap and unintelligent novice at the time. Thing burned out on me in a month&apos;s time in the middle of a project I was working on. Ended up having to run to the local hardware store to pick up another brand. Unfortunately, it also is just money wasted as I plan on picking up a serious soldering station once my bonus rolls in.

For any other novices out there who is thinking about picking something up like this... Don&apos;t. Not even for light work. You&apos;ll save yourself time, money and frustration by picking up a proper soldering station. A well made variable temperature station may cost a pretty penny, but it&apos;ll last a long, long time.

Used this item a couple times to desolder and solder some circuit boards. On the 4th board the tip wouldn&apos;t heat up properly. The handle also heats up which could make it uncomfortable during extended use.

Comments about RadioShack 5-Piece Basic Soldering Set :

I bought this from my local store. Used it to solder 20 leds, and then noticed the tip was bad already. Didn&apos;t even use it for an hour. The handle gets pretty hot near the end. The worst part was when I took it back, I got charged a 15% re-stocking fee! It&apos;s pretty sad when you have to pay for defective merchandise. I contacted Radio Shack help line, they called the store, but the store wouldn&apos;t do anything about it, and that is the last I&apos;ve heard. My advice...Don&apos;t buy it!

Comments about RadioShack 5-Piece Basic Soldering Set :

It is evident that peole who write the cons for this product simply don&apos;t know what to buy. A 30 watt iron will never work outside even with the smallest of wire. A 100 - 200 watt soldering gun is needed outdoors for ANY project. Trying to use a 30 watt iron and then saying it is no good is simply being cheap! A 30 watt iro will NEVER do the work of a 100 watt gun outdoors and one cannot expect it to. This is for soldering electronic components in an indoor shop ONLY&gt;Keep the tip clean (standard proceedure) and it will last 15 to 20 years being on at least 5 hours a day as my last one did.
