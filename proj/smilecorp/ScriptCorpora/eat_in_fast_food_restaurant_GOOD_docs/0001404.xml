We&apos;re Not Lovin&apos; It! Fast Food&apos;s Most Famous Flops

A fast-food restaurant&apos;s success is based on a consistent menu of perennial favorites, right? Not always.

But some product introductions just don&apos;t cut the mustard. We&apos;re taking a look at some of fast food&apos;s most famous flopssome of which never made it to the U.S., while others have attempted several comebackswith little success.

Is fast food one of your guilty pleasures? Top chefs reveal the fast-food restaurants they&apos;re not ashamed to love . When you&apos;re ready to take a break from fast food, check out this great collection of healthy, fast-food alternatives .
