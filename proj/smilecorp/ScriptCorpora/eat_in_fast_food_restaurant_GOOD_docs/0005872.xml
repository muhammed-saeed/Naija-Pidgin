Low Platelets - The Rapid Way To Increase Your Platelet Count
 Posted: Jun 10, 2011 |Comments: 0 | 
Have you been wondering what is the fastest way to increase low platelets? You have tried everything and nothing seems to be working. Your frustrated and don&apos;t know what to do. What if I told you that you can have your platelets back to normal or at least close to normal in a very short time! You think it is impossible? Read on and find out why this is possible.

As you already know, platelets are an important factor in coagulation. They are needed to prevent bleeding. But for this you need to have at least 150,000 of them in your blood test to be in the normal range. The upper end of the range goes up to 450,000.

Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia is one of the reasons why platelets can decrease very low. This is actually the old term. It is now called Immune Thrombocytopenia. And this is what we will be concentrating on. There are other reasons why platelets can decrease such as:
 
1. Leukemia
2. Liver disease
3. Chemotherapy
4. Aplastic Anemia (This is where the bone marrow stops working)
5. Others

When there are low platelets due to immune thrombocytopenia the body&apos;s immune system is destroying the platelets. For this reason medical doctors use drugs that suppress the immune system to try and control the problem

Why does the immune system destroy the platelets? There are many reasons:

1. Immune reaction may be due to a virus
2. Food allergies or intolerance
3. Gluten intolerance
4. Vaccinations
5. Helicobacter Pylori
6. Other reasons

Whatever the reason, you can get them back to normal in a very short time. And you can do this by simply using certain herbal remedies and life-style changes. Now you may say that you have tried this before. But it is easy to find a website and simply take this or that herb. People like to experiment. And when the experiment doesn&apos;t work out they throw it all in the trash. The general tendency is to discard all natural remedies as ineffective and quackery.

But in my experience, it is possible to increase low platelet counts in a very short time. Let us suppose your platelets are in the 43,000 range. This is far below the normal range. It is recommended that your platelet levels don&apos;t decrease from the 50,000 range. Others say 30,000. But still, some people who suffer from this low platelet problem will sometimes have levels far lower than this.

 Low Platelets - A New Approach in Natural Treatment 
 
To avoid making this article too long, I am going to try and get to the point. First, you must attack all the factors involved in Thrombocytopenia to be able to come up with an effective ITP treatment.
