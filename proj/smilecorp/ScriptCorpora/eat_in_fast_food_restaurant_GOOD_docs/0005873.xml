 Best Burger Quest Continues - Bub&apos;s Burgers Posted Saturday, November 22, 2008 by Chris Baggott Bub&apos;s 
210 W Main St
Carmel IN 46032
(317) 706-2827
 website    

Located in the Art&apos;s&amp;Design District of Carmel Indiana (about 8 miles from downtown Indianapolis) and just of the Monon Trail might just be a restaurant with the Best Hamburger in Indy.

Handpattied from fresh ground beef, these hamburgers are so special that the owners Matt&amp;Rachel Frey need to have special buns supplied locally from one of our great Indianapolis Bakeries.  Although Bub&apos;s (Big Ugly Burger) is most famous for it&apos;s hamburgers, several people tell me that they compete well as a seafood restaurant Indianapolis with a Mahi Mahi filet. Bub&apos;s is also a popular stop of Ice Cream in the summer for those traveling the Monon Trail.  

In my quest for the Best Burger in Indy I&apos;ve had the chance to write a lot for this Indianapolis Menu Guide. Mostly I focus on Downtown Indianapolis Restaurants, but Bub&apos;s Burgers now gives me a new reason to visit Carmel.

 The Quest for the Best Burger In Indianapolis - 5 Guys Posted Saturday, November 22, 2008 by Chris Baggott Five Guys 
2902 W 86th St
Indianapolis IN 46268
(317) 876-0811

Any credible blog seeking the best restaurant Indianapolis has to have a special place for the best hamburger in Indy right?  I love burgers and am constantly soliciting recommendations.  Well this one: Five Guys is a great new addition to my Indianapolis menu guide.

Now keep in mind, Five Guys is a chain but it&apos;s also a really good burger, not your usual fast food Indianapolis joint. The menu has only three things Hamburgers, Hot Dogs and Fries.  In those catagories Five Guys streaches a little including Kosher Style, Bacon, Cheese for the Dogs, Five Guys Style or Cajun for the fries ( cooked in pure peanut oil ) The claim to fame on the hamburgers is the choice of any or all 15 toppings...all no extra charge.

If your date is a vegitarian, they do have an option of a veggie sandwich using any of the burger toppings and a grilled cheese sandwich...hmmm Maybe I&apos;ll start a quest fo the best Grilled Cheese in Indianpolis next....

 Suburban Indianapolis Bakeries with a Deli on the side Posted Tuesday, November 18, 2008 by Chris Baggott Linnie&apos;s Pastry Shop and Del i
115 S. Harrison
Shelbyville IN 46176
Phone: 317.398.7525

Any blog focused on the topic of local restaurants Indianapolis has got to include some of the surrounding small town. So hat&apos;s off to Linnie’s Pastry which won national fame during the most recent elections for a clever promotion where they scooped other Indianapolis Bakeries by creating and tracking sugar cookie sales in the shape of either democratic donkey’s or Republican Elephants.

Only a small town bakery could pull this off.  By the way, these cookies were good! For $1.99 they had thick buttercream icing in blue and red. As of election day morning, Linnie’s Bakery and Deli had sold 740 donkeys and 659 elephants. That’s a sweet $3,000 bump for clever owners Bill and Diane Moore.

Linnie&apos;s isn&apos;t just a great bakery, It&apos;s also belongs in the family restaurant Indianapolis category. it&apos;s got fast food, hamburgers and is a terrific delicatessen. I think Shelby is one of the prettiest small towns near Indianapolis and it&apos;s really hard to find a good, old fashioned bakery anywhere any more.  You might wonder why I would include Linnie&apos;s as part of a Restaruant Reviews Indianapolis blog, well...there are just not enough Indianapolis bakeries to talk about any more and this one is worth the drive and deserves mention in my Indianapolis Dining blog.

 China King? China Bling! Posted Monday, November 10, 2008 by Jason Gergely This week, the Marketing Team here at Compendium Blogware, along with our newest member Chantelle decided to go to China King just right around the corner from our office. If you want to read up on Compendium Blogware , you can Click Here to check it out!

 We first weren’t sure where we wanted to go, but when the idea of Chinese came up we decided that is where we were going to get our usual Friday lunch. Mikey ordered General Tso’s Chicken and said, “The General was commanding my taste buds.” So I would have to guess that he enjoyed it, along with his fried rice. He ordered some dumplings, but didn’t end up eating too many because he was filled up by “The General”. Chantelle ordered an array of foods. She had Crab Rangoon , Hot and Sour Soup , along with a side of Steamed White Rice. When she got her food, I noticed that her rice came in a huge container and she ordered a “small” side of rice. Meghan ordered the Sesame Chicken with Fried Rice lunch special. The other Megan ordered the Veggie Lo Mein and only had one complaint. She had wished that the veggies in the food were a little larger. As for me, I ordered one of my default dishes when ordering Chinese… Beef with Broccoli along with fried rice. I thought the food was delicious and probably better tasting than any small Chinese food place. Also, make sure that you realize that if you go in a group and you eat in… they will bring all your food out at the same time. BE CAREFUL when you first start eating it. The food is VERY hot. I made the mistake of jumping right into it and burnt my tongue… OUCH! So open it up and let it cool for a few before you dive into your Chinese chow. We all agreed that the portions that they serve are much bigger than you might expect and the price is very reasonable for the amount of food that you get.

As for other things that might be of interest to you, Chantelle mentioned that the place would be great for winter time because you can call in and get carry out, and they even deliver. Meghan said that if you are going to China King expecting a Chinese Food chain experience, you had better think twice. It is different than a typical chain. The food is very authentic and so is the atmosphere of the restaurant. Also, the rush comes in about Noon, so if you don’t want to wait in line you should either have it delivered or go before or after the rush at Noon. I would imagine the rush dies down about 1:30 or 2 o’clock. Another point of note, they take both cash AND credit card… so you don’t have to rush to the ATM before you get there. So if you are looking for a Chinese place to eat here downtown that won’t require you sitting there for two hours… Check out China King, located at 148 N. Delaware St in downtown Indianapolis.

 Usual Suspects Bar&amp;Restaurant Posted Monday, November 3, 2008 by Ellie Cummins Usual Suspects , located above well known basement bar in Broad Ripple, The Casba, is an upscale, yet casual Indianapolis restaurant/bar featuring great food and drinks. Enjoy a great dinner in a quiet atmosphere in the evening and then hang around as things get a bit louder into the night as this place is a favorite of the &quot;late 20&apos;s and up&quot; crowd in the neighborhood.

As a former ethnic Indianapolis restaurant, Greek to be exact, the menu featur es great hummus and pita appetizers and Gyro entrees. Stuffed quesadillas, unique salads, mini burgers, and traditional entrees round out the menu. I reccomend the shrimp or caprese quesadilla and the hummus and pita appetizer. 

 Usual Suspects also features a great bar. Fresh sqeezed juice cocktails are a house specialty, the martini list has all the traditional faves, and the bartenders are always ready to make a good drink suggestion. Although not a true sports bar, the are several flat screen tv&apos;s around and it is a good place to watch a game if you&apos;re not in the mood for the traditional sports bar Indianapolis atmosphere.

 Usual Suspects is located at
 6319 Guilford Ave., Indianapolis, IN, 46220 (317) 251-3138

Open: 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesday, 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 5
p.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday, closed
Monday. Bar open late.

 Downtown Indianapolis Best Steak Restaurant for Ambiance Posted Monday, October 27, 2008 by Chris Baggott Mo&apos;s A Place for Steaks 
47 South Pennsylvania Street
Indianapolis, IN
Phone: 317-624-0720
Fax: 317-624-0721


What I love about this Downtown Indianapolis Steak Restaurant is the setting itself. (I&apos;ll get to the food) I like windows and because of Mo&apos;s location on the Corner of Pennsylvania and E. Maryland you have great windows not only in the front, but also all along the wall on the Maryland side.  I love reviewing Indianapolis restaurants, but don&apos;t often get to talk about windows...but once you have them you hate to give them up.  We are blessed with some great Steak Restaurants in Downtown Indy including Morton&apos;s, St. Elmo&apos;s, Shula&apos;s and Ruth Chris&apos; but none has nearly the great interior of Mo&apos;s.

 When you think of Indianapolis Nightlife, Mo&apos;s is well located next to Conceo Fieldhouse so it&apos;s perfect for before or after an event.  The bar is great for Pub beers and terrific Martini&apos;s or anything else you would want in a cocktail. They do serve lunch but are much better suited as an Indianapolis Dinner Restaruant. No entertainment so it&apos;s not a nightlife place except for the other people who keep it buzzing.

Oh the food....delicious. Excellent Steaks including a huge Porterhouse and awesome filets. Some seafood and of course a hamburger.  What more can I say?

I would put Mo&apos;s clearly in among the best restaurant in Indianapolis and one of my favorite Date places..... Fine Dining for sure.

 Lunch at the Hot Dog Place Posted Friday, October 24, 2008 by Jason Gergely This week Meghan (with an “H”) was in charge of making the decision for the weekly Compendium Blogware Marketing team lunch. If you want to check out Compendium and what we do you can Click Here .

This week Meghan chose a place that is just around the corner from our office called King David Dogs. It is a small place on Pennsylvania Street in the heart of Indianapolis. When you walk in you will see the menu posted right there on the wall. They have a full menu with foods ranging from a corn dog to a New York Dog with sauerkraut, mustard, and a New York style Onion Relish. They serve quarter pound hot dogs on a poppy seed bun (or if you want a pretzel bun) topped with almost anything you want. After leaving the restaurant Megan said she was “thoroughly stuff and did not anticipate being that way.” So when you go make sure you are hungry because the meals are larger than you might expect. She and Meghan ordered the Chicago Dog which had mustard, tomato, a sliced pickle, sweet relish, and onions. Both of them thought it was delicious. To add on, Megan said that it was a “fork and knife” meal and you’re definitely going to need napkins when you get your food, so stock up when you get your drink because it is kind of messy. Meghan also said that it was good for a cold day because all the food is “warm food”. Mikey ordered the New York Dog along with a cup of chili. He also requested some chili on his dog, but the hot dog guru behind the counter advised against it because it would be like a double chili bomb and he might regret it in his future. Mikey said he was glad that he took the guru’s advice. I decided to be adventurous and try the Pretzel dog. It was the same hot dog, but on a pretzel bun. I didn’t know what to put on top of it, so again I took the guru’s advice and put some chili and cheese on top and I did not regret it. However, it is very filling because the pretzel bun is a little larger than the normal bun and I had to take some of it home. As for the price, I think Meghan put it best when she said that it was very reasonably priced for all the food you get (your dog and fries or tater tots). It made the price even better when you order a drink, you get a nice souvenir cup with the King David Dogs logo on it to take back to work for a water cup. Also if you are a ice eater, the ice is light and fluffy, kind of like snow but when it is packed together a little (that is as well as I can describe it so just go get the ice).

The atmosphere was awesome because it gives you that hole-in-the-wall feeling when you walk in. It might not be good for a business meeting because the food might end up on your suit. However, it would be good if you are wanted to step out of your comfort zone and try someplace different. It would also be good for a date, but be sure to bring your gum because those onions will mess with your breath. It would be a great place to grab some lunch in downtown Indianapolis. So if you are looking for a place you can get a hot dog with pretty much whatever you want on it check out King David Dogs located at 15 North Pennsylvania.

 Seafood for lunch? Downtown Indianapolis Lunch Restaurant Posted Monday, October 20, 2008 by Chris Baggott 
McCormick&amp;Schmick;&apos;s Seafood Restaurant at the Corner of Illinois&amp;Market Streets at the base of the Downtown Hilton
(317) 631-9500

As an interested party to this Indianapolis Dining Guide, I&apos;m always on the lookout for something different. Typically during the day downtown I eat lunch as someplace fast.  The other day however, I found myself wanting to go someplace nice with my partner Ali and our big time Lawyer (patent work).  McCormick&amp;Schmick&apos;s was perfect.  The place has just the right mix of being busy with downtown workers (all wearing ties) yet still easy enough to get in and out of. We took a booth in the bar which is really nice looking with big booths and a great wooden bar.  They have two TV&apos;s up high and turned down low on ESPN so you could catch some highlights out of the corner of your eye...but not be intruded on.  

Indianapolis menu guide: they update the menu twice a day so you always know whats fresh&amp;available.

Although McCormick&amp;Schmick&apos;s is a great lunch spot, it&apos;s has really good seafood, terrific for dates, but perhaps most popular among the crowd here at Compendium Blogware it&apos;s the best happy hour downtown. I wouldn&apos;t call it a place for Indianapolis nightlife, but what is so appealing is the great bar and the terrific drinks. Happy hour is fun and crowded partly because of the great menu .  Everything from fish tacos ( for the mexican food lover ) to one of the best Hamburgers in Indianapolis all for like....$1.95 each.  Great prices for great food.  All in all, a place I would highly recommend. See the Video for a sense of the Lunchtime ambiance...

 A little piece of Pennsylvania Posted Friday, October 17, 2008 by Jason Gergely So this week was my choice in where the Marketing Staff at Compendium would be going for lunch. You can check out Compendium Blogware by Clicking Here .

This week I decided to go back to the cornucopia that is the City Market and try out this place called Philadelphia Steak&amp;Cheese. Joined by Monica this time, we agreed that it was a good place to eat, but some felt like the food needed something else. We all ordered Philly Cheese Steaks, but there were also burgers on the menu along with breakfast foods that I believe are only served in the morning. Mikey and Monica felt that the sandwiches could have used more cheese. Monica also thought that the meat tasted like it was re-heated beef, which I guess has a different taste. She also said that the “seasoned fries” would be better if they had the peel on and they need to have lots more seasoning. Mikey mentioned, “The next time I go, I might opt for one for the burgers that I didn’t see until I got up to the counter.”  Meghan said that her sandwich and food was delicious. She had never had a Philly Cheese Steak before and doesn’t have anything to compare it to, but “for the first time it was really, really good and I want to go back.” As for the boss lady, Megan , she really enjoyed her Philly experience. She said that her food was fresh and hot, but could have used more seasoning and cheese. Megan mentioned that it was not as greasy as expected and she really liked the wheat bun (isn’t all wheat bread just wheat bread?). And since it was Boss’s day, we all pitched in for her meal and she loved “that my wonderful team paid for my lunch.” As for my meal, I felt like it was great. I had gone once before last spring, and it was just as good as I remembered. And just like everyone else, I wish there was a little bit more cheese on the sandwich, but overall I thought it was great.

Now the atmosphere of the whole lunch is something we all agree on. Meghan said, “As always, the atmosphere was excellent.” She also felt that the guys behind the counter brought Philadelphia to Indianapolis. Mikey thought the staff was awesome and if you speak even a little Spanish, there is a free lesson at the end of the line. The man there speaks Spanglish and as Mikey found out, if you speak even a little Spanish to him, he will talk in only Spanish. So who-ever said you can’t learn at a fast food restaurant, you can tell them they are wrong. Monica thought the service was very efficient and well organized. The owner really knows how to make a quick, good Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. However, don’t be polite to the cashier (who I think is a real Philadelphian) because he gets thrown off and doesn’t know how to respond. When I gave him my money, I said thank you (just like my mom taught me to do) and the cashier said, “Why are you all being some polite to me, I work in the fast food business, you’re supposed to abuse me.” But I think he was kidding…. a little.

So if you are in the mood for a quick taste of Philadelphia, you don’t have to worry about driving out there and the price of gas. Just cruise over to the City Market located at 222 East Market Street, right in downtown Indianapolis and get your free Spanish lesson along with a good sandwich. If you want to check out was else the City Market as to offer you can Click Here .

 Japanese Food: Saporro Steakhouse and Sushi Posted Monday, September 8, 2008 by Jason Gergely 
While I was talking with colleague, Jenni Edwards, she started telling me about a place she had eaten at recently, and I felt I needed to share it with you. To check out Jenni Edwards&apos; business blog Click Here .


Up on 82nd street there is a steak and sushi place called Sapporo. It is a hibachi grill, where the cooks make your food right in front of you, which is always entertaining. Jenni told me the food was very good…the Miso soup is good because of the small portions that don’t overwhelm your meal. Their sushi is delicious as well, but what is phenomenal there is the Tempura Ice Cream! It’s a deep fried ice cream that is both hot and cold. If you do go there, I would highly recommend saving room for that dessert! As for the price, it is a little more than she expected. The atmosphere is great for almost any occasion, whether you are going with your family or just out to get a bit to eat and might even be a great place for a date. It was highly recommended overall and I am sure that anyone that goes would feel the same way. So if you’re in the mood for some Japanese cuisine here in Indianapolis…check out Sapporo!

 Casler&apos;s Kitchen and Bar is a must see for all sports bar fanatics Posted Monday, June 16, 2008 by Dean Stratman Tucked away in the northeast side of Indianapolis on the Geist Reservoir lays one of my favorite sports bars and restaurants that I have ever been to. One of the reasons for my preference of this excellent Indianapolis restaurant is the fact that lots of my friends work there, and I love getting to see people I know when I go out to eat, but the main reason is the fact that it serves delicious food in a restaurant known for its night life and family restaurant style during the day. While I am not old enough to have much of an opinion when it comes to Indianapolis bars, or any bars for that matter, I would have to say that it seems to be quite an enjoyable place at night when I pass by it at night while driving to friends&apos; houses. However, I can comment on the delicious food that Casler&apos;s serves to me each and every time that I have been there!  If you are looking for a great burger, steak, pizza, or french fries (which I would assume just about everyone eats) then Casler&apos;s is the place for you. My personal favorite at this restaurant would have to be either its cheese fries appetizer or its meaty pizza, as I usually end up eating the entire thing to myself when I go there for lunch or dinner with my family! They also have a very nice atmosphere that mixes the sports bar and pub with the outside edges being booths for family enjoyment (not saying that the sports theme doesn&apos;t come across in the family section however!). Casler&apos;s is a great place to visit, and I would suggest to anyone who is tired of the downtown traffic to head up to Geist Reservoir at Olio Road and 116th Street and check it out!

 Barley Island Noblesville Posted Monday, March 24, 2008 by kristen hanschu Barley Island in Noblesville is one of my new favorite local pubs. This quaint restaurant is by far the best brewery I have ever been to. After receiving a $10 off coupon in the mail a few weeks ago, my fiancé, a few of our friends, and I decided to give it a try. We tend to gravitate towards pubs, especially ones with live music.

 Barley Island has got it all. They have everything from fresh brewed beers that change monthly (and sometimes weekly) to great food and great prices. I started off with a nice Flat Top Wheat and Brian had the Dirty Helen Brown. Both were great and we were shocked by the cheap price that accompanied it. 

For dinner, I got the chicken sandwich with homemade kettle chips. The sandwich was cooked to perfection and the chips that came with it were to die for. Brian’s hamburger was right up there with Red Robin. Our friends had the pork sandwich, which we were told was the house specialty, and indeed it was. 

Another selling point for Barley Island is they have great local bands that play every Thursday to Sunday night. These bands range from country to rock and all have a fun, inviting sound. We will be going back soon since we can’t seem to get enough of this place.

 Yummy Tex Mex Posted Tuesday, February 12, 2008 by kristen hanschu As I stated before, by no means am I the expert in restaurant critiquing. But I must say that my new favorite place to go is Indianapolis&apos; very own Alculpolco Joe&apos;s. Staying true to its name, it is everything the name makes it out to be. If you like Mexican food, you will like this place. 
    
There is so much to try here, your mouth will be watering once you take a look at their extensive menu. We started off with the chicken avocado soup. This soup is perfect for chilly winter weather when you just want to curl up next to a fireplace with a comforting, warm meal. Each bite holds a variety of textures and flavors such as chewy, shredded chicken and smooth chunks of avocado. Additional tastes of garlic and onion add flavor to this delicious soup. 
    
They have green chile rellenos have a wonderful warm flavor when roasted, which is perfect for a chilly evening. They are stuffed with cheese, dipped in an egg batter and fried. The flavors and textures blend perfectly together. Queso fresco (fresh Mexican cheese) is a traditional choice for this wonderful dish. 
    
I ended the evening with the sopapillas. It&apos;s a classic Mexican snack made with a little sugar to sweeten it. Usually &quot;sopes&quot; as they are sometimes called are topped with meats and veggies, but these sweet versions are topped with fruit. 
    
Another fine Indianapolis Menu Guide find. This wonderful little downtown Indianapolis restaurant is the cat&apos;s meow! 
    
This commercial for Best Tex Mex says it all:

 The Best Steak&apos;s In Indy Posted Tuesday, February 12, 2008 by kristen hanschu Indianapolis is known for its beautiful downtown area, nice mid-western people, and of course, the food! This city has some of the most fantastic restaurants in all the region. I do have to say that out of all the steak houses and rib places in the city, the best one is by far Flemings Steak House. 
 
 I originally found this place in the Indianapolis Menu Guide and have to say that it was worth every penny. It is a bit on the pricey side, so if you are looking for Burger King pricing, stay away from here. Known, for its excellent service and fine wines, Flemings Steak House was everything it was even better than I could have imagined. My company and I arrived and were promptly greeted by one of the hostesses. She knew that we had a reservation and seated us right away. Once we sat down we were blown away by their wine selection. The waiter came quickly and went over it with us in detail along with the evenings specials and appetizers. 
    
 I started off with a salad, and my friend began with the lobster bisque. We Flemings Steak House followed these up by two of the most incredible steaks. We ordered a fillet mignon with mashed potatoes and a porter house with the vegetable medley. 
    
Of course dessert was offered, and quickly accepted on our end. We were so full after the meal that we decided to split one of these succulent desserts. We went with a tradition cheesecake, but there was nothing traditional about it. It was nothing short of fantastic. It came with three different kinds of sauces that you could tell were prepared by one of the best chefs in the business. 
    
So next time you are looking for steak in Indianapolis, look no further. Stop at Flemings Steak House and you will not be disappointed.

 Plainfied Indiana 
 St. Rd 267 at Interstate 70 
 Next to Thortons Gas Station 

 I&apos;ve not had the pleasure, but Woodfire Grill has been voted the best burger in Indianapolis.  I&apos;m sure it&apos;s for good reason judging by the menu and the apparent ambience.  As the name implies, this Hamburger&amp;Steak Restaurant cooks everything over an open fire.

 Claddagh Irish Pub Indianapolis Restaurant Posted Wednesday, December 26, 2007 by Chris Baggott Claddagh Irish Pub 
 234 South Meridian St. 
 Indianapolis, IN 46225 
 317-822-6274 
 Other Indianapolis Locations 

 So in spite of Claddagh being a chain, it&apos;s one of the best restaurants in Indianapolis if you are looking for an authentic pub experience.  With a great hamburger and steak as well as seafood, Claddagh is really great at the traditional Irish fare offering a full menu of some of the best food in Indianapolis. 

 Although this restaurant is absolutly family friendly, let&apos;s face it.....this is a Pub and it&apos;s really all about the beer.   The offer a full bar of course, but what make this really special is the great selection of terrific Pub style brews.

 MCcormick and Schmick&apos;s Posted Thursday, September 27, 2007 by Kaila Woodside 
 Last week I tried out McCormick and Schmick&apos;s Happy Hour. It was simply amazing! Great food for such a low price! I looked over the items from the Famous $1.95 Bar Food Menu. I tried the fried Calamari with cocktail sauce and the spinach and artichoke dip. They were both amazing. The cocktails were also great. My cosmopolitan was mixed to perfection and the bar tender was great. The service was great, the food was tasty, and the bill was amazing!! 

 Definitely going back! If you would like to go here: check them out at

 Champps is the spot for football season Posted Monday, August 13, 2007 by Mike Hinker 
 After attending a Colts game, my friend, Jim, and I decided to grab a burger at Champps. After we sat down we realized what an awesome place it is to watch a game, or I should say,&quot;games!&quot; Champps has every football game on countless TVs, it is a football fan&apos;s dream come true. Jim and I ordered a couple beers and burgers and watched a few different games at the same time. We decided that coming to Champps may be better than attending the actual game!

 Get a great burger after work at Working Man&apos;s Friend Tavern Posted Tuesday, July 31, 2007 by Mike Hinker One of my favorite places to hang out after a long day is Working Man&apos;s Friend Tavern. It is a great place to grab a cold beer after work while enjoying one of their award winning burgers and a stack of onion rings. Its a perfect place to meet up with buddies after work to unwind after a stressful day at the office. It is located off Belmont Ave. in Indy it is a central location to everyone around the city to meet up and kick back. The next time you are feeling like a burger, head over to Working Man&apos;s Friend Tavern.
