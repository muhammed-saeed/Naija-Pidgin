Low-Carb Fast Food
 By ErinGettingFit: Erin Effenheim 
 How to Eat Low-Carb at a Fast-Food Restaurant: 

Who among us has not been short of time and at least tempted to drive through at a fast-food restaurant? Depending on the definition of“fast food,”most of us eat food from fast-food restaurants at least once per week and often more. The finger has been pointed at this practice as one of the reasons for the obesity epidemic, and indeed, it is difficult to get a healthy fast-food meal. On the other hand, it is not impossible to eat fast food occasionally without ruining your diet.

There are three main rules to maximizing the healthy food and minimizing the sugars and other carbs at a fast food restaurant:

 1. Compare the Nutritional Information at the fast-food restaurants in your area. Below are links to the nutritional information at most of the popular fast-food chains. In particular, look for salad dressings with little sugar—some have packets with over 4 teaspoons of sugar included! And look for other low-carb items such as these:

 2. Order Salads with Grilled Chicken (not“crispy fried”, or other chicken with breading). Occasionally, you’ll see salads with other protein, but chicken is the mainstay of fast-food meal salads. Tips: 1. Skip the croutons, tortilla strips, and similar additions. 2. Be very careful about the dressing! (This cannot be over-emphasized. You may have to bring your own.) Also, look for salads with a mixture of greens, and a variety of vegetables.

 3. Order Burgers and Sandwiches Without Bread - Again, check the carb counts ahead of time. Anything breaded and fried, as most fish and many chicken sandwiches contain, is going to have a lot of added carbohydrate. Add a“side salad,”following the above tips, to the bunless sandwich. In some places, you can ask for a separate larger container such as those the meal salads come in. Then dump the side salad into it, and put the protein on top.

Advice for Specific Fast Food Restaurants

Here are some specific tips about the menu items in these fast food restaurants:

 Burger King 
 Burger King is the second largest hamburger fast food chain restaurant, so it’s often convenient. But how does it stack up in terms of offerings for those of use who are cutting carbs? Here’s how to find your way around the Burger King (BK) menu. Nutritional Information (PDF) : Information, including carbohydrates, on all the standard Burger King menu items. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell about the individual components, McDonald’s does this, and it’s very helpful. You might be able to guess about the condiments by looking at the McDonald’s tool.

Ordering Burgers at Burger King

Obviously, ordering burgers without the bun is the way to go. You will get the burger in a plastic container with most of the condiments. As with many other places, mayo seems to be considered a condiment for the bun, not the burger, and you won’t get it unless you ask for it. You may have to ask for a knife and fork to go with it. Hamburgers have zero carbs, but some of the condiments have carbohydrate. Other than saying that the ketchup has 3 grams of carbohydrate and the mayonnaise zero, BK does not give information about the condiments.

Other Sandwiches

The best bet on other sandwiches is the Tendergrill Chicken Sandwich without the bun at 3 grams of carbohydrate. If you get the Veggie Burger bunless it will cost you 19 grams of carb, and the rest go up from there.

Salads at Burger King

Salads at BK are, unfortunately a little disappointing. In particular, the side salads are almost entirely iceberg lettuce. A thin slice of tomato and a few tiny carrots complete the“Garden Salad”. The base for the meal salads is a little better, as it has the more-nutritious romaine lettuce included.

The only low-carb meal salad option is the Tendergrill Chicken Garden Salad, at 8 grams of net carbohydrate (not counting dressing and skip the croutons). The Tendercrisp Chicken Salad has 23 grams of net carbs.

The dressings, as always, contain a wide range of carbohydrate. The best one is the Ranch Dressing at 2 grams of carbohydrate per packet. (Do NOT get the Fat Free Ranch Dressing, as it contains 15 grams of carb!) The Creamy Caesar and Light Italian dressings could also reasonable choices, at 4 and 5 grams, respectively. And you don’t have to use the whole thing, of course.

Sides and Desserts

The only real possibility is the Fresh Apple Fries (which aren’t fried, BTW) at 5 grams net carbs. Skip the caramel sauce of course.

If you just want a Chicken Tender or two, they are a little over 2 grams of carb apiece. Choose the Ranch dipping sauce at 1 gram per container.

Breakfast

There are a couple of omelet sandwiches that you could get without the bun, but there is no information about carb counts in that case.

Beverages

Obviously water, diet sodas, and coffee are the zero carb options (or almost so). Don’t be tempted by the iced coffee, with a diet-busting 66 grams of carbohydrate. And believe it or not, the shakes go up to 154 grams of carbohydrate and 960 calories!!

With care, an occasional meal at BK won’t break your diet, but there isn’t enough nutrition available there to make it a habit.

 KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) 
 KFC (Formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken) is the world’s most popular chicken restaurant chain. For a long time, the chicken there was all breaded and high in carbs, but there are now some good low-carb options. 
Where to Find Information About Carbs at KFC
 A nutritional information brochure is available at all KFC restaurants. It won’t tell you about custom options such as ordering a sandwich without the bun, but since sandwiches aren’t the star attraction at KFC, it isn’t that much of an issue. 
KFC’s Grilled Chicken
 Low-carb, low-calorie, and low-fat dieters alike rejoiced in 2009 when KFC finally introduced grilled chicken, complete with the spice mixture that made KFC famous. Unfortunately, it still has wheat in it, so I had to rely on other tasters, who assured me that the flavor of the original KFC was there. (One person, who hadn’t eaten KFC chicken in years, did say that it is not nearly as good as homemade grilled chicken.) And the good news is: Zero carbs are in the grilled chicken, as well as half the calories of“Original Recipe”and even more of a savings from“Extra Crispy”and“Hot&amp;Spicy.”For example, an Extra Crispy chicken breast has 17 grams of carbohydrate and almost 500 calories compared with 0 grams of carbs and 180 calories for a grilled breast.

However, the news isn’t all great, as the chicken is still loaded with additives, including MSG and partially hydrogenated oils. This is true of all KFC Chicken. (Question to KFC: How hard would it be to make a grilled chicken that people with wheat allergies and gluten sensitivity can enjoy?)
 
KFC Salads
 Salads are a decent low-carb meal option at KFC. The best choices are labeled“Roasted Chicken.”For example, a Roasted Chicken Caesar Salad (without dressing or croutons) has three grams of usable carbohydrate, while a Chicken Caesar Salad, which uses lightly-breaded chicken, has 7 grams. A Roasted Chicken BLT Salad has 4 grams usable carbohydrate, while a Chicken BLT Salad has 9 grams and a Crispy Chicken BLT Salad as 11 grams. (To make the calculation of“useable”carbohydrate, I have subtracted fiber from the total.) 
KFC salads (both meal salads and side salads) are a mixture of Iceberg and Romaine lettuces. The salads except for the Caesar salads also include chopped tomatoes.

 Salad Dressings –KFC has better options than most fast food restaurants in terms of salad dressings without a lot of sugar. The best choice is the Buttermilk Ranch dressing at just one gram of carbohydrate per packet. However, avoid the fat-free version, which has a lot of added sugar, to the tune of eight grams per packet. The other low-carb choice is the Light Italian dressing with two grams of carbs. The Creamy Parmesan has four grams. And, of course, skip the croutons.

Forget the Sandwiches and Bowls
 At KFC, the wraps and sandwiches range from 27 grams of carbs, up to 49 grams, all of it delivered by refined, low-nutrient, high-glycemic flour. The bowls (Pot Pies, etc) range from 34 grams for the snack bowls up to a whopping 106 grams for the Famous Rice and Gravy Bowl. 
KFC Sides
 KFC has two low-carb sides: the Green Beans at 3 grams of usable carb, and the Mean Greens at 2 grams. The rest are pretty much outside the realm of low-carb eating. In particular, the cole slaw and baked beans are loaded with sugar, and, of course, biscuits, potatoes, corn, and rice are all high in carbs. 
Beverages
 The beverages provided at KFC restaurants vary from one location to another. Most have unsweetened iced tea and at least one type of diet soda. But be careful—there are sweetened flavored iced teas (lemon, peach, and raspberry) which have nearly as much sugar as a cola or other soft drink does. Also, don’t think you’re doing your kids any favors by getting them the Tropicana fruit drinks instead of soda, as most of them have more sugar than a comparably-sized soda. 
Bottom Line
 KFC’s grilled chicken greatly enlarges the low-carb choices, however, the sides are still mostly loaded with sugar and starch. Choose carefully! McDonalds Say what you will about McDonald’s, it’s the the largest food chain in the world, and it continues to grow both in the U.S. and internationally. In recent years, the McDonald’s chain has been putting effort into including healthier choices on its menu. But what does it have for those of us who restrict our carb intake?

Where to Find Information About Carbs at McDonald’s

McDonald’s has brochures available in its restaurants which provide information about most of the menu items as they are usually served. However, regional and seasonal specialties, new additions to the menu, and customized orders (for example, burgers without the bun) do not appear in this brochure.The good news is that McDonalds has a great tool on its Web site that provides all of this information. For example, selecting a cheeseburger on that page shows that it has 33 grams of carbohydrate, with 28 coming from the bun, 1 from the cheese, 1 from the onions, and 2 from the ketchup. You can click on“bun”and it will remove the information about the bun from the nutritional totals. This information makes it easy to order a customized item, and know how much carbohydrate is in the item.

Ordering Burgers at McDonald’s

Obviously, ordering burgers without the bun is the way to go. You will get the burger in a plastic container with two pieces of lettuce. If you are lucky you will be able to use the lettuce to pick up the burger, but don’t count on it. Ask for a knife and fork to go with it. Hamburgers have zero carbs, but some of the condiments have carbohydrate. Processed cheese, tomato slices, and onion have about a gram of carb each. For ketchup or Big Mac sauce, add 2 grams.

Other Sandwiches

Grilled Chicken at McDonald’s has additives with about 2 grams of carbohydrate per patty. Crispy chicken fillets have 10 grams of carb, and Filet-o-Fish come in at 9 grams. Tartar sauce or mayo dressing have one gram of carbohydrate, but you may not get these unless you ask for them. Premium Ranch Sauce has 3 grams of carbohydrate. A Ranch Snack Wrap will rack up 33 grams of carbohydrate, with 22 of them being in the tortilla.

For Nutrition, Choose Salads–But Be Careful

Obviously, the sandwiches aren’t going to help with your all-important servings of vegetables. For that, the only place to turn is salads. Happily, McDonald’s salads are a cut above salads at many other fast food establishments in that they contain a variety of greens, instead of just the standard iceberg or romaine lettuces. This goes for their side salads as well as their meal salads. They also contain small carrots and grape tomatoes. The side salads have 3 grams of net carbohydrate (not counting dressing).

The meal salads are trickier. The best bets are the Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken or Bacon Ranch Salad with Grilled Chicken, at 9 grams of net carbs each (skip the croutons). Any other option adds lots of carbs from breading, glazes, tortilla strips, etc. The carb count is as high as 38 for the Southwest Salad with Crispy Chicken.

The dressings are another potential mine field. Assuming you use the whole (in my opinion huge) packet of dressing, you will get anywhere from 4 grams of carbohydrate for the Creamy Ceasar Dressing or Low Fat Balsamic Vinaigrette (the only ones even close to being low in carbs) to a whopping 15 grams for the Low Fat Sesame Ginger Dressing.

Tempted by the Snack Size Fruit and Walnut Salad? Don’t be. The sugar in the yogurt and the glaze on the walnuts are the culprits in raising the total grams of net carbs to 29 for this“snack”.

McNuggets, Fries, Desserts, and Most Breakfasts

Just put them out of your mind. You could get the scrambled eggs all by their lonesome for breakfast, or conceivably skip the muffin on the McMuffin, but I advice you to make your own breakfast.

Beverages

Obviously water, diet sodas, coffee, and unsweetened iced tea are the zero carb options. You might be tempted by the new coffee drinks, but check them out carefully. All of the flavored ones have a lot of sugar except for the sugar-free vanilla, which contains a syrup sweetened with sucralose (Splenda), acesulfame potassium and erythritol. This syrup is listed has having carbohydrate, but it would presumably come mainly from the erythritol which shouldn’t raise blood sugar in most people. Also, cappuccinos and lattes have milk which contains lactose.

So, while no one will pretend that fast food delivers the ultimate in nutrition, with careful choices you can hit the McDonald’s drive-through occasionally without wrecking your diet.

 Subway 

Subway promotes itself as a“healthy alternative to greasy fast food,”and this marketing approach has proven very successful. Studies headed up by Brian Wansink, director of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, concluded that Subway has acquired a so-called“health halo”—people give themselves“credit”for eating at Subway and indulge in extra treats when they do so. People also underestimate the calories consumed after eating at Subway, as compared to a hamburger fast food franchise, such as McDonalds.

How does Subway fare as a provider of food for those of us on low-carb diets?

Goodbye to Low-Carb Wraps

Subway used to be a place to get a variety of low-carb offerings, notably low-carb wraps. At one point, Subway worked with Atkins Nutritionals to develop these sandwiches, which proved to be popular with low-carb eaters. However, in spring 2007, Subway suddenly (and without announcement) substituted high-carb wraps for the low-carb items they had been selling. The white flour they are made of offers very little nutrition, and each wrap has about 38 grams of usuable carbohydrate—the equivalent of over three tablespoons of sugar.

Unfortunately, the sandwiches are worse. Grams of carbs for the 6″subs are mostly in the 40s, with the Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki sandwich leading the pack at 54 grams. And yes, count on doubling those numbers for a foot-long sandwich.

Back to Salads

What’s a low-carber to do? As it so often seems to be, salads are the fall-back position. The good news is that Subway offers a variety of meats and other toppings in their salads. Most of the salads have only 7 to 10 grams of usable carbohydrate, and between 110 and 150 calories (not counting the dressing). Excluding the Veggie Delight salad, Subway salads have between 12 and 19 grams of protein, and the meat can be doubled, if you would like. I think they are pretty tasty, especially with the olives and three kinds of peppers.

Choose your salad dressing wisely. Your best bet is the oil and vinegar they put on the subs, which has zero carbs. The ranch dressing is next best pick, at 3 grams for a 2-ounce packet. A packet of fat-free Italian dressing has 7 grams of carb, and the red wine vinaigrette is loaded with sugar (17 grams of carb–that’s over 4 teaspoons of sugar!).

How About Nutrition?

Subway proudly declares that one of their salads provides five servings of vegetables. While this is technically true, the vast majority of the servings are iceberg lettuce. Unfortunately, this is one of the least nutritious vegetables available. Salads have four grams of fiber.

Bottom Line

Subway is not really a health bargain for those of us attempting to limit sugar(carbs) in our diets. The salads are fine as an occasional meal, but we’d do better finding a salad made with darker greens and a greater variety of vegetables.

 Wendy’s 
 Wendy’s is the third-largest hamburger fast food chain in the world, behind McDonalds and Burger King. Can you drive through Wendy’s and not drive out with sky-high blood sugar? You can, if you are careful.

Where to Find Information About Carbs at Wendy’s

There is a nutritional information brochure at Wendy’s, but it won’t tell you about custom options such as ordering a burger without the bun. Happily, the Wendy’s Web site does have that information. If you click on“Food”and either go to the menu item, or to the Nutrition Facts section, you can find a menu item and click on the words“Personalize It”. This gives you a list of the components of each sandwich, and lets you check or uncheck each item, and then compute the total for the customized item. (I did find this tool to be a bit finicky, but with a bit of persistence, it worked adequately.)

To see a list of the all the menu items and their nutritional information, you can go to this PDF file , but at the time I wrote this, it did not print correctly from any of my browsers.

Ordering Burgers at Wendy’s

Obviously you will want to be skipping the bun when ordering hamburgers, as the buns contain as much as 30 grams of carbohydrate. The good news is that Wendy’s not only gives you the burger in a separate box, but will encase it in leaves of iceberg lettuce, so that at least with single-patty burgers, you can actually pick up the burger (with two hands, and carefully). This is an improvement over the limper lettuce that McDonalds uses. (Burger King doesn’t give you any at all.) Note: Since this review I have returned to Wendy’s and did NOT get the lettuce!

Hamburger does not contain carbohydrate, so any carbs will come from the condiments. American cheese slices, tomato, and onion each have one gram of carbohydrate. Sadly, the“mayonnaise”that Wendy’s uses has corn syrup and modified starch in it, so that a teaspoon contains a gram of carbohydrate. OTOH, you won’t get mayo unless you ask for it, as it seems to be a condiment for the bun rather than the burger (a common practice). At Wendy’s, ketchup adds 2 grams of carbohydrate, and honey mustard sauce 3 grams.

Other Sandwiches at Wendy’s

Wendy’s fish fillets have 15 grams of carb, so fish is out. The“Chicken Grill Fillet”is your best bet at only 1 gram. It comes in the“Ultimate Chicken Grill”sandwich and you can ask for it in the Chicken Club sandwich (again, of course, skipping the bun). The Homestyle and Crispy chicken patties are breaded, so they are not good choices.

Salads at Wendy’s

Of course, salads are going to be the mainstay for low carb eaters. First, it’s important to understand the dressings, because there are huge differences between them. For example, the oriental sesame dressing is loaded with sugar, at 19 grams per packet. (That’s almost 5 teaspoons of sugar!) At the other end of the spectrum is the Caesar dressing at just one gram of carb. Other standard dressings are Classic Ranch or Ancho Chipotle at 3 grams, and Honey Dijon at 9. Other salad dressings are“available at select restaurants”–check out the brochure or Web site.

Wendy’s has four meal salads and two side salads on the menu. The best choices are the Chicken Caesar Salad at 7 grams of net carb without croutons and the BLT Chicken Salad (no croutons, substitute the grilled chicken and get a lower-carb dressing instead of the Honey Dijon) for 9 grams of carb).

The side salads (not counting dressing) are 6 net grams of carb for the regular side salad and 2 for the Caesar without croutons.

Wings and Nuggets

Chicken Nuggets have about 2 grams of carb for each nugget. If you get them, add the Ranch Dipping sauce for one carb gram—all the other types are significantly more.

Hungry for wings? Go elsewhere, as an order of wings will run you between 56 and 73 grams of carbohydrate! Ack!

Side Dishes at Wendy’s

The above side salads are your best bets. You may be disappointed, as I was, to find out that Wendy’s Chili has more carb than you’d hope for—probably because some type of sugar appears in the ingredient list six times! Therefore, a small chili has 14 grams of net carb and a large, 23. (This still could work on some lower-carb diets.)

The mandarin orange segments (which are also in the Mandarin Chicken salad) are in a sugar syrup, and have 18 grams of carb.

We don’t need to even discuss potatoes and French fries.

Beverages

Your choices are water, diet soda, unsweetened hot or iced tea, or coffee. Everything else is basically flavored sugar.

To sum up, while no one will pretend that fast food delivers the ultimate in nutrition, with careful choices you can hit the Wendy’s drive-through occasionally without wrecking your low-carb diet.
