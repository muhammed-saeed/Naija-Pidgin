 TEASER 




 INT- AH.COM SHIP- CAPTAIN’S OFFICE- DAY 

The camera shows DR. WHAT, GREY WOLF, and LANDSHARK sitting around a table with accounting books open all around it. They look unhappy.

 DR. WHAT 
Good God… how could this have happened?

 GREY WOLF 
It just snuck up on us. We haven’t been going over
these often enough. We should have caught it weeks ago.

 LANDSHARK 
Hey, we’re supposed to hold these reviews every Thursday.
Why haven’t you been scheduling them, oh high and mighty captain?

 DR. WHAT 
Well, if you recall, last Thursday, you were being held captive by those
sentient possums on timeline 45772, and the rest of us had to go in and rescue you.

 LANDSHARK 
Yes, but…

 GREY WOLF 
And the whole week before that, you and IRONYUPPIE
were drinking and whoring on that timeline where the
Greek gods are still worshipped, and it was the feast of Dionysis.

 LANDSHARK 
Yes, but…

 DR. WHAT 
And the week before that, you begged out of the
meeting because IRONYUPPIE made you wear
that Alice in Wonderland costume and…

 LANDSHARK 
All right, all right! I get it. Things came up. But
that doesn’t change the fact that we’re broke. No
matter how you look at it, the ship’s treasury fund
is empty. How did it happen?

 DR. WHAT 
 (pulls a book over to him) 
Let’s go over it again… income for last month…
$420 for that slave rescue on timeline 9983.2.

 GREY WOLF 
I thought they were only paying us $100 for that.

 LANDSHARK 
They were… when MATT found that out,
he turned around and sold the slaves to that
Roman Imperium timeline we ran into last year.

 DR. WHAT 
I see. Okay… here’s one for $178
for… fishing? What the hell…

 GREY WOLF 
Uh… that’s actually DAVE HOWERY’S scheme…
he uses LUAKEL for bait to attract pedophiles into
dark alleys and then robs them.

 DR. WHAT 
What?! I can’t believe DAVE would do that!
Turn the money over, I mean…

 GREY WOLF 
He didn’t want to, but LUAKEL spilled
the beans, and I ordered him to do it.

 DR. WHAT 
You gave an order and it was obeyed?!
How’d you manage to do that?

 GREY WOLF 
I appealed to his sense of generosity and fair play.
And I made sure I did it in front of KEIRA. Naturally,
he didn’t want to look like a miser in front of her.

 DR. WHAT 
I see. And… damn. That was all the income we had last month?

 LANDSHARK 
Yes. And we had all the normal expenses incurred…
maintenance, spare parts and supplies, posting bail
for half the crew after shore leave… I enjoy being
on this ship and exploring the timelines, but running
an MES is an expensive business. And now, we’re broke.

 DR. WHAT 
Any chances of picking up some
freighter business on this timeline?

 GREY WOLF 
I looked into that, but this timeline seems to have all
the freighter business tied up with a small group of guilds.
We can’t break into the racket.

 DR .WHAT 
All right then. We’re going to have to be very careful.
Let’s baby our equipment as much as possible and shift
out of here to some other timeline where we can pick up
some business. So long as we don’t have any major malfunctions….

A loud BOOM is heard off camera, and the scene shakes. As the three officers look around in puzzlement, DAVE HOWERY is heard on the intercom.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Uh, Captain, we have a problem here. PSYCHOMELTDOWN
just shorted out the shift engines.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (also heard on the intercom, in the background) 
Hey! You’re the one who was testing them!

 DAVE HOWERY 
Well, you might have told me that you had removed all the oil
before I did! Why do you need so much lubricant anyway?!

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (long pause) 
Never mind.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Anyway, Doc, I’m going to need a hell of a lot of money from
the ship’s funds to replace the central drive shaft on the engines.

DR. WHAT puts his head in his hands and groans.

 “TEMPS” 

 Written By : DAVE HOWERY 




 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

The entire crew is gathered in here, all facing DR. WHAT.

 DR. WHAT 
And that’s the situation, people. We’re stuck here and we’re broke.
There’s no chance of getting a shipping job here. So, there’s only
one solution… most of you are going to go down to the planet and
take temporary jobs until we have the cash we need to make repairs.

The crew erupts in protests and angry shouts.

 KIT 
Engage in manual labor like a common peasant?!
I’m much too pretty to do that!

 MICHAEL 
What? Temporary jobs? But if we’re all down there,
who’ll stay up here and do my necessary work, such as… umm…

 LANDSHARK 
That’s enough! You crewmembers are just going to
have to suck it up and go do the work, while we officers
stay up here and carry on with our vital command tasks.

 DR. WHAT 
Uh… you and GREY WOLF are going too.

 LANDSHARK and GREY WOLF 
What?!

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (horrified look) 
W… w… work?!

 DR. WHAT 
I thought you guys react this way, so I took the liberty
of checking around and found some temp jobs for those
who are going. Fortunately, there’s a bit of a worker
shortage on this timeline, so I was able to come up with jobs pretty fast.

 GBW 
Well, if we absolutely have to do it to repair the ship,
I suppose we’ll just have to buckle down and do it.
But you’re hinting that not everyone is going…
who’s staying behind?

 DR. WHAT 
Well, G BONE for one…

 G BONE 
Yay!

 DR. WHAT 
Because he’s going to be in the Teleportation Room 24/7,
sending you people back and forth on your various shifts.

 G BONE 
Damn it!

 MATT 
We’ll probably have to leave LUAKEL aboard too, since he’s only 12.

 LUAKEL 
15!

 MATT 
Whatever.

 DR. WHAT 
Yes, but don’t worry, I have a special assignment for LUAKEL up here.

 LUAKEL 
It’s not like the last one in your quarters, is it?

 DR. WHAT 
Hey! It’s not my fault you misunderstood when I told you to ‘polish my rod!’

 LUAKEL 
You could have told me you were talking about your scepter!
 (pause) 
Why do you have a scepter anyway?

 DR. WHAT 
Never mind, you’re too young to know that.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (whispering to LUAKEL) 
I’ll tell you later, it’s a good story, with ninja lesbians and kittens.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (horrified look) 
W… w… work?!

 GBW 
So, DOC, what did you find for us? Did you match
up our skills with appropriate employment?

 DR. WHAT 
Well, actually, I went with an employer down there
who just happened to have a lot of job openings right
now. It’s a chain of Turkish fast food joints…

The crew members all groan.

 MATT 
Fast food?! Are you kidding?!

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (outraged) 
No! I will never work fast food, NEVER!!
It is beneath my dignity, my skills, my…

 DR. WHAT 
Relax, DAVE, you’re going to be in their repairs division,
fixing equipment and such. And since when does anyone
on this ship have any dignity?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Good point.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (horrified look) 
W… w… work?!

 DR. WHAT 
Okay, I have folders for everyone who’s going down to the planet,
telling you what you’ll be doing, where you’re going, etc. So everyone
get a good night’s sleep. From what I’ve calculated, you’ll all need
to work about 4 days to get the cash we need to buy the parts we need.
 (pause) 
One word of warning: this place is a bit uptight. Not exactly neocon
standards, but still pretty puritanical. So be on your best behavior.

Everyone groans in sheer misery, and then all leave the room, except for FLOCCULENCIO. He still has a blank look of horror on his face.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (horrified) 
W…w… work?!

 CAPTION SCREEN: DAY ONE 

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- HYDROPONICS BAY- DAWN 

The camera pans across the darkened room. Little can be seen until the door opens, and DR. WHAT and LUAKEL are seen. DR. WHAT steps inside and flips a light switch. As the room lights up, the two look around the room with grim expressions. This room is huge, one of the largest rooms on the ship we’ve seen to date. There are a dozen long tables with hydroponic growing tanks on them. Many large steel tanks are lined against one wall, with hoses coming out of them and fed into the planters. Metal cabinets and shelves are set into the other walls. The planters are all dry, with the remains of many many many many many many marijuana plants in them, all shriveled and desiccated.

 LUAKEL 
Ah geez, captain… how am I supposed to fix this mess?

 DR. WHAT 
Hard work and elbow grease. It has to be done. This place
can provide us with most of the food we need. It used to do so,
until STRAHA came aboard and converted it all to pot.
 (muttering) 
Damn hippy…

 LUAKEL 
But… I don’t even know where to begin!
I don’t know anything about hydroponics.

 DR. WHAT 
That’s why they call it ‘on the job training.’ As for where to begin…
get rid of all those pot plants… or what’s left of them. Haul them all
down to the incinerator. Then, make a plan about what to plant where.
The seeds and growing mats are all in those wall cabinets. As for the
chemicals… well, the manuals are right there. Just be sure to use
the proper mix for each type of plant.

He points to a wall shelf, filled with 20 huge volumes. At the sight of that, LUAKEL’S shoulders slump.

 LUAKEL 
Reading?! I have to do reading on this job?!

 DR. WHAT 
It’s a sacrifice, but we all have to do our part. Good luck, kid.

DR. WHAT walks out of the room, whistling.

 INT- AH.COM KITCHEN- DAWN 

The camera pans across the darkened room. Ovens and cooking gear can vaguely be seen. The door opens, and DR. WHAT and FLOCCULENCIO walk into the room and turn on the light.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Hey, thanks for not making me go down
to the planet and w… w… work!

 DR. WHAT 
Before you thank me, you’d better take a look around.

FLOCCULENCIO looks around the room, and he looks stunned. The camera pans across the room, showing mounds of cooking pots, utensils, and plates, all dirty and sporting an incredible variety of multi-colored mold; basically, the kind of mess that only a ship full of bachelors could make.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
You… you’re not saying that I have to clean this up, are you?!

 DR. WHAT 
I’m afraid so. Once upon a time, this ship could produce
enough food to feed a crew three times this size, and this
kitchen is big enough and has the equipment to do it. So,
your job is to get it into shape. And keep it that way… we
need someone in here on a regular basis, and you’re the
only one who can do it… mostly because everyone else has other jobs to do.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
But… I’m a highly trained mech corvette pilot!

 DR. WHAT 
You mean, a highly trained pilot who has a broke down mech corvette. Besides, you’re better off than PSYCHOMELTDOWN.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (long pause) 
God, that’s true. Okay, I don’t like it, but I see
the need to do it. You can count on me to get it done.
 (another pause) 
Hey, once I get this place spiffed up, I can make
some of my famous East Singaporean tuna curry!

 DR. WHAT 
 (suppressing a shudder) 
Yeah, that sounds good. Carry on.

As DR. WHAT leaves the room, FLOCCULENCIO walks over to the sink and starts removing a huge pile of dirty dishes. The camera pans over to a cabinet on another wall, where a bottom door is open. We see a long and dirty pink tail slowly pull into the darkened cabinet, and then a pair of glowing red eyes looks out at FLOCCULENCIO… and then a second pair… and then another… and another.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- ENGINEERING- MORNING 

PSYCHOMELTDOWN is seen working on a piece of the shift engines. He looks tired and dirty. He snaps a final piece back into place and stands up, groaning as he does.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Okay, LEO, that’s done. Is that everything?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Hardly. You still have to change the ionization fluid in
the ucephalus tri-converters, remove the drive shaft and
grind the rough spots in the housing, and scrub the
men’s room toilet with your toothbrush.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Hey! You made that last one up!

 LEO CAESIUS 
Yeah, I was bored. But you do have to do that
other stuff, plus steam clean the duo-carbon exhaust.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
This blows! Why am I stuck doing all of DAVE’S work?!

 LEO CAESIUS 
Because you’re the one who took all the oil out of the
engines without telling anyone, and thus, the cause
of everyone else having to go work temp jobs down on the planet.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Yeah, but…

 LEO CAESIUS 
I’ll let you off the hook if you tell me
why you needed so much lubricant.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (long pause) 
So… the ucephalus tri-converters, huh?
I’ll get right on that.

 EXT- SAULT STE. MARIE- MORNING 

The camera shows a view of an empty parking lot. The sun is rising in the background. The camera stops on OTHNIEL and GBW, who are looking at something off camera in disbelief.

 GBW 
My God. That’s the most offensive thing I’ve seen in years. And considering where we come from, that’s saying something.

The camera switches to their POV, and we see the outside of a fast food restaurant. The neon sign on the front reads “Omar’s Turkish Delights” and has an incredibly stereotypical picture of a fat Turkish man with a beard and a fez, smiling and waving.

 OTHNIEL 
Who could have come up with such
a blatantly disrespectful concept?

 INT- TOPEKA KS- OMARS TURKISH DELIGHTS- MORNING 

The camera opens on a scene of the dining room of the restaurant. HENDRYK and TORQUMADA are seen looking at a large picture on the wall. A legend on it reads ‘Our Founder’ and the picture is that of (who else?) the local version of ABDUL HASHI PASHA.

 TORQUMADA 
Well, it’s nice to know that on at least one timeline,
a version of one of our crew made it big.

 HENDRYK 
Yeah, but he sold out by portraying his people in a crude
and offensive manner, all to make a buck.
Who on our crew would do that?

 TORQUMADA 
Uh… all of them?

 HENDRYK 
Well… true.

 INT- TALAHASSEE FL- OMARS TURKISH DELIGHTS- MORNING 

We see LANDSHARK standing in front of a big industrial wash sink. Next to him is a huge stack of squeaky clean dishes and trays. He looks to the other side, and the camera pans to show six more equally huge stacks of dirty dishes, waiting to be washed. LANDSHARK groans in dismay.

 LANDSHARK 
Blimey, this job is really the worst! Let’s leave.

 IRONYUPPIE (off camera) 
Now, now, you know this has to be done. If we don’t
put in our share, we’ll be stuck here on this timeline
forever. Just make the best of it… try to make a game
out of it, like me.

The camera switches to IRONYUPPIE, who is standing at a butcher block table with a huge cleaver in her hand. She’s chopping steak into shis kebab sized bits. She pauses and stares down intently at the meat.

 IRONYUPPIE 
Why, hello WYLDCARD4!
 (WHACK) 
What’s that? You brought a friend? Pleased
to meet you, EVOLVEDSAURIAN!
 (WHACK) 

 INT- MEMPHIS TN- OMARS TURKISH DELIGHTS- MORNING 

The camera focuses on THANDE, who is idly stirring something in a pot and looking bored out of his mind. He looks around and picks up a bottle of spice, and squints at the label. He picks up several other bottles of condiments and reads those labels also. He then starts mixing several of them together in the pot. He picks up one final bottle, and doles out a tiny amount into the pot. A loud explosion is heard and a cloud of smoke fills the screen. When it clears, THANDE is standing there with a shocked expression and no eyebrows. He goes back to stirring the pot, looking around to see if anyone noticed.

 INT- SAN FRANCISCO CA- OMARS TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAY 

We see DAVE HOWERY deep inside an oven, obviously repairing it. With a groan, he pulls himself out of it, and stands up, covered with grease and oil. A restaurant manager stands nearby.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Well, it should work now. What’s next on the list?

 MANAGER 
The pump on fryer #3 is out, the ice machine is down,
and the big freezer is running too high.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (groans) 
And I have four more restaurants to go to after this?!
All I can say is, if it wasn’t necessary to do this to get
the ship repaired, I’d be gone in a flash.

 MANAGER 
Well, after a 10 hour work day,
you’ll have a cool $20 for your trouble.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Wha… that’s it?! I’m doing all this
crap for twenty stinking dollars?!

 MANAGER 
Hey, I don’t know what it’s like on your timeline,
but on this one, $20 per day is prime wages.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Fuck this!

He takes out a communicator.

 DAVE HOWERY 
G BONE, teleport me to Engineering.
I, uh, need to get some more tools.

Seconds later, he disappears with a loud pop, leaving the wide eyed manager looking on in surprise.

 EXT- BOSTON- DAY 

The camera opens on a scene dominated by a huge armored truck with the words “Omar’s Security and Armor” painted on the side. A security guard is standing by the drivers’ side door, looking impatiently at his watch. He looks around as MATT walks into the scene. He’s also wearing a security guard uniform and is clutching a holstered pistol to his chest.

 GUARD 
Man, what took you so long?

 MATT 
I looked for a bigger gun… but couldn’t find one!

Tears roll down his cheeks.

 GUARD 
Buck up, man! This outfit hauls all the cash from Omar’s
restaurants in Boston to his central bank here, and
we need to be on constant vigilance!

 MATT 
 (suddenly interested) 
Really?! Maybe I should go back to my ship,
grab a rocket launcher, some grenades…

 GUARD 
No! Christ, we don’t want to scare the hell out of our clients.
Just follow procedures, and chances of us being robbed are minimized.
Let’s roll.
The two climb into the truck, and it drives off in a cloud of exhaust.

 INT- NEW YORK CITY- OMARS TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAY 

The camera shows KIT standing behind a cash register, with a store manager looking over his shoulder, trying to explain how to operate it.

 KIT 
I’ll never get the hang of this American money! It’s all green!

 MANAGER 
Well, they all have different portraits on them.
See, this one has Alexander Hamilton on it.

 KIT 
Who?

 MANAGER 
Well, just read the numbers on them, then. Now, the coins…

 KIT 
Hey, they are all different sizes!
That makes sense! This smallest one
is the lowest denomination, right?

 MANAGER 
No, that’s a dime, ten cents, and
it’s in the middle of coin value.

 KIT 
So, why is it smaller than the others?

 MANAGER 
 (exasperated) 
It just is!

 KIT 
Why are these pennies copper colored
and all the others silver?

The manager groans.

 INT- TOPEKA KS- OMARS TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAY 

The camera opens with a close shot of TORQUMADA’S face. He has the blank zombie-like ‘1000 yard stare’ of combat veterans who have seen too many of the horrors of war and death. The camera slowly pulls back, and we see that he is peeling a potato. As the camera pulls back more, we see a huge mound of potatoes on one side of him, a growing pile of peels in front of him, and a much too small pile of peeled potatoes on the other side.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- HYDROPONICS BAY- DAY 

The door opens, and LUAKEL comes in, dragging an empty cart. The camera pans across the room, and we see that all of the pot plant remains have been disposed of, and the growing tanks are clean and shined. LUAKEL walks wearily over to a wall cabinet and opens the door. Thousands and thousands of seeds of nearly every vegetable plant known to man are inside, neatly lined and categorized. He starts dragging out packets, tossing aside the broccoli ones with an ‘ick!’

 INT- SAULT STE. MARIE- OMARS TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAY 

GBW is seen at the drive up window of the restaurant. He hesitantly completes a transaction, hands a bag to the customer, and shuts the window. A manager is watching him.

 MANAGER 
Hey, that was good! You picked this up pretty quick. Great job!

GBW looks around in shock. Tears glisten in his eyes.

 GBW 
Oh. My. God. That was… that was… praise? From a superior?
It’s been so long since I’ve had anything like that! None of the
so-called leaders of our ship would ever do anything like that!
I’m so happy! This is the best job ever!

He breaks down and weeps with joy.

 INT- SEATTLE WA- CALL CENTER- DAY 

The camera pans across a room full of desks with telephones and computers. Several bored looking people are sitting at them, talking on headset phones and typing on keyboards. Two of them are MICHAEL and DMA. They look even more bored than the others.

 DMA 
 (speaking into headset) 
Hello, how may I help you? Your pilaki was undercooked?
I’m sorry we had a problem with that, please stay on the line
and I’ll have our representative issue you a coupon.
 (pause) 
Hello, how may I help you? Your piyaz had a hair in it?
I’m sorry we had a problem with that, please stay on the line,
and I’ll have our representative issue you a refund voucher.
 (pause) 
Hello, how may I help you? Wait… you want me to suck your…
damn it, LANDSHARK, get off the line!

DMA pushes the button to hang up the phone, rather angrily.

 DMA 
Damn it, I don’t think I can take three more days of this!

 MICHAEL 
Yeah, this job bloody well sucks. But it’s still better
than working in the restaurants, wouldn’t you say?

 DMA 
Yeah.

He groans as another call comes on his line.

 INT- TOPEKA KS- OMARS TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAY 

We see the kitchen of the restaurant, and HENDRYK frantically assembling various dishes of food. A manager walks into the scene.

 MANAGER 
Hurry it up, folks! I need six more orders of ashure,
five orders of lokum, and eight more trays of manti.
Hustle!

HENDRYK groans, but keeps working.

 HENDRYK 
This job stinks! But… it is necessary because
He Who Died and Returned has decreed it so.
I know that he is working and thinking of me,
his first and most devoted of servants.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- DR. WHAT’S QUARTERS- DAY 

DR. WHAT is seen sprawled on a couch, his television on and blaring. He has a big tub of popcorn and a six pack of beer. The television can be heard off camera.

 TELEVISION (off camera) 
Today, on the Jerry Springer show… cross dressing
meth addict midgets who want to have sex with furniture,
and the women who love them.

DR. WHAT sits up, an interested look on his face.

 DR. WHAT 
Wow! I wish HENDRYK was here to see this.

 INT- SAULT STE. MARIE- OMARS TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAY 

We see OTHNIEL standing near the entrance to the dining room, dressed up in a stereotypical Turkish costume, with pointed toe slippers, a fez, and a vest. He’s obviously a greeter, and is doing his best to remain cheerful as customers walk in.

 OTHNIEL 
Hi, welcome to Omar’s!

 ED COSTELLO 
Get bent!

 OTHNIEL 
Hi, welcome to Omar’s!

 NEKROMANS 
Bite me!

 OTHNIEL 
Hi, welcome to Omar’s!

 ZYZZYVA 
Hail Satan!

 OTHNIEL 
Hi, wel… wait, what, Satan?!

 EXT- GENERIC OUTDOOR SETTING- EVENING 

The camera shows the sun setting behind some low hills, somewhere in the great American Midwest.

 INT- INDIANAPOLIS- OMARS TAVERN- NIGHT 

The camera sweeps across the interior of a typical night club, although this one is decorated with a Turkish theme. A poster on the wall reads “Welcome to Omar’s Tavern; a subsidiary of Omar’s Turkish Delights.” GREY WOLF is seen walking through the door. He looks around, twitches for a moment when he sees all the alcohol in the place, and then walks over to a manager.

 GREY WOLF 
Hi, I was told to report to work here.

 MANAGER 
Ah, you must be the temp worker assigned to us. Well,
you’re going to be doing the sweeping and cleaning, and
help close up after we shut down for the night.
Let me get you some gear.

He turns and picks up a broom and a dustpan, and turns to give them to GREY WOLF… and his eyes go wide with shock.

The camera switches to his POV, and we see that GREY WOLF has stripped down to his underwear, has a bottle in one hand, and is staggering as he belts out a song at the top of his (unmusical) voice.

 GREY WOLF 
SHE WUR A ITSEEE BITSEEE TEENEE
WEENEE YELLR POKA DO’ B’KINI….

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- HYDROPONICS BAY- NIGHT 

The camera sweeps across the room, showing that LUAKEL has been busy all day. All the growing tanks have been filled with seed mats. LUAKEL places the very last one in, and straightens with a groan. He walks over to a computer station that is marked “Hydroponic Chemical Drip Control.” He takes down one of the many manuals from the shelf nearby and opens it.

 LUAKEL 
 (reading aloud) 
For legumes, set the growth medium at 27%, with a potassium mix of 3.5% and a phosphorous ratio of 3:1… oh, fuck this!

He tosses the manual aside, and looks at the computer station for a moment. He types in several commands on the keyboard.

 LUAKEL 
There… everything at a nice even 50%. Reading sucks.

He leaves the room. As he does, the storage tanks begin to whir, and chemicals start pouring into the growing tanks.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- KITCHEN- NIGHT 

FLOCCULENCIO is seen drying a pan he just washed, the last of a large stack by the sink. We see that he has managed to clean part of the kitchen, but a lot remains to be done. He puts the pan down, and looks around the room, with a self satisfied smile on his face. He leaves the room and turns off the light, leaving the room pitch black. After a moment, a pair of red eyes is seen, and a low angry hiss is heard.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- CAPTAIN’S OFFICE- NIGHT 

DR. WHAT and LANDSHARK are sitting at the table in here, looking over some computer printouts.

 DR. WHAT 
So, how did everyone do on their first day?

 LANDSHARK 
So… tired… must… concentrate.
 (shakes head) 
Well, we collected just under a quarter of the money we
need to fix the engines. Everyone’s pay is going into the
special account, as you requested. But… I don’t see an
entry for DAVE HOWERY. Damn it, that slacker!

 DR. WHAT 
It’s probably just an accounting error. He wants to get away
from here as much as the rest of us, he wouldn’t stiff us on this.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- ROBOTICS LAB- NIGHT 

We see DAVE HOWERY building something in here. It is obviously a human shaped robot; the rough framework completed so far has two legs, two arms, and a neck.

 CAPTION SCREEN: DAY TWO 

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- PSYCHOMELTDOWN’S QUARTERS- DAWN 

The camera pans across the room, showing that it is decorated with all things Alison: posters, pictures, figurines, rugs, coffee mugs, a life sized cardboard cutout, and a blowup Alison love doll sitting on a chair. The camera pans over to the bed, where PSYCHOMELTDOWN is sprawled out, fast asleep and looking totally exhausted; in fact, he seems to have slept in his clothes. An Alison shaped alarm clock by his bed goes off, but PSYCHOMELTDOWN doesn’t even twitch. After a moment, the clock shuts off, and the lights in the room turn on. LEO CAESIUS is heard on the intercom.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Wakey wakey, PSYCHO! Time for another day of endless
grunt work repairs under my ever watchful eye.

PSYCHOMELTDOWN stirs and mutters something that sounds like “Five more minutes, Mommy!”

 LEO CAESIUS 
Fine, then.

The camera pans upward to the ceiling, where a fire suppression system is mounted. One of the nozzles swivels straight down and fires a jet of cold water. Off camera, PSYCHOMELTDOWN is heard screaming in shock and anger.

 INT- TOPEKA KS- OMAR’S TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAWN 

The camera shows TORQUMADA still peeling potatoes, with a blank brain dead stare on his face. He actually drops the potato he’s peeling but doesn’t notice, and keeps making peeling motions with his hands. After a moment, he makes a tossing motion, and then picks up another potato and starts the process over again.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- HYDROPONICS BAY- DAY 

LUAKEL is seen walking in and turning on the lights. He stares around in surprise, and the camera switches to his POV.

The plants in the growing tanks have grown amazingly overnight. They stand tall and vibrantly healthy. Ripening vegetables and fruit can be seen on the stems. LUAKEL looks around with a big grin and walks over to the computer station.

 LUAKEL 
This is great! And I had the drip amounts only set to 50%!
I bet if I set it to 100%, we’ll have food to last till doomsday!

He types some commands on the keyboard, and the chemical storage tanks gurgle as more chemicals are sent into the growing tanks. LUAKEL smiles and leaves the room. The camera pans back to the growing plants. As the extra chemicals start to pour into the tanks, the plants are seen to… twitch.

 INT- NEW YORK CITY- OMAR’S TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAY 

We see KIT at his register, waiting on a long line of customers.

 SBEGIN 
Hi, I’d like two orders of beef kofte, with
ayran to drink, and a side of helva please.

 KIT 
That’ll be $12.99 at the next window please, thank you.
 (pause) 
Hi, may I take your order please?

 RAN EXILIS 
mumble mumble mumble.

 KIT 
Eh… what was that again?

 RAN EXILIS 
mumble mumble mumble.

 KIT 
Uh… a sucuk sandwich with leblebi?

 RAN EXILIS 
NO!! I WANT AN ORDER OF KUZU GUVEK,
ARE YOU FRIGGING DEAF?!?!

 KIT 
EEK!

He hides behind the counter.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- KITCHEN- DAY 

FLOCCULENCIO is seen with a stack of plates in his arms, balancing them as he moves to put them away. Much of the kitchen has been cleaned, but there is still some work to do. He nudges a cabinet door open with his toe, and starts to bend down, but something long and furry lunges out of it and rears up in front of him. It is a monstrous rat the size of a Saint Bernard, with patchy grey fur and long talons. FLOCCULENCIO howls in terror, drops the plates, tries to scurry backwards, but trips and lands on his butt on the floor. The giant rat moves towards him, and he hastily scoots backwards. He looks around frantically and sees a large cast iron griddle on the floor. He picks it up just as the rat lunges towards him. He swings it down on the rat’s head; the rat drops, twitching. FLOCCULENCIO stands up, looking down at the rat with awe. Sounds from off camera distract him, and he looks around to see more of the monstrous rats coming out of the cabinets; several of them are between him and the door.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- ENGINEERING- DAY 

PSYCHOMELTDOWN is seen leaning on one of the shift engines, fast asleep, a pipe wrench held in one hand.

 LEO CAESIUS 
PSYCHO!!

PSYCHOMELTDOWN jerks awake and beats the pipe wrench feebly against the engine cowling.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
It’s the carberator, I tell ya….

 LEO CAESIUS 
Since the shift engines don’t have carberators,
I really doubt that. Now, snap to it, and get to
remagnetizing the containment cylinders
of the Heisenberg Compensator.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Damn it! That’ll take me half the day!

 LEO CAESIUS 
Well, if you hadn’t…
 (pause) 
Hang on, FLOCCULENCIO is yelling for me.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- KITCHEN- DAY 

FLOCCULENCIO is seen huddled in a corner. He has a sauce pan on his head as sort of a helmet, the lid of a big roasting pan as sort of a shield, and the big griddle in his other hand. Six of the giant rats are confronting him, hissing and snarling, while four others lie dead on the floor with griddle shaped dents on their heads.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Damn it, FLOCC, what do you need? I’m trying to keep
PSYCHO busy, and that’s a full time job.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Good God, can’t you see?! I’m under attack here! Send help!

 LEO CAESIUS 
Everyone else is busy. Look, you can’t bother me
every time you run into some vermin. You’ll have
to just handle it yourself. I’m outta here.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
No! LEO!!

 INT- SEATTLE WA- CALL CENTER- DAY 

We see DMA and MICHAEL at their desks; both look a little blurry from boredom and lack of sleep.

 MICHAEL 
Hello, how may I help you? The manager called you a what?!
I’m sorry we had a problem with that, and I’ll… what? No,
I can’t personally fire anyone, but I’ll be happy to turn you over
to… no, ma’am, I’m not being difficult, I really can’t…

MICHAEL listens to the phone for a moment, and then obviously snaps.

 MICHAEL 
Very well, ma’am, I’ll review the case. You said the manager
called you a fat ugly slob. First of all, I need to know if you
are really fat or not, because I need to know if he lied or not.
Now, I don’t know if you’re ugly, but I’m going to assume
you are, because you sound like you’re ugly. You want to talk
to my superior? Sure, its 1-800-GO FUCK YOURSELF!!

He viciously punches the button to turn off the phone, and looks over at DMA, who is looking at him with wide eyes. MICHAEL blushes a little.

 MICHAEL 
Whoops. Probably shouldn’t have lost my temper like that.

 DMA 
Actually… I think you just found a
way to make this job interesting.

The two look at each other a moment, and then both grin.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- ROBOTICS LAB- DAY 

DAVE HOWERY is sipping a cup of coffee, looking tired, but still sharp eyed. The robot he is building is much more complete, with servomotors, joints, and steel plates all installed. KEIRA is standing behind him, looking at him in puzzlement.

 KEIRA 
Is this a plan that you and the captain agreed on?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Not… exactly. But trust me, babe, this is going to make
us more money than me screwing around with ovens and fryers.

 KEIRA 
I don’t know… I get nervous around
robots after that whole Peanuts thing.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Trust me, honey, when I get done with this, we’ll
have enough money to keep the ship running for months.

 KEIRA 
Aren’t you worried the captain will find out what you’re planning?

 DAVE HOWERY 
How could he? I think he’s off somewhere working, like the rest of us.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- DR. WHAT’S QUARTERS- DAY 

DR.WHAT is seen lying on his couch again, watching his television.

 TELEVISION 
 (soap opera music) 
Oh, Brett, tell me you love me! Let’s kill your comatose wife,
collect the insurance money, and run off together, and live the
lives we’ve always dreamed of, as a pair of traveling karaoke singers!

 DR. WHAT 
Wow. What a bitch.

 INT- SAULT STE. MARIE- OMAR’S TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAY 

The camera opens on TORQUMADA still mindlessly peeling potatoes. HENDRYK walks in with a steel pan. He pauses to look at TORQUMADA, then reaches out and slaps his cheek. TORQUMADA doesn’t react at first, but then shakes his head and looks up at HENDRYK.

 TORQUMADA 
Oh… hi. What’s up?

 HENDRYK 
Need to refill my potato bins. How’s it going down here?

 TORQUMADA 
What day is it?

 HENDRYK 
Uh… day 2.

 TORQUMADA 
That’s it?! I’ll go mad, I tell you, MAD!!
 (pause) 
Sorry.

 HENDRYK 
Hey, I understand. I mean really, what kind of drooling
fool would actually like a job like this?

 INT- SAULT STE. MARIE- OMAR’S TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAY 

We see GBW briskly working at the drive through window. He has a big smile on his face, and is energetically filling orders, taking cash, and thanking customers for their business.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- CAPTAIN’S OFFICE- NIGHT 

Once again, LANDSHARK and DR. WHAT are seated at the table. DR. WHAT looks surprisingly rested, while LANDSHARK is a mess.

 DR. WHAT 
Hey, we’re moving along pretty nicely here.
Have almost half the money we need.

 LANDSHARK 
Grmph. Mrzzle. Hmphlmp.

 DR. WHAT 
What? Damn, LANDSHARK, go get some sleep.
You’re a wreck, and you have an early morning tomorrow.

LANDSHARK looks at DR. WHAT with near incomprehension, but the word ‘sleep’ gets through his fogged mind, and he shuffles out of the room.

 CAPTION SCREEN: DAY THREE 

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- PSYCHOMELTDOWN’S QUARTERS- DAWN 

PSYCHOMELTDOWN is seen sprawled on his bed again, looking almost comatose in his exhaustion. Suddenly, the lights in the room light to full intensity, and “Stars and Stripes Forever” is heard blasting over the intercom at full volume.

PSYCHOMELTDOWN hops out of bed with a scream and looks around frantically.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Rise and shine, PSYCHO! I have another
big list of repairs for you today!

PSYCHOMELTDOWN whimpers.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- KITCHEN- DAWN 

FLOCCULENCIO is sitting in a corner, pot still on head, lid still in one hand, and griddle still in the other hand. He is red eyed, and obviously exhausted, but is looking around constantly.

 FLOCCULENCIO 

Can’t sleep, rats will eat me,

can’t sleep, rats will eat me…

 INT- TALLAHASSEE FL- OMAR’S TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAWN 

We see LANDSHARK pull his hands out the dishwasher and look at them in despair.

 LANDSHARK 
My hands… my poor poor beautiful hands…

A loud thumping sound is heard off camera, and LANDSHARK looks that way. The camera pans from him to IRONYUPPIE who is wielding her meat cleaver with both hands, obviously enjoying her work far too much.

 IRONYUPPIE 
Why hello (WHACK) there 09CAMERO (WHACK) ,
it’s sooo nice (WHACK) to meet (WHACK) you! (WHACK) 

 INT- SEATTLE WA- CALL CENTER- DAY 

MICHAEL and DMA are seen in here, eager grins on their faces, and a pile of props around them. MICHAEL’S phone rings, and he puts it on speaker.

 MICHAEL 
Hello, how may I help you?

 VOICE ON PHONE 
 (elderly female voice) 
My name is Mrs. Jones, and I have a complaint about your
store in Jackson, Mississippi. They gave me the wrong change
back for the third time this month. I want action taken now!

 MICHAEL 
Well, I’m sorry we had a problem with that Mrs. Jones,
and we’ll take care of that immediately. In fact, we’re
going to fire the manager right now!

 MRS. JONES 
Well… that’s harsh, but something needs to be done.

 MICHAEL 
We have the manager and assistant manager here, and
let me assure you, they will never be a problem again.
First, the assistant manager…

MICHAEL takes out a starter pistol and fires off a blank round. DMA makes a dramatic scream and thumps down hard on the ground.

 MICHAEL 
There you go, Mrs. Jones, he’s out of the way!

 MRS. JONES 
Oh my God! You shot him!

 MICHAEL 
But wait, there’s more! The manager himself
will now be terminated. But first…

MICHAEL takes a couple of thin dowels and snaps them in half.

 DMA 
 (fake high voice) 
AHHHHH! My fingers!

 MRS. JONES 
Oh God, this is horrible! Please stop!

 MICHAEL 
But Mrs. Jones, we’re just getting to the good part!

 DMA 
Oh God, not my testicles! No! NO! AHHHHHHH!!

MICHAEL takes a pear of shears and cuts a piece of licorice in half, making a loud snipping sound.

 MRS. JONES 
For the love of God, please stop… gasp… can’t breathe…

 MICHAEL 
And now, we terminate him!

MICHAEL puts a watermelon on the desk, takes out a sledgehammer, and hits the melon. It bursts with an awful squashing sound.

 MRS. JONES 
Vision… going… dim…

 MICHAEL 
And now, to completely make up for the bad treatment
you received, we’re going to burn down the store in Jackson!

MICHAEL pours lighter fluid into an ashtray and tosses a match into it; the fluid ignites with a whoosh.

 MICHAEL 
There you go, Mrs. Jones, we’ve made
up for everything they did to you!

Nothing is heard on the speaker phone, except for the gasps and choking of someone having a major coronary. MICHAEL and DMA look at each a moment, and then MICHAEL turns off the speaker. Both sit down quietly.

 DMA 
Think we overdid it a bit there?

 MICHAEL 
Nah.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- HYDROPONICS BAY- DAY 

The camera opens on a shot of the door. It opens, and LUAKEL comes in, pulling a cart behind him, with a shovel, pruning shears, and several baskets; he obviously intends to collect the vegetables and fruit. However, he stops and looks around, stunned.

The camera switches to his POV, and we see that the room is massively overgrown, and now looks like a jungle. Strange calls are heard in the depths of the foliage, which shakes as unseen things move through it. No sign of the fruit or vegetables is seen. LUAKEL runs over to the computer station and types in a code on the keyboard. The gurgling sounds of the chemicals running into the tanks stops. As LUAKEL turns to look at the plants in despair, something rustles in the foliage nearby. LUAKEL runs to his cart and grabs the shovel out of it, turning around in fear.

A small animal the size of a sheep comes into view. In fact, it looks a lot like a sheep, but is obviously some mutant form of cauliflower. It has a head and four stubby legs and big dark eyes. It looks up at LUAKEL in curiousity.

 LUAKEL 
Aww… it’s cute!

He starts to reach down to pet it, but another plant creature leaps out of the foliage. This one looks like a tiger grown out of a monstrous carrot. It leaps on the cauliflower/sheep and tears its head off. It starts to feed on the carcass, but is distracted when LUAKEL hastily backs away. The beast stalks towards him, and he desperately swings the shovel at it. By sheer luck, he swings it edge on the beast’s neck, and cuts the head off. LUAKEL looks down at the two vegetable monsters lying dead on the floor.

 LUAKEL 
Well… I guess this is dinner.

 INT- SAULT STE. MARIE- OMAR’S TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAY 

OTHNIEL is still in his greeter position. He looks not as cheerful as he did; the strain is obviously getting to him, and he speaks in a dull monotone as customers walk in.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- ROBOTICS LAB- DAY 

The camera opens with a close shot of DAVE HOWERY working on something off camera. He pulls back, screwdriver in hand, and wipes his forehead with one hand. The camera pulls back, and we see that the robot he has been working on is an exact copy of DR. WHAT. KEIRA is standing behind DAVE, rubbing her hands together anxiously.

 KEIRA 

Oh, DAVE, I think the captain is going to
be really peeved if he finds out about this.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Well, I’ll make sure he doesn’t find out then. Besides,
I always wanted to have a copy of DOC, just in case I
ever want to issue orders in his name and not have him
know about it. And now…

He takes out a remote control and pushes a button. The WHATBOT opens its eyes and looks around. It looks at DAVE and grins.

 WHATBOT 
Hey, dude!

 DAVE HOWERY 
Hey. How are you?

 WHATBOT 
All systems are nominal.

KEIRA looks nervously at the WHATBOT, and then over at the glass cabinet that BILL and HILLARY are stored in.

 KEIRA 
DAVE, he’s… not like those two, is he?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Nope. He doesn’t have one bit of sexual programming in his coding.
Hell, I didn’t even make him a penis… unnecessary work.

The WHATBOT looks horrified, and runs a hand over its crotch. A look of fury goes across its face.

 WHATBOT 
You… bastard!!

It grabs DAVE HOWERY by the throat, throttling him. DAVE flounders for a moment, trying to remove the arms, and then pushes a button on the remote control. The WHATBOT releases him and shuts down. DAVE HOWERY takes a deep gasping breath.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Okay, I do have to tweak his programming a little.

 INT- NEW YORK CITY- OMAR’S TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAY 

KIT is seen working on the cash register. He is also showing the strain, and has deep circles under his eyes.

Yes, I’d like a number seven, hold the garlic.

He hides behind the counter.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- DR. WHAT’S QUARTERS- DAY 

DR. WHAT is playing a game on an X-Box, furiously working the controller. A game box beside him has the title “Smurfs: the Game.” The sounds of explosions and digital screams are heard on the television. DR. WHAT suddenly stops and stares at the screen, then gets up and does a happy dance.

 DR. WHAT 
YES!! I killed Gargamel! Woo hoo!!

 LEO CAESIUS 
Uh, DOC, I hate to interrupt you when you’re ‘busy’, but…
actually, that’s not true, I love interrupting you. Anyway,
you’d better check up on some of the stuff going on around
the ship. I’m getting strange readings from the Hydroponics Bay,
and FLOCCULENCIO hasn’t come out of the kitchen since yesterday morning.

 DR. WHAT 
Oh all right.

He gets up and goes over to an intercom system on the wall, and pushes a couple of buttons.

 DR. WHAT 
Hey, LUAKEL, how’s it going down there?

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- HYDROPONICS BAY- DAY 

LUAKEL is seen answering DR. WHAT’S page on the intercom.

 LUAKEL 
Everything’s fine, DOC. I even have some vegetables
harvested for dinner tomorrow night.

 DR. WHAT (on intercom) 
Keep up the good work. Out.

As LUAKEL pushes the button to turn off the intercom, the camera pulls back, and we see that he is holding the shovel, and that it is covered with bits of plant leaves and juices. A loud roar is heard by something off camera, and several long vine/tentacles reach towards LUAKEL. He swings the shovel at them.

 LUAKEL 
Back, hellspawn, BACK!!

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- DR. WHAT’S QUARTERS- DAY 

DR. WHAT pushes another button on the intercom.

 DR. WHAT 
FLOCC? How’s it going in the kitchen? You all right?

No answer is heard on the intercom, only the sounds of gasping for breath, several odd clanging blows, and then FLOCCULENCIO is heard screaming in the background, “THOSE EYES! THOSE EYES! THOSE HORRIBLE RED EYES!” DR. WHAT shrugs and turns off the intercom.

 DR. WHAT 
Hey, I checked.

He rubs his hands together in happiness, and goes back to his game.

 INT- INDIANNAPOLIS- OMAR’S TAVERN- NIGHT 

GREY WOLF is seen in here, sweeping the floor and wiping down tables, under the stern gaze of one of the bouncers. He looks longingly at the booze all around, but the bouncer doesn’t take his eyes off him for a second. As he works, a pair of girls poses at the bar, while their friend snaps a picture. The flash makes the bouncer blink and rub his eyes briefly. When he opens them again, he looks on in wide surprise. The camera switches to his POV, and we see that GREY WOLF has stripped down to his underwear, is dancing drunkenly on a table, holding a bottle, and singing a song horribly off key.

 GREY WOLF 
THER ISH A HOUSHE IN NEW AWLINS,
THEY CALL TH’ RISIN’ SUNNNNNN…

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- CAPTAIN’S OFFICE- NIGHT 

DR. WHAT and LANDSHARK are seated at the table again, looking over computer printouts. LANDSHARK is fast asleep, snoring on the table.

 DR. WHAT 
Hey, we’re getting there! We have enough cash now to get repairs
started tomorrow. I’ll call down and have the crews get started
first thing in the morning. One more day, and
we’ll have enough to pay it all off.

He looks down at LANDSHARK snoring, takes out a marker and draws a little Hitler mustache on his upper lip, and then leaves the room.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- PSYCHOMELTDOWN’S QUARTERS- DAWN 

PSYCHOMELTDOWN is seen sleeping sprawled on his bed, utterly unconscious.

 LEO CAESIUS

PSYYYYCHOOOOO…..

PSYCHOMELTDOWN twitches in his sleep, but doesn’t wake up.

 LEO CAESIUS 
 (soft low voice) 
PSYYYYYCHOOOOOO….

He curls up into a fetal position, but doesn’t wake up. The lights in the room blast on to full intensity, and a noise comes out of the speakers that sounds like car horns, fog horns, and steam engine whistles combined. PSYCHOMELTDOWN leaps to his feet and runs blindly across the room, slamming into the opposite wall at full speed. He knocks himself out and lands flat on his back.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Up and at ‘em, PSYCHO! We’ve got lots to do…
 (pause) 
Uh… PSYCHO?

The camera switches to a close up of PSYCHOMELTDOWN’S face. His eyes are rolled back, and he has a wide goofy grin… and is out cold.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Whoops.

 INT- TALLAHASSEE FL- OMAR’S TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAWN 

LANDSHARK is seen washing dishes. He pulls his hands out and looks at them; they are rough, red, and wrinkled. He bursts into tears.

 THANDE 
One more day…

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- HYDROPONICS BAY- DAWN 

LUAKEL is seen at the computer station, and has obviously been up all night, reprogramming the drip settings. He has the very last manual on the very last page, and looks at it blearily.

 LUAKEL 
And finally… zucchini…

He types in several commands and put the manual back on the shelf. He turns, and the camera switches angles. The room looks different; nearly all of the rampant jungle growth has disappeared, and most of the plants look like they are now growing properly. He walks over to the wheeled cart, now piled high with vegetable monster carcasses. Along with the cauliflower/sheep and carrot/tiger, there is a potato/bear, several string bean/snakes, a huge tomato with a fanged maw, and a strawberry as big as a recliner chair. LUAKEL picks up the cart handle and pulls it out of the room.

 INT- SAULT STE. MARIE- OMAR’S TURKISH DELIGHTS- DAY

Over at the drive through window, GBW is energetically handing out orders, taking cash, and thanking them. But a look of deep despair goes over his face.

DAVE HOWERY is seen talking to the WHATBOT, who has apparently been reprogrammed. KEIRA is stretched out asleep on a work table in the background.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Okay, you have all the details down, right?

 WHATBOT 
Yes, DAVE.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Then head down to the Teleportation Room and get started.

 WHATBOT 
Yes, DAVE.

The WHATBOT walks out of the room. DAVE HOWERY walks over to his desk and picks up a cup of coffee. He sees KEIRA asleep nearby, and smiles fondly down at her. He reaches down and strokes her cheek. She stirs, but doesn’t wake.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (low voice) 
Another day with you…

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- KITCHEN- DAY 

FLOCCULENCIO is seen moving warily around, facing off against two of the giant rats, apparently all that remains. He looks gaunt and weary, but very alert. One of the rats charges him, and he slams the griddle down on its head, killing it instantly. The other rat darts forward and sinks its teeth into the pot lid; FLOCCULENCIO barely hangs onto it. He lashes out with the griddle and drops the other rat. He stands upright and howls in wordless victory.

At that moment, the door opens and LUAKEL enters, pulling the cart behind him. He looks first at FLOCCULENCIO (still with the pot on his head, pot lid in one hand, and griddle in the other) , and then at all the dead giant rats scattered around the room. He opens his mouth to ask a question, but then just shakes his head.

 LUAKEL 
No. I’m not going to ask. Here’s dinner.

He drops the cart handle and walks out of the room. FLOCCULENCIO looks at the vegetable monsters in the cart, clearly puzzled.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
What the hell is all this?

 EXT- BOSTON- DAY 

The camera opens on a scene inside the armored truck driven by the guard; MATT is still on the passenger side.

 MATT 
God, this has been boring.
No robbery attempts, nothing.
One more day…

 GUARD 
Hey, around here, we regard a day with no
robbery attempts as a good one… what the hell?!

He slams on the brakes, bringing the truck to a screeching halt.

 GUARD 
I swear, he just appeared there out of thin air!

 MATT 
Uh… DOC?

The camera switches to a scene outside the truck. The WHATBOT is standing there in the middle of the road. As the two guards look on in puzzlement, the WHATBOT grabs the front of the truck and turns it over. It falls on its side with a thunderous crash. The WHATBOT walks around to the back of the truck. As it does, we see MATT pull himself up out of the cab through the side window, looking rather battered. The WHATBOT tears one of the doors off of its hinges, seizes two bags of money, and then goes running off down the street at an impossible speed. The guard and MATT barely get on their feet and draw their guns when the robot runs out of sight.

 GUARD 
You know what this means, don’t you?
Lots and lots of paperwork.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- DINING HALL- NIGHT 

Nearly the entire crew is assembled in here. Only MATT and DAVE HOWERY are absent. The crew looks tired, but happy. The table has been filled with a great feast… piles and piles of food, drink, and deserts. DR. WHAT stands and raises his glass.

 DR. WHAT 
To all of you! You came through when things looked bad,
and got the job done, as you always do!

Everyone raises their glasses and cheers. DR. WHAT turns to PSYCHOMELTDOWN, who has a bandage around his head and looks confused.

 DR. WHAT 
And to the man who got everything done in Engineering,
so the repair crews were able to fix everything in just a few hours!

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
I’m an engineer?

Of course… you all right, PSYCHO?

And to LUAKEL, who did a great job in Hydroponics
and grew all this great feast for us!

 HENDRYK 
It is great… but why isn’t there any broccoli?

Everyone goes quiet as LUAKEL looks up with a murderous expression.

 LUAKEL 
Broccoli? BROCCOLI?!?! You want some goddamn broccoli?!
After all I went through while you guys were having a grand old
time doing light work down there, all you can do is whine about broccoli?!
AHHHHHHH!!!

LUAKEL jumps to his feet, knocks over a bowl of gravy, kicks MICHAEL in the leg, and runs out of the room, sobbing and crying.

 MICHAEL 
Ow!

 DR. WHAT 
Shouldn’t have gone there, HENDRYK. Anyway… let’s hear it
for FLOCCULENCIO, who cleaned up the kitchen and cooked this feast!

Everyone cheers, but then OTHNIEL suddenly coughs and sputters. He picks up a long pink tail out of his soup bowl.

 OTHNIEL 
What the… I thought you cleaned these dishes!

Everyone quiets as FLOCCULENCIO looks up with a murderous expression.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
A tail?! You’re whining about a stupid tail?! After
I cleaned all the dishes that you bozos left dirty for
months and fought a horde of giant rats with a damn
griddle, all you can do is whine about a little tail in your soup?!
AHHHHHHHHH!!

FLOCCULENCIO leaps to his feet, knocks over another bowl of gravy, kicks MICHAEL in the leg, and runs out of the room, sobbing and crying.

 MICHAEL 
OW!! 

 DR. WHAT 
Oh boy. Well, in the end, we got it done anyway. After
a good night’s sleep, tomorrow, we’re out of here!

Everyone cheers loud and long at that. DR. WHAT sits back down.

 DR. WHAT 
By the way, LANDSHARK, did we have any
cash left over after paying for the repairs?

 LANDSHARK 
 (pulls out a PDA unit) 
Not much. I think it was about $50 or so…

The PDA makes a beep, and LANDSHARK looks down at it with wide eyes.

 LANDSHARK 
What… the… hell?!? It says here that a deposit of
$328,000 was made just before the bank closed!

The entire room goes quiet in shock.

 DR. WHAT 
But… how…
 (pause) 
Who made the deposit?

 LANDSHARK 
It says you did.

 DR. WHAT 
But that’s impossible! I haven’t been off the ship in days!

 G BONE 
Uh… yes, you were, DOC. I teleported you to the
surface this afternoon, and you came back just after 5:00.

 DR. WHAT 
No I didn’t. What the hell is going on here?

DAVE HOWERY bursts into the room, looking worried.

 DAVE HOWERY 
I hate to interrupt the feast, but everyone needs to get
to stations immediately. The planet is sending warships after us!

 DR .WHAT 
What… why?! We paid for the repairs! We did everything
legal and honest this time, and we hardly ever do that!

MATT walks into the room, glaring at DAVE HOWERY.

 MATT 
I bet I can guess why. I just came out of 2 hours of
interrogation by the security company. That was really
unpleasant. Anything you want to tell us, DAVE?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Me? I didn’t do anything!

In spite of this statement, DAVE HOWERY has an obviously guilty look on his face. The rest of the crew looks at him with suspicion.

 DR. WHAT 
DAVE… what did you DO?!

 DAVE HOWERY 
Nothing, MATT’S crazy, I… oh all right, I’ll tell you,
but we need to get to stations right away.

Everyone jumps to their feet and runs out of the room.

 EXT- SPACE 

The AH.COM is seen rocketing through space, towards a wormhole forming just ahead of it, as a pair of smaller spacecraft chase it, firing weapons. Just before the ship moves into the wormhole, the voice of the entire crew (except DAVE HOWERY) is heard yelling on a voice over.

 CREW 
DAVE, YOU IDIOT!!!

 TEASER 

 EXT. – STREET – HUB – DAYISH 

DOCTOR WHAT and the AH.COM CREW are all walking down the sidewalk. GREY WOLF is looking at a device in his hands.

 GREY WOLF 
I think this is the place.

WEAPON M pulls outs a BFG.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I don’t think we’ll be needing that.

 WEAPON M 
You’re never sure.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
No, I think we’re not going to need it.

Pull back and we see a large glowing and glittering sign:

 HUB CINEMAS:
10,000,000 SCREENS SHOWING UP TO
75 VERSIONS OF THE SAME MOVIE!!! 

 FLOCCULENCIO 
I’m not sure about this.

 MICHAEL 
Movie Night?
It’s supposed to bring
the crew together.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Why not just take us to a strip club?
That’ll work better than all sitting in a cinema.

 MICHAEL 
You know what happened last time.

 MATT 
Hey! I was drunk and uncoordinated.

 MICHAEL 
I was talking more about
the two dollars in pennies.

 MATT 
Oh, right. Well…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (waving) 
Alright, boys and girls.
We got the tickets, no pushing,
no shouting, no biting, and Sharky,
definitely no shin kicking.

 LANDSHARK 
Bugger.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Wait, what are we going to watch?

 MICHAEL 
Dunno.
Keira was supposed to pick the movie.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Mate, I have a bad feeling about this.

 TWO HOURS LATER 

The AH.COM CREW exit the movie theatre. We pull in on them, we see their faces pale and a few of them shaking.

 MICHAEL 
Oh, god. Oh, god.
Oh, god. Oh, god.
 (shuddering) 

 FLOCCULENCIO 
My mind…
I don’t…
Oh, god…

DOCTOR WHAT and GREY WOLF watch as the crew file pass. We see KEIRA KNIGHTLY leading a stunned looking DAVE HOWERY by the hand.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Successful?

 GREY WOLF 
I don’t think I understood the plot.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
That happens when you fall asleep before it even begins.
Anyway. I think I’m crossing independent films from
a Cucuteni dominated worlds off my list of things to see.
Ye gods, I think what they did with the hedgehogs and
olive oil is going to haunt me for the next week.

 GREY WOLF 
I think I’ll wait until it arrives on video.

The two follow the crew.

 AH.COM: The Series 

 “SPA DAY” 

 Written By : PSYCHOMELTDOWN 

 ACT I 

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – TELEPORTATION TUBE ROOM – DAY 

DAVE HOWERY, KEIRA KNIGHTLY, and IRONYUPPIE are standing in the room. G.BONE is sleeping with his head on his arms, on the control panel for the Teleportation Tubes.

 DAVE HOWERY 
I don’t know about this.
I mean you going off all by your lonesome.

 KEIRA KNIGHTLY 
I’m not going off by my lonesome.
Ironyuppie’s coming with me.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (eyes IY) 
Yeah, that’s also something worrying me.

 IRONYUPPIE 
Come on, Dave. You can’t keep he
r locked up in your quarters
all the time. It makes you look sad
and creepy, and seeing as you’re
already that, it just makes it more so.
People are talking and not the usual
behind your back kind of talking either.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (un-amused) 
Har-dee-friggin-har.

 IRONYUPPIE 
Plus, y’know, a girl’s got needs.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (eyeing IY) 
Now, I’m doubly worried.

 IRONYUPPIE 
Dude, I’ve got the same girl bits
she does. You think I’m after them?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Tell me you aren’t.

 IRONYUPPIE 
I’m not going to lie to you.
 (long pause) 

 KEIRA KNIGHTLY 
It’s only for a couple of hours.
What possibly could happen
at a day spa?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Keira, honey, darling dear, love of my life.
You really should never ask that kind of question.
The universe has a way of making you regret it.

 INT. – HUB – PUB – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT and GREY WOLF enter the Pub.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well, that was another
splendid mission we survived.

 GREY WOLF 
Ya, but I think Michael’s
gonna be sore for a month.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
A shame about that. But then again,
you know the saying.

 GREY WOLF 
You mess with the seven-ton
mutant rhino elephant dinosaur
and you get the horn/tusk/talon
thing up the backside?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Something like that…
Come, I’ll buy you a drink.

 GREY WOLF 
I need something that’ll burn in a good way.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Right, gutrot coming right up.

 INT. – DARKEN ROOM – DAY 

A MAN IN A MASK sits at a table. ANOTHER MAN IN A MASK arrives and sits across from him.

 MAN IN A MASK 
You got the stuff?

 OTHER MAN IN A MASK 
I got the stuff.

 MAN IN A MASK 
Then give me the stuff.

 OTHER MAN IN A MASK 
I’ll give you the stuff.

 MAN IN A MASK 
Quit repeating things I say, boy.

 OTHER MAN IN A MASK 
Quit repeating things I say.

 MAN IN A MASK 
I’m annoyed.
If you got the stuff, then give it
and you’ll get your money.
If you don’t, then fuck off and die.

 OTHER MAN IN A MASK 
Fine. Fine. Geez, are you always this grumpy?

 MAN IN A MASK 
Only when dealing with idiots.

 OTHER MAN IN A MASK 
Here you go, mate.
Have fun and don’t get it on your skin.
God only know why you want that.

 MAN IN A MASK 
I have my reasons.
 (evil grin) 

 OTHER MAN IN A MASK 
Yeah, yeah. Just make sure you got my money.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – MESS HALL – DAY 

DAVE HOWERY is sitting at a table, looking at a picture book. He looks a bit down.

FLOCCULENCIO and DMA enter the room.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Hey, looked what crawled
out of the Engineering Bay.

 DMA 
Looks like something you
see after eating Taco Bell.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Leave me alone.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Look it talks.

 DMA 
Aye, and it sounds like something
you hear after eating Taco Bell.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
What is your obsession with Taco Bell?

 DMA 
I’m hungry, get over it.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (sighs) 
If you’re going to be my Aussie Sidekick, now that
Michael’s incapacitated, you really have to be more
Johnny on the Spot with better barbed quips and
not be so easily distracted by bodily needs.

 DMA 
I could use a good hooker or two,
now that we’re talking about it.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (sighs) 
I need a better Aussie Sidekick.

 DAVE HOWERY 
You guys gonna leave? Or do I have to go
broken sprinkler head on your arses?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Where’s the little missus?
She finally get over her programming
and flee in terror?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Quiet you. She loves me for being me!

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Keep telling yourself that, mate.
Keep telling yourself that.

 DAVE HOWERY 
She and Yuppie went to a spa.
Without me.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Wow, you actually unchained her
from the radiator in your quarters?

 DAVE HOWERY 
She’s not chained up.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
But now that she’s gone,
I’ll wager she’s gone for good.

 DMA 
Aye, and she’s probably gettin’ felt up by
some young strapping buck right about now…

 DAVE HOWERY 
I’ll kill you!
She’d never let another man touch her!

 INT. – HUB – SPA – DAY 

KEIRA KNIGHTLY lets out a groan of pleasure.

 KEIRA KNIGHTLY 
I’ve never been touched
like that by a man before!

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – MESS HALL – DAY 

DAVE HOWERY and DMA are grappling on the floor as FLOCCULENCIO idly watches.

THANDE suddenly bursts into the room.

 THANDE 
Keira is gone!
Where did she go!

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Hey, look what crawled out of the air ducts
leading to Dave and Keira’s quarters.

 THANDE 
Its nearly nine, that’s her shower time.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Is anyone else completely
creeped out by that statement?

 DMA 
Aye, I’m a bit.

 DAVE HOWERY 
She’s gone off the ship!
Okay? Got it? Understand!
She’ll be back though.
 (panting) 
She will…

 FLOCCULENCIO 
A sane person would merely nod
and agree with you, right now.
 (looks at DMA) 
Aussie Sidekick?

 DMA 
 (to Dave) 
No she’s not coming back.

DAVE HOWERY launches himself at DMA.

 INT. – HUB – PUB – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT is very sloshed, GREY WOLF sips at his mason jar, unaffected.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
So I said to him,
That’s not a tail, buddy.

 GREY WOLF 
Not to get your hopes up, Doc.
But I think there’s an attractive
girl eyeing you from afar.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
A what?

 GREY WOLF 
An attractive girl.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
You sure?
Because that usually doesn’t ever happen.

 GREY WOLF 
I know.
I’m baffled.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well, point me in her general direction
and shove me off in that direction.

GREY WOLF points DOCTOR WHAT in the direction and pushes him. He staggers toward a young woman sitting at the bar, a welcoming smile on her face.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Hey…
I’m Doc.
What are you?

 GIRL 
Nice to meet you Doc…
My name is StrategyGirl.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP–TELEPORTATION TUBE ROOM – DAY 

There’s a loud pop and a large container appears upon the Teleportation Tubes.

G.BONE looks at in confusion.

He hits the comm button.

 G.BONE 
Hey, did anyone order anything?

 HENDRYK 
Nope. Why?

 G.BONE 
I just got a package in. Says its
addressed to the Crew of the AH.com.

 HENDRYK 
Open it up.

 G.BONE 
Nope. I’m not falling for that again.

 HENDRYK 
Come on.

 G.BONE 
After what happened last time?
No.

PSYCHOMELTDOWN enters the Teleportation Tube Room.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Yo, you seen my tub of Crisco?

 G.BONE 
Hey, Psycho. Mind opening that crate?

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
You got my tub of Crisco?

 G.BONE 
I’ll give you one, if you open that crate.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Woot.
 (opens crate) 
Hey, cool!

G.BONE rises up from where he was crouching behind the control console.

 G.BONE 
No exploding hamsters?
No tentacle monsters wanting
to have sex with people?
No kumquats?

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Nope. Just a load of porn.
A lot of porn.

G.BONE looks around.

 G.BONE 
Hey, what’s that rumbling sound.
It sounds like a stampede…

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – ENGINEERING BAY – DAY 

DAVE HOWERY sits tinkering with the engine.

THANDE walks in carrying a large cardboard thing.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (looks up) 
What do you want?

 THANDE 
And a happy day to you, arsehat.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Look. Can’t you guys just leave me alone?

 THANDE 
So you can mope about and sob by yourself?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Yes.

 THANDE 
There’s a big shipment of porn that just came in.
Why don’t you take a few?

 DAVE HOWERY 
I’m not interested.

 THANDE 
 (stares) 
What has happened to you?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Get out of here.

 THANDE 
It’s a good thing then, that I came to bring you this.

THANDE stands the cardboard thing before DAVE HOWERY. We see it’s a cut out of KEIRA KNIGHTLY.

 DAVE HOWERY 
What the fuck is that?

 THANDE 
There are times when a man gets lonely.
And he just has to be reminded of things.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Where the fuck did you get that?

 THANDE 
 (grinning) 
Made it meself.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (glaring) 
Why are there spots worn thin?

 THANDE 
 (nervous laugh) 
Uh… right.
 (cocks head) 
What’s that? I’m needed in the Chem Lab?
 (to Dave) 
Sorry, mate. I have to go. Needed and whatnot.

THANDE quickly leaves the Engineering Bay.

DAVE HOWERY looks at the card board cutout.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Damn crew.
This is why I chain Keira
to the radiator in my quarters.

 INT. – CORRIDOR – DAY 

PSYCHOMELTDOWN and DIAMOND are carrying large armfuls of porn.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Dude, I’m so gonna look at all theses… tonight.

 DIAMOND 
Screw that. I’m looking at them right now.
 (dumps porn) 
Oooo.. Yeah…

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (uncomfortable) 
You know you’re not wearing pants, right?

 DIAMOND 
Hell yes I do.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (about to throw up) 
I’m so outta here.
 (flees) 

 DIAMOND 
 (opening magazine) 
Daddy like….

 INT. – ENGINEERING BAY – DAY 

DAVE HOWERY paces in front of the cardboard cut out.

 DAVE HOWERY 
This is stupid. This is very stupid.
I should just throw you in the trash.
 (stares at cutout) 
I really should.
 (shakes head) 
No. that would be wrong. I can’t do that.
Not to you. Never to you.
 (growls) 
Stupid Thande and his perverted ways.
Why would he make a cutout of you?
Because he’s a pervert that’s why.
They all are.
I can see their lusting eyes.
I can see them nudging and winking at one another.
This is why I never brought a girl to the ship before.
Because I’ve had other girls, non programmed to love me girls.
I know how these asshats are. They swarm everything
that’s good and make it sick and wrong.
See what just happened now? A shipment of porn comes in
and like a plague of locust they swarm all over it. Picking it clean
and scurrying off to their respective hidey holes to beat themselves
to a pulp. What kind of people do that? Bad people. That’s what kind.
Evil creepy dirty people. People who corrupt everything they touch.
Its like I’m the only sane person here, the one who sees everything so clearly.
 (pauses, taking breath) 
You know what I’m talking about right?

DAVE HOWERY stares at the cardboard cutout.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Yes, you’re the only one that understands me. You’re
the only one who can see with clear eyes. You see what
kind of perverts they are. You see what they’re doing.
Disgusting.
 (stares afar) 
Something needs to be done.
Something…

 CARDBOARD CUTOUT 
You know what needs to be done, Dave.

DAVE HOWERY stares at the cardboard cutout.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Wha…
 (blinks then nods) 
I know what I have to do.
I have to kill the crew.

 CARDBOARD CUTOUT 
Only you can do it, Dave.

 END ACT I 

 ACT II 

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – MED BAY – DAY 

BOBO floats across the screen, emitting a low humming noise. TORQUMADA can be seen behind a large glass window, a large blood splattered window. His back is turned and we can see something ungodly twitching on the examining table.

The Med Bay door whisks open and PSYCHOMELTDOWN staggers in. He looks confused and has his hands before him.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Torq!
Dude, you here?

 TORQUMADA 
 (sighs) 
What do you want, Psycho.
I’m kinda busy.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
I got me a problem.

 TORQUMADA 
I told you, I can’t fix ugly.
You’re stuck that way.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
No, Torq. I got me a different problem.

 TORQUMADA 
I told you, I can’t fix size.
You’re stuck that way

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
No, Torq.
I seem to be blinded.

Pull in on PSYCHOMELTDOWN and we see his eyes are milked over.

 INT. – HUB – PUT – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT leans close to STRATEGYGIRL, breathing heavily.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
So what’s a girl like you doing in a place like this?

 STRATEGYGIRL 
Looking for a guy like you.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grinning foolishly) 
Really?
Normally girls are looking for
the opposite of guys like me.

 STRATEGYGIRL 
Oh, but I like guys like you.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
You’re pretty.
Did I tell you that?

 STRATEGYGIRL 
A girl can’t be told enough.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Too pretty…
I mean, I’ve seen pretty. But you…
Too pretty. Suspiciously pretty.

 STRATEGYGIRL 
Now that’s something girls don’t like to hear.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
No, no. It’s just… I’ve never seen your kind of pretty here.
Its like… its like… too pretty to be here kind of pretty.
Makes a guy who’s had about zero
experience with women kinda suspicious.

 STRATEGYGIRL 
I am what I am.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I like you.
Can I have sex with you?

 STRATEGYGIRL 
Who knows what the future holds.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grins foolishly) 
I have s ship. A big ship.

 STRATEGYGIRL 
I’ll have to see that.
 (smiles) 

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CORRIDOR – DAY 

KIT walks down the corridor, a towel over his shoulder and wearing a speedo and flip flops.

 KIT 
 (whistling) 
oh, he’ll be coming around the mountain,
when he comes.
He’ll be coming about the mountain,
When he comes.

There’s a revving sound.

KIT stops and looks over his shoulder.

Nothing.

 KIT 
 (shrugs) 
Oh, he’ll be coming around the mountain,
when he comes.

He stops again. Looking over his shoulder.

 KIT 
Honestly, what is that noise?

He turns and faces DAVE HOWERY.

 KIT 
Dave? What’s wrong? You got that
crazy woodsman look in your eyes.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Pervert.

 KIT 
 (shrugs) 
We all have our faults.
You just gotta accept it.

 DAVE HOWERY 
PERVERT!!!!!
YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH MY KEIRA!!!!

 KIT 
With a woman? Are you serious?

DAVE HOWERY pulls out a chain saw, it roars to life.

KIT begins screaming.

Fade out:

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CONTROL ROOM – DAY 

LANDSHARK is sitting in the command chair, reading a magazine.

The comm unit chimes. He looks at it and shakes his head, returning to reading.

The comm unit chimes again.

He sighs and hits a button.

 LANDSHARK 
What?

 TORQUMADA 
Landshark. I think we have a problem.

 LANDSHARK 
I told you, its going to cost you double if you
want me to dispose of one of your creations again.
The last time it nearly bit my leg off.

 TORQUMADA 
No, not that. We can talk about that one later.
Right now, I think we have a medical emergency.

 LANDSHARK 
What kind.

 TORQUMADA 
 (dramatic pause) 
The Crew has gone BLIND!

 LANDSHARK 
 (unimpressed) 
So?

 TORQUMADA 
This qualifies as a medical emergency

 LANDSHARK 
I’m not blind.
By the looks of it, you’re not too.
So the whole crew isn’t affected.

 TORQUMADA 
Yes, but a large majority of the crew is.

 LANDSHARK 
 (sighing) 
what do you want me to do about it?

 TORQUMADA 
You’re technically in charge aren’t you?
Since Doc, Grey, and IronYuppie are off the ship.

 LANDSHARK 
Yuppie isn’t in the chain of command.

 TORQUMADA 
Come on, Landshark.
Lets be honest here.

 LANDSHARK 
I’m hanging up on you.

 TORQUMADA 
But we need to –

The comm unit dies.

 LANDSHARK 
Torq? You there?
Hello? Hello?
 (growls) 
You hung up on ME????

Suddenly the hatch to the Control Room is thrown open and Kit jumps in. He slams the hatch close and locks it.

LANDSHARK rises from the command chair.

 LANDSHARK 
Now what the bloody hell is going on here.
 (looks at Kit) 
Gods above, Kit. Put on some pants.

 KIT 
Dave!
He’s gone crazy!

 LANDSHARK 
Tell me something I don’t know.

 KIT 
He’s trying to kill me.

 LANDSHARK 
At this moment, if I had a weapon,
I’d be trying to do that same too.
Jebus, why are you wearing a speedo?

 KIT 
I was going to the pool.

 LANDSHARK 
We have a pool?

 KIT 
Focus, Landshark.
Dave’s gone absolutely nutters.
He thinks I’m trying to sleep with Keira.
I don’t even like girls!

 LANDSHARK 
 (scratching head) 
Yeah, even bat shit insane Dave knows you’re the
only one not looking to shag his fake woman.
 (sighs) 
I guess I’m gonna have to call Doc.
 (hits comm unit, nothing happens) 
The hell?

 KIT 
The comm units are all dead.
He cut the cables and destroyed
the machinery as I ran from him.

 LANDSHARK 
Well, isn’t that bloody convenient.

Suddenly a roaring sound fills the room. Sparks begin to fly from the hatch.

 KIT 
I think he’s trying to cut his way in!

 LANDSHARK 
Hey, Dave! Kit’s not trying to sleep with Keira!

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (from behind the hatch) 
I’ll kill you both!
I’ll kill you both.

 LANDSHARK 
Now, I’m included in this?
What the fuck?

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (from beyond the hatch) 
I’ll kill you both!
I’ll kill you both!

The hatch falls from its hinges in a shower of sparks.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (screaming) 
I’ll kill you both!
I’ll kill you all!!!

LANDSHARK and KIT flee through the side hatch.

 LANDSHARK 
Great, just fucking great.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CORRIDOR – DAY 

MOSQUITO is leading a group of people HENDRYK, G.BONE, and GBW.

 MOSQUITO 
So, what happened to you guys?

 GBW 
We went blind. It seems.

 MOSQUITO 
This happens often?

 GBW 
About never.

 MOSQUITO 
Dude, that sucks.

 G.BONE 
I know.
I was just getting into the Big Jugs catalog.

 HENDRYK 
And how I was enjoying the tentacle porn mag.

 MOSQUITO 
How about you, GBW.
What were you enjoying.

 GBW 
None of your business.

 G.BONE 
I think he took the Manlove Illustrated mag.

 GBW 
You shut your filthy mouth.

There’s suddenly a revving sound.

 G.BONE 
Uh.. what was that?

 MOSQUITO 
I think someone’s revving a chain saw.

 GBW 
Dave?
You out there?

 DAVE HOWERY 
I’ll kill you all!
I’ll kill you all!
You’re trying to seduce my Keira!!!

 MOSQUITO 
Dude, I’m not.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (pauses) 
Nah, you’re cool Mosquito.
I know you’re not after her.
But these guys.. these guys…
I’ll kill you all!!!!

The three begin screaming.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – ANOTHER CORRIDOR – DAY 

LANDSHARK and KIT are walking down the corridor.

 LANDSHARK 
You can stop holding my hand now.

 KIT 
Oh, right.

 LANDSHARK 
What the bloody hell is going on anyway?
Torq says everyone’s gone blind.
 (suspiciously) 
Why aren’t you blind?

 KIT 
Me? I don’t know.

 LANDSHARK 
 (touches wall panel) 
Leo? Leo, you there?

 KIT 
He’s offline, it seems.
Dave did it, before he went bonkers.

 LANDSHARK 
Give it to the raving lunatic to turn off the
main computer, before he tries killing everyone.

 KIT 
He scares me.

 LANDSHARK 
Yeah, when you don’t shave for
years on end, that tends to happen.

Suddenly MOSQUITO, G.BONE, GBW, and HENDRYK stumble into the corridor.

MOSQUITO looks shaken.

 MOSQUITO 
I think I killed him.
There was so much blood.

 LANDSHARK 
 (grabbing hold of Mosquito) 
What happened?

 GBW 
Dave tried killing us.
He said we were trying to sleep with Keira.

 G.BONE 
Guy’s nutters!

 KIT 
I know, right!

 HENDRYK 
He was raving and revving his chainsaw
and I think Mosquito attacked him.

 MOSQUITO 
There was so much blood.
 (looks ill) 

LANDSHARK slaps MOSQUITO.

 LANDSHARK 
Get a hold of yourself, man…bug thing.
Tell me what happened.

 MOSQUITO 
Dave attacked the others, then I hit him.
He fell over and hit his head…there was so much blood.
 (begins sobbing) 

 LANDSHARK 
so he hit his head?
That should-

A revving sound begins.

 LANDSHARK 
Aw, bugger. A little hit isn’t going to stop him.

 KIT 
He’s coming! Run!

The six flee.

 INT. CORRIDOR – DAY 

DAVE HOWERY is pacing around.

 DAVE HOWERY 
I can’t kill them all if they keep running away.
I need to trap them somehow.
I need to gather them all together.
Yes, that’s what I’ll do.
I need to gather them together.
 (begins laughing insanely) 
They’ll not touch you, Keira.
They’ll never touch you.

We see the cardboard cutout strapped to DAVE’s back.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Need to get them together.

 CARDBOARD CUTOUT 
You know what you have to do, Dave…

 INT. – MED BAY – DAY 

LANDSHARK, KIT, MOSQUITO, GBW, G.BONE, and HENDRYK stumble into the Med Bay. TORQUMADA looks up from where he’s examining DIAMOND. On the other beds are the rest of the crew, all blinded and moaning.

 TORQUMADA 
And that makes everyone. I can’t
get a hold of Doc, Grey, Oth, or Lee.

 LANDSHARK 
Yes, comm’s dead. Computer’s off.
Doc and Grey are off the ship.

 TORQUMADA 
What the hell are we going to do?

 LANDSHARK 
Dave’s gone bat shit crazy again.
Something about people trying to sleep with Keira.

 TORQUMADA 
What else is new?

 LANDSHARK 
He’s trying to kill everyone.

 TORQUMADA 
Well…

 LANDSHARK 
What’s the status?

 TORQUMADA 
Everyone seems to be blind.
I’m not sure why. It’s getting
progressively worse, in any case.

 LANDSHARK 
They’re getting more blind?

 TORQUMADA 
No, it seems their eyeballs are atrophying.
In a few hours they’ll be useless.

 LANDSHARK 
Well, you can grow new ones, right?

 TORQUMADA 
No.

 LANDSHARK 
Shit. What can we do to reverse it?

 TORQUMADA 
Not everything can be reversed.

 LANDSHARK 
Of course it can. There isn’t a disease,
virus, or STD we’ve not miraculously
come up with a cure for in a few
stressed hours.

 TORQUMADA 
I don’t see how we can…

 LANDSHARK 
Now, we have to discover what caused this.
Is there anything they all shared? Partook in?

 TORQUMADA 
I’m not sure.

 G.BONE 
There was that big
shipment of porn we got in.
Everyone took some.

 KIT 
There was porn?

 G.BONE 
Mostly heterosexual porn.

 KIT 
Mostly? Where’d the
non heterosexual porn go?

 G.BONE 
GBW? You know?

 GBW 
Shut up.

 LANDSHARK 
Quiet, children.
Tell me, where is this porn located?

 G.BONE 
Everywhere, I guess.
But the container is still
in the Teleportation Tube Room.

 LANDSHARK 
We’ll need to examine that container.
It might give us some clues.

 KIT 
Playing detective now, are you?

 LANDSHARK 
Shut up, kitten. I’m thinking.

Suddenly there’s a squeal as the comm unit comes on.

 VOICE 
Hi, everyone. This is Leo,
I’m back online.

 KIT 
Leo? You sound funny.

 VOICE 
I had to reroute my vocal
processors through a few
different circuits. So its
making me sound funny.

 KIT 
You sound like Dave
trying to sound like Leo.

 VOICE 
Now, why would I do that?

 KIT 
Dunno, but its creeping me out.

 LANDSHARK 
Leo. Can you contact Doc
or Grey or Oth or Lee?

 VOICE 
Sorry, no outside communications.
Dave really did a number on them.
He’s so awesome and knows all about how to cripple
the ship easily. It only took him five minutes.
He’s super awesome.

 KIT 
Leo?

 VOICE 
You all need to come to the mess hall.
I can teleport you all off the ship in the mess hall.

 LANDSHARK 
This is giving me that not right
feeling in my bowels.

 KIT 
Can’t you just teleport us all out of the-

 LANDSHARK 
Kit no!

 KIT 
 (cont) 
med bay. We’re all in the med bay.

 LANDSHARK 
Bugger.

 VOICE 
Med Bay, eh? You’re all in the med bay.
And I was looking to gather you all up in the Mess Hall.
Everyone sit tight, I’ll be right there.

 KIT 
How can you come here, I thought
you were still in the ship’s computers…

 LANDSHARK 
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

 KIT 
What?

 LANDSHARK 
That wasn’t Leo. That was Dave
pretending to be Leo. Now you’ve
just gone and told him where we all are.

 KIT 
So?
What is he going to do?

Suddenly the door to the Med Bay begins sparking and the roar of a chainsaw can be heard from outside.

 LANDSHARK 
Bugger.

 TORQUMADA 
What are we going to do? That door can’t
hold him. Not in his bat shit crazy state.

 LANDSHARK 
We need to cure the crew and
we need to get Keira back onto the ship.

 KIT 
What’s Keira going to do?

 LANDSHARK 
Dave went bat shit crazy
when Keira left.
What do you think?

 KIT 
Oh… right.
Jesus, talk about issues.

 TORQUMADA 
Get me a sample of the porn; I’ll see if I can identify
any contaminates on it that caused this blindness.

 LANDSHARK 
Kit. You get a sample of that container.
I’ll get Dave’s attention.

 KIT 
Oh, huzzah. I get to get porn.

 TORQUMADA 
Just don’t touch it. Here wear these gloves.

 LANDSHARK 
Right.
On the count of three. We make our escape.

 INT. – CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MED BAY – DAY 

KIT and LANDSHARK duck out through a side door.

 LANDSHARK 
Now you run. I’ll get his attention.

 KIT 
How?

 LANDSHARK 
Leave that to me.

KIT races off down the corridor.

DAVE HOWERY is being showered with sparks as he cuts through the med bay door.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Kill you all.
Kill you all.

 LANDSHARK 
Hey, Dave!

DAVE HOWERY doesn’t hear him.

 LANDSHARK 
Oi! Asshat!

DAVE HOWERY still doesn’t hear him.

 LANDSHARK 
I slept with Keira!
And she loved every moment of it!
Said she’d never been satisfied like that before!
I did such unholy things to her!
I even-

The buzzing of the chainsaw has stopped and DAVE HOWERY stares at LANDSHARK, a look of pure hatred in his face.

 LANDSHARK 
Aw, fuck.

LANDSHARK turns and runs.

 EXT – HUB – OUTSIDE HOTEL – DAY 

STRATEGYGIRL and DOCTOR WHAT are standing out side the door.

 STRATEGYGIRL 
So, this is me.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Right.

 STRATEGYGIRL 
You want to come up?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
For coffee?

 STRATEGYGIRL 
No. Just sex.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (stunned) 
Huh?
 (suspicious) 
You want to have sex with me?

 STRATEGYGIRL 
Why do you keep sounding so suspicious?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
You’re so pretty..
It’s just.. unnatural.

 STRATEGYGIRL 
So you coming up or not?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
You need not ask me twice.

DOCTOR WHAT races for the Hotel door, already pulling off his shirt.

 INT. – CORRIDOR – DAY 

LANDSHARK turns a corner and runs into OHTNIEL.

 LANDSHARK 
Oth! What the fuck are you-
Hey, you’re not blind!

 OTHNIEL 
What? What’s going on?
What do you mean blind?

 LANDSHARK 
Everyone on the ship is blind.
Dave has gone rat in a tin shithouse crazy again.

 OTHNIEL 
That would explain all the screaming that disrupted
my early early morning, early morning, morning,
mid morning, late mid morning, early afternoon,
afternoon, mid afternoon, late afternoon prayers.

 LANDSHARK 
Yes. Now Dave’s chasing me, Kit’s gone to the
Teleportation Room to find out what caused this.
It seems a container of porn arrived and somehow
infected the crew with blindness.

 OTHNIEL 
It’s the unholy touching they do when they gaze
upon the unclothed flesh of women.
This is God’s will.

 LANDSHARK 
Right. Right.
What I need you to do is get off the ship and
go find Keira at the spa she and Yuppie went to.
We need her back, she’s the only one that’ll calm down Dave.

 OTHNIEL 
I suppose.

 LANDSHARK 
Unless you want to be Dave bait?

 OTHNIEL 
No, I’ll go.

OTHNIEL hurries off.

 INT. – CORRIDOR – DAY 

DAVE HOWERY stops and pants, leaning against a bulkhead.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Fast, for a Englishman.
He said such horrible things. He needs to die.
I have to kill him.
He said such horrible things.

DAVE HOWERY rises up and staggers down the corridor.

 CARDBOARD CUTOUT 
You know what you have to do, Dave.
Only you can do it, Dave.

 INT. – TELEPORTATION ROOM – DAY 

LANDSHARK bursts into the room.

 LANDSHARK 
Damn it, Kit. What’s taking so bloody long.

There’s a whimpering sound and KIT sits in the corner, head buried in his knees.

 LANDSHARK 
What the hell are you doing?

KIT looks up and we see his eyes are milked over.

 LANDSHARK 
AW, BLOODY FUCKING HELL!
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!!!

 KIT 
I couldn’t help myself. There was this
GQ ad on the second page and…

 LANDSHARK 
Bloody hell!
Give me your gloves!

 INT. – CORRIDOR – DAY 

LANDSHARK and KIT exit the Teleportation Room. LANDSHARK is carrying a piece of the container wrapped in plastic and held with the gloves.

Suddenly the revving of the chainsaw can be heard.

 DAVE HOWERY 
LANDSHARK!!!!!

 LANDSHARK 
Aw, crap.

 KIT 
He’s coming!
He’s coming!

 LANDSHARK 
Shut up and he won’t hear you.
We just keep going.

They scurry down the corridor, the sound of the chainsaw stalking them.

 LANDSHARK 
We’re almost there.

Suddenly DAVE HOWERY jumps in front of them.

 DAVE HOWERY 
I’ll kill you all!

 LANDSHARK 
Run!

KIT runs and slams into the bulkhead, knocking himself out.

 LANDSHARK 
Fuck

LANDSHARK drops the container and strips off the gloves.

 LANDSHARK 
Now, its you and me, colonial wanker.
A fight to the death.
And I meant everything I said about Keira.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (screaming) 
I’ll kill you!

He charges.

LANDSHARK dodges the first wild sweep of the chainsaw, slugging DAVE HOWERY in the stomach. He’s rewarded with a grunt of pain, but gets backhanded by DAVE. LANDSHARK goes flying, bouncing off the bulkhead and collapsing on the deck.

 LANDSHARK 
Shit.

He gets back up.

 LANDSHARK 
That all you got?

 DAVE HOWERY 
I’ll kill you!!!!

DAVE HOWERY charges again. LANDSHARK dodges the wild swing again, rolling to his feet behind DAVE, who slashes his chainsaw into the bulkhead. Its stuck there and he tries pulling it free.

LANDSHARK runs up and kicks DAVE in the crotch, which causes him to emit a low pitch squeal of pain, but not let go of the chainsaw. Instead DAVE kicks back, connecting with LANDSHARK’s stomach and sending the man flying away from him.

 LANDSHARK 
Aw, hell.

 DAVE HOWERY 
I’ll just kill you the old fashioned way.

DAVE HOWERY releases his chainsaw and grabs LANDSHARK by the neck.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Die! DIE! DIEEEE!!!!

LANDSHARK gropes for a weapon, he grabs KIT’s flip flop and begins hitting DAVE with it. To no effect. His attempts go weaker and weaker.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Die! Die! Di-

Suddenly DAVE’s eyes roll up in the back of his head and he collapses upon LANDSHARK.

 LANDSHARK 
Ow…
What the hell?

 WEAPON M 
Looked like you needed some help there, dude.

 LANDSHARK 
Where the hell have you been?
And why aren’t you blinded?

 WEAPON M 
Blinded?

 LANDSHARK 
You didn’t touch the porn did you?
Or the container it came in?

 WEAPON M 
Oh, that. Yeah, I got me a handful of it.

 LANDSHARK 
Then why aren’t you blind.

WEAPON M shrugs.

 LANDSHARK 
Everyone who touched the porn went blind.

 WEAPON M 
Guess I’m immune.
 (grins) 
I took some of the porn that came in,
got in the mood, so I went out and
picked up some chicks at the Pub,
had me some fun, and now I’m
just getting back.

 LANDSHARK 
 (pushes Dave off of him) 
No. Not immune. It just means you had
a little self-control and didn’t beat yourself
into a pulp like the rest of these stupid gits.
I suspect the blindness was not caused by the
porn itself, but by the combination of the porn
and the self-groping. What insidious mind
would come up with such a thing?

 WEAPON M 
Dude, guess they’re right.
Beat your meat and you’ll go blind.
But have sex with women of loose virtues
and morals and you’ll be fine.

 LANDSHARK 
Yeah, yeah. What the hell
are we going to do now?

 WEAPON M 
Guess we’ll have to tie up, Dave.

 LANDSHARK 
Lemme give this sample to Torq first.

The two enter the Med Bay and they see Torq sitting forlornly in a chair.

 LANDSHARK 
Torq, we got your sample.

TORQUMADA looks up and we see his eyes are milked over.

 LANDSHARK 
Aw, fucking hell!

 INT. – MAIN ENTRANCE – HUB DAY SPA – DAY 

OTHNIEL enters the day spa, out of breath. He bends over double, gasping for air.

 GREETER 
Can I help you, sir?

OTHNIEL looks up and is presented with a scantly clad woman.

His mouth opens and he doesn’t make a sound.

His eyes wander the main entrance and its filled with scantly clad men and women. His eyes about bug out.

 GREETER 
Sir?

 KEIRA KNIGHTLY 
Oth? What’s wrong?

OTHNIEL’s gaze falls upon KEIRA KNIGHTLY, who’s also scantly clad.

His mouth drops further.

Then he faints.

 INT. – HOTEL ROOM – DAY 

STRATEGYGIRL is seeing pulling on her clothes. DOCTOR WHAT is lying in the bed, curled up in a fetal position. We can see him shake and quiver every now and then.

 STRATEGYGIRL 
How you feeling?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (whimpers) 

 STRATEGYGIRL 
What? You didn’t like that?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (whimpers) 

 STRATEGYGIRL 
You can stay in the room.
It’s paid until tomorrow morning.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (whimpers) 

 STRATEGYGIRL 
Be seeing you, Doc.
 (grins) 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (begins sobbing) 

STRATEGYGIRL leaves the room, DOCTOR WHAT buries himself in the bed sheets.

 END ACT II 

 TAG 

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CAPTAIN’S READY ROOM – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT, GREY WOLF, and LANDSHARK are sitting in the room, sipping tea.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
So Dave’s under control now?

 LANDSHARK 
Yeah, once Keira got back onboard he settled down.
Apologized for nearly killing everyone.

 GREY WOLF 
 (laughs) 
Some people are just down right strange.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well, glad to see no one got hurt.

 GREY WOLF 
Torq says in about two days everyone will get their vision back.
Thande claimed it was similar to the combination of chemicals
that turned that one world we visited blind.
Just a more sophisticated version. Torq whipped
up a cure and the crew’ll be back to their usual in a few days.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
And the porn?

 GREY WOLF 
Oth gleefully burned it all.
Then strangely went blind afterward.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (shakes head) 
Anyone taking claim for this little misadventure?

 GREY WOLF 
Nope.
All’s quiet.

 LANDSHARK 
Maybe it’s just a wonky accident.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Porn laced with a blindness chemical
delivered randomly to our ship?
I think not.
There’s an insidious evil mind working here.

 GREY WOLF 
So how did your little romp go?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Romp?

 GREY WOLF 
I say you heading off with the attractive young woman.
And you didn’t come in until this morning.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (shivers) 
She didn’t turn out to be what she appeared to be…

 LANDSHARK 
What? Was she a man?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (shudders) 
No. something worse.

 INT. – HUB – PUB – DAY 

WARD and GRIMM REAPER sit at a table. A figure sits before them, the chemical burned MIRROR THANDE.

 WARD 
You said the blindness was permanent.

 MIRROR THANDE 
What can I say? My counterparts can whip up miracle cures.
We’re all geniuses like that.

 WARD 
I’m only giving you half.

 MIRROR THANDE 
Whatever. Just give me my money.

GRIMM REAPER slides a briefcase across the table.

MIRROR THANDE looks at it.

 MIRROR THANDE 
One that isn’t packed with exploding hamsters.

GRIMM REAPER sighs and pushes a different brief case across the table.

 MIRROR THANDE 
 (rolls eyes) 
One that isn’t filled with molesting tentacles.

 GRIMM REAPER 
It seems my tricks are getting well known.

GRIMM REAPER pushes a briefcase across the table.

 MIRROR THANDE 
Nice doing business with you.
Hope to do it again.

 WARD 
Send my regards to your captain.

MIRROR THANDE nods and walks off. Another figure slides into the seat before WARD. WARD covers his eyes.

 STRATEGYGIRL 
That was actually fun, y’know?

 WARD 
 (eyes covered) 
I’m glad you enjoyed that.
Pay her, Grimm.
No, don’t try to kill her,
just pay her.

GRIMM REAPER sighs and pushes a briefcase across the table.

 STRATEGYGIRL 
I think I’ve ruined him for any other woman.
You should have heard his weeping.

 WARD 
 (eyes covered) 
I’m glad. But you underestimate him.
He’ll be back in the saddle in a few days.

 STRATEGYGIRL 
Then why?

 WARD 
 (eyes covered) 
Because I felt like it.
Now, if you don’t mind.
Please leave.

STRATEGYGIRL gets up and leaves.

 GRIMM REAPER 
Well, she was an attractive girl.

 WARD 
Yeah, but she ain’t what she appears.
Trust me, just don’t look at her for too long.
You’ll regret it.

 GRIMM REAPER 
 (shakes head) 
So now instead of just outright
trying to shoot the AH.commers,
we’re just messing with their minds?

 WARD 
Oh, this is just the opening number
for what I have in plan for them.

 GRIMM REAPER 
Sounds insidious.

 WARD 
It is.
Just you wait.

 TEASER 



 INT. – CHRIS’S ROOM – DAY 

CHRIS is sitting in a chair, staring at the audience..

 CHRIS 
Good Morning, fellow AH.COMMERS. It has come to my
attention that some of you have not been leaving comments
for my stories. As anyone could tell you…this is very demoralising a
nd is contributing to my poverty.
 (Pause) 
And we all know what the cure for poverty is, don’t we?

 KID 
Money?

 CHRIS 
Quite right, money! If you want me to write more,
you could pay me, or at least
 (screams) 
LEAVE A COMMENT, YOU STUPID WANKERS!

CHRIS stops, gasping for breath. There is a long pause.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
CHRIS, get on with it!

 CHRIS 
 (puzzled) 
Get on with what?

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
I said you could have this little rant if you
wrote a second AH.COM episode, remember?

 CHRIS 
 (quickly) 
I did?

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (angry) 
YES!

 CHRIS 
Ah, come on, they deserve a break from adventures for just one week.
Think of how much better it would be if I just wrote twenty pages of
ranting about the bastards who don’t comment…

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
And keep it clean, this time. We
want to break into the children’s market.
There’s an ass load of money to be
made in the children’s market.

 CHRIS 
 (outraged) 
Clean? Me? What about the sex? The drugs?
The rock and roll? Landie’s relationship with Erikka?
We are not suitable for children…

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Well? I want fan service! I want a script that
will make people say…’why, that PSYCHOMELTDOWN,
he has a talent for getting the best out of people’.

 CHRIS 
You’d be better off offering huge cash bribes.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
But you get to use this as a
platform for your right-wing views.

 CHRIS 
All right, all right, I’ll get on with it.
 (mutters) 
Me thinks that Indian man speaks with forked tongue.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
I’m writing…

 CHRIS 
Don’t you mean waiting?

The title scenes start to roll as PSYCHOMELTDOWN advances on CHRIS with a threatening air.

“THE PLANET OF PORN”

Written By: CHRIS



ACT 1



 EXT. – DEEP SPACE – NIGHT 

The CTT.NET is under attack by three smaller ships, battling it out for supremacy in a display that would awe any SFviewer.

 INT. – CTT.NET BRIDGE – DAY 

 ADAM 
Captain, enemy ships are closing in and firing heavy weapons.

 CHRIS 
All shields to max, open fire!

 EXT. – DEEP SPACE – NIGHT 

The CTT.NET rocks under a hail of fire from the enemy ships.

 INT. – CTT.NET BRIDGE – DAY 

 ADAM 
One enemy ship destroyed, two more closing in and firing…
 (beat) 
They’re hailing us!

 CHRIS 
Open communications.

The viewsceen lights up with a dark-skinned man wearing a Turkish Fez. It is, of course, ABDUL HADI PASHA

 ABDUL HADI PASHA 
This is Admiral ABDUL HADI PASHA of the
Inevitable European Caliphate. Surrender your
ship at once or be destroyed!

CHRIS’s mouth drops wide open and his face goes very pale.

 CHRIS 
I knew it! They said I was mad, they said I was
a right-winger, but look at me now! I was right!
 (pause) 
I wish Hendryk was here to see this!
 (back to ABDUL) 
Surrender, never!

 ABDUL HADI PASHA 
I shall pray for your soul.
 (to his crew) 
Open fire!

 CHRIS 
 (To ADAM) 
Arm all weapons! Prepare the final instruments
of doom and gloom! Launch the Kratman Missiles!
Launch the Ringo Plasma Cannons. Launch the Styrn Guns!

 EXT. – DEEP SPACE – NIGHT 

The enemy ships rock under the weight of the fire, but all of them remain intact.

 INT. – CTT.NET BRIDGE – DAY 

 ADAM 
Our weapons are ineffective!

 ABDUL HADI PASHA 
 (Gloating) Don’t you know that all of them predicted the inevitable Caliphate?

 CHRIS 
Damn!

 ADAM 
Sir, we’ve got another ship coming in…it’s the AH.COM!

 EXT. – DEEP SPACE – NIGHT 

The AH.COM races into the battle!

 INT. – AH.COM BRIDGE – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT takes action.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
GBW, DMA, target those ships and
drive them off the CTT.NET, now!

 ABDUL HADI PASHA 
 (appearing on viewscreen) You sons of dogs
are well known as the most immoral bunch
of inter-dimensional explorers in the history
of the Multiverse!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (smiling at the praise) Who the hell are you?

 ABDUL HADI PASHA 
This is Admiral ABDUL HADI PASHA of
the Inevitable European Caliphate. Surrender
your ship at once or be destroyed!

 HENDRYK 
 (protesting) 
But there is nothing inevitable about the Caliphate

 ABDUL HADI PASHA 
 (leering) 
and why don’t you just keep thinking that, eh?

CHRIS breaks into the viewscreen, shoving ABDUL to one side. They shove backwards and forwards until there is an uneasy truce, with each face taking up half the screen.

 CHRIS 
I told you so!

HENDRK is about to say something, but KIT beats him to it..

 KIT 
 (To ABDUL) 
Lover! I missed you so!

 ABDUL HADI PASHA 
 (shocked) 
Um…what?

 KIT 
 (To ABDUL) 
Don’t you remember our times together?

 CHRIS 
Of course he does…

Shooting breaks out on ABDUL’s bridge.

 GBW 
The enemy ships are moving away.
 (Pause) 
Now they’ve jumped out and vanished.

 CHRIS 
A triumph for bigotry over common sense.

 INT. – AH.COM LOUNGE – DAY .

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Hey, CHRIS, we seem to have saved your arse again.

 CHRIS 
 (To HENDRK) 
I told you so!

 HENDRYK 
 (angry) 
Your bloody people made it come true!

 CHRIS 
Don’t worry, I looked into China’s history
in that world. It never happened.
 (Pause) 
In fact, China never existed there

The camera closes in on HENDRYK..

 HENDRYK 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO…

 CHRIS 
 (over him) All right, all right…

 HENDRYK 
…OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (over him) 
Shut up!

HENDRYK keeps screaming until IRONYUPPIE slaps him and carts him off to her dungeon. I mean her cabin. Hem hem..

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Now that’s settled…what about the loot?

 CHRIS 
 (carefully) 
What loot?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
The last time we talked, you said you had
something for me if I helped you again.
I seem to have saved your butt.

 KIT 
I saved his butt
 (eyes CHRIS) 
Say, how about a night in my cabin as a reward?

CHRIS edges away..

 CHRIS 
Ah…as founding member of the
AH.COM BUSH LOVERS SOCIETY…

 HENDRYK 
 (In distance) 
ONLY Member!

 CHRIS 
I have to keep my homosexual exploits under wraps.
 (To DOCTOR WHAT) 
Bruno, I have the goods, the goods, and nothing but the goods.
 (pulls a CD out of his pocket) 
I went on a quest, chatted up many lovely ladies,
and finally hunted down the man behind this nightmare,
and then grabbed him and took the disc from him.
 (To himself) 
No one must know I found it in the toilet.
 (To DOCTOR WHAT) 
I have here the key to the greatest treasure
in the Multiverse…the Planet of Porn!

The crew stare at the CD as if it contained the secret to eternal life.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (drooling) 
Give that here, now!

 CHRIS 
Finish Snake Oil first!

DOCTOR WHAT grabs a pen and writes with frantic speed..

 DOCTOR WHAT 
There, done! Now, give me the CD?

 CHRIS 
I must warn you that there’s a curse…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grabbing CD) 
Never mind that, get out of here; we have a
quest to find the PLANET OF PORN!
 (Pause) 
What? You’re still here?

Dramatic music plays.

 INT. – AH.COM CONTROL ROOM – DAY .

 DOCTOR WHAT 
LEO, find me that damn world!

 LEO 
Humm….

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Never mind thinking about it, just hurry up!

The camera pans around to reveal all the crew, waiting to hear the results..

 LEO 
Humm….the CD definitely seems to contain a location,
Bruno; it really does look like a world where there is…

He pauses.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Where there is porn, Bruno, lots and lots of porn!

 LEO 
Quite right, Doc.

 OTHNIEL 
We must go there at once!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I knew we’d finally get you turned around…
 (Pause) 
You’re going to suggest that we save them all from porn, right?

OTHNIEL nods.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Don’t worry, we’ll save them all from porn by…
 (OTHNIEL looks hopeful) 
Transferring it all onboard this ship!
 (Turns to helm.) 
Landie…wait a minute, you’re not LANDSHARK!

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (For it is he) I was the only one who bothered
to suggest something, so I guess CHRIS gave
me the greatest roles…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Fine, fine, set a course for the planet of porn!
 (Pause) 
Oh, and Erika, would you mind
putting OTHNIEL out of the way?

The scene fades out as IRONYUPPIE drags OTHNIEL away.

 EXT. – DEEP SPACE – NIGHT 

The AH.COM turns and vanishes into a vortex.

 MUCH LATER 

EXT. – DEEP SPACE – NIGHT

The AH.COM emerges out of a vortex

 INT. – AH.COM BRIDGE – DAY .

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (Tugging on his tunic) 
Report!

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (VERY bad Scottish accent) 
The engines canna take it any more,
Captain; we’re gonna blow.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (To himself) 
I told you it wasn’t funny the first time.
What makes you think the hundredth time would make it so?

 DAVE HOWERY 
It just will, damn it!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
LEO, for God’s sake, report!

 LEO 
 (Portentous voice) 
Bruno, B-Man…we are in orbit above the planet of porn, but…

The crew race out of the door, struggling to pass through it, finally kicked through by IRONYUPPIE. LEO tries to say something, but every time he speaks, the noise of the scum overwhelms him.

 LEO 
But they didn’t hear me complete my report…

Ominous music begins to play.

 EXT. – THE PLANET OF PORN, EDINBURGH – DAY 

The crew appear with a loud pop.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Where’s my porn?

 LANDSHARK 
Do you ever think about anything else?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
By IAN, I do believe I don’t. Naughty Bruno.

They catch sight of a shop and DOCTOR WHAT leads the charge. The shop is selling Porn. Lots and lots of porn.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
We’ve hit the mother lode, lads…

 KIT 
Doc, have a look around.

DOCTOR WHAT looks around. The team is surrounded by naked men and women, none of whom look the slightest bit aroused.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
What in the name of…co-ed spanking nurses is going on?

 LEO 
 (Over com) You should have let me finish, B-Man.
 (Evilly) 
These puny fleshlings have seen so much porn that they’re immune to it.
 (Pause) 
HA-HA!

DOCTOR WHAT’s face pales.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO…




 END ACT I 



 ACT II 




 EXT. – THE PLANET OF PORN, EDINBURGH – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT is still screaming.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
….OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO….

 TORQUMADA 
Let me try this…

He pulls out a small device and zaps DOCTOR WHAT with it. DOCTOR WHAT stops screaming and falls over.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (groaning) 
What the hell hit me?
 (beat) 
Get away from my wallet! Fiends!

 LANDSHARK 
 (Maliciously) 
You just found out that all the men and women
on this planet were not strangely aroused.

DOCTOR WHAT’S eyes roll back in his head, but IRONYUPPIE slaps him before he can faint, or start screaming again.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
LEO, what the hell happened here?

 LEO 
I can’t help you, Bruno; I fear that
I am a little indisposed at the moment.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (under breath) Damn computer
 (Pause) 
All right, I guess it’s up to us to find out what’s happened here.
 (Glances around and sees a naked lady) 
I think we’ll ask her.

The crew walk over to the lady, a blonde bombshell. Despite her nakedness, and the looks she is getting from the remainder of the crew, she doesn’t seem at all uneasy in their presence, although she eyes DOCTOR WHAT’s crotch and tries to hide a snigger. She is beautiful beyond words, with large breasts and other things I would detail, where it not for the death threats from PSYCHOMELTDOWN.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Pardon me, Madam.

 KILNGIRL 
You have an erection!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nonplussed) 
Yes…

 LANDSHARK 
 (Quickly) 
What? That little thing?

 KILNGIRL 
 (With dignity) 
It’s the biggest erection that anyone has had
here since the damn pornmaster arrived.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
But you don’t find it strangely arousing?

 KILNGIRL 
 (Embarrassed) Umm, well…
 (coughs) 
But you are not affected?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
The short version of the tale is that we’re from an
alternate world and we came here to find the porn.
 (Pause, speaks in false doctor’s voice) 
What happened, my dear?

 KILNGIRL 
Oh, it was terrible. One day, Parliament passed the Porn Laws,
allowing the sale of Porn everywhere…and those who didn’t like
it were exterminated in the Porn Wars.

THANDE coughs loudly. Everyone looks at him.

 KILNGIRL 
Porn was everywhere and everyone watched it. They watched it
from dawn till dusk and then they found that nothing turned them
on any more. It became more and more extreme, darker and darker,
and still…none of our men could get hard. We women weren’t much
better; we couldn’t even muster the energy to lie back and think
of England, and…well, the birth rate in this place has fallen…

 MATT 
 (Hopefully) 
We all have erections and I’m sure that a former
US Marine could satisfy your cravings.

 KILNGIRL 
 (Sadly) 
The soldiers won’t fuck and they won’t fight.
 (To herself) 
And I don’t have any cravings.
 (To DOCTOR WHAT) 
Don’t you understand?
Porn killed this world!

KLINGIRL leaves. Behind her, the AH.COMMERS watch her go.

 LANDSHARK 
Hey, DOC, did you ever know
that your addition could be harmful?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (Angry) 
WE ARE GOING TO SAVE
THESE PEOPLE,
UNDERSTAND?

 TORQUMADA 
 (doctor mode) 
well, it’s clear that the cause was the porn, so we
should simply open fire on it and blow it away.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (hypnotised tone) 
Porn is not to blame. Porn is good.
 (IRONYUPPIE slaps him) 
Ouch. All right; LEO, where is the pornmaster based?

 LEO 
 (On Com) 
Where else, B-Man? Edinburgh castle

The crew look up towards the castle. It has been replaced with a vaguely phallic shape, sticking up into the sky.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Of course…come on, come on…

The crew start to walk towards the castle. A montage of shots as they walk, revealing more naked men and women, other men and women dressed up in sexy outfits and still others trying desperately to arouse themselves. A phonespammer flies around, selling Viagra, but somehow it isn’t enough to make people interested in sex once again. The entire city is dull and listless, no one is drinking, fighting or even leering at the naked women.

 THANDE 
Stop it! Stop it now!

 LANDSHARK 
WTF is he on about?

 IRONYUPPIE 
I think he’s been drinking his own creations again…

DOCTOR WHAT glares at her…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grimly) 
This nightmare will come to an end!

 IRONYUPPIE 
Isn’t he cute when he tries to be firm?

 LANDSHARK 
 (astonished) 
I thought that that was what you always said to me!

 IRONYUPPIE 
It isn’t cute when you’re not firm.
 (shakes hard) 
Honestly, men. Once day, we’ll replace them all
with robo-men from the planet of the Large Men
with Massive Pleasure Appendixes.

 MATT 
Sexist. Why can’t it be the planet of the Large Women
with Enormous Pleasure Appendixes?

 IRONYUPPIE 
I think we’ve been to that planet before.
That world full of transsexuals.

 LANDSHARK 
See, MATT, a world for you.

 IRONYUPPIE 
HAH!

 MATT 
I. HATE. YOU. ALL.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Here we are…and onwards we go,
into the belly of the beast,
rode the six hundred, onwards,
ever onwards, to the setting of the sun…

 LEO 
 (Breaking in) 
Doc, I think you’ve got your poems mixed up.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Would I get something wrong?

 IRONYUPPIE 
Well, there was that moment when you went to bed
with that transgendered priest from universe 765676583.
There was that time when you tried to attack the Hub.
There was that time when you didn’t comment on
CHRIS’s latest master piece…

 CHRIS 
 (off) Note subtext here.

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (Continuing) .
There was that time when you trusted WARD.
There was that time when you tried to make love to me and
couldn’t get it up. There was that time when you were knocking
ATA up. There was that time when…

MUCH later…

 IRONYUPPIE 
There was that time when…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
All right, I’ve made a few screwy decisions in my time…

 IRONYUPPIE 
A few?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
But we have to save these people, Erica; please…

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (graciously) 
Very well, BRUNO; let us enter the castle.

 INT. – EDINBURGH CASTLE – DAY 

The Castle’s interior is cold and grey, a relief after spending time in the streets of the warped city. The Crew advance, weapons at the ready, though a set of corridors in which nothing can be seen, but images of a strange face that seems somehow impossible to see clearly. The crew examine the images from time to time, but none of them resolve into a face. The only sign of life is faint music from down the corridor, so naturally the crew go to investigate.

The corridor opens suddenly into a balcony, overlooking a large bedroom. They peer down, and see an astonishingly beautiful girl…ah, servicing a handsome man with an enormous pecker. The sight is so astonishing that it takes the crew a moment to realise who it is…it’s MATT!

 MATT 
Well…fuck me.

 IRONYUPPIE 
That must be the most appropriate use of those words ever.

FLOID enters from a side door.

 FLOID 
 (To ALT-MATT) .
Come along, you impotent scrum; shoot your wad
so we can get on with the screen where she slaps
your face, dumps you, and goes off with those
damn lesbians your counterpart created!

The crew (except MATT) bursts out laughing. FLOID looks up and sees them.

 FLOID 
What the…you!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grimly) 
Yes, us. Pornmaster! Once again, we clash…
first you stole the ship of a friend of mine…

 FLOID 
And that bastard went off and sold my porn,
after telling me that it had all been deleted.

 LANDSHARK 
 (To himself) 
So that’s how he hired those ghost writers.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (ignoring him with the ease of long practice) 
And now you have stripped this world of its
capability for finding Porn arousing. You will
suffer like no man has ever suffered!

 FLOID 
A fate worse than death?

 IRONYUPPIE 
Of course not, you bastard; worse than that!

 FLOID 
A fate worse than a fate worse than death?
What did I ever do to you people anyway?

 MATT 
You didn’t let me get laid!

 KIT 
You made me sleep with girls!

DOCTOR WHAT’s comlink buzzes

 OTHNIEL 
You exposed me to naked women!
It was almost as bad as being a Mormon.

 FLOID 
Apart from that? What have I done to you recently?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
YOU are going to pay. I am going to take you back to the Hub,
where the Great and Mighty IAN will stand in judgement over you,
using his godlike powers to make you pay for what you have done!

 FLOID 
But you don’t understand…
 (a lone violin plays ‘hearts and flowers’) 
I’m not the one in charge here.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (not believing him for a nanosecond) 
Really?

 FLOID 
When I left the CTT.NET, I found myself lost in
the Multiverse, until I encountered HIM.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
HIM?

 FLOID 
But there are so much more interesting things to do.
Why not star in one of my epics? All of you, except him
 (points to MATT) 
could star…

 IRONYUPPIE 
Are you daring to suggest that I should…
put on a show for thousands of viewers?

 FLOID 
Of course
 (Eyes her) 
You would look just right tied to a bed, while your boyfriend there
 (nods to LANDSHARK) 
could advance on you, pretending to be attacking you and…

 LANDSHARK 
Hey, that sounds pretty good!

IRONYUPPIE flattens him with a punch, and then advances on FLOID.

 IRONYUPPIE 
If you suggest anything else along those lines,
I will rip your spine out and use it for purposes
so unspeakable that no one will speak of them.

 LANDSHARK 
 (Dazed, on floor) 
Hey, that sounds pretty good!

 IRONYUPPIE 
Shut up!
 (To FLOID) 
Now, WTF is going on here?

 FLOID 
The man took me and told me to produce Porn, using
this world as a base, and then give them all the Porn.
We made tons of Porn and just…gave it away.
 (He starts sobbing) 
We made all that lovely porn and we can’t even benefit from it!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (Outraged) 
A crime against humanity!

 IRONYUPPIE 
Gee, Doc, weren’t you talking
about punishing this guy?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I can’t punish a man who’s
so obviously a victim, can I?

FLOID runs out the door. A moment later, he is followed by hundreds of nude women and a handful of nude men, fleeing for their lives.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (drooling) 
That’s the way to go, my friends; after them!

 GBW 
Weren’t we trying to catch the person responsible for all this?

DOCTOR WHAT pauses just long enough for all the women to escape.

 LANDSHARK 
You just had to use logic
and reason, didn’t you?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
No, GBW is right
 (Pause) 
A new personal best for him, eh?
 (Pause) 
Come on, we have to find the person
responsible for all this…GBW has spoken.

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (under breath) 
Now what’s gotten into him?

The crew advance down the corridor and finally come into a large room, obviously designed by some jerkass out to take over the world. There is a massive chair in the centre of the room, with its back turned so the crew cannot see who’s sitting there, gazing at the monitors that show an series of different images, half of them porn. One of the monitors is focused on the crew, clearly taken by a camera high above them…

 WEAPON M 
Time for some action here!

He points his BFG up at the ceiling and unleashes a blast of plasma fire into the camera.

 LANDSHARK 
 (Angry) 
You stupid…what are you again?
You’ve just told him we’re here!

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (Whispering) 
Plan, Doc?

The figure in the chair, still hidden from their view, speaks. The voice is oddly familiar, but no one can place it.

 FIGURE 
Do you think you can hide from me?
 (Pause) 
I have watched you ever since you landed on my world.
 (Pause) 
And you are now quaking in terror
at the mere thought of my name…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
MIKE COLLINS?

 IRONYUPPIE 
No, Doc, it’s KADYAT

 HENDRYK 
No, that’s WARD.

 FIGURE 
 (Booming) 
You are all wrong!

The Figure spins around, revealing a short teenage boy with spotty skin and unshaven face, his hair oiled and sinking, his belly exposed and fat enough for three brats, his glasses too large for his face, his…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Who the hell are you?

 FIGURE 
 (Booming) 
I am SUPERNOOB!
 (The Superman Theme Tune plays) 
And I am your DOOM!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (Puzzled) I beg your pardon?

 SUPERNOOB 
SUPERNOOB! I was banned from
the Hub by his Idiotness IAN!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Doesn’t ring a bell

 SUPERNOOB 
I posted insults about IAN to the board!

DOCTOR WHAT shakes his head

 SUPERNOOB 
I posted rude comments about the Jews!

DOCTOR WHAT shakes his head

 SUPERNOOB 
I told the pakis to go back
home and stay there!

DOCTOR WHAT shakes his head

 SUPERNOOB 
I told CHRIS that he was a stupid
bastard for sleeping with an Indian girl!

DOCTOR WHAT shakes his head

 SUPERNOOB 
I posted rude comments about Extinction Event!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (Furious) 
Why, you little…but I still haven’t heard of you.

 SUPERNOOB 
I said Hitler was right to exterminate the Jews!

 LANDSHARK 
Oh, boy, you’re playing with fire.

 SUPERNOOB 
I posted great plans to
exterminate all the Muslims!

 IRONYUPPIE 
So you’re a pathetic little
brat with an attention fixation.
 (Pause) 
I know how to deal with people like you
 (To LANDSHARK) 
Landie, go and fetch my cane.
 (To SUPERNOOB) 
Bend over and drop your pants.

SUPERNOOB’s face lights up and he stumbles to his feet.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (Worried) 
Umm…Erika, I think he might actually enjoy that.

 IRONYUPPIE 
He won’t when I’ve finished with him.

GBW has been checking his Blackberry.

 GBW 
Umm…there seems to be some mistake…
ah, SUPERNOOB. You’re not banned.

 SUPERNOOB 
By the beard of Osema Bin Ladin!

 GBW 
You’re not in the Hall of Infamy, you’re not
listed under Kicked. You’re not even warned…

 MATT 
 (Evilly) 
If a NOOB is squawking and no
one hears him, does he make a sound?

 SUPERNOOB 
 (Furious) 
But I have a right to be banned! I demand to be banned!
 (Pause) 
Oh, and I have a right to be caned as well.

 IRONYUPPIE 
Oh, shut up. I’ve saving my wrist for
taking all of this out on Landie later
 (pause) 
Hell, why wait? Landie, bend over!

 EVERYONE ELSE 
The FORKS! The FORKS!

 SUPERNOOB 
And now I will destroy you all! I’ll blow you
into little pieces, and then I’ll blow them into
even smaller pieces, and then I’ll blow those
into even smaller pieces…

 TORQUMADA 
He’s gone mad with power!

 THANDE 
Oh, that’s your considered medical opinion, is it?

 TORQUMADA 
Do you have a better idea?

 SUPERNOOB 
 (Annoyed) 
Of course I’ve gone mad with power. Have you
ever gone mad without power? It’s boring.
No one listens to you.

 IRONYUPPIE 
And that line was nicked from the Simpsons.

DOCTOR WHAT steps forward.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (Fatherly) 
Now look here, son…you’ve done a lot of very
bad things and you’re going to be punished for them
 (Pause) 
and I don’t mean a simple caning this time
 (Pause) 
but I am prepared to be lenient.

 SUPERNOOB 
 (Doubtfully) 
Really?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Yes. Surrender now, release these
people, and you won’t be killed.

SUPERNOOB bursts out laughing.

 SUPERNOOB 
You don’t have the stones to kill me, What!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (angry) 
Are you sure about that?

 SUPERNOOB 
And you can’t kill me anyway!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (angry) 
And Are you sure about that too?

He leans forward, face to face with SUPERNOOB.&lt;

 DOCTOR WHAT 
My crew and I have been through a lot together. We took on and
defeated the alien space bats. We beat Admiral Honorblower. We
defeated Lesbians in single combat in their queen’s bed. We duelled
with the Fallen. We even attacked the Hub
and brought it to the verge of total defeat.
 (He leans closer) 
You’re a silly teenage boy who has gained equipment
he doesn’t know how to control.
Are you sure that we can’t beat you?

 SUPERNOOB 
I am like nothing you have ever seen before!

 TORQUMADA 
Actually, I’m pretty sure that most of
us went through the same stage.
 (disturbing grin) 
I recommend spankings, lots and lots of spankings.

 SUPERNOOB 
Yes, I am confident that I
can kick your asses, like this!

he hits a button on his chair and a force field shimmers into existence, knocking DOCTOR WHAT to the ground as an entire series of BFGs, LBFGs, OHMWABEGs and OBFGS appear out of nowhere, controlled by robots and targeting the AH.COMMERS. Bursts of plasma fire go everywhere as the AH.COMMERS dive for cover, before returning fire with their own weapons, sending sparks and flickering lights everywhere. SUPERNOOB laughs as MATT and WEAPON M go sprawling, before IRONYUPPIE uses her Yo-Yo to take out half the robots in a single swipe.

 IRONYUPPIE 
You didn’t think of that, did you?
 (Pause) 
And think of poor Landie…

 SUPERNOOB 
He’s going to suffer like no other
outside a Japanese porn flick…

And, indeed, massive robot tentacles are catching and trapping LANDSHARK in their grasp, reaching out towards his unmentionables.

 HENDRKY 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
 (Pause) 
Take me instead!

 SUPERNOOB 
Don’t be stupid, Mr Chinaman;
you’d actually enjoy this…

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (For it is he) I guess
it’s time for ME to be the hero!

DAVE leaps forward with his chainsaw and slices LANDSHARK free, just before he can be put through one of the most horrifying, and yet strangly arousing, events in the Multiverse.

 IRONYUPPIE 
Aww…you saved him.
 (Tiring of it) 
Snap out of it, B-MAN!

SUPERNOOB’s gaze snaps down to DOCTOR WHAT, who has been trapped inside the field.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (drooling) What?
 (Pause) 
I found it strangely arousing.

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (Shouting) get him, Bruno!

DOCTOR WHAT staggers to his feet and swings a punch at SUERNOOB. It wouldn’t bother a hamster, or even a snail, but as SUPERNOOB is a nerd, the punch sends him snapping backwards against his chair, which topples over and crashes into the floor. SUPERNOOB tries to stand up, but IRONYUPPIE is on him in seconds, tying him up with her whip before kicking him in the nuts and smashing him into the wall.

 LANDSHARK 
God, I love that woman.

 IRONYUPPIE 
Silence, slave! Go fetch my…
really nasty torturing device.

 GBW 
Umm…there seems to be a
problem with the computers…

And indeed, the lights are flashing red and alarms are sounding.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (angry) 
LEO, what the fuck is going on?

 LEO 
 (On comm) 
I can only put forward a hypotheses, Doc,
that our friend here didn’t bother to set any
security settings that would have prevented
the system from overloading and blowing up.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Get us the fuck out of here!

 LEO 
 (On comm) 
No can do, Bruno; there’s too
much interference for you
to be beamed out. I suggest
that you shag ass out of there!

 KIT 
 (Saluting smartly) 
Shagging ass, sir!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
LEO, damn it, come up with a better idea!

 LEO 
 (On comm) 
Must I? Oh, very well…put the wristcom
near the computers and I’ll take them over.
 (Short pause) 
There…there we are…that’s the computers
taken over and…shut down.

The lights go back to normal.

 GBW 
LEO, are you sure you’re ok?

 LEO 
 (On comm) 
Bush, of course I’m fine.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Fine. Now, what happened to this world?

 LEO 
 (On comm) 
It’s really very simple, Bruno; our friend there used these systems
to impose porn on the entire world, which meant that the world’s
development was warped because of porn, but now everything
should be returning to normal. I think that he was actually
admitting them to porn using strange energies so that they
couldn’t become aroused without exposure to porn of a kind
so vile that even FLOID would refuse to deal with it.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (angry) 
Bastard! Now, what’s going to happen now?

 LEO 
 (On comm) 
Judging from my readings,
the energies are gone, so people
are returning to their normal habits and…
hey, there’s an orgy going on in
the park!

With an audible set of whooshes, most of the crew vanish back out of the castle.

 MATT 
Well, this is just great, isn’t it! Why do
I have to be the one left holding the nerd?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (ignoring him) 
LEO, now that the energies are gone, teleport MATT and
our captive up to the ship and keep an eye on them until
we can ship him to the Hub and dump him in COLLIN’S cell.
 (Pause) 
And, as for me, I wonder if that hot blonde is still around…

DOCTOR WHAT races out of the castle

 MATT 
WANKER!

 EXT. – THE PLANET OF PORN, EDINBURGH – DAY 

The city is in the middle of a massive party, with loads of sex, drugs and rock and roll. DOCTOR WHAT is talking to KILNGIRL.

 KILNGIRL 
You saved us all!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Yes, we did, and, for once, my crew
is going to get what we deserve…

He reaches out for her and she comes willingly towards him, but he glances over towards the edge of the party and sees an advancing army about to burn him and the remainder of his crew…for daring to disturb their peace and quiet. Or, more likely, they’re going to burn the crew for SUPERNOOB’s crimes.

 LEO 
 (On comm) 
Doc, the planetary defence networks are about to open fire on us.

DOCTOR WHAT jumps to his feet.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well, my dear, it seems I have to go. But I will come back.

 KILNGIRL 
Don’t hurry on my account.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Why is it we’re always chased off worlds
when we try to have sex with the locals?
 (shakes head) 

DOCTOR WHAT waves and vanishes in a loud pop.

 EXT. – DEEP SPACE – NIGHT 

The AH.COM opens a vortex and escapes the planet of porn.




 END ACT II 



 TAG 




 INT. – CHRIS’S ROOM–NIGHT 

PSYCHOMELTDOWN storms in, his face contorted with rage.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
That was a bloody awful episode!

 CHRIS 
 (Annoyed) 
You get what you pay for.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (angry) 
I didn’t pay you anything!

 CHRIS 
My point exactly!

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (angry) 
You made a gibbering idiot out of LANDSHARK!
You made IRONYUPPIE into a dominix! You made
KILNGIRL into a blonde bombshell…

 CHRIS 
She’s not complaining!

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (angry) 
And you let DAVE HOWERY be the hero!

 CHRIS 
But all he did was save Landie from a fate worse than
a fate worse than a fate worse than death…
 (Realises) 
DOH!

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (Angry) 
Well, owing to a tiff with the writer chimps,
I find myself lacking an episode, so
I guess I’ll have to post yours, but.
 (Produces whip) 
You’re going to suffer for this.

He chases CHRIS off with a whip. DOCTOR WHAT enters the room.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well, I found it strangely arousing.

The scene fades out over CHRIS’s screams.

 TEASER 

 

 

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH 

We see the Earth turning, the familiar blue-green ball spitted with clouds. In the background, the stars do not twinkle in the void of space, but merely appear as points of cold, hard light against the black velvet night.

As we watch, a light blossoms on the eastern seaboard of North America, followed by a second, then a third…and then they begin in Europe…

We hear a confused, staticky collection of voices, as though intercepting radio transmissions.

 RADIO VOICES 
…retaliate in kind…missile bases in Cornwall…
Confederate cities of New Leesburg and Daviston
have been completely destroyed…Cispennine
Republic forces have swept into Wessex…the
Kaapstadt declares war on the Raj…the Soviets
have threatened to activate a hitherto unseen ‘
doomsday device’…

As we watch, more explosions blossom all over the world, city after city joining the atomic pyre. We see cracks open in the earth’s crust, volcanoes going off and adding to the chaos, whole islands sinking beneath boiling seas. Black clouds fill the atmosphere and we see the polar ice caps slowly expanding with a grinding sound.

The world is dying.

The radio voices return, far fewer this time.

 RADIO VOICES 
…estimate…six months until total global collapse…
earth no longer capable of supporting human life…
in this last hour, all remnants must join hands…
humanity has only one chance for survival…
sleeper ship…new colony…Alpha Centauri…
not repeat the mistakes of the past…

As the Earth darkens to the twilight of death, we see one last flare of light from Florida, and a huge starship blasts up from the ground. More nuclear detonations behind it, one every few seconds – it’s an Orion-drive nuclear pulse ship. Huge, by today’s standards, like a vast office block with engines, and it’s heading away from the dead Earth, off past the moon and towards Alpha Centauri.

We pan away from the Earth and see the vessel, the last hope, orient on Alpha Centauri, its engines powering up for the acceleration as the moon gleams softly in the background.

Then there is a TERRIFIC FLASH OF LIGHT as a RED VORTEX burns to life near the moon! The fabric of reality warps and wobbles as something punches a hole through it – and the AH.COM SHIP explodes through into the new world!

The AH.com ship collides with the sleeper ship, its advanced shields ripping a great hole in the ship as though it were made of tissue paper, and what’s left of the ship goes spinning towards the moon, crashes and explodes.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (VO) 
Er…ooops?

 “SEALIONS ON AN AIRSHIP” 

 Written By : THANDE 

 

 
 

 ACT I 

 

 
 

 EXT. – AH.COM SHIP – CROSSTIME VORTEX 

The AH.com ship hurtles through the crosstime vortex, a brilliant spiral of blue and red light, flickering with strange lightning that almost forms itself into recognisable shapes, but not quite.

Pan in through a window, deep into the heart of the ship…

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – ENGINEERING BAY – NIGHT 

It’s the night shift. DAVE HOWERY is asleep in a sleeping back on top of the engine core, wearing a Wee Willie Winkie nightcap and snoring loudly. Next to him, KEIRA KNIGHTLEY holds a packet of Woodbines over a vent on the core, which abruptly blasts out a burst of flame and lights the cigarettes. Smiling, she starts chain-smoking them.

Pan down across the engine core to the main engineering bay, where one of those Star Trek-type situation tables stands, with controls and display panels all over it.

As we watch, G.BONE throws a green poker tablecloth over the top of it.

 G.BONE 
Perfect!

We see G.BONE is joined by FLOCCULENCIO, PSYCHOMELTDOWN and MICHAEL.

 MICHAEL 
Call me Mr Nitpicker, but shouldn’t
we kind of turn off all the controls first?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Alas, my Aussie friend – like myself, his
fellow native of the mysterious and alluring
East – Mr Bone, His Boniness, is likewise
afflicted, or should I say blessed , with
a terminal case of happy-go-lucky laziness.

 G.BONE 
 (nodding) 
Yeah! So there!
 (whispers out of corner of mouth to PSYCHO) 
What’d he say?

MICHAEL sighs and throws his pack of cards down onto the table. We hear a ‘beep!’ and, in the background, there’s an explosion and we dimly see DAVE HOWERY launched up off the top of the engine core. He tumbles through the air and wedges between two bits of support scaffolding, ending up hanging over the core. Despite these acrobatics, he continues snoring. The four of them glance upward and shrug.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (sitting down) 
Are we playing ASBs high?

 G.BONE 
And wanks low.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Pah, ’tis the only honourable way to play the game!
 (pulls up his chair) 
Gentlemen, deal your cards!

In a montage of scenes, we see the four players flicking down various combinations of cards, and hourglasses of blue-glowing Time, which are used instead of chips, cross the table. MICHAEL and FLOCCULENCIO accumulate time at the expense of PSYCHOMELTDOWN and G.BONE, at least for now.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (slapping down cards triumphantly) 
Hah! Beat this, Aussie boy!
Chinese, French and Dutch Australia!

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (looks at MICHAEL commiseratingly) 
Hoist by your own petard, I’m afraid, old bean.

 MICHAEL 
 (calmly scraping his chin with his cards) 
Hmm. The only possible hand that could beat
that is a Successful Sealion…

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (angrily) 
You haven’t!

 MICHAEL 
No-o, I haven’t.
 (pause) 
I have, however, substituted your cards
for razor-sharp Chinese fighting cards.

With a flick, MICHAEL sends a Cromwellwank card speeding through the air, where it buries itself in PSYCHO’s throat with a spurt of blood. PSYCHO chokes, but then yanks it out and hurls it straight back at MICHAEL, slicing the back of his hand open. MICHAEL picks up his chair and attempts to beat PSYCHO over the head with it, while PSYCHO holds him off with one hand and tries to sew up his throat with the other.

While the fight goes on in the background, FLOCCULENCIO exchanges a look with G.BONE.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
How ungentlemanly—this should be done in
the correct way, pistols at dawn.

 G.BONE 
And, like, he could have just swapped the cards
for a Successful Sealion hand anywho.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (raising an eyebrow) 
True, but ’tis Michael.

 G.BONE 
Of course…
 (pause) 
Successful Sealions…that reminds me of something
that happened to me a long time ago…before I joined
this ship, y’know? It’s a long story…would you like to hear it?

FLOCCULENCIO, by now, is reading The Kama Sutra and smoking a pipe, ignoring G.BONE.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (distractedly) 
Hmm, yes, of course, go on.

FLOCCULENCIO turns the book sideways and his eyes widen, the pipe dropping from his mouth.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Merciful Ganesh! I didn’t know you could
do that with a chapatti!

In the background, we see PSYCHO and MICHAEL, both trying to sew up their wounds, accidentally tangle their threads so PSYCHO’s neck is sewn to MICHAEL’s right hand. Their struggle continues.

 G.BONE 
 (oblivious of all this) 
Sure! Like I said, it was a long time ago…
 (puts on deep voice) 
in a timeline, far, far away…

SMEARY DREAMS OF REMINISCENCE EFFECT (WIBBLINESS) 

 EXT. – PACIFIC OCEAN – DAY 

A beautiful Pacific summer day, panning over the blue, blue ocean towards Oahu in the distance. Seagulls scatter over the growing waves.

Pan down and focus on one wave as it grows to tremendous proportions, heading for a Hawaiian beach.

Rising to the very crest of the wave is a man in a Hawaiian shirt and shorts riding a surfboard painted with the pattern of an Iron Cross…

It’s a younger G.BONE, grinning without a care in the world.

We hear a ‘HONK!’ off to one side, and G.BONE turns and salutes its source – a great ironclad steamship belching smoke, flying the Hawaiian flag (Union Jack with red, blue and white stripes) and bearing the name HHMS Kamehameha .

G.BONE turns away, bends his knees and expertly rides the wave as it crashes down on the shore, fetching up on the sand and slowly grinding to a halt. He scoops up his surfboard, grins again and walks at a leisurely pace up the beach to the town.

We pan outwards again to show a large billboard next to the tourists sunbathing on the beach: it shows the flag again, and “WELCOME TO THE KINGDOM OF HAWAII”.

 EXT. – HAWAII – MOUNTAINS – DAY 

G.BONE is cycling back up on a mountain trail, his surfboard slung on his back. It’s quite out of the way, away from the main roads, and there’s no-one else on the track. He’s whistling tunelessly to himself.

Change camera angle to show the road surface and G.BONE’s cycle wheel hit something metal. He goes head over heels over his handlebars and lands with an ‘oof!’ beside the road.

Rubbing himself resentfully, G.BONE gets up and glares at what his bike hit – a set of rusting iron shackles.

 G.BONE 
Damned Draka tourists…

We suddenly hear the sound of someone shouting and screaming in the distance. Puzzledly, G.BONE turns around, focuses in on the sound and then follows it…

 EXT. – HAWAII – FOREST – DAY 

G.BONE picks his way through the jungle and into a glade, where he peers through a gap in a bush. We see a Chinese-looking man tied upside down to a tree – AOZHUAHAREN – while facing him is a second, HELLOLEGEND, with a sneer on his face. HELLOLEGEND is holding a baseball bat and is backed up by two Korean henchmen, GENERAL_TIU and KANG SAE JUNG.

 HELLOLEGEND 
 (to AOZHUAHAREN) 
What have you got to say for yourself?

 AOZHUAHAREN 
I’ll never talk!

 HELLOLEGEND 
 (turning to the other two) 
Poll: do you think he’ll talk?
Yes, no, thongs or thongs?

 KANG SAE JUNG 
Yes.

 GENERAL_TIU 
 (dreamily) 
Oh, thongs…

HELLOLEGEND turns back to AOZHUAHAREN, patting his baseball bat into his other hand.

 HELLOLEGEND 
You shall give your inferior opinion
to this VALUED CONTRIBUTOR to the
black market economy, HelloLegend,
or I’ll force you to watch all my Golden
Girls DVDs until your mind explodes.

 AOZHUAHAREN 
Gah – never!

AOZHUAHAREN lunges blindly for HELLOLEGEND, but the latter whacks him with the baseball bat and AOZHUAHAREN screams in pain.

 HELLOLEGEND 
 (turning to the other two) 
Poll: is baseball a good game?
Yes, no, Deanna Troi or Bea Arthur?

 GENERAL_TIU/KANG SAE JUNG 
 (tentatively) 
Yes?

 HELLOLEGEND 
 (savagely whacking them) 
Wrong! No! You inferior Korean savages!
 (smiles crazily) 
They gave the Montreal Expos to Washington
instead of Las Vegas –
 (sighs in satisfaction) 
- so it is a stupid sport played suitable only
for the racially degenerate!

HELLOLEGEND hits AOZHUAHAREN again and, with a rattling gasp, AOZHUAHAREN expires.

 HELLOLEGEND 
Oh no. Now he will never be able to tell
me about how he found out that I have
EARNED MY SENIORITY as a drug baron
and how I am STAYING HERE FOREVER.

 G.BONE 
 (to himself) 
Totally evil Asian dudes!

G.BONE takes a tentative step back and a twig snaps under his foot. HELLOLEGEND spins around and spots him.

 HELLOLEGEND 
 (pointing) 
He heard me! He overheard my
VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS!
Get him!

G.BONE gulps and hightails it away, pursued by KANG SAE JUNG and GENERAL_TIU.

They chase each other through the jungle. G.BONE bends a branch back as he passes and then it hitting KANG SAE JUNG in the face, sending him sprawling.

GENERAL_TIU pulls out a pistol and fires, but narrowly misses G.BONE and instead hits a wasp’s nest hanging in the tree, which explodes into a flurry of angry wasps that attack GENERAL_TIU.

We pan across to the track, where two men are strolling past. They look like MrP and TORQUMADA, but MrP is dressed nattily like an Edwardian on the river, and TORQUMADA is dressed as a Southern gentleman, Colonel Saunders style with a huge moustache.

 ALT-MrP 
Now, don’t you see, old chap, that
gun ownership is a very dangerous
proposition, donchaknow?

 ALT-TORQUMADA 
Bah! I suppose you’ll say that the poor
should get free medical treatment next!

 ALT-MrP 
Oh, don’t be so ridiculous, old bean.
 (laughs slightly) 
 Being poor is an incurable condition, donchaknow.

G.BONE pushes past them, heading for his bicycle, followed a moment later by a bruised-faced KANG SAE JUNG and a GENERAL_TIU covered in wasp stings, plus HELLOLEGEND with his baseball bat.

ALT-MrP and ALT-TORQUMADA watch the pursuit without expression, ALT-MrP taking his pipe out of his mouth and ALT-TORQUMADA wiping his monocle distractedly on his kerchief.

 ALT-MrP 
I say, something of a fracas.

 ALT-TORQUMADA 
Indeed – but what else can one expect in
these savage tropical backwaters?

They shrug, and move on.

 EXT. – HAWAII – MOUNTAIN ROAD 

G.BONE jumps on his bike and quickly cycles away, bullets speeding overhead. HELLOLEGEND curses as he heads off into the distance.

 HELLOLEGEND 
 (turning to the other two) 
Poll: are you two a couple of incompetent dingbats?
Yes, yes, yes, or Bea Arthur?

 KANG SAE JUNG/GENERAL_TIU 
Er…

 HELLOLEGEND 
Never mind!
 (thinks) 
We must find him and crush him before
he betrays our secret.
 (pause) 
What is our secret again? I know, I’ll poll for it.
Poll: What is our secret, is it (a) …

KANG SAE JUNG and GENERAL_TIU groan to themselves.

 EXT. – HONOLULU – G.BONE’S APARTMENT BLOCK – DAY 

We see G.BONE, still panting with the exertion, ride his bike up to the bottom to the block of flats and tie it to the railings. He gets out and runs through the front door and up the stairs.

 INT. – G.BONE’S APARTMENT – DAY 

G.BONE’s apartment is decorated with a curiously eclectic mix of Imperial German flags and Granadine rugs with all those complex Islamic mathematical designs.

There are several surfboards with different designs on, usually left randomly lying about, although one is mounted on a table with an iron plugged in next to it and a crumpled T-shirt on top.

The apartment is in a state of organised chaos. G.BONE throws himself down on a battered but comfortable-looking easy chair, then lets out his breath in a long sigh.

 G.BONE 
Close one. Grody to the max.

G.BONE shrugs and we CUT TO his point of view – in front of him is a GIGANTIC STEAMPUNK TELEVISION SET, a huge oak cabinet with steam hissing from the sides through what look like organ pipes, and a relatively small screen in the middle. A huge aerial, looking like a missing part of the Eiffel Tower, protrudes from the top.

G.BONE starts hunting down the side of his chair.

 G.BONE 
 (muttering to himself) 
Where’s that remote control…
Ah! Here it is!

He pulls out what looks like a metal pipe, then keeps pulling and pulling (ludicrously) until about five feet’s worth has emerged, with a bend in the end. Smiling, he extends it in front of him, inserts the other end into a socket on the front of the huge TV–and it locks in place. He then starts turning the end in his hand and the TV crackles with power – it’s a starting handle. Puffing with the effort, he winds it up and the screen flashes, then the valves slowly begin to warm up with a hum.

 G.BONE 
 (panting) 
Whoever said the televisor screen would make
everyone obese from lack of exercise…?!

While the TV warms up, G.BONE gets up, goes to a cupboard and pulls out a box of cereal, a bottle of milk (strangely reddish in colour) and a spoon. He pours the cereal out, and we see from the box that it’s called “Cap’n Cook”, while the cereal itself is, disturbingly, in the shape of little human body parts. He pours the red milk on top, then begins eating it with the spoon, cruching away, as he sits down again.

 G.BONE 
That’s better.

The TV finally warms up and a newsreader – a stiff Edwardian type – appears on the screen.

 NEWSREADER 
Good day to you all, ladies and gentlemen.
I now bring you the grave news that an alleged
drug baron and trafficker, Mr. H. Legend, is
wanted by the Royal Californian Mounted Police
for his activities, but King Homahomawu’uuma has
refused to extradite this individual unless evidence
is presented in a Californian court.
 (pause) 
It has been reported that the only known witness
named by the police, a Mr A. Huaharen, was found
beaten to death earlier to-day; police are so far
not treating the incident as suspicious.

 G.BONE 
 (worriedly) 
Bogus happenings.
 (happily) 
Just as well I don’t have anything to
do with any of it!

As he grins, the door behind him is smashed off its hinges. G.BONE’s expression remains fixed as he turns around.

Two muscular gun-toting Asians in leather, SLEEPAHOLICAGENT and WHATISAUSERNAME, enter. G.BONE quickly throws himself behind his chair.

 WHATISAUSERNAME 
 (leering at him) 
What do we have here? A witness?
Can’t have that, can we?

 SLEEPAHOLICAGENT 
 (distractedly) 
Yeah…

 WHATISAUSERNAME 
 (frowning, in a mutter to SLEEPAHOLICAGENT) 
What? You’re supposed to keep up
your end of the whole ‘stereotypical thug’ banter!

 SLEEPAHOLICAGENT 
Yeah…sorry…
It’s just these leather outfits are…
 really distracting…

 WHATISAUSERNAME 
 (coughs pointedly) 
Ahem. ‘Come out come out wherever
you are, little birdy!’ and other such nonsense.

G.BONE remains perfectly still, but as we watch, a spilled bit of Cap’n Cook falls from his shirt and hits the floor with an absurdly loud CRUNCH.

 WHATISAUSERNAME 
That’s him!

 SLEEPAHOLICAGENT 
Give it to him hot and molten!

 WHATISAUSERNAME 
Yeah!…what?

The two of them shrug at each other, draw their AK-47s and begin blazing away at the chair. G.BONE ducks and dives behind a surfboard as the chair disintegrates under the full automatic fire. The gunfire tracks towards him, but the surfboard deflects it and SLEEPAHOLICAGENT ducks as a rebounding bullet speeds over his head.

 SLEEPAHOLICAGENT 
Stop shooting! You nearly gave me a centre parting!

 WHATISAUSERNAME 
 (stops shooting) 
Sorry.

G.BONE turns around, still holding the surfboard over him.

 G.BONE 
 (trying to be defiant) 
Hah! You weren’t expecting me to own a Cunard Lines-made
surfboard reinforced with lead, basalt and big rocks, were you?

 WHATISAUSERNAME 
I tire of this. Toss the bomb in and we’ll be done with him.

 SLEEPAHOLICAGENT 
Is that a euphemism for something?

 WHATISAUSERNAME 
 (grinding his teeth) 
No.

SLEEPAHOLICAGENT shrugs and takes a large round grenade from his pocket. He is about to pull the pin, when he pauses.

 SLEEPAHOLICAGENT 
Should I…?

 WHATISAUSERNAME 
NO! No unoriginal Monty Python references!

 SLEEPAHOLICAGENT 
Okay.

We cut to G.BONE as, in the background, SLEEPAHOLICAGENT pulls the pin and prepares to throw the grenade.

 G.BONE 
Oh kuma’hullu’ahua! 
If I ever needed a hero…

As he thinks the thought, suddenly SLEEPAHOLICAGENT crumples and drops the grenade!

WHATISAUSERNAME spins around, bringing up his gun and blazing away. But, unbelievably, the bullets seem to slow down and melt to dust around the NEW FIGURE he is shooting at. The figure is not particularly tall or strong-looking but he radiates a sense of pure power.

“Holding Out For A Hero” plays in the background…

As we watch, the HERO takes a step towards WHATISAUSERNAME, then another, as bullets simply fade from existence all around him. WHATISAUSERNAME’s gun clicks empty, and snarling in frustration, he hurls it at the HERO.

The HERO grabs the gun from midair, and with a casual, contemptuous twist of his hands, snaps it in two and throws the two parts to one side. They land near G.BONE, still holding onto his surfboard.

 G.BONE 
 (looking at the twisted and broken Kalashnikov) 
Cooooooolll…

WHATISAUSERNAME draws a knife and lashes out at the HERO, who moves far faster, grabbing his knife hand in such a way that WHATISAUSERNAME pales and the knife falls from his nerveless fingers. Behind the HERO we see SLEEPAHOLICAGENT rising to his feet, rubbing a bruise on the back of his head – but the HERO swings WHATISAUSERNAME’s whole body in an arc, with superhuman strength, and slams him into SLEEPAHOLICAGENT!

The two henchmen crash back against the wall, stunned. The HERO pats his hands together in satisfaction. G.BONE cautiously rises from behind the surfboard.

 G.BONE 
Whoa! Totally bodacious!

 HERO 
 (Middle American accent) 
I thank you, Mr Bone.
But now we must leave this place.

 G.BONE 
 (pointing vaguely) 
Umm, yeah, especially since, you know, that grenade…

The HERO’s eyes track to the dropped grenade of SLEEPAHOLICAGENT, beeping away, the beeps growing louder and more frequent.

 HERO 
Shit.

The HERO suddenly runs forward from a standing start, quickly reaching a terrific speed – he grabs the surprised G.BONE and the two of them SMASH through the window and out into the air –

 EXT. – OUTSIDE G.BONE’S APARTMENT BLOCK – DAY 

The HERO zooms out of G.BONE’s shattering window and arcs down to the ground, in a controlled manner as though he can almost fly. As they hit the ground and roll over and over, the whole apartment block suddenly EXPLODES SPECTACULARLY as the grenade goes off!

G.BONE scrambles to his feet and looks on in disbelief as the burning building begins to collapse.

 HERO 
 (about to run into the building) 
People are in danger…

 G.BONE 
Um, actually, everyone’s away at
 Pall’kualla’zhualla’maal day for the
 Kal’huuaahhl’allhua festival.
I was the only one there…and those two goons.

 HERO 
They’re already toast, and they’d have got
the chair anyway, with what they’ve done.

The HERO brushes himself down – we notice he wears a discreet dark suit – and shakes G.BONE’s hand.

 HERO 
Pleased to meet you, Mr Bone.

 G.BONE 
And you, uh…

 HERO 
 (smiles) 
I do not normally go by a name.
I am a super-soldier created by the government
of the Republic of Michigan for special missions
such as this. The first success of the project, after 54 failures…

CUT TO –

 DETROIT CAR FACTORY – DAY 

A brief scene of 54 other identical cloned heroes boredly squeezing rivets.

RETURN

 HERO 
So…call me…
 Super55 .

G.BONE shakes his hand, winces at the other’s strength.

 G.BONE 
Sure. Thanks for saving my life.
 (pause) 
What am I going to do now? All my stuff was in there!

 SUPER55 
Your stuff is the least of your concerns, Mr Bone.
You witnessed HelloLegend killing the witness.
Now you are a witness to his crimes.
Legend won’t stop until you’re dead.

 G.BONE 
 (glancing around nervously) 
Not good! What do I do?

 SUPER55 
Come with me to the Dominion of California.
If you give evidence in a Californian court,
Legend is finished and you’ll be safe.

 G.BONE 
I’m…not sure…

As he speaks, we hear gunfire – around the corner, we see GENERAL_TIU and KANG SAE JEUNG approaching on Hyundai motorbikes, heavily armed. KANG SAE JEUNG has a rocket launcher, and as we watch, he fires – a rocket blazes across the sky, narrowly misses G.BONE and SUPER55 as SUPER55 drags them to the floor, and explodes against a nearby building, destroying it.

 SUPER55 
Come with me if you want to live!

 G.BONE 
Okay!

SUPER55 hoists G.BONE on his back and and begins running. Bullets fly all around him but never seem to penetrate.

 SUPER55 
To the skies!

SUPER55 pulls a tag on his belt and rocket jets ignite from the soles of his boots – he and G.BONE rise into the air and go rocketing off into the distance. KANG SAE JEUNG and GENERAL_TIU come to a halt, still firing at the retreating shape in the sky, before stopping.

 GENERAL_TIU 
The boss is not going to like this.

 KANG SAE JEUNG 
Maybe if we gave him the bad news in a good way?

Clock wipe to

 INT. – HELLOLEGEND’S LAIR – NIGHT 

HELLOLEGEND is sitting in the middle of the darkened room, in which drug syringes are stacked alternately with Star Trek and Golden Girls DVDs in racks. Tapestries with Chinese characters on them hang behind him: the characters appear to spell out this season’s baseball scores.

GENERAL_TIU and KANG SAE JEUNG stand nervously before him.

 GENERAL_TIU 
So, in summary,

 KANG SAE JEUNG 
The State of Arizona has made posting compulsory,

 GENERAL_TIU 
 (quickly) 
G. Bone escaped when he was rescued by a superhero,

 KANG SAE JEUNG 
- and everyone has joined the US Navy.

HELLOLEGEND leaps to his feet, holding a revolver. The two of them both take steps back.

 HELLOLEGEND 
Poll: do you think I’m stupid?
Yes, no, sock puppet, sock puppet?

 KANG SAE JEUNG 
Er –

 HELLOLEGEND 
Don’t you think I can tell when you’re
trying to bury bad news?
 (incensed) 
For this you die!

He shoots and kills…KANG SAE JEUNG, who collapses.

 HELLOLEGEND 
 (contemptuously) 
US Navy opening up recruitment to all…
only VALUED CONTRIBUTORS of a
SUPERIOR RACE such as myself should
be allowed to join!

GENERAL_TIU takes another nervous step backwards.

 GENERAL_TIU 
Er…

 HELLOLEGEND 
Yes, yes, the Bone business.
Find out what he is up to.
He has not escaped yet…

HELLOLEGEND lights a cigar, then puts the lighted end into his mouth. GENERAL_TIU stares for a moment, then flees.

 

 

 

 END ACT I 

 

 

 ACT II 

 

 

 

 EXT. – HONOLULU AERODROME – DAY 

The next day. SUPER55 and G.BONE are walking between terminals. All around them are gigantic metal towers with huge AIRSHIPS docked to them. Occasionally there are a few biplanes, but it’s mostly airships. G.BONE keeps staring all around him.

 SUPER55 
 (pointing at the airships) 
We’ll take the Ludendorff to St. Francis.

 G.BONE 
Coolness! And you’re sure we’ll be safe.

 SUPER55 
 (laughs lightly) 
Of course! It’s an airship!
What could possibly go wrong?

 G.BONE 
 (abashed) 
Yeah.

The two of them walk towards the Ludendorff , a giant airship with an Imperial German iron cross painted on the tail fins and the name in Fraktur script along the side. It has a large passenger gondola and four propeller nacelles.

 INT. – AIRSHIP LUDENDORFF – COCKPIT – DAY 

The cockpit is at the front of the passenger gondola. In many ways it looks more like the bridge of a cruise liner: the crew wear naval-type uniforms, there’s a big ship’s wheel in the middle, etc. The bridge is surrounded on three sides by huge windows, affording a good view of the airport. In the distance, we can see the figures of G.BONE and SUPER55 walking towards the airship across the concrete.

The camera pans around and we get a view of the crewmen on the bridge…

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
 (wearing a captain’s uniform) 
Alright, everyone, chop chop!
Remember, you represent the honour and integrity
of the Kaiserreichsluftverkehr !

His first officer, Commander EUIO, takes a step backward with a wince to avoid QIANLONG’s spitting the last word.

 EUIO 
Yes, sir. Have you reviewed the passenger list?

EMPEROR QIANLONG gives a cursory glance to the piece of paper that EUIO hands over. His eyes widen and they track backwards, re-reading.

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
We’re carrying…fifty young ladies suffering
from a particularly acute form of nymphomania
to one of Dr Freud’s conferences on diseases of the mind?!

In the background, we hear a stampede. EMPEROR QIANLONG turns around, an expression of glazed inevitability on his face, to find that his entire crew – except stewardess LJD767 – is wedged in the doorway of the bridge.

 LJD767 
 (smirking) 
Typical men…anyway, that’s the next flight’s list.

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
 (squints at date) 
Ah yes, you are correct.
 (with feeling) 
Scheisse.

EUIO picks himself up ruefully and orders the rest of the crew back into position.

 EUIO 
What of this flight’s list, then?

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
 (shrugs) 
It is of no import, I daresay.
Let’s just begin the preflight checks.

EUIO nods. Dramatic fade to…

 INT. – HELLOLEGEND’S LAIR – NIGHT 

HELLOLEGEND and GENERAL_TIU are walking down an aisle in what looks like some kind of warehouse-type storage facility, with all the shelves filled with crates. Most of them are labelled with the names of different drugs, but others indicate they contain guns, explosives or other supplies.

 HELLOLEGEND 
 (half to himself) 
Bah. So Bone escaped us.
They plan to take him to California, to testify.
 (laughs madly) 
But…he shall not arrive!

 GENERAL_TIU 
 (laughs nervously along with him) 
No…he shall not!

HELLOLEGEND suddenly spins around and talks threateningly in GENERAL_TIU’s face.

 HELLOLEGEND 
 (quiet menace) 
In this warehouse, I have many things capable of killing a man.
Guns. Bombs. Missiles. Rockets. Subtle explosives.
Enough funds, from our narcotics, to hire the best
assassins in Hawaii or California.
 (smiles coldly) 
So, poll: which shall I use to try and kill G.Bone?

GENERAL_TIU hesitates, biting his lip as he thinks about it.

 GENERAL_TIU 
 (slowly, hesitantly) 
You’ll…use some kind of…crazy, wacky untested plan
with hints of bizarre randomness?

HELLOLEGEND glares in his face; then his expression abruptly snaps into a smile and he pats GENERAL_TIU patronisingly on the head.

 HELLOLEGEND 
Well done! The racially impure
Korean can learn a trick after all!
Much like his lunch.

HELLOLEGEND turns away and, almost at random, grabs a crate off the shelf. It wobbles around, as though something inside is fighting to get out. GENERAL_TIU looks uncertain as HELLOLEGEND impatiently hands it to him.

 GENERAL_TIU 
What is it?

 HELLOLEGEND 
The one thing the anti-nihilist
police will never suspect, of course!
The rare Chinese Lesser Spotted Sealion…
deadly to all forms of life!

GENERAL_TIU looks sceptical and pops up the lid of the crate.

Instantly, a sleek furry head, with maddened eyes, shoots up out of the crate and bites him hard on the nose. Blood flows freely as GENERAL_TIU screams and runs round and round, fighting desperately to tear the SEALION from his nose. HELLOLEGEND watches approvingly.

 HELLOLEGEND 
We Chinese invented murder, you know…

Another crazed, spitting SEALION crawls onto HELLOLEGEND’s arm, and he begins stroking it, Blofeld-style.

 HELLOLEGEND 
 (softly) 
G.Bone is a dead man.

In the background, we see GENERAL_TIU – the SEALION still attached to his nose – go flying into a massive pile of metal crates, which comes crashing down on top of him. HELLOLEGEND sighs pointedly.

 HELLOLEGEND 
You just can’t find good help these days.

Cut to:

 EXT. – HONOLULU AERODROME – NIGHT 

The Ludendorff looms large over the aerodrome, lit by spotlights. Its gondola is lit from the inside and the propellors on its nacelles have begun turning slowly. At the back, though, cargo is still being loaded. We see a large number of huge Victorian-style travel trunks on a trolley, which an airport worker – RAMP-RAT – is pushing towards the airship.

There’s a shadow, a sudden movement – and RAMP-RAT falls, stunned from a blow on the back of the head. His attacker emerges into the spotlight – it takes a moment to realise that it’s GENERAL-TIU, as his head is now so swathed in bloody bandages that he looks like an Egyptian mummy from a cutprice horror film.

 GENERAL_TIU 
 (mutters) 
Next time, I’m working for someone more
in touch with reality, like Fernidad of Prussia…

GENERAL_TIU begins pulling trunks off the trolley and replacing them with the slightly vibrating reinforced metal crates we saw before, each containing a SEALION.

He then pushes the trolley towards the airship, and we see other airport workers taking it from him; the trolley is pushed up the ramp and into the airship’s cargo hold.

GENERAL_TIU retreats back to where he left the trunks strewn around, and sits down on a random one, watching the airship.

 INT. – LUDENDORFF – NIGHT 

SUPER55 sits sedately in his chair, looking suspiciously at the other passengers. G.BONE, on the other hand, has his whole face glued to the window as he watches the takeoff procedure in awe. The interior of the compartment is marvellously luxurious, everything wood-panelled, with an antique-looking map of the world on the far wall and comfortable easy chairs to sit in. The rest of the passengers mostly look like they’re living the high life.

The door at the front of the gondola opens and LJD767 walks in, wearing her stewardess uniform with a jaunty hat. The eyes of approximately 55% of the passengers track her.

 LJD767 
Guten tag, mein herren und damen, and
danke for flying Imperial Airways!
If for any reason we should have to make
an emergency exit from the vehicle – after,
of course, changing into evening dress and
a light repast of coffee and port – then the
escape hatches are located one foot to the right of Helga –
 (points to the right on one side of the gondola) 
- and one foot to the left of Gertrude -
 (points to the left; the gondola walls are quite a long way apart) 

We pan across to where the ALT-MrP and ALT-TORQUMADA are observing the proceedings from their chairs; ALT-MrP’s pipe is putting out smoke frantically, the only visible sign that he’s excited.

 ALT-MrP 
 (in deceptively idle tones) 
I daresay you don’t get many of those to the pound.

 ALT-TORQUMADA 
Or to the dollar, good sir!
 (sidelong glance) 
Now, perhaps, I may venture, do you recognise the
veracity of my own position on the important issue
of the Mammary Standard?

 ALT-MrP 
 (quenches his pipe with a sigh) 
Well, I cannot deny that the good lady makes a persuasive argument.
 (ponders for a moment) 
Or perhaps two of them.

LJD767 winks at ALT-MrP and his starched collar spontaneously bursts open; ALT-TORQUMADA smiles.

We pan back across to G.BONE, who’s still looking out of the window.

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
 (VO, on tannoy) 
We have liftoff!

 EXT. – HOLOLULU AERODROME – NIGHT 

The guide ropes fall away as the Ludendorff disconnects from its mooring tower. Propellors beating the air, the mighty airship slowly, majestically, rises into the night sky over Hawaii. A spotlight briefly illuminates the Iron Cross painted on her tail fins. In the background, we can see other airships, some painted with Union Jacks, some with Confederate Southern Crosses, some with Ottoman red crescents.

Below them all we see GENERAL_TIU, cackling and rubbing his hands together as he remains seated on the trunk.

 GENERAL_TIU 
A voyage of the damned…

GENERAL_TIU takes out his fob watch and frowns at the face.

 GENERAL_TIU 
Let’s see…the clockwork locks
should be opening themselves…
just about…now.

 INT. – LUDENDORFF – CARGO HOLD – NIGHT 

We see GENERAL_TIU’s wobbling crates stacked up next to the trunks of the passenger luggage. As we watch, clockwork mechanisms click and whirr, and the lids of the crates slide back. Many pairs of malevolent eyes glow in the darkness, and then we hear the silky sounds of the Sealions lolloping out of their boxes…

 EXT. – HOLOLULU AERODROME – NIGHT 

GENERAL_TIU continues to cackle, and the sound almost covers another clockwork click, this one a little closer than most.

His laugh dies away as, with a fixed expression, he glances down. The ‘trunk’ he’s sitting on is, in fact, a forgotten Sealion crate. And the lid has just slid back to reveal a pair of gleaming eyes.

 GENERAL_TIU 
How unfortunate.

We change camera angles and see things only in silhouette as GENERAL_TIU goes flying fifty feet straight upwards, a Chinese Sealion’s teeth embedded in his buttocks. As he hurtles through the air, he is struck by the propellor of a passing triplane and turned to chunky salsa.

Dramatic fade…

 INT. – LUDENDORFF – CABIN–NIGHT 

The atmosphere is not unlike that on an OTL night flight, but rather more refined. G.BONE sticks out like a sore thumb as he fiddles excitedly with the gramophone record player fitted into the back of the seat in front of his; SUPER55 frowns at him, and in the background we can see a sign saying ‘PASSENGERS ARE REMINDED THAT USE OF MR BELL’S ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH ON THE AIRSHIP IS CONSIDERED MOST UNGENTLEMANLY .’

 SUPER55 
Calm yourself, please, Mr Bone.

 G.BONE 
Sorry, dude, it’s just – this rocks!

 SUPER55 
 (smiling thinly) 
Of course it is. It’s an airship.

SUPER55 grins contentedly and leans back in his comfortable seat, as G.BONE finds the chess set built into the arm rest and begins frantically playing himself.

The camera pans upwards and through the ceiling…

 INT. – LUDENDORFF –INSIDE BULKHEAD 

The Sealions, barely visible except by their glowing eyes, creep through the space in the bulkheads, accompanied by the wet sounds of flippers on metal…

 EXT. – LUDENDORFF – AIR 

We see the airship leaving the islands of Hawaii far below and entering the blank blueness of the Pacific Ocean.

 INT.– LUDENDORFF – COCKPIT 

EMPEROR QIANLONG gently guides the ship’s wheel.

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
Our course, Mr. Vowels?

 EUIO 
 (looks up from his set square) 
North-east by east, sir.

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
Good. Engage the auto-pilot.

EUIO takes out a huge padlock and clamps the wheel in place.

 EUIO 
Cards, sir?

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
Why not? And have Ell-Jay fetch some port.

EUIO grins and leaves; EMPEROR QIANLONG sits back in his captain’s chair.

 INT.– LUDENDORFF – CABIN 

G.BONE is now looking bored. Over on the other side, we see a furtive-looking ALT-KIT as he glances out of the window, then seems to nod to himself and gets up out of his chair. He walks over towards an ornate door labelled ‘water-closet’ and opens it.

 INT.– LUDENDORFF – TOILET 

We find that one of the airship’s officers, ALT-FELL (in full uniform) is seated on the golden cistern, idly perusing a trashy paperback with pirates on the cover. He puts it down as ALT-KIT enters.

 ALT-FELL 
 (stiffly) 
Evening, sir. Lost, are we?

 ALT-KIT 
 (glancing around in a paranoid fashion) 
Not…exactly.

 ALT-FELL 
 (quirks an eyebrow) 
Might I then be correct in assuming that,
in fact, you are hoping to connect with
another gentleman who shares certain,
shall we say, unorthodox views?

 ALT-KIT 
 (relieved) 
Indeed I am!

 ALT-FELL 
 (leans back contentedly) 
Well then. Why must we tarry? Let’s have it.

 ALT-KIT 
You mean…you’re a socialist too?

ALT-KIT takes out a rolled-up copy of the Manchester Guardian from his pocket and unrolls it hopefully. But ALT-FELL goes purple in the face with outrage.

 ALT-FELL 
 (pointing) 
Out! Out! I will not have your sort in here!

Disappointed, ALT-KIT turns around – and comes face to face with a CHINESE SEALION as it drops through a hole in the ceiling.

 ALT-FELL 
Good heavens, what -

Cut to:

 INT.– LUDENDORFF – CABIN 

The corridor outside the water-closet; we hear banging around inside, screams and shouts, and vicious hisses, and red liquid starts to pool under the door…

 EXT.– LUDENDORFF – SKY–NIGHT 

The sky and sea around the airship are now totally featureless as it slowly travels across the Pacific.

 INT.– LUDENDORFF – BRIDGE 

EMPEROR QIANLONG and EUIO are bent over a table playing cards, with glasses of port beside them. Behind them, the clamped wheel occasionally clanks in protest against its hold.

 EUIO 
 (slaps down his cards) 
You win again, sir.

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
 (smiles) 
Of course.

EMPEROR QIANLONG raises his glass.

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
A toast – to a nice uneventful fligh-

LJD767 suddenly bursts in.

 LJD767 
Sir, there’s a problem!

EMPEROR QIANLONG closes his eyes with a sigh.

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
I knew it was too good to be true…
 (turns to LJD767) 
All right, what is it? What’s wrong?

 LJD767 
The pressure sensors on gasbag 4 have gone offline,
as though there’s a problem with the cable.

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
Can’t you get young Nelson to fix it?

 LJD767 
He’s…gone missing. Again.

 EUIO 
I don’t know what he thinks he’s playing at!

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
I wish I didn’t!
 (sighs) 
Very well, very well.

EUIO pulls an access panel off the wall and EMPEROR QIANLONG climbs into it.

 INT. – IN THE ACCESS TUBE 

EMPEROR QIANLONG crawls through the dusty Bakelite-lined tube; we see pneumatic cables all around him, stretching from the pressure gauges back to the gasbags themselves.

His hand closes on a frayed and shredded cable, which he picks up and glances at.

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
 (half to himself) 
Here’s the problem. Something’s bitten through it.
But what? Looks too big to be a rat…

There’s a hissing sound in front of him and he glances up.

 EMPEROR QIANLONG 
Oh -

Cut to: INT.– LUDENDORFF – BRIDGE 

EUIO and LJD767 watch in confusion as echoing sounds of clanging and banging come up the access tube. Then, suddenly, a bloodstained captain’s hat comes flying out and rebounds against the opposite wall.

They both stare at it.

 LJD767 
What…the…

 EUIO 
Well, on the plus side, at least I get back
all that money I lost…

 INT.– LUDENDORFF – CABIN 

G.BONE, humming to himself and with a comic book folded under one arm, walks along the corridor to the water-closet. He opens the door – we don’t see exactly what he sees, but behind him a woman, ELADRIMSTAR, screams and passionately faints into a man’s arms.

 G.BONE 
Bogus!

SUPER55 is suddenly at his elbow. In one glance he takes in the situation.

 SUPER55 
Shit! That’s the work of Chinese Sealions.
HelloLegend is behind this for sure.
 (shakes his head and turns around) 
This is serious. Where’s the captain?

EMPEROR QIANLONG’s bloodied hat is dropped at his feet. He looks up at an ashen-faced EUIO.

 SUPER55 
I… see… 

Behind him, we hear vague murmurs going through the passengers, who are all standing up to watch – increasing rumours of panic…

 SUPER55 
 (turning to face the passengers) 
All right, calm down…

 ELADRIMSTAR 
 (momentarily wakes up) 
Calm down, he says! When we might be murdered in our beds!
 (she faints dramatically again) 

 SUPER55 
Listen, I…

 PASSENGERS 
 (all at once, confusion) 
We’re all going to die! / We’re going to crash! /
Be eaten by / be torn apart by / we…

SUPER55, his expression set, pulls out a gun and fires it upwards with a BANG. The room is suddenly silent with horror.

 SUPER55 
All right! We are not going to panic!
We are going to deal with this situation
in an orderly and civilised manner!

ALT-MrP rises to his feet and claps perfunctorily, in a vicar-at-a-village-fete sort of way.

 ALT-MrP 
Well said, sir, well said!
Let us not act like heathen savages, but as
proud members of the superior Western civilisation!

 ALT-TORQUMADA 
 (nudging ALT-P’s arm) 
You’ll notice, however, that he had to
use a gun to make his point.

 ALT-MrP 
Bah, details.

As they argue, G.BONE turns to SUPER55.

 G.BONE 
Hey, awesome dude – how come you didn’t
just shoot a hole in the gasbag?

 SUPER55 
 (shows him the gun) 
Specially slowed rounds. Still effective,
but they won’t punch through the hull of this gondola.
Safe to use on board airship. Standard Michigander Army issue.

 G.BONE 
Cool.

 SUPER55 
Now, come on. To the bridge!

 INT. – LUDENDORFF – BRIDGE 

EUIO is frantically doing sums on a piece of paper, while the wheel continues clunking on its lock. SUPER55 and G.BONE enter.

 SUPER55 
What’s our status?

 EUIO 
Bad! We’re still two hours out from California,
and who knows how many of those things we’ve got on board?

 SUPER55 
They must have come from the cargo hold.
Snook on board…

 G.BONE 
Um, does it matter now?

 SUPER55 
It might.
 (turns to EUIO) 
Have you any hydrogen on this airship?

 EUIO 
 (bursts out laughing) 
Hydrogen? On an airship ?
Are you mad??

 SUPER55 
All right, all right, I know it was far-fetched,
it was just an idea.

 EUIO 
Wait, though…there
is the propane we use
for the engines…

 SUPER55 
 (smiles) 
That works too.

 G.BONE 
What are you going to…
 (sudden realisation) 
Oh.
 (very quietly) 
Crap.

 INT.– LUDENDORFF – CABIN 

The passengers have calmed down a bit, but are still nervy and glancing around. In one corner, though, we see an unconcerned looking KID, MIKE ONEAL 5, who is energetically playing away on a machine the size of a typewriter, which to some extent it resembles. As he presses the clicking keys and we hear a wheeze of steam, though, on top of the machine regularly-shaped metal blocks are slowly lowered into position from above by a complex arrangement of pulleys and strings. There’s a regular ‘ding’ sound in the background.

It is, in fact, a steampunk version of Tetris.

 MIKE ONEAL 5 
Come on, come on, come on…

But he misses the combination of blocks and the game ends.

 MIKE ONEAL 5 
Dammit!

He grabs the machine up in the air and hurls it down in frustration – hitting a SEALION on the head just before it was about to attack him. MIKE ONEAL 5 stares in realisation as the SEALION slumps dazedly.

 MIKE ONEAL 5 
Crap!

The whole cabin dissolves into pandemonium as SEALIONS suddenly start bursting out of the walls and dropping from the ceiling. We see several passengers set upon by SEALIONS, biting and tearing away at them, blood all over the floor. ALT-MrP, unconcerned, simply stands back behind ALT-TORQ as the latter draws a huge handgun and begins blazing away.

 ALT-MrP 
A most unfortunate series of events, dear boy.

 ALT-TORQ 
 (narrowing his eyes as he aims) 
I can only concur.

A SEALION springs for the two of them, but ALT-TORQ catches it in mid-flight with a bullet. The SEALION falls to the ground, stunned but not dead.

 ALT-MrP 
Tough little rascals, aren’t they?

SUPER55 appears in the doorway.

 SUPER55 
Alright, alright! Everyone up to the bridge!

There’s a stampede, and he would be run over, were it not for his sheer awesomeness. As the cabin empties, we see the many bodies and stunned Sealions on the ground…then it’s just SUPER55, ALT-MrP, ALT-TORQ, and the spitting SEALIONS.

 SUPER55 
You two! With me!

ALT-MrP and ALT-TORQ nod as LJD767 walks in and shoves a trolley towards SUPER55. SUPER55 manhandles a gas cylinder on top of it.

 SUPER55 
You two have to keep them off me while I get this in place!

 ALT-MrP 
Roger that, old boy!

 ALT-TORQ 
 (sizing up SUPER55) 
Y’all’s crazy, but it’s a good crazy.

SUPER55 grins. He grabs the trolley and begins pushing it down the aisle of the now deserted cabin. From the seats all around him, crazed SEALIONS, frothing at the mouth, leap out at him, but ALT-TORQ’s bullets knock them back. We see ALT-MrP hurling model metal Napoleonic soldiers at them, too.

 ALT-MrP 
 (looking at the ceiling) 
May Surak forgive me…

SUPER55 pulls his own gun as he reaches the end of the corridor and the back of the gondola. SEALIONS continue to attack him, but he shoots off a few more, beating a fighting retreat back to the front.

 SUPER55 
Almost there…almost…

Cut to:

 INT. – HELLOLEGEND’S LAIR – NIGHT 

 HELLOLEGEND 
 (cackling) 
And just to make sure, I’ll put in
a particularly large specimen…

Cut back to:

 INT.–LUDENDORFF – CABIN 

There’s a horrible creaking sound, and the ceiling almost directly above ALT-TORQ and ALT-MrP splinters apart. A GIANT SEALION comes crashing through the ceiling and lands next to them. With one flipper, it suddenly grabs hold of ALT-MrP and stuffs him into its mouth, its vicious fangs tearing into him.

 ALT-MrP 
 (calmly, as he’s being ripped apart) 
Well, this is all rather unfortunate.

 ALT-TORQ 
 (incoherent bellow of rage) 
Death to you, foul beast!

The GIANT SEALION is shot several times by ALT-TORQ and SUPER55, but this only seems to make it angry. It applauds angrily, gulping down ALT-MrP, and then take a threatening move towards ALT-TORQ. The floor beneath it creaks alarmingly.

 SUPER55 
(thinking)
Torq, get back!

 ALT-TORQ 
No! I won’t let it!

 SUPER55 
Trust me! Get back!

ALT-TORQ hesitates, glancing at him, then nods reluctantly.

 ALT-TORQ 
But only because you’re so awesome.

Nodding distractedly, SUPER55 puts himself between ALT-TORQ and the GIANT SEALION, which continues to approach – the floor creaks and groans. SUPER55 glances around desperately and spies a sand-filled fire bucket on the wall.

 SUPER55 
Should be heavy enough!

SUPER55 grabs the fire bucket and hurls it at the GIANT SEALION, which unexpectedly catches it in midair and cradles it in its flippers, a sudden expression of ecstatic bliss displacing its previous one of homicidal mania.

 GIANT SEALION 
(dreamily)
I Has A Bucket…

There’s a creak – SUPER55 holds his breath – and the whole bottom of the gondola breaks up as the GIANT SEALION goes crashing through, the sand bucket remaining comically behind in midair.

 GIANT SEALION 
(VO, rapidly dopplering away)
Nooo, they be stealing my bucket…

SUPER55 and ALT-TORQ hang on for dear life as the air rushes out of the gondola. But SUPER55 levels his gun at the propane cylinder on the trolley.

 SUPER55 
I have had it with these motherfuckin’ Sealions
on this motherfuckin’ airship!

 ALT-TORQ 
You’ve been waiting years to say that, haven’t you…

SUPER55 shrugs – and fires.

 EXT. – LUDENDORFF – OVER OCEAN 

In the distance, the sun and the coast of California are just visible. But now a jet of flame roars through the whole bottom of the gondola of the airship, blasting out through the new hole near the front, but also taking out most of the windows. We see burning Chinese Sealions go flying out of all the holes and, trailing fire, hurtle down towards the unforgiving waters of the Pacific…

 INT.–LUDENDORFF – BRIDGE 

The bridge is crammed with people. EUIO is desperately trying to unlock the wheel, using every possible combination on a huge keyring. Beside him, LJD767 uses her ample…charms to hold back the mass of rabble.

Off to one side, G.BONE is comfortably sitting back and reading his comic book.

 G.BONE 
That’ll be it now…

The whole bridge rocks from side to side and the lights flicker on and off as the WHOOMPH of the giant explosion is felt rather than heard.

 ELADRIMSTAR 
What’s he doing? Is he crazy?

 G.BONE 
He’s using propane to burn up the Sealions, and yes.

 ELADRIMSTAR 
But that’ll burn us up, too!

 EUIO 
 (turning around) 
Not…if we released the gasbags to flood this area with helium!
 (smiles) 
Which we did.

 G.BONE 
 (in Minnie Mouse voice) 
See? I bet you wouldn’t have thought of that!

 ELADRIMSTAR 
But doesn’t that mean we’re going down.

 EUIO 
‘Down’ is such a negative phrase…

 EXT.–LUDENDORFF SKY 

The flames finally fade from around the burnt-out gondola. We see the bridge has indeed survived, but the gasbags are contracting and the airship is rapidly losing height.

 INT.–LUDENDORFF – BRIDGE 

EUIO finally manages to unlock the wheel as we watch. Behind him, LJD767 is talking on the radio.

 LJD767 
That’s it. They’ve scrambled a circus of rescue biplanes.
You have a vector.

 EUIO 
 (nods) 
We’re home clear now.
 (sadly) 
Just a pity about Captain Qianlong and the others…
and those who gave their lives to save us…like Super55…

 G.BONE 
Don’t be too sure about that one, dude…

Unbelieving, everyone watches as the door slides open and SUPER55 – ALT-TORQ slung over his back – nonchalantly comes in. Aside from some burn marks on his clothes, he seems totally unharmed.

 EUIO 
You! But you…you were…

 SUPER55 
I’m Super55. That’s all that’s important.

Everyone nods solemnly.

 EXT. – SAN FRANCISCO BAY – MORNING 

On either side of the bay are huge flags – British Red Ensigns with a bear-paw symbol – and signs reading “THE DOMINION OF CALIFORNIA WELCOMES CAREFUL DRIVERS”.

As we watch, the airship, still partly on fire and totally out of control, drunkenly flies low over the mouth of the bay and clips the top of one of the flags and signs, ripping it loose.

 INT. – LUDENDORFF – BRIDGE 

EUIO holds on tight to the wheel as it tries to vibrate out of his hands, trying to keep it aimed on target.

 LJD767 
Two degrees up! One down!

 EUIO 
(through gritted teeth)
I hardly think now is the time to adjust the thermostat!

SUPER55 pats EUIO on the shoulder.

 SUPER55 
You’re doing fine, Captain Vowels. Nice and easy.

 EUIO 
(nods, as sweat trickles down his forehead)
Thanks, sir.
(loudly)
Everyone, get ready for the ride of your life!

Through the main window, we can see the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE approaching…

 EXT. – SAN FRANCISCO BAY – MORNING 

The deflated airship streaks through the sky, almost hits the Golden Gate Bridge but passes just under it, and collapses with a massive splash into the water. There’s just enough helium left to cushion the impact.

The camera pans over the crash scene as we see rescue biplanes trailing ropes and helping to take people off. SUPER55 rises on his rocket boots and helps bring others to safety. We watch him land, alongside G.BONE and EUIO, on the bridge.

 SUPER55 
 (slaps EUIO on the back) 
A nice clean landing, sir!

 EUIO 
Aside from the fact that we wrote off the airship.

 SUPER55 
Just add another tally to Mr HelloLegend’s bill.
It’s going to get pretty darn steep after Mr Bone
testifies in court, you know.

 G.BONE 
Sure.
 (with feeling) 
I know this—I’m never travelling by airship again.
 (sighs) 
I wish there was some amazing way of travelling
without using an airship, or a plane, or a ship or whatever.
Some…magical way of travelling instantaneously from
place to place without moving…if I ever found one, I’d
spend the rest of my life enjoying it…

 EUIO 
 (laughs) 
You sound like Jules Verne.

 G.BONE 
Maybe.
Okay, so where’s this court-

As he speaks, there’s a flash of light and he suddenly disappears with a ‘pop!’

EUIO and SUPER55 stare at where G.BONE was, then at each other, then at the sky.

 EUIO 
What just happened…?

 SUPER55 
I don’t know, but it’ll be a lot harder to convict HelloLegend
without Mr Bone’s testimony!

 EUIO 
Don’t worry. These things have a way of sorting themselves out…

Cut to

 EXT. – PACIFIC OCEAN – MORNING 

A powerboat races across the ocean, HELLOLEGEND on top manning the wheel – we see crates of drugs piled in the back.

 HELLOLEGEND 
(muttering to himself)
They’ll never catch me!
I’ll be in Tahiti by the time that
Boner bozo is singing in California!
(pats the wheel in front of him)
Hah, they all laughed at me when
I won that speedboat on the darts programme…

Behind HELLOLEGEND, we suddenly see dark shapes in the water all around him…malevolent eyes…scorched SEALIONS…

 HELLOLEGEND 
(oblivious)
And once I get to Tahiti, it’ll be time to
poll the locals about which is cooler,
Golden Girls, baseball, Arizona, Star Trek
or the US Navy?
(laughs)
Not as though their opinions matter of course,
with them being racially impure Polynesians…

Something huge suddenly rears up in front of HELLOLEGEND’s boat and it capsizes, the drug boxes flying everywhere. HELLOLEGEND is flung clear and struggles to stay afloat.

 HELLOLEGEND 
(spitting angrily)
What? Who dares attack such a
VALUED CONTRIBUTOR as myself?

The GIANT SEALION rears up before him once more, its eyes flaming with fury. Behind it, two smaller SEALIONS, all of them covered in burns, bare their teeth at HELLOLEGEND.

 GIANT SEALION 
Mah associates have informed me that you are in possession
OF MAH BUCKET!

 HELLOLEGEND 
No! You cannot kill me! I have EARNED MY SENIORITY
and I am HERE TO STAaaaaaarrrgghhh!!!!

As the camera pans away, the water turns red…

And then the camera continues heading upwards. We leave the ocean behind, then the sky, as it fades to black and stars begin to twinkle in it. The waters below suddenly seem to curve back and we see that the world is round. For a brief instant, the camera pans across what looks like a steampunk space station, made out of compartments launched as shells from a huge cannon – then further beyond, into the blackness of space…

And it comes across a certain well-remembered starship.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – TELEPORTER ROOM – DAY 

A slightly younger-looking DOCTOR WHAT is impatiently watching as DAVE HOWERY, sitting behind the controls of the teleporter, is awkwardly picking his way through one set of buttons after another.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Hurry up! How hard can it be?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Very, actually. The bastards who
built this thing didn’t have user-friendliness in mind.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
(shudders)
Don’t remind me.
(pause)
Look, all I want is a nice T-Bone steak, okay?
It’s not as though I’m asking for essentials like
booze and porn, for my sake!

 DAVE HOWERY 
(shrugs)
Alright, Doc, but don’t blame me if this doesn’t work…

DAVE HOWERY hits a random button, there’s a ‘pop!’, and a rather confused-looking G.BONE appears on the teleporter pad.

 G.BONE 
Um…hello?

DOCTOR WHAT turns threateningly on DAVE HOWERY.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
If he’s not at least carrying a Hawaiian pizza, you’re in trouble.

 G.BONE 
 (staring down at himself in amazement) 
Wow! It’s like magic! I was there and now I’m here!

 DAVE HOWERY 
Yeah, that’s the teleporter for you.

 G.BONE 
Teleporter? It sounds amazing!
Please can I try it myself? Can I can I can I?

DAVE HOWERY shrugs at DOCTOR WHAT.

 DAVE HOWERY 
I’d be happy to hand this thing over to someone dedicated.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Okay.
(to G.BONE)
Congratulations. You’re recruited.

 G.BONE 
Cool!
(pause)
Er…to what?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
The crew of the good ship AH.com.
 (claps him on the back) 
Now, get to work. Your first priority
is to find me a decent steak!

 G.BONE 
 (salutes smartly) 
Yes sirree! Wow, this is fascinating
enough to keep me occupied forever!

Fade to black.

Caption: “FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER”

G.BONE is sitting back lazily on the chair in the teleporter room, his feet up on the controls – the teleporter pads glowing and fritzing randomly as he moves the positions of his feet – and with a comic book open on his chest.

The intercom beeps.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (VO) 
Anything yet, Mr Bone?

 G.BONE 
Yeah, yeah, whatever…

G.BONE clicks off the intercom, then settles back to read.

 G.BONE 
Hmm, Betty or Veronica – one of the great
philosophical dilemmas of our times…

We see the smeary dreams effect in reverse as we return to the present. G.BONE stares up musingly at the ceiling as he concludes his story.

 G.BONE 
And – well, that’s it. That’s what it reminded me of.
 (shudders) 
Just as well those Sealions weren’t successful, though…

G.BONE suddenly looks down. MICHAEL and PSYCHO are still fighting each other – PSYCHO is now holding MICHAEL over the reactor core and trying to force his head into it, while DAVE HOWERY is still snoring in his hammock above it – and FLOCCULENCIO is turning the pages of his Karma Sutra with increasing avidity.

 G.BONE 
…dudes?

 FLOCC 
 (distractedly) 
Hmm? Oh, yes, a very fine tale, sirrah.
I especially like the part where the skunk
ate all those raspberries.

 G.BONE 
But there wasn’t a part with a skunk eating raspberries.

FLOCC looks at him over the top of his spectacles with the gently chiding manner of the schoolteacher.

 FLOCC 
 (firmly) 
I think you’ll find that there was.

 G.BONE 
 (confused) 
Uh…oh yes, of course there was.

G.BONE shrugs in puzzlement.

 G.BONE 
Sometimes I wonder if it was the right thing to do, joining this crew…

 FLOCC 
I think we all do, good sir. But then we remember how
uninteresting our lives were before the epic adventures
that crewing under Captain What can bring.

 G.BONE 
(stares at him)
Um…yeah, I guess.

In the background, MICHAEL suddenly manages to throw PSYCHO off his back – PSYCHO lands on top of DAVE HOWERY and awakes him with a start – KEIRA comes in, sees the scene and bursts into tears – MICHAEL smirks, then slips and falls off the reactor core with a cry –

 FLOCC 
 (as KEIRA starts beating PSYCHO) 
Excellent. Two fewer competitors for the pot.
Sixteen hours. Shall we split it like gentlemen?

 G.BONE 
Sure. I could use eight hours.
 (smiles dreamily to himself) 

 EXT. – AH.COM SHIP – SPACE 

As the AH.com Ship drifts through space…

 G.BONE 
(VO, singing into karaoke machine)
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena!
Que tu cuerpo es pa’darle alegria y cosa buena!
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena!
Heeeeey…Macarena!

 TEASER 

 

 

 
 

 INT- STUDIO- DAY 

The camera opens on a scene with PSYCHOMELTDOWN, DR. WHAT, THANDE, and DAVE HOWERY all sitting in chairs and looking guilty and ashamed. IAN is standing behind them, red glow, sunglasses, and all.

 IAN 
Welcome to another episode of AH.COM: The Series.
It has come to my attention that several of the so called
‘Writer Chimps’ have been taking advantage of their job
to make fun of a certain individual on the show. I speak,
of course, of LANDSHARK. This poor character has been
maligned from the start by these writers… especially this one.
 (smacks DAVE HOWERY on the back of the head) 
Since a new season of the Series is beginning, I think this
is a good time to rectify this before it gets too out of hand.
From now on, LANDSHARK shall change from a poorly
written generic ‘angry Brit’ to a much more cultured and
sophisticated gentleman.

MICHAEL walks into the scene.

 MICHAEL 
Hey, I’m a Writer Chimp too!

 IAN 
 (long pause) 
Who are you?

MICHAEL walks off, dejected.

 IAN 
For the new season, LANDSHARK will be the epitome of grace
and culture, appearing with a pipe in one hand and a 17th century
biographical book in the other. He shall be the master of dry
sophisticated wit, instead of the butt of so many crude American
style jokes that our supposedly distinguished EIC…
 (smacks PSYCHOMELTDOWN on the back of the head) 
…seems to prefer. I think all of you will find this to be a
vast improvement in the Series. Good day.

IAN disappears with a pop. The Writer Chimps look at each other.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Dang, he seems pissed. What are we going to do?

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
You mean, what are you going to do…
you’re writing this episode.

The other Writer Chimps all walk off camera, leaving DAVE HOWERY by himself. He pulls out a bunch of loose paper and a pen, and thinks for a moment.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Cultured and sophisticated… I can do that. Hmmm….

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- MED BAY- DAY 

TORQUMADA is seen in here, working on something. LANDSHARK suddenly comes in, looking very uncomfortable, and holding onto his butt. He massively breaks wind.

 LANDSHARK 
TORQ, you gotta (fart) help me!
I’ve come down with (fart) a case
of galloping (fart) flatulence!

 TORQUMADA 
How the hell did you contract that?!

 LANDSHARK 
I think it was (fart) on that Peshawar Lancers
 (fart) world, when IRONYUPPIE (fart) 
and I visited that (fart) whorehouse in (fart) Calcutta.

 TORQUMADA 
How many times do I have to tell you guys, come to me
right after you get back from whoring in primitive timelines.
Well, as it happens, there is a drug that would get rid of that
in an instant. Unfortunately, we don’t have any.
So, the best I can do is…

He rummages around in a drawer and finally pulls out a big cork.

 TORQUMADA 
At this point, all I can do is stick this in your anus
and wait for the disease to pass.

 LANDSHARK 
Are you (fart) kidding me? Oh, all right, (fart) 
if that’s all you can do. But, (fart) do you have a (fart) 
bigger one?

TORQUMADA pulls out a bigger cork.

 TORQUMADA 
How’s this?

 LANDSHARK 
That’s big (fart) enough, but do you (fart) 
have one that’s (fart) longer?

TORQUMADA pulls out a cork that is wide and nearly 8 inches long.

 TORQUMADA 
Will this do?

 LANDSHARK 
That’s long (fart) enough, but do you (fart) 
have one that’s (fart) curves to the left?

TORQUMADA pulls out a wide, long cork that makes a right angle half way up its length..

 TORQUMADA 
Will this do?

 LANDSHARK 
Oh yeah! Ram it up there!

 TORQUMADA 
Okay, let me find my mallet, and…

 INT- STUDIO- DAY 

DAVE HOWERY is pacing and writing feverishly, when IAN suddenly reappears out of thin air, a very wrathful look on his face. DAVE HOWERY looks up at him in horror, screams “Oh God!”, tosses his papers in the air, and runs off camera.

 IAN 
No… God would be merciful.

The red glow behind his sunglasses flares for a moment. Off camera, we hear a scream and a horrible sizzling sound. IAN looks pleased with himself for a moment, and then catches one of the falling papers. He reads it, and grins to himself.

 IAN 
Hee hee! Galloping flatulence… that is kind of funny.

 ACT I 

 

 

 
 

 EXT- SPACE 

The camera pans over a wide shot of the Earth from space, showing the area around Australia. As the shot moves away from Earth, we see a wormhole open up; the AH.COM emerges from it and settles into orbit.

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

DR. WHAT swivels around in his chair and looks at the view screen.

 DR. WHAT 
So, LEO, anything particularly interesting about this timeline?

 LEO CAESIUS 
I’ve never seen anything quite like this world. First of all,
the population is very low, less than a million people total.
Humanity is restricted to a handful of population centers
around the world. There are only a few on each continent,
and only one in all of Australia. Each group seems to be
centered around a fortified mansion; these places are full
of advanced technology, everything from fusion power
plants to supercomputers. But only a handful of people
live in them. All around these castles, there are thousands
of people living in a Neolithic culture… they have no plastic,
no machinery… I don’t think they even have any metal!
They seem to exist on farms scratched out with wooden
and stone tools.

 DR. WHAT 
That is strange. Did this place get hit
with a nuclear war or something?

 LEO CAESIUS 
No, I’m not detecting any unusual radiation.
There are the remains of cities scattered
around the planet, but they seem to have
been abandoned fairly recently. Most of
them look like they have been burned…
looks like rioting took a lot of them down.

 DR. WHAT 
Hmmm… it’d be nice to find out just what
happened to this place, but we really don’t
need anything from them. I’d rather not go
down and mess around in some post-
apocalyptic feudal society. We all know
how that ends.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Do my audio recievers deceiving me?
Is our captain actually displaying some
tact and discretion?

 DR. WHAT 
Hardy har har. Someday, LEO, I’m going
to track down whoever programmed you
and kick him in the nuts for giving you that
sense of warped humor.

The repartee is interrupted by TORQUMADA on the intercom.

 TORQUMADA 
DR. WHAT! Come to the
Med Bay immediately please.
We have a medical emergency!

DR. WHAT looks at the rest of the crew for a moment, and then hops out of his chair and runs out of the room.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- MED BAY- DAY 

DR. WHAT is seen running into the room. He stops for breath and looks around. TORQUMADA is leaning over LUAKEL, who is lying on a bed, motionless, with eyes rolled back in his head. He has a pair of large corks stuffed into his ears.

 DR. WHAT 
What’s the emergency, TORQ?

 TORQUMADA 
Something’s wrong with LUAKEL.

 DR .WHAT 
LUAKEL?! Aw, geez, TORQ, I
thought you said it was important!

 TORQUMADA 
It is important!
He’s dying!
And it’s my fault!

 DR.WHAT 
Why’s that?

 TORQUMADA 
Back when I put his brain in the body
of this LUAKEL slaver that we ran
across, I did it in kind of a hurry. Well,
I didn’t catch something in the operation.
His cerebral brain fluid is leaking out
of his cranium. His brain is suffering,
and I need to go back in and fix it.

 DR. WHAT 
Leaking brain fluid? Well that explains
the corks in the ears. The poor kid.
Well, I give you the okay to go ahead
and do it.

 TORQUMADA 
No, DOC, you don’t understand.
I can’t fix him until I get a big batch
of SynCereThol on hand.

 DR. WHAT 
Wuzzat?

 TORQUMADA 
It’s a synthetic cerebral fluid used in
cloning and brain transplant surgeries.
I used all I had when I transferred
LUAKEL’S brain into this body, and
I don’t have any more.

 DR. WHAT 
Can we buy some at the Hub?

 TORQUMADA 
Probably… but it’s really expensive.
I don’t think we have enough cash
on hand to buy enough.

 DR. WHAT 
Damn it, I told MICHAEL and MATT
that they shouldn’t spend all our
money at that strip club three timelines
back. Who cares if the women there
had three boobs? Hmmm… could
THANDE make this stuff up for you?

 TORQUMADA 
 (scoffing) 
THADE??? He couldn’t mix kool-aid, let alone this!
He doesn’t have all the chemicals he needs on hand,
and the stuff takes weeks to fabricate.

 DR. WHAT 
Hmmm… I wonder if the planet here has
any of the stuff. LEO, you listening in?

 LEO CAESIUS 
I’m always listening, Doc.
 (beat) 
Always…
I’ll start scanning for SynCereThol right away.

 DR. WHAT 
Good. Well, TORQ, we’ll do our best to find some.
Even if it is just for LUAKEL. LEO, I’m heading up to the
Control Room. Tell me what you find when I get there.

DR. WHAT walks out of the Med Bay, shaking his head sadly.

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

The crew is seen loafing in here, napping, reading comic books, and generally goofing off. The door starts to open, and all the crew instantly springs to life, reading dials and pushing buttons. DR. WHAT walks into the room, looks around for a moment, and then goes over to sit down in his chair.

 DR. WHAT 
LEO, any luck?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Yes, I found quite a bit of it, right away.
There are several gallons of SynCereThol
in every one of those castles. A particularly
large amount is in that one down there
in Australia.

 DR .WHAT 
Great! Hmm… wonder what those
people would want in exchange for it?
We’re going to have to go down and
talk to them, offer them something.

 MICHAEL 
Why do you need SynCereThol, DOC?

 DR. WHAT 
TORQUMADA needs a bunch
of it for an emergency operation.

 MICHAEL 
Operation?! For who?!
It’s not LANDSHARK, is it?!

 LANDSHARK (off camera) 
Nonsense, chaps, I’m right
here, and I’m perfectly fit.

The camera pans over to LANDSHARK, sitting at his station next to IRONYUPPIE. He is elegantly tailored and manicured, with perfectly sculpted hair. He holds a meerschaum pipe in one hand and a book in the other. Everyone looks at him and sighs with relief.

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (hugs Landshark) 
Thank goodness!
I couldn’t bear to lose you!

 LANDSHARK 
Now now, my sweet, I’m quite all right. But,
captain, who is it who needs the operation?

 DR. WHAT 
It’s LUAKEL. He needs an
emergency brain operation soon.
But TORQUMADA needs a lot
of SynCereThol to do it. So…
down to the planet we go.

DR. WHAT swivels around in his chair, and gazes across the room at the crew.

 DR. WHAT 
Since that Australian castle has so
much of the stuff, we’ll go there to get it.
This is a nice peaceful trade mission,
so I’m going to take HENDRYK, KIT,
and THANDE with me. And LANDSHARK,
of course.

The camera switches to LANDSHARK, who puffs on his pipe, and nods in agreement.

 LANDSHARK 
And of course, I shall take
my faithful gun bearer with me.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Damn it, how many times do I have to tell you,
I’m not your… oh all right, I’ll go along.

 MATT 
Geez, all this effort to save LUAKEL?
Why are you bothering?

 LANDSHARK 
Now, MATT, that is no way to talk.
We are a team, and we must all
pull together. If it was your life on
the line, I’m sure you’d want us
to do the same for you.
And we would.

MATT nods and looks ashamed of himself.

 DR .WHAT 
Okay, team, get some gear together
and meet me in the teleportation room
in 20 minutes. Every minute is vital here.
Let’s move.

The team members all stand and hurry out of the room.

 INT- AH.COM TELEPORTATION ROOM- DAY 

G BONE is seen in here punching some numbers into the keypad on his station. As he finishes, DR. WHAT and his team walk into the room.

 DR. WHAT 
Looks like we’re ready to go.
LEO, just where are we going?

 LEO CAESIUS 
The castle is located just northeast of
the ruins of Canberra, near Lake George.
It is one of the better places in Australia
for the primitive farming they practice.
I have given the coordinates to G BONE.
Everything is ready.

DR. WHAT and the team step onto the teleportation platform.

 DR. WHAT 
Okay, G BONE, fire it up.

G BONE pushes the lever on his station all the way up. The team vanishes with a loud pop. G BONE then kicks back in his chair and pulls out a Supergirl comic book.

 LEO CAESIUS 
What are you doing?

 G BONE 
Relaxing for a while. The captain’s
off the ship, he’ll never know.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Yes, but LANDSHARK will.
You know how he disapproves
of slacking like this. You don’t
want to disappoint him, do you?

 G BONE 
 (sighs) 
No, I don’t.

He goes back to work.

 EXT- OUTSIDE THE CASTLE- DAY 

The camera pans over a wide view of the area around the castle. We see fields with irrigation ditches, and people moving around in them, weeding and watering. The people are dressed in crude woolen garments, and most of them look unhappy. The camera pans over to the castle, a large rambling stone structure with a moat around it. A road leads from it through the fields. DR. WHAT, KIT, HENDRYK, LANDSHARK, and FLOCCULENCIO appear on the road with a loud pop. They look around in curiosity at the people in the fields.

 HENDRYK 
My. These people are just as
primitive as LEO said they were.
Look, they’re using tools made
from wood and stone!
Not a bit of metal around here.

The camera switches to a view of the people, who are looking back at the team in surprise. They stand up from their work, and indeed, are holding primitive stone age tools. The team members look down at their own clothing and gear.

 DR. WHAT 
Boy, do we ever look out of place.
Let’s head up to the castle.

The team walks up the road, drawing stares from the natives all the way. As they get closer, they see a pair of guards standing at the front of the drawbridge across the moat. These are dressed in modern clothing and carry pistols on their belts. They are looking at the team in surprise… and anger too. The team walks up to them and stops.

 DR. WHAT 
Hello. We are representatives from the ship AH.COM.
We are here on a peaceful trading mission.
Can we see your leader?

The guards look at each other in puzzlement.

 GUARD #1 
You… want to talk to Master Rupert?

 DR. WHAT 
Yes. We wish to buy something he has.

The two guards look at each other, and then grin nastily.

 GUARD #2 
As you wish. Follow us.

They turn and walk along the drawbridge towards the manor. The team members all look at each other uneasily.

 HENDRYK 
I don’t like the looks of this. ‘Master Rupert’
seems to have a rather nasty reputation here.

 LANDSHARK 
Quite, quite, yes indeed.
Gun bearer! Have my
express rifle ready!

The camera switches to FLOCCULENCIO, who is wearing a 19th Century Indian manservant’s outfit, complete with turban. He looks rather peeved.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
I keep telling you, I don’t have
your bloody express rifle!
This was supposed to be a
peaceful trade mission,
so DOC said no guns.

 KIT 
Why do you dress up like that and put up with all this?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
I can’t say. It’s just a sort of compulsion.
Every time I start to tell him to bugger off,
I end up agreeing.

 DR. WHAT 
Damn. This does look bad. What do
you think guys… do we risk it?

 LANDSHARK 
We must. If there is even a small chance
to save LUAKEL, we must take the risk.

The others nod at that, and they follow the guards out onto the drawbridge. The guards reach the main gate and bang on it with the butts of their guns. A small peephole opens and after an exchange of words, the gate is pulled open from the inside. The guards, followed by the team, walk into the manor house. They pass into a large courtyard; the camera pans around, showing a luxurious garden and a fountain. The guards lead the team forward to another steel door, this one leading into the main hall of the manor. After another brief exchange of words, this door also opens, and the team moves inside.

 INT- MANOR HALL- DAY 

The camera pans around the room, showing us a beautifully decorated throne room. It looks much like a medieval hall, except that it is lit by electric lights and there are people moving around who are carrying modern pistols. A handful of servant women are seen; all are extraordinarily beautiful, but they seem relegated to such tasks as cleaning and serving drinks. The team is seen entering; they look around in wonder. The camera switches to the far side of the room. A tall throne is near the wall there. The man sitting on it is youthful and arrogant looking. He is the local version of RUPERT MURDOCH, but he looks as if he is only in his 20’s. One of the guards who led the team inside walks over to him, bows briefly, and then goes over and whispers into RUPERT’S ear. RUPERT listens, and then sits up straight, a somewhat angry look on his face.

 RUPERT 
Strangers, you dare much in coming here and
passing among my people as richly dressed as
you are. But approach the throne.

The team members look down at their faded jeans and shirts not tucked in, and then shrug at each other. They walk forward, up to the foot of the throne, and bow politely.

 DR. WHAT 
Master RUPERT, we seek to buy…

 RUPERT 
Silence.

DR. WHAT immediately clams up, and RUPERT looks over all of them, with a distasteful expression.

 RUPERT 
Whoever you serve, your master
has transgressed the proper rules
of behavior by sending you like this.
Tell me, which master is yours?

 DR .WHAT 
Uh… we serve no master on this world. You see,
we come from… well, it’s hard to explain. Have
you ever heard the theory of points of departure
in history, and multiple planes of existence that result from…

 RUPERT 
Alternate realities. We are familiar with the concept.
But I never heard of anyone being able to move from
timeline to timeline. And you claim to have done so?

 DR .WHAT 
Yes, in a ship designed for that purpose.
We are explorers, you might say,
of the alternate realities.

 RUPERT 
Interesting. And do you serve some lord or
government in one of those timelines?

 DR. WHAT 
No, we are free agents.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (muttering) 
Because no one will have us…

 RUPERT 
And with the whole of existence in
your reach, why are you here?

 DR. WHAT 
Our scans showed us that you
have a large quantity of SynCereThol
available here. We would like to
purchase three gallons of it.

 RUPERT 
No.

 DR. WHAT 
 (surprised) 
But… Master RUPERT, a boy’s life is at stake here.
We can pay you with anything that you find valuable…
metals, chemicals, finished goods.

 RUPERT 
You have nothing I need.

 DR .WHAT 
But, sir! One of my crewmen is dying needlessly!
Why will you not agree to an exchange so we can save him?

 RUPERT 
The SynCereThol is mine.
These people are mine.
Everything here is mine.
 (pause) 
And because you come here and freely admit that
you serve no master, you are now mine.

At these ominous words, the team members look around, and see that several people with guns have made an appearance. Some look like guards, others look like technicians, and some look like police. There are also four men who are dressed in black martial arts robes; these have no guns, but carry a variety of martial arts weapons. All have surrounded the team.

 DR. WHAT 
You’re making a mistake here. Our ship can blow this
place into smithereens in no time.

RUPERT merely smiles and then motions to one of the techs. This man takes out a remote control and pushes a button on it.

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

The crew is seen in here manning their stations and going about their tasks. GREY WOLF is sitting in the captain’s chair and looking at several reports on the view screen.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Uh, guys, something’s wrong.
An electronic scrambling field
just kicked into place around
the Australian castle. I can’t scan
into it. The team is in there, and
we won’t be able to teleport them out.

 GREY WOLF 
Bugger! Looks like DR. WHAT blew the negotiations.

He swivels around and looks at the crew.

 GREY WOLF 
Hopefully the situation will resolve
itself somehow, but in case it doesn’t…
MATT, put a rescue team together
and prepare to move down to the surface.

 MATT 
To rescue the captain and KIT, and all
that just to save LUAKEL? Why bother?

 GREY WOLF 
Have you forgotten that LANDSHARK is down there too?

 MATT 
Oh Jesus! I’ll get right on it!

MATT hops out of his chair and runs out of the room, a deeply worried look on his face.

 INT- MANOR HALL- DAY 

The team members are looking around anxiously as RUPERT’S henchmen close in on them. From his throne, RUPERT smiles arrogantly.

 RUPERT 
Did you think we were so primitive and
helpless here? Your ship will not be able
to fire on us. You broke one of our most
basic laws here, outlanders. If you are
not Masters, then you must belong to a Master.
Your lives and positions in whatever
world you come from are now meaningless.
You are mine.

DR. WHAT looks first outraged, then scared, and then angry. He pulls a communicator out of his pocket and attempts to speak into it, but one of the black clad martial artists moves blindingly fast. He clouts DR. WHAT on the head and snatches the communicator out of his hand. He then hands it to RUPERT, who looks at it a moment. He then turns it on and speaks into it.

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

 LEO CAESIUS 
GREY, we are receiving a communication from the surface.
It’s from DR. WHAT’S comm unit, but it’s not his voice.
I’m putting it on speakers.

The ceiling mounted speakers crackle into life.

 RUPERT (on speakers) 
To the ship in orbit… this is Master RUPERT.
Your crew members are now my servants.
Leave this world immediately. Do not attempt
to rescue them, or their fate shall be yours.

GREY WOLF starts to reply, but the communication is suddenly cut off. A look of fury goes across his face.

 GREY WOLF 
That… damn… arrogant… wanker! Who the bloody hell
does he think he is, talking to us like that?!

He pushes a comm button on the arm of the chair.

 GREY WOLF 
MATT, looks like we’re going to have to go with the rescue plan.
Let’s wait for night, and then teleport your team to the surface.
Load up with everything you can carry… this is going to be a tough one.

 INT- CASTLE DUNGEON- DAY 

The camera shows a long shot down a dimly lit corridor. Barred prison cells are seen along both sides, with doors and huge locks. The team members walk into the camera view, being forced along by several guards with guns and one of the black clad martial artists. The group stops in front of one of the cells, and a guard unlocks it. He gives the key to the martial artist, and then the guards all leave. The martial artist motions for the team to go into the cell.

The team members all look at each other a moment, and then all of them jump the martial artist. The camera shows a confused and blurry long shot of flying fists and feet, and bodies being tossed around.

The camera switches to a shot inside the cell. The team members are seen lying on the floor there, welts and bruises all around. They look up and see the martial artist without a scratch. He sneers down at them, shuts the cell door, locks it, and walks away.

 DR. WHAT 
Son of a BITCH! That bastard moves faster than
GREY WOLF in a bar giving out free booze.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Bloody hell! My arm feels like it
was twisted halfway out of the socket!

 KIT 
My face! My oh so pretty face! He put bruises on it!
Oh, that’ll take ages to recover!

 HENDRYK 
Well, once again, here we are in a prison with
no weapons and hoping the crew will rescue us.

 DR. WHAT 
Of course they’ll rescue us… LANDSHARK is here.
That’s why I bring him along… if anything goes wrong,
the rest of the crew is bound to come running.

Everyone looks at LANDSHARK, who seems to be unruffled from the whole experience. He’s calmly puffing on his meerschaum pipe and glancing through a book on 19th century explorers.

 EXT- OUTSIDE CASTLE- NIGHT 

The camera pans around the moonlit empty fields. None of the peasants are to be seen. The camera stops on a view of the castle, lit up with electric lights. A team from the AH.COM pop into view; MATT, DMA, IRONYUPPIE, and MICHAEL. All are wearing body armor and carrying a massive amount of weaponry; BFGs, bolters, grenades, LAWs, knives, and pistols. They look around cautiously.

 DMA 
The scans LEO managed to get of
the place before that scrambling
field popped up showed that the
main gate is the only way into the
castle. It’s going to be tough
busting into there right in plain sight.

 MATT 
Hey, when you have rocket launchers,
you can make your own door.
Let’s move around to the side,
cross the moat, and blast our
way in.

The rest of the team nods at that, and then all move off to the left. They walk slowly along an irrigation ditch, being careful to stay out of the lighted areas around the castle. As they move along, the camera shifts to a view of the water in the ditch… a reed is seen poking up out of the water. It suddenly twitches around and then disappears. A head is seen rising out of the water, and the man stands up… it is one of the black clad martial artists. Moving with absolute silence, he moves out of the ditch and behind the party. The camera switches back to the party. MATT’S communicator suddenly crackles into life, and LEO CAESIUS is heard speaking out of it.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Heads up, team! The
enemy is all around you!

The team members whirl in all directions, guns pointing. MATT is startled to see the man behind the team, but suddenly more of the black clad martial artists burst out of hiding in the mud and water. The team is suddenly surrounded by a dozen of them, all carrying various nunchucks, staves, and martial art weapons.

 MATT 
Get ‘em!

MATT starts to point his BFG, but the man snatches it out of his hands. He pauses to gather in a deep breath, and then with a shout, he twists his hands and breaks the BFG in half. MATT goggles at the sight, and then tries to draw his pistol, but the martial artist kicks it out of his hand. MATT then tries to pull out his grenades, LAW, and knife, but the man kicks each out of his hands. Finally, MATT futilely pats his hands over his belt.

 MATT 
Holy shit, I’m out of weapons!

He looks around briefly to see that the other team members are having similar problems. IRONYUPPIE’S weapons are scattered on the ground around her, but she is managing to hold her own with bare hands, but a pair of martial artists are slowly bringing her down with nunchuks. DMA lies pinned on the ground, one of the martial artists having his wrist in a twisted lock hold. MICHAEL is lying in the mud, apparently hurt. MATT turns back to his own attacker, who suddenly moves very fast. His open hand smashes the face plate off of MATT’S helmet. A kick to the chest sends MATT flying into the irrigation ditch. He starts to rise, but the man leaps onto him with a shout. The man’s foot shoves MATT’S head below the water. MATT’S arms are seen flailing around for a moment, and then trying to get a grip on the man’s leg, but he seems unable to shift him. After a moment, MATT’S arms go limp, and fall back into the water. The martial artist looks around to see that the rest of the team has been captured. IRONYUPPIE has been beaten into unconsciousness with nunchuks, DMA has his hands tied behind his back, and MICHAEL is still hurt. The martial artists hustle the captives down the road towards the castle. The camera pans back to the irrigation ditch, where MATT can be seen floating in the water, face down. A strong looking hand reaches from off camera, grabs MATT’S arm, and pulls him quickly out of the scene.

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- NIGHT 

GREY WOLF is seen in the captain’s chair, looking rather pale.

 GREY WOLF 
So… all of them have been captured?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Apparently. IRONYUPPIE, MICHAEL, and DMA were
taken into the scrambling field around the castle before
G BONE could lock onto them. However… MATT is
still outside of it. He is being taken away from the castle
by one of the peasants, I think. His life signs are extremely low.
Shall I have G BONE teleport him up here?

 GREY WOLF 
Hmm… no. Not unless the peasants look like they intend to hurt him.
It looks to me as if they are helping him… otherwise, why bother
dragging him off? Keep a close eye on him, though.
Let’s see where this all leads.

 INT- MED BAY- NIGHT 

TORQUMADA is seen pacing nervously in front of LUAKEL’S bed. He stops to look at a digital readout on a monitor over the bed. The various bars showing LUAKEL’S vital signs are slowly dropping.

 INT- MANOR HALL- NIGHT 

The camera shows the martial artists bringing the captives into the throne room. IRONYUPPIE is conscious and looking extremely pissed off, but her hands are bound and her feet are in restraints that force her to take short steps. DMA is similarly bound, and MICHAEL is still unconscious. The prisoners are paraded up to the throne, and RUPERT looks down on them in semi-amusement.

 RUPERT 
So… the people on your ship did
not listen to me. Now, they will pay for it.

He gets off the throne and steps down to look over the prisoners, first at IRONYUPPIE.

 RUPERT 
This one has spirit, and
could breed many strong workers.

IRONYUPPIE snarls at him and tries to move forward, but the guards keep her back. RUPERT next looks at DMA, shakes his head, and then looks at MICHAEL.

 RUPERT 
This one would scarcely be worth the effort.
 (to DMA) 
Unfortunately for you, an object lesson is needed.
Your ship ignored my demands. Tomorrow night, outlander,
you will be executed. Your people need to learn…
everything here is mine.

 

 

 END ACT I 

 ACT II 

 

 
 

 INT- SOCIETY HEADQUARTERS- NIGHT 

The camera pans around a small dark room, light only by a pair of torches. The room is empty except for some mats on the floor, and a single rough cot. MATT is lying on the cot, sleeping soundly. A figure off camera is heard entering the room, and a shadow falls across MATT’S face. He stirs and opens his eyes. He stares blankly for a moment, and then gasps and sits up, looking wildly around.

The camera switches to his POV. A young and very pretty Asian woman is looking down at him with interest. She wears a white martial art outfit with a black belt. She is slim but strong looking. She smiles at MATT.

 WOMAN 
Rest, stranger. You’ve been through
a lot and you need to recover
your strength. You nearly drowned.
Actually, you had drowned,
but we were able to revive you.

She pauses, and runs a finger over the power armor on his chest.

 WOMAN 
How do you come to have
so much forbidden material?
So much metal and plastic…

 MATT 
Uh… it’s a long story. Who are you?

 WOMAN 
You can call me SHADOW LOTUS.

 MATT 
That’s pretty… but I
can’t imagine your
parents named you that.

 SHADOW LOTUS 
 (shrugs) 
I have another name, but it is my slave name.
I do not use it. SHADOW LOTUS is my Society name…
my real name.

 MATT 
Uh… Society? What society?

Before she can answer, the door opens, and a man steps into the room. He is also Asian and also strong looking. He wears a white martial art suit and is carrying a bag made out of hide. He looks down at MATT in frank curiosity.

 MAN 
Welcome to the Society of Thanatos, stranger.

 MATT 
The what of who?

 MAN 
I’ll explain later. Now… who are you?
You look like no one I have ever seen.
And you have so much forbidden material…

 MATT 
I’m MATT, Weapons Specialist
on the MES AH.COM.

The two Asians look at each other blankly a moment.

 MAN 
Okay, you can explain that one later.
Now… why are you here?

 MATT 
Well, several of our crew came
here to bargain with the leader
in the castle for a chemical we
need… damn, I almost forgot!
LUAKEL! Shit! Anyway… that
idiot lord took them captive.
I was trying to rescue them when
those black clad ninjas took out
the whole team.

 MAN 
Ah, stranger, that was a mistake.
You see, in this world, there are
only Masters and serfs. You can-
not bargain with a Master, because
he thinks he owns everyone and
everything in his domain. Only a
Master can bargain with another
Master.

 MATT 
Masters. Serfs. How did this
world get so fucked up?
But wait… first, who are you?
And what is this Society?

 MAN 
I can answer all that.
But my name… call me
RISING DREAM.

 MATT 
Uh huh. And your slave name?

 RISING DREAM 
It is unimportant,
but it is AOZHOUHUAREN.

 MATT 
I’se a whorin’?!

 RISING DREAM 
No, AOZHOUHUAREN.

 MATT 
Oz how heron?

 RISING DREAM 
No, it’s simple…
AOZHOUHUAREN.

 MATT 
 (long pause) 
I’m just going to call you BOB.

 RISING DREAM/AOZHOUHUAREN/ HEREAFTER KNOWN AS BOB 
 (shrugs) 
It is irrelevant. My true name is RISING DREAM.
Now… to answer your questions…

He and SHADOW LOTUS take a moment to sit cross legged on the floor.

 BOB 
Most of what we know of our history is word of mouth these days.
Once, we had a culture of technology and industry. Then, the oil ran out.
Nations rioted and warred over what little remained. Many died.
A genetically engineered virus unleashed by some fool killed much
of the world’s population. A handful of places worked to develop
nuclear fission, and finally, one succeeded. At the same time, other
research places perfected cloning, and yet others brought the state
of computer engineering to a high degree. At this time, a handful
of the wealthy on each continent seized power and the means of
industry. They set up fortified manors with fission power plants,
cloning banks, and massive computer power. These wealthy men
then set themselves up as the Clonemasters, or just Masters. They
effectively live forever, by using computers to transfer their brain
patterns into new young bodies every time they get old or injured.
They slowly forced all others into servant status. Those who live
inside the manor houses are either trained technicians or guards,
positions of wealth and honor in the Clonemaster household. These
people also scour the population for the most beautiful of women,
who are taken into the castles to be servants. Everyone else, everyone
who lives outside the walls, are serfs, peasants, slaves. We have no
privileges, no protection, no recourse to law. The Masters eventually
forbade us to have such things as metal or plastic, or any means of
technology. They force us to live in squalid misery, growing the food they eat.

 MATT 
Cloning… that explains the
gallons of SynCereThol the
place has. But go on… tell
me about this Society of yours.

 BOB 
The Society of Thanatos. This is the only means we have to strike back.
Denied weapons and even metal, groups of martial artists banded together
to form resistance groups. We have perfected the martial arts to the highest
level ever known to man. We are denied weapons, but we need none. Our
bodies are the only weapon we need. We call ourselves Terminators, and
our goal is elimination of the Masters. On other continents, our groups have
taken out several of the Clonemasters, but it is always a difficult task. Here,
we watch, we wait, we look for an opportunity. Someday, we will assault
the manor house of Master RUPERT, kill him and all his clones, and
destroy his equipment. The Clonemasters shall never rise again.

 MATT 
Now, that’s a goal I can agree with. Hmmm…
I think I can help you. But… I wonder if the
guards left any of our gear behind when they
took the team away.

BOB takes the bag off his belt and spills it out on the floor.

 BOB 
The Jellies took most
of your gear, but they
missed a few things
in the mud.

 MATT 
Okay… uh… Jellies?

 BOB 
A nickname. When the Society took out a few of the Clonemasters,
they began to gather their own martial artists to help defend them.
They are the men in the black martial arts outfits who attacked your team.
They are skilled, but to a lesser degree than any of us. They stoop
to using actual weapons… a true master needs none. The serfs called
them ‘spineless jellies’… but not to their faces. Eventually, it got
shortened to just Jellies.
 (grins) 
If you ever want to make one of them very angry,
call them a Jelly to their face.

MATT is pawing through the items on the table; a couple of grenades, some clips for guns which aren’t there, and a communicator. MATT grabs the last item with a smile.

 MATT 
Yes! Now, I can contact the ship, come up with a plan…

 BOB 
Ship? Perhaps it is time you told us where you come from.

 MATT 
 (sighs) 
That’s going to take a little time…

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- NIGHT 

GREY WOLF is still sitting in the captain’s chair, looking very tired and badly in need of a drink, when the ceiling speakers crackle into life.

 MATT (on speakers) 
Hey, guys, this is MATT. Anyone there?

 GREY WOLF 
I’m here. It’s good to hear from you?
What’s happening down there?

 MATT 
Well, the rest of the team was captured, but I managed
to make contact with a local resistance group. I got a plan,
but I need to get some stuff. Connect me to G BONE,
so he can teleport what I need.

 GREY WOLF 
Will do. You need anyone to come down and help you?

 MATT 
Nope. Trust me, these guys are… really good.

 INT- SOCIETY HEADQUARTERS- NIGHT 

MATT is seen talking on the communicator.

 MATT 
Okay, G BONE, send that stuff down to my location
as soon as you get it all together. What’s that? No,
I don’t know if LANDSHARK is okay. MATT out.

He turns off the communicator, and turns to BOB.

 MATT 
Okay, all I need is to get this gear, and we have a plan.
Wait for tomorrow night and…

He stops as two more Terminators walk into the room. One is the local version of BLACKMAGE, and the other is…

 MATT 
Geez! MICHAEL!

 MICHAEL 
Eh… wot? That’s my slave name, mate.
My true name is GOLDEN SONG.

 MATT 
Sounds kinda girly to me, but it’s better than Golden Shower.
 (to BLACKMAGE) 
And your name is? Wait, didn’t I kill you once?

 BLACKMAGE 
Obviously not. My true name is LEAPING DRAGON.

 MATT 
No, I’m sure I killed you once.
You were a Space Marine and…

 GOLDEN SONG 
 (to BOB) 
Bad news, boss. The peasants say that RUPERT
has made an announcement. He is going to execute
one of the strangers he captured.

 MATT 
 (panicked) 
It’s not LANDSHARK, is it?!

 LEAPING DRAGON 
No, it was the one you call DMA.

 MATT 
Oh, thank God! Wait, that’s not good news!
They can’t kill one of my people and get away
with it! BOB, get all the Terminators in here,
and I’ll go over the plan.

 BOB 
We are all here.

 MATT 
What?! There’s only four of you?!

 BOB 
Training to be a Terminator is not easy, and
few are called to the task. It takes many years
of training, practically from birth.
Few are able to handle it.

 MATT 
Okay. Well, here’s what I have in mind…

He pulls a sketched map of the castle out of his pocket and spreads it out on the floor.

 INT- CASTLE DUNGEON- MORNING 

The camera opens on a shot of the crowded prison cell; all the captives are here, and waking up grumpily. MICHAEL is still unconscious on the floor, but everyone else seems healthy, except for bruises. DMA looks like he hasn’t slept all night; he’s sitting up against the wall, wide eyed and pale.

 KIT 
Bugger, we’re still here.
I was hoping it was all a
bad dream.

 HENDRYK 
If only. Damn, DMA, you look like hell.

 DMA 
You would too if they were going to cut your throat tonight!
Or shoot you or burn you at the stake or…

 VOICE (off camera) 
It’ll be a beheading.

The crew turns to see a Jelly standing outside their cell. He holds a plate of food in his hands. He slides it under the door.

 JELLY 
Bullets are too expensive to waste on executions.
No, it’s the headsman’s axe for you. Eat up…
although, if I were you, I wouldn’t waste any food on that one.
 (motions to DMA) 

The Jelly walks away. The crew members look at each other, and then at the food.

 KIT 
My God, that’s disgusting!

 IRONYUPPIE 
What did you expect, beef Wellington?

 KIT 
Why not? Our captor is a
cultured gentleman, even
if he is a bloody handed tyrant.

 LANDSHARK 
Now, chaps, even if the food is substandard, we must consume it.
We must keep our strength up, and hope that we’ll be able to turn
the tables on these blighters. Come now, gun bearer, tuck in!

 FLOCCULENCIO 
For that last damn time, I am not… oh bloody hell!

FLOCCULENCIO takes a handful of food, holds his nose, and takes a bite. He chews and swallows hurriedly, and makes a disgusted face.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Blimey! This tastes like pickled cow’s butt!

 DR. WHAT 
Just how do you know what that tastes like?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
I’d rather not tell you that.

 INT- SOCIETY HEADQUARTERS- DAY 

MATT is seen in here pacing back and forth. He stops to look at the digital watch built into the armor on his arm, then resumes pacing. SHADOW LOTUS is sitting on the floor in the lotus position, eyes closed, meditating. She opens her eyes and sees MATT pacing.

 SHADOW LOTUS 
You should relax, MATT. Pacing and worry does no good.
Night will come when it comes.

 MATT 
I always get nervy before a big operation. And so much is
riding on this one. Relax… must relax.

He stops and looks down speculatively at SHADOW LOTUS. He sits on the floor in front of her, and tentatively puts a hand on her knee.

 MATT 
I do know one way to relax. You know, we may be
going to our deaths tomorrow, and…

She merely smiles and gently moves his hand away.

 SHADOW LOTUS 
I admit, it is… tempting. But I cannot. Terminators
abstain from pleasures of the flesh. It is a distraction.

MATT stares at her wide eyed.

 MATT 
My God! You mean, all you Terminators practice
abstinence your whole lives?! I’d be climbing the walls…

 SHADOW LOTUS 
We can actually do that… climb walls, I mean. But yes,
abstinence is part of our discipline. Once you experience
carnal pleasures, it always is part of your mind, and will
be a distraction from the Art. Think of the warrior you
could be if you had never given in to lust, without the
thought of pursuit of women to cloud your mind.

 MATT 
Honey, that train left the station a
looooooong time ago. But… must relax.

He awkwardly puts himself into the lotus position, his power armor making it difficult.

 MATT 
Okay, I’ll try it your way. Now what?

 SHADOW LOTUS 
Clear your mind of all thoughts of the coming battle,
or battles of the past. Focus on something soothing…
pools of water, rolling surf, anything calm, repetitive…

The two close their eyes and sit motionless for a moment.

 MATT 
Actually, there is one thing you can do that
will relax me, and it’s not naughty or anything.

She opens her eyes and looks at him inquisitively.

 MATT 
Last night, when you dragged me here and revived me…
please tell me it was you who gave me mouth to mouth, and not BOB.

SHADOW LOTUS grins and closes her eyes again.

 MATT 
Hey, I’m not kidding, I would really like to know that…

 INT- AH.COM MED BAY- DAY 

TORQUMADA is looking at the monitor over LUAKEL’S bed, a very grim expression on his face. He looks around as GREY WOLF enters the room.

 GREY WOLF 
How’s he doing?

 TORQUMADA 
Not good. He hasn’t got much longer. If I don’t
operate tomorrow, he’s done for. And I can’t
operate without that SynCereThol.

 GREY WOLF 
If MATT’S plan works, you’ll have it tonight.
G BONE sent down the stuff that he requested.
The attack goes on in a couple of hours.

The two look at LUAKEL lying motionless in the bed. He is deathly pale and seems shrunken in size.

 EXT- OUTSIDE THE AUSTRALIAN CASTLE- NIGHT 

The camera opens with a far shot of the lighted castle. The camera pans away from it out across the empty fields. It stops when the four Terminators and MATT come into view. MATT has been reequipped; he has a sniper rifle with scope and silencer slung over his shoulder, a bolter at his belt, and a pack on his back. He is looking at the castle through a pair of high tech binoculars.

 MATT 
Just a couple of guards out front.
Everyone else must be inside,
waiting to see them kill poor DMA.
Damn it, no one gets to kill our people…

He takes the sniper rifle off of his shoulder and chambers a round. He then goes down prone on the ground, resting the rifle on a mound of dirt. He carefully peers through the infrared scope, and then fires two quick shots. He looks through the scope again.

 MATT 
And… scratch two guards. Now…

He squints through the scope again, and fires a single shot.
The camera switches to a view of the castle. One of the electric lights over the main gate winks out. More shots are heard, and more of the lights go out, one by one, until the entire front of the castle is dark.

The camera switches back to MATT, who takes the binoculars, turns them to infrared mode, and looks through them.

 MATT 
All clear. Doesn’t look like anyone
else was on guard. Damn sloppy, that is…

 BOB 
Okay, Terminators, this is it… move up.

The group all quietly jogs forward. MATT has his bolter out and is looking around as he moves. BOB is in the lead. When the group gets about halfway to the castle, BOB suddenly holds up a hand, and everyone stops. The Terminators assume karate ready stances. MATT looks around in confusion.

 MATT 
Uh… guys, what…

Six Jellies suddenly burst out of the mud and attack. They are fast and skilled… but the Terminators are much faster and much more skilled. Their arms and legs make whooshing sounds as they strike, and they seem to anticipate the Jellies’ every move. MATT is frantically aiming his bolter all over, but the Jellies go down faster than he can get a bead on them. After a fight of about eight seconds, MATT finds himself standing in the middle of the Terminators, dead Jellies all around.

 MATT 
 (muttering) 
Sweet Mother of God….

 BOB 
Let’s move!

The group continues their advance on the castle.

 INT- MANOR HOUSE- NIGHT 

The camera shows a wide panning shot of the throne room. A low platform has been set up in the middle of the room. On it, there is a block of wood, stained with old dried blood. A man in black robes and a black hood stands there, a huge axe in his hands. A line of Jellies is standing in front of the platform, weapons ready. Off to the side, a milling horde of techs, police, and guards are standing in a mob, cheering and yelling. RUPERT is on his throne, overlooking everything.

 RUPERT 
Bring out the prisoner!

 INT- CASTLE DUNGEON- NIGHT 

DMA is seen being pulled out of the cell by a Jelly. A group of guards with pistols has them pointed at the other crew members, who look furious, but are standing at the back of the cell. As DMA exits the cell, a guard shuts the door and locks it again. The guards take DMA down the hall.

 INT- MANOR HALL- NIGHT 

Everyone cheers when DMA is brought into the room. The guards drag him up onto the platform and shove him down so that his head is on the chopping block. The headsman grunts and hefts his axe.

 EXT- MANOR HOUSE- NIGHT 

MATT and the Terminators are seen moving up to the steel door that leads into the throne room. MATT tries the door but it is locked.

 MATT 
All right, a locked door! I’ll take care of this.

 BOB 
No, I will.

The camera focuses on BOB. He closes his eyes and draws in several deep breaths. The camera switches to a shot of his right hand, which clenches so tight that the veins stand out on his arm. The camera switches to a further shot of BOB, and he explodes into action. He slams his fist into the steel door. It tears off the wall with a shriek of metal and falls flat on the ground. The Terminators and MATT run through the doorway.

 INT- MANOR HALL- NIGHT 

The headsman has the axe held high. Just before he can swing it down, the steel door to the hall is heard crashing down. The headsman pauses and looks around in surprise. The camera switches to a shot of the doorway; MATT and the Terminators are seen running into the room. As they stop to look around, MATT quickly sees DMA and the headsman.

 MATT 
Oh no you don’t!

He fires a single shot. The headsman takes the round in the chest and falls backwards off the platform, a bloody wreck.

The camera switches to a high shot over the room. We see RUPERT rising from his throne in shock, the Jellies whirl and face the intruders, and DMA stumbling away from the chopping block. The room goes quiet, and the background music starts playing the opening lines from “Kung Fu Fighting” by Carl Douglas.

 BACKGROUND MUSIC 
 Oh ho ho HOOOOOOOOOOOO…. 

With loud ‘Hiyah!’ shouts, the Jellies assume fighting stances and brandish their weapons.

 BACKGROUND MUSIC 
 Oh ho ho hoooooooooooooooooo…. 

With similar loud shouts, the Terminators assume fighting stances, while MATT belatedly raises his bolter and gives a half-hearted shout as well.

 BACKGROUND MUSIC 
 Everybody was kung fu fighting….. 

With more shouts, the Jellies and Terminators charge each other, while MATT moves off to one side, looking rather bemused.

 BACKGROUND MUSIC 
Those cats were fast as lightning…

The camera shows BOB in action. He blocks a stave blow from one Jelly, and then smashes the stave in half; a swift kick crushes the Jelly’s skull.

 BACKGROUND MUSIC 
 In fact, it was a little bit frightening…. 

SHADOW LOTUS is seen leaping into the air and smashing her foot into the face of a huge Jelly, dropping him like a rock. Pursued by two other Jellies, she runs across the room, and actually runs halfway up one of the walls, does a backflip and lands on her feet behind the two Jellies, and drops both of them with spine crushing blows from her fists.

 BACKGROUND MUSIC 
 But they fought with expert timing… 

GOLDEN SONG is seen surrounded by three Jellies. He makes a sudden twirling attack on one leg and simultaneously punches one Jelly in the groin, punches another in the kneecap and crushes it, and lashes out with a kick to break the neck of the third.

The background music fades as the camera pans out across the room, showing the battling Jellies and Terminators. The camera switches to the mob of techs and guards, looking on in fear. One of the guards nudges another and points to something off camera. The camera switches to their POV. We see MATT standing to one side of the melee, looking like he feels out of place. The guards and techs all draw their pistols and open fire on him. But the guns are small caliber and the bullets don’t come close to punching through his armor. MATT turns and looks on somewhat amused as the bullets ricochet off his armor. The guards stop firing when they realize they’re having no affect. MATT grins and raises the bolter.

 MATT 
My turn!

The camera switches to a close up view of the bolter muzzle; it fires on full automatic. Screams are briefly heard off camera.

The camera pulls back to a wider view of MATT, who ceases firing. He looks down at something off camera and makes a disgusted face.

 MATT 
Damn, bolters are so messy…

He turns suddenly and looks at something off camera. The camera switches to his POV, and we see RUPERT standing by a metal door behind the throne. MATT raises his bolter, but RUPERT moves through the door and slams it shut. MATT looks briefly disappointed and then hops up onto the platform. He finds DMA there, huddling on the ground, white and shaking.

 MATT 
Pull yourself together, man!

 DMA 
Easy for you to say!
You weren’t about to
have yourself shortened
by a head!

MATT pulls him to his feet, draws a knife, and cuts the ropes on his hands.

 MATT 
Hey, where are the others?

 DMA 
Down that stairwell over there, down in the dungeons.

 MATT 
Good. Search the guards, find the keys, and go get them.

DMA moves off to do that, and MATT stands ready, bolter raised. The camera switches to a wide view of the room, and we see that the Terminators have beaten all the Jellies. They run forward up to the steel door behind the throne.

 MATT 
What’s behind there?

 BOB 
Everything. The cloning tanks, the computers…
everything we need to destroy.

 MATT 
 (smacks forehead) 
Damn, I almost forgot! Look, guys, I need one of the chemicals
that they have in there. Destroy everything else, but leave the
jars of chemicals until I find what we came for in the first place.

 LEAPING DRAGON 
I don’t know… our goal is to destroy all the cloning
equipment so that the Clonemasters cannot ever return.

 MATT 
Look, we’ll take the whole supply of this one chemical
to our ship and then it’ll be gone to another timeline. I
wouldn’t ask, but there’s a life at stake here. He’s just a kid.
Sure, nobody really likes him and he’s a first class annoyance,
but still, he’s one of us.

 BOB 
Very well; we won’t destroy the chemical storage
until you find it. Now, for this door…

 MATT 
No wait! It’s my turn!

He pulls a block of C4 out of his pack and attaches it to the door. He puts in a fuse and motions everyone away to the sides. He pulls a remote detonator out of his pocket.

The camera switches to a view of the far side of the door. Two Jellies are standing guard there. The door suddenly explodes, and flying steel shards tear both Jellies to shreds. Moments later, the Terminators and MATT run through the doorway.

 MATT 
Ooh-rah! Now that’s how we open doors in my town!

 BOB 
Crude, but effective. Now… let’s split up. The computer banks
are there to the left, while the cloning facilities are through that
door to the right. The Master’s personal chambers lie ahead of us.
GOLDEN SONG and I shall take out the computers. The rest of
you, take out the clone tanks. When we’ve finished, we shall all
go forward and confront the Master himself. Move!

The team all nod in agreement, and then everyone moves off as directed.

 INT- COMPUTER CENTER- NIGHT 

The camera pans across a room filled with supercomputer towers, work stations, and monitors. Several techs are seen running around in here frantically. A serving girl with a tray and bottles is off to one side. Her scream attracts all the techs attention. The camera switches to the door, where BOB and GOLDEN SONG are seen entering the room. The two Terminators look at each other a moment, and then both grin. As the techs scream and run, the Terminators start gleefully smashing computer equipment with their bare fists. Sparks fly, lights blink, and smoke rises from the ruined equipment. The camera focuses in on GOLDEN SONG, who is happily pummeling a workstation. He pauses, and whirls around in fighting stance… but it is only the cowering serving girl, still holding onto her tray. GOLDEN SONG turns away… and the girl promptly smashes a bottle over his head. His eyes cross, he gets a goofy smile on his face, and birds are heard chirping for a moment.

 GOLDEN SONG 
Oh dear, Mummy, I seem to have stepped in something icky.

He topples sideways, out cold. The servant shrieks and runs as BOB leaps over. He ignores the girl, and puts a finger to GOLDEN SONG’S throat. After a moment, he stands, shakes his head in bemusement, and runs out of the room. The camera pans across the room, showing that it has been completely trashed.

 INT- CLONING ROOM- NIGHT 

The camera opens on a shot of the doorway to the room. SHADOW LOTUS and LEAPING DRAGON are seen running into the room, with MATT panting along behind them. They pause and look around. The camera switches to a view of the room. There is more computer equipment in here, but the room is dominated by a dozen huge glass tanks. Each is filled with amber liquid. Clones are growing in them, obviously those of RUPERT. They vary in development from skeletal to nearly complete. A pair of Jellies are seen in the room; they whirl to face the intruders. One with a staff charges at LEAPING DRAGON, who squares off against him. The other circles SHADOW LOTUS warily. He pulls out a pair of nunchuks and whirls them around his body in a display of amazing technique and skill, obviously the result of many years of training. SHADOW LOTUS watches him for a moment, and then suddenly grins and stands up straight. The Jelly looks at her in disbelief a moment, and then whirls around. MATT is there, a grin on his face and the bolter pointed right at the Jelly. He fires, and the Jelly goes down, hit in the chest. MATT looks around and sees the other Jelly lying dead at the feet of LEAPING DRAGON. He looks back at SHADOW LOTUS.

 MATT 
Thanks, babe! I always wanted to do the Indiana Jones thing.

Something small and metallic bounces off of his armor. As he looks around in puzzlement, the two Terminators whirl and crouch. Two Jellies are on top of the cloning tanks; each holds several throwing spikes. They start flinging them at the Terminators, who dodge and jump to avoid them. SHADOW LOTUS runs at one tank, dodging spikes all the way. She runs straight up the tank and begins fighting the Jelly on top of it. LEAPING DRAGON avoids most of the spikes, but one strikes him in the thigh. He contemptuously swats it aside, and continues forward. Suddenly, he stops and staggers, clutching at his chest. He collapses to his knees.

 LEAPING DRAGON 
P… p…. poison…

He falls face down to the floor. The Jelly who killed him stands up and spits at the body… and then he drops as a bolter round hits him in the chest. The camera switches to MATT, who lowers his bolter.

 MATT 
Idiot! Never stop to gloat over a fallen enemy in the middle of a fight!
Yeah, how do you like them apples, you goddamn… OOF!

MATT is knocked down on his back as another Jelly hops out from behind a tank and kicks him in the chest. He tries to raise the bolter, but it is kicked out of his hands. MATT frantically crawls backward on the floor, trying to get room to stand up, but the Jelly stalks after him.

The camera switches to SHADOW LOTUS, who slips a punch through the guard of the Jelly; he drops, rolls off the tank, and hits the floor with a bone crushing thud. She looks out over the room and sees that MATT is in trouble. She leaps to the floor and runs at the Jelly, who turns to face her. The two exchange blows for a while, and then the girl makes a sweeping kick that knocks the Jelly’s feet out from under him. He falls flat on the ground, and the girl’s heel crushes his head. MATT slowly gets to his feet, and sees SHADOW LOTUS kneeling by LEAPING DRAGON, feeling for a pulse. She stands and turns to MATT, shaking her head.

 MATT 
Damn. I’m really sorry.

 SHADOW LOTUS 
He died with honor. We need to move on.
The Clonemaster is still out there.
But first, we must destroy these tanks.

 MATT 
Oh yeah. Let me.

He opens fire with the bolter, spraying it across the room. The cloning tanks all smash and shatter, the liquid pouring over the room. MATT turns the gun on the computers, which also spark and shatter.

 MATT 
Wooeee! That’s always so damn much fun! Wait…

He walks over to a wall, where a large metal cabinet door is set into it. He knocks the padlock off with the butt of the bolter and opens it. Inside, there are dozens of large jars filled with assorted chemicals. The camera moves in on several large jars near the bottom of the rack; each is clearly marked “S-C-T.”

 MATT 
That’s it! Now… let’s take care of this RUPERT clown.

The two run out of the room.

 INT- CASTLE DUNGEON- NIGHT 

The crew members are seen in their cell, looking anxiously down the corridor. DMA suddenly comes into view, running towards them. He has a ring of keys in his hand. He stops and unlocks the cell door.

 DR. WHAT 
It’s good to see you’re still alive there, DMA…
but what the hell is going on up there?

 DMA 
Ninjas, guns, MATT… it’s complicated.
Let’s just get the hell out of here.

The team members push open the door, and then the entire group runs down the hallway, carrying MICHAEL with them.

 INT- THE MASTER’S QUARTERS- NIGHT 

The camera opens on a scene showing the door leading to the chambers. It is pushed open from the outside, and BOB is seen standing there. He cautiously walks into the room. The camera switches to a view from behind him as he moves forward. BOB moves down a short hallway and into a plush room with chairs and electronic devices. RUPERT is in here, cowering against a wall. BOB smiles nastily at him, and moves forward.

 BOB 
Your reign is at an end, Clonemaster.

BOB takes a quick step, but suddenly whirls as a Jelly runs out from another room. This one carries a katana, and seems quite skilled with it. BOB parries the blows with his arms, evading the point and edge. The Jelly gets frustrated and swings down at BOB’S head. BOB catches the sword between his palms, immobilizing it. With a quick twist, the blade shatters. BOB karate chops the Jelly on the neck, dropping him instantly. He turns back towards RUPERT… and staggers as a gunshot is heard.

The camera switches to RUPERT. He is holding a huge high tech pistol in his hands, and is pointing it at BOB. The Terminator looks shakily down at the wound in the left side of his chest, bleeding heavily. He groans and collapses to the floor.

RUPERT turns as running footsteps are heard off camera. He points the pistol as SHADOW LOTUS and MATT run into the room. They stop, looking at BOB on the floor, and the huge gun in RUPERT’S hand.

 RUPERT 
Stop! This pistol will shoot even
through that armor of yours, outlander.
 (angry voice) 
You destroyed it all! I have lived for generations, and
now all is at an end! When this body grows old or is
damaged, I must stay in it. This is the last of my life!

 MATT 
Oh boo hoo… welcome to the real world.
The rest of us live that way all the time.

 RUPERT 
But… I am a Master, not one of you commoners!
At least, I will have the pleasure of seeing you die.

He points the pistol at MATT. He tenses, and SHADOW LOTUS prepares to spring at the Master. But everyone freezes as a sound is heard from behind RUPERT, who turns to look. BOB is standing there. One arm hangs uselessly, and he is white from blood loss, but he stands firmly upright. RUPERT swings the gun around to bear on him, but BOB catches it in one hand. He crushes both gun and hand in his grip. RUPERT screams and falls to his knees.

 BOB 
Time to die, Clonemaster.

With a mighty shout, BOB swings his good hand in a long arc. His fist crashes into RUPERT’S chest, and a horrible cracking sound is heard. The Master flies into the opposite wall, and the body slides down to the floor. The camera goes to a brief close up shot of RUPERT’S eyes… they are open and staring blankly at nothing; he is dead.

BOB sinks to his knees, as MATT and SHADOW LOTUS run up to him.

 BOB 
All is done. The Clonemaster is overthrown
and he is dead. Now, I can die with honor.

 MATT 
Damn, what’s with you guys and all the dying with honor?
We have a doctor on the ship who can fix you up.

 BOB 
Really? That’d be swell.

He passes out. MATT lowers him to the ground and stands up. He turns to SHADOW LOTUS, who has a distant and sad look on her face.

 MATT 
Oh. Hey, I really am sorry
about LEAPING DRAGON.

SHADOW LOTUS nods, but still looks unhappy. MATT puts a comforting arm around her, and then hastily withdraws it.

 MATT 
Oh! Sorry! I forgot
the whole discipline thing.

SHADOW LOTUS looks at him speculatively.

 SHADOW LOTUS 
Actually… why not.

She hugs MATT so hard that his armor creaks. He stares down at her in shock.

 MATT 
Wait… huh… what about all
that denial and discipline stuff?

 SHADOW LOTUS 
Well, the Clonemaster is dead,
so the need for all that discipline
is kind of gone. I’ve been denying
myself for a long time, and I
want to make up for lost time.
You up for it?

 MATT 
Am I ever! But… damn, there’s
so much to do. We gotta get the
SynCereThol up to the ship and
get TORQUMADA to fix up BOB,
and then we have to get the ship
ready to shift away, have DAVE
get the engines spun up…
 (pause) 
Wait… DAVE HOWERY…
where’s he been this whole time?!

 SHADOW LOTUS 
Can’t the others do that?

 MATT 
Why… yes, they can.

He takes hold of the girl’s hand, and the two practically run from the room.

 INT- MANOR HALL- NIGHT 

The team members from the AH.COM are seen in here, looking around at all the devastation. MATT and SHADOW LOTUS run into the room, still holding hands. They stop in front of DR. WHAT.

 MATT 
HiDOCthisisSHADOWLOTUSshe’sreallyneat,hey,
theSynCereTholisoverthereinthatroompastthe
steeldoorandweneedtogetTORQtofixupBOB,
ohIdidn’ttellyouaboutBOB,he’sreallyneat,but
he’shurtbad,soheneedsadoctor,oh,andRUPERTisdead.
 (pause) 
Bye!

He and SHADOW LOTUS run out of the room. The others look at each other in confusion.

 DR. WHAT 
Any of you get any of that?

 IRONYUPPIE 
I think he said something about needing to fix up
some guy named BOB with TORQUMADA.
Funny, I didn’t think he swung that way.

 LANDSHARK 
No, my dear, that wasn’t quite right. He said the SynCereThol
is over there in a room past that steel door, and that someone
named BOB needs a doctor’s services, so we need to notify
TORQUMADA. Also, that RUPERT is dead.

 DR. WHAT 
As usual, LANDSHARK, you have the right of it.
Well, it sounds as if everything worked out right
in the end. So, let’s go get the SCT and…
 (pause) 
Oh my God! I think MATT is going to get laid!

 HENDRYK 
But… that’s not fair! I’m the one who
goes for the hot Asian girls! That’s my shtick!

 TWO DAYS LATER 

 INT- AH.COM MED BAY- DAY 

DR. WHAT and TORQUMADA are seen in here, standing over LUAKEL’S bed. The boy looks much better, although he has a bandage around his head.

 DR. WHAT 
Is he going to make it?

 TORQUMADA 
Yes. I went in, stopped the leak, and replaced
his cerebral fluid. He should wake up in a day or two.

 DR. WHAT 
Can’t you keep him under for a week or so?
Oh never mind… I’m just glad everything
worked out in the end.

 TORQUMADA 
Well, there’s still MATT to deal with.

The two turn and look at another bed. MATT lies on it, with LANDSHARK looking over him, puffing on his meerschaum pipe. MATT looks strangely deflated, as if most of his bodily fluids have been drained out of him. Four huge electrolyte bags are hanging on IV units, run into his arms. Although he is obviously unconscious, MATT has a huge grin on his face.

 TORQUMADA 
Well, he lost a hell of a lot of fluid, but he should recover.
We’ll just keep on pumping him full of replacements,
and he’ll come around.

 DR. WHAT 
So, then, it did all work out well in the end.
LUAKEL is saved, MATT hooked up with
a hot Asian girl, and best of all,
we got LANDSHARK back.

The final scene shows LANDSHARK nodding in agreement, smiling as he puffs on his meerschaum pipe.

 

 

 END ACT II 

 TAG 

 

 
 

 INT- STUDIO- DAY 

The camera shows PSYCHOMELTDOWN, DR. WHAT, and THANDE all sitting in chairs, writing on sheets of paper. They stop, lean back, and stretch.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
There! A whole episode completed,
and not once do we insult LANDSHARK.
IAN will be happy with us.

 DR. WHAT 
True. Hey, what the hell
is meerschaum anyway?

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Uh… something they make pipes out of?

 THANDE 
Damn colonials. No, it’s…

IAN suddenly pops into the scene, out of thin air.

 IAN 
I changed my mind. Go back to abusing LANDSHARK.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
What? Why?

 IAN 
This was a mistake. I mean, look at this episode. He is so
BORRRRIIIINNNGGG! I wanted dry humor, but I guess
you guys aren’t up to that. He came across as stuffy, not
humorous. And the rest of the crew… sheesh! MATT
wasn’t nearly snarky enough… and he got laid! That was
never supposed to happen! And GREY WOLF never had
a drink the whole episode. And FLOCC in a damn turban!
And you practically emasculated IRONYUPPIE.

 DR. WHAT 
Uh, she’s a girl, she can’t be…

 IAN 
 (smacks DR. WHAT on the head) 
I know that! I meant, she was all lovey dovey over LANDSHARK,
and she couldn’t even take out a couple of kung fu guys… she should
have mopped the floor with them! And then, there was the fact that
everyone was so LANDSHARK happy, just couldn’t get enough
of the guy. So, go back to abusing him.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Okay… but… can we have DAVE HOWERY back?
If you want LANDSHARK abused, he’s really the best at it.

 IAN 
Mmm…. Okay.

IAN snaps his fingers and disappears. Simultaneously, DAVE HOWERY appears. He runs his hands over his body, and finally his crotch. He gets a very relieved look on his face.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Oh thank God… uh, IAN. It’s still there.

 THANDE 
Why wouldn’t it be? What did IAN do to you?

 DAVE HOWERY 
I’d rather not talk about it. So… what’s up?

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
IAN brought you back. He wants us to go back
to abusing LANDSHARK in the episodes again.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Well, that’s good news! I’ll get right on that…
 (pause) 
Say, I can’t seem to move my feet.

He struggles to move, but his feet seem to be solidly glued to the floor. He looks over at the other Writer Chimps, and they seem to have the same problem. DAVE HOWERY suddenly groans, grabs his stomach, and bends over. He massively breaks wind.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Oh no! Galloping Flatulence!

 DR. WHAT 
For Christ’s sake, DAVE… you invented it, how do you cure it?

 DAVE HOWERY 
I don’t (fart) know, the only (fart) 
thing I do (fart) know is that it is (fart) 
highly contagious (fart) !

The other Writer Chimps panic and try to move, but can’t. Suddenly, all three groan, grab their stomachs, and bend over. As the screen fades to black with the sounds of incredible flatulence in the background, IAN is heard chuckling over the black.

 IAN 
Hee hee! Galloping flatulence! That is just so funny…

 EXT. –HUB – DAY 

 

A vortex opens up and the Hairplane appears.

It’s obvious that it has suffered major damage and there is significantly less hair along its surface than before. It slowly flies towards the docking bays of the Hub.

 INT. -HAIRPLANE THRONE ROOM – DAY 

JUSTIN PICKARD is seen brooding on his throne. RAN EXILIS walks into the room and bows.

 RAN EXILIS 
Your Hairiness! We shall be docking within five minutes.
We have already made enquiries regarding repairs to the ship.
With luck, we shall be fully operational within 8 hours.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (nodding head) 
So our Great Mission will be able to be continued.
 (beat) 
We will need a replacement crew member.

 RAN EXILIS 
I shall see to that myself!

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Very well—but I wish to interview
them myself, Hirsute Prime.

 RAN EXILIS 
 (bowing head) 
As you wish, my Piliferous Liege!

 INT. – OUROBOROS – DAY 

We see RAN EXILIS sitting at a table in a relatively quiet area of the Pub. Standing with their backs to us are several bald men in a line.

MONTAGE OF INTERVIEWS

 RAN EXILIS 
Name?

 FIGURE 
Fernidad of Prussia.

 RAN EXILIS 
Are you willing to give your ultimate
loyalty to his Hairiness Justin Pickard?

 KING FERNIDAD 
Yes—but I have certain conditions.

 RAN EXILIS 
Oh?

 KING FERNIDAD 
Do not under any circumstances discuss in my presence
the Weimar Republic, Bonaparte, or anything related to
Germany, Prussia or the such. This is a request from the Sovereign Himself, namely myself.

 RAN EXILIS 
 (raising an eyebrow) 
You know—I would be more impressed
if it wasn’t for the fact that it’s suppose
to be KING FERDINAND and not
KING FERNIDAD. Next!

WIPE-CUT TO:

 RAN EXILIS 
 (looking over a resume) 
Hmmm…interesting…uh-huh…okay—looks good.
 (beat) 
So—any questions, Mr…Legend?

 HELLOLEGEND 
Yes—You ever wonder what if Britney Spears
never became a Mousketeer?
Oh! I know! Let me put together a poll and –

 RAN EXILIS 
NEXT!

WIPE-CUT TO:

 RAN EXILIS 
So—you’re a two headed person, ROEDECKER/YULAW?

 ROEDECKER/YULAW 
Yes.

 RAN EXILIS 
Well—we don’t discriminate
here as long as you are loyal.

 ROEDECKER/YULAW 
 (together) 
Good.

 RAN EXILIS 
So –tell me a bit about your beliefs.
 (pause) 
You do you admire more than anyone else in the entire multi-verse?

 ROEDECKER/YULAW 
 (dreamy voice) 
Mmmmm…Ann Coulter.

 RAN EXILIS 
 (startled) 
I beg your pardon?

 ROEDECKER/YULAW 
 (still with the dreamy voice) 
God’s gift to humanity.
Oh Ann…your Adam’s apple is
sooooo sexy…Mmmmmmmmm…

RAN EXILIS stares in shock for a second, then reaches down and picks up a fork and jabs it repeatedly into his eye.

 RAN EXILIS 
NEXT!

WIPE-CUT TO:

 RAN EXILIS 
So—tell me a little bit about yourself, Mr. Reynolds.
 (blinks) 
John Reynolds? Say—is that your real name or are you
identifying with that Union general who got killed the
first day at the battle of Gettysburg?
 (sotto voce to himself) 
I’m guessing the former, as the latter assumes this guy
actually read a book sometime in his life…

 JOHN REYNOLDS 
Noes! Yuo ares the oens who hasnt red a boook

LEARN TO THINK YOU INCONTINENT FUCK HEAD!!

 RAN EXILIS 
NEXT!

WIPE-CUT TO:

RAN EXILIS sitting at the table, looking simultaneously tired, annoyed and mildly depressed.

 RAN EXILIS 
 (with absolutely no enthusiasm whatsoever) 
And your name is…?

 RAN EXILIS 
 (blinking eyes in confusion) 
Huh?

 IDONTKNOWWHEREIAM 
 (monotone voice) 
I am a worshipper of Meierism

 RAN EXILIS 
 (even more confused) 
You worship a computer game maker?

 IDONTKNOWWHEREIAM 
He is God. There is proof. He is god. Dont doubt the Almighty one.
Doubting him is High Treason and Hersery! Punishment is immediat
death. No trial. No Jury. . Play his games. Worship
him. most off Sacrafice Small animals in his name. Give your soul to him.
He is god. :D:D . Do not doubt him. You will be assimilated!

 ACT I 

 
 

 
 

 INT. – DIMLY LIT CORRIDOR – NIGHT 

We see the bald goons RAN EXILIS, CARL, GENERAL TIU, HOBELHOUSE, EUIO, BLACKMAGE, and REDEM walking down a Hub corridor. RAN EXILIS is looking very depressed while the others are carrying numerous boxes and crates.

 BLACKMAGE 
Maybe we’ll have better luck trying another Pub?

 RAN EXILIS 
I have a feeling that probably won’t be very successful either.
 (sighing) 
Let’s face it—the quality of your average minion and
goon has been dropping precipitously over the last few years.

 REDEM 
But fortunately we are top quality minions!
 (no pause at all) 
Ooops!

He trips and falls to the ground; the others trip over him and collapse on top of him in a heap. Boxes and crates fall to the ground with a deafening crash. For some reason, a cymbal rolls out of the heap and rolls down the corridor for a few seconds before falling on its side with a loud clang.

RAN EXILIS sighs.

 RAN EXILIS 
Mother warned me there will be days like this…

RAN EXILIS suddenly blinks and takes a step back. Appearing out of the shadows are several figures, all heavily clad in leather jackets and skimasks.

All except one—who for some reason is wearing a WW1 Reichswehr uniform instead.

The lead figure steps forward.

 FIGURE 1 
 (very bad American thug accent) 
Ok—youse guys will hand over all youse stuff
or we’ll break your – I mean youse – legs.

Several other figures step forward.

 FIGURE 2 
 (also with a very bad American thug accent—
but this one with British accent undertone) 
You don’t wanna make us angry. Youse
wouldn’t like it to see us angry.

FIGURE 3 (wearing the German uniform) steps forward.

 FIGURE 3 
 (waving, for some reason, a cricket bat) 
Ja! Und ve vill bitch-slap you eine thirty zeconds if you don’t comply, ja!

 RAN EXILIS 
 (slowly backing away) 
Look—we don’t want any trouble but we don’t have
anything valuable. These crates just have parts for our ship…

 FIGURE 3 
Nein! Ve will decide vhat’s valuable…

The figures all step forward, waving assorted weapons and trying (with varying degrees of success) to look tough and dangerous.

Another figure—this one tall, muscular, shirtless and bald—suddenly appears behind the thugs. He’s still in the shadows, so we can’t get a good look at him.

 TALL BALD FIGURE 
Leave them alone or you will have to answer to me!

 FIGURE 1 
Ha! One against eight! What
can one man do against all of us?

 TALL BALD FIGURE 
This!

The TALL BALD FIGURE tackles the gang of thugs, kicking and punching every one of them. He moves fantastically fast and the thugs are too slow to react. In a matter of a few seconds, the TALL BALD FIGURE is standing alone (still in shadows) , surrounded by numerous thugs groaning on the ground.

 TALL BALD FIGURE 
Quickly! Follow me! They may have some friends!

The TALL BALD FIGURE and the BALD GOONS pick up all their crates and rush off.

 INT. HAIRPLANE THRONE ROOM – DAY 

JUSTIN PICKARD is sitting on his throne, listening to RAN EXILIS

 RAN EXILIS 
…and that’s what happened, Your Hairiness!

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Interesting.
 (beat) 
And this individual –you say that he is open
to the possibility of joining our crew?

 RAN EXILIS 
Indeed! He literally jumped at the chance when I
explained to him the conditions for employment!
He said that for a chance to get his hair back, he’ll
gladly sign up for TWO years service—as long as
he gets a chance to beat up more people.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
He will certainly have his wish in the near future.
Step forward, candidate!

REVERSE SHOT – Camera facing JUSTIN PICKARD with the various minions’ backs to us.

The TALL BALD FIGURE steps forward from the shadows and comes to attention in front of JUSTIN PICKARD, his back to us.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
What name do you go with?

 TALL BALD FIGURE 
I am known by many names but you may know me as—
 (beat) 

Camera swings around and now shows a much clearer full face shot of the TALL BALD FIGURE.

 TALL BALD FIGURE 
Mr Nelson.

Fade to black, dramatic music.

 INT. – HUB – DIMLY LIT CORRIDOR – NIGHT 

As before. As we watch, the masked THUGs begin to get up from their prone positions, rubbing their arms and legs and groaning. One of them is still wearing a WW1 Reichswehr uniform instead, although he has a ski mask as well.

As we watch, one of the leather-jacketed figures removes his ski mask to reveal that he is MATT.

 MATT 
 (rubbing a bruise) 
Hey! Kit! You told us this friend
of yours was just going to play-act!

A second figure pulls off his mask to reveal he’s KIT.

 KIT 
 (smirking) 
I’m sorry, but my…friend cannot help
but excel in everything he does.
And it had to look realistic.

A third jacketed figure removes his mask to reveal he’s DMA.

 DMA 
Strewth, Kit, if you knew he was going
to beat us up this much, why did you
volunteer to come along?

 KIT 
 (looking down at himself) 
Any excuse to wear this much leather.

DMA nods in understanding. The two remaining JACKETED THUGS remove their masks – they are OBERDADA and CARLTON BACH.

 OBERDADA 
Zere is vun sing I do not understand.
 (nods at UNIFORMED THUG) 
Vhy is zer Englaender dressed as such?

The UNIFORMED THUG pulls off his mask to reveal he’s LANDSHARK.

 DMA 
Yeah, Sharky.
Jeez – the orders said ‘AH.commers and
Germans dress as thugs’ not ‘AH.commers
dress as Germans’!

 LANDSHARK 
 (faraway look) 
Am being postmodern, ja?

 MATT 
You make a very convincing Kraut, Sharkie.

 LANDSHARK 
 (reddens) 
I do believe I haff been insulted by
ein verdammt-Kolonialen!

LANDSHARK takes a threatening step towards MATT but DMA hastily imposes himself in between.

 DMA 
Look, kobberen, we’re all on
the same side here, okay, mein freunden?
 (everyone nods reluctantly) 
Kommen, ve’ll return to the ship and
see vhat happens.

The unmasked THUGS walk off down the corridor. KIT pauses, exchanging a funny look with MATT.

 KIT 
Are you noticing any strange behaviour from them?

 MATT 
More so than normal?
 (laughs) 
Nein.

He walks after the others. KIT shakes his head and follows.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE – THRONE ROOM – DAY 

JUSTIN PICKARD on his throne as before, watching with interest as the bald FELLATIO NELSON goes to work, ordering about the other BALD GOONS.

 FELLATIO NELSON 
 (glancing at plans) 
Right, we need the Engineer from Oz on this one…
 (pointing to BLACKMAGE) 
You! E.O.!

 EUIO 
Yes?

 FELLATIO NELSON 
No, not you, Euio, E.O.,
I wanted you, E.O.!
 (points at BLACKMAGE) 

 BLACKMAGE 
 (confused, points at EUIO) 
Him, E.O.?

 FELLATIO NELSON 
No, you, E.O.!

 EUIO 
 (even more confused) 
Yes?

FELLATIO NELSON sighs and goes down to explain. JUSTIN PICKARD watches as FELLATIO NELSON guides them through the repairs to several of the damaged panels and consoles. As we watch, RAN EXILIS comes up in the background and stands beside JUSTIN PICKARD’s throne, a bit of a sour expression on his face.

 FELLATIO NELSON 
…and look, if you reroute this thingummybob
up the double gasket and round the neutronic inverter,
you increase the power so we can complete the repairs
in only three hours.

 BLACKMAGE 
Huh?
 (looks into console) 
Wow, you’re right!

FELLATIO NELSON shuts the open panel with finality and smirks, while the other BALD GOONS applaud.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
A most useful addition to our crew.
I commend your choice, Hirsuite Prime.

 RAN EXILIS 
 (glaring at FELLATIO NELSON) 
I…am glad you think so, your Lanatity.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (smiling) 
I suspect you think he is trying to usurp
your position as Hirsuite Prime?

 RAN EXILIS 
 (looking down, ashamed) 
My apologies, your Downiness.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (laughs) 
Do not fear. I do not forget your long loyalty to me.

 RAN EXILIS 
 (relieved) 
Thank you, your Flocculency-

JUSTIN PICKARD, enraged beyond words suddenly strikes out with his left hand. STRANDS OF HAIR curl from the back of his hand, growing with unnatural speed, and wrap themselves around RAN EXILIS’ neck. The startled Dutchman claws at the strands of hair as they begin to choke him.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (softly) 
Not that, Exilis.
Any hair-related title but that.

 RAN EXILIS 
 (purple in face) 
As…you…please, your…Pilosity…

JUSTIN PICKARD flicks his wrist and the strands of hair release RAN EXILIS, who feels his bruised throat and takes in gasps of air. The hair wriggles away like snakes and into the structure of the ship itself, until it is indistinguishable from the rest of the carpet of brown hair on all the walls and floor of the Hairplane.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (quietly) 
Do not fail me again.

JUSTIN PICKARD turns to FELLATIO NELSON, who is still helping the other BALD GOONS make repairs.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Mr. Nelson!

 FELLATIO NELSON 
 (turning around) 
Sir!

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
I require assistance.

JUSTIN PICKARD sticks out his right hand, closes his eyes as though in meditation, and makes significant Jedi-like gestures. More coils of brown hair stretch out from the walls all around him and the throne, and form the shape of one of the contour multiverse-maps.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (in slightly strained tones) 
We require a new target for our weapon.
A timeline with a small population,
one recovering from a great disaster, perhaps.

 FELLATIO NELSON 
 (looking at map) 
I believe I know just the place.
 (points at node on map) 
Here. An Earth where a Lovecraftian cult
unleashed Hollywood monsters on the world.
Only a few million people are left.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (steepling his fingers) 
Exxxcellent.

The hair-map collapses. JUSTIN PICKARD turns to RAN EXILIS.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Mr Exilis…plot us a course to that planet.

RAN EXILIS looks mortally pissed off that he’s not being referred to as Hirsuite Prime, and sends another glare at FELLATIO NELSON’s way, who ignores it.

 RAN EXILIS 
As you wish…your Villousness.

RAN EXILIS stumps away. If there were any cans around, he’d kick them. FELLATIO NELSON smiles, and JUSTIN PICKARD returns it.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Competence can get you to the top
very quickly in my organization, Mr Nelson.

 FELLATIO NELSON 
I always take advantage of anything
that gets me on top, your Cugliness.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Cugliness? What does this mean?
I have not heard this word before…?

 FELLATIO NELSON 
Allow me to explain. With diagrams.

As FELLATIO NELSON smirks, the camera pans behind his back, to where he is holding a small remote-control-like device. He presses a button and a light flashes red, once.

 EXT. – SUNLIT ISLAND – DAY 

The Caribbean on the infected world again. THANDE is fiddling with a small portable spectrometer, looking at the readings and seeming frustrated. As we watch, he slams it down.

 THANDE 
Ee, chuff me.
So close, and yet…
 (shakes head) 
Summat missin’. But wha’?
I can’t think. Mi brain’s gooin’ numb.

TORQUMADA walks up, walking with an unsteady gait and leaning on BOBO. He’s holding a test tube with some green fluid in it.

 TORQUMADA 
Boy, I say, boy, what about this one, y’all?

TORQUMADA puts the tube in THANDE’s spectrometer. The screen comes up with some results.

 THANDE 
Closest yet! But no’ close enough.
Still summat missin’.

 TORQUMADA 
Boy, what you talkin’ about, boy?
 (clutches chest) 
Ugh…the virus…
We’re turning into mindless stereotypes…

 THANDE 
Speak for thiself, tha knows.

TORQUMADA slips off BOBO and collapses onto the floor. Moments later, THANDE also topples as the virus takes over.

BOBO watches, looking as worried as a flying brain can.

 BOBO 
No.
Not. Let. Happen.
 (looks at test tube) 
Something. Missing.
Bobo. Find. It.
Save. Torqumada.

As we watch, BOBO turns, takes to the air and flies off, desperately scanning the ground. The bodies of THANDE and TORQUMADA remain still, occasionally jerking as though in a deep dream, puffs of green virus gas surrounding them.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – BRIDGE – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT is pacing back and forth. As we watch, the doors open and PSYCHOMELTDOWN, blackened, burned and with his afro hair now mixed up with soot and other horrible substances, runs in pell-mell, screaming. He pauses, glances around with wild, animal eyes, and then darts off through another door.

The first door then opens again and DAVE HOWERY comes out, waving a huge socket wrench and panting.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Dammit. Which way did my lavatory brush go?

Everyone points at the second door.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Thank you.
 (beat) 
Oh, and by the way, the repairs are
completed and we’ve refuelled.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (distractedly) 
Good work, Dave.

DAVE HOWERY nods and runs off after PSYCHOMELTDOWN.

DOCTOR WHAT paces for a few more moments, then sits down, brooding.

 KIT 
 (from comm station) 
Doc, he might not be able to report in for hours.
Who knows when he’ll have a chance-

As he speaks, the console beeps.

 KIT 
Ah…speak of the devil…
 (looks at readings) 
That’s the AOK signal.
Pickard has fallen for his plan.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nodding) 
Good.

 KIT 
 (console beeps again) 
Steffen for you…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Put it up.

STEFFEN’s image appears again.

 STEFFEN 
Ve haff completed repairs.
 (beat) 
Zer Bad Guys haff fallen fur it, ja?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Seems so. You know the place.

 STEFFEN 
 (nodding grimly) 
Ja. Und zis time he vill not escape.
 (eyes burning) 
No…matter…vhat.

The screen goes black. DOCTOR WHAT shivers, then pulls himself together.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Shift us to the Hollywood timeline!

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR HUB 

We see the AH.com and German ships pulling away from the Hub, then go into vortexes almost simultaneously.

 EXT. – SPACE – EARTH ORBIT 

The two ships erupt from their respective vortexes and settle into Earth orbit.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – BRIDGE – DAY 

We see DOCTOR WHAT pacing near the command chair.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Put the Germans back on screen.

The viewscreen changes to show STEFFEN.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
My crew and I have been here before, Captain—I’m
going to go down and see if we can organize another
defense like we did in the last timeline. Coordinate
with my crew on any other battle plans you may have.

 STEFFEN 
Ja—my crew haff been analyzing der last battle ve had
und ve dink ve might be able to commen up vith some useful ideas.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Good, good—by the way, how’s my
crewmember MICHAEL doing?

MICHAEL pokes his head into view.

 MICHAEL 
 (grinning) 
Ja! Zis guys are ze best—ich am learning zu much!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (staring at MICHAEL in utter confusion for a moment; then shrugging his shoulders) 
 (sotto voce) 
Damn Aussie humour.
 (normal voice) 
Ok—as long as you’re having fun. Screen off.

DOCTOR WHAT walks out the bridge doors.

 EXT.–RUINS OF LOS ANGELES – DAY 

The shuttle ‘Rita Faltoyano’ is seen flying over the ruined city.

Although much of the city still lies in rubble, we notice that some of the streets have been cleared of debris. People, various farm animals—and even the occasional car or truck—can be seen using the roads.

On the outskirts of the city can be seen dozens of new homes with small garden plots and the occasional greenhouse on their property. Dozens of other houses can be seen in varying degrees of completion.

The shuttle sets down on a large empty field near the town.

A figure walks from away the collection of homes and towards the shuttle. A few minutes later he arrives at the shuttle to find DOCTOR WHAT waiting outside the shuttle.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Professor Zoomar. Long time no see.

 ZOOMAR 
 (smiling) 
Indeed. Have to admit it was a pleasant surprise to hear from you again.

They shake hands and start walking back towards the houses.

 ZOOMAR 
So—why are you here? Your message was somewhat vague…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (sighing) 
I may have some bad news…

 INT.- HOME – KITCHEN – DAY 

ZOOMAR is making a cup of tea and serving it on a table made up of a strange black plastic like substance—which we suddenly notice is, in fact, giant ant chitin.

 ZOOMAR 
 (off DOCTOR WHAT’s expression) 
Can’t let all that stuff go to waste after all—there
are millions of dead giant ants out there. Useful
substance, chitin. And the other monster carcasses
were pretty useful too.
 (beat) 
 (smiling face) 
You should have seen the Bar-B-Que we had
when that giant pterodactyl finally died.
 (sips tea) 
So—our world might be in danger again.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grimly) 
Not if I can help it!
 (beat) 
I was wondering what kind of defense you
will be able to put together?

ZOOMAR laughs.

 ZOOMAR 
Defense?
 (beat; more serious tone) 
Unfortunately—none at all. While all the Hollywood Monsters have died out—
thanks to your crew—this world will take decades to recover from all the
damage that has occurred over the last fifty years. Even after all this time,
we’re in contact with only about fifty or sixty settlements across North America
and a handful of others in Europe and South America. The rebuilding process
will be very slow.
 (beat) 
However—we HAVE accomplished a lot, as you can tell by looking around us.
It’s just nowhere enough to be of any help to you. The best I can do is contact
those settlements and tell them to prepare those old bunkers of theirs again,
just to be on the safe side.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
That will only save a small percentage of this
planet’s population—the rest will be in danger.

 ZOOMAR 
I know—but that’s the best we can do.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nodding head reluctantly) 
I know.
 (gets up) 
My crew will do everything we can to stop that ship. Count on it.

 ZOOMAR 
Thank you. I best go and warn people.

DOCTOR WHAT
You guys alright for supplies? My ship doesn’t
have much but maybe we can beam down some
extra food and weapons and generators and stuff?

 ZOOMAR 
Much appreciated. Good luck.

DOCTOR WHAT is about to leave when he stops and turns back around. ZOOMAR raises an eyebrow in confusion.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
One last thing. I have to know. You said that
you ate that giant pterodactyl. How DOES
Giant Pterodactyl taste like?

 ZOOMAR 
 (ponders for a moment) 
Chicken of course.

DOCTOR WHAT rolls his eyes and walks away.

 EXT.- EARTH ORBIT – DAY 

The shuttle ‘Rita Faltoyano’ flies back towards the AH.Com ship.

 INT. –SHUTTLE – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT hits the comm. button.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Doc returning to ship.
 (beat) 
Those guys down there are in no shape to defend themselves.
Looks like we’re really on our own this time.

 LEO 
Understood Doc.
The Germans have been discussing some interesting
battle tactic strategies with us.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I’ve been thinking of a few ideas myself, LEO.
Hopefully we will be able to stop Justin once and for all here.

 LEO 
I hope so too.
 (beat) 
By the way, Doc, I’ve been meaning to tell you about this glitch
I keep detecting in my main navicomp archive system…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (interrupting) 
Will that have any effect on any of our battle scenarios
or your primary defensive and offensive systems?

 LEO 
 (almost insulted tone of voice) 
Well—no, of course not—don’t be silly—
the navicomp system has absolutely nothing whatsoever
to do with that kind of stuff but…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Then it will just have to wait, LEO!
 (sighing) 
Look—I know the ship is messed up and you’re overdue
for a upgrade and stuff and I know that I keep putting off
doing all those necessary repairs and upkeep.
I promise you that once all this over I’ll take the ship to the Hub
and splurge on a major overhaul of the entire ship and your systems,
but this stuff will just have to wait for now.

 LEO 
 (resigned voice) 
Very well.
 (sotto voce) 
Damn fleshbag.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Huh? What did you say?

 LEO 
Nothing! Shuttle docking in 2 minutes.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nodding head) 
Oh—LEO—check the inventories and see if we
have any extra stuff we can afford to spare,
and arrange to have it beamed to the planet below…

 LEO 
Will do.

 EXT.- SHUTTLE – SPACE 

The shuttle flies towards the AH.Com ship.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP CONTROL ROOM – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT, GBW, ALAYTA, LANDSHARK and several other AH.commers are sitting around the table. They are in the middle of a heated discussion.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Another Daring Commando Raid™?
With HIM? Is that wise?

 GBW 
Well—he is under medication now.
It should keep the psychotic tendencies under control.
 (beat) 
Hopefully.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
But why him of all people?

 GBW 
He’s had personal history with this guy, Doc.
He knows how he thinks.
Besides which–Justin will probably act all irrational when he sees him too.
We can use that to our advantage—
especially if he screws up and starts getting sloppy.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I’ll prefer that we have a few of our people with him—
and better bring the Germans in on this.

 ALAYTA 
I haff already contacted mein ship—
Kapitan STEFFEN and First Mate SUSANO
vill be joining ze assault team themselves.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Very well—but this is not a suicide mission, ok?!
You guys go in, cause as much damage and get as
much information as you can and then you get out
again, preferably in one piece.

 GBW 
 (sotto voce) 
With G.BONE at the controls that might be tough to do.

 G.BONE 
 (looking up from a book he’s reading titled ‘Danny and the Dinosaur’) 
Hey! I resent that! I’ll have you know that I’m really smart and—
 (glances back at book) 
Ooooh—they’re playing hide and go seek!
 (goes back to reading) 

DOCTOR WHAT sighs.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP–TRANSPORTER ROOM – DAY 

We see STEFFEN and SUSANO standing together, waiting for others to show up. They seem to be in a spirited debate. G.BONE is sitting on the floor, playing with some marbles.

 SUSANO 
—CAN der President do zat? I dink not! Ze problem vith
his position iz that he iz much like der old British Queen –
officially, he signs law, appoints ministers und so forth but
none uff it on his own authority. It’s a purely, utterly
ceremonial position. Ideally, the Bundestag vould haff to
vote in a new Chancellor ASAP. Now, iff neither Bundestag
nor Gemeinsamer Ausschuss can convene–well, then you
can assume that zer iz no functioning central German government,
anyways. In any case- eine must look at vhat zer Basic Law
says about provisions for ze State uff Defense…

 STEFFEN 
 (interupting) 
Bah—Article 69 CLEARLY states zat ze remaining ministers
vould stay in office for a short period und administer through
statutory instruments, until a new Chancellor iz elected through –

 SUSANO 
 (interrupting) 
-ah—but 69.3 iz zer important part! So der answer iz generally
“Yes, but”. It seems it requires zer presence uff either der Chancellor
or ze President und iz only temporary until
Bundestag can elect a new Chancellor und-

 STEFFEN 
 (interrupting) 
-69.3?! Zat only applies uff ve have a rump parliament!

 SUSANO 
Nein! You are forgetting about Article 115i which is to
be read in conjunction vith 115f, which CLEARLY states zat—

The two of them are interrupted by the door being opened.

 STEFFEN 
 (annoyed) 
Bah—ve vill continue zis most
interesting conversation another time!

 SUSANO 
 (happily) 
Ja!

We see WEAPON M walk in, holding a BFG. A few seconds later, HENDRYK and LUAKEL walk in, pushing a stretcher which has a figure lying on it. They slowly swing the stretcher into an upright position.

We see the figure is FLOCCULENCIO. He is wrapped up in white pajama style asylum pants and matching straight jacket with the sleeves tied behind his back. He’s also wearing a leather muzzle mask tied with heavy elastic straps to his face.

All of his limbs are securely fastened with heavy chains to metal restraints on the stretcher.

 HENDRYK 
Good thing IRONYUPPIE had all this stuff handy in her quarters…

 LUAKEL 
That explains the fresh pine scent

 WEAPON M 
Ok guys—you know what you have to do.

HENDRYK and LUAKEL take a few steps back and pull out what look like long electric cattle prods. They point it at FLOCCULENCIO, both of them sweating nervously.

WEAPON M takes a few steps forward and holds up a long key in front of FLOCCULENCIO’s face.

 WEAPON M 
If we let you out, are you gonna play nice, Flocc?

FLOCCULENCIO nods.

WEAPON M starts undoing all the restraints, then quickly takes a step back—his BFG at the ready.

FLOCCULENCIO takes one or two hesitant steps forward and then shrugs off his straitjacket, making it fall to the floor.

HENDRYK and LUAKEL are still nervously pointing the Cattle prods at him.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (slightly drugged voice) 
I be nice.

 WEAPON M 
One way to know for sure.
 (steps back; points BFG at Flocc) 
 (takes a deep breath) 
Justin Pickard!

HENDRYK and LUAKEL practically jump out of their skins but all that comes out of Flocc’s is a very quiet growl. He makes no other moves.

 WEAPON M 
 (nodding head) 
Drug will wear off soon, guys.
 (turns to the Germans) 
He’s all yours.

WEAPON M, LUAKEL and HENDRYK all quickly step out of the transporter room. A second later we hear what sounds like the doors being locked.

There is a short pause.

We then hear the sounds of many heavy objects being dragged on the floor and placed against the doors.

We hear frantic concerned whispers

 LUAKEL 
Will that be enough to hold him back?

 HENDRYK 
Don’t know.

 WEAPON M 
Better pile on more stuff just to be sure.

We again hear the sounds of many heavy objects being dragged on the floor and placed against the doors.

Wipe to:

 EXT. – CARIBBEAN ISLAND – DAY 

Back on the infected world again. TORQUMADA and THANDE are still lying there, unconscious, green virus gas around them as the Stereotypica finally overcomes their vaccines.

 THANDE 
 (blurred murmur) 
Ooh chuff mi Ah feel like Ahm gonna cock mi clogs…

 TORQUMADA 
 (blurred murmur) 
Boy, I say boy, it’s at times like this
I wish I’d paid off mah health insurance…

On the lab bench beside them is THANDE’s spectrometer, and sitting in the slot at the top, jouncing around, is the bubbling green fluid in the test tube.

Overhead, we see BOBO frantically flying about.

 BOBO 
Not. Find.
But. Must. Find.
Save. Torqumada.

 MOSQUITO 
 (VO) 
Say, what are you up to?

BOBO turns in midair to see the MOSQUITO hovering above the lab bench. One of his forelegs is bent around the stem of a huge sunflower. As we watch, he sticks his piercing moutparts into the sunflower and sucks. His compound eyes roll back in ecstacy and he sighs.

 BOBO 
 (frustratedly) 
Torqumada. Hurt.
Must. Help. Torqumada.

 MOSQUITO 
 (sighs) 
Look, I want to help them too,
ol’-flyin’-brain-buddy,
but let’s face it, what do we know
about chemistry and biology?
 (takes another suck of sunflower pollen) 
If they couldn’t do it, what makes you think we can?

 BOBO 
 (stubbornly) 
One. Ingredient. Missing.
Must. Find It.
To. Save. Torqumada.

 MOSQUITO 
 (takes a third, particularly vigorous suck) 
Yeah, but what are the chances of…

Tight on – slow motion – the sunflower in the MOSQUITO’s leg. Slowly, rocking back and forth with a slowed-down sound like that of an avalanche, one yellow petal comes loose.

Then it breaks free. The camera follows it, the background blurring, as it turns over and over in midair, slowly fluttering towards the ground.

And then it falls in the mouth of the test tube.

Pan up – slo-mo shot of the MOSQUITO and BOBO staring in horror as the sunflower petal sinks into the bubbling green liquid.

 BOBO 
 (angrily) 
Fool. Now. Never. Save. Torqumada!

BOBO launches himself at the MOSQUITO and the two collide in midair. The MOSQUITO topples to the ground as BOBO wraps his tentacles around the MOSQUITO’s wings. They roll over and over, hitting each other with legs and tentacles.

 MOSQUITO 
 (angrily) 
Hey, we’d never have done it anyw-
 (he catches sight of something out of the corner of 400,000 of his eyes) 
What the-?!

BOBO looks up and follows the MOSQUITO’s gaze.

The test tube is no longer green and bubbling. Instead, it is GLOWING BLINDING WHITE!

 BOBO 
 (confused) 
Bobo. Not. Understand…

The MOSQUITO takes the opportunity to free himself.

There’s a flash of brilliant white light. The MOSQUITO slaps his legs over his compound eyes and BOBO does the same with his tentacles.

Then, as the light fades…

The test tube is now filled with perfectly colourless, oily fluid.

The spectrometer lets out a triumphant ‘DING!’ sound. The display reads:

 FINAL REAGENT: LINOLEIC ACID
 (ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN SUNFLOWER OIL) 

 CURE COMPLETE 

 MOSQUITO 
 (impressed) 
Blood and nectar! We did it!

 BOBO 
Look.

The liquid POURS ITSELF out of the tube. And as they watch in wonder, it grows up and forms itself into the shape of a translucent, shimmering, hollow human figure, glowing slightly from the inside

 MOSQUITO 
 (trembling) 
Who are you?

 GLOWING FIGURE 
 (deep voice) 
I am…THE CURE.
 (winks) 
Though some call me Thermo.

BOBO and MOSQUITO take a step backward as THERMOPYLAE steps forward and bends over the prone TORQUMADA and THANDE.

 BOBO 
Not. Hurt. Torqumada!

 MOSQUITO 
Shh, I think he’s trying to help.

 THERMOPYLAE 
 (grinning) 
 Trying? Hah!

He stares down at TORQUMADA and THANDE. After a few moments, we realise that he is not, in fact, staring at them, but at the green gas floating around them.

 THERMOPYLAE 
Stereotypes, eh?
 (soft, threatening voice) 
But stereotypes of what?

THERMOPYLAE puts a hand on each of TORQUMADA and THANDE’s foreheads and, as we watch, the fluidic surface of his being flows across them.

 THERMOPYLAE 
Stereotypes of Yorkshire and the American South, hmm?
But wait…

THERMOPYLAE withdraws one hand and snaps his fingers.

 THERMOPYLAE 
No Vikings!
No Kingdom of York!
 No Yorkshire! 

The green gas surrounding THANDE lets out a thin, high shriek, as though it is alive, and combusts, burning away to nothing.

Then THERMO withdraws his other hand and snaps those fingers.

 THERMOPYLAE 
Spanish colonise South Carolina!
No English colonisation of North America!
 No American South! 

Again, the virus burns away with a scream.

THERMOPYLAE takes a step back, smirking to himself and blowing on his fingers as though they’re gun barrels, while the MOSQUITO and BOBO look on in wonder.

THANDE gets up, rubbing his forehead, followed a moment later by TORQUMADA.

 THANDE 
What the hell was that?

 TORQUMADA 
Ugh…my head feels like there’s
been a supporter of gun control
and universal healthcare living inside it…

Both of them stare up at THERMOPYLAE.

 THANDE 
You’re…the cure?

 THERMO 
 (makes to leave) 
That’s right.
And I have work to do.

 TORQUMADA 
Wait!
Can you cure those affected by the virus
on the other worlds?

 THERMO 
 (shaking his head) 
Sorry—this is a well-designed virus.
It’s changed slightly between each use.
You’ll need a different cure per planet.

 THANDE 
But then we’ll have to start all over again!
 And we won’t be resistant ourselves
to each new exposure!

 THERMO 
Well—if you get your hands on the original
design notes for the virus and the core RNA genome,
you might be able to develop a universal cure.
 (grins) 
And now, time to fix this world!

THANDE and TORQUMADA take a step back as THERMO leaps into the air. He grows and grows as he does so, his form spreading out and dissipating, until tiny particles of the Cure are flung outward.

 EXT. – SPACE – ABOVE INFECTED EARTH 

We see the wave of pearly light spreading out across the world, eradicating all the traces of green virus gas.

 EXT. – DESERT ISLAND – DAY 

THANDE and TORQUMADA are still staring upward, mouths agape.

 TORQUMADA 
Wow.
 (turns to THANDE) 
Hey, I thought we hadn’t quite got the Cure yet?

 THANDE 
 (confused) 
Maybe it just took some time to take effect.
 (shrugs) 

In the background, we can see the MOSQUITO and BOBO sniggering to themselves.

THE CURE begins to fall like rain.

 TORQUMADA 
Well, that’s this planet saved.
 (sighs) 
But now it all comes down to finding
the people who did this, and forcing them
to give up the source code.

 THANDE 
Yeah—well, maybe the others will manage it.

 TORQUMADA 
 (doubtfully) 
Maybe.

A long pause, interrupted by:

 ROBERTP6165 
 (VO) 
Hey!! Who tied me up?
 (confused) 
Why am I wearing a Confederate uniform?
 (even more confused) 
And why have I got a third ear growing in
the middle of my forehead?
 (depressed) 
Now I’ll have to suffer those lame ‘Final Front-ear’
jokes for the rest of my life!

THANDE and TORQUMADA look at each other and laugh.

Cut to:

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH 

The Hairplane emerges from a vortex and zooms out into space towards the distant Hollywood Earth.

Some signs of the earlier damage are still there, especially the bald patches where the hair has been burned away, but some damage has been patched over and the ship looks ready to fight.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE – THRONE ROOM 

JUSTIN PICKARD remains seated on his throne, staring avariciously at a screen showing the Earth as the Hairplane approaches it. The screen’s fitting is lost in the vast carpet of hair that surrounds it on all sides, like something alive.

The bald FELLATIO NELSON is standing on the front of PICKARD’s dais, giving orders, while RAN EXILIS sulks at the back.

 FELLATIO NELSON 
Hey, you! E.O.!

 BLACKMAGE/EUIO 
Who?

 FELLATIO NELSON 
 (sighs) 
Yeah, both of you–have you
installed those power upgrades
to the shield systems like I asked you?

 BLACKMAGE/EUIO 
Yes, sir.

 FELLATIO NELSON 
Good.
 (to PICKARD) 
We shall not suffer damage this time, Your Cugliness.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (smiles slightly) 
Indeed.
 (darkens) 
Our holy mission shall not be interrupted a second time!

One of the BALD GOONS, CARL, is working a sensor console. He looks up as it beeps.

 CARL 
Your Villousness!
Two ships are detected in orbit!
 (gulps) 
They match the profiles of the ships
who attacked us at the previous timeline!

The BALD GOONS look worriedly at JUSTIN PICKARD, but he claps his hands lightly, once, and sports a dark grin.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Gooood…
 (fondly, to FELLATIO NELSON) 
Thanks to those upgrades, this
time we shall emerge victorious!

 FELLATIO NELSON 
Yes, sir!

As we watch, FELLATIO NELSON surreptitiously palms his small electronic device again. A red button is flashing slowly. His thumb is poised over it.

RAN EXILIS goes nervously up to JUSTIN PICKARD.

 RAN EXILIS 
Your Hairiness, should not our
first priority be the virus release?

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (glares at him) 
Silence, Hirsuite Prime!
For now at least…
 (shakes his head) 
They interrupted our crusade before!
They must be punished for that!

 RAN EXILIS 
 (hangs head) 
I obey…my lord.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (turns away, shouts orders) 
Shields up! Prepare technobabblyon-particle cannons one and two!
 (leans forward in chair) 
And open a comm channel to them.

 HOBELHOUSE 
 (at the comm station) 
Yes, your Pilosity.

The TV screen shows the AH.com and German ships coming ever closer. Then it switches to a view of the AH.com ship’s bridge.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (loudly) 
Unidentified ship!
This is Captain Jus-Tin Pickard of the Federation stars-
 (shakes himself) 
I have got to stop doing that.
 (loudly) 
Ahem, I mean, I am Captain Justin Pickard of the Hairplane!
You have tried to stand in the way of our holy quest and you
shall be destroyed in a pleasing, post-ironic fashion!

DOCTOR WHAT stands up on the screen.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (hard voice) 
Well—you virus-bombing, studenty-haired,
overly verbose loony—there’s only one response to that.
 (nods) 
Now!

As JUSTIN PICKARD looks confused, we pan down to FELLATIO NELSON. His thumb jabs down on the red button.

RAN EXILIS sees him do it.

 RAN EXILIS 
 (angry) 
You! What are you doin-

As he speaks, suddenly several consoles explode, showering HOBELHOUSE and GENERAL TIU with glass. They scream and fall back, thrashing, before messily bleeding to death. Flames and sparks go everywhere. Clumps of hair on the wall catch fire and JUSTIN PICKARD screams in sympathy.

RAN EXILIS, his face flaming, yanks out a gun.

 RAN EXILIS 
Traitor!
 (to himself) 
I knew I should have settled for that John Reynolds dude!

He fires, sending three balls of green technobabblyon energy across the room. FELLATIO NELSON dives off the dais and they pass over his head, slamming into the hairy walls and setting more hair on fire.

 RAN EXILIS 
I’ll get you, you…

Suddenly SNAKES OF HAIR curl across the floor and walls, wrapping themselves around both RAN EXILIS and FELLATIO NELSON. Both struggle to break free, but fail.

JUSTIN PICKARD, a maddened look in his eyes, stalks across the dais towards them.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (softly, to FELLATIO NELSON) 
You…you betrayed me!
 (and to RAN EXILIS) 
And you recruited him!
You must be another bloody traitor!

RAN EXILIS tries to protest, but the hair is already wrapping around his throat.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (nastily) 
I find your lack of faith in our quest…disturbing.

The hair coils tighten. Both FELLATIO NELSON and RAN EXILIS begin to choke and go blue in the face.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Shift off this mortal coil!
 (smiles to himself) 
Heh. A pun.

FELLATIO NELSON and RAN EXILIS go limp. However, as they do, the HAIRPLANE suddenly shudders and we hear more distant explosions.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (distracted) 
What the-?!

As he turns away, the coils of hair loosen and FELLATIO NELSON and RAN EXILIS fall to the ground. However, neither of them move; they’re either dead or at least deeply unconscious. Both have bluing bruises around their throats.

JUSTIN PICKARD stares at the TV screen, frought with static. It shows the two ships heading towards him.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (barking) 
Status!

 CARL 
 (scanning his console desperately) 
Shields are completely down!

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (softly, still staring at screen) 
No…

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP BRIDGE – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT is still standing up. On the viewscreen we can see a series of small explosions breaking out across the Hairplane.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Status?

 GBW 
 (at sensor console) 

Their shields register as zero.

 KIT 
 (jubilantly) 
He did it!
 (glances down at console) 
Oh…Acting-Kapitan Sinister
wants to know if we’re pressing the attack?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (tugging shirt) 
Damn right!
 (to MATT) 
Target their weapons only—we’re beaming our
people over there, remember.

 MATT 
With pleasure!

MATT works his console, and on the viewscreen, we see AH.com particle beams lancing out and hitting the Hairplane’s weapons arrays. The more nimble German ship flies in an arc around and pummels the same areas with its missiles.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (to KIT) 
Alert the teleporter room. It’s a go.

KIT nods.

 INT. – TELEPORTER ROOM–DAY 

FLOCCULENCIO, STEFFEN and SUSANO are standing on the teleporter pads. G.BONE is now playing Solitaire.

 G.BONE 
 (to himself) 
I can’t remember the rules.
Maybe I’ll just put the cards in random
piles and then declare myself the winner.
 (does so) 
That was oddly satisfying.

The intercom bleeps. G.BONE starts.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (VO) 
Justin’s shields are down! Energise!

At the sound of the name ‘Justin’, FLOCCULENCIO’s right eye suddenly starts twitching violently.

 G.BONE 
Uh, sure.

G.BONE presses random buttons on the console and the commando team vanishes with a pop. He shrugs and goes back to his Solitaire.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE – THRONE ROOM – DAY 

JUSTIN PICKARD looks on, incensed, as the AH.com and German ships fire.

 CARL 
Um, Your Villousness, some strange readings
emanating from the bigger ship-

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (angrily) 
Never mind!
Just power up weapons and shoot back!

EUIO and BLACKMAGE step gingerly over the bodies of GENERAL TIU and HOBELHOUSE, and start working the weapons consoles.

JUSTIN PICKARD settles back in his throne, glaring at the ships.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
They will not win. They can’t win…

 EXT. – SPACE –NEAR EARTH 

We see the AH.com and German ship fire a barrage of weapons fire at the Hairplane. Explosions appear all along the hull of the ship, burning off clumps of hair.

TIGHT ON- HAIRPLANE’S CANNONS

They swivel and fire at point blank range as the two ships swing by.

 EXT. –SPACE- NEAR EARTH 

Two green energy balls slam into the German ship as it swings by. Its shields sparkle and its engines begin to sputter…then stop entirely.

Only momentum carries the German ship forward. The AH.Com ship turns and makes another pass at the Hairplane, as the German ship begins to drift helplessly…

 INT. – MEDICAL BAY – DAY 

We see WEAPON M and LUAKEL (both holding BFG) guarding a morose and bound NEK. The whole ship is shaking as we hear the sounds of distant explosions.

One explosion sounds a lot louder and closer. We hear a few distant screams.

HENDRYK appears in the doorway a minute or so later.

 HENDRYK 
Lee! I need your help!
We just had some plasma conduits blow up!
PSYCHOMELTDOWN is trapped under a big slab of metal
and we need some help getting him out!

 WEAPON M 
Psycho? Meh—that’s a tough break, man, but it’s not
like he’s useful for anything. I’ve got orders to stay here
and watch the prisoner. Get someone else to do it.

 HENDRYK 
IRONYUPPIE is trapped under it as well.

 WEAPON M 
Well, fuck man, why didn’t you say so earlier? Without her, we can’t have any fun watching LANDSHARK get abused!
 (turns to go) 
LUAKEL! Keep an eye on this NEK freak! We’ll be back in just a few minutes!

 LUAKEL 
Will do!

HENDRYK and WEAPON M run out, leaving LUAKEL behind.

NEK glances up, a brief smile on his face, before glancing down again.

 INT. – AH. COM BRIDGE – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT is in the command chair. LANDSHARK (still in his WW1 Reichswehr uniform) and MATT are at helm and weapons. GBW and KIT are at other stations.

The viewscreen shows multiple explosions appearing on the hull of the Hairplane.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
What’s happening to the German ship?

 MATT 
Their systems are totally kaput, but zey should be
up to full power in less than eine minute!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (giving MATT a funny look for a brief second) 
Sharky—keep us between the Hairplane and the Germans!
We gotta give them time to get their power back up!

 LANDSHARK 
Ja mein Kapitan! I vill show them that I am der uber-pilot!

 MATT 
And I will show them schwein-asshats not to mess vith us!

DOCTOR WHAT looks at LANDSHARK and MATT in utter confusion for a moment before shrugging his shoulders.

 EXT. – SPACE – DAY 

The ah.com ship and the Hairplane fly at each other, massive amounts of weaponsfire blasting at each other, The Hairplane’s energy balls slam again and again into the AH.com ship, causing its shields to sparkle and sputter and its power system to fluctuate. Multiple small explosions can be seen along the hulls of both ships. The Hairplane desperately attempts to dodge out of the way of the AH.com ship but the AH.com ship manages to match the more nimble Hairplane time and again.

The German ship can be seen in the background, still drifting.

 INT. – GERMAN SHIP BRIDGE – DAY 

The bridge is a mess, with numerous consoles damaged, and smoke everywhere. Acting Captain MAX SINISTER is in the command chair.

 MAX SINISTER 
Status! Vhere der hell iz mein weapons?!

We see a figure with his head buried in one of the consoles frantically making some kind of repairs. With a triumphal shout, he sticks his head out and faces MAX SINISTER.

It’s MICHAEL.

 MICHAEL 
 (grinning) 
Mein Kaptain! Ich bin ein Genie! Der System iz repaired und should be at zer full power einen ten seconds!
 (lights up a cigar) 

 MAX SINISTER 
Mein Gott! Das iz amazing!
 (to CARLTON BACH) 
All weapons! Fire on that schwein!

 EXT. – GERMAN SHIP – DAY 

The German ship – now almost fully powered up – starts to move towards the battle between the ah.com and the Hairplane.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

STEFFEN, SUSANO and FLOCCULENCIO are walking down a hair covered corridor.

The entire right side of FLOCCULENCIO’s face is twitching spastically. Every now and then, a low growl comes from him.

The whole ship shudders every few seconds as we hear the sounds of distant explosions.

 STEFFEN 
 (looking at a scanner) 
I am having trouble detecting ze schwein on zis ship!

 SUSANO 
Ve must find ze information on ze virus!

 STEFFEN 
 (dangerous glint in his eyes) 
Ja! But once ve haff zat information…

The three turn a corner to find themselves in an unoccupied computer room. The two Germans glance at one another and smile. SUSANO sits in front of one of the computer consoles and starts tapping in a few commands. He lets out a shout a few seconds later.

 SUSANO 
Kaptain! I’ve accessed ze main medical databanks!
I haff access to ze schematics of ze virus!
Its RNA structure, ze original design notes, ze timelines they’ve attacked,
different types of vaccines they haff—everything!

 STEFFEN 
Ve must give zis information to our ships!
 (pulls out a communicator) 
Zis iz Kapitan STEFFEN to –

 INT. – AH.COM MED BAY –DAY 

We see LUAKEL standing guard over NEK. Another explosion rattles the ah.com ship, causing the whole ship to shake violently, causing LUAKEL to stumble for a second or two.

NEK takes advantage of the distraction and, with an insane yell, suddenly rips through his bonds and leaps out of the chair and jumps at LUAKEL!

LUAKEL and NEK go down, screaming and clawing at each other. LUAKEL pushes NEK off and valiantly throws a few punches at him but NEK manages to somehow dodge out of the way of the punches before they connect. It’s as though he can predict LUAKEL’s every move.

 LUAKEL 
 (throwing another punch and seeing NEK dodge once again out of the way) 
How the hell are you doing that?!

 NEK 
 (grinning maniacally) 
Nighty-night!

NEK throws a punch at LUAKEL that hits him square in the face. LUAKEL falls onto his back, unconscious.

 NEK 
Must find Master….must return to him….

 

 

 

 END ACT I 

 

 

 ACT II 

 

 

 
 

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CORRIDOR – DAY 

NEK rushes out the door and into the corridor. He looks frantically around for a few seconds and then rushes down a corridor.

CUT TO-

We see NEK running down a smoke filled corridor dimly lit with emergency lighting. He suddenly stops, does a double take and runs back the direction he just came from and stops in front of a door. The door reads –

 EMERGENCY ESCAPE POD 

SEATS FOUR COMFORTABLY

SEATS SIX UNCOMFORTABLY

CAN SEAT TEN … BUT ONLY IF THEY
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER

NEK grins and opens the door.

 INT. – AH. COM BRIDGE – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT is standing up near the weapons/navigation consoles.

The ship is shaking as the battle intensifies. The viewscreen shows the Hairplane, its hull damaged in a dozen places, still blasting relentlessly away at the ah.com ship. A particularly powerful explosion rocks the ship and everyone clutches onto something to keep from falling.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
LEO! Status!

 LEO 
Shields at 21%!
 (beat) 
At current rates, shields will collapse within two minutes!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Then we gotta knock out these bastards fast, don’t we!
Keep firing, Matt!

 MATT 
Jawohl mein Kapitan!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (too distracted to notice MATT) 
Sharky—what’s the status on the Daring Commando Team™-

The intercom suddenly crackles with static and then—

 STEFFEN 
Zis iz Kapitan STEFFEN to zer AH.kom ship!
Ve haff found ze information on ze virus!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (smiling) 
Alright! Captain—use the comm. to record all the
information and then transmit it to us! We’ll teleport
you guys out of there the first chance we get!

 STEFFEN 
 (VO) 
Ja! Ve vill be transmitting in just eine minute!
STEFFEN out!

Radio turns off.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (looks up at LEO’s ‘eye’) 
LEO! Record that information immediately!

 LEO 
Immediately? But my archive systems
are still damaged from the first battle.
 (beat) 
I’ll have to overwrite the data on my backup navicomp system…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Just do it! We may not be able to teleport them out of there
for a few more minutes and I don’t want to miss this chance!

 LEO 
Very well.
 (beat) 
Hey—somebody just launched one of our escape pods…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Wha-? …

 EXT. – SPACE – DAY 

We see the Hairplane and the AH.com ship exchanging massive amounts of weapons fire. The entire region of space here is practically glowing from all the explosions.

PULL OUT-

The German ship—now fully powered up—flying into the battlezone, its weapons lancing out and striking the Hairplane as well.

PULL OUT SOME MORE –

A small escape pod flying down towards the Earth, its trajectory putting it somewhere over the United States.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

We see SUSANO holding a comm. in his hand. It makes an acknowledging beep.

 SUSANO 
Download complete, Kapitan!

 STEFFEN 
Transmit information to zer ah.com ship!

 SUSANO 
Ja!

SUSANO presses a few buttons on the comm.

TIGHT ON – COMM
“ Transmitting file – 1% complete ”. A few seconds later we see the “ 1% ” change to “ 2% ”.

 SUSANO 
Zer file is being transmitted!
File transfer should only take only a few minutes!

An explosion rocks the ship.

 STEFFEN 
Let’s get ze fuck out of here!

 SUSANO 
Ja!

The three of them turn to leave—only to see CARL and REDEM at the doorway, weapons drawn.

 CARL 
Oh no—you’re not going anywhere!

 REDEM 
Drop your weapons!

SUSANO and STEFFEN glance at one another, look at FLOCCULENCIO, smile and nod.

 SUSANO 
 (raising hands) 
Sure thing—but just answer eine question.

 STEFFEN 
 (raising hands) 
Ja! Who iz your boss?

 REDEM 
The great one himself—JUSTIN PICKARD.

At the sound of Justin’s name, FLOCCULENCIO’s eyes snap open and he shakes his head violently. Seemingly coming out of a deep sleep, he blinks and looks around for the source of the name.

His red-rimmed eyes fixate on REDEM and CARL.

STEFFEN and SUSANO throw themselves to the ground as FLOCCULENCIO, screaming incoherently, charges at REDEM and CARL. Neither one of them even has a chance to react before FLOCCULENCIO tackles them and beats them into unconsciousness.

FLOCCULENCIO looks around, seemingly realizing for the first time where he is.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Must…destroy…the…Great…Satan…

 STEFFEN 
Ja!

STEFFEN looks down at the comm.

TIGHT ON: COMM
“ Transmitting file – 15% complete ”.

The three leave the room.

CUT TO –

 INT. – HAIRPLANE CORRIDOR – DAY 

FLOCCULENCIO, STEFFEN and SUSANO are running down a corridor. FLOCCULENCIO is staring at the ship with an expression of vague interest.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Hmmm- weird looking ship.

 VOICE 
 (VO) 
It’s not JUST a ship- it’s a Plane of Awesomeness!

FLOCCULENCIO, STEFFEN and SUSANO turn around in shock.

JUSTIN PICKARD is standing in the corridor, a look of pure fury in his eyes.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
No! It’s a Plane of Evil!
 (snarling) 
I curse your pallid visage, Pickard!

The three bring up their weapons but JUSTIN PICKARD waves his hands in a Jedi-like manner.

Long tentacles of hair erupt from the floor, the walls and even the ceiling and wrap themselves around the limbs of the three, trussing them up near the ceiling. Their weapons are yanked from their arms by yet more tentacles of hair. With a twist, the weapons are snapped in half and the pieces casually thrown away. STEFFEN drops his comm. and it falls onto the hair covered floor.

TIGHT ON: COMM
“ Transmitting file – 35% complete ”.

TIGHT ON: JUSTIN PICKARD’s EYES
A look of confusion—turned quickly into pure hatred.

CUT TO:

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
You DARE to defy me?!
 (snarls) 
Enough of this foolishness!

A large tendril of hair comes out of the wall and forms itself into a mace-like object and hovers over the comm.

TIGHT ON: COMM
“ Transmitting file – 40% complete ”.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (smiling evilly at STEFFEN) 
Watch as your hopes die!

With a scream of pure fury, STEFFEN, with near-superhuman strength, rips his arms free of the tendrils of hair binding him and he falls to the ground.

JUSTIN PICKARD looks up, a brief glimpse of confusion and hesitation on his face.

STEFFEN gets up and, still screaming in fury, charges at JUSTIN and tackles him, knocking him to the ground.

With JUSTIN distracted, the Hair-Mace collapses into a simple clump of hair. The tendrils of hair holding SUSANO and FLOCCULENCIO loosen ever so slightly. Both start screaming and yanking at their bounds as well.

TIGHT ON: COMM- “ Transmitting file – 50% complete ”.

STEFFEN is savagely pummeling JUSTIN with several punches to the face. Just as it appears that JUSTIN is on the verge of unconsciousness-

-SNAKES OF HAIR erupt from a wall, wrapping themselves around STEFFEN’s throat. STEFFEN begins to choke and go blue in the face as JUSTIN begins to slowly stand up.
SUSANO and FLOCCULENCIO, with a final scream, tear loose from their bounds, and fall to the ground. Behind them, unseen by them, a large clump of hair in the shape of a giant fist begins to form.

TIGHT ON: COMM- “ Transmitting file – 65% complete ”.

STEFFEN lashes out with a kick in sheer desperation—which connects to JUSTIN’s groin. JUSTIN screams.

The giant hair fist falls apart into clumps of loose hair strands.

SUSANO and FLOCCULENCIO stand up and charge at JUSTIN.

With a maddened look in his eyes, JUSTIN throws STEFFEN against a bulkhead using the tendril of hair and turns to face SUSANO and FLOCCULENCIO.

A large tentacle of hair, two feet wide, lashes out from a wall and knocks SUSANO and FLOCCULENCIO off their feet and throws them backwards. They slide twenty feet along the floor on their backs before coming to a stop, gasping for breath.

JUSTIN walks forward a few feet, pure insanity in his eyes. More tendrils of hair come out of the walls and wrap themselves around the chests of SUSANO and FLOCCULENCIO and pull them closer to their respective walls.

SUSANO is now firmly stuck to the right hand side of the corridor wall, while FLOCCULENCIO is firmly stuck to the left hand side of the corridor wall.

JUSTIN turns to look at the comm., still on the floor.

TIGHT ON: COMM- “ Transmitting file – 99% complete ”.

There is a loud BEEP

It changes to: “ 100% complete –file successfully transmitted ”

TIGHT ON: JUSTIN face looking on in anger

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

JUSTIN’s screams seem to make every clump of hair shake—and loosen. SUSANO and FLOCCULENCIO fall to the ground, stunned and injured and still slumped against the walls.

FLOCCULENCIO’s bottle of S (a) tanic Appletini falls out of his pocket and onto the ground. He looks at it in surprise and glances at all the hair around him—-and smiles. He pulls out his cigarette case and reaches down to pick the bottle just as JUSTIN turns around.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (screaming) 
I’ll kill you with my bare hands, Heretic!

With a smile, FLOCCULENCIO opens the cigarette case—and gasps as he pulls out, not a lighter, but a piece of paper instead.

CLOSE-UP – PIECE OF PAPER

“IOU one lighter”
 -signed MICHAEL 

 FLOCCULENCIO 
That Aussie bastard!

 SUSANO 
 (VO) 
Heads up!

FLOCCULENCIO raises his head to see SUSANO holding a large silver plated cigarette lighter. He throws it at FLOCCULENCIO –just as JUSTIN begins to run toward the two of them.

TIGHT ON:
Cigarette lighter tumbling end over end in slow motion through the air.

JUSTIN’s hands reaching out towards FLOCCULENCIO.

The cigarette lighter landing into FLOCCULENCIO’s outstretched hand.

With a flick of the lighter, the bottle of S (a) tanic Appletini bursts into flames and FLOCCULENCIO throws it right into JUSTIN PICKARD’s face.

With an awe inspiring ‘FWOOSH’ sound, JUSTIN PICKARD’s hair covered body bursts into flames!

The hair covered corridor begins to smolder—and then it too bursts into flames! Seconds later, large sections of the walls and ceiling begin to smolder.

JUSTIN collapses to the floor, burning. A moment later the entire floor collapses, sending JUSTIN’s burning body crashing into the room below…

 INT. – HAIRPLANE THRONEROOM – DAY 

EUIO and BLACKMAGE are still at the weapons and navigation consoles. The static filled viewscreen shows the AH.com ship and German ship pounding away mercilessly at the Hairplane.

We see the unmoving bodies of FELLATIO NELSON and RAN EXILIS lying near the throne near the rear of Throne Room.

 EUIO 
 (glancing up in surprise) 
Hey—you smell something burning?

 BLACKMAGE 
 (glancing up) 
Yeah—weird smell—like…burning hair?
And what’s that strange crashing sound….?

JUSTIN’s burning body, followed by a large chunk of the floor from above, falls through the ceiling and crashes onto the two of them, crushing both them and their consoles.

Through the viewscreen, we see the Hairplane suddenly shudder and start spinning out of control…

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CONTROL ROOM – DAY 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Wha—?
 (beat) 
What the hell you mean an emergency
escape pod has been launched?
Who’s in it?

 LEO 
I am detecting one life sign in the pod—
belonging to the prisoner identified as NEK.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (hitting button on command chair) 
G.BONE! I need you to do an emergency teleport of that escape pod pronto!

 INT. – TELEPORTER ROOM – DAY 

We see G.BONE staring in a book titled ‘Where’s Waldo?’.

CAMERA SWINGS— to show the page he’s looking at.

The page is completely blank—except for a single figure of a man wearing a red and white striped shirt in the exact center of the page.

 G.BONE 
 (to himself) 
Hmmmm…this is a tough one…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (VO) 
G.Bone!
I need you to do an emergency teleport
of that escape pod pronto!

G.BONE glances up in confusion for a second and hits a button on the console.

 G.BONE 
No can do, Doc!
We had a whole bunch of conduits blow up!
The range of the teleporter is -

 INT. – AH.COM CONTROL ROOM – DAY 

 G.BONE 
 (VO) 
—barely 30% of normal. Sorry Doc!
You have to get us closer if you want me to do it.
And I can’t do it anyway unless you drop the shields.

 DOCTOR WHAT

 MATT 
Nein! That schweinhund still shooting is

 LANDSHARK 
Pull away?
 (incredulously) 
At ze moment uff eine glorious triumph to go capture an annoying und useless teenager? Vith der German ship finally doing zer useful thing? NEIN!

DOCTOR WHAT swears under his breath.

 LEO 
Ah—the Daring Commando Team™ are
transmitting information on the virus.
 (beat) 
Excellent-it’s already at 10% complete.
 (beat) 
Hmmmm…useful information…
 (beat) 
Very useful information indeed…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Useful enough to make a cure?

 LEO 
Information is still being transmitted at the moment
but if the information they send us is as detailed as I
think it is, then yes—a cure can be created.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
By anybody?

 LEO 
Yes.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Really anybody?

 LEO 
Yes.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Really, really anybody?

 LEO 
Yes.

There is a long pause.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Really, really, really anybody?

 LEO 
 (exasperated tone of voice) 
Yes—even a brain-dead chimpanzee will be able
to make a universal cure for the virus
with the information that’s being transmitted.

There is a very long pause.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Partially brain-dead or totally brain-dead chimpanzee?

 LEO 
Totally brain-dead.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grinning) 
Huzzah! There’s hope for us yet!

The entire crew cheer and high-five one another.

 LEO 
 (muttering under his breath) 
Damn fleshbags.
 (beat) 
File has been successfully received.
Overwriting navicomp data…

The ship rocks for a few seconds as several distant explosions can be heard.

DOCTOR WHAT hops back into his command chair.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Status on the Hairplane!

 LEO 
The Hairplane has suffered major damage but is still continuing the fight.
 (beat) 
The Hairplane is outside teleporter range.
We are unable to teleport the commando team out at the moment.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
MATT! Keep firing at those weapon systems!
We gotta knock them out so we can get our team out!

 MATT 
Ja! Eat ze particle beams, schweinen!

The viewscreen shows several explosions appear on the hull of the Hairplane.

Suddenly, the Hairplane flies out of control and shoots past the ah.com ship, twisting and tumbling.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
What the fuck? Leo—what happened?

 LEO 
The Hairplane has suffered a catastrophic loss of both helm and weapons systems.
 (beat) 
Oh dear—it appears to be flying straight towards the Earth.

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH 

We see the Hairplane fly at tremendous speed towards the Earth. As we watch, it begins to hit the outer atmosphere of the planet and have its hull slowly start heating up as its trajectory takes it over the United States.

 INT. – AH.COM BRIDGE –DAY 

The bridge crew watch in horror as the Hairplane heads towards the Earth.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Leo! Are we in range for the teleporters?

 LEO 
Negative.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grim look) 
Power dive! Get us after that ship!

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH 

We see the AH.Com ship fly straight towards the Earth. Its hull starts to heat up as it plunges into the atmosphere after the Hairplane.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE –DAY 

The entire corridor is filled with smoke and there is a rather large hole in the center of it. Flames and electrical sparks can dimly be seen emanating from the hole.

SUSANO and FLOCCULENCIO stand up.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (staring down at hole) 
Huzzah! The Vile one is gone! That was great work, STEFFEN!
 (beat) 
STEFFEN?

FLOCCULENCIO looks over to see SUSANO looking at STEFFEN’s prone body. SUSANO turns to FLOCCULENCIO, looking pale.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Is he…is he…?

SUSANO just shakes his head.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (quiet voice) 
Damn…

The Hairplane begins to shake violently.

 SUSANO 
I fear ve vill be joining him soon….

 FLOCCULENCIO 
No way! Those guys have a teleporter!
All we have to do is contact them on the comm. and they’ll
be able to lock in on us and get us out of here!

 SUSANO 
Der comm? Zat vould be der device zat fell into zer hole vith Pickard, ja?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Oh shit…..

 SUSANO 
 (slinging STEFFEN’s body over his shoulder) 
VE must find a way off zer ship!

They run down a corridor while the shaking gets worse.

 EXT. – EARTH ATMOSPHERE – DAY 

The Hairplane is plunging through the atmosphere, friction completely burning away what few clumps of hair had remained on the hull of the ship. A massive fireball is forming around the ship as it continues its descent.

Its trajectory is taking it towards the Midwestern part of the United States.

A few seconds later, trailing a massive fireball of its own, is the AH.com ship flying after the Hairplane.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP CONTROL ROOM – DAY 

The entire ship is shaking violently. The viewscreen shows nearly a solid wall of flames surrounding the ah.com ship.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Time to impact!

 LEO 
100 seconds!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Time till teleporter range!

 LEO 
90 seconds!
 (beat) 
Doc—at this speed we might not be able to pull out of the dive in time!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Then we better catch up to them sooner! Faster!
 (hitting a button on chair) 
G.Bone! We’re going to be cutting this very close!
Get ready to beam them out!

 G.BONE 
 (VO) 
I’m detecting multiple human signs but I can’t get a lock on their specific signs!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Then just beam every human off that ship—we’ll sort them out later!

 EXT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

The Hairplane is flying low over a heavily forested landscape, its engines on fire and the plane itself listing to one side, totally out of control. It leaves a trail of black smoke behind it, partly from the remaining clumps of hair burning.

It is heading straight towards a group of large hills in the distance.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE- DAY 

We see SUSANO (still carrying STEFFEN’s body over his shoulder) and FLOCCULENCIO running through a corridor. They come to a stop at a dead-end.

 SUSANO 
Gott im Himmel!
Vat kind uff dumbkoft doesn’t built ze ezcape pods in zer ship!
Ve Germans vould haff built a dozen escape pods for zis ship!

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (faraway look in his eyes) 
So—as it was prophesized…the Two will meet—Prophet and Heretic-
and destroy each other and a New Age of the Goatist will emerge…

FLOCCULENCIO shakes his head.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (a bit sadly) 
Oh—to be a simple Singaporean Man of Leisure once again…

 INT. – AH.COM CONTROL ROOM – DAY 

The viewscreen shows the ship to be VERY close to the surface of the ground.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
G.Bone!!!

 G.BONE 
 (VO) 
Teleporting—-now!

 INT. – HAIRPLANE- DAY 

We see SUSANO and FLOCCULENCIO disappear with a loud ‘pop’.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE THRONE ROOM – DAY 

We see the still-unconscious RAN EXILIS and FELLATIO NELSON disappear with a loud ‘pop’.

 INT. – AH.COM CONTROL ROOM – DAY 

 G.BONE 
 (VO) 
Got them all!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Sharky—full speed ascent!

 LANDSHARK 
Jawohl!

The entire ship—with an incredible groaning sound of protesting metal– suddenly tilts upwards. Most of the bridge crew are knocked back into their seats.

The viewscreen shows clouds streaking past the ship. Dimly visible ahead of them is the black trail of smoke with the Hairplane at the head, but it slides towards the bottom of the screen and vanishes as LANDSHARK struggles to pull up.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE THRONE ROOM- DAY 

We see the debris from the collapsed ceiling in a pile. Suddenly, a few pieces shift and tumble away from the pile.

Emerging from the pile of debris is—

JUSTIN PICKARD.

He is horribly burnt and severely injured. He slowly stands up, swaying unsteadily. He looks around.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
I…live!

He glances up at the static-filled view-screen. It shows a large and very familiar looking mountain directly in front of the Hairplane.

MOUNT RUSHMORE!

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (incongruously cheerful) 
Ah—post-modern irony….

 EXT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

We see the Hairplane slam at high speed directly into Mount Rushmore.

PULL OUT-

We see a massive explosion appear on the horizon.

PULL OUT MORE-

We see an escape pod lying on the banks of a small river. NEK is standing next to it. He glances up to see the explosion appear on the horizon.

 NEK 
 (shocked voice) 
Master?

NEK collapses to his knees in tears.

 EXT. – EARTH ORBIT – DAY 

We see the AH.com ship come streaking out of the atmosphere at high speed. After a few seconds, it slows down and enters into orbit around the Earth. A few moments later, the German ship comes into view.

 INT. – AH.COM CONTROL ROOM – DAY 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
G.BONE! Report!

 G.BONE 
We’ve got the whole team. They look pretty beat up.
 (beat) 
And Captain Steffen didn’t make it.

Reactions, as everyone looks around the room.

 G.BONE 
We have his body here…I…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (licking his lips) 
Beam…beam it to the cargo bay…
when you’ve got a moment, G.Bone…
and we’ll send it to the Germans later…

 G.BONE 
 (solemn for once) 
Yessir.
 (beat) 
Plus we’ve got a few unconscious prisoners.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Is Pickard with them?

 G.BONE 
Nope. Guess he was still on the ship.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nodding head) 
Good riddance, as far as I’m concerned.
 (breathes out a sigh of relief) 
 (smiles) 
Great job everyone! Well done!
That was fucking amazing piloting skills there Landshark!

 LANDSHARK 
Ja! Ich bin ein Ubermensch!

DOCTOR WHAT looks at LANDSHARK with a utterly confused expression and then shakes his head.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (muttering to himself) 
Always knew Erikka’s activities would destroy
what few brain cells he had sooner or later.
 (beat; normal voice) 
Ok people—we’ve got work to do!
We have people hurt, prisoners to tie up, a ship to fix…

 INT. – TELEPORTER ROOM – DAY 

G.BONE is staring at STEFFEN’s body.

 G.BONE 
He’s really …?

 SUSANO 
 (sadly) 
Ja.
 (beat) 
But his sacrifice vas not in vain—
ve got der cure und ve destroyed the ship
und ve even captured zum prisoners because uff him!

 FLOCCULENCIO 
I’ll drink to that!

FLOCCULENCIO pulls out his bottle of S (a) tanic Appletini and takes a generous gulp.

 SUSANO 
 (staring at FLOCCULENCIO in confusion) 
Did you not use zat bottle as ein Molotov cocktail?
How iz it still in your possession?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (shrugging shoulders) 
Beats me—guess two wrongs make a right!

 G.BONE 
 (confused look) 
One thing I’m unclear on.
I’m pretty sure that I detected three life signs in the
bridge of the Hairplane just before it crashed.
But only two appeared here.
I specifically ordered the computer to beam
over all humans onto the ship.
So why wasn’t he beamed over?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Guess it’s true—he really wasn’t human!

FLOCC turns, smiles and walks out the room, drinking his appletini. On his way out, he passes KIT coming in.

 KIT 
 (seeing the prone bald FELLATIO NELSON) 
Agh! Are you all right, Fell?

KIT pulls out a medical kit and quickly revives the two bald unconscious figures, RAN EXILIS and FELLATIO NELSON.

 RAN EXILIS 
 (confused) 
Where…where am I…what happened…?

 SUSANO 
 (angrily) 
You vill kommen viz me!

SUSANO grabs the dazed RAN EXILIS and frogmarches him out of the room.

 SUSANO 
 (in a distant, echoing murmur) 
I vill teach you treacherous Nederlansch
scum not to take part in zer glorious
Grossdeutschen unification…

As the sound fades, KIT cradles the still dazed FELLATIO NELSON’s head in his lap. G.BONE, diplomatically, teleports STEFFEN’s body to the cargo bay and then walks out himself, leaving them alone.

 KIT 
 (in soft tones) 
Don’t worry, you’ll be alright, Fell,
as soon as I revive you with some of my
 (smiles to himself) 
Special medicine.

FELLATIO NELSON watches him with only half-focused eyes as KIT stands facing him, away from our POV, and we hear a distinct ‘ZIP!’ sound.

 EXT. – CORRIDOR OUTSIDE TELEPORTER ROOM – DAY 

Sound effects: crashes, bangs, metallic clangs.

 FELLATIO NELSON 
 (VO) 
AAAARGHPLEASENONONONONO-URGH!

As we watch, a figure walks up to the teleporter room door and goes in.

 INT. – TELEPORTER ROOM – DAY 

KIT is looking hurt and smoking a cigarette while FELLATIO NELSON hugs his legs to his chest and shakes back and forth, looking psychologically traumatised.

 KIT 
 (tuts) 
I knew you went through a lot on that ship, Fell,
but that’s really no excuse for…

KIT trails off as the doors open and he looks up at the new figure.

 KIT 
 (unbelieving) 
Wha…?!

FELLATIO NELSON – another FELLATIO NELSON, this one with a full head of hair and wearing his uniform seen before – swaggers into the room.

 KIT 
But…?!

 FELLATIO NELSON 
 (smiles) 
Ah. I comprehend your confusion, my
column of Celtic cugliness.
 (nods at the shaking, bald FELLATIO NELSON) 
The man who helped you here was not
myself, as it happens, but my twin brother.
As he had already lost his hair in a bizarre
paprika accident, I thought him perfect for the role.
 (beat) 
In other words, he was a Bald Imposter.

 KIT 
But…you mean…?

 FELLATIO NELSON 
Ah yes, as it happens, he does not…share our views.

 KIT 
 (pouting) 
But that means I wasted myself on him!

 THE BALD IMPOSTER 
 (quietly) 
Get me out…get me out of here…
please let me go back to the nice
hairy psychopath who only wants
to crush the life out of me…

 FELLATIO NELSON 
 (with a grin) 
Well, as it happens, I’m feeling a little faint myself…

 KIT 
 (grinning) 
Well, in that case, your friend Baldie
can just remain in the role of…a spectator.

Tight on – THE BALD IMPOSTER’s face as he weakly pulls a Viking helmet out of his pocket and, as we hear two ‘ZIP!’ noises in quick succession, uses the points of the horns to stab himself in the eyes, fork-style.

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH – DAY 

With the Hollywood Earth rotating slowly below, looking green, blue and pleasant, the AH.com and German ships drift through space. Both ships have damage scoring down their sides.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CONTROL ROOM – DAY 

Clearly some time has passed; a serene-looking FLOCCULENCIO is back at the sensor station, for instance. DOCTOR WHAT is pacing back and forth.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (addressing the ceiling) 
So, the drive’s repaired, then?

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (VO) 
That’s right, Doc—fortunately the
Blue Schvädeschüz armour meant
we didn’t take much permanent damage.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Good. By the way-what’s the status on that escape pod that was launched earlier?

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (VO) 
We found the pod about 50 miles from the impact area
and Lee tracked some footprints to a nearby cave,
but he lost the trail after that point.
He figures that Nek collapsed the entrance behind him,
trapping himself in the cave forever.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nodding head) 
Good—one less freak we have to worry about.
 (beat) 
Now all we need to do is tie up some loose ends…

 EXT. – LOS ANGELES – DAY 

Most of the AH.commers and Germans, along with Professor ZOOMAR and many other inhabitants of this Earth, all stand solemnly as an organ plays deep, melancholy music.

In the background, we can see what remains of the Hollywood sign after the ravages of the past: several letters have been knocked out so it now just reads LLYW.

 KIT 
 (looking up) 
Hmm, I’ve been there…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (elbowing him) 
Shhh!

DOCTOR WHAT watches as four pall bearers – two planetary natives, FLOCCULENCIO, and SUSANO – carry forward a coffin with the German flag draped over the top, and lower it into the ground.

DOCTOR WHAT nudges MAX SINISTER, standing next to him.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (hisses) 
Why aren’t you taking him back to Deutscherwelt?

 MAX SINISTER 
 (shaking his head) 
He alvays vanted to be buried
on zer planet vhere ve finally
brought zer virus’ reign of terror to an End.

DOCTOR WHAT nods in understanding as the Germans all take a step forward and salute their fallen captain, then begin spading earth back into the pit. FLOCCULENCIO, a thoughtful expression on his face, helps them.

 EXT. – SPACE – DAY 

We see two shuttles going to the AH.com and German ships.

 INT. – GERMAN SHIP – BRIDGE 

SUSANO, along with some of the other Germans, steps back onto the bridge and they resume their positions. The bridge is still battle-scarred but MICHAEL and CARLTON BACH are repairing it again.

 SUSANO 
Hail zer AH.kom ship.

 OBDERDADA 
Jawohl…

DOCTOR WHAT appears on the screen.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nodding) 
We’re leaving for the world where
we left my ship’s doctor and chemist.
 (beat) 
Leo says they should be able to mix up
those vaccines that Captain Steffen got
from the Hairplane’s computer.

 SUSANO 
He did not die in vain.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
No, indeed.
 (coughs) 
So, if you would accompany us through
this vortex, and then we can send Mr Alayta back to the…
 (pause) 
By the way, what is the name of your ship?

 SUSANO 
 (smiling) 
It vas simply called Zer “Me-2358114/X5”.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Catchy.

 SUSANO 
But…I zink from zis day forth it shall haff ein new Name.
 (pause) 
Zer “Kapitan Steffen”.

DOCTOR WHAT nods.

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH – DAY 

The two ships emerge from a vortex above a different Earth, with the Caribbean visible below.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CONTROL ROOM 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
OK, get me Thande and Torq,
let’s see what they’re up to…

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Actually—they’re already hailing us…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (shrugs) 
Okay…

On the screen, the interior of a shuttle cockpit appears. A rattled-looking THANDE and TORQUMADA are in the front seats and the MOSQUITO and BOBO are in the back, obviously trying not to laugh.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
What are you doing?

 THANDE 
Um, waiting for you…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
But what about this planet?

 TORQUMADA 
 (coughs) 
Umm, we, er, managed to make up a cure…

The MOSQUITO and BOBO both let out loud snorts.

 THANDE 
…only suitable for the specific strain
of virus on this world, though.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (smiles) 
Well, come on back, and we’ll
see about you making up some
of the general cures and vaccines we’ve found.

 TORQUMADA 
Will do.

 THANDE 
By the way, we found out that the
Germans might spread the virus to
you if you spent any prolonged time
in contact with them…

DOCTOR WHAT opens his mouth to reply, but both LANDSHARK and MATT stand up indignantly. Both are now wearing WW1 Reichswehr uniforms and are sporting Kaiser Bill moustaches.

 MATT 
 (angry) 
Scheisse! Mein Kapitan, vhere is zer evidence fur zis?

 LANDSHARK 
 (nodding) 
Ja! Und as if ve vould spend Time in kontakt
viz zer verdammt Krauts in any Case!

DOCTOR WHAT opens and closes his mouth a few times, then diplomatically turns and leaves the bridge.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – MEDICAL BAY/LABORATORY 

The Germans and AH.commers all wait around impatiently, while THANDE and TORQUMADA rush around from one area of the lab to the other, mixing things, distilling things, adding things to other things and generally making a mess. BOBO floats past with a test tube rack balanced on top of his cerebral cortex, and THANDE whips out all eight test tubes in quick succession and, as though playing darts, sloshes them with pinpoint accuracy into different flasks. Meanwhile, TORQUMADA grabs the MOSQUITO around the neck and, squeezing his head, uses his piercing mouthparts as a giant pipette to move some liquid from one flask to another. The MOSQUITO’s compound eyes bulge.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
How long is this going to take?

 LEO CAESIUS 
 (VO) 
The recipe is relatively simple
 (beat) 
Damned fleshbags…

 GBW 
 (puzzled) 
How did you manage to store all the data,
Leo? I thought you said before that your
main computer archives had been damaged…?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Well, as I keep trying to tell the captain, I had to-

 THANDE 
 (interrupting) 
Ah!

He raises a single test tube in which is a glowing, almost colourless fluid.

 TORQUMADA 
 (nodding) 
Done!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Great!

 SUSANO 
Zere vere many possible cures,
vhich von is zis?

THANDE nods at the sullen-looking bald RAN EXILIS in the corner, tied up.

 THANDE 
The one which Pickard used to
vaccinate all his own men against the virus.

 SUSANO 
 (doubtful) 
So you mean zat he does not haff zer Stereotypica virus?

Everyone turns to look at RAN EXILIS, who’s muttering to himself.

 RAN EXILIS 
Get even…wait till I have shome legal cannabis
and then marry my disabled lesbian shister
while eating a ham toashtie and playing shome
crazhy funky rock and roll…

 TORQUMADA 
No-o, apparently he’s just like that anyway.

Everyone shrugs.

 THANDE 
And now…
 (dramatically) 
The cure!

THANDE throws the test tube in the air and the colourless liquid turns into a gas, spreading throughout the room. All the Germans, along with MICHAEL, DMA, MATT and LANDSHARK, collapse as the cure runs through them.

Everyone watches anxiously as LANDSHARK slowly gets up.

 LANDSHARK 
What the bloody hell are you lot
all looking at?
 (looks down at uniform) 
Ugh! Why am I wearing such a
monochromatic and poorly coordinated
and, more to the point, continental, outfit?

LANDSHARK rips the uniform off in several savage moves. Everyone except IRONYUPPIE averts their eyes.

 DIAMOND 
 (quickly puts on Stevie Wonder sunglasses) 
I admit that I normally persuade you lot that
not wearing pants is a good idea, but for you,
Landie, I’ll make an exception.

 LANDSHARK 
 (angrily) 
Silence, you damned colonial!

Everyone looks relieved.

 GBW 
It works…

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (nudging him) 
Look!

SUSANO slowly rises to his feet.

 SUSANO 
Well. That was an experience.
 (pauses, looks confused) 
Well. That. Well. That…
 (smiles) 
Well that wily thespian Welshman threw weapons
that warped the warts!

 KIT 
 (confused) 
I did what?

 MAX SINISTER 
He is right! We no longer
have that stupid comedy accent!
 (smiles) 
We are cured!

 SUSANO 
 (nodding) 
All right. Set a course for Deutscherwelt-
we have a planet to fix!

Everyone cheers and the Germans walk out, pausing to say goodbye to MICHAEL, while the AH.commers do the same to ALAYTA.

 EXT. – SPACE – ABOVE DEUTSCHERWELT 

Another vortex opens and the two ships come out again, this time above Deutscherwelt.

 EXT. – UBER-BERLIN – ABOVE WELTSTAG – DAY 

The same view we saw earlier, with the huge towers linked together by the larger version of the Brandenburg Gate. We see two small flickers of light and two tiny pops as two people teleport down to a landing pad, then walk into the huge complex.

 INT. – WELTSTAG CHAMBER – DAY 

Once more, the huge Weltstag chamber is packed with representatives. We slowly pan down the main path into the chamber as DOCTOR WHAT and SUSANO walk up it, to the podium. KABRALOTH stands anxiously atop this, while ALBIDOOM, facing him, looks skeptical.

 KABRALOTH 
You haff returned vonce again!
But…
 (his eyes search back and forth) 
Vhere is Kapitan Steffen?

 SUSANO 
 (voice breaks) 
He gave his life so that we could
find the cure, Chancellor.

 KABRALOTH 
 (puzzled) 
Is somezing strange about
your akzent…

 SUSANO 
 (patiently) 
The cure, Chancellor.

 ALBIDOOM 
 (folds arms) 
I vill believe it vhen I see it.

 SUSANO 
Then see!

SUSANO pulls out another test tube of clear liquid and throws it into the air. Once more, the liquid turns to gas and spreads throughout the room, and then beyond. DOCTOR WHAT watches in wonder as the German politicians slump in their chairs, looking alarmed, and little wisps of green virus gas spill from their mouths before burning up. KABRALOTH manages to hang onto his podium, his eyes crossing as the cure flares within.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Hey, Chancellor, are you OK?

 KABRALOTH 
Sure…I’m…
 (blinks) 
Hey, what’s with this ‘Chancellor’?
 (looks around in confusion) 
And where am I?
 (even more confused) 
This ain’t the Apollo theatre!
My boss’ll have my hide!

DOCTOR WHAT watches, open-mouthed, as KABRALOTH, shaking his head, clambers over the podium and walks out of the Weltstag.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
But…?

 SUSANO 
I told you—the virus turned everyone on Deutscherwelt
to Germans, but now we’ve reversed it…

And as he speaks, more politicians stand up, looking confused, and walk out. Perhaps a third of them stay where they are.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
So—who’s the most senior politician
who was a German to begin with?

 SUSANO 
 (sudden realisation) 
Oh shit.

He turns around to see ALBIDOOM standing up, his eyes flaming.

 ALBIDOOM 
 (pointing at SUSANO) 
You! Political traitor! What are you doing here?
You must be locked up immediately! Guards! Seize him!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (glancing at SUSANO) 
Hasty retreat?

 SUSANO 
Danke.

DOCTOR WHAT clicks his comm and both he and SUSANO disappear with a pop. ALBIDOOM looks confused and then shakes his head, dismissing it.

 ALBIDOOM 
Never mind.
 (addresses remaining Weltstag) 
That damned virus interrupted our war!
Now we shall go on to win it, for the Fatherland!

 POLITICIANS 
 (in chorus) 
For the Fatherland!

 ALBIDOOM 
Now, I have high hopes for that war-winning
operation we were planning at the time
the virus came…what was it called again?
 (smiles) 
Oh yes.
 Operation Sealion! 

The assembled politicians cheer.

 EXT. – ABOVE DEUTSCHERWELT – DAY 

We can see the AH.com ship and the Kapitan Steffen orbiting the planet. Below, tiny explosions are already visible across Britain and Germany as the bombing raids resume.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – TELEPORTER ROOM 

G.BONE stands back as DOCTOR WHAT, looking furious, gets off the teleporter pad. SUSANO still stands there.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I can’t believe they did that!
After all we went through to help them,
and now they’re just going back to
their stupid war!

 SUSANO 
And we are branded as traitors.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (even more annoyed) 
 And we didn’t get that booze and porn!
 (pause) 
Look—if you want, we can send down some
of our men, use our advanced technology to
win the war quickly for the Allies and then-

 SUSANO 
 (laughs) 
What do you think this is, a novel by Chris?
 (shakes his head) 
No. We must work this out for ourselves.
And as for we on the Kapitan Steffen …
We still have a mission. We must take the cure
to all the planets infected by the virus, until it
was as though Pickard had never been.

DOCTOR WHAT takes a step back and nods in respect at SUSANO’s determination.

 SUSANO 
…and as it happens, we have plenty
of booze and porn on our ship anyway…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grins) 
Nah – it doesn’t matter. I just remembered,
we’ve got something even better to look forward to.
 (nods to G.BONE) 
OK, send the man back to his ship.

 SUSANO 
 (clicks heels together) 
Jawohl, Mein Kapitan!

DOCTOR WHAT gives him a funny look.

 SUSANO 
 (shrugs) 
Okay, I admit it, zer stupid komedy akzent
is beginning to grow on me.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grinning) 
Godspeed.

G.BONE presses a button and SUSANO disappears with a pop.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CONTROL ROOM 

DOCTOR WHAT steps back onto the bridge, looking strangely serene. As he does so, we catch a glimpse of the main screen. The Kapitan Steffen vanishes into a vortex.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
The Germans have left.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nodding) 
OK—Dave, how are the engines?

Cut to:

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – ENGINE ROOM 

We see DAVE HOWERY talking into the intercom.

 DAVE HOWERY 
We’ll have to jury-rig a few things, but
they seem to be holding.

DAVE HOWERY glances behind him. We see that an important-looking cable is sheared in two, with sparks coming from both ends. Slightly off to one side, PSYCHOMELTDOWN, a cast on his leg, is reclining on a lounger while KEIRA KNIGHTLEY rubs baby oil all over his body. MICHAEL looks strangely happy with this state of affairs.

 MICHAEL 
Want another tequila chaser?

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Yeah, but lay off the salt.
 (makes a face) 
I’m amazed Dave let Keira rub oil on me,
though the Sheep knows I deserve it after
that wall fell on my leg-

 MICHAEL 
 (grins) 
Well, he said something about increasing your
electrical conductivity…

PSYCHO’s gaze tracks from MICHAEL, to the sparking cable ends, to his broken leg.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Oh shit…

Cut to:

 

 

 END ACT II 

 

 
 

 TAG 

 

 

 
 

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CONTROL ROOM 

 KIT 
We’ll need to go to the Hub to let
the Nelson twins off, Doc.
 (smirks to himself) 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
OK, but that can wait.
 (turns around, faces the bridge) 
Look, you guys know I’m not much of
a one for speeches, but I want to say how
proud I am of what we achieved back there.
 (beat) 
We faced down a serious enemy and with
a level of cool, calm military professionalism
that I could never have hoped for when you
bunch of losers joined the crew, indeed, such
hopeless piles of-

 MATT 
We get the picture.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
-yeah, anyway.
 (smiles) 
And now it’s time for our reward.
 (looks upward) 
Leo, you still got the coordinates for
that timeline with all the scantily clad
big-bosomed women whose entire male
population has been killed off and they
need us to mate with all of them?

 LEO CAESIUS 
No.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Good! Then set a course and-
 (long, deadly pause) 
What do you mean, “no”?!!

 LEO CAESIUS 
I believe the meaning of the word is clear
enough, though if you prefer, I can give its
equivalent in over six million languages-

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (angrily) 
I told you to save those coordinates!

 LEO CAESIUS 
And I told you that my main navicomp
data was corrupted and to store the virus
data I’d have to overwrite the backup!
 (puts on long-suffering voice) 
But of course you self-important fleshbags
are too important to care what a lowly
genius-intellect computer thinks-

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Sorry, let me get this clear.
You. Do. Not. Have. The. Coordinates.
 (pause) 
For. The. Planet. Of. The. Big. Bosomed.
Women. Who. Want. To. Have. Sex. With. Us.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Not as such, no.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (calmly) 
Well, there’s only one thing to say to that-

 EXT. – AH.COM SHIP – SPACE 

The AH.com ship drifts entirely placidly in deep space, until-

 ENTIRE CREW 
 (medley) 
 NOOOOOOOOOOO- 

The sound of the scream vibrates the ship and shakes the camera around.

PULL OUT – MORE DISTANT VIEW

The AH.com ship is a tiny metallic dot in the middle of a star cluster, and now all of those stars start shaking around.

 ENTIRE CREW -OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO- 

PULL OUT – EVEN MORE DISTANT VIEW –

We can now see the entire galaxy, and EVERYTHING is vibrating.

 ENTIRE CREW 
-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

 INT. – THE HUB – OUROBOROS – DAY 

IAN the bartender is watching the bar and cleaning a glass with a cloth, when a small amount of plaster crumbles from the ceiling. A troubled look appears on his face.

 IAN 
Weird.
Like dozens of voices deprived
of sweet, sweet love, all crying
out in anguish.

IAN shrugs and goes back to cleaning his glass.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CONTROL ROOM – DAY 

The camera is at an off-kilter angle and all the AH.commers are lying about, blood spurting from their ears. DOCTOR WHAT, pale in the face, manages to drag himself upright.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (faraway voice) 
Kill you…kill you all…

 KIT 
 (smirking, unaffected) 
What were you saying about
cool calm military professionalism, Doc?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (shaking his finger) 
Hey—all that was just about some
psycho trying to destroy the universe.
But [u]this[/u]…
 (shudders) 

 LEO CAESIUS 
Look on the bright side, Doc—we’ll most probably
run into it again sooner or later, so long as we stay
around this part of the multiverse.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (doubtful) 
Unless someone else finds it first.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Yeah, but what are the chances of that happening?

DOCTOR WHAT grins.

ZOOM OUT – away from DOCTOR WHAT and the bridge crew, out through the big bridge window, leaving the AH.com ship in space –

And then, with an effect like God turning the page of a book, the universe flips around and we see another timeline, another Earth…

And another ship descending towards it.

A curiously… familiar looking ship. Not this specific one, but the general design…

 EXT. – EARTH – PLAZA – DAY 

A confused crowd, made up entirely of scantily clad big-breasted women, looks on as the huge ship lands before them. ‘Close Encounters of the Third Kind’ type music plays in the background.

 WOMAN 1 
Can it be…?

 WOMAN 2 
The men we seek have finally arrived?

Their voices are hushed as the ramp of the ship slowly comes down. A white mist pours out, followed by several figures, which resolve into –

Three tall big-breasted blonde women wearing incredibly tight leather uniforms with a well-remembered logo on them.

 LEAD BLONDE 
 (into a comm device) 
Yes, my Queen, it appears the new Shift-ship design works!
 (glances up at crowd) 
Well?

 WOMAN 1 
 (uncertainly) 
A terrible disease killed off all
the men on our planet.

 LEAD BLONDE 
Hey, what a coincidence. Same here.

 WOMAN 2 
We have gone without sex
for three years now…

 WOMAN 1 
 (pleadingly) 
Do you bring the men we seek?

The THREE BLONDES laugh in synchrony.

 LEAD BLONDE 
Men? Sex? Hey, listen, sister, those
two words don’t go together in our world.
 (licks her lips as she looks at WOMAN 1) 
And in just a moment, I’ll demonstrate…
But right now…

One of the other BLONDES hands the LEAD BLONDE a flag on a flagstab and the LEAD BLONDE stabs it into the ground. The flag blows out in the wind, showing a logo of two pink female symbols linked through the rings, on a background of space, stars…and many Earths.

 LEAD BLONDE 
I, Captain Venusa of the Lesbian Space Marines,
claim this planet in the name of Queen Anactoria!
 (smiles) 
The first planet in the new Lesbian Star Empire!

As the WOMEN look around uncertainly, a band of LESBIAN SPACE MARINES steps out of the ship and strikes up a familiar tune:

 LESBIAN BAND 
 In the world where I come from, there are none of those male scum.
And we lived our lives carefree, and our boobs are double D.
So we sat on each others faces, but we worried about alien races.
So we built some rocket machines, and created the Space Marines. 

 We all serve in the Lesbian Space Marines,
Lesbian Space Marines, Lesbian Space Marines
We all serve in the Lesbian Space Marines,
Lesbian Space Marines, Lesbian Space Marines. 

 And then one day, across the sun, we saw a ship, the AH.COM.
So we flew up into space, and my boobs hit me in the face.
With two black eyes, I stormed aboard, and shot some men, then shot some more.
We tied them up and took them home, then the queen yelled, “Thunderdome!” 

 We all serve in the Lesbian Space Marines,
Lesbian Space Marines, Lesbian Space Marines.
We all serve in the Lesbian Space Marines,
Lesbian Space Marines, Lesbian Space Marines. 

 Well, those men, they all went free, all because of that damn Yuppie.
And the queen just sits and sighs, thinking about her supple thighs.
But at least the crew is gone, those bastards of the AH.COM. 

 We all serve in the Lesbian Space Marines,
Lesbian Space Marines, Lesbian Space Marines.
We all serve in the Lesbian Space Marines,
Lesbian Space Marines, Lesbian Space Marines! 

 CAPTAIN VENUSA 
But we’ll get even with those AH.com bastards one day, eh?

 SECOND BLONDE 
And reclaim that Yuppie for the Queen!

 CAPTAIN VENUSA 
 (grins) 
Damn straight!
 (looks at the crowd of WOMEN) 
But first…time to instruct the Queen’s new
subjects in the customs of the Empire…

 TEASER 


The camera opens on a scene of a plush furnished sitting room with a fireplace. The camera pans across the room and stops on a large easy chair. MERRYPRANKSTER is sitting on it, a pleasant smile on his face, facing the camera.

 MERRYPRANKSTER 
Hi–I’m MerryPrankster–a character on the AH.com Series.
 (clears throat) 
Now I know that people sometimes make fun of how
I am continually trying to impart continuity into the Series -

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (VO) 
Aw Jeez–he’s at it again…

 THANDE 
 (VO) 
Every bloody episode it’s the same thing–

 MERRYPRANKSTER 
 (speaking louder to be heard over the comments) 
—CONTINUITY INTO THE SERIES—
 (coughs) 
Ahem…
 (beat) 
..but I just like to say that this particular
episode is absolutely outstanding
as even I approve of the amount
of continuity in this episode.
 (smiles) 
So sit back and enjoy the —

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Oh—Merry—that reminds me—we had a focus
group with our fan club and the results are just in.

 THANDE 
Yeah—it appears that a lot of people seem to
think that all the scenes that involved you were -
 (shuffling of papers) 
—ah!‘Character-wank’

 DOCTOR WHAT 
So the creators have decided to retcon the series
and have you removed entirely from it.

 MERRYPRANKSTER 
What? But they can’t do—

He disappears in a puff of smoke.

Pause

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Whoa—that was pretty cool!

 THANDE 
Do something else!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Uh—how about some naked lesbians?

Pause

There is a definite lack of appearance of naked lesbians.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well-crap! That sucks!

 THANDE 
Hey—what do we replace Merry with anyway?
There has to be another character there…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (shuffling papers) 
Yeah—the focus group came up with a good replacement.
They wanted to replace the character with-
 (shuffling papers again) 
 (beat) 
—an 8 foot tall Robot Chimp in a Wonder
Woman costume named‘I.P. Freely’?
 (beat) 
What the fuck? Who the hell did we have in this focus group?

 THANDE 
 (shuffling papers) 
—the patients of the Happyvale Home of Freaks, Geeks
and Really, Really Messed-Up Loonies.
 (beat) 
That’s our fan base?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
You’re surprised by that?

Pause

 THANDE 
No—not really, no. Actually explains a lot to be honest…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Indeed.
 (beat) 
Roll the episode.

 “HAIR TODAY GOTTERDAMMERUNG TOMORROW: PART 1” 


 Written By : DOCTOR WHAT&amp;THANDE 



 
 

 ACT I 



 
 

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH 

Fade up on a shot of the AH.com ship orbiting an ordinary-looking Earth, somewhere over the Americas. Pan down and zoom in on the Caribbean, passing through the clouds and heading towards a sunlit, balmy island…

 EXT. – CARIBBEAN ISLAND – DAY 

A wide shot of the island, which is covered with palm trees and sparkling white beaches. The deep blue-green water laps lazily on the sand as the brilliant sunlight shines down from the cloudless sky. Scattered about the beaches are ramshackle huts with people of many different races selling ice cream and alcohol. The beaches are covered with people relaxing on deckchairs or under parasols.

Pan across and we find that one particular beach is occupied by a large party of around twenty individuals…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (removes his sunglasses, blinks) 
Who’d have thought it—we finally found
a nice normal pleasant Earth to vacation on.

Sitting next to DOCTOR WHAT, under a parasol, IRONYUPPIE glances up lazily from what at first looks like a Mills and Boon paperback, but the romantic heroine on the cover in a period-drama dress is holding a series of whips and chains behind her back as she kisses the buff fifties-looking hero. IRONYUPPIE is wearing a bikini and getting a healthy tan.

 IRONYUPPIE 
Jebus cripes, statistically we were bound
to hit it sooner or later.

GREY WOLF walks up to the other two, dressed like Ian Fleming in white shirt, khaki trousers and sandals, and carrying a tray with seventeen tall glasses on it. Each of the glasses contains a rainbow-layered cocktail with a huge parasol on the top, some sort of slice of fruit – starting from oranges and lemons, but going up to pineapples and melons – and a blob of ice-cream. Grinning to himself, GREY WOLF sits down on a deckchair beside them.

 GREY WOLF 
Oh, sorry, did [u]you two[/u] want something to drink?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I’m easy.

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (sidelong glance) 
Known that for years, Doc—it shows
from your frankly amateurish choice of lesbian porn—

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (coughing) 
Anyway.

GREY WOLF knocks back one or two of the cocktails, then is about to reach for a third but pauses to delicately remove the slice of melon and, holding it at arm’s length, throws it away.

 GREY WOLF 
Can’t be too careful.

The other two nod solemnly. In the background, DAVE HOWERY walks up with KEIRA KNIGHTLEY. HOWERY is wearing a Hawaiian shirt and shorts with ‘American Tourist’ camera around his neck and a baseball cap which, if you look closely, reveals that he’s been to DisneyWelt from a Nazi-victory world. KEIRA is wearing a bikini but the strapless top keeps falling loosely down and DAVE hastily pushing it back up.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (happily) 
Hi, guys. Good to get away from
those damned engines for a while.
 (surveys the beach) 
Haven’t seen anything like this since that
time on that Middle Eastern planet where
those two dusky maidens rubbed olive oil into my bea-

 KEIRA 
 (sharply) 
Daaaavee…?

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (hastily) 
-bear. That’s it, yes. They rubbed olive oil
into my nice new Chinese-made bear.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
What have you done with all the engineering
staff, anyway, Dave?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Kept ’em busy.
Cut to –

 EXT. – BEACH – DAY 

Another part of the island, closer to the edge of the beach. An AH.com shuttle, the ‘Jessica Alba’, is parked beneath the palm trees and has been very unconvincingly disguised as one of the huts. On the beach, PSYCHOMELTDOWN, G.BONE and MICHAEL are all holding surfboards and arguing.

 MICHAEL 
 (to PSYCHO) 
What do you know about surfboarding –
you come from a bloody desert 500 km inland!

 PSYCHO 
 (with dignity) 
I was once imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay
on suspicion of being Vaguely Foreign Looking
and they taught me more about waterboarding
in those three years than you’ll ever know!

 MICHAEL 
That’s not the same thing,
you redhead-loving goit-

 G.BONE 
 (coughing) 
Dudes, maybe you could
let a real man show the way?

G.BONE runs into the ocean, the other two watching, then sets his sights on a huge wave heading this way. Leaping atop his surfboard, he rides the wave with amazing skill, PSYCHO and MICHAEL gaping at his ability. He jumps up, turns around and lands back on the board. Then the wave turns into a tunnel of water, which G.BONE steers the board straight through the middle.

Then the tunnel of water turns into a tunnel of light and G.BONE vanishes with a flash.

 MICHAEL 
What the fu-

 PSYCHO 
Wait…

A dome of light appears beside them on the beach and, when it fades, G.BONE is back again, holding his surfboard and smirking. Behind him are two surprised-looking men with swords, one looking like a Roman and the other a Gaul.

 G.BONE 
 (slams his surfboard into the beach) 
Beat that!

 MICHAEL 
Pfft, that’s just showing off!

 PSYCHO 
If you can surf your way into other worlds,
how come you can’t work the teleporter right?

 G.BONE 
 (defensively) 
I only switched your minds and bodies that one time!

 MICHAEL 
 (smiles in reminiscence) 
And what a happy time it was…

PSYCHO edges away.

Cut back to –

 EXT. – SUNLIT ISLAND – DAY 

The scene before with DOCTOR WHAT, DAVE HOWERY, KEIRA, IRONYUPPIE and GREY WOLF relaxing.

 GREY WOLF 
Um, what happened to Sharky?
I haven’t seen him since we landed.

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (scowls) 
I told him to go and get a tan.

Cut to –

 EXT. – BEACH – DAY 

Yet another part of the beach, this one almost deserted. A giant magnifying glass is set up and the sun’s rays are being focused down on the beach. Nearby insects shriek and burn and the sand itself is beginning to turn to molten rock. But at the epicentre of the beam is LANDSHARK in a Speedo and he’s still anaemically white. He checks himself in a mirror.

 LANDSHARK 
Dammit!
Must have post-op Michael Jackson syndrome…

Cut back to –

 EXT. – BEACH – DAY 

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (nastily) 
I told him not to come back until no-one was
doing Sam Carsten jokes about him anymore.

 GREY WOLF 
Um—but isn’t that dangerous?

 DAVE HOWERY 
It’s only Sharky.

 GREY WOLF 
 (nods) 
Yeah, but his skin actually has a negative
melanin quotient. He could end up with
huge tumours on his chest.

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (smiles to herself) 
That would certainly make our cosplaying
more…interesting.

Everyone else winces and GREY WOLF plucks a cocktail fork out of one of his glasses, stabbing himself in the eye with it.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Still, it’s about time we had a decent rest.
Who knows when we’ll next have some
wacky adventure and get the ship smashed up-

As he speaks, two familiar figures walk out of the nearby palm trees and towards them.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (sighs) 
Speak of the devil…

They get closer, revealing that it’s GBW and LUAKEL. GBW is wearing a tweed hat, a backpack and a T-shirt, shorts and trainers all with luminous strips of yellow or orange on them. LUAKEL is wearing a (spookily) identical miniature version of the costume. Also, both have binoculars on string around their necks. LUAKEL has a hunted look in his eyes.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Ah, GBWy.
Weren’t you showing Luaky
one of your many hobbies…?

 GBW 
 (nods eagerly) 
Planespotting, yes.

 GREY WOLF 
 (tuts) 
Fuck, really?
The cool people spot airships …

 GBW 
 (angrily) 
It’s exactly that prejudice which
has led to the sport being unfairly
turned down from the Intertimeline Olympics
when it is followed by literally dozens of people
in the Multiverse…

 DAVE HOWERY 
And how many planes have you seen today?

 GBW 
Well…none.
 (sighs) 
They all seem to use airships in this timeline.

 GREY WOLF 
Yay!

 GBW 
 (enthusiastically) 
But we’ve only been here for three hours,
there’s the rest of the day to consider!

LUAKEL edges up to IRONYUPPIE.

 LUAKEL 
 (whispers) 
Kill me.
Kill me now.

IRONYUPPIE ruffles his hair fondly and shakes her head.

 IRONYUPPIE 
Sorry, kid. I only know how to kill
with sexual overtones and you’re underage.

LUAKEL whimpers as GBW drags him away.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
That was cruel!

 IRONYUPPIE 
Did I mention that he sold your
DVD of Girls Who Like Grills XII 
to buy Pokémon cards?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (suddenly raging) 
That little basta-

 GBW 
 (distantly, interrupting) 
Ah, there’s a plane at last!

Heads turn to see GBW pointing at something in the sky and then looking at it with his binoculars.

 GBW 
 (cheerfully) 
Not a design I recognise, though.
It looks like the surface of the
fuselage is almost…
 (squints) 
fluffy?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Oh God, not more Furry cosplayers.

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (winsomely) 
I don’t know, they break so delightfully –

The plane, its engines roaring, flies overhead. As GBW said, its outline is blurred by brownish fur or hair hanging from it. As it goes overhead, though, metal canisters begin to fall in neat trajectories…

 GREY WOLF 
 (leaps to his feet) 
They’re bombing us!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Fuuuuuuuck!

The canisters crash down into the beach but do not explode. Instead, the tops open up and a vivid green gas begins to emerge.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Gas! They’re gassing us!
 (he grabs KEIRA) 
Don’t worry, my dear,
I’ll absorb the poison with my beard-

 GREY WOLF 
Fuck, what are you supposed to
do in a gas attack again?
 (snaps fingers) 
Oh, yeah, pee on a cloth and
hold it over your nose…

 LUAKEL 
 (cheerfully) 
Step one completed, sir!

GBW pulls out a scanner doodad and waves it in the direction of the gas.

 GBW 
Strange…
It doesn’t look like a poison gas.
It looks more like…
Bio-particles…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
A virus?
 (pulls out his radio) 
This is the captain!

Sound of many stifled laughs and snorts coming back.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (sighs) 
Look, that wasn’t funny the first 400 times you did it, either.
Listen, we’re under a virus attack!
Everyone rendezvous at the shuttle…

GREY WOLF taps his shoulder.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (angrily) 
What? I’m trying to be all macho
and Captain Kirk here!

 GREY WOLF 
Um, look…

DOCTOR WHAT turns. GREY WOLF is pointing at all the timeline natives on the other beaches and in the huts. As the gas washes over them, they fall to the floor and then their features begin to melt and change. Mere seconds later, they rise up again, but with a faraway, zombie-like look in their eyes.

DOCTOR WHAT rushes over to the man running the nearest drinks hut, an ALTERNATE MEJ.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Are you all right?

 ALTEERNATE MEJ 
 (thick Caribbean accent) 
Oh yes mah brothers.
Sing wi’ me!
We have an island in de sun…

The other TIMELINE NATIVES come out of the other huts and, spontaneously, they form a musical-style choreographed calypso.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
What the fu…?!

 DAVE HOWERY 
Doc!

DOCTOR WHAT spin around again to find DAVE HOWERY pointing at a tank heading their way, up the beach. Out in the bay, there is suddenly a fleet of battleships and landing craft disgorging more tanks and troops. The troops wear grey and the vehicles are flying the Confederate battle flag.

The tank’s main gun fires, sending a shell over DOCTOR WHAT’s head, where it slams into the nearest hut and blows it up. The tank’s hatch opens to reveal a grinning ROBERTP6165 in a Confederate general’s uniform.

 ROBERTP6165 
Surrender, y’all!
The whole Caribbean and Central America,
and anywhere else we happen to feel like, .
is now annexed to the Confederate
Fillibusterin’ States of Ameriwank!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Ah—no can do, my Rebel friend—we’re not
native to these islands and so if you don’t mind—

 ROBERTP6165 
Not before we enslave you all
’cause we’re Just That Evil!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (sidelong whisper) 
Suggestions?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Run away very fast.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Good idea!

The AH.commers turn and run away from the tank as it sprays bullets over their heads.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (panting) 
Back to the shuttle!

 EXT. – ABOVE THE ISLAND – DAY 

A wide shot shows the AH.commers converging on the shuttle. The gas is now a green haze over the whole area. More Confederate troops are disembarking.

 EXT. – THE BEACH – DAY 

PSYCHO, MICHAEL and G.BONE run away from two strafing Confederate fighters, holding their surfboards over their heads as shields, and meet up with the other AH.commers as they arrive. LANDSHARK is still bone-white but his Speedos are now on fire. All the AH.commers pile into the shuttle.

 INT. – SHUTTLE – DAY 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Get us out of here!

 DAVE HOWERY 
Right!
 (to PSYCHO, G.BONE, MICHAEL) 
Did you bozos refuel us like I told you to?

 MICHAEL 
We took the fuel cap off
and then we found something
far more interesting to do.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (muttering to himself) 
Launch!

DAVE HOWERY pulls a lever and, with a cough, the shuttle’s engines fire and it takes off.

 EXT. – ABOVE THE ISLAND – DAY 

The shuttle roars off into the sky. The Confederate fighter planes chase it for a short distance, their bullets impacting harmlessly on the shuttle’s shields, then peel off as the shuttle heads into the upper atmosphere.

 INT. – SHUTTLE – DAY 

The AH.commers breathe out, clearly glad to have escaped.

 GBW 
What was that thing?

 GREY WOLF 
 (grimly) 
I recognised it.
The virus from Stereotypica.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nodding) 
It can’t be anything else.
That’s why we were immune—
that cure that Torq cooked up afterwards.

 DAVE HOWERY 
We never did figure out who
made that virus.
 (grimly) 
Now we’ve caught them in the act.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
And they spoiled our vacation.

An undercurrent of anger runs around the shuttle.

 IRONYUPPIE 
I respectfully suggest that we hunt them
down and make them eat their own nuts.

 LANDSHARK 
No fair! How come they get to do that
after ruining a planet! I had to do much
harder things before you let—

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (coughing) 
Anyway…

The viewscreen shows the AH.com ship approaching.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Come on – we’ll get to the bottom of this.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Thank Christ we didn’t bring Kit…

 (titles) 

 EXT. – SPACE – DAY 

The AH.com ship is still orbiting the Earth from before, which now has a green haze over most of the Americas – the virus is multiplying.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – BRIEFING ROOM – DAY 

All the AH.commers are assembled in the briefing room. DOCTOR WHAT is standing at the fore, in front of a Powerpoint presentation, and seems to have just briefed them on the situation.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
…so that’s what happened.
Leo, did you catch any sight of that…
 (hesitates) 
‘furry plane’ that bombed us?

 LEO CAESIUS 
My sensors detected a silhouette and
then it appeared to enter the upper atmosphere,
suggesting it is space-capable. However, it then
went over the curve of the horizon and I lost sight of it.

Disappointed murmurs.

 LEO CAESIUS 
However, I did detect another signal in the system.
A shift-capable ship…

Interested murmurs. A hologram appears on the projector in the middle of the briefing table and rotates, showing a simple-looking but sleek ship that looks rather like a 1930s Flash Gordon rocket-ship.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (stroking his goatee) 
That looks vaguely familiar…

 LEO CAESIUS 
Indeed. I cross-referenced it in my databanks
and I identified it. We encountered it near the
CTT.net, six months ago.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
It’s Floid’s ship?
 (keenly) 
I wonder if he has any more porn…

 LEO CAESIUS 
Negative. The ship of Floid the Pornmaster
was identified as a second vessel.
This is the ship of the mercenary unit
known only as The Germans.

Angry murmurs go around the table.

 HENDRYK 
 (furiously) 
They must be forcing other planets to
act as stereotypically as them!
 (spits) 
 Boches! 

 GBW 
Presumably the Germans’ ship is
a mothership for the, er, furry plane
and deploys it to bomb with the virus
canisters on each world.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Each world…then they may strike again!
Leo, did you get their technobabbylon-particle trail?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Naturally.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (pointing at LANDSHARK) 
Then lay in a pursuit course at maximum…thing!

 LANDSHARK 
 (to IRONYUPPIE, sidelong) 
Why’s he pointing at me?

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (sidelong to LANDSHARK) 
You’re the chief pilot.

 LANDSHARK 
 (genuinely surprised) 
Really??

DOCTOR WHAT sighs.

 EXT. – SPACE – DAY 

The AH.com ship breaks orbit with the Earth – the green gas is spreading even further. A shuttle leaves the AH.com ship and heads down.

 INT. – SHUTTLE – DAY 

THANDE and TORQUMADA are in the shuttle, along with BOBO and the GIANT MOSQUITO in the back seats. THANDE operates the comm, while TORQUMADA pilots.

 THANDE 
See you around, Doc.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (VO) 
Mix up some more of that cure
and help those poor people
 (hard voice) 
We’ll come and pick you up after we’ve…
dealt with them.

 THANDE 
Yessir. Thande out.

He flicks the comm off, then glares at TORQUMADA.

 THANDE 
Why can’t I drive?

 TORQUMADA 
The last time we let you drive, you crashed
the shuttle into the Empire State Building…

 THANDE 
 (hotly) 
That was a mistake anyone could have made!

 TORQUMADA 
…while we were in Los Angeles.

 THANDE 
Okay, maybe not.

 TORQUMADA 
 (briskly) 
Good.
Now find me the area worst afflicted so
we can help them first.
If there’s more than one, prioritise for regions
most likely to contain women in bikinis
with beachball-sized bazongas.

Shaking his head and muttering to himself, THANDE works the control panel.

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH 

As the shuttle heads down to Earth, the AH.com Ship forms a vortex and vanishes into it.

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH 

A vortex opens up and out shoots the AH.COM ship.

 INT. – AH.COM BRIDGE – DAY 

We see DOCTOR WHAT, GBW, MATT, LANDSHARK, MICHAEL and DIAMOND at various stations.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Analysis, LEO.

 LEO 
Well—-the crew’s overall performance up to this point
can charitably be described as ‘incompetent’, while your
own performance requires work-value attitudinal readjustment,
the ship is in dire need of a new paint job, my secondary
back-up hard drive is corrupted with spambots, my robot
body needs an upgrade, Dave really needs a shave, the –

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Not of us! The ship we’ve been chasing for the last 3 hours!

 LEO 
Oh—that.
 (beat) 
Particle trail analysis indicates that the
German mercenary ship has Shifted again.

Annoyed cursing sounds from the bridge crew.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Again? This is, like, the eighteenth time….

 LEO 
Nineteenth actually.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (sighing) 
Fine. LEO, get ready to do another –

 MATT 
 (looking at something on his console) 
Whoa! Incoming transmission!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
On screen.

The viewscreen shows an image of about a dozen or so scantily clad, big bosomed women.

 WOMAN 1 
Help us please. A terrible disease has killed off all the men on our planet.

 WOMAN 2 
We have gone without sex for 3 years now.

 WOMAN 3 
We are in dire need of men to make love to us.

 WOMAN 4 
Long passionate love. With all of us. Constantly.

 WOMAN 5 
Will you help us?

 WOMAN 6 
The future of our planet depends on it.

We see the entire bridge crew staring in shock and amazement at the viewscreen. Several of them are drooling. A few wisps of smoke are coming from one or two of the consoles as the drool dripping on them starts shorting out several of the electrical components.

Doctor What is the first to recover.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Right! Everyone form an orderly stampede to the shuttle bay behind me!

The crew races towards the bridge doors—which fails to open.

WHOMP!

We see a large pile of ah.commers near the doors. One by one, the bridge crew gets up off the floor. Finally, the last crew member—Doctor What—slowly gets up and walks unsteadily back towards his command chair.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (looking up at ceiling) 
Leo?

 LEO 
Sorry about that but we DO have a world to save and some bad guys to catch, after all.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
But we can do a quick side trip!

 LEO 
Analysis of the particle trail indicates that the Germans Shifted
away a mere five minutes ago. If we jump right away, we just
might be able to catch up to them in the next timeline. Even a
delay of ten minutes could mean that we will have to start the
chase all over again—with no guarantee that we will be able
to continue tracking them.

 MATT 
I can do ten minutes!

 MICHAEL 
Heck—that’s seven minutes longer than my personal record!

 LEO 
Gentlemen!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (reluctantly) 
Fine! Just mark the coordinates of this timeline—
we’ll be back once all this is done!

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH 

The AH.COM ship forms a vortex and vanishes into it

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH 

The AH.COM ship comes out of the vortex.

Pan slowly to the left to reveal—

-The German ship, opening up another vortex!

 INT. – AH.COM BRIDGE – DAY 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
After them! Full power to all weapons and shields!

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH 

The German ship flies into the vortex, followed seconds later by the AH.COM ship.

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH 

The two ships emerge. The AH.COM starts activating their weapons.

 INT. – AH.COM BRIDGE – DAY 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Matt! Disable that ships engines! We can’t let them get away again!

 MATT 
With pleasure!
 (starts firing away) 
Take that, you deutsch asshats!

 EXT. – SPACE – NEAR EARTH 

We see particle beams and missiles lance out from the AH.COM ship and impact on the German ship. Its shields manage to absorb the brunt of most of the shots but we can see a few small explosions appear here and there on the hull of the ship where the shots managed to make it past a weak point in the shields.

The German ship turns and starts firing at the AH.Com ship.

The two ships are nearly obscured by the barrage of weapons fire as they fly past each other, the shields of both ships sparkling spectacularly as they do so. Several shots from the German ship manage to penetrate the shields and impact on the AH.COM, causing a ripple of small explosions on its hull.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – DAY 

The ship is shaking from all the impacts. A few panels here and there spark and flare while a layer of smoke hangs near the ceiling.

 MATT 
They’re coming around for another pass!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Keep blasting them!

 EXT- SPACE –NEAR EARTH 

The two ships make another pass at each, firing off a barrage of weapons fire that is if anything more intense than the first one. Although neither ship seems to be crippled, it’s obvious that both ships are getting a beating.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – DAY 

The bridge is trashed worse than before—the emergency lights are on, one or two of the consoles are totally fried, and there’s smoke everywhere now.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (waving smoke out of his face) 
Status!

 GBW 
 (reading some screens) 
A couple of sensors are out, the secondary fuel intake
chambers are both flooded, small fires on 4 different decks…

 MICHAEL 
 (reading screens) 
…hull breech on level five…

 DIAMOND 
 (reading other screens) 
..shields down to 42%…

 MATT 
 (reading yet other screens) 
…particle beams 3 and 4 are jammed, missile launchers 1, 5 and 7 are down…

 LANDSHARK 
…and worse of all—the pilot seat doesn’t go up and down anymore!

 LEO 
Incoming transmission!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
On screen!

The viewscreen flickers into life and we see the bridge of the German ship.

Sitting in the Captain’s chair is STEFFEN. In the first officer’s seat is SUSANO. Sitting at various stations and consoles are ALAYTA, MAX SINISTER and CARLTON BACH.

 STEFFEN 
Zurrender und prepare to be boarded!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Never! We’ll make you pay for what you did!

STEFFEN and SUSANO glance at each other in confusion.

 STEFFEN 
Say again, ja? Vat we do?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Don’t jerk us around—you know
exactly what you did, you bastards!

 SUSANO 
Vat da hell you speak of?

 MATT 
You released that Stereotype virus on that
planet a few timelines back, you asshats!

The German crew stare open-jawed for a few seconds—then, as one, they all scowl and frown.

 STEFFEN 
 (barely able to contain his anger) 
VE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Yeah—like we believe you.

 STEFFEN 
Ve don’t give a shit vat you believe!
Ve speak the truth! Ve are not responsible!

 SUSANO 
Nein!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Why the hell should we believe you?

 STEFFEN 
Vould ve speak like this if ve had a cure for ze virus!

 SUSANO 
Ve are infected too!

 MAX SINISTER 
Ja! Ve all are! This ship und everyone
on ze planet below!

We see the AH.commers exchange a few glances amongst each other. None of them look totally convinced—but there’s small glimmers of doubt on their faces…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
If you weren’t responsible, then why were you on that planet?

 STEFFEN 
Ve are seeking ze people who are responsible!
Ve believe they were on that planet!

 SUSANO 
But ve lost ze zignal a few timelines back.

We see DOCTOR WHAT deep in thought.

 MATT 
 (sotto voce) 
Doc—you think we should believe them?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (shrugging shoulders) 
 (sotto voce) 
Not sure—but we sure as hell can’t keep pounding each other
like this. And they ARE talking like stereotypical Germans after all….
 (looks back at viewscreen) 
You say the planet below is infected as well?

 STEFFEN 
Ja! It is our homeworld.
 (beat) 
I propose a compromise solution for our dilemma. Ve two
captains go down to der planet below. Und ve exchange
one crew member per ship. Zis way none of us do anything
funny und each of us haff a potential hostage.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (suspiciously) 
And what exactly will I find on the homeworld?

 STEFFEN 
The truth!

Doctor What turns toward his crew.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well? What you think?

 MATT 
I think it’s a dumb idea but if it buys us some time…

 GBW 
And who knows—maybe they’re speaking the truth.

 DIAMOND 
I have to concur with my logical colleague here, despite the fact
that he refuses to see the light regarding the wonders of pantslessness.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Sharky?

 LANDSHARK 
These are the same dudes who would rather argue politics
than get handjobs from big breasted naked Asians, right?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Yeah-so what’s your point?

 LANDSHARK 
No point—I’m still trying to wrap my mind
around that concept, that’s all.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
But that happened months ago!

 LANDSHARK 
I’m a deep thinker…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (sotto voce) 
Well—certainly deep in something
 (beat) 
Michael?

 MICHAEL 
Better you than me, Doc

DOCTOR WHAT nods his head.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Thanks for volunteering to be the German’s hostage.

Ignoring Michael’s shocked expression, Doctor What turns to see the viewscreen.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
You’ve got yourself a deal!

STEFFEN nods.

 EXT. – SPACE – ABOVE THE PLANET 

We can see the AH.com ship and the German ship in parallel orbits, both with some damage and scarring from the brief battle. Both ships open their hangar bays and launch two shuttles each, one of which goes down to the planet and the other heads for the other ship. The German shuttles look rather like flying VW Beetles.

 INT. – SHUTTLE ‘JENNIFER GARNER’ – COCKPIT 

DOCTOR WHAT is lounging in the back of the mostly empty shuttle, while GBW and LUAKEL are sitting in the piloting seats at the front. GBW is now wearing a flying helmet and humming cheerfully, if tunelessly as he holds the piloting yoke, while LUAKEL operates the sensor displays.

 LUAKEL 
 (as his console beeps) 
Leo confirms the German shuttles are scanned.
No suspicious readings. They seem to be telling the truth.

 GBW 
 (gentle chiding) 
Never assume, young Luaky.
Why, did I ever tell you about the time
when I mixed up the two Nine Years’ Wars and…

 LUAKEL 
 (hopefully) 
…and you ended up in the middle of a bloody
battle and had to flee back to the AH.com ship
in an exciting story?

 GBW 
No-oo, I just had to take the textbook
with the order of battle and coloured
illustrations back to the shop.

 LUAKEL 
…oh.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (speaking up) 
Quiet, you two.
 (importantly) 
I’ve got research to do.

DOCTOR WHAT puts his feet up on another chair, then opens an official-looking briefcase and pulls out several German-language porn magazines, which he begins carefully studying. He unfolds one large centrefold (not visible to us) and his eyebrows go up and down as he turns it ninety degrees first one way and then another.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
My word—so that’s 
where Hitler got the idea
for his moustache from.

GBW and LUAKEL look confused.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – HANGAR BAY 

Several AH.commers, led by LANDSHARK, stand by as the German shuttle lands, and then the doors open with a hiss.

 LANDSHARK 
 (to the others) 
Alright, you bunch of overly macho
gun-toting colonials who are obviously
overcompensating for something-

 MATT 
 (patiently) 
Can you please get to the point?

 LANDSHARK 
 (half to himself) 
Funny, that’s exactly what Erikka
said the other day…
 (as the others shudder, he continues) 
If these Krauts try anything dodgy,
get ready to blow their heads off!

 OTHER AH.COMMERS 
 (enthusiastically) 
Sir, yes, sir!

LANDSHARK goes up to the shuttle and cautiously peers through the open door, then goes in and out the other door.

 LANDSHARK 
It’s empty!

The other AH.commers follow him and go through the shuttle’s interior, pulling things up and looking under them, then nod in agreement.

 DMA 
They must have double-crossed us!

 GERMAN VOICE 
 (VO) 
Vhy are you all over zere?

The AH.commers abruptly spin around to find one of the Germans – ALAYTA – lying nonchalantly back on a deckchair resting where they were just standing. A black-red-gold towel is hanging from the arm of the deckchair.

 LANDSHARK 
 (muttering to himself) 
Bloody Krauts.

 EXT. – AERIAL VIEW OF BERLIN – DAY 

The two shuttles descend on Berlin, which looks hugely enlarged compared to the OTL version. In some ways it looks like Hitler’s Germania, but doesn’t have the grand, exaggerated Nazi architecture – it is, however, clearly the world capital.

 INT. – SHUTTLE ‘JENNIFER GARNER – COCKPIT – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT nods and folds up his porn magazines as GBW carefully pilots them down onto a landing pad. Before him, a German in a quasi-military uniform guides him down with flashing tennis rackets.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Where are we?

 LUAKEL 
Look around!

As the hatch hisses open, DOCTOR WHAT does so. The landing pad is connected, Star Wars-style, to a series of towers linked together in a huge complex. The two largest towers are linked by a broad, high bridge on which is a larger version of the statues from the Brandenburg Gate. Inscribed on the bridge are the letters, twenty feet tall: DEM DEUTSCHEN VOLKE.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (private dick voice) 
So dis must be da place.

The German shuttle lands on the pad next to them and STEFFEN, in full uniform with medals and dress regalia, gets out and sharply salutes DOCTOR WHAT, who returns it rather sloppily.

 STEFFEN 
Kommen, ve shall explain.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nods, then turns to GBW) 
You two – if anyone tries to steal
the shuttle, activate self-destruct.

 GBW 
Yessir!
 (pause) 
Erm, you do mean we’re
supposed to get out first?

But DOCTOR WHAT has already left, following STEFFEN down a high walkway that leads to the centre of the complex. GBW sighs.

 INT. – WELTSTAG CHAMBER – DAY 

The central Weltstag chamber is a huge, impressive room with neo-Gothic architecture, rows upon rows of seats all facing inwards to the speaker’s podium, and with tall windows somewhere in the high reaches of the room that shed light on the proceedings. A large number of the hundreds of representatives are wearing (different) military uniforms.

DOCTOR WHAT and STEFFEN enter as a man is speaking at the podium. This is WELTSKANZLER KABRALOTH.

 KABRALOTH 
 (addressing the representatives) 
…I urge you all to be patient, ja?
Zey are our last best hope for ein cure, und-

One of the representatives, ALBIDOOM, stands up and yells back:

 ALBIDOOM 
Zen zey are ein forlorn hope!
Ve haff given zem enough chances!
It is time to-

But as he speaks, KABRALOTH catches sight of the approaching STEFFEN out of the corner of his eye and, with relief, shouts over ALBIDOOM:

 KABRALOTH 
Be zilent!
Kapitan Steffen has even now returned!

Murmurs spread throughout the room as STEFFEN goes up to the podium, with DOCTOR WHAT, and KABRALOTH turns to him.

 STEFFEN 
 (salutes) 
Herr Weltskanzler, sir!

 KABRALOTH 
 (avariciously) 
Vell, Kapitan? Do you haff zem?
Haff you hunted zem down at last?

 STEFFEN 
Ah – er – not exactly. Not yet, nein.

Groans and sighs spread throughout the room, and ALBIDOOM looks triumphant.

 ALBIDOOM 
You all see, ja?
Zey are nozing but failures-

 STEFFEN 
 (talks over him) 
But, we have gained a new ally.

 KABRALOTH 
Explain.

 STEFFEN 
 (points to DOCTOR WHAT) 
Zis is zer kapitan off zer ‘AH.com Ship’.
Zey haff access to far more advanced sensors
zan us, and haff agreed to help us track down
zer perpetrators off zis deed.

 KABRALOTH 
 (musingly) 
Zer AH.com Ship…
Did you not say zat zat vas zer
name off zer ship you fought vhile
helping Floid the Pornmaster?

 STEFFEN 
Ah – yes – zat is correct –

 ALBIDOOM 
 (angrily) 
Zen zey are zer vons who
scuppered our scheme!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Er – what? Excuse me—Floid
had taken over the ship of my
good friend, Chris-

 ALBIDOOM 
 (impatiently) 
Irrelevant.

 STEFFEN 
Perhaps it is best iff we start
at zer beginning?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (confused) 
Yeah, maybe…

 STEFFEN 
 (reminiscing) 
It all began many years ago…

The screen dissolves into the ‘smeary dreams of reminiscence’ effect.

 EXT. – FLASHBACK – SOMEWHERE IN CENTRAL EUROPE – NIGHT 

A dark landscape. Searchlights sweep the air and we can hear air-raid sirens going off. The searchlights briefly illuminate RAF bombers as they pass overhead, and anti-aircraft guns fire.

But above the bombers, we catch a brief glimpse of another plane, large, with an irregular, hairy outline, and a single bomb being dropped from it…

STEFFEN’s voice speaks over some of the events as we see them unfolding.

 STEFFEN 
 (VO) 
It vas zer height off zer Zecond World War, ja?
Mein men und I were assigned to a bomb disposal squad.
It vas dangerous vork. Ve vere assigned it because
ve had been locked up by zer Nazis as political dissidents…

A group of German soldiers are visible going up a road, all with heavy backpacks of bomb disposal equipment. They are led by STEFFEN, with captain’s rank, and behind him we can see the other Germans we have seen before – SUSANO, MAX SINISTER, ALAYTA, OBERDADA, and others.

 SUSANO 
Zer stupid Nazis fail to
see zer inbuilt ideological
contradiction off opposing
zer Bolshevism vhile at zer same
time incorporating-

 MAX SINISTER 
 (interrupting) 
Nein, nein! You forget zat by its very
nature zer Nazi system has flaw due to-

 STEFFEN 
Ja, vhat is needed is more capitalism!

 ALL OTHERS 
NEIN!!

 STEFFEN 
 (VO) 
Off course, ve vere not all dissidents
off zer same stripe…

As we watch the Germans approach a field which is dotted with both craters and unexploded bombs, and they go to work, carefully dismantling the bombs and disarming them with special tools.

STEFFEN winces and cuts a red wire, then relaxes as the bomb he is working on stops ticking.

 ALAYTA 
 (calling) 
Kapitan! I haff not seen
von like zis before-

STEFFEN gets up and goes over to ALAYTA, who is standing in front of a particularly large, unusual-looking bomb of some shiny, unfamiliar metal.

 STEFFEN 
I do not recognise it eizer.

 ALAYTA 
 (cautiously) 
I sink ve should call for backup…

 STEFFEN 
 (snorts) 
And give zem an excuse to stick
us back in zer camp? Nein.
One way or zer other, I’m never going back.

With a caution that betrays his careless words, STEFFEN pulls out two precision tools and gently taps the bomb all over, then takes out a third tool –

 ALAYTA 
Wait!
What’s happening?

STEFFEN looks up to find that the bomb’s cap is unscrewing itself from within.

 STEFFEN 
Mein Gott!

The cap flies off and a noxious green gas emerges.

 ALAYTA 
Zer Tommies are gassing us!

Both of them collapse, halfway through reaching for their gasmasks. As they fall, STEFFEN half-unconsciously fumbles in his pocket, pulls out a towel and throws it on the ground beneath him…

Pan across to the bomb, now empty…and we see that at the bottom of the canister, wrapped around it, is a single, very long brown hair…

Fade back to ‘here-and-now’.

 INT. – WELTSTAG CHAMBER – DAY 

STEFFEN is hanging his head in shame as he recounts the story.

 STEFFEN 
If I had done it differently –
if I had been more cautious –

 ALBIDOOM 
 (stabbing a finger) 
Ja, zen our world vould
not haf become like zis!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (confused) 
But why did you all become Germans?
When the virus affected my crew, we
all became our own national stereotypes!

 KABRALOTH 
Our scientists believe zat, as zer virus
infected Germans first, it mutated and
turned zer rest of zer vorld likevise.
 (snorts) 
I’m from Brooklyn, für Gott’s sake!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Whoa.
 (thinks) 
Wait—if this world is only a few years
past WW2—how did you get the expertise
to build that ship?

 KABRALOTH 
Because ve now haff an entire world of-
 (makes sarcastic quote marks in air) 
“Brilliant German Scientists”, ja?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Ah.

 ALBIDOOM 
Not zat it did much goot!
 (glares at DOCTOR WHAT) 
Our scientists tried to invent a cure,
but zey only managed to make another
virus, a Misspelling Virus.

 KABRALOTH 
So ve gave Kapitan Steffen and his men
a chance to redeem zemselves. Help zat
Pornmaster Floid viz his plan to create zer Pornship.

 ALBIDOOM 
Und viz zer money, ve could buy in advanced
medicine from zer other timelines to make a cure.
 (glares at DOCTOR WHAT again) 
But you, you interdimensional do-gooders – you stopped us!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (holds up hands) 
Hey—I’ll be the first to admit that I found the
idea of stopping the Pornship plan meant I
couldn’t sleep at night for weeks –

 KABRALOTH 
 (sharply) 
It matters not now.
 (looks at DOCTOR WHAT) 
You said your crew was affected?
So you found a cure?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nods) 
Yes, two of my crew are now administering
it on an affected planet. After they’ve finished,
maybe they can come here…

 EXT. – SUNLIT ISLAND – DAY 

Back in the holiday timeline, THANDE and TORQUMADA have set up an outdoors lab on the beach of the Caribbean island. In the background, we can see BOBO and the MOSQUITO flying around. All around them, the once-idyllic scene has been made hellish, with wrecked Confederate tanks and aircraft lying around, the palm trees and shacks turned into burnt-out shacks, etc.

 THANDE 
 (casually) 
Experiment 56 was certainly quite
spectacular, wasn’t it?

 TORQUMADA 
 (nods) 
I’ll miss my eyebrows for weeks.

 THANDE 
Still, at least it made those damned
Confederates back off.
 (walks over to TORQ’s station) 
How’s it going?

 TORQUMADA 
 (pouring two test tubes together) 
Soon…ah, that’s it.
 (smiles) 
The first new batch of my Stereotypica cure.

 THANDE 
Does it have to be injected?

 TORQUMADA 
The first batch does. After that it
will turn into an anti-virus and
spread throughout the world,
curing the first one.

 THANDE 
 (admires) 
Wow, that’s positively Star Trek
levels of made-up pseudoscience.

 TORQUMADA 
Thanks.

TORQUMADA ladles his mixture into a syringe.

 TORQUMADA 
Now all we need is a victim…

 THANDE 
I think we can oblige.
 (whistles) 

The MOSQUITO and BOBO descend before them. In two of its legs, the MOSQUITO is holding an annoyed-looking ROBERTP6165 and BOBO’s tentacles have him tied up.

 ROBERTP6165 
Get off me, you freak!

 MOSQUITO 
Which one of us are you referring to?

 ROBERTP6165 
The one that’s trying to…er…run my blockade!

 TORQUMADA 
 (nodding) 
That’ll be Bobo. He does that.
Here, this won’t hurt a bit.
 (sotto voce) 
It’ll hurt a lot.

TORQUMADA jabs ROBERTP6165 in the arm with the syringe.

 ROBERTP6165 
Ouch!

THANDE goes up next to TORQUMADA with a handheld scanner.

 TORQUMADA 
 (to ROBERTP6165) 
Well? Feel anything?

 ROBERTP6165 
 (dirty look) 
Just a wicked urge to strangle that brain thing.

TORQUMADA is about to retort, but THANDE pales and points at the scanner’s display.

 THANDE 
Look at these readings!

TORQUMADA does so, and pales in turn.

 TORQUMADA 
What the fu – the cure’s not working!

 THANDE 
 (grimly) 
The virus has mutated, become resistant.
Or maybe been…redesigned.

 TORQUMADA 
 (cursing) 
But that means…

He points the scanners at himself, and then at THANDE, then nods.

 TORQUMADA 
I thought so! Our own vaccinations are breaking down!
 (in horror) 
If we don’t come up with a new cure soon, we’ll
become vulnerable again!

 THANDE 
What about everyone on the ship?

 TORQUMADA 
Um – it takes hours of continuous
exposure for the virus to overcome
our vaccinations.
 (nods) 
They should be fine as long as they
don’t have prolonged contact
with anyone who has the virus.

 THANDE 
 (relieved) 
Well, that’s something.
Now, let’s get to work.

TORQUMADA nods and he and THANDE go into overdrive, rapidly mixing substances, scribbling in notepads and fiddling with petri dishes.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – HANGAR BAY 

MATT, LANDSHARK, DMA and ALAYTA are all playing Twister. ALAYTA appears to be winning. As we watch, DMA spins the dial.

 DMA 
Left hand red – dammit -

As he struggles to make the shift, he collapses.

 LANDSHARK 
Get on with it – I’m in prolonged contact
with a Kraut here!

 ALAYTA 
Is not exactly zer HappyTime für me eizer, ja?

They continue playing.

 INT.–SHUTTLE‘JENNIFER GARNER’–COCKPIT – DAY 

Tight on GBW’s face. Pull back and we see him holding cards.

Pull back even more and we see him and luakel sitting around a small table, chips and cards upon the table.

GBW sets down his cards.

 GBW 
Confederate ACW win.
Aztec America.
And… Canada Superpower.

 LUAKEL 
 (groans) 
Damn it.
 (throws cards down) 

GBW collects his winnings, a big smirk on his face. As he counts his chips, his eyes glance towards luakel. We notice that luakel has a small bandage on the back of his neck.

 GBW 
 (pointing) 
Hey—how the heck did you get that?

 LUAKEL 
 (rolling his eyes) 
Flocc did that to me yesterday.

 GBW 
How? And why?

 LUAKEL 
Well—it all started…

F/X – Swirly Flashback effect thingy

 INT. – FLOCCULENCIO’S CHAMBER – DAY 

We slowly pan across Flocculencio’s chambers. It is dimly lit, with only the light from several candles illuminating the room. Flocculencio is seated cross-legged in the center of the room, wearing long flowing multi-coloured robes and a jewel encrusted turban.

Luakel is seated before him, looking very confused.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Verily—all was good and the people were
happy upon hearing the words of Goatism.
The Holy Tenets—that there is no Goat but Goat,
and Flocculencio is its Prophet and that women
are soft and smell good and are to be encouraged –
were embraced by all, and Peace and Good Times
and much Drinking reigned throughout the lands.
 (beat) 
But it was not to be, for Evil lurked
in the shadows waiting for a chance
to destroy all the Goodness.

 LUAKEL 
And that was?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Two evil forces—one from within and one from outside—
conspired to destroy the Holy Word of Goatism. The evil
false prophet known as Justin Pickard earned the title of
Great Satan through his numerous attacks upon the peaceful
followers of the Goat. Though Pickard brooded from afar,
the turmoil caused by this led to an attempt by the turncoat
apostle Nek to rebel against the ordained hierarchy of the Faith.
Though he had previously sold himself and his womenfolk
into indentured servitude, he chafed in his bonds and repeatedly
attempted to cause trouble, finally renouncing the Faith. Now—
the two of them—Pickard, the Great Satan and his foolish follower
the apostate Nek now given the title of the Lesser or Leicester Satan
and excommunicated by the Caliph – still roam the multiverse,
spreading the false lies of tainted Goatism.

 LUAKEL 
Gosh.
 (beat) 
So—like—what will you do if you were
ever to meet them again?

Flocculencio’s eyes start twitching and we notice a strange tic at the corner of his mouth. He suddenly gets up and walks towards a table. Picking it up, he smashes it onto the floor and picks up a table leg (with a large rusty nail sticking out of it) and turns to face Luakel.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (incoherent screaming) 
Ghaaaarrr-Aaaaarrrrggghhh!!!

Luakel’s eyes widen in fear and he rushes out of the room, Flocculencio right behind him.

F/X – Swirly Flashback effect thingy

 LUAKEL 
Honestly—I’m telling you—that guy is getting crazier and crazier every day.

GBW ponders this for a long moment.

 GBW 
How can you tell the difference?

 INT. – GERMAN SHIP – DAY 

We see Michael at a dinner table with several Germans— MAX
SINISTER and CARLTON BACH, to name just a few—are eating a massive meal consisting of Sauerkraut, a bowl filled with a red cabbage-apple mixture, a huge plate of grilled pig’s knuckles, Bratwurst, and potato dumplings. Massive quantities of beer are being consumed.

Michael looks like he’s going to explode if he eats one more bite of food and is clearly unable to keep up with the German’s drinking ability.

 CARLTON BACH 
Und now—ve sing!

CARLTON BACH and Max Sinister wrap an arm around Michael’s shoulders and, waving their beer steins, start singing what sounds like a German drinking song.

The Germans are enjoying the singing immensely and are shouting at the top of their lungs, much to Michael’s annoyance. Between the food, the beer, the loud singing and the fact that he’s being rocked back and forth by the Germans on either side of him, Michael looks rather ill and his eyes are starting to glaze over.

 CARLTON BACH 
Und now—you sing eine vith us!

Michael’s eyes widen and he looks around frantically for an escape. Seeing none, he sighs deeply.

 MICHAEL 
Oh alright
 (beat) 
Wenn auch so manche schöne Stadt
Sehenswürdigkeiten hat
Eins gibt es nirgendwo wie hier
Das ist das Münchener Bier

Michael suddenly collapses to the floor as he starts to drown in his own drool from speaking all the German words too quickly.

 CARLTON BACH 
 (looking down at Michael then back at the Germans) 
Das iz not good, nein?

 MAX SINISTER 
 (shrugging shoulders) 
He iz from Australia.

 CARLTON BACH 
Oh.
 (beat) 
No worries then, nein?

 MAX SINISTER 
Ja!

The Germans go back to singing.

 EXT. – WELTSTAG COMPLEX – DAY 

We see DOCTOR WHAT and STEFFEN walking. We see the WELTSTAG CHAMBER in the background.

 STEFFEN 
So—you vill help us?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Of course. At the very least, our vaccine
should be of immense help to your people.
And once we get back to our ships, I’ll
transmit all the scans we took of that
‘fuzzy ship’ over to your ship. Maybe
it will help you track down those guys.

 STEFFEN 
Vill you assist us in der chase?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (reluctant voice) 
I don’t know…
 (beat) 
You may have noticed—my crew isn’t what you will call ‘dedicated fighters’.
 (beat) 
Dedicated drinkers, yes. Dedicated porn addicts, certainly.
Dedicated borderline lunatics who manage to survive the
most outrageous adventures through pure dumb
luck every week—well, that’s a given.
Fighters?
 (shaking head) 
Sorry, Steffen—not going to happen…

 STEFFEN 
I am authorized to give eine one uf your crew 1000 DVDs uf German porn
und 30 cases uf beer upon successful completion uf eine mission.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
DEAL!

They shake hands and continue walking towards the shuttles.

 EXT- DEEP SPACE- DAY 

We see the ‘Fuzzy Ship’ floating in space.

PAN CLOSE

We notice that the reason the ship looks fuzzy is because the entire surface of the ship is covered in…hair.

PAN CLOSER- we sweep over the hair covered hull of the ship, past blinking lights and sensor arrays to a porthole, where we move through into—

 INT- MAIN CHAMBER – DAY 

The main chamber is immense. A large throne like chair is in front of the camera, its back facing us.

The head of a figure seated on the throne like chair can be seen.

But the figure has immensely long hair—not only does the brown hair nearly cover the back of the chair—it covers the floor, much of the walls and even part of the ceiling.

Long strands of hair can be seen trailing off into the distance down several dark corridors that lead off from the chamber.

A large double set of metal doors slowly open.

We see nine figures enter – CARL, GENERAL TIU, HOBELHOUSE, EUIO, BLACKMAGE, REDEM, RAN EXILIS and the last one- NEK.

NEK is wearing elaborate priest-like robes of some kind.

Oddly enough—every single one of the figures are completely and totally bald. However, NEK has a single tuft of golden hair sellotaped to the front of his forehead.

 NEK 
Sire—the latest attack is progressing well.
My calculations indicate that within 48 hours,
the entire planet will be permanently affected.

 THRONE FIGURE 
Excellent. Yet another planet will soon be shown the
errors of their way. Slowly but surely everyone in the
multiverse will be shown just how wrong they are.
 (beat) 
 (dreamy far away voice) 
Yes—the fools at the university thought I was mad.
That I have taken leave of my senses with my plan.
Fools! They were incapable of seeing he sheer brilliance
of my plan! But I showed them—oh, how I did…

HOBELHOUSE coughs meaningfully but discretely.

 THRONE FIGURE 
 (annoyed voice) 
Yes—what is it?

 HOBELHOUSE 
Begging your pardon, sir but my men were wondering…

 THRONE FIGURE 
 (very annoyed) 
Yes?

 CARL 
Well—you DID promise…

 EUIO 
That is…

 BLACKMAGE 
Ummm…about our hair…?

 THRONE FIGURE 
 (impatient) 
Yes, yes! I know very well what I promised!

 NEK 
 (angry) 
You dare to imply that my master will double-cross you!

 GENERAL TIU 
 (quickly) 
Oh no—of course not!

 REDEM 
It’s just that…ummm…

 GENERAL TIU 
Well—it HAS been a while…

 RAN EXILIS 
The deal was that we replace the crew that you lost earlier
for one year and in exchange you will give us the secret
formula that will restore our hair back to its luxurious former state.

 THRONE FIGURE 
 (waving hand impatiently) 
Yes, yes! I know the deal I made! Let me assure you that
I will follow through on it right after we accomplish one last mission.
 (beat) 
Nek! Input the coordinates for the next timeline!

 NEK 
 (bowing) 
At once your Hirsuteness!
 (scampers off) 

 THRONE FIGURE 
And the rest of you—prepare another batch of the virus!

 BALD GOONS 
Right away!

They rush off.

The camera slowly swings around the throne until we finally see the face of the THRONE FIGURE.

The THRONE FIGURE is…

JUSTIN PICKARD!

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (steepling fingers) 
Excellent…

 EXT. – DEUTSCHERWELT – WELTSTAG COMPLEX – EVENING 

An establishing shot showing the Weltstag complex. We pan around and zoom in through a window into a new room, not the big central Weltstag chamber…

 INT. – WAR ROOM – DAY 

This room is large and is organised as a war room, with a big map on a table in the centre (and underlings pushing little wooden models around on it with shuffleboard sticks) , primitive 1960s computer banks beeping and flashing around the sides, and so forth.

Interestingly, the map is not of the world, nor even of space, but of a complex series of multicoloured contours, with many points marked with little flags. Each flag has a little picture of the planet Earth on it and a number.

As we watch, DOCTOR WHAT and STEFFEN enter. DOCTOR WHAT studies the map, tilting his head to one side.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
No—sorry—still can’t see it.

 STEFFEN 
It’s not a Magic Eye picture, dummkopf!

STEFFEN gestures at different points on the map.

 STEFFEN 
Zis is a multi-dimensional representation
of zer different timelines, ja? Vas invented
by Professor Von Finkelsteinenberger.
 (points at flags) 
Each Earth is marked here. Ve haff been using
it to track zer attacks off zer villains.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I see—so you have an idea of what timelines
he likes to attack? What kind of timelines?
Maybe you can predict where the next
strike will be, and we can set an ambush…

 STEFFEN 
Ja, ve had zer same idea, but ve haff been
unable to narrow it down enough.
Zere’s alvays ten or twelve to choose from,
und ve alvays pick zer wrong one.

STEFFEN looks angry, but DOCTOR WHAT looks thoughtful.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Wait—I have an idea.
 (clicks his radio) 
Leo?

 LEO CAESIUS 
 (VO) 
Yes, one who is so laughingly
titled my captain?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (ignoring this) 
I need that sensor data you got
of the virus ship, the, er…

 STEFFEN 
Ve call it “Zer Hairplane”.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
-the Hairplane, yes.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Ein – I mean, one – moment…

A few seconds later, DOCTOR WHAT’s radio beeps and lights up. He holds it up, presses a button and a hologram is projected into the air, showing a rotating cutaway picture of the ‘Hairplane’. The Germans all point and look at the advanced technology, looking impressed.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Can you use any of this?

 STEFFEN 
 (peering keenly at the hologram) 
Ja! Ja!
 (points at an item) 
Zer fuel tank here, is only quarter full!
Zat cuts down our list to only two or three
within his range!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
What if he refuels first?

 STEFFEN 
 (shakes his head) 
Not yet. Ve haff monitored his refuelling activities.
He alvays goes to zer Hub to refuel, once a month.
He is not due for another week.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Er—what? If you know he goes to the Hub
so regularly, why don’t you ambush him there?

 STEFFEN 
 (laughs bitterly) 
Dummkopf! Do you not know zat
Zer Ian hass ein policy of banning anyvon
who starts ein fight?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (slaps forehead) 
Oh yeah—sorry—forgot.

 STEFFEN 
 (turning back to hologram) 
Anyvay – next target must be von of zese three…

STEFFEN gestures at the huge complex map. One of the adjutants, NEROON, pushes most of the flags away with his shuffleboard scoop, leaving only three.

 STEFFEN 
 (pointing to each in turn) 
Zer first von is ein vorld vere zer Cuban Missile
Crisis vent hot, und zer major powers are now
zose in zer southern hemisphere.
Zer second is ein vorld zat vas enslaved by ein
Daemon posing as ein Purpledinosauren called Barney.
Zer third is ein vorld ruled by charismatic ruler
known only as Zer King…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Hey, I’ve been to all three of those timelines!

 STEFFEN 
 (looking at him) 
Really? Ve haff only heard about zem through rumour.
What can you tell me about zem?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
What do you want to know?

 STEFFEN 
Vell – we have seen zat zer villain likes
to use zer virus on vorlds viz small populations,
like zose recovering from wars und disasters.
Zat vay, zere are fewer to infect and less chance
of anyvon developing resistance.
 (pointing at the flags) 
So, zer after Cuba vorld?
Zey are recovering from ein nuclear war…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (shakes head) 
Don’t think so—that war was a hundred years ago.
They have over a billion people again now.
The Barney world still has a big population.
But the King’s world had a lot of people die
from that damned mummy’s ageing magic…

 STEFFEN 
Zen, Zer King’s vorld is zer von ve vant?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grinning) 
Bet on it.

He and STEFFEN shake hands.

Cut to –

 EXT. – SPACE – ABOVE DEUTSCHERWELT 

The AH.com ship and the German ship both break orbit and head off into space.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – BRIDGE 

As we watch, DOCTOR WHAT walks onto the bridge, followed by LUAKEL and GBW. LUAKEL stills looks shellshocked, while GBW looks thoughtful.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Got a transmission for you, Doc.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Go on.

 KABRALOTH 
 (VO, tinny) 
Good luck to both of you!
Bring the villains to justice
and get us a cure!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Will do!
 (glances around the bridge) 
Hey—where’s Michael?

 MATT 
We left him on the German ship.
You did say to break orbit as soon
as possible.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (dismissively) 
Yes, yes. So we’ve still got our
German as well?

As he speaks, the door opens and ALAYTA and LANDSHARK walk in, their arms around each others’ shoulders and each holding a bottle. LANDSHARK is, uncharacteristically, grinning and both are halfway through a drinking song.

 LANDSHARK/ALAYTA 
 (DRINKING SONG) 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Hey – what are you up to?

 LANDSHARK 
Oh, just hanging out viz mein
new best friend, ja—yeah?

DOCTOR WHAT gives him a puzzled look, then turns around.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (to himself) 
Nah—can’t be—we’re vaccinated, right?
 (to LEO) 
Put me through to the German ship.

The German ship’s bridge appear on the viewscreen.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Do you have the coordinates?

 SUSANO 
Ja! Course laid in!

 STEFFEN 
 (nodding) 
Now, at last, ve shall get zem!

DOCTOR WHAT shudders and turns away from the fury in STEFFEN’s eyes.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Meet you there.

The bridge image vanishes and is replaced with space.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Dave, engage the Shift engines!

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (VO) 
What? Look, Doc, I like the engines a lot,
but I’m not willing to go to that level of
commitment, I mean, they might expect
me to marry them next…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (loudly) 
Shift us to the King’s timeline!

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (VO; tuts) 
Well, why didn’t you say so?

DOCTOR WHAT rolls his eyes.

 EXT. – SPACE 

The German ship and the AH.com ship engage their engines within split seconds of each other, and dive off into colourful vortexes, which then vanish.

 EXT. – NEAR EARTH SPACE – DAY 

The two ships come out of the vortexes and settle into orbit.

 INT. – AH. COM SHIP – BRIDGE – DAY 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
LEO—scan for any signs of that ‘Hairplane’! And see if you can pick up any transmissions from the planet below from someone in authority. We have to warn them about the danger they may be facing and maybe we can get some help from them.

 LEO 
Scanning…
 (beat) 
No sign of the ‘Hairplane’.
 (beat) 
Hmmm…we may have a problem with getting help
from anyone on the planet below. The entire planet
seems to have been balkanized into various factions.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Factions? Over what?

 LEO 
As near as I can ascertain—which religion
of The King is the true religion.
 (beat) 
I have intercepted several evangelical TV stations that
appear to broadcasting their messages. On screen now…

The view screen changes to show a large glitzy stage. Colourful banners hang in the background and there appears to be even some kind of choir (all men wearing white jumpsuits) off to one side. A figure (HAGGIS) - dressed in a white jumpsuit as well but this one heavily bejewelled with rhinestones- is at a podium. He is wearing sunglasses and has large black sideburns. He holds a guitar in his hands. He’s in the middle of a smoking rock and roll song.

 HAGGIS 
That’s right ladies and gentlemen,
The time has come!
Time has come to talk
To that little bit of King inside of you.

Talk to it!
Call it up!
Say“King, heal me!”
“Save me, King!”
“Make me be born again
in the perfect King light”

That’s right!
You’ve got that King inside of ya
and he’s talkin to ya
He says he wants you to sing!
Everybody’s got to sing like the king!

 CHOIR 
Uh huh huh.
Uh huh huh.

 HAGGIS 
Like the King.

 CHOIR 
Uh huh huh.

 HAGGIS 
Get that leg goin’now.

 CHOIR 
Uh huh huh.

 HAGGIS 
And get your lip too.

 CHOIR 
Uh huh huh.

 HAGGIS 
Not no fool Billy Idol lip either!

 CHOIR 
Uh huh huh.

 HAGGIS 
Everybody!

 CHOIR 
Uh huh huh.

 HAGGIS 
Yeah, we’re rockin’now.

 CHOIR 
Uh huh huh.

 HAGGIS 
The King is with us.

 CHOIR 
Uh huh huh.

 HAGGIS 
He’s with us and he’s speakin’to us.
He says,“Peoples!”

 CHOIR 
Uh huh huh.

 HAGGIS 
He says,“Peoples!”

 CHOIR 
Uh huh huh.

 HAGGIS 
“Everybody!”

 CHOIR 
Uh huh huh.

 HAGGIS 
“Everybody gotta sing!”

 CHOIR 
The King is everywhere
The King is everything
The King is everybody
The King is still the king!

LEO changes the station. We now see what appears to be a comfortable looking sitting room with a leather chair, fireplace, bookshelves, etc. A man (DOETH) is sitting in the chair and smiling at the camera.

 DOETH 
And now my children, I shall read to you a passage from the most Holy Book that resonates with me.
 (opens book; starts reading) 
And The King saw them berating the poor recording artist, whose music was terrible and lyrics insipid, and Lo, the King said unto the mob:

`Let him who is without bad singles cast the first rhinestone.’

And the mob turned down their eyes, each considering his own ‘Don’t Worry Be Happy’ or ‘Man in the Mirror’, and shuffled off.

`Thank you,’said The King. `Thank you very much.’

LEO changes the station again—this time showing a dishevelled man (ADAM) in dirty jeans and a t-shirt sitting on a stool. He’s yelling at the camera, practically foaming at the mouth.

 ADAM 
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned,
I saw seven golden records; and in the midst of the seven golden records
one like unto the Son of Zeke, clothed with a jumpsuit down to the foot,
and girthed about the paunch with rhinestones. His hairs were black
like vinyl, as black as Brilcream; and his eyes, how they twinkled,
his dimples, how merry…

Who is this King of Rock-n-Roll? The Lord of Hostess, he is the King of Rock-n-Roll! Shaboom!

LEO shuts off the images.

The entire bridge crew is staring in shock at the view screen.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Ok—that has to be the thirty-sixth strangest thing I’ve ever seen.

 MATT 
Thirty-sixth?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well—okay—maybe not as strange as that planet of sentient
rutabagas we came across that one time. But definitely stranger
than that world with that alt-Othniel as a drummer for Marilyn Manson…
 (ponders for a moment) 
Maybe thirty-fifth? Thirty-fourth- tops!

 MATT 
We gotta do something! This world is about to be attacked by that
virus ship and these idiots are fighting each other for the stupidest reasons!
 (beat) 
The King will never allow this to happen on his watch.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
You think something happened to him?

 MATT 
Well—he did say that he was going to go off to find
himself and walk the Earth and all that stuff. Maybe
he just doesn’t know what’s happening?
 (beat) 
If we find him and tell him what’s happening I’m sure
he’ll kick some sense into those idiots down there—put
together a kick-ass defense at the very least. If only there
was some way we can find him…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (stroking goatee thoughtfully) 
Hmmmmm…
 (beat) 
 (snapping fingers) 
I’ve got it!
 (beat) 
Ok—this is what we do—me and Matt are going to go down dressed
as disciples of The King and infiltrate one of those churches. Once there,
we’ll use our vast intellectual and military skills to get close to the head
honcho. Once we have him alone, we’ll beam him up to the ship. Once
here, Diamond will use Torq’s biological monstrosities and Thande’s
chemical warfare devices to access the memories of the head dude and
see if we can get any useful information. The rest of the crew—all also
similarly dressed as The King’s disciples- will infiltrate the other churches
and get the leaders of those churches as well. By combining all that
information, we will be able to gain some useful information on the
location of The King. We then track down the King and bring him back
up here with all of the leaders of the churches here on the ship-we will
then be able to sit them down all together over a nice round of tea and
have the King tell them that they should join forces with us to stave off
the impending virus ship. Now that we’ve managed to bring peace to all
the religions, we can then safely put together a plan to stop
that virus ship once and for all.

Long pause.

 LEO 
Or we could use the teleporter.
 (beat) 
Use it to beam down to his current whereabouts that
I have managed to find about 30 seconds ago.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (without missing a beat) 
Or we can use Leo’s plan…
 (beat) 
OK—Matt, Sharky—come with me.

The three leave the control room.

 INT – TELEPORTER ROOM – DAY 

The three of them are standing on the teleporter platform.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
So—Leo—how did you manage to track down The King so quickly?

 LEO 
 (VO) 
There is only One King, Doc.

The three ah.commers nod their heads in sage understanding.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
So where are we beaming down to, anyway?

 LEO 
Strangely enough—the King seems to be living in an abandoned supermarket.

The three AH.commers glance at each and then shrug their shoulders.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
G.Bone—energize!

G.BONE is reading a book (A Brief History of Time) .

 G.BONE 
 (giggling under his breath) 
That Hawking—what a freak-a-saurus…
 (looks up) 
Huh? Wha? Oh—yeah—energize!
 (hits a few buttons at random) 
Okey-dokey!

The three ah.commers disappear with a popping sound.

 INT. – ABANDONED SUPERMARKET – DAY 

The three ah.commers pop into existence, DOCTOR WHAT in the middle and flanked on each side by LANDSHARK and MATT.

They look around, scanners and flashlights at the ready.

The camera pans slowly around the supermarket. The entire inside has been refurnished to look like a comfortable home—with a sofa, easy chairs, bookshelves- even a TV. Strangely enough—an ivy plant is placed on top of the TV, it’s leaves spilling down and nearly covering the TV.

The King is sitting on a chair reading a book. He glances up.

 THE KING 
What the-? My God—it’s you!

He smiles and gets up; he runs towards the three AH.commers and gives all three of them a big hug simultaneously, squishing them all together in the process.

 LANDSHARK 
Zer hair! No touching zer hair!

 MATT 
Great to see you too, King!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (gasping) 
Oxygen…becoming…an issue…

 THE KING 
 (releasing them) 
What brings you three here?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Two things in fact. One about what’s been happening
on this world since you’ve been gone—the other about
an imminent threat to this world from outside.

 THE KING 
 (confused) 
Huh? What are you talking about? What’s
been happening here while I’ve been gone?

The AH.commers glance at one another in confusion.

 MATT 
Told you that he wouldn’t have allowed this to happen if he knew.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I’m sorry King but—how can you NOT know what’s
going on there? Don’t you watch TV or anything?

 THE KING 
I don’t watch TV. It’s a cultural wasteland filled with inappropriate metaphors
and an unrealistic portrayal of life created by the liberal media elite.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grim faced) 
We’ve got some bad news to tell you, King…

MATT pulls out a machete and, with one dramatic sweep, slices through the ivy, revealing the TV screen. He then turns it on, and with a cough of static, the TV tunes in. THE KING watches in silence as MATT flips it between the different stations we saw before. A vein begins to pulsate in his forehead as he reddens with anger.

 THE KING 
 (quietly) 
All this aggravation ain’t satisfactionin’ me.

Wordlessly, THE KING pulls out a revolver and shoots the TV, which explodes in a shower of sparks. MATT leaps back with a yelp. THE KING turns to DOCTOR WHAT, a resolute expression on his face..

 THE KING 
Damn—I have been gone for far too long
 (shakes head) 
Every time I think that I’m getting old, and gradually
going to the grave, something else happens.
 (beat) 
And you mentioned a threat to my world from outside as well?

DOCTOR WHAT nods his head.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
It’s like this…

WIPE CUT TO-

A FEW MINUTES LATER

THE KING sitting in a chair, obviously in shock. He blinks a few times and shakes his head. He stands up with a determined look on his face.

 THE KING 
I’ve got some serious butt-kicking to do when I get back to civilization!
And I’ll tell you guys this—even if you fail, my people and I will fight
the virus until the very end! No way am I going to allow my people—
or any others- to go through something like that! Bring me back to Memphis—
we have a planet to save!

 MATT 
 (pumping his fist) 
YES!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (opening his comm.) 
Doc to the ship—we’ve got work to do! FOUR to beam up!

The four figures disappear with a pop.

Suddenly, a big pile of cornflake boxes stirs and a derelict, EVILMITTENS, glances around.

 EVILMITTENS 
The King has left the building.
 (throws up) 

Cut to:

 EXT. – CARIBBEAN ISLAND – DAY 

THANDE and TORQUMADA are still hard at work, mixing things, pouring things into other things, distilling things, and writing things in notebooks. As we watch, THANDE extracts some yellow liquid from a condenser, fills a syringe with it, and then injects an increasingly pissed-off looking ROBERTP6165. He’s already got green skin and an ear growing in the middle of his forehead from some of their earlier ‘efforts’.

 ROBERTP6165 
Damnyankee bastards, why I’ll-

TORQUMADA diplomatically stuffs a Confederate flag into ROBERTP6165’s mouth, shutting him up. THANDE glances at the readings on his scanner, then shakes his head sadly.

 THANDE 
Ee, chuff me, nowt.
Back ter t’tin bath, Ah suppows.

 TORQUMADA 
Boy, you say boy, you say what?
I don’ unnerstan’ a word you say, boy?

 THANDE 
Speak up, cloth-ears!

They glance at each other in mutual incomprehension and go back to their work. From a distance, the MOSQUITO and BOBO look on.

 MOSQUITO 
It’s not looking good.
The virus is going to overtake them
Before they’ll make a new cure.

 BOBO 
Bobo. Not. Let. Torqumada. Be. Harmed.

 MOSQUITO 
 (sighing) 
I’m sure you wouldn’t, but we can’t
fight a virus. We can only help them fight it.

BOBO bobs up and down, ‘nodding’.

 BOBO 
Bobo. Help. Torqumada.

BOBO glides off, fetching TORQUMADA another tray of test tubes. The MOSQUITO sighs again.

 MOSQUITO 
 (musingly) 
I wonder if there are any tasty flowers on this island…?

Cut to:

 EXT. – SPACE – THE HAIRPLANE 

We see the HAIRPLANE drifting through space.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE – MAIN CHAMBER – DAY 

The room is deserted save for JUSTIN PICKARD in the centre of his throne, illuminated by flickering candles all about. He is almost motionless, meditating, but is playing with a strand of the hair that comes from his head and chin, blending into the mass of hair throughout the ship.

As we watch, NEK enters. As before, he is wearing elaborate robes and is bald save for a single tuft of golden hair taped to his forehead.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (stirring) 
What is it, my Hirsuite Prime?

 NEK 
 (saluting) 
Your Hairiness, sir. We are ready
to attack the next system.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (acidly) 
Do not use such words, my apprentice!
We do not attack, we purge of philosophical inaccuracy and bigotry!
 (smiles beatifically, with a mad look in his eyes) 
Stereotypes are entirely false and wrong, so the only way to make things
right is to change things so that they become true!

 NEK 
 (avoiding his gaze) 
And there’s the other thing, too…

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (changes expression abruptly) 
Ah yes. To purge all traces of the heretical Goatists
from all of the multiverse…

JUSTIN PICKARD angrily picks up a candle and crushes it in his hand. The flame goes out.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (coldly) 
One day we shall have our revenge.

 NEK 
Yessir. So what is our next target?

JUSTIN PICKARD glances at a huge map of nearby space, made up of contours like the Germans’ map. He stabs a single finger at one planet. His hand is withered and has long, pointed, claw-like fingernails.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
There! The world ruled by the King of Rock an’ Roll!
 (sour expression) 
They must learn that indie music is the true path!

 NEK 
I obey, my lord!

NEK bows and retreats. JUSTIN PICKARD smiles.

 EXT. – SPACE – HAIRPLANE 

The HAIRPLANE engages its engines and dives into a colourful vortex.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – VARIOUS 

A montage of scenes showing the AH.commers and the Germans preparing for the ambush:

The AH.com ship shuttlebay – PSYCHOMELTDOWN and G.BONE fiddling with the shuttles, attaching extra weapons to their wings, while LANDSHARK wanders past, munching puzzledly on a piece of sauerkraut…

The conference room at the back of the bridge – a hologram of the Hairplane rotates above the desk and ALAYTA is pointing at different areas, then gesturing frantically at a sheaf of papers on a clipboard. GBW nods and fiddles with the controls. The hologram shifts to a simulated battle, but we see the little holograms of the AH.com ship and the German ship be destroyed almost immediately. GBW and ALAYTA shake their heads and begin pointing at the hologram all over again.

The interior of the German ship – CARLTON BACH and MAX SINISTER are welding up a crack in the bulkhead caused by the AH.com ship’s earlier attack, while MICHAEL holds a box of tools. They are all still singing raucously in German and appear either drunk or hungover.

Interior of one of the great churches we saw on the TV – ADAM, DOETH and HAGGIS are all on stage, fighting each other, as their white-suited followers in the audience also throw LP records and guitars at each other. Then, suddenly, a bright spotlight illuminates a figure at the back of the stage and, unbelieving, everyone bows down as THE KING enters, waving.

 THE KING 
Thank you. Thank you verra’ much.
 (rubs hands together) 
Right! We’ve got a job to do!
 (begins shouting orders) 
Build it up! Knock it down!
Hold it square! Roll it around!
Throw it in the air! Stick it in the ground!

 ADAM/DOETH/HAGGIS 
Sorry, what are we doing again?

THE KING angrily hits them over the head with his microphone stand.

 THE KING 
You can’t get mad – you’re just roustabouts!

Everyone cheers as the three zealots get busted back down to the same level as everyone else. The church goes into action as all THE KING’s followers begin following his orders. We then go through another short montage of THE KING’s followers, all still wearing their white suits, building what appears to be concrete underground shelters and runways. THE KING looks on, occasionally helping the work gangs out, although he’s always eating a cheeseburger with his free hand, and nods in satisfaction.

Finally, we return to the bridge of the AH.com ship…

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – BRIDGE – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT walks on, pulling his shirt. Behind him, we see DAVE HOWERY supervising a grumbling MATT and WEAPON M as, between them, they drag on a big, heavy slab of blue, rock-like material. We can see similar slabs already piled behind them, and G.BONE and PSYCHOMELTDOWN are helping to rivet them to the bridge walls.

 MATT 
 (panting) 
What’s all this about, anyway?

 DAVE HOWERY 
GBW said that LEO found
out that the Hairplane uses a special
kind of powerful energy weapon that
uses technobabblyon particles.
 (shrugs) 
Fortunately, ALAYTA happened to know that this
mineral from the German planet, Blue Schvädeschüz,
absorbs technobabblyon particles.
 (beat) 
We can use it to shield the bridge.

 WEAPON M 
 (grumbling) 
“We”, he says. Guess who’ll end up putting it up…

MATT and WEAPON M set down the slab of Blue Schvädeschüz next to the others, none too gently, and feel their backs with a wince. DAVE HOWERY clucks and examines the slabs carefully.

 DAVE HOWERY 
They have to be perfect or they won’t work!

 MATT 
Yeah, yeah – whatever…

In the foreground, DOCTOR WHAT nods to GBW, who’s at the comm system.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Get me planetary defence command…

GBW presses some buttons. THE KING appears on the screen, surrounded by his followers. They are all still wearing their white suits but they have now painted camouflage patterns on top of them.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Your Majesty! Are you prepared like we asked?

 THE KING 
Sure and more, uhuhuh.
We built those shelters so as many of our
people will be protected. But we want to do more…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Really—I don’t think there’s anything—

DOCTOR WHAT’s voice trails off and the camera pulls back to reveal that THE KING is standing next to an F-16 fighter, with other FOLLOWERS refueling and rearming it. Around it are several other fighters.

MATT and WEAPON M are so surprised at this that they both take a step backwards onto DAVE HOWERY’s armour slabs.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (enraged) 
DON’T STEP ON MY BLUE SCHVÄDESCHÜZ!!

 THE KING 
 (glancing up) 
Nice! I might use that.
 (to DOCTOR WHAT, seriously) 
We might not be able to do much,
but we’ll do what we can.
 (grimly) 
We’ll give this virus guy a bloody nose.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (clearly overcome) 
Well, I…

 THE KING 
 (winks) 
See you at the Heartbreak Motel, my friend.

THE KING starts humming ‘G.I. Blues’ and the transmission cuts off. DOCTOR WHAT stares at the screen for a few moments.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Wow. He really IS the King.
 (shakes his head) 
OK—put me through to the Germans.

STEFFEN appears on the screen. In the background, we can see MICHAEL, wearing a spiked WW1 helmet, playing a furious game of table football with CARLTON BACH.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
You’re ready?

 STEFFEN 
 (grimly) 
As ve’ll ever be.
Ve’ve protected our bridge viz Blue Schvädeschüz as vell.
But our weapons aren’t as advanced as yours.
If ve’re going to haff a chance at taking him on…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Right—we’ll be at the front.

 MATT 
 (grumbling) 
As always…

STEFFEN is about to open his mouth to respond, but in the background, we see MICHAEL suddenly spin the ball through all CARLTON BACH’s players and into the goal. Grinning, MICHAEL grabs a box of spare figurines and tips them over the table.

 MICHAEL 
Some people are on the pitch!
They think it’s all over!
 It is now! 

CARLTON BACH looks up with a vengeful look in his eyes, but then his console starts to beep. He glances down and pales.

 CARLTON BACH 
Sir, we’ve detected a vortex. Something is emerging…

DOCTOR WHAT glances at GBW, who nods.

 GBW 
 (quietly) 
It’s the Hairplane.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (addressing everyone) 
OK—this is it, people. Either we win,
or another planet falls to the virus and
they all become mindless stereotypes.
 (grimly) 
This world has already been almost destroyed once.
I’m not going to let it happen again.

The AH.commers and Germans nod and make sounds of assent.

 SUSANO 
Ve vill kick zeir schweinhund arses!

 STEFFEN 
 (nodding) 
Ja. Zis time he vill be brought to justice.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Good luck everyone. Screen off.

GBW complies, and DOCTOR WHAT sits in his captain’s seat.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Let’s roll.

 EXT. – SPACE – DAY 

The Hairplane shoots out of the vortex and flies towards the Earth.

As it nears the Earth—both the AH.Com and German ship appear in view.

The AH.Com ship fires a barrage of missiles at the Hairplane.

 EXT. – DIFFERENT VIEW – SPACE 

We see the missiles fly towards the Hairplane. The Hairplane suddenly makes some frantic evasive maneuvers.

We see the missiles fly right by the Hairplane—missing it by mere feet—and fly off into space.

The German ship swings into view and fires a barrage of particle beams at the Hairplane as the AH.Com fires a barrage of both missiles and particle beams at the Hairplane.

The Hairplane’s shields sparkle spectacularly as the barrage of the weapons fire from the two ships slams into it.

CLOSE- UP

Three large gun barrels erupting out of the hull of the Hairplane.

The Hairplane fires three large glowing green ‘balls of energy’ from the guns—they head straight towards the German ship.

CLOSE-UP

The German ship frantically tries to dodge. One…then two…of the green glowing balls miss the German ship.

But the third slams into the German ship with a fantastic explosion of energy. Long green tendrils – like lightning bolts – spray out along the entire hull of the German ship, its shields sparkling and sputtering.

The lights on the German ship suddenly go black and the German ship’s engines sputter to a stop –momentum being the only thing making the ship move.

We see the Hairplane’s guns begin to charge up again and fire three more ‘green glowing balls’ at the German ship.

 EXT. – DIFFERENT VIEW OF SPACE – DAY 

We see the three glowing balls head straight towards the now helpless ship. Mere seconds before they impact, we see –

—the AH.Com ship fly directly into their path!

The three balls explode, spreading tendrils of green energy all along the ship’s hull. For just the briefest of moments, the ship’s power cuts off—-but just as quickly, it’s restored.

 INT. – AH.COM BRIDGE – DAY 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Nice job Sharky!

 LANDSHARK 
Ja! I am zer bestest pilot of all!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (gives LANDSHARK a funny look, but shrugs) 
Matt! Blast that fucking ship with everything we have!

 MATT 
Ja! I mean— Hee-Haw!!

 EXT. – SPACE – DAY 

The AH.Com ship fires a barrage of weapons and missiles at the Hairplane. The Hairplane manages to dodge and weave out of the way of most—but not all—of the weapons. Some of them slam into the Hairplane’s shields, making them sparkle.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

We see JUSTIN PICKARD, a look of pure fury on his face.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
DESTROY THAT SHIP!!

The BALD GOONS, sitting at various hair-covered consoles, nod and begin frantically pushing buttons.

 EXT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

The Hairplane fires three more green balls at the AH.Com ship.

 INT. – AH. COM BRIDGE – DAY 

The view screen shows the Hairplane firing.

 MATT 
Here they come!

 EXT. – AH.COM SHIP – DAY 

The three green energy balls slams into the shields of the AH.Com ship. The power once again flickers off and on for a few seconds—and then, with a final flicker, turns off completely.

The AH.Com ship lies motionless in space, completely exposed.

 INT. – AH. COM BRIDGE – DAY 

Emergency lights are on while everyone on the bridge are frantically flipping switches, pushing buttons, etc.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (pressing button on armrest) 
DAVE! I need main power back for us to do the next part of our plan!

 INT. – AH.COM ENGINEERING – DAY 

DAVE HOWERY is talking on an intercom. Behind him we see PSYCHOMELTDOWN and DMA working frantically.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Those technobabblyon weapons have screwed up
our systems, but the Blue Schvädeschüz has restricted the damage.
 (DMA holds up his hand, HOWERY nods) 
I can get you full power within 30 seconds!

Behind him, we see PSYCHOMELTDOWN grasp a huge cable and plug it into an outlet. There is a massive spark of electricity and PSYCHOMELTDOWN is catapulted 20 feet backwards into a bulkhead and collapses to the floor. He slowly staggers up, his clothes smoking, his face covered in burn marks and his hair now a gigantic afro. He stands up for a few more seconds and then collapses face down onto the floor again, his limbs twitching in a rather unhealthy manner. We see DAVE glance back and then turn back to the intercom.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Better make that 45 seconds!

 INT. – AH. COM BRIDGE – DAY 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Matt?

 MATT 
We may not have 45 seconds!
 (points at view screen) 

The Hairplane is approaching the AH.COM at frighteningly fast speeds, its weapons charging up again.

 EXT. – AH. COM SHIP – DAY 

The Hairplane approaches the AH.Com ship and fires another barrage of energy balls at them.

CLOSE –ON

The three green glowing balls heading straight towards the unprotected ah.com ship.

Seconds before they impact, we see flying in front of the ah.com ship –

—the German ship!

 INT. – GERMAN SHIP BRIDGE – DAY 

 STEFFEN 
Brace fur zer Impakt!

 EXT. – GERMAN SHIP – DAY 

The three green glowing balls impact on the German ship, shutting down its power again.

 EXT. –SPACE –DAY 

The Hairplane narrowly flies out of the way of the drifting German ship and continues flying towards the AH.Com ship—and the Earth.

It charges up its weapons again.

Just as it is about to fire—

—several missiles streak in from behind and impact on the rear of the Hairplane!

The Hairplane flies out of control for a few seconds, its shields down…

 INT. – AH. COM BRIDGE – DAY 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Alright! Your idea worked GBW! Those bastards forgot all about
those missiles we fired before and never knew what hit them!
 (beat) 
How are the Germans doing?

 MATT 
They should have full power up in a minute or so. Thank God
that Blue Schvädeschüz managed to absorb the bulk of the
technobabble energy—they would have been well and
truly screwed without it.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Speaking of being totally screwed—how are WE doing?

 MATT 
Main power up in less than ten seconds!
 (glances at some screens) 
The Virus ship should have its shields
up in less than twenty seconds!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
We’re going to cut this close
 (hits comm. button) 
Teleporter Room! Get ready to send over the team
the second the power comes back up!

 INT. – TELEPORTER ROOM – DAY 

We see FLOCCULENCIO, WEAPON M, IRONYUPPIE, ALAYTA and DIAMOND on the teleporter pads, all carrying BFGs.

G. BONE is lounging in an easy chair, looking at an Archie comic book that he’s holding upside down.

 G. BONE 
 (distractedly) 
Whoa—freaky—it finally makes sense…
 (hits comm. button while still staring at the comic book) 
Will do, Doc!

 EXT. – AH.COM SHIP – DAY 

The main power comes back on and we see lights, weapons, shields, etc slowly being activated all over the ship.

 INT. – TELEPORTER ROOM – DAY 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (VO) 
NOW!

G.BONE hits a few buttons and the five crewmembers disappear with a pop. He goes back to his Archie comic book.

 G.BONE 
Mmmmm—Betty is one major babe-licious hottie!

 INT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

The five appear with a popping sound and fan out, running down a hair-lined corridor with their weapons drawn. FLOCCULENCIO gives the ever-present hair a concerned, distant look, as though struggling to remember something, but then shrugs and follows the others.

 EXT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

The Hairplane flies towards the Earth, the AH.Com ship struggling to catch up behind it. We see, off in the distance, the German ship slowly powering up.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE THRONE ROOM– DAY 

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Time to Virus release?!

 RAN EXILIS 
Two minutes, sire!

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
What about those idiots in orbit?

 RAN EXILIS 
The ship registered as AH.COM
will not be able to intercept us for
two minutes and twenty seconds.
The German ship is a full four
minutes from intercepting us.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Excellent.
 (presses a button on his armrest) 

A view screen comes down from the ceiling. It crackles with static for a second to reveal NEK, standing at attention.

 NEK 
Your Hairiness!

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Another moment of triumph is upon us, Hirsute Prime!

 NEK 
I shall not fail you -

 INT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

We see the ALAYTA and the AH.commers walking down a corridor. They turn a corner to see NEK, speaking to a view screen. On the view screen, in full view, is JUSTIN PICKARD.

 NEK 
—not fail you, my Villousness.

JUSTIN PICKARD suddenly glances up and sees the AH.commers, gasping in shock. NEK, seeing JUSTIN’s expression turns around—and sees FLOCCULENCIO.

 NEK 
 (eyes widening in shock) 
You?

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (enraged) 
You!

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (glancing at both NEK and JUSTIN PICKARD; his eyes burn red) 
GAAAA-AAAAAARGH!!!

FLOCCULENCIO fires a blast from his BFG at the viewscreen, shattering it and spraying debris everywhere. NEK yelps and ducks out of the way. He looks up to see FLOCCULENCIO charging at him, totally enraged beyond all semblance of sanity.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
DIE HERETIC!

The two collapse in a heap, FLOCCULENCIO mercilessly punching NEK as ALAYTA and the AH.commers try to separate the two.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE THRONE ROOM– DAY 

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (turning to face RAN EXILIS, enraged) 
The Foul One himself is here! Destroy him at once!

RAN EXILIS presses a button, setting off a ship wide alarm.

 EXT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

The Hairplane enters the Earth’s atmosphere, the AH.Com ship close behind it.

 INT. – AH.COM BRIDGE – DAY 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Faster! We need more speed!

 MATT 
Any faster and the engines will fly apart!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grimly) 
Then let them fly apart!

 EXT. – AH.COM SHIP –DAY 

The ship gives a little bit of extra speed and enters the Earth’s atmosphere after the Hairplane.

 EXT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

The Hairplane is flying over a landscape and begins to slow down.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE THRONE ROOM –DAY 

 RAN EXILIS 
Preparing for virus release, Sire!
 (beat) 
Sire?

RAN EXILIS looks up from his console to see JUSTIN PICKARD sitting on his chair, his face an angry red color.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (shaking head and muttering under his breath) 
He’s here…he’s actually here…
 (beat; glances up and seems to hear RAN EXILIS for the first time) 
Release the virus! Now!

 RAN EXILIS 
Dropping shields now—releasing the virus bomb in five seconds. Five, four…

 INT. – HAIRPLANE –DAY 

We see a bomb-bay door slowly begin to slide open.

Suddenly—a missile streaks into view and slams into the bomb-bay door, raising a small fireball and jamming the door before it can fully open!

 INT. – HAIRPLANE THRONE ROOM –DAY 

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (glancing up in shock) 
What?! What’s going on?!

 EXT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

We see flying towards the camera—-

—six F-16 fighter jets!

The lead F-16 is piloted by—

THE KING!

CLOSE- UP

 THE KING 
IT’S ASS KICKING TIME!!!

The six F-16s each launch a missile.

REVERSE SHOT

We see six missiles streak towards the Hairplane—-and explode on its hull, sending ripples of flames and debris along its entire length!

The hair itself begins to burn.

 INT. – HAIRPLANE THRONE ROOM –DAY 

The ship is a mess—alarms are going off, emergency lights are flickering off and on, smoke and a few flames can be seen here and there

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
RELEASE THE BOMB!

 RAN EXILIS 
We can’t sire! The bomb bay doors are not functioning!
 (beat) 
Sire! We have multiple hull breaches! We must shift immediately and return to the Hub for repairs!

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (still apparently in shock) 
Yes…yes—we must escape…

 EXT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

The Hairplane puts on a burst of speed and changes course, flying straight upwards and leaving the F-16s behind.

 EXT- EARTH ORBIT –DAY 

We see the Hairplane streak away from Earth.

Close behind it—and catching quickly up—the AH.Com ship.

 INT. -AH.COM SHIP BRIDGE –DAY 

 MATT 
They’re getting ready to open up another vortex!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Can we shoot them?

 MATT 
They won’t be in range for another thirty seconds!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
What about the guys we sent over?

 INT. – HAIRPLANE –DAY 

Alarms are going off and the whole ship is shaking but FLOCCULENCIO is completely unconcerned as he is too busy trying to strangle NEK.

WEAPON M is trying – with limited success – to pull him off.

 WEAPON M 
Dude—we need him alive when we teleport off this ship.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (finally manages some semblance of sanity) 
But I can hurt him? Hurt him a lot? Right?

 WEAPON M 
 (shrugging shoulders) 
Sure thing.

Both WEAPON M and FLOCCULENCIO start kicking NEK. ALAYTA joins in a few seconds later. IRONYUPPIE and DIAMOND glance at one another, shrug their shoulders and join in as well.

There is a shimmer of sparkling light and all of them—including NEK—disappear with a loud popping sound.

 EXT. – HAIRPLANE – DAY 

A vortex opens up and the Hairplane enters it. The vortex closes a few seconds later before either the AH.com or the German ship can enter it.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – BRIDGE – DAY 

The image of the closing vortex is visible on the main screen and several secondaries. DOCTOR WHAT slams down his fist.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
DAMMIT!
 (glances at ceiling) 
Leo, did you get their vector?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Sorry. Those technobabbylon weapons
have messed up my navigational sensors.
 (beat) 
Also, I seem to have some corrupted data
in my navicomputer memory banks…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (impatiently) 
Yeah, whatever, that can wait.
Matt, get me the Germans.

MATT nods and STEFFEN’s image appears on the main screen. The German bridge is even more beat up than the AH.com ship’s. As we watch, CARLTON BACH uses a fire extinguisher to put out a burning console. MICHAEL opens up another, sparking console. He uses the spark to light a cigar, then puts a spanner inside and twists, turning off the damaged console, and stands back, puffing the cigar.

 STEFFEN 
 (to DOCTOR WHAT, enraged) 
Zey got avay!

 SUSANO 
Again!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (grimly) 
I know. At least we managed to damage them.

 STEFFEN 
 (shaking his head) 
Ja, ist somezing, but…

 MATT 
 (interrupting) 
Wait.

DOCTOR WHAT turns in surprise.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well? What is it?

 MATT 
 (listening to his earpiece) 
Report from G.Bone…
Two things: apparently Betty is a smokin’ hottie,
whatever that means, and our team managed to
beam back just before the virus ship entered the vortex.
 (beat) 
They have a prisoner.

DOCTOR WHAT exchanges a glance with STEFFEN.

 STEFFEN 
 (thoughtfully) 
Vell, zis is [u]different…[/u]

 SUSANO 
Ja, now ve may haff a vay to know
vere he vill strike next!

 STEFFEN 
 (shaking his head) 
Nein, after zat damage, he vill
return to zer Hub for repairs.
After zat, maybe, zough…

 SUSANO 
 (angrily) 
If only ve could ambush zem [u]at[/u] zer Hub!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Look, Deutsch dudes, you really don’t want to
get Ian angry—trust me on this.
 (shudders with the memory, then looks thoughtful) 
Although…even if we can’t ambush them,
maybe we can do something else…
 (glances up) 
I’ll get back to you. Good luck with your repairs.

 STEFFEN 
Ja, und you.

STEFFEN’s image vanishes. DOCTOR WHAT glances at the bridge crew.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
OK—get that prisoner locked up and then we’ll see
about questioning him. And Kit needs to see me in an hour.

 MATT 
 (shocked) 
You’re not going to let him do the interrogation!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I’m not a monster!
 (shakes his head) 
No, I have another task for him.

 MATT 
OK, so what are you doing now,
going to look at the damage?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
No, Dave can handle it.
I’m off to make our thanks…

 EXT. – NEVADA – DESERT AIRFIELD – NIGHT 

The AH.com shuttle ‘Halle Berry’ lands on a contemporary airfield that is otherwise covered with various U.S. fighter planes of the 1980s. It is local night but the airfield is brightly lit, and there are fireworks going off in the background, throwing flashes of light across the whole desert. In front of the aircraft hangars, we can see a group of white-suited pilots and mechanics cheering and partying to ‘Viva Las Vegas’, while the planes themselves have been pimped with lights and decorations.

DOCTOR WHAT gets out of the shuttle and goes to the edge of the airfield, where a lone figure is watching the fireworks and celebrations from a distance.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Hey, Your Majesty?

 THE KING 
 (turning) 
Hey. How did it go?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (shaking his head) 
Our ships were damaged, and
that virus ship managed to escape.
But like you said, we gave them a bloody nose.
 (looks at THE KING with respect) 
They’d still have managed to do it if
it hadn’t been for your fighters.

 THE KING 
 (waving him away) 
Hey, we’d have been toast without
your warning and help, uhuhuh.
 (gazing off into the darkness) 
I wish I could come and help you
take down those bastards for good.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Nah, I can’t ask you to leave your people.

 THE KING 
 (nodding, restless expression) 
I’m all shook up. But I know they’d
fall into bad ways again if I left them.
 (shakes his head, but fondly, at the celebrating people) 
One day I won’t be able to come back and save them.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
But you’re THE KING!

 THE KING 
 (nodding) 
Yeah, but everyone has their time.
 (sighs) 
Well, enough of these blues.
Good luck with your hunt, and don’t be a stranger.
Drop me a line if you ever need help again.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nodding) 
Thank you. Thank you very much.

 THE KING 
 (laughing) 
Hey, that’s my line!

DOCTOR WHAT laughs as well, and then walks back to the shuttle, shaking his head. THE KING watches him go, then turns back to the celebrations. After a while, he grins to himself.

 THE KING 
Hey, no man is an island, though if I keep eating these
cheeseburgers and then go for a swim, I might come close.
 (raises hand to lips) 
Hey, you guys! Make way for the King!

THE KING jumps atop one of the planes and begins playing his guitar.

 THE KING 
 (singing) 
Saturday night, the world’s got saved,
We’ve fooled around with planes and we don’t even get paid,
My heartbeat’s going half the time
but this Saturday night, baby, I feel fine!

The shuttle roars overhead, leaving a trail of fire in the sky as the fireworks go off, and THE KING salutes it.

 THE KING 
 (still singing) 
We’re gonna rock it up,
we’re gonna rip it up,
we’re gonna shake it up,
we’re gonna ball it up,
We’re gonna rock it up,
have a ball tonight!

THE KING dives into the crowd, everyone cheering. Fade to-

 EXT. – SPACE – THE HAIRPLANE 

A brooding JUSTIN PICKARD sits on his throne, while RAN EXILIS and the other BALD GOONS hastily make repairs to the damaged consoles. RAN EXILIS, looking nervous, goes up to JUSTIN PICKARD.

 RAN EXILIS 
My lord…

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (to himself) 
Him. After all this time. Here.
How can it be?
How can…he have?
 (shakes his head) 
Yes? What is it, my servant?

 RAN EXILIS 
 (licking his lips) 
The emergency shift burned out our
engines, but they should be repaired within
an hour. We can then Shift to the Hub for repairs.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (steepling his fingers) 
Good. We must repair the bomb bay doors immediately!
Our crusade cannot be impeded!
 (scowls) 
Where is my Hirsuite Prime?

 RAN EXILIS 
 (glancing nervously at the other BALD GOONS) 
My lord…we believe that… they took him.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (slowly) 
They…they who were with the…Foul One?
 (eyes go red with anger) 
They took my Hirsuite Prime, my apprentice?!

 RAN EXILIS 
Yes, my lord.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (softly) 
He shall be avenged.
 
JUSTIN PICKARD reaches into his pocket and pulls out a new tuft of golden hair, which he tosses to a surprised RAN EXILIS.
 
 JUSTIN PICKARD 
You are the new Hirsuite Prime.

 RAN EXILIS 
 (surprised, overcome) 
Yes, Your Hairiness!

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (staring into the middle distance) 
Which means we have further business at the Hub.
We have…a vacancy…

Cut to:

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – DARKENED ROOM 

DOCTOR WHAT enters the back of what appears to be one of TORQUMADA’s med-bays, but the lights are off. WEAPON M stands guard at the door.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
He’s in there?

WEAPON M nods.

DOCTOR WHAT goes in. We follow his POV – the room is almost totally dark but lit by the light spilling in from the air vents. Dimly, we can see two figures tied to chairs.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (surprised) 
I thought you said there was only one prisoner.

 WEAPON M 
Yeah…there was.

WEAPON M turns on a spotlight and the room is illuminated. DOCTOR WHAT takes a step back in surprise and revulsion. The two figures in the chairs are facing each other, straining at their bindings, and biting at the gags in their mouths. Their eyes are glowing red with anger and steam is virtually pouring from their ears.

They are NEK, and FLOCCULENCIO.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Flocc? Flocc, explain yourself!

DOCTOR WHAT yanks the gag out of FLOCCULENCIO’s mouth.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (in a sudden rush) 
Let me at him, let me at him!
Let the righteous horns of the Goat
gore through his black heart and-

DOCTOR WHAT pulls out NEK’s gag as well and he immediately begins shouting as well.

 NEK 
Foul one! You shall soon taste the bitter taint
of the holy virus of the Studenty-Haired One-

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (even more enraged) 
You shall not mention the name of the
Great Satan in my presence!

 NEK 
JUSTIN PICKARD!

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (blows completely) 
GA-AAAARGH!

Suddenly, with the strength of a madman, FLOCCULENCIO rips through his bonds and leaps out of the chair, pushing DOCTOR WHAT aside and going towards the still-bound NEK. He yanks his bottle of Satanic Appletini out of his pocket and reverses it in his hand.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
I’ll bash your impure brains out, Lesser Satan!

FLOCCULENCIO takes a swing with the bottle, but as it’s upside down, there’s no cork and it magically refills, a continuous torrent of Appletini pours out and pools at his feet, with the result that his anchor foot slips, he overbalances and thuds to the floor, knocking himself out on one of the legs of NEK’s chair. NEK tries to spit on his body, but misses. The Appletini continues to pool around FLOCC until DOCTOR WHAT hastily sets the bottle upright.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Jeez, he always seemed like one of the
more sane—uh, I mean, less noticeably insane—
members of this crew.

 WEAPON M 
Must be all that curry.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (nodding) 
Yeah.
 (to NEK) 
OK, you virus-bombing bozo, we want some answers!

 NEK 
 (acidly) 
I’ll never talk!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (puts hands on hips) 
Oh really. Then maybe we should just
leave, and wait for our friend FLOCC
to recover…and let him persuade you.

 NEK 
 (licking his lips in defiance) 
I would die for the Hairy One!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (sighing) 
OK then it’ll have to be a fate worse than death.
 (opens his communicator) 
Erikka? Yes? Put Landie down for a moment,
oh, I’m sure he can survive being impaled on that
bed of nails for a few hours, yes, and we have a new toy for you…

TIME LAPSE –

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CORRIDOR 

To a cacophony distant, echoing screams, DOCTOR WHAT and the others walk down the corridor.

 WEAPON M 
So this Pickard guy recruits bald guys
to be his goons?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Seems so. Which gives me an idea…

A door opens and KIT comes out, smirking to himself about something or other as usual.

 KIT 
You wanted to see me, Doc?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
That’s right. I have a little job for you..

 KIT 
Well, Doc, I’m glad to see that you’ve finally
stopped lying to yourself and are prepared to
embrace the world of man-on-man action…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (patiently) 
Not that, you Welsh goit!

 KIT 
 (disappointed) 
Oh.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (into his communicator) 
Dave? What’s our ETA for the Hub?

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – ENGINEERING – DAY 

A big panel on the side of one of the main engine sections is open and DAVE HOWERY is doing something vigorous with a very big tool, resulting in clouds of soot flying out and blackening everything. HOWERY pauses for a moment to answer the comm.

 DAVE HOWERY 
We’re still not 100%, Doc,
but we’re Shift-capable.
We can Shift to the Hub now.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (VO) 
Yeah, Steffen says the same.
Good work, Dave.

DAVE HOWERY puts down the comm and then pulls out the tool to reveal that it is, in fact, the still-frozen-electrocuted-with-afro-hair PSYCHOMELTDOWN, who he is using as a chimney sweep brush. HOWERY casually leans the rigid PSYCHOMELTDOWN against a console and then goes over to the side of the engine, yanking down on a huge lever. The tone of the engines changes as the ship enters the vortex.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (surveying the engine bay) 
Good, now what…
 (looks at the rigid PSYCHO-brush thoughtfully) 
Hmm, the toilet in my quarters needs unblocking…

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CORRIDOR 

As before. DOCTOR WHAT puts his comm away.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
So you’d better get ready, Kit.

 KIT 
 (confused) 
But you haven’t said what you want me to do.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Oh, yeah. Well, it’s like this – you know that…
friend of yours you met in the Hub?

Fade to black

 INT. – HUB – OUROBOROS – DAY 

The camera pans slowly over, showing that this part of the Pub is dark and rather dingy. The camera stops on one table, showing two figures sitting close to each other deep in conversation. We notice that one of them is KIT—but the other one is unfamiliar…

Oddly enough, the mystery figure is wearing an extremely colourful British Admiral costume (circa 19th century) , with a heavy emphasis on gold lame, red chiffon and numerous medals and ribbons. This is FELLATIO NELSON

 KIT 
…and that’s our dilemma. We desperately need a favour. You think you can help us?

 FELLATIO NELSON 
A perplexing dilemma to be sure.
 (beat) 
This requires the full resources of my capabilities thrusting into action.

 KIT 
Indeed. But do you think you are fully up to it completely?
 (beat) 
Perhaps you may need a hand or two to assist you?

 FELLATIO NELSON 
I daresay that I am fully capable of having the situation well
in hand on my own but rest assured that if I am in need of any
assistance, your name will be on my lips in a moment.

 KIT 
Ah—I feel such a shudder of warmth hearing that.
 (beat) 
Although I am worried about what assistance little
old me can offer. There are very few skills I can offer.

 FELLATIO NELSON 
Tut, tut! There are all kinds of things I can teach you!

 KIT 
Really? I’m intrigued. Rest assured that I am a fast learner and
can pick up things rather quickly. Indeed—I daresay that there
may be a point where I may be able to reciprocate and teach
you some special skills I’ve picked up in my travels.

 FELLATIO NELSON 
Indeed—but I must emphasize that in all teaching situations
it is important to remember that I’m the one in full control
and my students must follow my instructions explicitly
and without fail. Know what I mean?

 KIT 
 (nodding head) 
Right—you’re on top.
 (beat) 
But back to our dilemma. Do you have a cunning plan?

 FELLATIO NELSON 
Indeed—the formation of a most fascinating
notion is beginning to rise within me.

 KIT 
 (smiling) 
Looking forward to seeing the full glory of that in action.

 FELLATIO NELSON 
If I may blow my own horn for a moment—I daresay
it will be most impressive once it explodes into action.
 (beat) 
Although I must be careful of such things—
such thoughts cause my ego to swell.

 KIT 
 (nodding) 
Ay— but proudly I hope?

 FELLATIO NELSON 
Beyond belief…

 KIT 
Indeed.

 FELLATIO NELSON 
 (standing up) 
Now if you will excuse me—I must make certain enquires and
contact certain…uh…‘friends’ of mine to facilitate the rest of
my plan. I shall be in contact with you within twenty minutes.

 KIT 
I will be all a-quiver with anticipation on thoughts of your plans…

 FELLATIO NELSON 
Indeed. Many people often do.

FELLATIO NELSON walks away.

 KIT 
 (pulling out comm.) 
Doc? Good news! He’s going to help us!
More details for you in about half an hour…

KIT lights up a cigarette and leans back into his chair contently.

 TEASER 



 
 

 INT. – IP.NET SHIP– DAY 

MIKE COLLINS and STRAHA are facing each other; STRAHA is trying not to tremble while the First of the Fallen is glaring at him, his face a mixture of rage and…well, even more rage. The remains of various torture devices are scattered around the room.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Now tell me, where did you put it?

 STRAHA 
Uh.. I don’t have it. I said that already…

MIKE COLLINS pulls out a device, points it at STRAHA, and triggers it. There is a terrible noise, during which STRAHA screams and falls to the ground, wrapped in a glowing field of light. The light fades, revealing… .

 STRAHA 
You gave me boobs!

And indeed, STRAHA is sporting a pair of double-D sized breasts.

 MIKE COLLINS 
This was invented in a timeline where
Bush III launched Operation Feminise
against Afghanistan, rather than Operation
Smash the Bastards. Instead of nuking
them, Bush III turned them all into women
and then sent in the Marines…”

MIKE COLLINS laughs uproariously. It’s clear that he considers this the height of humour. STRAHA is much less amused.

 STRAHA 
 (Small voice) 
No nukes?

 MIKE COLLINS 
None whatsoever.
Now… where did you put the plans?
Tell me or I’ll have to invert your nuts.

STRAHA covers his love globes with one hand.

 STRAHA 
You can’t take my balls! How
will I ever get laid again?

 MIKE COLLINS 
 (Snorts) 
Again? Was there ever a first time?

STRAHA looks embarrassed.

 MIKE COLLINS 
In any case, my crew and I have been growing
desperate; it seems that GIRLS GO FISHING
wasn’t quite the hottie it seemed when we
answered her personal ad…And I’m sure
that you would make a more than adequate
substitute.
 (pause) 
They tell me that KADYET has quite an
interesting line in extreme unction…

 STRAHA 
I’ll talk, I’ll talk…
 (digs in pocket and pulls out a disc) 
Here. Have the damn thing.

MIKE COLLINS picks up the disc, grinning.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Now all the power shall be mine.

 STRAHA 
Good luck with it, buddy. The reason I couldn’t
sell it was because its got one major catch to it.
When it’s powered up, it allows you to alter reality
and when fully powered it will be powerful enough
to defeat Ian. But the weapon requires a certain
energy. Energy that can only be produced by the
creativity and imagination of a writer.

 MIKE COLLINS 
I think I’m on the verge of spotting the
flaw in this little plan. I cannot write!
 (pause) 
And you I imagine are illiterate.
 (glares) 
Then this has all been for naught!

MIKE COLLINS lifts the feminiser and points it at STRAHA’s groin… .

 STRAHA 
 (Desperately) 
All you have to do is find a Certified
Writing Machine and have him
produce the energy for you.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Fine, we’ll find a writing machine.
 (dramatic pause) 
And then we will destroy Ian
and rule all of the Multiverse!

 STRAHA 
Yes, destroy Ian.
Punish him with fire!

 MIKE COLLINS 
Did I say that you could talk?

 ACT I 




 
 

 INT. – ROOM – NIGHT 

 NARRATOR 
This great episode will feature the amazingly
handsome and creature Chris who has blonde
hair and blue eyes. Did I mention that it would
feature the amazingly handsome and creature
Chris who has blonde hair and blue eyes. Oh,
I forgot to tell you that it will feature the amazingly
handsome and creature Chris who has blonde
hair and blue eyes. Just in case you missed it
in the last thirty books, it will feature the amazingly
handsome and creature Chris who has blonde
hair and blue eyes. And it’s a new book, so it
will feature the…

Massive burst of gunfire!

 AUDIENCE 
For the FINAL time, Harry, repetition is
annoying! Your readers are not stupid!

 TURTLEDOVE (for it is he) 
They read my books, don’t they?

Long agonising pause.

 TURTLEDOVE 
All right, I’ll leave you to the adventures
of the amazingly handsome and creature
Chris who has blonde hair and blue eyes….

More gunfire!

 INT; AH.COM SHIP. – LOUNGE – NIGHT 

 WEAPON M 
Man, I can’t get enough of this show,
where they shoot famous authors just
for having boring characters.
 (eyes THANDE) .
Hey, THANDE; have you ever thought
of going on a show like that?

The show changes, to reveal HARRY HARRISON being chased across the stage by a score of LANDSHARK ALTs, all carrying British flags and images of Queen Victoria.

 THANDE 
Twenty Gazillion points from Pornwatcher.

 WEAPON M 
What the fuck?

 THANDE 
 (embarrassed) 
Never mind; I’ll just drop something in
your drink…or perhaps I already have…

WEAPON M drops his drink sharply. THANDE smirks

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Clean that mess up!

 WEAPON M 
Make me, Canuck boy!

DOCTOR WHAT glares at him.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Are you channelling DAVE HOWERY or something?
Next you’ll be talking about invading Canada!
 (WEAPON M looks pale) 
Clean that mess up!

 WEAPON M 
It was all THANDE’s fault

 EVERYONE 
BLAME THANDE!

THANDE is not happy.

 THANDE 
One day, I will show you all the light of my true greatness and…

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (to LANDSHARK) 
He’s been drinking his own inventions again.

 THANDE 
 (Ignoring her) 
I will show you just what it means to be THANDE!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Yeah, right; now, clean that mess up!

 LEO 
THANDE, you might have a chance to show us all
what you might be…oh, and help us with our finances as well.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
And just what did we spend the money on this time?

The camera pans around LEO’s lair, where his robot body rubs artefacts from a dozen Mandeanwank timelines .

 LEO 
Never mind that now. The point is…

The display screen clicks off the ‘GIVE YOUR AUTHORS WHAT FOR SHOW’ – much to some of the crew’s disgust – and turns to a personal ad, advising Nigerian whores and asking for money. Moments later, it changes again, to a different ad.

 LEO 
I picked this up a week ago…

The display shows a girl who is very obviously STRAHA in drag, except it’s not drag, OK? For some reason, none of the crew notice this, not least because it would be difficult to fly the ship if everyone had stabbed their eyes with forks.

 STRAHA 
Are you a writer? Do you want to win fame
and fortune? If so, come to the HOTEL SPEND IT
and…write! The winner of the competition will
be rewarded with ten thousand gold Hub credits…

The crew look at each other in astonishment…and greed.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
THANDE, do you remember those five thousand
Hub credits I loaned you back when you were looking
for the ingredients to make radioactive chloroform…?

 STRAHA 
And even greater rewards.
 (Shakes breasts) 
Come to the HOTEL…write, and be
part of the greatest thing the Multiverse
has ever seen! MWAHAHAHAHAHA!

The image vanishes

 THANDE 
I’ll do it! I’ll win that money and buy my own
spacecraft which I can fill with my experiments
and cause yet more havoc across the cosmos!

DMA looks up from the computer where he has been looking up information.

 DMA 
By the Holy Sheep!

 THANDE 
What? How dare you spoil my
fun in the moment of my victory?
I shall maim you…with chemicals.

 LANDSHARK 
I’m thinking your halitosis
will do us in before that.

 DMA 
Look who else is coming to this thing.

 THANDE 
Oh, bloody hell.

 EXT.–SPACE–STRANGE SHIP 

A strange-looking, large ship enters the camera viewpoint. In some respects it resembles the AH.com and CF.Net ships, but it is very large and structured more like a space station or floating city. A crosstime drive assembly is visible at the base of the city-ship. Text painted around the edge of the ship reads, in English and many other languages,“ChangingTheTimes.Net”.

We zoom in on a hangar bay and pass through to view the interior…

 INT.–CTT.NET – CHRIS’S ROOM–DAY 

A massive room, packed with books, holds a computer and an Indian (yes, a real Indian, not a Native American) girl, who is flicking through a magazine looking bored. CHRIS himself is writing away faster than the eye can see; books are appearing out of one end of the computer faster than two robots can pick them up and are stacked on the shelves before being transported to the Hub for distribution to billions upon billions of eager fans.

Chris is a gloriously handsome blonde haired man with an enormous…

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN (in Editor Mode) 
Stop promoting yourself and get on with the script!

 CHRIS 
Oh, all right. Spoilsport.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (in Editor Mode) 
Any more of that and I’ll slap a rating on you
that will ensure that you’ll only be read by people
who can’t get Playboy at their local corner shop!

 GIRL 
I object to your characterisation of all Asians
as people who have corner shops! Some of
us have middle-of-the-road shops.

 CHRIS 
Don’t worry, GIRL. I’m about to send
him running off on a wild goose chase.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (In Editor Mode) 
You are? I would appreciate some
more warning, if you don’t mind…

 CHRIS 
 (Typing) 
And so PSYCHOMELTDOWN walked
out the door, chased by a stream of books…

PSYCHOMELTDOWN runs for his life as a swarm of books jump off the shelves and come buzzing after him like a thousand angry wasps. His screams echo in the distance…

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 ( In agony) 
Stop breaking the fourth wall and get on with it!

 GIRL 
The fourth wall?

CHRIS points out of the television, towards the viewer. There is a long pause…and then both of the handsome characters nearly faint with shock and horror at the sight that greets their eyes.

 GIRL 
The forks! Where are the forks!

 CHRIS 
Never mind, GIRL;
it’s time to get back to the script.
In one second, ADAM will…

The door hisses open and reveals ADAM DENTON, a young man clad in a massive American-designed powered armour suit, marked with campaign badges from such conflicts as the Second American Civil War, the American-French War, aka the Freedom Fries War, the America vs. Everyone Else War and the Bootstrap War. The suit crashes in and ADAM salutes.

 CHRIS 
Stand at ease!

 ADAM 
Sir, the crew wants to know when
POWER SHIFT will be completed!

 CHRIS 
When you actually get a book finished, promise.
 (Evil grin) 
call it encouragement. You
came all the way to tell me that?

 ADAM 
No, I came to tell you that we picked up a message.

ADAM’s suit automatically interfaces with the computer in CHRIS’s room – playing the American theme tune from TimeLine K as it does so – and displays the same message from STRAHA that was seen by the crew of the AH.COM SHIP.

 ADAM 
 (On STRAHA) 
By God, that’s a hot little number.

CHRIS cracks up as GIRL slaps ADAM.

 ADAM 
Sir, you have to go. Think of the honour!
Think of the glory! Think of the reward!

A woeful violin starts to play as CHRIS speaks.

 CHRIS 
 (Grinning) 
I can finally buy that second pair of arms to type even faster!
Onwards…to death or glory!

 EXT.–SPACE – CTT.NET SHIP 

The CTT.NET makes a massive turn in space, flares up its engines, opens a Vortex and jumps through it.

Dramatic music plays…

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – THANDE’s LAB 

THANDE is working on a test tube with one hand and talking to DMA at the same time, waving his spare hand around as TORQUMADA, IRONYUPPIE, LANDSHARK and DOCTOR WHAT look on, occasionally ducking as drops of something green and slimy jump out of the tube and make their escape while no one is looking.

DMA is sporting a T-shirt that has: THANDE SUCKS! CHRIS ROCKS! on it and draped over his shoulder is a banner that says: CHRIS FOR THE WIN!

 THANDE 
Look, you stupid Aussie drongo…

 DMA 
I’ll cheer on which ever bloody side I feel like cheering on.
You’re asking me to take sides against my old Captain!
You know, the one who encouraged YOU to start writing,
you miserable excuse for a hack writer…

 THANDE 
DMA, you know that we have been through a lot together.

 DMA 
 (Shrugs) 
There was that time you bought me a drink…

 THANDE 
And that we have shared great secrets.
And that I have always ensured that you
got a good part in my Harry Potter parodies…

 DMA 
But not as good a part as Harry had in the
version of the books from TimeLine 7653478568363.

 LANDSHARK 
 (Awed) 
The timeline where Harry becomes a
submissive S&amp;M slave of Hermione,
who canes him every day with a
long cane and…

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (Sweetly) 
Landie, what have I told you about
imagining anyone else holding the cane?
 (Pause) 
Look, DMA, you know that ever since THANDE
invented the pill to turn a straight woman into a
Lesbian he’s been highly regarded among the crew.

 DMA 
That wasn’t no pill, missy.
That was just him hitting on them.

 IRON YUPPIE 
We want him to win the contest, understand?

 DMA 
But I might have to betray my old Captain!
I swore on the Holy Sheep…

 THANDE 
Must people always be so difficult?

THANDE stabs DMA with a needle. DMA’s eyes roll up in his head and he collapses to the floor.

 THANDE 
Now…we will take him to the Sheepist World, and
then onwards to the HOTEL SPEND IT.

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (Sweetly) 
I think you’re forgetting who’s supposed to be in charge here.

THANDE looks over at DOCTOR WHAT, who is staring at IRONYUPPIE; THANDE looks at her for a long moment, then lowers his head.

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (Triumphant) 
Now…we will take him to the Sheepist World,
and then onwards to the HOTEL SPEND IT.
Death or glory!
 (Pause) 
Oh, and THANDE…come back with your book or upon it.
And could you also pick up a vat of Nutella for Landshark and I?

As the scene fades to black, we focus in on TORQUMADA. He’s smiling. It’s not a nice smile.

 EXT.–SPACE – HOTEL SPEND IT 

The HOTEL SPEND IT looks as if it came out of the mind of someone who was drinking something that THANDE invented and left in the microwave overnight. It is a massive space station as far as it is possible to get from the Hub, populated by lowlifes and soap opera fans. The station makes no sense at all, giving the impression of a place that is literally bigger on the outside than on the inside.

The Hotel is surrounded by thousands of shiftships, some of them familiar to our heroes, some of them strange and wonderful. There are signs of hundreds of thousands of people coming to watch the show. The AH.COM heads towards the docking bay…

 INT–AH.COM SHIP–CONTROL ROOM–DAY 

We see the various AH.commers at their stations..

 IRONYUPPIE 
 (Tiredly) 
All right, Kit; just say it.

 KIT 
Look at that massive long pointy
thing standing up straight and…

 LANDSHARK 
Take your eyes off my crotch
and look at the viewscreen!

 KIT 
Meh. Not impressed.

 LEO 
We have been ordered to dock at a
particular docking port…mwhahahahahaha.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
mwhahahahahaha?

 LEO 
That’s what they said.

 THANDE 
They must be laughing at
the other competitors.

 LEO 
Don’t gloat too soon, THANDE; look who’s here…

LEO focuses the screen in on the CTT.NET ship, which has docked on the other side of the station. The AH.COMMERS stare with awe, particularly DOCTOR WHAT, who has a tear in his eye…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
All that porn, wasted…

 MATT 
 (Eager) 
I nearly had an elevensome there…

There is a massive roar of laughter from the other AH.COMMERS.

 IRONYUPPIE 
YOU? GET LAID?

More Laughter

 MATT 
Hate. You. All.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
LEO, take us in to dock. We have an
appointment with an old friend of ours.
 (pause) 
I wonder what DMA is doing…

CUT TO:

 EXT. – SHEEPIST HOLY CITY – DAY 

DMA is slowly waking up. He is surrounded by armed men and women, the women also naked, while the men are wearing Sheepist outfits and carrying very large BFGs.

 DMA 
JIHAD ON YOUR ARSE!

He pulls himself to his feet and charges the crowd.

 DMA 
Death to the Sheep Reformist!

The battle rapidly spreads out of control, a la that old Asterix film, or maybe some of the Hulk films and comics.

 DMA 
Death to the Sheep Pope!

 MAN 
Hey, didn’t you try to fuck the Sheep Pope?

 DMA 
 (Proudly) 
I’m Australian

 MAN 
Ah. That’s fine, then.

The battle continues.

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – DAY 

The Hotel is the kind of place where if you have to ask the price, you can’t afford it. The massive room is decorated with gold and silver. A large viewscreen on the wall is reporting direct from the war front between the Hub and the ASB; a massive Hub Dreadnaught is blown apart as they watch, one of the Bat ships flapping its wings in triumph before vanishing into an improbability warp. A newsreader is warning about dangers to various timelines as the battle slips out of control; there’s also a request for information about a group of people turning entire planets into planets of women.

CHRIS is standing next to GIRL, watching the news of the war. Shiftships that bear more than a passing resemblance to the CTT.NET appear on the display as CHRIS watches. DOCTOR WHAT comes up behind him.

 CHRIS 
 (Shaking Doc’s hand) 
Ah. Good Morning, Bruno;
how’s the lesbian porn?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (putridly cheerful) 
I just obtained some of the latest from a
certain world of our acquaintance which
will add to the collection you gave me
from the Germans and the…ah…

 CHRIS 
The unpaid contributions of
your crew to the videos?
 (evil grin) 
Has Kit turned and decided that
women are the better sex now?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (Shocked) 
I’m shocked that you could say such a
thing, CHRIS; don’t you know that the
more gay men there are, the more rampant
totty there is for
 (pompous) 
us real men?

 CHRIS 
Yeah, thing is…I have those images of Kit’s
 (significant pause) 
performance and it strikes me that we could use it to…

His voice fades away as a holographic image appears in front of them. It’s MIKE COLLINS, wearing a Hitler moustache that somehow provides an effective disguise…or at the very least our heroes don’t recognise him.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Welcome to the contest! The contest to
find the greatest writer in the multiverse!
 (loud cheers) 
Now, I want a good fair fight…

 CHRIS and THANDE 
 (Under breath) 
Not bloody likely.

 MIKE COLLINS 
…And the winner will receive the
reward he deserves. Mwhahahahaha…

MIKE COLLINS realises that his laugh can be heard and vanishes from the display. Small robots come up and lead the contestants towards their rooms. As the camera follows CHRIS, we see someone moving up behind him; it’s TORQUMADA

 TORQUMADA 
 (Conspirator tone) 
A word with you, CHRIS…




 END ACT I 



 
 

 ACT II 




 
 

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – DAY 

 TORQUMADA 
And, so you see, THANDE has
decided that he wants to win.

 CHRIS 
 (Arrogant tone) 
Not a bloody Saudi’s chance when
it comes to the Day of Judgement!

 TORQUMADA 
But, you see, the Chemist has organised
most of the crew into helping him.

 CHRIS 
 (Suspicious) 
So, why are you helping me?

 TORQUMADA 
 (Conspirator tone) 
We all know that chemistry isn’t real science, and
so I want THANDE to lose, or he’ll inflict yet more
radioactive chloroform on the cosmos.

 CHRIS 
Well, we’ll just have to make sure that
he doesn’t win, won’t we?

They snigger together.

 TORQUMADA 
We’ll show that bloody chemist what for…

The writers are gathered together in a honeycomb of working cubicles, rather like Dilbert’s idea of Hell, but with sexy co-workers. CHRIS takes up his pen and starts to write with massive speed as the moderators pace around, one of them encountering a clone of Harry Turtledove and escorting him out, before discovering HARRY HARRISON in the writing group and evicting him with heavy gunfire.

 THANDE 
 (holding radio) 
Mad Chemist to Lesbolover, come in.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (holding radio) 
lesbolover here…

 THANDE 
 (holding radio) 
Mad Chemist to Lesbolover, come in and
launch the first part of the plan.

The scene changes to show DOCTOR WHAT sneaking through the room, past the writers, whereupon he slips into CHRIS’S cubical. CHRIS looks up as he enters..

 DOCTOR WHAT 
How’d you like some porn.
 (Pause) 
My porn; he can’t make me give away my porn!

DOCTOR WHAT grabs at CHRIS’S computer and accidentally on purpose hits a button. As CHRIS is using a pen, it doesn’t do much to the text, but CHRIS is annoyed…

 CHRIS 
TAKE THAT!

DOCTOR WHAT is slapped with a massive stick that appears out of nowhere…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
What did you do that for?

 CHRIS 
Bruno, I know that THANDE has promised
you much, but only I can write a fantastic
lesbian sex scene in thirty seconds flat…

CHRIS writes with astonishing speed, creating a page of drool-inducing descriptions and showing it to DOCTOR WHAT. The science of the room displays what CHRIS has written in the air, turned into a movie; DOCTOR WHAT’S eyes glaze over as he stares at the two girls in the air. CHRIS smirks and taps his wristcom.

 CHRIS 
Adam, go do something to THANDE, would you?

ADAM DENTON advances in a massive suit of powered combat armour, accidentally treading on a few noobs and rival writers as he advances, only to run into DAVE HOWERY, MATT and WEAPON M. DAVE is wearing his own Meecha suit, while WEAPON M and MATT open fire with BFGs. In the ensuring firestorm, hundreds of other writers are injured, they flee like so many stampeding sheep, but HARRY HARRISON manages to escape death.

 WEAPON M 
Shit. Missed him

 MATT 
Hey, Harry, come back and let us have another shot!
I personally liked your Stars and Stripe series!

In the ensuring confusion, ADAM DENTON advances on THANDE and prepares to exterminate him, but DAVE HOWERY smashes into his battlesuit in his meecha suit, leading to the two becoming tangled up into a mass of struggling metal. The noise is appalling; the two fighters roll around smashing other writers as they move…

 IRONYUPPIE 
Men! Stand back, boys; I’m going
to give him a mardi gras special!

The remaining writers promptly produce cameras in hopes of capturing a picture of IRONYUPPIE without…

 INT. – CHRIS’ ROOM – DAY 

CHRIS is suddenly grabbed by IRONYUPPIE, who is holding a weapon that seems to combine the worst features of cane, whip and paddle. The horror of the weapon is such that nine religions banned it…and ten more declared it a holy weapon to be used on anyone fidgeting during the sermon.

 IRONYUPPIE 
You show them my full frontal and
I’ll go medieval on YOUR arse!

CHRIS thinks about it

 IRONYUPPIE 
Don’t even think about saying those words…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (popping in) 
I find it strangely arousing…

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – DAY 

IRONYUPPIE tastefully picks up a test tube from THANDE’s desk and hurls it at ADAM DENTON. The acid burns through the battlesuit and sends him screaming for his life as the AH.COMMERS chase him.

 IRONYUPPIE 
That’s better…

 MATT 
Hey, look at all the writers we maimed.

 THANDE 
If you can’t take a little gut shot, then you
have no business being in the writing industry.

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – MIKE’S CONTROL ROOM–DAY 

The control room was clearly designed by an ameriwank fan. There are USA flags everywhere and MIKE himself sits in a chair designed to reassemble the President’s chair.

 MIKE COLLINS 
 (insane laugh) 
Look how few writers we have left!

And, indeed, only CHRIS and THANDE are left.

 STRAHA 
But they’re the ones that can make a new Hub.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Oh, goody. We’d better tell them the good news.

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – MEETING HALL 

The two crews assemble in the Hall, both clearly the worse for wear.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well, that’s just brilliant! DAVE and
MATT won’t recover for a few days

 THANDE 
you think KEIRA will need consoling?
 (straights his clothes) 

IRONYUPPIE hits him in the back of ht head.

 IRONYUPPIE 
Get that thought out of your head. We’re here
for you to win a contest and for me to finally
get my jewel inlaid tub for my quarters.

 THANDE 
But-

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Keep your mind on the prize, Thande.
We’ can’t let that Chris beat us.
What will happen to our reputation?
 (beat) 
It’ll fall even further, that’s what!

 IRONYUPPIE 
You mean from rock bottom to…somewhere even lower!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Precisely. We need a plan!

MIKE COLLINS, wearing his Hitler moustache, strolls onto the stage.

 MIKE COLLINS 
The two writers will complete in a daring
contest of pens in the showroom!

 THANDE 
I knew it! They’ve stolen it
from my version of Harry Potter!
 (gleeful) 
I’ll kick some Scottish arse with that!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Great!
 (To MIKE) 
I must say that without that moustache, you’d
be the spitting image of MIKE COLLINS.

 MIKE COLLINS 
 (Nervously) 
Really?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Of course. You’re much more handsome,
of course, for he’s an ugly bastard.

 MIKE COLLINS 
 (Annoyed) 
I take it you know, him, then?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (Gaily) 
I came, I saw, I kicked his arse.

MIKE COLLINS storms out of the room.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I wonder what’s up with him…

 HENDRYK 
Yes…I wonder.

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – MIKE’S CONTROL ROOM–DAY .

 MIKE COLLINS 
That critenerious liberal nearly saw through me!

 STRAHA 
MIKE, it doesn’t matter.

 MIKE COLLINS 
What have I told you about
talking to me as if we’re friends?

STRAHA nervously makes a doobie with one hand.

 STRAHA 
In an hour, CHRIS and THANDE will
enter the chamber and only one will
emerge. We’ll have all the energies
we need to power the weapon to
destroy the Hub.

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – THE CHAMBER .

The Chamber looks like a Star Trek holodeck, although much cooler. CHRIS enters the room from one side of the room, escorted by his second; GIRL. THANDE enters from the other side, escorted by a somewhat frazzled looking DOCTOR WHAT.

 THANDE 
I have a real writer to act as my second.

CHRIS locks lips with GIRL and there is a long kiss.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
 (rolls eyes) 
That would have been far hotter if it
weren’t for the ugly Scottish guy. Now
its just like someone pissing on your
fillet mignon.

 CHRIS 
 (annoyed) 
They’re serving free scotch in the main lobby

DOCTOR WHAT flees the room.

 THANDE 
 (After Doctor What) 
Wanker!

MIKE COLLIN’S voice booms down from the speaker.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Now, I want a good clean fight, with only
a small amount of cheating, plagarising and
stealing ideas from people on the board.

 THANDE and CHRIS 
Of course…

They look at each other.

 THANDE 
So, it has come to this.

 CHRIS 
It doesn’t have to end this way. Our friendship
being destroyed in a hail of written words.

 THANDE 
If you were to concede, now, think
of what we could do together.

 CHRIS 
You could always surrender…

 THANDE 
 (furious) 
Surrender? A word I have never used
before and hopefully never will again…

They’re still glaring at each other.

 THANDE 
You surrender!

Both fighters have been scribbling words behind their backs. Suddenly, one of them snaps…and the fight is on!

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – MIKE’S CONTROL ROOM – DAY .

 MIKE COLLINS 
They didn’t even wait for me to say go!

he sits back to watch, unaware of a face peeking around the door. It’s LUAKEL.

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – THE CHAMBER .

The fight looks like a crazy wizard’s duel, or the struggle between Friar Bungary and Herr Vandermast (before the PCloonies ruined the story) , in which the characters from the two writer’s stories do battle in the centre of the room. Thousands of Porntroopers race forward from THANDE’S pen, only to meet thousands of Americans in Powered Combat Armour from CHRIS’S pen. A massive alien ship from the Sahdavi appears out of nowhere, only to run into Unity starships that open fire on it and rip it to shreds.

Smaller characters appear as the duel goes on. Gorgons appear and advance, claws flashing, against Vároto, who strike back in their own style. Soldiers from 1815, led by Blount and Nuttall, charge against Oghaldzon, while the more seductive and sneaky Greys infect some of the Vároto with their own mental weapons. Thread Destroyers appear and smash into Megadreadnaughts, which hack away at each other as the fighting spins out of control.

Sex-wings and Thai-fighters appear, their weapons blazing out as they launch a strafing run against forces of the Second American Civil War, only to be intercepted in their turn by starfighters and American F-22’s…

 THANDE 
That’s cheating! You have to
use vehicles you made up yourself!

 CHRIS 
I invented the F-22 in
Timeline 34783578

THANDE waves a hand and a massive wave of flying pigs strikes the F-22 from the sky. CHRIS leers and waves his own hands; a giant successful Sealion appears and advances towards THANDE!

 THANDE 
All right, cheating IS allowed…

THANDE waves a hand and Luaky U. Commer appears

 Luaky Commer 
Sealion, eat the one who
summoned you here!

The Sealion advances on CHRIS

 CHRIS 
Damn it, where is DMA
when I need him?

 EXT. – SHEEPIST HOLY CITY – DAY 

DMA is surrounded by naked girls and men, enjoying their attentions

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – THE CHAMBER – DAY .

 CHRIS 
Blast!

 THANDE 
Who’s beaten you, eh?

 CHRIS 
BLAME THANDE!

The Sealion turns around and advances on THANDE, just as an American in Powered Combat Armour rips Luaky’s head off.

 CHRIS 
Sorry about that, man.

 THANDE 
I’ve been wanting to do
that for three scripts now.

THANDE summons a spitfire out of nowhere and destroys the Sealion, before turning to glare at CHRIS.

 THANDE 
My super weapon – the Uber Thread
Destroyer Overcompensator.

The Overcompensator appears and starts to open fire, sweeping CHRIS’S people from the room.

 CHRIS 
 (unimpressed) 
That’s your Overcompensator?
Mine’s bigger!

The other Overcompensator appears and both ships start shooting madly at each other. The fighting rages on as, though the magic of confused understanding, both ships are somehow a match for each other despite the vast superiority of CHRIS’S Overcompensator. Eventually, both ships crash into each other…

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – MEETING HALL 

Everyone ooohs ans aaahs as the two starships explode in a dazzling display of fireworks..

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – MIKE’S CONTROL ROOM .

 MIKE COLLINS 
A few more hours and I’ll have enough
energy destroy Ian with.

 STRAHA 
Look, CHRIS has brought
out the heavy ammo!

Rampaging Muslims have crashed into…umm, THANDE has never written anything so controversial, so we’ll assume for the sake of argument that he has, OK?

 MIKE COLLINS 
 (unimpressed) 
They call THAT heavy ammo?
When Bush III went into the
Caliphate, he didn’t piss around,
no sir!

STRAHA pulls up a chair as MIKE continues ranting. There is an adoring expression on his face.

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – MEETING HALL .

 HENDRYK 
I know he doesn’t hate me,
but does he have to mock me?

 DAVE HOWERY 
It’s bad enough having to
invade Canada every book!

 AD 
Then you’ll love Tom Kratman’s
new book, in which the US invades
Canada in 2020…

Everyone shouts at the ADbot to piss off as LUAKEL runs in.

 LUAKEL 
Guys, gays, guys!

Everyone ignores him.

 LUAKEL 
Guys, it’s MIKE COLLINS!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Luaky, just because someone looks like
MIKE COLLINS, it doesn’t mean he is
MIKE COLLINS, and just because some-
one talks like MIKE COLLINS, doesn’t
mean he is MIKE COLLINS, and just
because someone has a mad laugh like
MIKE COLLINS…
 (Sudden appalled silence) 
It’s MIKE COLLINS!

Everyone shouts and screams.

 LUAKEL 
He’s got this evil plan, him and that girl with the big tits
 (is slapped by IRONYUPPIE) 
and they’re going to do something horrible to the writers
and use them for some evil plan and…

 HENDRYK 
We have to stop him!

 WEAPON M 
Lock and Load!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I give the orders round here!
 (pause) 
Do it like he said!

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – THE CHAMBER–DAY .

The battle us still raging, but both writers have sweat on their foreheads. They can’t go on for much longer

 CHRIS 
Surrender now and I promise you passage
to wherever in the Multiverse you would like.

 THANDE 
Surrender and I promise you free drugs for as long as you live.

A Walker strides into the Dawntider ship and the Multiverse is nearly ripped apart, before vanishing and taking the remaining traces of that particular struggle with it. The fighting continues…

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – MIKE’S CONTROL ROOM .

MIKE is stroking one of the balls containing energy that is slowly being generated by the writers

 MIKE COLLINS 
A few more minutes and…

The crew of the AH.COM burst in.

 HENDRYK 
All right, you bastard right-winger, you’re going
back to the MIKE COLLINS MULTIVERSE PRISON!

 MIKE COLLINS 
Fools! You think you can stop me now?
I have the power, all the power I need to alter reality
and power the weapon that will destroy the Hub!

He rubs his hand over the ball and HENDRYK is turned into a statue.

 MIKE COLLINS 
With this power, I SHALL BECOME A GOD!

IRONYUPPIE hits him.

 IRONYUPPIE 
There’s only room for one God around here; ME!

 MIKE COLLINS 
I’ll turn you into a sex slave in a moment;
say goodbye to everything, but…

MIKE accidentally hits the speaker; suddenly, CHRIS and THANDE can hear everything..

 MIKE COLLINS 
Me! Me for all eternity! Me, the Lord and Master
of ALL! You’ll be on your back with…

IRONYUPPIE hits him again. A desperate struggle breaks out.

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – THE CHAMBER 

 CHRIS 
 (Instant understanding) 
That thing is draining our writing power
and using it to power up some weapon
to destroy the Hub with!

 THANDE 
 (Instant understanding) 
But that means, as long as we fight, MIKE can use
our powers to turn the girls into sex slaves – and the men too!

Long agonising pause.

 THANDE and CHRIS 
THE FORKS! THE FORKS!

 CHRIS 
We have to work together!

 THANDE 
But that means you’d win!

 CHRIS 
 (screaming) 
We have to work together!

 THANDE 
 (screaming) 
You already said that!

 CHRIS 
 (screaming) 
I know!

 THANDE 
 (screaming) 
So What!

 CHRIS 
 (screeching) 
Blame THANDE!

 THANDE 
 (furious) 
We have to stop him! He’s just turned
WEAPON M into a hot blonde…

 CHRIS 
 (screeching) 
Fuck You!

 THANDE 
 (Laughing) 
Fuck Him!

 CHRIS 
 (desperate) 
The Forks!

 THANDE 
 (Laughing) 
We could always let MIKE finish before we stop him!

 CHRIS 
 (screaming) 
But that would be the end of us too!
 (pause) 
THANDE, I hate to admit this, but
you’re a better writer than me.

 THANDE 
 (Sincerely) 
And you’re a better writer than me.

CHRIS holds out a hand, a la The Doctor in Last of the Time Lords. In a moment, THANDE takes it and they shake hands.

 INT. – HOTEL SPEND IT – MIKE’S CONTROL ROOM .

MIKE is admiring his new harem when the Balls suddenly run out of energy, leaving only one glowing red ball of light…and all the AH.COMMERS return to normal – or at least as close to normal as they get.

 MIKE COLLINS 
What in MY name?

 IRONYUPPIE 
I don’t think you’re a God anymore.

CHRIS and THANDE burst in.

 CHRIS 
It’s over, MIKE.

 THANDE 
We have kissed and made up.

 MIKE COLLINS 
 (furious) 
More shirtlifters!

he waves a hand at DOCTOR WHAT, whose hands are still feeling the space where, for one shining moment, he had breasts.

 MIKE COLLINS 
I still have one thing!

he points at the glowing red ball.

 MIKE COLLINS 
With this, I can still kick your ass, punks!

CHRIS grabs THANDE and shoves him at MIKE COLLINS. THANDE manages to knock the ball from MIKE COLLINS’ hand. CHRIS immediately writes a 1000 word tome and smashes the ball with it.

 MIKE COLLINS 
 (shocked) 
God damn it!
This isn’t over!
Not by a long shot!

MIKE COLLINS vanishes in a flash of light, teleported back to the IP.NET. Moment’s later, the ship flees the station and vanishes into a vortex.

 CHRIS 
It’s over.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well, once again the AH.commers save the day.

 CHRIS 
I was the one who smashed the ball.

 THANDE 
It was I who knocked it out of his hand.

The two begin immediately arguing. Moments later fists are being thrown.

 WEAPON M 
Fuck, I’ve seen two year olds throw harder punches.
Fucking nerds.
Who’s up for some victory beers?

The crew walks out.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – REST ROOM …

 CHRIS 
Well, all the mess seems to be cleared up. Everyone’s
heading back home, but that place isn’t going to be
useful for a while. You should see what Straha
and Mike did to the bathrooms.
 (He takes a large swig of tea) 
And it was interesting to see you all again.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Yeah, a little misadventure goes a long way.
 (beat) 
So, who won?

 CHRIS and THANDE 
ME!

They look at each other for a long moment, then…

 CHRIS 
Now, THANDE, we’re still the best of friends, aren’t we?

 THANDE 
Why?

 CHRIS 
 (shrugs) 
That way I don’t have to write
lurid gaysexual scenes with you in it.

 KIT 
I wouldn’t even buy that book.

 THANDE 
 (thoughtful pause) 
Okay.

They shake hands.

Music plays.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CONTROL ROM – DAY 

 GBW 
Are we still leaving DMA where he is?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Might as well pick him up.

 GBW 
Damn.

 EXT. – SHEEPIST HOLY CITY – DAY 

DMA is surrounded by naked girls and men, enjoying their attentions

 DMA 
Brothers in the faith, we will now triumph
against the sheep reformist and…

He vanishes in a loud pop.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – REST ROOM 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Welcome back, DMA!

 DMA 
Hate. You. All.

 INT. – IP.NET SHIP– DAY .

 STRAHA 
But it wasn’t a total disaster…

Pan out to show his latest plan; a desperate attempt to disguise MIKE as IAN.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Yes it was, you drugged out
shirt-lifting wanker!

He points the feminiser at STRAHA as the closing music starts to roll.

 INT. – IP.NET SHIP– DAY .

STRAHA’s screams can be heard as the black ship flies off into the distance.

 TEASER 


 
 

 EXT. – SPACE – DAY 

We see the AH.com ship arrive from a vortex.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – CORRIDOR – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT and GREY WOLF are walking down the corridor.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
You know the crew could use a little break.

 GREY WOLF 
From what, sir?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
From all the things they do.

 GREY WOLF 
So you mean we’re actually going to have
them do something resembling work, sir?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Definatley. A little blood, sweat,
and toil never hurt anyone.

 GREY WOLF 
Of course, but you have to realize that
this is our crew you’re talking about.
They’re nigh about useless when it
comes to physical things.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
But we save worlds and people
on a weekly basis.

 GREY WOLF 
True, but we don’t do heavy lifting.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I think it’s about time that we did so.

 GREY WOLF 
Shall I pencil it in the Master Schedule.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
No. Pen it in.

 GREY WOLF 
Aye, aye, sir.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
You don’t have to say that in
a sarcastic manner.

 GREY WOLF 
I wasn’t.

A door opens and DMA, MATT, WEAPON M, and FLOCCULENCIO come staggering out, in various states of undress.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
What the hell?

 DMA 
Bloody, hell, mate. That’s the last time
I try to drink Bobo under the table.

 WEAPON M 
He’s got a wooden leg, I say.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
My head feels funny.

 MATT 
Hey, who’s up for a more?

The three men groan and stagger pass DOCTOR WHAT and GREY WOLF.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
This is what I’m talking about.
 (points at the receding Matt) 
We’re losing our edge and devolving into sloth.

 GREY WOLF 
I’m sorry, sir. But it’s a bit difficult to take
you seriously in that rhinestone jumpsuit.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
It was the only thing I could find this morning!

 GREY WOLF 
You’ll have ot admit, though, sir. That every time
we do try to institute a policy regarding the crew’s
physical appearance, something comes up that
puts it on the back burner.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well, we’re gonna have to
keep a fine grip upon things.

Suddenly there’s a pounding of booted feet.

PSYCHOMELTDOWN, THANDE, MICHAEL, and HENDRYK come running around a corner.

 MICHAEL 
Run for your lives!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
What’s going on?

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Big!

 THANDE 
Ugly!

 HENDRYK 
Monster!

They flee past the two men. A moment later a huge creature some barreling down the corridor.

 GREY WOLF 
I’ll reschedule it for tomorrow.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
A good idea.

They both flee.

 ACT I 



 
 

 EXT. – SPACE – DAY 

The AH.com ship is around an Earth.

 INT–AH.COM CONTROL ROOM – DAY 

GBW looks up and hits a button, the main view screen shows the planet

 WEAPON M 
 (glancing up from Militia Babes Magazine) 
Hey, I was watching that.

 GBW 
We’ve arrived to a new earth.

 LANDSHARK 
Not only does he pilot the ship, but he’s also
taken up the position of Stating of Obvious.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Hey, Leo, what can you tell us about this Earth?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Most of this world is divided between two empires,
the British and the French. The British have North
and South America except for Canada; the Mideast
and East Africa, and the southwestern Pacific. The
French have Canada, continental Europe, North Africa
and parts of the Pacific. Japan has expanded into
Okinawa and the Philippines. The tech level is higher
than OTL, due to an extended cold war between the
British and French empires.

 WEAPON M 
Where’s the best place for beer and porn?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Sault St. Marie, at a junction between the upper and
lower peninsulas of Michigan, is a good bet. It’s a
major city in this timeline. Half of it is French, half
of it is British. It appears to be a neutral zone.

 WEAPON M 
FUCK!
 (throws Militia Babes Magazine at GBW) 
Is it some crazy assed coincidence that everything
happens in that damn town? Can’t something happen
in a more amazing place, like… like. Detroit?

 LANDSHARK 
I’d rather face cannibal supermodels, mutants,
and crazy chain saw wielding mountain men
than step foot in that hell hole.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
So it’s agreed? We go to Detroit?

 LEO CAESIUS 
I detect a particularly large ship full of beer, leaving
Detroit, and heading north. It’s logical to assume–

 WEAPON M 
Hot Damn! What did I tell you?

 DIAMOND 
Any countries shaped like body parts? Or
giant booze factories shaped like cigarettes?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Not that I’ve observed. But there is something which
may interest you, at the location of OTL Sault Ste. Marie.
It appears to be a whorehouse full of liquor–

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Good enough for us. Let’s go! Grey, you’re
in charge here. Find out who wants to go and
send them to the shuttle bay.

 GREY WOLF 
Okay. But what’s wrong
with the teleporter this time?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
G.BONE says he needs some alone time with it.
He said it in that creepy voice he uses when he’s
talking about that one girl that hit on him at the
Pub two years ago. I figure it’s best not to inquire.

 INT–SHUTTLE BAY – DAY 

DOCTOR WHAT, GBW, DAVE HOWERY, WEAPON M, IRON YUPPIE, LANDSHARK, MATT, KIT and DMA file into the shuttle.

A moment later they all coming running out of it, all looking on the verge of throwing up.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Oh, dear God. What was that?

 LANDSHARK 
Even I am appalled.

 WEAPON M 
Hmmm. Who would have thought a
hundred pounds of fish could go bad?
 (shrugs) 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
A different shuttle, then.

DOCTOR WHAT, GBW, DAVE HOWERY, WEAPON M, IRON YUPPIE, LANDSHARK, MATT, KIT and DMA file into the shuttle.

A moment later they all coming running out of it, all looking on the verge of throwing up.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Oh, dear God. What was that?

PSYCHOMELTDOWN walks out the shuttle, head hanging down in sadness.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
I-I just wanted to go on the mission…

He leaves the Shuttle Bay.

The crew gets back on the shuttle.

 EXT–SHUTTLE POD BAY – DAY 

A shuttle takes off,

Clock-wipe

 EXT. – SAULT ST. MARIE–DAY 

The shuttle descends from the sky and lands in an alley in downtown Sault St. Marie.

The crew debark and leave the alley, to stand on the broad pavement in front of a two-story building. It has a door with a blackened window, and a large bay window. Inside the bay window is a green neon sign, flashing on and off. It alternates the phrases, BAR and GRIL; BRA and GIRL; ARB and LIRG.

 MATT 
What’s a LIRG?
It sounds hot.

 WEAPON M 
I had LIRG once. Had to take penicillin for a month.
But damn it, I’d do it all over again.
 (Matt and Weapon M high five) 

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Sounds like my kind of place.
Let’s go on in.

DOCTOR WHAT goes in first. Instantly the others hear the sounds of scuffling, and an engine starts up. IRON YUPPIE pulls open the door in time to see a truck driving away from what was a fake entrance. In the distance looms an ominous looking building.

 IRON YUPPIE 
They’ve got Doc.

 LANDSHARK 
I say good riddance to bad rubbish.

 GBW 
We have to get him back!

 WEAPON M 
Not really.

 MATT 
But he has the money to pay for the booze.

 WEAPON M 
Shit. I guess we have to.

DMA is about to say something when a group of soldiers appears. These include DARKEST90, DARTH COLLINS, DARK_BASTARD, DARKJEDI77 , JOLO, REDNBLACK and HEART OF DARKNESS. A dozen more anonymous grunts are right behind them. They are dressed like the Borg. They are holding odd-looking rifles, all pointed at the crew.

 DARKEST90 
 (tonelessly, like a Borg.) 
You are under arrest.
JUSTIN PICKARD will see to you.

 IRON YUPPIE 
 (displaying her yo-yo) .
You’ll have to get past my electric yo-yo first!

 DARTH COLLINS 
The number of ohms you present to us shall be unavailing.

 DARKJEDI77 
You will be consolidated.

 ALT DARKSLAVIK 
Your particularities shall be
reduced to insignificance and your–

 DARKEST90 
 (tonelessly) 
Shut up and tackle ‘em!

IRON YUPPIE hurls her yo-yo at DARKEST90, who deflects it expressionlessly. Behind the soldiers, a tank-sized monstrosity of a vehicle approaches slowly, driven by SATANIC MECHANIC, who is a cyborg, apparently welded into the top. The vehicle bears a giant, mechanical face in its front.

The mouth is moving up and down, as if chewing something.

 WEAPON M 
Hey, Dave. I think they’ve
kidnapped Keira again!

DAVE HOWERY screams and pulls out his chainsaw. He runs at DARKEST90 and cuts him in half, and goes after other faceless, nameless drones.

 MATT 
God, he’s so predictable.

 GBW 
It’s love that drives him.

 MATT 
No, it ain’t. It’s the prospect
of getting laid regularly.
It’ll… do things to a man…
 (far away look) 

WEAPON M slaps MATT in the back of the head.

 WEAPON M 
Now, ain’t the time. Matt.
We got baddies to kill.

WEAPON M pulls his BFG out and begins laying down fire at everything that moves. A lucky shot hits DARKJEDI77 and drops him.

MATT kicks JOLO in the crotch, then shoves him into DAVE HOWERY who finishes him off with his chainsaw.

DMA fires his gun at REDNBLACK, who screams and collapses.

HEART OF DARKNESS comes charging at DMA. He fires again, causing the man to drop to the ground sobbing.

IRON YUPPIE fires her yo-yo at DARK BASTARD, who collapses. Then she fires it at DARTH COLLINS, who grabs the string and receives an electrical shock, and collapses, still holding the string. SATANIC MECHANIC pulls a trigger and the tank’s jaws open, firing a giant pink bubblegum bubble at IRON YUPPIE.

She is drawn into its jaws, as LANDSHARK screams and tries to jump onto the tank, firing his guns all around him. The vehicle suddenly roars, and zooms backward, away from the battle. LANDSHARK follows it toward a gigantic building in the distance.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (dropping dead solider) 
Hey, wait a minute!
Keira’s on the ship.
 (beat) 
Where’s Yuppie?

 INT–AH.COM SHIP–LOUNGE –DAY 

PSYCHOMELTDOWN tosses himself onto a couch, across from FLOCCULENCIO, who is sitting backward on a chair.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Look what I found in Doc’s cabin. A movie camera.
I came across it accidentally while I was digging
though his stuff. He really shouldn’t just use three
locks and a randomly generated code to lock the
room up when he’s gone. He’s practically asking
for us to open it up and see what’s inside.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
I wonder what he does with a video camera?

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
I’m guessing he likes to record himself while doing
Impressions of the great leaders of Alt History.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Or he could be video taping himself using the six
tons of mangoes he had us buy the other day.

The two shudder.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
You’d best put it back.

PSYCHOMELTDOWN
Hell, no. I’m going to sell it
to pay for my prostitute habit.
 (pauses, lost in thought.) 
Or better yet I’ll make a movie.
Become a famous director, then
win the heart of my true love.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Aye. That’s likely to happen…

MICHAEL, G.BONE and DIAMOND stroll in and sit down on various couches.

 DIAMOND 
What’cha up to?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Psychomeltdown wants to make a movie.

 MICHAEL 
I can write the score.

 DIAMOND 
As if you’ve ever had any…to score with…
 (uncertain) 

 G.BONE 
Where will we get the women?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (grinning) 
We can just have somebody dress up
and put on some makeup…

LUAKEL wanders into the room and sits on a couch.

 LUAKEL 
What’s going on?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
I think we have a volunteer. How’d you
like to have a major part in a movie?

 LUAKEL 
Hey, that’s a great idea! I wanna go write the script!
 (Leaps to his feet and dashes out the door.) 

 G.BONE 
I’ll supply the special effects.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
What do we need with special effects?

 G.BONE 
I’ll think of something.

 INT–JUSTIN PICKARD’S INTERROGATION CHAMBER – DAY 

IRON YUPPIE is tied to a chair, glaring at JUSTIN PICKARD, who is smiling. He has a thin mustache, a monocle and a cane.

 IRON YUPPIE 
Aren’t you enough of a man to
face me without tying me up?

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Of course. As soon as you tell
me where you came from.

 IRON YUPPIE 
You wouldn’t believe me.

JUSTIN PICKARD smiles. He reaches up and pulls down a floodlight. He tries not to squint as he turns it on and puts it directly into IRON YUPPIE’s face. IRON YUPPIE squints and turns her head.

 IRON YUPPIE 
I’m a descendant of the Secret Maori Superscience
Civilization living in caverns underneath the Indian Ocean.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Nah.

JUSTIN PICKARD’s eyes are squeezed shut against the bright light. He turns off the floodlight, shoves it back up and pulls down a wire framework and winds her hair into it. He presses a button and the framework yanks a large chunk of her hair out.

IRON YUPPIE merely glowers.

 IRON YUPPIE 
I popped in out of thin air. I’m a little green man from
Alpha Centauri, it’s a lovely place, you oughta go see it.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
I don’t think so. You stole that
line from a Sky Trek episode.

 IRON YUPPIE 
Amateur. I came in a spaceship from a parallel
universe where the seas are made of soda pop.

JUSTIN PICKARD whacks her hard with his cane, giving her another electrical shock.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Let’s try that again, shall we? Where did you really come from?

 IRON YUPPIE 
If you release me, I’ll not only tell you,
but hand over all our valuables.
How’s that? Or are you afraid of me?

JUSTIN PICKARD makes a gesture and a trap door in the ceiling opens and rocks land on her, covering her in dust. He smiles.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Maybe that will make you more cooperative.
One more time. Where did you come from?

 IRON YUPPIE 
All right. I came from the Canary Islands,
where the Knights Templar were hiding for
hundreds of years.I’m a scout. They want
to find out how advanced you are so–

JUSTIN PICKARD makes another gesture. A nozzle in the ceiling opens, firing hot water under high pressure at a spot between her eyes. She winces and struggles, until the water stops.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Once more. With plausibility.
And the truth.

 IRON YUPPIE 
I’m a descendant of the secret Aleutian Empire
here to warn the French of the secret Fijians’
alliance with the British which they didn’t tell you
about since you’re only an underling and–

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Oh, dear. Now I’ll just have
to get out the heavy artillery.

Without turning, JUSTIN PICKARD reaches behind him and turns on a VCR. A children’s program begins playing.

 CUDDLY CHILDREN 
 (on an obviously cardboard and styrofoam set) 
We wanna sing! We wanna dance!
We wanna play! We wanna prance!
We’re gonna learn! Every flower and fern!
Singing–

FOCUS ON IRON YUPPIE, who is smiling cynically. FOCUS ON JUSTIN PICKARD, who is wincing. He turns off the VCR.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
That didn’t bother you?

 IRON YUPPIE 
 (smiling) 
I was imagining how they’d look as post-nuclear
zombies who leave me alone and drink all the
toxic waste they want.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
 (sighing) 
One more try. Who sent you?

 IRON YUPPIE 
The tiny mountain kingdom of Bhutan is really
larger and more powerful than anybody thinks,
and it’s ready to launch an all-out attack on–

As IRON YUPPIE is speaking, JUSTIN PICKARD turns around to grab a cattle prod off the shelf.

IRON YUPPIE squirms one last time, loosening the chair enough for it to swing around and forward, knocking JUSTIN PICKARD off his feet. She lands on top of him. He grabs a gun and points it at her but she bites his wrist, causing him to drop the gun.

Just then, LANDSHARK bursts through the door, sees JUSTIN PICKARD’s gun and fires, shooting off JUSTIN PICKARD’s arm and destroying the gun.

 LANDSHARK 
I hope I’m not too late to rescue you?

 IRON YUPPIE 
 (smiling) 
Not at all. I just need to get these chains off.

LANDSHARK takes a knife off his belt and uses it to cut one of her chains loose. She yanks on it and breaks it, grabs the knife and cuts the other chain off. LANDSHARK helps IRON YUPPIE to her feet.

Two guards, SARGON and SYPHON, come through the door and raise their weapons. IRON YUPPIE fires her yo-yo at SARGON as LANDSHARK fires his gun at SYPHON. They both collapse on the floor.

 LANDSHARK 
Where to now?

 IRON YUPPIE 
Let’s see what else JUSTIN PICKARD has around here.

They leave the room and we see them walking down the corridor.

 EXT–SAULT STE. MARIE – DAY 

The crewmembers approach a bar with a red neon sign above the door. The sign reads
LUNA_MIDNIGHT’S LAIR

DMA opens the door a bit, peeks in.

 DMA 
It looks real this time.

 MATT 
How about you go in and we’ll wait
to see if you get kidnapped too.

 DMA 
It looks to be Happy Hour.
Half price on beer and wings.

DMA is shoved aside by MATT and WEPAON M.

 INT–BAR – DAY 

The AH.COM crewmembers walk in, and stare at their surroundings. The bar has a distinctly Japanese theme to it, with many low tables and low couches surrounding each table. Only a few tables are occupied.

 LUNA_MIDNIGHT 
What can I get for you?

The others look at LUNA_MIDNIGHT. He is the chief bartender. He has pale skin, with what appear to be cybernetic implants around his eyes, ears and scalp. His hair is dyed the exact same color as his skin. He is wearing a green Nehru jacket and fingerless, cybernetic gloves.

The crewmembers approach the bar.

 GBW 
Um, we’re not from around here. We need some help.
One of our comrades was kidnapped by some soldiers.
We saw what we thought was a bar, the doorway was
a fake, he stepped through and he was hauled into a
truck and we don’t know where he is.

 LUNA_MIDNIGHT 
 (glowers knowingly) 
That’s how DARKLING operates. He is the French military
commandant of the city. His is the huge pink, beige and
lavender building on the outskirts.

 MATT 
Another of our comrades was also kidnapped–by
JUSTIN PICKARD’s men! LANDSHARK is off
trying to rescue her…

 WEAPON M 
God help that poor stupid man.

 MATT 
Landshark or Justin Pickard?

 LUNA_MIDNIGHT 
Hmm.. Justin Pickard. Well…
He’s the British military commandant of the city.
He’s in the green and black building at the
water’s edge, next to the docks.

KIT opens up his man-bag and reaches inside.

 KIT 
We’d like to get something to drink.
Do you have change for a tiara?

KIT sets the tiara on the counter, LUNA_MIDNIGHT stares at it and smiles.

 LUNA_MIDNIGHT 
I’ll give you the South Brazillian Kruggerands
one of my other customers gave me.

 DMA 
Is that tiara real? Where did you get that?

 KIT 
That last world we visited. Where Australia
was a republic and the Queen of England
had her own talk show.
 (To LUNA_MIDNIGHT) 
I’d like a lemon vodka.

 OTHNIEL 
I’d like a Shirley Temple.

 LUNA_MIDNIGHT 
A–what?? What kind of temple??

 OTHNIEL 
 (embarrassed) 
Uh–no, sorry, it’s a drink–I meant–I’d like a
drink with uh…well, what do you have handy?

 LUNA_MIDNIGHT 
 (jokingly) 
Milk and cookies.

 OTHNIEL 
That works for me.

The others also order, KIT hands him the tiara and LUNA_MIDNIGHT hands him some coins in exchange.

A young man in an open shirt and jeans approaches KIT.

 HERMANUBIS 
Hi, I’m HERMANUBIS. I overheard what you were saying.
I can help you get around the city safely. I’ve lived here all
my life, and I would enjoy the chance to show newcomers
all about my fair city, and we can go to those two places.

 KIT 
 (smiling, looking at HERMANUBIS up and down) 
Hey, no problem.

 GBW 
We’re new here. We’re looking for a friend, DOCTOR WHAT.
He was apparently kidnapped by DARKLING.

 WEAPON M 
And IRON YUPPIE was kidnapped by JUSTIN PICKARD!

 HERMANUBIS 
I can get you to a safe spot where we have maps and things to help you.

 WEAPON M 
Let’s go!

HERMANUBIS leads them out, and down the street.

 GBW 
Do you think it’s wise to follow a man we
don’t even know to some undefined location?

 WEAPON M 
Don’t be a spoil sport, GBW.
We rely upon the kindness of
strangers to get us out of trouble.

 DMA 
Remember that world where
we were in that Aztec Jail?

 MATT 
 (glancing behind himself.) 
I think we’re being followed.

 HERMANUBIS 
That happens a lot in this city. It is
a neutral zone–what’s the matter?

 KIT 
That word neutral–just has a bad association
with us. I hope there aren’t any radicals…

 HERMANUBIS 
We have all kinds here. Here’s another bar,
it’s a nice, safe place. It was constructed in
1898, as a Farmer’s Guild Hall, and now is
used as a safe place for immigrants and–

 MATT 
Thanks, let’s go in.

HERMANUBIS opens the door and he leads them down a short, red brick stairway into a brightly lit bar with red brick walls. Along one wall is a bar with a robot behind it. The robot looks like a jukebox, with four long, slinky-type arms. The crewmembers are greeted by several others.

 HERMANUBIS 
These are my friends. Have a seat.
What would you like to drink?

Everybody introduces themselves, they give their orders, and HERMANUBIS goes to the robot and punches in some codes.

 WEAPON M 
Shouldn’t we be getting our comrades rescued?

 HERMANUBIS 
 (serving their drinks) 
It will be better to start the operation at night.
It will be harder for us to be seen, and fewer
soldiers will be on the streets. We’re going
into DARKLING’s headquarters via an estate
in the middle of the park.

 GBW 
How is that possible?

 HERMANUBIS 
 (sitting down) .
There are underground tunnels connecting
all the major buildings in the city. You can
get from one building to another without being
seen because we’ve compiled maps of most
of the tunnels.

SUNSURF comes along with an armful of maps and brochures and sets them on the table.

 SUNSURF 
Here are maps of the city and blueprints of
the major buildings, I got from the local library
before they shut it down. I hope it helps.

 WEAPON M 
So you’re a spy too?

 SUNSURF 
No, I don’t go outside anymore. Too dangerous.
I used to be a preschool librarian in Lansing, but
when everybody else evacuated the city–because
of the war–I got on the wrong bus and
I ended up here…

FADE OUT as SUNSURF continues talking.




 END ACT I 


 
 

 ACT II 



 
 

 INT–AH.COM LOUNGE – EVENING 

Several of the crew are gathered around watching LUAKEL, who is glaring at a large blond wig sitting on a table.

 LUAKEL 
I’m not wearing it!

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Maybe we can say it’s an alien monster trying to
attack LUAKEL and steal his…manhood.

 LUAKEL 
Works for me.

LUAKEL takes the wig, holds it to his crotch, starts writhing and moaning. The others start to laugh. LUAKEL stops and glares.

 LUAKEL 
What’s so funny?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Oh, nothing…much. Hey, as long as
it’s entertaining. I have another idea, too…

 EXT–AN ESTATE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY – EVENING 

HERMANUBIS stops on a trail and turns to speak to the others.

 HERMANUBIS 
This estate has an underground passage
to DARKLING’s headquarters.

The crew approach the gate, and stop to stare at the large tank guarding the entrance. At the top is GOOGLE SPIDER, a man who appears to have been incorporated into the machine. He is wearing a helmet with wires coming out of it, and has several arms lying at angles across the top of the machine.

 MATT 
That looks like the thing
that kidnapped IRON YUPPIE.

 DMA 
Looks like a Google Spider!

 WEAPON M 
I think it’s a Google Spider wanna-be.

 GBW 
I know just how to deactivate this gizmo-guy.
 (Steps forward.) 
Hey, robot! I am lying.

 GOOGLE SPIDER 
Lying about what?

 GBW 
Um–the fact that I’m lying.

 GOOGLE SPIDER 
There has to be an external referent.
Otherwise the statement is meaningless.

 GBW 
Okay. How’s this? A heterological word
is a word which does not describe itself.
So does the word“heterological”describe itself?

 GOOGLE SPIDER 
The flaw in that paradox is in assuming
there are only two choices. The question
does not apply to that word. It need not
be either self-referential or self-descriptive.

 GBW 
Okay. If every rule has an exception,
is there an exception to that rule?

 GOOGLE SPIDER 
That is not a rule, since the word“rule”implies
some external entity to enforce it. Since it is
merely a description of a certain aspect of the
world–and not necessarily an accurate description–
there is no requirement for the world to adhere
to the statement. Besides, there are many rules
which are absurd, meaningless and trivial, which
may or may not have exceptions which have no
relevance to the real world.

 GBW 
Ok. Um. The king of a certain country has
decreed that all mayors who do not live in
their own cities, must live in the City of Mayors.
Where does the mayor of the City of Mayors live?

 GOOGLE SPIDER 
What country are you referring to? What is
the source of your information? How recent
is it? And why do I need to answer your question?

 GBW 
 (walking back to the others.) 
Anybody else have any ideas?

WEAPON M fires his gun and the robot blows up.

 GBW 
Hey! You coulda had us back up a bit first!

 WEAPON M 
Oh. Sorry.

 DMA 
Works for me.

They walk through the gates, along the pathway, and around to the side of the mansion. They come to a side door, hidden in shrubbery. HERMANUBIS reaches in his pocket and presents a set of keys.

 HERMANUBIS 
One of our spies got the keys to this door.

 GBW 
It seems so unguarded.

 HERMANUBIS 
 (unlocking the door) 
The security is very well hidden.
We’ll just have to watch out for–

The door suddenly explodes outward and HERMANUBIS leaps away into the shrubbery. A swarm of crawling robot spiders a foot long comes out and everybody opens fire. The robots shoot back but eventually they are all destroyed.

 INT–MANSION – NIGHT 

The corridor is dimly lit by tiny lightbulbs. The AH.COM crew walk through the entrance and along a corridor and come to a double door. DMA tries to open it, but fails. He kicks it open.

 INT–ANOTHER CORRIDOR – NIGHT 

WEAPON M walks in and stops abruptly as several guards wearing green and lavender fur jackets and red hats approach. The others fire their weapons and dive around the corner. The guards collapse.

They come to another door, and WEAPON M kicks it in.

 INT–A BEDROOM – EVENING 

FENWICK and MIKE ONEAL 5, both in lavender silk nightgowns, are standing, facing, each holding a martini. They react as the door is thrown wide open and smashes a figurine next to the door. Both fling down their martinis onto the rug.

FENWICK is very angry and begins to sing.

 FENWICK 
Hold me back, MIKE! Hold me back!
‘Tis only a thing, a symbol which pales next to you!
It is gone, MIKE, it is gone!
The fragments remain, they can all be restored for you!
‘Twas your gift, MIKE, ‘Twas your gift!
But your presence, that is all I need now from you!
Hold me back, MIKE, hold me back!
My rage boils, what this intruder did–

 MIKE ONEAL 5 
I didn’t know you could sing.

 FENWICK 
 (sings) 
I was saving it for a surprise.
I let you know not, avoiding lies.
So that love we have, never dies,
So full of newness, laughter and sighs–

 MIKE ONEAL 5 
You’re making up those songs as you go along, right?

 FENWICK 
 (still singing) 
Of course my own lyrics I sing.
Who else could write this sort of thing?
I could–

 INT–SIDE DOOR IN THE BEDROOM – NIGHT 

A door on the left side of the room opens and HAGGIS steps through. He is wearing a lavender uniform jacket with a puffy pink shirt and red trousers with flared cuffs. His long, reddish-blond hair is curled and piled high. Behind him are several soldiers with guns. They are wearing lavender uniforms and red fur hats.

 HAGGIS 
The intruder alarm was sounded. Who is–

He sees the AH.COM crew.

 MIKE ONEAL 5 
We were…discussing…things.
We were just about to…alert you.

 FENWICK 
 (singing) 
See what the intruders did to our art!
How they rended and ripped apart–

 HAGGIS 
Would you stop singing??

 FENWICK 
 (still singing) 
I do sing very well
and I do my feelings tell
I cannot stop my techniques of lore
Nothing can these feelings quell.
These–

 HAGGIS 
Enough! That’s enough singing!
My ears are already ringing!
There’s charges we’ll be bringing!
 (Pause) 
Oh, no, now he’s got me doing it! Now stop it!
 (Turns to the soldiers.) 
Arrest all of them!

 MATT 
Why are we being arrested?

 HAGGIS 
You failed to stop these intruders
from coming in! Come along–

The AH.COM crew cocks their guns and prepares to open fire.

 DMA 
Who are you people?

 HAGGIS 
 (much calmer) 
I’m HAGGIS, these are MIKE ONEAL 5 and
FENWICK, my underlings. We are
soldiers in the French Indigenous Legion.
I am bound to ask who you are.

 GBW 
We’re visitors from a parallel universe,
we’re looking for porn and booze, and
two of our friends got kidnapped and
we want them back.

 HAGGIS 
A likely story.

 GBW 
I can tell you exactly where in the
sky to find our spaceship if you want.

 MIKE ONEAL 5 
We do have a lovely observatory on the
roof of our estate, if you boys would like–

 HAGGIS 
Never mind that. Why are you looking
for your friends in this bedroom?

 GBW 
DOCTOR WHAT has been kidnapped by DARKLING
and IRON YUPPIE has been kidnapped by JUSTIN PICKARD.

 HAGGIS 
And that makes sense because…?

 HERMANUBIS 
We have maps to tunnels leading from this estate to both
DARKLING’s headquarters and JUSTIN PICKARD’s
headquarters. We took a wrong turn and didn’t mean
to intrude on these two.

 HAGGIS 
Well, it’s my duty to take you to DARKLING and
let him decide what to do with you.

 DAVE HOWERY 
But we have a map which shows the
underground passage from here to
JUSTIN PICKARD’s headquarters!
Wouldn’t you like to get there?

 HAGGIS 
But I could just shoot you and get the map.

 GBW 
But we’d shoot back and just ruin
this lovely bedroom and the objets
d’art these guys have collected.

 FENWICK 
Never your dares! I spent many
a year collecting these wares!

 MIKE ONEAL 5 
Oh, let’s do go visit JUSTIN PICKARD instead!
I just can’t wait to see the look on his face!

HERMANUBIS, reading the map, leads them out the other door, through a second door, down a sloping passageway, deeper and deeper, until the walls are no longer polished woodwork. Light is provided by fluorescent bulbs on the ceiling. The floor is bare concrete, and the bare stone walls are dripping with moisture. They continue walking.

Suddenly, footsteps are heard and everybody stops at an intersection of corridors. Around a corner marches ADAM with twenty soldiers wearing fluorescent ivory colored bodysuits.

 ADAM 
I am ADAM, representing the
Portuguese government in Canada.

 HAGGIS 
Canada is French!

ADAM pulls a packet out of his uniform jacket and hands it to HAGGIS, who opens it and reads it, allowing the others to read it as well.

 ADAM 
The Empire of France has just traded
Canada for Portuguese West Africa.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Those sneaky Frenchmen!

 ADAM 
 (shrugs) 
It’s a living. At least now we won’t have
to fight the British and risk damaging the
fine historic architecture of our fair city.

 FENWICK 
I for one will welcome our
new Portuguese overlords.

 ADAM 
 (indicating the AH.COM crew) 
Are these prisoners of yours?

 HAGGIS 
Not exactly. We’re rescuing friends of theirs
from DARKLING and JUSTIN PICKARD.

 ADAM 
We will have to split up, then.

ADAM and half of his men accompany FENWICK, with HERMANUBIS, DAVE HOWERY, GBW, OTHNEIL, and KIT to DARKLING’s headquarters.

HAGGIS and MIKE ONEAL 5 goes with half of ADAM’s men, with WEAPON M, MATT, and DMA, to JUSTIN PICKARD’s headquarters.

 INT–MAIN ROOM IN THE MANSION OF JUSTIN PICKARD – EVENING 

The lights brighten suddenly.

JUSTIN PICKARD enters the room. His tired, angry, his clothes are unkempt, his hair is uncombed and one side of his torso is encased in a cast. His aide, HANK FLETCHER, approaches and bows.

 HANK FLETCHER 
We have not yet found the woman
or her rescuer. They are still loose.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Continue looking!
I want them captured alive!

HANK FLETCHER exits a door.

 INT–A STAIRWELL 

We see HANK FLETCHER descending the staircase, accompanied by several soldiers.

 INT–THE BASEMENT – DAY 

A round section of wall glows bright red, then melts, and the AH.COM crew and the others step through, into the basement. WEAPON M puts his gun back into its holster. They walk toward the staircase and stop, confronted by HANK FLETCHER, with twenty soldiers behind him.

HANK FLETCHER snaps his fingers and both sides start firing weapons.

[B[INT - DARKLING&apos;S HEADQUARTERS – NIGHT

The gold-colored ceiling is decorated with a map of the world, with the borders, rivers and place names outlined with various colors of fiber optic cable which provides the light for the room. The carpet looks like an Impressionist painting of some erotic scene which takes up the entire floor, so it’s difficult to get a good look at what it actually represents. The reddish purple walls are covered with silk and polyester mosaics, collages and statuary.

DARKLING is standing in front of his desk. which is covered with papers. He is wearing a white puffy shirt, with red, white and green plaid trousers with flared cuffs.

Two of his underlings, NEK and REDEM, have just entered the room. They are wearing black leather jackets with black polyester pants.

 NEK 
You summoned us?

 DARKLING 
I have just received word that our
fine Emperor has just found a way
to end our dispute with Britain once
and for all.

 NEK 
This is wonderful!
Victory for us at last!

 DARKLING 
He has traded Canada for
Portugal’s holdings in Africa!

 REDEM 
This is terrible! I don’t want to go to Africa!

 DARKLING 
You will stay here.

 NEK 
That’s wonderful! I won’t have to
adjust or learn anything new, or–

 DARKLING 
You will have to learn all you can about
the Portuguese language and their
bureaucracy. You are now Portuguese!

 REDEM 
Terrible! I’m no linguist!

 DARKLING 
French will still be
allowed to be spoken.

 REDEM 
This is excellent! In the chaos of the transition,
Quebec will rise and split off from Canada once and for all–

 DARKLING 
The Partie Quebecois shall have to submit
its claim to King LEEJ of Portugal.

 REDEM 
That’s terrible! LEEJ does nothing
but procrastinate, obfuscate, predicate,
complicate, irradiate–

 DARKLING 
Never mind about that! Just go
and guard the entrances!

NEK and REDEM leave.

 INT–A TUNNEL – NIGHT 

 HERMANUBIS 
According to the map, the main lobby is
on the other side of this wall. We can
access the computer systems and reprogram
one of the cyborgs to open the servos
which rotate this wall and allow us in.

 DMA 
How about using a BFG?

 HERMANUBIS 
Well, sure, that would work,
if you’d rather do it that way…

 DMA 
Stand back, everybody.

Everybody runs back several yards, as DMA lifts his BFG and fires, making a nice big round hole and the corridor fills with dust. For about half a minute nothing but grey-blue dust is seen, then a few shadowy figures are moving around, and muffled sounds are heard until the dust clears.

 INT–LOBBY IN DARKLING’S PALACE 

NEK and REDEM enter the lobby with a number of guards just as HAGGIS, FENWICK and their AH.COM friends enter.

Nobody bothers to say anything. The firefight erupts immediately.

OTHNEIL ducks back to a back wall, sneaks into a corridor and wanders along. He stops at a corner. Ahead he sees a door with a guard in front. He hesitates, then slouches, trying to look as if he is barely aware of his surroundings. He sucks his thumb, drooling a bit. He begins to walk slowly along the corridor. As he passes the guard, the guard lifts a hand.

 THE LONE AMIGO 
What are you doing here?

OTHNEIL ignores the question. After a moment he lifts his gaze to stare into THE LONE AMIGO’s face.

 THE LONE AMIGO 
Now, who’d be dumb enough to
send a retard to try and distract–

As THE LONE AMIGO speaks, OTHNEIL sticks a finger up his nostril. THE LONE AMIGO instinctively looks away in disgust.

 INT–CORRIDOR 

SLOW MOTION AS

OTHNEIL grabs the guard’s gun and tosses it down the corridor. As THE LONE AMIGO looks down at his now empty holster, OTHNEIL grabs him by the waist, lifts him and falls back with THE LONE AMIGO on top of him. The guard squirms to get out of OTHNEIL’s grasp as OTHNEIL grabs the guard’s electronic key, presses the red button, and the cell door opens. DOCTOR WHAT leaps out the door, lands on the guard’s gun, grabs it, and fires a warning shot into the air. THE LONE AMIGO stops struggling, and sits on the floor, looking at OTHNEIL with utter disgust.

SLOW MOTION SEQUENCE ENDS

 OTHNEIL 
 (jumping up and down, waving his hands in the air.) 
Yay! I did it!

 DOCTOR WHAT 
You, guard, get in the cell! I need that key, OTHNEIL.

OTHNEIL hands DOCTOR WHAT the key as THE LONE AMIGO goes into the cell and closes the door behind him.

DOCTOR WHAT locks the door, and OTHNEIL follows him down the corridor to where the firefight has just ended.

 INT–DARKLING’S PALACE LOBBY – NIGHT 

The palace lobby is in the style of a very fancy old-fashioned European hotel. Light is provided by chandeliers, but the chandeliers use fiber optic cables. And everything is covered with dust and bodies, the result of the latest gunfight.

 DARKLING 
How nice of you to open up
a new doorway into my hotel.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I’m sure your cyborg pals
won’t mind cleaning up the dust.

 DARKLING 
I suppose I could use the opportunity
to test my latest cybernetic developments.
But I won’t bother. Just why are you here?

 DOCTOR WHAT 
My friends were helping me
gather information on this place.
And now we’d like to leave.

 INT–AH.COM SHIP LOUNGE – EVENING 

LUAKEL comes in and hands copies of his script to PSYCHOMELTDOWN and FLOCCULENCIO.

He sits down as they begin reading, with serious expressions.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
This is a fascinating character study.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Pretty good dramatic situations.

 MICHAEL 
Very subtle use of metaphor and irony.

 LUAKEL 
It’s supposed to be a comedy!

 G.BONE 
Listen, Luakel. People who read porn don’t
care about complex .characters and deep plots.
They want one-dimensional characters and
emphasis on body parts. Lots of description
of body parts.

 LUAKEL 
Oh. Body parts. Okay. I got it.
Lots and lots of body parts.

LUAKEL leaves the room.

 INT – AH.COM SHIP–LOUNGE – DAY 

LUAKEL comes in with another script and he hands copies to the others.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (reading) 
“Her popliteus glistened in the soft
moonlight. Her soft philtrum…”
 (Pauses) 
Her who and her what?

 LEO CAESIUS 
The popliteus is the back of the knee.
The philtrum is little groove below your
nose and above your upper lip.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (reading) 
The hair on her scalp radiated sexily as she
whispered throatily…is throatily a word?

 MICHAEL 
 (grinning) 
It is now.

 G.BONE 
Her adorable larynx vibrated alluringly as she murmured
wondrously at the luscious pores veneering his epidermis…
Is veneering a word?

 DIAMOND 
 (laughing) 
It is now.

 LUAKEL 
You said to put in lots of body parts.

 G.BONE 
Where did you get all these words?

 LUAKEL 
From Torqumada’s lair–I found
a copy of Gray’s anatomy.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
 (Continues reading.) 
She huskily whispered into
his manly pinna…his what??

 LUAKEL 
 (hastily reading the entry in the glossary at the back of the book) 
The pinna is…the ear is actually what’s inside your head.
The thing everybody calls an ear is actually called the pinna.
 (Looks up at the others) 
That’s what it says here.

 INT. – AH.COM SHIP – MED BAY– DAY 

FLOCCULENCIO and PSYCHOMELTDOWN are holding LUAKEL between them. FLOCCULENCIO hands TORQUMADA a copy of Gray’s anatomy.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Promise us you won’t lend
him Gray’s anatomy any more.

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Does anybody else find
that strangely arousing?

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Shut up. Psycho.

 INT–DARKLING’S PALACE LOBBY – NIGHT 

DARKLING and his soldiers are facing the others, and everybody has their guns out, except for OTHNEIL and GBW, who are admiring a display case of objects d’art, and discussing it.

 DARKLING 
You can come quietly, or you can–

DARKLING is interrupted by the entrance of JUSTIN PICKARD and a whole bunch of soldiers, and a firefight erupts. OTHNEIL and GBW hide behind the display case which amazingly suffers no damage during the melee.

During a pause in the fighting, JUSTIN PICKARD stands up on a table.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Listen! Listen, everyone!
We are willing to suggest a deal–

JUSTIN PICKARD is interrupted by the entrance of a swarm of small, flying robots from the tunnel entrance. Chaos erupts as everybody is shooting at everybody else. The flying robots begin to spin adhesive cables around the room, and after a few minutes the guns are out of ammunition and everybody is tangled up in the cables.

 INT–TUNNEL ENTRANCE – NIGHT 

IRON YUPPIE and LANDSHARK enter the lobby.

 LANDSHARK 
We’re back!

IRON YUPPIE and LANDSHARK go to stand with the others.

 HERMANUBIS 
Hello, everyone. I hope you’re quite through
vandalizing my new palace lobby.

 DARKLING 
What is the meaning of this?

 HERMANUBIS 
This has been my nefarious plans all
these years. Finally it has come to be.
I’m here to take over, and stop the British
and French from fighting. Their computer
systems are even now being taken over
by my robot army.

 GBW 
Were you using computer viruses?

 HERMANUBIS 
Yes, I use many computer viruses. I also
use computer bacteria, computer worms,
computer spiders, computer bugs, banners,
forks, crackers, hats, cloaks, streams, roots,
parasites, caterpillars and algae.

 JUSTIN PICKARD 
Where did you get those?

 HERMANUBIS 
My spies obtain them from many sources,
including your headquarters. Also from the
headquarters of ALT HOWERY, DARKLING,
and lots of other people. And now I can now
dictate terms to both sides and soon will rule
all of North America.

 HAGGIS 
 (stepping forward to face HERMANUBIS) 
I for one welcome our new–

 HERMANUBIS 
Yeah, yeah, you can be my new liaison.
And as a reward for helping, you AH.COM
guys can have some beer and porn.
Robots! Code 17-H!

The robots begin winding up the adhesive cables, and two of them fly off into another room. They come back with a bin full of beer and porn for the AH.COM crew.




 END ACT II 



 
 

 TAG 



 
 

 INT–AH.COM LOUNGE – MORNING 

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Let’s see that porn we finally got!

GBW puts the tape in the VCR and sits down with the others.

 MICHAEL 
This looks like an infomercial.

 LUAKEL 
All talk and no action.
Get to the action!
I want to see boobies!

 DMA 
We don’t want to see faces without makeup!
This is the worse porn I’ve seen in hours.

 MICHAEL 
 (fustrated) 
Who cares about the history of the furniture!

 LUAKEL 
What else do they have?

GBW takes the tape out and puts in another one. He sits down.

FOCUS ON the TV. The video shows THE SANDMAN and DANIELB1 as androgynous mimes, dressed in black and white coveralls, acting out erotic scenes on opposite sides of a blackened stage. The background music is wacky and humorous, interspersed with the laughter of a studio audience.

 MICHAEL 
 (screaming) 
NEXT!

GBW leaps to the TV and changes the tape again. He sits back down.

 FLOCCULENCIO 
Why are all the colors so weird?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Actually, this video appears to be a fascinating blend
of infrared, ultraviolet, ultrasonics, thermal emission
spectrographic readings, subsonic interference patterns…

 LANDSHARK 
Next!

 DIAMOND 
Where are the forks??

 TEASER 



 INT. AH.COM SHIP–CONTROL ROOM–DAY 

The camera pans across the room, showing most of the crew at their stations. A view of yet another Earth is on the view screen.

 DR. WHAT 
So, LEO, what’s the scoop on this timeline?

 LEO CAESIUS 
The technology of this timeline is a solid class E.
No real spacecraft beyond satellites and a handful
of shuttles. Pollutionis still a problem, no nuclear
fusion yet. However… the population seems to
have an imbalance. Women outnumber men on
the planet at a ratio of 4 to 1. And most of the men
are in poor health, with severe dehydration and
exhaustion being common.

The crew all look at each other uneasily.

 MATT 
Um… it’s not another world with cannibal
supermodels, is it? Because that one sucked…
no one got laid there. Not even me!

 LEO CAESIUS 
No, it’s not that. Hmmm…. My scans seem to
show that the women of this world are inflicted
with a severe form of nymphomania. It seems
to have been caused by a side affect of biological
warfare. The men who survive are simply being
screwed to death…. Hello?

A rumbling sound is heard off camera. The camera switches views to show a wide angle view of the room. KIT is looking around in confusion; he’s all alone. The doors are wide open, and a trail of litter leads there, obviously left in the wake of a mass rush to them.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- TELEPORTATION ROOM- DAY 

G BONE is seen sitting at his station in here, reading a Power Girl comic book.

 G BONE 
Oh man, look at those bazooms.

He looks around in curiosity as a low rumbling sound is heard. He gets up and walks around, looking at the equipment. The rumbling sound gets louder and louder, and the room starts to shake. As G BONE looks around in panic, the doors to the room open, and nearly all the crew of the ship are seen running inside towards the teleporter pad. G BONE screams in fear as the crowd threatens to trample him, but they stop just in time, and start demanding all at once to be sent down to the planet.

 WEAPON M 
I’m going! I bet I could have a threesome on this world!
Or… dare I even dream about it… a foursome!
 (shivers in delight) 

 DR. WHAT 
No, you can’t all go at once! Only a select few to be a
welcoming committee. And of course, as captain, I must go!

 LEO CAESIUS 
Hey, guys, you really should know that…

 HENDRYK 
Hey, G BONE, just put me down in the middle of downtown Canton…

 MICHAEL 
I don’t care where you send me, so long as there are women there…
any women at all… but no red headed ones please…

 LEO CAESIUS 
Guys, you really ought to see this…

 TORQUMADA 
Put me down in Florida! Sweet Vicky, here I come!!

 LUAKEL 
Ooh, can I have a girl too?! Please?!

 DR. WHAT 
Sorry, kid, we can’t contribute to the delinquency of a minor.
Plus, you cramp my style when you’re hanging around.

 LUAKEL 
 (muttering) 
Bastards.

A piercing whistle emits from LEO CAESIUS’S speakers, and everyone covers their ears in pain. It sounds for only a few seconds, and then stops.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Now that I have your attention, guys,
you really need to return to your stations.
A vortex just opened up… and someone
we know just popped out of it.

The crew grumbles, but most of them leave the room. G BONE, alone again, sits back down and picks up his comic book.

 G BONE 
Ah, back to Power Girl. Oh man, look at those bazooms…

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

The doors open, and the crew members are seen filing back into the room. The camera pans around, and we see KIT still at his station.

 KIT 
About time you lot came back. Look, the prodigal son returns…

 DR. WHAT 
What the hell are you talking…

His gaze wanders to the view screen, and his eyes widen in surprise.
The camera switches to a close up view of the view screen, and a shuttle is seen on it. The name “MYNX” is clearly seen on the side.

 DR. WHAT 
Oh my God… OTHNIEL! He’s found us. KIT, can you contact him?

 KIT 
Already done…

The view screen changes to an interior shot of the shuttle. OTHNIEL is seen sitting at the controls. DR. WHAT grins at him.

 DR. WHAT 
OTHNIEL! It’s good to see you again.
 (beat) 
So… did you find him?

OTHNIEL doesn’t answer, but simply moves aside. Behind him, STRAHA is seen lying on a seat, bound hand and foot, and gagged. OTHNIEL moves back into his seat; he looks weary and haggard.

 OTHNIEL 
I did. But I have something I need to go over with
you as soon as I get back onboard. We may be in trouble.

 DR. WHAT 
Okay. LANDSHARK is clearing the docking bay for you now.

The view screen switches to an exterior space shot again, and the MYNX is seen moving off the camera scene.

 DR. WHAT 
My God. He did it… he actually did it. He tracked STRAHA
across the timelines and found him and captured him.

 GREY WOLF 
So… now what? What do we do with him?

 DR. WHAT 
I… don’t know. I never really expected to have to deal with this.
 (long pause) 
Maybe the best thing to do would be to turn him over to IAN.
When it comes to the Fallen, we’re really out of our depth…
even if he used to be one of us.

 LANDSHARK 
That might be for the best… okay, the MYNX
is back on board. OTHNIEL should be…

 LEO CAESIUS 
WARNING! VORTEX OPENING!

Everyone looks back towards the view screen, and the camera switches to a close up shot of it. A vortex is seen opening up out in space, and a ship emerges from it. The ship is huge and of rectangular shape, with many missile silos, weapon bays, and communications gear on it. It is a ship we’ve seen before.

The Vendetta.

 ACT I 



 
 

 EXT. THE VENDETTA 

THE VENDETTA immediately opens fire on the AH.com

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

Everyone in the room is looking at the view screen with shocked expressions.

 DR. WHAT 
Oh shit. They found us again.
 (pause) 
I knew this day would come, but I hoped….

He turns to face the others, a grim look on his face.

 DR. WHAT 
Red alert! All hands to battle stations! LEO, put up the shields!
DAVE, get ready to shift out of this timeline ASAP!

The first wave of VENDETTA weapons SLAM into the AH.com hull.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Direct hit on shield generator! Shields at 20%!
20% of all ship weapon bays are offline!

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (on intercom) 
Doc, the shift engines took a major surge and went offline!
Can’t shift until I can replace some power units on it.

 DR. WHAT 
Damn it! Can’t shift out, can’t fight for long.
Only thing left to do is… run!

 EXT. AH.COM SHIP 

Thrusters flare and the AH.com ship turns away from the planet and jets away. The Vendetta lingers by the planet for a moment, then initiates pursuit.

 INT. AH.COM CONTROL ROOM 

LANDSHARK looks up from his console to DR. WHAT.

 LANDSHARK 
They’re gaining on us. We’ve
got a bit of a head start, but their
engines are far more powerful.
 (beat) 
Got any ideas?

 DR. WHAT 
Besides lose control of my bodily functions
due to fear?

He thinks for a moment, then snaps his fingers.

 DR. WHAT 
Take us into the asteroid belt.
We’ve still got most of our weapons, and I’ve
got an idea.

 EXT. AH.COM SHIP 

Different thrusters flare and the AH.com changes course. Behind it, we see the Vendetta gaining on them.

 INT. VENDETTA BRIDGE 

SBEGIN, TYRANNUSZERO, and EVIL MrP stand on the bridge, watching the big plasma-screen. The AH.com is ahead of them, but they’re quickly closing the distance.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
When we close with them, blast them
to bits. We’ll never give them the opportunity to
commit treachery again.

 EVIL MrP 
But shouldn’t we take at least
some prisoners?
 (beat) 
Give them a chance to accept the
Emperor’s grace?

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
No. We gave them a chance once and
lost one of our engines for it. No mercy this time.
 (beat) 
At least they didn’t have any LUAKELS
on that planet. No need for war there.

 EXT. AH.COM SHIP 

The AH.com ship passes into the asteroid field.

 INT. AH.COM CONTROL ROOM 

Everyone looks to DOCTOR WHAT.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Okay, here’s my plan.
We use our remaining weapons
to knock asteroids at them.
 (beat) 
I don’t think we’ll destroy them outright,
but we can buy time to repair our drive and get out of here.

 LANDSHARK 
That’s a good plan.
 (beat) 
Kind of surprised you came up with it.

 GBW 
Uh, DOC, that won’t…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Immediate danger has a way of
getting the mind off porn and booze.

 GREY WOLF 
We’re actually in the asteroid belt.
If they fire into the belt, they can knock asteroids
into us .

 GBW 
But, guys, this plan won’t…

 DOCTOR WHAT 
Well, we’ve got a lot of point-defense weapons.
Those should count for something.
 (beat) 
That also gives us incentive to knock as many asteroids
as quickly as possible at them.
 (beat) 
Good point, though. DAVE, how soon can we have the drive fixed?

The intercom is silent.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
I bet he and KEIRA are at it again.
Someone go fetch him.

 GBW 
But, guys, I’m telling you, this won’t…

 KIT 
Engineering is reporting in… they’re saying
DAVE HOWERY is back, and he’s armed to the teeth.

 DR. WHAT 
Whatever, just so he’s working on that drive.

 EXT. AH.COM SHIP 

The camera shows a view of the AH.COM putting on a burst of speed, heading out past Mars into space.

 INT. AH.COM CONTROL ROOM 

 DR. WHAT 
Okay, now let’s… wait a minute. Where are all the asteroids?

 GBW 
That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you, DOC. The asteroid belt
isn’t very dense, the ones big enough to see are millions of miles
apart. We could rocket around in here for days without encountering
any. Heck, when they used to send out those space probes to Jupiter
and Pluto, they’d send them right through the belt and none of them
ever hit anything.

 DR. WHAT 
But… in the movies, they always show hundreds of
them clustered together. Why would the movies lie?

 GBW 
Geez, DOC, don’t you know the difference
between movies and real life?

DR. WHAT looks at him for a long moment.

 DR. WHAT 
Of course I do!

 GBW 
Right. Anyway, the asteroid belt doesn’t have a lot of mass in it.
If you clumped it all together, it wouldn’t even be as big as the moon.
So, your plan isn’t going to work. We need to do something else…

 LANDSHARK 
Heads up! Something is coming into view.

The camera switches to the view screen as everyone looks towards it. A large and very bright object is seen. As the ship moves in closer, the object is seen to be a very large asteroid with a huge crater on it. Several other small asteroids are clumped around it.

 DR. WHAT 
What the hell is that?

 GBW 
That’s Vesta, the second largest asteroid in the system.
It’s about 330 miles in diameter, and got smacked by a
meteor or something in the past that gouged out a huge crater on it.

 MATT 
How the hell do you know all this stuff?

 GBW 
 (shrugs) 
Hey, you have to know all this to be a good pilot.

 LANDSHARK 
I didn’t know all that.

 GBW 
I said a good pilot.

 LANDSHARK 
Oh.
 (pause) 
Hey!
 (long pause) 
That was an insult!
 (long pause) 
Wasn’t it?

DR. WHAT looks at the view screen for a moment, deep in thought.

 DR. WHAT 
Got an idea. LANDSHARK, move in close to Vesta.
MATT, prepare all weapons.

 EXT- SPACE 

The AH.COM is seen making a course correction and moving towards Vesta. After a moment, the Vendetta enters the scene, pursuing the smaller ship and firing at it continuously.

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

DR. WHAT is seen looking anxiously at the view screen. On it, Vesta is seen getting closer and closer until it fills the whole screen.

 DR. WHAT 
All right, MATT, now!

 EXT- SPACE 

The AH.COM rockets past several small asteroids as it moves close to Vesta’s surface. Suddenly, it erupts in weaponry; particle beams fire, missiles fly, and a sheep is launched from one weapons bay, bleating pitifully. All of the weapons strike either the smaller asteroids or the surface of Vesta; the sheep splatters messily against one asteroid. In moments, a huge cloud of dust obscures the scene, and the AH.COM flies into it and disappears.

The Vendetta enters the scene. It slows momentarily, and then flies straight into the dust cloud.

The camera switches angles, and the Vendetta is seen exiting the far side of the cloud. It fires thrusters, and halts in space.

 INT- VENDETTA BRIDGE- DAY 

The camera opens with a shot of TYRANNUS ZERO. He looks puzzled, and stands up.
The camera switches angles to behind him, showing the view screen. Only empty space can be seen.

 SBEGIN 
But… that’s impossible! They couldn’t have moved so far so fast!

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Are they still hiding in the cloud? Or have they crashed on Vesta’s surface?

 CREWMAN 
No, sir. All scans are negative. The
AH.COM is not within scanning range.

A low laugh is heard from off camera.

 VOICE (o.c.) 
I told you they were clever.

TYRANNUS ZERO turns, an annoyed look on his face. The camera turns with him, and we see MIKE COLLINS standing at the back of the bridge, arms crossed insolently.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Silence, heretic. You are here at my whim only.
You promised to be helpful in chasing down this ship,
but they have eluded us in spite of you.

 MIKE COLLINS 
And I warned you not to underestimate them. Do not threaten me.
You need my help to find the AH.COM, and then deal with the Machine.
And I am not one to be threatened lightly.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
And the Machine? I am curious as to why one of
the legendary Fallen is so adamant about destroying it.
That is our sacred goal, required of us by the memory
of our slain Emperor. But what is your reason?

 MIKE COLLINS 
The Machine is too dangerous. It has destroyed whole worlds…
and if it falls into the hands of any of my rivals, it will give them
great power. Thus, I would see it destroyed to preserve my own status.

Unnoticed by the others, EVIL MRP’S eyes narrow in suspicion at these words, and a quick smile is seen on his face.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
We shall see. In the meantime, remove yourself from the bridge.
Go to the quarters I have given you, and wait for my call.

TYRANNUS ZERO turns his back, looking at the view screen again. MIKE COLLINS’ fists clench, and a quick look of anger washes across his face, but he turns and leaves the room. EVIL MRP looks around for a moment, and sees nobody watching him; he also leaves the room.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Move the ship away from Vesta. Program in a search grid between here
and Jupiter… and let us hope that some sign of the heretics’ ship is found.

 EXT- SPACE 

The Vendetta is seen moving away from Vesta into the open space beyond. The camera swings back towards the asteroid, and moves to the huge crater on it. The camera makes a long ‘flying’ sweep along the surface, over the rim of the crater, and then plunges down into it. The scene falls completely dark as the camera angle descends into the crater. After a moment, several small points of light are seen, which slowly grow as the camera moves closer, and we see that it is the AH.COM, parked at the bottom next to the wall of the crater.

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

The camera pans across the room, which is dimly lit with emergency lighting.

 MATT 
Whoa… I think this worked… they don’t
seem to have figured out where we are.

 GBW 
This is perfect! With the basalt and iron all around us, and
the fact that we’re 12 miles below the surface, they aren’t able to scan us.

 DR. WHAT 
Yet. We need to get repairs done, and then… I don’t know.

At this point, the doors open and DAVE HOWERY and KEIRA walk into the room. Both are heavily armed. DAVE has his two chainsaws strapped to his back, and KEIRA is loaded down with a flak jacket, helmet, shotgun, and a bandolier of shells across her torso. The gear barely fits her, and she is struggling to keep it in all in place as she walks.

 DR. WHAT 
Damn, DAVE, you look like you’re about to invade Gallipoli.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Hardy har. I’m not taking any chances this time,
if those armoured goons get aboard. So, what’s the plan now?

 DR. WHAT 
Well, we’ve bought ourselves some time, so let’s repair
the engines and weapon bays that were damaged.

 DAVE HOWERY 
How did they manage to find us again anyway?

 DR. WHAT 
That’s a good question…

DOCTOR WHAT turns to OTHNIEL.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
All right. Now that we’re relatively 
safe, you’ve got some explaining to do.

 OTHNIEL 
All right. Here’s what happened…

 FLASHBACK SEQUENCE BEGINS 

 EXT. MYNX 

The Mynx erupts from a vortex. It looks somewhat the worse for wear already.

 INT. MYNX COCKPIT 

OTHNIEL wipes the sweat from his brow.

 OTHNIEL 
Five times to shift in.
Something’s strange about
this TL.

He looks at the instrument panel.

 OTHNIEL 
Bingo.

 EXT- OUTSIDE THE MACHINE- DAY 

The camera opens on a scene of lush tropical foliage. The bushes and ferns are seen waving as something moves through them. Finally, two bushes are parted, and we see two figures step into view. One of them is MIKE COLLINS, mightiest of the Fallen. He looks around, dark sunglasses hiding his expression. The other is STRAHA; he is sweating and panting with effort.

 STRAHA 
Why did we have to land the ship so far away and walk so far?
And why was I dragged along while MOLOBO gets to stay back on the ship?

 MIKE COLLINS 
Idiot! You know perfectly well that MOLOBO is laid up with that case
of syphilis he picked up on that China Superpower timeline. And we are
walking in from this distance because the Machine has defences that would
tear up our ship in seconds. Besides, you really need the exercise, lard ass.

STRAHA looks wounded and opens his mouth to say something, but he is distracted by something off camera. His eyes go wide with surprise. MIKE COLLINS notices and looks in the same direction. He also looks stunned.

The camera switches to their POV. It shows a large circular area that has been blasted clear for nearly a mile across. Nothing grows in this region. In the center of this area, there is a huge rectangular building, big as a factory. It is hard to see details at the far distance, but the building is seen to have an enormous transparent tank at one end, filled with some yellowish liquid, and what looks like a tremendous tuning fork at the other end.

The camera switches back to MIKE COLLINS. He has a look of evil happiness on his face.

 MIKE COLLINS 
It does exist! At last, my plans near completion!

 STRAHA 
But why did they set it up on this God forsaken planet
that doesn’t have any people on it?

 MIKE COLLINS 
Because it doesn’t have any people on it, you moron!
No one to interfere with its operation, no one to threaten it.
And it’s so hard to shift into this timeline that most won’t
even try. But I am not as most men. Let’s get closer to it.

The two Fallen move out towards the Machine.

 EXT- LANDING ZONE- DAY 

The camera shows the IP.NET ship parked in a clear grassy zone, surrounded by jungle. The camera pans around the ship, and we see another ship behind it… the shuttle MYNX. It apparently has just landed, and the retro rocket exhausts are still smoking. The ramp lowers, and we see OTHNIEL walk down. The camera closes in on him. He glances around with a determined look on his face. He pulls a scanner out of one pocket and pushes a button. Waving it around in different directions, he pauses as it points to the east. He turns it off and starts walking in that direction. As he moves away, we see that he has what looks to be a rifle slung across his back.

 EXT- OUTSIDE THE MACHINE- DAY 

The camera switches back to a view of the Machine, but a much closer view this time. STRAHA and MIKE COLLINS walk into the camera view. Both look at the Machine closely.

The camera switches to their POV, and we see the Machine in its entirety. The transparent tank on one end is now seen to be a cloning tank. The yellowish liquid inside is semi-opaque, and dim humanoid figures can be seen inside it… dozens of them. The ones near the bottom are vague and misshapen, and they get more and more advanced as they go up, until the ones at the top seem to be perfectly formed. Several faintly seen figures at the very top of the tank are waving their arms out of the top of the liquid, as if trying to get out.

The camera pans along the building, and several weapons ports are seen on the side… rocket and missile launchers, Gatling type cannons, and ordinary mortar type artillery. As the camera nears the end of the building, it moves up, and we see the tuning fork standing up at the end.

The camera switches back to the two Fallen. STRAHA is looking at the Machine with wide eyes, while MIKE COLLINS is grinning nastily to himself.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Yes… it is just as I thought it would be. Now, we have to
find a way inside and figure out how to take control.

 STRAHA 
Why would anyone make such a thing? It seems rather pointless.

 MIKE COLLINS 
For destruction alone. Destruction is never pointless.
Whoever built this thing, I think I like them…

A loud buzzer is heard off camera, and the two look back at the Machine. The camera switches to their POV. The manipulator arms on the cloning tank are seen reaching down into the cloning tank and pulling out a wet naked LUAKEL clone. Apparently, its brain has not yet solidified, as it is looking around vaguely and babbling incoherently, a vacant smile on its face. The camera switches to the center of the building. A panel on the roof slides back, and another piece of equipment is seen rising out of the hatch. As it comes into view, we see it is… a giant slingshot.

The camera switches to the tuning fork at the far end of the building. A low humming sound is heard that gets louder and louder. With a crackling of energy, a blue vortex is formed between the arms of the fork. The camera switches back to the manipulator arms. One is holding the LUAKEL clone, while the other is pulling back the cup on the slingshot. The LUAKEL is put into the slingshot, and then the arms let go. With a loud “Wheeee!” the clone shoots straight into the vortex. Seconds later, the vortex disappears and the slingshot retracts into the building.

The camera switches back to the two Fallen, who are looking at the Machine in disbelief.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Such technological wonders combined with such a primitive delivery system.
Whoever built this must have been both genius and mad. I wonder if…

He pauses, and looks around as a door opens on the side of the building. Several huge lumbering figures shamble out of it, and head towards the two Fallen. As they get closer, we see that they are heavily modified LUAKEL clones, massively muscled and carrying huge clubs.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Ah, it seems our presence here has been noticed. Not to worry,
this lot will be easy to get rid of.

MIKE COLLINS starts to move towards the LUAKELS, but suddenly stops and looks up at the sky in puzzlement. He turns swiftly and shoves STRAHA away, then dives for cover himself. A screaming sound is heard off camera that gets louder and louder. An explosion rips through the LUAKELS. MIKE COLLINS sits up and looks; all that can be seen are bits and pieces of them scattered across the ground. A second explosion hits the side of the Machine, and destroys a Gatling weapon there. The Machine’s defences begin firing back at something overhead.

MIKE COLLINS looks up into the sky as a shadow passes over him.

 MIKE’S POV 
The sun shines brightly overhead, but a huge object is moving across it. Explosions dance against the shields surrounding it. It is a ship, rectangular in shape…the VENDETTA.

MIKE COLLINS looks on in fury as more explosions rock the Machine. None actually break through the walls, but the defenses on the outside are being destroyed one at a time.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Damn it, who are these idiots?! I’ll crush
them for interfering in my plans!

With a loud groan of hydraulics, the Machine moves. The two arms of the tuning fork on the front swivel down until they are perpendicular to the ground, pointing in front of the building. A huge blue vortex starts to form there. With a puff of smoke, booster rockets underneath the building fire up, and the entire Machine lifts into the air. It slowly moves forward to the vortex.

MIKE COLLINS turns to STRAHA, who is sprawled on the ground, looking at everything rather dazedly.

 MIKE COLLINS 
It’s shifting out of this timeline! Quick, make yourself useful
for once, and scan that vortex! We need the coordinates.

STRAHA looks on blankly for a moment, and then takes out a portable scanner. He aims it at the vortex and pushes some buttons. He looks up triumphantly at MIKE COLLINS.

 STRAHA 
Got it!

He grins for a moment, and then looks puzzled. His eyes roll back and he falls face down on the dirt. A tranquilizer dart is seen sticking out of the back of his neck.
The camera switches to a view of OTHNIEL. He raises the tranquilizer rifle he carries, obviously having just fired it. He grins.

The camera switches back to the Machine. It moves slowly towards the vortex, and then enters it, vanishing from sight. The vortex closes seconds later.

The camera switches to MIKE COLLINS, who is looking on in fury.

 MIKE COLLINS 
I should have known one of you AH.COM losers would turn up here.
Well, boy, you stepped in it this time. I’m going to send what’s left
of you back to your ship in a matchbox.

He lunges at OTHNIEL. OTHNIEL frantically starts to reload his tranquilizer gun, as MIKE COLLINS closes in on him. Suddenly, several figures shimmer into view around the three. MIKE COLLINS finds himself facing a trio of space marines with bolters. OTHNIEL looks up straight into the face of sergeant LEEJ. The latter looks at him thoughtfully for a moment, and then a look of fury goes across his face.

 LEEJ 
You! One of the crew of that damned AH.COM!
A heretic who consorts with LUAKELS!

LEEJ hauls out his chainsword and starts it up. But a series of screams and yells behind him draws his attention. The camera switches to his POV. MIKE COLLINS is holding up one space marine by his neck (the marine’s helmet has been cracked in two) , throttling him slowly with one hand. The other two marines lie motionless on the ground. LEEJ runs at him, chainsword at the ready. MIKE COLLINS grins nastily as the marine’s neck breaks with a horrible crack, and then he throws the limp body at LEEJ. The flying corpse hits the sergeant, and he goes down hard.

MIKE COLLINS looks around to see OTHNIEL trying to drag STRAHA away. He moves forward angrily.

 MIKE COLLINS 
PUT HIM DOWN, BOY!

OTHNIEL drops STRAHA and again tries to reload the tranquilizer gun. MIKE COLLINS’ hands curl into fists as he stalks forward. But again, four space marines shimmer into view around him. MIKE COLLINS snarls in fury and smashes a fist right through the face plate of the helmet and into the face of one of them; with a horrid melon squashing sound, the marine goes down. The other three draw their chainswords and move to attack.

MIKE COLLINS dodges a swing and grabs the wrist of that marine, squeezing it mercilessly. The wrist bones are heard to crack, and the chainsword falls to the ground. MIKE COLLINS picks it up and disembowels the marine with it. He then blocks a blow from a second marine. He backs up as the two marines close in on him, fencing with them as they strike blows. He is obviously far stronger than they are, and parries their attacks with ease.

After a moment, the two marines split up, moving to each side of him. MIKE COLLINS grins, not looking worried at all. The two marines dart in, each swinging blows. MIKE COLLINS parries one blow, and grabs the arm of the other marine. Pulling him off balance, MIKE COLLINS swings his own chainsword and decapitates the marine.
The other marine backs off, and we get a clear look at him; it is sergeant NEK. He looks grim, but determined. MIKE COLLINS advances towards him, an arrogant and contemptuous look on his face.

The two settle into fencing stances and circle each other. Both dart in, striking blows, parrying, and dodging return blows. After a while, it becomes obvious that NEK is skillful, but simply no match for MIKE COLLINS. After a series of ineffectual blows, MIKE COLLINS finally manages to grab NEK’S wrist and immobilize the chainsword. His other hand drops his own chainsword and tears the helmet from NEK’S head. MIKE COLLINS grabs NEK by the throat and squeezes. NEK is slowly lifted up into the air, his feet dangling off the ground.

 MIKE COLLINS 
You are brave and strong. I respect that.
Not enough to stop from killing you though.

NEK chokes and beats his free hand feebly against the hand slowly throttling him. His eyes roll back, and he starts to go limp. MIKE COLLINS snarls in triumph, but a loud roar of rockets firing distracts him. He looks behind him

 MIKE’S POV 
Far off in the distance, the MYNX shuttle is seen rising into the sky.

MIKE COLLINS roars in fury. He throws NEK away from him.

NEK flies through the air and hits the dirt, hard. After a long moment, he takes a breath. He’s still alive.

MIKE COLLINS runs towards where he left his ship. Suddenly, he skids to a stop. The air shimmers in front of him and suddenly twenty SPACE MARINES appear, bolters pointed straight at him. MIKE COLLINS looks around at them, and then back to the sky.

 MIKE’S POV 
The MYNX leaps up into the sky with a flash of booster rockets. It soon moves out of sight.

MIKE COLLINS slowly takes the sunglasses off his face. He has a look of contempt and amusement on his face. He flexes his fingers and cracks his knuckles as he looks around at the space marines surrounding him.

 MIKE COLLINS 
So… which of you wants to die first?

 FLASHBACK SEQUENCE ENDS 

 INT. AH.COM CONTROL ROOM 

DR. WHAT looks at OTHNIEL.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
So you’ve got the coordinates to the current location
of the LUAKEL machine?
 (beat) 
The thing those guys are trying to destroy?

OTHNIEL nods.

DOCTOR WHAT looks at him for a moment. Then he lunges, leaping on top of him.

Everyone looks at DOCTOR WHAT like he’s gone mad.

 DOCTOR WHAT 
If we can give this info to them,
we might be able to get out of this alive.

 MATT 
But they wrecked the lounge!

 DAVE HOWERY 
And one of them tried to molest KEIRA!

 WEAPON M 
Not to mention last time we tried to cut
a deal with them, you backstabbed them and tried to blow
them up.

 DR. WHAT 
Damn it, that’s… true. Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.
There must be some way to make use of this information. All we
need to do is get it to the Vendetta somehow.

 GBW 
Well, we really can’t tell them directly, since they’d probably
shoot at us if we show ourselves. But maybe we can lead them
to it another way. What if we just move out of here, head towards
Earth, and shift to the Machine’s timeline on the way. The
Vendetta is bound to see and chase us, and follow us there.
Then, they’ll see the Machine, destroy it, and go home,
and never bother us again.

 DR. WHAT 
Wow, that’s… clever.

 GBW 
Of course… it’s me.

Most of the crew laughs in derision.

 DR. WHAT 
Well, at least we have a plan now. DAVE,
get started on repairs immediately,and
LANDSHARK, plot a course that’ll take us
out of here and straight back to Earth.
 (pause) 
This is going to be a tricky one to plan, but
we gotta do it and do it right.We’re only going
to get one shot at getting out of here.

 MATT 
We have another problem to deal with too,
DOC. What do we do with STRAHA?

 DR. WHAT 
 (sighs) 
Put him in the brig for now. Have DMA keep guard on him.

 INT- VENDETTA CREW QUARTERS- DAY 

The camera pans across a bare Spartan room, with only a bed, a footlocker, and a mirror and wash basin. MIKE COLLINS enters the room; he looks very angry, with fists clenched and bared teeth. He takes a deep breath, and then goes over to the basin and splashes water on his face. After towelling off, he turns around and starts in surprise. The camera switches to his POV, and we see EVIL MRP standing there, a smirk on his face.

 EVIL MRP 
You are lying, COLLINS.

 MIKE COLLINS 
About what? And how would you know anyway?

 EVIL MRP 
Your thoughts are open to me. You have no intention
of destroying the Machine, and hope to capture it for yourself.

 MIKE COLLINS 
So, you’re some kind of telepath, huh? I hate telepaths.

MIKE COLLINS strides forward, and EVIL MRP waves one hand towards him. MIKE COLLINS does slow momentarily, but he simply wades through the psychic attack and grabs EVIL MRP by the throat. He lifts the psyker off the floor and chokes him. EVIL MRP beats feebly against the arm holding him, and then gasps out a few words.

 EVIL MRP 
You… no… understand… want… to… help… you!

MIKE COLLINS lets EVIL MRP drop to the floor; the psyker staggers back, gasping for breath.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Help me? Why? From everything I’ve heard about you people,
you are utter fanatics when it comes to destroying the Machine.

 EVIL MRP 
Even fanaticism wears thin after a while. The crew is growing sick
of this mission. Dozens of timeline Earths destroyed, billions of lives
taken… after a while, it grates on your soul. Even the captain is
becoming weary of the endless slaughter. He hides it well from
everyone… except me. Also… there is one aboard the AH.COM
whom I would have spared.

MIKE COLLINS looks at him a moment, and then sneers slightly.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Man or woman?

 EVIL MRP 
A woman. A goddess.

MIKE COLLINS laughs.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Oh my nonexistent God! You have a thing for that
artificial woman that DAVE HOWERY found!

 EVIL MRP 
She’s not artificial! She’s a real breathing person!

 MIKE COLLINS 
Who was really created in a cloning tank.
But enough of that. So, what are you offering me here?

 EVIL MRP 
A trade in services. You help me obtain KEIRA
and I’ll help you capture the Machine.

 MIKE COLLINS 
I’m not sure that you can help me. But… the powers
of a telepath could be useful. Very well, I accept your offer.

 EVIL MRP 
Oddly enough, I can tell that you’re sincere. Luckily for you.
 (pause) 
It sounds like you know about KEIRA. How did she end up
on board that ship? And how did she end up with
DAVE HOWERY, of all people?

 MIKE COLLINS 
 (smirks) 
My, you got it bad, don’t you? Well, STRAHA told me the story,
and it’s actually a pretty good one. It all started when the ship
found its way to a planet that was one big LARP game…

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

The camera opens on OTHNIEL, who is sitting at a station and looking at a monitor; a list on it is scrolling up and down. HENDRYK comes into the scene and looks at OTHNIEL in puzzlement.

 HENDRYK 
Why are you at my station? And what are you looking for?

 OTHNIEL 
I’m going through the inventory lists,
seeing if there is anything we can use
against the Vendetta. Hey, these 20
cases of sonic grenades could be handy.

 HENDRYK 
Uh… actually, those are 20 cases of DR. WHAT’S porn.
He uses ‘sonic grenade’ as a code word.

 OTHNIEL 
Oh. And what about those six boxes of rocket launchers?

 HENDRYK 
Those are something that belongs to KIT, but I’ve always
been afraid to find out just what they actually are.

 OTHNIEL 
Dare I ask what the 20 spacesuits are?

 HENDRYK 
Those are really spacesuits, part of the ship’s original inventory.
Never been able to find a buyer for them.

OTHNIEL leans back wearily and rubs his eyes.

 OTHNIEL 
Well, darn it, I’m not having any luck here.
Hopefully the others are doing better than me.

The camera switches to DR. WHAT sitting in his chair; he is turning off a communicator switch.

 DR. WHAT 
DAVE says the engines are ready to go. All we need
now is to get out of here. Now… what do we do about
that problem of shifting into the timeline of the Machine?

 OTHNIEL 
There is a way around that. The Machine puts out a dampening field
that surrounds the Earth and partway out into space. Most people try
to shift near Earth and thus have problems getting to this timeline.
However, all we need to do is shift in away from Earth and move
in closer. That’s what MIKE COLLINS did, according to STRAHA.

 DR. WHAT 
Great! Everything is in place now. Okay, everyone get
to your stations. And hang on; this is going to be bumpy.

 EXT- AH.COM SHIP 

The camera shows the AH.COM lying on the bottom of the crater, with few lights showing. Suddenly, the ship lights up all over the hull. With a puff of boosters firing, the ship lifts into the air.

 EXT- VESTA 

The camera opens on a wide shot of the crater on Vesta. After a moment, the AH.COM is seen emerging from the darkness, flying straight towards the camera at high speed.

 INT- VENDETTA BRIDGE 

A crewman at a monitoring station stops what he is doing, looking at a screen in surprise.

 CREWMAN 
Sir! The heretics’ ship just appeared on scanners.
They were hiding on Vesta after all.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Pursuit course. Don’t let them get away this time.
And summon MIKE COLLINS to the bridge.

 EXT- SPACE 

The camera shows a wide shot of empty space. The AH.COM appears from lower screen and rapidly moves off camera. Moments later, the Vendetta appears, pursuing.

 INT- AH.COM BRIDGE- DAY 

DR. WHAT is seen sitting in his chair, looking intently at a gauge on his arm panel. He toggles a comm switch on.

 DR. WHAT 
Okay, DAVE, we’re close enough…
fire up the shift engines now!

 EXT- SPACE 

The AH.COM slows down for a moment, and a vortex appears in front of it. The ship flies ahead and disappears into the vortex.

 INT- VENDETTA BRIDGE- DAY 

TYRANNUS ZERO is watching the view screen; his eyes narrow in anger when the vortex appears.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Scan that vortex and match the coordinates for our own shift.
The heretics will not escape us that easily.

 EXT- SPACE 
The camera shows a scene of empty space. A vortex opens, and the AH.COM flies out of it, and quickly powers up to full speed.

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

DR. WHAT is seen looking anxiously at the view screen.

 DR. WHAT 
LEO, anything you can pick up on the scanners yet?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Earth is coming into range. There appears to be no signs of technology in orbit…
no satellites, no radio or television signals. The planet itself is surrounded by an
energy field that prevents deep scanning. But visual scanners can detect no cities
or lights anywhere. This does appear to be a place where intelligent life never developed.

 DR. WHAT 
Just like Philadelphia. So, it’s a good bet that this is the
current timeline of the Machine. Let’s get close enough to find it.

 LANDSHARK 
Heads up, guys! The Vendetta just came in.

 EXT- SPACE 

The AH.COM flies across the screen. Far behind it, a vortex can be seen closing. Moments later, the Vendetta appears from lower screen, flying across the screen.

 INT- VENDETTA BRIDGE- DAY 

The camera opens with a shot on the doors. They open, and MIKE COLLINS, followed by EVIL MRP, enters the room.

 MIKE COLLINS 
 (glancing at view screen) 
So, you have found them.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Yes, and they have fled to this timeline, right in front of us.
It’s almost as if they wanted us to follow them.

 EVIL MRP 
Do you suspect a trap?

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Perhaps… but nothing has happened yet.
 (to crewman) 
What is on the scanners?

 CREWMAN 
No sign of any other ships. The Earth in this timeline
seems to be a primitive one, there is no sign of…
 (pause) 
Sir! The Machine is here! The same dampening
field surrounds the planet!

The camera switches back to TYRANNUS ZERO, who first looks surprised, and then he smiles wryly.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
They are indeed clever. No doubt, they are hoping
that we will turn from the pursuit and destroy the Machine.
 (pause) 
And they are right. All stations, prepare to break off
pursuit and go into orbit around the planet.

MIKE COLLINS steps forward.

 MIKE COLLINS 
You need a different plan than what you did last time. If you
just bombard the Machine from orbit again, it will just shift to
another timeline again, and you will have lost it again. Why
don’t you move the ship below the dampening field, teleport me
and several of your people near the Machine, and let us enter it
and shut it down, so that you can destroy it from orbit.
I know my way around the interior, and I can certainly find
the power source and shut it down.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
And why should we trust you?

 EVIL MRP 
Sir, I will accompany the team. If COLLINS thinks
of betraying us, I will know it immediately.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Very well. Prepare to move the ship into orbit.

 EXT- SPACE 

The camera opens on a shot of the Earth from orbit, with North America clearly seen on the planet below. The AH.COM is seen moving swiftly across the screen, going out of sight around the curve of the planet. Moments later, the Vendetta appears. It stops in orbit.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP–CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

The camera pans across the room and stops on DR. WHAT, sitting in his chair, tensely looking at the view screen.

 DR. WHAT 
LEO? What’s going on out there?

 LEO CAESIUS 
The Vendetta is not pursuing us.
GBW’S plan seems to be working.

 GBW 
Of course it’s working… it’s me!

 DR. WHAT 
Certainly. LEO, did you find the Machine yet?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Yes. I managed to get some video of it as we moved around the planet.
It is on the American Great Plains, about where Wichita is in most
timelines. I’ll put it up for you on the view screen.

The camera switches to a shot of the view screen. A long sweeping shot over North America is seen, and then the camera moves in closer and closer, moving through light clouds. The landscape below, void of any sign of human activity, comes closer into view, and a wide prairie is seen. A black spot on the prairie comes into view, and grows as the camera closes in on it. It is seen to be a large burned area, about a mile across. At the center of it, the Machine is seen.

 DR. WHAT 
Excellent. Now… we just have to be sure that those nutjobs
on the Vendetta see it and go after it… and finally destroy it.
But I don’t want to move the ship in sight of them, or they
might remember how MATT put a nuke on their ship and detonated it.

 MATT 
Me?! Yeah, I put it there, but you’re the one who blew it up!

 DR. WHAT 
 (waves hand dismissively) 
Details, details.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Well, I’ll send out one of our stealth satellite probes.
That will let us know what they’re doing.

 EXT- SPACE 

The AH.COM is seen in space. A puff of a rocket exhaust is seen, tiny against the hull, and a small curved object is seen moving away from the ship.

 INT- VENDETTA BRIDGE- DAY 

One of the bridge crewmen looks up from his station.

 CREWMAN 
The away team has been teleported down to the surface, sir.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Very well. Let us hope that this will be the
final part of our quest for vengeance.

The camera pans across the room. Expressions of hope can be seen on every face.

 EXT- SPACE 

The Vendetta is seen in low orbit. The AH.COM’S stealth satellite enters the screen and moves swiftly towards the enemy ship.

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

 LEO CAESIUS 
The stealth satellite is in position. Hmm… the Vendetta is
not firing at the Machine. Let me switch cameras down to the surface…

The camera switches to the view screen. The Machine again appears.

 LEO CAESIUS 
I’m going to pan around the clearing.

The scene on the view screen swings wildly for a moment, and a glimpse of shots of wide open prairie are seen. The camera scene suddenly stops and focuses in on a group of men walking towards the Machine. Most of them are obviously space marines, and one is EVIL MRP… and one is MIKE COLLINS.

The camera switches to DR. WHAT, whose eyes go wide.

 DR. WHAT 
What… the… hell?! MIKE COLLINS?!
In league with the Vendetta?!
How did he manage to do that?!

 OTHNIEL 
He had to have lied to them. He wants the Machine
for himself, STRAHA was clear about that.

 DR. WHAT 
But… that crazy telepath who fought it out with
DAVE is there too. How could COLLINS fool him?

 GBW 
Either COLLINS can shield his thoughts from him, or the telepath
is conspiring with him. There are no other explanations.

At that moment, the doors open, and DAVE HOWERY and KEIRA walk into the room.

 DAVE HOWERY 
The shift engines are 100% now,
so we can shift out of here any…

His voice trails off as he sees the view screen. A look of shock and then rage goes across his face.

 DAVE HOWERY 
COLLINS! And… no! That telepath bastard!

DAVE HOWERY’S hand moves toward one of the chainsaws on his back. Behind him, KEIRA turns pale. She drops the shotgun, and clasps her hands together in fear.
DR. WHAT swivels around in his chair.

 DR. WHAT 
Whatever is going on down there, we have to stop it.
I’m sending a team down there. We need to either
convince the space marines to stop COLLINS or
keep the whole bunch from getting to the Machine.

 MATT 
Stop the marines, the telepath, and MIKE COLLINS?
 (grins) 
Hot damn, Doc. And here I though this
was gonna be another fluff mission.

 DR. WHAT 
All right. Let’s move the ship close enough to use the teleporter.
I’m going to send down MATT, WEAPON M, IRONYUPPIE,
DMA, MICHAEL, and DAVE HOWERY down to the Machine.
Do whatever you can to stop COLLINS. Meanwhile, I’m going
to talk to TYRANNUS ZERO and try to convince him that COLLINS
is tricking him. This is all a long shot, but there’s really no choice here.

 OTHNIEL 
Let me go with the team too.
I’ve got a plan. It may not work,
but it’s worth a shot.

 DR. WHAT 
As you wish.
Everyone get ready.
Good luck.

The away team all move to leave the control room. KEIRA looks up at DAVE HOWERY, worry on her face. He smiles reassuringly at her, runs a hand along her shoulder, and then leaves the room.




 END ACT I 



 
 

 ACT II 



 
 

 INT- VENDETTA BRIDGE- DAY 

The camera pans across the room, showing the crew at their stations. The camera stops on a communications officer, who looks up in puzzlement.

 COMM OFFICER 
Sir, I’m getting a signal from the AH.COM.
They want to speak with you.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
That’s odd. I would have sworn that they would flee this
timeline after leading us here. Very well, put them through.
But be alert; have all weapons and shields ready.

He turns in his chair towards the view screen. After a moment, the scene changes from a view of the Earth to DR. WHAT in the AH.COM control room.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
What do you want, heretic? I am grateful to you for leading
us to the Machine, but I remember well your last encounter
with us, and I remember your treachery as well.

 DR. WHAT (on view screen) 
It is treachery that I came to talk to you about. You must
know that you cannot trust MIKE COLLINS. He wants the
Machine for his own, and has no intention of destroying it.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
I do not trust him. But I have no reason to believe
he is lying either. My own psyker is with him.

 DR . WHAT 
Then your psyker either is being fooled by COLLINS
or is working against you on some agenda of his own.

A look of fury goes across TYRANNUS ZERO’S face.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
You dare to accuse one of my officers of treachery?!
You, who went back on our agreement and destroyed
one of our engines after I released your crew?!

 DR. WHAT 
 (muttering) 
Damn, I hoped you’d forgotten about that.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Enough of this!

He pushes a button, and the communication link is broken.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Target that ship and destroy it! We will destroy the Machine and
gain vengeance for our slain Emperor today, and we will also
destroy the AH.COM and avenge ourselves for their treachery!

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

 DR. WHAT 
Oh boy, here’s where it gets fun.
 (pause) 
All decks prepare for combat! Evasive action!

 EXT- SPACE 

The AH.COM is seen facing off against the Vendetta. The AH.COM suddenly swivels and blasts away from orbit. The Vendetta turns and pursues.

 EXT- THE MACHINE- DAY 

The camera opens on a close shot of the Machine, from the end where the giant tuning fork stands. The team from the Vendetta enters the scene. They look up in awe at the massive building. It appears to be made out battered steel, although not a speck of rust is seen on it. There are still many holes in the outer walls, from the Vendetta’s earlier attack that destroyed the defences of the Machine.
The camera switches to the humans. There are ten space marines and sergeant NEK; MIKE COLLINS and EVIL MRP have managed to place themselves at the rear of the group.

 NEK 
It’s here. The infernal device that killed our Emperor.
Finally, we can complete our quest… and go home!

A loud warning buzzer sounds from the Machine, and everyone flinches. The camera switches to a wider view, and we see the manipulator arms picking another wet naked LUAKEL clone out of the tank. The giant slingshot emerges from the building, and a blue swirling vortex forms inside the tuning fork. The arms put the LUAKEL in the slingshot cup, pull it back, and let it fly. The LUAKEL flies into the vortex with a loud “Wheeeee!” The camera switches back to the marines.

 NEK 
And another timeline is going to be destroyed. Come, let us
move inside and find a way to destroy this foul contraption.

Behind them, MIKE COLLINS and EVIL MRP look at each other for a moment. Then, both draw out their bolters and point them at the backs of the unsuspecting space marines. At that moment, a voice is heard from off camera.

 VOICE (o.c.) 
Not today, COLLINS!

Everyone turns quickly, weapons raised. The camera switches to their POV. We see MATT, WEAPON M, DMA, and IRONYUPPIE standing by the corner of the building, bolters of their own in hand and pointed at the marines.

 NEK 
Heretics! You dare to try to stop us from destroying the Machine?!

 MATT 
Nah. I’d love to see you blow this place up. Hell, I’d love to
blow it up myself. For that matter, I love blowing up just about
anything. Especially doors… every time I see one, I just want
to put a big slab of C4 on it and…

 IRONYUPPIE 
MATT!!

 MATT 
Oh. Wait. Where was I? Oh yeah. No, we’re here to stop
MIKE COLLINS. He doesn’t want to destroy the Machine,
he wants to take control of it.

 EVIL MRP 
That’s not true! You want it for yourselves, and
seek to stop us from completing our revenge!

 IRONYUPPIE 
Why, you big fat liar…

 EVIL MRP 
SPACE MARINES! ATTACK!

With a howl of anger, the entire Vendetta team opens fire. The AH.COM team quickly ducks back behind the corner of the building. The bolter rounds hit the walls of the Machine, but don’t penetrate, bouncing off and exploding elsewhere. The camera switches to MIKE COLLINS and EVIL MRP, who stop shooting and huddle.

 MIKE COLLINS 
This is pointless. We need to get inside the Machine.
Let’s go in through one of the holes in the walls.

 EVIL MRP 
Agreed. I’ll give orders to the marines to stay here and…
 (pause) 
Wait. Someone’s inside there already

EVIL MRP puts a finger to his temple and closes his eyes.

 EVIL MRP 
One of them is that man who took STRAHA from you…

 MIKE COLLINS 
OTHNIEL…

 EVIL MRP 
…and the other…

EVIL MRP opens his eyes and grins nastily.

 EVIL MRP 
Well, well. None other than DAVE HOWERY himself.
I’m looking forward to this.

 MIKE COLLINS 
 (evil smile) 
HOWERY, huh? I could tell him some stories
about the timeline he comes from. Let’s go.

The two run towards the building and into one of the holes in the wall there.

 INT- THE MACHINE- DAY 

The camera pans across a vast dimly lit room filled with machinery and computer banks. OTHNIEL and DAVE HOWERY are seen walking warily through it. OTHNIEL is looking at a small device in his hand, but he puts it away with a look of frustration.

 OTHNIEL 
Shoot! The equipment in here is blanking out my scanner.
There’s got to be some kind of central control room here,
but I have no idea where.

 DAVE HOWERY 
 (looking up at ceiling) 
Let’s follow the fiber optic conduits.
That should lead us to it.

The two look around for a moment, and then leave the room.

 EXT- THE MACHINE- DAY 

The battle outside continues. The camera focuses on the AH.COM team; they are still huddling by the corner of the building. Every so often, one of them darts around and fires at the space marines, and then ducks back. A continual series of explosions are seen as the space marines fire back. Neither side seems able to damage the other.

 MATT 
Well, we’re certainly keeping them pinned down.
But we’re not doing much else. What the hell are
we supposed to be accomplishing here?

 WEAPON M 
Keep COLLINS from getting inside and hope that
the captain can convince their captain to turn against him.

 MATT 
Christ, the DOC couldn’t convince ice to melt in the tropics,
how’s he going to sway those fanatics up there?

 WEAPON M 
Beats me.
 (pause) 
Wait… where the hell is MICHAEL?

 IRONYUPPIE 
He said he had a surprise for the enemy.

 MATT 
Oh, that dumb damn Aussie!

 DMA 
Hey!

The camera switches to the space marines. Sergeant NEK is close to the wall of the Machine, trying to work his way forward, firing as he moves. He suddenly looks up as a shadow falls across him. The camera switches to his POV.

MICHAEL is standing on top of the building, bolter in hand. With a cry of “For the Holy Sheep!” he leaps down, aiming straight for NEK… who hastily steps aside. MICHAEL hits the ground in a thudding bellyflop, sinking several inches into the ground, arms and legs splayed out. NEK looks at him a moment, nudges him with a toe, and then shrugs and goes back to the fight.

 INT- THE MACHINE CONTROL CENTER- DAY 

The camera opens with a scene looking to the doorway. OTHNIEL and DAVE HOWERY are seen walking into the room and looking around.

 OTHNIEL 
Well, this has to be the place.

The camera switches to a view from behind them. The room is wide and tall. Most of it is filled with computer banks. A single chair is set in front of a desk with a keyboard and monitor, in the center of the room. OTHNIEL hurries over and sits down there. He taps several keys, and the monitor lights up and scrolls through a series of data lines.

 OTHNIEL 
Darn it, I can’t make heads or tails of this. How about you?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Hey, ask me about robotics, mechs,
or shift engines, not data systems.

 OTHNIEL 
All right, geez, I was just asking. Hmm… I
guess I’m going to need LEO for this one.

He takes out a communicator and plugs it into a handy socket on the keyboard.

 OTHNIEL 
Hey, LEO, can you hear me? I need some help
figuring out how to shut down this thing.

LEO CAESIUS’S voice comes back through the communicator, sounding rather peeved.

 LEO CAESIUS 
Damn it, OTHNIEL, we’re just a little busy up here now!

 EXT- SPACE 

The AH.COM is seen rolling through a series of spiralling manoeuvres, with the Vendetta close behind and firing continually.

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

The room is shaking as weapons from the Vendetta strike the ship.

 DR. WHAT 
KIT, how are we doing?

 KIT 
Shields are down to 30 %. Our weapons don’t seem to
be having much of an impact on the enemy.

 DR. WHAT 
Well, so long as the engines hold out, we can give
OTHNIEL time to shut down the Machine.

 INT- AH.COM SHIP- ENGINEERING- DAY 

PSYCHOMELTDOWN is seen frantically reading gauges and tapping on keyboards. G BONE runs screaming across the screen in the background.

 G BONE 
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!!

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
Shut the fuck up! Thrust engines are overheating a little…
get over to the heat sink station and manually open them up 20% more.

G BONE runs screaming back across the screen in the background.

 G BONE 
WE’RE ALL GOING TO DIE! DIE! DIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!

 PSYCHOMELTDOWN 
 (muttering) 
God damn it, G BONE….

 INT- THE MACHINE CONTROL CENTER- DAY 

OTHNIEL looks at the communicator, from which sounds of combat and the AH.COM crew frantically yelling orders can be heard.

 OTHNIEL 
Uh oh. Sounds like the Vendetta didn’t take the bait.
They’re attacking the ship! Now what do we do?

 DAVE HOWERY 
See if you can figure out how to shut the machine down.
And maybe look for a self destruct program. If we can
blow this thing up, maybe they’ll go away.

 OTHNIEL 
But maybe they’ll still come after the ship, since the DOC
blew up one of their engines. Can’t take that chance.

OTHNIEL thinks deeply for a moment, and then snaps his fingers.

 OTHNIEL 
Got an idea. We’re going to save the ship
and then destroy the Machine.
 (into communicator) 
LEO! I got a plan, so listen up…

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

 LEO CAESIUS 
Okay, got it, OTHNIEL.
 (pause) 
LANDSHARK! Run the ship past the Earth close
enough to use the teleporter. OTHNIEL and I have
a plan… no time to explain… do it!
 (pause) 
G BONE, get to… damn it, G BONE, quit screaming and
get to the teleporter room! That’s ridiculous, calling me
names won’t help, and besides, I’m an AI, and I never had
a mother… damn it, just get to the teleporter room!!

 EXT- SPACE 

The AH.COM makes a sharp turn, heading directly towards the Earth. The Vendetta pursues them.

 INT- THE MACHINE CONTROL CENTER- DAY 

OTHNIEL and DAVE HOWERY are looking anxiously around. With a low hum, a stack of crates suddenly shimmers into view.

 OTHNIEL 
Great. Quick, load them into that lift over there.
Now, if LEO can just take control…

 LEO CAESIUS (from communicator) 
I have a good link. Processing. Hmmm… a strange type
of computer programming, but I can access it. Okay, I
have the controls to the manipulators and internal machinery.
Accessing LUAKEL programming… reprogramming mental uploads…

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

 LEO CAESIUS 
Processing complete. Reprogramming complete. LANDSHARK,
make another low orbit run over the planet…
this time, pass right over the Machine.

 LANDSHARK 
But what….

 LEO CAESIUS 
No time to explain! Just do it, you overdressed angry Brit!

 LANDSHARK 
Fine!
 (muttering) 
Uppity damn computer.

 EXT- THE MACHINE- DAY 

The camera opens with a wide shot over the top of the Machine. The manipulator arms are seen reaching into the cloning tank and pulling out another wet naked LUAKEL clone. But this time, a small panel opens on the roof, and the manipulator arms take the clone down out of sight into the building. A few moments later, the arms pull back out. The LUAKEL is dressed in a space suit. The arms place the clone into the cup of the slingshot, which swivels around and angles back slightly so that it is aiming up towards the sky.

The AH.COM is seen coming into view out of space. As it enters the atmosphere, long contrails stream out behind it. The Vendetta appears moments later, above and behind.

The slingshot fires.

The camera switches to a view of the LUAKEL clone flying through the air and follows it as it flies towards the Vendetta. The air gets thinner and darker as it moves up, and the clone’s flight starts to slow down. A jet pack thruster on the space suit fires, and the clone moves rapidly towards the Vendetta. The clone shoots right through some of the superstructure, and then it grabs a communications mast, swings around it several times, and comes to a halt. The clone shimmies down the mast and trundles towards the back of the ship.

 INT- VENDETTA BRIDGE- DAY 

A crewman looks up from his station.

 CREWMAN 
Sir, we… we have a foreign object on our hull.
It appears to be someone in a space suit.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
 (looking baffled) 
In the Emperor’s name, how did anyone get there?! 

 EXT- VENDETTA HULL 

The LUAKEL clone is seen moving around at the very back of the Vendetta’s hull. It looks around a moment, and then sits down. It pulls off an access panel, reaches into the cavity, and pulls out a handful of wires, which spark as they are broken.

The camera switches to a scene of the massive engine exhausts on the back of the ship. The fiery exhausts suddenly stop, and the engines sputter and die.

The camera switches back to the LUAKEL clone, which claps its hands together happily. The clone pulls several tools out of a belt pouch and begins taking off several pieces of the hull.

 INT- VENDETTA BRIDGE- DAY 

 CREWMAN 
Sir! We just lost power to the engines… they’re both out!

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Damn those heretics! They did this somehow. Obviously,
whoever they managed to sneak onto our hull has disabled
the engines. Very well… prepare a squad of Assault Marines
for deep space operations and have them remove the intruder from our hull.
 (pause) 
What is the enemy ship doing?

 CREWMAN 
They’re staying just out of weapons’ range.
They’re not attacking, but they aren’t leaving either.

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

The camera pans across the room. The crew here is staring at the view screen in wonder; the immobilized Vendetta is seen on it.

 DR. WHAT 
I can’t believe that worked!

 KIT 
Yes, it’s a good thing we never quite managed to sell
those space suits to anyone. But what do we do now?

 DR. WHAT 
Give LEO time to sift through the Machine’s computers.
Hopefully find a self destruct program. How’s it going, LEO?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Slow. There are a number of heavily encrypted files on the
mainframe, and they are difficult to crack. It’s going to take some time.

 DR. WHAT 
Well, we have some time…
look, there’s another one!

On the view screen, a tiny spacesuited figure is seen flying through the air and landing on the top hull of the Vendetta.

 EXT- THE MACHINE- DAY 

The camera opens on the AH.COM team, still crouching around the corner of the building. No one seems to be shooting right now.

 MATT 
Shit! They’re up to something. Bet you anything that they’re
figuring out how to work around our flank.

 WEAPON M 
How do you know that?

 MATT 
It’s what I’d do.

 IRONYUPPIE 
Do you suppose they’re also propositioning
male prostitutes, because you’d do that too.

 MATT 
Hey!! It was only one time, and he looked really effeminate, and…

 WEAPON M 
Never mind! We have to figure out a plan.

A loud cracking sound is heard, and the team looks up at the top of the building. The slingshot has just fired again, and another suited LUAKEL is flying up towards the Vendetta.

The camera switches to a view of the space marines. Sergeant NEK is talking to several of them, obviously giving them orders. Various marines nod and move away.

MICHAEL is still flattened on the ground and seems to be ignored by the marines, who simply run past or over him, sometimes stepping on him.

 INT- THE MACHINE CONTROL CENTER- DAY 

OTHNIEL is still sitting at the control desk, looking at the data streams moving on the monitor.

 OTHNIEL 
 (muttering) 
Come on, LEO, find it.

 DAVE HOWERY 
How much longer is this going to take?
Those LUAKEL clones are keeping the
Vendetta occupied for now, but it won’t
take long for the marines to stop them.
We don’t have a lot of time.

 OTHNIEL 
Hard to say. The encryptions on
here are pretty tricky and…

He stops as DAVE HOWERY holds up a hand in warning; he’s looking suspiciously at the room entrance.

 OTHNIEL 
What?

 DAVE HOWERY 
Heard something. You stay here;
I’m going to go check it out.

DAVE HOWERY takes his two chainsaws off his back and walks out of the room.

 EXT- THE VENDETTA 

The camera pans across the top hull of the Vendetta. At least a dozen suited LUAKEL clones can be seen busily dismantling everything they can reach. Lights across the hull and superstructure go out one by one. The camera closes in on one of the clones, who is trying to take the leg off of a communications tower. The tower is rocking back and forth. The clone suddenly stops and looks around.

The camera switches to his POV, and we see a squad of Assault Marines fly up over the edge of the hull; they are suited for deep space, and their jet packs give them great mobility. All carry bolters in their hands. Two of them fire at the LUAKEL. He is hit in the chest several times, and floats away from the ship, obviously dead. The marines then rocket over the rest of the ship, shooting at fleeing LUAKELS.

 INT- VENDETTA BRIDGE- DAY 

 CREWMAN 
Sir, the Assault Marines have begun to dispose
of the intruders. Several systems have gone out,
but we should have everything on line again in minutes.
 (pause) 
Sir, the enemy ship is staying out of range of most of
our weapons… but we could hit them with the Yamato gun.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Yes. I hesitate to use that weapon because each shot drains
a quarter of our power, and leaves our shields weakened for
so long. But in this situation… yes, we will chance it.
Charge up the Yamato gun and prepare a targeting
solution on the enemy ship.

 INT- THE MACHINE- DAY 

DAVE HOWERY is seen walking warily through a room full of power units. He looks around at the darkened corners and the blinking status lights all over. He looks at the opposite entrance to the room for a moment, and starts to turn away, when a low laugh makes him turn swiftly back.

The camera switches to his POV. MIKE COLLINS and EVIL MRP are standing in the entrance, sneering at him.

 MIKE COLLINS 
We meet again, Mr. HOWERY. I think
I’ll kick your ass good and certain this time.

 DAVE HOWERY 
You can try. You may succeed. But LEO will turn
on the self destruct before you get past me.
You’ve lost, COLLINS.

The sneer slips off of MIKE COLLINS’ face, and he steps forward angrily.

 MIKE COLLINS 
The Machine will be mine!

 DAVE HOWERY 
Yeah, you’re big and bad, yadda yadda yadda.
 (to EVIL MRP) 
And what are you getting out of this? Why are you siding
with him instead of wanting to blow up the Machine?

 EVIL MRP 
What do I get? Why, KEIRA, of course.

 DAVE HOWERY 
Thought that might be it. Well, she’s safe on the ship.
You’re not getting your hands on her, you redheaded
psychotic telepath.

 EVIL MRP 
By myself, probably not. But I have COLLINS on my side now.
Between the two of us, we can manage to get hold of one small
woman… and with you dead, she’ll be free of the compulsion
that ties her to you… you dirty old man.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Ah, yes, it’s a pity that I have been so involved
in depriving you of the women in your life.
 (pause) 
Isn’t that true, #2191?

The camera switches to DAVE HOWERY, who goes deathly pale.

 DAVE HOWERY 
How… how could you know…

MIKE COLLINS snarls viciously and gestures to himself.

 MIKE COLLINS 
All hail the glorious Premiere.

 DAVE HOWERY 
You… you were…

A familiar look of complete insane rage goes across DAVE HOWERY’S face. Moving blindingly fast, he thumbs the switch on one of his chainsaws, bringing it to a roar. He swings hard at MIKE COLLINS, who seems to have been caught by surprise, and takes a step back in alarm, but DAVE HOWERY is too fast…

But EVIL MRP moves even faster. His chainsword moves in front of MIKE COLLINS; the chainsaw blade catches on the chainsword, and COLLINS is untouched.

 EVIL MRP 
I knew you were going to do that.

 EXT- VENDETTA 

The camera shows a single LUAKEL clone fleeing slowly across the hull. It is dodging and weaving in between the superstructure and towers on the top hull. However, a pair of Assault Marines rocket into view just behind it. They fire their bolters, and the LUAKEL is hit in the back several times. It ceases all movement, and floats gently away from the ship.

 INT- VENDETTA BRIDGE- DAY 

 CREWMAN 
Sir, the Assault Marines have just reported in. All intruders
have been eliminated. Also, the Yamato gun is ready to fire.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Excellent. Target the enemy ship.

He swivels around in his command chair and faces the view screen.

 EXT- SPACE 

The Vendetta and the AH.COM ship are seen in orbit, the latter moving slowly around the larger ship. The Vendetta swivels slightly in place, so that it is facing the other ship directly. A massive power beam fires out of the Vendetta and strikes the AH.COM ship. Although the lights on the Vendetta immediately go dimmer, the AH.COM has been severely damaged.

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

Everyone in the room is hanging onto their chairs as the ship spins violently around.

 DR. WHAT 
Son. Of. A. Bitch!! What the hell was that?!

 LEO CAESIUS 
We’ve been hit by a massive energy weapon. Engines are out.
All weapons are out. Shields are down. We’re a sitting duck!
One more shot, and we’re done for!
 (pause) 
And I’ve lost the data link to the Machine!

 INT- VENDETTA BRIDGE- DAY 

TYRANNUS ZERO is looking at the AH.COM, seen adrift in space on the view screen.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Hit them again.

 EXT- THE MACHINE- DAY 

The camera shows the AH.COM team hugging the side of the building as enemy bolter fire explodes against the corner of the building.

 MATT 
Damn it, I knew this was gonna happen. They outnumber us,
they’re keeping us pinned down, and you can bet they are
sneaking people around us to hit us from another side.

 WEAPON M 
Watch it!

The team members all turn, and look astonished as a pair of marines with huge bolters rise out of a nearby hollow, weapons aimed straight at the team. The team members all start to swing their weapons around, but it is obvious that the marines have the drop on them, and will fire first.

 INT- THE MACHINE CONTROL CENTER- DAY 

OTHNIEL is watching the monitor, and he leans forward in alarm as the screen suddenly goes dark.

 OTHNIEL 
LEO? What’s wrong?

He stands and looks at the communicator. A low sound is heard off camera, and OTHNIEL turns to look. He staggers back against the desk, eyes wide in surprise.

The camera switches to his POV. MIKE COLLINS and EVIL MRP stand in the entrance. COLLINS holds DAVE HOWERY by the front of his shirt, completely off the ground. DAVE is limp and motionless, his head lolling against his shoulder. MIKE COLLINS tosses him contemptuously at OTHNIEL’S feet; he lands with a boneless thud. OTHNIEL looks down at the engineer. He is battered and has a horrible looking gash on his head, but he draws in a ragged breath; he’s alive. OTHNIEL looks back up fearfully at the two enemies. EVIL MRP steps forward, a phoney smile on his face.

 EVIL MRP 
Thank you for guiding us to this room.
Your help is no longer required.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Neither is yours.

EVIL MRP swivels in astonishment to see MIKE COLLINS standing behind him.

 EVIL MRP 
You… you are betraying me?!

 MIKE COLLINS 
Did you really think I couldn’t
disguise my thoughts from you?

EVIL MRP moves to draw his chainsword, but MIKE COLLINS strikes him on the forehead with his fist. EVIL MRP falls to the floor, not dead, but unconscious.

 MIKE COLLINS 
As if I want to waste time getting you a girl. Now, to business.
 (facing OTHNIEL) 
Once again, you are between me and my goal. Step away
from the console. I’d hate to have your blood stain it…

His voice trails off when he sees that OTHNIEL is looking behind him with a puzzled expression. He turns, and the camera switches to his POV.

A figure in a black cloak and hood is standing by the entrance. Nothing can be seen except for a pair of pale hands.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Who the fuck are you?!

The camera switches to a close up view of the person’s hands. One hand raises, and a finger wags playfully, but warningly, back and forth.

The camera switches to a view from behind the figure. We see it reach up and start to lower the hood, but the camera zooms forward to OTHNIEL and MIKE COLLINS, so we never see the face. However, OTHNIEL and MIKE COLLINS both react with shock and wide eyed surprise.

 OTHNIEL 
You?! Here?! No…

 MIKE COLLINS 
It can’t be… not here…

The camera switches to a close up of the person’s hands again. They spread the fingers wide and wave across the screen. A high pitched humming sound is heard, and the screen fuzzes out to brilliant white light. And then the sound stops and the screen suddenly goes black.




 END ACT II 


 
 

 TAG 



 
 

 INT- AH.COM CONTROL ROOM- DAY 

The camera opens on a shot of DR. WHAT sitting in his command chair. He is motionless, and staring unblinkingly ahead of him. Suddenly, he blinks and shakes his head. He looks around and sees the others in the room doing the same thing. Everyone looks puzzled. OTHNIEL stands in the center of the room, looking completely baffled.

 DR. WHAT 
Wait… what… what the hell happened?
 (pause) 
OTHNIEL?

 OTHNIEL 
I… don’t know. I remember being in the Machine,
I remember MIKE COLLINS coming into the control
center there… and then nothing.

 DR. WHAT 
LEO? What happened?

 LEO CAESIUS 
I don’t know. My memory logs have a gap of 20 minutes in them.
My last recordings are of the ship being severely damaged by the
Vendetta, and then nothing until we ended up here.
 (pause) 
We are no longer in the timeline of the Machine. This world has humans
and technology. I also do not detect the Vendetta or any other ships in orbit.

 KIT 
Is the rest of the crew on board?

 LEO CAESIUS 
Yes. DAVE HOWERY and MICHAEL are in
the Medical Bay. But everyone is aboard.
 (pause) 
Except STRAHA. He has vanished from the brig.

 DR. WHAT 
Christ! Did we all dream the whole thing?

 LEO CAESIUS 
No, definitely not. The ship is severely damaged,
exactly as I had recorded.

The crew members all take a moment and look at each other in unease.

 DR. WHAT 
My God. Just what happened to us?

 INT- VENDETTA BRIDGE- DAY 

The camera opens on a scene of TYRANNUS ZERO sitting in his command chair, unmoving and staring blankly ahead of him. He suddenly blinks and raises a hand to his head. Startled, he turns to look at the rest of the crew, who are also just coming to their senses.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
What… status?

 CREWMAN 
 (hurriedly looking at his panel) 
Uh… all systems nominal. The hull is still damaged
from the intruders’ attack, but repairs are nearly done.
 (pause) 
Where are we?

 SBEGIN 
Sir, we are no longer in the timeline of the Machine.
The world below has cities and humans. I do not
detect any other ships in the area.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Does anyone remember just how we got here?

 CREWMAN 
Sir, the ship’s recorders tell me nothing. There is
a gap in the electronic data of 20 minutes. But our
entire current crew roster is all present and accounted for.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Very well. This is strange. Some force has not only
thrown us into another timeline, it has erased all memory of it.
 (pause) 
And we have lost the Machine again. I wonder if we should
return to that timeline and look for clues as to where it has gone…

 SBEGIN 
Sir. There is a LUAKEL on the planet below.

TYRANNUS ZERO has his back turned to the rest of the crew, and none see the look of utter weariness and anguish go across his face. When he turns to face them, he has his normal expression.

 TYRANNUS ZERO 
Very well. Prepare for complete planetary extermination.

 INT- IP.NET BRIDGE- DAY 

The camera opens on a scene of MIKE COLLINS and MOLOBO sitting at the controls of the ship. Both suddenly stir, as if just coming to their senses.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Wait… MOLOBO? Where…
 (pause) 
Something has gone wrong.

He swiftly runs his hands over the controls and looks at the data on the monitor. He then looks angry, and smashes one fist down on the console.

 MIKE COLLINS 
Damn it! This is not the timeline where the Machine is!
And there are no other ships nearby either. I have no idea
just what this timeline is, but it has people on it.

 MOLOBO 
What… how did we get here?

 MIKE COLLINS 
I… don’t know. I remember being inside the Machine,
I remember turning the tables on that idiot telepath…
and then nothing.
 (pause) 
Oh well, at least I got rid of that idiot STRAHA.
He’s the AH.COM’S problem now.

The door to the room opens, and STRAHA wanders in, looking even more confused than normal.

 STRAHA 
How did I get here?

 MIKE COLLINS 
 (muttering) 
Oh just great.

 INT- A PLACE UNKNOWN 

The screen shows a scene that is completely black and dark, except for a shaft of bright light coming from somewhere above, making a circle of light on a black floor. The cloaked and hooded figure from the Machine stands in the light, back to the camera. He speaks in a deep unnatural voice.

 CLOAKED FIGURE 
You worry without reason. The Machine is safe.

In the blackness beyond the light, very vague movements made by… something… can be seen, but they are too indistinct to see what is making them. A harsh screeching voice comes out of the blackness.

 VOICE 
You came close to failure. We have invested too much in you for failure.

 CLOAKED FIGURE 
I have not failed.  The Machine is safe.
It is operating at full capacity again.
It will not be found.  The Plan goes
ahead as scheduled.

 EXT- AFRICA- DAY 

The camera pans across a view of beautiful African savannah. Vast herds of game are seen everywhere; this is obviously another world where humanity never arose. Mount Kilimanjaro is seen briefly in the distance. The camera stops on a view of a huge burned out area. The Machine stands at the center of it. There is a blue vortex between the arms of the tuning fork, and the final scene shows a LUAKEL clone being launched by the slingshot, sending it to yet another timeline.
