 New trustee for RCIDA, office for DA division 

 Zack Stoycoff Staff Reporter The Claremore Daily Progress Wed Aug 18, 2010, 02:33 PM CDT 
 
CLAREMORE—The Rogers County Industrial Development Authority has a new board member and the district attorney’s bogus check office has a new home, Rogers County commissioners announced this week.

Larry Mallory, a Rogers County plumber, will fill the seat vacated by Daryl Park on the RCIDA board of trustees.

Mallory, who has an engineering degree and operates a plumbing business, was the right choice, RCIDA Director Mickey Thompson said.

“He’s a small business man, which is an important part of what we do,”Thompson said.“I’m happy to have him on board.”

Mallory said he has lived in Rogers County his entire life and it’s time he gave back. His business has been in the county for four generations.

“It’s the least I can do,”he said.

Commissioners also moved the bogus check office into the courthouse so crews can demolish its current office to clear the way for the new courthouse approved by voters in December.

That ended a 2-month-long search for new digs for the division of the district attorney’s office dedicated to investigating fake checks.

 “It’s going to be crowded, no doubt about it,”said District 1 Commissioner Dan DeLozier, who was picked by commissioners last week to find options for the bogus check office.“I think everyone’s consensus is it needs to go into the courthouse.”

Commissioners had been trying to move the office from the 200 block of Missouri Street since June, but were looking for a standalone building larger than the space available in the courthouse.

The largest vacant room in the courthouse, the old snack bar room, is only 600 square feet. The office needs at least 1,000, District Attorney Gene Haynes told commissioners.

Commissioners said this week that given the choice of paying monthly rent for another building or squeezing the office into the courthouse, it’s best to go with what’s cheaper.

“We’re in a position to save money. I know it’s tight but in my opinion we’ve got to do what we’ve got to do,”DeLozier said.

A small storage room and two basement rooms in the emergency management agency’s office will be turned over to the bogus check office and pre-fabricated storage units set up outside will free up more space, giving bogus check personnel just over 900 square feet spread around the courthouse.

The new courthouse will have space for the bogus check office, but that will not be ready for nearly two years, commissioners said.

“I don’t like this. I don’t think anyone likes this,”DeLozier said.“There’s just not much space left.”

Also at the commissioners’meeting:

•Commissioners approved for the sheriff’s office a controller unit for a device that dispenses medicine.

•Commissioners noted receipt of checks of $3,500 from Oologah to be distributed to the salary fund in District 2, $3,380.27 for fuel reimbursement from the Sheriff’s office to District 1, $878.66 for Oologah Municipal Authority fuel reimbursement to District 2 and $801.79 for sheriff’s fuel reimbursement to District 2.

•Commissioners voted to throw away two typewriters for the county clerk’s office.
