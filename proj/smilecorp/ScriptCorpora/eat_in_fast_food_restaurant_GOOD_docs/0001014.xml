Red Ribbon Week
 My sister is always put in charge of Red Ribbon Week at her kids school and she always asks for my help with some aspect of it. This year she came up with the idea of making an iPod coloring page where the kids can create a song name and draw a picture of how they pledge to be drug free. So I created the page for her and decided I should put it up here for any of you to use at your schools as well.
 


In other news, we are all sick. Change of weather probably but sick none the less. Even little Jillian is couching at sneezing. I hate it when my kiddos get sick. So far Alec hasn&apos;t gotten it but we all know it&apos;s just a matter of time for that to happen. Let&apos;s hope for a quick recovery.
