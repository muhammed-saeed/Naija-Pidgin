 george b early mortgage payment? 
 I asked this question earlier and got some good answers&quot;I have extra cash per month and I want to put it towards principal for my mortgage that I just started paying ( 5%, 174k, 30 yrs) OR student loan ( 17yrs left 3.75% 20k left). Which one should get the extra principal payment?&quot;sooo I should pay off some extra mortgage no matter what?, I was told one extra payment a year takes off 7 years of a 30 yr loan. So should I at the most put about one extra mortgage payment a year with my extra cash? and use the rest on savings?                 Reason for Reporting

 pay in an extra note or two per year on your house&amp;pay the rest toward your student loan. its a lower interest rate, but WAY longer term. get that one over with! congrats on your new house!

 If you can make extra payments to the mortgage during the first ten years of it your going to see the biggest savings. One extra payment a year is great but if you can do more then that, do it. Read this article, it tells more about this senerio: http://honestbanker.blogspot.com/2009/09/you-pay-most-of-interest-on-loan-in.html

 look 1 extra payment to to the principal and interest on the mortgage note every year or 1/12 monthly will save you in excess of 8 years on the mortgage note. Keeping the student loan around as a pet is ok as well as the interest on both are tax deductible items with the IRS. Personally I would work on the student loan as it has the smallest balance till paid in full. Then I would take what I was sending there and throw it at the mortgage till satisfied. The reason is that most people can be transferred with in a company several times over the course of their carriers and may have to move. Either way is fine if you know beyond any shadow of a doubt that you are not moving for at least 10 years.
Oh yes have emergency funds in place in a separate account of not less than 6 months total living expenses just in case bad things happen. With home ownership comes unexpected expenses just when you least expect them.
Congrats on the home and having a level head on your shoulders. You are at least thinking and that gives you a leg up on most people out there

 Both are at fairly low interest rates. You won&apos;t find cheaper money anywhere soon.

If it was me, I&apos;d first use any extra money to pay down higher interest debts, if you have any. Cars, credit cards, that sort of thing. Then I&apos;d save some to build up a pad of emergency money. This is that 3-6 month cushion. At that point, I&apos;d look around and see if there were any investments that make sense. If you find something that can reasonably return more than the interest you&apos;re paying on these loans, put the money there. If not - pay them down.

As to whether an extra payment takes 7 years off a loan - set up a spread sheet and see what happens. The 7 year figure sounds extreme to me. The spreadsheet will show you how much you can save this way.

 No you were told to first build up your emergency fund to at least 8 months of Living expenses.
then you can send extra principle each month. One payment a year does not take 7 yrs off your mortgage of 174. A 100 each month will take off the 7 yrs No an extra mortgage payment a year is not how it is done because the lender will just put the extra into escrow. On your monthly statement is a box for paying Extra Principle You can add the extra along with your normal monthly payment and mark it as principle

 Rules for paying off a mortgage:

1. Have at least 6 months salary in a savings
2. Pay off all credit card debt
3. Have all cars paid off
4. Have no loans - not even student loans
5. Make sure you have plans to buy your next car with cash.

To pay off a mortgage - you must be 100% debt free - sorry.
And a student loan is a debt.

Remember: Once you start making extra mtg payments you will NEVER finance anything ever again. -- You won&apos;t have to.

 You need to have some savings in case disaster strikes you, but if you already have enough in savings, you&apos;d be ahead to put any extra money on your mortgage, since that&apos;s a higher interest rate than the student loan, and you aren&apos;t likely to get 5% in savings interest. If savings interest rises to over 5%, then savings would make sense. 
 
 2010-01-08 19:49:44 +0000 
 The rule of thumb is first have 6 or more months of income in the bank for an emergency fund - this gets you through the worst of times if they come. Then I would definitely pay down early on the mortgage. The interest on the student loan is lower, so you save more money paying towards the mortgage (though it can&apos;t hurt to throw an extra $25 or $50 at the student loan when you can).
