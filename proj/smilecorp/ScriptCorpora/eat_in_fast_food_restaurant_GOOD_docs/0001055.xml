 The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Feb 16, 2009, 8:52pm

Our inner state becomes our outer environment,both here in this world and,even more so,in the life of the world to come. Re: The Secret of the Universe

So true, methinks, ideally beginning with Plato&apos;s

&quot;Perhaps there is a pattern set up in the heavens for one who desires to see it, and having seen it, to find one in himself&quot;.

Adding Jordan Maxwell&apos;s

&quot;There is a moral Arch in the Universe that tends toward justice&quot;.

Great Hermes, dependable in all worlds.

Once we recognize this fact,(that our inner state becomes our outer environment...) The question arises,&quot;What does our inner state consist of?&quot;And,&quot;How can we become free of any undesirable elements we may discover to be part of our inner state?&quot;

As Charlotte has so,appropriately replied,&quot;Perhaps there is a pattern&quot;, that we may come to know by which to measure our present inner state against? Re: The Secret of the Universe

A tough question &apos;tis what our inner state consists of. Considering the teachings of ancient &apos;Philosophers&apos;, in those days a title bestowed on men and women proficent in Astronomy, Mathematics, Geometry, Physics, Psychology etc., let&apos;s say Priests, communicated to the many by actors and Poets on the Stage, and also considering the Great Thinkers of the modern sciences, the best answer I have is&quot;we are the stuff that dreams are made of and our little life is rounded by a sleep&quot;.

This must be where axioms such as&quot;follow your dreams - dream the impossible dream, reach for the unreachable stars&quot;, mostly scoffed at. But this here statement is probably too simple for there is &apos;predispositon&apos; involved and with it the question what causes us to be predisposed this way or that. In the lesser our parents and the invironment we grow up in, then through life experiences a &apos;selbst-gestalten&apos;, that is, if we are able to categorically reject almost everything that doesn&apos;t make sense and think for ourselves, which in turn requires to be born a Free Spirit, but in the Greater the predisposition must be a continuation of former times.

I have often tried to discern my inner state and the origin of my Ideal, as I do at this moment, but cannot, similarely I sat down and gave myself permission to go crazy when I couldn&apos;t take it anymore, and could not, so without a doubt there are two of us: one Real, the other a Doppelgnger, which the Umlaut implies.

To free ourselves from undesirable elements which are part of our inner state, as far as I know, they cannot be forced/willed out by forced &apos;positive thinking&apos; and some such useless methods, but once recognized have to be accepted for what they are, lived in the inner and outer worlds until they are outlived gradually and naturally for the law that the river cannot be pushed holds water in all worlds.

A rather long and incomplete answer to a short question for wont of brevity of wit.

A great day to you!

I think the pattern Plato means is the harmonious movement of the Universe loving itself, oblivious to human thought and action, but accepting of harmony/love we find in ourselves, hence my Hermes as above so below, but that&apos;s just my little world.

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Feb 19, 2009, 2:55pm

Pardon me while I have a strange interlude...

You may well ask,&quot;Why have I begun this thread on the secret of the universe under the topic of Armageddon?&quot;

I choose to interiorize this idea of Armageddon. This final battle between good and evil must take place,I believe,within ourselves upon the battleground of our own heart.

This,&quot;Inner warfare&quot;is the real meaning of the word,&quot;Jihad.&quot;If only the Jihadi&apos;s of the world were to recognize this fact,what a different world we would live in. Of course,it is oh so much easier to exteriorize these things and find someone outside of ourselves to blame for our problems,but as far as the way the cosmos works,this is simply not the case!

We,however,have the opportunity to make all things new.

So,when it comes to&quot;The wars,the lies,the failings,the warnings,etc.&quot;mentioned in the sub-heading of&quot;Countdown to Armageddon&quot;We can begin to see these things as the undesirable elements of our own inner state. The flaws in our own characters,our falsehoods,our illusions,our,less than helpful predispositions,as Charlotte has mentioned,which are being reflected back to us in the world we have helped to create.

We are not helpless victims trapped in an uncaring world. We are co-creators with God learning how to make use of the incredible powers and abilities which are our Divine birth-right.

In order to become truly free and truly conscious we must confront and go to war against ourselves.

&quot;We are the stuff that dreams are made of and our little life is rounded by sleep...&quot;It&apos;s time to wake up and become who and what we really are.
 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Feb 19, 2009, 3:06pm

As far as beginning to recognize the elements of our own inner state,the good the bad and the ugly of it,I highly recommend a book by Stanislaus Groff,&quot;Realms of the human unconscious.&quot;Dr.Groff&apos;s model of our inner landscape has been a big help in my effort to,&quot;Know Thyself.&quot;

When it comes to getting free of the undesirable elements,to begin with,as every housewife knows,(is there such a thing anymore?),sunlight is the best disinfectant... Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Feb 20, 2009, 1:57am

As Charlotte has written,&quot;To free ourselves from undesirable elements...once recognized have to be...lived in the inner and outer worlds until they are outlived gradually...&quot;

I would like to suggest that we can take a more active role in our spiritual unfoldment,consciously co-operating with the process in such a manner that it can be accelerated significantly!

This demands a certain degree of effort on our part,but as far as I&apos;m concerned,it sure beats waiting around for all this junk to work it&apos;s way out.

Any traditional spiritual path is a means of active participation and conscious co-operation in our own spiritual life. Let&apos;s take Buddhism for example. The eight-fold path is no passive,sit around waiting for our Karma to work it&apos;s way out. The eight-fold path is an extremely demanding means of undoing the bad Karma we have accumulated,while at the same time,helping us not to rack up any more bad Karma while we&apos;re at it!

How about Christianity? There is a little known verse in Matthew. Chapter 11 verse 12 ,which most Christians skip right over because it doesn&apos;t seem to fit in with the,&quot;Love your neighbor&quot;message of Christianity,(Which many Christians also skip over,unfortunately...) Which reads: The Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force.&quot;

In the context of our previous discussion on inner warfare, this verse refers to the fact that we have to force ourselves to do what we know is right. It doesn&apos;t necessarily come natural to us. As a matter of fact,it most often goes against our less than fortunate predispositions.

Let&apos;s not forget our basics in Astrology however,&quot;The stars impel us in certain directions,but they do not compel.&quot;We still have the freedom of will to make our own decisions.

Maybe it&apos;s just me,but I&apos;ve had enough! I&apos;m not interested in coming back into this same framework over and over again. The ultimate goal is not to keep coming back,but to get off the wheel of birth and death and finally graduate into the next level of being.

This is the opportunity that is being presented to us at this time.

It will take some effort on our part but the rewards will be great.

How about a race of clairvoyant wonder-workers who have been restored to their original blessed state of oneness with God and all of creation,who,whatever they INTEND comes into being instantaneously in an ever-lasting,imperishable,incorruptible multi-verse of limitless creative freedom?

Any body else out there interested?


 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Feb 20, 2009, 11:52am

I think about, but not bussy myself too much with Armageddon objectively, so to speak, because this final battle of good and evil within our hearts is a natural ongoing process in the duality of our thoughts: the white angel and red devil on our shoulders as it were. I do my best to check my negative thoughts, hard to achieve this point, or reverse them with an apology to Life.

Apropos the&quot;Jihad&quot;, I jumped at every opportunity during my many sojourns in Egypt, to tell the Muslims that their jihad is really the&quot;Inner warfare&quot;as you say, they nod and smile, but the many, so taught and do believe without stint, that eventually there will be a Muslim Humanity. Neither do they hear, as far as blaming others for the worlds ills, their Prophets words,&quot;be careful not to blame others for their faults because they are also in you&quot;. He also says that it is better to study than to pray all day, and other such good things. Their jihad waged against all non Muslims is the same battle in the greater.

I would agree that we are not helpless victims but co-creators and to become truly free and wholly conscious is our Divine birthright, it reminds me of Fern once saying to me: in everything anyone does he seeks a solution to a problem he has, and this doing is part of the process to Freedom, which is not that or the other and what have you, but conditionless as you say at the end of your post.

The poetic &apos;we are the stuff that dreams are made of...&apos; Can we then say: we are the stuff imagination is made of, as all the Wise and state of the art science assure us? Again, the waking up is part of the process, a measured and orderly process, no one is admitted to a Universe City without having successfully graduated from High School - beginning in Kindergarten.

Yeah, Stanislaus Groff used to teach at the PRS, where I began learning with a Kindergarten mentality and had to teach myself the English language again... part of the process.

Listening since childhood to a different drummer, so predisposed, I was never a good housewife, they are called&quot;Homemakers&quot;nowadays, I hear, same function it seems to me, but I do agree wholeheartedly with you that&quot;when it comes to getting free of the undesirable elements, sunlight is the best disinfectant...&quot;

In all, it is my understanding that each takes part in the process, more or less conscious, in the spiritual unfoldment individually thereby aiding the Collective to Freedom, and even the backsliding is nessesary for to correct the faulty, and&quot;even those who do nothing serve&quot;a purpose. Everyone is doing something, and I didn&apos;t mean sitting around passively and waiting around for Karma to work itself out, in those terms.

&quot;The Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force&quot;, yes, I know it, I think it says&quot;storm&quot;, I&apos;m smiling. Yes, it does mean we sometimes have to force ourselves to do what is right due to disposition, but it also means just what I have been going on about, viz, measured and orderly for forcing one&apos;s way into Heaven is not possible because it is unlawful, and it is the reason the best teacher do not tell Heaven&apos;s secrets directly but let the earnest student find them.

All this I&apos;m writing belongs yet in Kindergarten.

I also agree that the stars impel us to certain things but do not compel us to make decisions, and that our ultimate goal is to get off the wheel of rebirth, meanwhile we are here and now.

Indeed, there are those&quot;restored to their original blessed state of oneness with God and all creation, who, whatever they INTEND comes onto being instantaneously in an ever-lasting, imperishable, incorruptible multi-verse of limitless creative freedom&quot;.

To those I bow deeply and respectfully in utter Love and can say no more but only strive to join them.

Thank you kindly for exchanging ideas, I think now I need an interlude.

Post by renwdimgink on Feb 20, 2009, 12:12pm

&quot;There is a pattern which runs through the heavens...&quot;Yea,and not just through the heavens,but throughout all of creation.The tao,or,the WAY in which all things work together for good. This way is the ideal that all of nature follows unquestioningly. This way runs through our own heart as well reveling to us the Divine Intention at every moment.

Unlike all of nature,however,we are given the choice whether to create in harmony and balance with this Divine Intention,or to choose other than what this All-wise,All-knowing,All-loving WAY recommends for us.

Sounds like a no-brainer,right? Choose what God Intends for us!

But in practice it doesn&apos;t seem to work out as easy as that. We want to do what we want to do,regardless of even our own knowing better.

This disregarding of our own conscience gets to be a bad habit until,finally,that,&quot;Still,small voice&quot;within us is almost entirely drowned out by all the other clutter and clatter going on inside of us.

One of the first and most helpful practices of any,genuine spiritual life,is to simply take time to,&quot;Be still and know I AM.&quot;

Here in the west,we have confused our conscience with some sort of arbitrary process of socialization which tries to program into us what OUR culture considers to be&quot;Right&quot;and&quot;wrong&quot;and thus we can rationalize getting around it.

However,our conscience is something which runs much deeper than that.

In Eastern Orthodoxy,(which is Christianity as it was originally understood for the first thousand years,before the church in Rome stepped away from Orthodoxy and formed the roman catholic church...) Our conscience is known by a more succinct term, the&quot;Eye of the heart.&quot;

The Eye of the heart is an organ of perception. As the physical eye looks outward on the visible world, the Eye of the heart looks inward upon invisible realities.

The Prayer of the heart is a practice where we learn to, quietly,place our attention on the Eye of the heart where once again we will rediscover our ability to perceive these invisible realities.

Once our conscience is reawakened,it will not only warn us when we are about to do something that is not really in our best interest, it will prompt us to do well and finally,&quot;Teach us all things and bring all things to our remembrance.&quot; Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Feb 20, 2009, 1:12pm

I am a true believer in the&quot;Sudden School of Enlightenment.&quot;That we are ALREADY clairvoyant wonder-workers who are suffering from amnesia. That true enlightenment consists of simply remembering who and what we really are.

Beneath the layers of the onion, a Diamond,just waiting to be uncovered.

Already,whatever we INTEND with our Thinking/Feeling/Willing, comes into being ,only with a governor stepping down the process for the time being,until we learn how to use this knowledge,this almost limitless power, with responsibility,lest we suffer the fate of the Krell in the movie,&quot;Forbidden Planet.&quot;

The more we become aware of this process of&quot;Intending things into being,&quot;the more&quot;Sudden&quot;it becomes.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Feb 20, 2009, 2:26pm

When we put the wisdom from the&quot;Eye of the Heart&quot;together with this power to INTEND things into being incredible things begin to happen!

Our life even in the&quot;Here and Now&quot;becomes an ongoing creative miracle.

It appears as if we have been the recipients of the ancient Chinese curse,&quot;May you live in interesting times.&quot;These are interesting times indeed! And a time of unprecedented opportunity to go for the Gold. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Ah well. I&apos;ve run on enough.

Post by charlotte on Feb 21, 2009, 9:21am

Hallo again,

With my ending sentence yesterday I didn&apos;t mean to say &apos;thank you I need a rest now&apos;, rather, I am glad someone is communicating with me and I like the word Interlude. As it is here, I am mostly talking to myself, which is ok and a clue that not many people share my love for with Francis Bacon, but only because they don&apos;t know what they&apos;re missing. Just jesting good people It is no different where I live not a soul would give the time of day to talk about the secrets of the universe.

I know what you mean by us having to wake up and become who and what we really are, and that sudden enlightenment happens when we remember who we are. I love those incremental but scoffed at&quot;AHA I knew this all the time but wasn&apos;t aware of it until you mentioned it&quot;moments of shimmering Gold, and with Jerry&quot;I&apos;m only in it for the Gold&quot;, and&quot;In Search of a Lost Cord&quot;all the world is in it for Love.

This ideal pattern running through the heaven, all of creation and our hearts I understand, and that we go against the grain at times, again, I see as part of the process until we are wholly in harmony with it, truly, it excepts nothing but the diamond beneath the layers of the onion, but most of us are still human. Reminds me of Socrates saying that when we pray all we do is flatter God, sometimes it&apos;s less than that.

&quot;Be still and know I AM&quot;once saved what is left of my sanity.

For the most part, I never fell victim to the cultural programming in the US or Germany, so the problem of predispostion arises again: why do some people simply believe and follow the right and wrong of a culture or religion, whereas others reject it von Haus aus and go or forge their own way according to the Eye of their Heart. The ancient Egyptians insist on this wisdom of the Heart which they left with the diseased, but took the dualing brain.

I see the meaning of your second and third post, but it takes a superior/enlightened mind to&quot;INTEND things into being&quot;consciously, some people are aware and thankful for the&quot;governor&quot;, the rest of Humanity doesn&apos;t even know such a one exists. In an old Egyptian account I love, he is called a&quot;treasurer&quot;who kills anybody coming near the treasure, save he has become Siegfried.

The Krell remind me of the dark Atlanteans from &apos;Ad&apos; abusing their limitless power, just so.&quot;They&quot;say that the movie was modeled after the Tempest, which again reinforces my axiom,&quot;Shakespeare is everywhere&quot;, that is, Francis Bacon is everywhere on the planet, in space, and in our lives, but what do they know about the Tempest.

I shall, very carefully, INTEND things into being to ally myself with the clairvoyant wonder-workers, as you call them, appreciating you bringing many things you write to my remembrance and attention.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Feb 21, 2009, 4:06pm

&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;and I both came out in the same year and I strongly maintain that this was no coincidence...We both have the same message for the world which has to do with the spiritual prerequisite of purification and illumination of our sub and unconscious mind BEFORE we are ushered into the kind of reality where whatever we INTEND comes into being instantaneously.

The Krell weren&apos;t bad atlanteans,necessarily. They just went and built this BIG MACHINE that gave them the power to create at will without bothering with the purification and illumination of their sub-conscious/unconscious mind,(the lower two thirds of the iceberg...) so that as soon as they turned on the BIG MACHINE their ID monsters wiped out each other and the whole planet in a single night!

Just exactly what we are doing right now except for the temporary limitations of time/space and the laws of physics,(which are there to protect us from our own worst intentions...)

I&apos;m so glad you are familiar with Forbidden Planet! I highly recommend,if you haven&apos;t seen it lately,to go back and see it again. It has all the secrets of the universe in it!

Better yet,read the book.The story is told from three of the different characters point of view and goes into more depth about certain aspects.

Then of course, as you mentioned, it is really an adaptation of&quot;The Tempest&quot;, which also deserves a re-reading. Prospero,through his magical arts shows the several different groups of characters their inner state,which,for the most part,is not a pretty picture!)

Again,this is exactly how the world reflects back to us our own inner state,if only have eyes to see it.

And finally,there is another book by Mary Stewart,(the same author who wrote that great book about Merlin,&quot;The Crystal cave,&quot;entitled:&quot;This rough magic,&quot;which is a line from&quot;The Tempest.&quot;

In&quot;This rough magic,&quot;which is essentially,a murder mystery set on the island of Corfu in Greece, the main character meets a famous Shakespearean actor who is hiding out there. He has this unusual theory about where Shakespeare,(he didn&apos;t know beans about Bacon...) came up with His ideas for the Tempest.

My ten year old daughter was reading this book and as we had finished whatever we had been reading before bedtime,she suggested that I read to her from this book that she was reading on her own. She hands it to me right at this point where this actor dude is telling us his theory about the source of the Tempest and it totally blew my mind! It just happened to be one of these&quot;Clairvoyant Wonder-workers&quot;I&apos;m always going on about, ST.Spyridon of Tremithus,whom I have a deep veneration for.

If you have a chance look up the life of this ST.Spyridon on the web and you will see what I mean. And read&quot;This rough magic,&quot;if you have a chance.

For me,who have had such an abiding connection with Forbidden Planet all my life,all this was just too much!

So,let me end by saying, we are all clairvoyant wonder-workers at heart. This is what we have always been Intended to be. Once we recognize this,we can begin to consciously co-operate with the process of becoming who and what we ALREADY are. This is why I believe that it is easier than we think it is. It&apos;s not a matter of learning something new,or gradually evolving into something else. It&apos;s simply a matter of REMEMBERING and UNCOVERING what is already there inside of us.

As someone else once said,&quot;The Kingdom of Heaven is within you.&quot;
 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Feb 21, 2009, 4:44pm

It&apos;s funny,(ironic/funny-that is...) that you say,&quot;Most of us are still human.&quot;Especially since Forbidden Planet ends with Leslie Nielsen (!!!) saying,&quot;After all,we&apos;re not God.&quot;

I understand how you meant it,that we still have these limitations,however to be,&quot;Merely human,&quot;is no small thing. Our expectations have been systematically lowered. To be a human being is to be created in the Image and Likeness of God, to be&quot;like&quot;God,as far as possible. (and that&apos;s pretty dang far in my book!)

We have lost the&quot;likeness&quot;to God by choosing other than what God has INTENDED for us,but God wants nothing more than to restore us to our original blessed state, while, at the same time and in the same manner, preparing us to make a graceful transition into the indescribably more glorious life of the world to come.

It&apos;s a matter of aligning our INTENT with God&apos;s as he shows us from micro-second to micro-second via the Eye of the Heart.

As far as prayer goes,it&apos;s a telepathic communication with God that we&apos;re just not very practiced in at this time.

Watch AND pray...These two go together. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Feb 22, 2009, 10:22am

My responses to you were on a much lighter note, as it is most times when someone comes to this site only a short exchange of ideas and opinions takes place.

&quot;It&apos;s not a matter of learning something new, or gradually evolving into something else - simply a matter of REMEMBERING an UNCOVERING what is already there inside of us&quot;, literally brings up the picture of my Philosophy teacher sitting behind his desk, his eyes contacting each of ours, his voice poignant:&quot;You don&apos;t learn who you are, you RE-MEMBER who you are.&quot;Just so. Merlin also learned to set bones.

By the black Atlanteans I meant almost as you describe the Krell, minus the &apos;visible&apos; big machine. They and the Krell were wiped out with their continent and planet, and so was the planet &apos;Genesis&quot;in Startreck, but there are always a few survivors, who with their progeny carry on the work, in Hopi myth those who stand on hill tops and sing praises to the Creator. I always thought Plato&apos;s Atlantis was an event in space between the pillars of Heracles.

So yes, Forbidden Planet, and related movies and stories betoken the secrets of the universe. Interesting is also that theses movies happen in the future with episodes of the far and more recent past. I know Startreck has, goes all the way back to the&quot;Father&apos;s vineyard&quot;, two sons, one doing the fathers will, the other becoming a Klingon,&quot;but he wasn&apos;t so bad.&quot;

The names and relations of persons and space vessels in Forbidden Planet, the Tempest, and Startreck are fitting and telling, it&apos;s really marvelous how the mysteries are kept alive and communicated in this manner. I do see the bigger picture and understand the Kingdom within having always lived more in it then in the outer world, and also that prayer is a telepathic communication with God.

I must thank you again for bringing things profound to my attention for to make graceful transition to the glorious world to come, the article and books of interest you recommend, and will purchase Forbidden Planet for obvious reasons.

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Feb 23, 2009, 5:47pm

The Krell did not set out to misuse the power to create at will.They had the best of intentions.This is what makes their destruction even more of a tragedy. Their only fault was in, (somehow?) neglecting the obvious fact that once they gave their conscious mind the power to create at will,that their sub-conscious and unconscious, in which were buried all kinds of undesirable elements, would also be given the power to create at will and thus, the destruction of the entire race.

This points out for us the absolute necessity for, not only the alignment of our conscious mind with the Divine Intention, but the kind of&quot;Deep Cleaning&quot;of our sub and unconscious mind which only comes with our full co-operation and participation in the&quot;complete package&quot;of a traditional spiritual path.

In the words of Carlos Castenada&apos;s Don Juan,&quot;Find a path with heart,&quot;and follow it all the way to the end.

All too often we will be attracted to ,let&apos;s say, Buddhism, because we like the philosophy expressed in it. But when it comes to actually APPLYING the eight-fold path,that&apos;s a little too extreme for us.

Likewise,there are many&quot;fundamentalist&quot;Christians who consider themselves&quot;Saved,&quot;and then never give another thought to,&quot;Working out our salvation in fear and trembling,lest the salvation bought for us at such a cost is made to be of no effect.&quot;

Or&quot;Urban Shamans&quot;who tend to forget that the original shamans of indigenous cultures usually became such by being struck by lightning, being cured miraculously of some terminal illness, or living an ascetic life commiserate with this type of extreme experience.

In our culture,we want it our way and we want it now.

We CAN have it now, but not often,&quot;Our way.&quot;

In every Traditional spiritual path can be found the thread of this process of Purification/Illumination/Deification which,having taken it up and followed it will lead us directly into the life of the world to come. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Feb 24, 2009, 9:52am

I have no argument against any of your assertions as one can observe them to be so.

As I understand those people we call the Atlantians, similarely to the Krell, had no bad intentions and likewise didn&apos;t heed their conscience and suffered the same demise.

So it is with us today, in simple terms, when the positive rises the negative opposes it, hence the Buddha teaches to chose the Middle Path, and words from one of my books belong:

Mortal Prudence, handmaid of Divine Providence,
hath inscrutable reckoning with Fate and Fortune:
We sail a changeful sea through halcyon days and storm,
and when the ship laboureth, our steadfast purpose
trembles like the compass in a binnacle.
Our stability is but balance...

The three powers of our Soul, Thinking, Feeling and willing form a triune-unity. Where one is found, so are the other two. For every thought we have there is a corresponding feeling and act of will. When we think of something, we either love it or hate it, we try to draw it to ourselves or keep it away.( This is of course way simplified and there are many shades of variation but, you get the basic idea...)

Thinking+ Felling+ Willing= INTENT

Whatever we INTEND comes into being.

Thinking/Feeling/Willing is also known as Mind. There is a direct correlation and interrelationship between Mind and Matter. Our Thinking/Feeling/Willing sets the pattern which sub-atomic particles, atoms, molecules, cells, etc. rush to fill.

We do not create in a vacuum,but, co-cooperatively, all together and within the over-arching context of what God INTENDS into being, moment by moment. Thus, all of creation is an ever-flowing, interdependent, interrelated dance of beings and forces, an ongoing creative miracle at every instant.

Having been created with freedom of will, we are free in every moment to create in harmony and balance with what God INTENDS for us or, to choose other than what God INTENDS. In this way we can learn from our own experience which works out for the best.

God did not create the universe and then step away to see what would happen to it but,continually re-creates it from micro-second to micro-second, giving us the freedom within that framework to create at will.

As we get the hang of how to participate in this creative process with some degree of responsibility,the limits of this present framework will be removed so that, whatever we INTEND will come into being INSTANTANEOUSLY.

The within and the without will become one and the same. The marriage between Heaven and Earth will be fully consummated and the wedding feast will truly begin. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Sometimes feeling rushes in before thinking, and I do agree with the law of attraction and repulsion in the lesser and greater.

I have learned and understand that our THINKING/FEELING/WILLING sets the pattern which sub-atomic particles, atoms, molecules, cells etc. rush to fill, in that order, and sometimes called&quot;thinging&quot;, and one of my teachers called this ongoing and interdependent dance of creation and destruction a dynamic event in the matrix of space.

I think I do, to a very small degree, consciously, participate in the creative process, mindful of my thinking, which overall is not too difficult for me as I am not predisposed to hate, don&apos;t really know the feeling.

Understanding to a degree chemistry and alchemy, I know there is a wedding feast, having gleaned rays of it I do INTEND to partake in it in true time, so to speak.

Another one of my very favorite books that has helped me a great deal throughout my spiritual life is,&quot;Sri Aurobindo or the adventure of consciousness&quot;by Satprem, one of Aurobindo&apos;s disciples.

In this book, which describes Aurobindo&apos;s Integral Yoga, he describes a process of meditation which unfolds step by step by quieting the body,the mind and the&quot;vital,&quot;or emotions and thereby uncovering our&quot;Psychic being,&quot;or soul,which is the true&quot;Us&quot;in us.

In the soul we find our own personal history, including everything we have,&quot;carried over&quot;along with everything we have inherited from all of our ancestors from seven generations and then stretching back all the way to the beginning.

These are the cards we&apos;re dealt that we have to work with, the source of all of our predispositions and most of our decision making process.

Through this form of meditation, which is essentially a stillness at every level of our being, we develop what he calls an ,&quot;Environmental consciousness,&quot;a zone of silence around ourselves wherein we can notice thoughts,feelings and other suggestions from various planes of consciousness which seek to influence as and to engage the three powers of our soul thus making their way into physical manifestation.

In this zone of silence around us we can apprehend and choose whether to let these suggestions in BEFORE they have a chance to hook into us and work their way out.

These various suggestions are not all bad necessarily, but most of them are not good enough! There is a particular level of consciousness which Aurobindo called the&quot;Supramental,&quot;which he hoped to see manifested in earth. A consciousness where this marriage of Heaven and Earth would take place.

What Aurobindo describes so well is in complete harmony with this idea of the&quot;Prayer of the Heart,&apos; and the&quot;Unseen Warfare,&quot;of Eastern Orthodoxy, the only difference being that, in Aurobindo&apos;s yoga, you would call upon himself or,&quot;The Mother,&quot;(Who was his helper in forming their ashram...) Rather than calling upon Jesus for help.

It is written,&quot;Guard the Eye of the Heart from evil suggestions as you would guard your physical eye from a needle.&quot;

Not to mention,&quot;Smack the camel&apos;s nose when he sticks it in through the tent flaps before you have the whole camel in the tent with you! (For our Jihadi friends...)

This practice of both watching and praying is the royal road that leads directly to the Kingdom. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Feb 27, 2009, 9:59am

Indeed, I read some of Sri Aurobindo&apos;s great Wisdom, in fact began my search with Hinduism leading me to Buddhism, back to Christianity, then looked into Islam, which mystical teachings I like, the same as other systems, intermediate always the Neoplatonists, admired and taught by M.P. Hall, and the mystical aspect of the ancient Egyptians.

I&apos;m glad that you acknowledge predispostion, which I know is, if I can say so, and I second the carried over and inheritance from seven generations the Native Americans also teach.

Guarding the Eye of the Heart from evil suggestions as one would guard the physical eye from a needle, is comparable to Mr. Hall&apos;s:&quot;When you come into presence of evil don&apos;t give it another thought&quot;, so yes.

In my way of thinking, the&quot;Supramental&quot;consciousness which revered Aurobindo hoped to see manifest on earth, will and must manifest in due time as Humanity strives upward, whether we are destroyed once again or not, if not, we and the Cosmos have no meaning as in Atheism, and that would be the sadest Estate of Life and living.

Speaking for myself, I see neither my beginning nor end consciously, but do feel that I am immortal. Perhaps I should add that in such a proficient moment in my life, I did &apos;realize&apos; my beginning and end, that I am All and no thing at once, but it sank back into the sub and unconscious. Nevertheless, once consciously perceived it remains as the most powerful vision in the Universe of the Mind.

The camel&apos;s nose is a good visual.

Which brings me to what I have been meaning to say all along concerning the&quot;Countdown to Armageddon&quot;

Once we realize that we are an immortal soul, paradoxically, the highest spiritual practice is one known as,&quot;Remembrance of death.&quot;

Since death is merely a transition from one mode of existence to another, our entire reason for being in this limited framework is to have a good death. The best death is one where we transcend the wheel of birth /death/rebirth and graduate to the Eternal level of being.

We have a unique opportunity to do this at this time. For those who have ears, let them hear.

As far as Armageddon goes, the Lord himself says,&quot;When you see these things begin to happen, look up, for your redemption draweth nigh.&quot;

And in 2nd Peter chapter three, the Apostle Peter asks us,&quot;What manner of persons ought you to be? Looking for and hasting unto the day of God...&quot;

So, when people ask me, am I waiting for the end of the world? I reply,&quot;No. I&apos;m not waiting for it. I&apos;m running towards it!&quot;

Only those who have no idea what comes AFTER the end of the world can have any fear of it.

The&quot;End of the world&quot;is the whole point of a genuine spiritual life. It&apos;s what we&apos;ve been working for and heading towards all along.

And so the&quot;Countdown to Armageddon&quot;is nothing less than the countdown to Ecstasy.

Looking forward to seeing you there! Re: The Secret of the Universe

Post by charlotte on Mar 1, 2009, 8:48am

I have always like these words of St.Paul, and also applied everything being new in the twinkling of eye to the ceaseless transformation of the quantum realm, the Event Universe.

&quot;The best death is one where we transcend the wheel of birth/death/rebirth and graduate to the Eternal level of being.&quot;

I would agree, but, we cannot avoid rebirth until this level is reached and the Teachers agree this has to be achieved here, so yes, it takes our participation to speed up the process, especially since the signs of the time seem to foreshadow Armageddon.

I have a very vage idea of what might come AFTER the end of the world, which Estate you qualify with such confidence in your last sentence. It is problematic to take another&apos;s word for something unknown to one&apos;s self.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Mar 2, 2009, 5:21am

To sum up: Many people seem to focus on the negative aspects which will take place leading up to the&quot;End of the world,&quot;not recognizing in them the undesirable elements of our own individual and collective inner state being reflected back to us in our outer environment.

However, for those who do recognize this,&quot;Secret of the universe,&quot;there is an opportunity to become aware of and to change our inner state and thereby begin to live a miraculous life even now in this world which is otherwise, coming apart at the seams.

How? By actively participating in the spiritual practice recommended to us within the full context of our chosen spiritual path.

In this manner, we can not only begin to live as if it were the next world already in this world, we can also be prepared to make a simple and graceful transition into another KIND of reality altogether. A reality that is indescribably more glorious than even the first-created paradise. A world of limitless creative freedom where,whatever we INTEND comes into being instantaneously and is in complete sympathy,harmony and balance with ALL THAT IS. An endless and imperishable world where goodness, truth, beauty, peace, love and joy are the most prominent characteristics.

But, by all means,don&apos;t just take my word for it! (After all, who am I but some anonymous crazy person who has made his way onto your web site?) Make the experiment and see if it doesn&apos;t work for you.

(I may be mad, but it&apos;s a very pleasant form of madness,you must admit!)

This is really all I had to say on this forum here. I thank you for taking the time to listen to my rantings and ravings and hope they are at least, of some small benefit.

And with that I bid you all a fond farewell. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Hi Charlotte.

I see the discussion of finding the clear awareness of the inner eye has still been ongoing. It is difficult to overcome the thinking process or the serpent who speaks of the madness viewed as a personal thing&quot;Me&apos; and &apos;Mine&apos;, whereas it is born of our universal creative nature. The madness is not therefore ours, and it is the point of practice to be firstly very kind to all arising activity within - this is the hardest part as the ego always seeks perfection of the illusionary &apos;Self&apos;. It&apos;s good to a a &apos;Not-Body&apos;. I read renwdimgink has the idea.

I hope all has been going well for you, it rained in CA so Lilly tells me from her talk to Miley C. Lilly gets to talk to lots of people these days whereas I don&apos;t get to talk to many at all. But maybe that will change now as I&apos;m feeling back to health - though I cannot get to the point where my household duties can be neglected, which did happen before.

My Kindest regards - Paul. Re: The Secret of the Universe

This weekend I was shown the latest technological marvel of the telecommunications industry; the long awaited video phone: a mechanical device which allows people to see and hear and communicate with each other at a distance. It&apos;s a miracle!
And yet St. Spyridon, St. Nicholas, St. Stephen of Perm, St. Sergius of Radonezh, St. Xenia, and all of the many, many clairvoyant wonder workers whom the church remembers and recognizes were able to see, hear, and communicate over a distance without the assistance of any mechanical devices merely by using their own purified and illumined consciousness.
Perhaps our modern technology is not so much a sign of mastery as it is of a terrible powerlessness and the loss of our own natural abilities, (Which technology tends to mimic and be a caricature of.)
Crutches can be a helpful tool for someone who has broken their legs however, it seems to me to be the height of folly to prefer the crutches over the use of our own legs and to build better and better crutches rather than to do the therapy prescribed by our doctors which would give us back the use of our own legs.
As far as I&apos;m concerned the&quot;video phone&quot;is a pair of crutches for our own broken consciousness. Its up to us how we look at the crutches, as a temporary form of assistance while we do the therapy, which enables us to get back the use of our own legs or something better than having our own legs the choice is ours! (If we are given a choice that is... and in our present culture?)
 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Mar 26, 2009, 8:39am

This must be a newer and improved version of the video phone. About a year ago, during the Iraq war, and broadcasting from other places, reporters used the device though image and voice was somewhat distorted.

The positive, crutches as a temporary form of assistance is, that people can communicate the world over until the collective mind of Humanity has reached the critical point to once more accept that telepathic communication is not some notion of across the board gullible New Agers picked up from the diluted and superstitious Philosophers, and Mystics to which Saints belong, as they are described by those who haven&apos;t a clue. Science, the anticeptic sceptics, and organized religions have convinced the many: it is unscientific, it is laughable, all you need is Jesus. And so people don&apos;t believe that when they pick up the phone to call somebody and that somebody is &apos;on the line&apos; without the phone ever ringing, a telepathic communication was involved.

The Rosicrucian writer Wishar S. Cerv, in his book&quot;LEMURIA&quot;, subtitled&quot;The Lost Continent Of The Pacific&quot;, and please pardon me but I must say&quot;dedicated to the memory and everlasting greatness of character - of Sir Francis Bacon - that brilliant mind and soul&quot;who&quot;made the first researches into the history of Atlantis and Lemuria&quot;, states:

&quot;We may find, for instance, that the method which the Lemurians had for communicating to great distances was a higher phase of scientific achievement than our present day radio, for I have already explained to you that the Lemurians were capable of mental communications, regardless of distance, through the effort of a faculty which we have dubbed&quot;mental telepathy.&quot;This would indicate that whereas we have placed our faith in the forces of nature, such as electricity, and have created machinery for the transmission of this energy from one distant place to another, the Lemurians proceeded along much higher lines and developed a faculty within their own beings for the transmission of an energy more refined and higher in its vibrations than the crude electrical energy we use. Their means for distant communications was not surrounded by cumbersome equipment and by interferences from electrical storms and by rules and regulations and by finances.&quot;

This is updated now. The terrible powerlessness and loss of our natural ability, which technology tends to mimic and be a caricature of, is a perfect example as above so below.

It&apos;s sad indeed that people are made to feel worth and importance by walking about text messaging endlessly and a phone in their ear talking ceaslessly as if unable to stop, even if it is in the supermarket asking what kind of shampoo they should bring home, or&quot;i&apos;m at the gas station now&quot;.

The garbage the world is floating on has overwhelmed people, and I see no remedy other than a mental quake of 10, or 1000 years of education regarding this natural ability we have, which stifles all of us when the receiver of a thought negates it at once, as that thought then is prevented from benefitting another.

The monkeys are better at telepathic communications because they ignore the noise. So do I.

The&quot;christians&quot;have forgotten that Jesus came not only to&quot;save&quot;us, but to be an example of how each of us was originally Intended to be. We were created in the Image and Likeness of God,created to be&quot;Like&quot;God, as far as possible,(Which is purty dang far in my book!)

The salvation that Jesus came to give us is nothing more than a cure for the state of amnesia that we have all been suffering from.

Any traditional spiritual path,if applied, will help us to remember who and what we already are, but have simply forgotten. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Mar 26, 2009, 2:01pm

The spiritual life has a goal. It is trying to accomplish something in us. Once we understand the goal then we can understands the MEANS for accomplishing our goals which are prescribed for us by our various spiritual traditions.

The goal is quite simple:To restore us entirely to our original blessed state of oneness with God and all of creation, whereby we regain our&quot;Likeness&quot;to God which we have lost. How and why do we regain our&quot;Likeness&quot;to God? Because our inner state creates our outer environment.

Jesus says:&quot;Seek ye FIRST the Kingdom of God and all else shall be added unto you.&quot;And:&quot;The Kingdom of Heaven is within you,&quot;Already. The&quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;is a state of mind, a state of being which automatically creates a Heavenly&quot;place&quot;for us.

The goal is not to become something we aren&apos;t yet, or to gain something we haven&apos;t got yet, but simply to REMEMBER our own true nature. (Which makes it all so much easier to actually accomplish!)

So, once we recognize the goal, we can then APPLY the principles prescribed for us and, IF WE DO SO, they will work! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Mar 27, 2009, 9:23am

The Christians don&apos;t think too much when they read the Bible, can&apos;t because so much of what is writ is beyond understanding. I grew up a Catholic, didn&apos;t know what that meant, let alone what was taught to us, therefore I could never believe any of it. In fact, even as a child I ignored all the noise they made, lived my inner Life, but did as I was told so they left me alone.

Can one believe, and more importantly, accept, truly and in one&apos;s heart, what one doesn&apos;t understand ? Nothing they said ever rang a bell, &apos;a rememberance&apos;, an inkling=inner sound in German.

I don&apos;t believe in an historical Jesus, but a spiritual incarnation of a divine mind, for lack of a better term, to, yes, show the way to the life to the truth of who we are. The Pope with his &apos;fish&apos; hat and staff is as the moving image of Hermes, the Mind Divine. The Pope lives daily with Raphael&apos;s&quot;School of Athens&quot;in his private quarters, but does he, or&quot;they&quot;ever point it out to their flock, much less explain who is pointing to heaven?

I agree that we are made in the image of God as a Creator can only create what he is made of, and he is made of everything and all attributes and faculties, hence&quot;ye are gods&quot;. This I can understand by the fact that I can only create a post of what I am made of now by virtue of learning to bring about an &apos;aha&apos;, i knew this all the time=remembering.

What is seeking the Kingdom of God, the Heaven within, which you call&quot;a state of mind&quot;, and I agree, but&quot;Know Thyself&quot;, echoing from the Temple of Apollo and across the ages, and as far as I can tell by&quot;remembering myself&quot;, a thing one should do habitually according to Gurdjieff, though I forget many times due to other concerns, I do re-member myself as often as I think about these things, and when I am alone I thing about all the time.

So, I do seek the Kingdom of Heaven, that state of mind of being wholly conscious of all things and knowing the meaning of all things above and below which art in that Heaven.

Could there possibly be a genuine baby amongst all that bath water? Me thinks so... We really all are telepathic whether we realize it or not. To find out if Jesus actually exists or not, all one need do is make the experiment and direct one&apos;s telepathic abilities towards Him and there will be no doubt as to His existence.

As far as the Roman catholic church is concerned, they began stepping away from the truth of Christianity in 800 ad and made it official in 1065 so I don&apos;t expect much from them. Then the protestants wanted to reform the church but unfortunately didn&apos;t think to reconnect with the original Church that the Romans stepped away from in the first place, which, nevertheless, continued to exist...

Setting all that aside for a moment... There is an excellent little book entitled,&quot;Memories and visions of Paradise,&quot;which compares the similar beliefs of many different traditional spiritual paths about a lost golden age and a restoration and fulfillment of all things yet to come.

If Christianity doesn&apos;t make sense to someone, there are plenty of other means at arriving at the same destination. The trick is to pick ONE of them and make use of the WHOLE package as offered.

I prefer Christianity because of my own personal experience with it, but by no means am I a chauvinist about it. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Fitting pictures to wise and moving lyrics, but I cry easy.

As to throwing out a genuine baby with the bath water, I did, but began my quest concerning religious mysteries on a clean slate, and later yet again from square one, happened, or better, was led to the Philosophers and teachers who spoke my language, that is to say, taught in a manner that rang bell&apos;s in unisome=remembering.

Exoterically and esoterically they instructed us in the four dominent religious systems silmultaneously, shewing the&quot;arrival at the same destination&quot;, and found the genuine baby. The story of the Christ Child being born in a manger attended by gentle animals, his family fleeing to Egypt, his being raised, words and actions, his agonizing stations to his crucifixion, resurrection and glorious transfiguration, his predetermined mission. In the human skull=Golgotha, so termed by the medical profession to this day, the manger is the 3rd ventricle of the brain between the petuitary and pineal gland, the latter being the seat of the soul of Philosophers, or all seeing eye, whence flows the elixir for regeneration.&quot;When thine eye is single thine whole body is filled with Light&quot;I.N.R.I. I doubt very much I am telling you something you don&apos;t know, just how I think to understand.

In the former golden age, when gods walked the earth and instructed humaity, the Egyptians affirm, the pineal gland, together with other senses, was the agent for telepathic communication for all in varying power, obviously more so by those you call wonderworkers. Even though no atrophied, the gland can be excited by ardent desire to among other things, achieve such communication, but there is much interference from the mind/thoughts hard to give a rest.

&quot;To find out if Jesus actually exists, direct your telepathic abilitiestoward Him and there will be no doubt as to His existence.&quot;You speak in the present tense as described above, maybe, I spoke of the story as taught by the church in the dead letter of the word. I actually saw Jesus once in a dream, but dismissed it as a reflection of his most popular image, besides, he curced those that worshiped his image.

Gods become men and men become gods. I have no doubt because evident, that such an annointed child is born in and for times of great transition, as in the Bible Jesus tells one of the Apostles, I think, to go in the street and follow a man with a water pitcher to a house with a room upstairs, the Zodiac, and the Aquarian Age is upon us, after himself, the fish.

The Egyptians show clearly the Ram and Taurus ages, deified Kings, foremost another carpenter,&quot;The Great Seer&quot;Imhotep,&quot;sculptor and maker of stone vases&quot;, one who is&quot;near&quot;the head of the King, Chancelor of the King of Lower Egypt, First after the King of Upper Egypt, High Priest of Helopolis, Healer&quot;and naturally a&quot;Poet&quot;, and it has been pointed out many times that Jesus is the stone the Builders rejected, the Cap Stone of the Great Pyramid.

I suppose that makes me a Christian, but I would never admitted to people I know, lest they want to take me to their church.

The journey &apos;to&apos; the center of the mind is not a pleasure, but the most perilous journey there is. All demons have to faced, terrible even for those who have not many, horrifying for those who have more. I guess that is why they say&quot;if you dare&quot;.

Where things are really not.

But even the Immortals come back where things are.

Yes indeed. The power of thought. The secret of the universe right there in a kiddy cartoon.

Although very eclectic in my tastes and beliefs, I, personally, have been an Orthodox Christian for the past twenty years or so and anything I might have to say about Christianity is from that context.

The Orthodox Church is historically, the first Church, formed by the Apostles and their direct descendants in an unbroken lineage until today. Unlike the Roman church,which stepped away from Orthodoxy and the nearly 3000 protestant and other denominations which subsequently broke away from Rome, the Orthodox Church has preserved and handed down it&apos;s original beliefs and practices, unchanged.

These beliefs and practices are concerned with one thing and one thing only, a process of Purification, Illumination, and Deification, which takes the entirely unique individual believer who practices it, Purifies, heals, fills with light and renders them God-like. The Church has two thousands years worth of Sanctified men and women whose lives bear witness to this way of life. I highly recommend it, but try not to&quot;push&quot;it on any one. Those who I do speak to about it I tell the same thing that I tell my own children:&quot;I&apos;m not telling you that you HAVE to believe what the Church teaches about Christianity, all I&apos;m asking is that you consider for a moment what it would mean IF it were true? What would the implications be in our own lives if that were the case? And see if you don&apos;t have your OWN experience of these things.&quot;

This process of Purification/Illumination?Deification is what allows us to make that&quot;journey to the center of the mind&quot;and to come out the other side free from the influence of the&quot;Monsters from the ID&quot;which were the downfall of the poor Krell and to begin our lives as the clairvoyant wonder-workers we have always been meant to be who, whatever they INTEND comes into being INSTANTANEOUSLY in complete balance and harmony with ALL-THAT-IS.

Are we seeing a common theme here? I&apos;m not surprised. It&apos;s been like this for me since I was 14 yrs old...

I actually like churches, but not the sermons and many people present, visit them mostly on vacation. I have always known that a True Teaching is preserved, and the Church you describe sounds very much like such a place where they are guarded.

And so,Orthodoxy is the path I was led to which has worked very well for me. However,it may not be everyone&apos;s cup of tea. I have been known to recommend that out of all the spiritual paths that are out there, an individual should choose one and follow it.

It&apos;s always nice to have a good philosophy of life to believe in, but in order to actually ACCOMPLISH the aim of our spiritual life we need a PRACTICE as well as a philosophy.

Let&apos;s not forget, the thread in this forum which we are pursuing is&quot;Countdown to Armageddon.&quot;

Whether that turns out to be 2012, The end of the world, The second coming of Christ, or simply the end of our own life, sooner or later we WILL be ushered into another kind of reality than this one and it behooves us to be ready for that eventuality

When people ask me if I am,&quot;waiting for the end of the world,&quot;I tell them,&quot;No. I&apos;m not waiting for it. I&apos;m running towards it!&quot; Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Apr 1, 2009, 8:28am

A chosen place in Nature for such an unusual Monastery, I can see why you would visit there, and I think you are very fortunate to have the Abbot as God-Father, pardon me.

The church itself is beautiful in its architecture and golden steeples. Fr. Seraphim maybe its founder, as is the customary term, his cell under a tree, his grave and the cross also atypical.

The interior, and Partiarchs depicted remind me of the old Coptic Church in Cairo. I tried twice to log in to read more, but failed.

I have not followed any spiritual path, perhaps because none spoke profound enough to my soul and heart to hold me, but pretty much practice do unto others, it&apos;s not saying much but enough to live with myself until I can make the next step.

Here is a web site about another monastery in Arizona where my daughter has been going to school. There is a very good article on Orthodoxy on there which you might enjoy,(at the link entitled: Excellent article)

 http://www.stpaisiusmonastery.org/monastery.htm 

Also, they have a book for sale at their bookstore which I highly recommend,&quot;The spiritual life and how to be attuned to it&quot;by St. Theophan the recluse

Have to bring my son to college. Talk with you later.

Bye for now! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Apr 1, 2009, 12:20pm

I&apos;m back. Just re-read that article on St.Paisius&apos;s web site. It really is excellent and points out many of the reasons why I love Orthodoxy.

I can understand your difficulty in finding ,&quot;A path with heart.&quot;Perhaps these really are the end times. Everything has been so corrupted. Even Orthodoxy from it&apos;s exposure to the modern world has suffered. This is why my wife and I love the monasteries in particular. There, they have gone out of their way to preserve and hand down the unadulterated truth. There,lay people, even if they have no intention of becoming monastics, can go to be refreshed and to receive spiritual guidance which they can bring with them back into their Parrish communities. (Which is what we do here where we live.)

In choosing a spiritual path, it is helpful to go back to the earliest sources and try to find an unbroken lineage from those sources,( which, again, is difficult to find in our day and age...)

A Genuine spiritual life is more often than not, handed down from one individual to another, in a personal transmission forming a golden chain of sanctity, of which,we then, become living links. There is only so much we can get from books,(although,don&apos;t get me wrong, books are great and there are many that I would prefer to be stranded on a desert island with than many of the people I have met...)

And speaking of books, besides&quot;The Spiritual life and how to be attuned to it,&quot;here are several more of my favorites:&quot;The First-created man&quot;by St.Symeon the new Theologian,&quot;Writings from the Philokalia on the prayer of the heart&apos; and&quot;Elder Nektary of Optina&quot;Strange sounding titles,perhaps, but, once you get a&quot;taste&quot;for them, they are capable of transmitting an experience of&quot;Otherworldliness&quot;which is rare in our day and age.

It&apos;s strange.On the one hand, spirituality has seemed to decline in the modern world,and yet, paradoxically, for those who really want it,it is just as available and attainable?

Dear Charlotte,
No need to apologize, but, once again, I have kind of reached the limit of what I have to say....

What more is there? The way is there for everyone and anyone who cares to make use of it.

If any one has any specific questions to ask, I could do my best to try to answer them, but you have to remember that I am no one very special or experienced. I just happened to have been fortunate enough to be led into something that worked for me. There are many much more experienced individuals than myself, (my God-Father, Fr. Gerasim, for example.)

So, if it sounds like I&apos;m saying goodbye, it&apos;s most certainly not because of any deficiencies on your part, It&apos;s just that I&apos;ve said all that there is for me to say.

Yes, the subject is of great interest. The reason I noted the story in the faces of the Monks was, that only one was smiling, the others as if they had seen a grave and solemn secret.

Peace be with you as well.

There is a level of conscious awareness where one feels the repercussions and consequences of, not only one&apos;s one disharmony and imbalance, but that of the whole world, while at the same time, knowing the great joy and freedom available to all, if only they knew....

Each one of us who remembers who and what they really are, makes it a little easier for everyone else to remember.

I know whereof you speak apropos the conscious awareness of feeling one&apos;s own and the whole worlds disharmony and imbalance.

However, I have experienced complete harmony with myself while clearly seeing disharmony in people all around me, and it really takes only a few words to lessen their concerns. Maybe that is a small part of the remembering.

I will send you a link to their web site with all the details. I am also sending a link to a picture of myself, my wife, Barbara and two of our children, speaking with Bishop Maxim on one of His visits to our Parrish.

Beautiful Cathedral of St. Steven in Alhambra, maybe I&apos;ll go and have a look at it some time, which you seem to suggest that Orthodox Religion may have&quot;The Secrets of the Universe&quot;, and who would not want to know.

I also looked at the Celebration pictures, seems to be a Patriarchal Religion, men to one side, women to the other, as in Islam, and also wearing identical and similar head coverings, perhaps coming from the same notion that women are impure, poor us. I really don&apos;t know the doctrine and how the Church views these things.

Thanks also for the personal picture of a happy and devoted family, nice to see.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Apr 17, 2009, 1:15am

Dear Charlotte,
When approaching Orthodoxy, it is helpful to set aside all spiritual stereotypes and negative connotations. Everything about Orthodoxy is positive and has one aim in mind, (At the risk of repeating myself,) to restore the human person to their original blessed state while at the same time and in the same manner, preparing them to make a graceful transition into another kind of reality.

Orthodoxy is a Patriarchal religion in the sense that only men are ordained into the ecclesiastical hierarchy to serve the Church by administering the Sacraments to the congregation.

My wife and I owned and operated an Orthodox bookstore in Chicago after we were first married, (19 years ago...) Many women who visited us there asked us,&quot;What role was there for women in the Orthodox Church? Can women be ordained to the priesthood?&quot;I would invariably answer, that,&quot;If they wanted to be ordained to the Priesthood, they should join the Episcopal church. However, if they wanted to become Saints, they should join the Orthodox Church!&quot;

Becoming a Priest is no guarantee of attaining Sanctity, but becoming a Saint is.

Orthodoxy has produced the greatest number of Saints, both men and many,many women, than any other spiritual path that I am familiar with.

In fact, Women have very active roles within the Church. Many of the Elders of the Church have been Women who are entrusted with giving spiritual direction to those who are in need of it.

And, like Mary and Jesus at the wedding in Cana, it was Mary who came to Jesus and said,&quot;Son, they have no more wine.&quot;While Men are Blessed to serve a particular function within the Church, nine times out of ten, it&apos;s the women who have to bring to the man&apos;s attention what it is he should be doing!

In the pictures, the men are on one side and the women on the other because we are celebrating in a Monastery, out of respect for the Monastics, who have taken a vow of celibacy.

And, who told you that Women cover their heads in Church because they are impure? Is THAT what they teach in Islam? Sounds like another one of those distortions of the original teachings as we discussed earlier about the true nature of Jihad as inner warfare.

According to St.Paul in Corinthians 10:11, Women should cover their heads in Church,&quot;For the sake of the Angels.&quot;Why for the Angels? Because in the account in Genesis chapter 6, just before the flood, that,&quot;The Sons of God saw the daughters of men and came down and took wives of them,&quot;Causing giants to be born and lots of other problems which led up to the flood.

In the same vein, women cover their heads in Church to remind the men that they are our sisters,our wives,our mothers and as such, deserve to be treated with the utmost of care,consideration and respect.

It&apos;s interesting, but, all of these questions have to do with the fact that human sexuality is seen in the Church as a Sacred Mystery. A Mystery, in the sense that it has to do with invisible realities which we, usually, don&apos;t perceive. Men and women are not the same. They are meant to be complimentary. And sex is, generally, the most misunderstood and misused aspect of our lives. The Church in recognition of these facts, provides very clear guidelines for those who wish to reach the totality of oneself.

This week is Holy week in the Church and this Saturday evening begins the Feast of the Resurrection of Christ.

By rising from the dead, Jesus has become the firstborn of many brethren (and sistren...)

Check out the schedule on their web site and see when you might like to go. I&apos;m sure you will like Bishop Maxim. He&apos;s very young, but, very Theologically sound.

Needless to say,I will be very interested to see what kind of an experience you might have. (Probably none and you&apos;ll think,&quot;Who is this crackpot i&apos;ve been listening to all this time? What does he know about the secret of the universe! Hmmpf!&quot;)
 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Apr 17, 2009, 1:47am

There was one other thing I wanted to say on this subject of human sexuality, (although, of course, we are just scratching the surface here...)

In the Orthodox Church there are two recognized paths which lead to Sanctity, marriage and monasticism. Outside of those two it becomes increasingly more difficult and demanding as evidenced by the lives of the many homeless wanderers,fools for Christ&apos;s sake and single people who live like monastics, by themselves, out in the midst of the world, whom the Church recognizes and remembers.

When I was about 33 years old, I made a prayer:&quot;God,&quot;I said,&quot;I&apos;m getting old. As much as I love the monastery, I don&apos;t feel called to become a monk. If you want me to get married, you will have to send someone for me to marry, because I don&apos;t feel like looking around for someone. Of course, I wouldn&apos;t mind being a homeless wanderer all my life, if you will bless!

Within about three months from making that prayer, my wife-to-be walked into the Church I was attending in Boston at the time and I knew, instantly that she was the answer to my prayer. And within another six months or so, we were married. Ah. How romantic! And 19 years and three children later, we are still happily married. Not bad in this day and age... Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Apr 17, 2009, 10:11am

P.S. Another extremely important addendum: Unless you are either a Bishop, or A Priest-Monk, all of the other clergy in the parishes out in the world, are married and have their own families.

The Roman church changed the nature of monasticism, from being an avenue of self-transformation, to an army of missionaries and social-workers and then forced ALL of the priests to be celibate, both with disastrous results ! (And the protestants simply did away with both...)

So, here again, is another, very active role for women in the Church. To be a Parish Priest&apos;s wife is no small thing. It is very much like the example of Jesus and Mary at the wedding at Cana. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Apr 18, 2009, 8:34am

Writing my reply, &apos;spiritual stereotypes and negative connotations&apos; crossed my mind in the manner you mean it, but I thought by now you know my views and predisposition well enough to know how I meant it, being aware of the vow of celibacy, to which also belongs women cover their heads&quot;for the sake of the Angels. Perhaps, and with due respect, a little credit is due to me.

Therefore also, I am not the kind of mind who would go into a bookstore of any religion and ask,&quot;what&apos;s in it for women&quot;, as probably&quot;Women-Liber&apos;s&quot;, as they are called, of shallow thinking might do, as I know the&quot;origin&quot;of the degenerated interpretation of why women are inferior, or&quot;married to the Devil&quot;as one Muslim showed me on the cover of a book, smiling, and I smiled back thinking..........and no way, and nothing to be gained, for me to tell him what I was thinking.

Even in the Western World, most men have this seemingly hardwired attitude of superiority ascribing little importance to women bringing to his attention what it is he should be doing. I do know that women and men are different, serving a different purpose, and meant to be complimentary, and understand&quot;Son, they have no more wine&quot;.

You presume the I may have&quot;none&quot;experience by visiting the Orthodox Church, and if I thought you a crackpot knowing nothing about the secrets of the Universe, I would not be responding to you, Sir.

&quot;God, if you want me to get married, you will have to send someone for me to marry, because I don&apos;t feel like looking around for someone - and three month later&quot;you met your&quot;wife-to-be - and within another six month or so, we were married&quot;. It sounds romantic and I am glad that it worked out so well and you are still happily married.

Here we have something in common, i.e., making a prayer to God for something and having it answered, never looking for anyone to have a close relationship or marry. There were four instances in my life when my Prayer was answered. One of them, a women offering me $60.000 without me ever asking, in response to asking God for help a few days prior, the other three of a personal nature. Sometimes God even hands me a paper clip or some other such small thing, when I need one, a certain feeling comes with it on such occasions. Does this mean God loves me even though I don&apos;t belong to the Orthodox Church? Yes, I know, our main concern here is about being restored to our original blessed state and preparing for a graceful transition into another kind of reality.

During the years I have also learned the Roman church, in your good words, changing the nature of monastesism, from being an avenue of self-tranformation, to an army of missionaries and social-workers and then forced ALL of the priests to be celibate, both with disastrous results. Not having to make quotation symbols.

I can discern and appreciate the example of Jesus and Mary at the wedding of Cana being very much like the active role of a Priest&apos;s wife.

Thank you for the good information.

Tonight is the big night. Feast of Feasts. Holy day of Holy days.

Services begin at 11pm. I would plan to get there at least a half an hour earlier, the place is going to be packed!

The service itself is like an opera. Most of it is sung. It is an opera in which the&quot;audiance&quot;not only watches, but participates in, as well.

There are 5 levels of attention with their corresponding blessings that one can experience during services...

You gave me adequate notice as to the Feast, but Alhambra is quite a distance from where I live and I am totally unfamiliar with area, and 11 is a bit late after a long day work and having to work today also. I might go this coming free weekend, maybe better with not so many people. I must be what is called an unsociable person.

As you describe it, I am sure it was a wonderful experience for you and family, and I&apos;m sorry I missed out, and not meaning to be presumptous, maybe you asked a blessing for a homeless wanderer.

I understand entirely. I was hoping that by some weird coincidence, that you lived right in Alhambra! But,I guess that was too much to hope for...

Anytime you make it there would be fine. Check their web site to see if Bishop Maxim will be there when you go. He travels a lot.

We had a great Pascha here. As usual, God gave me a little taste of the secret of the universe, which I will sum up for you here:

&quot;In this world, which is defined by inescapable necessities, God will bless us, help us with everything and provide for us everything that is needful for our complete salvation. And in the next world: Limitless creative freedom in complete harmony with ALL-THAT IS with no more NEEDS of any kind.&quot;

From my youth up ,I have felt, very strongly, that anything God happens to show me, is not for me alone, but applicable to anyone and everyone who might be interested.

And so,I offer this little bit to you,(and whatever other invisible audience might be out there looking on...) Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Apr 20, 2009, 8:22am

Beautiful and unusual painting, Christ in the process of bringing the two camps together. The people in the video scare me.

If I lived in Alhambra, I&apos;m sure I would have heard of said Church. It&apos;s interesting that Alhambra, Spain, was built by an unknown architect, and intrigued me since long, as well as Andalusia, Granada, and Toledo.

I checked out their website some when you posted it. In any case, I have to go when time permits, my work being demanding, and hopefully I&apos;m lucky to meet Bishop Maxim.

Thanks also for the summation, I have actually experienced complete harmony with all that is, having everything and needing absolutely nothing, so I do feel blessed. Something like George Harrison&apos;s&quot;All I have is yours, all you see is mine&quot;.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Apr 20, 2009, 12:00pm

You&apos;re right about the people in the video.It is kind of scary. It takes place every year on Pascha at the Church of the Holy sepulcher in Jerusalem. It&apos;s really crazy there, however, and nevertheless, a miracle takes place there every year during this service,(but, for some reason, they never report it in the mainstream media...)

The Patriarch of Jerusalem goes into the tomb where Jesus was buried,(which the Church there is built around,) with a bundle of 33 candles. He says certain prayers and at a certain point, this blue mist rises off of the tomb and ignites the candles. He then brings the lighted candles out of the tomb and lights the candles of the thousands of pilgrims candles who are there. Sometimes,the people outside the tomb, waiting for the Patriarch to come out, see flashes of blue light flashing around inside the Church as well and their candles light spontaneously as well. The flame on these candles is cool for the first half hour or so, and doesn&apos;t burn. You can see people washing themselves in the flames.

This has been happening every year since the Church was first built in the fourth century. I wonder why nobody ever told us about this before?

But it is crazy in there, between all of the different ethnic groups there and the Israeli police trying to preserve order and watch out for terrorists and all. It is like a madhouse in there. Definitely not a calm and serene service like most of the rest of ours generally are.

I have friends who live there and go who attest to how incredible it actually is thogh. I would like to go myself someday if possible. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Apr 21, 2009, 8:21am

Pascha is an interesting word for the Celebration.

I remember very vaguely, way back, hearing once of the blue mist phenomenon, mostly I remember seeing people washing their faces, I think, in the flame of the candles. To my thinking, the Patriarch with 33 candles speeks words of power causing the blue mist to rise, the process mysterious to me.

That it is not reported by mainstream media is not surprising, as such things belong in the world of the credulous as far as the&quot;scientific only - we are now sophisticated people&quot;reporters are concerned. I notice this many times when they report such things with tongue in cheek and certain looks to each other. I wrote to such a person once concerning the Sphinx, he actually wrote back and thought it was interesting and hoped to go to Egypt one of his days.

It would be great to see it for oneself.

Most intriguing, and hitherto unknown to me, but as my father used to say, there is someone in New York who doesn&apos;t know everything either. I can easily agree with Church Politics, yet it is known to so many.

If the Miracle was a fraud, I would think the fire would burn what it touches. I can see why it is called Holy Light and Holy Fire, alternatively.

Post by charlotte on Apr 26, 2009, 5:59pm

There I went. Driving through the gates of St. Steven&apos;s with its Golden Domes I felt like entering a peaceful oasis, the grounds and large parking lot beautifully layed out and meticulously kept.

The Cathedral is beautiful and, as anticipated, differs from the norm, and what I for one, thought of as&quot;orthodox&quot;. I was one of the first people and had time to look about seeing familiar figures portrayed somewhat more natural as is the Virgin Mother above the Altar. To my delight I saw Coat of Arms and other things I heard about, and not one cross with a crucified Jesus on it.

A grand Chandelier and smaller candle holders, lights and flowers everywhere, windows reminiscent of other Temples, but Father Checo and a few other people were already singing and I couldn&apos;t walk about.

The 3 hour Cermon does resemble an Opera in that people wander in during the singing before the Liturgy. I also liked the participation of the people, and&quot;let us be attentive&quot;every so often, but you all of this. I haven&apos;t crossed myself in a long time, but did as the Others, and it became more natural after a while. I also noticed people reaching to the ground before crossing themselves, and walking toward communion they had their arms crossed over their chest.

A stranger, I didn&apos;t want to walk up at the end and receive bread, but argh the entrance was closed and I had to, and a Lady behind me said to the Father&quot;she is new here&quot;, and he gave me the bread with a smile and I felt totally awkward.

We walked out and the Lady asked,&quot;are you Armenian&quot;, huh, no, I said, I am German. She said&quot;we&apos;re having lunch now, would you like to join us?&quot;Double huh, people all around us causing me to be uncomfortable,&quot;Thank you, maybe next time.&quot;Smiling, she said,&quot;I understand&quot;. In all, it was an uplifting experience.

Alhambra is not as far as I thought, 32 m from where I live. Looking for the Cathredral I crossed Hilliard and Hampton St., so familiar from my studies apropos Bacon. Seeing the Freeways merging with the one I took, I shortened my way back by 7 miles. Not that it mattered, it was such a gorgeous day that half way home I thought I should have gone in the opposite direction for a long drive in the the San Bernadino Mountains.

I lived in Arizona for 3 month, 1 hour west of Phoenix in the Harquahalla Valley. My cat Schlimpi and I almost wilted in the unbearable heat, with airconditioning, but the so awesome starry night sky almost made up for it. Almost, one day we just took off due north and ended up in Tuba, then back near the Pacific.

It&apos;s probably more than what you wanted to hear/read. I understand better now:

Peace be with you!

Congratulations! I am so glad that you were able to go!

I would like to, at this time, to go into a little more detail about&quot;The five levels of attention and their corresponding blessings&quot;which it is possible to experience during the Divine services.

1st level of attention: Our body is in the Church building but our mind is somewhere else entirely,(What will I be doing later on today? What shall I have for lunch? Wasn&apos;t that fun last night...etc.,etc.) It is very rare for us,in our present condition to,&quot;Be Here Now&quot;, (As Ram Das so cleverly put it...) And yet, God blesses us just for showing up.

2nd level of attention: We&apos;re in Church and we&apos;re actually paying attention to what is going on. We are looking at the Icons,observing the architecture,listening to the prayers that are being said,we&apos;re trying to understand all of the symbolism involved,we&apos;re trying to understand what it all is supposed to mean and we&apos;re asking ourselves this all important question,&quot;IF all of this were ACTUALLY TRUE, what would the implications be?&quot;

In this state of attention and inquiry, very often, it is possible that we might have flashes of insight into the true nature of what is taking place around us. God blesses this big time.

3rd level of attention: Over the course of time,through instruction,study,insight and personal experience, we have come to believe the truths of the faith and to want for ourselves what it offers us. We attend services,paying attention to what is taking place there. We make the prayers our own,meaning what is said in them from the heart. We are participating fully in the services,singing our parts,making the responses,fully engaged in heart,mind,body,soul and all of our senses. God blesses us mightily in ways we can hardly imagine. A protective bubble of Grace surrounds us at all times ,keeping us from harm and providing all things needful for us.

4th level of attention: Essentially, the same as the last, except that we begin to experience and perceive directly the invisible realities that we are setting into motion with our prayers and the beings and forces with which we are actually in communicating with-the Saints,the angels, our departed loved ones,and the Lord Himself,etc. Unimaginable degrees of blessings going from grace to grace.

The 5th level of attention is kind of like the first but completely it&apos;s opposite: Our body is in the Church building but our soul has been translated into Paradise where ineffable mysteries are revealed to us. Where eye has not seen, and ear has not heard the good things that God has prepared for us. Incomparable blessings stretching forth from this world into the next.

Welcome to the Orthodox Church!

Next time&quot;The life of sacramental Initiation within the Church as a means of Purification/Illumination/Deification.&quot;

And, believe, it or not,we&apos;re just scratching the surface of what the Church has to offer to help us to accomplish our complete transformation and transfiguration.

We were created to be like God! It is simply amazing the power that the world has had to systematically lower our expectations! But no more. Not for us and all of those we care to reach out to. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Considering all you wrote, and I read, I felt compelled to go.

Thank you for saying a few words of the five levels of attention, reminding me of&quot;let us be attentive&quot;impinging clearly on my ear every time, and as I said, I liked the uplifting and repeated message of&quot;HE HAS RISEN&quot;as opposed to the mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.

Actually, I was not thinking of what I will do later, or food of little importance to me, having gone days without any nor feeling hungry, but found myself more in the second level of attention, and truly, I did have one of these flashes of insight you note, of the true nature of what was taking place in the Church filled with Light in that fleeting moment, a stayed inspiration and great encouagement to continue.

Being surrounded by Home Boy country, Alhambra itself seemed much nicer than I thought, at least at first glance.

Saint Paisius Monestary looks like a beautiful place in the high desert, a ranch with animals, trees and native cactus, equally cultivated and maintained as St. Steven&apos;s. I can imagine your daughter enjoying her stay there.

Thank you for inviting me!

Yes. Orthodoxy has an entirely different orientation than any of the other,So called,&quot;denominations&quot;that we have become familiar with here in the west.

Before continuing with this idea of&quot;Sacramental initiation&quot;I wanted to say something about the demographics of a typical Orthodox Parrish community. However,I just happened to peek at another thread here,your conversation with Don entitled,&quot;Rewriting Genesis&quot;where he was talking about returning to Eden and mentioned&quot;The flaming sword&quot;set up to guard the way back in.

This is exactly what the Icon I sent you for Pascha is meant to depict. Here is another: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Har_hell_Hermitage2.jpg 

According to Orthodox Theology,the very first thing Jesus did when He was crucified was to reopen the gates of Paradise,go down into Hades and free all the righteous souls who had been stuck in there up until that moment and bring them up into Paradise. As well as the&quot;Good thief&quot;crucified with Him,to whom He said,&quot;This very day you will be with me in Paradise.&quot;And now we,as well may pass directly from death into life.

Got to go for now.People waiting for me out here in the real world...

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Apr 30, 2009, 12:43am

The demographics of a typical Orthodox Parrish is like a series of concentric circles. The outer circle consists of mainly ethnic,cradle born Orthodox Christians from other countries who only come out of the woodwork for major feast days a few times a year. The rest of the time they are busy being caught up in either chasing or enjoying&quot;The American Dream.&quot;

The next circle consists of both,ethnic Orthodox and American converts who come to Church more regularily,but are also,more or less caught up in the American dream.

The next circle are the people whose lives are centered around the Church,who always come to services,who do everything there is to do for the Church and,in general, are striving to live genuine spiritual lives.

There is one more circle which kind of interconnects with the last circle of people who are actively striving to make real advancement in their spiritual lives. These people can usually be recognized by the fact that they go,as often as possible,to visit various Monasteries.

The parrishes form an essential part of our spiritual life,however,No matter how good any particular parrish may be,it is at the monasteries that we find real spiritual guidance.

Keep in mind that all of this,although providing many benefits for us in the here and now,is really in the buisness of preparing us for ANOTHER KIND OF REALITY that we will all find ourselves in,sooner or later... Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Apr 30, 2009, 8:36am

Thank you for the second Icon, I see an angel holding a cross reminiscent of the cross at Fr. Seraphim&apos;s grave, the other angel a flame and a heart, it appears.

I remember the line,&quot;This very day you will be with me in Paradise&quot;, and thought why would Jesus take a thief to Paradise with him, but as usual didn&apos;t bother to ask since answers were never forthcoming.

The four circles of the demographics of an Orthodox Parish are similar to other&quot;denominations&quot;, I thought they were more&quot;orthodox&quot;, i.e., more strict as I thought of orthodoxy.

In part, you anticipated me with your description of chasing or living the American Dream, in that I was surprised seeing mostly late model expensive and luxery cars, leaving me feeling like a poor church mouse with my Honda, but only for a second.

I forgot to mention that I also liked the bells ringing during the Liturgy. I haven&apos;t been able to closer observe the many and various paintings, Saints, names, and symbols, but saw two dear to my heart, so I&apos;ll go earlier this Sunday, but having been alone for so many years, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m ready to mingle with the Faithful yet, if ever, but leave it open.

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Apr 30, 2009, 10:33am

I would say,that,in general,a greater percentage of Orthodox Christians understand and practice their faith,however,many of the ethnic Orthodox who have come here from other countries,(most of them,until only recently that were communist...) were unprepared for how subtly&quot;The American Dream&quot;can leech away one&apos;s faith. They thought they could have both(as do many
Americans,for that matter...) and,perhaps it is possible,but I doubt it,the two are pretty much mutually exclusive as far as I can tell.

But Orthodoxy is such that,anyone who pays closer attention to it,tends toward the light.

On the other hand though,Orthodoxy is not&quot;strict&quot;in the sense that,if you don&apos;t follow a bunch of rules you get kicked out or ostracized. It&apos;s more like,the Church sets before us everything it has to offer for our complete conversion and entire salvation and says,&quot;Come and partake of as much of it as you want&quot;

If you partake of a little,it will work a little bit. If you partake of a lot,it will work a lot. But,for the most part,it&apos;s pretty much up to us. So,with that in mind,it&apos;s to it&apos;s credit how many people who are involved choose to enter more deeply into it.

One more quick note: The Icons are&quot;Windows into Paradise&quot;that we use to help us communicate with the beings they represent. For the Orthodox,the veil between this world and the next is very thin... Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on May 1, 2009, 12:32am

There were actually two thieves,one on either side.One said,&quot;If you&apos;re the Son of God,why don&apos;t you save yourself and us also?&quot;The other rebuked the first thief saying,&quot;we deserve our punishment for the crimes we have committed,but this man has done nothing!&quot;Then turning to Jesus he asks,&quot;Lord,remember me when you come into your Kingdom.&quot;(Which is something I also pray often.)

There is a slanted bar on the bottom of Orthodox crosses which represent these two thieves.

Post by charlotte on May 1, 2009, 8:40am

Yes, I understand the ethnic Orthodox having lived under the yoke of communism and the pusuit of the American Dream has distracted them from their faith. Unless one is driven by the desire to earn millions and have a house on the hill, one does not have to loose one&apos;s Soul to achieve the dream to a certain degree. I&apos;m happy to say that all my life money itself was not important to me other than its use. I do well, but my real life is governed by currency from Above, so one can have both when balanced.

Tending toward the Light,&quot;The Journey to the Light&quot;, seems to be Don&apos;s entire agenda as well, as of late. My first impression was just that, to partake of what the Church offers, and depending how much or how little, it will work proportional.

Your explanation of certain things, the Icons, and the slanted cross, is very helpful, and for the learned and devoted Orthodox the veil between this and the next world being very thin, intelligible.

I can say that I remember all quotations, thus far, from the Bible you cite, as here concerning the two thives, though one was called a murderer?

Ah Don, thanks for the Cross. What was it you used to say,&quot;ask and ye shall receive&quot;. Is receiving without asking a God sent, then, or a compelled Don Barone sent?

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by admin on May 1, 2009, 9:03am

Hi guys ...

We are all on the journey toward the light. The problem with organized religions is that they claim someone has to help you get there. No such help is required. We are all on the &apos;same ship together, moving on&quot;as Chris de Burgh would say. However if this would become common knowledge why then would we need a church, money or any material thing. What would prevent a return to Medieval times where I think it was known that none of it was real and none of it mattered. People were free (in spirit and hope and love) and that is not allowed.

I have never needed a belief in anything to keep me on the straight and narrow and even were I to find out it was all a dream and an illusion I doubt whether I would become a complete hedonist [partial perhaps ]

So who are the good guys and who are the bad guys in all this and who is&quot;The Devil&quot;and who is allegedly&quot;God&quot;Be very careful which side you choose for it may be the last choice you will ever make. Choose correctly and perhaps you get off this merry go round of insanity called life. Choose wrong and it begins all over again. Hell on Earth ... until you finally understand and make the correct choice and are allowed to move on into and become part of the light.

You need no one or nothing ... other than ... self to get you there. But again if that was known what of the power brokers and the war mongers and the fear peddlers ...

 Look again at Hieronymus Bosch&apos;s images again and imagine that all his nightmarish images are simply our own manufactured fears and then remember the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. And if there is evil it feeds on our fears and that is and will be the secret to survival in my opinion, a conquering of our own fears.

Cheers
Don Barone Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on May 1, 2009, 12:26pm

Dear Don,
Thanks for finding the cross! Nice to hear you chiming in here! I&apos;ve always been a fan of Hieronymus Bosch and,as you recall,I began this thread with,&quot;Our inner state becomes our outer environment,&quot;no matter which world we find ourselves in...

You have written:&quot;You need no one or nothing...other than...self to get you there.&quot;

I agree that,ultimately,that that is the case. However,the greek word for&quot;church&quot;is&quot;ecclesia&quot;which means,&quot;Those who are called together.&quot;

Our true enlightenment and spiritual transformation is ultimately our own responsibility and yet,we don&apos;t live in a vacuum,we all have an influence upon each other. We rise and fall together. Even hermits have an influence on the whole interconnected web of being. We can assist each other by striving together.As far as the Orthodox are concerned, even those no longer present in this world can assist us if we so desire.

All this is not to say that&quot;organized religion&quot;has not been misinterpreted and purposely misused, because,obviously,it has. And yet,I believe,(And it has been my experience...)That there is still a baby in that bathwater!

You mention&quot;Medieval times&quot;but those were people trying to get away from the Roman church.(And even the alchemists tended to band together into&quot;Invisible Colleges...)

Orthodoxy and every other genuine spiritual community of people,goes back before the abuses of the church in Rome.

To each his own though,as far as I&apos;m concerned!

Best wishes and,as I say,nice to here from you.

P.S. Have you seen&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;recently? Great flick!

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on May 1, 2009, 3:14pm

One of the things I have stressed in this conversation,is my belief that it can be very helpful to have a specific spiritual PRACTICE when it comes to accomplishing the aims of our spiritual life. And this implies something,&quot;organized,&quot;something that has been handed down and agreed upon as being effective in accomplishing our desired ends.

There&apos;s nothing wrong with relying on the guidance of others who have demonstrated the fact that they have achieved what we ourselves hope to achieve as well. There is no need,necessarily,for each individual to re-invent the wheel,(unless we really want to...) We are all standing on each others shoulders. It&apos;s just a matter of who&apos;s shoulders we choose to stand on.

Christianity has,deservedly,a really bad reputation,however,there is always a grain of truth and a remnant of the genuine article for those who care to find it. It would be a shame to discount it out of hand as a possibility,just because we have had some bad experiences with some bad examples of it.

Orthodoxy is primarily an otherworldly mystical reality that overshadows our terrestrial globe. For the Orthodox,in general, it is a given that the material world which presents itself to us and that we are most familiar with, is a thin veneer which emerges out of and is permeated by a deeper reality which determines our fate. That only in relationship to this deeper reality can we really begin to live life and that it is all really only a matter of PERCEPTION that keeps us from being aware of this deeper reality at all times. Our culture has neglected to teach us HOW to perceive the fullness of being,(for some odd reason?) And it is the Churches job to pick up the slack where western civilization has dropped the ball.

For me,it always comes back to&quot;The secret of the universe&quot;and how can we free ourselves from the undesirable elements of our own inner state? How can we best manage to graduate from&quot;The school of hard knocks&quot;into an unending life of goodness,truth,beauty,love,peace,joy,delight,etc.etc. which I firmly believe is what we are INTENDED for.

And if being,&quot;Called together&quot;with other like-minded individuals to accomplish these ends is part of our personal journey,than,so be it!

(And if not,not.)

Well,I think I&apos;ve used just about as many cliches as I can possibly have fit into a couple of paragraphs for one day. What do you think?

P.S. The murderer you mentioned,Charlotte, was probably Barabbas, whom the Jewish elders preferred to have released from custody by Pontius Pilate in place of Jesus, just before he was condemned to be crucified. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on May 2, 2009, 9:24am

As far as I can see, Don, we are journeying together right here and now, and agree with renwdimgink, in my words:

You say that no help is required. I wouldn&apos;t have gotten anywhere, wouldn&apos;t be sitting here without the help of the&quot;right&quot;Teachers, again my Philosophy Teacher:&quot;No one has ever guessed their way to Enlightenment or Truths&quot;, as evident on various boards, people endlessly guessing.

Even when disenchanted with the material world, or because of it, we keep searching whether we know or not what for. I left the to me dead in Spirit Catholic Church at 18, I think, it was&quot;allowed&quot;to leave, that doesn&apos;t mean I stopped looking up, mostly wandering trough forests and meadows, a good Church.

If we&apos;re all&quot;in the same ship moving on&quot;, the bad and good guys are us, remembering the General sending out soldiers to find the enemy, they coming back and reporting&quot;we have found the enemy and they are us.&quot;This in the greater.

&quot;Be careful which side you choose for it will be the last choice you will ever make.&quot;I understand what you mean, but why must we choose&quot;sides&quot;, another hindrance?&quot;Come and partake of as much as you want&quot;, and if so inclined, go deeper into the mystery of whence, why, and where we are going.&quot;What of the power brokers and war mongers and fear peddlers&quot;? Let them broker and monger and peddle, their empire turning to sand every so often, not deminishing one iota the Empire of our Mind, Love and our Soul, untouchable.

I am aware of what my replies on this thread may&quot;sound&quot;like, but I am also cognisant of the greater history of the Orthodox Church from my studies in Philosophy, and later the medievil ages, the Renaissance, and of course, the Life and times of Sir Francis Bacon, a man guided by Divine Providence, a claim the Founding Fathers of America made as well. The language of the entire Masonic and Rosicrucian movement in Germany, France, Italy, Bohemia, Austria and England permiated with petitions for God&apos;s blessings. All has degenrated.

From that history I know, and agree with renwdimgink that the Catholic Church broke away from the original Orthodox Chuch, as discerned by the Neoplatonist Pletho, and again it was Plato, whom I quoted in my first reply, showing the way. Every endeaver, the great Sage advises, one should begin with a prayer to&quot;God, the creator of every kind of intelligible and seperate substance and hence of our entire Universe&quot;, and Ficino the great son of Plato, saw&quot;perfect compatibilty of Philosophy and Religion, harmony between Platonic Philosophy and Christian Revelation.&quot;

And what of so many great minds, the Kings of Jerusalem and Saints before them, about the 11th century? Deeply religious men and women and miracle workers.&quot;Oh man look at man&quot;, declared Hildegard von Bingen, agreeable to&quot;we are INTENDED to be God like&quot;. We talked about Arthur&quot;the one and future King&quot;, immortal in that he also represents Jesus. And there are little miracles in our daily lives, when as if by chance we are given what we need at the exact moment, the woundres feeling coming with it unmistakeable.

There is an endless list of, and quotations from God realized Persons and Saints depicted pointing to words or symbols in books, and countless Icons to be contemplated. It is an immense ocean of knowledge, and as of late I hear many more people expressing the wish to partake of something greater than they are, so we&apos;re rowing gently down the stream.

For all these and other reasons, I like the Orthodox Church, and can see a necessary specific practice handed down to lead to the discovery of&quot;The Secrets of the Universe&quot;.

Having never choosen any side, I can easily see in my life how I was led over the years from one Teacher to the the next until I found Mr. Hall about whom gathered the best of Teachers, in sympathy with my heart, ringing all the right bells, which Fern told me is a Soul response of remembering, and through her I met Francis Shakespeare of Universal Mind, who I feel knew and can teach me all secrets in harmony with the Orthodox Church.

A great weekend to everyone!

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on May 2, 2009, 3:19pm

Bravo Charlotte! Although,I Think I understand where Don is coming from. People have been burned by&quot;organized religion&quot;not doing it&apos;s proper job and,in fact,doing just the opposite! This is why I,myself,was so surprised to discover Orthodoxy. I came from a very eclectic,new agey kind of background,(as is evident from many of my posts...) So imagine my surprise when I discovered that what I felt most drawn to when it came down to it,was the original version of Christianity,that a genuine Christianity still existed in this day and age!

I wanted to say a little bit about the services themselves. The services are one of the most incredible elements of Orthodoxy and an incredible opportunity to expose ourselves to the most beneficial of invisible forces.

The Divine services are a spiritual forcing house,(Which is a very British way of saying, a&quot;greenhouse&quot;but&quot;Forcing house&quot;describes more accurately what takes place in a greenhouse.) In the midst of them we expose ourselves to the palpable influences of the invisible realities thus invoked. The language of the services,(not the languages which the services are spoken in,which are every language of any nation,but the POETIC language...) act in the same manner as the Icons,the architecture,the vestures,the incense,etc.,they are all windows into the Kingdom of heaven through which unparalleled Grace pours through.

The Divine liturgy which is offered on Sundays and on other Feast days,was written by St.John Chrysostom in the early 300&apos;s. You can walk into any Orthodox Church around the world and participate in this same service in whatever the local language may be for the past 1700 years! (There is something to be said for such consistency.)

The service that St.John wrote was adapted from an earlier version written by St.James the brother of the Lord,(His step-brother actually,and the First Bishop of Jerusalem whose martyrdom is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament and also,the author of the Epistle of James also found in the new testament.)

All of the other services of the Church are of equal antiquity,some stretching back to the Jewish temple services,such as the psalms that are chanted and sung.

There are five cycles of services which superimpose themselves over each other in an ever-shifting pattern which are always the same and yet,always different according to the hour of the day,the day of the week,the week of the year and the season of the year.

Accordingly,parts of the services are always the same and other parts always change to reflect the different times and seasons and events we are celebrating.

There is actually a service for every three hours through-out the day,(Of course MOST of them are only said in the Monasteries and even there,they tend to combine several of them at a time in a row.) Each day of the week has it&apos;s own special dedication. The services of each week are sung in a cycle of eight different tones,each tone bringing out a different aspect of the service being sung. Every day of the year is dedicated to many different Saints of the Church who have lived throughout the past Two thousand years( and more...) There are twelve major feasts throughout the year dedicated to The Lord and The Mother of God. There are four major fasts in the year. Some of these Feasts and Fasts are on fixed dates and some are movable,(In relationship to Pascha,whose date changes every year.)

There is one particular service on Saturday evening,(or the night before any Divine Liturgy,) which is a vigil intended to prepare us for the next mornings service. These services are some of the most beautiful and involved where we learn the most about what we are about to celebrate.

All of this is just scratching the surface of what the services are like. I hope it serves as some kind of introduction.

As always,the best way is to come,taste and see for yourself! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on May 3, 2009, 12:23am

Here is part of the service we sang this evening in preparation for tomorrow: http://www.anastasis.org.uk/myrrh-mat.htm 

To me,the poetic language is both exquisite and deeply Theological.

ENJOY! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on May 3, 2009, 9:57am

Good thing I was not burned by organized Religions for I never turned back or looked for another after I left the Catholic.

I was a bit defensive Don, sorry, where are you? I just read you were banned at GH, an informative board, did you go overboard as some posters do, it must be said.

This, as well as previous introductions, renwdimgink, are always helpful, and I can relate to the&quot;forcing house&quot;, the language spoken differing with nations, the dearest to my Heart poetic language being the same, and can indeed appreciate cycles superimposing themselves in ever shifting patterns but always the same.

I read the text of the Saturday evening service, unusual again, but gleaned some familiar ideas and thoughts I had made my own through the message, yea, and also the greater Teaching underneath the text.

Some years back I was sent an Easter postcard from Egypt, depicting the rolled away stone of Jesus&apos; tomb round and the entrace square.

Thanks for bringing the name of the murderer Barabbas to my memory; and also Forbidden Planet, which I purchased at least a month ago and watched several times, but forgot to mention, it being super-seeded by later points of interest.

We have cloudy skies this morning, but all in all the day is getting better after being woken by a nightmare of me standing by a door with two envelopes of import, I was told, and ringing the bell repeatedly but no one answered, leaving me feeling totally dejected.

It is no secret that for me, always, Grace flows through poetic language,&quot;exquisite and deeply Theological&quot;, hence my preeminent love for Francis and next other Great Poets, and the excellent language spoken in Elizabeth&apos;s time, and by the Queen herself, and now I can&apos;t help myself, having neglected Poetry for too long, though always with me and pertinent to the problem under consideration, and to my friend Don Barone.

Immortal Hamlet speaks&quot;by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-present love, and by what more dear a better proposer can change you withal....&quot;None.

To Guildenstern, who was sent for, and the mysteriously significant first two sentences:

&quot;I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late - but wherefore I know not - lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontary; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o&apos;erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire - why, it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
What a piece of work is man! how noble in reason! How infinate in faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to mewhat is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me - nor women neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.&quot;

Betaking myself to the Green House.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChTBKjtfd2w 

This again is one of the reasons I love Orthodoxy, the language of the worship services rival Shakespeare.

Now, one of the things you may have noticed is the one place that the Orthodox are rather strict and that is concerning the administration of the Sacraments. It&apos;s definitely not like in the roman church where anyone can walk in and receive Holy Communion-&quot;Body of Christ,Body of Christ,Body of Christ&quot;like an assembly line.

In the Orthodox Church,only those who have been Baptized and or Chrismated into the Church and have prepared themselves properly through prayer,fasting,confession and absolution,receive.

Why? Because Holy Communion is a Sacrament and as such is an element of an entire life of Sacramental Initiation.

The sacraments are the penultimate spiritual food and medicine whose aim is our Purification,Illumination and Deification. And an Initiation is the BEGINNING of something that,with our cooperation reaches the ends they are INTENDED for.

I remember&quot;Hair&quot;, and time has flown.

I read most of the text, at time subtle in language, again. It was part of the Liturgy yesterday. I noticed a crucified Jesus on the cross carried through the church, but the risen Christ is definately emphasised, and also&quot;forever and ever onto ages and ages&quot;, open, not Amen.

I thought not all people partake of the Holy Communion for the reasons you mention, though&quot;Christmated into the Church&quot;is new to me, as well as the spiritual food given by spoon.

I must admit to looking around some again, the Church itself feels a goodly place to be in.

Right off the Freeway there is at least a square mile China Town, which one would never suspect in Alhambra. Half way there I considered turning back, feeling a run down my stocking, pardon me, but how utterly tacky is that, walking into a Church with to my horror an inch wide run. Fortunately it was on the inside and I hoped no one will notice, then thought I really don&apos;t care and kept driving.

It&apos;s a beginning, I do what the other Parishioners do, save going
up to Communion or kissing the Cross, knowing instinctively I&apos;m not entitled, and if I&apos;m uncertain I do nothing. I can scarcely believe that I&apos;m actually going to Church.

Many people mistake the RECEPTION of the Sacrament for the end product,rather than recognizing it as just the beginning of a process of cooperation between the Grace of God and our own free will,which may only reach it&apos;s complete fulfillment in the next world.

There are seven Sacraments in the Orthodox Church,some of which are bound up with one of the five cycles of liturgical life,&quot;The Great cycle of life,&quot;which is comprised of events that,(Ideally or inevitably,) only take place ONCE in our lives, such as Baptism,Chrismation, Marriage and Holy orders.

The other three,Confession/Absolution,Holy Communion and Holy Unction, may take place many times throughout our lives.

To receive the Sacraments with a proper disposition and then to continue to cooperate with them produces the most expedient means of Purification/Illumination/Deification, which is their entire reason for being.

The Sacraments,it is said,have their roots in another world,the plant grows here in this world and their fruit is gathered in the Kingdom of Heaven. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Good for you! It truly is amazing how many unusual things can come up to try to keep us from doing anything that might be beneficial for us,(but certainly,a run in my stocking isn&apos;t one that I PERSONALLY have ever experienced!)

Orthodox worship engages the whole being,heart,mind body and soul,thus,we do A LOT of crossing ourselves,(essentially,everytime the Holy trinity is mentioned or anything is said three times,in honor of the trinity in unity.) We do a LOT of kissing of the Icons,the Cross the Clergyman&apos;s hand and anything or everything else in the Church which is part of our Salvation,(Including each other...) We bow to the Image of God in each other and to catch Blessings sent our way. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on May 4, 2009, 7:27pm

One of the most basic principles in the Orthodox way of life is,&quot;To hold in honor the things of God.&quot;

This means,first and foremost,all of our fellow human beings,each created in the Image of God,each with the exact same potential to regain their lost&quot;Likeness&quot;to god. Next,all of God&apos;s creation,our environment,which we have been entrusted to be good stewards of. To have been given&quot;Dominion&quot;over all of creation means to have the responsibility to,&quot;Tend and keep it,&quot;to help maintain it&apos;s wholeness,balance and essential integrity,NOT to&quot;Dominate&quot;it,as some have mistakenly interpreted it.

And,lastly,the Church and everything connected with it as,&quot;The Ark of Salvation,&quot;wherein everything needful for our complete redemption has been carefully preserved and handed down.

The Sacrament of Chrismation takes place after Baptism,(usually directly afterwords,) as the newly Illumined is anointed with oil that has been especially Blessed for this purpose,as a seal of the gifts of the Holy Spirit conferred at Baptism.

The oil that is used in these services is given to the priest (or Bishop,as the case may be,) by the Bishop who ordained Him. A portion of that oil came from the Bishops who ordained that Bishop.A portion of THAT oil came from the Bishops who ordained THOSE Bishops.And so on and so forth,stretching all the way back to the Apostles and the FIRST Bishops that they originally ordained. As such it is a physical symbol of a direct Apostolic succession up to today.

Now,of course,the roman church also claims to have a direct Apostolic succession as well from the Apostle Peter. The only problem with that, is that they stopped BELIEVING and PRACTICING what Peter taught around 800ad! So their Apostolic succession does them little good.

By their fruits ye shall know them.

Baptism and Chrismation are the doorways into all of the other Sacraments of the Church. They all take place on a personal basis,as part of a personal relationship with one&apos;s Priest or Bishop.

Traditionally,the catecumen prepares for a shorter or longer time until they feel that they are truly ready to enter into the fullness of the Orthodox Christian tradition. Holy communion is at the center of every Orthodox Sacrament and is received immediately for the first time after Chrismation.

My wife and I were both Baptized in the mad river,(No kidding...) here in northern ca. around 1985. This was before we were married,(or even had considered the possibility...) It was August when I was Baptized and it was freezing cold! My wife was Baptized several months earlier and it was so cold,she literally thought she was going to die when they dunked her.

I had been on the spiritual path for many years up until then and really didn&apos;t expect much from this ritual,however,much to my surprise,I felt doors opening up inside of me that I never knew were there.

I am ever at your service with any other questions you may have about any of this. Hopefully,one of these days you may meet Bishop Maxim. I think you will really like him a lot. He is a wise and loving Pastor of His flock.

P.S. Everyone is welcome to come up after communion to kiss the cross and receive a piece of Blessed bread. The Priest will probably say,&quot;You&apos;re new here aren&apos;t you? How did you find out about us?&quot;And you can say,&quot;Some crazy guy I&apos;ve been having a conversation with on the internet recommended I come check it out...&quot; Re: The Secret of the Universe

Thank you for all the information, realizing how a Novice I am, but it&apos;s been only my second visit, and on my way (with the run) I thought exactly that, i.e., things coming up to stop us from doing something good for ourselves.

Portion of the anointing oil for Chrismation, a new word for me, streching back all the way to the Apostles and the First Bishop (of Jerusalem?) is astonishing and wonderful. Jerusalem is mentioned during the Liturgy.

Both times I did go up to be given a piece of the blessed bread, last time three actually, maybe Father Checo with the kindly/happy smile thought I needed an extra portion seing I am a newcomer. I am sure an opportunity to talk with him will present itself, and if he should ask how I came to be there I shall tell him just that, being true. I am also sure I will meet Bishop Maxim at an appropriate time and looking forward to that occasion.

I have to read again and think on all you said after work, today is my sisters Birthday and I have to look for a Greeting Card now.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe

Here is a good article about&quot;Making the sign of the cross&quot;(except for one typo-After the number 1. In the sentence beginning,&quot;We place our thumb and first two fingers together in a point,&quot;it should continue,&quot;and our last TWO fingers...&quot;)

 http://www.orthodox.net/articles/about-crossing-oneself.html 

Yes.There is a lot of&quot;Church etiquette&quot;to learn. None of it is simply arbitrary,however,but all has deep symbolic meaning and,for those who attend to it consciously,it becomes a conduit for powerful blessings to descend upon us AND flow through us.

There is a great book,entitled,&quot;The lives of the Holy Apostles&quot;

 http://www.holyapostlesconvent.org/HacWe....cde33426c92f ed 

which goes into great detail about the lives of each of the Apostles,where they went after Christs Resurrection and the Descent of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost,who they evangelized,communities they formed and how they ended their lives,(Almost all of them where eventually martyred. It wasn&apos;t an easy job being an Apostle...) Each one of them ordained many Priests and Bishops to serve the faithful before they left to preach somewhere else.Then those Bishops made more Priests and Bishops and it spread from there.

What we think of as&quot;The New Testament&quot;was just a bunch of letters and accounts of Jesus&apos; life which were passed around from community to community. It wasn&apos;t until 325ad ,after Christianity had been legalized in the Roman Empire,that they were gathered together into one volume.(And those,of course were rare and hand-copied.)

So,it&apos;s always something to here the Protestant Christians say,&quot;Well,we just believe whats in the bible.&quot;

What did Christians believe and do for the first three hundred years when there was no&quot;Bible&quot;as we know it? And,not only that,but these first Christians had something more than that,besides having,&quot;The Bible,&quot;they had HOW the Apostles,who wrote the Bible,taught to understand what they had written and how to make use of it in such a way that it would work to transform and transfigure the human person.

This is exactly what Orthodoxy has gone to great lengths to preserve and hand down unchanged-the Apostolic doctrine.

Not really to change the subject,but on a different tangent:My eldest son is fascinated by all the new technology and is always asking me what the Church&apos;s position will be on things like nano-tech,cloning,genetic engineering,ect. He understands my own personal opinion that most of these are only caricatures of our own natural abilities that we need to develop on our own or else,means of&quot;getting around&quot;the consequences of the fall,rather than dealing with the actual causes themselves. however,in the end,it usually comes down to a realization that,technology itself, is more or less neutral, and that it is human nature that is the real problem that needs to be addressed. Human nature,which somehow,always takes the greatest&quot;Boon to mankind&quot;and turns it into a weapon!

We are on this&quot;Journey to the light&quot;together and,at some point,that journey takes us,face to face,with our own damaged human nature. This is where Orthodoxy comes in,(or whatever other traditional spiritual path that strikes one&apos;s fancy...) and provides a tried and tested means of actually DOING something about it!

So,may God Bless us to continue to become new creatures altogether! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on May 6, 2009, 9:42am

I have read several pages back so an overall picture of Church practice and meaning can take hold in mind, and I know what you mean by tending to it consciously. I did notice the thumb and two finger position, but not the remaining two fingers, now know the meaning, but not the reaching toward the ground?

Knowing practically nothing of the lifes of the Apostles, I ordered the book. Are the original letters of Jesus&apos; life at the Vatican? I can appreciate the first three hundred years of disseminating first hand understanding of the Teachings and giving them down the generations.

I would agree on the problem of technolgy as opposed to addressing human nature, we touched upon before, but have no doubt that in keeping on the path toward the Light we will become wholly enlightened to join those who lived and live blameless.

Blessings and a good day to you and the World.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe

Reaching down to the ground after making the sign of the cross is an expression of devotion,humility,respect for God&apos;s Divine Authority as well as of bringing God&apos;s will and blessings all the way down into earth.

I&apos;ve just finished re-reading&quot;The lives of the Holy Apostles&quot;with my ten yr old for his history class. The life of St.John the Theologian and evangelist is particularly incredible and was written by his fellow-worker in Christ,Procorus,so,it is extremely first-hand.

There are original manuscripts of the Gospels and Epistles in many places,(Mt.Athos for one.) The Vatican has many from it&apos;s earliest centuries when Rome was the center of Orthodoxy,(until they stepped away from it in the 800&apos;s) Then they accumulated many more Orthodox treasures when the crusaders sacked Constantinople during the 4th crusade.

In reading the lives of any of the Saints,we always look for the&quot;Prima vita&quot;,or first written account of their life, which is generally,the most accurate.

I sensed reaching to the ground may mean devotion, respect and humility, but thought it mat also mean God uniting Heaven and Earth.

I am looking forward to know something of the life of the Apostles, and thanks also for the information about the early manuscripts.

During work today I thought on the ending of your last post apropos doing something about our damaged human nature, and, speaking for myself, concluded that I have been doing that for some years, something like correcting my thoughts and actions I knew were wrong, nothing too detrimental.

Of course, our consideration here differs greatly from those relatively minor problems, still, I am doing something on this jouney to the Light. Meanwhile however, there is a life to be lived in the system of mundane world, either that or retiring to a Monastery living a Life wholly devoted to God, but as you remarked some time ago, one has to feel called to live such a life.

I know I am not thus called, but all the same aspire to reach the State of an enlightened creature and all the Wonders that come with it, to put it simply. Concerning the Jihad I came back to my original thinking, yes, we can progess but not force bad habits and the like out of our lives. I remembered speaking about this to a Lady who made a visit to a Monastery in Tibet. She was a smoker and trying to hide it she opened the window....a minute later there was a knock on her door and a Monk said:&quot;When smoke, smoke!&quot;So I am in agreement with the Monk, and also from experience, that minor and major things we don&apos;t like about ourselves have to be outlived and fall by the wayside naturally, lest they come back with a vengence.

Many a Catholic Priest, for instance, felt himself called and had the purest of intentions, but things are not that simple as brought out in&quot;The Thornbirds&quot;, and other powerful things to be considered in the greater scheme of things. I sound as if I&apos;m giving a lecture, pardon me, but all this moved through my mind today.

Thank you for the song, it too was playing in my mind when when you posted the first ones. I tried to find a fairly neutral one, alas, but living on Mediocria Firma, I like King Arthur and Merlin.

The great thing about the Orthodox way of life is that it provides a way to Enlightenment in whatever walk of life we find ourselves in,no matter if we chop wood or carry water.

I agree,we cannot force bad habits out. Orthodoxy works from the other direction.It gives us a taste of Paradise,which is incomparably sweeter than our bad habits,which,as you say,&quot;Fall by the wayside&quot;quite naturally in comparison.

And the poor catholic Priests! It&apos;s a shame they forced them to be celibate!To be called to a spiritual life and then have such limited opportunities to express it. One of the many disastrous changes the roman church made.

Wow! I might say. What pretty and sweet tunes. I know TISB, but am not as familiar as with the MB, JA and Starship, GD et all.

The caterpillar and scarabea, watched two of the former here and wrote about it somewhere, the second one changed from a caterpillar into a puppa within a few hours hours hanging securely attached under the window sill steeped in his mysterious transformation, an aura round him and so still that the air about him hear&apos;d. Watched the scarabea&apos;s on the Giza Plateau.

Many thoughts of the paradise island everywhere floating by listening and watching the ducks on the pond. You must have been a Hippy, pardon me. Schliemann didn&apos;t discover Troy, by the way, I watched the Documentary supposed to prove it.

And then my third love Jerry et all in concert, how he so purposely, gently and sweetly beckoned and called the people to his mind with his guitar, and we responded, and when he had everyone&apos;s undivided attention, he would shed light but not master, in his own words. In this he was unmatched, it was beautiful, for me sublime as to the heights he took me.

I wonder what Don edited?

We had an earthquake about a week ago of only about 4.5 magnitude of a relativel short duration, and the first thing I do, and most people do, we talk about it, is pray, and I suspect even the atheists do because there is no one else to turn too.

I didn&apos;t get to be a REAL hippy because I was only 14 in1970 when I became a hippy,(and that was in Long Island,not San Francisco where the REAL hippys were...) But I did my best to catch up! And I didn&apos;t become a Dead head until I did finally get to SF many years later. Like it says on the side of the Filmore west:&quot;They&apos;re not the best at what they do.They&apos;re the ONLY ones who do what they do!&quot;

Fortunately for me,I also found God at the same time,when I was 14,so that tempered my&quot;Hippy&quot;way of life to some extent.

Thanks for your time and effort, Don. I think every so often we can play from the store of the &apos;oldies but goodies&apos;, which the Gentleman and I are found of, apparently. A wise teacher once told me that things mundane should be accompanied by things Divine, for balance. In this case it is the other way round.

I am sorry for the garbled version of Terrapin Station, I think I overlapped, so here it is again, hopefully clearer, for the lyrics are quite philosophical, Jerry intimating his own passing, reminding me also of his words,&quot;I know a little something you will never know - I got no chance of loosing this time&quot;, which had two distinct meanings, for me anyway. He and the Dead were and are spiritual people for those who can hear them.

I read the vesper of the Paralythic, remembered parts of it also from my youth. Is vesper the proper word? I really like the language and little flashes it invokes during reading, best as well because I read it in the morning as Quelle, and will remember it tomorrow as I did the one last Sunday.

Hi Charlotte every once in a while you make a post that simply goes whizzing over my head. You know what I am like when the tide is out .... right now it is Bay of Fundy out but I am figthing it to keep it from coming back. Sales are horrible at work and it all started with the last revelations ... can&apos;t shake the feeling that nothing really matters ... hey didn&apos;t the Beatles pen that .... damn there I go again.

Anyway if you think it will do any good, try to explain this song to me and how it fits my present reality and I will continue to try to cope with what to me has become an awfully boring reality. I need a cause again. Like in the 60&apos;s with the Peace Movement ... Hopefully it will arrive on my front lawn soon (which by the way is already trying to reach the moon by growing like weeds) .... selling furniture, appliance and TV&apos;s just isn&apos;t cutting it any more.

Listen again to the song and look at the images, if you like, the words themselves will explain how it fits in your life, for&quot;Statements just seem vain at last&quot;. The one I previously posted had the same message, sometimes the lyrics are hard to hear clearly:

If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung,
Would you hear my voice come thru the music,
Would you hold it near as it were your own?

It&apos;s a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken....

You can find the Terrapin/Tortoise in the Mythologies of the world.

The best time is when the tide is way out and you&apos;re really bored: look at the vast open area or space you have to plant something new, and not worry about&quot;an exiting end to the story&quot;of&quot;a &apos;War&apos; movement&quot;. The&quot;Peace Movement&quot;of the 60&apos;s was instrumental in bringing us to this time, it&apos;s over, only, with the songs we reach back to incorporate insights gained and expressed then in the next step. Mowing your own lawn would probably put you in a good mood and sales will go up too. Anyway....

On my way I saw all the flower displays and remembered it was Mothers Day, so if there happen to be some Mothers reading here, I hope this day is a sunny and happy day. I happened on some Lilac, rare in California, too warm, but we had a tree in our yard, and it was my Mother&apos;s and mine favorite spring flower.

My day continued to be halting for awhile, the first freeway was closed, took the alternate and the off ramp to the one to Alhambra was closed, the detour was stop and go, so I turned on Firestone Blvd in the hope of finding back to the freeway, and just when I was about to gave up, I saw the huge sign&quot;Bycicle Casino&quot;which is on the freeway to Alhambra. The street sign on my right read Lotta, and I finally relaxed. Greater LA is not easy to navigate, if people don&apos;t give you a chance to change lanes and you miss an off ramp, if it&apos;s open, you have to keep going where it leads, forking into four other directions and then you don&apos;t know which one will lead you to where you want to go and you stop and have coffee, and annoy the person next to you by telling how you ended up there, and what town is this anyway. Sorry for the chatter, now I feel better.

I was not too late however, and to my surprise Bishop Maxim presided over the Euligy with a strong and pleasant voice. Father Ceko spoke on the paralytic Man and the 5 porches.

I have songs for each of my children and&quot;Uncle John&apos;s band&quot;is for my son John.&quot;He&apos;s come to take His children home...&quot;

You may have noticed that you have been going to a Serbian Orthodox Church and have wondered,&quot;Why am I going to a Serbian Orthodox Church? I&apos;m an American and,as far as I know,I&apos;m not Serbian?&quot;

Here in America,there are over three thousand denominations of Christianity,whereas,in countries such as Serbia,Romania, Bulgaria, Georgia,Greece,etc.,There is only ONE Church,the Orthodox Church. And in most cases,those countries were formed originally by Orthodox Christians bringing the faith to those lands. Therefore,the Church in those eastern European countries are heavily bound up with nationalism,(Which can be,is and will continue to be for them,a problem.) (I can&apos;t tell you how many Greek Orthodox Christians who have said to me,&quot;How can you be Orthodox? You&apos;re not Greek.&quot;Obviously,they were missing the point that Orthodoxy is something much bigger than any particular culture that it is found in!)

Here in America though,there is no&quot;American Orthodox Church,&quot;so,any one who wants to be Orthodox,ends up going into one of these ethnic jurisdictions who have brought their faith here with them.

After shopping around,we ended up with the Serbians because they were willing to accept us and they seemed to be very traditional as well. But in most of the older parishes, the ethnic parishioners still don&apos;t really get what we Americans want with Orthodoxy,since we&apos;re not Serbians?

It doesn&apos;t matter though. The Bishop knows what&apos;s happening with us and is very glad.

I thought I answer quickly, it is why I chose the song.

Ah ha! More obstacles and road blocks getting to Church! That&apos;s a good sign.

Perhaps this ethnic thing I just wrote about works in your favor,since you seem to be more of a private person? But I hope you do get to know someone there. I&apos;m Glad you got to see the Bishop and I hope you get a chance to speak with Him sometime. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Being European I actually like the more concrete Orthodox, also because of the Greeks, and am not bound to my nationalism. I may meet and speak to some people, but doubt if I could have lunch or become closer as so much extraneous is talked about and I get impatient. I am sort of private person and learn best alone, mostly.

I am sure I will speak with Bishop Maxim sometime.

In defiance, next time I&apos;ll take a different route, then maybe that one will be blocked. I already read today on the way that a major Boulevard will be closed next weekend for an Army Parade. Whatever!

There is an episode of Seinfeld where George, because of a girl he likes,decides to convert to be Lithuanian Orthodox. Of coarse,they really had no idea what they were talking about,however,there was one scene where George is talking to a Priest about converting and He pulls out this huge pile of books and tells him,&quot;First,you need to familiarize yourself with these texts...&quot;

I almost fell off my chair laughing. That was the only thing they got right. We Orthodox are big on books and the magic of the written word. And service books! there are dozens of them in as many different translations! (Which also puts the lie to the accusation that we are an&quot;organized&quot;religion!)

There is also a scene in a Marx Bros movie,&quot;A day at the races,&quot;where Chico is selling Groucho an ice cream vendors cart full of books,which I&apos;ve always wanted to re-do as an Orthodox skit.

This Tuesday evening/Wednesday morning is the feast of Mid-Pentecost which falls 25 days after Pascha and 25 days before the Feast of Pentecost,(Which is when the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles.) As such,it partakes of the Grace of both major Feasts.

It is one of my favorite celebrations of the Liturgical year.

Here are the texts for Vespers and Matins,which will be celebrated on Tuesday evening:

Here is a link to another Orthodox Church that may be near you. This one is the Russian Church in America,however it is mainly comprised of American converts. The Pastor,Fr.John Tomasi and his wife,Deborah have been friends of my wife and I for many years.

This would be a MUCH different experience of Orthodoxy for you! Their chapel is in the back of their bookstore,the&quot;Archangel Michael Orthodox bookstore.&quot;

Here is the link to their web site: http://www.joyofallwhosorrow.org/ 

Deborah asked me to give you her cell phone # in case you had any questions; 310-849-9451

The demographics of THIS parish are much different than most. Their outer two rings are proportionally much smaller than the inner two...

They are definately celebrating Mid-Pentecost there and have lots of other interesting things going on there.Not to mention the bookstore itself which would be appropriate after my last postings.

Not to mention,as an extra added bonus, that these people know me really well and who I ACTUALLY AM!!! And can tell you all about me...(What fun.)

Check it out! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on May 12, 2009, 9:10am

You seem to know everyone and all events and non-events, pardon me. Thank you for the phone number, maybe you are a high official in the Church, but then what would you be doing here on this board.

I know how to get to Culver City, yes, the Russian Church is much closer, and am thankful that they have a bookstore, which St. Steven&apos;s doesn&apos;t.

I can attend on Sunday&apos;s, so am really grateful for the vesper texts I can print and read on the appropriate days.

When we talked behind Don&apos;s back the other day and I said that after his first reply I had an idea of what he was thinking, but maybe now all is well, and since I assume many times people can read my mind as to what I meant, here is my reason for making the statement: in days of yore, when I was pelted by Ma&apos;atians, Done had, instead of the Butterfly, a Pumpkin Coach with me in it, before which he stood as Don Quixote with a sword defending me, signed&quot;Done&quot;.

Is this significant? I didn&apos;t know, but heard on the news yesterday that the Grateful Dead were in town on Saturday the 9th, the day I posted Terrapin Station, and we made fairly much ado about them for several days around this time. I was particularely reinspired by Jerry that day, listening for some time to their songs. I would say we had telepathic communication on a subjective level, unaware, and I find it most wonderful how vibrations fill the air and can be thus picked up.

People commented that their Concerts are as inspiring as ever, that it has become a multigenerational event, wonderful and spiritual, one lady remarked. How so? The wise Robert Hunter once wrote lyrics to which never music was composed, of Terrapin Station, above and below:

Endless recognition pour
like honey from a honey jar
Lights from near and distant stars
come streaming through the door

Tonight I do not know my face
from one who looks the same
by flicker of unburning flame
inside this old familiar place

Fortune sweet and bitter fate
converse beside the open fire
removed from weavings of desire,
twisted skeins of love and hate

And I know you
Yes I do
And I know you--
And you know me--
I could swear
you know me too

We have been together
since the first-born seed of light
reflected on the water
and divided day from night
Sometines we were strangers
Sometimes we were friends
Dreamed up lives of danger
Broke hearts and made amends

It&apos;s time to leave for Terrapin
Head down the stairs again
Step by step return below
Fill the blanks in as we go
Find out what we need to know;
from gossip if it must be so
Forsake this cool and kindly light
for troubled day and sleepless night

Or shall I go while you remain;
search below for you in vain
find you here from time to time,
elusive subject of a rhyme?
Or would you rather go alone
in unfamilier flesh and bone,
meet and put me to the test,
a scarlet flower at your breast?

I don&apos;t know how we chose before&apos;
for love or sorrow, peace or war
but where our paths unite the two
you always know me
yes you do - and I know that I know you.

Not meaning to get too far off topic, but my friend Don is much on my mind lately, and I would like to invite him, you Don, especially to accompany me to a Concert and a feel of the Dead Family.

&quot;Maybe you are a high official in the Church...&quot;I&apos;m high all right,but not official. Actually,you were closer the first time. I&apos;m just an old hippy who was too young to be a&quot;Real&quot;hippy,who found God, who then led me,step by step,into Orthodoxy.

In those early days though,it was Ken Kesey and the merry pranksters who were my role models,(With,of course,Jerry and the Grateful Dead as their house band...)

The reason I seem to know everyone is because,like the Dead Heads,the Orthodox Church is really a small world of kindred spirits who recognize each other instantly by a certain look in their eyes and then keep on running into each other over and over again at different concerts.

There are a lot of similarities between the Orthodox and the Dead Heads. We have all been called together for something more than just a Philosophical idea,but for a shared religious EXPERIENCE. (Which is why I can understand you wanting to bring Don to a concert because,unless you&apos;ve been there and experienced it yourself,you just don&apos;t KNOW.)

The major difference between the Dead Heads and Orthodoxy is,that,with the Grateful Dead,it is kind of,&quot;Hit or miss&quot;whether you would have that experience on any given night.Whereas,with Orthodoxy,there is a tried and true method with a 2000yr old track record of,not only transmitting that experience,but knowing what to do with it to make it into a permanent state,one which transforms and transfigures the human person and brings them safely into ANOTHER WORLD ALTOGETHER.A world that Dead Heads have an inkling of, but weren&apos;t entirely sure how to actually get there...

And this is why I have invited you and invite Don and just about everyone else I meet to&quot;Come! Taste and see that the Lord is good!&quot;

I hope you will give Deborah Tomasi a call. I think you will really like her. She&apos;s been around for a long time and is very knowledgeable and experienced. You can get another perspective on all this,(And a woman&apos;s perspective at that...)

BLESSINGS till later.

Post by charlotte on May 13, 2009, 9:06am

Indeed a hit and miss on account of going&quot;up&quot;in lightening speed, and which I realized after my last concert that it is now time to catch up and put things in perspective as the experience sinks back into the unconscious. Your words to make it a permanent state was my prayer many times: please God let me stay here.

Jerry knew how to take those so predisposed there, but, sang he in mystical terms&quot;no one may come here for no one may stay&quot;. It was beautiful! If you can believe it, it was Jerry who prompted me to actively seek&quot;the more to life than this&quot;, which I knew was, and hear other people say every so often.

The Lady we work for said to me yesterday,&quot;you are an interesting person.&quot;It&apos;s somewhat embarrassing when someone compliments you, I said, knowing she is fishing in my mind,&quot;uh why?&quot;She, being moderately difficult, said,&quot;I don&apos;t know of any other person who would spend hours talking about colors with me&quot;. It is, I thought, because I have to gradually persuade you to accept the color I see for this room, this house, and you and your husband. Said she,&quot;I told my friend earlier that with you I never get the color I want.&quot;The more too it she can&apos;t quite put her finger on. Such opinion of oneself, Jerry called&quot;selfcentered to the point of innocense&quot;. It&apos;s true.

Culver City would be close enough for me to Saturday also, but it&apos;s right through LAX, the problem being that at that time the freeways are a parking lot. I will go Sunday, meanwhile call Deborah sometime during the week, not the least to find out who I am speaking with.

Yes, I like Hunter&apos;s lyrics, read many a one, and also what he has to say, searching for simple words, seeing into his head.

I also have problems with the vertical line &apos;I&apos;, but it seems to have worked for you in the second post&quot;Let&apos;s try it again...&quot;If you would help me out I&apos;d be grateful.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on May 13, 2009, 2:08pm

Where were we? Oh yes! Prayer,Fasting and Almsgiving,Right?

In the Orthodox way of life there are two types of prayer which are meant to compliment and support each other: Corporate Prayer and Private Prayer.

Corporate Prayer is the prayers we say all together,as a body,the Liturgical prayers which comprise the Five cycles of Orthodox worship which we touched on briefly before. The study of how these five cycles work together,their understanding and,especially,the participation in,brings immeasurable blessings to the soul.

Private prayer consists,on the one hand, of our petitions for ourselves and for each other and for our dear departed. And on the other,our contemplative prayer,the prayer of the heart,which is the VERY HEART of an Orthodox spiritual life.

As I say,these two types of prayer,corporate and Private are absolutely necessary for each other and actually enable each other to work properly.

Have you ever read a little book entitled,&quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;by J.D.Salinger?

In it,Franny is busy having a nervous breakdown because,all her life,she has been force-fed on various Philosophical and Religious Ideals by her two older brothers. Subsequently, she has been led to believe that&quot;Knowledge is meant to lead to wisdom,&quot;whereas,unfortunately,in college,where she finds herself,this is not necessarily the case!

Any way,she is,at the same time,reading another little book entitled,&quot;The way of a pilgrim,&quot;which is about this russian pilgrim who is trying to learn what it means to,&quot;Pray without ceasing.&quot;The pilgrim meets someone who gives Him another book to read entitled,&quot;The Philokalia,&quot;which is about the Prayer of the Heart and a particular method of prayer called,&apos;The Jesus Prayer,&quot;which,when practiced,WITHIN THE FULL CONTEXT OF THE ORTHODOX WAY OF LIFE, leads to unceasing prayer and complete union with God.

I first read&quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;around 1974 when I first became a Christian and started trying to say the Jesus Prayer,however,it wasn&apos;t until about ten years later that I discovered Orthodoxy and the fact that,both,&quot;Way of a Pilgrim&quot;and &apos;The Philokalia&quot;were REAL books and not just something that Salinger had made up!

It can be said that,the entire Orthodox way of life,the Sacraments,the liturgical prayers,the Ethical life of an Orthodox Christian,the practice of Unseen Warfare,everything,is a means of making it possible for this&quot;Prayer of the Heart&quot;to effectively lead to union with God.

This is the whole enchilada! What it&apos;s all about. Once a person comes to recognize this,it all begins to hang together and make perfect sense.

God Bless you in your endeavors! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on May 14, 2009, 8:12am

You&apos;re not from around here was my point of telling the story, besides accomodating &apos;selfcentered to the point of innocence&apos;. Many times the reason for saying something in particular serves as a hint, but the finger can&apos;t be quite on it&quot;what that might be&quot;. Did I really have to say this.

I comprehend all you are saying in your second post and thank you.

No, I didn&apos;t read read&quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;, but of course immediately think Francis and Life, understand the purport of the story, and nice that you mention&quot;pray without ceasing&quot;as I thought about it 2 days ago when reading, and actually did so during work at times until interrupted.

A message from the Narbonne yesterday informed me that my parcel was in, the book I ordered. When I think of all the books you recommended thus far to read, and all those I yet need read, I might have to purchase a Hummer or two.

Fasting and Almsgiving yet to come... Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on May 15, 2009, 8:40am

I hope they at the Russian Church have a good Library cause I don&apos;t like renting books and being obligated to return them at a certain time, besides having references at hand.

Fasting is fairly easy for me, don&apos;t eat at all sometimes, &apos;man does not live by bread alone&apos;, of course it depends on the rules of fasting. Alms I give to the homeless in the streets and those who care for animals. It absolutely breaks my heart to see animals mistreated and the sadness in their eyes for want of love and care. I rescued a bee from a swimming pool yesterday (lol) after looking at it for a few seconds thinking, &apos;what if it stings me?&apos;

Perhaps you overlooked my having problems with the &apos;I&apos; which is a straight vertical letter without the two horizontal lines top and bottom in the youtube URL, which doesn&apos;t work for me but worked for you, hence my request following the&quot;Let&apos;s try it again...&quot;post.

Hi renwdimgink

An attempt to find the&quot;God of Geometry&quot; http://donbarone.selfip.net/I_am_God_Part_Ia.htm 

However there are other possibilities ...

Such as&quot;The Moon&quot;being an apple of sorts like that of William Tell and when mankind hit it with the arrow of Apollo 11 ... the time had come.

But then again that may only be in my reality.

But Thoth is the god of measure and all measures can be found within The Moon and it&apos;s distances ... and never forget Ceres ....

&quot;ren&quot;you wish to believe in and accept your god and that is fine but when did we become his creation. When did we receive the spark of godliness? Did Cro Magnon have it? Did Neanderthal have it? Who was it given to? Answer these questions first&quot;ren&quot;before &quot;you go off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.&quot; You have to answer who was&quot;The Adam&quot;... it can not be dodged. For the question always remains ... who taught the first teachers? You and all the others before you on both sides always fail in this quest.

Your beliefs answer nothing. At least for me.

And Charlotte I have to confess I don&apos;t think&quot;The Deadheads&quot;had it either.

I tend to think Buddha was closer than most.

I tend to think that a thought I had several years ago may be closer to the mark than I first realized. ... an eternity in an instant ... trapped in a loop ... the time paradox ... must stop&quot;the World&quot;to get off ... but how does one accomplish this?

And what is this thing we call&quot;Soul&quot;? From where did it come? and how can all souls be different ... yet one?

Are we then Borg? ... could be .... and what really is illusion and what is reality? Can we actually be simply a symbiosis? No? Why not? You believe in a god why not in a symbiosis? Yes&quot;Soul&quot;and&quot;Man&quot;locked into and trapped in a symbiosis ... really the only sensible answer.

Maybe within&quot;The Light&quot;is the true answer. It sure as hell isn&apos;t around here .... then maybe I should try to find someone NOT FROM AROUND HERE.

Just watched the movie&quot;Wanted&quot;... how strangely like&quot;The Last Bling King&quot;... couldn&apos;t help but feel he was talking directly to me at the end ...

Okay just emptying my brain out a bit ... Carry on.

Best wishes

Dear Don, You have written,&quot;Your beliefs answer nothing.At least for me.&quot;

What questions are you asking?

Are they questions that will try to satisfy your rational mind?

Perhaps there is a different question that needs to be asked,like,&quot;What did your Original face look like before your parents begat you?&quot;

The answer to the answer is something beyond the mind.

Matanoia is not an&quot;Answer&quot;for the mind.It is a CHANGE of mind altogether,back to it&apos;s original state of oneness with God and all of creation.

All Charlotte and I have been discussing is a WAY of accomplishing this.

Hallo Mr. Burger and Don,

Logging in yesterday morning and reading the first posts by you Gentlemen, the myriad of things crossing my mind would have made a lengthy reply at the expense of the necessary Saturday housewifish chores, no to mention the task of having to clean sap all over my car which I had parked under a Eucalyptus tree, all the while thinking about things secretive.

Mr. Burger, Friday last, I spoke briefly with Deborah who exclaimed:&quot;Yes, Charlotte, I have been expecting your call&quot;, meaning, of course, that you had mentioned me to the Lady, who, you indicated, can tell me who you actually are as an extra added bonus, and your REAL name by which I may call you, and which all sounded so cryptic to me that I thought you were a person of great Fame, (your Fortune not from around here, I can say by now) whom I would recognize at once, or someone who has read my stuff in the past and known I am interested in things esoteric, but yesterday you stated (and mentioned it before), that you are an anonymous nobody who just happened to discover this site and stated writing on it, no less with with a sole and strange sentence:&quot;Our inner state becomes our outer environment, both here in this world and, even more so in the life of the world to come&quot;, and continued for a little while in a more or less puzzling fashion, we here, having never discussed Religion in lenght, width, height and dept. Indeed, still anonymous, for I have never heard of Stephen Burger, hoping I spell your name correctly, but&quot;St. Stephen with a Rose&quot;you linked too is one of my favorites.

No, I didn&apos;t mean the M. Hart thing, rather, sometimes the URL shows a vertical line | out of which I make the letter I, which doesn&apos;t work for me but works for you.

I had a remarkable dream during Friday-Saturday night, in which I was with my sister, I think. We were looking at a mountain we had seen before, and which we were about to climb. To my surprise there was now a cable car to the summit. The stations or concrete pillars were set in uneven zigzag manner causing me to take a few steps sideways to see if they were all connected by the cable. They were, but it was not an average mountain of rock with trees and shrubs growing up its circumference, but more a very pleasing to the eye familiar landscape laying&quot;flat&quot;on the mountain which I wondered at anew. Reminds me of&quot;mystical&quot;Robert and Jerry&apos;s&quot;Mountain on the Moon&quot;, singing of Carrian Crows, Sybils, Merchants and Marsh Kings Daughter&apos;s etc., and I can even connect the Dead to the Elizabethan Era and Sir Philip Sidney via&quot;Althea&quot;. &apos;Tis nothing short of spectacular, and yes, I agree once more, that that Dead Heads had flashes of Divinity, that&quot;permanent&quot;is the operative word, nevertheless, Jerry and Robert et all were, by far, not from around here either.

The Rock and Roll era was as an Epic-center and the whole human race benefited by the outward propagating waves whether they want to know it or believe it, or not.

Jerry&apos;s brief&quot;talk&quot;with Hefner is so typical and telling, Hefner commenting Hefner-Mind style and asking HM questions, Jerry smiling&quot;right&apos; &apos;right&apos;, that&apos;s right, whatever you say, Bringing to memory an interview on CNN with Ted Koppel, where Ted talked and Jerry of few words listened, nodding and smiling&quot;I could even begin to tell you....&quot;

I read only the first link of the Golden chain in&quot;The Lives of the Holy Apostles&quot;, concerning Simon Peter, and yes, like much what I read. I also heard of an unbroken lineage up to today of James brother of Jesus. Have to concern myself with Religious matters after Church.

For Don&apos;s musing, another story of not being from around here. Last Friday, the same Lady told me that while we were working upstairs they are sleeping in a guest bedroom they call Charlotte&apos;s room because I relented not with a color she didn&apos;t like, but now loves. She said:&quot;You know, Charlotte&apos;s room as in&quot;Charlotte&apos;s Web&quot;, have you ever heard of Charlotte&apos;s Web&quot;? Yes, I heard about it, and walked up the stairs.

The constant churning of the rational mind, indeed. The Greeks put an end to it with the Philosophical Dialog, in which I would propose a thesis and Don an antithesis. We would set one aside and only peel away the layers of the one under consideration until there was nothing left to divide, and in that moment of silence the true nature of that thing could be comprehended, and vanish again. So it was done with the other half, and having comprehended it, a synthesis could be had, which was a new thesis.

I must say. You mentioning the word Metanoia brings a smile and Love for my Philosophy Teacher, for during his lectures at the appropriate time he would put his mouth close to the microphone, deepen his voice, look at us and say&quot;Metanoia&quot;.

Thanks for the&quot;Powers of Ten&quot;and the Crown of Creation, Grace was so beautiful and sang like an earthly angel, methought.

Speaking of thesis/antithesis-love that most trippy song by the Rolling Stones,who are the antithesis to the Beatles....However,that album, (and not JUST because of the name...) gives off a REALLY bad vibe. I used to make people listen to it and tell them,&quot;If you EVER start feeling this particular vibration anywhere else,you had better start crossing yourself and saying the Jesus prayer!&quot;especially,&quot;Why don&apos;t we sing this song all together.&quot;ooh. bad vibes.bad vibes. Because of Anita Eckberg they had gotten into this black magic thing which,I believe,ended up in Brian Jone&apos;s death.&quot;Sympathy for the Devil,&quot;an absolutely GREAT song really IS the Devil,quite simply telling it like it is:&quot;What&apos;s confusing you is just the nature of my game.&quot;Sympathy for the Devil even has a verse about the history of the Orthodox Church in Russia:&quot;Killed the Tsar and His ministers,Anastasia screamed in vain.&quot;That event marked the end of 800 years of what,up until that time,was known as,&quot;Holy Russia,&quot;an entirely Orthodox nation.)

Such a long digression on the Rolling Stones! But there you have it. I could go on and on about anything.

Remember I mentioned that I have songs for all my children,(Uncle John&apos;s band...) Well,mine is DEFINITELY St.Stephen!&quot;Wherever he goes,the people all complain!&quot;&quot;Stephen would answer,if he only knew how.&quot;and most definitely,&quot;All He lost He shall regain!&quot;

Although,from what I understand,the song was originally written for Stephen Gaskin, (A very interesting person in his own right...) My name is spelled Steven, last name, Berger.

I was originally named after Steve Allen,(ANOTHER interesting guy...) And then,later,Baptized and named after a Russian Bishop and missionary,St.Stephen of Perm,(But I still spell it with a V) (But NOT a V for Vendetta. Oh.I am just full of it this afternoon!)

Actually,though,I am just so happy that you made contact with the Tomasi&apos;s. My wife, Barbara Ann,(Bet you can&apos;t guess what HER song is...) have known the Thomasi&apos;s for like 25 yrs or more.

Fr.John is a great bear of a New Yorker and Matushka Deborah is a very sweet,intelligent and competent person.

I hope you&apos;ve had a good experience at Church and am looking forward to hearing about it.

Sorry to dash your hopes that I was somebody. The only reason I ended up on the web site was because I was looking for interesting pictures on the computer and just happened to type into the search bar,&quot;As above so below&quot;All the rest is just how I am...

A solid German name, Berger, He of the Hill.

It&apos;s about the only song by the Stones I like, never paid much attention to their lives, a bit too rough in demeaner for the likes of me. Apparently the vibration of the name and album cover never touched me, I thought they were sort of clowning about, and with the song told the nature and doings of the devil.

I met Steve Allen&apos;s son, a physician, once, at a 3 day Conference of Doctors and Psychologist concerning the healing power of laughter. I thought that most of them were crazy themselves, many incompetent to help a troubled person, a few total lunatics and I had to walk out to take a breath.

I didn&apos;t pay attention to the street number, daa, so it took me awhile to find Fra John&apos;s Church, stopped and asked two Lady&apos;s who sent me to a Jewish Temple. Drove back slowly with my emergency lights flashing lest people behind me fly into a rage, and spied and angel with a sword on Pegasus, no less. The place is indeed samll and very easy to miss with eyes on the traffic.

A man from Bulgaria greeted me with a heave and stayed by my side, so to speak, and at lunch time, when I made a move to indicate I&apos;m leaving, he would step the same way preventing me from, it was funny, and gestured with an inviting smile to join all in the lunch room, flirtatious he. Definately a more relaxed atmosphere.

I took some food and set down 3 chairs removed from anyone, a Gentleman set down to my left and one across from me. The man on the left asked questions and talked nonstop about how I got to be there, how he came to join this particular church, where he came from and hoped to go, how long he had been there etc, and many of the things you had told me, and all I could do was nod with my neck turned to one side. Seeing my exasperation, the man across from me interrupted him every so often by asking him a question. For a good time the Bulgarian stayed behind my Informer&quot;staring&quot;, not&quot;gazing&quot;at me, to get my attention, and I finally looked back and bowed to him with a smile, he bowed back and walked away. Thought I tell about it in regards to the afore mentioned dreaded Luch. Bless him, my Rescuer, and my Informer too, he told me about a Church almost right around the corner from where I live, so this will be my next stop. There, I could even go Saturdays. I did miss being inside the beautiful Church in Alhambra though.

I met Deborah briefly, shook hands to say hallo, but the Lady was bussy with a meeting held after the Euligy. I saw all the familiar Icons, and looked around at the book store, where my Informer joined me to tell me about good books of introduction to the Orthodox Church.

Meanwhile I am reading on the Lives of the Holy Apostles, which, as I said, I like very much. Found Hermes&apos; Above so Below.

The Lord said onto Peter:&quot;And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven&quot;.

As far as instructions go, if you pardon me, Mr. Berger, I have benefited most from yours, as they encompass the greater scheme of things which are in my scope.

We had a more powerful earthquake yesterday, 4.7, which I felt was coming after the last mentioned. During the awesome rip a perfume bottle fell of the shelf chiming like a bell for it did not break.

My Father&apos;s parents were from Budapest-Austro/Hungary,hence the German name,Berger.

Orthodox Christianity is a theraputic process of Purification/Illumination/Deification whose aim is to restore our original&quot;Likeness&quot;to God. This is a very important point! The aim of Christianity is not&quot;To make us better people.&quot;It is to make us like God. In the process of becoming like God,we do become better people,but that is NOT the aim of Christianity and it can NEVER accomplish this on that level.

This is one of the reasons that people have rejected Christianity.It doesn&apos;t seem to do what it is supposed to do,(make us better people...) We look at people who are supposed to be Christians and say,&quot;They&apos;re no better than anyone else,&quot;(often,worse...)

The problem is that these,&quot;So called&quot;Christians have forgotten what Christianity is really about.Not becoming better people,but becoming like God. It takes everything to another level.

As I say,Orthodoxy is a theraputic process which takes place automatically once we begin to embrace and practice an Orthodox way of life. As with anything,the more conscious we are of this process,the more we can co-operate with it and help it to go more smoothly and expediently.

It demands total self-examination,Total self-honesty and a total commitment to,&quot;Know thyself.&quot;

Orthodoxy is a path of Self-realization in the strictest sense of the word. My favorite image of this is an onion with a diamond at it&apos;s center. That is my Mantra,so to speak,&quot;Beneath the layers of the onion-a diamond!&quot;

Tell me about the Church around the corner from you after you&apos;ve had a chance to see it.We&apos;ll see if there&apos;s anyone I know there.

Best wishes to you on your continued journey of discovery. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on May 18, 2009, 1:14pm

The Glory of God is an all-consuming fire;The fire of love. An unconditional love which seeks to dissolve all of our falsehoods,all of our illusions and,in fact anything and everything that separates us from being entirely one with God.

Our soul is thirsting for this oneness with God like a dehydrated body thirsts for a drink of pure water. Our soul recognizes in Orthodoxy the means of arriving at what it desires above all else and so,people are drawn to it. However,those who are drawn have varying degrees of understanding of what the process is that they are going through and subsequently have varying degrees of ability to co-operate with this process.

Hopefully,they have a priest who,besides serving the Sacraments,which is their primary responsibility, understands and is qualified to be a therapist as well,(Qualified,not by the AMA,but by His own experience.) But not every priest is a qualified therapist which is why we pray that we may be blessed to find an Elder who can serve that function for us.

It is easy to find many dilettantes,(like myself...) but not as easy to find a GENUINE spiritual Father. (Although,they DO still exist.) It all depends upon our own sincerity,then God provides.

The Orthodox way of life is a means of exposing ourselves,gradually and consitantly, to the Glory of God,here and now,while we still have time and space as a buffer,before we are ushered into the fullness of God&apos;s presence at the end of the age,(or the end of our own life,whichever comes first.)(Oh yeah. This is the&quot;Countdown to Armageddon thread we have been writing on.I almost forgot!)

It is all about the practice of the presence of God and remembrance of God in the deepest sense of the word:To become a member of God once again.

Subsequently,we find all kinds of different people in varying stages of Purification/Illumination/Deification in any given Orthodox community and one of the first things we strive for is to have compassion for one another. To love and forgive each other our offenses.(Not to tolerate them,necessarily,but to understand where they are coming from and forgive. )

The very fact that there ARE so many DIFFERENT kinds of people,people who wouldn&apos;t necessarily even choose to be together,is proof,to me,of how genuine the Orthodox way of life is. It works for anyone,in every walk of life,if we give ourselves to it and embrace it wholeheartedly. The members of the Orthodox Church are NOT a bunch of similar looking smiling zombies,but rather,a bunch of unique individuals called together by God to work out their salvation together.

I&apos;ll find the Church around the corner today en route to read their schedule.

Having not yet embraced or come to practice the Orthodox way of life, but merely approching the ProNous, or Porch of the Orthodox Church, even so, the therapeutic process involved is evident in reading the Vespers and the book of the Lives of the Holy Saints, which I can somewhat relate too via the greater scheme of things I noted yesterday.

Your ending words of the second post are identical to last words my Informer said, viz, people called together by God to work out their salvation together. Being a Hermit other than my working life, it is&quot;Cummunity&quot;I have to allow myself to get used to. I have no problem joyning the Community in the Church before and during Euligy, it&apos;s the socializing after and lunch I resist. Anyway, I plan to go back to speak with Deborah and hopefully Fr John, yes, great bear of a New Yorker, ponytail and all, as has Bishop Maxim, but also feel compelled to&quot;abide&quot;at times in the beautiful Church in Alhambra, which has left a deep impression on my mind and soul, in particular one nameless Figure at the exit looking one directly in the eye and I just wanted to stay and look back, though had to look away at times and know why.

Thanks for yet another book, I will print sections, if printable, perhaps you could slow down a bit as I have others to read, lest I have to hold them between my knees and I&apos;m sure you wouldn&apos;t want me trip over some.

I saw and skipped that version of the Stones for obvious reasons, but love the melodious, space flight, and words such as turning in graceful motion as our Spiral Galaxy, landing on Aldebaran in a star fiery ocean and safely on the green desert sand and so on I could go forever too.

Beautiful song by the MB, made waterfalls of me too, and the Taj Mahal, entrance to Paradise, also belonging to the bigger picture, connecting to Agrabah and the Royal Wedding of Aladdin and Jasmine who fly on a magic carpet around the Sphinx to&quot;a New World&quot;.

Shah Jahan and Mumtaz were contemporaries of Francis, sorry, can&apos;t help it, He being ever my reference point to all that is. Jahan, He of the Peacock Throne, standing on top of the World, and Mumtaz,&quot;Beloved Ornament of the Palace&quot;and&quot;Cradle of Excellence&quot;, are but another rendition of the Great Ramses who built a House of Million Years, and Nefertari&quot;God&apos;s wife of Amun&quot;, and Nefertiti&quot;the Beautiful has come&quot;, or Hatshepsut the&quot;Foremost Lady of the Land&quot;of Punt, (Shakespeare also knew of Punt) when seen Above. Nefer translating to&quot;the Divine, the Beautiful, and the Good, so all these&quot;Favorite Wives&quot;betoken the Soul. I know I digress, but all these are peripheral sounds that come to my mind, besides others.

Post by renwdimgink on May 19, 2009, 1:03pm

Except for some of the earliest hermits in the Palestinian and Egyptian deserts,most Hermits were not blessed to live the solitary life until after living in community for a while and perfecting them selves in that,very often,more difficult arena. Our fellow human beings,although each one created in the Image of God,can be a real pain to have to deal with! Ay.but there&apos;s the rub! Having to deal with them is one of the best ways of perfecting oneself. (Hence,marriage.)

By all means,I hope you will continue to visit St.Stephen&apos;s as well. I&apos;m looking forward to you getting to meet Bishop Maxim. And,as you say,the Church near you may turn out to be a good place to attend some of the evening vigil&apos;s.

Best wishes till later.

It is true that dealing with fellow human beings is one of the best ways of perfecting oneself, even in every day working hours there is the opportunity and necessity of checking one&apos;s thoughts and actions. True also, the Church and it&apos;s community of believers being a crucible, now that brought it to my awareness.

As you know, I didn&apos;t liken myself to the blessed Hermits, nevertheless I have been walking about the World with a Lantern until more recent times.

The Church close to where I live is&quot;St. Matthew&apos;s&quot;, an Antiochian organization, so I&apos;ll vist there maybe even on Saturday, and there are two more in the area. As much as I drive about, I have never noticed an Orthodox Church, probably because they are mostly of the &apos;beaten track&apos;.

Here is St.Matthew&apos;s web site: http://www.saint-matthew.net/ 

A friend of ours here,has a son living near you,(Somewhere...) who was checking out different Orthodox Churches down there to try and decide which one to attend. This is one he mentioned.

The Antiochian&apos;s were originally,mostly Lebanese and Palestinian ethnic Orthodox,until a large group of Protestant Christians converted to Orthodoxy about 20 yrs ago and joined up with them. So now they are an interesting mix of ethnic Orthodox and ex-Protestants.

All these earthquakes! Maybe the big one is coming at last? One good thing about earthquakes-they really cause a person to focus their prayers more precisely!

And speaking of the first hermits.You guessed it. Another book!(Don&apos;t worry.You don&apos;t have to read them all at once,but this is another really great one.)

&quot;Paradise of the Holy Fathers&quot;It begins with the life of St.Anthony and then hundreds of lives and sayings of many others in the Egyptian thebaid during the first century after Christ.

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on May 21, 2009, 3:19pm

I had an interesting experience the last two days in a row.

Yesterday morning,I dreamnt about being on the front porch of my best friend&apos;s family&apos;s home,whom I lived nearby when I was growing up in New Jersey. When I woke up,I remembered a time,years after I had moved away from there,that I went back to visit. It was right after I had first become a Christian (in CHARLOTTE North Carolina,by the way...)

I got to my friend&apos;s house late at night and,since I had a sleeping bag with me,I rolled it out and slept on Their front porch. That morning,I had a dream that I saw a cross in the sky,which I proceeded to point out to everyone. Iwoke up told my friend&apos;s that I had become a Christian and had just had this amazing dream while sleeping on their front porch.

Every morning,my family and I have morning prayers together. We read from the,&quot;Morning Prayers&quot;section of our&quot;Jordanville prayer book,&quot;selections from the&quot;Pentecostarion,&quot;(During this season between Pascha and Pentecost,) We read the Epistle and Gospel of the day as indicated by our St.Herman of Alaska calendar, and,finally,a selection of lives of the saints for that day from,&quot;The Prologue of Ochrid,&quot;by St.Nicholia velomirovitch.

In the Prologue for yesterday we discovered that on that day,(May 7th,by the old calendar,) in 357ad, A cross appeared in the sky over Jerusalem which thousands of people saw,both believers and unbelievers.

Somehow I must have known.

Then this morning,pretty much the same thing happened. I woke up concerned about my eldest son who spends too much time watching tv and movies and listening to the radio and playing around on the computer,so,I wrote down for him this:

&quot;God reveals Himself,His knowledge,wisdom and power to the silent mind. Whereas,the mdia fills our mind with all kinds of noise and other garbage. The cup must be left clean and empty before the Divine liquor is poured into it. There are two kinds of knowledge.One is ABOUT things,the other is OF things. One is infinitely greater than the other. We are what we eat,(or whatever we allow into our mind.&quot;)

And in the prologue this morning was the life of a saint,(St.Arsenios,) and a homily about the same subject.

It&apos;s another way of knowing things then we are used to.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on May 21, 2009, 3:30pm

Left out an&quot;E&quot;. The MEDIA fills our mind...

I believe that the MEDIA is the WORST thing for people in general and for children,in particular. It is almost entirely a form of propaganda and black magic designed to mislead,misdirect,fascinate and distract in the most entertaining way possible!

Forgive me,I&apos;m ranting!

(Besides the media,white sugar and public school are the other worst things for children...)

We have purposely tried to preserve our children from these things,as far as possible,(but not far enough!)

However,they are coming to that age where,all we can do is present them with the facts,(As far as we understand them...) and let them decide for themselves.

So far,so good. Only time will tell at this point. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Good morning Mr. Berger,

I am pleased to know that you lend credence to dreams, to what degree I don&apos;t know, as I do in a practical way regarding the five types of dreams expounded by Greek Philosopher Artemedorus, who claimed that Apollo came to him and gave him a system to interpret dreams. He was adviser to Marcus Aurelius, so was Plotinus. I mention this because I like being in the company of Great Men.

Just briefly I would say now, there are three&quot;average&quot;dreams as the reflection of our daily life and our mortal psyche, the fourth transcendental/telepathic/clairvoyant, and the fifth the&quot;True or Oracle Dream&quot;, which needs no interpretation, it is clear what it is. It is not mine to define or interfere with your dreams or experiences, but I think they belong to the latter two. I had such myself.

I see vage outlines of more books in the air as I read your elucidation on morning prayers, and understand the rest of what you write in that vein.

Your ranting about the Media I second with the exact same words, the methods and goal so blantently obvious that I wonder if anybody is actually listening to this dangerous form of Hypnotism, and worse, act upon it. Legal drug sellers are the most loathsome.

White sugar no, dark Chocolate yes.

I just noticed the nice colored stars Don gives out.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on May 23, 2009, 10:19am

I hearken to this&quot;The Secrets of the Universe&quot;, for instance, as I read:

&quot;The Paradise or Garden of the Holy Fathers being the Histories of the Anchorites Recluses Monks Ceonobites and Ascetic Fathers of the Desert of Egypt between A.D. CCL and A.D. CCCC Circiter compiled by Athanasius Archbishop of Alexandria: Palladius Bishop of Helenopolis: St. Jerome and others&quot;.

Though I don&apos;t know the Histories yet, I knew from previous studies that at that time and in those locations the secrets of the Universe and how they relate to Mankind were compiled. The year 0 was bridged by ca 500 years B.C. and 500 A.D., to make it an even 1000 years. Once began, it is hard to stop reading in these books as the True keeps beckoning.

My ears also perked up reading such as, that time/space and the laws of physics are but temporay limitations protecting us from our own worst intentions. I knew this and you confirmed it by wording it.

Not to be missed, the question of what our Original face looked like before our parents begot us, which brings me back to the direct correlation and interrelationship between Mind and Matter, and our Thinking/Feeling/Willing setting the the pattern which sub-atomic particels, atoms, molecules, cells, etc., rush to fill. Again a confirmation of what I learned in quantum and particle physics, and wove my own strings out of string theory, remembering that the Great Hermes&quot;whirled through space organizing matter.&quot;I have realized long ago that, so to speak, nothing happens without Hermes.

This correlation and interrelationship also brings me back to&quot;we are the stuff that dreams are made of and our little life is rounded by a sleep&quot;, to which you answered that it is time to wake up and become the God-like Creatures we really are. I then asked if we could say that we are imagination stuff, but forgot how you replied. Considering all this, is our Ideal of ourselves and how we perceive all, above and below, embodied in our face and form? And the more Light/Knowledge of Things we gather and make our own the more delightful we become? As in we rise and fall together.

Yes, the Icons draw my eyes as if alive, and so I feel is the Church in Alhambra, full of Light at times.

We are,above all,creators,engaged in this great journey of Self-discovery and Self-mastery.

As our facial expression and&quot;body language&quot;changes now to reflect our changing thoughts and feelings,so will our entire environment when we get the hang of it.

Dreaming is a natural skylight into the many invisible worlds which interpenetrate our physical reality.

As far as dreams go,the Orthodox are, seemingly, schizophrenic about them. On the one hand,there are many,many examples in the Bible and in the lives of the saints, of especially the last two categories of dreams you listed,(not to mention what would be considered,lucid dreaming,out of the body experiences,bilocation,teleportation,etc.)

However,on the other hand,we are instructed,especially in the early stages of Purification and Illumination,not to pay undue attention either to anything in our dreams or to anything that might appear to us during contemplative prayer,(visions,voices,lights,colors,angels appearing,etc.)

Why is that? There are bodiless beings who can communicate with us that don&apos;t necessarily have our best interests in mind. Until we are fully grounded and have developed our faculty of discernment,(which the Fathers define as,&quot;The ability to taste different flavors of reality,)it is best and safest for us not to trust what we see in dreams or visions to readily. If something is really from God,eventually it will become known to us.

&quot;Beloved,believe not every spirit,but try the spirits whether they are of God.&quot;1st epistle of John 4:1

Many have been deceived by believing every spirit. In fact,whole religions and various denominations have begun in such a manner!

The Icons are like video-phones connecting us to the beings they represent,so,again,we are constantly in communication with invisible beings,but at the same time,we are cautious about it... Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on May 23, 2009, 3:55pm

Barbara and I owned and operated an Orthodox bookstore in Chicago after we were first married. We lived in the back. When the bookstore was closed,it was, more or less,our living room. I used to go out there in the evenings and,because of all the Icons we had in there,I used to feel that the place was full of all of these consciousnesses present there with us.

The key word for an understanding of Orthodoxy is,&quot;Otherworldliness.&quot;For the Orthodox,it is a given that there are many other viable realities which overshadow and interpenetrate our small terrestrial sphere. We live and move and breathe within these other realities.

The only reason we don&apos;t perceive them directly all the time is that our upbringing has trained our ATTENTION to focus on a very narrow band of perception. Everything about Orthodoxy,the entire Orthodox way of life,is a means of rounding up our usually scattered ATTENTION,and learning how to focus it in other directions than it has become accustomed to,in a careful and consistent manner.

Orthodoxy has many safeguards built in to it to allow this process to take place in a way that is most beneficial for us and free from many of the dangers which may come from opening ourselves up,before we are really ready to handle it gracefully, to the beings and forces,which may seek to influence us one way or another.

Yes, I attended yesterday&apos;s Vesper at St. Mathew, clearly spoken by Father Aquaro, who afterwards, as I signed the Guest Book, came and introduced himself. We spoke a few minutes, me saying that I first visited St. Steven&apos;s, then the Mission Parish of Fr Tomasi, where someone told me of St. Mathew&quot;right around the corner.&quot;Convenient it is, 10 minutes vs a good hour if the freeways are free.

Fr Aquaro, who resembles Bishop Maxim in Cauntenance, then welcomed me with a handshake and warm smile and invited me to the Liturgy today. Relative to St. Steven&apos;s the Church is modest, but I felt good in it.

Wasn&apos;t the Blind Man&apos;s Vesper before? Do they repeat every so often?

Well, yes, the changing of facial expression, body language, and general improvement of our health and environment is what I meant with the word delightful. I have to get ready, but have more to say later.

I believe you&apos;re thinking of the paralytic. It&apos;s a yearly cycle.

You are certainly getting a well-rounded experience of the different ethnic Churches,which is a good thing! You will have to try a Greek one,some day, just to make it complete...

Our Deacon gave a very good homily today on the Gospel. One thing He said fit in with what we were saying about ATTENTION. He said,that,in the words of the Fathers,&quot;The eyes are like two arms which reach out to touch whatever it is that we love the most.&quot;

Another similar thing which relates to this is The Fathers definition of&quot;Drunkenness,&quot;which is&quot;to love anything more than we love God.&quot;!!! (And by that definition,most everyone is walking around in a state of drunkenness most of the time!)

The Orthodox,however,are not usually,known to be,&quot;Teetotalers&quot;(Whatever THAT means?) After all, The first miracle that Jesus performed was to change water into wine.

In one of our&quot;Prayers before sleep,&quot;where we are asking for forgiveness for various offenses we may have committed during the day there is one which reads, not,&quot;If I&apos;ve been drinking alcohol,&quot;but,&quot;If I have drunk EXCESSIVELY...,&quot;

So,&quot;Moderation in all things,&quot;is recommended...

Looking forward to hearing how your morning went.

Had to wait to be logged out from morning lest it happens during the post.

Thank you, Steven, I did confuse the paralytic with the blind. I think there are two more Churches in the South Bay, perhaps one is Greek. How beautiful and true:

&quot;The eyes are like two arms which reach out to touch whatever it is that we love most&quot;. It&apos;s been long since I asked&quot;officially&quot;for forgiveness of transgressions before sleep, but sort of do it my own way. I drink only on special occasions and moderately, understand the miracle of changing of water into wine, and wasn&apos;t the first Commandment in the Temple of Apollo&quot;Nothing in Excess&quot;also? The second&quot;Know Thyself&quot;?

This morning at St. Matthew&apos;s I immediately felt&quot;Community&quot;, everyone was singing with heartfelt devotion, it was beautiful. I felt a strong bond between Fr Aquaro and the people, and equally strong and most reverend bond with Rt. Fra Paul M. Doyle. When the Elder Gentleman, full of Grace, spoke/sang you could hear a pin drop at times, even the children seemed to hold their breath. Several times the&quot;otherworldly&quot;Atmosphere was palpable, permiating the Church and especially about the Altar. Can one say the Liturgy grew to be magical? As if Fr Aquaro knew/knows, he sang&quot;we will not speak of the Mysteries....

After Communion, the Church Administrator tapped me on the shoulder and gave me a piece of blessed bread with the best smile and demeaner I cannot describe. Indeed, there is something very special about this Church and the Elder Rev. Paul M. Doyle. It was the best of my four experiences, four also being the number of analysis, but I do want to visit with the Greeks.

At the end, Father Aquaro spoke on the significance of Memorial Day, meetings and such. He seems to run a tight ship and doesn&apos;t take too kindly to people who walk in&quot;when we&apos;re almost out the door&quot;. There is also a book store, and the people there too gather for lunch, but I left,&quot;Moderation in all things&quot;, allow me....

I want to say a few things about spirits, but simply have to shred the last box of 7 years of bank papers, checks, and all papers with my name, adress etc., on it to close this chapter, glancing over my life in the process. And guess what I found among these papers? A Dead post card with handwritten Season&apos;s Greetings from Jerry, and another written on his behalf from&quot;Julie&quot;, hoping that the weather is, and is probably great in XX, typical lol, in response to mine. Does this qualify for things happening in harmony of with what is here currently?

Reader 1000

I think you know that with statements such as&quot;I am pleased to know that you lend credence to dreams&quot;, I don&apos;t mean you would adhere to them as many people adjust their daily lives by looking up in the morning in an interpreters handbook what their dream means. (I interpret my dreams according to what&apos;s happening in my life). Similarely, many people do what their psychic adviser suggests even if nothing works. I knew a Lady who kept giving her son medicine even though it made him sick because the Doctor had prescribed it. The cause of such being that those people were trained during upbringing to blindly believe authority, whether of the psyche, scientific, religious, or political, and once grown up, are daily bombarded with so much garbage that I hear many people say,&quot;I don&apos;t know what&apos;s what anymore&quot;, resonating with your description concerning the Spirit World.

I think there is a basic hard-wired safeguard in every person as to perceiving other realities, which you aptly describe. I had visions of benevolent kind only, never saw spirits or heard voices, but felt presences of both kind, benevolent and malevolent while awake. The former I cherished, the latter I banned by calling a circle of Angels about me. While slumbering one evening, I heard someone jumping from my bedroom window next to my bed, and heard a few footstep. That was scary, I knew it wasn&apos;t a physical body, I opened my eyes, sat up and called upon my angels.

When I lived in a different house, someone hit me twice on the shoulder while &apos;going to sleep&apos;. This I knew was my neighbor who recently passed away. She hit me quite hard because she did not like me very much, and was around for quite some time.

There is a story to this. I visited her in the hospital, she couldn&apos;t speak but took my hand, and I tried to ease her difficult time. After about a minute I began to feel faint and perspire terribly, but had enough strenght left to withdraw my hand, and walk to the next room. There, her son asked what was wrong with me, why was soaked in sweat, I told him nothing, that I just needed some time to gather my wits, which I did, and walking out the Hospital door, the entire world was empty and new, yet in the&quot;background&quot;all was the same, which gradually became the foreground again. It was a powerful experience, to say the least.

All you say concerning spirits I understand and agree with, having learned of it before also.

I hope you, and all other Readers, are having a good weekend.

Born spiritually blind

INCIPIT

Before lip touches lip, ere the eyes weep,
Or hands reach out or feet run here and there,
We dream not thus, not dimly are aware,
But one with an all-knowing sentient deep,
Where life is merged in Being, as the light
Of stars in day. Then once a soft enquiring
Troubles our quiet, we stir with old desiring,
And lean to earth, draw in, and lose our sight;
Tremble, and know not if with fear or bliss,
Feeling Love&apos;s wings beat near us in the night,
And closing sense and gross responsive limbs,
We, yet not we; then mused we test our might,
And with a terrible cry the spirit dims,
Desperate too late beneath our mother&apos;s kiss.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on May 26, 2009, 10:27am

Many years ago,some friends of mine and I were fooling around with a ouija board. At first,I was skeptical that it would work,but,sure enough,when we put our fingers on the planchette it started to move and spell out things and we developed a relationship with one particular entity that we used to communicate with. Eventually,this one friend of mine and I were in Boston and were using the board to send messages back and forth to other friends of ours in California,(kind of like an early version of e-mail...)

What started to happen though,is that we began to be more and more sensitive to these invisible beings who were trying to communicate with us and we would feel them hovering around us,wanting us to get out the board and talk to them. Next thing you know it was like we had opened the floodgates and we were constantly being besieged by all sorts of entities wanting to get to us,almost as if there was a big sign on the other side saying,&quot;Humans who are aware of us! Right this way! Come one,come all!&quot;

Finally,it just got to be too much.Then,some unpleasant and unfriendly entities started showing up and we began to have a series of unfortunate accidents and other strange coincidences and experiences. At that point,we just said,&quot;We&apos;ve had it. That&apos;s enough.&quot;and we got rid of the thing.

Now,with Orthodoxy,it&apos;s a similar kind of thing.We are learning how to focus our ATTENTION in different ways.We are becoming more sensitive.We are communicating with the Saints and Angels.We&apos;re praying for our departed loved ones,and especially,we are trying to focus on and draw near to Jesus and the Mother of God. We&apos;re developing a closer and closer relationship with them. Because,ultimately,Orthodox Christianity is not a&quot;Philosophy&quot;or a set of&quot;Rules&quot;to follow,but,a personal relationship with the living God.

At the same time,however, we are opening our awareness up to all kinds of other beings and forces as well,the veil between this world and the others is getting thinner and thinner,thus the need for caution and discernment. Especially,as we begin to make real progress in our spiritual life,we discover that there are some invisible beings who do not have our best interest in mind,who envy our potential and seem to be dedicated to trying to keep us from accomplishing our aims.

In fact,we are at war,not only with the mind of the world,which denies the existence of God and our own true nature,and with our OWN fallen nature,but with these invisible beings,as well.

&quot;We wrestle not against flesh and blood,but against powers and principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot;

Only those who have not tried to&quot;swim against the current&quot;can harbor any illusions on this subject. As soon as we try to draw closer to God,to wake up and rediscover who and what we rally are are,we find a thousand obstacles thrown in our path.

Perhaps these experiences are not so much the result of&quot;evil&quot;as a&quot;Touchstone&quot;for gold,to see in which direction our will truly inclines? Re: The Secret of the Universe

And so,we find ourselves back where we started from with the whole reason I began this thread in&quot;Countdown to Armageddon&quot;

Armageddon is the final battle between good and evil which takes place on the battleground of our own heart.

The weapons it is fought with are,Watchfulness and Prayer.

&quot;Guard the eye of the heart from evil suggestions as you would guard your physical eye from a needle.&quot;

&quot;Watch AND Pray,lest you enter into temptation.&quot;

The sign of the cross and the Jesus prayer are the greatest defense we have been given against evil suggestions. (As depicted in the Icon of St.Seraphim in the previous post...)

And finally,&quot;Our inner state becomes our outer environment.&quot;

By engaging ourselves in this&quot;Unseen warfare,&quot;we alleviate the necessity of confronting these same ills out-pictured in our immediate environment.

Thus,we are enabled to make a graceful transition into the indescribably more glorious life of the world to come where every INTENTION will be an INSTANTANEOUS act of creation.

The&quot;End of the world,&quot;is not something to be feared,as the media would have us believe.

Rather,the&quot;End of the World,&quot;is a consummation devoutly to be wished for,because on the other side of the end of the world is the Kingdom of Heaven.

The&quot;End of the world,&quot;as we are defining it here, is a state of being that takes place within ourselves. As Orthodox Christians,we are trying to,&quot;Immenentize the Eschaton,&quot;or,&quot;bring about the end of the world&quot;in ourselves, so that we may begin to live with a&quot;Foretaste&quot;of the Kingdom of Heaven in the here and now.

Though I heard of ouija bord sessions and the like, I kept away from such gatherings, remembering the old German saying, be careful not to call spirits lest you don&apos;t know how to get rid of them.

Thinking more on spirits during work yesterday, I remembered wandering through the Forest and the spirits there as I now understand it. Then, I knew nothing of spirits, it was just the way one felt in the woods. Good thing too or I would have been frightened, as it was, I stopped now and then to look in the direction I thought I felt or heard something, which brings up the question, viz., as a child, being wholly unaware of other worlds interpenetrating this dimension, is one protected naturally? The only thing I was ever scared of, having heard stories, was the possibiltity of wild pigs charging me, but that never happened.

Time is running out on me this morning, I&apos;ll be back later.

Thank you

I certainly DO NOT recommend the Ouija board for the very reasons of your wise old German saying. We had a heck of a time getting rid of all those spirits we had opened ourselves up to.

The nature spirits,on the other hand are a different story.I&apos;ve had some amusing experiences with them. I&apos;ll never forget being in the Panhandle of Golden Gate park in S.F. and suddenly coming apon some nature spirits whose conversation with me went something like this:&quot;Hey. Look, there&apos;s a human who is aware of us. Hey you stupid human! Look at all this trash all over the place! What is wrong with you guys? How can you be so out of balance and harmony all the time? Don&apos;t you realize you&apos;re wrecking the whole place! Get it together!&quot;After which I made it a point to always pick up whatever trash I saw lying around,especially in that particular area!

They are around everywhere,but we have been trained not to perceive them. In&quot;Pagan&quot;cultures,(Which,incidentally,only means,&quot;Pre-Christian,&quot;without any of the negative connotation that has been unfairly attached to it...) the nature spirits were worshiped as gods,because the,&quot;Primitive&quot;people recognized the awesome work they do in the whole process of creation.

Perhaps you have read,years ago, a book about some people in Scotland who learned how to co-operate with the nature spirits and grew some remarkable vegetables:&quot;The magic of Findhorn.&quot;

There&apos;s so much more going on here than meets the eye. The world is a weird and wonderful place, if only we have the eyes to see...

And yet,people just continue on in their blindness,taking what&apos;s on the surface as&quot;Par for the course!&quot;

Uncanny characters in The Matrix. It is true that all of us are slaves, more or less, in the inner and outer worlds, but then life here is to learn how to free ourselves, which is what everyone is engaged in whether they know it or not, as both of us have noted before.

The question was:&quot;Do you believe in Fate?&quot;The man doesn&apos;t like the idea of not being in control of his destiny and answers&quot;no&quot;. I believe in Fate, a predetermined journey depending on circumstances and conditions at the very beginning, let&apos;s say the Fall causing action perpetuated by reaction until we intervene, which is our theme here. Nevertheless, as we fell in an orderly manner through the planets, it is said, so we have to ascend in an orderly manner and not one step can be omitted by force, I contend. We spoke about this pattern running through all creation. We cannot change Fate as every jot and tittle has to be accounted for before we can make progress in our spiritual life. Proportionally also, our inner state will reflect our outer environment. Fate has to be fulfilled to the vanishing point in all worlds.

We are swimming against the stream to draw closer to God and our own true nature and a thousand obstacles are thrown in our path, says Krishna,&quot;There is a war that opens the doors to heaven, Arjuna! Happy the warriors whose fate is to fight such a war.&quot;A Touchstone for Gold and a Touchstone for Love.

I read much on Nature Spirits some years ago, though not the book you mention, and we agree on the awesome work they do in the whole process of creation. Not being aware of their existence, I never had a conversation with any during my wanderings, probably because there wasn&apos;t any trash in the Forests, only berries and mushrooms, but they could have made themselves known and told me a wonderful story.

It&apos;s hard for me to keep up with you, Mr. Berger, work, appointments etc., reading, trying to complete my book&quot;Charlotte&apos;s Web and Francis Bacon&quot;so I can sit on my Laurels and live in luxery were it not for so much going on here.

I looked at all links and read The Assumption, again, fine language.

Ultimately, Orthodox Christianity is not a&quot;Philosophy&quot;or a set of&quot;Rules&quot;to follow, but, a personal relationship with the living God.

After boasting of being an Atheist (which I myself never quite believed) for a few years after leaving the Catholic Church, I did establish by simple conversation a personal relationship with God, leaving much to be desired. In any case, there was no one else to speak with, neither would I have told any human being my innermost thoughts.

I thought about The Youngbloods several times the past two weeks, and if Love is all I need my cup runneth over I almost said.

Wishing you a good, interesting and enjoyable trip to Arizona and so back with your daughter.

No Concert ever started without Jerry, no matter how long he picked about on his guitar strings, in the dark, his bent back turned to his fans who called for him with voiceless energy interspersed with joyful cry&apos;s of expectancy, and when he finally stepped into the Light the crowd and energy rose bending and flowing toward him and the Band lifting All up 1001 degrees.

While driving past your general neighborhood on my way home with Elizabeth,this old favorite of mine came to mind: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nju1Q1f4rI 

This evening is the vigil for the Feast of Pentecost which celebrates the descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles and the availability of that same Spirit of Wholeness and Truth to be poured out upon each one of us,if we so desire...

 http://www.anastasis.org.uk/PentAll.htm 

This is the final Feast of the Paschal season we have been celebrating for the past several months. As always, the language of these services is beautiful and exalted. It is,by far,one of my favorites and I wish you many Blessings on the Feast!

If I could sum things up in a nutshell,I would have to say this:

&quot;I believe wholeheartedly that there is ANOTHER KIND of reality that we are being prepared to enter into. Furthermore, it is the choices we make in this life,on a day to day,moment to moment basis,which determine,not only our ongoing fate in this world,but,perhaps even more so,how GRACEFULLY,we will enter into this OTHER KIND of reality. Therefor,it behooves us to choose carefully in every decision we are faced with and that, it is the business of the Church to help us in our ability to choose wisely.&quot;

May the acquisition of the Holy Spirit teach us all things and bring all things to our remembrance. Re: The Secret of the Universe

The Divine Poet of Verulam

Lov&apos;st thou thy life, then must thou too love me;
In this some store of solace sweet I find,
Propping my suit when passion wants a plea,
Upon the subtler logic of the mind;
Whereof if thou the argument would&apos;st know,
&apos;Tis this, that of thy life my life is part,
Here while thou&apos;rt here, and gone when thou dost go,
Who of my every sense sole sovereign art;
So dost, living, to thy life confess
That kindness wherin I thus claim a share,
Since what thou giv&apos;st thy life thou must no less
Give me, or else thy life with mine forswear.

And so, when we may love&apos;s fond claim debate,
Thou art my witness, judge and advocate.

I was short on time this morning, the full Moon flooded my living room and I sat with my coffee cup fo quiet a while in it&apos;s light, then reached for Shakespeare. &apos;Twas one of those mornings in untrammeled Heights and to dissolve by.

But I love Refinement
And the Beautiful are for me
As the desire for Sunlight

So I was destracted when logging on, finding the Vesper, book, and the many songs, for which I thank you. Procol Harum is one of few&quot;clear lyrics&quot;singers, and his Whiter Shade of Pale has moved me many times.

I also attended the past two Vespers at St. Matthew, sadly, there were only two of us at the first, one a Church Usher, at the second three of us, one the same Usher. It didn&apos;t matter to me. There is a constant petitioning for Mercy and Blessings, and&quot;Let us pray to the Lord&quot;for the President of the United States, all secular Institutions, our armed forces everywhere in the World, all Cities, Friend and Foe, and everybody else, so to speak. Several times during the Service the aforementioned Elder Reverend turns and says&quot;Wisdom&quot;, which I like, and &apos;I will not speak of thy mysteries to thine enemies&apos; reminds me of WS &apos;Let him approach, a stranger, no offender&apos; to learn of his mysteries.

Thought I sort of give a progress report. Life of the Holy Apostles with its Poetic, and yes, exalted and tutorial language is hard to put down.

Found a copy of the book you mentioned online and took a look at it.I began reading the first chapter where it talks about the creation of man as microcosm and the fall and consequences of the fall. Very interesting. And,of course,the information about what is known as,&quot;Sympathetic magic,&quot;and the whole science of&quot;Sympathetic vibrations,&quot;is very interesting as well. While not going into such detail about it,(Such as,how to make amulets against the plague by using toads and so on and so forth...) This is how difficulties are resolved in Orthodoxy,by applying a higher vibration in a given situation that resolves the conflict from above,rather than trying to confront an obstacle on the same level as it is encountered.

The novel,&quot;The Magus,&quot;is about an experimental form of interactive theater which dissolves the boundaries between stage,actors and audience,in which the&quot;characters&quot;in the&quot;Play&quot;help the&quot;Audience&quot;to go through a cathartic experience meant to bring them to&quot;Self-Knowledge,&quot;and,at least,to some degree of&quot;Self-Realization.&quot;

The book is similar in theme to a movie starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn,called,&quot;The Game.&quot; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kqQNBR09Rc 

I just realized that the main characters in both the book and the movie have the same name,(Nicholas) Perhaps a tip of the hat to the book where the idea came from?

If I could afford it,I would open a restaurant called,&quot;Dinner Theater,&quot;along the same lines...It would be a truly unique dinning experience! Re: The Secret of the Universe

&quot;The Magus&quot;I have is voluminous in scope, and making amulets against the plague using toads and such the meaning of which I can barely glean on the horizon.

In my philosophy class we had to carve an amulet, so I took a piece of wood, sat on the beach at San Pedro Harbor and carved a Grail Cup. I heard an awesome sound of a huge mass of metal buckling, looked up and saw a cargo ship heading straight toward me slowed down by the retaining wall of boulders. It was so scary that I ran way back from the water, even though I knew the ship had to stop in the sand. When I told my Teacher what happened he was overly taken aback and wanted to hear every detail, couldn&apos;t get over it. I had the feeling he thought that my carving the Grail Cup caused the incident, whereas for me it was only exeedingly eerie, but knowing he was not given to fanciful notions I thought about it for a while.

The marvelous Greeks had Theater down path, methinks, I can&apos;t tell you how much I lovs them Philosophers, and many times one can glean the script writers in them thar Hollywood Hills of some such movies, many movies. And so on....

Asked by a short time acquaintance, Susan, I saw Fantasia years ago and didn&apos;t like it at all. Walking back from the Theater she said or did something, don&apos;t remember, but I looked at her and to my fright saw she was a witch. Before that I didn&apos;t believe witches existed, and didn&apos;t give it much thought afterward, neither.

Reminds me of Khufu&apos;s Magician, and Magus Simon and his conjurations, though not of the same kind as Mickey Mouse&apos;

Here is the only other excerpt from&quot;Fantasia&quot;that I really like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIv7pydf2Tc&amp;feature;=related 

The beginning of prayer is to recognize that God always sees us and simply,to look back.

The middle of prayer is to be aware of what God is communicating to us and to strive to live a life in keeping with that awareness.

The end of prayer is to become entirely one with God,without losing our entirely unique,individual perspective and personality. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Indeed, I too like it much better and the sprity ballet, but then I would. Strange that I can&apos;t remember anything about the movies, must have blocked it out cause of Susan who I can still see.

Equally strange, a new type of cloud called&quot;The Armageddon Cloud&quot;was shown during the news yesterday, sort of three to four layers, but said the&quot;Geek&quot;scientist, not to worry, it just appears menacing because of the upward movement of condensation to become water droplets attaching themselves to dust particles, continuing in a scientific humorous streak which was neither humorous nor intelligible to the TV Host or me. Sorry, but it was irritating.

Thank you for the prayer line, In a sense I don&apos;t pray very much, in another I think I pray all the time. I&apos;m looking forward to see and attend Liturgy at the Greek Church in Redondo Beach tomorrow, the Vesper I&apos;ll tend to St. Mathew for someone to be there.

Prayer,especially as described above,is essentially a telepathic form of communication with God. Something that,in our original blessed state,would be entirely natural to us. As it is now,we are unused to focusing our attention in this manner.

Prayer is a lost art which we can rediscover and make great use of. St.Paul enjoins us to,&quot;Pray without ceasing,&quot;which points towards this clairvoyant relationship of communion with God.

God wants nothing more than for us to share in His consciousness,to become,&quot;Participants in the Divine nature,&quot;as St.Peter writes in one of His Epistles.

Many blessings to you for your weekend! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Jun 13, 2009, 12:33pm

Prayer is reaching out to God with our innermost being. It is a longing to draw closer to God,to be present with God,to be in God&apos;s presence. It consists of our heartfelt desire for God to dissolve the walls in our consciousness which separate us.

The Divine services offer us an opportunity to exercise this form of contemplative prayer in a peaceful atmosphere totally dedicated to prayer.

The corporate prayers said in Church are nothing more than meaningless words until we&quot;make them our own&quot;and offer them up to God from the bottom of our heart.Then they become powerful engines of creation. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Jun 14, 2009, 7:07pm

We are born,grow up and live inside of a bubble,a bubble of our own,limited perspective.This bubble both insulates and isolates us. It insulates us from being overwhelmed by the universal sea of consciousness within which we live,move and have our being. But,at the same time,it isolates us from the knowledge,wisdom and power which is the ground of our being,and thus,we feel that something is missing in our lives,that,somehow,we are incomplete.

So,this bubble we live in is,at first, a guardian,the guardian of our own,unique individuality. This guardian however,all too easily becomes a guard,keeping us from realizing the fullness of our being.

Our entire spiritual life and especially our prayer life is a means of opening that bubble in such a way that the Holy Spirit may overshadow and indwell in us,restoring us to our original blessed state and rendering us God-like,which is to say,fully human as human beings were originally Intended to be.

Last Sunday,we celebrated the Feast of Pentecost which makes available to us the acquisition of the Holy Spirit. This Sunday we celebrate All Saints,or,all of those who have gone before us who have accomplished what we too hope to accomplish,that is,to become fully human.

 http://orthodoxkansas.org/allss.jpg 

The Liturgical year of the Church continues on this coming Monday with the beginning of the Apostle&apos;s Fast,one of the four great Fasts of the year. The Church in Her wisdom is pointing out for us how we too can be numbered among the&quot;Cloud of witnesses&quot;which we have commemorated today. By voluntarily renouncing our attachment to all created things in favor of the creator,we make ourselves into fit vessels for the Holy Spirit to descend into,and,like the Apostles before us,thereby, we may also be transformed from&quot;Fishermen&quot;into Theologians and&quot;Fisher&apos;s of men.&quot;

The Apostle&apos;s Fast ends with the Feast of the two pre-eminent Apostles,Sts.Peter and Paul,after which,we,in the spirit of these two great Evangelists,continue our own Apostolic labors of spreading the Gospel,first and foremost,by the quality of our lives. No matter where we go or who we meet we are ambassadors for Christ. God will be judged by others by how WE live our lives. Re: The Secret of the Universe

&quot;We are put on earth a little space that we may learn to bear the beams of love.&quot;

This is the essence and ultimate aim of our Spiritual life,That is,to&quot;Bear&quot;in both senses of the word,&quot;To carry&quot;and&quot;To be able to stand,&quot;these beams of love.

These beams of love want to dissolve everything that keeps us from being entirely one with God.Paradoxically,this is both the thing we want more than anything and,at the same time,the thing we are most afraid of.

Hallo Steven and Don,

Indeed, some of your wise words, pardon me, I heard yesterday attending the Liturgy in the Greek Church.

Again, situated beautifully among three other Churches, it is larger than St. Steven&apos;s though not as elaborately decorated by any means, and contrasted with St. Matthew&apos;s it is almost huge.

Some of the ceremony was in Greek language, the Priest, whose name is not on the weekly schedule, spoke of&quot;exercise to Godliness&quot;, as well as physical exersice, St. Paul, and the Feast of the Apostles. Being a Laker fan, he described some of their shots and asked everyone to pray for them, and I am too happy that they won.

What I missed there was the solemn ritual preparing for the Holy Communion I loved at St. Steven&apos;s and St. Matthew&apos;s. Being done behind closed curtains in what seemed a very short time, it left sort of a void, so I think I will stay with the latter and at times drive to Alhambra for the sheer beauty of, and feeling in the Church.

I purchased an Icon yesterday, and learned some introductory literature, as well as of the Sacrament of Baptism, your informative posts most helpful and much appreciated.

Charlotte

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Jun 15, 2009, 7:41pm

Ooh. Which Icon did you get?

Baptism,as we mentioned earlier,is the doorway into the Sacramental life of the Church. And the Sacraments are what activate and make all the rest of the Orthodox way of life possible.

I would assume that you were Baptized as a child in the Catholic church? Many Priests would accept that as valid and receive you into the Church through Chrismation. And IF your Priest directed you to so do,I would accept it as the Grace of God...However,if it were myself,I would humbly request to be Baptized anew so there would be no ambiguity in my complete conversion. (Especially if I had not been a practicing catholic for quite some time...)

All of that,of course would be at the discretion of both yourself and whichever member of the clergy you had developed this special relationship of being brought into the fullness of the Church with.

It is also traditional when one is Baptized to have God-parents who stand up for and with you at your Baptism,who pledge their undying support for you in your continued spiritual life.When someone is Baptized as a child,obviously,they have no choice in the matter of who their God-parents will be. As an adult,however,there is more leeway when it comes to choosing who your God-parents might be. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jun 16, 2009, 8:56am

Asking, I will tell thee (language used by Orthodoxy) in secret, the Icon is Christ arrayed, in a blue-green&quot;cosmic egg&quot;, in his left hand the Cross, the bottom cross-bar level, not slanted, the familiar image of the right arm raised and mysterious finger position, entitled THE RESURRECTION.

Yes, I was baptized a Catholic, but even if accepted it would be a permanent hindrance in that no water of their&apos;s has ever flowed into my Heart. I&apos;d rather remember my personal relationship with God, after.

God-parents I would have to choose from the Congregation as I have no friends here, and don&apos;t mind. Come to think of it, I don&apos;t even know who my God-parents were then.

In the Greek Church, I also missed the Immortality Chant during Holy Communion in which all present partake. It has become easier to cross myself, almost natural, you understand, pardon me, and haven&apos;t slipped in doing it correctly as of late. Other things I have began privately.

I read&quot;St. Seraphim of Sarov on Acquisition of the Holy Spirit&quot;, kindly and informative.

Wishing you and everyone a great day

As far as the Greek Church in America goes,it is the one who&apos;s demographics are most weighted at the outer circles and have been wounded most severely by exposure to the&quot;American dream,&quot;while at the same time,remaining most ethnocentric.&quot;You&apos;re not Greek.Why would you want to be Orthodox?&quot;Were there pews there and did they have an organ? Lord have mercy! Highly un-canonical!

On the other hand there are one group of Greeks here in America who are the complete opposite side of the coin. These are all connected to Fr.Ephraim, who was formerly the Abbot of Philotheou Monastery on mt.Athos and has since begun many monasteries here in North America.

This Elder Ephraim resides at St.Anthony&apos;s Monastery in Florence,AZ, not far from St.Paisius Monastery,where my daughter had been going to school. The two Monasteries have a close relationship.

 http://www.stanthonysmonastery.org/index.php 

Elder Ephraim is one of the few recognized Clairvoyant Elders living in the world today and has done much to bring genuine Orthodox spirituality here to America.

 http://lh5.ggpht.com/_IvQjZJDLO7k/R8JeFi0c1RI/AAAAAAAADdE/ZT1auEFgjyQ/1-61.jpg 

Notice where everyone&apos;s attention is focused in this photo and you will see Elder Ephraim. I have had the good fortune to receive His Blessing a number of times over the years. He is getting quite old now,but the Bible verse which comes to mind every time I meet him is this:&quot;Ye must become as little children if you wish to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.&quot;

St.Seraphim&apos;s&quot;Acquisition of the Holy Spirit&quot;is an absolute classic! Especially in the bottom 1/4 of the article from the point where it says,&quot;Then Father Seraphim took me firmly by the shoulders and said,&quot;We are both in the Spirit of God now,my son...&quot;

As far as God-parents go,one of them,at least,could even be someone you have only met on the internet who would be willing to fly down there for such a momentous occasion...(Wink.Wink.Hint.Hint.)

This is the impression I had concerning this particular Greek Church, a bit cold relative to the others, no singing, only one time incensing and only by the Altar, no walking through the Church with the Holy Host, or when praying for one and all and the World, the repeated chant&quot;Lord have Mercy&quot;.

I like that part too with Father Seraphim.

Wow! I may say, that you would actually fly south to LA is most thoughtful and kind, having been all along a God-parent, if you please pardon me again. I hope it won&apos;t take too long for me to learn and know enough about Orthodoxy for such a momentous occasion.

There is something to be said about the Hobo who hurt his leg fighting in the cold, but here in LA, as the song goes, from the South Bay to the Valley the sun is shining every day, looks like another perfect day. These days, however, not quiet so perfect, but things are looking up I heard on the radio yesterday, and perhaps California Dreaming will once more become a reality, so I don&apos;t mind.

Post by renwdimgink on Jun 17, 2009, 1:35pm

Dear Charlotte,
As far as I am concerned,I would consider it an honor to attend your Baptism in any capacity and doubly so to be your God-Father.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL0LoecE8ew&amp;feature;=related 

The next step would be for you to decide where you would like to be Baptized and,since it is most convenient for you and you seem to feel at home there,there is no reason why it shouldn&apos;t be at St.Matthew&apos;s. Although,if you had an opportunity to speak with Bishop Maxim at the Cathedral in Alhambra about it,this would be appropriate also,because of my connection with Him. Perhaps the Bishop himself might even officiate,who knows?

This is entirely up to you. No matter where you are Baptized,afterwords you may go into any Orthodox Church throughout the world,attend services and ask for a blessing to receive communion there.

Once you have decided where,the next step would be to go to the Priest there,(or the Bishop,) and tell them&quot;that you would like to become a Catecumen, and begin preparing to be Baptized.&quot;and they will take it from there.

I was thinking this morning,that it is very appropriate that the first Orthodox book you have been reading is&quot;The lives of the Holy Apostles.&quot;(By the way...have you gotten up to St.John the Theologian? one of my very favorites!) This way,you can get a good,historical perspective in chronological order. After the Apostles,come the Apostolic Fathers,who were direct disciples of the Apostles,(Many of them mentioned in their lives.) Then,the first hermits and Monastics of the Palestinian and Egyptian deserts,beginning with St.Anthony,(Whose life,written by St.Athanasius,is stunning!) Then,extremely important! The lives of the first Christian martyrs of the first several hundred years of the Church&apos;s history. What did the first martyrs know? What did they posses that allowed them to face persecution and go willingly and even,joyfully to their death?

The next major event was the Edict of Milan,whereby,the Emperor Constantine made Christianity legal throughout the Roman Empire around 312 ad. From then until the 1400&apos;s is Known as the Byzantine Empire wherein,especially for the first seven hundred years or so,Orthodoxy flourished and spread throughout the Roman empire and beyond. Orthodox missionaries brought the new faith all over,both eastern and western Europe,Asia and the middle east. Monasticism flourished,Churches were built,Icons painted,Seven ecumenical councils were held to correct mistaken ideas about Christianity which had cropped up.

Things were going along just fine until around 800 or so when,Rome began to step away from Orthodoxy and,soon after,Islam sprung up and began to overrun the Byzantine Empire. By 1065,Rome officially broke away from the Church and began to be the&quot;Roman catholic church&quot;(And it was all downhill from there for them...)(Except of course for,as far as taking over all of western Europe goes...)(Too bad for western Europe though...) And then,the Protestant reformation,where,in order to&quot;Reform&quot;the Church,they simply threw out almost everything about it,except for The Bible,(Which they then proceeded to interpret according to their own understanding,rather than by the Apostle&apos;s Doctrine.)

After the downfall of Byzantium in the 1400&apos;s,Orthodoxy was preserved in Holy Russia and the other Orthodox,eastern European countries,such as,Serbia,Romania,Georgia,ect. (Whose histories are most interesting and informative.)

Unfortunately,Persecution by both Islam and the spread of western civilization kept Orthodoxy from growing and flourishing as it otherwise might have.

Two world wars and the communist revolution finally forced Orthodoxy out into the west where it remained in little ethnic pockets until concerned Pastors and American converts began to make it more well known and available to others,outside of these ethnic enclaves.

Which brings us to today,where,you are the fruit of my Apostolic labors,and where you will in your turn,have an opportunity to become another link in this golden chain of Sanctity,and to continue the work of the Apostles of spreading the Gospel,or,&quot;Good News,&quot;throughout the entire world.

The Orthodox do not as a rule,go door to door handing out pamphlets or standing on soap boxes in the middle of town,(Although,THAT one IS tempting to me,occasionally...) God arranges these things though,through the circumstances of our daily lives. For example.Someone might just be fooling around on the computer looking for interesting pictures and look what can happen?

Amazing!

Should I have a God-father or God-parents is the strangest feeling for me, rather, it is an Honor to know you, and to be the fruit of your Apostolic labors is yet another unusual thought for me.

I&apos;m sure I would need an appoinment to speak with Bishop Maxim, and would like to do so, needing to arrange my work schedule. I felt as though I had to read more, thinking of all the books you mentioned and links you gave, but I understand I would be given the necessary Literature.

I haven&apos;t gotten to St. John the Theologian yet, also for lack of time and general distractions, but it&apos;s my bed-time read. I am basically familiar with the historical synopsis you give in this post, and also learned of the continuity of the Orthodox Church in the eastern European countries when I began studying.

I&apos;m glad Orthodoxy does not go from door to door as do persons of some other Religions, I would have not been willing to listen as with the others, but as you say, and I know from experience that God arranges these things as fated. Eating in a Restaurant surrounded by Icons would be nice however.

Funny you should mention it! I owned and operated a pizza place in Greenfield Missouri,called&quot;Aloha pizza.&quot;(As a matter of fact,I still own it.It&apos;s for sale,in case you know of anyone who wants to buy a pizza place in Missouri...)

There were some Icons,but mostly,beautiful,original oil paintings of Maui,(where we lived before moving to Missouri,if you can believe THAT!) Painted by a local Maui artist and good friend of mine,Jack Hamilton. We played a lot of Hawaiian music in there along with,yes,you guessed it,a lot of Grateful Dead and everything else you and I have been sending back and forth to each other. Some days I would play nothing but Beatles or Moody Blues. Other days long compilations of songs I had put together which told a story of disillusionment with the world,melancholy,awakening and,ultimately,Enlightenment,Peace,Love,Joy and Cosmic Wisdom.(Rock and Roll Orthodoxy 101)

You can just imagine the conversations I used to have with my customers.(Not to mention the things I wrote,xeroxed and handed out to everybody.) We tried to maintain a peaceful and prayerful atmosphere in there at all times.(And the pizza was pretty durn good too,if I may say so myself!)

Our slogan was,&quot;A little Aloha in every pizza.&quot;I think you would have really liked it. We moved out here to be closer to the Monastery and Fr.Gerasim,or else I would probably still be running the place. I have several Ideas for places I would like to open out here IF I had a million EXTRA dollars,(Over and above the million my wife and children would need while I was busy playing around in the restaurant,that is...)

Of course,if I had a million extra dollars,I would have to be crazy to open a restaurant and not just simply retire,but we already have a pretty good idea when it comes to the matter of my sanity...

As far as Bishop Maxim is concerned-God Bless you!

Here is His phone # 626-289-9061

Here are several sample recommendations for your conversation with him:&quot;May I please speak to His Grace Bishop Maxim?&quot;
Secretary:&quot;In what regard?&quot;
Charlotte:&quot;My name is Charlotte.I have been in correspondence with a parishioner in Redding,Ca who attends St.Andrews Orthodox Church there. As a result of this correspondence,I would like to make an appointment to speak with His Grace about how I can go about becoming a catecumen and preparing to be Baptized,if I may.&quot;

If Bishop Maxim either answers the phone himself,or comes on the line,it would be most proper to address him thusly:&quot;Your Grace,Bless!&quot;He will then give you a Blessing and you may continue as above.

Once you actually get talking with him,you will see that he is entirely approachable,friendly and has a great sense of humor. I&apos;m sure he will get a kick out of the whole unusual story of how we have met and been carrying on.

Just let him know exactly what you want and that I recommended that whatever he recommends, you should,to the best of your ability,do.

I will be,as you can imagine,extremely interested to hear what he has to say!

I wish you all the best and look forward to hearing from you!

Sounds as if you have been in many places in the US, and even Maui, if I can believe that, must have been early in your life, playing said bands in tandem with transformational compilations. Reminds me of the following in&quot;The Lives of the Holy Apostles&quot;, page 3:

&quot;The following day, in the morning, Andrew went to his brother Peter and said to him:&quot;We have found the Messiah, the Christ!&quot;And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, He said: Thou art Simon, the son of Jonah; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, a stone. And straightway, Peter became aflame with love for the Lord, believing in Him as the true Christ sent by God for the salvation of the world.&quot;

There is much in this passage, and other subtleties in the language. At St. Matthew there are painted the Apostles to either side of Christ, He touching the Halo of St. Peter on whom He will build his Church. I also read the explanation of the&quot;Breath of Life&quot;to Adam, a bit more elaborate and clearer than I thought about it.

Good Pizza and lively conversation make a bussy place. I haven&apos;t checked my Lotto numbers lately but if I won I&apos;ll send you half.

I thought on Creation and Evolution yesterday, and unlike millions of people, seemingly, strictly accepting one or the other, these are not conflicting to me, having studied Embryology, Man the Microcosm, and Occult Anatomy. During thinking I remembered the crystal clear insight I had some years ago in what is meant by &apos;no one goes to my Father but through me&apos;, or as my Mother is wont to say today:&quot;No one gets by the Cross&quot;.

Thank you for the phone # of Bishop Maxim and the proper Address.

And the familiar songs, haven&apos;t seen the ring episode or Ringo being followed by a yellow submarine perhaps to an Octapus&apos; garden in the shade.

I had a really weird dream last night: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7kzsZreG0o 

I also do not believe that creation and evolution are mutually exclusive but that most of the people who try to defend one side or the other of the question do not understand either the science or the theology well enough to discuss the question intelligently or dispassionately.

Fr.Damascene,from up in Platina,has edited and is in the process of editing an updated version,of an excellent book on the subject: http://www.sainthermanpress.com/Catalog/....enesis_book.htm 

As it mentions in the add for the book,this issue of The Orthodox Word: http://www.sainthermanpress.com/Catalog/Writings_of_Father_Seraphim/OW_258-9.htm 
is also quite excellent. (Even moreso than for what it says concerning creation and evolution,for the sake of our spiritual life. How can we understand what God is trying to restore us to if we don&apos;t have a sense of what we were first created to be?)

Have a good weekend. My best wishes regarding the making of your appointment with Bishop Maxim. I look forward to seeing him again myself sometime soon !
 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jun 20, 2009, 12:53pm

I understand you speak from an advanced point of view, having behind you of what is in front of me regarding Rock and Roll Ordoxy 101.

Creation and the evolutionary process are not conflicting for me in that I understand the creative Word is stayed in Nature, or as Mr. Hall put it:&quot;Evolution is the Pilgrimage of Spirit through matter&quot;.

&quot;Indeed&quot;writes Fr Andrew of the Orthodox Church, it can be said that Evolution proves the Truth of the Scriptures. The Scriptures relate &apos;Who&apos;, whereas Science relates &apos;How&apos;. Thus, Evolution proves the existence of God&apos;s presence and plan in his Creation, for Nature itself is a Revelation of God, it is the &apos;living Scriptures&apos;. Indeed, it is often only when we know how to &apos;read&apos; Nature that we can begin to understand the Scriptures. Therefore, it can be said that true scientists are theologians of Nature, just as true theologians are scientists of the Scriptures.&quot;Beautiful! Paracelsus would agree.

&quot;We note that in the Book of Genesis, as in scientific evolutionary theories, Evolution proceeds from the lower to the higher, from plants to animals to man. Man is the crown of creation because he is made &apos;in our image, after our likeness&apos; (Gen. 1, 26), that is man resembles God the Holy Trinity. He is different from all else because God breathed life into him, that is, He endowed him with a &apos;living soul&apos; (Gen. 2, 7). As regards the creation of the human body, this is made from &apos;the dust of the ground&apos; Gen. 2, 7). We now understand this to mean the various chemical elements, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, calcium, iron, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus etc, which make up the human body&apos;s chemical composition and which are also found in the earth.&quot;

You mentioned sometime back Adam naming all the animals. Occult Anatomy teaches, as can be traced in the development of the embryo, that the human body does go through and recapitulates the mineral, plant, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, they being of diverse forms and different mental capacity, whereas Adam or Humanity, the Crown of Creation, is uniform and walks upright, obviously also of different mental capacity. That would mean Adam had to go through all these stages of evolution, know them and name them. Of course it was God who &apos;brought to him&apos; the creatures, and that was already&quot;east of Eden&quot;.

&quot;For example, Darwin&apos;s new theory of evolution clashes with the literal understanding&quot;of Genesis, hence&quot;the conflict between Darwin&apos;s theory of evolution and the literal interpretation of Genesis....&quot;The Fundamentalists&quot;do not understand the Scriptures spiritually, ascetically, allegorically, poetically, but only literally&quot;, but I understand them thusly.

&quot;Another classic misunderstanding (this time more by the modern, post-Protestant world) is that concerning what God created - &apos;the heaven and the earth&apos;. Many simply assume that this means the sky (and the planets and stars that are in it) and the earth. In fact, &apos;heaven means the invisible creation, that is the angelic powers, and the visible creation. Thus, the modern question: &apos;Are we alone in the universe?&apos; is simply absurd, in the light of the knowledge that exists not only in the visible world, but also the invisible world. Only Atheist can wonder if we are &apos;alone&apos; in the universe.

&quot;Moreover, as Orthodox, we would like to notethe following. We have seen how in the account in the Book of Genesis there is a progression in Creation from plants to animals to human-beings. Therefore, we also note that the last in the chain of Creation is not actually a man, but specifically women. Herein lies a great mystery. Although Eve began the process of the Fall, the greatest human-being in the Kingdom of Heaven, &apos;more honourable than the cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the seraphim&apos;, is not a man, but a women. Spiritually, women stands higher than man.&quot;

I know how&quot;Eve began the Fall&quot;and the astronomical &apos;story&apos; that belongs to it hardly to be thought in four sittings, and upon reading this I am totally reconciled apropos Orthodoxy and women. As my Philosophy teacher said:&quot;Man looks through women to God&quot;.

I know this is regressing from our main consideration, but had to make clear what I meant with no conflict between Creation and Evolution, and also lessen the possibility of being perceived a sycophant.

I see what you are saying. Through the disobedience of Eve,the fall takes place.Through the obedience to the word of God of Mary,redemption enters into the world. And when the female side of ourselves is receptive and obedient to the word of God,the consequences of the fall are reversed in us,bringing about a new creation.

Your daughter is named MYMN? And she was chosen teacher of the year for California? CONGRATULATIONS!

Sending me classical music? Trying to educate my palette,or something?

Hallo Steven,

Thank you for the eloquent summation, though Eva is not solely to blame and may be judged more mildly due to extenuating circumstances.

Thank you for Congratulations. As you might guess, MYMN are the first letters of my Daughter&apos;s first, middle, maiden, and surname. The article:

&quot;It is with great excitement that I would like to congratulate Mrs. ---- Outstanding First-Year teacher of the Year! She accomplished a lot in her first year of teaching and has made huge educational and personal impacts with her students and our learning community. Please join me in congratulating her on this fine achievement. Furthermore, this honor nominates her to be recognized on a statewide level as a California Association for Employment in Education (CAEE) First-year Teacher of the Year award nominee. Of course, we hope she wins this title as well; we all know it is well deserved.&quot;

She did! All credit goes to her Father. I had and have two nicknames for her,&quot;Schelsi&quot;as a term of endearment, and&quot;Felsen&quot;to let her know she is steady as a Felsen.

Thank&apos;s also for the Seventh. One of my favorites

Getting only the answering device after work, leaving my name and that I would call back, I did this morning and spoke with the Secretary concerning an appointment with Bishop Maxim. The Lady thought that since I attend St. Matthew, an Antiochian Church, it would probably be better to speak to people there, as St. Steven is a Serbian Church. I said I would and left my phone number.

I am sorry for my halting progress for you afford me much time and care for which I thank you, and I don&apos;t go by your posts without thought, and all has to be real and true in the Eye of my Heart lest I lie to my Icon here. Besides, my work demands attention.

While waiting out my cold and exceedingly sensitive tooth, I thought small talk would be fine, not that I think the good news about my Daughter was such, and if I may say that you would agree. By your reply I feel I have inadvertently annoyed you once again and beg your pardon. Considering daily life and all that comes with it I&apos;m doing as I am able.

Post by renwdimgink on Jun 26, 2009, 10:10am

Dear Charlotte,

Not at all! I&apos;m happy for you and you&apos;re daughter. Forgive me if I gave any impression to the contrary!

I was surprised,however,about the response you got from the Bishop&apos;s secretary,until I realized that it was,at least to some extent,my fault.

I was so excited about the idea of you becoming a catecumen and being Baptized,that I didn&apos;t stop to think that the Bishop usually wouldn&apos;t have much to do with that,personally.

I spoke to Papadia Sandra,who is both,the Bishop&apos;s secretary and the wife of Fr.Nick,who is one of the Priests at St.Stephan&apos;s.She was under the impression that you had been attending St.Matthew&apos;s exclusively,which is why she recommended what she did to you.

After explaining to her more of the story of you and I and&quot;As above so below,&quot;she had a better understanding of why you were calling and recommends that,if you would like to,you should seek her out at St.Stephan&apos;s and she will introduce you to her husband.

You may also want to call her again and this time,she will know who you are. She told me that she would love to have the opportunity to meet you after hearing how we have met and all.I have never met her,personally,but she knows my wife and eldest son.

She was also going to mention the two of us to the Bishop when she next spoke with Him. Who knows? He may bless this whole new field of Internet Evangelism!?!

It STILL MIGHT make more sense for you to talk to them at St.Matthews about all of this,at least,logistically. You will have to decide what you think is right. But I wouldn&apos;t discount St.Stephan&apos;s until after at least meeting and speaking to Fr.Nick and Papadia Sandra.

Once again,after you are Baptized,you will be welcome to receive Holy Communion in ANY Orthodox Church you go to or visit,so in that sense,it really doesn&apos;t matter in which one you are Baptized.I just thought it would be nice for us both to be under Bishop Maxim,was my only thought on the subject.

p.s.&quot;Papadia&quot;is how a Preist&apos;s wife is addressed in the Serbian Church.

Keep me posted!

Yours,
Steven

Hallo Steven,

I thought maybe you had gone to Heaven and left me here on the velvet side of hell. I&apos;m glad you returned.

Since a number of people seem to be interested in&quot;The Secrets of the Universe&quot;, I would have continued writing regarding the orderly process of becoming a Orthodox Christian as per my beginning and experiences along the path. It may also be that some people&quot;get a kick out of&quot;, did you say, our conversation and videos. No one is saying a word.

I wrote a request for an appoinment with Rev. George Aquaro, or whoever is in charge of initial information and guidance for a newcomer, will leave it at the desk after the Vesper today and wait for a response.

My plan is to drive early to Alhambra next Sunday to speak with Papadia Sandra and hear what the Lady has to say. It would truly be an Honor to meet Bishop Maxim, and as said before I do so like the beautiful Church. I read that Bishops are direct descendants from the Holy Apostles?

Thank you for communicating with several persons to make it easier for me to &apos;get my foot in the door&apos;, as such I shall bring Honor to your name, don&apos;t know the proper phrase in English.

I enjoyed the Liturgy, Father Aquaro had a cold and gave it to one of the other Priests, absent for that reason, he said. Other than that my weekend was mostly in the mundane, I did plant new flowers and tomato plants, very interesting &apos;tis.

Today I phoned Papadia Sandra and was told she is on vaccation for two weeks. I also spoke with Father Aquaro for some time, very pleasant conversation, and will meet with him Wednesday.

In Honor of AS ABOVE,SO BELOW 5th anniversary:

&quot;The holographic model offers revolutionary possibilities for a new understanding of the relationships between the parts and the whole. The part ceases to be just a fragment of the whole but,under certain circumstances,reflects and contains the whole. As individual human beings,each of us is also a microcosm that reflects and contains the macrocosm,therefore,we each hold the potential for having direct and immediate experiential access to virtually every aspect of the universe,extending our capacities well beyond the reach of our senses.&quot;

&quot;The universe of everyday life,which appears to us to be composed of solid,discrete objects,is actually a web of unified events and relationships. Within this new context,consciousness does not just passively reflect the objective material world;it plays an active role in creating reality itself.&quot;

&apos;Tis the more wished for as per my post to Don on another thread.

Every sentence Stan Grof writes I know to be true, bringing it thus to my awareness once again is much valued for to remember to be conscious of my thoughts and actions while challenged by daily distractions.

I met with Father Aquaro yesterday and we had an amiable conversation regarding my entry into the Orthodox Church. He reiterated much of what you had said and gave me a book,&quot;THE FAITH&quot;, and a little cross of gold and royal blue for my dashboard. However, it is rounded so I laid it on the passenger seat.

In&quot;THE HOLY LIVES OF THE APOSTLES&quot;I found Dionysius the Areopagite esteemed by my Philosophy Teacher, and a women named Damaris though nothing else was said besides she was baptized. I thought maybe Sir Walter Raleigh named his daughter after her, it wouldn&apos;t surprise me. Sorry, but these things are part of my greater picture.

Wishing you well

Dear don,
Pardon moi! Congratulations on quitting smoking! I don&apos;t know if I have any quotes from the Holy Fathers about smoking? How&apos;s this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIN8MmMloZE 

I have always found Stan Grof to be a great source of knowledge which comes directly from his own personal experience and observations.

When he says that,&quot;The part...under certain circumstances,reflects and contains the whole.&quot;These are the&quot;Certain circumstances,&quot;as far as Orthodoxy is concerned: http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b05.en.the_illness_and_cure_of_the_soul.01.htm 

And here is Dionysius the Areopagite himself on the Holotropic mind : http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeII/CelestialHierarchy.html 

Did Fr. Aquaro ask you how you found out about Orthodoxy? Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jul 3, 2009, 10:42am

Thank you for the links, which words I will read entirely after work.

&quot;The darkness which is Hell and alienation from God&quot;, reminds me of Sir Lancelot:&quot;I don&apos;t believe in heaven, I have been living in this hell&quot;, and says to King Arthur,&quot;you and your God, why do you always talk to God instead of me&quot;, to which the King replies that it is his Faith that sustains him.

By chance I surfed into the&quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, film that is, last night, which I watched several times a while ago, and during all the fighting thought of our inner state reflecting the outer environment. Good movie.

I could read the beautiful and elevating words of the Areopagite all day, surely he speaks as a Theologian&quot;wisely and scientifically exercised in things divine. Moreover, it must be born in mind that no single existing thing is entirely deprived of participation in the Beautiful, for, as the true Word says, all things are very beautiful&quot;.

&quot;To the pure all things are pure&quot;St. Spyridon

Father Aquaro also mentioned&quot;direct experience&quot;, and I mumbled something about the nickel droping or not, and he smiled. I also know from experience that understanding comes via experience.

Fr. Aquaro didn&apos;t ask how I found out about Orthodoxy, rather, in telling him that since I left the Catholic Church at about the age of eighteen, and during studying Philosophy and related subjects I developed my own relationship with God but never joyned a Church, I volunteered to say that a gentleman of the Orthodox Faith began writing about it on a web site and one step led to the next, and here I am.

Father Aquaro also asked if I had a certificate of Baptism from the Catholic Church, which would be acceptable as you had also informed me. I don&apos;t know, if so, it is in Germany, I answered. Then I remember the dunking and pictures I saw, huh, all the wet clothes clinging to the body for all to see, and added that I can check when I visit my Mother and family in late August. I might overcome this image in due time for the sake of making a clean break from the Catholic&apos;s.

St. Matthew has many books and Icons in their shop, and Fr. Aquaro mentioned he had another one he will give me to read, and that I had to do lots of reading. Sounded familiar.

A better than good day to you, and everyone

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Jul 4, 2009, 12:14am

Roman Catholic Theology is generally so scholastic,(Except for,perhaps, Theresa of Avilla and John of the Cross...) and Protestant Christianity is so one-dimensional.Most people don&apos;t realize the depth to be found in Orthodox Theology and never get around to reading something like,&quot;The Celestial Hierarchies.&quot;They just don&apos;t know what they&apos;re missing!

Your experience with Fr.Aquaro sounds just like I have said all along and like that&quot;Seinfeld&quot;episode I was telling you about,&quot;The Conversion.&quot;&quot;First,you must familiarize yourself with these texts...&quot;

As far as Baptism goes,the&quot;Dunking&quot;and all...You will just have to ask Fr.Aquaro how they go about doing adult Baptisms there. Perhaps He could arrange for it to be a more private affair,especially since you are practically a stranger there. (Although,generally,the whole congregation likes to take part.) However,if you explained to him that you are a generally shy and modest person,perhaps he could find a way to accommodate you. Modesty is a virtue after all.

It is good to read these words first thing in the morning, and yes, Orthodox Theology is rich in jeweled words and sentences, and its Spirit is not altogether&quot;beyond the reach of plummet&quot;for me, and I can see plumbed by those in Athens.

I remember Seinfeld and the familiarizing with the writ an ongoing process. I must say that your introduction was more than helpful and valued, to say the least.

I plan to call Bishop Maxim&apos;s office toward the end of the week to see if Papadia Sandra has returned, hoping the Lady will have a few minutes to spare. Depending, I might alternate in Sunday Liturgy and will inform Fr. Aquaro. I suspect it will take a few more weeks till I have a firm footing in this matter.

Beginning with the first sentence of this thread, there was never a shadow of a doubt in my mind, and so it is with the rest of your statement.

I had an interesting dream last night, i.e., upon hearing the doorbell I opened the door and a Lady said:&quot;Hi, I&apos;m Debby Reynolds&quot;, to which I answered&quot;you look different, I don&apos;t recognize you.&quot;With a &apos;it is&apos;t important&apos; smile she walked in as if in a known to both of us job she came to do such as was broadcast for month conserning people adapting to digital signal from analog.

I looked up and saw a 50&quot;TV screen full of tumbling rings accompanied by metallic sounds, perplexing, but thought it must be part of the process of reprograming the TV. I sort of watched and wondered how an actress like Debbie learned to be so accomplished in state of the art technology. After she left I looked about my living room, the 50&quot;TV was gone, instead there were two 22&quot;monitors such as I have, one visible all the time, the other appearing and disappearing depending on the angle I tilted my head, it flashing with iredescent colors. Finally I stepped back and noticed that all the furnuture in the room were changed also, and my attention was drawn to an old and massive wooden desk. &apos;How am I ever get used to all this different, rather plain and drab furniture - at least I have a desk&apos;, I thought, and a mysterious TV with color.

O.K. I will dabble in dream interpretation- Dreams about our&quot;Home&quot;and changes in our&quot;Furniture,&quot;represent changes in our inner landscape,which,of course,result in changes in our outer environment. Who better than&quot;Debbie Reynolds&quot;a very pretty,but not glamorous,&quot;perfect housewife&quot;type actress to effect these changes? Taking into consideration my theory that technology is a caricature of our own natural abilities,the change from,&quot;Analog&quot;to&quot;Digital&quot;would be a change from our old way of knowing things,i.e.,information gleaned through our five senses,processed through our rational mind,all viewed through the filter of a complex network of our own personal and inherited experience,to a new mode of knowledge via a direct perception of the&quot;Holotropic mind.&quot;

As for the,&quot;Plain and drab&quot;furniture,this may refer to the fact that,on the surface,at least,the life of an Orthodox Christian may seem somewhat boring since we are less and less interested in what the world considers to be fun,exiting and fashionable, and are more given to living a simple life,to prayer,meditation,contemplation,reading and generally,pondering on the things of God. (Not that we don&apos;t do other things or even,the same things that others do,but we tend to LOOK at those things in a different light than most people.) (That desk will come in handy,though, for stacking up all of the many texts you must first familiarize yourself with...)

Of course,none of that really fits for you,necessarily,because you were pretty much like that already,as far as I can tell... Like I said,I&apos;m just dabbling here. These are just the first things that came to mind.

With a few exceptions, we interpreted this dream pretty much alike, therefore I thought it interesting - also the way the mind assimilates things subjectively and presents such in code.

Debby Reynolds as the&quot;perfect housewife&quot;ordering things for an imperfect not-housewife, the first impression the large TV screen and attention demanding metallic clanging.

Though necessary, I tend to negate the rational mind in term of ratio given by the world at large, which changes almost daily and to me, a dreamer and hopeless romantic and delighting in the loftier regions, is utterly boring and superfluous confusion, as is what I say, really.

In addition to how you interpret the plain and drap furniture, they were also wooden, old and massive, an enduring and monumental body of Knowledge held forth by Orthodoxy, I can say, and the massive desk was for me to work on, read, learn, and write, I thought.

You forgot the two remaining 22&quot;TV screens, the &apos;normal&apos; one here before me always visible, akin to the instrument brain, below, and the appearing/disappearing other depending on my heads tilt, emitting iridescent light flashes, above, though I&apos;m given to incandescent love, for poetic rhyme, as that which is above is like that which is below, Hermes ne&apos;er to be doubted.

It is a beautiful sunny day for Hobo&apos;s living in tents by the freeway entrances, and when traffic permits I stop with water or wine and sit awhile listening to Hobo Wisdom coming away rather at times exceedingly joyful at my good fortune, thank God.

I shall find out if Papadia Sandra is back from vacationing and tend to the things that matter.

My family and I are very fortunate when it comes to our financial situation,although not independently wealthy,we are very well provided for compared to many others less fortunate than we are.

I am always cautioning my wife and children,however,not to be too attached or dependent on all that we have been blessed with because there is no guarantee that it will always be so. It could all change in a moment from who knows what kind of unforeseen events? The thing is to remember to be grateful for what we have been given and to have faith in Divine providence,to trust that God will provide all things needful for our complete salvation regardless of what our outward circumstances might be,whether that be living in a mansion or in a cardboard box next to the freeway.

I am looking forward to your conversation with Papadia Sandra.

It is easier living in the material world when finances are sufficient and I am grateful, in fact, for many years I have been thanking God in his Wisdom for what I have and don&apos;t have. It is true also that as far back I can remember I had Faith in Divine Providence, giving my clothes away etc., much to my Mother&apos;s dismay, though it was more of a not caring about it, a sort of innate trust in Divine Providence, which term was alien to me. This natural trust stayed with me to this day, and when my children, and my family in Germany, ask what I am going to do about and take care of this and the other, I say God will take of it. That then irritates both, worrying for me, and I have to point out the obvious, &apos;look, it has worked all my life&apos;, to which they have no argument and look away: &apos;it&apos;s useless, she will not listen and never be responsible&apos;.

It leads me to believe that I was reborn as a Christian of former times. I think Fr. Aquaro was somewhat surprised as well as pleased, looking me straight in the eye with a smile when I touched upon my personal relationship with God, which includes my work.

I also was given to, and wrote Poetry as a child, mainly to my Father whom I saw then as &apos;not from around here&apos;, and since I met Fern who introduced me to Francis Bacon, and by now sufficiently acquainted with the great Man, I can say with Kierkegaard,&quot;I always stand in an altogether poetical relationship to my work ....&quot;Even more so, the whole of my Being is suffused by Divine Poetry, at times with the madness of Hamlet, at times in the state of Melancholy, in which the highest expression of Poetry comes forth, I heard on the radio the other day.

I have not been able to reach Papadia Sandra but am sure the Lady will be back next week.

As to thy work, you forgive me, applying Kierkegaar&apos;s words:

&quot;The way, the perfect way of making others rich is to communicate the goods of the spirit, being oneself, moreover, solely employed in acquiring and possessing these goods.&quot;

Thank you also for the Songs conveying aforementioned Hobo Wisdom and steadfastness.

A sunny day to you and everyone

Dear Charlotte,

Bravo for your faith in Divine providence!

In the Gospel it reads:&quot;Seek ye FIRST the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness and ALL ELSE shall be added unto you,&quot;not the other way around... and thank you for your kind words from Kierkergaard.

His quote is very appropriate for today-The Feast of Sts.Peter and Paul-the two pre-eminent Apostles whose work,along with all the other Apostles, has drawn the whole world into Christ&apos;s net.

Speaking of 2012...(I seem to remember that&apos;s where we began all this...) Here is the guy I first heard about the idea of 2012 and what was going to happen then when I was 23yrs old. That was 30 yrs ago now and,back then,2012 seemed like a long time off!

Terrance Mckenna

I could listen to him talk all day.

Three things I have to say about 2012: The first is somewhat obvious to anyone&quot;In the know.&quot;and that is that the 2012 event, is scheduled for December 21st 2012, NOT new years eve 2012,as,I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if some of the mass media reported it as.

Secondly, 2012 will NOT be the&quot;End of the world&quot;as many are styling it,but rather,the BEGINNING of the world. All of history, from the conception of the universe until 2012, is like the nine months a baby spends in the womb before it is born.

And thirdly, as far as I&apos;m concerned,It&apos;s too good to be true that all this will take place by 2012! It could...but I&apos;m afraid that this world will drag on longer than that!

What I DO know is that,live or die before then,I WILL participate in that 2012 event,no matter when it actually takes place.

(The sooner the better,as far as I&apos;m concerned, but,perhaps that would be unfair to all those who have yet to wake up from the amnesiac spell we have all been placed under?)

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jul 14, 2009, 8:22am

In full I understand Makenna&apos;s meaning. I only had time to listened to the first link because the cable company upgraded and I had no connection, 2, it is very hot and we have to start work early in exchange for coming home early.

I also agree that the transition will take longer and that there is, and never has been an abrupt &apos;cut off&apos; from one cycle to the next, the end of one being the beginning of the next, but a Gurdijeff&quot;shock&quot;of remembrance is necessary. Another earthquake shocked me out of sleep, out of a dream actually, last night.

I do hope you WILL to be fair.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Jul 14, 2009, 1:21pm

The only difference here being that,with the&quot;2012 event,&quot;it&apos;s not a transition from one cycle to the next,but THE END OF ALL CYCLES, a doorway into ANOTHER KIND OF REALITY altogether,outside of time/space and the laws of physics entirely. A radical departure from the world we have become familiar with into a reality where,&quot;Whatever we INTEND comes into being INSTANTANEOUSLY.&quot;

As radical a transition as from the womb into the outside world. A transition that,when it does take place,will take place,&quot;In a moment,in the twinkling of an eye.&quot;

1st Corinthians 15:51-52

and also- 2nd Peter 3:9-13

Here indeed is the penultimate spiritual practice-to continually&quot;Watch and Pray.&quot;

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jul 14, 2009, 6:41pm

Truly, I had not expected such a radical change but have been reading all, have been and observe, sense and accept it, and yes, pray. In fact, I focus on this other kind of Reality first thing in the morning and am drawn toward it, sometimes stronger, as it this moment, when distracted, lesser. In contemplative thinking my mind soars again and again to understanding and in this wider Realm is another Revelation.

We had a good day at work, just this moment a Lady called from Palm Springs but I&apos;m not going there, the battery in my modem is blinking so I have to reinstall it and so much for my mundane life.

I also called the office of Bishop Maxim again, no luck, so I&apos;ll call tomorrow morning. In any case, I will be in Alhambra early this coming Sunday.

Listening to McKenna and the graph of up&apos;s and down&apos;s of World Events reminded me of the demoting of Pluto, which Planet Mr. Hall called the&quot;Planet of Capitalism&quot;. The fall of Capitalism began with the Enron collapse in 2002, &apos;Bank failures&apos; followed and keep going down into Hades. Pluto lost his Planet status in 2006.

Interestingly enough, McKenna also mentiones Gorbachev who for a moment in time appeared like a Ray of Hope for the People of the Soviet Union, and on the World Scene, then disappeared in a relatively short time, it seemed to me. In a picture of the Gentleman I cut from a newspaper, he sits behind a desk in deep thought, the &apos;map&apos; of North America with the Hawaiian Islands on his forehead (with little imagination), his fingers overlaping, his thumbs forming a pyramid, the profound expression on his face intimating that &apos;he was not from around there&apos;, my reason for cutting out the picture.

There is a lack of consciousness in the World, says McKenna, perhaps conscious awareness would be a minor qualification. If it wasn&apos;t for the 70s and Hippy&apos;s we wouldn&apos;t even have the little we do now, methinks, for they jolted America out of its stuper and turned it upside down, and the World followed, more or less.

Our night the shadow of a transient earth,
And we are substance of her nighted flesh,
Dark virgin, ever fair, who brings to birth
The brood herself devours and bears afresh.
Yet nothing does she reck of night or morning,
Whose orb entire is Light Supernal&apos;s bride,
And to her heavenly Lord is ever turning
Her orient face no mortal moon may hide.
So we are darkened by our mould&apos;s projection,
And live in glimpses of a nightless day,
Until Love&apos;s sun fires out our imperfection,
And draws this sphery soul from shapeless clay.

Incarnate love, of Love divine the model:
Help me to fly, who taught me first to toddle.

Dear Charlotte,
Barbara,my wife,just spoke with Papadia Sandra on the telephone,(Something about the bookstore Barbara will be running at our new Church building here,soon...)

So I got on the phone and asked her if His Grace Bishop Maxim would be serving at St.Stephen&apos;s this Sunday and,as it turns out,he is. I mentioned that I thought you had mentioned that you were planning on being there then? was I correct?

Papadia Sandra said she would look for you and was looking forward to meeting you.

I hope it all works out well!

Best Wishes till then,

Yes, I will be at St. Stephen&apos;s early tomorrow morning, many thanks for your continuing and valued mediation.

Imminentize the Eschaton

Meantime, I have not been idle but have gathered such words and sentences you wrote prior, printed Icons, passages, and general information on Saints and Prophets I thought helpful to increase my Heart&apos;s perception toward Wisdom. I learned more of John the Baptist, with wings, and horizonless were my insights and understanding....

I will not work the coming week, rather surround myself with these images/windows in my 4 walls being my Chrysalis in the darkness of the very early morning hours until the noise of the day is too loud. By repetition, Key words and phrases will become my constant, living companions on the Royal Road to the Kingdom. The watching and praying is oft with me.

So now I faces the world without, bank, food shopping etc.

A good weekend to you and yours, and the Reader

Post by charlotte on Jul 19, 2009, 6:00pm

I hope your Daughter Elizabeth had a good name day, to be named after such a great Lady is truly honourable. When I read such inspiring stories I always feel very selfish, reminding me to do better. We had &apos;Nameday&quot;where I grew up, but I think the tradition has been largely deserted by the people, maybe not by the Church.

The Liturgy at St. Stephen&apos;s was more wonderful than any other I had attended thus far in all Churches, it seemed to me, perhaps because I haven&apos;t been there and/or my activities the past week have drawn me closer. The two tone singing especially rich in melody and as I stood there the atmosphere in the Church changed and it and the Icons were as if alive conveying &apos;welcome&apos;, even though I looked at none of the Icons I saw them all. I could even open my mouth and join in a few words of singing. This profound experience gave me the courage to walk up and kiss the cross and receive the blessed bread, awkward though I felt.

Once outside I found Papadia Sandra and we spoke for a few minutes. The Lady said to keep doing what I&apos;m doing and call her huh when I had questions, or perhaps make an appointment with a Priest at some point. For the time being I have two books and material I have gathered, and a very knowledgable in Orthodoxy Guide.

The Lady apologized for things being a bit hectic today and gave me a big hug, &apos;hope to see you next week&apos;.

All things considered I apparently belong at St. Stephen&apos;s.

Post by renwdimgink on Jul 19, 2009, 10:54pm

Dear Charlotte,
I am glad that you had such a good experience! I was praying hard for you during services and had enlisted a few others to pray for you as well. Everything all together inside of Church is meant to be an Icon of Paradise which conveys to us a foretaste of the Kingdom of Heaven.

Did the Bishop serve? I thought he was supposed to,but you never know when he might be called away...

Here are some paintings that I really like and a famous Icon of the Holy Trinity by Rublev.

Hallo Steven,

Yes, I actually had the same experience, though quite vague, on my first visit. Aside from the beauty of the Church, I think it was this drawing me back.

Yes, Bishop Maxim served, as his Grace gave me the Blessed Bread, he was speaking casually to a man beside him about his family.

Thank you for the Icons, the third link shows a pretty girl, but I found the &apos;Trinity&apos; by Rublev and read up on it. Among other things, the article states,&quot;every paint-stroke has a meaning hallowed by centuries of prayer.&quot;Though not as quoted, I heard this many years ago and and remembered when looking at Icons.

Post by renwdimgink on Jul 21, 2009, 1:31pm

At the risk of repeating myself,I will state here what I believe to be the central focus of our life as Orthodox Christians:

We were originally created to be like God,to share an intimate awareness of our essential oneness with God.

We have inherited the loss of our likeness to God.

There has never been a more catastrophic event in our lives as human beings than the loss of our likeness to God.

There is no priority more pressing in our lives than the need for us to regain our lost likeness to God.

Until we feel the loss of our likeness to God as acutely as,for example,someone who has lost a leg or an arm feels a phantom limb they have lost,Orthodoxy cannot do for us all that it is otherwise intended to do.

The worst malady we can suffer is to grow complacent about our present state and to consider it,&quot;Par for the course,&quot;and anything more an unnecessary extra-curricular activity.

If we have any question about what we are missing or what it would be like to be&quot;Like&quot;God, all we have to do is look at Jesus.

Jesus IS God who became incarnate for our sakes, not only to help us to regain our original blessed state,but to provide for us an example of what that would be like.

Jesus is the new Adam,the prototype for humanity and the first-born among many brethren.

Every moment of every day we have to be able to remember how far we have fallen short of our ideal, while at the same time,remembering how great our true potential is.

With this central focus in mind, the entire Orthodox way of life begins to make perfect sense,it all hangs together, is oriented in the proper direction and can work for us in the way it is meant to. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jul 21, 2009, 6:10pm

Thank you for reiterating important points. I have not forgotten, I remember when I work, drive, take a shower, cook, etc., sit on the computer, said Icon in front of me. I can say truly, that it didn&apos;t take long at all before Orthodoxy became part of my Life to the degree I know about it. It is because everything I read makes sense to me, and as I said before, my prior studies are very helpful in understanding, also in the greater scheme of things. My predisposition is also conducive, why this is I don&apos;t know but it is natural.

Though I&apos;m not living the Orthodox life as long time Parisheners do, actually, I don&apos;t know how their everyday lives are lived, but I do see how&quot;it all hangs together, is oriented in the proper direction and can work for us in the way it is meant to.&quot;

I see this from the scanty reading I have done, don&apos;t mean to sound like a know-it-all, but insist I know to a certain degree, and I do strive to regain my likeness to God. Don&apos;t want to give all my secrets openly, but &apos;Lord have Mercy&apos; has become a chant.

So far I have not been able to disagree with anything you wrote, or I read or heard, in fact I nod &apos;Ja&apos; that&apos;s true, and you know unless we Germans say it&apos;s true, it isn&apos;t. Can I make a 

I read Rublev&apos;s inspiring life story, have quite a few Icons now to surround myself with, the eyes looking one directly in the eye cannot be missed, a check and total interruption of what one is thinking or doing, and yes it works, I feel like I&apos;m on the Orthodox Pollen Path, and walking.

Thank you Steven

Excellent! I e-mailed that last post to my children and they really liked it too. (How&apos;s that for living in the modern world...e-mailing my children who still live at home with me in the same house?!!!)

Here is another one of my favorite melancholy songs that I can&apos;t remember if I put in with the other batch:

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IwYQ1Vqf_4&amp;feature;=related 

You have written a profound and meaningful thing here-&quot;Though I&apos;m not living the Orthodox life as long time parishioners do,actually,I don&apos;t know how their everyday lives are lived...&quot;

This is a question that most parishioners do not stop to ask themselves,especially here in America,&quot;If we believe these things to be true,how then shall we live?&quot;

Formerly,in Orthodox nations,this was not such a big question as the entire culture was centered around the Church, (unfortunately,those nations and their cultures were overrun by the moslems,several world wars and revolutions and the international bankers and globalist monopolists, or they could have provided a shinning light for western civilization to follow...)

Here in America,however,an Orthodox way of life would necessarily have to be swimming against the current! If we do not continue to examine this question closely,we will be swept out to sea and drowned by the prevailing zeitgiest.

Conserning living the life, Fr Aquaro had a few announcements to make at one time after the Holy Liturgy, and appologized,&quot;I know everyone is trying to get out of here ....&quot;

Where I grew up life pretty much centered around the Church, at least it was considered in planing many things, viz., I can&apos;t do this because I have to go to Church, etc., and the Bells were reminders not only to go to Church, but when it was Vesper time, in this case the evening meal, and us children made sure we were home before they stopped ringing.

I think it easier not having to swim against the current when alone, not having all sorts of family obligations, and the prevailing Zeitgeist geistert mostly by me. I have read quite a bit and the language itself has a pretty strong current/currency carrying one safely along. The interwoven history gives perspective of time and events, and finding mention such as the &apos;Silver Cord&apos; is wonderful because I learned about it in Occult Anatomy, Man the Microcosm, also written about in Orthodox Literature.

O.K. Back to business! I recommend that you call Papadia Sandra and ask her if you may make an appointment with her husband,Fr.Nick to ask him if you may be blessed to become a catecumen.

After you have been blessed to be a catacumen you will have the whole Church praying for you at every Liturgy.

Let&apos;s see what Fr.Nick has to say about all this.

I just got some really good news! One of my earlier efforts,a guy who was a cook in a restaurant we worked in together in Maui who ended up getting Baptized into the Church, has been living on the Big Island for the last five years or so,is planning on getting married in the Church out there.

Looks like I&apos;m going to have to do plenty of traveling, L.A. for a Baptism,Hawaii for a wedding. This Evangelical work sure is tough! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jul 23, 2009, 3:31pm

You read my mind for this is what I planned to do today, thinking last evening to not work for a while and start the process in earnest with precise instructions. I had the feeling Papadia Sandra didn&apos;t think I was all that serious after I told the Lady that I was a Newcomer, saying there were such two other persons who have been coming to the Church for month just sitting in the back listening.

I&apos;m glad for your good news, I have visited Maui some years ago on a spontaneous decision, ie, leaving work for home, calling for a ticket, taking a shower and off I went landing in Honolulu. I thought I was back in LA, was irritated, had a cocktail, went to the desk to book a flight to Maui. In the fancy Hotel I lodged was a Jewelry Shop in which I purchased a ring, a semi-precious stone layed in and a diamond on an extended &apos;arm&apos;, which looked like a star, therefore I called it my Jesus ring, I would have you quietly know.

I simply must tell this story now, in short. After that, at the urging of a friend that I should go to a meeting because I would win something, and I said repeatedly I didn&apos;t want to, and in any case where did he come up with this silly idea, but he persuaded me to go and I won a trip to Hawaii.

There, I remembered my Sisters Birthday and thought I would send her a Lay of the fragrant Plumera, but it was illegal for stores to do so. I bought a Lay, a flat box, gift paper, some tape, and went to a bench in the open space of a large Shopping Mall. I opened the box, looked at the tape and thought &apos;I need some water&apos;, it rained just long enough to tape the box itself together. I had this wonderful, undefinable feeling I mentioned before, looked up and thanked God for the rain.

Carefully, I lined the box with the tissue paper, nestling the Lay in it, looked up and said &apos;I need a little more rain, please God, and you guessed it, it rained again just long enough for me to seal the box. By now I was really high because the marvelous feeling had intensified and I sort of made myself invisible for no one to notice and disturb my surroundings. After the feeling had &apos;Petered out&apos; I found a post office and maled the box and spend the rest of the day on the beach semi high.

Back in LA, a few weeks later I received a letter from my Sister, thanking me for the Lay, the best gift and all excited because it arrived on her WEDDING DAY, of which I knew not.

Whatever one may think, no one in this World could ever convince me that from the apparently silly idea in the beginning, to winning, to what followed was not a prepackaged event by Divinity for my Sister&apos;s Happiness and my benefit of actually experiencing how &apos;it does work&apos; in everyday life. I have another story about Lanai but can&apos;t tell it yet.

I shall devote myself to study so as not be too long before my Baptism and interfere too much with your plans. Mt. Haleakala is worth a visit.

A Quartet of diverse sound and lyrics, interesting drawing of the Moon as well. America is in a sad state indeed, last evening the Earth sort of shuddered again, twice, and woke me up from sleeping.

I finally reached Papadia Sandra today and asked if I could have an appointment, a blessing to become a catecumen, and specific instructions of how I should proceed. The Lady said she was just on her way to see Father Norman Kosanovich and will give the Priest my Phone No to schedule a date and time. I have not heard back yet, perhapst tomorrow, in any event I will at the Church again Sunday.

Generally speaking, California, Washington, and Oregon would break away together, more or less, as these States were not originally part of the North American Continent, but of Lemuria, the same size or bigger than the Continent. Montana and Canada would also be rocked magnitude 9-10 on the Richter (Judge) scale, so don&apos;t feel to safe up there, it&apos;s six of....

In a tremendous Cataclysm I don&apos;t remember when, Lemuria collided with the Rocky Mountains, which was then the West Coast of the Continent, the land rose and that part which is now the great valley drained, the inland Salt Lake remained. So above noted States, the Sierras and Cascades, the latter peaks of Lemuria, are remants of Lemuria. Hence you have the Mystery of Mt. Shasta and all, I wrote in detail about on the&quot;Atlantis&quot;thread some years ago.

The collision of the two Continents you can see at the end of Dr. Dolittle (Rex Harrison and Samantha Egger), where the Continent, here gradually, merges with the Island of Shakespeare the 10th, even the two halves of a split apart tree join perfectly. The only thing Dr. Dolittle brings with him is a stack of huge books and potted Roses and Germainiums, as he calls them.

The above information comes from the Rosicrucians, who assert that Francis Bacon was the first to research the history of the lost Continents of Atlantis and Lemuria, and if you watch carefully the beginning of the movie you can see that Dr. Dolittle represents Francis who is Shakespeare. That Francis and Shakespeare are involved you can tell by the Circus Lama from Tibet, named&quot;Push Me - Pull You&quot;, connoting the Bacon/Shakespeare Controversy. Hollywood isn&apos;t all Tinsletown. Sorry, couldn&apos;t help it, maybe it isn&apos;t so far off topic, earthquakes and vulcanic erruptions and all.

As concerns&quot;The Secrets of the Universe&quot;, it was a very good Sunday. I saturated my mind with the golden sentences here on this thread and will do so untill they become First Nature. I watched the Sun rise, and though in the city, I thought and imagined

Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
Gilding pale stream with heavenly alchemy....

I was at St. Stephen&apos;s at 9:00, and not one minute in the Church before bells began to ring for the first of three times. I remembered when I helped the Mesmer ring the bells, flying up on the rope. It was wonderful, as was the singing of a few girls and Lady&apos;s in the beginning.

I heard marvelous words, and of Wisdom, and the Cup of Wisdom throughout the hour before the Divine Liturgy, and understood why it is called Divine. Both Father Ceko, who served, and another Priest whose name I don&apos;t yet know, speak distinctly and with a powerful voice and I understood why the Church is called a&quot;Spiritual Forcing House&quot;, part of which, it seemed to me, was standing almost 2 hours on the same spot, besides bringing up long forgotten chaff by word and sound forcing it passed the head, so to speak.

Father Ceko told the story of the two blind man, the importance of FAITH, the possessed man, and of a dwarf who was told to daily water a dry piece of wood in the desert. He had a long ways to go to the well but performed his duty obediently, and in three years all were invited to eat the fruits from a seemingly impossible feat to make a dry piece of wood take roots, grow in the desert and bear fruits. The lesson of obedience to the Churches Teachings according to the experiences over centuries of the Holy Fathers and Teachers, who were also honored today. There was much more, it was a very good Sunday, and I hope all is well.

I love that story about St.John the Dwarf, My children will attest to the fact that I&apos;ve told it to them many times...Now,when they ask me,&quot;Why do I have to do ...&quot;Whatever it is I&apos;ve just asked them to do...(Wash the dishes,take out the garbage,etc.) All I have to say is,&quot;Because of St.John the Dwarf!

Here is a link I found which begins with that story and then continues with many of his sayings:

Which is older, the understanding or the book?

If we wouldn&apos;t suffer from amnesia we would understand all things, books facilitate understanding, but true understanding is experience distilled.

What wisdom I have, pitiful.... I haven&apos;t even began to toddle. Great site, it is truly amazing how how much Orthodox &apos;stuff&apos; is on the web. Maybe I don&apos;t need a Hummer after all, but you would probably disagree and I can also see why.

&quot;The Orthodox Christian makes (his) judgement on the basis of neither abstract theories nor his own limited, individual experience, but upon the corporate experience of the Church.&quot;

The thought of our compound human nature and countless accretions, and from those trillions more formed, and trillions more accrued indididually and collectively each day from all the rubbish going round, is even more pitiful, and the only way to survive is to live in it but not be of it.

The story of the forgetful Basket Weaver made me laugh,&quot;weaving....camel....weaving....camel.... I could see him walking back and forth, makes me laugh again....

When the Church in Rome began to step away from Orthodoxy in the 800&apos;s and then,finally,excommunicated the whole rest of the Church in 1065,initiating the roman catholic church, it rang the death knell for western civilization before it even had a chance to get off the ground.

Western civilization was formed on false premises which could only end up reaching the wrong conclusions.

Even the greatest minds of western civilization, such as your dear Sir Francis Bacon, had no choice but to reject the spurious forms of Christianity which had been presented to them, and reach back to pre-Christian truths to find meaning in an increasingly materialistic/secular/humanistic culture that was beginning to form as a reaction away from unpalatable examples of a&quot;so called&quot;Christianity that was at war with itself.

Unfortunately,the west was cut-off in every way,politically,geographically,linguistically,from where genuine Orthodoxy still existed,(Which was at the time,busy trying to defend itself from the encroaching Moslem Empire...) And ended up throwing out the baby with the bathwater.

Little did they realize that someone like St.John the Dwarf existed or that his simple sayings could contain such profound truths, truths they believed could only be found in the far off mystic east,remnants from the lost civilizations of old.

The incredible thing is that the Orthodox Church,even though it has gone virtually unnoticed all this time, has been able to preserve and hand down a genuine form of Christianity that still has the same meaning and power that it began with.

And,as you have just quoted, the authority of the Church doesn&apos;t rest on any one man or any abstract theory, but the&quot;Catholic&quot;consciousness of the entire Church. Catholic,in the true meaning of the word which is,universal.

The real miracle is that we, brought up in the poverty of what passes for thought in the modern world, have stumbled upon this ancient Tradition and have been able to GET IT!

Thank God! The seeds of Faith that were somehow left in our culture have been able to bear fruit. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Jul 28, 2009, 10:26am

My sixteen year old son is away from home for the first time and I am e-mailing him&quot;Helpful hints&quot;which I will copy here.

Here are the first two:

Helpful hint #1 : Faith isn&apos;t some kind of wishful thinking which keeps us going. It is a living connection to another reality which assures us,feeds,nourishes and informs us. Even if we feel far away from that other reality,faith is like a lifeline that we know we can follow to where we want to get to.

Helpful hint #2 : The Church is a good physician who prescribes certain remedies for the healing of our souls and bodies. Of these remedies,(for example; keeping the fast,saying our morning and evening prayers,the daily readings of the Epistles and Gospel,blessing our food before eating,receiving communion with a proper disposition,etc.) some are remedies for illnesses we already have, some are therapeutic and are intended to help us to regain certain faculties or abilities we have lost and others are purely preventative medicines to keep us from illness or harm. The more we co-operate with our physician and make use of the prescriptions given us,the healthier we will be. The more we disregard our physician the more difficult it will be for us to be healed or to be kept well.
The church wants to keep us from coming to harm,to heal our diseases and,ultimately,to restore entirely to us our lost&quot;Likeness&quot;to God, which,after all, is the whole reason we are here on earth at all.We have to guard ourselves from social pressures which would keep us from doing what our doctor has prescribed for us. It would be the utmost folly to throw obstacles in our own way simply because others around us do not necessarily understand or believe in what our doctor has prescribed for us! Do not underestimate the subtle pressure put upon us not only by others,but by ourselves,in order that we may&quot;fit in,&quot;be accepted and otherwise avoid the embarrassment of holding beliefs and practices which are different from those around us.
There is an unfortunate tendency in the world for people to want to bring others down to their own level. When,on the otherhand,despite the ridicule of others,someone holds to their own ideals,their adversaries can&apos;t help but have a grudging respect for them.

We have the opportunity,as Orthodox Christians, not only to regain our own health and well being, but to help alleviate the sufferings of others by making available and UNDERSTANDABLE what the Church prescribes for us. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jul 28, 2009, 7:38pm

If I were to think myself qualified I would say &apos;Beautiful!&apos;

Faith, the &apos;living connection to another reality which assures us, feeds, nourishes and informs us&apos;, I read once thus expressed,&quot;Faith is the evidence unseen&quot;, and I can embrace these definitians wholly, having lived by it, as said.

Faith and Hope are siblings, and I venture say that 99%, if not more, of Human Beings live by it in their own understanding, but always directed at God or a higher power. Every day millions of people encourage each other to have Faith and things will be ok, or&quot;let&apos;s hope&quot;it will be for the better. The pragraph in its wording brings another dimension to Faith, a lifeline the form-bound mind can grasp.

Hint #2 reminds me of the hour before the Divine Liturgy Sunday last. Aside from the few things I mentioned, and we reminded repeatedly,&quot;let us attend&quot;, so attending to the Ritual and listening to the words and how they were spoken, hearing marvelous things as I said, I became aware of a definate time honored or trodden path, and during this hour the Church was a Forcing House. Why? Because it was like cleansing a Dining Room, first sweeping the corners and floor and then washing all clean. It was during that time things came up I had long forgotten, minor relatively, and I said to myself &apos;Why are you thinking about those things when you&apos;re supposed to pay attention&apos;. But by the end they were gone and I can&apos;t remember what they were. This experience draws me even more to the Orthodox Church, besides never having heard such marvelous things which in my Heart I know to be true.

Fern taught me that the Soul responds when you hear the Truth and nobody can tell you it isn&apos;t so. And my Philosophy Teacher:&quot;There is a star-like structure in you and when you hear a Truth, it shines, the entire person shines, sometimes for days. Plato also affirms that the mind is flooded with Light upon real-izing a Truth.

Fitting in I never did, nor did I care to, in fact my one Sister and her Husband call me&quot;Kaoten Frau&quot;, half joking, sometimes with shades of insult and I nod. In my work too, most people think I&apos;m&quot;off the wall&quot;, but tolerate me because&quot;it&apos;s a free Country&quot;.

We mostly know what happend in Western Civilization at about 1000, until all the Great Ones came together at the Renaissance bringing Light, thanks to Plato and Hermes. Of the spurious forms of Christianity, Francis Bacon writes:

&quot;For it is strange to see, now in Europe, such high buildings as the Vatican and Escurial and others be, and yet scarce a very fair room in them.

&quot;The even carriage between the two factions proceedeth not always in moderation, but of a trueness of man&apos;s self, with an end to make use of both. Certainly in Italy, they hold it little suspect in popes, when they have often in the mouth Padre commune, and take it to be sign of one that meaneth to refer all to the greatness of his own house.&quot;

I know I wrote this before but can&apos;t pass up a chance to make known the Great Man&apos;s words.

Inspiring reading, thank you

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Jul 29, 2009, 11:35am

This is exactly what I said to my son Alexander before he left for his trip, that when we speak the truth to someone else it rings a bell in their soul and the soul thrills at hearing the truth being spoken. Which is how and why I do what I do. If not for that,all this evangelizing would be in vain. If we are just trying to convince others to believe our own ideas we would be wasting both ours and their time. Fortunately though,the soul recognizes and responds to an objective truth when it hears it!

And now I must compose helpful hint #3 which I will post here, thereafter:

On watchfulness and prayer

We,as human beings,have three common enemies which are trying to keep us from regaining our lost likeness to God: The world,( which masquerades as the be-all and end-all of life,) The flesh,( whose appetites have become disordered by the fall,) and The devil,( who envies our Divine Birthright and tries to rob us of it out of malice.)

These three enemies try to mislead us by suggesting to us courses of action contrary to our own best interests. These suggestions first appear at the very center of our being-our heart. Not the physical heart,but something deeper,the seat of our soul,a place in us where also,our conscience is to be found.

Our conscience is also known as,&quot;The eye of the heart.&quot;Every suggestion which seeks to motivate us to act in one way or another,must first pass the sentry at the door of our heart,which is our conscience. If the sentry is sleeping,or is drunk,or has abandoned his post altogether,anything can and will get in.

If we wish to be free from the ill effects of acting on evil suggestions and,ultimately,to regain our lost likeness to God, we must set a guard at the door of our heart and pay attention as it challenges each suggestion which attempts to enter.

&quot;Guard the eye of the heart from evil suggestions as you would guard your physical eye from a needle.&quot;

This practice of guarding the heart is known as,&quot;Watching,&quot;and is the first part of the Lord&apos;s commandment to us to,&quot;Watch and pray,lest you enter into temptation.&quot;Matthew 26:41

By watching we recognize the enemy who seeks entrance,by prayer we drive away and defeat our enemies. The Jesus prayer,&quot;Lord Jesus Christ,son of God,have mercy on me,a sinner!&quot;and by making the sign of the most precious and life-giving cross of the Lord, are our most powerful weapons in this unseen warfare. This prayer,when said with understanding,from the depths of heart,which is to say,really meaning it,dissolves evil suggestions as wax melts before a fire.

This same flame then fills our heart with warmth,light,life,love,peace of mind and a Divine sweetness which,once we have tasted it,we would never willingly trade for anything the world,the flesh or the devil seems to offer us. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Nativity

Immensity cloistered in thy dear womb,
Now leaves His well-belov&apos;d imprisonment,
There he hath made for Himself to his intent
Weak enough, now into the world to come;
But O, for thee, for Him, hath the inn no room?
Yet lay Him in this stall, and from the Orient,
Stars and wise men will travel to prevent
The effect of Herod&apos;s jealous general doom.
Seest thou, my soul, with thy faith&apos;s eyes, how He
Which fills all place, yet none holds him, doth lie?
Was not his pity toward thee woundrous high,
That would have need pitied by thee?
Kiss Him, and with him into Egypt go,
With his kind mother, who partakes thy woe.

On the Morning of Christ&apos;s Nativity
This is the month, and this the happy morn
Wherein the Son of Heav&apos;n&apos;s eternal King,
Of wedded Maid, and Virgin Mother born,
Our great redemption from above did bring;
For so the holy sages once did sing,
That he our deadly forfeit should release,
And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.

That glorious Form, that light unsufferable,
And that far-beaming blaze of Majesty,
Wherewith he want at Heav&apos;n&apos;s high council-table&apos;
To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,
He laid aside, and here with us to be,
Forsook the courts of everlasting day,
And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay.

Say Heav&apos;nly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein
Afford a present to the Infant God?
Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain
To welcome him to this his new abode,
Now while the heav&apos;n, by the Sun&apos;s team untrod,
Hath took no print of the approaching light,
And all the spangled host kept watch in squadrons bright?

See how from far upon the eastern road
The star-led wizard&apos;s haste with odours sweet:
O run, prevent them with thy humble ode,
And lay it lowly at his blessed feet;
Have thou the honour first thy Lord to greet,
And join thy voice unto the angel quire,
From out this secret altar touched with hallowed fire.

Amen.

In my doings this morning, I came upon the equivalent of the Rosary, Buddhists and Muslims pray with a similar string of beads, in Orthodoxy called

The Prayer Rope

&quot;Let us pause for a moment just to look at a little prayer rope, like this one made of black wool on Mt. Athos.&quot;

Picture here

 http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/comboschini.aspx 

&quot;It is a blessing from a holy place. Like so much that we have in the Church, it is a blessing prepared and given to us by a brother or father in Christ, a living witness to living tradition. It is black, the color of morning and sorrow, and this reminds us to be sober and serious in our lives. We are taught that repentant prayer, especially the Jesus Prayer, can bring us what the Holy Fathers call joy-creating sorrow -- in Greek Harmolipi&quot;. 

I am becoming acquainted with with the Greek terms of Orthodoxy, and like them as part of change in Mind.

&quot;And the tassel? Well, you can use it to wipe the tears away from your eyes, or if you have no teras, to remind you to weep because you cannot weep.&quot;

Reminds me of words in a song:&quot;Nothing is as bad as it feels and the hurt will always feel, just be thankful you can feel....&quot;

&quot;Besides, from the Old Testament times, little tassels have been a decoration for sacred vestments, a reminder of the sacred tradition in which we participate when we use the prayer rope.

&quot;Prayer ropes are made in keeping with a tradition whose origin is lost in antiquity. Perhaps one of the earliest forms was simply gathering small pebbles or seeds and moving them from one spot or container to another as one said his prayer rule or did his rule of bows and prostrations. The story is told of a monk who decided to make knots in a rope, which he could use in carrying out his daily rule of prayer. But the devil kept untying the knots he made in the rope, frustrating the poor monk&apos;s efforts. The an angel appeared and taught the monk a special kind of knot that consists of ties of interlocked crosses, and these knots the devil was unable to unravel.&quot;

Ropes and knots, and woven carpets with tassles are great Allegories, a&quot;great Knot who is within yesterday&quot;is mentione in the Egyptian&quot;Book of Coming Forth By Day&quot;, and one could think our memory is tied up in the Gordian Knot. Nowadays, people put a rubberband on the finger to remember something, I just put a book so I can&apos;t open the door....

Learning also that the hour before the Divine Liturgy is called&quot;Matins&quot;, and my &apos;Lord have Mercy Chant&apos;,&quot;The Petitions&quot;

Having not heard from St. Stephen&apos;s, I sent a brief e-mail to Papadia Sandra with a few words of my history which I thought was relevant to my request for an appoinment and intent of becoming a catacumen.

Greetings to All

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Jul 31, 2009, 12:04am

I never attend a service without my prayer rope and I will write to you some more about it&apos;s use on my next opportunity!

During prayers,I find that I can think of at least two or even,three things at once. This,rather than being some great ability I have,is a sign of how damaged and divided my mind is!

In other traditions the value of one-pointedness is well known. Jesus Himself says that,&quot;If thine eye be single,thy whole body will be filled with light,&quot;alluding to this. And in the Epistle of James we read,&quot;A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.&quot;

The Lord also says that,&quot;If we have faith the size of a grain of mustard seed we would say unto this mountain remove from here to yonder place and it would obey us and nothing would be impossible to us,&quot;speaking about both the knowledge of unseen realities and the power of holding one thought in the mind without distraction.

By using the prayer rope I find that by manipulating the knots with my fingers and occupying my mind with the Jesus prayer,I am actually able to pay attention to the service without my mind wandering off onto other things and that,if a third train of thought begins,it is usually about what I am hearing in the service at least.

Sometimes I lose track of the service and focus more on the Jesus prayer itself,but that&apos;s not so bad either!

It is said by the Fathers that the prayer rope can teach us all things and so has always been highly prized. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Only two days ago I listened to &apos;An der schnen Blauen Donau&apos; while making a cake because my Teacher Daughter and Family came to visit.

The Allman Brothers tune I remember, but never heard of Leo Kottke. Here is my thank you, in contrast a bit &apos;flotte&apos; as we say, the March ends every New Years Concert at the Opera House, Wien

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eab_eFtTKFs 

I too have problems concentrating, I do well at times however, and &apos;let us attend&apos; brings me back every time and I try to block all else out. Then there are those rare moments of being inspired. In the four Churches I have been, I have not seen anyone with a prayer rope, however I will purchase one for home. I wouldn&apos;t feel comfortable being the only one and a newcomer at that.

I read about The Holy Trinity, ever in the service.

&quot;God Himself is not absolute individuality, but perfect love and communion. Where there is self-contained individuality, there can be no love, for love means the total gift of oneself to another. True being is love, and where there is no love, there is only the absurdity of death and non-being.

&quot;This perfect communion of love is eternal. There was never a time when the Father did not begat His Son and breath forth His Spirit. In fact, the concept of time is inapplicable to God, because it is a created phenomenon. The Holy Trinity is eternal, beyond all of our created notions of time and space. To say, then, that God begets His Son and breathes fort His Spirit does not mean a temporal succession or change in God, Who is the same yesterday, today, and forever.&quot; 

Or&quot;God didn&apos;t step away from his Creation&quot;, and in The Egyptian Book of Coming Forth by Day,&quot;I am he who was yesterday, today, and forever.&quot;

Post by renwdimgink on Aug 1, 2009, 9:52am

His Grace Bishop Maxim goes to Belgrade often.I&apos;m sure he&apos;s been to that beautiful Cathedral. Perhaps we could go with him on a pilgrimage there sometime? I would love to!

Until then, here is Helpful hint #4: On the present moment

As Orthodox Christians we don&apos;t believe in the doctrine known as,&quot;Once saved,always saved,&quot;which is why we have the Sacrament of Confession,among other remedies for our sins.For us,our salvation is not a question of a decision we made when we first became Christians,or about what we plan to do in the future,but about choosing Christ RIGHT NOW in the present moment. And if we fall by choosing something other than Christ,thereby damaging our relationship with both Him and our hope for salvation,we repent and ask forgiveness in order to repair quickly what we have torn down,for it has been said,&quot;In what state I find you,you shall thus be judged.&quot;As Orthodox Christians we are called to be prepared at every moment to come face to face with God for judgment, at the end of the world or the moment of our death,whichever comes first.

This kind of understanding about the nature of salvation brings a real immediacy to our spiritual life.It not only keeps us from complacency and any sort of belief that it doesn&apos;t matter if we sin because we&apos;re already saved. It takes us beyond mere&quot;salvation&quot;to a continual abiding in the presence of God and a sharing in His Consciousness and Divine energies which leads us beyond salvation to Deification.

What a High Light of Life that would be - to go on a pilgrimage with His Grace Bishop Maxim to Belgrade, how could come this?Reminds me of going to Jerusalem to touch the Light. Just this morning I happened on St. Alban, and always pausing there, I read:

&quot;Actually, the only heart of the Church on Earth, the only heart of the world and of all History, is neither Canterbury nor Rome - nor Constantinopel or Moscow -- but Jerusalem. When this is properly understood, the seat or seats of government of the Church becomes of secondary importance.&quot;

And this, of course, brings the sublime Report of New Atlantis, Island of Bensalem, to mind. I am most happy that Jerusalem, New Jerusalem, and the Island of Bensalem are connected. Most happy, because it does not allow a &apos;fence&apos; to arise between what I am so centered in and the Orthodox Church.

Orthdoxy and Poetry

I slept, methinks, and awoke,
And, slowly gazing, found me stripped in sleep.

The Hound of Heaven (Francis Thomson 1859-1907)

I too wake up and gaze around me, but back into my dreams to stay some before all of it flees. A few days ago I dreamt that part of a long house had burned down and a Fireman poured gasoline on the smoldering ashes. Aghast, I looked at another Fireman and he said,&quot;it used to be a shoeshop&quot;. I looked at the section where the fire had stopped and saw the section full of shoes. I though it was an interesting dream.

I found a beautiful image of God, Creation and the Cosmos

 http://www.sobornost.org/ 

Now I can&apos;t stop thinking about Belgrade where I have never been. My Daughter M was in Prague and wished she could have stayed there for a year. On her visit three days ago, she asked me if I knew that Minerva was on the State Seal of California, that she was the Roman Goddess of Wisdom, who&quot;represents California because she sprang to life fully grown, just like California became a State without being first a territory&quot;, is the official version, and because California wasn&apos;t a territory before it became a State it is said the CA was&quot;motherless&quot;, and Minerva was made the mother. Someting like that. Arghh! I said, yes, I know, but prefer to call her Athena. This, mind we, with the winged Hermes, and on another an alchemical Lion symbol clearly visible on her shield. The poverty of our educational system cries to Heaven. We had another slight tremor this morning.

This song is playing in my mind, and I see 3 Wilbur&apos;s

The once saved, always saved doctrine never penetrated my Heart, and having the Holy Trinity clearly explained, partly posted yesterday, I understand what you write, and also salvation and sharing God&apos;s consciousness and eventual Deification. The ladder to Christ has many rungs and I&apos;ll hang on tight, regardless.

I read instructions of how to become a catecumen. Basically it is what I am doing daily, that I should visit an Orthodox Church, approach a Priest and convey my intentions, that the Church will appoint a fellow member of the Church to be my Godfather, and when the Priest and Godfather agree that I am ready, they will inform the Bishop, and with his approval I will be baptized. The process can take from six month to over a year, depending on the Priest evaluation. But huh, I sort of have a Godfather already, pardon me. I understand what you say and also love what you bring in peripherally, truly love the Greater Picture which I could not do without, not to mention our Rock and Roll and Classics, Groucho etc. No other person would be able to do this, and maybe it wouldn&apos;t bode well for me if I said,&quot;I already have a Godfather online.&quot;In my short conversations with Father Aquaro and Papadia Sandra I felt as if in Kindergarten regarding Orthodoxy, but not really I feel, I think more in Elementary School in the Round.

So tomorrow I will be at the Church at 8:30 latest, because last Sunday I missed Father Ceko on his way to the Church by 20 footsteps in the parking lot. It is my hope to meet and greet the Priest, or what if His Grace Bishop Maxim would walk my way? Surely my face would light up and I know the proper Address.

Vesper I attend at St. Matthew&apos;s, the street to it is named El Dorado, btw.

Eugenius Philalethes

&quot;Some alchemists fancy that the work from beginning to end is a mere idle intertainment; but those who make it so will reap what they have sown - nothing. We know that next to the Divine Blessing, and the discovery of the proper foundation, nothing is so important as unwearied industry and perseverance in this first operation.&quot;

Brings me back a decade or so to learning concerning the Emerald Table of Churam Telat Machasot, beloved Trice Greatest Hermes, the Universal Agent or Generative Force, who, like The Holy Trinity, is also One in Essence but Three in Aspect. I also learned apropos&quot;Mystical Christianity&quot;in Harmony with Orthodoxy.

It may be overly simple to say that am sorry to hear you had not a good day at work, I hope it wasn&apos;t physically, but mentally is equally painful, if not more.

So many things went through my head yesterday that my post was more of a rant, sometimes even a bit of humor or irony wants to creep in, but in the end, as the song goes, all my words come back to me and shades of mediocrity, and last night I was thinking that I should just eat my rice and wash my bowl, even so, as the Buddha would say &apos;I had a pleasant dream&apos;.

Indeed, there is much I have to know, I woke up feeling glumy as the sky itself is overcast and gray this morning, and listening to the songs have me even more melancholy and contemplative in which State the Poetry Lover is often, and in which State comes Wisdom, they say.

I hope you&apos;re having a very good day, the same I wish for the Reader.

Thank you.Yes,I was only metaphorically&quot;Beat up&quot;at work. I will get to your post in which there was much of interest. But first, here is helpful hint #5:

Orthodoxy:A personal relationship with the living God.

Orthodoxy is not a belief system,a set of rules to follow or some sort of magic formula. It is a personal relationship with the living God.

Like any relationship,we have to work on it to make it work.Most relationships are based on mutual respect.If anything happens to damage that sense of respect for each other,communication breaks down and there is a real possibility that the relationship will come to an end.This is particularly true in the case of a marriage.

For this reason,we have to be attentive to anything we do that might cause damage to our relationships,with each other and,especially,with our God and be sure to repair whatever damage we do at the earliest opportunity.

For an Orthodox Christian,it is understood that to be engaged in this struggle to maintain our relationship with God is a matter of utmost importance to us.It is a matter of our salvation itself. Even so,there is not much focus on the idea of,&quot;Salvation,&quot;in the Orthodox Church,not because it&apos;s not important,but because it&apos;s such a given. For the Orthodox,the focus is much moreso on Deification than on salvation because it presupposes that we are engaged in that struggle to maintain our relationship with god as the very bottom line of our spiritual life.

Unless we are actively engaged in the struggle to maintain our relationship with God,we can&apos;t even really consider ourselves to be Christians in the first place. It is only by keeping ourselves in relationship with God at all times that we may,&quot;Abide in Him and He in us,&quot;and thereby bear much fruit.

Yesterday, I glanced over some of my, regular pamphlets our Teacher (at the PRS) made for us on Spiritual Alchemy and Mystical Christianity, the &apos;dark night of the Soul&apos; by San Juan de la Cruz, Meister Eckhart etc., in tandam with occult anatomy, quantum physics and chemistry, he being a retired chemist, I metioned him before. A Jew he spoke perfect Hebrew, taught Kabala, Ancient Wisdom, on Masonry and the Rosicrucians, and Siegmund = the Victorious Speaker, is his middle name. It seemed as if there was nothing he didn&apos;t know, everything he said rang true, and when asked one time how he knew all these things, he said:&quot;I just do&quot;. The paragraphs I quoted from Bacon&apos;s New Atlantis were courtesy of his wife.

&apos;It is only by keeping ourselves in relationship with God at all times that we may,&quot;Abide in Him and He in us&quot;.

The Book is called &apos;Coming forth by Day&apos;,&quot;Thou art in me and I am in thee; and thy attributes are my attributes. I have entered in as a man of no understanding, and I shall come forth in the form of a strong Spirit, and I shall look upon my form which shall be that of men and women for ever and for ever.&quot;

It is a struggle to maintain a personal relationship with God, as Father Ceko also mentioned today, there being a thousand destractions. I really like Father Ceko, who greeted me at the door this morning with this bright smile, his own. During the Matins He invited everyone and also nodded to me, to &apos;Honor the Holy Gospel&apos;, this beautiful Book held by another Priest, so for the first time I kissed the Holy Book and it was one of those &apos;come and see&apos; and feel moments. It was very good. I find it helpful that every time I cross myself, to think I lay the cross upon myself, as I read. Father Ceko also presided over the Divine Liturgy.

Father Ceko, with his strong and clear voice, spoke about the five Loaf&apos;s of Bread and two fish multiplied by Jesus for the Multitude, and our physical and Spiritual nourishment.

As you know, pardon me, the Prophet Elijah was honered today:

&quot;O angelic of body, pillar of the prophets, and their cornerstone, the forerunner of the Second Coming of Christ, the venerable and glorious Elijah, you sent grace from on high to Elijah to dispel sicknesses and purify lepers. Wherefore, he overflows with healing to those who honor him.&quot;

Elijah&apos;s mantel then fell on Elisha. When reading Orthodox Scripture in earnest one can learn and begin to understand that it&quot;is not a belief system&quot;, and this can also be apprehended and by the by comprehended during the Matins and Divine Liturgy.

Mt. Carmel is mentioned in connection with Elijah, and this brought the thought of &apos;Carmel by the Sea&apos; here in California, south of San Francisco (and I love that song), close to where my son lives, a town where Artists, Poets, and Writers live and move and have their Being, where there is a&quot;Golden Bough Theater&quot;, Shakespeare is performed, and of course, Clint Eastwood was its Mayor almost two decades ago. Time flies.

Be encompassed ye Millions
&apos;Tis kiss for all the World!
Brethren, over the Canopy of Stars
Must dwell a Loving Father.
And when ye Millions plunge, within
Do you sense the Creator, World?
Seek him beyond the Starry Baldachin
He must live there above the Stars.

Beings Father Ceko and I were the only persons in the Church yesterday morning, I was afforded liberty to contemplate more paintings in the Church, and for a few minutes I did&quot;the four wild creatures like molten copper [burnished brass].&quot;The creature with the face of a man is an Angel in the Church, and the&quot;face of an eagle&quot;is an Eagle with upraised feathers looking directly at the Saint. The Lion and Ox are that.

Before entering the Church itself, which I think of ProNous, it may be called differently in Orthodoxy, to either side of the door are most beautiful Paintings covering the walls, and each Pillar has four pairs of the Double Eagle affixed at the square where the roundness ends. I love this Church.

Yes, it will all work out, thank you, and also for the link where I can read each day with the rest....

The account of the Venerable Simeon dancing in the streets with&quot;purpose&quot;, reminds me of those who&quot;traveled with purpose&quot;across Europe during and after Francis Bacon&apos;s time&quot;hanging around&quot;and frequenting the Royal Houses, I wrote about in the Shugborough thread. They were decried as useless vagabonds by those who didn&apos;t know their purpose. The difference being that St. Simeon is described as a&quot;clairvoyant wonderworker&quot;, to borrow your term for Saints,&quot;descerning all the inner secrets of men, both near and far&quot;, and was a Healer.

On a bussy intersection in Redondo Beach, close to where I live, there is a man day in and day out, totally covered with Jesus pictures and messages, as is his old Volkswagen Bus with Christmas Lights flashing and glittering tinsel, strings of flags, passages from the Bible written on cardboard, who cannot be missed. I will speak with him next time to hear what he has to say.

The vision of Ezekiel

&quot;The resurrection of the dead, the prophet, a miracle saw!

The bones rose up and bone next to bone lay

Then flesh, then sinews and the skin tightened,

At this miracle, the rerrified prophet gazed

And glorified God with his heart and soul.

What the prophet of God discerned in the spirit

The resurrected Lord clearly showed.&quot;

Fern told me once that there is a complete immortalizing of the body and I thought about how this could be. In speaking of such things, she also said:&quot;If Christ hadn&apos;t done that (sacrifice himself and risen) you wouldn&apos;t be here&quot;, but I didn&apos;t believe her.

As far as the,&quot;Complete Immortalizing of the body,&quot;goes,this is what all of this is being done and prepared for. Not just our bodies,but the entire physical elements married together inseparably to the Heavenly realms-the ultimate Alchemical wedding-may Heaven and Earth become one and the same-Thy Kingdom come,Thy will be done,in earth as it is in Heaven.

Jesus after the Resurrection gives just a hint of what this will be like.He had an entirely physical body-He had Thomas touch Him,He ate with the disciples,etc. and yet He could pass through locked doors...

Sri Aurobindo had an excellent grasp of this,&quot;Divinization of Matter,&quot;(too bad the only Christianity he was exposed to was the church of England.) There are two interesting books from his teachings about this subject:&quot;The mind of the cells&quot;and&quot;Jacob Atabet&quot;

All this refers back to my first post again where, whatever we Intend comes into being instantaneously in an entirely physical manner.&quot;Our inner state becomes our outer environment&quot;-not just,&quot;Spiritually&quot;but entirely physically.

This is also what I believe Terrance Mckenna&apos;s&quot;0 timewave of complete novelty&quot;is speaking about.

Instilling and remembering the or a&quot;living God&quot;is one of my doings in the morning. It is often mentioned in Orthodox writing, but the first note via Orthodoxy sounded:

&quot;We do not create in a vacuum, but co-cooperatively, all together and within the over-arching context of what God INTENDS into being, moment by moment. Thus, all of creation is an ever-flowing, interdependent, interrelated dance of beings and forces, an ongoing creative miracle at every intstant.&quot;

Listening to the birds I think of the wonder of Creation and this moment by moment re-creation. Thank you, Steven, also for the successive Helpful hints.

On August 4, I found, the Church is commemorating&quot;the Holy Seven Youths of Ephesus, the&quot;Seven Sleepers&quot;. One of them, to my delight, was St. Iamblichus, whose name I tranlated in my mind in German &apos;I am one who sees us&apos;. Blick =see, blicken=looking, durchblicken=understanding.

&quot;St. Iamblichus and the other six youths were sons of illustrious citizens of Ephesus. The young men were friends from childhood, and all were in military service together.

&quot;When the emperor Decius (249-251) arrived in Ephesus, he commanded all the citizens to offer sacrifice to the pagan gods. Torture and death awaited those who disobayed. Denounced by those currying the emperor,s favor, the seven youth of Ephesus were summond to reply to the charges. Appearing before the emperor, the saints confessed their faith in Christ.&quot;

After stripping them of&quot;their military belts and insignia&quot;, the emperor let them go free, they fled the city and&quot;hid in a cave on Mt. Ochlon, where they passed the time in prayer, preparing for martyrdom.

&quot;The Lord placed the saints in a miraculous sleep lasting almost two centuries - the Lord had kept them alive....&quot;, and here again is described what I wrote as a doubter of Fern&apos;s word, at the end of yesterday&apos;s post:

&quot;How can there be a resurrection of the dead when there will be neither soul nor body, since they are disintegrated? Others affirmed,&quot;The souls alone will have a restoration, since it would be impossible for bodies to arise and live after thousand years, when even their dust would not remain.&quot;Therefore, the Lord revealed the mystery of Resurrection of the Dead and of the future life through his seven saints.&quot;

The Seven Saints fell asleep again,&quot;this time until the General Resurrection.&quot;The rest of the interesting article

 http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintLife.asp?FSID=102197 

Beloved by all who knew him, Manly Palmer Hall, in his booklet

The Adepts

In The Esoteric Classical Tradition

&quot;Iamblichus was one of the diciples of Porphyry (who was a diciple of Plotinus, my note) and expanded his insight through the study of Pythagorean, Egyptian, and Chaldean disciplines. One of the most important writings of Porphyry was his work On Abstinence from Animal Food, written for such persons as hoped to attain enlightenment in the present embodiment.

&quot;Iamblichus (born c. 250, died c. 330) was the founder of the Syrian branch of Neoplatonism. He was accredited with having borrowed heavily from pagan sources. His distinction between the highest spiritual self and a mortal self contributed considerably to the concept of psychology as distinguished from mysticism. While Iamblichus must be included among the foremost members of the Neoplatonic association, he complicated the simple idealism of Plotinus.

&quot;Albert Pike in Magnum Opus notes that Iamblichus in De Mysteyiis, VIII, 4 writes:&quot;The Egyptians are far from ascribing all things to physical causes; i.e., Life and intellect they distinguish from physical being, both in man and in the universe . . . The wisdom recorded in the canonical rolls of Hermes quickly attained in this transendental lore, all that human curiosity can ever discover.

&quot;Neoplatonism sought to deliver the individual from the tyranny of his own intellect. This approach is clearly set forth in The Mystical Divinity of Dionysius the Areopagite and descends to us through St. John of the Cross, who wrote a poem on the super-essential radiance of the divine darkness. One verse will indicate the degree of mystical insight attained by St. John of the Cross--

 &quot;I knew not where I entered,
For, when I stood within,
Nor knowing where I was,
I heard great things.
What I heard I will not tell:
I was there as one who knew not,
All science transcending.&quot; 

&quot;IAMBLICHUS. From De Divinatione et Magics Praestigiis by J. Boissard, Oppenheim, 1615. Referring to Iamblichus, Thomas Taylor writes that the sage was not surpassed in theological science and equaled by few.&quot;Hence he was denominated by all succeeding Platonists &apos;the divine&apos; in the same manner as Plato, &apos;to whom,&apos; as the acute Emperor Julian remarks, &apos;he was posterior in time only, but not in genius.&apos;&quot;


On Neoplatonism, Mr. Hall writes:

&quot;The tendency in Neoplatonism is to recognize only one aspect of beauty. This felicity if the sight is the same everywhere and in everything. In every cause beauty is truth or reality and may be described as the natural and proper aspect of all external things which can be cognized by the sensory perceptions. Invisible beauty is the same as that which can be seen, for it arises from the perfection of all natures and substances. Love, truth, and wisdom are manifestations of beauty to the degree that the express the perfection of themselves. All perfect things are established in the sphere of divine reality, and their beauty diminishes as they depart from their source and descend into union with physical compounds. The love of beauty is therefore properly a religious experience, and the unity of human consciousness with its ineffable source is the consummation of life&apos;s journey.&quot;

I love this &apos;stuff&apos; and could go on until I can&apos;t sit any longer. All the truly Wise second the Teachings of the Orthodox Church, and this is one reason I love it.

Be well

After reading the links, half the pdf, and listening to McKenna, the content in my head began to spin, withal I thank you, as always.

&quot;Mind of the Cells&quot;is profound and resonates, though not in the immense scope it is presented.

I scribbled down a few words which didn&apos;t miss the mark:&quot;Before the samll lemur acquired binocular vision, which prepared ours....&quot;And,&quot;....the evolutionary breakthrough always reverts to the former state until the decisive appearance of the new species.&quot;It also reverts, partly, to the former state in the process to a new species.

&quot;Nothing is more invisible than the obvious that we don&apos;t see it.&quot;Closer than hands and feet....

&quot;It seems one can truly understand only when one understands with the body&quot;, the way this understanding came about, together with Jacob Atabet&apos;s &apos;knowledge&apos; is marvelous. I have to read again to have a paragraph of the gist of it in my mind.

&quot;It&apos;s something that is EVERYTHING, that contains its own truth&quot;I understand clearly for I have seen it, though not in the sense of the next quote.

&quot;For poetry, too, is a&quot;translation&quot;of that elusive other state that our species is yearning to grasp but does not know how.&quot;A resounding Yes, for Poetry sublime burst the Ring Pass Not and the mind/psyche finds affinity with the Divine.

&quot;As long as you cling to the capacity and knowledge of the old species, quite obviously you cannot become the new one - it creates an instant wall, the old glass wall of the fishbowl.&quot;So I&apos;m leaving home, but for the moment have to look through the glass now and then to stay steady.

To the metaphor of the birth process of McKenna, I would add that after hours of labor, when the actual birthing takes place, a wave of indiscribable tremendous pressure goes through her body over which she has absolutely no control, I mean none, she is utterly helpless when this wave takes hold of her, only at the end of each wave can she help the process marginally. So a new life or a new Reality will not be denied, regardless if we want it or not. It births itself when all necessary is said and done.

You oft mention the Grace of God pouring down at certain instances, so helpful is the explanation of the difference between Divine Grace and Essence of God. I read:

&quot;The essence of God is awesome and unapproachable for man&quot;;&quot;Never will man see my face and live&quot;.

&quot;Divine Grace is the energy of God. If God had only the divine essence - of which we cannot partake - and did not have His energies, He would remain a self-sufficient god, closed within himself and unable to communicate with his creatures.&quot;

Ringing true:

&quot;If man did not have the image of God in himself, he would not be able to seek its prototype.&quot;

Twice Indeed! And to all I read, Yes! And God bless St. John of Liverpool, who pushed the barriers and planted seeds. I wish we could take all the World along this &apos;Magical Mystery Tour&apos; we&apos;re on in search for the Grail because I know it is the true way to the Life.

My thank you, though I shall not die a devil

If,as the book of the same title suggests,Theosis is the true purpose of human life,not A purpose or something only really religious people do or a really interesting hobby,but THE purpose of human life,then,the question is,&quot;What have we,here during the development of western civilization,been doing for the last 1200 yrs?&quot;
 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Aug 6, 2009, 5:50pm

Every since the Catholic Church began to seperate itself about 1200 years ago from what was then just One Church, the fighting and killing began, the crimes against Humanity perpetrated by the Catholic Church began and persisted till the school days of my Mother, albeit their power waning, who told us about the cruelties she had to endure. The tale end of it in my school years. Remembering the Crusades and&quot;Dark Ages&quot;, the Light of the Apostolic Church, Egypt, and Greece having been turned off, the Templars murdered, and on it goes until the Florentine Renaissance ignited the Light once again.

The Muslims came along and wanted, and still do, pardon me, but this I heard&quot;unofficially&quot;from Muslim&apos;s I know for years, conquer the World in due time, so there were this dastardly wars and power struggle in Europe. And we know the state of affairs of the World today.

All the while however, countless Saints, Pious Men and Women, most of them murdered as well, guarded the True and Original Teachings, which I now know are the Treasure of Humanity held by the Orthodoc Church. I see it so aptly explained in all I read. Not to forget that the Bacon Lineage began with the Norman Knight Grimbaldus in 1066, the Minnesnger, the Legend of King Arthur to, among other things, lifting the Spirits and bring some gladness to the oppressed, misused and abused People, and countless more who fought and died for the Dignity of Man. Truly, as you wrote, Western Civilization never had a chance to tend to Theosis, which I meant to define yesterday, but then I read so many beautiful passages I want to communicate.

Theosis, described well in the wiki link, and emphasized in Orthodox Literature (books are a sort of &apos;forcing&apos; medium too), as the true purpose of human life, specifically, I was never told, nor have I heard anyone say so. The closest I came was, and that only via Philosophy, that each life was to take care of unfinished business from the last and gain experience on the Spiritual road to Enlightenment, so I lived to a good degree by &apos;as you sew so you reap&apos;, but the full weight of Theosis being the very purpose of Life was missing.

I still haven&apos;t read the second half of the pdf I find informative. I liked very much what I read of Jacob Atabat, the last part of this reminding me in a light-hearted way of you mentioning the diamond under the onion:

&quot;O God,&quot;I groaned, and the darkness turned to light. A ravishing vista appeared, a city of towers and diamond walkways in the sky. And Morris Sills again, chopping onions.&quot;The Egyptians put onions in the eyes of mummies, maybe the general idea was the same, as one has to cry when pealing and chopping onions to get to the diamond, so a good metaphor.

Another part I would like:&quot;Then an image of kas going forth, phantom bodies dressed in solar boats.&quot;The grateful dead,&quot;I whispered.&quot;I&apos;m floating with the grateful dead.&quot;There was nothing but darkness and this healing sensation.&quot;

It&apos;s easy to float with our Grateful Dead who took their name from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and the only band that ever played at Giza. I salute them!

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Aug 7, 2009, 10:04am

After my post, my mind was occupied with the movement of the Wisdom from Egypt, deriving theirs from a previous Civilization, where in Alexandria the Ibis headed Thoth Hermes was crested in the Libraries, which books, it is said, were used to keep the Light burning in the Lighthouse, and which Light shown hundred and some more miles out the Mediterranean toward the West, and also guide the ships safely &apos;home&apos; to the Harbor of Wisdom and the Land.

The Greeks,&quot;a youth of receptive mind&quot;, already learned in the Christian Mysteries as regards our subject, as the Apostles preached in the beginning of the first Century, kept the Light shining and brought it to Rome. Your question, Steven, about what we have been doing in the past 1200 years, after the Catholic Church took what it needed of this Wisdom to form their own version and drove the Saints underground or murdered them, I distincly remember my Philosophy Teacher saying that&quot;only one Man who called himself Dionysius the Areopagite, kept the Christian Mysteries safe, in secret.&quot;Why he said only one Man, I don&apos;t know.

As a side note, the painting by Raphael of the School of Athens is in the private quartes of the Pope, but never a word is said, or interpretation given to the Flock.

Besides what I touched on yesterday, thousands of Christians fled Rome to establish Communities mostly in the Campania between Rome and Naples, where Platinus planed to set up a Platonic Acadamy but died&quot;of a spiritual and social cold&quot;before he could realize his dream.

Marcilio Ficino also translated the works of Plotinus into Latin, published in 1492 when Christopher Columbus, Cristobal Colon meaning&quot;Christ-bearer&quot;and&quot;colonizer&quot;, set sails for the New World. The notion that he didn&apos;t know where he was headed can be dispelled by his words:&quot;Neither reason nor mathematics nor maps were of any use to me: fully accomplished were the words of Isaiah.&quot;

No one knows for sure when and where Columbus was born, but:&quot;He was steeped in astrology, the writings of Marco Polo, the Old and New Testament, and the Apocrypha. The mysterious figure was adept in the poetic language of the secret societies of the fifteenth century and, quite possibly, a member of the Great Guild of Weavers. Secret societies, such as the guilds, Knights Templars, the Rosicrucians, and the Masons were repositories for the ancient, sacred mystery teachings that were handed down to initiates throughout history.&quot;

The erudite Thomas Taylor translated the works of Plotinus into English. The&quot;Italian Renaissance philosophers, the 15th and 16th century humanists John Colet, Erasmus of Rotterdam, and Thomas More, the 17th century Cambridge Platonist, and German idealists, especially Hegel, Plotinus was the (sometimes unacknowledged) basis for opposition to the competing and increasingly influential tradition of scientific philosophy.&quot;Well, that&apos;s their opinion. There is a whole history behind this history.

Aside from people simply living the ordinary life, much was done by many for&quot;the real miracle&quot;the we&quot;have stumbled upon this ancient tradition&quot;, the preserving and handing down&quot;a genuine form of Christianity&quot;, and we&quot;have been able to GET IT!&quot;

Dionysius the Areopagite

 What is Hierarchy, and what the use of Hierarchy 

Hierarchy is, in my opinion, a holy order and
knowledge and activity which, so far as is
attainable, participates in the Divine
Likeness, and is lifted up to illuminations
given it from God, and correspondingly towards
the imitation of God.

Now the Beauty of God, being unific, good, and
the Source of all perfection, is wholly free from
dissimilarity, and bestows its own Light upon
each according to his merit; and in the most
divine Mysteries perfect them in accordance with
the unchangeable fashioning of those who are
being perfected harmoniously to Itself.

The aim of Hierarchy is the greatest possible
assimilation to and union with God, and by taking
Him as leader in all holy wisdom, to become like
Him, so far as is permitted, by contemplating
intently His most Divine Beauty. Also it molds
and perfects its participants in the holy image of
God like bright and spotless mirrors which
receive the Ray of the Supreme Deity -which is
the Source of Light; and being mystically filled
with the Gift of Light, it pours forth again
abundantly, according to Divine Law, upon
those below itself. For it is not lawful for those
who impart or participate in the holy Mysteries to
overpass the bounds of its sacred laws; nor must
they diviate from them if they seek to behold, as
far is alloed, that Deific Splendour and to be
transformed into the likeness of those Divine
Intelligences.

Therefore he who speaks of Hierarchy implies a
certain perfectly holy Order in the likeness of the
First Divine Beauty, ministering the sacred
mystery of its own illuminations in the hierarchical
order and wisdom, being in due measure
conformed to its own Principle.

For each of those who is allotted a place in the
Divine Order finds his perfection in being
uplifted, according to his capacity, toward the
Divine Likeness; and what is still more divine, he
becomes, as
the Scriputes say, a fellow worker with God, and
shows forth the Divine Activities revealed as far as
possible &apos;in himself. For the holy constitution of

A perfect quote by Dionysius the Areopogite !

When the roman church stepped away from Orthodoxy,this quality of genuine Christian wisdom was lost to the west and your dear philosophers and alchemists who formed the occult societies,were forced to look back to pre-Christian sources to find any trace of the light which had been lost to western christianity.

They did the best they could with what they had,trying to satisfy the innate hunger the soul has for Theosis. They had a sense of WHAT it was they hungered for,but,seemingly,not the means of ACCOMPLISHING it. (Since none of them did,that I know of anyway. And,if anyone did,it certainly didn&apos;t catch on enough to change the fate of western civilization...)

You and I know the occult history of the Renaissance, however,if you look at any high school text book on the subject,they will tell you,and I quote from my son&apos;s high school text book, that,&quot;The Renaissance was the time when people rejected the idea of living life as a preparation for an afterlife and began to live life for the sake of ourselves as human beings in this world alone.&quot;

Secular humanism and scientific materialism became the new religion. Ever since then,our entire culture has been based on the premise that we should make the most of our fallen nature for the sake of getting as much as we can out of our short life in this world.

As a result,we have developed,not a true culture,whose object would be to support it&apos;s citizens in accomplishing the&quot;One thing needful,&quot;while at the same time holding in honor all of life,but a virus,bent on destroying it&apos;s host,ourselves!

Not to mention: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB0bnT4QRIc&amp;NR;=1 

As Orthodox Christians,one of the first things we need to recognize is that our culture is not our friend.

Perhaps we can sow the seeds of a new underground culture based on the true purpose of human life?

Proof and references to your answer would be most appreciated.

And explain again if you would why it is you both seem to be drfiting away from Egyptian studies and into the fantasy world of an all powerful &apos;god&quot;taking an active interest in your lives.

Dear Don,
Forgive me! I thought this thread was countdown to Armageddon, not studies of ancient Egypt?

Charlotte and I thought that you had been following our train of thought,although not commenting.

We are taking as our Thesis that the true purpose of human life is Theosis,(or,in other words,&quot;The process whereby we regain our lost&quot;Likeness&quot;to God.&quot;)

Now,IF this is the case,that,we, (each of us ,including yourself,) are created in the Image AND the likeness of God,created to be like God,and have since inherited the loss of our&quot;Likeness&quot;to God, then it stands to reason that there can be no greater need or purpose in life than to regain that Likeness which is our Divine Birthright.

I say&quot;IF&quot;because,this is something each of us has to discover or decide for themselves,whether or not they conceive it to be true.

I decided it was true back when I was 14yrs old,which was a long time ago now,and it has been my guiding light ever since.(And I have no complaints.) You can ask my High School buddies,whom I am still in touch with,and they will tell you,I am the same crazy person I became suddenly back then,that I am today!

If it is true,that the true purpose of human life is Theosis,then it has somehow come to be ignored in our day and age and an underground culture is needed to bring it back to peoples attention! (Which is essentially what the Orthodox Church is,not only the vehicle by which this knowledge has been preserved and handed down,but&quot;The best kept secret in the western world.&quot;)

If you haven&apos;t already,I recommend this link which explains it all better than I can:

 http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/theosis-english.pdf 

As for Charlotte and her studies,she will have to speak for herself.

If we are correct in our thesis though,what she is engaged in studying presently is&quot;The one thing needful.&quot;

Wishing you all the best in all ways, Yours,
Steven

P.S. We were created to be like God,Don. And we&apos;re preparing to be ushered into another KIND of reality where,whatever we INTEND comes into being instantaneously. That&apos;s what the&quot;Secret of the universe&quot;is all about anyway. far as I can tell? Either I&apos;ve been really crazy for a long time now,or I&apos;m on to something. You&apos;ll have to decide for yourself which it is. All I can say is that,if I am crazy,it&apos;s a very pleasant form of madness which I wouldn&apos;t trade for the world!

Hallo Don,

I suspected as much, you yourself, pardon me, writing about Angelica&apos;s wedding:

&quot;The Royal Botanical gardens a world famous rock garden in Hamilton, Ontario. We have decided that this is where the outdoor ceremony will take place and I can&apos;t help but shake the nagging feeling it has all been set up for us by powers far beyond what I can even imagine.&quot;

I have not abandoned my studies, on the contrary, as you can see in my posts I am constantly reaching back to the Egyptians, Greeks, to both, the Florentine and English Renaissance, all participating Champions of Hermetic Philosophy, and to him who lives in my Mind, Heart, and Soul, Sir Francis Bacon, and as he would have it, now engage&quot;in studies of greater delight.&quot;

 It is man&apos;s function to contemplate the works of God
For this purpose was he made,
That he may view the Universe with wondering Awe
And come to know his Maker.
Hermes 

Behind all I have learned, and so scantily, from Teachers alive and in bookscan be seen what we are speaking of here. From Mr. Hall to Fern, to the wise and strange Lady living in the mountains I was led to by a TV show, and who led me to Mr. Hall, all Teachers at the PRS (Philosophical Research Society) harkened back to&quot;the Fatherhood of God&quot;and&quot;Sonhood of Christ&quot;, in Mr. Hall&apos;s words, as set forth in Scripture, embraced by the Gnostics, the Egyptians, and the Greek Philosophers, among others, only, it was never brought so clearly to my awareness before. Not to forget the Maya and Hopi, the later I wrote so much about, and who continually&quot;sing praises to the Creator from the mountain tops.&quot;

Above all, my Teachers esteemed Hermes, under whose umbrella they taught:

&quot;The student of Philosophy, undefiled, is dependent alone on devotion to God, all the rest is confirming patterns.&quot;

The Divine Pymander

Hermes to his Son Tat:

&quot;But God is the Father, and the Good, in being all things; for he both will be this and is it, and yet all this for himself (it is true) in him that can see it.

&quot;See how many arts in one Matter, and how many Works in one Superscription, and all exceedingly beautiful, and all done in measure, and yet all differing.

&quot;Who hath made all these things? What Mother? What Father? Save only God that is not manifest; that made all things by his own will.

&quot;And no man says that a statue or an image is made without a Carver or Painter, and was this Workman made without a Workman? O Great Blindness! O Great Impiety! O Great Ignorance!

&quot;For the things that are he hath made manifest, and the things that are not he hath hid in himself.

&quot;This is God that is better than any name; this is he that is secret; this is he that is most manifest; this is he who is to be seen by the Mind; this is he that is visible to the Eye;....&quot;

So it could be said, that Hermes is the&quot;Energy&quot;or&quot;Divine Grace&quot;of Orthodoxy, not God&apos;s&quot;Essence - of which we cannot partake&quot;, God would remain&quot;self-sufficient, closed within himself and unable to communicate with his creatures.&quot;This essence&quot;he hath hid in himself&quot;-&quot;this is he that is secret&quot;, says Hermes, the Divine Mind, through which we can find&quot;The One Precious Thing&quot;of the Emerald Tablet.

&quot;The Greeks&quot;, writes Hargrave Jennings, author of&quot;The Rosicrucians&quot;, in the introduction to &apos;The Divine Pymander&apos;, applied the name and term of Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus, so significant and suggestive, certainly to the Egyptian Thoth, as early as the fourth century B.C. He was believed to be the origin of everything formed or produced by the human mind.

 &quot;HERMES, the TRICE GREAT&quot; - discourses of the nature and order of the celestial beings; the populace of the elements; and herein he enunciates all the cabalistic notions of the ROSICRUCIANS.&quot;

These are but snippets, but we are in the midst of my studies.

Furthermore, &apos;The Divine Pymander&apos;, was&quot;translated formerly out of the Arabick into Greek, and thence into Latin and Dutch, and now out of the original (Arabic, my note) into English&quot;, by the&quot;Learned Divine Doctor Everard&quot;, published in London in 1650. Moreover:

&quot;The earliest Latin edition presently known is that Marsilius Ficinus 1471, reprinted Venice 1472.&quot;

How many historians are there who can truly appreciate the Mind of the&quot;Horuscopus&quot;who sparked the Renaissance with his translations of the Corpus Hermeticum, Plato, and Plotinus, the Divine Marsillius, as Thomas Taylor honores him. No surprise, then, that the elusive Hermes never really existed, he is too Great in all his Mysteries to even approach by most University educated Scholars, no disinfectant Sunlight here, all that is conjectured about Plato, confused writer of&quot;fiction&quot;, and other than in philosophical circles, Plotinus is not well known.

The rational mind, and it is even affirmed by science that&quot;our inner state becomes our outer invironment&quot;, the thing about our thought/measuring effects the other end of the Universe, is the black hole in space, the strange Lady in the mountains told me, sucks everything in, even Light, but once compressed through the darkness and mightily worked over, things have to come out somewhere and transformed, I picture it as a sort of hourglass, because nothing is lost in the&quot;Divine Economy&quot;, or law of preservation.

Why, over millennia, have countless Many devoted their lives to keeping the Light of God in so many ways in the consciousness of Humanity, suffered and died for it? Why the Great Pyramid and Giza, why the Great Temples the World over, the Taj Mahal,&quot;Entrance to Paradise&quot;, the Great Cathedrals of Europe, and in every little town is a Church, a sanctuary to pray, and when disaster strikes the first to be rebuilt is the Church? Because there is nothing more important to the Human Spirit than its connection with the&quot;Supreme Deity -which is the source of Light&quot;, as the Areopagite teaches.

So I&apos;m with you, Don, on&quot;The Journey toward the Light&quot;, which Journey cannot be described because it is&quot;the interior Journey of Enchantment&quot;of the Individual, if you can wonder at the Marvelous,&quot;Horus reckons you among the gods&quot;- ye are God&apos;s&quot;, collectively&quot;the Sublime Journey of Mankind&quot;, neither can it be&quot;had&quot;for it recedes when reaching for it as all of us know. The Journey is an&quot;orderly unfolding of mysteries, each according to their own development&quot;, Fern told, and described toward the end of yesterdays post perfectly by the Areopagite.

The journey toward the Holy Grail, the Templar Treasure is mystical, not rational, and Hermes says:

&quot;He that hears must co-understand and conspire in thought with him that speaks. He must have his hearing swifter and sharper than the voice of the speaker.&quot;

Hallo Steven, Don,

I can&apos;t, nor do I want to, describe the World as I see it, the educational system, and in what currently transpires with&quot;Health Reform&quot;, any reform, I see a Monster at work.

I shall tend to my Theosis, which has become &apos;self-working&apos;. I have always thought myself immortal but didn&apos;t know how to go about realizing it.

I read quite a bit of St. John the Theologen and his son Prochorus, and it reminded me of the passage in St. John, chapter 3, verse 5

Verily, verily, I say onto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

I thought of posting Steve Miller&apos;s&quot;Saving Grace&quot;these past days. There was a rumor of a man living on the Hill I used to live, a sort of recluse. I went to see him and he invited me into his backyard with nothing but Ocean view. We had a smoke and he played this song which blew my mind over and beyond the Ocean.

Much of what you two are trying to say I was told was the secret of The Illuminatti. Because I failed to or could not believe I was denied entrance.

Maybe as was suggested I have to make one more go round ... don&apos;t think I can accept what you two believe.

Even though I was given the correct question AND answer I still struggle. Yet ...

One still has to wonder ... who was the &apos;god&apos; of The Neanderthal ... and Cro-Magnon ?

And what of people like me .. stuck in a limbo of wanting to believe but unable to do so ... ones who are still searching for soul and will still be doing thus upon a deathbed.

Are we as in&quot;Memento http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/ &quot;doomed to try it yet one more time .. how many will that next one be ... 100, 100,000 100,000,000 ? does it even matter ?

And then a line in a lead in to my daughters&apos; production of Jesus Christ Superstar in August of 2001 (one month before 9/11) ... And when all the world believe in&quot;Him&quot;that will be the signal and sign for a NEW WORLD ORDER ... I had not thought of that before ...

Hallo Don,

&quot;... but then again death could indeed be the finale!

.. stuck in a limbo of wanting to believe but unable to do so ... ones who are still searching for soul and will still be doing thus upon a deathbed.&quot;

&apos;Tis another short rant!

You sound like Hamlet having lost all his mirth, pardon me, I&apos;ve been there too and much worse, everyone has, probably. If death was the finale, in that sense, would we just be living to die? Why would anything have exist at all? Would all life just be a hodge-podge of evolving organism without reason and rhyme? We can reason, therefore there is a reason, and for those who need a reason why God exist, Orthodoxy answers:&quot;If man did not have the image of God in himself, he would not be able to seek its prototype.&quot;

The Rhyme is our innate harmony and symmetry or the uneven picture on the wall wouldn&apos;t bother us. Of course, I have been in many homes where pictures are not level. What of our appreciation for Art, Music, Geometry, and the beauty and perfection of a single flower or a tranquil meadow boardered by mountains?

Once Fern was telling me things and my face was a blank. She said:&quot;For everything you don&apos;t understan and want to know there is a parallel in our everyday life.&quot;So the parallel to death being the finale would be never to wake up again, but we do. As far back as I can remember in my life, I couldn&apos;t conceive of ever dying.

&quot;... don&apos;t think I can accept what you two believe.&quot;

Speaking for myself, in the beginning of this thread, I felt but a fraction of the resistance you indicate, and even that was feigned, I confess, because I didn&apos;t want you to think, and now confirmed, and perhaps our welcome Guests, that I am blindly following what Steven, pardon me, had to say. It&apos;s the collectively perpetuated &apos;face-loosing&apos; thing. It might have been just my stubborness, maybe, on account of the famous bell ringing when hearing the Truth, and in that hearing I was in agreement with the Gentleman, not to mention the love we have for the same music.

Concerning this being unable to believe, the best answer I have to this problem, which workes every time, is to hold what you hear but don&apos;t understand, therefore can&apos;t believe, in&quot;Suspension&quot;, this not throwing out the baby with the bathwater. This is crucial because by study you will come to the critical point of&quot;I SEE&quot;, which instantly facilitates acceptance, the last step to integration. Then see if you can cummunicate to someone what you saw. No.

Another crucial point to remember is that the Journey is a process as given in&quot;Agathon&apos;s Party&quot;. My Philosophy Teacher interpreting Socrates:&quot;Yes you have a Soul, yes I know you need to know, all of us need to know, yes we&apos;ll get to it, but now is not the time. Don&apos;t project, don&apos;t imagen, don&apos;t work up an argument even while the Speaker is still speaking, in doing these things you don&apos;t hear a word that&apos;s being said, all you have to do is show up&quot;, giving his feared look to the people who walk in late.

Ja, a NWO is forming,&quot;it hasn&apos;t got a face just yet&quot;, (Dead), and all the horrors we&apos;re living through, and the sickening behaviour over the Country to resist change at any cost, is just the chaff being separate from the Wheat. See, we&apos;re underground meanwhile tending to our Theosis.

The &apos;god&apos; of the Neanderthal ... Cro-magnon? Arghh, my Philosophy Teacher&apos;s direct hit,&quot;we always look askance avoiding what we should be looking at but don&apos;t want to.&quot;

Anyway, there is a never-ending field of Pristine snow to step on and begin walking with Faith, which you have because you wavering.

Fourteen years ago today, loved Jerry Garcia passed away, God bless him, and for just wanting to play for the People to help them become&quot;Dead Heads&quot;as he was dead to the World, yet struggling like you and me. Were he alive, he would ask

It was festive in the Church today! His Grace Bishop Maxim presided over the Matins and Liturgy, preaching and singing with Authority. Two hours in which his Grace and the Priests prayed together, Rituals, and with the three Candles in each hand, and his Grace changing Robes and Symbols, last the Crown to be in full Bishop Attire. The Reverence accorded his Grace I beheld....

St. Matthew was honered, and His Grace spoke of the agitated waters of the Sea of Galilee, the storm tossed boat, Jesus walking on water and the fearing disciples thinking he was a Ghost, Peter having doubt and sinking, even so Jesus extendet his hand to save him, and the importance of Faith.

I have come to love the constant petitioning for Mercy, for God to save his Inheritence with the perpetual offering Glory onto God.

Something wonderful happened. As usual now, I sit in &apos;my place&apos; in the back of the Church before the Matins begins, looking and feeling good. His Grace walked in so quietly as to surprise me with a smiling face, a bow and&quot;Good Morning&quot;. I couldn&apos;t help but smile, bow, and say Good Morning, but because of my surprise I didn&apos; have time to stand up, and his Grace &apos;hurried&apos; to the Altar. I kept smiling.... Check your thoughts, Don, it&apos;s called &apos;watching&apos;.

His Grace also gave out the Blessed Bread, everyone kissed his hand and so did I. I felt very well walking out of the Hospital.

It was and is a good Sunday, I wouldn&apos;t have missed it for the world, and I would thank you again.

Happy Feast day! Did His Grace mention St.Herman of Alaska at all? Today is His feast day,.which we spent at the Monastery in Platina,which is named after and dedicated to St.Herman.

 http://2rfamily.com/images/St%20Herman%20of%20Alaska.jpg 

There were around 80 pilgrims there for this historic occasion,the last St.Herman&apos;s Feast day with my Godfather as the Abbot of the Monastery before he goes off to seminary and then to be made Bishop of Alaska.

He,(Fr.Gerasim,) officially announced who the new Abbot will be,Fr.Hilarion,who happens to be my son John&apos;s best friend up there at the Monastery. John will have to wait about 30 years before he can become the Abbot!

It is difficult for us to be losing Fr.Gerasim,but all for the greater good we trust.

My favorite part of the Gospel you mentioned,is the fact that,when Jesus walks on the water up to the boat that the disciples are in and Peter says,&quot;If it&apos;s really you,bid me to come out on the water with you,&quot;Jesus doesn&apos;t reply to him thusly,&quot;Oh no.That&apos;s just for me to be able to do because I&apos;m God.&quot;NO! Rather,He says,&quot;Come on out! The more the merrier I created you to be just like me!&quot;(I&apos;m paraphrasing here a bit,but essentially,that&apos;s the gist of it...) It&apos;s only when Peter starts to doubt his own abilities that he begins to sink.(And Jesus immediately saves him and stashes him back onboard the boat,asking him only this,&quot;Wherefore didst thou doubt?&quot;)

Peter is a classic case for Don to study.He was always in doubt or making mistakes or having his rational mind get in the way of his faith.

Faith,as I&apos;ve mentioned before,is&apos;nt wishful thinking,it&apos;s a perception of invisible realities which overshadow and operate at a higher order of determinism than our physical reality.

And&quot;Momento&quot;is one of my favorite movies which deals with one of my favorite subjects,amnesia.

Orthodoxy is all about Anamnesis, which is the cure for amnesia.

&quot;Do this in Remembrance of me.&quot;

Dear Don,
You are obviously a very intelligent person. But sometimes,for most intelligent people,their own mind can be their worst obstacle. This kind of knowledge goes beyond the mind and uses other faculties which I&apos;m confident that you have in abundance as well!

The only reason You can&apos;t find faith is because you&apos;re thinking about it too much. You have other talents you can use to get what you&apos;re looking for... Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Aug 9, 2009, 9:26pm

Yes, St. Herman was honered, and also at St. Matthew&apos;s yesterday at the Vesper. I forgot.

I am glad you had a good day as well.

To fast, sorry.

The thread began with Saint Herman, and all the pictures. All the Best and God Bless your Godfather, Fr. Gerasim.

Faith I never lacked, now I think it is deeper that I thought, because when I worried about something, I never really did anything about it. Have to rent Momento and others I have on the list.

Please pardon my abrupt posting yesterday, Steven, first I thought you were still here, then I had to rush to have sushi with my friend Allen whom I haven&apos;t see in 10 month. He just came back from Colorado were he was house-sitting for his Teacher in Archery. He was born in Australia and sojourned in Tibet for awhile. A top-notch carpenter, we sometimes work together, and on a job at least seven years ago we had conversed about Armageddon and related subjects. I told him about the new bend on my life&apos;s road and he may join us here.

In my post yesterday I wrote I was sitting in Church&quot;looking and feeling good&quot;, I meant looking about and feeling good....

What a blessing for Alaska to have your Godfather, Fr. Gerasim as Bishop, perhaps Sarah will hear the good News but I don&apos;t think the Lady has the Ear.

When I first spoke with Father Aquaro, He pointed to a script going into Church, and one leaving, which one should read. The former:

Repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand.
For narrow is the Gate and hard is the way
That leadeth onto Life, and few there be that find it.

Upon leaving the Church:

Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Teaching them all I have commanded you, I am with you always,
Even onto the End of the World.

Four days ago I had a dream relating to our subject, I think. In a wooded area I stepped over pieces of wood trunks and branches and came upon a lake. I stood and noticed the water shallow and muddy. I looked across the lake and something, can&apos;t remember, happening there told me the water was deeper, clearer, and safer there. Without hesitation stepped onto the lake but my feet never touched the water, it was more gliding on air about a foot over it in the beginning. Looking down, I immediately regretted what was not really my decision to cross the lake, because I vaguely saw corpses, one for sure, and other refuse, and to my fright a hand reaching out, upon which I lifted a few feet higher to get away, still gliding. As I approached the other shore I looked down, thinking: I&apos;m so glad the water here is deep, clear, and harmless. A man walking along said: ja, the water here is deep, clear, and good.

During sleep last night I felt an earthquake, not as usual but the entire Earth was sort of vibrating, not shaking, which didn&apos;t stop and I thought of getting up to put stuff on the floor, but didn&apos;t. I&apos;m pretty sure it was a dream, scarry dream.

Don, I hope you&apos;re feeling more hopefull today. Yesterday also, I remembered Mr. Hall&apos;s answer for &apos;what is the Soul?&apos;.&quot;A magnificent reward for right effort!&quot;

Yum.Sushi.Our favorite food here.(That and Thai...) We&apos;ll have to go out for some to celebrate when I fly down for you&apos;re Baptism.(Whenever that may be...)

Here is a link to an article our Pastor,Fr.Michael sent us,which I think you will appreciate,about a Baptist preacher&apos;s first experience of Orthodoxy: http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles-2009/Preacher-Not-For-Lightweights.php 

Even more interesting than that however,is the fact that Fr.Michael just got back from a two and a half week pilgrimage to Greece and one of the places he just happened to be brought to while there was the very Monastery on Mt.Athos whose Abbot wrote that book that I discovered online that I am so thrilled with about Theosis! He brought back an actual printed copy which they gave him while he was there! Fr.Michael told me that,even though he has&apos;nt had a chance to read it yet that,visiting that particular Monastery was one of the highlights of his whole trip because the monks there were so noticeably joyful,open and welcoming to him. I told him that I was not surprised and that,once he reads the book,he will probably understand why! They must obviously be practicing what their Abbot has been writing about. I can&apos;t wait,God willing,to go back there myself!

Thank you for the link to,&quot;Brain Damage.&quot;How appropriate! I was about to write back to Don and suggest that,instead of being a hospital,perhaps the Church is actually an insane asylum and invite him to join us in the spirit of my favorite quote from Ken Kesey&apos;s,&quot;One flew over the cuckoo&apos;s nest,&quot;&quot;What&apos;s with the green uniforms? some sort of club or something?&apos;&quot;No my friend.We are lunatics from the asylum up the road.Psycho-ceramics.The cracked pots of mankind...&quot;

On the avoidance of giving even the appearance of impropriety

For a successful person,especially for one who hopes to do something good and worthwhile for others with their success,the greatest resource they have is their reputation. In order to preserve one&apos;s reputation it is absolutely necessary to avoid anything that is improper,however,it is equally necessary to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.
Even if there is absolutely nothing improper going on and one has only the best of intentions,if, it may appear to someone else that you are involved in something improper,something that would call in question your judgment,there is no way that you can prove or convince others that nothing wrong has taken place,rumors will spread and one&apos;s reputation will begin to erode.

For an Orthodox Christian,even more than a successful person,whose prayer is,&quot;Grant us to live chastely in word and act,that we may live a life of heroic virtue and not fall away from thy promised blessings,&quot;to avoid even the appearance of impropriety is doubly important.

Why? Because,as the saying goes,&quot;Where there is smoke,there is fire.&quot;We may not intend to be doing anything improper but,if what we are doing may appear to be improper to others,there is probably a good chance that what we are engaged in could easily slide into something that would actually be wrong,in which case,the utmost of caution is recommended.

Do not underestimate the far-reaching repercussions and consequences of even the,seemingly,smallest wrongdoing. Many peoples lives have been ruined by,what seemed, at the time, to be inconsequential misdemeanors. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Thank God the outside day is over.

I know the best sushi bar, a bit pricy, but one gets what one pays for.

Not For Lightweights. I coudn&apos;t have said it better myself, agree with everything, felt and feel the same way. The first time at St. Steven&apos;s, my mistake in writing St. Stephen&apos;s, bad mistake, I too heard the sound coming from everywhere and looked about, and yes, the different tones is why I sing along very quietly. One of the first things I learned was the meaning of Theotokas, said and written so often.&quot;I like what this place does to me. I like the way I relax and become accepting of my place there.&quot;Ditto

Father Aquaro speaks at the speed of an auctioneer, but Father Ceko and His Grace Bishop Maxim speak very clearly, most of the time. I can glean the purpose of speaking fast, according to my Philosophy Teacher, of whom everyone is probably tired by now,&quot;it pulls the butterscotch in your brain&quot;, forcing you to&quot;attend&quot;.

About brain damge, I love the movie&quot;One flew over the Cockoo&apos;s Nest&quot;, it&apos;s so telling of how it is in those cold and sterile Institutions. One of our considerations for a name of this board was&quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, remember Don?

Don, if I were to pick on you some more in good humor, I would say you can check out an Orthodox Church and feel as totally awkward as I did, not knowing where to go, what to look at, what to do, or what to say, if anything at all, and walk out confused about what next? And just stumble and schtotter along, someone will hand you a piece of Blessed Bread on the way to the Holy Grail we are all searching for. I&apos;ll hold my tongue now.

Are you indicating that you actually were at Mt. Athos? Just looking at a picture of the Monastery made it my favorite.

I agree that being successful person, one&apos;s reputation is everything, and the avoidance of even given the appearance of impropriety is equally impotant. This is proven true in my work, and I must say that many people I meet for the fist time greet me,&quot;You must be Charlotte, your reputation precedes you.&quot;Tut! Tut! I appreciate it for its own sake, say &apos;thank you&apos; and rescue the embarrassing moment by changing the subject. Compliments mattered in the beginning, giving me confidence, now I do my work with a different mind-set and all is well.

How I live my life generally was forged by my Father&apos;s words:&quot;Be polite and helpful, earn your own bread, don&apos;t bring shame on my name, keep the good rules and brake those you think need to be broken.&quot;Thus I fared well, and no matter how goody this sounds, I do no wrong to human or animal, not in my Nature, and in all matters I keep my word without stint. I do steal a few flowers now and then, but the people don&apos;t mind.

Helpful hint #6, as an Orthodox Christian I shall be mindful of not even giving the appearance of doing something improper, which I can&apos;t even imagin ever doing, having no reason or the slightest interest of ever veering from my path. My live and future is set and all before me is the way of and to the Beautiful. Clean conscience is at home in great minds.

&quot;One flew over the cuckoo&apos;s nest,&quot;the movie was good,but the book was 100xs better!

My son Alexander and I went to Mt.Athos three years ago. It was incredible. Our whole family spent a month in Greece at that time and we loved every moment of it. To go to a country where practically everyone is Orthodox and has been since the Apostles first brought Christianity to there,is an unbelievable experience. Not like here in America where there are three thousand denominations of,&quot;so called&quot;christianity. Over there is only one Church for the past 1700 yrs. You definitely come away with a different perspective on things after being over there.

Speaking of reputations-it&apos;s no wonder Christianity has such a bad reputation here in America,hardly anyone has ever been exposed to the real thing! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Aug 11, 2009, 8:45pm

What a pity I wasn&apos;t introduced to Orthodoxy before I visited Greece, I would have gone to Mt. Athos of which i read then, but only that, and would have sought out other places and seen with different eyes, had I even been at this stage of my progress.

As it was, I visitet the usual tourist attraction, the Temple of Posidon by the Sea, payed my respects to Plato and Socrates, went to Delphi where my taxi driver met an Orthodox Priest who had no way to get back to Galaxia, so we took him home. The Father said to wait, fetched the key and led me into his beautiful Church. I looked about and felt my knees week, and sat down. I was allowed to take a few pictures. I will asked Don if he would kindly post them.

The reason my knees went week was, some time before my trip to Greece I had a dream. I walked in the desert, it was hard walking in shoes and I took them off. A short distance before and somewhat to the left walked a man in a robe holding the hand of his son, though I saw the son only vaguely. They walked toward a Temple and I followed.

I walked in after them and saw only the man sitting on the bench. I stood and contemplated the paintings, one by one. A golden women came out of a door, kissed me and left. I can&apos;t remember, but am pretty sure a golden man also came, kissed me and left. The paintings in the Temple resembled those in my dream, so did the atmosphere.

So I think the dream was a rememberance of the Orthodox Church. I believe in Synchronicty, the Father didn&apos;t just happen to approach Aggelos to ask for a ride home, in fact, Aggelos told me not to listen to the Priest because he is crazy, but then said Father hadn&apos;t been able to find anyone and if I would mind. Of course, I didn&apos;t, and the rest of the profound.

I didn&apos;t search too long for specifically the little fisher town of Galaxia by Delphi, didn&apos;t think it was on the web. As to the three axioms in the Temple of Phoebes Apollo,&quot;Know Thyself&quot;,&quot;Nothing in Excess&quot;, and&quot;make a pledge and mischief is nigh&quot;, as well as the large letter E. Among other things epsilon signifies the number 5. Plutarch&apos;s essay on the meaning of the E at Delphi is the only literary source for the inscription. In ancient times, the origin of these phrases was attributed to one or more of the Seven Sages of Greece, though ancient as well as modern scholars have doubted the legitimacy of such inscriptions. According to one pair of scholars,&quot;The actual authorship of the three maxims set up on the Delphian temple may be left uncertain. Most likely they were popular proverbs, which tended later to be attributed to particular sages.&quot;

Always must needs have a rational explanation or left uncertain. Since the phrases were attributed to seven Sages of Greece, the&quot;Seven Holy Youths of Ephesus&quot;came to mind. I&apos;m guessing.

Then I looked at Mt. Athos, the Holy Monastery of Simonos Petra, magnificent, it rests on this Rock on which Jesus built his Church.

Read another good part of the pdf on Theosis, though it is easy reading, each paragraph read twice is better, writing it better yet to remember. However, writing it to myself keeps the instruction isolated, I feel.

&quot;Humility is needed to see that we are sick, that we are full of weekness and passions.

&quot;Again, to persist on the path, someone who begins the path of Theosis must have constant humility, for if he accepts the thought that he manages perfectly well just by using his own powers, then pride enters him; he loses what he has gained and must start again from the beginning; to become humble, to see his weekness, his human sickness, and learn not to rely on himself. In order to find himself continuously on the path of Theosis, he need to depend on the grace of God.

&quot;Therefore, in the lives of the saints, their great humility impresses us. While they were near God, they shone within the light of God, they were miracle-workers; they gave off myrrh; yet at the same time they believed about themselves that they were the worst of men. It was this humility of theirs that made them gods by Grace.

&quot;The noetic single phrase prayer of the heart is particularly helpful:&quot;Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me, a sinner.&quot;

&quot;Tears of repentance, mourning for our sins is called&quot;gladsome mourning&quot;. Then tears of love for divine eros for God come.&quot;

The Halo of the Holy Saints

&quot;Those advanced in Theosis&quot;receive the greatest experience of divine Grace available to man, which, according to the Holy Fathers is the vision of the uncreated light of God.&quot;Very few in each generation. The halos of the holy icons show this.

&quot;The Holy Spirit dwells in our body and shares the struggle of our psyche and body.&quot;

What an informing sentence!

&quot;Within the Church we are not isolated members but a unity, a brotherhood, a fraternal community - not only among ourselves, but also with the Saints of God, those who are living on earth today and those who have passed away. Not even in death are Christians divided. Death is unable to seperate Christians because they are all united in the resurrected body of Christ.&quot;

How much there is to learn! Not much I know, but I do know - that I am on the right path.

In that Spirit I bid All a great day.

PS I stopped by the man with the &apos;Jesus Van&apos; I mentioned, he has a new one, but he wasn&apos;t there.

I said Robert reminded me of a Saint, a fool for Christ, I read about recently, which drew a blank stare. So yes, nobody has been told. I spent half an hour on the beach and went back, but Robert was nowhere in sight. Not that it matters too much. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Several things: It&apos;s heartbreaking to read about the fires at Simonapetra,to think of all the priceless treasures that were lost.

This little book online,(I&apos;m looking forward to getting an actual one in print,)Is one of the most amazing things i&apos;ve come across. I&apos;m sure we will be reading it over and over again!

Here is a picture of Archbishop John who was often seen in uncreated light.

 http://media.photobucket.com/image/Archb....ocalypse/19.jpg 



He was one of our&quot;Living links&quot;to Sanctity. Here is his life:

 http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/johnmx1.htm 



His incorrupt relics are in San Francisco.

If you ever locate this Robert again,perhaps you can give him an Icon for his van. Back in the mid-west, there were bumper stickers that said,&quot;If it ain&apos;t King James,it ain&apos;t Bible!&quot;Which I tend to agree with. Unless you can read it in the original Greek and Aramaic, the King James is the CLOSEST,(although,far from perfect,) translation into English. Some people do not like the&quot;Shakespeareian&quot;English it uses. I prefer it and certainly can&apos;t see that YOU would have a problem with that!

Have a great day! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Aug 13, 2009, 1:32pm

I read the life of the indefatigable Archbishop John the Wonderworker, and all this in our time.

I think often why it is that not more Priests visit prisons where they are needed most.

I learned:

&quot;.... when the Angel of the Lord was sent to punish and destroy the sinning people, it was told him not to strike those on whom the&quot;mark&quot;had been made. In the original text this mark was called&quot;tau,&quot;the Hebrew letter corresponding to the letter&quot;T.,&quot;which is how in ancient times the cross was made, which was an instrument of punishment.&quot;

I never heard of Christ being called&quot;Pascha.&quot;Not only here, the importance of Holy Communion is emphazised:

&quot;In the Kingdom of Christ to come, there will no longer be need for receiving the body and blood of Christ, for all who have been vouchsaved it will be in closest converse with Him and will enjoy the pre-eternal light of the Life originating Trinity, experiencing that blessedness which no tongue can express, and which is incomprehensible to our feeble mind. For this reason after partaking of the Holy Mysteries at Liturgy, in the altar is always pronounced the prayer which we sing on Paschal days:&quot;O Christ, Thou great and most sacred Pascha! O Wisdom, Word and Power of God! Grant us to partake of Thee more fully in the unwaning day of Thy Kingdom.&quot;

&quot;Man is created thus; the body must live as the soul desires. At the moment of death the soul continues to live without the body. Everything will perish except that which the soul has gathered through love and prayer. Everything virtuous by a man is written in the soul and will not be taken from him.&quot;

Confirming Fern&apos;s: we take only our qualitive understanding with us to assist and guide us in managing the quantities of the next life. Mr. Hall:&quot;You don&apos;t take with you what you have but what you are&quot;, not&quot;he who dies with the most toys wins&quot;on the bumper sticker.

I printed an icon of Archbishop John, and also the address of the Holy Virgin Cathedral in San Francisco where the Relics of the Saint are. My Daughter M and I will visit there next time I&apos;m in SF, which will be Thankgiving. Shoping can wait.

I was not fortunate to have a Godfather, therefore I had no Bible. In New Jersey a neighbor and I spoke about the Bible.&quot;What? You have no Bible?&quot;she said, and a few days later presented me with the Holy Bible, authorized King James Version. On the page&quot;Presented to....&quot;is written:&quot;all Souls dead and living + since no souls are dead.&quot;By:&quot;God + everything that makes up good there is no time in the universal Mind.&quot;No date. To this day I&apos;m not sure who wrote those words. I remember my elder Daughter V saying she did, but I didn&apos;t believe her as she was too young for such Wisdom and we didn&apos;t go to any Church. We did speak about God and I told them that they can choose their religion when ready. Now I have to ask her again.

No, I have no problem with the King James Bible. As every Francis Bacon Lover knows, me first and foremost,

&quot;...The Bible which all of us read and admire from a literary point of view because of it&apos;s peculiar and beautiful English was written in that form by Bacon who invented and perfected that style of English expression. The first editions of this Bible were printed under the same guidance and in the same manner as were the Shakespeare plays, and the ornaments for the various pages were drawn in pen and ink and on wood by artists engaged by Bacon who worked under his supervision. Everyone of the ornaments concealed some Rosicrucian emblem and occasionally a Masonic emblem or some initials that would reveal Bacon&apos;s name or the name of the Rosicrucians. Such ornaments were put not only in the Christian Bible that Bacon had rewritten but in the Shakespeare plays, and in some of Bacon&apos;s own books, and a few other books that were typically Rosicrucian in spirit.&quot;

Dr. H Spencer Lewis Imperator of the Rosicrucian Order during the 1920-30s, from the Rosicrucian Digest, April 1930.

I cannot stop with just one testament:

&quot;The 1611 King James Bible is ornamented with Bacon&apos;s symbols and in my own special copy of the record edition, also dated 1611, these symbols are Rosicrucianly marked to call the attention of the initiated to them and to tell them that the 1611 Bible is without possibility of doubt, one of Bacon&apos;s books.....When Bacon was born, English as a literary language did not exist, but once he died he had succeeded in making the English language the noblest vihicle of thought ever possessed by mankind. This he accomplished merely by his Bible and by his Shakespeare.&quot;

Edwin D. Lawrence author of Bacon is Shakespeare and The Shakespeare Myth from a lecture October 9, 1912.

&quot;Dr. Lancelot Andrewes, Bishop of Winchester, one of the chief translators, was bacon&apos;s close friend. The MSS are missing.&quot;(Alfred Dodd)

Fern would say that they are in Bruton Vault, Williamsburg, Virginia.

&quot;The first edition of the King James Bible, which was edited by Francis Bacon and prepared under Masonic supervision, bears more Mason&apos;s marks than the Cathedral of Strasburg.&quot;

Manly P. Hall, from a lecture Rosicrucian and Masonic Origins 1929.

First page

&quot;Great and manifold were the blessings, most dread Sovereign, which Almighty God, the Father of all mercies, bestowed upon us the people of England, when first he sent your Majesty&apos;s Royal Person to rule and reign over us. For whereas it was the expectation of many, who wished not well onto our Sion, that upon the setting of that bright Occidental Star, Queen Elizabeth of most happy memory,....&quot;

Occulted England.

Good Idea to give Robert an Icon, I have so many printed. I&apos;ll probably see him in the next few days as Robert is parked next to a Trader Joe&apos;s where I shop. I look forward to what he has to say.

A great day to you and Guests as well!

One of my favorite stories about Archbishop John: A lady,a Russian immigrant,living in S.F. got a letter with some bad news about her sister back in Russia. She had apparently gone insane or had a nervous breakdown or something and had to be institutionalized. No one there seemed to be able to help her. Her sister,here in S.F. was,of course distressed and did&apos;nt know what to do. Friends of hers recommended that she tell Archbishop John and ask him to pray for her.
The next Sunday,after services the woman saw Archbishop John coming towards her and was about to introduce herself and explain the situation and ask for his prayers,but he just waved her off saying,&quot;Da da da.&quot;and walked away.
The woman was,understandably upset and offended, thinking to her self,&quot;Hmm! Some great wonder-worker! He would&apos;nt even stop to talk with me!&quot;
In the amount of time it would take to get another letter from Russia,she discovered that,somehow,her sister was well and had returned home Again. The next Sunday at Church the lady sees Archbishop John and thinks to herself,&quot;Well my sister is well again,no thanks to you!&quot;At which point Vladica John walks up to her and asks,&quot;So,how is your sister Varvara now?&quot; Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Aug 13, 2009, 3:35pm

What there is,is not Holy water,but oil from the lampada over his relics. If you don&apos;t manage to get some while there,I have some I will give to you. I never go on a trip anywhere without bringing some with me.

Archbishop John,(Among others...) is proof that these things are still possible for us even in our day and age. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Aug 14, 2009, 10:11am

Indeed, and thank you for the offer. Oil from the Lampada is probably available for People to take with them.

The Ohrid Dialog page honors the Holy Prophet Micah (Michea) today, and the Homily is most interesting.

Logical! Often I have thought of this word allied with Logos, philosophically also known as the&quot;Word&quot;, and if we waver in acceptence, at least we don&apos;t outright dismiss a thing seeming logical, and the many words ending in -logical we use constantly.

In the Prolog at the the end of the pdf concerning Theosis, words and concepts are difined, logically.

Logos

&quot;The Greek word logos already had a long history before it was used by St. John. Its three principle meanings are:&quot;Think,&quot;&quot;reckon,&quot;and&quot;speak.&quot;Like all things rational, logos as its most profound level conveys:&quot;the meaning,&quot;&quot;the ordering,&quot;and&quot;reasonable content.&quot;In time, this also came to be identified with&quot;Universal Reason,&quot;and&quot;Creative Reason.&quot;

&quot;St. John completes the philosophical truths of the Ancient Greeks, by connecting them to the Jewish Tradidition of his day. So when St. John&apos;s Gospel tells us,&quot;In the beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was with God, and the Logos was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him exists life, and the life was the light of men ... St. John clearly states that Jesus Christ is the Logos. The Logos, second person of the Holy Trinity, is also known as the Wisdom, Intellect and Providence of God. It is in the Logos that creation finds its reason, cause, and purpose.&quot;

Fern has the word&quot;reverberating&quot;throughout Creation.

Kingdom of God

&quot;The Kingdom of God means, the&quot;Rule of God,&quot;and also the Ruling power of God;&quot;although all pervading and ever-present, it is spiritual and beyond all sensible and intelligible categories. The Kingdom of God also refers to our participation in the divine life of the Holy Trinity, making the chosen person through Grace what God is by nature. The Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Heaven are synonymous.

&quot;St. Symeon the New Theologian describes it in the following way,&quot;for those who become children of light and sons of the day to come, for those who always walk in the light, the Day of the Lord will never come, for they are already with God and in God.&quot;

Continuous-ly also, we use words ending in &apos;ous&apos;. Madam Blavatzky speaks of&quot;the matter-moving Nous.&quot;

The Nous of Orthodoxy

&quot;The nous is our highest faculty. It has been called : the&quot;eye of the psyche,&quot; the eye of the heart,&quot; and also the&quot;energy of the psyche.&quot; When cleansed, the nous resides and operates from within the heart; it can perceive God and the spiritual principals that underlie creation; it is cognitive, visionary, and intuitive. The Metropolitan of Nafpaktos, Hierotheos said,&quot;The nous is in the image of God. And in as much as God is light, the nous too has light mirrowed in it by the Grace of God.&quot;

&quot;After man&apos;s fall and the&quot;fragmentation&quot;of the psyche, the nous will invariably identify itself with the mind, the imagination, the senses, or even the body - loosing sight of its pure unalloyed state.&quot;

Theologian

&quot;Theology deals with God, our participation in Him, and the underlaying divine reality inherent in creation. It is far more than intellectual and scholarly discourse about God, and it not acquired through academic study.

&quot;A real theologian is someone who has reached intimate communion with God and has perception of the spiritual world. To quote Evagrius,&quot;If you are a theologian, you will pray truly; and if you truly pray, you are a theologian;&quot;whilst Maximus the Confessor and St. Gregory Palamas says,&quot;Our devotion lies not in words but in realities.&quot;

The last sentence so logical. Repentance=metanoia, a change of heart. Confession is&quot;purely for therapeutic reasons, whose aim is to clear the nous and the heart from sin.&quot;

And&quot;sin&quot;, says Mr. Hall,&quot;is the refusal to grow.&quot;

Hope you, Don, and your Family are having a great vacation!

Water becomes Holy when it is blessed by a Saint, Bishop, or Priest.

From a Sunday Sermon at St. Herman&apos;s Orthodox Church:

&quot;This brings me to the exhortation I wanted to bring to you this morning. Beloved faithful, hear the word of the Lord to St. Peter as He streched out His hand immediately to raise Him up from the sea of life surging with the storm of temptations:&quot;O ye of little faith, why did you doubt?&quot;

Also mentioned in Orthodox writing is Voltaire&apos;s&quot;fatal chaos of individual misery&quot;. When I first thought of Jesus walking on water I thought it must mean chaos. I also remember reading that walking on water can mean walking on the Apostolic Teachings, which is difficult in the beginning, but the more one reads, lots of it, the easier it becomes because it is explained and does make sense. Untill then there is Faith and hope in the good, which everyone has naturally, even the A-theist, but willfully denies it. No one says,&quot;I hope things will be worse tomorrow.&quot;

In my dream I glided on air above the murky water and dangers beneath because I had Faith in something I saw on the other side, telling me the &apos;water&apos;, in this case I can say the Apostolic Teachings were&quot;deeper and clearer&quot;there.

Why would water flow uphill? It is subject gravity as all things in the physical. Above all, there is a Mystery unveiling in the Teachings in proportion to one&apos;s development and merit. According to Orthodoxy,

Mystery, (mysterion)

&quot;The Greek word, mystery, originally meant&quot;initiation&quot;,&quot;&quot;secret,&quot;or&quot;revelation of a secret.&quot;which is behind the&quot;veil&quot;(sf. 2 Corinthians 3:16; 4:3). Mystery carries the dual connotation of something bothe hidden and revealed, both a riddle and a revelation together.

&quot;There are seven main mysteries established by Christ himself, including Confession, Baptism and Holy Eucharist; but their number is potentially limitless, because in the Church all things work in a mysterious way to reveal the Kingdom of God.&quot; 

&quot;In thy patience possess thee thy Soul&quot;.

I&apos;m sure Steven, pardon me, can answer your questions authoritively.

Love

The song makes me melacholy, but I think everyone retreats to their room now and then to cry and pray, other times sing and smile, and as my Mother terms it&quot;studiert&quot;, by which she means, thinks about and contemplates Life. And where have fourty years gone? But we have grown.

There are more things in&quot;genuine Christianity&quot;than dreamt of by me or anyone not knowing about it. I am no longer surprised to find things not deemed to belong to Christianity at all, the Teachings seem all-encompassing, an unbelievable Wealth of Knowledge of world history and every other kind, above and below. I especially like the Greek.

Orthodox means&quot;Correctly Believing&quot;, orthos=correct, dokeo=I see, doxa=glory.

Dia-logos of the Nous&quot;our highest faculty&quot;, also called&quot;the eye of the psyche&quot;, or&quot;eye of the heart&quot;. Repeating things allows resonance to built.

Orthodoxy

&quot;Man is created thus; the body must live as the soul desires.&quot;

Plato in Laws,&quot;The soul which administers all things that are moved in every way, administers likewise the heavens.

The Soul is&quot;the motion that is able to move itself.

&quot;Soul is the most ancient of all things, and the commencement of motion.&quot;

The Soul is shown as a line moving from the dot in the middle of a circle to the end of it.

&quot;The soul was generated prior to body, and body is posterior and secondary, as being, according to nature, ruled over by the ruling soul.

&quot;Soul then leads everything in heaven, and on earth, and in the sea, by its movement the names of which are, to will, to consider, to take care of, to consult, to form opinions true or false, to be in a state of joy, sorrow, confidence, fear, hate, love, together with all such primary movements as are allied to these . . . being a goddess herself, she ever takes as an ally the NOUS, a god, and disciplines all things correctly and happily; but when with Anoia - not nous - it works out everything the contrary.&quot;

Dear Don and Charlotte,

You did an excellent job of esplaining,Charlotte! It is also traditional for the student to surpass and instruct the master.

I would agree,it is the Blessing which changes the substance and I&apos;m not sure if the chemical properties change,(which would be an interesting experiment to perform.) I would say,what changes is the invisible vibration that the chemical substance carries changes,it&apos;s Chi,(as the Chinese would say,) or it&apos;s Mana,(as the Hawaiian&apos;s would say,) or the degree of the Grace of the Holy Spirit,as we crazy Orthodox Christians would say, changes in such a way to become beneficial to both soul and body.

Or,you could even say that it&apos;s consciousness changes,or the consciousness behind the substance,or the consciousness which creates the substance in the first place is modified by the Blessing of it.

Or something like that. I don&apos;t know,I&apos;m just a cook!

Ever see that movie,&quot;Under siege&quot;with Steven seagal and Tommy Lee Jones? I love that line in it,&quot;I&apos;m just a cook!&quot;We say that a lot at work.

Hi Charlotte and&quot;ren&quot;

As long as you put saints and priests and others before the Divine spark that is supposed to be within all of us I will never be able to follow you. You are in error. Charlotte the answer lies within ... no man needs anything else than himself to get there least of all another mortal man in any guise. Teachers yes but that does not give them any special powers such as turning water holy. Charlotte what is happening to you ?

No, haven&apos;t seen the movie, but if thou art a cook I am a cookette, please pardon me once again, couldn&apos;t help it.

Or, when water is blessed there is a vibration impinging on the molecules, not only from the&quot;Blessor&apos;s&quot;Mind, but also by the motion of the hands making the cross, both in the Holy Spirit. Some time ago a Gentleman in Japan proved that water is conscious.

Years ago, I wrote out part of a book of the Mana of the Kahuna. Mana, a vital force of varying degrees according to the consciousness directing it, can carry chemical substance with it as it flows, so its quiet possible that it can change the chemicals. I was interesting reading, and according to R.W. Emerson also applies to Humans:

&quot;The person love does to us fit,
Like Mana, has the taste of all of it.

On the Soul, he writes:&quot;The soul is wholly embodied, and the body is wholly ensouled:--

Her pure and eloquent blood
Spoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought
That one might almost say her body thought.

There is no great and no small
To the Soul that maketh all:
And where it cometh, all things are
And it cometh everywhere.

I am the owner of the sphere,
Of the seven stars and the solar year,
Of Caesar&apos;s hand, and Plato&apos;s brain,
Of Lord Christ&apos;s heart, and Shakespeare&apos;s strain.

The Transendentalist of New England knew he had a Soul, I think you, Don, and I have one as &apos;well&apos; to be uncovered. Meanwhile I am most fortunate to have a strain of mighty Shakespeare, and know why I&apos;m on this little planet.

Hi Don,

I&apos;m going off the deep end , just kidding. Strange axiom for by definition the deep end is the end of deepnes. Thank you for your concern for my well being.

I don&apos;t put Saints, Priests, and others before the Divine spark in me, they just shine the Light on it to increase its luster, and now and then in some such proficient moment it lights up the whole world. Some call it an Epiphany, others hitting themselves on the forehead, a Stupiphany, either way understanding is had.

About our spark, remember my Phil-Teacher,&quot;how do we know that when we hear the Truth it is the true? Because our central reality is a star-like structure and when light/truth strikes it, it shines. Plato affirms this, Fern&apos;s&quot;soul-response&quot;, etc.

Don, in my infancy I almost died three times, spiritually speaking it matters not what the physical cause, and in growing up I touched the ground but lightly, rather sought to discover the mysterious in fields and forests whilst my classmates, glued to the earth, not one a friend, mocked me as a&quot;Spinner&quot;, appropriately so as it means&quot;Weaver&quot;, but also crazy. Even beat me up. This is what I meant by being&quot;predisposed&quot;, open to the Secrets of the Universe, among other reasons.

Perhaps the dream I repeated caused you concern, viz., from murky water to the deeper and clear water on the other side, which I equated with Orthodox Teachings. It is, you see, that the first out of five types of dreams simply show what the mind is processing at the moment in a waking state. This one needed no decoding.

Let&apos;s say no Religions exist, do you think that the most acute Minds of gravest learning in Human History, from Hermes, to which Corpus Hermeticum said Minds contributed, to Plato, to the Luminaries of the Florence Renaissance, including the Painters, to Sir Francis Bacon/Shakespeare, in whom all knowledge was contracted for to reform the Whole World, transpiring right before our eyes, taught and wrote Libraries full of Books in the vein of the Secrets of the Universe, just to pass the time? According to all of them, Live has but one purpose, that of self-transformation, and there are mortal men whose power far exceeds making water Holy. An understanding of the Mystery is necessary.

And we haven&apos;t even touched on the World&apos;s Great Civilizations ano dazumal, not cultures, but magic Civilizations such as Egyptian. Half their book is for the living dead, the other half betokens transformation to be&quot;born a second time&quot;.

Dear Don,

The Saints are those who have found that truth within and have realized it,or,&quot;Made it real&quot;in their lives and point the way for us to do the same.

Priests administer the Divine Sacraments which are food and medicine for those seeking to make it real in their lives.

We don&apos;t worship them. We are grateful for their assistance in our Self-realization.

They help us. We help you. You help us. WE help each other.

What&apos;s so bad about that?

Every time I attend Church I like it more. Can&apos;t define why and if could I would not, suffice it to say that the Church itself is alive, embued.

Alone Father Ceko presided over the Matins and Liturgy, and together with the beautiful singing transported us Faithful into a Reverend State. He spoke of the Holy Transfiguration of Jesus, the mustard seed, how little Faith we need to say to the mountain, any obstacle,&quot;move over there&quot;and it will if the Faith is Real, and I know what Father Ceko means.

That we should think like God, imitate His Likeness, everyone is Holy, that we should speak truth, not be pulled down, speak the Language of God, and most of all speak the language of Love.

Sts. Isaakios, Faustos, and Dalmation, of the Dalmation Monastery in Canstinople, living about the 3-4 century, were honored.

Read was from the third appearance of Christ to the Apostles encouraging them to throw out the net, and even with 153 fishes in it the net didn&apos;t break.

Read also was from the Corinthians, St. Paul to the Brethren:&quot;We are fools for Christ&apos;s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are week, but ye are strong; ye are honorable, but we are despised.&quot;That the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God, and, I had to look this up, quote from the King James Bible:

&quot;Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or the life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your&apos;s;

&quot;And ye are Christ&apos;s; and Christ is God&apos;s.&quot;

On the way home I was thinking what you, Don, had written. Even if we&apos;re no free in our Country&apos;s systems, our Mind is free and each can do as they think is best for them. I don&apos;t do what I do because Steven, whom I completely trust, pardon me, for reasons I have given before, says so, or a Priest would have me follow&quot;blindly&quot;. Actually I follow the Seeing. I do it because I have known these things all along in my Heart, augmented and affirmed by my studies, but not the particulars, and when Socrates says that at a critical point the Soul takes wings, he doesn&apos;t mean it flies out into space somewhere, but to the Kingdom within, its home.

If I had a gun for every ace that I had drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
But you know I&apos;m only in it for love and the gold
Well I got no chance of loosing this time

See how Jerry beckons the people he loves, offering
&quot;last fair deal in the country&quot;, asking
&quot;don&apos;t you let my deal go down&quot;

The name of the song is actually,&quot;Rats, I did it again!&quot;

We are fool&apos;s for Christ&apos;s sake. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. And the wisdom of God seems like foolishness to everyone else.

All I can say is,&quot;Try it,you&apos;ll like it!&quot;(Or maybe you won&apos;t?) The first hit is free...

The truth is,it&apos;s just like anything else,you get out of it what you bring into it. You may get nothing out of it,or something from the Eternal may reach out and grab you.

You wont know until you check it out.

The question to ask yourself is,Where did you get all these negative connotations about what the Church is about? (That&apos;s an easy one to answer just by looking around at our culture.)

The thing is,I&apos;m surprised that you among all people would let that influence you&apos;re thinking before you looked into it for yourself.

The Orthodox Church just isn&apos;t like anything we have been exposed to here in the west that tries to pass itself off as Christianity.

I don&apos;t mean to refer EVERYTHING back to the Grateful Dead,but like it says on the wall outside the Fillmore west in S.F.about the Dead, :&quot;They&apos;re not the best at what they do.They&apos;re the ONLY ones who do what they do!&quot;

The same can easily be said for Orthodoxy as far as Christianity is concerned.

I realize that Christianity has a well deserved bad reputation,however,Confucius say,&quot;Don&apos;t throw out the baby with the bathwater.&quot;(Actually,I don&apos;t know if Confucius said that,but he might have!)

At the very least Don,you have to give us this,at least we don&apos;t take ourselves too seriously. I mean,how can we when we&apos;re calling ourselves&quot;Fool&apos;s for Christ&quot;?



 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Aug 17, 2009, 10:21am

Self-transformation of Orthodoxy

&quot;The ehtical teachings of the Orthodox Church, faithfully based upon the teachings of Her Lord, are concerned with one thing only: to lead man to the kingdom of heaven. She knows that there is only one path to heaven: to keep the commandments of Christ. And yet, the commandments of Christ are not just another set of rules to follow - a Christian replacement for the Old Testament Law. On the contrary, they are a new way of life, a new way of experiencing one&apos;s relationship with God, with others, and with the whole creation. They have as their aim neither the ethical improvement of man&apos;s behavior nor the moral justification of his actions, but the transformation of man&apos;s life into the likeness od God.

&quot;In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus gave His Disciples the commanment which most clearly expresses the purpose of man&apos;s existence and the purpose of Christ&apos;s work on earth: Be ye perfect, even as your Father Who is in heaven is perfect (Matthew 5:48). Thus, we are commanded to attain onto the state of perfect Godlikeness; anything less than this is sin and failure, that is, missing the mark.&quot; 

So I am glad Mr. Hall&apos;s,&quot;sin is the refusal to grow&quot;, is confirmed. Missing the mark seems to be an important expression as it is repeatedly mentioned in the Literature in italics.

&quot;It is not a matter of earning&quot;merits&quot;or trying to&quot;make up&quot;for past sins, but of entering into a new way of living in the image of God. If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. Matthew 19:17)

As my Phi-Teacher said,&quot;you can start anytime, anywhere.&quot;

Have to pack my luggage, sort through clothes and jewelry and shoes for my sojourn in Germany, Venice maybe, in 2 days, and a bit of gift-shopping is fun too.

Maybe you Riders miss me when I&apos;m gone....

Let me pose this question: If we are ill or have broken a leg,do we go to a physician for healing,or do we diagnose,prescribe,medicate and mend ourselves? Even if we do&quot;doctor&quot;ourselves,did we study medicine beforehand?Go to medical school? Or did we set out on our own to re-discover all the principles of medicine?

In every field we rely on the understanding and authority of others. Unless we are bound and determined to&quot;re-invent the wheel,&quot;we stand on each others shoulders and rely on others who have more experience in accomplishing what,we too, hope to accomplish.

Why should the spiritual life be any different?

Yes,The Kingdom of Heaven is within each of us. Yes,each of us has that Divine spark within to guide us fully into the Kingdom. But are we going to refuse the help of those who have gone on before us,those who know the way and are willing to guide and assist us on the way?

Dear Charlotte,

Have a great trip! I&apos;m not sure how many Orthodox Churches there are where you will be going? I&apos;ll be interested to see what you discover on your journey! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Aug 18, 2009, 11:23am

Thank You! Where I am going is 95% Roman Catholic, 5% Protestant, I would guess, we had only one Family of the latter Religion. Bavaria is predominantly RC, though I&apos;m sure in cities such as Munich there are Orthodox Churches.

We usually go out to diner with friends of my Sister and her Husband, then I&apos;ll solicit opinions apropos Orthodoxy. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised being told Orthodoxy is&quot;old fashioned&quot;and&quot;strange&quot;, belonging to Greece and Russia etc. The irony is that it is both, but not the way they think of it. Who knows, maybe they had a change of Mind, albeit I don&apos;t see how since none of this group is particularely interested in Religion or history other than run-of-the-mill.

Have two more definitions according to Orthodoxy

Heart (kardia)

&quot;The heart is a biblical word little understood these days, yet it has a truly profound dimension. The heart is where union with God may be consummated: as such as has a spiritual dimension. More than an emotional centre or physical organ, the heart is a receptacle for all good and evil. The heart is our psychosomatic centre, the deepest and most profound part of our being; it is the&quot;inner man;&quot;out of which the energies of the psyche issue forth. There is a close connection between the nous, the psyche, the heart, and the&quot;inner man.&quot;

It may be why we say&quot;in my heart of heart&apos;s I believe this, or know this&quot;, and I&apos;m convinced the heart as here defined is the reason the Egyptians left it alone in the body. Mr. Hall taught that when an evil thought came to the Mind, we should by our Integrity transform it and give it out as good.

Repentance

Repentance means a change of heart, a change of mind - its literal meaning is a change of nous (i.e. meta- nous). Repentance is more than regret ot contrition; it requires a fundamental change of life.

&quot;Christ tells us that the path approaching the Kingdom of God is repentance. A more accurate translation of Matthew 4:17, is&quot;Keep repenting for the Kingdom is at hand;&quot;in other words, not once but continually. We must continually re-direct ourselves, until we achieve life&apos;s objective -union with God- as such repentance is a mystery. 

&quot;Repentance is not legalistic; i.e. if a penance is given during confession by the spiritual confessor, this will be purely for therapeuthic reasons, whose aim is to clear the nous and the heart from sin.&quot;

The Kingdom being&quot;at hand&quot;when approaching it, in prayer, rather than the Kingdom is at hand time-wise, gives an entirely different understanding, to me anyway, and contemplating the Icons, or even a glance walking by them, re-direct the Mind at once, it goes back to other concerns, still, the Icon left an inprint as a pencil would make through maybe seven layers of paper, methinks.

The crown of creation

What makes human beings different than the animals?

Although animals have a limited form of soul which animates and gives them life,the soul of a human being is created to be like that of the angels.

We are the only creatures who,not only have the ability to know and communicate with their creator,like the angels,but have the ability to share in God&apos;s Divine energies,to be partakers of the Divine nature and to become entirely one with God as the Lord Himself prays for us,&quot;I in them and thou in me,that they may be made perfect in one.&quot;John 17:23

Thus,we are the crown of creation and,as such, we have the greatest influence and impact on all the rest of creation by the choices we make.We have been given dominion over all of creation which carries with it a responsibility to maintain the balance and harmony of all of creation,which is met together in one interdependent whole.

All life is sacred and interconnected. Each human being is created to be like God,to be a temple of God,to be the crown of creation.

Once we realize our true potential as human beings it will change how we look at ourselves ,at each other and at all living things. It will give us the incentive we need to shake off the state of &apos;&quot;Diminished capacity&quot;which we labor under and is the source of all of our ills.

If we wish to regain our original&quot;Likeness&quot;to God, Then becoming an Orthodox Christian can help us to do that. If,on the other hand,we have other goals in life besides this,then,perhaps, Orthodoxy is not for us.

Dear Don, Steven, Members and Guests,

I will be leaving this evening and returning the 28th, God willing. Needless to say that I&apos;ll miss this, our little corner in cyberspace, somewhat secret akin to Orthodoxy, but found by those who are tired of the seemingly endless circularity of questions and unsatisfactury answers to where do we come from, why are we here, and where are we going.

Perhaps in my absence, as was usualy the case, a member or guest will have some comments, or Don himself might have more to say.

My long time Friend Don, you seem to be disappointed with me, rather my meta-noia, change of Heart, but you have read my stuff long enough, and also from our personal conversations many years ago, to know, that it was not that big of a change, it just took a powerful impulse from Steven to reign in the disparate strands of all I have learned, and other things as well, to see the Knot of origin, from the vine/rebe to the Divine. I hope we can raise a glass of Wine upon my return, and if all else fails, we may hear the exulted words of the Divine Poet:

Within my bosom&apos;s barred chest are stored
Riches more worth than fabled Ethiop&apos;s rents,
And in my mind&apos;s realm I am single lord
Of fairer lands than all earth&apos;s continents:
Troves of Golconda, mines of Potosi,
That over-blaze the equinoctial noon,
Gem-brimmed jugs, piled pearls of Orient sea,
Pactolus&apos; sands with glittering ores bestrewn,
Garths of sweet flowers where bees the year-long browse,
Green isles engarced in oceans hyaline,
And woods upon whose never autumned boughs,
Hang golden fruits full-orbed with honied wine

Yet these spare figures tell not half the sum
Of what Love holds in her fair christendom.

Good tidings and love to All

Greetings on the Feast of the Transfiguration!

 http://www.abcgallery.com/I/icons/theophanes5.JPG 

My family and I spent the Feast up at the Monastery in Platina.Our last celebration with Fr.Gerasim as Abbot before he ships off to seminary and then on to become Bishop of Alaska.

The Feast of the Transfiguration is one of my very Favorites! Three years ago,my family and I were fortunate enough to celebrate it on Mt.Tabor itself,in Israel. That was really something else altogether!

This Feast goes to the very heart of our Deification in Christ. We are made,not only to participate directly in God&apos;s Divine energies,but to be&quot;Partakers of the Divine nature,&quot;and even,to become entirely and intimately one with God,while at the same time,retaining our own unique,individual perspective and personality. This is the aim of our Orthodox Faith.

To any one who may feel called to these same ends,we issue this invitation:&quot;Come one,Come all.&quot;

A SPLENDID TIME IS GUARANTEED FOR ALL!

What is required of us to have a genuine spiritual life? What degree of commitment must we have?

The only requirement for a genuine spiritual life is,first of all, for us to remember God,that God actually exists. And secondly,to remember that,when we leave this world,at the moment of our death,it is not the end of our life,but rather,the beginning of another life where we will reap what we have sown here in this life.

It is only when we forget these two things that we become senseless and begin to make the wrong choices. Re: The Secret of the Universe

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Aug 27, 2009, 2:02pm

Here is a copy of an e-mail I wrote for my friend Cathy who asked me about,&quot;Life after death&quot;

Every culture throughout history has held a belief in life after death.Not until the 19th century did the nihilists come up with this idea that after death there is nothing-we simply cease to exist altogether.To me,at least,this makes no sense whatsoever and would make this one,short life quite arbitrary and pointless.

Throughout the history of the Church there have been countless examples of those who have&quot;died&quot;appearing to those who are still alive,sometimes arrayed in a heavenly light,performing miracles for them and giving them information that they would not otherwise be able to find out. For example,many martyrs appeared to the living to tell them where their bodies could be found which were subsequently dug up and Churches were built over the spot.

St.Spyridon,who lived in the 2nd century,had a daughter named Irene.A woman came to her and entrusted her with several golden ornaments for safekeeping while she went on a far journey,which she hid for her. Soon after this she reposed,not having told anyone where the ornaments had been hidden. The woman returned and,discovering that Irene had passed away,asked st.spyridon where her valuables were? St.spyridon told her that he was sorry,but had no idea where his daughter had concealed them.The woman was so distraught,that,finally,St.Spyridon went to his daughter&apos;s grave and,addressing her as if she was still alive,asked her,&quot;Irene,my daughter,where are the ornaments entrusted to thy keeping? Upon which she appeared to him and told him where they were hidden.

The Church has always had a very close relationship with those who have passed on.This is why we have such an abiding veneration for the Saints.The Saints are not dead and gone for us,but alive and living in another world, from which they are able to intercede with God for us. Countless,countless miracles have been recorded by asking for the prayers of these Saints.

And for those whose sanctity is in question who have left this world,we pray for,recognizing the fact that our prayers for the dead can have a beneficial effect on the state which the dead find themselves in after leaving this world.There are numerous accounts of the dead appearing to their friends and relatives asking for their prayers for them to help them get to a better place than where they have arrived.

I have a whole list of people that I pray for who have died and,at least twice,while I have been praying for these people,someone from my past that I have forgotten that they have died,or even,forgotten entirely that I even knew them,would appear before my mind&apos;s eye as if to say,&quot;Hey! What about me?&quot;After which,naturally,I have added them to my list...(And once I had been praying for one of my high school buddies who I found out wasn&apos;t dead yet. I called him up and told him that I had him on the wrong list and he replied,&quot;At least I was on some list!&quot;)

My mother and I always had a very close telepathic relationship.I could always feel her thinking about me and I would call her on the phone. Sometimes,I would feel her thinking about me,but I just wouldn&apos;t feel like calling her until a week or two later and she would say,&quot;Where have you been? I&apos;ve been beaming you for the past two weeks!&quot;

When my brother called me in Hawaii,to tell me that my mom was in the hospital and they didn&apos;t think she was going to live,I immediately started praying for her. I felt like I made contact with her and that she had only been waiting for me to tune into her before she left. Within an hour,I felt her leave her body,at the exact moment she died. Since then,I have felt the same closeness with her that we shared beforehand.

We are all naturally telepathic and the life of prayer that we lead in the Church helps to bring this faculty, which we all posses,out to the surface from underneath all of the sensory stimuli with which we bury it in our day to day lives. For those who pray often,the veil between this world and the next,get&apos;s thinner and thinner until there really is no separation.

In our culture,death is taboo because we are taught to believe by the mass mind that this world and this short life is all that there is.&quot;It doesn&apos;t get any better than this,so go for the gusto!&quot;However,anyone who truly wishes to learn the truth about life after death only needs to volunteer at a hospice and spend some time with those who are dying and I guarantee,they will have plenty of experiences which will convince them of the reality of life after death. Those who are dying begin to experience the state they are entering into. They are met by their loved ones who have passed away before hand with which they have strong bonds.They are met by the Saints and righteous ones with which they have developed a relationship with.They are met by Angels and,all too often,by the Demons to whom they have given a home to while they were alive.

This is why it is necessary for us to remember death.To prepare for death.To be prepared for death at any moment.Not all of us know that we have only two months left to live and have the opportunity to prepare ourselves in that time to go through transition.For most of us,death will probably come when we least expect it,so it behooves us to be ready for it at any time and ALL the time,for, the state we are found in at the moment of our death will determine our experience thereafter.

Have you ever heard the saying that,&quot;We cannot afford the luxury of a negative thought&quot;? This is precisely why. It&apos;s not that we can&apos;t take it with us,but rather,we take it ALL with us!

Thus,NOW is our only opportunity to free ourselves of all the self-destructive psychological/emotional/spiritual baggage we carry. This is the place of the work.This life is the only one we have,right now,to perfect ourselves. And here&apos;s where you come in. People need help getting free of the garbage that plagues them.They need help getting free of it NOW,before they die so they don&apos;t have to experience the effects of their ills in a world where there is no time and space or the laws of physics to buffer them from their own creations.

You have the ability and the God-given talents to do this work.to not only help people in this world,but to be a midwife for them to be born into the next,if only you begin to see it and yourself clearly.

Which,as I have said before,I have the utmost confidence in your ability to do so.

Whew! Quite a long epistle.But one that I hope will prove helpful and to the point!

Yours,

Not sure if it was addressed to me Steven but I have found my own path and a belief in Saints and such being more in tune than me just doesn&apos;t fit. Here is a website where it will all be explained: The Game of Life 

I repeat we are all becoming God ... all of us and no church or saint or bishop or pope or anything is needed to get us there.

Dear Don,
I will gladly check out the game of life site.

Why is it strange to think that there are others who are more accomplished,or have accomplished already what we too hope to accomplish?

You have written that,&quot;No Church or Saint or Bishop or pope or anything is needed to get us there.&quot;

To which I agree.&quot;NEEDED&quot;, being the optimal word. Needed? No. The assistance they offer welcomed? Yes.

Are you trying to tell me that NO ONE ELSE will be involved in helping you along on this path you have found? You have discovered it and will be walking along on it all by yourself? Hmm.Interesting!

&quot;We are all becoming God.&quot;Is there a method that you will be using to become God? Or will it just happen on it&apos;s own?

If there is a means of&quot;Becoming God,&quot;has anyone used this means before? Is there anyone we can look at and say,&quot;Yes! I want to accomplish what this person has accomplished! I will follow in the way that this person points to.

This is the role that the Saints play for us in the Church. They are examples and guides for us along the way. They can show us the way,but no one can walk it for us but ourselves.

Is there no one like this on this path you have found for yourself? Someone you can look up to and who will show you the way? Re: The Secret of the Universe

Hi ren ...

You and most believe there is&quot;life&quot;after&quot;death&quot;. You believe that we were created by&quot;God&quot;and placed in Eden here on earth and then due to whatever we were banished to live out our existence in pain and suffering. And you do not find this vengeful ?

Regardless I still find it impossible to think why we were simply not allowed to go straight to Heaven. Why did&quot;God&quot;not simply create us in heaven ? Why this seemingly pointless 70 to 80 year diversion here on this planet. For that matter why only 70 to 80 years ? Why not 10,000 years ? Time is of course immaterial to a God.

ren The Illuminati believe that this is a prison forced upon us by an unknown force, The Demiurge. You believe we live, then die then live again. The Illuminati believe ( I think ) that all is illusion and once we overcome the illusion of the material we will understand that we are simply truly spiritual. You believe this universe of the material was created by a benevolent God they believe exactly the opposite and I also hold to that view. They hold that the true God, our higher self does not and can not exist in this material plain of existence.

So ren we are not at all on the same side. And to try to insinuate that I will be going it alone and that the teachers of The Illuminati are the same as priests is a typical plan of your kind. I had teachers in school are they the same as priests ?

I have studied and watched religion for many years and have read and studied many of them. Christianity IS NOT AND NEVER WILL BE a viable solution for me. Regardless I will longer debate these things with yourself or Charlotte. We are on opposite sides of the battle and only one of us will prevail. An end is coming but it will not be real. Those who know it is not real will survive. Those who do not will start over again.

Memento holds many answers. ren we are becoming&quot;God&quot;. God is not outside of us. He or it did not create us for we have always been. We are on a quest to find our Holy Grail after our tongues were scrambled by most probably The Demiurge. We are immortal and spiritual ( whatever that really means). We need no one to worship or look up to or kiss the hand of or get sprinkled by holy water from. May I suggest you watch as more and more is revealed on their website.

Dear Don,

I do not mean to insinuate that you will be alone. I sincerely want to know who has trod this path you have chosen before? Who are some former Illuminati who have attained enlightenment so that we may examine their lives to see if what they profess to believe really works. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Hi ren ...

Because of the very nature of their organization they are, and shall be I suppose forever, nameless. But if I were to have one guess I would hazard that guess on the fact that one Sir Francis Bacon would be a good choice.

And of course there could be Poussin, Teniers, Da Vinci , Albrecht Durer, The Van Eycks and many of the personalities I have already studied.

But again always tempering all of this with the thought that all of them could be just mementos left by&quot;us&quot;in our search of who we are.

Greeting One and All,

I have missed this Home, my solitary world here, and the Divine Poet

Like as the mariner that homeward bound
Outbraves the blusterous beat of boreal blasts,
And while alarms less hopeful souls confound,
Sings with light heart neath tempest-shuddering masts;
So when my fortune&apos;s barque on life&apos;s wide main,
Brunts stubborn gales o&apos;er deeps of perilous foam,
My fainting heart fond thoughts of thee sustain,
Who art of all its hopes sole port and home;
Then can I breast full-sailed want&apos;s bitter wind,
And bolts of grief that weaker craft subdue,
And ride high-powered o&apos;er fates unkind,
And friends found false and deptors proved untrue.

Whereso I roam thou still my port must be,
And every ill be good that leads to thee.

Thank you Steven, yes I had a good time, more on that later.

I read some of the discussions between you and Don on the Illuminate and Illumination, and, Don, I appreciate you including Sir Francis Bacon as one of the Illuminate, and perhaps many shall be forever nameless due to the nature of the Organization.

But Don, Francis is not one of the so-called Illuminate, as I said many times before, Francis, under whatever name he wrote, is beyond any such designation, and he is Shakespeare, unfathonable by the most learned scholars, safe a few able to see His Luminous Soul beneath the multi-layered letters.

One can study such personalities as you named till blue in the face, as Fern had it,&quot;but again always tempering all of this with the thought that all of them could be just mementos left by&quot;us&quot;in our search who we are.&quot;Maybe you meant momentos left by&quot;them&quot;for&quot;us&quot;....

I also read something about the Masons as well as other Organizations who keep their secrets, and as Albert Pike wrote that they mislead those who deserve to be mislead, and&quot;those who are easily discouraged don&apos;t deserve encouragement&quot;, Mr. Hall had it. All Illuminated persons employ&quot;blinders.&quot;

I read some of the OWO and agree, have to read more.

One sentence stood out, I think from Hegel,&quot;the absolute idea is pure thought about pure thought.&quot;This is akin to touching your fingertip with your fingertip. Pure thought is Presence, no thought. The reason highly intellectual people go insane because they can&apos;t stop thinking about thinking what cannot be understood by thought.

Read some about Weishaupt who came up a while ago, there are two movements Illuminate, one known to a good part, of the other you can walk by a member on the street and you will never recognize them, as Francis said in New Atlantis, we know you but you don&apos;t know us.

I had a feeling, actually I knew, that the kissing of the hand of His Grace Bishop Maxim would not sit well with you, Don, but you see, it is not kissing the hand, but the Blessing it bestows, the hand being in that position.

Have to run.

Charlotte

Thank you for the songs, Steven, it can never stop or fade away. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Aug 30, 2009, 5:57pm

I hope everyone is having a good weekend!

Re-reading this morning the word exchange between Steven and Don, and quite a bit of the links you, Don, gave, I can&apos;t say that I found something new in what the Illuminate write, save some of their interpretations concerning varying subjects. I agree with some of their statements, as does Christianity in general, and Orthodoxy as far as I know it by now, which they denigrade in part&quot;for they understand it not&quot;, (Elizabeth I) as to the latter. Perhaps the language also has to do with it.

The Illuminate Awaken...

&quot;The Illuminate encourage skepticism&quot;, so does Orthodoxy as reiterated by Steven.&quot;We do not seek sheep. We seek those who can apply their critical faculties and see beyond the delusions of old, false religions.&quot;Neither does Orthodoxy seek sheep as I found out very quickly, being ignored for all the right reasons, having to show, so to speak, welch Geistes Kind I am, as one has to in applying for any job or admittance to any worthy Order, for in the latter it is better to know nothing than little or half. I think the wisdom of Pythagoras, whom the Illuminate call their first Grand Master.

The seeking those with critical faculties is a big stumbling block here between you and me, Don, for I don&apos;t see much, but beyond what they see.&quot;Illumination - the ancient religion of the Illuminate - is not for believers who place blind faith in absurd gods and prophets.&quot;I am not one of those the way they see it, and then they&quot;lump&quot;(favorite word of my Phi-Teacher) Jehovah, Allah, and Christ together. Jehovah is an Elohim, Allah is the One God of Islam, and Christ is the&quot;son&quot;of the One God.&quot;When the real nature of God is understood, all the mysteries of life fall into place.&quot;No argument from me, for when the real nature of God is understood we are God.&quot;ren&quot;, you say,&quot;we are becoming&quot;God&quot;. God is not outside of us.&quot;I nod, and Steven, pardon me, has said this all along, and in better language, states:

&quot;We are made, not only to participate directly in God&apos;s Divine energies, but to be&quot;Partakers of the nature,&quot;even more, to become intirely and intimately one with God, while at the same time, retaining our own unique, individual perspective and personality. This is the aim of our Orthodox Faith.&quot;

This I know to be true because I have been in that State, not because anyone says so. No one in their Heart of Hearts can believe anyone elses believes,&quot;it&apos;s a hand me down&quot;says Jerry, and not accepted by our own Divinity, no matter how sincerely we want to believe it, it&apos;s why people in Churches have blank faces listening to their Preachers. Even the sheep fall asleep. Doubting is hard-wired in us, the adversary, Seth the Bringer of Storms from the desert, and the Bell ringing loud and clear disperses the last and least grain of sand&quot;which must become a Star&quot;, says Mr. Hall. That is what one can call Eternity. When all is said and done, Don, we are not on opposite sides of a&quot;battle&quot;, where one side will survive, must be a win-win situation no matter which way you go. You wouldn&apos;t fight me, would you? 

The Best at the End

Father Ceko celebrated the Divine Liturgy today, missed His Grace Bishop Maxim, last Sunday. Words of St. Paul were read, Father Ceko touched upon the wedding of Cana, of which there is a beautiful painting in the Church, viz., a young Mary with a wreath in her hair pouring water and Christ bending and blessing Her and the jars with a smile, the wedding guests waiting because&quot;my hour had not come.&quot;Truly....

Father Ceko read from the Holy Gospel of Matthew:

&quot;At that time, a young man came to Jesus and said,&quot;Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?&quot;So He said to him,&quot;Why do you call me Good? No one is good but One, that is God. But if you want to enter life eternal, keep the commandments.&quot;He said to Him,&quot;Which ones?&quot;Jesus said,&quot;&apos;You shall not murder,&apos; &apos;You shall not commit adultery,&apos; &apos;You shall not steal,&apos; &apos;You shall not bear false witness,&apos; &apos;Honor your father and mother,&apos; and, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.&quot;&apos;

&quot;The young man said to Him,&quot;All these things I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?&quot;Jesus said to him,&quot;If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.&quot;But when the young man heard that saying, he was sorrowful, for he had great possessions. Then Jesus said to his disciples,&quot;Assuredly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. When his disciples heard it, they were greatly astonished, saying,&quot;Who can be saved?&quot;But Jesus looked at them and said to them,&quot;With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.&quot;

And that was the main message of Father Ceko today, tied in with the&quot;Dormation of the Holy Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary&quot;, who was greatly celebrated today.

&quot;In giving birth you preserved your virginity! In falling asleep you did not forsake the world, O Theotokos! You wre translated to Life, O Mother of Life, and by your prayers deliver our souls from death.

&quot;On this day You did rise from the tomb, O Merciful One, leading us from the gates of death. On this day Adam rejoices; with the prophets and the patriarchs they unceasingly praise the divine majesty of Your power!

&quot;Neither the tomb, nor death could hold the Theotokos, who is in constant prayer and our firm hope in her intersessions. For being the Mother of Life, she was translated to life by the One who dwelt in her virginal womb.

&quot;The angels were struck with wonder as they looked upon the dormation of the Virgin; seeing how the virgin went up from earth to heaven. The limits of nature are overcome in You, O Pure Virgin: for birthgiving remains virginal and life is united to death! A Virgin after childbearing and alive after death! You ever save Your inheritence, O Theotokos.&quot;

Father Ceko then remarked with a smile, how can this be possible as a Virgin cannot give birth, and emphasised twice more with great enthusiasm that&quot;with man this is not possible, but with God all things are possible, and the Faith it takes to believe that all things are possible with God.&quot;I remember reading years ago that all things are possible with God, only one word was different, and though it was on the net, I could&quot;hear&quot;the voice and manner of speaking of the gentleman, almost see him, and knew it was true. Such sublime experiences stay alive forever.

The Icon of the Dormation of The Theotokos shows Christ holding His Mother as She holds Him as a Child. &apos;This a great Mystery,&quot;The Orthodox Church just isn&apos;t like anything we have been exposed to here in the west that tries to pass itself off as Christianity.&quot;

The Divine Poet has a beautiful passage about this Mystery, I will find it. And how is it that I am moved to tears during both the Matins and Divine Liturgy, most assuredly not because I blindly believe like a sheep something a Priest or Saint says. I&apos;m defending myself again, Don, and try to explain what&apos;s become of me and in such a seemingly short time, so we can be friends, and perchance get at least one . Or maybe&quot;fat chance&quot;, but it&apos;s a Grand and bigger than Life story, and no chance of ever fading away.

Love

Charlotte

 Re: The Secret of the Universe

No Charlotte I wouldn&apos;t fight you but I do not accept nor believe in Christianity at all and this is a problem to the way we used to be on the same wavelength. I have always felt alien to this planet and now perhaps it is because I do not even belong to this reality. It is hard to say and even harder to put into words.

Our minds expanding and thus creating a larger and larger universe. From the view of Herodotus http://z.about.com/d/ancienthistory/1/0/X/M/2/HerodotusWorldMap.jpg and his vision of the world to the universe approaching it&apos;s ultimate limit of 14.137 billion light years. The world and The Universe as we perceive and measure it has been expanding in a direct proportion to our mind&apos;s growth. The quest is to realize that we are spirit, that all is illusion and that if we try, if we try very, very hard we should be able to control the matter around us and make it into anything we want. In our dreams and the dream world this is indeed what we do. No limits in our dreams we can be anything we want and we can go anywhere we choose. I agree with the Illuminati when they say this material world we inhabit is a prison. The Eden we were banished from was our spiritual realm. I think I nailed it when I said when&quot;eating&quot;from&quot;The Tree of Knowledge&quot;we did not gain knowledge ...BUT LOST IT !!! We were tricked out of our Eden, our spiritual world, and we not only became trapped but we forgot who and what we were. The cycle plays out every 4.5 billion years. From simple single element&apos;s, to the building of the complex molecules to the&quot;creation&apos; of&quot;The Man&quot;it always repeats over and over and over again but as in the movie Memento I believe that we leave ourselves clues or&quot;mementos&quot;as we journey through this 4.5 billion year cycle and when we have left ourselves enough clues we find the answer and&quot;The Truth&quot;. This may be my zillionth trip through but I think I have finally deciphered enough of the mementos to break the chains of this prison. We shall see. However I sense that I am getting close to being&quot;free&quot;.

And Charlotte it may all be taking place in our minds. A zillion trips through a 4.5 billion year cycle and it all is occurring in but a blink of an eye.

And Charlotte no holy water ... and no kissing of any ring.

Charlotte,you have anticipated exactly what I was going to say today:&quot;This I know to be true because I have been in that state,not because anyone says so.&quot;

I became a Christian on my own,Not because of anything anyone said to me or I had read. I found myself being ushered into that state and realized that I was being ushered in by someone,whom I somehow knew to be Jesus. I wrote in my journal afterwards,&quot;Decided to become a Christian today.&quot;

It wasn&apos;t till later that I found others of a like mind who had a similar experience with whom I felt at home and went on to discover Orthodoxy together with.

And Don,as you say here,: If we try very,very hard,we should be able to control the matter around us and make it into anything we want.&quot;

This is exactly what I have been saying from my very first post, except that we don&apos;t even have to try, and it&apos;s not any kind of&quot;Illusion&quot;It&apos;s how it already works! The material world isn&apos;t inherently flawed, it works exactly as it was designed to. It&apos;s entirely malleable and takes on the impression of whatever is introduced to it. Kind of like silly putty.

If the world seems like an evil prison to us it&apos;s because we have made it that way.

&quot;Morbious,that thing out there. It&apos;s you.&quot;

The end product of Orthodoxy is a soul that is restored to it&apos;s original blessed state in a resurrected body in a re-created cosmos.
And we can begin to live in a foretaste of that final consummation in the here and now. It&apos;s all a matter of how conscious we become of how things are already.

Don,I can understand entirely why you feel that you could never become a Christian. But the truth of the matter is that you have never encountered Christianity in it&apos;s pure and undistorted form ever before.

And the fact is,I&apos;m not even suggesting that you should,necessarily. I would be satisfied if you could find it in your heart just to accept the possibility that it might work for me? Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by admin on Aug 31, 2009, 6:37am

 ... The end product of Orthodoxy is a soul that is restored to it&apos;s original blessed state in a resurrected body in a re-created cosmos. ... 

And I would ask why are we not created in that reality in the first place ? Why and how and for what purpose were we wrested from this&quot;blessed state&quot;?

 ... But the truth of the matter is that you have never encountered Christianity in it&apos;s pure and undistorted form ever before. ... 

Jesus as the son of god ? Died for our sins ? As atonement for sins carried out by flawed created entities of and by a God who messed up the creation yet still felt it necessary to punish his creations ? The one who threw us out of Eden ? The one who continues to allow millions of murders and deaths and suffering ? Is this the God you wish me to believe in ? The one who sent his son to act out a play of his death as a symbolic gesture since he really couldn&apos;t die. So really what is the point of all of this. Why did the two of them simply not stop the suffering ?

And I repeat why only 70 - 80 years ? Why not 10,000 ?

Sorry ren it may work for you but it is still a flawed premise and in reality, in my opinion but a fairytale.

Post by renwdimgink on Aug 31, 2009, 9:53am

Ah, but we were created in that reality in the first place. That&apos;s why it&apos;s called&quot;Our ORIGINAL Blessed State.&quot;

Why and how and for what purpose were we wrested from this Blessed state? Simple. God wanted equals,not puppets or slaves,thus we were endowed with freedom of will and given one commandment,not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Orthodox Theology is quite clear on this point. If our first-created parents had believed God more than they believed the serpent,(Whom God allowed into the garden in order to see which way our free will would incline,otherwise,how could there be any real freedom of will if there were no choices to make?) They would have been raised up DIRECTLY into the Kingdom of Heaven without having to go through this detour of this limited framework of time/space and the laws of physics where we now find ourselves.

God cast us out of the garden,not as a punishment,(As the caricatures of Christianity mistakenly teach,) but out of love for us.

There was another tree in the garden as well as the tree of knowledge of good and evil,the tree of life, which would have conferred immortality upon us, confirming us in our present fallen state which would have been the worst malady possible. So,instead we are placed in this limited framework where we can do less damage to ourselves while we learn from experience to freely choose the good,the true and the beautiful.

The material world of time/space and the laws of physics is not inherently flawed or a prison as the Gnostics taught, but simply an environment that reflects back to us our own inner state. It is not a place of suffering to punish us for our sins. It is a place where we can experience a foretaste of either Heaven or Hell,(sometimes both within moments of each other...) And, above all, it is a place where we can CHANGE our minds. This is it&apos;s great value for us. We can learn from our mistaken use of our own free will here. And yes,God will continue to allow whatever we freely choose.

It is not a place meant for suffering or punishment at all. It is a place for THE GREAT WORK to be done. (And, as we all know, the great work must be done.)

Dear ren ...

I thought you said yours was different. It is as childish as it was when I was growing up.

On the same side ? I don&apos;t think we are even in the same universe.

For your perusal:

 Illumination teaches that God is not the creator of the universe. The opposite is true. The universe is creating God. God is the telos - the object, the purpose - of the evolving, Becoming universe. All of the astonishing conclusions of Illumination flow from this single truth.

Post by renwdimgink on Aug 31, 2009, 11:25am

Where did the universe come from which is in the process of creating God? Out of nothing-it is constantly becoming-coming into being. Where does the pattern for it&apos;s coming into being come from? Where is mind in all of this matter coming into being? This is the true God who we seek to be in relationship with-the God of consciousness.

Everything mike says about god in this chapter is exactly what I have expressed in everything i&apos;ve written here. God wants equals not puppets. He wishes us to join him,to partake of Godness. God is a mentor,a guide,a friend. The true God is seeking those among us who are capable of becoming gods too, (Which,as far as Orthodoxy is concerned,is everyone,not some chosen elite.)

&quot;God already exists at a level of perfection that can be equated with Christan...conceptions-a CONSCIOUSNESS of surpassing intelligence and power.&quot;

This is exactly what Orthodoxy professes. This idea of&quot;Pure being,&quot;along with all his other weird ideas about Christianity, are someone else&apos;s conception of what Christianity is supposed to be about,NOT what Orthodox Christians believe.

Don&apos;t make the same mistake that everyone else in western civilization makes of lumping together the Orthodox with the roman catholic and protestant denominations. There is Orthodox Christianity and there are a bunch of distorted caricatures of Christianity.

As far as I&apos;m concerned,most of our&quot;Differences&quot;are a matter of semantics and different interpretations of the same things.

Of course,as far as the gnostics are concerned,heads is tails,isn&apos;t it?

Post by renwdimgink on Aug 31, 2009, 11:41am

For myself though,the main thing is this experience that Charlotte mentioned, of a state of being where we are one with God while at the same time retaining our own unique,individual perspective. Once a person has experienced that,they are never the same again. And, the thing about it is, it&apos;s not like some kind of new experience that we are evolving to at all. It is like remembering, suddenly something we have forgotten, something so incredible that we can&apos;t believe that we could have forgotten it! Something we have been looking for our whole life, in every place,in every thing, in every one. And once we remember, there is nothing we want more than to remain in that state of being forever, to grow more and more deeply into it.

THIS is the essence of Orthodox spirituality. Orthodoxy is a means of inducing that state of being and making it permanent.

We are not becoming God, we are REMEMBERING our oneness with God which already exists.

Is God the chicken or the egg? Does it matter? Perhaps we can approach the same thing from either direction? Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Aug 31, 2009, 11:51am

I&apos;m glad you finally addressed me, Don. Considering our friendship, I was as much disappointed of you giving me the cold shoulder as you were with my meta noia, so in a light-hearted way we&apos;re even. Sure wish you weren&apos;t so unyielding, not as far as Christianity per se is concerned, that is your business, rather in terms of congenial conversation, as &apos;holding in suspension&apos; what we speak about, whether we agree or disagree, rather than a&quot;no&quot;or&quot;yes&quot;.

We are on the same wavelenght and agree on many things, sometimes only expessed differently, as I see Steven, pardon me, has pointed out, nevertheless, I like to add my 2 cents worth.

It is not their own and I will demonstate why not when I have time.

We have agreed, no objection raised by you, that Orthodoxy is the best kept secret in Christiandom and the world, so we may call it a Mystery Religion, not because it is not well known, but because it&apos;s Mysteries are not revealed,&quot;we will not speak of Thy Mysteries....&quot;, revealed only in the&quot;Forcing House&quot;in the silence of individual&apos;s Heart. Underneath all I wrote yesterday from the Gospel of Matthew and The Theotokos ever Virgin Mother is the Luminous Soul of the Church and her Mystery.

What the Illuminate call their True God and their true religion has much in common with Orthodoxy, only, the&quot;Personality&quot;of the Illuminate is, or has become schizophrenic being filtered by its interpreters. Science will have&quot;parallel Universe&apos;&quot;, so do the Illuminate, and for that matter the NWO. Objectively, as the World turns, there are two Illuminate, the unknown Illuminated, which members, as I said yesterday, you wouldn&apos;t know if you walked by them on a street, and the Organization under consideration here, and two NWOs, Power and Politics, and the True one of Sir Francis Bacon. There are so many things I want to add, alas....

We are on the same wavelenght in many ways. For one, both of us have always felt that we are&quot;aliens on this planet&quot;, your words,&quot;I touched the ground only slightly&quot;, and Orthodoxy states&quot;we are pilgrims on this Earth.&quot;

What is the difference between&quot;we were tricked from Eden, our spiritual world, and we not only became trapped but we forgot who and what we are&quot;, and Steven&apos;s, pardon me, affirming all along this yarn in so many ways&quot;that we are ALREADY clairvoyant wonder-workers who suffer from amnesia. That true enlightenment consists of simply remembering who and what we really are.&quot;The&quot;miracle worker&quot;of the Illuminate is Pythagoras, good choice. Who&quot;tricked&quot;us out of Eden? Jehovah? I don&apos;t think so.

What is the difference of the aim of Orthodoxy restoring us to our original state blessed state with God and all of Creation, and in your words, and without wholly unnecessary nitpicking,&quot;Eden, our spiritual home - we are spirits.&quot;

In our confused and semi-conscious state we already control&quot;plastic&quot;matter around us and make it into anything we want. In our invironment, Silly-putty might be better, I&apos;m not going there but can&apos;t suppress a smile.

What is the difference between regaining our&quot;Likeness to God&quot;, and&quot;ren, we are becoming&quot;God&quot;? Then, no trying is necessary,&quot;it&apos;s as easy as women&apos;s work&quot;, says Eugene Philalethes. Wonder what exactly the great Welch meant by that.

If I come to Canada next year, would thou be a Cavalier Gallant and kiss my ring?

One thing I do know for sure, from my own experience, is that, the more conscious we are of our oneness with God, the more immediately matter responds to the touch of our consciousness. What we INTEND comes into being. And when we are fully conscious, what we INTEND will come into being INSTANTANEOUSLY.

This is how&quot;Miracles&quot;occur. There are no miracles,simply a higher determinism which enters into and supersedes the time/space laws of physics which we are familiar with and act as a governor and buffer for us until we are able to create at will with responsibility towards the whole.

Orthodoxy looks forward to and begins to anticipate this Divine consummation devoutly to be wished for-the mystical marriage of Heaven and Earth. May Heaven and Earth become one and the same! This is the vision of Orthodoxy. Not an&quot;escape from the prison of matter,&quot;but rather,the Divinization of matter altogether.

The Divine Poet&apos;s Veneration of The Theotokos

WISDOM HATH HEWED HER HOUSE: She that dwelleth alway

fashion&apos;d the nascent Earth that the energy of its life
might come to evolution in the becoming of Man,
who, as her subject, should subject all to her rule
and bring God&apos;s latest work to be a realm of delight,
So she herself, the essential Beauty of Holiness,
pass&apos;d her creative joy into the creature&apos;s heart,
to take back from his hand her adoration robes
and royal crown of his imagination and Love,

And when she had made of men lovers and worshippers,
these vied to enshrine her godhead in enduring fanes
and architecture of stone, that high her pensive towers
might hallow their throng&apos;d cities and, transfeaturing
Nature&apos;s wilding landscape to the impress of her Mind,
comfort man&apos;s mortality with immortal grace.

Hi Charlotte

 I&apos;m glad you finally addressed me, Don. Considering our friendship, I was as much disappointed of you giving me the cold shoulder as you were with my meta noia, so in a light-hearted way we&apos;re even. Sure wish you weren&apos;t so unyielding, not as far as Christianity per se is concerned, that is your business, rather in terms of congenial conversation, as &apos;holding in suspension&apos; what we speak about, whether we agree or disagree, rather than a&quot;no&quot;or&quot;yes&quot;. 

Don&apos;t you see it or get it? Things HAVE changed ! We are NOT on the same wavelength anymore. You believe in a virgin birth and&quot;God&quot;sacrificing his child in a great show definitely worthy of Broadway and a million other absurdities that I will never accept. I know never say never but it is not in the cards. And what of your Ancient Egyptians ? Where do they now fit into all of this. The pharaoh with his crowns of the upper and lower self. Did you hear what ren said. Good heavens he believes in the fairytale of the tree of good and evil. And we are being punished for disobeying this&quot;God&quot;of yours. Charlotte would you like me to send you some coffee ?

 We are on the same wavelength and agree on many things, sometimes only expressed differently, as I see Steven, pardon me, has pointed out, nevertheless, I like to add my 2 cents worth.
 
I agree we used to agree on many things but we have drifted way apart. Things like this happen. I guess the waves of my tsunamis&apos; and your&quot;studies&quot;have pulled us apart. I hope you can reconcile your new found beliefs with the Ancients for they were not Christians. And what of all the people of The Neolithic, do they have a place in your reality now ? Or are they coming back to try again as the Jehovah Witness&apos; teach.

 In today&apos;s post you speak of Jesus the son of God, suffering and dying for our salvation, what is the point of it all etc., in the same manner as do the Illuminate of such&quot;absurdeties.&quot;They make much ado about&quot;revealed religions&quot;and&quot;mystery religion&quot;, which latter they call the true and their own. It is not their own and I will demonstate why not when I have time. 

The Illuminati teach the things we used to talk about. Of higher self and mysteries of the mind not some idiotic belief in a son of god and eating of the tree of good and evil. You claim their beliefs are not their own and regardless on what basis you intend to prove this since neither of us know exactly what they truly believe and are able to do, it is mere speculation

 We have agreed, no objection raised by you, that Orthodoxy is the best kept secret in Christiandom and the world, so we may call it a Mystery Religion, not because it is not well known, but because it&apos;s Mysteries are not revealed,&quot;we will not speak of Thy Mysteries....&quot;, revealed only in the&quot;Forcing House&quot;in the silence of individual&apos;s Heart. Underneath all I wrote yesterday from the Gospel of Matthew and The Theotokos ever Virgin Mother is the Luminous Soul of the Church and her Mystery. 

I did not comment because I felt it not worthy of a response. I will never agree to what you and ren propose. The word Christendom itself can not be accepted by me so how could a secret by it ever be of any value.

 What the Illuminate call their True God and their true religion has much in common with Orthodoxy, only, the&quot;Personality&quot;of the Illuminate is, or has become schizophrenic being filtered by its interpreters. Science will have&quot;parallel Universe&apos;&quot;, so do the Illuminate, and for that matter the NWO. Objectively, as the World turns, there are two Illuminate, the unknown Illuminated, which members, as I said yesterday, you wouldn&apos;t know if you walked by them on a street, and the Organization under consideration here, and two NWOs, Power and Politics, and the True one of Sir Francis Bacon. There are so many things I want to add, alas.... 

There is nothing in common Charlotte. I am impressed that you know that The Illuminati of this site are not the true Illuminati who walk by me on the street. Just curious how do you suppose they (The real Illuminated Ones) replace members who pass on ?

 We are on the same wavelength in many ways. For one, both of us have always felt that we are&quot;aliens on this planet&quot;, your words,&quot;I touched the ground only slightly&quot;, and Orthodoxy states&quot;we are pilgrims on this Earth.&quot; 

Charlotte for the umpteenth time we are not pilgrims but prisoners.

 What is the difference between&quot;we were tricked from Eden, our spiritual world, and we not only became trapped but we forgot who and what we are&quot;, and Steven&apos;s, pardon me, affirming all along this yarn in so many ways&quot;that we are ALREADY clairvoyant wonder-workers who suffer from amnesia. That true enlightenment consists of simply remembering who and what we really are.&quot;The&quot;miracle worker&quot;of the Illuminate is Pythagoras, good choice. Who&quot;tricked&quot;us out of Eden? Jehovah? I don&apos;t think so. 

Now you try to cloud the issue. I have no quarrel with your view of&quot;Eden&quot;it could indeed be similar to mine but that is not the argument here. it is Christianity. We can agree that the true enlightenment consists of remembering who we are and yes in my view it was indeed&quot;Jehovah&quot;who&quot;tricked&quot;us out of Eden

 What is the difference of the aim of Orthodoxy restoring us to our original state blessed state with God and all of Creation, and in your words, and without wholly unnecessary nitpicking,&quot;Eden, our spiritual home - we are spirits.&quot; 

We disagree on the how and the why of why we left our spiritual realm. You claim we were punished for trying to&quot;KNOW&quot;. Charlotte think about it. Your version has your God punishing you for trying to find answers and you know all religions are still like this to this very day. I wholeheartedly believe we were&quot;tricked out of&quot;this realm.

 In our confused and semi-conscious state we already control&quot;plastic&quot;matter around us and make it into anything we want. In our environment, Silly-putty might be better, I&apos;m not going there but can&apos;t suppress a smile. 

I am not even close to being privy to their secrets. I am only surmising from what they have posted on their website.

 What is the difference between regaining our&quot;Likeness to God&quot;, and&quot;ren, we are becoming&quot;God&quot;? Then, no trying is necessary,&quot;it&apos;s as easy as women&apos;s work&quot;, says Eugene Philalethes. Wonder what exactly the great Welch meant by that. 

Charlotte think of what you write. We are not like God we are not becoming&quot;like&quot;anything. we are becoming God

 If I come to Canada next year, would thou be a Cavalier Gallant and kiss my ring? 

No but I will kiss your cheek.

Post by renwdimgink on Sept 1, 2009, 10:43am

All I can think of is that Don must have been tortured by people who called themselves&quot;Christians&quot;when he was younger.

&quot;We disagree on the how and why of why we left our spiritual realm.You claim we were punished for trying to&quot;KNOW&quot;...your version has your God punishing you for trying to find answers.&quot;

Who&apos;s opinion about what Christianity supposedly teaches is this? I am pretty sure that I just explained that,first of all,we weren&apos;t being punished at all,but protected from the ever increasing potential of the mis-use of our freedom of will which we had just demonstrated,not by,&quot;Trying to KNOW,&quot;but by believing what the serpent suggested to us and taking his advice, rather than believing our creator? (Not to mention that this didn&apos;t take place in some purely spiritual realm, we already had both a soul and a body at the time...)

If this sounds like a ridiculous fairy tale,well,so do many other&quot;ridiculous fairy tales&quot;which, not only happen, but are analogies of things we experience every day.

And the main difference between the Gnostic view of things (Which,by the way,I am not being presented with here for the first time, but studied in depth many years ago and rejected as being inconsistent with my own experience of reality...) And Orthodox Theology, if you want to talk about false premises leading to untenable conclusions, is their, (to my way of thinking,) entirely incorrect and unrealistic view of the material world:&quot;The creation of a blind and idiot god,the offspring of Sophia,who creates an inherently flawed material world which becomes a prison and the cause of evil for all of us poor souls who have the misfortune of incarnating into it.&quot;And how did we end up incarnating into it in the first place? I hope we aren&apos;t being punished by God? Oh yeah.We were&quot;tricked&quot;into it by the blind god who created it who we then mistakenly took to be the&quot;REAL&quot;God.

You&apos;re right. That doesn&apos;t sound like a ridiculous fairy tale at all!

I won&apos;t even begin to go over,once again what an ongoing miracle the material world is. Suffice it to say,it&apos;s not a prison, but a mirror. And True Christianity is not a&quot;slave religion,&quot;but a religion of total personal freedom and personal RESPONSIBILITY for our own spiritual life. Maybe this is what nobody likes about it, there&apos;s no&quot;Blind god&quot;to blame for our problems.&quot;If I die and my soul get&apos;s lost,ain&apos;t nobody&apos;s fault but mine.&quot;

Mind over Matter is the key to understanding what goes on here.

We are co-creators with God. He has given us the freedom to create at will within this limited framework as an opportunity to learn how to do it well, in harmony and balance, before we are translated into a limitless realm of pure and instantaneous creativity.

If our experience in the material world is one of&quot;unending pain and suffering,&quot;WE have created the reality we then experience.

&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;says it all.&quot;The big machine. No instrumentalities. True creation. But the Krell forgot one thing. Monsters John, monsters from the ID!&quot;

We&apos;re not&quot;becoming&quot;one big amorphous god that we&apos;re all just an atom of. God is,was and always shall be. And,since the material world isn&apos;t a prison but a mirror which reflects back to us our inner state, we don&apos;t have to&quot;leave this material world,&quot;and progress to a&quot;higher level,which can&apos;t co-exist with here.&quot;We can become&quot;Like&quot;God in the here and now, BEFORE leaving this world, as the lives of the thousands of clairvoyant wonder-workers whose lives we know of and have recorded in an unbroken lineage from the Apostles to today, clearly demonstrate.

Try reading their lives and you will see just how much you and I are actually capable of.

Don&apos;t try to tell us what&quot;Our Version&quot;of reality is until you have a better understanding of what&quot;Our version&quot;actually teaches. Because it&apos;s not whatever it is that you have grown up with and think you are familiar with. I don&apos;t mind if someone doesn&apos;t believe what I believe, however, when someone condemns THEIR OPINION of what they THINK we believe when it doesn&apos;t even resemble what we believe, THAT makes me mad!

So there!

However,I heartily agree with you that most of what passes itself off as Christianity here in the west is enough to make anybody sick! No wonder it&apos;s confusing. I reiterate,for the record, that these distorted caricatures of Christianity have no resemblance or relationship to Orthodoxy from which they stepped away 1200 yrs ago.

With all due respect,

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Sept 1, 2009, 1:15pm

Two surprises were in store for me in Germany.

For my future Baptism as an Orthodox Christian, and acceptance as a member of the Community, and in case I cannot overcome my yet slight Angst about the&quot;dunking&quot;, I obtained my Certificate of Baptism from the Roman Catholic Church. On the Baptism Certificate, my DOB is given October 10, my Birth Certificate states October 11, so all my legal papers are in question. I also discovered that I had a maternal Godmother, my aunt Elizabeth.

My second surprise came when my beloved Mother, never failing to show me what are called&quot;Sterbebilder&quot;, little folded cards with a picture, birth and death day of persons who have passed on since my last visit. We then go through a box of &apos;all&apos; these little cards, again, and another box of Her, my Fathers, us three Sisters, the extended Family, most of whom I don&apos;t know, and other persons lives, and events, again. It seems half of Bavaria is related to us.

On one of those cards was the Orthodox Cross, and matter-of-factly I asked why this Cross is different, to which my Mother matter-of-factly replied,&quot;It&apos;s the Scheyrer Cross&quot;. I was excited because I knew I had stumbled on a bit of history here, and remarked that I hadn&apos;t been in the Scheyrer Basilika for a long time and would like to see it again.

Close to my hometown, the village of Schyern was originally inhabited by the Keltic Clan&quot;Skiren&quot;, hence Scheyern, and was the Cradle of the House of Wittelsbach, who ruled Bavaria for some 730 years, until 1918. The Cloister of Schyren was established by Otto II and his wife Haziga, and in 1119 his son Otto III gifted their Castle and land-holdings to the Benedikt Order. Of course, a Brewery was added, it grew, and Scheyern became a political and cultural center.

My Sister and I visited the Basilika and walked about, my chance coming when I saw the Cross and the date 900AD. Did you know, I said to my Sister, that this is the Orthodox Cross, the Cross of original Christianity, from which the Catholic Church seperated about 900 AD. My sister simply doubts everything I say, her husbands negates it forthwith, and I barely say anything at all. She gave me the usual &apos;what are you talking about&apos; and I kept quiet.

We walked on and passed a Lady and two Gentlemen discussing the history of the Basilika. I heard 900, turned and approached waiting to be invited to speak. The Lady seemed most informed and I asked if She knew when the Church was built,&quot;I&apos;m not sure&quot;, She said,&quot;I think about 900&quot;. Of course, I had to say that was when the RC Church seperated from Original Christianity, the Orthodox Church, threw in Plethon, Marsilio and Cosmo, and we had a good time. I felt soo vindicated and a bit of Schadenfreude because I knew my Sister, God bless her, had come near and was listening in. We both just let it go, but both of us wondered why the paintings in the Church were so amateurish, perhaps on porpuse, we thought, but why so unattractive to the eye? All during our walk I kept an eye out for a Priest or Monk, would have loved to speak a few words with one, but no such luck.

To this day, thousands of Pilgrims come to be blessed with this Orthodox Cross, minus the slanted or level bar toward the lower end, instead a stylized knotted tassel on the bottom, which I don&apos;t yet know the meaning of, the tassel of the prayer rope came to mind. The Cross was also on the wall where I obtained my Baptism Certificate, but I kept from asking about it, lest the Lady thought something was wrong with me and said something about looking my Certificate over. I doubt She knew, nobody of the people knew. In fact, the Cross, backgrounded by the well known black and white checkers on floors of Catherals, a hops vine with Dolde, the&quot;green gold&quot;of Bavaria, constitutes the Coat of Arms of the Wittelsbacher, and now the entire County of 20 towns, area 760 qkm.

During my Mothers Birthday Diner, I asked my Nephew&apos;s wife from the Black Sea region if She is an Orthodox Christian, yes, she said, and so is their little son. I gave her a thumb&apos;s up but didn&apos;t say anymore, not wanting to high-jack and be reproached for speaking about my&quot;stuff&quot;, which&quot;we don&apos;t care about&quot;, the ever present and vigorous conversation about FOOD and DRINK.

The rest of my visit was uneventful, and as I already knew that all we would ever discuss is who goes where, to whom and what for, and the most excellent foods fresh from the fields and trees, trice yum, who cooked what on what day, what the ingredients, how it could be improved, and what is next on the menu.

My Sister and I did wander in the forest, eat berries and gathered a few mushrooms, and I stood alone listening a while and more.

Upon saying good bye, my Mother and I in tears unable to speak, She managed to say with such Love and deep sincerity as I never heard Her say before:&quot;Ja Lotte, wenn der liebe Gott will sehen wir uns mal wieder&quot;. When the loving God wills we will see each other again, sometime.

Yours truly

Charlotte

I forgot to mention the clock I bought in Munich. It is akin to a diner plate and reads

 In Bayern


geh&apos;n die Uhren anders 


If you please curve the writing according to a diner plate, but only if you&apos;re inclined. &apos;In Bavaria - the clocks go other&apos;. They go counter-clockwise, the 12 on top, 6 in the bottom, but to the right of the 12 is 11, 10, 9, and so on down, and to the left of the 12 is 1, 2, 3, and so on down, and they meet at the 6 on the botton, No, just kidding.

For instance, when it&apos;s 2:30 on a regular clock, it&apos;s also 2:30 on the counter-clockwise Bavarian clock, only on the other side and you have to read it downward to the 6, and on the other side it will still show you the right time reading upward to the 12. I can&apos;t stop laughing....It&apos;s like the staircase at the Sistine Chapel when people appear coming up the same way you&apos;re going down. If you want to see into a Bavarian Mind you can draw a picture of the clock and just keep laughing at it.

Another thing, I sat &apos;upstairs&apos; in one of the &apos;polstert chairs on the train back to my home town. The date and direction was shown, and it was to leave at 3:29. My eyes were glued to the &apos;regular, clock to see if it might leave at 3:28 or-30. No, at 3:29 the train began to move and left the station. The clocks are so precise that when the second hand has reached the minute mark, it stops and lets the minute hand jump, then resumes its ticking. I could tell many other things of the Nature of the Bavarians, and only people who don&apos;t know Bavarians and their dialect say we&apos;re slow and dumb and are really only capable of jodling.

Sorry, I&apos;m still half-way there.

Hallo Don,

It wasn&apos;t a ring, btw, that the people and I kissed, but the hand-bestowing Blessing on each and every person anew as a gesture of love, appreciation, gratefulness and respect for that person, here His Grace Bishop Maxim, devoting His Life to guiding us to the Kindom.

According to Orthodxy,&quot;Thou shalt not steal&quot;also means not stealing too much time from&quot;Theosis, the process wherby we regain our lost Likeness to God.&quot;So I will not go too deeply into our differences here, and also because I have absolutely no interest of proving me right or you wrong, or proving you right and me wrong. Like others, we could argue forever and you know what that is called.

The Illuminate write of the&quot;Virtual Sea of Becoming&quot;as in particle physics, and end:

&quot;The law of Being, on the other hand, denies virtual existence. it states that Being - real, solid, and measurable - exists, has always existed and could never not exists. Otherwise Being must have spontaneously and perfectly emerged from Nothing, and that is impossible. (Wrong, we do not believe such) Although simple forms always precede complex forms, never the other way around, believers in Being invariably make&quot;God&quot;- the most complex being conceivable - the starting point. The God of Being stands in direct opposition to the Theory of Evolution. (Wrong) No one cane believe both.&quot;

Yes we can! For one, the wording or mind of the writer is confused, for two, Spirit involution causes matter evolution or no material universe, for three God is Light/Love/Consciousness from which all proceeds in the same manner as their&quot;virtual existence is the inevitable precurser of actual existence. I could pick their whole paragrah apart in 100 pages if I wanted too Whoever writes for the Illuminate about us Believers knows not what he/she is talking about. Knowledge is different than understanding, hence my arrogancy.

Concerning the Virgin Birth, and again, you can believe and accept whatever pleases you, had you, penetratively, read in my post the quotes on the Holy Theotokos, you would have discerned strange things in the language, forcing thinking on it. Besides, I had a Vision of the Virgin Birth in what is called the&quot;Oracle Dream&quot;, the REAL and highest of the five types, Holy in its Stillness, part of which I wrote before but shall never speak of again. Much can be gleaned by reading very carefully the Divine Poet&apos;s Veneration of the Mother of God.

And what of the Ancient Egyptians?&quot;The Pharaoh with his crowns of the upper and lower self&quot;. I have given the simplest version of their&quot;Great Work&quot;many times,&quot;I have entered as a man of no understanding, and I shall come forth in the form of a strong Spirit, and my form shall be that of men and women for ever and for ever.&quot;

What does it mean when Pharaoh communes in silence with&quot;Yhe Hidden One&quot;, and a women,&quot;crowns himself&quot;with the Double Crown of Egypt thereby uniting his Kingdom, becomes absolute Ruler over Upper and Lower Egypt? He has perfected himself, is deified and becomes a god, not the Creator, but co-creates in limitless freedom the stupendous Works of Egypt in all their magnificent Beauty, flooring us to this day?

What does it mean when Hatshepsut plants a Garden for her Divine Father, who came to her and&quot;gave her life?&quot;And the Great Ramses&quot;who has done excellent things for his Divine Father, Horus the Falcon, He built a house of millions of years into this mountain.&quot;

They Trinity Amon-Ra, Harmakes and Ptah? Tut&apos;s bracelet inscription,&quot;wake up from the swoon in which you sleep, you will triumph over everything done against you&quot;. Illuminated Egypt! Who took your breath away! Coffee no, Late yes.

We ARE pilgrims, taught by the Ancients from time immemorial, and the&quot;First Grandmaster of the Illuminate&quot;, Pythagoras. Quote:

&quot;Pythagors was born in 570 on the Greek island of Samos. He was taught how to perform miracles by the mystic called Pherecydes, who first introduced him to the doctrines of the Illuminate. (At this time the Illuminate did not exist as a formal organization, but a loose group of nomadic thinkers and mystics.)&quot;

I&apos;m glad the added this, NOMADIC THINKERS AND MYSTICS.

&quot;Pherecydes instructed Pythagoras on the immortality and transmigration of the human soul, the soul&apos;s wandering in the underworld, and the purpose of the soul&apos;s cycle of reincarnation.

&quot;Mystery religions have nothing in common with revealed religions. Mystery religions are about the truth, about ultimate transformation, about opening your eyes to all of the potential of the universe.&quot;

How is this different from what we are on about here? And there is only One mystery religion, as the Seik taxi driver said on the way from the Airport, the priciple of all religions is the same, some add, some subtract.

&quot;Only mystery religion can restore humanity&apos;s sense of the divine. Illumination, with an unbroken ancestry in the mystery religions of the past, is the religion that will replace all other.&quot;

If they would say religion instead of the religions, that would be Orthodoxy. There is much right with the Illuminate, for instance, if you read their&quot;Mystery Degrees&quot;.

I don&apos;t know how the Illuminate replace members who pass on, but if I were the Grandmasterin, I would choose those proficient in all necessary disciplines, and Wise, or, if all else fails, they could call me.

The enigam of Existence

&quot;The superposition Principle of quantum theory tells us that quantum particles can exist in a probabilistic cloud of different states that in classical terms would be mutually exclusive of each other.&quot;

Maybe less cloudy,&quot;an unobserved quantum entity ( a unit of energy) is said to be in a super position of all possible states permitted by its wave function.&quot;

Continue quote:&quot;Only if and when the&quot;wavefunction collapses&quot;(to use the jargon) is one of the potential states definitely selected. Physicists have no idea what causes the collapse in favor of one state over the others. We will explain in a subsequent article the answer to this conundrum.&quot;

If you happen on the answer I would appreciate knowing it. As far as I know, after we have considered all our options we choose what we like best and make a final DESICION which collapses the wavefunction and IT&quot;matters&quot;to us. If we don&apos;t&quot;mind&quot;it doesn&apos;t&quot;matter&quot;, Madam Blavatzky&apos;s&quot;matter moving Nous&quot;, if we don&apos;t care nothing&quot;matters&quot;.

The supreme quantum entity is the photon, light, massless, but endowes all other particles with mass, evolution. As said, in Orthodoxy, the Nous is our highest faculty, here,&quot;the energy of our psyche, and I can repeat,&quot;the more conscious we are of our oneness with God, the more immediately matter responds to the touch of our consciousness. What we INTEND comes into being. And when we are fully conscious, what we INTEND will come into being INSTANTANEOUSLY.&quot;

And so it is, and was from the beginning of this thread.

Read some more apropos the Illuminate, a few thoughts on it.

&quot;Becoming might be considered as a force that acts on everything, transforming the simple to the more complex, maximising their latent potentialities and possibilities. -&quot;believers in Being invariable make&quot;God&quot;the most complex being conceivable - their starting point.&quot;(What is that&quot;force?)

No we don&apos;t. God is the ONE, who begets the Son, and the Holy Spirit, breath of life proceeding from the Father, and yet they are a cosubstantial Unity. So believers begin with One, who becomes two, who becomes three. Devision of number begins not by adding one to one, but by dividing the 1 and so on.

How the described Old and New World Order works we know, wrote Steven:&quot;As Orthodox Christians, one of the first things we need to recognize is that our culture is not our friend.&quot;

&quot;Obama has benefited from being the multi-cultural candidate par excellence: half white, half black, half Christian, half Muslem, half professor, half celebrity, half intellectual, half civil rights campaigner. He is a man for all season, a rainbow canvas upon which the masses can project any image they like. He will be a disastrous president. Nothing significant will change under him. The people who were wealthy and powerful at the start of his term of office will be wealthy and powerful at the end of it. Those who were impoverished and powerless at the start will be exactly the same at the end.&quot;

Instead of half intellectual, I would credit our President with being wholly of natural intellect, not mechanical, hence his natural eloquence in speech, plus his easy apprehension and comprehension of a given problem, and the overall situation of Wolrd. You can see it in his slight nod to himself when he looks inside and in his face. Consider the despicable Monster he is up against playing on the ignorance of a number of the masses, employing hate-mongers themselves, the most ignorant, some as if possessed.

Now I know this isn&apos;t the fault of the Illuminate, but this wholly negative&quot;nothing will change&quot;is as of affirming, energizing, and projecting onto to the World of an inner state becoming our outer invironment, this&quot;Secret of the Universe.&quot;

&quot;We see wrong and try to right it&quot;, and such inspiring messages everywhere and measured for the people would result in a collective meta noia in a relatively short time. If the people are inspired, politions fall. Even though the Mills of God must grind slowly, it would behoove the Illuminate and all of us to seperate the chaff from our thought and speech and pour only the wheat of hopeful and encouriging rhetoric into the drums.

Love, good tidings and a high five

So it was all those mean nasty Roman Catholics after 900 AD was it ...

 686 AD
Sussex, the last heathen community in England, is converted to Christianity; About this time, public practice of the Old Religions was persecuted . ... 

I am not certain but is not 686 before the 900 date that you both suggest ?

&quot;King Eadwine of Northumbria welcomed the Roman missionary Paulinus in 627 and was Baptized, but when he died five years later,his successors DROVE Paulinas out...&quot;

I&apos;m not trying to make excuses for how these people behaved. I&apos;m merely pointing out that both sides were at fault. The practitioners of the&quot;old religion&quot;weren&apos;t just peacefully practicing their faith when they began to be persecuted, they had&quot;driven out&quot;Paulinas long before 686.

All I&apos;m saying is that,there is usually much more to the story than,&quot;Public persecution of the old religion began.&quot;Which I noticed that your source neglected to mention...

Undoubtedly there were some frictions there between the old and the new religion. These things do happen. Especially where there are people involved in need of improvement to their human nature.

Don&apos;t worry. Orthodox Christians have been,are now and will continue to be persecuted in the Future, (As will every true believer in God if the power elite have their way and bring about the one world government they have in mind. Is this the New World Order that the Illuminati are trying to bring about, or are they planning to hijack it from those who are presently in power and make it into some sort of benevolent New World Order? It&apos;s so difficult to tell whose side they are REALLY on, since they love to play both sides against the middle...)

I&apos;ll tell you what. I, personally, promise not to persecute you, (or anybody else, for that matter.) I don&apos;t even care what you or anyone else does to me. It&apos;s not my business what other people choose to believe or not believe. It is my sincere desire that whatever path a person chooses to follow brings them to a good and blessed consummation. I feel compelled to share with others and make available to them what I believe to be true and what has been the source of so many blessings to me all these years in the hope that it will do the same for others.

Beyond that,it&apos;s really not my concern. It&apos;s between God and each individual seeker after the truth. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Dear Charlotte,

His Grace Bishop Maxim sends his greetings. He remembered you from the last time he served. He&apos;s not sure when he will be serving again, could be two or three weeks. If you will introduce yourself when you see him again, and ask for his blessing to become a catacumen, he will gladly do everything he can to help you.

(That is, if you&apos;re still interested after finding out that the Orthodox can be just as bad as the roman catholics, or anyone else, for that matter!) Re: The Secret of the Universe

I thank His Grace Bishop Maxim and I am honored, and so for remembering me. Given the opportunity, I will introduce myself and ask for His blessing and see what transpires.

There will be no Services this Sunday at St. Steven, so I will attend St. Matthew.

I will respond to the rest of your, and Don&apos;s post tomorrow.

It is simplistic to think and say, one or an other system or Institution is good or bad only. There are bad apples in all, and how things are done and proceed depends on the immediate and circumstances at hand. The turning wordls are too complex as to even minimally comprehend by the average linear Mind, ultimately All works for the Good, even those forever scheeming ill.

The Illuminate rail against the power elite, and yes, try to bring it down. In that sense, Micheal Moore, who with cup in hand begs on the streets for City Bank and BoA, belongs to the Illuminate. I&apos;m in agreement with many of their ideas and ideals, and that their&quot;True God&quot;is the same as the God of Orthodoxy can be seen in statements such statements:

&quot;Illumination - ultimate gnosis - reveals the true nature of the True God and explains the precise nature of the test he has set for us. This test is not of the rediculous type preached by the false prophets of Christianity, Judaism and Islam. The last thing that the True God wishes is for us to be his abject slaves. He does not wish us to&quot;love, serve and obey him&quot;- the mantra of all megalomaniacs and dictators - HE WISHES US TO JOIN HIM, TO PARTAKE OF GODNESS.&quot;(my emphasis)

Was it you, Steven, who wrote:&quot;God is seeking those amongst us who are capable of becoming gods too. He wants allies, companions, equals.&quot;

Orthodoxy&apos;s ethical teaching, to love God, serving one&apos;s fellow man, and &apos;keeping the commandments&apos; of Christ, thou shalt not lie, steal, commit adultery, honoring thy parents etc., does not equate to being slaves, their aim is&quot;but the transformation of man&apos;s life into the likeness of God.&quot;

Illuminate:

&quot;Many people consider that th Egyptians were obsessed with the stars, but in fact it was the soul that transfixed them. The significane of the astronomy wa that it provided a star map for the soul to return whence it came - the universe of the True God. The universe of the demiurge is the micro-universe, contained within the macro-universe, the universe proper. Several ancient groups thought they could provide a detailed map, plus secret passwords, that a soul would need to use to successfully escape from the Demiurge&apos;s prison and reach the eternal realm of light.&quot;

Perhaps they are referring here to the Masons in an over-simplistic sentense. Man, the microcosm,&quot;Grand Symbol of the Universe&quot;IS the Crown of Creation. I don&apos;t know who the Illuminate are, but they are not my Illuminate proper. The Illuminated I follow are of the alchemical tradition who sublimate and spiritualize matter, as given yesterday in the Poem on the Phoenix. It should be no secret by this time that, until I make the Grade, my Supreme Illuminator is Sir Francis Bacon, Shakespeare, and anyone seeking to know the True World Order can find it in His&quot;New Atlantis&quot;, His Words and Works.

Indeed, it is difficult to tell whose side the Illuminate are on, hence I think they are schizophrenic, as I detect a certain&quot;our&apos;s alone is the knowledge therefore the power, we are the way to the True God and will provide answers, but as I said it may just be in the language. I hope Obama doesn&apos;t gave in, I see good qualities in him. By lightyears I prefer to learn by Poetry.

 In Paradise,
When thou wert born in the rose,
beneath the Tree of Knowledge,
thou receivest a kiss,
and thy right name was given to thee

Good morning Don,

&quot;... please save your breath.&quot;

Again, I am simply conveying my understanding, not trying to convince you of anything. Generally speaking, my first paragraph could have been worded better, but I had not enough time.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWkhp0SPG-k 

I reread your post on the other thread ending,&quot;.... but how much sense does it make that we are here, think, breath and ponder on why we are here.&quot;

Either we have a purpose or we have no purpose. The world at large goes by&quot;Evolution versus Intelligent design.&quot;If we consider the former, we evolved from some blob in the ocean and it evolved at random as it may, we being the endproduct. Look at US! Did matter give us Consciousness, Intelligence, love of Love and Beauty, Art, and the myriad of faculties we possess? You believe in a divine spark, did matter give us the divine spark?

Then look at the sublime Tree of Life you one posted, from EnSof to Malkuth, from limitless Light to the Man we now are. It is Light/Consciousness that endows matter with its properties. Your main concern, pardon me, is looking and looking and pushing the river, instead of with a totally&quot;empty&quot;Mind co-conspiring in thought with any given writer and speaker of whatever subject, or the little old Lady in the Supermarket, thereby simply&quot;hearing&quot;, thinking on it later and letting it be and the answer will&quot;come up&quot;by itself like a name we&apos;re trying so hard to remember by literally halting our life to concentrate solely on the name, and finally give up&quot;it will come to me&quot;, and a few minutes later it suddenly pops up. Forcing has the opposite effect because of tension, it&apos;s how I see it.

I too saw my life flash in front of me, many people have, more on it after work as to how I understand it.

Love

Charlotte

Interesting that you re-lived your life while unconscious, big store house, our memory. Many people see their lives flashing in front of them in seconds in very critical situations, mostly when we&apos;re convinced we&apos;re dying, though conscious but solely focused on the &apos;movie&apos; of our life, as you did when you woke up.

You say the pain didn&apos;t return until you actually re-lived that part until you dislocated your shoulder. How could it? The pain was not in your life until you then, so it couldn&apos;t be a matter of you not being in the game.

Being gods, we need something amazingly complicated to entertain ourselves, and in your reality you built the Pyramids to peak your interest at a certain time and place and that is perhaps why you&apos;re finding what you want to find, and maybe you put it there. What is IT? I am utterly confused.

That you have no doubt that the Geometry is there and you no longer need to study it, makes sense again. Maybe the Geometry and number did a number on your mind. I mean that in all sincerity, it happens, you know.

Aside from what is at issue here in this addendum, which, as a friend, troubles me some, I feel like I&apos;m babbling the same things over and again and truly do waste my time, wishing to return to more lofty regions. Can we drop the pointless arguments of who&quot;is in error&quot;and simply voice our opinions on the secrets of the universe at issue here in civil discourse. You seem to be so angry.

The Holy Prophet Zacharias

He was the father of St. John the Forerunner. Zacharias was the son of Barachias, from the lineage of Abia, of the sons of Aaron. Zacharias was a high priest who held the eighth degree of service in the Temple of Jerusalem. His wife Elizabeth was the daughter of Sophia and sister of St. Anna, who was the mother of the Holy Theotokos. During the reign of King Herod the child-slayer, Zacharias was serving one day at the Temple of Jerusalem according to his turn. An angel of God appeared to him in the Sanctuary, and Zacharias had great fear. The angel said to him: Fear not Zacharius (Luke 1:13), and announced that Elizabeth would bear a son, in answer to their prayer. But both Zacharias and Elizabeth were old. Whem Zacharias doubted the word of the heavenly herald, the angel said: I am Gabriel, that stands in the presence of God (Luke 1:19), Zacharias was struck dumb from that hour, and could not speak until his son was born and he had written on a tablet: His name is John (Luke 1:63). Then his speech returned, and he magnified God. Some time later, when the Lord Jesus had been born and Herod began to slaughter the children of Bethlehem, he sent men to find and kill the son of Zacharias-for Herod had heard all that had happened to Zacharias, and how John had been born. Upon seeing the soldiers coming, Elizabeth took John in her arms-he was a year and a half old at that time-fled from the house with him, and ran to a rocky and desolate place. When she saw the soldiers following her, she cried out to the mountain:&quot;Oh mountain of God, receive a mother with her child!&quot;and the rock opened and hid the mother and child, Then Herod, enraged that the child John had not been slain, ordered that Zacharias be slain before the altar. The blood of Zacharias spilled on the marble and dried solid as stone, and remained as a witness to Herod&apos;s evil deed. In the place where Elizabeth hid with John a cave opened, water flowed out of it, and a fruit-bearing palm grew, all by the power of God. Fourty days after the death of Zacharias, the blessed Elizabeth died. The child John remained in the wilderness, fed by an angel and protected by God&apos;s providence, until the day he appeared at the Jordan.&quot;

&quot;Men strive in vain to discover those things that God intentionally conceals from them&quot;, but in striving they become less concealed.

HOMILY
on the two births

&quot; That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit (John 3:6).
Brethren, these words are not the words of a prophet or an apostle, but are the words of the Lord Himself, uttered with His most pure mouth. As there is power and salvation in every one of the Lord&apos;s words, so is there power and salvation in these. That is why it is necessary to study these words with fear and great care and apply them in our lives. By these words the Lord emphasizes the prcidence of the spirit over flesh. And, as the flesh is born of the body, so the spirit must be born of the Spirit. The birth is of the Spirit of God, according to the grace of God and not according to nature. It is the new birth the Lord described to Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. Nicodemus did not understand these words of Christ, just as, even today, he whose flesh is stronger than the his spirit does not understand them. Men whose flesh has overcome their spirit think and judge everything according to the body. Men whose spirit has overcome their body think and judge everything according to the spirit. All those who think and judge according to their body make their spirits fleshly, while all who think and judge spiritually make their bodiesspiritual. Just like someone exchanging gold for paper money, the former convert that which is immortal into that which is mortal. The latter are like someone exchanging paper money for pure gold-for they do not destroy that which is immortal, but convert that which is mortal into that which is immortal. The Jews interpreted the Law of the Prophets according to the flesh, and that is why they did not understand the Lord Jesus, but crucified the Lord of Glory. Those who were enlightened by the grace of the Spirit of God interpreted both the Law and the Prophets spititually, and understood our Lord Jesus Christ. And through him, they understood not only the Law and the Prophets, but all of created nature as well, and all of their life on earth. Brethren, although the body is necessarily born of the flesh, it would be unnatural for the spirit also to be born of the flesh. Let our spirit be born of the Spirit of God and then we will be natural, both in body and spirit. This is that higher and sinless nature that Adam had in Paradise before he sinned. It is not possible or necessary for our body to be born again of the flesh. It is possible and necessary, and never to late for our spirit to be born again of the Spirit of God.
O Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God-help us, that before death we may become reborn of the Spirit of God, and that our spirits, in truth, be born of the Spirit.
To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.&quot;

In contemplating and walking by the Icons of Jesus Christ, it is suddenly realized how and why they are windows into His Kingdom.

And with THAT in mind, I would like to reiterate a few things and add one pertinent clip...

In the words of&quot;The Police&quot;,&quot;There is no political solution&quot;, because the problem is not politics but human nature. Human nature desperately needs to be transformed.

And then from John Lennon,&quot;You tell me that it&apos;s evolution, well you know, you better free your mind instead.&quot;

Free your mind: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXoPHvDB-4A 

Free our minds from what? The two clips I posted from&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;point that out:&quot;Monsters John, monsters from the ID!&quot;

Armageddon is an inner warfare, the last battle between good and evil fought on the battlefield of each individual human heart. Our inner state becomes our outer environment. The ways in which Armageddon will out -manifest itself collectively in our environment and upon the world-stage is not necessarily the point or where we need to be focusing. The key will always come down to our inner response to outer circumstances.

Orthodox Christianity and the entire Orthodox way of life has one purpose and one purpose only and that is to enable each individual to go through a process of Purification/Illumination/Deification in a gradual and consistent manner,whose aim is to transform human nature entirely.

When and as, our human nature is being transformed, the entire universe responds and is transformed along with us.

For those who have ears,let them hear.

At times I refer to politics, these are but tangential remarks.

Good clip of the Marshal Arts above and below.

For me, our inner response to outer circumstanes is always to&quot;take a sad song and make it better&quot;. It is easy, also on oneself.

Even in a &apos;wordly&apos; way, from Philosophers and Scientists, and Onkel Carl, it it is known that the Universe responds to us, and without thinking on it deeper the man on the street would say,&quot;What you see is what you get&quot;. Humanity should be made more aware of it. This has been a T-shirt idea along with QM for Couch Potato&apos;s.

 September 6 

&quot;Near Hierapolis, in Phrygia, thete was a place called Chonae (&quot;plunging&quot;), and in that place there was a spring of miraculous water. When Apostle John the Theologen, accompanied by Philip, preached the Gospel in Hierapolis, he looked upon that place and prophesied that a spring of miraculous water would open there, from which many will receive healing, and that the great Archangel of God Michael would visit that place.Soon afterward, the prophecy was fulfilled: a spring of water burst forth and became widely known for its miraculous power. A pagan in Laodicea had a daughter who was mute, which caused him great sorrow. Archangel Michael appeared to him in a dream, and told him to take his daughter to the spring, where she would be cured. The father immediately obeyed , brought his daughter to the sprin, and found many people there seeking deliverance from various infirmities. The people were all Christians. The man sked how he should seek healing, and the Christians told him:
&quot;You must pray to the Archangel Michael, in the name of the Father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit.&quot;The man prayed in this way, gave his daughter a drink of the water, and the girl began to speak. The pagan, his daughter and his whole household were baptized. He also built a church over the spring dedicated to the Archangel Michael.&quot;

Post by charlotte on Sept 6, 2009, 6:08pm

To add one word to &apos;what you see is what you get&apos;, viz., &apos;what you like to see is what you get&apos;, and a few words why this is so could make a big difference.

In the Matins, the spring of miraculous waters at Chonae was called&quot;funnel&quot;, or perhaps the water was funnled from the spring.

St. Paul&apos;s words to the Corinthians were read:&quot;Brethen, be watchful, stand firm in your faith, be stron. Let all that you do be done in love.&quot;Some time ago, I also read that walking on water, or the Sea can be interpreted as walking on one&apos;e Faith.

From the Gospel of Matthew was read the parable of the householder&quot;who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge around it, and dug a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it our to tenants, and went into another country.&quot;When it was time to harvest the fruits, the tenants&quot;beat one, killed another, and stoned another&quot;, of the servants of the householder charged with collecting the fruits. The householder thought that the tenats would surely respect his son and sent his son to collect the fruits, but the tenants killed his son to have his inheritance.

The householder represents God who plants the vineyard, the tennats are we, branches of the vine, who even kill His Son to have the fruits for ourselves. The tenants thought that the householder will put these wretched tenants to death and lease the land to other tenants who will give&quot;the fruits in their season&quot;to the householder.&quot;Jesus said onto them,&quot;Have you never heard in the Scriptures: &apos;The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord&apos;s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.&quot;It signifies our relationship with God who gives us All and we give little or nothing back, is how Father Aquaro explained it in a short version.

The Feast was of the Nativity of the Theotokos.

&quot;By thy holy nativity, O pure one, Joachim and Anna were delivered from the reproach of barreness; and Adam and Eve were delivered from the corruption of death; thy people do celebrate it, having been saved from the stain of iniquity, crying onto thee, The barren doth give bith to the Theotokos, who nourishes our life.

&quot;Now Adam offers from us and for us elements onto God, the most worthy fruit of mankind: Mary, in Whom the new Adam is rendered Bread for the restoration of the human race. Now is open the great bosom of virginity, and the Church, in the matrimonial manner, places upon it a pure, truly spotless pearl.

&quot;Nowhuman worhtiness accepts the gift of the first creation and returns to its former condition; the majesty darkened by formless sin, through the conjoyning by his Mother by birth&quot;of Him Beauteous by Goodness,&quot;man receives beauty in a most excellent and God-seemly visage. And this creation is done truly by the creation , and recreation by theosis, and theosis by a return to the original perfection!&quot;

I always think I would not write that much, but the language is so interesting when thinking through it.

When receiving the Blessed Bread, Father Aquaro asked,&quot;How are you?&quot;I said I was doing well, and He asked me to call Him this week. I said I would. I thought Father Aquaro was wondering where I was, so I will explain.

In the beginning I had this problem with He, or Him, or Her, which we weren&apos;t allowed to say growing up, but only the name, so being capitalized makes for easier writing.

Hope everyone is having a good Labor Day weekend.

Hallo Don,

If we had but the faith the size of a mustard seed we could move mountains. It isn&apos;t the mountain of stone that moves, it is an innate power we have represented by a mountain to change our reality by removing obstacles. I saw this once in a Vision, a Vision does not take place in the material world, but the soul is transported into another kind of reality, akin to dreams you said take place in another dimension, but there must be some kind of membrane connection or we couldn&apos;t remember a dream upon waking into this reality.

The spring of miraculous water was at a place called Chonae, plunging, or dunking, signifying baptism. The pagan was not a miracle worker, but the love for his daughter and ardent desire for her to be cured gave him great Faith and his daughter had great Faith in her Father to help her. Remember walking on water means walking on a Sea of Faith, Peter doubted and began to sink. Faith is hard to come by, but, said my Phi-Teacher, when you make a leap of faith into darkness, unknown, you will find there is solid ground to land on. Yesterday in Church I heard the words,&quot;I will not be afraid of 10.000 people around me&quot;, persecuting me for what I believe, which very words gave me great strenght to persevere no matter what. To all the Teachings is more than seen by Literalists.

How miracles work you can read on page 27, post 397, and what Orthodoxy is on page 7, post 94, among many other explanations. Simply it is defined&quot;mind over matter&quot;. Many things would become clearer if you could but read without any preconceived notions, open empty Mind, not for the sake of Orthodoxy but for thy own.

You can liken it to the miraculous waters of Lourdes, which were tested and nothing in the water could account for the miracles occurring there. St. Bernadette had&quot;Visions&quot;of what she called&quot;the thing&quot;, until &apos;it&apos; told her that she was&quot;The Immaculate Conception&quot;. A vision too can be called immaculate for untainted by human thought. Bernadette&apos;s hands too were in contact with the flame of a candle and showed no injury.

There is a state of Being where one is wholy unaware of the body and invincible, not of the physical reality. Miracles also occur spontaneously in a &apos;empty&apos; state of mind, as Fern had it that God uses every open avenue to serve His purpose.

On this thread, in the main we are concerned with transformation, effected not solely by this and the other, or these together, but more things in Heaven and on Earth than dreamt of in our Philosophy.

Orthodoxy:

&quot;The less comprehesible it is, the more is revealed, and the more it is revealed, the less comprehensible it is.&quot;

It can only unfold in the silence of our Hearts.

It&apos;s all in the mind, you know. Walter Greenslade

&quot;In the province of the mind, what is believed to be true is true, or becomes true within certain limits to be learned by experience and experiment. These limits are further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind. There are no limits.&quot;John C Lily

This was the point of that clip from&quot;The Matrix.&quot;Load the jump program... Free your mind.

On Mt. Tabor in Israel at the Monastery of the Transfiguration, there is a miracle-working Icon of the Theotokos. Hanging all around this Icon are hundreds of little medallions, photos, necklaces, ect., hung there as memorials of miraculous healings received by people who prayed before this Icon either for themselves or for their loved ones.

If you travel through Greece or any of the other Orthodox Nations,you will find hundreds of other Icons like this.

In many cases,you can talk to the doctors of these people who have received healings and they will show you the x-rays. Where there was cancer before, not only has the cancer stopped growing, there IS no cancer and, as far as the x-rays are concerned, there never has been any cancer.

This all takes place according to one&apos;s faith and according to the will of God, for,&quot;When God so wills, the natural order is overcome for He does whatsoever He pleases.&quot;

Faith is not,&quot;Wishful thinking,&quot;or&quot;Blind,&quot;but the apprehension of, and trust in, invisible realities, as well as being an element of a living and ongoing relationship with the Divine.

Now you may believe that all of these people have been deceived somehow,( but no one charges them anything to be able to pray before these Icons, or for the healings they receive for that matter...) or that they are simply mistaken, or that they are out and out lying. But, why would you want to?

Can I add what came to Mind yesterday, it is not the wind that moves, it is not the flag that moves, it is your mind that moves.

Coming back to Don&apos;s comment,&quot;Aw Charlotte, you don&apos;t really believe that.&quot;

Praying in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit&quot;, and the relationship of the Holy Trinity, our relationship with God, is explained by Orthodoxy understandable to everyone on page 23, 24, and 25.

&quot;For of what use is existence to a creature if it cannot know its Maker?&quot;

Aside from the process of Theosis, God can be known in daily life when, either a disaster is imminent but is avoided &apos;in the nick of time&apos;, something that could have been disastrous did occurr but no damage was done, or, on the other hand, something happens bringing us unimaginable Happiness, at times when least expected, and we are so grateful as to exclaim over and again,&quot;Thank you God - oh my God thank you.&quot;Many, if not all people speak of such experiences, and I have had both kinds. At times I laughed and cried silmuntaneously. I have said that&quot;an unmistakable feeling&quot;comes on such occasions when God is involved in our lives.

Yesterday, I heard it phrased eloquently by someone whose life was saved.&quot;I said hallelujah when I hit the ground, when God moves in your life he wants us to be sure we know it&apos;s Him.&quot;

As to the Illuminate, they speak of their&quot;astonishing mission to save humanity&quot;, and other&quot;astonishing&quot;secrets and such they will reveal in time with this air of the Dramatic, and write:

&quot;The divine spark is the direct link between God and us&quot;, which can be likened to my Phi-Teacher&apos;s,&quot;There is a starlike structure in you and when truth hits it, it shines.&quot;Truth is of God.

&quot;The divine spark is the Holy Grail&quot;, according to the Illuminate,&quot;And most of us will never find it no matter how hard we search for it. That was the fate of the vast majority of the Grail seekers. They traveled in the wrong direction, asked the wrong questions, believed the wrong things, and virtually all of them failed, despite being the cream of Arthurian chivalry.&quot;

I would give the Illuminate the benefit of doubt as to who they mean by the&quot;cream of Arthurian chivalry&quot;. Surely not those I&apos;m familiar with of the Florentine and English Renaissance, and Sir Francis Bacon, the Bona Fide Illuminate.

Illuminate Degrees

&quot;Pythagoras was the first man to call himself a philosopher - a lover of wisdom - and he was also the first to declare that the earth wasn&apos;t the centre of the universe. Instead, a mystical central fire (not the sun) was put at the centre of the Cosmo, thus making this model a forerunner of the Copernican system.&quot;

If meant is the nucleus, or Cosmic&quot;bulge&quot;as science so grossly terms it, surrounded by the Cosmic Halo, and all the dust obscuring it from our sight, fine. Fern thought it was our psychological smog.

&quot;The central fire was referred to as the&quot;House of Abraxas&quot;- and represented, symbolically, the home of the True God, the eternal realm of divine light and warmth.&quot;

What, then, is this House of Abraxas, home of the True God, the one and true Temple of God by another name?

His Grace, St. Nicholas Cabasilas summed up the life of the Church in this way:

&quot;As nature prepares the fetus, while it is in its dark and fluid life, for that life which is in the light, and shapes it, as though according to a model, for the life which it is about to receive, so likewise it happens to the Saints. This is what the Apostle Paul said when he wrote to the Galatians, my little children, with whom I am in travail until Christ be formed in you (Galatians 4:19).

&quot;. . . For us, too, that Sun has graciously risen, the heavenly fragrance has been poured forth into the malodorous places, and the Bread of angels has been given even onto men.

&quot;This is the way in which we draw this life into our souls by being initiated into the mysteries, being washed and anointed and partaking of the Holy Table. . . . O how great is His goodness! He crowns those who have been washed, and those who partake of His Banquet He proclaims victors ( The Life in Christ ).

&quot;First of all, we should note that the Greek word for&quot;sacrament&quot;is mysterion, from which we get mystery. In the Orthodox Church, the sacraments are ususall referred to as the mysteries.

&quot;It is often said that a sacrament is&quot;an outward sign of an invisible grace.&quot;

As the Monuments, Art, Hieroglyphs, and beautifully poetic, enlightened passages in the writings of Egypt are outward signs of their invisible knowledge, understanding, Wisdom, Grace, and power.

&quot;The Church teaches that grace is more than God&apos;s&quot;good favor&quot;toward man; it is the uncreated energy of God. When God bestows His grace upon man, He is bestowing the gift of Himself. God&apos;s inner nature is incommunicable. Created man can never come to know the inner nature of the uncreated God. Nevertheless, God truly communicates His life to man. When man encounters the grace of God, he encounters God Himself.&quot;

Have a great day!

And yet hath PRAYER, the heav&apos;n-breathing foilage of faith,
found never a place in ethick: for Philosophy
filtering out delusions from her theory of life,
in dread of superstition gave religion away
to priests and monks, who rich in their monopoly
furbish and trim the old idols, that they dare not break,
for fear of the folk and need of good discipline.

But since all men alike, in any strain of heart
or great emotion of soul, credulous or sceptic, fall
instinctivly to prayer for thatt solice and strenght
which they who use the habit may be seen to have found
nay, had Prayer no effect other than reverence
for the self-knowledge, which the Greek enjoin&apos;d, whereby
&apos;tis sovran to bind character, concentrate the Will,
and purify intentionnay, ev&apos;n so twould claim
a place among the causes of determine&apos;d flux.

Ah! tho&apos; it may be a simple thing in reach of all,
Best ever is rare, a toilsome guerdon; and prayer is like
those bodily exercises that athletes will use,
which each must humbly learn, and ere he win the power
so diligently practise, and in such strict course
as will encroach unkindly on the agreement of life:
whence men slouch in the laxity that they call case,
rather than rouse to acquiring thatt strenght, without which
the body cannot know the pleasur of its full ease,
the leisur of strenght in the hard labor of life.

Now every emotion hath the bodily expression
beseeming each; and since the body cannot
be without some attitude, so Prayer will hav its own:
and here just as in any atheletic exersice
ther be postures and motions foolish in themselves
and often undignified, so too the posture of prayer
may shame our pride of spirit, which would grudge the limbs
warrant of entry upon her sacred solitudes;
albeit the body come there in full abject guize
to do submission and pay fealty to the soul:
And since our speech, in its mere vocal cries and calls,
hath less natural beauty and true significance
than the bodily gestures which convey desires,
so ev&apos;n the word will lack in dignity
and seem impertinent; as full often they be,
and ever had been, unless man&apos;s language had upgrown
from makeshift unto mastery of his thought, and learn&apos;d
by its fine musing art to redeem for his soul
the beauty of holiness, marrying creativly
his best earthly delight with his heav&apos;nliest desire,
when he calleth on God, Send forth thy light and truth
that they may lead me and bring me onto the Holy Hill
to thatt fair place which is the joy of the whole earth. 

The Divine Poet Re: The Secret of the Universe

Courtesy of my Teacher

Meister Eckhart&apos;s road to Perfection

&quot;. . . if the divine light shines in me, it must be shrouded, as my soul is shrouded.&quot;- Pseudo-Dyonysius

&quot;The first type of person is&quot;not alive to it [the inner light]. They are like cattle, not capable of receiving it.&quot;The first category then, is as unconscious of the inner light as are the animals.&quot;To the second group a little light appears. Like the flash of a sword being forged.&quot;The illumination is perceived for only an instant and then the person is plunged into darkness again.&quot;The third get more of it, like a great flash of lightning, which is bright, and then immediately dark again. They are all those who fall away from the divine light again into sin.

&quot;The fourth group receives more of it, but sometimes He [the inner light] withdraws Himself for no other purpose but to spur her [the soul] on and increase her desire.
The fifth are aware of a great light as bright as day, but still as it were through a chink. As the soul says in the Book of Love: &apos;My beloved looked at me through a chink. His face was comely.&apos; About this St. Augustine says,&quot;Lord, thou givest me sometimes such great sweetness that, if it were perfected in me, is this is not heaven I know not what heaven can be.&quot;

The Four Kinds of Ecstacy

&quot;The first (kind of ecstasy) is that of intention, when one spurns all creatures and is joyned to God alone in love. . . The first is the ecstacy of love, according to Dionysius.&quot;

The second consists in imaginative or spiritual vision, as when one is drawn by some supernatural power to see things supernaturally without the use of the senses or external sensible objects . . . The second is the spirit in which John (Apocalypse 1:9-10 found themselves.&quot;

&quot;The third is when the mind is withdrawn or rapt from sense and imagination to intellectual vision, whereby it sees God by intelligible infusions . . . The third is the sleep or trance of Adam referred to in Genesis (2:12).&quot;

&quot;The fourth occurs when the mind itself sees God in himself through His essence . . . The fourth is Paul&apos;s ecstacy which we have been discussing. These three terms, ecstacy, trance, and rapture, are frequently understood in the same sense in the Scriptures.&quot;

&quot;I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Christ Jesus, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Christ Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord&apos;s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.&quot;

&quot;And as he [Saul of Tarsus] journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying onto him, &apos;Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?&apos; And he said, &apos;Who art thou, Lord?&apos; And the Lord said, &apos;I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.&apos; And he trembled and astonished said, &apos;Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?&apos; And the Lord said unto him, &apos;Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.&apos;

This is a well known passage, probably everyone knows already that Paul is&quot;Saul of Tarsus&quot;, but when he was&quot;in the Spirit&quot;in&quot;the kingdom and patience of Christ Jesus&quot;, he was&quot; in the isle that is called Patmos&quot;, the kingdom within. In the outer world, no man is an island, but whenever a man is said to sojourn on an island, or goes into a cave, he goes to the kingdom of his heart, or sees with the eyes of his heart.

 http://www.sacred-destinations.com/greece/patmos-cave-of-apocalypse.htm 

Besides the metaphorical meaning mentioned in your quote from Miester Ekchart, Patmos is a real place where John the Theologian was exiled to when he had his Apocalyptic Revelation.

My family and I visited there three years ago. It was the last place we stayed in Greece before going on to Israel. Once we were there on Patmos, we wished we had planned to stay more than three days. It was absolutely incredible. The entire Island was permeated with the vision that John received when he was there.

Everyone we met and talked to while we were there, it was like the events that took place had happened to one of their neighbors, not to some historical character 1900 yrs ago.

I really hope to be able to go back again someday! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Sept 12, 2009, 11:29am

Yes, I know, and had I known about Orthodoxy when visiting Greece, Mt. Athos and Patmos would have been on the agenda, and I can easily understand why Patmos is called a Holy Island. At the times I thinking about visiting Patmos, alas....

Some pages back you said that John the Theologian is one of your Favorite Apostles and I wrote a bit on it. There is an Icon of St. John and Prochorus, and on the opposite page one of&quot;The Holy Cave of the Apocalypse, Patmos&quot;, in my book&quot;The Loves of the Holy Apostles&quot;. I looked at many Icons this morning and as before, I marveled how the Icons, though painted by different &apos;hands&apos;, have so nearly the self-same artistic rendering and quality as if made by one hand, the eyes of almost all Images as if making direct contact with one&apos;s Soul.

Saint John and Prochorus

&quot;On the same island, it is also known that St. John wrote the Apocalypse. Tradition relates that one day John and his disciple Prochorus departed from the city to a grotto in the wilderness, where he spent ten days with Prochorus and another ten days alone. During these latter ten days he are nothing, but only prayed to God, entreating Him to reveal what he should do. A voice came to John from on high, saying:&quot;John, John!&quot;And he answered:&quot;What dost thou command, Lord?&quot;The voice from on high said:&quot;Wait ten days, and thou shalt receive a revelation of much that is great.&quot;John remained there ten more days without food. Then something marvelous occurred: the angels of God came down to him and related to him many ineffable things. When Prochorus returned, he sent him back for ink and paper, and for two days thereafter he dictated to Prochorus the revelation he had received, and his disciple wrote them down.&quot;

&quot;The following day, John said to me: &apos;Prochorus my son, let us go into the countryside of this island to teach those people before we depart.&apos; So we left and went to a place called Agrikia, where there was a priest of Zeus by the name of Eucharis. He had a blind son who eagerly listened to the sweet words of John. Suddenly, he cried out:&quot;Teacher, by the God Whom thou preachest, I delight in listening to thy goodly words! Entreat Him on my behalf, that I may behold thy face and further rejoyce.&apos; The John took pity on him, perceiving that he had faith enough to be saved. He took him by the hand and, making the sign of the honorable Cross, said: &apos;In the name of Jesus Christ, recover thy sight!&apos; Straightway, his vision was restored. His father, Eucharis, beholding the healing of his son, fell to John&apos;s feet, reverencing him and begging him to come into his home and make him and all his house servants of Christ. So we went and, after lenghty instruction by John, he baptized them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&quot;

Again, it is useful to read on the consubstantial Holy Trinity. John was a miracle-worker. Reading in this Book is akin to reading the the exhilerating words of the Divine Poet, it&apos;s hard to stop.

Today, I hope to speak with&quot;the fool of Christ&quot;at Redondo Beach, &apos;twill be interesting to find out what he thinks about Orthodoxy.

I also remembered my Phi-Teacher saying that the Relics of Saints are&quot;radioactive&quot;, and when moved from one place to another the greatest care was taken.

I have spent all morning helping to hang Icons on the Iconostasis of our new Church in which we will be having services for the first time tomorrow morning. We are expecting over 100 people. And then, sometime soon, His Grace Bishop Maxim will come to officially consecrate our new Church building.

After the lives of the Apostles, I think you will really enjoy the lives and sayings of the desert fathers of the Egyptian Thebaid as recounted in&quot;The Paradise of the Holy Fathers,&quot;who are also next in chronological order as far as the&quot;Golden chain&quot;of Sanctity is concerned.

Have a great weekend! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Sept 13, 2009, 6:51pm

Seems we were bussy with Icons. Thank you for the beautiful one of St. Spyridon.... I was actually in Nafplio, would have loved to see His Church. In the very beginning of this thread I found a very long and interesting article on the Saints Life, others discribe it pretty much the same, so I&apos;ll keep looking.

Yesterday, Father Aquaro was outside inspecting the paint of St. Matthew and what decoration might be nice and appropriate. It is just plain white, but has arches where a muted border might give it definition, I thought. We spoke for a while concerning my current situation, that I attend St. Stephen on Sunday, that I have been reading and learning, also much from my &apos;Mentor&apos; online.

&apos;The Loves of the Holy Apostles&apos; was a rather gentle slip....I&apos;m looking forward to read about the Desert Fathers, have read some of their sayings.

I liked the Vesper Text, as I do all of them, and would always like to read them, have to check back to the one&apos;s you posted if there are further links.

&quot;The Vesper service in the Church always begins with chanting the evening psalm:&quot;...the sun knows it&apos;s time for setting, Thou makest darkness and it is night.....&quot;This psalm, which glorifies God&apos;s creation of the world, is man&apos;s first act of worship, for man first of all meets God as Creator.&quot;

Today, the Serbian Saints were honored; Father Ceko spoke of fate, that nothing happens by accident; an Epistle Commentary from St. Paul about the &apos;spiritual medicine&apos;; from the Gospel of Matthew the parable of the Kingdom of Heaven being&quot;like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son&quot;, his servants called all those who were invited &apos;to the wedding&apos; to the &apos;diner&apos; the king had prepared, &apos;but they made light of it&apos;, but they were too bussy, even &apos;treated them spitefully, and killed them&apos;.

The king was &apos;furious&apos; and sent out an army to kill the murderers, burn their city, and told his servants to go into the streets and invite those not originally chosen, good and bad, to the wedding. All were given wedding garments to wear, except one man who attended &apos;on his own terms, rejecting God&apos;s plan - and was thrown out of the Banquet&apos;.

I had a relatively long and clear dream, in three parts, concerning this subject, and purchased a new &apos;dream book&apos; for further recording.

Robert eluded me again, I think I have to asked the &apos;locals&apos; when he is about.

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Sept 14, 2009, 11:28am

If one could communicate with a sparrow, imparts the Divine Poet, and asked him why he builds a nest, he would answer &apos;because I must&apos;.

&apos;Tis how I felt this morning in following St. Spyridon from the Ionian Island Corfu where the Saint&apos;s relics rest in a pure silver casket in the St. Spyridon Cathedral, Kerkyra, to Cyprus where the most venerable Saint was born in 270 AD.

The Island abounds with Saints, many of whom I never heard of, and the monumental History of the Orthodox Church, though I gleaned parts of from what I read thus far, and paintings, is taking on universal proportions.

I have traced relatively few accounts from Egypt to Los Angeles and summed up my understanding thereof, in Orthodoxy I find the same history but after another manner. I met all those I learned about and many whom I love, viz., from the Saints we speak of, the Knights Templar and Hospitaler, Personages of the Florentine Renaissance, to the Kings of England, and America is also mentioned. My horizon is ever widening and it is marvelous.

Cyprus, an island in the Mediterranean Sea,&quot;surpasses every other Greek island in the number of natives illustrious for their birth, dignity, learning and saintliness, - Strabo says of the island of&quot;Cyprus that&quot;it yields to no other island in excellence.&quot;

Among the villages of Cyprus,&quot;Tremitugia is a village 12 miles to the west of Nicosia. It was formerly a city called Tremitus, destroyed by Richar, King of England, when he took the island. Ptolemaeus, the geographer, put it in his list of the cities of Cyprus (lib. v. 4, Asia, c. XIV.) St Spyridon, a native of Cyprus, was bishop of Tremitus, and was present in a.d. 325 at the Coucil of Nicaea. There are full accounts of him in the Ecclesiastical History of Socrates, i. 12, and that of Zozomen, i. 11. Its lands, like those of the inland villages genarally, are devoted to all kinds of food stuffs, with cotton, silk, olives and wine.

Dali is a village on a hill, 12 miles south of Nicosia. The situation is pleasant, and even beautiful, for there are little woods round it, excellent water, and a quantity of sweet smelling herbs, particularly marjoram. Virgil mentiones it, Aeneid i. 691 (Bowen)&quot;

I also read that on a Mt. Olympus there, or perhaps on the slopes, grow the most equisite and best of muscat grapes, and the wines they yield is called&quot;wines of Commandery&quot;. This may be why there are vines and grapes depicted with St. Spyridon on the Icon. But grapes and wine are ever symbols of transformation.

On Cyprus,&quot;among the venomous beasts there is a kind of snake, which the Greeks call Kov&lt;t&gt;7], or deaf, whose bite is mortal. The longest are two feet in lenght, and their thickness across about a thumb&apos;s lenght. They are yellow and black, and have two little horns on the head. The Greeks err in calling it the deaf snake, as it is certainly not deaf, for the peasants when they reap corn, among which it chiefly lives, to guard themselves from its attack, besides keeping their boots always on their feet, also have little bells bound to their sickles to alarm and scare them away. I ought to add before leaving the subject that at Tremitiu, a village in the island, is a Greek family which is said to enjoy the hereditary virtue of curing persons bitten by these serpents. I have seen myself two persons who within twenty-four hours after the bite presented themselves to one of this family, and by a simple pressure of the wound were healed. On the other hand others who have died who did not seek, or who despised, this remedy. But it is true that their virtue consists in a particular secret, for when they press the affected part, they deftly apply some powder which causes severe but momentary pain.&quot;

I am healing just writing about it.

&quot;The Greeks baptise by immersion, but use in Cyprus many ceremonies not prescribed in their rituals. They rarely confer this sacrament before the eight day after birth. A Latin who wishes to join their communion must be rebaptised, just as they would rebaptise a Greek who had become a Catholic, and then wished again to return to their church.

&quot;The screen which divides the choir from the Sancta Sanctorum^ in this church of St Lazarus, as in all churches of the Greek rite, is made of wood carved and gilded, and adorned with various pictures of saints, painted on wood, as the Greeks must not adore any figure in relief which represents the Lord, or the Virgin Mary or the saints.

&quot;In every Greek church is an episcopal throne, which stands at the entrance of the choir, but always on the left side (in cornu epistolae). These seats are made of wood, with carved foliage, and inlaid with mother of pearl and tortoise shell, but in St Lazarus is a very ancient throne, transported there from another church; many foreign visitors have remarked on the perfection of its carving, but it is in no wise esteemed by the Greeks, who have lost all taste and all notion of the beautiful.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus 

The perfection of the carving reminds me of that little Church in Galaxia near Delphi. I forgot to say, that yesterday during the Matins and Holy Liturgy the incense vessel was held silent.

I read more of this very interesting historical account written in 1768 by a traveler, of Saints and wars, travel and trade between Europe, in particular Venice, the Levant and goods of Cyprus. Noteworthy is a snippet of one Count Nestor Martinego, who returned from Famagusta to report of events to the Doge of Venice, recorded in&quot;a little pamphlet&quot;bearing&quot;the imprint&quot;Venetia, Appresso Giorgia Angelieri, md. lxxii.&quot;Within a year it was translated into English, French, and German; and borrowed almost verbatim , but without acknowledgement, by Calepio, Bizarri, Sereno, Foglietta and Graziana. As the report of all the Successes of Fainagosta it was&quot;Englished out of Italian&quot;by William Malin, and&quot;Imprinted at London by John Daye, an. 1572.&quot;

&quot;Malim&apos;s version, a rare volume (7^ x 51 in.) comprises, besides&quot;The true Report a title and epistle to the Earl of Leicester, Baron of Denbigh ....&quot;

I wrote this because John Done, born in 1572, is mentioned in my book&quot;The Faith&quot;, and Stephen also connected the Poet and Priest to this thread. The Earl of Leicester is noted, so it seems there was communication between the Levant and England, and the Anson&apos;s of Shugborough also come into the picture. A huge part of history here.

For women readers here, one more exerpt concerning Turkish women of the time:

&quot;A Turkish women cannot, like a man, obtain a divorce without reason given. But she is entitled to demand it when her husband does not give her sufficient food: if he does not admit her to his bed once in eight days, and if he does not giver her money to go to the bath. In these cases the man is obliged to release her, to restore her dowry, and to maintain the children.&quot;

If the husband&apos;s offence is particularly grievous, she takes off her boots or slippers and places them up-side-down before the judge, upon which the husband&quot;is beaten on the soles of his feet, and seperated forthwith from his wife, without getting a chance of excusing himself.&quot;Seems justice for women was more even-handed then as it is now in some parts of the world.

Dear Charlotte,

I hope you get an opportunity to read,&quot;This rough magic,&quot;by Mary Stewart to see what you think about one of the main character&apos;s (Who is a famous Shakespearean actor,) theory that Prospero in,&quot;The Tempest,&quot;is based on St.Spyridon. His explanation in the book makes sense to me and, in terms of,&quot;Poetic Justice&quot;it explains so much of what has happened to me throughout my life!

Thought for the day: We are primarily telepathic beings and the more we uncover this ability within ourselves the more clear and possible everything becomes. It is the role of the Church to assist us in this process in every way .

The book has been on my mind, as well as your words of re-reading the Tempest, and I will read it. In light of what I learn

The gist of it did not escape my mind,

Robert was beside his van today, I parked beside it.

&quot;Hi Robert, I have seen you here for many years and thought I stop to see how you&apos;re doing. Last time I was here, a gentleman told me you&apos;re name is Robert and that you think the King James Bible is the one to have.

R. Yes, how are you?

C. I&apos;m fine, how is life?

R. Let&apos;s go over here in the shade.

C. OK, I brought you an Icon of the Transfiguration, do you like it?

R. Umm, I see feet, no flesh should show hmmm.

C. That&apos;s minor, if you don&apos;t like it I&apos;ll take it back Did you know Sir Francis Bacon translated the Bible out of the Original and dedicated it to King James I, who was King of England at the time?

R. Don&apos;t worship the man, worship God!

C. I&apos;m not worshiping the man, but speaking of a book and thought you like to know since you think it&apos;s the best version.

R. Never leave the world of God, I never leave the world of God. Kicks the leafs: anybody can write a book, a leaf can write a book, with God all things are possible, Jesus Christ himself wrote the Bible.

Without pause Robert goes on about this and the other for about five minutes. I finally got a word in sideways:

C. Pardon me, do you belong to any Religion?

R. They are all of the Devil, I go to them to tell them of their blessings, that Jesus Christ has annointed me, but they don&apos;t listen, they think I&apos;m crazy. Are you Catholic?

C. No, I go to an Orthodox Church.

Robert rails against Religions for another five minutes, and against the courts where he told the Judge that he was annointed by Jesus and cannot be judged anyone, and was held in contempt.

C. What do you think of the Orthodox Church?

R. Ortho what?

C. The Orthodox Church, the Originial Apostolic Church, the Church Fathers, Saints and Martyrs, you know.

R. Apostolic, I hear Apostles.

C. Yes, the Church of the Apostles.

R. If it&apos;s Originial it must be the right one. I am a Saint and Martyr, Jesus has annointed me, I am the Saint of this Country, but nobody listens.

Robert launched into another rant about the wickedness of the world and showed me passgae from the Bible about the whirlwind coming from the desert, I forgot the rest, and asked me if I knew what it meant. No, but he couldn&apos;t explain it.

C. I have to go now. You don&apos;t like the Icon so I&apos;ll take it with me.

R. No no, I like it.

C. Next time I go to Trader Joe&apos;s I&apos;ll stop and say hello.

R. If you go there you can get me this juice, and stop by again.

He takes a very warm glass bottle out of his van.

C. I have to go but I&apos;ll give you some money and you can buy it, you know exactly what you like.

R. O .... Blessing, stop by again, you&apos;re the only person who talked to me today, nobody ever talks to me, maybe we can become friends.

R. Where is the Church you said you go to, maybe I can go there too.

C. It&apos;s in Alhambra.

R. Um that&apos;s too far.

C. See you later Robert, take care.

Robert, now smiling: ok stop by again.

For bout half an hour he went on about this and that, disjointed, even interrupting I could not hold him to one subject for more than five seconds, but I&apos;ll stop by again.

Hi Don,

I couldn&apos;t grasp one yarn and strech it as Robert jumped in mid sentence from one subject to another without rhyme and reason. Next time I will ask if we could speak&quot;only of that&quot;for a few minutes, but, whenever I said something he would shoot back &apos;don&apos;t tell me - question me - I was annointed by Christ, instantly rejecting even the sound of my voice, but in due course he became less defensive, and in the end,&quot;maybe we can become friends.&quot;


St. Spyridon, the Shepherd and Thaumaturgist, whose name means &apos;round wicker basket&apos; in Greek.

&quot;Faith in St. Spyridon involves many speacial features with no equivalent in Christianity.&quot;Words to a wise Philosopher:

&quot;The saint began,&quot;God, who created heaven and earth, is One. He fashioned man from the earth and created everything that exists, both visible and invisible, by His Word and His Spirit. That Word, we affirm, is the Son of God, the true God, who showed mercy on us who had gone astray. He was born of the Virgin, lived among men, suffered the passion, died for our salvation and arose from the dead, raising the human race together with Himself. We await His coming again to judge all with righteousness and to reward each one according to his faith. We believe that He is consubstantial with the Father, dwelling together with Him and equally honered. We believe all these things without having to examine how they come to be; nor should you be so brazen as to question them, for these matters exceed the comprehension of man and far surpass all knowledge.

&quot;Silent for the moment, the bishop then continued,&quot;Can&apos;t you now realize how true all of this is, O philosopher? Consider this smple and humble example. We are created and mortal being and are not worthy to resemble the One who is divine in being and ineffable. Since we tend to believe more readily through what the eyes perceive than through what we merely hear with our ears, I want to prove something to you using this brick. It is composed of three elements which combine to make one single being and nature.

&quot;Saying this, Saint Spyridon made the sign of the holy Cross with his right hand while holding the brick in his left, and said,&quot;In the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot;, while squeezing the brick. At once, flames rose into the air, water poured down upon the ground and clay alone remained in his hand.

&quot;Those who were eyewitnesses to this miracle were filled with fear, especially the philosopher. He remained speechless, like one who had been mute from birth, and found no words to respond to the saint in whom Divine power had been manifested, according to what is written:&quot;The kingdom of God is not in words, but in power.&quot;

And so it is also written in the beginning and throughout this thread. On the Icon of St. Spyridon on the previous page, the Saint holds a brick in his hand from which emanate flames, so when reading the first paragraph of believing without having to examine, or brazenly question matters exeeding the comprehension of man and surpass all knowledge, one has to think on who speaks them, viz., The Illuminated, the Real Illuminate. My great Love Francis:

&quot;As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
The mind that I do, what a sleep were this
For your advancement! Do you understand me?&quot;

Hi Charlotte.

I truly see the world completely differently than you do these days.

Here is my latest post to Facebook and Graham ...

 The real answer to it all ... you might not like it 

Author: Ahatmose (---.141.93.0)
Date: 17-Sep-09 14:34

My post from Facebook: (amended)

Hi Gary and Tracy et all. Where is this all going ? Well if I might jump the gun just a bit here is what I believe is happening. The Mayan myths suggest that this present age is going to end by fire. Now fire is a most interesting word for it can be the actual burning process itself or it can be something completely different like the fire in his eyes or the fire in his soul. I think, (we should be so lucky) that the end of the present era is going to indeed end by fire but it will be THE FIRE OF THE KUNDALINI ... it will the the fire of the awakening. And you know if we think about it the last age ended with water, or so they say and doesn&apos;t water put out fire ? So do we have the true symbolism of Genesis ? Banished out of The Eden of our beginnings to spend the next era waiting for it to return or striving for it to return. So was the taking of the fruit actually really the opening of the flood waters or was The Deluge as symbolized by Noah and his ark the actual end of the last spiritual era ? For if you knew this reality was not real why would you have any restraints whatsoever and is Sodom and Gomorrah simply another metaphor for the total lack of inhibition of Mankind during any period when he knows The Truth? Is this the secret that The Church tries to hide? That whatever we do, and I mean whatever has little or no consequence. The world would be chaos ... Hmmm ... out of the chaos ... Was Ancient Egypt already in tune with this until the end of The IVth Dynasty and were the two crowns really simply the symbolism of the joining of the upper and lower mind. It all makes perfect sense. The Ancient Egyptians knew as did Pythagoras and The Secret Schools of The Ancient Greeks. It was also know in Medieval times and of course in The Renaissance. A fabric through time ... I started a web page on this theme once but could not get my head completely around it. Now it becomes as a high definition image. Crystal clear ...

God gave Noah the rainbow sign

As Don has just said: The fire of awakening and transformation.

A Purifying fire which will dissolve everything that separates us from our complete union with God.

From our Deified minds will spring a new creation altogether.

Don believes that we see things differently. I believe that we see the same things in a different language.

Only the end of time will tell...(And I hope it&apos;s coming soon! 2012 would be great as far as I&apos;m concerned!)

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Sept 18, 2009, 9:35am

Err, Don, as I said before, we don&apos;t see the world completely different, but only from different angles to the same goal. The &apos;end of the world&apos; and this re-birth we speak of, known by the Ancient Egyptians, the Double Crown, the Great Pyramid (Khu Fu, center of the Galaxy), Pythagoras, The Secret School of The Ancient Greeks, the Medieval times, the Renaissance, you forgot Sir Francis Bacon, I have not departed from, in the greater Scheme of Things. The present era, you contend, will end by the fire of the Kundalini, the fire of awakening etc.

&quot;The Truth! Is this the secret that The Church tries to hide?&quot;I don&apos;t know what Church you have in mind, if you mean the Orthodox - is not hiding but veiling things for those who have acquired eyes to see and ears to hear, to discern, as one is not to speak openly to its enemies - the prejudging closed mind, of the Mysteries, profaning them, but participating in Theosis &apos;in the closet&apos; to attain Union with God. Doing it, becoming it, which speaking about prevents. Did you really look at the Icon of St. Spyridon on the previous page?

&quot;The Mayan myths suggest that this present age is going to end by fire.&quot;

The Maya Calendar ending 2012 indicates a greater Phoenix cycle of 5000 years, and return of Quetzalcoatl, the Quetzal Bird with a cherished long green feather, air, and Coatl the Serpent, earth, and as our Friend Paul has it,&quot;in the union of Heaven and Earth all things come forth.&quot;The Wedding. The Maya too have a Creator, their account more beatiful than that and Heaven too, truly!

The Popol Vuh

&quot;THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE ANCIENT WORD, here in this place called Quich. Here we shall inscibe, we shall implant the Ancient Word, the potential and source for everything done in the citadel of the Quich, in the nation of the Quich people.

&quot;And here we shall take up the demonstration, revelation, and account of how things were put in shadow and brought to light by

 the Maker, Modeler,
named Bearer, Begetter,
Hunahpu Possum, Hunahpu Coyote,
Great White Peccary, Coati,
Sovereign Plumed Serpent
Heart of the Lake, Heart of the Sea,
plate shaper, bowl shaper, as they are called,
also named, also described as
the midwife, matchmaker
named Xpiyacoc, Xmucane,
defender, protector
twice midwife, trice matchmaker. 

as is said in the words of the Quich. They accounted for everythingas enlightened beings, in enlightened words. We shall write about this now amid the preaching of God, iri Christendom now. We shall bring it out because there is no longer

 a place to see it, a Council Book&apos;
a place to see&quot;The Light That Came from
Beside the Sea,&quot;
the account of&quot;Our Place in the Shadows.&quot;
a place to see&quot;The Dawn of Life,&quot; 

as it is called. There is the original book and ancient writing, but the one who reads and accesses it has a hidden identity. It takes a long performance and account to complete the lighting of all sky-earth:

 the fourfold siding, fourfold cornering,
measuring, fourfold staking,
halfing the cord, streching the cord
in the sky, on the earth,
the four sides, the four corners, as it is said,
by the Maker, Modeler,
mother-father of life, of humankind,
giver of breath, giver of heart,
bearer, upbringer in the light that lasts
of those born in the light, begotten in the light;
worrier, knower of everything, whatever there is:
sky-earth, lake-sea. 

Does this sound familiar? The Hopi too have One Creator, infinate, creating his Son to carry out his plan, and affirm that&quot;the living body of man and the living body of the earth were constructed in the same way. Through each ran an axis....&quot;Considering the signs of the time, severe weather, melting polar caps etc., and worse to come, then, would mean that the earth serpent, fire from the core, is stirring and a &apos;collective&apos; awakening is on the way.

&quot;But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works are therin shall be burned up.&quot;

We also speak in profound terms of ushering in a more Glorious Reality for Individuals. The Universe works in uni-son, the great change observable everywhere in the World, playing out in Politics. Obama is our President not by accident, and not unaware of these things,&quot;we are the ones we have been waiting for&quot;, and jokes that he was actually born on Krypton and send by his father Jor El to save the planet Earth. He is brilliant and plays his cards very carefully. One has to see between events and read between the lines, fill in and understand rightly.

&quot;But grow in Peace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and forever. Amen.&quot;

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Sept 18, 2009, 3:35pm

&quot;We are luminous beings. We are perceivers. We are an awareness; we are not objects; we have no solidity. We are boundless. The world of objects and solidity is a way of making our passage on earth convenient. It is only a description that was created to help us. We, or rather our reason , forget that the description is only a description and thus we entrap the totality of ourselves in a vicious circle from which we rarely emerge in our lifetime.
We are perceivers. The world that we perceive, though, was created by a description that was told to us since the moment we were born.

I&apos;m going to tell you about the tonal (pronounced, toh-na&apos;hl) and the nagual (pronounced, nah-wa&apos;hl). Every human being has two sides, two separate entities, two counterparts which become operative at the moment of birth; one is called the&quot;tonal&quot;and the other the&quot;nagual.&quot;
The tonal is the social person. The tonal is, rightfully so, a protector, a guardian--a guardian that most of the time turns into a guard.
The tonal is the organizer of the world. Perhaps the best way of describing its monumental work is to say that on its shoulders rests the task of setting the chaos of the world in order. It is not farfetched to maintain, as sorcerers do, that everything we know and do as men is the work of the tonal . At this moment, for instance, what is engaged in trying to make sense out of our conversation is your tonal ; without it there would be only weird sounds and grimaces and you wouldn&apos;t understand a thing of what I&apos;m saying.
I would say then that the tonal is a guardian that protects something priceless, our very being. Therefore, an inherent quality of the tonal is to be cagey and jealous of its doings. And since its doings are by far the most important part of our lives, it is no wonder that it eventually changes, in every one of us, from a guardian into a guard. A guardian is broad-minded and understanding. A guard, on the other hand, is a vigilante, narrow-minded and most of the time despotic. I say, then, that the tonal in all of us has been made into a petty and despotic guard when it should be a broad-minded guardian.

To be sensitive is a natural condition of certain people. In the final analysis sensitivity matters very little. What matters is that a warrior be impeccable. What matters to a warrior is arriving at the totality of oneself.&quot;

The Orthodox way of life is an organic,gradual and consistent means of reaching the&quot;Totality of oneself.&quot;

Our sense of self and our perception of the world that we are familiar with, is meant to be a&quot;Home base&quot;and a&quot;Stepping off place&quot;into other realities and other means of perceiving reality.

The guardian, spoken of in the passage above, is meant to protect and preserve our&quot;Home base&quot;so that we have a fixed identity to return to, not keep us from ever leaving!

The ultimate aim of Orthodoxy is to strengthen, balance and preserve our&quot;Home base,&quot;while at the same time, freeing us up to be able to perceive, experience and act in the infinite and limitless other possible realities which co-exist simultaneously together.

In my OPINION, (I may very well be wrong about this,but here goes...)

There are many different paths which are intended to lead to the same place and many different&quot;languages&quot;trying to describe those various paths. Each of these different paths have their own set of beliefs and practices.

I believe that it is possible to understand and accept many different beliefs at the same time, but when it comes to having a practice, which is the practical MEANS of ACCOMPLISHING whatever it is we believe in, at the end of the day, we have to settle down and pick ONE particular path to follow. That, in fact, each path is a complete package as far as practice is concerned and that it is less than helpful to try to cobble together a practice out of several different paths.(Or, have no practice at all...)

This is where I always seem to run into trouble with other people, besides the fact that I have happened to choose Christianity as my chosen path, (The worst one! as far as most people are concerned...) But the fact that I have chosen ANY one in particular path to practice, seems to be betraying all of the other possibly valid paths.

I get this response a lot from various people I have spoken to over the years. How dare I just choose one path in particular over all the others! How spiritually chauvinistic of me!

I can&apos;t help it though. This is the path I was called to that works best for me. It&apos;s not like I&apos;m trying to force everyone to take the path I&apos;m on. I just highly recommend that they pick ONE path,whichever it may be, and make use of THE WHOLE PACKAGE which that path offers.

I try to make Orthodoxy available to others because, It&apos;s mine, it works, and not many people know it exists. But I&apos;m not stuck on it for everyone. Pick any one that you think will work for you and go with it, that&apos;s my motto. (But then people think I&apos;m too liberal and if I REALLY believed in my chosen path, then I should think everyone else&apos;s is wrong! You just can&apos;t win.)

I wonder, however, if I had chosen to be a Buddhist and to adhere strictly to the Eight-fold path, if I would get as much flack? Probably!

Sorry. I just had to vent a little bit this morning. I&apos;m better now.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Sept 20, 2009, 9:57am

Good Morning!

May be that my clip was too long besides repeating the eye of a child, or something, but I loved speeding with the rocket to the sound of ten million Butterflies sneezing to tranquility.

It is true, that he who is closest to the Target catches the most flack.

Pretty much in the beginning of this yarn you emphasized that one should choose a path and make us of the whole package, and I thoughtm what if I don&apos;t like all parts of the package. My biggest hinderance was the word&quot;Orthodoxy&quot;, evoking concepts such as rigid, strictly following rules, which, other than the Ethical, I rebelled against all my life. My unflattering opinion of Orthodox Scholarship also loomed over my head, besides few other things, but I must be granted an open Mind.

A Synapsis

It didn&apos;t take long before all this was mitigated, first by what you wrote, compelling, what I read on my own, your continuing annotations and clarifications of being ushered into this marvelous Reality of whatever we Intend coming into being instantaneously and a Life in limitless creative Freedom, was most appealing. Everyone&apos;s hopes and dreams, aware of it or not, but doubting and outright denying the very possibility of it negates the actualization of such a State.

Secondly, in attending Vespers, Matins and the Holy Liturgy I heard much of your words repeated, and discerned a definate purpose in the Ritual being performed, and during yesterdays vesper, and last weekend also during the Vesper, Matins and Holy Liturgy, almost continous humming with the spoken word.

Thirdly, the compatibility of Orthodoxy with the more Spiritual Teachings of Philosophy, in particular Hermes whose words were always hermetically sealed for me; Personages of yesteryear and more recent I am familiar with, historical information, and what I gleaned in the Literature and Icons, among other things. To my own surprise, it didn&apos;t take me long to embrace Orthodoxy because to me also it makes sense, I experience the it working, and following the rules is easy because I like them seeing to what end.

As to being liberal, everyone needs a Pathfinder to begin with and then walk his or her own path, when in earnest it will lead to God, only, methinks the protocol of the&quot;Forcing House&quot;facilitates change in less time and less resistance because subtly, and I hear my Phi-Teacher,&quot;All you have to do is show up&quot;, so I&apos;m off to Church.

I am glad you are better after venting a bit.

Never in a million years, as the saying goes, would I have thought that my weekends and Life would again revolve around a Church as in my childhood, but now, the Orthodox Church, encompasses all I had learned in the interim, affirming things I kept close to my Heart, paramount my sentiment of being immortal, and the only way is up.

Yesterday, the Word was to&quot;get out of the way&quot;of oneself,&quot;and let the light of God&apos;s Glory in Christ shine through the earthen vessel&quot;, and the Love of God is the love for each other and our neighbors, Father Ceko emphasized. I am also beginning to understand why the Resurrection is cited in every Service, and the words,&quot;why do you look for the living among the dead, He is not here, He is Risen.&quot;

I have mentioned before that I loved the repeated devotional chant giving Glory to God in the name of the Holy Trinity, and oft&apos; petitioning for Mercy,&quot;And again let us pray....&quot;for - and from the President of the United States, the Armed Forces, all Peoples and Nations, abused Children, to the Homeless on the streets, and the Heart grows warm.

I also noticed that People walking toward the Altar to receive Holy Communion have their arms crossed over their chest, Pharaoh style. Crossing myself, so awkward in the beginning, not to mention my hand by habit moving from my forehead to the left instead right for weeks, now comes easy and in some such moments spontaneously.

The Church celebrated in preparation for the Nativity of the Holy Theotokos.

&quot;Today the Virgin Theotokos Mary, the bridal chamber of the Heavenly Bridegroom, by the will of God is born of a barren women, being prepared as the chariot of God the Word. She was foreordained for this, since she is the divinte gate of Life.&quot;


Don, you speak of&quot;the real answer&quot;and that I may not like it, it having to do with Kundalini experience. If you have no&quot;Home Base&quot;to keep you grounded, and no help from those who have and live in this Light, how do you make it Real and Permanent on your own? Tongues of fire do not descend on your head by saying it is the Kundalini Fire. It comes by&quot;Grace&quot;of God, the Breath of God, Divine Energy, the Holy Spirit, which strives with us.

Hildegard von Bingen

Fiery Spirit,
fount of courage,
life within life
of all that has being!

Holy are you, transmuting the perfect
into the real.
Holy are you, healing
the motally stricken,
Holy are you, cleansing
the stench of wounds.

Oh sacred breath O blazing
love O savor in the breast and balm
flooding the heart with
the fragrance of good,

O limpid mirror of God
who leads wanderers
home and hunts out the lost,

Armor of the heart and hope
of the integral body,
sword-belt of honor:
save those who know bliss!

Guard those the field holds
imprisoned
free those in fetters
whom divine force wishes to save.

O current of power permiating all
in the heights upon the earth and
in all deeps
you bind and gather
all people together.

Out of your clouds
come streaming, winds
take wing from you, dashing
rain against the stone;
and ever-fresh springs
well from you, washing
the evergreen globe.

O teacher of those who know,
a joy to the wise
is the breath of Sophia.

Praise then be yours!
you are the song of praise,
the delight of life, a hope and a potent honor
granting garlands of light.

O ignis Spiritus Paracliti

Just how do you know that tongues of fire ( the fires of truth I may add) are not The Kundalini ?

If it comes by the grace of your god surely you must ask ... why Don Barone ? Why give Don Barone this gift ? I know, I know your god works in mysterious ways. However I at first suggested we were going toward the light and then it was suggested to me that we were becoming the light. ... But I have just had a thought ... If we are becoming The Light why is it there for all those who have approached death to see ? Go toward the light is the saying. A most perplexing turn of events. How can that which we are apparently becoming already exist ?

Hmmm ...

Don Barone Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Sept 21, 2009, 12:36pm

&quot;How can that which we are apparently becoming already exist?&quot;

&quot;It&quot;exists outside of time and space. We are becoming it inside of time and space.

As for all the rest,it&apos;s all a matter of semantics. And,why not you? You are obviously a seeker after truth. Who better or more suited for this gift? Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Sept 22, 2009, 9:16am

Instead of &apos;real&apos; answer and &apos;real truth, we should just say &apos;answer&apos; and &apos;truth&apos;, as many answers are opinions, and there can&apos;t be a &apos;false&apos; truth, and the Light we speak of is the &apos;uncreated Light&apos; shining in the Kingdom of God, within, toward which we strive.

&quot;Why give Don Barone this gift?&quot;Many people have had the Kundalini Experience via certain methods, to their detriment. All knowledgeable Teachers will warn from forcing the issue, whereas, to repeat,&quot;The Orthodox way of life is an organic, gradual and consistent mean of reaching the Totality of oneself&quot;. I understand this, and all along this thread certain aspects and how it works can be had in simple and informing language.

We can say that all People have the potential and opportunity to be &apos;enlightened&apos;, meaning wholly conscious of everything at once, as were your Maya Priests, as was St. Simeon, the fool for Christ,&quot;possessing abundant grace from God - was able to discern all inner secrets of men, both near and far, healing men from evil spirits and other ailments. Dancing in the streets as one insane, he approached men and whispered their sins in their ears and called them to repentance.&quot;

This means &apos;having been given the gift&apos; or attained to the Light permanently. Can you or I claim the same? No, we have flashes of it spurning us on. Consider the tremendous impact the Experience had on your Mind and Soul, compelling you to keep speaking and writing about it. You call it an&quot;Explosion&quot;in your head, too many neurons firing at once, a sort of intense sparking akin to negative and positive electrical cables making contact, as the Egyptians hinted.

Aforementioned Teachers strongly emphasize that an accomplished Teacher should facilitate the experience, lest we elecrocute ourselves, ask Indiana Jones. In the Orthodox Church, Priests and People alike reach up to Heaven and bring their hand down to the Earth, bringing God&apos;s Grace (energy) and Blessing down to the here and now.

Marvelous, marvelous! This I have learned during 12 years in which Mr. Hall&apos;s PRS (Philosophical Research Society) was my Home, in particular from Siegmund the retired Chemist, and Arthur Young, and remembering Fern&apos;s words that it is incumbent upon Scientists to prove metaphysical Realities, scoffed at for so long as new age inventions and fantasies.

My Mind paused at&quot;the act of observing collapses the wave function&quot;, whereas Mr. Young taught that a decision made causes the collaps. Come to think of it, in observing we do give to chancy shapes a name.

Entering a new dimension now. The elucidation of various things in the entire first link harmonize with the Teachings of the Orthodox Church. I particularely liked the Eye of the Heart, the organ of perception, here, the Heart having its own energy field, the Heart responding first, in five seconds, the body in six seconds before the eye sees a picture, called Intuition.

The many operations on a Salamaders brain and how it rebounded each time is informative, the Holographic Universe affirmed, the erroneous notion&quot;it&apos;s in your genes and there is nothing you can do about it&quot;, and I loved the results of Dr. Emoto&apos;s experiments with water crystals, the emotion of Love a Jewel! But then I would.

Thank you for making my Day, again, I haven&apos;t had time to listen to the second link, and surely will listen to the first again.

All of creation is an on-going miracle that we participate in the creation of.

Ah yes, I grew up in that dreary world of black and white, but I ever only watched it like a movie, as said, I was not from there but dreaming of being part of everything then, flying without knowing it, but &apos;tis now a highest flight, and since flying is the order of the day, and though my dreams were never quite that fantastic in terms of this song, I might chance it.

The ongoing miracle of Creation with our participation as explained&quot;for everyone&quot;, inviting everyone, in the big TOE also, not the little TOE stuck in the box of Physics only. The content of individual consciousness is his ultimate universal reality. Bingo! When listening or speaking to a conscious Person one&apos;s own consciousness is elevated to grasp the meaning, whereas listening to a sleep-walking Person one&apos;s own consciousness is diminished and&quot;the Heart sinks.&quot;It&apos;s been a while since I busied myself with QT and Consciousness, I see the gist of it is still the same and I will selects a few points made in the two links.

Yes. With scientific evidence such as this, it&apos;s difficult to say that the material world is inherently evil or merely a prison for souls. The material world is entirely fluid and takes on the form of whatever pattern is introduced to it.

The only prison is the one in our mind which we have inherited and continue to build onto. And for THAT prison, we have been given the keys to unlocking.

&quot;I built my prison stone by stone.
How many useless knots I tied!
I dug the footfalls in my path.
How many useless tears I cried!

Here to build in worlds of beauty,
no one made a joy a duty.
No one. No one, but me...

I saw the birds that flew so free.
I envied them their grace Divine!
I saw the dancer&apos;s airy steps.
Theirs was a different world than mine!

Here to build in worlds of Glory.
No one made my sad,sad story.
No one. No one,but me.&quot;

The &apos;Incredible String Band&apos; truly is incredible, love the scintillating light between the green and red bird, and the jesting performance of the juggler of something he made brings a smile this morning.

The Eye of the Heart, Eye of the Psyche, of Orthodoxy, the Heart responding first and five seconds before an event of the scientific experiment, can be applied to Mr. Herbert, who found the Anglo Saxon hoard of Gold. Said Mr. Herbert:

&quot;I have this phrase that I say sometimes; &apos;spirits of yesteryear take me where the coins appear&apos;, but on that day I changed coins to gold, - I don&apos;t know why I said it that day but I think somebody was listening and directed me to it.&quot;

In this case it was some hours instead of five seconds as the Spirits perceived his gentle poetic Heart&apos;s intentions, so, same thing.

As an aside, it was reported on NPR that the Gold Treasure was found in Stafforshire, a landholding of Mercia by the river Trent, and that the Anglo Saxon Empire Mercia was ruled by King Panda ca 626-655. I had to look it up and it became somewhat personal. Fragments:

&quot;The army of Wessex pushed the Britons back to the Parret River in 658, but the Mercian army of Wulfhere encroached on the West Saxon territory. At the synod of Whitby in 664 Oswiu accepted Roman Catholic doctrine, and he cooperated with the southern kingdoms he had lost in order to spread Christianity. Seperate convents did not exist for nuns; but there were many double monasteries for monks and nuns, and they were usually headed by an abbess, such as Hild of Whitby.&quot;

The name Whitby makes it personal. I know it doesn&apos;t mean anything to anyone but I had to mention it. Shugborough Hall can also be found in the County of Stafforshire, and so it all hangs together.

While noting important points from the two links apropos our inner state becoming our outer environment, here are some definitions of Orthodox language as I learn them. Hope they are correct.

Orthodoxy = Correctly Believing

Ortho = correct, dokeo = I see, doxa = glory

Hagiography = the study of the Saints

Philocalia = love of the Beautiful

Hesychasm = stillness, rest, quiet, silence

Troparion, a short hymn in one stanza, or one of a series of stanzas, repeated at every service of the day, also an interpolation between Psalms.

Theotokion, a troparion to the Holy Theotokos, Virgin Mother.

Irmos, the initial verse of each individual note in a cannon, sung by the choir, verb:&quot;to tie&quot;,&quot;to link&quot;.

Matins, Greek&quot;morning&quot;,&quot;dawn&quot;or&quot;day break&quot;, used as morning or evening vigil.

Sticheron, a hymn used mainly in Vespers and Matins.

Kontakion, Greek:&quot;from the pole&quot;, type of hymn so loud it had to be hung from a pole. I don&apos;t know what this means.

Father Alexander writes on Lucifer:

&quot;How varied are the paths of saints? At the throne of God, in front of everyone is the Most Holy Mother of God, more glorious than the seraphim and all the angels and archangels who stood firm, faithful to God through the fearful struggle that was raised against God by the most radiant of them all, Lucifer, which means Light-bearer, who is now the devil, in other words, the one cast down to the deepest darkness. In this struggle the bright angels came so close to God that it is already impossible for them to steep back or seperate from God.&quot;

So who made Lucifer the devil? He never was in my eyes, in the greater scheme of things.

Among the Church Fathers is John Chrysostom, Greek for&quot;golden-mouthed&quot;. The Patron of the Tolstoy Family was&quot;a bright, cheerful, gentle soul with a sensitive heart, one of the most eloquent preachers who ever lived since Apostolic times have brought to men the divine tidings of truth and love.&quot;One such tiding:

&quot;For Christians above all men are forbidden to correct the stumblings of sinners by force...it is necessary to make a man better not by force but by persuasion. We neither have the authority granted to us by law to restrain sinners, nor, if it were, should we know how to use it, since God gives the crown to those who are kept from evil, not by force, but by choice.&quot;

&quot;How art thou fallen from heaven,O Lucifer,son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God:I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation.&quot;
Isaiah 14:12-13

Lucifer was an Archangel, the bringer of light, that was what he did for God. Like all Angels, he took the word of God for light and&quot;Stepped it down&quot;into material creation.

Angels were created like human beings, with freedom of will-the freedom to create in harmony and balance with God, or, to choose other than what God INTENDS.

Lucifer, in his desire to be equal to God and, in fact, to exalt himself above God, fell out of the perfect circle of God&apos;s creation, drawing a third of the lesser angels with him.

 http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012&amp;version;=KJV 

God, contemplating the gap left in the perfect circle of creation left by the fall of Lucifer and his angels, created human beings to fill that gap. Human beings with a dual nature, all the Angelic qualities of soul, met together in a physical body, like a perfect diamond, the crown of creation. (Which is why a diamond ring is given in marriage, one of the two paths to sanctity in the Orthodox Church, the other being monastacism.)

Lucifer, seeing man in the very place of equality with God that he had tried to usurp, vows to destroy mankind, if at all possible, and keep them from their Divine birthright.

God allows the devil to tempt man as a touchstone for gold, to see which way our free-will inclines. The devil has no power over us, other than that which we give him by agreeing to act on his suggestions. This is the nature of the&quot;Unseen warfare&quot;that every Orthodox Christian enters into.

The Gnostics will tell you that Lucifer is still on our side. He is trying to help us in our battle against Jehovah, the blind god who created the broken and inherently evil material world, who is the REAL Satan. (But we know that all of that about the material world is incorrect. So, it follows that, etc. etc.)

It&apos;s actually a very popular belief that the devil is simply misunderstood, that he&apos;s really on our side. He&apos;s just trying to help us out, that&apos;s why he showed us how to use fire and all those other helpful technological gadgets we have, so we can&quot;Get around&quot;the hard and unfair consequences of the fall that the mean God has laid on us. (Ann Rice&apos;s,&quot;Memnoch, the Devil&quot;is one of the best and most recent retellings of this tale.)

This is also the source of the Greek myth of Prometheus, who,&quot;Stole&quot;fire from the gods to help mankind.

As Orthodox Christians, however, we realize that God did not cast us out of the Garden to punish us, but to protect us from&quot;Stretching forth our hands and eating also of the tree of life,&quot;and thereby, being confirmed in our fallen state forever, something that would have been the worst malady imaginable.

Instead, he placed us in this much more limited framework of time/space and the laws of physics, where we could do less damage while we were learning from experience to choose to create in harmony with what God INTENDS.

The consequences of the fall are also not meant to be punishments, or something to be&quot;gotten around&quot;by our own cunning and ingenuity, but constant reminders of what we have lost and incentive to regain what it is we have lost, (Namely, our original intimate relationship with God, our original blessed state and our&quot;Likeness&quot;to God.)

It&apos;s all about the use or mis-use, as the case may be, of our complete freedom of will.

The Devil will only be necessary for us for as long as it takes for us to learn how to choose wisely.

Dear Charlotte and ren ...

Although I have always prided myself on having an open mind and being tolerant of almost all points of view the continuing worship of your god and Jesus on this board is growing not only tiresome but bothersome as well.

I am considering shutting it down as I seem to have little to add these days and you two just keep repeating the same old, same old stuff I have heard for 59 years.

Now grant it I have been in a testy mood the last couple of days but this has been grating on my nerves for some time now.

Hi Don,

How can you say nothing but religious &apos;rants&apos; to variety of topics and information offered in this thread?

Why is it bothersome and grating on your nerves? All people on the web speak about what they like best, and most of it all of us have heard since the event of the web also, things being endlessly rehashed. Perhaps it is tiresome for you as the Administrator, but you know well that we don&apos;t need monitoring.

Save in the very beginning, when we spoke about what can be had in news papers and on TV, more or less, and boring, how long have I written on this board on various subjects without input from anyone, as I noted before. How many people are interested in discussing Francis Bacon and the New Atlantis? Apparently people like to read about it, same with the Secrets of the Universe. Is there anything more important than our Immortalty, no matter through which agency we are led. All research, in whatever discipline, and even exchanging whatever on miscellanea and coffee house forums is done to attain it.

As Above So Below serves a purpose, it serves the People who read here and thereby serving Humanity, the Regeneration of Humanity being the noblest cause of all. Collective thinking has to take precedence over all else. Fern.

No matter what outlandish&quot;out of the box&quot;things I wrote anon, it never bothered you. How can Religion, God, Spirituality, Evolution, the laws of Physics, and Alchemy, the oldest and greatest concerns of Mankind, exponded and tolerated on most boards, so rub you the wrong way as to want to shut the board down? But it is your board and I probably lost the only person I could converse with about Religion in the greater scheme of things, and the greater scheme of things is at issue here, Big Time, as the mostly 33 Readers obviously perceive. And where but here,&quot;the most democratic board on the net&quot;, as I call it,&quot;you can talk about anything here&quot;as you have it, could we share our favorite songs in tune with the secrets of the universe?

I hope you give me enough time to print some of the stuff dear to my heart, and that entails almost everything here.

Love

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Sept 26, 2009, 1:02pm

There is an over-arching intelligence which guides the universe to work together for good. Each of us, both individually and collectively IN RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT OVER-ARCHING INTELLIGENCE, co-cooperatively and inter-actively, create the reality we then experience.

This is the&quot;Secret of the universe&quot;which,I believe, is at the heart of every religion,philosophy and spiritual path.

This is all I really had to say. I could have stopped after my first post here, (And it sounds as if you,Don, would have preferred if I had!)

And, as far as the&quot;Countdown to Armageddon&quot;goes, (Which is why and where I posted in the first place...) Armageddon is defined as,&quot;The final battle between good and evil.&quot;Good and evil are determined by the choices we make,again, IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE WISDOM OF THE OVER-ARCHING INTELLIGENCE WHICH GUIDES THE UNIVERSE. If our choices are in harmony and balance with that wisdom, they are&quot;Good&quot;choices. If they are out of balance and harmony, they are&quot;Evil&quot;choices.

Far more important, (to my mind, at least...) than how&quot;Armageddon&quot;will play out, collectively, on the world stage, is the final battle between good and evil which takes place on the battleground of each of our own hearts.

This personal struggle between good and evil is the subject matter of every genuine spiritual practice.

I have chosen Orthodox Christianity as the spiritual practice that I engage in. I highly recommend it to any one who may be interested. It has a two-thousand year old track record of helping individual human beings to attain Self-Realization, Self-Mastery, and victory in this unseen spiritual warfare which we have been discussing.

However, I sincerely believe that ANY genuine spiritual practice, properly understood and diligently acted upon, SHOULD have the same results.

My final advice to the world, before I bid you all another fond farewell, is that you choose a path with heart and follow it all the way to it&apos;s conclusion.

There. I&apos;ve said all there is for me to say!

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Sept 26, 2009, 1:51pm

While I can. Fern elucidated on Lucifer exactly as you do, and again, I understand what you write about being confirmed in our fallen state unable to make our way back to our original Blessed State. Maybe I never saw Lucifer as the Devil because I never felt a Devil having power over me, well, maybe a little huh, when I let an unattractive thought enter or speak unkind, but I&apos;m checking myself. I still have the Satanic Majestic Request album and remember when listening to it, I took it as describing the nature of the game the Devil plays and as an informative warning.

Anyway, I wanted to state a few points Mr. Peniak makes.

1. Metaphysics, consciousness, Spirituality, or anything nonphysical is still anathema to mainstream science, which after all this time is really unbelievable. The Gentleman also says that it is unfortunate that scientists yet see the world through Neutinian glasses, that Newton described the planetary motions as mechanical, in which case neither Mr. Peniak nor scientists see the Mind of Newton, a religious man,&quot;who believed that the regularities of the planetary motion were evidence for the divine&quot;, and I have to add the famous quote in saying,&quot;Laplace, his successor, did not.&quot;To Napoleon&apos;s inquiry why he had written his&quot;Celestial Mechanics&quot;with no reference to its Maker, Laplace replied:&quot;Sire, I have no need of that hypothesis.&quot;

2. The physical world with all its energies we are able to measure accounts only for 4% of all there is according to the latest calculation of Astrophysics. Fern used to hit the glass table when speaking of&quot;them&quot;and their energies and forces and spinning cobwebs around&quot;their&quot;theories. I don&apos;t spin thus.

3. All particles are interconnected/entangled. A particle in this galaxy is able to effect another particle in another Galaxy instantaneously, (Einstein&apos;s spooky action at a distance), hence all events are entngled via an energy field that fills all space. Entnglement does indeed exist, and our Mind, Consciousness, and the act of observing fix our reality. Same as Thoth Hermes whirling through space organizing matter. I remember once saying that the Quantum Realm is observer dependend, and Morph corrected me in that it is observer attended, best I heard.

4. The new theory encompasses the Macro and -Microcosm, most prominent in String Theory, a particle as a string of vibrating energy and that matter is a Symphony of vibration. I saw that once of a human body. String Theory predicts more than one dimension. I remember reading years ago that more than one dimension was said to exist by some researchers in the 1930s, but has been known long time ago.

5. Max Planck:&quot;All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Mind.&quot;I could cite Islam here,&quot;If Allah would blink the Universe would collapse.&quot;

6. Consciousness is individual. This we express as&quot;in my Universe&quot;or&quot;on my planet&quot;things are this way, but we also partake of a collective consciousness as in the Sun rises every morning. However, this is not so, rather the place where one is on Earth tilts toward the Sun which never &apos;sets&quot;.

7. The field called Akashic Records contains everything that has ever happened, that this field might be the same as Uncle Carl&apos;s Collective Unconscious. Gurdjieff agrees, and here belongs our suffering from amnesia.

8. In the evening of his life, Einstein said that anyone seriously involved in science will have to admit that Spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe, a Spirit vastly superior to that of man. And,&quot;Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.&quot;Madam Blavatsky wrote that over a century ago, it was known by the Egyptians, Arabian Alchemists, the Greeks, and what ancient Civilization have you.

9. I forgot whom Mr. Peniac quotes,&quot;The subtle energies underlaying the universe were be before particles of matter appeared and will be after these particles disappear.&quot;In my universe, this waht is called subtle energy is Light, the Fiat of Creation, which endows particles with mass. God is pre-eternal, the Orthodox Church teaches.

With all due respect, this is as far as I followed upon second listening, as all this may be news to mainstream science, but not to the acute Philosophers of yesteryear, and the Divine Poet, in whose Works I can find Eternal Verities.

I had to reach for&quot;The Reflexive Universe&quot;by Arthur M. Young, truly&quot;the all-encompassing cosmological vision&quot;, Stanislav Grof termed it, and&quot;a work (that has) successfully established a foundation where western technology and eastern philosphy meet.&quot;Tarthang Tulku Rinpoche

The Introduction to this book was written by Jacob Needleman who was the Mentor of my Phi-Teacher. Mr. Young, almost laughing out loud, told us once that he sat for years under the Bhodi Tree, and one day He made the prayer to be given the Secrets of the Universe and was granted his wish. I mentioned this before elsewhere and a Reader replied that Mr. Young sounded mighty self-important, when in fact He was just the opposite. This drugery of judgery.

I will repeat parts of&quot;Light as purposive&quot;, and&quot;More on light&quot;by the learned Gentleman, and it is fitting that my first quote should be:&quot;As we have noted, purpose is barred from science. As Bacon said:&quot;Purpose like a virgin concecrated to God is (for science) barren&quot;.

Prescientific concepts of light

&quot;I would like to in this chapter to go back to some of the opinions on light that were held long before the emergence of modern science. This is to the period around A.D. 350, when philosophers were endeavoring to rationalize the account of creation in Genesis, and before the dogma of the church had set in and discouraged speculation.

&quot;According to I. P. Sheldon Williams, St. Basil of Caesarea, writing in about A.D. 370, distinguished between the intelligible and the sensible world. The intelligible world was outside time. The sensible world shared with it&quot;an intelligible matter which Basil identifies with the light which illuminates the material world and is therefore the common ground of the whole universe intelligible and sensible.&quot;

 &quot;It follows [sais St. Basil] that light is of a more general nature than time, for time is found only in the sensible world....Because light is not limited to time it was universally distributed at the moment of its creation, as it fills the whole room in which a lamp is kindled. Between the intelligible and the sensible worlds the firmament acts as a barrier, of which the solidity implied by its name is such that light may pass through it (but in a deluted form), but time cannot break out into the world above.&quot; 

Saint Basil the Great is a Father of Orthodoxy, who together with Gregoryn the Bishop of Nazianzus - Constantinople, wrote the outstanding work, The Philokalia, meaning&quot;Love of the Beautiful&quot;.

All this is Beautiful, and have a Beautiful Day!

Charlotte you are correct I have no right to stop your conversations with ren. I would never really close down this board as it is who I am and have been since I (we) opened it.

I am just going through a non-enlightened phase at the moment and it is quite annoying. So ren shelve the so long ... farewell and come back and keep Charlotte company it is I, I think who should leave.

Charlotte maybe I should just give you the administrators password and let you take over.

To both of you I am sorry but this board is no longer who I am and what we started as. Charlotte you mention a lot of things such as alchemy and such but always you go to Christ. I can not go there with you. You and ren have free rein I will butt out.

Good Morning Don,

My thoughts after reading thy post last evening were, once again, how easily and openly you can acknowledge a mishap, personal or in thy works, which I prized all along our Friendship of many years, Don! .... since I (we) have opened this board it became permanent and never wavered despite differences. You cannot leave this board, it is our Home.

The reason I mention many things is because All are facets of this Diamond we are seeking even though our sojourn here on Earth may take different paths.&quot;No one gets by the Cross&quot;, my Mother repeated during the years, and but a few weeks ago She stunned me with her Wisdom. It is wise to listen to our Elders, for they know enough of it to know all of it.

Man&apos;s happiness, his flaunting honey&apos;d flower of the soul,
in his loving response to the wealth of Nature.
Beauty is the prime motive of all his excellence,
his aim and peaceful purpose; whereby he himself
becoming a creator hath often a thought to ask
why Nature, being so inexhaustible of beauty,
should not be all-beauteous; why from infinit resource,
produce more ugliness than human artistry
which any spiritual intention can allow?

Man&apos;s Reason is in such deep insolvency to sense,
that though she guides his higher flight heav&apos;nward, and teach him
dignity morals manners and human comfort,
she can delicatly and dangerously bedizen
the rioting joys that fringe the sad pathways to Hell.
Nor without allience of the animal senses,
hath she any miracle: Lov&apos;st thou in the blithe hour
of April dawnsnay marvelest thou not to hear
the ravishing music that the small birds make
in garden or woodland, rapturously heralding
the break of day; when the first lark on high hath warn&apos;d
the vigilant robin already of the sun&apos;s approach,
and he on slender pipe called the nesting tribes
to awake and fill and thrill their myriad-warbling throats
praising life&apos;s God, until the blisful revel grow
in wild profusion unfeign&apos;d to such a hymn as man
hath never in temple or grove pour&apos;d to the Lord of heav&apos;n?

Hast thou then thought that all this ravishing music,
that stirred so thy heart, making thee dream of things
illimitable unsearchable and of heavenly import,
is but a light disturbance of the atom of air,
whose jostling ripples, gather&apos;d within the ear, are tuned
to resonant scale, and thence by the enthron&apos;d mind received
on the spiral staircase of her audience chamber
as heralds of high spiritual significance?

With Love from The Divine Poet

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Sept 28, 2009, 10:44am

Reading this morning on dreams that come in the beginning of the path of Theosis, and I hope throughout, assured me that mine are just so, as I hade suspected and interpreted.

Evening last I thought about the&quot;Wisdom&quot;I spoke of yesterday with regards to my Mother, Bless Her, and the Priest turning to the congregation, bringing the Stole to His forehead saying&quot;Wisdom!&quot;Other times&quot;Wisdom, let us be attentive, peace be to all!&quot;, meaning to listen to the wisdom of the Holy Gospel. This Wisdom is as a little Star in the Universe. Due to a Reading to the Corinthians by the Apostle Paul, in Church yesterday, I recollected Steven&apos;s words, pardon me, of the Wisdom of the overarching Intelligence that guides the Universe. The reading:

&quot;Brethren, for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written:&quot;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the the understanding of the prudent.&quot;Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has God not made follish the wisdom of this world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleases God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe. For Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&quot;

Much of one&apos;s own references have to be filled in to understand these words in relation to this overarching Intelligence, not simple read at face value, for it cannot be disputed that through all our wisdom, even our collective wisdom, we and the world does not know God. I doubt not that there are The Few who do know God, but this Knowing did not come from the Wisdom of this world.

The Orthodox Church celebrated the&quot;Feast of the Exaltation of The Life-Giving Cross.&quot;The Vestments were red and white and the Cross on a red-draped stand to be venerated. The Feast&quot;commemorates the finding of the true cross on Meskerem 17 of the Ethiopian Calendar corresponding to September 27 in the Julian Calendar (or, in leap years, one day later. The eve of this day is popularly called&quot;Demera&quot;in Amharic - meaning Bonfire. - Thousands attend a colourful and vibrant ceremony of religious chanting around the bonfire ( many little bonfires are also lit) in Maskal Square (at Addis Ababa) which owes its name to the ceremony&quot;maskal&quot;meaning Ge&apos;ez&quot;cross&quot;. According to tradition, the bonfire commemorates how Queen Helena, as legend has it, found with the smoke of a bonfire, where to search for the true cross in Jerusalem, or how, by a series of bonfires, she signaled to her son Constantine in Constantinople her success in finding it.&quot;

I also found the right defenition for&quot;Kontakion&quot;, Greek&quot;from the pole&quot;, a type of hymn so long it had to be hung from a pole, meaning it was wound round a pole like a scroll. Not so&quot;loud&quot;it had to be hung on a scroll, sorry, no wonder it didn&apos;t make sense.

Icon&apos;s are everywhere on Orthodox sites, I look at many and found that St. Luke the Apostle painted the first of the Holy Theotokos,&quot;Birthgiver of God&quot;. One called&quot;Umilenie&quot;, meaning&quot;Lady of Tenderness&quot;, another&quot;Hodigitria&quot;, meaning&quot;She who leads the Way&quot;.

In contemplating a large painting of a King&apos;s Coronation Ceremony at the entrance to St. Steven Cathedral, I noticed one of the attending guards held a Viking Helmet in his hand.

More Light. I wrote this before, but it&apos;s Sunday.

Sir Francis Bacon:

&quot;The sun enters the palace and the privy alike and is not poluted thereby. We raise not a Capitol or Pyramid to the pride of man, but a Holy Temple in his mind on the model of the Universe, which model we imitate. For whatever deserves to exist deserves to be known, and knowledge is the image of Existence. Now the mean and the splendid alike exist....&quot;

New Atlantis

&quot;But thus you see we maintain a trade, not for gold, silver, or jewels, nor for silks, nor for spices, nor any other commodity of matter; but for God&apos;s first creature, which was light: to have light, I say, of the growth of all parts of the world.&quot;

Arthur Middleton Young, St. Basil the Great, St. Gregory the Theologen, St. John Chrisostom, the three Saints being the&quot;Three Holy Hierarchs&quot;of Orthodox Religion; and revealed Religion.

Mr. Young, 1905-1995, graduated in mathematics from Princeton University in 1927, designed the Bell Helicopter and building it took Him on a journey from physics to metaphysics. After&quot;first untangling all the scientific stuff&quot;, Mr. Young became a Philosopher. Perhaps I should clarify my statement of Mr. Young almost &apos;laughing out loud&apos; when He told us that His prayer to know the Secrets of the Universe was answered, by which I meant Mr. Young tempered this spontaneous and joyful laughter great Teachers are given to when lecturing.

There is no new thing under the Sun....

&quot;Perhaps the reader will think,&quot;Well physics is already the revealed religion of the present timeyou are just creating a new sect.&quot;But it is quiet to the contrary: I am attempting to show that the hard-won truths of physics, those that have forced the most radical departures, are equivalent to what the best earliest thinkers discovered in revealed religion.

&quot;So much, then, for the overall picture. We have dealt in the last two chapters with the many-faceted problem of light, all aspects of which point one way: to the ultimate centrality of primacy of light as the origin of everything. And by everything I mean not only matter, which light creates by its condensation from photons and which is changed by the interaction of photons with atoms and molecules, but also what St. Basil called the intelligible world, the eternal now of consciousness.&quot;

The eternal now of Consciousness we aspire to in all we do.

&quot;Perhaps it will be discovered that tachyons, those supposed entities which travel faster than light, may comprise the intelligible world. I will be content if I can carry the reader to the border of this kingdom in which, paradoxically, he already resides.&quot;

The kingdom in which we paradoxically already reside, the intelligible world&quot;outside of time&quot;- the sensible world&quot;in time&quot;being illuminated by the&quot;uncreated light&quot;of the Saints. We are already.... but suffer from amnesia.

&quot;Let me go back to St. Basil. Here we have a Greek philosopher who makes far more profound and correct statements than did the philosophers who lived at the hight of Greek civilization. Compare St. Basil with Aristotle. Impressive as was Aristotle&apos;s encyclopedic mind, he said nothing that would anticipate the revolutionary discoveries of modern science that were to reverse reason. Aristotle did not say that time does not exist in the world of light, nor could reason reach such a strange idea. How did St. Basil reach it? By reasoning about revealed scripture. This brings out the function of revealed religion: it supplies what reason per se cannot. We could not reason that light was the first thing to come into existence. Reason begins at the other end, with objects, and proceeds to divide the object much as did Democritus with his atoms. Reason has to start with something; it cannot admit first cause. Try it on yourself; you will always find yourself asking what was the cause of the first cause. (Hallo my friend Don 

&quot;Genesis tells us that first cause is fiat: Let there be light! What is&quot;fiat&quot;? It is action (decision). So when Planck discovers that light is a quantum of action, he is discovering&quot;fiat,&quot;the same fiat described in Genesis, the light that was created on the first day. But, you say, God is the cause behind the first cause. The question of whether God (action) is different from light (action) is a mystery that I cannot resolve. I suspect misplaced concreteness.

&quot;We could also say that there is no reason for light not to have an antecedent. For light to be first cause means only that its antecedents do not imply the result.&quot;

God is pre-eternal and cannot be known, it echoes from the ages of ages to the ages of ages. Only &apos;Reason&apos; needs an answer, beginning with &apos;some thing&apos;.

&quot;I&apos;m not implying that revealed religion is necessarely correct. As St. Gregory, a contemporary of St. Basil and an equally pios philosopher, said (as paraphrased by Sheldon Williams):

&quot;The Language of Scripture does not reveal the truth directly but a half concealed version of it. This is because the sensible world from which it draws its illustrations is an imperfect copy of the intelligible.&quot;

So it is, and is why it is repeated in every Divine Liturgy that&quot;we will not speak&quot;of the Mysteries of God, as they have to be seen by the Eye of the Heart of each Individual, and can only be communicated like a dream experience, imperfect.

&quot;One would think St. Gregory had been reading Eddington, who says:&quot;The physicist draws up an elaborate plan of the atom and proceeds critically to erase each detail in turn. What is left is the atom of modern physics.

&quot;We have given some account of Planck&apos;s discovery of the quantum of action, or photon, as the ultimate unit of light, and have indicated the connection of action with purpose. We have noted that purpose, inasmuch as it is decision, comes in wholes, and that there is a necessary connection, in that when wholeness is divided, purpose or function ceases. We conclude that light is the unitary purposive principle which engenders the universe, and that it has the nature of first cause. We may therefore appreciate that light is not&quot;just another particle&quot;, nor is it describable as most things are in terms of something else. It is the base element. (We don&apos;t see the light, we see by the light.)

1. Action comes in irreducible quanta or units.
2. These are units of constant, i.e., invariant, size.
3. They are counted, not measured.
4. Because indeterminate, they constitude the end point in the chain of causation and are therefore first cause.&quot;

&quot;Know ye then the beginning, for it is the same as the end&quot;

A friend of mine asked me about the swine flu. Here was my reply to her:

All of this about the swine flu and everything else that is going to be happening between now and the end of the world is part of how Armageddon will play out collectively on the world stage.

The only way we, as individuals, will be able to respond appropriately to the many threats we will be faced with, is to be engaged in the process of preparing ourselves to go through transition consciously, without losing the thread of awareness. What this means, in particular, is to begin to make contact with and begin to live in, as far as possible, the other-worldly reality we hope to inhabit when we leave this world.

At the same time while our bodies are here on earth, our souls make contact with and become channels for, many different other-worldly realities to come into being here on earth. We can learn to make contact with and manifest, the highest Heaven or the lowest depths of hell. That is the nature of life on earth, and it&apos;s great virtue. While here on earth, we have the potential to manifest any and every range of consciousness available to us, from the highest to the lowest, (Often, in the same day!) Within the limits of time/space and the laws of physics, which act as buffers to our creations and, above all, give us the opportunity to CHANGE OUR MINDS, and thus, our environment.

In the next world, we will not have that luxury of being able to change so readily. Whatever we have become familiar with and established in here, will be the quality of world we transition to when we leave here.

And so, it behooves us to use what little time we have here in this limited framework wisely, to make contact with and begin to live from the other-worldly reality we hope to inhabit when we leave here.

This is the true meaning of prayer and a genuine spiritual practice, as a means of accomplishing this one thing needful.

To be prepared to go through transition at any moment is, paradoxically, the best way to live life to the fullest while we are still here in this world.

Long before I was a Christian, it was Sri Aurobindo who inspired me with his vision of&quot;The Life Divine&quot;which describes the Divinization of matter by making contact with and bringing down into physical manifestation the highest planes of consciousness.

 http://sriaurobindoashram.info/Contents.....ivine_Volume-18 

I became an Ortrhodox Christian, later, as, to my mind, the most effective means of accomplishing what Sri Arobindo had been able to communicate to me, earlier in my life. Re: The Secret of the Universe

&quot;.... to be engaged in the process of preparing to go through transition consciously, without losing the thread of awareness.&quot;

Somebody:&quot;Do you remember your past lives?&quot;

Me:&quot;No, but this time around I&apos;ll try to not to lose connection when I die.&quot;

This was many years ago, when I was unaware of a process, hence not engaged. I thought it was merely something one could do at the moment of transition.

If I think about it, I practice this before I fall asleep, viz., grasp the exact second when I fall asleep, thus far unsuccessful, but now keep trying with heighten&apos;d awareness. I think it was Pythagors who suggested that before falling asleep one should go through details of the day, counter-clock-wise like my Bavarian Clock. A Kuckuck Clock would not be suitable as every time the bird kuckucks the sound cuts time, or creates a void which would have to be overcome in going backwards through the events of the day, an extra effort. Silly thoughts in a German head, forgive me please.

&quot;I changed my mind&quot;is said a 1001 times a day without realizing the enormous undercurrents of the words.


Sri Aurobindu

&quot;Threefold are those supreme births of this divine force that is in this world, they are true, they are desirable; he moves there wide-overt within the Infinate and shines pure, luminous and fulfilling.... That which is immortal in mortals and possessed of the truth, is a god and established inwardly as an energy working out in our divine powers.... Become high-uplifted, O Strenght, pierce all vails, manifest in us the things of the Godhead.&quot;

The god established inwardly as an energy working out in our divine powers is the Holy Spirit of the Holy Trinity, which strives with us, of the Orthodox Church. Our Divine powers being thought, hearing, seeing, speach, silence, discernment, naming, apprehenshion and comprehension.

&quot;The earliest preoccupation of man in his awakened thoughts and, as it sees, his inevitable and ultimate preoccupation,for it survives the longest periods of scepticism and returns after every banishment,is also the highest which his thought can envisage. It manifests itself in the divination of the Godhead, the impulse towards perfection, in search after pure Thuth and unmixed Bliss, the sense of a secret immortality. The ancient dawns of human knowledge have left us their witness to this constant aspiration; today we see a humanity satiated but not satisfied by victorious analysis of the externalities of Nature preparing to return to its primeval longings. The earliest formula of Wisdom promises to be its last,God, Light, Freedom, Immortality.&quot;

&apos;Tis Balsam on the Heart. Again, we have the end and beginning the same, and we&apos;re on our way Home.

Three Holy Hierarchs

Mr. Arthur Young held St. Basil, St. Gregory, and the best earliest Thinkers in revealed Religion in high esteem.

The &apos;Three Holy Hierarchs&apos; are St. Basil, St. Gregory, and Saint John Chrysostom, venerated as Ecumenical Teachers by Orthodoxy, and Doctors of the Church by Roman Catholicism.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Holy_Hierarchs 

St. Basil the Great was born ca 330 in&quot;Caecarea Mazaka in Cappadocia (now known as Kayseri, Turkey).&quot;, to the wealthy family of Basil the Elder, a famous rethor. The Saints parents were known for their piety, His maternal grandfather a Christian Martyr.

&quot;Shortly after Basil&apos;s birth, the family moved to the estate of his grandmother Macrina, in the region of Pontus. There, Basil was educated in the home by his father and grandmother. He was greatly influenced by the elder Macrina, who herself was a student of Gregory Thaumaturgus&quot;, or Gregory the Wonderworker.

About 350, St. Basil returned to Caesarea, His Birthplace, and began His formal Education. There He met Gregory the Theologian and they became lifetime Friends. Returning from Athens ca 355, He briefly practiced law and taught rhetoric, but after meeting Eustathius of Sebaste, the Saint&quot;abandoned his legal and teaching profession in order to devote his life to God. Descibing his spiritual awakening in a letter, Basil said:

 I had wasted much time on follies and spent nearly of of my youth in vain labor, and devotion to the teachings of a wisdom that God had made foolish. Suddenly, I awoke as out of a deep sleep. I beheld the wonderful light of the Gospel truth, and I recognize the nothingness of the wisdom of the princes of this world. 

St. Basil was&quot;of rich and observant nature, tender and an even playful Preacher&quot;, addressing&quot;young men on study the study of classical literature important as prepatory instructions. His principle theological writings are Treatise on the Holy Spirit, a lucid and edifying appeal to Scripture and early Christian tradition to prove the divinity of the Holy Spirit.&quot;

St. John Chrysostom

Archbishop of Constinople, was born ca 347, known for his eloquence in preaching and public speaking, his denunciation of abuse of authority by both ecclesiastical and political leaders, the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, and his ascetic sensibilities. After death (or according to some sources, during his life) he was given the Greek surname chrysostomos, meaning&quot;golden mouthed&quot;, rendered in English as Chrysostom.&quot;

St. John was ordained a Deacon in 381, and as a Priest in 386.&quot;He emphasised charitable giving and was concerned with the spiritual and temporal needs of the poor. He also spoke out against abuse of wealth and personal property:

 Do you wish to honour the body of Christ? Do not ignore him when he is naked. Do not pay him homage in the temple clad in silk, only then to neglect him outside where he is cold and ill-clad. He who said:&quot;This is my body&quot;is the same who said:&quot;You saw me hungry and you gave me no food&quot;, and&quot;Whatever you did to the least of my brothers you did also to me&quot;... What good is it if the Eucaristic table is overloaded with golden chalices when your brother is dying of hunger? Start by satisfying his hunger and then with what is left you may adorn the altar as well. 

&quot;Even if we have thousands of acts of great virtue to our credit, our confidence in being heard must be based on God&apos;s mercy and His love for men. Even if we stand at the very summit of virtue, it is by mercy that we shall be saved.

&quot;Why do you beat the air and run in vain? Every occupation has a purpose, obviously. Tell methen, what is the purpose of all the activity of the world? Answer, I challenge you! It is vanity of vanity: all is vanity.&quot;

Says Mr. Hall:&quot;You don&apos;t take with you what you have but what you are, and you are more than you can ever have.&quot;

Post by charlotte on Oct 2, 2009, 12:18pm

Thank you for the heads up. I will check the Diocesan website. I also received my copy of&quot;This Rough Magic&quot;.

Reading again this morning, what is really astounding concerning Orthodoxy the systematic scientific inquiry of God and the Holy Trinity, and commentary given thereon.

The science of Dogma

&quot;The first principle - is the &quot;what is&quot; (i.e., the essence or nature) of God cannot be known, it cannot be conceived or comprehended by the mind. This was naturally accepted by Neo-Platonism to an extent, but, it was the basic principle of Hellenic Philosophy, of Hellenic thought, that one can come to know the essence of beings, that it can be accomplished with the mind, which, having conceived the idea, is led to the essence of beings.

&quot;The Father - non-birth, the Son - birth, the Holy Spirit - procedure from.

&quot;We cannot find God&apos;s essence inside creation. We can however find God&apos;s energy in creation.

&quot;The son is neither the name of an essence, nor of an energy; He is the name of a relationship.

&quot;The Holy Spirit is a spirit of freedom, and does not force man. Besides, the event of Christ, the very nature of Christophany, is such that it fully respects a person&apos;s freedom.... the concept of FREEDOM within the existence of the Holy Trinity.&quot;

Saint Gregory the Theologian of The Holy Hierarchs

St. Gregory was born in 329 in Arianzus, a village of the second district of Cappadocia, not far from Nazianus. His father, who later became Bishop of Nazianus, was named Gregory, and his mother was named Nonna; both are among the saints, and so are his brother Caesarius and his sister Gorgonia.&quot;

St. Gregory studied in Caesarea of Palestine, then Alexandria, and finally Athens. After his studies at Athens, Gregory became Basil&apos;s fellow ascetic, living the monastic life life together with him for a time in the hermitages of Pontus. His father ordained him presbyter (Priest) of the church of Nazianus, and St. Basil consecrated him Bishop of Sasima (or Zansima), which was the archdiocese of Caesarea. This concecration was a source of great sorrow to Gregory, and a cause of misunderstanding between him and Basil; but his love for Basil remained unchanged.

His extant writings, both prose and poems in every type of metre, demonstate his lofty eloquence and his wondrous breadth of learning. In the beauty of his writings, he is considered to have surpassed the Greek writers of antiquity, and because of his God-inspired theological thought, he received the surname&quot;Theologian. - He is especially called&quot;Trinitarian Theologian,&quot;since in virtually every homily he refers to the Trinity and the one essence and nature of the Godhead. Hence, Alexius Anthorus dedicated the following verse(es) to him:

Like an unwandering star beaming with splendour,
Thou bringest us by mystic teachings, O Father,
To the Trinity&apos;s sunlike illumination,
O mouth breathing with fire, Gregory most mighty.&quot;

St. John Chrysostom, of whom I wrote a few words yesterday, represents in some ways&quot;a sort of synthesis between the hermeneutic of the more allegorical Alexandrian School and the more literal Antiochian School.&quot;

Hermeneutics

From OrthodoxWiki

 &quot;Hermeneutics (from Greek hermeneuticos) is the interpretation of a text, particularely the text of Holy Scripture. The word literally means&quot;interpretation&quot;(in its basic sense, interpreting a foreign language into one familiar to the listener) but can also refer to&quot;explanation.&quot;It is this latter sense which is meant when referring to Biblical hermenautics. In the Orthodox Christian Church, the practice of hermeneutics is according to basic principles (presuppositions) which are manifest in the life of the Church. Following is a summary of those principles, expressed in ten parts:

1. God is real and is incarnated in our Lord Jesus Christ. Everything pertaining to the Scriptures must be understood Christologically. Jesus Christ, the incarnate Second Person of the Holy Trinity, is the center of all that we Christians do, and being Himself the very Truth, He is the only gate through which we may enter into understanding of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments (though not all that is contained in the Old Testament is directly relevant for Christians). The Bible ultimately is about Christ and assists us in our union with Him.&quot;

As I am discovering by the by, it is an&quot;understanding&quot;of the Bible, of which I had some, and most importantly of The Holy Trinity, Essence, The Word, Energy, and Breath/Spirit, consubstantial, which takes a while, and of which I have a glimpse.

To be continued....

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Oct 3, 2009, 10:20am

Indeed, it would be favorable if his Grace Bishop Maxim would be there. Best if He would teach the classes.

Hermeneutics continued

From OrthodoxWiki

2. Only the pure at heart&quot;shall see God.&quot; That is, our spiritual state has a direct bearing on our interpretation of the Scriptures. As St. Athanasius said,&quot;One cannot possibly understand the teachings of the saints unless one has a pure mind and it trying to imitate their life.&quot;Because the Scripture is a book inspired by the Holy Spirit and given through holy men, one&apos;s own holiness is directly relevant to the ability to interpret the book correctly. Unlike any other book, the Bible&apos;s words are&quot;spirit and life,&quot;and so we must live spiritually in order to drink from the spiritual well. Clearly, prayer and spiritual disciplines are necessary in order to understand Scripture properly.

3. Understanding of the Scripture comes with living its contents. As the quote from Athanasius illustrates, one must both have a pure mind and be trying to imitate the saints lives in order to understand their teachings, a dual principle which applies most of all to the teachings of the saints in the Bible. This life is particularly expressed in terms of living out the commandments and attempting to imitate Christ&apos;s live of the Gospel.&quot;

Living out the Commandments,&quot;Thou shalt not steal&quot;etc.,&quot;Honor thy Father and Mother&quot;, is easy, really. Imitating Christ&apos;s life not so.

4. The primary end of Scripture hermeneutics is that of the whole Christian life, theosis (deification/divinization). That is, our purpose in attempting to understand the Bible must not be merely for academic inquiry but rather must be in order to become fully divinized human beings, soaked with the life of God, participating in His divine energies, growing to the fullness of the stature of Christ. We interpret Scripture in order to become by grace what Christ is by nature, to&quot;become god.&quot;

5. Only within the community of the Church can the Bible be understood. It was written by the Church and for the Church. Thus, it is a&quot;family document&quot;which is the highest point of Holy Tradition, taken with faith alongside the writings of the Fathers, the Liturgy, the Icons, the Lives of the Saints, and so on.

6. The Scripture is a witness to the truth, not an exhaustive tome to Christian living. nowhere in the word of Scripture itself can we find the teaching that is all-sufficient for Christian life. What we as Orthodox Christians do must always be consonant with the Scripture, but explicit mention of a practice or teaching in the Scripture is not required for its inclusion in the life of the Church. The Apostle Paul himself mentiones the reality of unwritten sources of Church tradition being equal in force for the believer in II Thessalonians 2:15, that these traditions to which we must&quot;stand fast and hold&quot;may be&quot;by word or by our epistle.&quot;Examples of practices not explicit in Scripture are making the sign of the Cross, triple immersion for baptism, and having monasticism. St. Basil the Great even says that without maintaining the unwritten tradition of the Church, we&quot;mutilate the Gospel&quot;.

7. We must respect the integrity of the canon of the Bible as given to us in the Church&apos;s Tradition. Searches for other texts written by apostoles or prophets may be interesting and of scholarly merit, but they are not part of the hermeneutical project within the Church. Or conversely, attempts to debunk the authorship or authenticity of the books in the canon are also outside the Church&apos;s life. If we were to find a verifiable&quot;new&quot;work by St. Paul or to discover that Moses did not in fact write Genesis, neither finding would have any bearing on the canon. It is what it is.

Neither finding, nor, as far as I can see, anything else, would have any bearing on the canon. The Orthodox Church stands firm on its History.

8 We must use every resource at our disposal in interpreting the Scipture to bring ourselves and others to the knowledge of the truth. Certainly, there must be spiritual discernment in knowing how to use these resources, but at least theoretically, anything can be used to come to know the truth better than it is revealed in Holy Writ.

9. We must have humility when approaching Scripture. Even some of the Church&apos;s greatest and most philosophically sophisticated saints stated that some passages were difficult for them. We must therefore be prepared to admit that our interpretations may be wrong, submitting them to the judgment of the Church.

10. We may make use in a secondary fashion of the resources of academic scholarship, whether logic, archaeology, linguistics, et cetera. These resources can be helpful in terms of illuminating our understanding of Scripture, but they must always be given only secondary prominence in the project and always only in conjunction with all these other hermeneutic principles. Primary must always be our life in the Church, living, studying and knowing the Bible within that vivified and salvific Holy Tradition.

With each subsequent visit, it seems that either the Church or I become more real. I felt it particularely today, sometimes a few moment, other times a few minutes. Ever I am moved by the singing of the Glory, Love, and Blessings of God by 4-5 young girls lead by a Lady with a beautiful voice. It was very nice.

Father Ceko simply does it all, presiding over the Matins, Holy Liturgy, turning and giving cue&apos;s to the singers, and everyone else who needs to know what to do. His vestment today was soft white and the Cross&apos; on the Robe ornamented with vines and grapes and bearded wheat, in Royal Blue.

Celebrated was the Leave-taking of the Feast of the Elevation of the Cross, as well as the initiation of a new Warrier in Christ, who was little Svetlana being baptised and brought to the fore several times during the Holy Liturgy.

&quot;By rising from the tomb You did raise the dead Adam. Eve exults in Your Resurrection, and the world celebrates Your Rising from the dead. O greatly Merciful One.&quot;

Often is the Holy Theotokos praised:

&quot;Magnify, O my soul, the most precious Cross of the Lord.
You are the mystical Paradise, O Theotokos, in which Christ blossomed; through Him the life-bearing Wood of the Cross was planted on earth. Now, at its Exaltation, as we bow in worship before it, we Magnify You!&quot;

Noting the language in both verses, quite unusual. I also like the oft repeated

O Lord, save Your people and bless Your inheritence!


Had a close call this morning while driving, namely, I looked for a split second to pick up my slice of bread from the passenger seat, (neatly on a white serviette, don&apos;t want you to think I have bread laying around there , and saw out of the corner of my eye an SUV just enough ahead of my car so as not to see it, and about a hair&apos;s width from it, steadily bearing me to the left while keeping pace with me, so both of us kept veering toward the center lane, which, thank God was the suicide lane, instead of oncoming traffic. I sped up................to get ahead and away, it worked.

The SUV was beside me now, three feet over, and I finally had time to look at the Lady driver with an&quot;Oh my God!&quot;expression on her face, her hand raised in an apologetic gesture, I touched my Heart as in heart attack and smiled all&apos;s well that ends well, and both of us felt much better. Double Phew! Many times a driver, men and women, even if they&apos;re wrong will shake their fist or worse and shout obscenities, but that&apos;s LA for you.

There&apos;s more. The flashing sign on the freeway showed my off ramp closed. Not a good day start and good thing I was early, and thought of an alternative route, but lo, as I was nearing the off ramp, it was only closed in the southerly direction. Twice YES! Trice Love to my Guardian Angel!

My feeble attempt to entertain some, hope everyone had a great day.

&quot;Esteem that to be eminently good, which, when communicated to another, will be increased to yourself&quot;

Pythagoric Utterance of Demophilus

Yesterday also, Father Ceko noted the Human Body as the Temple of God. A quote I read this morning, though it is meant in the greater, reflects how I feel when in the Cathedral of St. Steven&apos;s, lighted by one huge and two smaller Chandeliers (in German all things one can see begin with capitals), oil lamps and candles, a soft light of short duration permiates the Church at times.

&quot;The Church is shown to be a many lighted heaven that doth shine a guiding light upon all them that believe.&quot;

As stated before, I was delighted to find Dionysius the Areopagite, esteemed by my Phi-Teacher, in the Orthodox Teachings.

Dionysius, a convert of St. Paul, was a member of the famous judicial court of Mars Hill, in Greek&quot;Areos Pagus&quot;, hence His name. He was influenced by Plotinus, the Cappadocian Fathers, St. Basil, St. Gregory, Origin and Clement of Alexandria, hence said that He was not an inovator, but a Communicator of Tradition. On October 3, The Areopagite is commemorated by the Church.

The Light of Dionysius
Every sentence a Treasure

That every divine illumination, while going forth
with love in various ways to the objects of its
forethought, remains one. Nor is this all: it also
unifies the things illuminated.

Moreover, every divine procession of radiance
from the Father, while constantly bounteously
flowing to us, fills us anew as though with a
unifying power, by recalling us to things above,
and leading us to the unity of the Shepherding
Father and to the Divine One. For from Him and
into Him are all things, as it is written in the holy
Word.

Calling then upon Jesus, the Light of the Father,
the Real and True, &apos;Which lights every man that
comes into the world, by whom we have access to
the Father,&apos; the Origin of Light, let us raise our
thought, according to our power, to the
illumination of the most sacred doctrines handed
down by the Fathers, and also as far as we may let
us contemplate the Hierarchies of the Celestial
Intelligences revealed to us by them in symbols
for our upliftment: and admitting to through the
spiritual and unwavering eyes of the mind the
original and super-original gift of Light of the
Father who is the source of Divinity, which
shows to us images of the all-blessed Hierarchies
of the Angels in figurative symbols, let us through
them again strive upward toward its primal ray.
For this Light can never be deprived
of its own intrinsic unity, and although in
goodness It becomes manyness and proceeds into
manifestation for the uplifting of those creatures
governed by Its providence, het It abides eternally
within Itself in changeless sameness, firmly
established in Its own unity, and elevates to Itself,
according to their capacity, those who turn
towards it. uniting them in accordance with Its
own unity. For by the first divine ray we can be
enlighted only insofar as It is hidden by all-
various holy veils for our upliftment, and fittingly
tempered to our natures by the Providence of the
Father.

So exact speaks Dionysius that one cannot help but understand that according to our power of thought It elevates Itself to our capacity of understanding, proportionally, which He constantly stresses.

So did Fern,&quot;There is an orderly unfolding of the Mysteries, you cannot understand University papers when in High School.&quot;

We are clairvoyant. Prayer is a telepathic form of communication with God. God wants to share His consciousness and His energies with us to the degree that we want to draw near and partake of God&apos;s consciousness and energies, all the way up to complete union with God.

We are INTENDED to be partaker&apos;s of the Divine nature. That is who we are, what we are meant to be.

Nothing is hindering us other than a habit of focusing our ATTENTION in other places and on other things rather than on God.

&quot;The secret of all this is one&apos;s attention. All of this exists only because of our attention. This very rock where we&apos;re sitting is a rock because we have been forced to give our attention to it as a rock.&quot;
Tales of Power

Prayer is a matter of re-directing our ATTENTION towards God, rather than the ten-thousand other things we usually put our ATTENTION on.

Whoever can focus on the ONE has all. Whoever has their ATTENTION on the many other, loses the one.

Church is designed to help us learn to focus our ATTENTION on the one thing needful.

I had a good experience of this yesterday.

This is what sets Orthodox Christianity apart. It&apos;s not a philosophy or a set of rules to follow. It is an environment who&apos;s elements are Intended to foster our personal, telepathic relationship with the living God.

For those who have ears, let them hear.

Theosis, the way to restore our likeness to God

The exact exegesis of St. Dionysius the Areopagite keeps the Mind ordered, focused, and elevated on the path to the Kingdom.

Continued,

Wherefore that first institution of the sacred rites,
judging it worthy of a supermundane copy of the
Celestial Hierarchies, give us our most holy
hierarchy, and described that spiritual Hierarchy
in material terms and in various compositions of
forms so that we might be led, each according to
their capacity, from the most holy imagery to
formless, unific, elevative principles and
assimilations. For the mind can by no means be
directed to the spiritual presentation and
contemplation of the Celestial Hierarchies unless
it use the material guidance suited to it,
accounting those beauties which are seen to be
images of the hidden beauty, the sweet incense a
symbol of spiritual dispensations, and the earthly
lights a figure of the immaterial enlightenment.
Similarly the details of the sacred teaching
corresponds to the feast of contemplation in the
soul, while the ranks of order on earth reflect the
Divine Concord and the disposition of
Heavenly Orders. The receiving of the most holy
Eucharist symbolizes our participation of Jesus;
and everything else delivered in a supermundane
manner to Celestial Natures is given to us in
symbols.

To further, then, the attainment of our due
measure and deification, the loving Source of all
mysteries, in showing to us the Celestial
Hierarchies, and consecrating our hierarchy as
fellowministers, according to our capacity, in the
likeness of their divine ministry, depicted those
supercelestial Intelligences in material images in
the inspired writings of the sacred Word so that
we might be guided through the sensible to the
intelligible, and from sacred symbols to the
Primal Source of the Celestial Hierarchies.

Recalling that the&quot;intelligible world&quot;of St. Basil is outside time, but the sensible world shares with it&quot;an intelligible matter&quot;, which is the light that illuminates the material world, and this light outside time, above the Crown Ketter, is therefore the common ground of the whole universe intelligible and sensible.

The Tree of Life is such a sacred symbol in a material image with attributes of its and our nature, and depicting how light condenses into matter down to Malkuth, our world and the Footstool of God.

Have a great day!

The Celestial Hierarchy

continued, and why Celestial Intelligences are in the images of oxen, lions, and eagles.

I consider, then, that in the first place we must
explain our conception of the purpose of each
Hierarchy and the good conferred by each upon
its followers; secondly we must celebrate th
Celestial Hierarchies as they are revealed in the
Scriptures, and finally we must say under what
holy figures the descriptions in the sacred writings
portray the Celestial Orders, and to what kind
ot purity we ought to be guided through those
forms lest we, like the many, should impiously
suppose that those Celestial and Divine
Inltelligences are many-footed or many-faced
beings, or formed with the brutishness of oxen, or
the savageness of lions, or the curved beaks of
eagles, or the feathers of birds, or should imagin
that they are some kind of fiery wheels above the
heavens, or material thrones upon which the
Supreme Deity may recline, or many-coloured
horses, or commaders in arm- ies, or whatever
else of symbolic description has been given to us
in the various sacred images of the Scriptures.

Theology, in its sacred utterances concerning the
formless Intelligences, does indeed use poetic
symbolism, having regard to our intelligence, as
has been said, and providing a means of ascent
fitting and natural to it by framing the sacred
Scriptures in a manner designed for our
upliftment.

But someone may prefer to regard the Divine
Orders as pure and ineffable in their own natures,
and beyond our power of vision, and may
consider that the imagery of the Celestial
Intelligences and the Scriptures does not really
represent them, and is like a crude dramatization
of the celestial names: and he may say that the
theologians, in depicting wholly incorporeal
natures under bodily forms should, as far as
possible, make use of fitting and related images,
and represent them by the most exalted,
incorporeal and spiritual substances amonghts
ourselves, and should not endue the Celestial and
Godlike Principles with a multitude of low and
earthly forms. For the one would contribute in a
higher degree to our ascent by dissociating
incongruous images from the descriptions of
Supermundane Natures, while the other impiously
outrages the Divine Powers, and leads our minds
into error when -we dwell upon such unholy
compositions. For we might even think that the
supercelestial regions are filled with herds of lions
and horses, and re-echo with roaring songs of
praise, and contain flocks of birds and other
creatures, and the lower forms of matter, and
whatever other absurd, spurious, passion-arousing
and unlike forms the Scriptures use in describing
their resemblances.

Another good day to everyone!

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Oct 9, 2009, 11:53am

Sorry, yesterday&apos;s post on oxen, lions, and eagles, was headed:

 That Divine and Celestial matters are fittingly
revealed even through unlike symbols. 

Continued,

Neverthe less, I think that the investigation of the
truth shows the most holy wisdom of the
Scriptures in the representations of the Celestial
Intelligences which makes the most perfect
provision in each case, so that neither is dishonour
done to the Divine Powers (as they may be
called), nor are we bound more passionately to
earth by the meanness and baseness of the images.
For it might be
said that the reason for attributing shapes to that
which is above shape, and forms to that which is
beyond form, is not only the feebleness of our
intellectual power which is unable to rise at one
to spiritual contemplation, and which needs to be
encouraged by the natural and suitable support
and upliftment which offers us forms perceptible
to us of formless and supernatural contemplations,
but it is also because it is most fitting that the
secret doctrines, through ineffable and holy
enigmas, should veil and render difficult of access
for the multitude the sublime and profound truth
of the supernatural Intelligences. For as the
Scripture declares, not everyone is holy, nor have
all men knowledge.

Again, if anyone condemns these representations
as incongruous, suggesting that it is disgraceful to
fashion such base images of the divine and most
holy Orders, it is sufficient to answer that the
most holy Mysteries are set forth in two modes:
one, by means of similar and sacred
representations akin to their nature, and the other
through unlike forms designed with every
possible discordance and differance. For example,
the mystical tradition of the enlightening Word
sometimes celebrate the Sublime Blessedness of
the Superessential ONE as Word, and Wisdom,
and Essence; proclaiming the Intellect and
Wisdom of God both essentially, as the Source of
being, and also as the true Cause of existence; and
they make It equivalent to Light, and call it Life.

Now although such sacred forms are more
venerable, and seen in one sense to surpass the
material presentation, even so they fail to express
truly the Divine Likeness which verily transcends
all essence of life, and which no light can fully
represent; for an other word and wisdom is
incomparably below it. But at other times It is
extolled in a supermundane manner in the same
writings, where It is named Invisible, Infinite and
Unbounded, in such terms as
indicate not what It is, but what It is not: for this,
in my judgment, is more in accord with Its nature,
since, as the Mysteries and the priestly tradition
suggested, we are right in saying that It is not in
the likeness of any created thing, and we cannot
comprehend Its superessential, invisible and
ineffable Infinity. If, therefore, the negations in
the descriptions of the Divine are true, and the
affirmations are inconsistent with It, the
exposition of the hidden Mysteries by the use of
unlike symbols accords more closely with That
which is ineffable.


One could compare the flawless commentary of Dionysius the Areopagite with the correct definition of&quot;Philosophical Dialogue&quot;, of what a thing is and what it is not, beginning with what it is not, the time honered method of Socrates to the Gold on the bottom of the Crucible. I think of it every time I peel an onion.

Be well

Ever and beginning anew in Light of the Divine Poet

Who hath not known this picture?on a hot afternoon
of our high summer in August at the country-seat
of some vext politician, if in their flashing cars
the county-folk gather to his holyday garden,
where for their entertainment he hath outspredd the lawns
with tents and furnish&apos;d tables, flags and tennis-nets,
where haply he hav set up to dignify his grounds
a classic statue of marble, fetch&apos;d by ship from Greece,
that standeth there in true ideal nakedness
mid parasols and silks, how with blank shadow&apos;d eyes
it looked off from all those aimless idlers there
that flaunt around, now and again blurting perchance
a shamefast shallow tribute to its beauteous presence!
&apos;tis very like among common concourse of men,
who twixt care of comfort and zeal in worldly affairs
have proved serving two masters the vanity of both,
when a true soldier appeareth, one compact the heart
of sterner virtues and modest of maintenance,
mute witness and martyr of spiritual faith, a man
ready at call to render his life to keep his soul.

 As virtue is in her shape so lovely, that at sight
her lover is enamour&apos;d even of her native face.
And here I part from Aristotle, agreeing else
that a good disposition is Goddes happiest gift,
without which, as he addeth, Virtue is unteachable,
but in minds well-disposed may be by reason upbuilt:
&quot;no man cometh (said she) unto WISDOM but by me&quot;;
But when he would exalt this guiding principle
to be thatt part whereby we are in likeness with God,
whose Being (said he) lieth in the unbroken exercise
of absolute intellectwhich for their happiness
mankind should strive to attainI halt thereat: and this
marred my full accord where, in a famous text
he hath made Desire the Prime Mover of all:
because the arch-thinker&apos;s heav&apos;n cannot move my desire,
nor doth his pensive Deity make call on my love.
I see the emotion of saints, lovers and poets all
to be the kindling of some Personality
by an etemizing passion; and that God&apos;s worshipper
looking on any beauty falleth straightway in love;
and thatt love is a fine in whose devouring flames
all earthly ills are consumed, and at last flash of it,
be it only a faint radiance, the freed soul glimpseth
nay ev&apos;n may thing to hav felt, some initiate foretaste
of thatt mystic rapture, the consummation of which
is the absorbtion of Selfhood in the Being of God.


Love and Divine Poetry are wed and never the twain shall part, and can change the world.

Having risen from sleep, we worship You, blessed God, and sing to You, mighty Lord, the angelic hymn: Holy, holy, holy are You, O God, through the prayer of the Theotokos, have mercy on us.

When engaged in routine activity, no concentration required, telepathic communication with God, for me, consists of telling Him any and -everything on my Mind and in my Heart, joys, sorrows, hope&apos;s and wishes concurrently asking for Blessing and Mercy, as&quot;prayer is a great weapon, a rich treasury, a wealth that is never exhausted, an undisturbed refuge, a cause of tranquility, the root of a multitude of blessings and their source.&quot;St. John Chrysostom, one of the Three Hierarchs I recently wrote about.


During my vacation I finished reading&quot;This Rough Magic&quot;by Mary Stewart, as Steven hinted that Shakespeare&apos;s idea for&quot;The Tempest&quot;might have its origin on the Island of Corfu, home of St. Spyridon, therefore linked with the Wonder-worker, who annually in a&quot;Palm Sunday procession, which is one of the four occasions in the year when the island Saint, Spiridion, is brought out of the church where he lies the year round in a dim shrine all smoky with taperlight, and is carried through the streets in his golden palanquin. It is not the image of the Saint, but his actual mummified body which is carried in the procession, and this, somehow, makes him a very personal and homely kind of patron saint to have: the islanders believe that he has Corfu and all its people in his personal and always benevolent care, and has nothing to do but concern himself deeply in all their affairs, however trivial....&quot;

The island is west of Greece, its highest mountain in the north-east is called&quot;Mount Pantokrator&quot;, Pantokrator meaning&quot;Christ the Ruler of all&quot;. A Monastery graces the summit. From the west it trails&quot;off through rich valleys and ever decreasing hills into the long, flat scorpion&apos;s tail of the south from which some think that Corfu, or Kerkyra, gets its name. It is a beautiful Island&quot;of the most profound and enchanted peace - and if it isn&apos;t Propero&apos;s magic island it ought to be.&quot;In the book, the&quot;romantic twins Spiro and Miranda&quot;live and work there, and Spiro&apos;s officially called after the island Saintevery second boy&apos;s called Spiridion in Corfu&quot;, and Miranda avows&quot;there is nothing Spiro can&apos;t do.&quot;It is recorded that Saint Spyridon was married and had a daughter named Irene.

Apparently shipwrecked , Sir Julian has&quot;known the island on and off for thirty years&quot;, and his son is writing a film version of The Tempest.&quot; Sir Julian remarked that there was&quot;a momentary confusion with the still vex&apos;d Bermootes. - No doubt Arial had been shooting nice line in travel tales&quot;, and things became muddled. Maybe later, Francis had Ariel travel to then American Bermuda, and a huge picture presents itself again. These are but snippets.

Sir Julian:&quot;I started at the wrong end. I should have begun not with the &apos;facts,&apos; but with the playthe play&apos;s kingpin, Propero. To my mind, the conception of his character is the most remarkable thing about the play; his use of a sort of summing up of Shakespeare&apos;s essay on human power. Look at the way he&apos;s presented: a father figure, a magician in control of natural forces like the winds and the sea, a sort of benevolent and supernatural Machiavelli who controlls the island and all who are in it.&quot;

Sir Julian&quot;finished on a faint note of inquiry and looked at me with raised eyebrows, waiting for my reply&quot;, which was&quot;Saint Spiridin?&quot;. Indeed,&quot;Even the name . . . you&apos;ll notice the similarity; and its abbreviation, &apos;Spiro,&apos; makes it even closer. Saint Spiridionhis body, that is,was brought here in 1489, and in no time at all he had the reputation for all sorts of magic, miracles if you like, especially weather magic. There was another saint, a female, brought with him. Her mummy is also in a church in the town, but she didn&apos;t catch the public imagination, so she doesn&apos;t get the outings. In fact, I can&apos;t even remember her name.&quot;

Lucy Waring, with whom Sir Julian is conversing, said she never herd of the female Saint existing, to which Sir Julian replied,&quot;it&apos;s a man&apos;s country. But she may well be the origin of the &apos;idea&apos; of Miranda, the magician&apos;s daughter. She would hardly survive into legend as a female companion, or even a wife. Magicians don&apos;t have them, for reasons which I suppose it would be fascinating to explore, but which you might disagree with, Miss Lucy Waring.&quot;

Interesting also:&quot;I&apos;ve tried my hardest to see the &apos;foul witch Sycorax&apos; from &apos;Argier,&apos; as a sort of personification of the Moslem rulers who penned the heavenly powerArielin a cloven pine till the Saint-magician released him . . . But i&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t quite make that one stick.&quot;

Considering historical events of the time it just might. I found some more points of interest which I will relate tomorrow, and my inevitable editorializing.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Oct 22, 2009, 2:29pm

Saint Andrew, Fool-for-Christ (Very fitting patron Saint of our Church here)

By birth a Slav, he was bought as a slave by Theognostus, a rich man in Constaninople, in the time of the Emperor Leo the Wise, son of the Emperor Basil the Macedonian. Andrew was a handsome young man, both in body and soul. Theognostus took a fancy to him and allowed him to learn to read and to write. Andrew prayed fervently to God and attended church services with great devotion, and, in obedience to a heavenly revelation, resolved on the ascesis of folly for Christ&apos;s sake.

Once, when he went to the well for water, he cast off his clothes and cut them to pieces, feigning madness. Saddened by this, his owner Theognostus put him in chains and took him to the church of St. Anastasia the Deliverer from Bonds, that prayers be read for him. But, as Andrew did not recover as far as his owner could see, he was freed as being sick in mind.

Holy Andrew feigned madness all day and spent the nights in prayer. He lived without a roof over his head, spending the nights in the open and going about half-naked in a single, tattered garment and eating a little bread when kindly people shared theirs with him. Whatever he received, he gave away to beggars, and when he gave it to them he would mock them to avoid their thanks, for holy Andrew looked only for the reward from God.

Therefore great grace from God abode in him, and he was able to discern men&apos;s secrets, see angels and demons, drive demons from men and turn men from sin. He had a most wonderful vision of Paradise and the exalted powers of heaven; he saw the Lord Christ on His throne of glory; he, with his disciple Epiphanius, saw the most holy Mother of God in the Blachernae Church, sheltering the Christian people with her veil; he heard in heaven unspeakable words, which he dared not recount to men. After unprecedentedly harsh asceticism, he entered into rest and the eternal glory of his Lord in 911.

A vision of St. Andrew the Fool for Christ: St. Paul was not the only one to be caught up into Paradise and hear &apos;unspeakable words&apos; (II Cor. 12:4). Over eight hundred and fifty years after St. Paul, this happened to St. Andrew. One winter night, holy Andrew was lying among the dogs on a dunghill, to warm his frozen body. An angel appeared to him and caught him up to Paradise (whether in the body or out of the body, Andrew himself was unable to explain) and kept him for two weeks in the heavenly world, bearing him to the third heaven. &apos;I saw myself clad in shining garments like lightning, with a wreath of flowers on my head and girt with a kingly girdle, and I rejoiced greatly at this beauty, and marveled in mind and heart at the unspeakable loveliness of God&apos;s Paradise, and I walked around it with great gladness.&apos;

After that, Andrew writes of how he saw Christ the Lord: &apos;And when a flaming hand drew aside the curtain, I saw my Lord as the Prophet Isaiah saw Him aforetime, sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up and surrounded by seraphim. He was clad in a red garment, His face shone and His eyes rested on me with great kindness. Seeing Him, I fell down before Him, worshipping before the awesome throne of His glory. I have no words for the joy that gripped me at the sight of His face; and now, remembering this vision, I am filled with unspeakable joy. And I heard my most merciful Creator speak three words to me with His most sweet and pure lips, which so sweetened my heart and inflamed it with love for Him that I melted as wax at such spiritual warmth.&apos;

When we read this vision of St.Andrew during our morning prayers the other day, my 16 year old commented that, although there are many depictions of&quot;Hell&quot;, especially in the media,(horror movies and such...) there are not many depictions of&quot;Heaven.&quot;If Heaven was just like walking around in a beautiful arboretum and seeing God, it sounded pretty boring to him, (Sounds O.K. to me,though...)

We are so used to associating a&quot;place&quot;as our reality, rather than recognizing that our reality determines the&quot;place&quot;we are in.

St.Andrew saw what he expected to see as far as Heaven goes, but as I explained to Alexander, it was his interior experience that is what really determined the quality of the&quot;place&quot;he found himself in and that he described as,&quot;Great gladness, unspeakable joy, spiritual warmth which sweetened his heart and inflamed it with love until he felt as if he would melt like wax.&quot;

That is the kind of interior experience I would like to create whichever&quot;place&quot;I might find myself in, whether in this world or in the life of the world to come.

Beyond that, I referred him to the movie,&quot;What dreams may come&quot;which comes close to depicting how our inner state determines our outer environment.

Post by charlotte on Oct 23, 2009, 2:17pm

Thank you, Steven, for the welcome home. Being the eternal idealist I am always thinking of good and great things to come, sort of availing myself of my inner state to bring about the environment I love to live in.

Indeed, and I have read the heavenly vision of Saint Andrew, an experience I strive to earn. Many times a day I feel uplifted walking among the Icons, a warm closeness, and though not in such a glorious vision as Saint Andrew, I did have moments of and in love when I melted as wax. Can Love be anything other than spiritual?

This, then, brings me to the Icon of Christ Pantokrator, and yesterdays subject. By now I know that it is no coincidence that the highest mountain on Corfu is called Mount Pantokrator.

Among the Icons I love are these two, the oldest one known at Saint Catherine&apos;s Monastery at Sinai, and the finely painted image, when enlarged its beauty is breathtaking.

Corfu

A few more points on Saint Spyridon, Corfu, and The Tempest.

Lucy Waring, visitor to the Island, met the&quot;darling of the Aegean, the lad who lives before the wind,&quot;Apollo&apos;s beloved, desire of the sea,&quot;the dolphin . . . the lovely names went rippling by with him as I drew up on the warm rock in the shade of the pines, clasped my knees, and settled down to watch. - The dark-ringed eye watched me steadily, with what I could have sworn was a friendly and interested light.&quot;Later, this Creature of the gods would save her life.

In the cliffs along the coast were caves, some hidden, one of those was thought to be&quot;the original Prospero cell - where he did all his magic.&quot;

The Tempest

Pray you, thread softly, that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall; we are near his cell.

The next line reminds me, though not exactly, of what Steven wrote recently about focussing our attention on what matters.

&quot;This very rock (the Earth) where we&apos;re sitting is a rock because we have been forced to give our attention to it as a rock.&quot;

The Tempest

My cellar is in a rock by th&apos; seaside where my wine is hid....

The following are simply relevant snippets to fill in if inclined.

How didst thou &apos;scape? How camest thou hither? Swear by this bottle how camest thou hither.
I escaped upon the butt of sack which the sailers heaved o&apos;erboard, by this bottle, which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore.

I&apos;ll swear upon this bottle to be thy true subject; for the; for the liquor is not earthly.

No tongue! All eyes! Be silent.

Miranda and Adoni, the Gardner at the Villa, were in love, and it was Adoni who found&quot;a cave behind the lime trees. There&apos;s a passage, and a cave, very deep in the cliff, with water, and that is where he drowned his books.&quot;Among other things, finding the books was&quot;proof of St. Spiridion and his miracles&quot;, said Miranda, who&quot;had never heard of any tempest&quot;, and,&quot;they are there in the water, plain to see, in the very same place where Sir Gale told usthe magic books of the Saint!&quot;It couldn&apos;t be, said Lucy,&quot;books in seawater would turn to pulp in a few hours.&quot;Miranda reminded Lucy that&quot;they are holy books and would not perish.&quot;

The Tempest

I&apos;ll seek him deeper than
e&apos;er plummet sounded,
And with him there lie muddled
The strongest oaths are straw
To th&apos; &apos;fire:&apos; the blood.

He is drown&apos;d
Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.

The power of Shakespeare

Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves;
And ye that on the sands with printless foot
Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him
When he comes back; you demi-puppts that
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
Whereof the yew not bites; and you whose pastime
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice&apos;To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid
Weak masters though ye beI have be-dimm&apos;d
The noontide sun, call&apos;d forth the mutinous winds,
And twixt the green sea and the azur&apos;d vault
Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder
Have I given fire, and rifted Jove&apos;s stout oak
With his own bolt; the stron-bas&apos;d promotory
Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck&apos;d up
The pine and cedar. Graves at my command,
Have wak&apos;d their sleepers, op&apos;d, and let &apos;em forth,
By my so potent art. But this rough magic
I here abjure; and, when I have requir&apos;d
Some heavenly music which even now I do,
To work mine end upon their senses that
This airy charm is for, I&apos;ll brake my staff,
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
And deeper than ever plummet sound,
I&apos;ll drown my book.

Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises,
Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,
That, if I then had wak&apos;d after long sleep,
Will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming,
The clouds methought would open and show riches
Ready to drop upon me, that when I wak&apos;d,
I cried to dream again.

Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
A living drollery. Now I will believe
That there are unicorns; that in Arabia
There is one tree, the phoenix&apos; throne, one phoenix
At this hour reigning there.
I&apos;ll believe both;
And what does else want credit, come to me,
And I&apos;ll be sworn &apos;tis true; travellers ne&apos;er lie,
Though fools at home condemn &apos;em.

You know I believe, and how!

My thoughts of yesterday. Love John, mature, sometimes tender, other&apos;s intensely expressive eyes touching the soul.

The Hagia Sophia Icon and Rublev&apos;s Holy Trinity were one of the first ones I printed. Many can be enlarged full page, and I tape them lightly on doors and walls so they can be easily removed when someone comes, lest they take upon themselves certain prejudices, leaving disturbing vibrations.

Reading this book was like the Lady of Shalott, mentioned in it, looking out the four windows of her Ivory Tower affording me a great view of the Orthodox Church, invaluable to understanding why it is like no other Religion, its purpose and aim to restore us to our original Blessed State.

The living affinity I feel with Saint Spyridon, who wears a&quot;Round Wicker Basket&quot;, which is what His name means, is quite natural as it was the Chief of Miracle Workers of His time, Francis, who rescued the Books of the Island Saint &apos;from the sea&apos; for the benefit of Humanity.

Treating of the romantic Arthurian legend in His Poem, Lord Tennyson has the Lady of Shalott looking from her tower about Camelot to see an Abbot, and a&quot;Red Cross Knight&quot;in shining armor,&quot;the gems on his horses bridle glittering like a Constellation of Stars&quot;, riding&quot;through the purple night&quot;, who is the&quot;Prince of Poorple&quot;, Francis, with whom the Lady falls in love. In the Poem it is Sir Lancelot, but He does not fit the description.

My namesake always gets my attention as I fancy to have been, and am involved in Life to whatever degree. Lord Tennyson&apos;s&quot;remote Island called Shalott&quot;betokens a Tower at Camelot, and the Lady of Shalott seems to be a Fairy who&quot;worked day and night in seclusion weaving a magical and beautiful web, prohibiting her from active involvement with humanity&quot;, which is precisely what the spider Charlotte did for Wilbur, so a relationship between Saint Spyridon of the Orthodox Church on the remote Island of Corfu, Shakespeare/Bacon, and a Weaver, office of the feminine, is established. Read, for thou canst read with utmost attention, to begin to plummet the depths of Nous of Sir Francis Bacon.

His qualities were beautious as his form,
For maiden-tongued was he, and thereof free;
Yet if men moved him, was he such a storm
As oft twixt May and April is to see
When winds breath sweet, unruly though they be.
His rudeness so with his authorized youth
Did lively falseness in a pride of Truth.
So on the tip of his subdoing tongue
All kinds of arguments and question deep,
All replication prompt, and reason strong
For his advantage still did wake and sleep
To make the weaper laugh, the laugher weep.
He had the dialect and different skill
Catching all passions in his craft of Will.

Dear Charlotte,

My family and I will be driving past where you live as I-5 meets 210 on our way to visit my in-laws in Palm Desert this coming Thursday evening.

We will be there four or five days. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Oct 26, 2009, 9:05am

Hallo Steven,

The junction of I 5 and 210 in Pasadena is close to the PRS. I worked in Palm Desert at times, cultivated city in the great Mojave desert. I wish you a pleasant stay in that sunny place and will miss your company.

It was very good being in Church again. The commentary was on how to know a true Apostle from a false one.

1. True Apostles are called by God. They learn the gospel by revelation, either directly from the risen Son, as did the original Apostles, or by the revelation of apostolic tradition. They are called by grace, not according to works or a&quot;proper&quot;background. A true apostle brings glory to God, not himself.

2. True apostles from one church government, holding the same doctrine and working by agreement reached in cauncil.

3. True apostles stand firm in matters of conscience and are correctable when mistaken. Thus, Paul rebukes Peter sharply in public for his hypocritical ethnic elitism.

Saint Paul makes known to the Galatians that the gospel He preaches in not from man. It neither came from him nor was it taught by him, but came through the revelation of Jesus Christ. The Saint tells of of His former conduct of persecuting the Church of God.&quot;But when it pleased God, who seperated me from my mother&apos;s womb and called me through His grace to reveal His Son in me, that I preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord&apos;s brother.&quot;

The Icon workshop is in the Bulletin Board, classes being&quot;two or three days a week&quot;, and no time is given, so I will have to call, also for the location of Bible study given where I live.

Continuing with the Celestial Hierarchy of Dionysius the Areopagite.

It may be of interest to know, and relevant to yesterday&apos;s post, that the Mystic Lull (1232-1316) was strongly influenced by Dionysius&apos; work on Heavenly Hierarchies, as was the Franciscan Friar Giorgi of Venice (1466-1540), whose works Robert Fludd Fludd and John Dee read, therefore influential in the Elisabethan Renaissance. Agrippa and John Colet studied the Epistles of Saint John, teacher of Dionysius, and I now better understand why my Phi-Teacher held the Areopagite in such high esteem.

The Celestial Hierarchy

Divine and Celestial matters revealed by means of similar and sacred representations akin to their nature, and through unlike forms, oxen, lions, and eagles, designed with every possible discordance and difference.

Accordingly this mode of description in the holy
writings honours, rather than dishounours, the Holy
and Celestial Orders by revealing them in unlike
images, manifesting through these their supernal
excellence, far beyond all mundane things. Nor, I
suppose, will any reasonable man deny that
discordant figures uplift the mind more than do
the harmonious, for in dwelling upon the nobler
images, it is probable that we might fall into the
error of supposing that the Celestial Intelligences
are some kind of golden beings, or shining men
flashing like lightening, fair to behold, or clad in
glittering apparel, raying forth harmless fire, or
with such other similar forms as are assigned by
theology to the Celestial Intelligences. But lest
this thing befall those whose mind has conceived
nothing higher than the wonders of visible beauty,
the wisdom of the venerable theologist, which
has power to lead us to the hights, reverently
descends to the level of the inharmonious
dissimilitudes, not allowing our irrational nature
to remain attached to those unseemly images, but
arousing the upward-turning part of the soul, and
stimulating it through the ugliness of the images;
since it would seem neither right nor true, even to
those who kling to earthly things, that such low
forms could resemble those supercelestial and
divine contemplations. Moreover, it must be
borne in mind that no single existing thing is
entirely deprived of participation in the
Beautiful, for, as the Word says, all things are
very beautiful.

Have a great day!

Who was Dionysius the Areopagite

 http://www.archangelsbooks.com/proddetail.asp?prod=HTM-A246 

&quot;MANY CONTEMPORARY oRTHODOX SCHOLARS HAVE DRAWN OUR ATTENTION TO THE GREAT VALUE OF

the mystical and liturgical theology of the East. The depth of Orthodox theology cannot be comprehended unless the importance and perennial relevance of this mystical and liturgical theology is grasped. One of the great values of the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite is the perrennial messgae of the Orthodox mystical tradition which is indeed the heart of all Orthodox theology.

&quot;There are few figures in the history of Christian spirituality who are more inegmatic than the fifth or sixth-century writer known as the Pseudo-Dionysius. The real identity of the person who chose to write under the pseudonym of Dionysius the Areopagite (from Acts 17:34) is unknown. Even the exact dates of his writings have never been determined. Moreover the texts themselves, though relatively short, are at points seemingly impenetrable and have mystified readers over the centuries. Yet the influence of this shadowy figure on a broad range of mystical writers from the early middle ages on is readily discernable. His formulation of a method of negative theology that stresses the importance of human&apos;s attempt to penetrate the&quot;cloud of unknowing&quot;is as famous as is his meditation on the divine names.

&quot;Despite his influence, relatively few attempts have been made to translate the entire corpus of his written into English. Here in one volume are collected all of the Pseudo-Dionysius&apos; works. Each has been translated from the Migne edition, with reference to the forthcoming Gttingen critical edition of A.M. Ritter, G. Heil, and B. Suchla. To present these works to the English-speaking public, an outstanding team of six research scholars has been assembled. The lucid translation of Colm Luibheid has been augmented by Paul Rorem&apos;s notes on textual collaboration. The reader is presented a rich and varied examination of the main themes of Dionysian spirituality by Ren Roques, an incisive discussion of the original questions of authenticity and alleged heresies in the Dionysian corpus by Jaroslav Pelikan, a comprehensive tracing (of) Dionysius, influence on medieval authors by Jean Leclercq, and a survey by Karl Froehlich of the reception given the corpus by Humanists and sixteenth-century reformers.&quot;

 Indeed the inscrutable One is out of the reach of every rational process. Nor can any words come up to the inexpressible Good, this One, this Source of all unity, this supra existent Being. Mind beyond mind, word beyond speech, it is gathered up by no discourse, by no intuition, by no name. 

Dionysius the Areopagite Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Oct 28, 2009, 9:38am

Dionysius the Areopagite holds the mind wonderfully taut with His manner of speaking, uniting the Readers mind with the quality of His.

Holy contemplations can therefore be derived
from all things, and the above-named incongruous
similitudes can be fashioned from material things
to symbolize that which is intelligible and
intellectual, since the intellectual has in another
manner waht has beed attributed differently to the
perceptable. For instance, passion in the irrational
creatures arises from the impulse of appetency,
and their passion is full of all irrationality; but it is
otherwise with the intellectual beings in whom the
energy of passion must be regarded as denoting
their masculine reason and unwavering
steadfastness, established in the changeless
heavenly places. In the same manner, by desire in
irrational creatures we mean the instinctual innate
tendency toward temporal material things, or the
uncontrolled inborn appetites of mutable
creatures, and the dominating irrational desires of
the body which urge the whole creature toward
that for which the senses crave.

But when, using unlike images, we speak of
desire in connection with Intellectual Beings we
must understand by this a divine love of the
Immaterial , above reason and mind, and an
enduring and unshakable superessential longing
for pure and passionless contemplation, and true,
sempiternal, intelligible participation in the most
sublime and purest Light, and in the eternal and
most perfect Beauty. And incontinence we must
understand as that which is intense and
unswerving and irresistible because of its pure and
steadfast love of the Divine Beauty, and the
undeviating urge towards That which most truly is
to be desired.

Today is October 29, and thank you for always posting these sublime Icons.

I read chapter 5 of&quot;Orthodox Psychotherapy&quot;of curing the Soul,&quot;and among the means of healing, first place belongs to guarding the nous, repelling intrusive thoughts and trying to slay them before the can enter the gate of the heart&quot;, and remembered the smacking the camel&apos;s nose before it gets into the tent, and the practice of watching and praying go together and are the royal road that leads directly to the Kingdom, in the beginning of this thread, what we spoke of and how much has transpired since.

&quot;But it is not only those called neptic (sober-minded ascetic) Fathers who mention and describe the holy atmosphere of hesychia, it is also those known as&quot;social&quot;. Actually in the Orthodox tradition there is no direct opposition between theoria and praxis, nor between the neptic and social Fathers. The neptics are eminently social and those in community are unimaginably neptic.&quot;

Not that I compare myself to the above, but two days ago I spoke with someone about socializing, me saying that I keep mostly to myself, the Lady replying that I don&apos;t appear to be anti-social, yet modern, intellectually orientated psychology would say that such religious therapy is out-dated.

When there is no pebble tossed....

Most difficult to check thoughts, however, holding negative ones at bay with a habitual get-away motion of my head has become much easier with practice. Happy and pleasing ones may enter, though the Church Fathers advise to pray ceaselessly to banish all thoughts. My desert is the morning stillness and contemplating Icons stills my mind, for a while anyway. Peace of mind is hard to come by and seems to depend largely whether one is content with life&apos;s circumstances.

Sometimes the nous is&quot;stilled into joyful silence&quot;, which everyone experiences when something totally unexpected, completely out of the ordinary and wonderful happens in daily life, which we affirm is&quot;a God sent&quot;or&quot;God given moment&quot;, we are utterly delighted and stand in awe and can scarcely believe it and want to tell everybody. Far and few in between those, there are some such we tell only our closest friend and confidant, and the most profound occurrence abides shut up in our heart. The Golden Silence.

&quot;He who is not attracted by worldly things cherishes stillness. For all men need this devotion and stillness, total or partial, and without it, it is impossible to attain any humility and spiritual knowledge.

&quot;The holy Fathers call this the soul&apos;s peace and Sabbath rest. But hesychia is also closely connected with keeping the commandments of Christ. The greatest weapons of anyone striving to lead a life of inner stillness with patience are&quot;self-control, love, attentiveness and spiritual reading&quot;. According to St. Gregory of Sinai, anyone who practices hesychasm must have as a foundation the virtues of&quot;silence, self-control, vigils, humility and patience&quot;. Likewise he should have three activities pleasing God:&quot;psalmody, prayer and reading, and work with his hands&quot;. One must have Faith,&quot;and with one&apos;s whole heart, stenght and power, to love and hope.&quot;For these support and protect one another; prayer is born of them and grows for ever.&quot;This is true.

The method&quot;of training in Hesychia - and this must be strongly emphasised - is connected with repentence, tears, sorrow, compuntion. Without these it is false and therefore not helpful. For the aim of hesychia is purification of the heart and nous. This is not conceivable without tears and mourning. Hence, for the athlete of of noeit hesychia, tears are a way of life. Through concentration his nous in his heart he becomes capable of seeing his wretchedness, and at once his eyes, and his heart itself, sheds tears of repentance. As repentance grows, he is purified and acquires knowledge of God.&quot;

Maybe that is why my prayer always turns to a whisper and ends in tears asking for mercy. I already cried rivers with millions of other people, I&apos;m sure, but there seems to be no rest for the wicked, and I&apos;m not even wicked, wretched yes, in that my praying is many times interrupted by thoughts and therefore superficial, and all I can do is to petition again for mercy for that offence and so on confirming that praying ceaselessly would be necessary to acquire knowledge of God. It seems it would take forever, but the good news is that as the Saints, with constant entreaties and prayers&quot;we somehow touch that untouchable and blessed essence. And thus those who have been purified in heart through holy hesychia, after being ineffably permiated by the light which is above sense and nous, see God withing themselves as in a mirror.&quot;

&quot;Therefore the Fathers speak of&quot;fruiting stillness&quot;. When rightly practiced it offers great help to a person, it reshapes his personality, renews his being, unites with God. Then his social relationships are set right and well. When a man acquires love for God he also acquires love for mankind.&quot;

Excerpts from the informative pages on Orthodoxy

Chapter 2

&quot;So far I hope I have established the truth that Christianity is mainly a therapeutic science. It is seeking the spiritual healing of man. Yet the right practice of medecine requires a good physician, a professional physician, and this applies to spiritual healing as well. There has to be a good doctor. He is the bishop and the priest.

&quot;Worship and sacrament must be placed within the therapeutic method of treatment.

&quot;In the theology of St. Maximus the Confessor these three stages are expressed as practical philosophy (negative and positive purification), natural theoria (illumination of the nous) and mystical theology (deification). The Fathers of the Church, having with drawn from all creatures, ascend to the vision of God, and this vision reaches the highest degree of&quot;theological science or&quot;theological mystagogy&quot;or mystical theology&quot;, which is also called&quot;Unforgettable spiritual knowledge.&quot;

&quot;So the Fathers living in theoria (vision of God) are the real theologians or even the real theology, since theology fills their whole existence.&quot;

Shades of my years in Philosophy. Remembering that the Nous refers to&quot;the eye of the heart &quot;,&quot;energy of the psyche &quot;often translated as mind or intellect,&quot;our highest faculty&quot;, when cleansed, the nous resides and operates from within the heart; it can perceive God and the spiritual principles that underliie creation; it is cognitive, visionary, and intuitive. he nous is in the image of God. And in as much as God is light, the nous too has light mirrored in it by the Grace of God.&quot;

&quot;Faith is not an abstract teaching, but it is an&quot;understanding and vision of the heart&quot;, it is the life of the Holy Spirit in our soul.&quot;

&quot;Moses, according to St. Maxi,us, was a theologian, because he pitched his tent outside the camp,&quot;that is, when he established his will and mind outside the world of visible things he began to worship God.&quot;The three chosen disciples were also proven to be theologians on Mt. Tabor when they were granted to see the lightof the trisolar divinity. St. Paul too,who was caught up in the third heaven, was a theologian. St. Maximus explains that the three heavens correspond to the three degrees of man&apos;s mystical ascent, namely, practical philosophy, natural theoria and mystical theology.

&quot;We have presented this patristic teaching in order to go on to correlate it with the subject which concerns us in this chapter. St. Maximus links the three stages of the spiritual life with the three degrees of priesthood. He writes:&quot;He who anoints his nous for spiritual contest and drives all impassioned thoughts out of it has the quality of a deacon. He who illuminates his nous with knowledge of created beings and utterly destroys false knowledge has the quality of a priest. And he who perfects his nous with the holy myrrh of the knowledge and woship of the Holy Trinity has the quality of a bishop.

&quot;A prerequisite in the selection of a priest or bishop must have previous spiritual experience.

&quot;Those whom God has appinted in the Church&apos; (1Cor.12,28) clearly refers to those who have received the visitation of the Holy Spirit, with deification of the apostles and prophets and illumination of the rest, and not only through a lithurgical act.

&quot;Indeed St. John Chrysostom writes that a priest has to have more attentiveness and spiritual strenght even than the hermits themselves. For if the hermits, who are freed from&quot;the city, the market place and its people&quot;, are not secure in spirit, how much more strenght and vigour needs to be exercised by the priest in order to be able to&quot;snatch his soul away from all the infection and keep its spiritual beauty inviolate. That is why he affirms that the clergy who live in the world need more purity than the monks.&quot;

The great responsibility of&quot;the priesthood is a therepeutic science whose main work is to cure men.

&quot;It is the Holy Spirit and, in more general terms, the grace of the Holy Trinity which accomplishes the cure of sick Christianity.

&quot;Last of all, says St. Paul, I saw him like the last child that comes to birth unexpectedly.&quot;

It reminds me of the&quot;sudden Enlightenment&quot;, and St. Paul&apos;s&quot;Christ in you the hope of Glory&quot;is the last child need to be born. Trice written on the last page of the Bible:&quot;Behold I come quickly&quot;.

One could hardly imagine a more beautiful day as today in LA, and such a one I wish the Reader.

Today was the best day I ever had in Church, especially the first half hour when this House of God was intermittently suffused by what Steven termed an&quot;otherwordly&quot;quality. Vague, undefinable images manifested among painted images in my view and I felt the Spirit of Welcome all about me. Perhaps it was the Holy Spirit for Holy it was and I felt at Home. Truly, I felt and joined the Devotion of the Priests and Singers, my Faith grew strong in a wonderful manner and when I sang a wrong word or tone I smiled because I felt so sincere that it didn&apos;t matter.

One of the things Father Ceko emphasized today was, not to just come to Church and then forget about all week, but take &apos;it&apos; out into the world with us, so I did by writing the above.

The Prophet Joel, whose name means&quot;Yahweh is God&quot;, and who prophesied impending destruction and pestilence, was honored, and says:

&quot;And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour our my spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.&quot;

The reading from the Holy Gospel according to Saint Luke, was the parable of a&quot;sower went out to sow his seed, some fell by the wayside and was trampled, some fell on rock but withered for lack of moisture, some fell among thorns and were chocked. But others fell on good ground, sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold&quot;. When He had said these things He cried,&quot;He who has ears to hear, let him hear!&quot;

The disciples asked Him what the parable meant, and He said,&quot;To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest it is given in parables, that&quot;seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand&quot;.

Father Ceko gave the analogy of the seed falling into good ground and growing strong roots over thousands of years to the Sequoia Trees on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in northern California. Some are 3000 years old, the largest over 20 feet wide and 300 feet tall. These giants, surviving fires and resisting destruction by bugs, Father Ceko compared to the Saints rooted in the Orthodox tradition, having survived all maladies.

My sister and I drove the scenic drive and walked among these trees, 4 of the 5 biggest trees in the world are there. One time I drove the route alone and purchased some sterling silver forks and spoons, the larger type for serving. Quaint little shops there to buy all sorts of stuff, mostly what one doesn&apos;t need.

Hope you have the patience of a Saint!

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Nov 2, 2009, 11:34am

Similar to Erasmus, an inner spiritual wind is blowing stronger setting my sails to Holy Literature. Though not pure Holy Literature, Orthodox Psychology is a means to the better understanding thereof.

Chapter 2

&quot;However, in order for a person to be an Orthodox therapist and cure the spiritual ills of his spiritual children, he himself must previously have been healed as far as possible, he must stand&quot;in the middle between praxis and theoria&quot;. How can one heal without having previously been healed or without having tasted the beginning of healing? Therefore St. Symeon accuses those who regard themselves as spiritual directors before being imbued with the Holy Spirit, rashly receiving others&apos; confessions and daring to rule monasteries or occupy other positions of authority,&quot;pushing themselves forward shamelessly by a thousand intrigues to be made metropolitans or bishops to guide the Lord&apos;s people...&quot;before they have seen the bridegroom&quot;in the bridal chamber&quot;and become&quot;sons of light and sons of the day.&quot;

This I know to be so, not just &apos;believe&apos;, and I like to mention again the tasting of the beginning of healing I have experienced yesterday, be it even the very beginning it was sublime.

Being one of my favorite Saints, I love when the Areopagite comes up.

&quot;St. Symeon instigated a rebellion against the situation which he described, with the result that the healing mission of the Church was restored to a central position of Orthodoxy and the hesychasm (silence) of the Fathers took hold of the hierarchy once more, as St. Dionysios the Areopagite anticipated. Under the leadership of the hesychasm of the Fathers, the Church and the nation survived after the dissolution of the empire, because the patristic therapeutic training which we have described gave the Church the power to blossom in the hard times of the Arab, Frankish and Turkish rule...&quot;

You know (I like the tone of these two words), my Phi-Teacher said once to us, that someday, when we think of Him and what we have learned, we will realize that he knew enough of what He taught to know all of it, and so it is because much of what I&apos;m writing He knew, in particular, as I noted before, of Dionysios.

&quot;We cannot resist referring to a characteristic passage in St. Dionysios which says that divine rays are granted to those who are most godlike, most suitable for spreading and sharing the Light. It is the task of those who see God to reveal to the priests&quot;in proportion to their capacity&quot;the divine visions which they have beheld. Likewise it is their task&quot;to reveal all that has to do with their hierarchy, since they have received the power to give this instruction&quot;. This means that it is only after personal perfection that one can rise to a higher position; and the higher position is occupied by a God-inspired person, one who knows God through experience.

&quot;It is very significant that, according to St. Dionysios, bishops are not solely occupied with perfection, but they illumine and purify as well. Similarely the priests have the understanding both to illuminate and purify, while the deacons only know how to purify.&quot;Inferiors may not trespass on the functions of their superiors&quot;. So the duties of each degree of the Church&apos;s ministry is strictly regulated in that each order possesses its own science and knowledge of the spiritual life. I think we must place here a characeristic passage in which Dionysios sums up this whole teaching about the work of the three orders:&quot;The rank of the sacred ministers is divided in the following manner. Their first power consists in purifying the uninitiated by way of the sacraments. The middle power is to bring illumination to those whom they have purified. Finally, they have the most marvellous power of all, one which embraces all who commune in God&apos;s light, the power to perfect these by way of the perfected understanding they have of that to which they have been initiated.&quot;

They are entitled because they know what they&apos;re doing.

&quot;As we study the teachings of st. Dionysios we come to see that each of the three degrees of the priesthood corresponds to a stage of the spiritual life. Since, the task of the deacon is to purify others of passions, he should himself, prior to ordination, have reached a stage of purification so that he is himself a living exponent of the practical philosophy. Since according to the patristic teachings it is the priest&apos;s task to illuminate others, his ordination presupposes that he has an illuminated nous, which, as we have seen, is a degree of theoria. Thus the priest must remember God unceasingly in prayer, must know spiritual work, be fluent in Holy Scripture and be able to contemplate the inner principles of all created things. As for the bishop, since his primary task is to perfect the people by inner principles of theology, he must experience the mystical theology, live in communion with God. This close relationship with God makes him a prophet, a divine initiate capable of mystically imparting the word of truth to the people of God.

&quot;It is well known that in his work&quot;The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy&quot;St. Dionysios the Areopagite describes the three stages of spiritual - purification, illumination and perfection. - The work of the clergy is liturgical, and sanctifying and perfecting, since it is through the sacraments that the spiritual life of man develops.&quot;

The Sacramental Initiation.

As above so below. The below reflects the Hierarchy above just described. Every wordly Institution, Corporation, small business, a family, has a hierarchy in which the&quot;lower&quot;members may not trespass the ordered structure.

And when many people prattle that the Church is nothing more than to control the herd, surely they are not speaking of the Orthodox Church where&quot;the concept of FREEDOM within the existence of the Holy Trinity&quot;is constantly emphasized:

&quot;The Holy Spirit is a spirit of freedom, and does not force man. Besides, the event of Christ, the very nature of Christophany, is such that it fully respects a person&apos;s freedom.&quot;

This was clearly stated by Steven, several times in the beginning of this thread, and in yesterday&apos;s commentary on the sowing of seeds:

&quot;A persons unwillingness to understand Christ&apos;s parables is due to a rejection of His Kingdom.&quot;If the blindness were natural, it would have been proper for God to open their eyes; but because it was a voluntary and self-chosen blindness, He does not overthow free will.&quot;Doing so would have been not only to&quot;no advantage for them, but an even greater condemnation&quot;. The words of St. John Chrysostom, who by these words is recognized a Master Psychotherapist, at the same time answering the oft asked question,&quot;Why don&apos;t those who know the Mysteries just tell it to us?&quot;It would not give&quot;understanding&quot;, would be hearsay, subject to believe, unacceptable in any Court of Law, above and below, below you have to be an eye-witness to an event to testify, and above, the Orthodx Church insists/demands&quot;experience&quot;to testify of knowledge of God.

All the while I&apos;m writing on Dionysios the Areopagite I have this feeling that this anonymous person has contributed to the Corpus Hermeticum.

No one shall sleep

Translation

Nobody shall sleep!
Nobody shall sleep!
Even you, o Princess,
in your cold room,
watch the stars,
that tremble with love and with hope.
But my secret is hidden within me,
my name no one shall know
No!.... No!....
On your mouth I will tell it when the light shines.
And my kiss will dissolve the silence that makes you mine!....
(No one will know his name and we must, alas, die.)
Vanish, o night!
Set, stars! Set, stars!
At dawn, I will win! I will win! I will win!

While at my In-laws, I found this article in a copy of Newsweek, (Something I otherwise would never even look at...) It&apos;s right on our current topic of Hesychia.


Julia Baird
The Devil Loves Cell Phones

Silence isn&apos;t just goldenit&apos;s heavenly.

It&apos;s not hard to imagine hell as a place that is very, very noisy. In The Screwtape Letters, C. S. Lewis&apos;s Devil detests music and silence. Hell, he crowed, was filled with furious noise:&quot;the audible expression of all that is exultant, ruthless and virileWe will make the whole universe a noiseWe have already made great strides in this direction as regards the Earth. The melodies and silences of Heaven will be shouted down in the end.&quot;

In the Middle Ages, Christian scholars believed that Satan did not want human beings to be alone with God, or with each other, fully alert and listening. This is why British author Sara Maitland believes the mobile phone is a&quot;major breakthrough for the powers of hell.&quot;Maitland is more conscious of noise than mostshe spent more than a decade pursuing silence like a hunter its prey. She writes in A Book of Silence, just published in the U.S., how she traveled to the desert, the hills, and the remote Scottish Highlands because she wanted to discover what silence truly was, and immerse herself in it.&quot;I am convinced that as a whole society we are losing something precious in our increasingly silence-avoiding culture,&quot;she writes,&quot;and that somehow, whatever this silence might be, it needs holding, nourishing and unpacking.&quot;

After spending 40 days in an isolated house on a windy moor, Maitland found silence did several things: her physical sensations were heightened (she was overwhelmed by the deliciousness of porridge, heard different notes in the wind, was more sensitive to temperature, and emotional); she became what she calls&quot;disinhibited&quot;(a Jungian notion that once alone, you are free to do what you wantpicking your nose while eating, stripping your clothes off, abandoning grooming, washing once a week); she heard voices (a young girl, then a male choir singing in Latin, which she thinks may have been the wind); experienced great happiness; felt connected with the cosmos; was exhilarated by the risk and peril in what she was doing; and discovered a fierce joy, or bliss.

It is a strikingly refreshing book to read, in the midst of the clamor and din, ever-mounting distraction, yelling TV pundits, solipsistic tweet-ing, and flash-card sentiment of our Internet age. It made me realize what a profound longing many of us have for silence, how hard it is to find, and how easily we forget how much we need it. Most snatch it in small grabshot baths, long runs, lap swimming, bike rides. Maitland rails against the idea of silence as void, absence, and lacksomething that we must rush to fillinsisting it is positive and nurturing, and something more profound that must be actively sought. (When silence is imposed, of course, it is something entirely different.)

What&apos;s interesting about silence is not just the extremism, often merging on madness, of those who can claim to have lived silently: the Arctic explorer, the deep-sea diver, the sailor, the hermit, the ascetic, the nun. What is also important is what the rest of us can wring from the more mundane moments of stillness. We can&apos;t all skip around nude through the Scottish bracken, or inhabit caves in Tibetan mountains, but we can experience silence in ways so potent they become addictive: the magical quiet of swimming under the sea; the uninterrupted hours after midnight; the sweet intimacy between a mother and her baby, being nursed in the wee hours; the breathless stillness after excellent sex; the hush of awe while gazing at a proud, ancient mountain, a huge rock glowing red in the desert, or someone soaring down a 20-foot wave. Even if it is not pure silence, it can be enough. We may not all have visions of a spinning, shining, silent God as Maitland does, but, as our thoughts are stripped back and stilled, we might sense the mystery of something greater than ourselves.

We often talk about distraction, and the banality of a culture that seems to smother deep thought or time-sucking contemplationwe tweet sneezes, we blink and record it for our friends, we sprint to be the first to speak. The anonymity of the Internet has been replaced by hyper-identity; the idea of shutting up and staring at a rock, piles of sand, or blinking stars for hours, if not weeks, seems profoundly countercultural.

I know, it sounds like the lament of the Luddite. But if generations of mystics and seekers have insisted that there&apos;s something that connects silence with the sublime, you have to wonder what we are distracting ourselves fromand who we could be if, every now and then, we paused.


&quot;Silence tells me secretly, everything, everything.&quot;

And, In the words of the Bard of Avon,&quot;The rest is silence...&quot;

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHo81_A56EE 

And from Robert Hunter in a song called,&quot;The last song&quot;on a fantastic album entitled,&quot;Mickey Hart&apos;s Mystery box&quot;:

&quot;Take a stack of rhythm parts
and pump them full of thunder
two parts lightning in the dark
and one part naked wonder
sing the parts that can be sung
and trust the heart for guidance
ring the bells that can be rung
and leave the rest to silence&quot;

Be still and Know I Am God.

Welcome back Steven, I hope all went and is well.

I called the Parish office yesterday morning concerning the Icon Workshops as no one could give me exact information on Sunday. I introduced myself and posed my questions, also where the Bible studies are held in .... where I live. The Gentleman and I spoke for a few minutes during which I said I attend the Matins and Holy Liturgy there, but the vespers here etc. He wondered why He had never met me,&quot;I&apos;m the other Priest here&quot;, He said with this clear voice I liked listening to.&quot;O, are you the Priest performing the Matins?&quot;&quot;That&apos;s me&quot;, He &apos;smiled&apos;, and I was so delighted because it is He who repeatedly begins,&quot;Again and again let us pray to the Lord....&quot;, and His deep Devotion transfers to me every time - as I conveyed in my post.

Then I spoke to Papadia Sandra, who told me the next Bible study is on the 17th, but has to find out where, the Icon Classes are held in the evenings at 7:00. Uhh, I left at 6:00 and got to freeway 710 at a standstill, big trucks from the Long Beach Harbor lined up and we couldn&apos;t even get to the on-ramp so I turned into a maze of small towns hopelessly lost. I had suspected as much, hence I attend the Vespers here.

The good news is that Sunday, in Escondido, His Grace Bishop Maxim, will celebrate a Hierarchical Divine Liturgy at the Meeting of our Lord Monastery, afterwards a picnic and Serbian Music. I look forward to spending all day there.

I began reading Chapter 6 of Orthodox Psychotheraphy, the last of Chapter 2 for the interested Reader:

&quot;To be sure, in all the history of the Church things have not been so&quot;rosy&quot;. There have been situations when this truth was lost, and then the people were in the darkness of ignorance. They did not know that there was such a thing as spiritual healing or how it took place, because there were not men to teach the way of healing. As early as the fourth century Isidor of Pelusium was showing how the early pastors differed from those of his time. At that time, he said, pastors died for their sheep, while today they themselves slay the sheep. He goes on to write characteristically:&quot;In the old days lovers of virtue entered the priesthood; now it is lovers of money. Once they fled from the office because of its magnitude; now they run after it with pleasure. Then they were willing to take pride in their poverty, now they gladly and greedily hoard up money. Once the divine court of justice was before their eyes, but now it is a thing of indifference. Once men were subject to blows; now they inflict them. Need to continue? The priestly office seems to have changed into a mode of tyranny: humility has been transformed into arrogance, fasting into luxery, economy into despotism; for as economists they are not fit to administrate, but as despots they embezzle...&quot;

Such was spoken in the 4th century and is true today. I happened on a meaningful interpretation of&quot;Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth&quot;, which differs from the usual understanding of falling on one&apos;s knees before the clergy in submission or quietly take abuse from persons of authority, which Fern called&quot;crawling humility&quot;.

&quot;The Greek word&quot;praos,&quot;translates as&quot;meek,&quot;originally meant becoming tamed, as a wild animal is tamed,&quot;suggesting&quot;a capacity for going against all natural resentfulness and passion and anger.&quot;Thus, learning to master and direct one&apos;s instincts and reactions can lead to a level in oneself called the Kingdom of Heaven.&quot;

How did the Egyptians describe the sacrificing and purifying the&quot;city&quot;, and the hierarchy?

&quot;From the bows of the boats the soldiers leaped into the city, and captured it with all the force of a water-flood. At dawn next day the king sent me to protect the temples, and then he went and made an offering to the gods, and he purified the city, and made sacrifices to Ptah and Seker. At this time Anapeth and Merkanshu, and Peta-Ast tendered their submission and brought him gifts. The following day Piankhi crossed the river to Kher-Aha, and sacrificed to Temu, and then he went on to Heliopolis to perform ceremonies in honor of the gods there. He first purified himself by bathing his face in the Sun-Well, and then he offered white oxen to Ra. He entered the temple of Ra, and prayed many prayers there, and the high-priest also prayed on his behalf. This done, he asperged and censed himself, and then, taking with him flowers and perfume, he mounted the steps of the shrine, and opened the doors of the ark and sealed them, he ordered the priests to let no other king enter the sanctuary. Piankhi was thus acknowledged king of Egypt by the god Amen-Ra, and all the people knew that they must tender to him their submission as the god&apos;s vice-gerent upon earth. The following day the Erpu Peta-Ast submitted and paid him large tribute, and fifteen other kings, and dukes, and governors followed his example.&quot;

Like Don says: ingenious, these Egyptians!

Remembrance of Death

Our body is like a house or a car. We live IN our house and our car is a vehicle that we use to get around in. When we leave our house or get out of our car we do not cease to exist. The same is true for our bodies.

In our culture we identify with our bodies as our&quot;Self&quot;so strongly, that we can&apos;t imagine any kind of existence without it. We are not our bodies however, we are our Soul which lives IN our body and uses it to get around in this three dimensional world we presently inhabit. Death is the separation of our Soul from the body and a transition into another mode of being.

This is why, as Orthodox Christians, we pray that we might be preserved from sudden death. We want time to go through death consciously, without losing the thread of awareness. Death can be like walking through a doorway from one mode of existence into another if we are conscious and prepared for it. Otherwise, if it happens too suddenly or violently, it can be disorienting when we find ourselves on the other side where other, much less limited laws of manifestation are in effect, (Especially if we don&apos;t expect that we will continue to exist in the first place...)

This is why a long, drawn out illness, may be a blessing in disguise for some people, giving them an opportunity to prepare for death in a way that they, otherwise, might not have. Illness and other causes of suffering tend to strip us of everything that is superfluous in our lives, (If we haven&apos;t taken the opportunity to do this voluntarily by actively engaging in a genuine spiritual life,) revealing to us the things which really matter, clarifying the state of our relationship with God and our fellow man.

Many cultures throughout the world have a celebration which centers around this idea of&quot;Remembrance of death&quot;at&quot;Harvest time&quot;as death is the&quot;Harvest&quot;of our life. The seeds we have sown during our life, be they good seeds or bad seeds, we reap at our death. In our culture,unfortunately, only the worst aspects of death are remembered, Hell, the dead who find no rest, and the fallen angels, whose vices are looked at as our only opportunity to enjoy ourselves before our inevitable, unpleasant end.

As Orthodox Christians, what&quot;Halloween&quot;has become is a travesty and mockery, not only of what we understand to be the nature of&quot;Remembrance of death&quot;, but, even of it&apos;s pre-Christian,&quot;Pagan&quot;roots.

Setting aside the errors of the modern world, we pray in our prayers before sleep each night:&quot;Grant us to pass the night of the whole present life with wakeful heart and sober thought, ever expecting the coming of the radiant day of the appearing of Thy only- begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, when the judge of all will come with Glory to render to each according to their deeds. May we not be found fallen and idle, but awake and alert for action, ready to accompany Him into the joy and Divine palace of His Glory, where there is the ceaseless sound of those keeping festival and the unspeakable delight of those who behold the ineffable beauty of Thy countenance.&quot; Re: The Secret of the Universe

Dear Charlotte,

GREETINGS! I am very inspired by the content of your posts while I was away.

I look forward to your visit with His Grace in Escondido. My youngest son, John has visited there, but not myself as of yet...

Please Give His Grace my love and best wishes. I hope to be seeing him up here again soon for the consecration of our new Church building here in Anderson. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Thank you, Steven, I did and do much reading in the wee hours of silent mornings, love to hear the first sleepy faint warble of a bird disturbed by the sudden hard sound of the news paper sliding along cement, and worse, clicking on a link,&quot;Congratulations, you have won&quot;, is literally a shock to the mind and body.

Should I have the opportunity, I will convey thy love and best wishes to His Grace.

A&quot;hot anti-hesychastic wind&quot;is blowing, remarked a Nun. Everywhere people with phones next or in their ears, or texting while shoping and speaking to someone. I ignore all these things. Nowhere can one do shopping, or to the bank, without being adjured to join this club or the special of the day being strongly offered until one literally and impolitely cuts the person off. The Devil detesting music and silence reminds me of the German axiom:

Wo man sing&apos;d da lass Dich frhlich nieder
Denn bse Menschen haben keine Lieder.

Where there is singing there join gladly
For depraved Poeple have no Song

Orthodox Psychotherapy

&quot;Some people maintain that hesychia in the way described by the Fathers is inaction, not action. In reality the opposite is the case. Hesychia is very great action in invisibility and silence. The person is in repose and stillness in order to speak with God, in order to allow himself his freedom and to receive God Himself. And if we consider the fact that the greatest problems which torment us are physical and internal, and if we think that most illnesses (psychological and physical) originate from the elaboration of thoughts, that is, from impurity of the nous and the heart, we can understand the great value of noetic hesychia. So it is action and life. Hesychia offers the indispensable conditions for loving one&apos;s brother dispassionately, for acquiring selfless and dispassionate love.

&quot;Worst of all is the fact that this&quot;worldly&quot;attitude, the anti-hesychastic life, is even dominationg the monks, it has crept even into the monasteries, which were supposed to be&quot;schools dedicated to God&quot;, to be the medical schools where medical science would be taught. An attitude of mind prevails that we must know about those things but they are not for us! I have personal knowledge that&quot;prominent&quot;monks who have responsibility for Orthodox guidence of young monks characterise all the subjects related to the hesychastic life as &apos;fables&apos;, as not worth speaking about, as cases of delusion!!!

&quot;This is really sad. Hesychia has from the beginning been a characteristic mark of Orthodox monastic life.&quot;

Another hindrence on the path is&quot;the &apos;wealth&apos; which is reason - the attempt of intelligence to penetrate the mystery of being and apprehend the Divine word. Such endeavours inevitably involve the imagination, to which many are inclined to give the high-flown label, divine inspiration. The ascetic, devoting himself to active inner silence and pure prayer, resolutely combats this &apos;creative&apos; impulse within himself because he sees in it a &apos;processus&apos; contrary to the true order of being, with man &apos;creating&apos; God in his own image and likeness.&quot;

Have a great Day!

Epistemology, epistanai=to understand, episteme=knowledge.

The branch of philosophy that studies the nature of knowledge, its presuppositions, and its extent and validity.

How knowledge of a given subject could be attained.

Orthodox Epistemology

The three degrees of knowledge according to St. Isaac the Syrian

&quot;St. Isaac the Syrian develops the theme of the degrees of knowledge in chapters fifty-two and fifty-three of his Ascetical Homilies.

&quot;He begins by contrasting knowledge and faith. Human knowledge is marked by the fact that it has no authorityto do anything&quot;without investigation and examination&quot;, but it must investegate whether that which it desires is possible. In human knowledge there is a great deal of intelligence, and it is mainly fallen intelligence which is at work, having overstepped its natural limits; that is to say, it is an intelligence which dominates the nous as well. Faith, however, has different limits, and herein seems to lie its great difference from human knowledge, as well as its great value. St. Isaac says that when we use the word &apos;faith&apos; we do not mean the handing down of the dogmatic truths about the Persons of the Holy Trinity and about Christ&apos;s becoming man and about the assumption of human nature by the Second Person of the Trinity,&quot;although this faith is also very lofty&quot;, but the main meaning of what we call faith is&quot;that light which by grace dawns in the soul and fortifies the heart by the testimony of the mind, making it undoubting through the assurance of hope&quot;.

Faith is that light which by grace dawns in the soul and fortifies the heart by the testimony of the mind, making it undoubting through the assurance of hope. A most cogent argument, clear, incisive.

&quot;This spiritual faith does not learn the mysteries by aural (oral?) tradition,&quot;but with spiritual eyes it beholds the mysteries conceiled in the soul, and the secret and divine riches that are hidden away from the eyes of the sons of the flesh, (daughters too) but unveiled by the spirit of those who abide at Christ&apos;s table through their study of His laws&quot;. That is to say that while human knowledge is acquired through activity of the intelligence and through human research, divine knowledge is acquired through faith. This faith is mainly that which draws in the soul from the light of grace, and through this power one learns all the mysteries which are hidden from the eyes of the carnal men of this age. So&quot;faith is more subtle than knowledge, just as knowledge is more subtle than palpable things&quot;. Faith, which is divine knowledge, is more subtle than human knowledge&quot;.

The soul draws faith from the light of grace, it is why during my experience in Church last Sunday my faith strenghtened, clearly discernable accompanied by a feeling of happy power. Never thought of happy power before.

My printer is literally on the blink, two red lights blinking and no matter what I do it wont move. &apos;Help&apos; tells me to buy a new printer.

Have a great day!

Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things, as of yet, unseen.

The soul knows before the mind or the senses apprehend.

This is why faith in God is impossible to prove logically to the rational mind. It&apos;s something that just happens. Something we know at a deeper level than reason and therefore, seems to be madness to the unenlightened.

&quot;Faith may be madness, but doubt is insane!&quot;
Robert Hunter Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Nov 6, 2009, 10:07am

There are 7 billion people living on our planet and most of them wouldn&apos;t make it through life without faith, no matter the religious affiliation.

The analytical method of the Author of Orthodox Psychotherapy, Archimandrite Hierotheos Vlachos, easy to read and understand, deepens faith.

&quot;.... faith&quot;requires a mode of thinking that is single, limpidly pure and simple, far emoved from any deviousness or invention of methods... The home of faith is a childlike thought and a simple heart&quot;. While human knowledge has intelligence at its centre, faith has the simple and guileless heart. Human knowledge&quot;keeps within the boundries of nature&quot;while faith&quot;makes its journey above nature&quot;. That is to say, human knowledge is a purely natural condition, working within natural limits, while faith is a supernatural condition.&quot;

This natural condition of human knowledge is expressed in the axiom,&quot;Knowledge is Power&quot;, but it is as of less than nothing compaired to the power of the Miracle Workers.

&quot;Likewise human knowledge is unable to do anything without matter; it moves in a material world, while faith has authority, after the likeness of God, to make a new creation. Human knowledge does not dare nor wish to overstep the boundries of nature, while faith&quot;transgresses them with authority&quot;. This is demonstrated by the lives of all the saints who, by the power of faith&quot;have entered into flames and bridled the burning power of the fire, walking unharmed through the midst of it, and they have trodden upon the back of the sea as upon dry land&quot;. And all these things which faith does are above nature and contrary to human knowledge. Human knowledge always seeks means&quot;to safeguard those who have acquired it&quot;, that is, it always takes protective measures and seeks to protect man by human means. But faith leaves it entirely up to God.&quot;The man who prays in faith never employs, or is engaged in, ways and means&quot;. Human knowledge does not begin a piece of work without having examined how it will end, while faith says:&quot;All things are possible to him that believes. For to God nothing is impossible&quot;.

These protective measures taken by those who acquired knowledge of natural things is well known; on the other hand, so much &apos;knowledge&apos; in the vaious fields science is educated guess, and then comes conventional Egyptology, couldn&apos;t help it.

Always on the agenda of the Orthodox teachings is&quot;love for one&apos;s neighbor, humility of heart, forgiving those who have sinned, recollection of good things, investigation of the mysteries concealed in the Scripture, the mind&apos;s occupation with good works, the bridling of the soul&apos;s passions, and the rest of such virtues,&quot;all these require knowledge&quot;. Knowledge guards them and teaches their order&quot;. And all these things are steps by which the soul ascends&quot;to the more lofty heights of faith&quot;. However,&quot;faith&apos;s way of life is more exalted than virtue&apos;s labour, and it is not labour but perfect rest, consolation, and is accomplished in the heart and within the soul&quot;.

&quot;For faith is a charismatic condition, communion with God; it is the&quot;hearts understanding and vision&quot;, it is the life which develops in the soul with the coming of the light of divine grace.&quot;

Similar to so many other expressions, the word charismatic is now mostly thought of and used in derogatory fashion.

Robert Hunter

Still I thank thee, Lord

Finally installed my new printer and, thank you, printed the unusual Icon of St. Symeon. The colors are great and printing speedier.

&quot;Partakers of God&quot;is deLightful to read, yet again elucidating clearly theological Truths, Truths for there is no contrary response from the Soul which knows and recognizes what it is made aware of in thus presented language.

I have to read it again in the stillness of the morning before I drive to Escondido. It&apos;s nay impossible to catch up with you, Steven, I&apos;m not finished with Orthodox Psychotherapy, want to read Dionysios, then synthesize all in my mind with how many other things to remember and keep it aware, but I do glean when that will be so. I do aspire and hope it won&apos;t be ages.

Rising at 3:00 this morning to read some about the Monastery in Escondido and printing directions, I looked at the Bulletin Board announcement again and, much to my dismay, I read that the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy was celebrated Saturday, yesterday....So much for paying attention, my excuse my Mind being set on Holy Liturgy - Sunday. I so looked forward to the Event and spending a day on these beautiful Monastery Grounds located in a meadow, now I feel let down and annoyed with myself, very annoyed. Nevertheless, I will visit there in a coming Sunday.

Meanwhile I read&quot;Partakers of God&quot;. I don&apos;t know if Readers of this thread take the time to read through the links or just read the pages, I&apos;m never quiet sure if my excerpts are superfluous, howbeit I will carry on to better remember these Gem&apos;s with the writing.

The Good Reversal

&quot;We observe a reverse movement here. I must suffer the good reversal, says Gregory the Theologian. After finishing the steps of the whole poetical strophe, the dancers of classical antiquity danced an antistrophe, that is a reverse strophe. For someone seperated from God, however, a good reversal is not simple a return, but a reverse course to God. The Archetype was strangely adapted to the antitype as we saw, after the normal movement had not succeeded; a new change is realized with the antitype&apos;s return to the Archetype.

&quot;In this state, man follows the course of the God - man. The first phase here consists in deliverance from the fetters of time and space, of unshaped nature.&quot;

Those who have followed this thread will remember that&quot;Time/Space and the laws of physics are there to protect us from our own worst intentions.&quot;Were it not so, would have arrogated to ourselves the distruction of the Universe.

&quot;In the effort to develope a free personality, the power of both categories is in some way abolished, and man is released from the spatiotemperal complex of creatureliness. Christ broke and abolished abolished this complex by introducing the eternal into the sphere of the world. Deliverance from the world is one of the most basic motives for spiritual life.

To break from the world and be united with God;

gaining the things above by means of the things below,

and acquiring through goods which are unstable and

pass away, those that are stable and abide.

&quot;There is no doubt that, from one point of view, this step involves mortification. However, in this case, mortification has a positive character; for it is combined with life by being united with God, because renunciation is accomplished through communion with God. The Apostle Paul has presented this state with different words but with the same meaning: It is no longer O who live, but Christ who lives in me. He feels within himself the power and experience of a new life gained by his participation in the true life which does not end with death. Thus, this mortification is nothing more than a presupposition which opens the way to life.

&quot;As we have already seen, after the dissolution of Christ&apos;s human components, the body and the soul, his divinity affected their reunion through his Resurrection. The reunion is now final, and Christ&apos;s human nature keeps its components forever united. From now on, this event is repeated in each person; the seperation of his personality is removed. Yet, as was stated in the second lecture, this removal of obstacles is a preliminary act. Frankly, the actual elements are too intensive and high for a simple liberation. One does not simply cease to be a sinner or a slave; one becomes Godlike, as we will see later at some point in this presentation.

&quot;I have already spoken about the struggle that transforms nature into person. The Christian spiritual life is personal, as is the life of the Holy Trinity. To use the impressive words of Maximos the Confessor, God and man are examples of each other. God seizes the mind of man and takes it to the unknown, so much as man manifests the invisible God through his virtues. God, out of love for man, becomes so much incarnate as man, out of his love for God becomes endivinized. The phrase so much...as, which appeared early in Gregory the Theologian, became in Maximos a regular method of expression which shows the close parallel between the two courses.

&quot;There are two persons here: Christ, who transmits grace, and man, who receives grace; and, conversely, there is man (indeed, every man) who transmits humanity to Christ, and Christ who receives humanity. By receiving human nature Christ enters creation and man, after his nature is united with the divine nature in Christ enters the uncreated. If the Logos has brought the mystical act of the Incarnation to a successful end by becoming like us, in all ways except sin, then he will also fulfill the mystical act of man&apos;s theosis by making man like himself in all ways except the divine essence, Christ will raise him above the heavens. By imitating Christ, man will also become god through the mystery of grace.

So we, too, according to his example, will ascend and

become gods through him, by the mystery of grace.&quot;

This last, utterly enlightening paragraph is&quot;a Morsel for a Monarch!&quot;You would agree?

So to Church I go to receive Divine Grace, if I may.

Have a great day!

Dear Charlotte,
I am sorry for you that you missed that opportunity! May you have many,many more and better!
Hope the rest of your Sunday went well. Ours was very good here. Fr. Michael gave a very good and helpful homily on Lazarus and the rich man. There&apos;s nothing wrong with being rich, necessarily. The problem begins when we start to love the things that money can buy more than we love God or our neighbor.

Then, after services, we had our first&quot;Sunday afternoon book club and tea party&quot;We are reading and discussing,&quot;Theosis- The True purpose of human life&quot;(Guess whose idea that was...) It was really good. Everyone seemed to really enjoy and get a lot out of it.

Be seeing you! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Nov 9, 2009, 9:52am

Yes, thank you, my Sunday was good.

&quot;The legitimacy of wealth is its dedication to the needs of Humanity&quot;
Manly Palmer Hall

We had the same reading of the rich and poor man. Faith also made her mark: Like Lazarus, the rich man died, the former in the Bosom of Abraham, the latter suffering in Hades, entreating Abraham to help him out of this hell, and Abraham answered that there is nothing He can do because there is&quot;a great gulf fixed&quot;between His Bosom and Hades. At least, then, help out my five brothers on earth so they don&apos;t suffer the same torment as I do, pleaded the rich man. Er, said Abraham,&quot;they have Moses and the prophets; let them hear&quot;, and since they don&apos;t hear Moses and the prophets, what makes you think&quot;they will be persuaded though one rise from the dead&quot;.

Twice in the last days I happened on this Chinese fortune cookie and hope the writer doesn&apos;t mind me repeating:&quot;Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings while the dawn is still dark&quot;, just like my bird here heralds in each day in darkness, singing not for food but to the Glory of his Creator.

The story of the French Fries

Father Ceko told: A Father and his Son sat at a fast food restaurant and the Father asked if he could have one of his Son&apos;s fries.&quot;No, they are mine&quot;, said the Son, unwilling to share. The Father thought that maybe his Son doesn&apos;t know where the fries come from, or doesn&apos;t realize that he could either take the fries away from him,&quot;bury him in more fries&quot;, could get his own fries and doesn&apos;t need his.

In Orthodoxy everything comes from God, but often we fail to remember this. We think we&apos;re in control of our possessions , though we oft say in jest or resignation,&quot;The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away&quot;, and God doesn&apos;t need us but we need Him.&quot;There is a reason why you are here&quot;, Father Ceko remarked, and my thoughts when I walked into the Church,&quot;I need to be here&quot;. In the beginning of every Vesper we are reminded how every creature on earth waits for the ripening of corn and fruit by God&apos;s energy in Nature, to sustain our physical body. Save the biological process, no one knows the subtle power by which the body changes food to energy.

History

Honered was the Holy Great Martyr and Wonder-worker St. Demetrius of Thessalonica, who openly opposed the Emperor Maximian by openly confessing and preaching the Lord Jesus Christ. When Maximian returned from a battle against the Sarmatians, he questioned St. Demetrius who affirmed His Christian Faith to the Emperor, was cast into prison and killed.&quot;Healing myrrh flowed from the body of the martyr of Christ, curing many of the sick, a small church was built over his relics.&quot;Remembering also that the Sarmatians were the noble Knights of Artorius Castos, and the legendary King Arthur.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Demetrius 

I enjoyed Saturday&apos;s Vesper anew and the Cathedral at Alhambra &apos;welcomed&apos; me. Learning about Orthodoxy is akin to reading a book over and again owing to the Writ&apos;s resonance, the letters don&apos;t change but the Nous increases in substance and quality, and the distance between Above and Below narrows, recognizably.

How have I made my heart a public inn,
That thy love&apos;s temple rightfully should be,
And every passing stranger lodged therein,
Spending my time in unknown company.

With thee, dear Reader.
Pardon me

In poetic mood

See then the boy in first encounter with beauty,
his native wonder awaken&apos;d by the motion of love;
as when live air, breathing upon a smother&apos;d fire,
shooteth the smouldering core with tiny flamesso he
kindleth at heart with eternal expectancies,
and the dream within him looketh out at his eyes.

&apos;Twas thru&apos; worship of Christ that these things came to men,
whereat, when art achieved portrayal of tenderness,
the christian painters throng&apos;d their heav&apos;n with cherubims,
little amorini, who with rebel innocence
dispossess&apos;d the tall angels; and Mary&apos;s young babe
cast-off his swadling bands, and stood-up on her lap
in grace of naked childhood for the image of God.

But as &apos;tis with the race, for which our hope draweth
the only assurance of its high nobility
from rare examples, holy men and wise, revered
ev&apos;n by the common folk, that none the less pursue
their common folly interminably, and more and more
pamper despair that is the giant sorrow of earth
so in the child this glimpse or touch of immanence,
being a superlativ brief moment of glory,
is too little to leaven the inveterate lump of life.

The Divine Poet
draweth hope and assurance of the high nobility of our race from holy men and wise....

We visited the Church dedicated to St. Demetrios in Thessalonica. His Relics, as pictured in your wikipedia link, are actually inside a small gazebo like structure, over on the left hand side, inside this huge basillica-style Greek church there. We walked into the Church and over towards his relics, where a number of pilgrims were going up to and saying prayers. As we got within 30 feet, the fragrance of myhrr was so strong and the feeling of the presence of God was such that my heart was inflamed with such sweetness and unconditional love for me, that I ended up just sitting in a chair nearby for about a half an hour while my wife and children wandered around looking at all the Icons and everything else in there. In the midst of this experience I saw, so clearly, not only all of the many flaws in my own character and the perennial passions that I habitually succumb to, but the great dignity, as well, that God has called us to as human beings; a great dignity that seemed attainable, even to me, with the help that God was so freely offering. And then you walk back out into the street, into the hustle and bustle of a big city where everyone is trying to get what the rich man in the Gospel had, and you just marvel that these two realities can be right here next to each other in the same place!

Here is a Saint who&quot;Died&quot;in 306, whose consciousness and prayers and blessings for us are still clearly present with us,( as they all are.) The&quot;Other world&quot;is a lot closer than we think, hidden from us only by our lack of perception and a habit of focusing our attention on only that which is right in front of our nose!

Here is another of the great things about Orthodoxy, you and I were separated by hundreds of miles, and yet, we were in the same Church service together with the same Gospel reading, the same Saints being commemorated for that day and this would be the case in any Orthodox Church you happened to be in, anywhere throughout the world. There&apos;s something about that consistency and the continuity of the Church which is both, refreshing and encouraging.

Have a great day! Whatever circumstances we find ourselves in are the opportunity God has given us to learn how to respond appropriately and to choose the good,the true and the beautiful. Each right choice we make is a small step towards Theosis and the Kingdom of Heaven. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Nov 10, 2009, 10:27am

In this, you having visited sacred lands and places, and some more, I feel a sort of pleasing envy, and Pure Love for oneself is divine. I once laughed overjoyed with a realization that I loved my own laughter. Remembering also, after sitting in the corner behind the sargophagus in the Kings Chamber for a while with my thoughts, then walking out of the GP and the world seemed as if unreal. The same I experience when leaving the Church and driving home, wondering where everyone is speeding to. BTW, the last street before I turn into the parking lot of the Church is Casuda, for whatever it&apos;s worth.

Concerning the Church of St. Demetrius, in last Sunday&apos;s Bulletin Boards is written:

&quot;An Illyrian nobleman, Leontius, was afflicted with an incurable illness. He hastened, with prayer, to the relics of St. Demetrius and was completely healed. In thanksgiving, Leontius erected a much larger church on the site than the old church. The Saint appeared to him on two occasions. When Emperor Justinian wanted to translate the relics of the saint from Thessalonica to Constantinople, flaming sparks sprang from the tomb and a voice was heard:&quot;Stop, and do not touch!&quot;And thus, the relics of St. Demetrius have remained for all time in Thessalonica. As a protector of Thessalonica, St. Demetrius has appeared many times, and on many occasions has saved Thessalonica from great calamity. His miracles are without number.&quot;

Reminds one of Saint Spyridon who thusly protects Corfu and its people, and Churches, Temples, and Chapels built in thanksgiving the world over where miracles occurred, including where I grew up. &apos;Concrete&apos; evidence, or cocreate.


More of the powers of Transformation

&quot;Three factors underlie man&apos;s transformation: God, nature and the world. If man&apos;s nature, which lies between the other two factors, prevails upon his will, it makes him remain in his status, stagent. The other factors attract man to their own side and challenge him to change - either one can make man become by status what it is by nature, namely, either god ot an inanimate object. The transformation is not automatic; for on one hand, these factors are only motives confronting man&apos;s will, and on the other hand, divine grace is not forced upon the human will. Therefore, the faculty that plays the main role in the formation of man&apos;s life is self-determination, which cost mankind so much the day the first man used it so unwisely.&quot;

And now I faces the hussle and bussle, which these morning studies, prayer, and good things in my life give me the energy and ease for.

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Nov 11, 2009, 10:34am

&quot;There is a power within God, an eternal companion of the divine nature, which brings him to an opening, transmission, communion; which brings him to the world. It is the enery, which dogmatists call goodness and mystics call eros. The corresponding power is man&apos;s eros, which is directed to God. The two powers are closely connected to one another, although they belong to different worlds; the spirit unites them. As was seen at an earlier point in this discussion, Gregory Palamas, wishing to emphasize the particular energy of the Holy Spirit in the work of man&apos;s perfection, characterized the spirit as the eros of the divine mind directed to the Word (Reason), as the eros of the Father directed to the Son. He further stated that even man&apos;s spirit is the eros of his mind directed to his word, his reason. The conveyor of God&apos;s eros to man is the Holy Spirit, and the conveyor of man&apos;s eros to God is the human spirit.&quot;

I never quite understood who or what the Holy Spirit is, but explained as it is in all I read thus far by the most learned Writers of Orthodoxy, it is becoming increasingly clearer and at some such moment I can grasp it.

&quot;Eros is the mover of transmission and communion. It creates in both God and man ekstasis coming out of oneself, coming out of

the mystery and exclusiveness of God. The ecstasy of God leads to dialogue and union with man; the ecstacy of man leads to dialogue and union with God. Of course, the two movements are different; for, whereas God conde - scends, man a - scends.&quot;

What is true in the Greater is true in the lesser, we experience this ecstacy when a thing great happens in our lives, many times a surprise and we&quot;are beside ourselves&quot;with Joy. I love the reciprocal movement.

AAccording to Gregory of Nyssa, blessed eros is an impetus inserted within human nature and leading to the good blessings of divine love and divine councel. This is the impetus which moves all men toward God and, particularly, those who are devoted to him. Symeon the New Theologian dedicated his inspiring Hymns of Divine Eros to the experience produced by that power. Divine eros is ecstatic, not limited to its bearers. It does not allow lovers to belong to themselves, but delivers them to their beloved ones. Centuries earlier, Ignatios of Antioch, as a prisoner traveling to his martyrdom, expressed his longing for speedy union with Christ, and described the inner insatiable love of the faithful with such unrivaled lyrical expressions as these:

I am writing while still alive.

but I long for death.

My eros has been nailed to the cross,

and there is no fire of material love within me;

but the Living Water is in me

and says within me, Hasten to the Father.

Divine eros thrusts and leads to God as well as to one&apos;s fellow man.&quot;

Many times I read:

Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.

There is a wreath of Roses on the Cross of the Rosicrucians.

Can man unite with God?
Can he commune with Him?
Can he become a god by Grace?

 Moments of Divine Experience 

&quot;The experience of divine is felt individually in various phases, but not acquired exclusively in any individual context. The work of Christ has universal dimensions. All of creation (and especially man) participated in the manifestation of the mystery of the Incarnation and enjoyed its benefits. The new order is accomplished through the establishment of the community of Christ&apos;s friends, the Church. Divine life is acquired within this order through communal and individual effort.

&quot;As a rule, life is offered through the sacraments, in which the whole process of the Incarnation (nativity, death, resurrection, and Christ&apos;s entire life in general) is repeated symbolically and essentially. The sacraments, as the sphere par excellence of the work of the Holy Spirit, offer grace which transmit to man all that happened with the God - man. They offer grace in a mystical but effective way, bringing Christ to dwell in us and us to dwell in Christ.

&quot;Baptism brings about the death of the old mind and the birth of a new one. Since man possesses a body as well as a soul, he needs food for it. According to Gregory of Nyssa, this food is provided by the Holy Eucharist, in which the food for the body obviously refers to the spiritualizing of the body. This concept of the Holy Eucharist, which has its roots in Ignatios of Antioch&apos;s teaching on medicine of immortality, gave the foundation for the final formation of the teaching on the transubstantiation of life according to the amount of grace they impart.&quot;

To&quot;taste the fountain of immortality&quot;is chanted in hushed song during Holy Communion.

&quot;This cooperation of the psychic and physical elements, witnessed in the sacrament, becomes equally manifest in prayer too. Gregory Palamas, regarding even material things as God&apos;s gift, was not willing to accept the concept of the mind coming out of the body, as declared some philosophizing scholars of his time who followed Plato and the Neoplatonists. On the contrary, Palamas claimed that the mind entered the body. He called this entering a concentration, and introversion. Elevation is realized through intense mobilization of all man&apos;s faculties, both spiritual and physical, as an integrated personality.&quot;

These philosophizing scholars of Plato and the Neoplatonists either misinterpreted or misunderstood Plato and the Neoplatonists. Plato didn&apos;t teach that the mind comes out of the body, rather, the mind is flooded with Light at the moment of a Realization, and that the mind moves the brain and the brain the body.

&quot;The concentration of the mind in the innermost part of man and the absolute inner calm constitute the basic conditions for an effective sublime spiritual experience. Prayer contributes to the progress of the faithful in two ways: negatively, by strenghtening them in their struggle against the demonic energy; and positively, by offering them spiritual brightness through communion with God. The tears which were shed abundantly by the ancient ascetics while they prayed were an expression, not only of the consciousness of their smallness, but also of the delight they experienced from their ability to participate in the divine brightness.

&quot;In the writings of Dionysios the Areopagite, we often find the term ecstacy or concern about ecstacy. God dwells on the highest summit, - on the silent and impenetrable cloud which is simultaneously dark and supremely radiant. The transcendent mysteries of divinity are incomprehensible and unattainable. God is beyond essence and knowledge. In order to reach him, one must be released from the senses and the intellect to experience ecstacy that leads to the ray of the divine darkness.&quot;

This is true, can I say? In that state, such concepts as intellect, thought, senses, or any other notion whatsoever do not exist, nothing exists save Pure Consciousness which is, and in which is everything. Pure Consciousness pervades - one is part of it and the whole of it, yet beholding it as an individual.

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Nov 12, 2009, 12:15pm

This&quot;Pure consciousness&quot;is the Holy spirit, the spirit of wholeness and truth, which is everywhere present and fills all things, in the same way that a hologram works. When we are in communion with the Holy spirit in the depths of our heart, (Which is an organ of perception for invisible realities,) we can know all things because we are one with all things-Knowledge by identity, not merely by observation.

Our&quot;Likeness&quot;to God is achieved by a union with God, not by imitation. God became incarnate for our sake, not only to help us to achieve this union, but to provide for us a living example of what that would be like. Jesus is not only our Lord,God and Saviour, but the example of what an average, normal human being is like. Jesus does not represent something extraordinary, but simply what each of us was originally intended to be like. Once we begin to recognize the dignity of what it really means to be a human being, we can begin to strive for what is nothing more than our Divine Birthright. This, in turn, can give us the incentive we need to make the right choices, the choices recommended to us by the spirit of wholeness and truth within us in every moment.

The path which leads to the Kingdom of heaven is made up of each choice we are faced with every moment of each day.

We can&apos;t force ourselves to make the right choices and, even if we did, we would end up becoming hard, cold, unfeeling, unforgiving, unloved and unloving, achieving in the end, just the opposite of what we had hoped for. There are all too many examples of this type of person in American literature and in the media, the hard, cold, mean, bible-thumping patriarch, who tries to beat the truth into his children. A convenient icon for debunking Christianity.

The mechanisms conditioned into us at deep sub-conscious and unconscious levels which cause us to make the same self-destructive choices over and over again, are very difficult for us to bring to our conscious awareness, let alone, weed them out and become free of them. (Nothing a life-time of therapy won&apos;t cure...) It is precisely here, where a personal relationship with the living God comes to bear.

God wants nothing more than to help us get at the root causes of our less then helpful choices that we seem pre-programed to make and to free us from these conditioned predispositions.

When we are young, so much younger than today, we don&apos;t think we need anybodies help in any way. Then those days are gone and we&apos;re not so self-assured. Then we find, we&apos;ve changed our minds and we open up the door...

&apos;Tis a wonderful Revelation indeed, I never thought of the Holy Spirit as this ineffable consciousness, but saw it as the all inclusive conscious Universe, and the Holy Spirit striving with us as that still, small voice counceling us of what not to do. Would that I had a life-time therapy of how to always make the right choices.

&quot;Jesus is not only our Lord, God and Savior, but the example of what an average, normal human being is like&quot;. When walking into the Cathedral at Alhambra, one sees first above the Altar a painting an average, very beautiful young Lady with Her arms raised in Glory, and Christ as a boy saying,&quot;I AM THE WAY THE TRUTH ANd THE LIFE&quot;

Touching and true words spoken by Peter Sellers, I feel insecure many times, perfectly sure sometimes. On a lighter note, I remembered Inspector Clouseau, and thought of the episode when the Inspector walked into a Mom and Pop lodging in the Bavarian Alps, maybe Swiss. Standing at the counter waiting for the Host to check Reservations, a little dog jumped to and fro all agitated against Clouseau&apos;s leg, barking incessantly. Alarmed, He asked:

&quot;Does your Dg bite?&quot;

&quot;No&quot;, said the Almi, but the dog bit the Inspector in the leg.

&quot;Ouch, oh, you ssaid, your dg doesn&apos;t bite!&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s not my dog&quot;, the old man shrugged his shoulders.

Partakers of God

Gregory Palamas is oft quoted in the lectures of Patriarch Athenagoras, so the following may be of interest.

Saint Gregory Palamas, Archbishop of Thessalonica

&quot;Gregory&apos;s father was an eminent official at the court of Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus. The gifted Gregory, completing his secular studies, did not want to enter the service of the imperial court, but withdrew to the Holy Mountain and was tensured a monk. He lived a life of asceticism in the Monastery of Vatopedi and the Great Lavra.&quot;

 http://www.sacredsites.com/europe/greece/mount_athos.html 

Vatopedi, the third one on this Holy Mountain, very interesting paintings, and article.

Saint Gregory&quot;led the struggle against the heretic Barlaam and finally defeated him. He was concecrated Metropolitan of Thessalonica in the year 1347. He is glorified as an ascetic, a theologian, a hierarch and a miracle-worker. The most Holy Theotokos, St. John the Theologian, St. Demetrius, St. Anthony the Great, St. John Chrysostom and angels of God appeared to him at different times. He governed the Church of Thessalonica for thirteen years, of which he spent one year in slavery under the Saracens in Asia. He entered peacefully into rest in the year 1360, and took up his habitation in the Kingsom of Christ. His relics repose in Thessalonica, where a beautiful church is dedicated to him.&quot;

In my search I found this glorious photo of the Saint-Sophia Cathedral and Related Monastic Buildings, Kiev-Pechersk Lavra.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_Pechersk_Lavra 

And the New Jerusalem Monastery in Moscow, which the german army ransacked in 1941, blew up&quot;its unique grand belfry - the towers were demolished; the vaults of the cathedral collapsed and buried its famous iconostasis, among other valuables. In 1959, the museum was re-opened for the public, although the belltower has never been rebuilt, while the interior of the cathedral is still bare. The New Jerusalem Monastery resumed its service as a male monastery only in the 1990s.

&quot;In March 2009 Russian president Dmitry Medvedev signed a presidental decree on the retoration and renovation of the New Jerusalem Monastery. The federal government was instructed to subsidise the monastery restoration fund from the federal budget starting in 2009, with vice prime minister Victor Zubkov assuming it will cost about 13-20 billion roubles.&quot;

This is gives a glimpse into President Medvedev&apos;s Mind, and I apologize for the Germans wanton behavior, not easy at times being German with such history looming over our heads for generations.

And the world famous Saint Basil Cathedral on the Red Square in Moscow,&quot;built on the order of Ivan IV of Russia (1555-1561) - shaped as a flame of a bonfire rising into the sky, has no analogous in Russian architecture:&quot;It is like nother Russian building. Nothing similar can be found in the entire millenium of Byzantine tradition from the fifth to the fifteenth century... a strangeness that astonishes by its unexpectedness, complexity and dazzling interleaving of the manifold details of its design.&quot;

The text is from wiki but the link diddn&apos;t work, hope this one does

 http://www.sacred-destinations.com/russia/moscow-st-basil-cathedral.htm 

isn&apos;t it remarkable how many Saints came from Noble Families, and how many Kings and Rulers were deeply religious, having in common being raised as children in a religious milieu.

This is the Church I attend. I could not, on the website, find the painting of the Holy Theotokos I tried to describe yesterday.

 http://www.saintstevens.org/museum.htm 

Orthodoxy is alive and well, and&quot;everywhere&quot;once one looks, and in the main thought of as simply another Christian Religion.

Crowning! The Church at Kizhi, more distinctly flame shaped than St. Basil at the Red Square. The Eternal Flame.

I was so involved in Cathedrals and Monasteries that I forgot to write what I love:

&quot;St. Gregory Palamas learned much through heavenly revelations. After he has spent three years in stillness in a cell of the Great Lavra, it was necessary for him to go out among men and benefit them with his accumulated knowledge and experience. God revealed this necessity to him through an extraordinary vision: One day, as though in a light sleep, Gregory saw himself holding a vessel in his hand overflowing with milk. Gradually, the milk turned into wine which likewise spilled over the rim, and drenched his hands and garments. Then a radiant youth appeared and said:&quot;Why would you not give others of this wonderful drink that you are waisting so carelessly, or are you not aware that this is the gift of God&apos;s grace?&quot;To this Gregory replied:&quot;But if there is no one in our time who feels the need for such a drink, to whom shall I give it?&quot;Then the youth said:&quot;Whether there are some or whether there are none thirsty for such a drink, you are obligated to fulfill your dept and not neglect the gift of God.&quot;Gregory interpreted the milk as the common knowledge (of the masses) of moral life and conduct, and the wine as dogmatic teaching.

&quot;The second time Gregory secluded himself in a monastery he was writing his Principles of Orthodoxy.) On the eve of the Feast of St. Anthony the Great, the monks summoned him to the all-night vigil service, but he remained at his work in the cell while all the brethren went to church. St. Anthony suddenly appeared to him and said:&quot;Perfect stillness is good, but sometimes it is necessary to be with the brethren.&quot;Convinced by this revelation, Gregory immediately went into church to the joy of all the monks.&quot;

And from todays Prologue from Ohrid, yet another Emperor of the Orthodox Faith.

St. Justian, Emperor of Byzantium

&quot;Justinian was a Slav by birth, probably a Serb from the region of Skoplje. His Slavic name was Upravda, meaning&quot;truth, justice.&quot;He succeeded the throne of his uncle Justin in 527. The greatness of this emperor is inseparably bound to his fath in Orthodoxy; he believed, and lived according to his faith. During Great Lent, he neither ate bread nor drank wine but ate only vegetables and drank water, and that, just every other day. He waged war against the barbarians of the Danube because they castrated their captives. This reveals his elevated feeling of love for his fellow man. Justinian was fourtunate and successful both in wars and in his work. He built many great and beautiful churches, the most beautiful which was Hagia Sophia [the Church of the Divine Wisdom] in Constantinople. He collected [and revised] and published the Laws of Rome and also personally issued many strict laws against immorality and licentiousness. He composed the Church hymn&quot;Only-begotten Son and Word of God,&quot;which has been sung during the Divine Liturgy since the year 536. He convened the Fifth Ecumenical Council (553). He died peacefully at the age of eighty, and took up his abode in the Kingdom of the Heavenly King.&quot;

This morning, I lingered awhile at Haga Sophia in Istanbul where is the oldest surviving and beautiful mosaic of the&quot;Virgin and Child&quot;, dating from the second half of the 9th century, during the reign of Emperor Michael III (842-867) or Basil I (867-886).

Years ago, when I traveled many times to Egypt and Greece to find what I was looking for, I had a vivid dream about standing inside an airport and not to be missed, read on a large band, written in large letters,&quot;If all else fails go to Istanbul&quot;. Had I only known....

I also spent time wandering Mt. Athos and to my delight found the painting in an Athonite Monastery, shown in the link, of the arrayed, pyramidal&quot;All Seing Eye&quot;, the Cap Stone on the Dollar Bill. I was only surprised for a moment. This History I know parts of and love is marvelous.

of dedication, and even in thatt earliest onset,
when yet infant Desire hath neither goal nor clue
to fix the dream, ev&apos;n then, altho&apos; it graspeth nought
and passeth in its airy vision away, and dieth
out of remembrance, &apos;tis in its earnest of life
and dawn of bliss purer and hath less of earthly tinge
than any other after-attainment of the understanding;
for all man&apos;s knowledge kenneth also of toil and flaw,
and even his noblest works, tho&apos; they illumine the dark
with individual consummation, are cast upon
by the irrelevant black shadow of time and fate.

Hence is the fascination of amateurs in art,
who renouncing accomlishment attain the prize
of their humbler devotion,as Augustin saith,
that fools may come at holiness where wise men miss,
 Facit enim hoc quaedam etiam stoliditas, 
arriving by short-coming, like the homely birds
of passage, nesting on the roofs of the workshops.
And tho&apos; of secret knowledge man&apos;s art is compact,
yet not the loving study of any master-work,
nor longest familiarity can ever efface
its birthday of surprisal; and great music to me
is glorify&apos;d by memory of one timeless hour
when all thought fled scared from me in my bewilderment.

Hoping that everyone had a good weekend, here in greater LA we have a great Autumn, 81F=27C, much to my sisters envy, visibility 20 miles, a gorgeous view of the San Gabriel Mountains while driving to Alhambra. In the winter they are snow-caped at times and when looking from the Hill, the higher San Bernadino Mountains are also in the Panorama.

By Grace we are saved, not by our good works, St. Paul:

&quot;Brethren, God who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not works, lest anyone shoul boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.&quot;

Commentary

&quot;One can get from the lesser kingdom to God&apos;s Kingdom by the unity of grace, faith, and works. Not that these are equal, for grace is uncreated and infinite, whereas our faith is limited and can grow, good works flow out of authentic faith. Works cannot earn us this great treasureit is a pure giftbut those who receive this gift do good. We are not saved by good works, but for good works.&quot;

At some point during the Holy Liturgy the doors are closed and the feeling of Community is palpable.&quot;When there are two or more gathered in my name....&quot;And Father Ceko proclaims&quot;Christ is among us&quot;, and we pray as One in that Holy Spirit Spirit of which we have been made aware of a few days ago.

Father Ceko informed us that the Serbian Patriarch Pavle died in Belgrade at the age of 95, Blessings upon Him.&quot;In the 1990s, Pavle said - according to Serbian State television:&quot;It is our oath not to make a single child cry or sadden a single old women because they are of another religion or nation&quot;.

The reading was from the Holy Gospel of St. Luke, of a demon possessed man&quot;who wore no clothes, nor did he live in a house but in the tombs&quot;. His name was&quot;Legion&quot;- because many demon&apos;s had entered him&quot;. Jesus cast out the demons and the man set&quot;clothed and in his right mind&quot;at the feet of Jesus and asked to be with Him, but Jesus said,&quot;Return to your own house, and tell what great things God has done for you&quot;.

This Father Aquaro at Saint Matthew pointed out to me in the Words written above the door when leaving the Church:

 Go ye therefore and teach all Nations,
Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Teaching them all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, Even to the End of the world. 

The Imperial Russian Orthod Church with grounds, and a good history of events and persons involved.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church 

Expansion

&quot;In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the Russian Orthodox Church experienced phenomenal geographic expansion. In the following two centuries, missionary efforts streched out across Siberia and Alaska, then into the United States at California. Eminent people on that missionary effort included St. Innocent of Irkutsk and St. Herman of Alaska. In emulation of Stefen of Perm, they learned local language and translated the gospels and the hymns. Sometimes those translations required the invention of new systems of transcription.&quot;

Ivan the Terrible is also mentioned.

So here we are in California in the Bosom of Mother Russia.

Greetings to All!

St.Stefen,(Or Stephan, or Steven, as the case may be,) of Perm, Is who I was named after when I was Baptized.

 http://www.roca.org/OA/80/80h.htm 

And this particular Gospel reading was one I heard, many years ago when I was living in S.F. and was very fed up with life in general and had been praying,&quot;Lord,take me with you!&quot;like the demon possessed man. To which I heard the answer,&quot;No. You stay here and tell everyone what great things I have done for you!&quot;So, here I am!

The Epistle reading you quoted for this Sunday, is one I am looking at closely right now to try and determine what our role is in the cooperation between Grace and Free-will, which makes a genuine spiritual life possible. We are saved by Grace but Grace can do nothing for us unless we want it to, ask for it, freely accept it and not act in such a manner that contradicts or undoes the work of Grace in us. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Nov 17, 2009, 10:27am

Thank you for the interesting link, Steven. My favorite subject in school was geography, and there were places I was particularly drawn to, one such were the Ural Mountains. I am glad you stayed and are here to tell us of things we never heard before.

I don&apos;t see how anyone, even a non-believer would not fully appreciate, love, be thankful and accept God&apos;s Grace when he feels it, but then, busy in daily life we forget, but even then there are instances to experience Grace, the way I see it anyway, when but by the Grace of God we are gifted something we need exactly at that moment. It is not a lesser Gift but as in a hologram is inclusive of the greater. I know what you mean though by&quot;cooperation between Grace and Free-will&quot;to live a spiritual life.

As a Gift, Divine Grace is said to be&quot;unmerited favor&quot;by which we are granted salvation.&quot;The Eastern Orthodox Church, as expressed in the teachings of John Cassian, holds that though grace is required for men to save themselves at the beginning; that there is no such thing as total depravity, but there remains a moral or noetic ability within men that is unaffected by original sin, and that men must work together (synergism) with divine grace to be saved.&quot;

&quot;....in the Church, we enjoy the Grace of Theosis not only with our psyche, but also with our body, because of the temple of the Holy Spirit who dwells in it, and shares its struggles with the psyche, the body is surely glorified.

The Grace springing from the holy Lord - the God-Man Christis poured out into our Panagia, into the Saints, and it also comes to those of us who are humble.&quot;

I think of the Grace of God coming to our body in every day life as described above, as the unmistakable wonderful feeling one experiences with or via the psyche.

Lumen De Lumine

Partakers of God - From Glory to Glory

Gregory Palamas:

&quot;Having come wholly out of himsef and being wholly

delivered to God, he sees the glory of God and con-

templates the divine light which is not an object of

the senses as such, but a graceful and holy spectacle

of immaculate souls and intellects. Without this

spectacle, not even the mind can see, in spite of its

having a spiritual sense, when it is united with things

above itself, as the bodily eye cannot see without the

perceptable light.

&quot;There is no seperation here of the mind from the body, but a departure of the whole man from himself, that is, from his created state. Delivered to God as a whole in this way - as a personal whole in his psychosomatic composition -man beholds the glory of God and contemplates the divine light. This is not a tangible sight, but a graceful and holy sight of immaculate minds. Yet, it is also a real light, without which the mind cannot see, just as the bodily eye cannot see without sensible light. According to this view, ecstacy occurs through transending the human faculties and proceeds parallel to the divine condescension. Ecstacy is not a passion, as in the worldly forms (opiomania and choromania, for example) or an absorbtion of the human personality by the absolute Being, as claimed by pantheistic systems. It is an energy through which personhood is completely freed from the powers of created nature so it can penetrate the highest spiritual reality.

&quot;The instrument through which man perceives and experiences spiritual realities is his spiritual faculty, which we mentioned earlier.&quot;

To my mind, this&quot;spiritual faculty&quot;relates to the teaching of John Cassian, in yesterday&apos;s post,&quot;that there is no such thing as total depravety, but there remains a moral or noetic ability within in man that is unaffected by original sin.&quot;Maybe this is what Don means by&quot;Divine Spark&quot;.

This spiritual faculty&quot;is not indentified with the pentamerious bodily senses, although both kinds will be united into one indivisible sense in the stage of perfection, as they were before the Fall. Tasting the good in a complete disposition within the psychomatic integration and personality will then be possible. This instrument also is not identified with the mind, even though it is connected with its movement. The expression of Diadochos of Photike in every sense and assurance, which frequently occurs in his Chapters and is related to a similar expression of Apostle Paul, means something more than understanding and, also, being certain of the work of the Holy Spirit in man. The spiritual faculty is that with which man grasps divine grace (otherwise hidden) as it works within him and becomes his possession - the faculty with which man experiences the divine brightness. It is put in motion when the mind is transformed, elevated above creation. One might say along with Gregory Palamas that this faculty is light itself, because the mind, as it is seized by the divine light and enters it, becomes itself light. Therefore, in reality, the light is that which sees the light. Consequently, in the course of its ascension, the mind is transformed into a spiritual faculty, and this faculty is, in turn, transformed into divine light.&quot;

Theosis

The&quot;greatest expression of Divine Grace available to men, which, according to the holy Fathers, is the vision of the uncreated light of God. Those who are very advanced in Theosis see this light, very few in each generation.&quot;Even when knowing nothing of these teachings, I venture to say that every person on this Planet, totally frustrated, stunned and stung by some event in daily life, at one time or another, stops to think, or thinks out loud,&quot;There must be more to life than this!&quot;

Theosis

&quot;All of this, of course, does not come about immediately. Throughout the whole of our life the Orthodox Christian must struggle, so that, slowly-slowly within the Church, with the Grace of God, with humility, repentance, prayer, and the holy Mysteries, he may be sanctified and deified.

&quot;This, however, is the purpose of our lives; the great aim. It is not so important exactly how far we progress. Our struggle itself, which God blesses abundantly, has value both in the present age and in the age to come.&quot;

Kind words of encouragement.

Charlotte

PS, for Don I know I wrote this before....

This spiritual faculty, which&quot;is not identified with the pentamerious bodily senses, although both kinds will be united into one indivisible sense in the stage of perfection, as they were before the Fall&quot;, is akin to Pharaoh communing in silence with himself uniting Upper and Lower Egypt, crowning himself with the Double Crown, celebrated his&quot;Renewal Festival&quot;, and as the Perfected Man became absolute Ruler over his Kingdom. During this silent communion also, a women&apos;s voice answered, we must be included somewhere along the way, Man&apos;s perfection as he was before the Fall, by necessity must be fourfold, upper and lower nature, and man and women. The Orthodox Church recognizes two paths to Sanctity, marriage and monastecism. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Post by charlotte on Nov 19, 2009, 1:21pm

One can only write what one understands, otherwise the discerning Reader will find gaps everywhere and put the book down, and Fern used repeat,&quot;A Creator can only create what He knows and is made of, His Ebenbild, literally, equal or same Picture. Obviously, the Saints saw and understood, and not only felt, I think, but were told to share the Good News with Humanity, even as we are compelled to share some such great event in our lives. Fern used to say,&quot;you get so fired up that you can&apos;t keep still&quot;, pertaining to things that can be said.

Simply, logically yet eloquently explained in Orthodox Writings is the purpose of our lives: to regain our Likeness to God,&quot;ye are gods&quot;. Even though I haven&apos;t been to Church in decades, I never thought I lived through a life without rhyme and reason only to die. What for? What for the Mind, Brain, Body, the Rose or the Cosmos? Frequently I hear people say,&quot;oh well, in the greater scheme of things it doesn&apos;t matter, it&apos;s all over in a few years anyway&quot;. Yet 99% of the people I know who say this pray and go to Church.

Anyhow, more Light.

&quot;The faculty (the transformed mind into a spiritual faculty, my note) progresses until enjoying the presence of God. One of the stages of the pleasure of tasting God, of which an essential symbol and real pledge is tasting the bread and wine of the Holy Eucharist. That which the soul tastes is the goodness, consolation and sweetness of God, as described by Diodochos: In the beginning of a prayer, the Holy Spirit offers the soul a taste of God in every sense and assurance. And that which is offered in the beginning continues to be offered forever, for the spiritual faculty is never satisfied. Spiritual pleasure in God is something which is simultaneously possessed and always sought for.&quot;

Why else would people who resign themselves to it being all over in a few years anyway, pray or go to Church?

&quot;If tasting God is already communion and association with him, then seeing him is another intense stage of enjoying him. As we have already noted, like sees like. Therefore, if a person wants to see something, he must be or become like it or he must have within him the capability for resemblance.&quot;

A few month ago, my Mother in her Wisdom said exactly what is noted here to me and I loved her with a smile.

&quot;Possessed by an insatiable thirst and inflamed by the divine eros, Moses entered the divine cloud. One day he received from God the command to stand on a rock and see, and he saw. However, what he saw was not God, but the backside of God, and Moses wished to see him better; because the vision of God has this characteristic - it never satisfies the desire of the person who gazes at him above. As a rule, the Christian sees God better than Moses did, because the Christian possesses the gift of the Holy Spirit in greater abundance and, as he continues to advance, sees him better each time. Even Moses himself beheld the divine light better when he was in Christ and became partaker of the Transfiguration.

&quot;The divine light is the energy through which God is manifested in fascinating and magnificent brilliance. The one who gazes at it for the first time will become dizzy, just like the three leading disciples on Mount Tabor during the Transfiguration of our Savior, and just like Paul on the road to Damascus. During the Transfiguration, Peter was so fascinated and overwhelmed by such bliss, that he wished to enjoy it forever. Lord, it is good that we are here, Peter cried. The greatest feast of Orthodoxy is called by the Greek Orthodox, Bright Feast, and on that day everything is radiant and bright. The hymnologist of the Resurrection chanted:

Now all things have been filled with light.

heaven and earth and the underworld.

Upon ascending the ladder of spiritual perfection, the one who beholds the light not only experiences the divine light, but also becomes like it, he himself becomes light. What we saw earlier, where Gregory Palamas pointed to the transformation of the spiritual faculty into light, was well expressed many centuries earlier by Diadochos of Photike:

When the mind begins to be operated by the divine

light, it becomes completely resplendent, so that it sees

its own light plentifully.

The energy of the divine light makes the mind resplendent and transparent so that the mind can see its own light. Through the vision of God, man enters the realm of the uncreated light; he acquires the light within himself, he acquires God himself.&quot;

Exceedingly Beautiful, this.

The Divine Pymander of Hermes

&quot;And I saw an infinite sight,all things were become light, both sweet and exceeding pleasant; and I was wonderfully delighted in the beholding it.&quot;

I am wonderfully delighted in knowing of it, and anticipation.

Repeating Steven&apos;s words concerning the Holy Spirit:

&quot;This &apos;Pure consciousness (I tried to describe, page 35, post 518)) is the Holy spirit, the spirit of wholeness and truth, which is everywhere present and fills all things, in the same way a hologram works. When we are in communion with the Holy Spirit in the depths of our heart, (Which is an organ of perception for invisible realities,) we can know all things because we are one with all things-Knowledge by identity, not merely by observation.&quot;

Thank you for the invitation to the great Celebration you have been waiting for some time. I didn&apos;t realize that Redding is 230 miles north of San Francisco, near Maunt Shasta even.

I&apos;d have to fly to San Francisco and rent a car, 4.5 hours drive it says. I doubt I will make it, though aside from attending the Festivities, it would be very interesting to see the Monastery you linked to in the beginning, in person, and nice to meet you and your family. I printed the information, and maybe I&apos;ll have a spontaneous moment if not tied down by work.

So far my thoughts at the moment.

 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Nov 20, 2009, 2:02pm

I&apos;m in the habit of highlighting words or paragraphs in books, and then I have a few books in which I began to highlight but stopped because I liked all I read so much as to highlight all.

This I trayed to do with Theosis (pdf), the Celestial Hierarchy of Dionysius the Areopagite, Orthodox Psychotherapy, and these lectures, Partakers of God, from which I&apos;m currently quoting, but can&apos;t isolate a particular paragraph for I like it all and learning.

Partaking of God

&quot;For those who understand ethics in its scholastic form as a system of regulations divided into chapters, perhaps the impression has been made that an important element for spiritual perfection, virtue, is missing from this discussion. Mystical theology, however, does not know any distiction between word and ethos. When Ignatios of Antioch spoke about homoetheia to God, he was referring to that state in which the faithful person possesses, simultaneously, both the ethos and the grace of God, virtue and light, which cannot be seperated in God. All of man&apos;s efforts, which begin with his self-determination and proceed (with the gift of the Spirit) to reach the highest spiritual experience, are inextricably connected with virtue. The acquisition of both perfect virtue and divinity are one thing, as Gregory of Nyssa declared.

&quot;The ultimate destiny of man is Theosis. Immortality and incorruption, the substructure upon which this good is built, is a preliminary state. Even the linguistic form of these words - (in Greek) - formed with the privative alpha, reveals their neutral meaning which is better understood when it is considered that demons are also immortal. Consequently, the change to immortality doesn&apos;t necessarily lead to a better state of existence and is not the good par excellence to be pursued, although it is certainly a good. It is a means to communion with the divine nature, as stated by the Apostle Peter: ...that through these you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of passion, and become partakers of the divine nature.

&quot;Change is essentially through the progressive assimilation to the Archetype which is completed in the partaking of divine life. The fundamental difference in the search for spiritual life between East and West is that the former seeks participation in the divine, the latter contemplation of the divine. In the East, taste and vision of God are a type of participation which is the beginning of Theosis; for the participant is transformed into that which it partakes of: the participant is transformed into the nature of that which it participates in. Here, too, then, the participant (man) becomes what God is - he becomes that which he is.

&quot;Of course, what they partake of cannot be the essence of God - but his energies. Gregory Palamas never ceased to emphasize this point. However, these energies (i.e., divinity, goodness, grace, light, and others) are not simply divine, but are uncreated. Moreover, they are not merely attributes, but essential properties. Consequently their partakers are brought into the sphere of the uncreated and can be considered and even called gods.

&quot;And those who have shaped their personhood to the point of perfection and are united with God&apos;s uncreated energies have escaped the limitations of creatureliness. Their energy, when it reaches the highest point of creativity, meets and becomes like the divine energy. They are then released from wordly limitations of time and space. They attain eternity, becoming eternal like God, according to the teachings of Maximos the Confessor. Beginning and end are conditions of the world and created things. Therefore, all those who transend the limitations of creatureliness are beyond these conditions; for they have entered the realm of infinity.&quot;

In worldly words, it cannot be set forth any clearer to make understanding accessable to any mind, or more beautifully true, and hath been said from the beginning of this thread.

At the end of the day, and when all is said and done, there is not one person in this world whose greatest hope is not to be Immortal, methinks.

Thank you, Don, I will be watching. I had a confusing dream about it last night, then in another, clearer segment, I dreamed walking with a man telling him that there is an unusual great storm causing great waves in the Atlantic, but he didn&apos;t believe me. We emerged sort of between mountains on either side and there was the Ocean and a range of snow-capped mountains in the background. Seperate from the range to the right a mountain with an atypical snow cap caught my attention. Many people mingled watching the enormous waves.&quot;See, I told you&quot;, I said, but he didn&apos;t answer, and we kept walking silently on a road of evenly layed stones of which the wall down to the ocean was also made of perfect craftmanship. I looked at the waves and felt very safe because the road was more than high enough for the waves to reach us. We kept walking toward that lone mountain but I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.

Thank you, as well, Steven, for the enlightening Images.

Infinite Progress

&quot;The translation to eternity is an occurrence independent of the eschatological event, because it belong to the realm of spiritual energy which is manifested independent of time and timeless conditions. It is not essentially physical death which lies beyond the present life, but the release from death - freedom from corruption - and partaking of the divine. These blessings will not be man&apos;s possession in the hereafter if he does not acquire them in his present life. Therefore, time and space can be abolished at any moment of a man&apos;s life, and even on earth, if they are transended through virtue and spirit. A person can transcend the chasm between him and God even when he is in this world of change and corruption, that is, within the flesh, provided that he transcends the flesh and the world by his self-determination.

&quot;However, this life par excellence certainly belongs to the future state of existence. The life in Christ is rooted in time, but is perfected in the future, stated Nicholas Kabasilas. And the experience of this life is naturally greater in the future after the third birth is realized, the birth of the general resurrection. All things that hace occurred contribute to the ultimate goal that all men be translated to heaven and become heirs of the kingdom and the life to come. Nothing is as delightful as being likened to the spectacle revealed during the majestic delivery of the inheritance: a chorus of blissful persons, a multitude of joyous people, Christ descending to earth radiant, the earth raising other suns toward the Sun of Righteousness - all filled with light.&quot;

Makes me think that such words could not be spoken with complete surety if not composed by experience, just as we can speak with confidence of what we know to be so by experience and no counter argument could convince us otherwise, to repeat myself, but it be longs.

&quot;Participation in the divine energies, which lead man to theosis, effects man&apos;s perfection. Perfection, however, is not a static state, for, on the one hand, God&apos;s infinity cannot be completely grasped and, on the other hand, man continuously runs to seize more blessings on a course which is endless.&quot;

Reminds me of my Phi-Teacher:&quot;What? You want more! You always want more! But He was decrying earthly goods.

&quot;John Sinaites exhorted:

Ascend, ascend eagerly,

undertake more ascensions.

Gregory of Nyssa had earlier indicated that he recognized only one limitation in perfection, that it has no limit. When we climb the ladder of spiritual progess, we will never be able to stop ascending; for there is always a step above the step we occupy and there is no summit. We will march toward the infinite forever. Man continuously becomes more spiritual and his spiritual food continuously increased, without his growth ending. Participation in the divine goodness is such that he who enjoys it becomes stronger and more receptive:

Such are the wonders that the participation in the

divine blessings works: it makes him, into whom

they come, larger and more receptive; from his

capacity it gets for the receiver an actual increase

in bulk as well, and he never stops growing.

The divine road is bright, but endless, and the fountain of blessings is exhaustible.&quot;(Inexhaustible?)

These inspiring and informative lectures remind me of some at the PRS, especially by Mr. Hall, when at the end no one got up to leave because we wanted to hear more. Fortunately, neither do I see an end to Orthodox Literature, not to mention all the recommended books to keep on the bright side of Life, so, again, thank you, Steven, for the link. I have also found the 30 steps on&quot;The Ladder of Divine Ascent&quot;.

A great weekend to All!

If you could hear the beautiful singing repeated three times

Through the prayer of the Theotokos
Oh Savior save us
To thee we sing Alleluia

it would move you to tears, maybe. It does me, I sang it on the freeway home for a while, and it is still singing in my head despite noise from other cars, food shopping, and writing about Egypt. So if we consider the Church a Hospital, I received strong medecine because it&apos;s still working. I love and by now partake somewhat in the process which I can&apos;t really describe.

Thanksgiving, the Detroit Lions, Tradition, Moses, and Transformation.

Reading from the Gospel of Saint Luke!

&quot;At that time, a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, fell down at jesus&apos; feet and begged Him to come to his house, for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as He went, the multitude thronged Him. Now a women, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by any, came from behind and touched the border of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped. And Jesus said,&quot;Who touched Me?&quot;When all denied it, Peter and those with him said,&quot;Master, the multitudes throng and press You, and You say,&quot;Who touched Me?&quot;But Jesus said,&quot;Somebody touched Me, for I perceived power going out from Me.&quot;Now when the women saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately. And He said to her,&quot;Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you well. Go in peace.&quot;While He was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue&apos;s house, saying to Him,&quot;Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the Teacher.&quot;But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying,&quot;Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be made well.&quot;When He came into the house, He permitted no one to go in except Peter, James and John and the father and mother of the girl. Now all wept and mourned for her, but He said,&quot;Do not weep, she is not dead, but sleeping. And they ridiculed Him, knowing that she was dead. But He put them all outside, took her by the hand and called, saying,&quot;Little girl, arise.&quot;Then her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that she be given something to eat. And her parents were astonished, but He charged them to tell no one what had happened.&quot;

First Fr Norman, I love Him, said that of course we give thanks for all we have on this&quot;Thanksgiving Day&quot;, it is a tradition. The Detroit Lions play every Thanksgiving Day even though the have the lousiest record in the NFL since 1999, I think, and last year they were 0 - 17, yet they still play because it is a tradition. The women who had a flow of blood for twelve years and spent all her money on physicians, because that is how it was done then, (And still so) and the daughter - of a ruler of the synagogue, were the same age, the former was healed by her faith in the new commandment, so was the girl raised from the dead by the New Testament of Christ. There was a transformation from the old Testament.

Moses and the twelve Tribes of Israel ?, I forgot what &apos;twelve&apos; exactly, and Law of Moses is also a tradition, but Christ released us from the obligation of the Law of Moses, because He has fulfilled it. Christ&quot;has broken down the middle wall of seperation&quot;between Jews and Gentile,&quot;having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create for Himself a new man from the two, thus making peace, and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmety. And he came and preached peace to you who were afar off and those who were near. For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father. Now, therefore, you are no longer a stranger and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, having been built on the foundation of the Apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.&quot;

The Law of Moses having been fulfilled&quot;heals humanity on a twofold level:

1) It erases the seperation between human beings; and
2) It erases the seperation between humans and God.&quot;

As it states in the Bible:

&quot;A new commandment I give onto thee, that ye love one another as I have loved you.&quot;

The commentary:

&quot;Now we are only obligated to love one another, to fulfill the New Law of Christ. This love is sacrificial in nature, just as Christ&apos;s love is sacrificial and selfless toward us. Because of His efforts we become fellow citizens and members of the household of God, built together into a Holy, Living, and United Temple of God.

&quot;There is neither Jew nor Greek, nor male nor female...there are only human beings made in the image and likeness of God.&quot;

And that brings us back to the beginning of this thread. Fr Norman then addressed us concerning our personal transformation:&quot;It&apos;s all about transfomation&quot;, or ascend, ascend eagerly, undertake more ascention.

I hope I conveyed just some of it coherently, and now I have dietary concerns.

The Exodus, Passover, is another transformation en mass. No evidence of the Children of Israel crossing the desert has been found. 7 plagues came over Egypt, 7, a transformational number to the next highest octave, Moses, then the New Commandments of Jesus Christ. Historically, Egypt had fulfilled its work and the Greeks took over.

Chrismation of a Lady was celebrated in Church yesterday, in which the Gift of the Holy Spirit was bestowed 7 times.

Hopefully I&apos;ll have some quiet moment in San Francisco to read more. The Holy Virgin Cathedral is definately on the agenda.

&quot;In my Father&apos;s house are many mansions...&quot;John 14:1-3

Had a dream this morning about my mansion in the Kingdom of Heaven. It was an abandoned water tower in a deserted part of town. You had to climb up this long ladder to get to a door in the side of it. Inside was a round room, nicely furnished.

There were doors to other rooms where you wouldn&apos;t expect there to be any. Each room led into another entire house in a different location.

One room led into a house in the suburbs. Another room led into an apartment in Paris. Another room led to a cabin with a back porch looking out on a mountain lake. You could go from room to room looking out the windows at these different environments, or you could step out of any of these houses into the area they fronted on.

The attic was a pyramid in Egypt. The capstone led into a tree house in the redwoods. There was a bird&apos;s nest in the redwood outside the tree house where you turned into a hawk and flew off into a clear blue sky. There was a refrigerator in the kitchen whose door led into the back of a cave in New Mexico.

You could step out of your apartment in Paris, take a taxi to the airport, fly to America, get in a jeep, drive to a ranch, and ride a horse to the cave in the canyon which opens up back in through your refrigerator.

There were closet doors which led into places like Narnia and Middle Earth and to Palestine in 29 a.d. and out onto the surface of other planets.

There was a bathroom which, instead of being in three dimensions, was in sixteen! But I didn&apos;t feel quite ready to go in there... Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Nov 30, 2009, 8:14pm

Thank God I&apos;m almost back in my own mansion I treasure. What an interesting dream, fitting, the attic would be the Pyramid and the capstone, stable, leading to tree house in the Redwoods, high enough them trees to take off. Seems you made quite a journey, and a bathroom in sixteen dimensions, I&apos;m trying to imagine.

Three nights ago I dreamed walking with someone in the city a few km from where I grew up. the entire Town Square was newly paved with ca. 5x5 inch square stones in earth colors in symetrical patterns. We walked past the Rathaus, the main Administrave Building where important records and documents are kept, and to my surprise the pavement in stone continued. The Town Square had become a large, elegant Plaza with Lamp Posts strategically placed. It was a marvelous design and I wondered whose idea it was to create such a new, wide open space.

I&apos;m flying back to LA tomorrow.

Greetings to One and All,

I trust everyone had a great Thanksgiving, save Don perhaps, as Thanksgiving is celebrated on the 12th of October in Canada, meaning all Canada give thanks for my birth We did drink to thy health and good fortune, Don.

Our Fest was as anticipated, much work, noise, and political talk which my Son started with a sly smile at me. A die-hard Republican, he even voted for Obama, of whom I dreamt last night, i.e., we were standing by a wall conversing about something when suddenly He rubbed the wall clean with His hand and sleeve and painted a beautiful and strange flower/picture on the wall but didn&apos;t finish it. Then we sat on a top step and spoke some more I can&apos;t remember, and I said something about listening to Dan Rader, upon which the President moved very close to me in a loving manner, coming under the category of &apos;wishful thinking dreams&apos;, and I thought what would Michelle think or do if She saw this. Actually, it was a &apos;long&apos; dream, must have been because I watched His address to the Nation last night and projected things to my liking, as we generally do in dreams. Sorry, had to mention it.

It was very chilly and rained, but being with the Family made up for it, and thank God I&apos;m back in my own four walls. I think it effected me more than I thought, can&apos;t do that life anymore, and the Flight Attendant on the way to LA announced that this flight was a non-smoking, non-sniveling, non-whining, non-complaining, everyone-stay-in-your-seats-buckled-up-until-we- come-to-a-screaching-halt-if-the-Pilot-can-find-the-Gate, if-not-you&apos;re-on-your-own-flight, but after the Evening Prayer I felt better.

Friday, my Daughter M. and I drove into the&quot;City&quot;, San Francisco, that is, the most important event for me to visit the Holy Virgin Cathedral to be near Saint John and venerate the Theotokos Kursk Root Icon of 1295, for it is written of the Mother of God,&quot;If I am with you no one can be against you&quot;, petitioning Saint John and the Holy Theotokos for Blessings. We stopped by the Golden Doors which were closed. I read that the Cathedral was open 7days a week for the Holy Liturgy and Vesper, so I walked to the Book Store to enquire of a Monk present when the Cathedral may be open, to which He replied, &apos;oh from about 8 to 8:30 AM for Holy Liturgy, and 7 to about 7:30 in the evening for Vesper, but go and knock somebody may be in there&apos;.

I went back and knocked in a manner so whoever was in there could read my Mind, but no luck, so I went back to speak more with the Monk, who sat undisturbed by His desk examining papers with a magnifying glass, and said,&quot;I knocked but nobody answered, I am from LA and would so love to see the Cathedral&quot;, I politely pleaded, but unconcerned with my predicament He said,&quot;Don&apos;t give up, keep knocking&quot;.

Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven&apos;s Door once more, diligently, till my knuckles hurt and I had to use the back of my fist in a gentle manner, but it didn&apos;t open. Back I went to the Monk to ask for a Theotokos Kursk Root Icon to which He led me. It is most beautiful, colorful, and interesting, I wish I could read the Letters and Words. The Icon is below &apos;The Resurrection&apos; Icon. St. Spyridon had to move one down but I can still see Him.

I aked if the Prayer Rope&apos;s come from Mt. Athos,&quot;no&quot;, said the Monk,&quot;they are made locally&quot;. I would like one from the Holy Mountain.

Driving back I thought that perhaps the Monk smiled inwardly when He said,&quot;Don&apos;t give up, keep on knocking&quot;. Withal, I was very disappointed of not being able to visit the inside of the Cathredral, hopefully there will be another opportunity.

Thus far my story.

Charlotte


O lovely dust, sweet festival of light,
Abridge of heaven in mortal eyes reflected,
The map of form and pitch of beauty&apos;s height,
Undoubled stamp by time&apos;s last die perfected:
Nature was novice when she hued the rose,
And on the Lily&apos;s shape addressed her hand,
From every bud of spring some best she chose,
Till stept in Art, thy captain work she planned.
All fairs but thee are still her prentice fetches,
Thy paragon her single master-stroke;
Since thou art done she&apos;s thrown away her scetches,
Scattered her tincts and all her patterns broke.

Yet of thy making there&apos;s to tell the best:
Heaven sent thy earth an angel for a guest.

Continuing

The Ladder of Divine Ascent

A Layman&apos;s Guide to ascending the Heights in 30 Steps

St. John Climacus Ladder of Divine Ascent


Step 1: Renunciation

&quot;But to secure a rocklike foundation, those with a mind for the religious life will turn away from everything, will despise everything, will ridicule everything, will shake of everything, Innocence, abstinance, temperance - these make a fine thrice-firm foundation.&quot;

Step 2: Detachment

&quot;No one can enter crowned into the heavenly bridechamber without making the three renunciations. He has to turn away from worldly concerns, from men, from family; he must cut selfishness away; and thirdly, he must rebuff the vanity that follows obedience.&quot;

Step 3: Exile

&quot;Exile is a seperation from everything, in order that one may hold on totally to God. . . Exile is a disciplined heart, unheralded wisdom, a hidden life . . . unseen meditation, the striving to be humble, a wish for poverty, the longing for what is divine.&quot;

Step 4: On Blessed and Ever-Memorable Obedience

&quot;Obedience is unquestioning movement, voluntary death, a life free of curiosity, carefree danger, unprepared defence before God, fearlessness of death, a safe voyage, a sleeper&apos;s progress.&quot;

Step 5: Repentance

&quot;Repentance is the voluntary endurance of all afflictions. A penitent is the inflictor of his own punishments.&quot;

Step 6: Remembrance of Death

&quot;It is impossible, someone says, impossible to spend the present day devoutly unless we regard it as the last of our whole life.&quot;

Step 7: On Mourning

&quot;Mourning which is according to God is a melancholy of the soul, a disposition of an anguished heart that passionately seeks what it thirsts for, and when it fails to attain it, pursues it diligently and follows behind it lamenting bitterly.&quot;

Step 8: On Freedom from Anger and on Meekness

&quot;The first step toward freedom from anger is to keep the lips silent when the heart is stirred; the next, to keep thoughts silent when the soul is upset; the last, to be totally calm when unclean winds are blowing.&quot;

Step 9: On Remembrance of Wrongs

&quot;Some, for the sake of forgiveness, give themselves up to labor and struggles, but a man who is forgetful of wrongs excels them. If you forgive quickly, then you will be generously forgiven.&quot;

Step 10: On Slander or Calumny

&quot;He who wants to overcome the spirit of slander should not ascribe the blame to the person who falls, but to the demon who suggests it. For no one really wants to sin against God, even though we all sin without being forced to do so.&quot;


Some steps are easy, others are hard, some we have experience of, or are experiencing. One can be encouraged to keep on climbing in our flawed state as even Monks fall from the Ladder to Jesus.

Have a great day!

Charlotte

Today is the Consecration by His Grace, Bishop Maxim, of the Main Monastery Church at St. Herman of Alaska Monastery in Platina, CA, to which Steven invited One and All. Surely, the Gentleman, Congregation, and Pilgrims have an enjoyable day.

December 4, is also the Feast of the Entry of the Most Holy Theotokos into the Temple.

Continuing the difficult climb of
The Ladder of Divine Ascent

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_of_Divine-Ascent 

Step 11: On Silence and talkativeness

&quot;He who has become aware of his sins has controlled his tongue, but a talkative person has not yet come to know himself as he should.&quot;

Step 12: On Laying

&quot;A lie is the destruction of love, and a false oath is a denial of God.&quot;

Step 13: On Despondency

&quot;Despondency is being languid in singing psalms, weak in prayer, like iron in service, resolute in manual labor, reliable in obedience.&quot;

Step 14: On That Clamorous Mistress, the Stomach

&quot;Stint your stomach and you will certainly lock your mouth, because the tongue is strenghtened by an abundance of food. Struggle with all might against the stomach and restrain it with all sobriety. If you labor a little, the Lord will also soon work with you.&quot;

Step 15: On Incorruptible Purity and Chastity

&quot;The good Lord shows His great care for us in that the shamelessness of the feminine sex is checked by shyness as with a sort of bit. For if the women were to run after man, no flesh would be saved.&quot;

Step 16: On Love of Money, or Avarice

&quot;The collector (of money) is stirred by charity, but, when the money is in, the grip tightens.&quot;

Step 17: On Permissiviness

&quot;The man who has tasted the things of heaven easily thinks nothing of what is below, but he who has had no taste of heaven finds pleasure in possessions.&quot;

Step 18: On Insensibility

&quot;He who has lost sensibility is a witless philosopher, a self-condemned commentator, a self-contradictory windbag, a blind man who teaches others to see.&quot;

Step 19: On Sleep, Prayer, and Psalmody
With the Brotherhood

&quot;Just as over-drinking is a matter of habit, so too from habit comes over-sleeping. Therefore we must struggle with the question of sleep, especially in the early days of obediance, because a long-standing habit is difficult to cure.&quot;

Step 20: On Bodily Vigil, and How to Use It to Attain Spiritual Vigil, and How to Practice It.

&quot;Some stand before earthly kings without weapons and without armor; but others hold staffs of office, or have shields, or swords. The former are vastly superior to the latter, for they are usually personal relations of the king and members of the royal household. So it is with earthly kings.&quot;


Step 20 reminds one of &apos;as above so below&apos;

Have a wonderful day

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Dec 5, 2009, 10:41am

The Ladder of Divine Ascent

Step 21: On Unmanly and Puerile Cowardice

&quot;It is not darkness and desolateness of place that give the demons power against us , but barreness of soul. And through God&apos;s providence, this sometimes happens in order that we may learn by it.&quot;

Step 22: On the Many Forms of Vainglory

&quot;When you hear that your neighbor or friend has abused you behind your back or even to your face, then show love and praise him.&quot;

Step 23: On Mad Pride

When the demon of pride gets a foothold in his servants, he appears to them either in sleep or in waking vision, as though in a form of a holy angel or some martyr, and gives them a revelation, of mysteries, or a free bestowal of spiritual gifts. . .&quot;

Step 24: On Meekness, Simplicity and Guilessness

&quot;Meekness is an unchangeable state of mind, which remains the same in honor and dishonor.&quot;

Step 25: On Humility

&quot;Many have received salvation without prophesies and revelations, without signs and wonders; but without humility no one will enter the marriage chamber, because humility is the guardian of these gifts, and without her they bring frivolous people to ruin.&quot;

Step 26: On discernment of thoughts, passions and virtues

&quot;Let us try to learn Divine truth more by toil and swaet than by mere word, for at the time of our departure it is not words but deeds that have to be shown.&quot;

Step 27: On holy stillness of body and soul

&quot;He who is sick in soul from some passion and attempts stillness is like a man who has jumped from a ship into the sea and thinks that he will reach the shore safely on a plank.&quot;

Step 28: On Holy and Blessed Prayer

&quot;When you are going to stand before the Lord, let the garment of your soul be woven throughout with the thread of obliviousness to wrongs. Otherwise, prayer will bring you no benefit.&quot;

Step 29: Concerning Heaven and Earth, or Godlike Dispassion

&quot;The dispassionate man no longer lives himself, but Christ lives in him, as he says who fought the good fight, finished his course and kept the faith.&quot;

Step 30: The Suprime Trinity among Virtues

&quot;He who says that he loves the Lord and is angry with his brother is like a man who dreams that he is running.&quot;


I have, and people have told of trying to run in dreams, getting nowhere. Some rungs are hard to stand on to get to the next, some are easy, and the steps of Wisdom are in the style of Lao Tsu, other wise Men, Women, and Poets. Before walking how many times around the park, a daily spiritual exercise to see how many can be can be remembered and become ingrained.

Reading much the past days, &apos;Faith&apos; is constantly emphasized, and not only in Orthodox Literature, and it strenghtens mine each time even though I had plenty all my life.

Inspired by the Angel Icon,&quot;Bodiless Powers&quot;, and Dore Rose, I found interesting reading about Angels in a book I have. I would thank Steven also for Dore&apos;s&quot;Raising of the Daughter of Jairus&quot;, twelve years of age, connected with a certain women who had a flow of blood for twelve years, which was the Gospel reading of November 22 in my Church, and of which I wrote on the last page. Twelve years signifying the law of Moses being fulfilled and the New Commandment of Jesus taking effect, as both were healed by Christ.

Of Dore&apos;s illustrations, incredibly accomplished as they are in pencil, I liked another in particular, viz, Jesus and the Samaria Women by the well.

Beautiful Icon of the Pantocrator, painted by a beautiful Mind. Who is the happily smiling Father?


And ev&apos;n Apollo&apos;s choir was a rich voice lacking
in the great symphonies of the poetic throng
who beneath Homer&apos;s crown enroll&apos;d immortal names;
for without later names the full compass of song
had been unknown to mannay and some English names,
whose younger voices in the imagination of love
swell&apos;d to spiritual ecstacy, and emotion&apos;d life
with mystic inspiration of new lyric rapture;
and &apos;twas the first alluring gleam of thatt vision
that stole by virtue of novelty the world away
from the philosophic concinnity of Greek art,
to abjure the severe ordering of its antique folds,
In love of fleshy prowess Hellas oversteem&apos;d
the nobility of passion and of animal strenght,
and the accalmation of their Olympic game outfaced
spiritual combat;as their forefathers wer they,
those old seapirates, who with roving robbery
built up their island lordships on the ruin of Crete,
when the unvorbearing rivaltry of their free cities
wreck&apos;d their confederacy within the sevenscore years
&apos;twixt Marathon and Issus; untill from the pride
of routing Xerxes and his fabulous host, they fell
to make thatt most memorable of all invasions
less memorable in the glory of Alexander,
under whose alien kingship they conspired to outreach
their own ambition, winning dominions too wide
for domination; and wer, with their virtue, dispersed
and molten into the great stiffening alloy of Rome.

So it was when Jesus came in his gentleness
with his divine compassion and great Gospel of Peace,
men hail&apos;d him WORD OF GOD, and in the title of Christ
crown&apos;d him with love beyond all earth-names and renown,
For He, wandering unarm&apos;d save by the Spirit&apos;s flame,
in few years with few friends founded a world-empire
wider than Alexander&apos;s and more enduring;
since from his death it took his everlasting life.
HIS kingdom in God&apos;s kingdom, and his holy temple
not in Athens or Rome but in the heart of man.

They who understand not cannot forget, and they
who kept not his commandment call him Master and Lord.
He preached once to the herd, but now calleth the wise,
and shall in his second Advent, that tarried long,
be glorified by the Greeks that come to the feast:
But the great light shineth in the darkness, the seed
that fell by the wayside hath been trodden under foot,
thatt which fell on the rock is nigh wither&apos;d away;
While loud and louder thro&apos; the dazed head of the SPHINX
the old lion&apos;s voice roareth o&apos;er all the lands.

The Divine Poet Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Dec 7, 2009, 1:32pm

He preached once to the herd but now calleth the Wise.

Truly, it was very good to be in Church again. His Grace, Bishop Maxim served the Liturgy, the hours were festive, and reverend the Congregation in harmony with the Dignity of His Grace.

Celebrated was &apos;The Entrance Of The Theotokos Into The Temple&quot;, the Ritual and singing was somewhat different, prayers in Serbian language, and the core message always being the same. Love God, keep His Commandments, pray for everyone, give to the poor, and don&apos;t look for the living, the Risen Christ, among the dead, or almost 2000 years ago as I used to do. Steven, pardon me, in the dream He conveyed of going to many places from the round room, nicely furnished, on top of an abondoned water tower, one being Palestine in 29 AD. Would that I hath such dreams, but I have Faith.

His Grace touched briefly of Jesus Christ being born from a Lady who remained ever a Virgin, a great and Holy Mystery which cannot be spoken of.

&quot;The most pure Temple of the Savior; the precious Chamber of the Virgin; the sacred Treasure of the Glory of God, is presented today to the house of the Lord. She brings with her the grace of the Spirit, therefore the angels of God praise her:&quot;Truly this women is the abode of heaven.&quot;

It is rash to ask, methinks, why the Church keeps silent on Holy Mysteries. In the lesser, I would say, that one can only believe or know that there are Mysteries when one has been discovered.

In the lesser also, I can give two examples for silence. I remember Isha De Lubicz writing that when a secret is revealed, the Reader will keep silent voluntarily as She herself does, and Madam Blavatsky cautioning,&quot;But you have learned to be prudent....&quot;, both Lady&apos;s saying, if you have understood what you just read, best to keep silent. It may be one reason why the Lion has such importance with the Ancients. Saint Dionysius the Areopagite:&quot;The lion was said by the ancients to erase his footprints with his tail&quot;.

All of greater Los Angeles is rejoycing for IT IS RAINING nice and steady, thank God, and hopefully it will pour so I can park my car on the street to be washed. We are awaiting another &apos;storm&apos; to fill our lakes with precious water and top our mountains with snow.

Thank you, I had no idea what a great Event and Feast it would be, involving the&quot;Rite of Concecration&quot;and the Holy Relics of St. Herman of Alaska and St. Anthony the Great, two Bishops and so many Priests and Monks. It must indeed be Grand and important Monastery you helped to build. Perchance I can visit there some time.

I went through the pictures twice, saw His Grace and Clergy, but inside the Church it was pretty dark and members of the Congregation are hard to see. Having seen only the one photograph in the beginning it was hard for me to recognize anyone, so I looked for a head with a bold spot, sorry I can&apos;t stop laughing, and saw a couple but not the face, so that was no help. I very much enjoyed the write up and leaned.

Both, at the Concecration of the Saint Herman of Alaska Monastery at Platina, and Orthodox Cathedral at Alhambra, the Feast of&quot;The Entry of the Theotokos into the Temple&quot;was celebrated, I turned more of my attention in particular to the&quot;Annunciation&quot;by the Archangel Gabriel to the&quot;Virgin Mary&quot;,&quot;Godbearer&quot;, or&quot;Birthgiver of God&quot;, and&quot;it is understood by Orthodox Christians to have not only a pious but also a theological significance, - it is affirmed that Christ possesses a human nature as well as a divine nature (as opposed to being purely divine).

&quot;This is an essential understanding in the Orthodox doctrine of theosis. Thus the title&quot;Theotokos&quot;is as much a statement about Christ and the incarnation as it is about the Virgin Mary herself; it is this particular view of the incarnation that allows Mary to bear this title.&quot;

Many Scholars and researchers have looked for, thought, or conjectured that the&quot;Garden of Eden&quot;is somewhere here on Earth. As far as I know, it is not.

The Contribution of the Theotokos to the Theosis of Man

&quot;So, the Lord Jesus gives up this possibility to unite with God and returne to the primary purpose which God ordained for man. Therefore He is described as the way, the door, the good shepherd, the life, the resurrection, the light. He is the new Adam who rights the wrong of the first Adam. The first Adam seperated from God with his disobedience and his egotism. With His love and His obedience to the Father, obedience onto&quot;death on the cross,&quot;the second Adam, Christ, brings us back once more to God. Once again He orients our freedom towards God, so that by offering Him our freedom, we unite with Him.

&quot;The work of the new Adam pre-supposes the work of a new Eve, the Panagia who put right the wrong done by the old Eve. Eve drove Adam to disobediance. The new Eve, the Panagia, contributes to the incarnation of the new Adam who will giude the human race towards obedience to God. Therefore, as the first human person who achieved Theosis -in an exceptional and, of course unrepeatable, way- the Lady Theotokos played a role in our salvation which was not only fundamental, but both necessary and irreplaceable.

&quot;According to St. Nicholas Cabasilas, the great 14th century theologian, if the Panagia, in her obedience, had not offered her freedom to God -had she not said&quot;yes&quot;to God- God would have not been able to incarnate. Once God had given Freedom to man, He would not have been able to violate His gift, so He would have not been able to incarnate if there had not been such a pure, all-holy, immaculate psuche as the Theotokos, who would offer her freedom, her will, all of herself totally to God so as to draw Him towards herself and towards us.

&quot;We own so much to Panagia. This is why our Church honours and venerates the Theotokos so much, so that St. Gregory Palamas, summarising Patristic theology, says that our Panagia holds second place after the Holy Trinity, that she is God after God, the boundry between the created and the uncreated.&quot;She leads those who being saved,&quot;according to another fine expression by a theologian of our Church. Recently St. Nicodemus of the Holy Mountain, the steadfast luminary and teacher of the Church, pointed out that the angelic ranks themselves are illuminated by the light they receive from the Panagia.

&quot;Therefore, she is praised by our Church as&quot;more hounourable than the Cherubim and incomparably more glorious than the Seraphim.&quot;

&quot;The incarnation of the Logos and the Theosis of man are the great mystery of our Faith and Theology.&quot;


I posted an Icon of Saint John the Wonderworker, who in every rendering wears a neckless of the Theotokos, and the beautiful Icon of &apos;She who ripens the grain&quot;, Steven posted, can also be contemplated with this post:

The Contribution of the Theotokos to the Theosis of Man

&quot;The incarnation of the Logos and the Theosis of man are the great mystery of our Faith and Theology.

&quot;Our Orthodox Church lives this every day with its Mysteries, with its hymns, with its icons, with its whole life. Even the architecture of an Orthodox Church witnesses (is?) to this. The great dome of the churches, on which the Pantocrator is painted, symbolizes the descent of Heaven to earth; it tells us that the Lord&quot;bent down the Heavens and descended.&quot;The Evangelist St. John writes that God became man&quot;and dwelt among us (John 1:14).&quot;

During the Divine Liturgy, when a sanctified &apos;air&apos; already permiates the Chuch, for me anyway, the Priest will turn to the Congregation and say:&quot;Christ is among us&quot;.

&quot;So, we represent the Theotokos in the apse of the altar to show that God comes to earth and men through her, because He became man through the Theotokos. She is&quot;the bridge by which God descended,&quot;and again,&quot;she who conducts those of earth to Heaven,&quot;the Platytera of the Heaven, the space of the uncontainable, who contained the uncontainable God within herself for our salvation.&quot;

Always, I love the distinct language, gentle tone, and methodical way of the Teachings.

A beautiful Statue of the Archangel Gabriel in Budapest, holding aloft the Crown of St. Steven

 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Gabor_arkangyal.jpg 

&quot;To continue, our Churches show deified men; those who became gods by the Grace of God because God became man. In our Orthodox Churches we can picture not only the incarnate God, Christ, and His immaculate Mother the Lady Theotokos, but we also show the saints around and below the Pantocrator; on all the walls of the Church we paint the results of God&apos;s incarnation: sainted and deified men.

&quot;Thus, when we enter an Orthodox Church and see the beautiful holy icons, this is an immediate experience through which we learn what God&apos;s plan is for man; what is the purpose of our life.

&quot;Everything in the Church talks to us about the incarantion of God and the Theosis of man.&quot;

I remember Mr. Hall beginning one of His lectures,&quot;Where do we come from, why are we here, and where are we going? Either we are a little piece of protoplasm from the Ocean bottom and have become what we are now&quot;, and never passing up a jest like Francis,&quot;and that isn&apos;t very much if you look around you, or there is more to us&quot;. He paused and said,&quot;Who is Man that thou shalt be mindful of Him&quot;, and continued,&quot;Is there a God or is there no God? If we believe there is a God, we would like to see at least a little evidence, have some kind of assurance that everything is not for nothing. &apos;Weeell, that is not the way it is....&quot;

I cannot remember every sentence verbatim, but &apos;tis pretty close and the important words are correct. Mr. Hall also spoke very gentle, simple, and almost without pause, but when He raised His Head and smiled a wave of Love moved toward Him.

Have a great Day!

Perchance thou would hear my thoughts: &apos;thank God for that now and eternally&apos;; and thank Him for the additional rain as well.

There is a 12th century Russian Icon of the Archangel Gabriel depicted with a Ruby on His Brow reminiscent of the&quot;kingly Ruby&quot;mentioned in the Fama Fraternitas, having just written of CvR, which may have meaning in the greater view, but I have been off the mark before.

The statement in the Contribution of the Theotokos to the Theosis of Man,&quot;.... if the Panagia, in her obedience, had not offered her freedom to God -had she not said&quot;yes&quot;to God- God would have not been able to incarnate&quot;, is reflected in the painting by Esteban Murillo, I posted, viz, the Archangel Gabriel is in an attitude of waiting for a&quot;yes&quot;while the Panagia seems to be thinking about the awesome and Divine Mission offered by God.

Similarly, in the painting by Rubens, Gabriel seems to be saying &apos;look up&apos;, and looking at the apparently hesitating Panagia directly is waiting for an answer.

Consequences of Guidance for Theosis

&quot;The guidance that our Orthodox Church offers, with its Holy Services, Patristic theology, Monasticism, it the antropocentric guidance. It&apos;s centre is the God-Man Christ, and it leads to Theosis.

&quot;This brings great joy into our life when we know what a great destiny we have, and what blessedness awaits us.

&quot;To set our sights on Theosis sweetens the pain in every trail and all the worries of life.&quot;

&apos;Tis true above and below in &apos;the better days ahead&apos; everyone hopes for as expressed continually.

&quot;When we are struggling towards the aim of Theosis, that is to say, when we see one another as prosepctive gods, our attitude towards our fellow men changes for the better.&quot;

The Hindus and Japanese are raised thus bowing deeply to the divinity in each person. What a different world it would be if we would see a prospective god in everyone we meet.


&quot;Be therefore, gentle Reader, admonished, that with me you do earnestly pray to God, that it please him to open the hearts and ears of all ill hearing people, and to grant onto them his blessings, that they may be able to know him in his Omnipotency, with admiring contemplation of Nature, to his honour and praise, and to love, help, comfort and strenghtening of our neighbors, and to the restoring of all the diseased.&quot;

Theosis is the context within which everything else comes together and makes sense.

Our expectations of what it means to be a human being and what we can expect out of life has been systematically lowered.

When once we come to understand the true worth and great dignity of humanity, everything changes for us, for the better.

We can&apos;t help but begin to love one another simply because each of us has the same potential for regaining our lost likeness to God.

The only obstacle we face is our lack of awareness of what our true potential is. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Dec 12, 2009, 12:53pm

In my work we discuss this or the other, and one Lady frequently says,&quot;I guess it isn&apos;t that important in the greater scheme of things.&quot;Only a few weeks ago I restrained myself from asking,&quot;What is the greater scheme of things?&quot;Had I said what I thought about our purpose for this sojourn on earth, word would have gone out that I now lost it completely, whereas before I earned a sympathetic smile when stating that we are immortal. I just smiled back and went about my business. So yes, no one has been told.

To be raised in a family where Theosis is a Given, would have been ideal, still, to be aware of our potential of becoming gods by Grace is like walking towards a jewel of greatest prize gleaming in the distance.

Being born just do die gives such an empty and finite feeling. Orthodoxy teaches that children are brought into this world for the purpose of Theosis.

&quot;How much more respect will we have for ourselves when we feel that we have been moulded for this great purpose; when we are without the egotism and pride which opposes God.&quot;

It would solve the&quot;self-esteem issues&quot;millions suffer from, instead we give the thus dispirited a&quot;make-over&quot;, the homeless a shower, haircut, shave, new clothes, a meal, and put then back out in the streets.

&quot;An awareness of this great calling of his, i.e. O Theosis, comforts and completes man. The Orthodox humanism of our Church is based on this great calling of man, and therefore it develops all his powers to the extreme.

&quot;What other form of humanism, however progressive and liberal it may appear, is as revolutionary as that of the Church which is able to make man a god? Only the humanism of the Church reaches so high.&quot;

It&apos;s never about the Church, but the Church&apos; constant encouragement and aim to make a man a god.

The beautiful Church of St. Andrew in Kiev

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Andrew%27s_Church_of_Kiev 

To my surprise, Papadia Sandra greeted me warmly for the second time, and we exchanged a few words about me having been in SF over Thanksgiving.

The Service began festive and was peformed somewhat differently as were the sung lyrics.

The first reading was from the Epistle of the Holy Apostle St. Paul to the Ephesians, well known.

&quot;Brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against prinicpalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.&quot;

Reminds me of Athena with shield, helmet and sword.

The second reading was from the Holy Gospel of St. Luke, of&quot;a women who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bent over and could in no way raise herself&quot;. Jesus was preaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath at the time, and seeing her called her to Him, saying,&quot;Women, you are loosed from your infirmity&quot;, and healed her by laying His hands on her.

This was met with indignation by the ruler of the Synagogue, who said there were six days to work, but not on the Sabbath.

&quot;The Lord then answered him and said:&quot;Hypocrite! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or donkey from the stall, and lead it away to water it? So ought not this women, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Saton had bound - think of it - for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?&quot;And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the multitude rejoyced for all the glorious things that were done by Him&quot;.

Commentary

&quot;Did God make man for the Sabbath, or the Sabbath for man? Is healing actually work?

&quot;Christ&apos;s actions allowed this women, afflicted for ten and eight years (a numerical representation of both the perfection of God and the New Creation of the Eighth Day), to finally be at rest on the Sabbath.&quot;

The most zealous Christian I knew was Fern, who insisted that because of the Christ Event we are already&quot;in a New Heaven and Earth&quot;, confirmed by the Orthodox Church, to wit, Jesus Christ is the New Adam.

The Sabbath is for praising God, but&quot;we are caught up in the unimportant, man-made rules and regulations&quot;, instead of doing things&quot;with the love of God and love for our neighbor as the intention....&quot;

Father Ceko always smiles as if He had not a care in the world, and while encouraging the Congregation to&quot;eat, drink, and be merry&quot;at Christmas time, we should not forget the hungry, thirsty, naked, and sick. I can&apos;t find my friend Rusty anywhere since over a year

Inside of each of us there is a yearning, not only for our lost Paradise, but for the Kingdom of Heaven which Paradise would have led directly up into.

Every so often, we can connect to the source of that yearning within us and thereupon experience a surge of warmth and well-being which reassures us and gives us strength and courage.

We were created for Paradise and Intended for the Kingdom of Heaven. This world and everything in it, is the means of regaining the one and becoming citizens of the other.

Saint Alban, the Martyr and Wonder-worker

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Alban 

Owing to my love for, and affinity with Sir Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount of St. Alban, Lord Verulam, I am somewhat familiar with the Saint, as Gorhambury, the Mansion of Sir Nicholas Bacon and Childhood Home of Francis, was in part constructed from the stones of the then in ruins original Saint Albans Abbey, built&quot;in the eighth century by King Offa and the Hond operative masons to the memory of St. Alban&quot;, whose execution date was ca. 313-304-209, these dates also disputed.

The stones were deemed&quot;Holy Stones&quot;, and Gurhambury, near where was the old Abbey, was known as&quot;The Temple&quot;. In Roman days, St. Alban was called Verulam, and

&quot;Within the walls of Verulam, which he took for the name of his Barony, Sir Francis Bacon, the essayist and statesman, built a fine small house that was thoroughly described by the 17th century diarist John Aubrey; not a trace is left, but Aubrey noted&quot;At Verulam is to be seen, in some few places, some remains of the wall of the Citie.&quot;

These may be the remains of the walls of the city, but methinks not the&quot;fine small house&quot;of Francis

 http://www.knowledgerush.com/kr/encyclopedia/Verulamium 

According to the venerable Bede,&quot;Alban was a pagan living in Verulamium (now St. Alban), who converted to Christianity, and was executed by decapitation on a hill above the Roman settlement&quot;, where later was founded the beautiful and impressive

The Life of St Alban, First Martyr of Britain

 http://www.sobornost.org/alban.html 

On sheltering a Priest from persecution, Saint Alban was called before a judge who ask Alban:

&quot;Of what family are you?&quot;The saint answered,&quot;That is a matter of no concern to you. I would have you know that I am a Christian.&quot;The judge persisted, and the saint said,&quot;I was called Alban by my parents, and I worship the living and true God the creator of all things.

&quot;As he was led to the place of his execution (traditionally the hill on which Saint Albans abbey church now stands) a miracle wrought by the saint so touched the heart of the executioner that he flung down his sword, threw himself at Alban&apos;s feet, avowing himself a Christian, and begged to either suffer for him or with him. Another soldier picked up the sword, and in the words of Bede,&quot;the valiant martyr&apos;s head was stricken off, and he received the crown of life which God has promised to those who love Him.&quot;

 Troparion to St Alban - Tone Four 

&quot;Thou didst defend the persecuted priest, and thyself didst receive the message of salvation. Fearless before the judge thou didst proclaim:&quot;My name is Alban and I serve the true and living God.&quot;Thou didst become the first-fruit of our land; O holy martyr Alban pray unceasingly to God for the salvation of the world.&quot;

Curious that there is an&quot;Albanifest&quot;, the largest annual festival to be held in a historic town in Switzerland, is named after him. This takes place in Winterthur, where Alban is one of the three city-saints.&quot;

The millimeter steps between each rung of&quot;The Ladder of Divine Ascent&quot;of

Dionysius the Areopagite

Chapter III

What is Hierarchy, and what the use of Hierarchy?

Hierarchy is, in my opinion, a holy order and
knowledge and activity with, so far as is
attainable, participates in the Divine
Likeness, and is lifted up to illuminations
given it from God, and correspondingly toward
the imitation of God.

Now the Beauty of God, being unific, good, and
and the Source of all perfection, is wholly free from
dissimilarity, and bestows its own Light upon
each according to his merit; and in the most
divine Mysteries perfects them in accordance with
the unchangeable fashioning of those who are
being perfected harmoniously to Itself.

The aim of Hierarchy is the greatest possible
assimilation to and union with God, and by taking
Him as leader in all holy wisdom, to become like
Him, so far as is permitted, by contemplating
intently His most Divine Beauty. Also it moulds
and perfects its participants in the holy image of
God like bright and spotless mirrors which
receive the Ray of the Supreme Deity -which is
the Source of all Light; and being mystically filled
with the Gift of Light; it pours it forth again
abundantly, according to Divine Law, upon
those below itself. For it is not lawful for those
who impart or participate in the Holy Mysteries to
overpass the bounds of its sacred laws; nor must
they diviate from them if they seek to behold, as
far is allowed, that Deific Splendour and to be
transformed into the likeness of those Divine
Intelligences.

Therefore he who speaks of Hierarchy implies a
certain perfect holy Order in the likeness of the
First Divine Beauty, ministering the sacred
mystery of its own illuminations in hierarchical
order and wisdom, being in due measure
conformed to its own Principle.

For each of those who are allotted a place in the
Divine Order finds his perfection in being
uplifted, according to his capacity, toward the
Divine Likeness; and what is still more divine, he
becomes, as
the Scriptures say, a fellow-worker with God, and
shows forth Divine Activity revealed as far as
possible &apos;in himself. For the holy constitution of
the Hierarchy ordains that some are purified,
others purify; some are enlightened, others
enlighten; some are perfected, others make perfect;
for in this way the divine imitation will fit each one.

A great day to All!

An orange glow upward from the horizon heralds another glorious day in the South Bay.

Celestial Hierarchy

In as much the Divine Bliss (to speak in human
terms) is exempt from all dissimilarity, and is full
of Eternal Light, perfect, in need of no perfection,
purifying, illuminating, perfecting being rather
Himself the holy Purification, Illumination and
Perfection, above purification, above light,
supremely perfect, Himself the origin of
perfection and the cause of every Hierarchy, He
transends in excellence all holiness.

I hold, therefore, that those who are being purified
ought to be wholly perfected and free from all
taint of unlikeness; those who are illuminated
should be filled full with Divine Light, ascending
to the contemplative state and power with the
most pure eyes of the mind; those who are being
initiated, holding themselves apart from all
imperfection, should become participators in the
Divine Wisdom which they have contemplated.

Further it is meet that those who purify should
bestow upon others from their abundance of
purity their own holiness; those who illuminate, as
possessing more luminous intelligence, duly
received and again shedding forth the light, and
joyously filled with holy brightness, should
impart their own overflowing light to those
worthy of it; finally, those who make perfect,
being skilled in the mystical participations, should
lead to that consummation those who are
perfected by the most holy initiation of the
knowledge of holy things which they have contemplated.

Thus each order in the hierarchical succession is
guided to the divine co-operation, and brings into
manifestation, through the Grace and Power of
God, that which is naturally and supernaturally in
the Godhead, and which is consummated by Him
superessentually, but is hierarchically manifested
for man&apos;s imitation as far as is attainable, of the
God-loving Celestial Intelligences.

&apos;Tis in Harmony with Theosis, intelligible, true, and observable.

A timeline of Church History

 &quot;All historians agree today that the schism which eventuall became a permanent form of seperation between Eastern and Western Christians did not occur suddenly. It was the result of a progressive&quot;estrangement&quot;(the English term used by the French theologian Yves Congar), and cannot even be dated. The churches of Rome and Constantinople were often seperated for long periods of time already between the fourth and the ninth centurys. These early conflicts were sometimes caused by heresies, held in the capital of the Eastern empire (Arianism, 335-381; Monotheletism, 533-680; Iconoclasm, 723-787, 815-842) and rightfully rejected by Rome. Sometimes Rome and Constantinople differed in their attitude in the field of eccliastical oikonomia (the&quot;Neo-Nicean&quot;position, inherited from the Cappadocian Fathers, 381 -ca. 400; the attitude to be adopted toward the Henotikon, also referred to as the&quot;Acacian schism&quot;, 428-518), and communication was broken on those grounds. Whatever the issue and whoever was at fault, it is clear that, underneath the debate on a concrete theological or disciplinary problem, there was a developing difference on the respective authority of the&quot;apostolic see&quot;of Rome on one side, and on the other, the idea of a consensus prevailing in the East.&quot; 

A Word About Church History

&quot;Scholars estimate there are over 2600 groups today who lay claim to being the Church, or at least the direct descendants of the Church described in the New Testament. Repeat: 2600!

&quot;But for the first thousand years of her history the Church was essentially one. Five historic Patriarchal centers--Jerusalem; Antioch, Rome, Alexandria, and Constantinople-- formed a cohesive whole and were in full communion with each other. There were occasional heretical or schimatic groups going their own way, to be sure; but the Church was unified until the 11th century. Then, in events culminating in A.D. 1054, the Roman Patriarch pulled away from the other four, pusuing his long-developing claim of universal headship of the Church.

&quot;Today, nearly a thousand years later, the other four Patriarchates remain intact, in full communion, maintaining that Orthodox apostolic faith of the inspired New Testament record. The Orthodox Church and her history is described herein, from the Pentecost to the present day.&quot;

 http://www.saintignatiuschurch.org/timeline.html 

The veneration of the Holy Icons&quot;had been abolished by the energetic measures of Constantine V (741-775) and the Council of Hieria which had described itself as the seventh ecumenical council. These iconoclastic tendencies were shared by his son, Leo IV.&quot;

Vladimir I, Prince of Kiev, in 987, sent out envoys to study various Religions, having done so, exclaimed after attending the Divine Liturgy at Hagia Sophia:&quot; We knew not whether we were in heaven or on earth, for surely there is no such splendour or beauty anywhere upon the earth. We cannot describe it to you: only this we know, that God dwells there among men, and that there service surpasses the worship of all other places. For we cannot forget that beauty. -&quot; Upon which Vladimir became a Christian.

The Seventh Council of Nicea, which was the end of the era of Ecumenical Councils, brought back&quot;the centuries-old use of icons back into the Church in 787, and the final Great Schism occurred in 1054.

Gemistus, who honored Plato by changing his name to Plethon, met with the Great Cosimo ca. 1438, the Academy was founded, Divine Marsilio translated Plato, Plotinus, the Corpus Hermeticum, the Light of Egypt and Greece which Rome had almost extinguished was rekindled shining lichterloh over Europe and England, and the rest is 400 years of our History.

Hallo Steven,

Saint Nicholas, or the good Bishop still knockes on the doors in Germany on the 6th of December, but here has become simply Santa Claus who sometimes slides down the chimney to bring presents. This idea is closely connected with Sylvester and I have been looking for over a week to put a few posts together concerning this Season.

I searched for St. Nicholas of Orthodoxy and found an Icon of the Nativity on the same page, searched for Icons of the Nativity as well, all in the Season.

 http://www.sngoc.org/main.asp 

The one painting you posted of the poor man agreeing to sell his three daughters into slavery may have resonance with the german legend of three innocent men the Saint saved from being put to death.

 Http://www.sngoc.org/orth_info/about_St_Nicholas.asp 

Another legend has it that He calmed the raging sea and the ships reached the harbor safely, indicated by the other painting. But then Saint Nicholas was a Miracle-worker.

The German Saint Nicholas, the good Bishop, has its origin with the historical Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, 4th century, and Bishop of Pinara of the Nicholas Abbey of Sion.

There are many legends couching psychological states, embellish events, or made up for children to keep the good deeds of St. Nicholas alive.

Meanwhile, I&apos;ll keep working on my projects, which would require a reading a Library full of books in one hand, in the other just one.

A great weekend to you and All

Peace be upon Archbishop Job.

My Icon of the Holy Trinity by Rublev tore and I looked for another this morning, and Archbishop Job held it high.


The motive of Selfhood is common to all Being,
the universal Mind informing existence,
and had ther been no beauty in life nor any joy
beyond thatt ground-pleasure, which all creatures may feel,
in the inconscient functionings of their organisms
and satisfaction of instincthad thatt been, ev&apos;n so
nothing had lack&apos;d to inspire the selfassertion of man:
But since there is beauty in nature, mankind&apos;s love of life
apart from love of beauty is a tale of no count;
and tho&apos; he linger&apos;d long in his forest of fear,
or e&apos;er his apprehensiv wonder at unknown power
threw off the first night-terrors of his infant mind,
the vision of beauty awaited him, and step by step
led him in joy of spirit to full fruition.

I just found out today, sorry for the late announcement.

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Dec 21, 2009, 1:18pm

Yesterday, the Church honered St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.

Saint Ambrose was born about 337, and as Bishop of Milan&quot;became one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the fourth century. He is counted as one of the four original doctors of the Church.&quot;Saint Ambroes followed the teachings of Saint Basil the Great, truly Great.

&quot;There is a legend that as an infant, a swarm of bees settled on his face while he lay in his cradle, leaving behind a drop of honey. His father considered this as a sign of his future eloqhence and honeyed tongue. For this reason , bees and beehives often appear in the saint&apos;s symbology.&quot;I love legends.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrose 

The Service at the Cathedral in Alhambra began in a festive atmosphere, it seemed to me, even before the first ringing of the Church Bells, and remained so, engaging the Congregation throughout. At one point I thought of how much this Service differs from the Catholic Mass in pure Latin I attended every Sunday for so long that I had the entire text memorized and by it knew how much longer I had to kneel there on my then aching and very calloused knees.

Father Ceko performed the incensing during the Matins, which begins with Blessings and incensing the Altar, the Figures of Jesus, the Theotokos, St. John and St. Steven, the second officiating Priest, in this case Father Norman, and the Congregation in a swift walk accompanied by Prayer and Petitions along the side and center aisle up to the Altar. Father Norman usually walks from the Altar down the center aisle, round the side, turns and returns the same way back to the Altar.

Father Ceko never fails to mention how fortunate we are, that we should give Thanks to God for the Sun shining, the clean air this time of the year to enjoy the grandeur of the snow-capped mountains, is what I was thinking driving to Alhambra, for every fruit of the earth is available to us year round. Yes, I saw the relatively small&quot;Farmer&apos;s Market&quot;by the Redondo Pier, where every Thursday we can buy real eggs, real tomatoes, grapes, the sweetest strawberries, fregrant parsley and herbs, lemons and sweet oranges so juicy that squeezing 2 with half a lemon I get a full glass. Is your mouth watering Truly, I raise my glass to my Icon in Thankfulness, and moreover, for $2.50 a glass every day for a week.

St. Nicholas was not mentioned, but a reflection from the Prologue from Ochrid was given, in that&quot;God returns a loan hundredfold, when it is lent to Him through the poor&quot;.

A&quot;Christian women was married to a pagan and the lived happy together in love and poverty&quot;. They had&quot;fifty silver pieces&quot;, which the husband wanted to &apos;take to the Bank&apos; to earn interest, but his wife said to lend them to God. The husband asked where God was and the wife said, &apos;I meant to give it to the beggers outside the Church&apos;, which he did. After some time they didn&apos;t have anything to eat and the wife told her husband to go back to the Church to receive the interest on the fifty silver pieces, but he only saw beggers there and walked around the Church in dismay, and lo, he accidentally found a silver coin with which he purchased a fish.

You see, said his wife while cutting the fish open in which&quot;she found a glittering stone&quot;, gave it to her husband who took it to a merchant to see how much he could get for it.&quot;The merchant offered him five silver pieces, and the man began to laugh, thinking that the merchant was joking by offering him such a high price. However, the merchant, thinking that the man was laughing because of the small price he had offered him, then offered him ten, then fifteen, then thirty, then fifty silver pieces. The man, realizing that it was a precious stone, began to hesitate. The merchant raised the price higher and higher until he reached the price of three hundred silver pieces. The man accepted - and went home joyfully&quot;to tell his wife who said,&quot;Do you see how good the Christian God is?&quot;

I probably would have held out and said to the merchant,&quot;It&apos;s either thousand silver pieces or the glittering stone.

The reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke was nice also.

&quot;At that time as Jesus entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off. And the lifted their voices and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!&quot;So when He saw them, He said to them,&quot;Go, show yourselves to the priests.&quot;And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed.&quot;But only one of them saw that he was healed and returned to give Thanks to God. Jesus asked where the other nine were, but they were nowhere to be found, and He said the the one healed,&quot;Arise, go your way. Your faith has made you well.&quot;

Meant are the lepers of the Soul, who should go to the Priests, smiled Father Ceko, but there was also, founded in the 12th century an&quot;Order of St. Lazarus&quot;ministering to lepers. The&quot;Order existed in 369 AD during the papacy of St Damasus I, when St Basil the Great was Archbishop of Caesarea. It is this sainted Archbishop who is considered the legendary Father of the Order by virtue of his founding a large hospital for lepers near Caesarea.&quot;

&quot;Militay and Hospitaller Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusaleman order of chivalry which originated in a leper hospital founded by Knights Hospitaller in the 12th century by the crusaders of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Order of Saint Lazarus is one of the most ancient of the European orders of chivalry. It was originally established to treat the virulent disease of leprosy, its knights originally being lepers themselves. It is one of the less-known and less documented orders.&quot;

The Cross of the Order of Saint Lazarus is the Maltese Cross.

CBS 60 Minutes

Perhaps some people here watched the segment featuring Patriarch Bartholomew, whose official Title is&quot;His All Holiness Bartholomew, Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, Ecumenical Patriarch&quot;, is the Spiritual Leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians. I was happy that millions of people had a chance to become somewhat acquainted with the History of the Church.

&quot;Bartholomew&quot;, as His All Holiness prefers to be called, lives in now Istanbul , Turkey, where the population is 99% Muslim. He lives there,&quot;Because we are here before this country becomes Muslim country, much earlier. Since ever. Since the very beginning - of the foundation of our church, of the Church of Constantinople&quot;.

Mr. Simon:

&quot;The city&apos;s skyline is dominated by minarets&quot;, and&quot;the city&apos;s richest and most renown Christian churches are museums today, Meccas for tourists, not for worshipers. There&apos;s the Chora Church, with its fresco of Jesus whose eyes seem to go right through you, and the Hagia Sophia, the first great church in Christendom and an architectual wonder built 1,000 years before Saint Peter&apos;s Basilica in Rome, and for centuries the most important church in the Christian world.&quot;

&quot;.... treated as second-class citizens here and you are Greek, why don&apos;t you go to Greece?&quot;, as Mr. Simon.

&quot;Because we love our country. We are born here. We want to die here. We feel our mission is here as it has been for 17 entire centuries,&quot;the patriarch explained.&quot;And I wonder why the authorities of our country do not respect this history.&quot;

His All Holiness knows why, pardon me, and so do we.

Mr. Simon:

&quot;To better understand the patriarch&apos;s frustration, he suggested we head off on our own mission , 500 miles east of Istambul to a region called Cappadocia. We launched our search for this Christian history in a hot air ballon and came upon one of the most bizarre and dramatic landscapes on Earth: from above clouds, it looks like a city of stone. And when you approach the cliffs, you see doors and windows carved by hand into the rock eons ago.&quot;

Remembering also that Saint Basil the Great was born in Caesarea, Cappadocia.

&quot;It&apos;s extraordinary enough on the outside, but open one of the doors and step inside and you enter a world of unfathomable beauty. There are chapels with frescos painted while Rome was still ruled by the Caesars and Bethlehem and Nazareth were dusty little towns.&quot;

This spectacular stone-spired landscape and these chapels alone are worthy of watching the segment, easly found under&quot;60 Minutes&quot;on the web.

The Monastery of St. Catherine at the foot of Mt. Sinai, with&quot;an incomparable collection of ancient manuscripts&quot;, dating&quot;from the 10th and 14th century&quot;is shown, as well as&quot;a little-known letter written by the Prophet Mohammed, almost 1,400 years ago, signed and sealed with his hand print, offering protection and religious freedom to the Christians of the Monastery.&quot;

Simon asked:

&quot;Do you sometimes fear that the community (in Istanbul) will be wiped out?&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot;the patriarch replied.&quot;We survived. We do believe in miracles&quot;, Turkey is also a Holy Land, a&quot;continuation of Jerusalem&quot;.

I hope you had a good weekend as well.

It&apos;s rare for Orthodoxy to get such good mention,(or ANY mention at all, for that matter...) in the media.

My youngest son, John has a cross given to him for his Baptism by his God-parents which they had blessed by His All Holiness Patriarch Bartholomew.

For those celebrating Christmas soon according to the Gregorian calendar,
The True meaning of Christmas:

Our God has come in the flesh and dwelt among us!

This is the cornerstone of our faith. From this follows all else-such as:

God became a Human being so that Human beings may become like God.

This is the whole reason for engaging in the spiritual life.

Jesus is not only provides the MEANS for us to regain our lost&quot;Likeness&quot;to God, He is the EXAMPLE of what that would be like for us.

He is the,&quot;First-born among many brethren.&quot;

Being acclimated to Classical Music, Walz&apos; etc, I barely remember Elvis, whose songs I did not like much or play. My love for music other began with the Beatles, so here is my favorite secular Christmas song

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUCbZhIfQbA 

Nativity of the Orthodox Church, the&quot;Hidden Pearl&quot;, reminiscent of the glittering stone the wife of the pagan found in the fish her husband purchased with the silver coin he found walking around the Church, and converted to Christianity, celebrates the Feast of Nativity on the 25th of December, though not entirely.

 Today, the Virgin bears Him who is transcendent,
and the earth presents the cave to Him who is beyond reach.
Angels, along with shepherds glorify Him.
The Magi make their way to Him by a star.
For a new child has been born for us,
the God before all ages.

If you like, click on&quot;Images Fortold By The Prophets&quot;, and&quot;A Power Point Presentation&quot;. Nice and unusual Icons and paintings.

The mystery of the Incarnation is a fitting theme for the joy both to the angels and to men.

&quot;Therefore the Word of God, Himself God, the Son of God who&quot;in the beginning was with God,&quot;through whom&quot;all things were made&quot;and&quot;without&quot;whom&quot;nothing was made,&quot;with the purpose of delivering man from eternal death, and became man: so bending Himself to take on Him our humility without decrease in His own majesty, that remaining what He was and assuring what He was not, He might unite the true form of a slave to that form in which He is equal to God the Father, and join both natures together by such a compact that the lower should not be swallowed up in its exaltation nor the higher impaired by its own associate. Without detriment therefore to the properties of either substance which then came together in one person, majesty took on humility, strenght weakness, eternity mortality: and for the paying off of the dept, belonging to our condition, inviolable nature, and true God and true man were combined to form one Lord, so that, as suited the needs of our case, one and the same Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, could both die with the one and rise again with the other.&quot;

Some say that ever &apos;gainst that season comes
Wherin our Saviour&apos;s birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallowed and so gracious is the time.

Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht,

was my favorite, Christmas Eve, in my childhood, when many of the towns people shivering from the cold, stopped at our Home with front door open, next to the Church, to warm themselves with a Stamperl of Schnaps, which my Father supplied from our store. When some got to happy and wouldn&apos;t leave, my Father would take the kitchen door off the hinges which solved the problem.

Christmas good times, a humorous bunch then, I never heard those before. Where I live it&apos;s so quiet you could hear a mouse stirring, everyone &apos;s having Turkey and getting ready to break down the doors at the Mall at 4 AM in need of more presents, though much Good Will was evident and manifested everywhere. I trust you and your Family had a wonderful Christmas.

Reading more on the larger than Life Saint Chrysostom, I found an encyclical on the occasion of the 1600 anniversary of the Accession to the Throne of Constantinople of Saint John Chrysotom by

 Bartholomew 

BY THE MERCY OF GOD ARCHBISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE
NEW ROME AND ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH
UNTO THE ENTIRE PLENTITUDE OF THE CHURCH
GRACE BE ONTO YOU AND PEACE FROM
OUR SAVIOR CHRIST
AND FROM US
BLESSINGS, BENEDICTION AND FORGIVENESS

Beloved Children in the Lord,

On the occasion of this sacred feast, which must not pass unobserved, we bring to you, by way of this Encyclical Letter, a godly greeting replete with spiritual joy. For what we are observing is nothing less than the 1600th anniversary of the accession to the most venerable Archiepicopal and Ecumenical Throne of Constantinople, in the year of our Lord 398, of our father among the Saints, John Chrysostom.

Inasmuch our humble person has been granted by the grace of God the honor and responsibility to accede to this same Martyric Throne and to be a successor of such a Saint of God, and inasmuch as&quot;grace has shone forth from the lips of Chrysostom enlightening the world like a brilliant beacon,&quot;we feel that this anniversary should be observed as a truly ecumenical celebration with godly festivities. Therefore, we desired with all our heart to honor this anniversary and share our joy with you. Even now, by divine grace we find this grace-filled and holy Archbishop of Constantinople still present in his See and in the world! He still enlightens the personal life of each and every faithful Christian and he still directs the worldwide Church of Christ. Already this year, through the Patriarchal Declaration for Pascha, we conveyed just some of the strenght and light that comes from the resurrectional joy that filled the heart of the golden-mouthed Saint and is preached through his Catechetical Homily on the Holy Pascha.

Today, remembering his enthronement, we are filled with the same paschal joy and gladness. If we call to mind his whole life, and the way he conducted his life from beginning to end, it shines like a journey of light. Indeed, his way of speaking truly and brilliantly golden, illuminates the very heavens. Truly, the appearance of such a shining star of this magnitute in the firmament of the Church is a blessing from God.

St. John Chrysostom was reared in a Christian home in Antioch and was well-versed in the full range of Greek learning, or paideia. But he was drawn into the grace of the Church and offered himself completely to it. At the age of eighteen, he was baptized. At the age of twenty-one, he was tonsured a reader. After this, he retired into the wilderness and lived close to his Geronta, his spiritual elder, for four years. His spiritual ascetic discipline was prolonged and intensified for two years by living alone in a cave. He returned from his askesis having ruined his physical health, but having renewed his mind and spirit.

At the age of twenty-two, he was ordained a deacon; at thirty-two a priest. And for twelve years he shone as the most brilliant star of the Church of Antioch. And when the Throne of the Imperial Capital was widowed, he was chosen to be Archbishop of Constantinople.

To be continued

Concerning St. Herman I read this morning:

&quot;On Tuesday, August 4, 1970, the 91st Congress of the United States, acknowledged the Glorification of St. Herman of Alaska with a speech in the Senate, and his biography was formerly entered into the Congressional Records, Vol. 116, No. 133&quot;.

In my Boar&apos;s Head post yesterday, I wrote about the chaos in Washington DC, the Senate and House of Representatives, and the&quot;Progressive Members&quot;thereof, relating to Lord Bacon&apos;s Motto,&quot;Let us, instructed by Divine Providence, follow on to better days&quot;, and what better days set forth by the Ideas and Ideals of the Forefathers, Students of Lord Bacon, whom they shamelessly quote for their own gain, all having descended to the ugliest common denomenator,&quot;crawl greedily on their knees nosing the soil like swine&quot;, impelling their ignorant Constituents to till it, alas, I deleted the paragraph.

The Glorious Saints

At best I have a good overview of St. Herman of Alaska and St. Spyridon of Corfu, the latter I feel closer to for obvious reasons. It is hard to concentrate on one of the myriad of Saints who come to my attention. I also wish to read St. Chrysotom&apos;s Writings and more of the Areopagite. Remembering Groucho&apos;s cart.

Continuance of the Letter by His All Holiness Bartholomew, current Archbishop of Contsantinople

&quot;As a Church leader he (St. Chrysostom) was inspired, organizing and giving new life to the Church. He preached. He taught. He inspired and led the youth. He cared for the poor and disadvantaged. He remembered the infirm and the aged. He organized missions. He harmonized the liturgical life of the Church. The glory of his presence soon spilled over the boundries of the Imperial Capital. He was shown to be a Teacher of and for the whole world. The elegance of his language ows much to his own cultivation of a natural talent, but above else, to an abundance of divine enlightenment.

His heart, cleansed and purified, was revealed to be an unfailing fountain of the flowing waters of the Spirit. He did not use the words with affection. He did not embellish them with flourishes. He was gifted by Heaven itself.

For he gave to God without measure even from his youth, such that divine grace was lavished upon him in return. He spoke from his heart. His speech was unrestained, even torrential, full of substance as well as charm, deep and weighty, but plain-speaking; clear and to the point, but comforting.

As a Preacher, he was not very tall, of slight built, humble and meager. But he was Chrysostom, whose words flowed like honey, known as the greatest speaker, the greatest rhetorician, in history, and before whom the greatest public speakers of every nation seem like novices. He exceeds human rhetorical ability and even the best efinements of the Attic tongue, because his whole inner person was raging with the powerful fire of the Holy Spirit. He gladdened the hearts of those melted by sorrow. He touched the whole world. He stirred up stagnant waters of indolence. He challenged mean and small-minded people.

All of his sermons, his speeches, his essays and letters spring up like living fountains within the spacious and gracious spirit of the Divine Liturgy. He wrought improvements on the existing liturgical offering that came from the Apostolic and subsequent ages. Thus, he molded the Divine Liturgy, which from that time has borne his name: the Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom. All the Orthodox Churches celebrate this liturgy throughout the year, except for specific occasions.

This Divine Liturgy graces the Orthodox ethos and lifestyle in every aspect of the Church. It liberates us as human persons and constitutes us as a liturgical community. It hints at the joy of the Kingdom which is to come and it comforts us in the midst of earthly trails and adversities. We can truly say that his life&apos;s halo, the radiance of Chrysostom&apos;s presence is the blessing of the Divine Liturgy. Through the Liturgy, we know him and he abides with us unto eternity.

Therefore, when on the Eve of Pascha in the year 404, his persecutors arrested the holy Chrysostom, in order to deprive him of the joy of the Resurrection, the feast of feasts, they showed their own ignorance and barbarism. They had not understood that he had already fulfilled his life&apos;s purpose. He had articulated that great Catechetical Homily on the Holy Pascha in the expression of his own life! He had completely translated it into the reality of his person. He had already been transposed into the joy, of the Resurrection. He had been translated from death to life. His whole life had become the word of God. He had become that Homily on the Resurrection, that imparts salvation to hungry and thirsty souls desiring to know the word of God.

Therefore, when they arrested Chrysostom, they tried in vain to take his inner freedom and imprison his spirit. And when they exiled him, they still did not understand that he, as one who loved and was beloved of all, would find love everywhere. His spiritual children found him, even in exile at the end of the known world.

And when his persecutors tried to send him into an even crueler and harsher exile, he expired along the way. And from that moment on, he lived and lives free and unhindered with all the Saints in Heaven. Exhausted by his pastoral labors and ascetic discipline, his body yielded. And his sanctified spirit was raised up to the Kingdom that is above on the 14th day of September, the day of the Exaltation of the Precious Cross.

Indeed, behold the joy that comes into all the world through the Exaltatation of the Precious Cross. Behold the joy that comes into all the world through the exaltation of this most charismatic preacher of the Church, this most beloved Saint, this most prolific Church Father, and this most eagerly read by the faithful of the Church.

His last breath shaped the summation of all his preaching in this one eucharistic phrase:&quot;Glory to God for all things!&quot;Beloved Brethren in Christ, Let us worthily celebrate this anniversary, the enthronement of the great Saint John Chrysostom, who, seated on the Throne of Constantinople gave joy to the whole world. And he is yet seated on that throne, for he is enthroned in the hearts of the faithful.

The whole divine activity of Chrysostom&apos;s life was a revelation of the Divine Liturgy. We now have this Divine Liturgy, both here in Constantinople and throughout the world as a bulwark, as illumination, as protection - in both times of sorrow and times of joy. And whenever we find ourselves chocking in the iron grip of an external captivity, through the Divine Liturgy we are revealed to be totally free! And whenever we travel throughout the world, through the Divine Liturgy we find ourselves to be the same. Through the Divine Liturgy, we are conscious of our personal duty and the substance of our ecumenical service as the first Throne of the Orthodox Church. Through the Divine Liturgy, all of us can perceive the power of faith and be initiated into the mystery of the Love that creates and sustains the world.

And through the intercession of our father among Saints, John Chrysostom, the Archbishop of Constantinople, may the gracce of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.

BARTHOLOMEW OF CONSTANTINOPLE

This sincere tribute to Saint Chrysostom not only informs of many things, but also gives a glimpse into the Mind of His All Holiness Bartholomew, which was not apparent in the 15 minutes of the&quot;60 Minutes&quot;interview. Even so, a good overview of the Church was given, surely appreciated by Orthodox Christians, as well, methinks, by all true-blue viewers of the Program.

Happiness, which all seek, is not composable
of any summation of particular pleasure;
the happiness in marriage dependeth fore-sure
not on the animal function, but on qualities
of spirit and mind that are correlated therewith.
So &apos;twas not of false ethick or weak prudery
when thatt old Hebrew poet, in his mighty myth
of man&apos;s creation, imagin&apos;d Eve&apos;s predestiny
to be helpmate and comfort to God&apos;s perfect man;
nor in that syrange fashion of her from Adam&apos;s rib
fudged he his symbol; perfect man being in thatt theft
imperfected by loss of an original part
now personate in Eve, of whom he should require
what was in the first design confused in his nature,
and from thatt fleshly cleavage find true tally of flesh.
This myth was the law to th&apos; Jew, and &apos;twas men of their clan
(those same Essenes whose creed prevail&apos;d so long),
who, when Christ&apos;s mournful company wer by his death
reft of their earthly dreams, took courage and reset
their disillusion&apos;d hope bolderto look no more
for Rome and Caesar&apos;s overthrow, but rather expect
Jahveh&apos;s wrathful dissolution of all creation;
that Christ would reappear in pitiless Godhead
full suddenly and full soon, to judge the world of sin,
and with his angels gather-up his living elect
to his new Jerusalem, those few Saints undefiled,
who had wash&apos;d their robes to whiteness in the blood o&apos; the Lamb. 
Now those stern Puritans who liv&apos;d but in thatt faith,
in who motiv and lure of breed wer wholly extinct,
execrating the body as other men flee death,
had no fear of contamination nor thought of ill
in taking women in marriage, each man one to himself,
as comrades indispensable, of spiritual aid.

I read on St. Herman of Alaska and St. Spyridon concerning the date Decmber 25. Dates are specific as to events in the Saints lives, and either the Gregorian or Julian Calendar, which the Orthodox Church adheres to.

Five Priests attended the Festivities yesterday commemorating the

FEAST OF THE HOLY FOREFATHERS

Father Ceko added,&quot;and Foremothers&quot;.

Father Ceko spoke of King Steven the First Crowned, who was tonsured a Monk and given the name&quot;Simon&quot;by His Brother Sava, Archbishop and&quot;great enlightener&quot;of Serbia, who also crowned King Steven. Simon was also the former name of St. Peter, and remembering that St. Alban bid Simcot as&quot;Simon&quot;to come and worship by His shrine and the Saint will help him.

December 27, is also

THE SECOND SUNDAY BEFORE THE NATIVITY
OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR, JESUS CHRIST

Special hymns for the day are, and hearing

RESURRECTIONAL TROPARION

&quot;When the women disciples of the Lord learned from the angel the joyous message of Your Resurrection; the cast away the ancestral curse and elatedly told the apostles:
Death is overthrown! Christ God is Risen, granting the world mercy.&quot;

Holy Forefathers Troparion

&quot;Through faith You justified the Forefathers, betrothing through them the Church of the gentiles. These saints exult in glory, for from their seed came forth a glorious fruit: She who bore You without seed. So by their prayers, O Christ God, have mercy on us!&quot;

HOLY FOREFATHERS KONTAKION

&quot;You did not worship the graven image, O trice-blessed ones, but armed with the immaterial Essence of God, you were glorified in a trail by fire. From the midst of unbearable flames you called on God, crying: Hasten, O compassionate One! Speedily come to our aid, for You are merciful and able to do as You will.&quot;

An infant was baptized into the fold of the Church by water and fire. The Sacrament of Confession was offered for the second Sunday, in which People simply walk up to the Priest waiting close to the Altar, and it seems to me, are absolved and blessed with the Holy Cross.

A memorial Service was held for His Holiness, Patriarch Pavle, who died recently, including highlights from the life of the saintly Patriarch.

Christmas Eve is referred to as&quot;Paramony&quot;or preperation in Orthodoxy, a day of strict fasting. Interesting is

&quot;In the evening, the All-Night Vigil for the Feast of the Nativity is composed of Great Compline, Matins and the First Hour. The Orthodox services of Christmas Eve are intentionally parallel to those of Good Friday, illustrating the theological point that the purpose of the Incarnation was to make possible the Crucifixion and Resurrection. This is illustrated in Prthodox Icons of the Nativity, on which the Christ Child is wrapped in swaddling clothes reminiscent of his burial wrappings. The child is also shown laying on a stone, representing the Tomb of Christ, rather than a manger. The Cave of the Nativity is also a reminder of the cave in which Jesus was buried.

&quot;The services of Christmas Eve are also similar to those of the Eve of Theophany (Epiphany), and the two Great Feasts are considered one celebration.

&quot;Orthodox Christians observe a festal period of twelve days, during which no one in the Church fasts, even on Wednesdays and Fridays, which are normal fasting days throughout the year. During this time one feast leads into another. December 25-31 is the afterfeast of the Nativity; January 1 is the Feast of the Circumcicion; January 2-5 is the forefeast of the Epiphany.&quot;

Reminiscent of the Twelve Nights Christmas Revelries of Elizabeth&apos;s Court.

One should put off, or worship no idols, which are attributes of ourselves given forms and names, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language; not lie to one another since we begin a New Year, and pay off all our depts as was the Celts&quot;New Year Resolution&quot;.

I mentioned before that my place in the Church is close to a painting of the Wedding Feast at Canaan, in which Mary Magdalene, a wreath of flowers in her hair, pours water into earthen vessels, a smiling Jesus blessing Her. Looking at it again yesterday, I noticed a servant bringing a Roasted Duck to the waiting Guests seated at the Feast Table. Strange how many things are in a painting and withdrawn from one&apos;s perception until a certain time.

Happy Twelve Days of Christmas!

I. Idiotic Robots

We are like idiotic robots plagued by bugs in our programs. We are slaves in bondage to conditioned responses dictated to us from below the level of our conscious awareness where we cant even get at them to try to change them. We are creatures of habit. We cant help but do the same stupid things over and over again.



Who will save us from ourselves and this steady march toward death?



Its easy enough to observe within ourselves the workings of this syndrome. What is more difficult is to do anything about it, to actually change our habits. As a matter of fact, its difficult to conceive of a state of being without our habits. We have gotten used to them. We are familiar with them. We are even comfortable with them,(most of the time) They define who we are. Who would we be and what would our life be like without them?



We cant really picture it. Life would be boring. Our habits, for the most part, are the only source of fun, comfort and consolation we have in an otherwise bleak existence. There would simply be nothing worth living for without our habits. And, on one level, this of course would be true. If what we have become familiar with and what we see on the surface around us were all that there is, what would really be the point of changing anything?



But what if there were another level, a better life that we were capable of living, a life that would be more fulfilling, more engaging, more interesting, more pleasant even. A life that would make us truly happy without the cost of the inevitable downsides inextricably linked to our present sources of temporary happiness?

That might be worth changing for.



But we cant believe in it. Its not obvious. We cant see any examples of it. If it exists at all, its hidden from us. Wed have to dig for it. And besides all of that, when it comes down to it, were addicted to our old way of life and couldnt change, even if we wanted to. This is the state we find ourselves in.



And yet, there is something inside of us that knows better, some kind of Second Sight which sees better, that yearns for that better life it knows certainly exists. It is a still, small voice, most often drowned out and shouted down by the world that convinces us otherwise, the undeniable, disordered cravings of our fallen flesh, which we dare not deny, and the subtle whisperings of the Devil, tempting us with forbidden fruit.



Who can stand against such an army of adversaries ranged against us? Especially when the attack comes at us from places that we are not usually paying attention to? Before we even know whats happening, we are blindsided once again and taken down into the dirt. Oh, sure, we are familiar with the triggers, the things that send us off down that well worn path we are so used to going down. But we never seem to be quick enough to catch them, to recognize them before they can get their hooks into us and drag us down into hell alive.



And, again, who would really want to? Why bother? What else could there possibly be to life anyway? This is as good as it gets! Lets make the most out of a bad deal! Go for the gusto! What else indeed?



This is the first, and perhaps, the only real obstacle to living the spiritual life-conceiving in the first place of the possibility that there might actually be a better life available to us.



If we can only once get a taste of this better life we might be willing to stand up and fight for it. We might be willing to want that better life, which is what it takes, because, after all, we always get what we want, dont we? Or die trying, anyway. It has been said that, if we had faith the size of a mustard seed, we could move mountains.



2. Icebergs with Diamonds



We are like icebergs with a diamond, frozen into the center of it, down below the water line. We are only conscious of what is going on at the surface, above the water, but we are being acted upon, influenced by, and dictated to, by the other seven tenths below the water. We are at cross purposes with our selves. We have contradictory prayers going on which cause interference and produce nothing but a distorted image. The signal coming to us from our diamond is weak and easily reasoned away by louder and more authoritative voices.



We need something warm to melt the ice which entraps us, something to bring to the surface and dissolve away the many, complex determinisms, which force us into the same unworkable patterns, over and over again. Something warm to free the diamond inside of us and allow it to rise to the surface and inform us as it once did. Oh yes, we used to be all diamond at one time and this is what we sense, in our better moments, hidden and frozen beneath the surface, our half-remembered better self, our true nature, our Divine birthright, now lost and forgotten.

It is a bitter and cruel state of amnesia we suffer from, forcing us to forget who and what we really are, giving us no choice but to construct another identity for ourselves, divorced from who we once were. Like a Prince and heir of Kings, now a beggar, wandering, lost, lonely, in hunger and cold, with no idea of the Kingdom which is really ours.



Oh for something warm to free us from this cold imprisonment!



Our God is an all-consuming fire, which purifies and illumines those who love Him, while burning up the chaff of those who cling to their falsehoods and illusions. To abide in the warmth of this all-consuming fire is a most beneficial state that is known by many names-The prayer of the heart-Contemplative prayer-The practice of the presence of God-The Sabbath rest- a most beneficial state which we seldom take the time to cultivate. This is not surprising since our three common enemies do everything in their power to keep us too busy with our necessities or too distracted with our various entertainments to bother with it.



However, to open ourselves up to the presence of God, to expose ourselves entirely to this presence, to, Quench not the spirit and abide in the presence of God, is to set out on a path of healing, purification and illumination which uncovers the diamond within us and leads to Deification-which is to be God-like and like God. We are gods by grace. What God is by nature, we become by virtue of being united with Him.

This is our true nature. This is what calls to us from the depths of our being: We are created to be one with God, and yet, to retain our own, unique individuality at the same time. This is the diamond frozen within us, being withheld from us, lacking only the warmth of the presence of God to restore us entirely to our original blessed state. It is ours for the asking, if only we can remember to ask, not just once, but always and without ceasing.

Saint Sylvester

Icons of St. Sylvester, pope of Rome, apparantly venerated by both Catholics and Orthodox Christians.

 http://www.allmercifulsavior.com/icons/Icons-Sylvester.htm 

St. Sylvester, abbot of Obnora, Russia

&quot;.... lived in the 14th century. No detailed account of St. Sylvester&apos;s life has survived. - After building a small cell, the Holy Hermit began to spend his days and nights in unceasing prayer and strict fasting.

&quot;As abbot, Venerable St. Sylvester showed the brethren a constant example of monastic struggle and tireless labor. A love of silence remained dear to the spiritual struggling heart. From time to time, he would leave the monastery and go deep into the forest to pray in solitute. St. Sylvester dug four wells there with his own hands; in the 19th Century, one of them was still known as an object of veneration.

 http://www.stjohndc.org/Russian/saints/e_0506.htm 

A search for the origin of the name Sylvester gave: root Silva=woods or forest, he who lives in the woods, he who belongs in the woods. Whether this has relation to the Venerable Abbot Sylvester, I don&apos;t know.

&quot;A strange and glorious mystery do I see&quot;

Saint John Chrysostom

Anonymous Russian Illumination Icon

 http://www.chrysostom.org/images/chrysostom8.jpg 

Saint Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople, and one of the Three Hierarchs of Orhodoxy, is celebrated today, December 30, January 27, and January 30.

&quot;The following letter is added as a specimen, out of a very large number, of the natural, almost playful style, and tone of warm affection, in which Chrysostom wrote to his intimate friends. All his exant letters were written during his exile, and therefore there is much repetition in their content, and great similarity of character.&quot;

 TO CASTUS, VALERIUS, DIOPHANTUS, CYRIASUS 

 PRESBYTERS OF ANTIOCH 

&quot;I am not surprised that you call my long letters a short one. For this is just the way with lovers, they do not recognize such a thing as satiety, they will not admit such a thing as satisfaction, but the more they receive from the object of their love the more they seek. Therefore, even if the letter which you have received had been ten times as large as the former one, it would not have escaped the epithet of&quot;brief,&quot;in fact, it would have been called a small letter, and not only would it have been so called, but it would have actually seemed such in your eyes.

&quot;Hence I also in my turn am never satisfied with the measure of affection for me which you have attained, but am always seeking to make additions to your love-draught, and daily demanding the discharge of your love dept which is always being paid, and yet is always owing (for it is writte,&quot;owe no man anything but to love one another&quot;) I am indeed continually receiving what I ask in great abundance, yet never think that I have received the whole.

Do not cease then to pay down this goodly dept, which has a twofold pleasure. For those who pay, and those who receive, derive equal enjoyment, inasmuch as they are both alike enriched by the payment; which in the case of money is an impossibility, for there the one who pays becomes poorer, and only the man who receives becomes richer. But this is not what commonly happens in the covenant of love. For he who pays is not less bereft of it, as in the case of money when it is transferred to the receiver; but payment of love makes him who pays richer than before.

&quot;Knowing these things then, O Sirs, most honoured and devout, cease not continually displaying this excellent disposition towards me. For allthough you need no exhortation for this purpose from me yet as I greatly long for your love I remind you, even when you need it not, both in order that you may constantly write to me, and also inform me of the state of your health. For even if you do not need anyone to remind you on this account, I shall not desist from continually seeking this at your hands; as it is a matter which I have very much at heart. That it is a difficult task owing both to the season of the year, and the difficulty of the journey, and the scarcity of travellers who will do this service for you I am well aware: Nevertheless as far as is possible and predictable in the midst of such difficulty, we exhort you to write constantly, and crave this favour from your love.&quot;

This is one continuous letter which I set in paragraphs for easier reading. Noteworthy is also the relaxed and easy style of writing and content, unlike our time where no one has time to read more than 4 lines, though I read that people are dropping twitter like a hot potato as they can&apos;t make salad with the huge bowl full they already have.

&quot;This beautiful and comprehensive prayer, which is translated from the Liturgy of St. Chrysotom, has made his name a household word wherever the Anglican Liturgy is known and used&quot;

&quot;Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplications unto Thee; and doest promise, that when two or three are gathered together in Thy name thou wilt grant their requests: fulfil now, O Lord, the desires and petitions of Thy servants, as may be most expedient for them; granting us in this world knowledge of Thy truth, and in the world to come life everlasting, Amen.&quot;

The Blue Moon so still as if watching our Planet.

In a German translation, Saint Chrysostom is called&quot;a Relative of the Heart&quot;.

St. Chrysostom on the&quot;Placebo&quot;, communicating with another of the Three Hierarchs

&quot;ST. BASIL:&quot;But none of these cases apply to me: for I am not an enemy, nor one of those who are strifing to injure thee, but quite the contrary. For I entrusted all my interests to your judgement, and always followed it whenever you bid me.

&quot;CHRYSOSTOM: But my admirable and excellent Sir, this is the very reason I took precaution of saying that it was a good thing to employ this kind of deceit, not only in war, and in dealing with enemies, but also in peace, and in dealing with our dearest friends. For as a proof that it is beneficial not only to the deceivers, but also to those who are being deceived, if you go to any of the physicians and ask them how they relieve their patience from disease, they will tell you that they do not depend upon their professional skill alone, but sometimes conduct the sick to health by availing themselves of deceit, and blending the assistance which they derive from it with their art. For when the waywardness of a patient and the obstinacy of the complaint baffle the counsels of the physicians, it is then necessary to put on the mask of deceit in order that, as on the stage, they may be able to hide what really takes place. But if you please, I will relate to you one instance of stratagem out of many which I have heard of being contrived by the sons of the healing art. *

&quot;A man was once suddenly attacked by a fever of great severity; the burning heat increased, and the patient rejected the remedies which could have reduced it and craved for a draught of pure wine, passionately entreating all who approached to give it to him to satiate this deadly cravingI say deadly, for if anyone had gratified this request he would not only have exasperated the fever, but also have driven the unhappy man frantic. Thereupon, professional skill being baffled, and at the end of its resources and utterly thrown away, stratagem stepped in and displayed its power in the way I will now relate.

&quot;For the physician took an earthen cup brought straight out of the furnace, and having steeped it in wine, then drew it out empty, filled it with water, and, having ordered the chamber where the sick man lay to be darkened with curtains that the light may not reveal the trick, he gave it (to?) him to drink, pretending that it was filled with undiluted wine. And the man, before he had taken it in his hands, being deceived by the smell, did not wait to examine what was given to him, but convinced by the odor, and deceived by the darkness, eagerly gulped down the draught, and being satiated with it immediately shook off the feeling of suffocation and escaped the imminent peril.

&quot;Do you see the advantage of deceit? And if anyone were to reckon up all the tricks of physicians the list would run on to an indefinite lenght. And not only those who heal the body but also those who attend to the diseases of the soul may be found continually making use of this remedy.

&quot;Thus the blessed Paul attracted those multitudes of Jews: with this purpose he circumcised Timothy, although he warned the Galatians in his letter that Christ would not profit those who were circumcised. For this cause he submitted to the law, although he reckoned the righteousness which came from the law but loss after receiving the faith in Christ. For great is the value of deceit, provided it be not introduced with a mischievous intention. In fact action of this kind ought not to be called deceit, but rather a kind of good management, cleverness and skill, capable of finding out ways where resources fail, and making up for the defects of the mind.&quot;

The illuminated&quot;Father of the Church&quot;.

We would call this &apos;as above so below&apos;, how old and whence the Placebo practice?

There are two footnotes for the Reader:

*&quot;Literally,&quot;sons of physicians.&quot;Compare the expression&quot;sons of the prophets&quot;in the Old Testament.&quot;

&quot;Clement of Alexandria (Stromata vii.) illustrates the same doctrine of allowable deceit for a useful purpose by a similar reference to the practice of physicians.&quot;

It is no secret that all writers of Sacred Mysteries practiced deceit as described by St. Chrysostom, or as Hamlet said,&quot;it is as easy as lying&quot;.

Today, Sylvester, for people who live in timelessness one day is as the next filled with their own purpose of Life, and to all the world who celebrate New Year&apos;s Eve by calendar and great revelries with Family and Friends, abundant Blessings and a good life in Gesundheit.

There was a New Years Greeting by St. Chrysostom which is hard to find among the Saints prolific Writings, which Commentators deem&quot;simple and useful&quot;, and remind me of my Phi-Teacher saying that direct teaching prompts resentment.

Icon of Saint Chrysostom between the Archangels Michael and Gabriel

 http://www.chrysostom.org/images/chrysostom17.jpg 

Continuing the letter to St. Basil concerning deceit as&quot;a kind of good management&quot;to heal defects of the Body and Soul, as is also told via myths and legends such as a Ruler slaying 10,000 enemies in one night while sitting in his sattle on a horse.

&quot;For I would not call Phinees a murderer, although he slew two human beings with one stroke: nor yet Elias after the slaughter of the 100 soldiers, and the captain, and the torrents of blood which caused to be shed by the distruction of those who sacrificed to devils. For if we were to concede this, and to examine the bare deeds in themselves apart from the intention of the doers, one might if he pleased judge Abraham guilty of child-murder, and accuse his grandson and descendant of wickedness and guile. For the one got possesion of the birthright, and the other transferred the wealth of the Egyptians to the host of the Israelites. But this is not the case: away with the audacious thought! For we not only aquit them of blame, but also admire them because of these things, since even God commended them for the same. For that man would fairly deserve to be called a deceiver who made an unrighteous use of the practice, not one who did so with a solutary purpose. And often it is necessary to deceive, and to do the greatest benefits by means of this device, whereas he who has gone by a straight course has done great mischief to the person whom he has not deceived.&quot;

Truly, this is just what my Phi-Teacher meant, who once said that later, when we remember what he taught, we will understand why he rejected any Title and would not teach in Universities.

So what of the Doctors of&quot;Bible Study&quot;of our Uni&apos;s and Colleges here in America and England? During the Holidays, I watched a Program on the&quot;two Mary&apos;s&quot;, the Mother of God, and Mary Magdalene, and interpretations were as many as Explainers. How times have changed, how women in the Church assert their rights, how one Lady was sure that Mary, the unwed Mother of God, probably not looked upon as virtuous at the time by the towns people, and Joseph then took her under his wings to protect her, but the Lady was sure there were other young girls who supported her during her pregnancy etc.

How Mary Magdalene was either the wife or Companion of Jesus, had children and carried on His bloodline, or a fallen women who repented by drying His feet with Her Hair. Several persons brought up the Nag Hammadi Library, in which is stated this and the other, but had doubts about it and all the rest. It states things pretty clearly.

Anyway, how can this be with so much Knowledge available to People who spend their Life investigating these things, keeping their readers and listeners either confused or pick the interpretation they like the best even if it doesn&apos;t make any sense.

Hope you enjoy the Swans

Saint Chrysostom

 http://www.chrysostom.org/images/chrysostom18.jpg 

AGAINST PUBLISHING THE ERRORS OF THE BRETHREN

 Upon the not publishing the errors of the Brethren, not uttering imprecations upon enemies. 

1. I ACCOUNT you happy for the zeal, beloved, with which you flock into the Father&apos;s house. For from this zeal I have ground for feeling confidence about your health also with respect to the soul; for indeed the school of the Church is an admirable surgerya surgery, not for bodies, but for souls. For it is spiritual, and set right, not fleshly wounds, but errors of the mind,* and wounds the medicine is the word. This medicine is compounded, not from herbs growing in the ground, but from the word proceeding from heaventhis no hands of physicians, but tongues of preachers have dispensed.

&quot;On this account it lasts right through; and neither is its virtue impaired by lenght of time, nor defeated by any strenght of diseases. For certainly the medicines of the physicians have both these defects; for while they are fresh they display their proper strenght, but when much time has passed; just as those bodies which have grown old; they become weaker; and often too the difficult character of maladies is wont to baffle them; since they are but human. Whereas the divine medicine is not such as this; but after much time has intervened, it still retains all its inherent virtue.

&quot;Ever since at least Moses was born (for from thence dates the beginning of the Scripture) it has healed so many human beings; and not only has it not lost its proper power, but neither has any disease ever yet overcome it. This medicine it is not possible to get by payment of silver; but he who has displayed sincerity of purpose and disposition goes his way having it all. On the account of this both rich and poor alike obtain the benefit of this healing process. For where there is a necessity to pay down money the man of large means indeed shares the benefit; but the poor man often has to go away deprived of the gain, since his income does not suffice him for the making up of the medicine.&quot;

Sayeth Rush yesterday upon being released from the hospital in Hawaii,&quot;I feel fine, I had the best care in the world, there is absolutely nothing wrong with our Healthcare System&quot;. Sorry, had to say it.

&quot;But in this case, since it is not possible to pay down (with?) silver coins, but it is needful to display faith and good purpose, he who has payed down these with forwardness of mind, this is he who most reaps the advantage; since indeed these are the price paid for the medical treatment. And the rich and the poor man share the benefits alike; or rather it is not alike that they share the benefit, but often the poor man goes away in the enjoyment of more. Whatever can be the reason?

&quot;It is because the rich man, possessed beforehand of many thoughts, having the pride and puffed-up temper belonging to wealthiness; living with carelessness and lazy ease as companions, receives the medicine of the hearing of the Scriptures not with much attention, nor with much earnestness, but the poor man, far removed from delicate living and gluttony and indolence, spending all his time in handycraft and honest labours, and gathering hence much love of wisdom for the soul; becomes thereby more attentive and free from slackness, and is wont to give his mind with more accurate care to all that is said: whence also, inasmuch as a price he has payed is higher, the benefit which he departs having reaped is greater.&quot;

Perhaps, the benefit which he reaped and departs with is greater.

*&quot;In Crysostom&apos;s equivalent to the voice of St. Paul; the moral and spiritual mind, missing of the mark: errors of the moral will.&quot;

My first thought about&quot;the rich man, possessed beforehand by many thoughts, having the pride and puffed-up temper belonging to wealthyness....&quot;, Saint Chrysostom meant preconceived notions and pride belonging to the wealth of information one has gathered, references of &apos;knowledge&apos; one already has in the mind. Such was my preconceived notion, but I think both examples can be applied.

We know that&quot;divine medicine&quot;, even&quot;after much time&quot;, sometimes always with us,&quot;still retains its inherent virtue&quot;, by experience of an Inner Sight delighting us&quot;plentifully&quot;, or a moment of supreme happiness transcending all the worlds.

While in such play Count Raymond&apos;s folk lived joyfully,

Yesterday, the Sunday before the Nativity, and Feast of the Holy Fathers. Fr Ceko mentioned Saint Chrysotom and St. Stephen the Protomartyr, whose Feast is next Saturday.

PREFEAST OF THE NATIVITY OF CHRIST TROPARION

&quot;Prepare, O Bethlehem, for Eden has been opened to all! Adorn yourself, O Ephratha, for the tree of life blossoms forth from the Virgin in the cave! Her womb is a spiritual paradise planted with the Divine Fruit: if we eat of it, we shall live forever and not die like Adam. Christ comes to restore the image which He made in the beginning.&quot;

Readers who have followed this thread will know that the&quot;New Adam&quot;is meant.

ANCESTORS OF CHRIST KONTAKION

&quot;Rejoyce, O Bethlehem! Prepare yourself, O Ephratha! The Lamb is on her way to give birth to the Chief Shepherd she carries in her womb. The God-bearing forefathers will rejoyce, beholding Him, and to gether with the shepherds, they will glorify the Virgin nursing Him.&quot;

One of these God-bearing forefathers was St. Ignatius, who is mentioned on the Church Calendar Saturday last, read some His pages, more fervent than St. Chrystostom, a few days ago. In particular I liked one concerning&quot;Ye are the Salt of the Earth&quot;, which I will convey in a few days.

The Holy Fathers are those&quot;who wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitude, afflicted&quot;, tormented, tortured, mocked, scourged, put in chains, stoned, imprisoned, and killed. The Holy Fathers&quot;of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, in dens and caves of the earth. And all these, having obtained a good testimony through faith, did not receive the promise, God having provided something better for us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us.&quot;And so they appear to people to help and work their miracles.

Read from the Gospel of St. Luke, were the&quot;Generations&quot;of who begot whom, from Abraham to Jesus, and&quot;they shall call His name Immanuel&quot;, which translates : God with us.&quot;There are 3 times 14 Generation.

Father Ceko, commenting on the Virgin giving birth in the cave: before there were Hotels and Motels, travelers in the night looked for candles in the windows signifying a room was available, and to remember that&quot;there was no room in the Inn&quot;for Mary and Joseph, and to keep a candle lit in the room of our hearts, and that probaly in this tradition we put candles in our windows on Christmas.

For the second Sunday, an elderly visiting Priest, perhaps, Love and Light all about Him, gave out the Blessed Bread at the end of the Holy Liturgy. &apos;Twas good walking out of the Church with it, I still feel it and share it with anyone who wants it.

Continuing, Saint Chrysostom to the Brethren

Chrysostom and the Saints, by Sebastino del Piambo, Italy

 http://www.chrysostom.org/images/chrysostom9.jpg 

&apos;Listening&apos; to the Saint is more like listening to a Teacher, rather than the familiar style of a Saint.

The rich and the poor Man, and how the Church as a&quot;Hospital&quot;applies medicine.

&quot;It is not as absolutely bringing an accusation against those who are wealthy that I say all this; not as praising the poor without reference to circumstances: for neither is wealth an evil, but the having made a bad use of wealth; nor is poverty a virtue, but the having made a virtous use of poverty. That rich man who was in the time of Lazarus was punished, not because he was rich, but because he was cruel and inhuman. And the poor man who rested in the bosom of Abraham was praised, not because he was poor, but because he had born his poverty with thankfulness.

&quot;For of things(now attend carefully to this saying; for it will avail to put into you sufficient religious knowledge, and to cast out all unsound reasoning, and to bring about your having your judgement right concerning the truth of things)well, of things some are by nature morally good, and others the contrary; and others neither good nor evil, but the occupy the intermediate position. A good thing piety is by nature, impiety an evil thing; a good thing virtue, an evil thing wickedness; but wealth and poverty in themselves are neither one nor the other; but from the will of those who use them they become either one or the other.

&quot;For if thou hast used thy wealth for porpuses of philanthropy, the thing becomes to thee a foundation of good; but if for rapine and grasping and insolence, thou hast turned the use of it to the direct opposite; but for this wealth is not chargeable, but he who has used his wealth for insolence. So also we may say of poverty: if thou have born it nobly by giving thanks to the Master, what has been done becomes to thee a cause and ground for receiving crowns; but if on account of this thou blaspheme thy Creator, and accuse Him as His providence, thou hast again used the thing to an evil purpose. - The praise or blame belong to our own will and choice, - for the things themselves lie in the middle.

&quot;But as I was saying (for it is good to return to a former subject), both rich and poor enjoy the benefit of the medicines administered here with the same boldness and freedom; and often the poor with more earnestness. For the special medicines is not this only, that they heal souls, that their virtue is not destroyed by lenght of time, that they are not worsted by any disease, that the benefit is publicly offered gratuitously, that the healing treatment is on a footing of equality both for rich and poorbut they have another quality also not inferior to these good points.

&quot;Pray of what character is this? It is that we do not publicly expose those who come to this surgery. For they who go off to the surgeries of the outside world, have many who examine their wounds, and unless the physician have first uncovered the sore, he does not apply the dressing; but here not so, but seeing as we do innumerable patients, we go through the medical treatment of them in a latent manner. For not by dragging into publicity those who have sinned do we thus noise abroad the sins commited by them; but after putting forth our teaching, as common to all, we leave it entirely to the conscience of the hearers; so that each may draw to himself from what is said the suitable medecine for his own wound.

For there proceeds the word of doctrine from the tongue of the speaker, containing accusations of wickedness, praise of virtue, blame of lewdness, commendations of chasteness, censure of pride, praise for gentleness, just as a medicine of varied and manifold ingredients, compounded from every kind; and to take what is applicable to himself and salutary is the part of each of the hearers. The word then issues openly, and settling into the conscience of each, secretly both affords the healing treatment which comes from it, and before the malady has been devulged, has often restored health.&quot;

The last two paragraphs denote the Orthodox Church as a Church of FREEDOM, as it was spelled once, and contains Steven&apos;s&quot;come and partake as much as you want&quot;.

St. Chrysostom (347-407)

&quot;Pray of what character is this?&quot;Shakespeare crosses the Mind, which, of course, could be the phrase used by the Interpreter. Pray, even if so it would make no difference in the Anglican view:

&quot;Out of the English reformation, an understanding of salvation in terms closely comparable to the Orthodox doctrine of theosis was recognized in the Anglican tradition, for example in the writings of Lancelot Andrewes, who described salvation in terms vividly reminiscent of the early fathers:

&quot;Whereby, as before He of ours, so now we of His are made partakers. He clothed with our flesh, and we invested with His Spirit. The great promise of the Old Testament accomplished, that He should partake our human nature; and the great precious promise of the New, that we should be consortes divinae naturae&quot;,&quot;partake his divine nature,&quot; both are this day accomplished.&quot;

It is no surprise then, that Bishop Andrewes spoke thus from&quot;Partakers of God&quot;, which was so inspiring, and purely Orthodox Greek.

&quot;Lancelot Andrewes (1555-25 September 1626) was an English clergyman and scholar, who held a high position in the Church of England during the reigns of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I.
During the latter reign, Andrewes served successively as Bishop of Chichester, Ely and Winchester and oversaw the translation of the Authorized Version (or King James Version) of the Bible.&quot;

Sir Francis Bacon had His Mind in that Noble Work as well, and in that one paragraph the whole Era comes alive, as I keep pointing out the uninterrupted flow of the Wisdom of the Saints to both the Florentine and English Renaissance, and Great Rosicrucian Movement, the Luminaries of the time toiling to endow Humanity with understanding, one and all, studying the writings of the Church Fathers, or influenced by those who did, and so it is rightfully said that the Orthodox Church possesses the Wisdom. During Services, the Priest turns to the Congregation:&quot;Wisdom, let us be attentive&quot;.

Not to forget Plato, Platinus, and Hermetica.

Have a great day

December 6, the Eve of the Epiphany, in Greek Theophany, the Magi, Baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan, and the Miracle at the Wedding of Cana in Galilee.

Read carefully, these are but informative excerpts.

&quot;The liturgical Forefeast of Thophany begins January 1, and concludes with the Paramony on January 5.

&quot;The Eve of the Feast is called Paramony &quot;, and&quot;is observed as a strict fast day, on which those faithful who are physically able, refrain from food until the first star is observed in the evening....&quot;

The&quot;Feast of Thophany, Greek:&quot;God shining forth or&quot;divine manifestation&quot;, is one of the Great Feasts of the liturgical year, being third in rank, behind only Pascha (Easter) and the Pentacost in importance.&quot;

&quot;In a ceremony delivered on December 25, 380, St. Gregory of Nazianzus referred to the day as ta theophania ( the Theophany&quot;, an alternative name for Epiphany), saying expressly that it is a day commemorating he hagia tou Christou gennesis (&quot;the holy nativity of Christ&quot;) and told his listeners that they would soon be celebrating the baptism of Christ. Then, on January 6 and 7, he preached two more cermons, wherein he declared that the celebration of the birth of Christ and the visitation of the Magi had already taken place, and that they would now commemorate his Baptism. At this time, celebration of these two events was beginning to be observed on sperate occasions, at least in Cappadocia.

&quot;The Orthodox consider Jesus&apos; Baptism to be the first step toward Crucifixion, and there are some parallels in the hymnography used on this day and the hymns chanted on Good Friday.

&quot;The Feast of Theophany is folloed by an eight-day Afterfeast on which the normal fasting laws are suspended. The Saturday and Sunday after Theophany have special readings assigned to them, which relate to the Temptation of Christ and to penance and perseverance in the Christian struggle. There is thus a liturgical continuum between the Feast of Theophany and the beginning of Great Lent.&quot;

St. John Cassian in his time (5th century), said&quot;that the Egyptian Monasteries celebrated the Nativity and Baptism together on January 6.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_Saint_John_the_Baptist 

The Trinitarian Feast

The Orthodox Church emphasises at this Feast&quot;the shining forth and revelation of Jesus Christ as the Messiah and Second Person of the Trinity at the time of his baptism. It is also celebrated because, according to tradition, the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River by St. John the Baptist marked only one of two occasions when all three Persons of the Trinity manifested themselves simulaneously to humanity. God the Father by speaking through the clouds, God the Son being baptized in the river, and God the Holy Spirit in the shape of a dove descending from heaven (the other occasion was the Transfiguration on Mount Tabor). Thus the holy day is considered to be a Trinatarian feast.&quot;

This is described more &apos;clearly&apos; in

The Prologue from Ohrid

THE EPIPHANY [THEOPHANY] OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST

&quot;When our Lord reached thirty years from His physical birth, He began His teaching and salvivic work. He Himself signifies this&quot;beginning of the beginning&quot;by His baptism in the Jordan river. St. Cyril of Jerusalem says,&quot;The beginning of the world - water; the beginning of the Good News - Jordan.&quot;At the time of baptism of the Lord in the water, that mystery was declared to the world: that mystery which was prophesied in the Old Testament; the mystery about with in ancient Egypt and India was only fabled; i.e., the mystery of the Divine Holy Trinity. The Father was revealed to the sense of hearing; the Spirit to the sense of sight, and in addition to these, the Son was revealed to the sense of touch. The Father uttered His witness about the Son, the Son was baptized in water, and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove hovered above the water. When John the Baptist witnessed and said about Christ,&quot;Behold, the Lamb of God, Who takes away the sins of the World.&quot;

Concerning Us

&quot;There is also another trinity in the inner heaven of man which should be, not only a unity, but a oneness so that man could be blessed in this world and in the other world. That is the union of mind, heart and will. As long as these three are only in togetherness, man will be at war with himself and with the Heavenly Trinity. However, when these three become one, so that neither one rules and that neither one is enslaved, the man becomes filled with &quot;the peace of God that passeth all understanding&quot;(Philippians 4:7), man&apos;s every word, every explanation, every fear and every sorrow. Then the small heaven in man begins to resemble that great heaven of God, and the &quot;image and likeness of God&quot; becomes apparent in man.&quot;

Here is a good picture of the Greek practice of going to a body of&quot;living water&quot;, which upon being blessed&quot;becomes incorrupt, a miracle attested to as early as St. Chrysostom.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_(holiday) 

The Magi, who brought Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh

&quot;The phrase from the east is the only information Matthew provides about the region from which they came. Traditionally the view developed that they were Babylonians or Arabs or Jews from Yemen as the Makrebs or kings of Yemen then were Jews, a view held for example by John Chrysostom.&quot;

I find Saint Chrysostom&quot;everywhere&quot;, and I think the Saint uses&quot;good management&quot;here, if you read my posts.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi 

The relics of the Magi are said to be in a Shrine in the Cologne Cathedral

Today is marked a Holiday on the Calendar.

Nativity of our Lord

There are many similar Orthodox Icons, the goal of which is given by Anton Vrame:

&quot;Thus the icon is also theology, a theology in color, expressing the experience of God with lines and paints rather than with discursive language. The great goal of the icon and that of written theology are the same - to lead others to the mystical experience of God. The icon artistically depicts the experience so that others may approch the mystery and be invited to share it.&quot;

 http://www.goarch.org/archdiocese/departments/outreach/nativity 

Saint Chrysostom

&quot;Do ye indeed remember the charge, which we lately made you, entreating you to hearken unto all the things that are said with all silence, and mystical quietness? For we are today to set foot within the holy vestibule, whereof I have also put you in mind of the charge.

&quot;Stay, seek not to learn all at once, but gently and by little and little. Why, it is in the vestibule that thou art standing, by the very porch; why then dost thou hasten toward the inner shrine? As yet thou hast not marked all without. For neither for a while do I declare unto thee that other generation: or rather not even this which commeth after, for it is unutterable, and unspeakable.&quot;

This is an informitive article on the Feast of the Nativity, the Wise Men, Pagan Astrologers, and the Sun of Righteousness.

 http://www.orthodox.net/nativity/nativity-bulgakov.html 

Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh are interpreted to signify Christ&apos;s Royalty, Divinity, and bitter suffering, or,&quot;Gold represents material gifts...Frankincense is offered by those who use, for the glory of God and the benefit of their neighbor, their talents, knowledge and skill, which are something that cannot be bought with gold. Myrrh, like frankincense, gives a fragrance, but its distinguishing characteristc lies in its extreme bitterness; therefore it represents our misfortunes, sorrows, tears, and suffering.&quot;In the Church, women are said to be the Myrrh Bearers.

Great Einstein was spooked, but the Church Fathers knew:

Despite every safeguard and every security device known to man, somehow, Santa Claus got into our house AGAIN last night! Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jan 8, 2010, 12:03pm

I never heard or read of anyone safeguarding their house from Santa Claus, other than the story of the poor Man of the three Daughters who could not be wedded since he had no dowry to give them, as pictured in the painting you posted. Upon hearing this, Saint Nicholas tossed a sack of silver or gold coins for the first and second Daughter, but when He came to bring His gift for the third girl, every door and window was locked so He decided to climb on the roof and drop the the sack with coins down the chimney. Perhaps you forgot the chimney.

There is another story relating to the second painting you posted, which I didn&apos;t have time to comment on, and from which derived a famous phrase. Saint Nicholas of Myra is the Patron Saint of Sailors, who is depicted blessing the Fleet of 15th century Noblemen, Captain John White et all. Arriving safely in Virginia, a Daughter was born to John and His wife Elenore whom they named Virginia. It is said that the Mother in her joy looked upon the Baby and declared:&quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus!&quot;I have to keep weaving in my favorite History.

Above all, Saint Nicholas was a Miracle-worker, hence had no problem getting into any House, and I hope He brought Gifts you and your family wished for. I received 6 tubes of hand lotion, 2 I always use, and 4 special ones from France, and a Navajo hand woven basket with a dream-catcher web woven into it, from New Mexico.


There are so many interconnected Feast&apos;s this time of the year. On my Church calendar, today the Church celebrates the

Synaxis of the Most-holy Theotokos

 http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?FSID=103648 

And:

&quot;The fourth feast, the Annunciation is among the oldest Christian feasts. It originally began as the feast of the Conception of Christ, However, with the ever-growing devotion to His Mother, and the increasing consciousness of her role in the Divine Economy, the feast took on a distinctly Marian character. - The hymns of the Annuciation shows Mary&apos;s role as the New Eve, defined by the Ancient Fathers. Eve&apos;s disobediance brought death to man. Mary&apos;s obediance brought man life and salvation.&quot;

HYMN OF PRAISE

The Synaxis of the Most-holy Theotokos

At the border between night and sunny day,
The dawn is rosy, pink and dewy.
The crimson dawn thou art, O Virgin given by God,
Precurser of the day, rosy and glorious.
Thou didst correct Eve and restore her to Pradise.
Do not withhold thy help from us sinners.
Israel crossed dry-shod over the Red Sea;
A cool spring flowed from the rock in the wilderness;
The bush burned but was not consumed-
As the dawn resembles the crimson eve,
So thou, O Virgin, dost resemble those foreshadowings.
O thou whom the Church calls the Mother of God,
Unknown to sin, not given to sin,
O Most-pure Mother of our Savior,
Because of thy purity thou was chosen by God,
To bring down the Eternal Creator to earth.
That is why thou hast authority to pray for us,
And we have the joy of hymning and glorifying thee!

Maybe this is the origin of the bedding in a crib, and decorations in the room for a baby girl are rosy and pink, as well as much clothing, a boy&apos;s color being blue. In fact, in my work I try to persuade parents to choose a muted rosy, calming for an infant.

A great day to All

Commemorated today

St. Stephen the First Martyr

 http://www.antiochian.org/book/export/html/450 

St. Stephen was a contemporary of &apos;Soul&apos; and both&quot;studied under the renowned rabbinical tutor Gamaliel. Converting to Christianity, He&quot;boldly challenged His Teachers in the Synagogues, and was stoned to death AD 34-35 at the gates of Jerusalem, while &apos;Soul&apos; consenting to his murder, looked on.

&quot;Not unlike Paul he was a qualified religious scholar who once sought to discredit the Saviour, until he came to know Jesus Christ and to embrace him as Paul did in that dramatic confrontation on the road to Damaskus.&quot;

St. Stephen&apos;s Cathedral in Vienna, dedicated to the Saint, was built founded in 1147 and built on the ruins of two earlier Churches. To the casual observer, as were my Sister and I, the ornately patterned roof of 230,000 glazed tiles and the mosaic of the Habsburger Eagle are the most important feature, but the Church has salient components of Orthodoxy.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephansdom 

&quot;The main entrance to the church is named the Giant&apos;s Door, or Riesentor, referring to to a thighbone of a mastodon that hung over it for decades after being unearthed in 1443 while digging the foundations for the north tower. The tympanum above the Door depicts Christ Pantocrater flanked by two winged angels....&quot;On the Pulpit are sculptures of St. Gregory, St. Jeromy, and St. Augustine, both the Catholic and Orthodox Church honering many Saints in common.

&quot;During WWII, St. Stephen&apos;s Cathedral was saved from intentional distruction at the hands of retreating German forces when Captain Gerhard Klinkicht disregarded orders from the city commandant, Sepp Dietrich, to&quot;fire a hundred shells and leave it in just debris and rubble.&quot;

Proof that there were good Germans, now they&apos;re all good St. Stephen&apos;s was also Mozart&apos;s Perish, where He was married and His funeral was held. Mozart, btw, was baptized Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgang Theophilus Mozart.

St. Stephen, the Holy Protomartyr, is buried in a small Chapel in Jerusalem.

Alas, we hav seen too near the poor life of the Bee,
how of the swarming workers that cluster&apos;d to found
the pringtide colony and project its waxen walls
not one liveth to sing her nisi Dominus, 
nor to rest from her labour, nor to enjoy the fruits.
Fourty days, six unsabbath&apos;d weeks of fever&apos;d toil,
wasteth and wearieth out their little framesin truth
their eggs wer a mass-product, not design&apos;d to endure,
not for themselves, but pennywise to serve a turn:
One by one they succumb on their lonely journeys,
o&apos;erladen above their strenght, benighted or astray,
entrapp&apos;d by swooping beaks, or by hard hail laid low
with broken wings, until a frail remnant at last
wearily welcoming the dim prescience of death
seek their own cemetery, where their shriveling skins
may lie together apart nor soil their hive; yet stil
ever and ever as they fail, perish and disappear,
new shifts of younger workers, born of later eggs,
take up the unresting labour, each in their turn content
to keep the hive clean, eggs plenty, and storeroom full.
Thus passeth summer, and with her draggled pageantry
they too giv o&apos;er, and stay all business in the hive,
and huddling upon their foodstore in their dark den
by numb stagnation husband the low flicker of life,
sustain&apos;d by an unheard promise that their prison again
shall feel the sun, and they with the brave buds of March
shall drink the valiance of his steepening rays, they too
be hearten&apos;d to revive, and venturing forth renew
the well-worn round of toil; wherein ther is no one point
of true accomplishment, since the sweet honeycomb
for which man thanketh them, is but their furnishment,
the larder and nursery and provisional shelter
wherein their forlorn hope, their last shift may hold out
thru&apos; their long sleepness night of winter&apos;s starving gloom.
And for their monarch Queenan egg-casting mashine,
helpless without attendance as a farmer&apos;s drill,
by bedels driven and gear&apos;d and in the furrow&apos;s steer&apos;d,

so long as she run well, oil&apos;d stoked and kept in trim;
but if deranged she slacken in her depositing,
she is dealt with as men scrap a worn-out seed-barrow,
not worth the mending; new mashines cost nought to bees.

Now when this story is with man&apos;s tender sentiment
foolishly travestied, Nature will seem malign:
But beesunless the Selfhood of the hive can feel
lack conscience of emotion, or hav no more than when,
call&apos;d by the sun to swarm in a bright morn of May,
their agitated clamour and frolic flight would shew
that some levity hath prick&apos;d their cores: even as with us
who feel the exhileration of the voluptuous air
that surgeth in our flesh to flood the soul, and ease
our stiff behaviour; and to such happy influences
swarming bees are responsiv and forget to sting.

The Poet Divine Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jan 11, 2010, 12:44pm

This weekend I found myself trice in the Church, a miracle in itself having not stepped into a Church for thirty years.

Attending Holy Liturgy on Saturday, I found the Church decorated with Garlands, Wreaths, and red Poinsettias as it usually on December 25th in other Churches, indicating that Christmas for Orthodox Christians actually is celebrated on the 7th of January, &apos;Nativity of our Lord&apos;.

Fr Norman, my favorite Priest, served, Fr Ceko and Papadia Sandra sang throughout, and minus the Church Choir I heard clearly the beautiful voice of Papadia Sandra for the first time. The service was somewhat different, the singing somber and subdued resembling the feeling and tone of&quot;nearer my God to Thee&quot;. Fr Norman turned often to bless or bow to us. It was very peaceful, perhaps also because there were only about twenty of us. Some people brought cakes and a rice dish round which Father Ceko and the people gathered, but I didn&apos;t know what to do so I left.

In the evening I attended the Vesper at St. Matthews, and in the Readings one sentence stood out, namely, that St John the Baptist saw the One that comes after Him with His Illuminated Eye.

On the way to Church yesterday, I heard on&quot;Star Date&quot;that Antares, the brightest star in Scorpius can be seen at daybreak today at the upper right of the Moon, and Mercury on the lower left about the same distance, so I looked and sure enough, there they were, though Mercury, it seemed to me, was about three times the distance from the Moon, and I had to gaze for 10 seconds or so to see very faintly, reminding me of&quot;Stars rule us men, but God rules the Stars, the Stars pay heed to God, and God heeds the prayer of the Pious&quot;, and in His Mercy, pray, the not so pious for&quot;He loves Mankind&quot;.

Sunday,&quot;The Feast Of The Holy Reighteous One&quot;, began by Fr Ceko saying,&quot;Christ is Born!&quot;Two of the special and remarkable Hymns:

&quot;Your Nativity, O Christ our God, has shone to the world the Light of Wisdom. For by it, those who worship the stars were taught by a star to adore You, the Sun of Reighteousness, and to know You the Orient from on high. Lord, glory to You!&quot;

&quot;INSTEAD OF&quot;IT IS TRULY MEET...&quot;:

&quot;Magnify, O my soul, the most pure Virgin Theotokos, more honorable and more glorious than the heavenly hosts. I behold a strange, most glorious mystery! Heaven - the cave! The cherubic throne - the Virgin! The manger - the place where Christ lay, the uncontainable God whom we magnify in song!&quot;

St. Chrysostom:&quot;I behold a strange and glorious mystery!&quot;

Fr Norman commented on&quot;the Corner Stone the Builders rejected&quot;, and&quot;Out of Egypt I called my Son&quot;, adding the Bible verse of Hosea,&quot;When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my Son out of Egypt&quot;, a sentence I pondered on many years ago, and later.

Two accounts and reading between the lines, as given in the end.

The Sojourn of the Holy Family to Egypt, Reflection from the Prologue of St. Nicholai of Zica, Ochrid,
and All-America

&quot;A story of the Divine Christ-child: When the Most-holy Virgin, with her Divine Child and the reighteous Joseph, drew near Hermopolis [Cairo], they saw a tree before the gate of the city. The travelers from afar were weary from their journey and approached this tree to rest a while, even though the tree was very tall and did not offer adequate shade. The Egyptians called this tree&quot;Persea&quot;and dwelt in this tree. As the holy family approached the tree, the tree shook fiercely, and the evil spirit, terrified by the approaching Christ-child, fled. Then the tree bent its top down to the ground and worshiped its Creator like a rational creature. Thus the bent tree cast a great shadow, under which the weary travelers rested. From that day, the three received miraculous healing powers from Christ the Lord to heal every infirmity of men. Afterward, the holy sojourners went to the village of Matarea. Near the village they saw a fig tree, and, while Joseph went into the village on business, the Most-holy Virgin took refuge under the fig tree with the Lord. And, oh, what a miracle: the tree lowered its crown down to the ground to create a shadow for the travelers, and its lower half split open in such a way that the Mother with the Child could enter and rest. And what is even more miraculous: a living spring of water suddenly opened near the fig tree. Joseph found a hut in the vicinity, where they settled. There they lived and drank from that miraculous spring. This was the only spring of living water to be found in Egypt, for all the other water in Egypt comes from the Nile River, which branches off into inumerable canals. And thus, like brought forth like: the Lord Jesus, the Immortal and Heavenly Spring of living water, by His presence called forth this spring of living water from the earth.&quot;

The robbers Dismas and Gestas crucified with Jesus meet Him for the first time.

the other &apos;Reflection from the Prolog, December 26&apos;

&quot;A story of the Divine Christchild: When the holy family fled before Herod&apos;s sword to Egypt, robbers lept out on the road with the intention of stealing something. The reighteous Joseph was leading the donkey, on which were some belongings and on which the Most-holy Theotokos was riding with her Son at her breast. The robbers seized the donkey to lead it away. At that moment, one of the robbers approached the Mother of God to see what she was holding next to her breast. The robber, seeing the Christ-child, was astonished at His unusual beauty and said in his astonishment:&quot;If God were to take upon Himself the flesh of man, He would not be more beautiful than this Child. This robber than ordered his companion to take nothing from these travelers. Filled with gratitude toward this generous robber, the Most-holy Virgin said to him:&quot;Know that this Child will repay you with a good reward because you protected Him today.&quot;Thirty-three years later, this same thief hung on the Cross for his crimes, crucified on the right side of Christ&apos;s Cross. His name was Dismas, and the name of the other thief on the left side was Gestas. Beholding Christ the Lord innocently crucified, Dismas repented for all the evil of his life. While Gestas reviled the Lord, Dismas defended Him, saying: This man hath done nothing amiss. (Luke 23:41). Dismas, therefore, was the wise thief to whom our Lord said: Verily I say onto thee, Today shalt thou be with Me in Paradise (luke 23:43). Thus the Lord granted Paradise to him who spared Him in childhood.&quot;

In this story I consider myself somewhat like a Dismasea, for I pray&quot;Lord take me with Thee to Paradise&quot;.

Yesterday in Church, I looked for the elderly Priest, who, it seemed to me, as I mentione before, stood in an Aura of Love, for I wished to stand beside Him again and partake of this Love radiating from Him as I held out my hand to receive the Blessed Bread, but the Priest was not present. Instead, there was a younger, stately Priest praying with an accent and singing in a different tone with so powerful a voice that I felt I was standing in a huge Russian Cathedral. It was wonderful, and my first thought upon entering the Church enfolding me was,&quot;I love this Church&quot;, and I was thinking about ya&apos;ll.

Dionysius the Areopagite: On the Divine Names and the Mystical Theology

 Concerning &quot;Omnipotent,&quot; Ancient of Days&quot;; and also concerning &quot;Eternity&quot; and &quot;Time.&quot; 

1. NOW &apos;tis time that our Discourse should celebrate God (Whose Names are many) as&quot;Omnipotent&quot;and&quot;Ancient of Days.&quot;The former title is given Him because He is that All-powerful Foundation of all things which maintains and embraces the Universe, founding and establishing and compacting it; knitting the whole together in Himself without a rift, producing the Universe out of Himself as out of an all-powerful Root, and attracting all things back into Himself as unto an all-powerful Receptacle, holding them all together as their Omnipotent Foundation, and securing them all in this condition with an all-transcendent bond suffering them not to fail away from Himself, nor (by being removed from the perfect Resting Place) to come utterly to destruction. Moreover, the Supreme Godhead is called&quot;Omnipotent&quot;because It is potent over all things, and rules with unalloyed sovranty over all the world it governs; and because It is the Object of desire and yearning for all, and casts on all Its voluntary yoke and sweet travail of Divine all-powerful and indestructable Desire for Its Goodness.

2. And&quot;Ancient of Days&quot;is a title given to God because He is the Eternity of all things and their Time, and is anterior to Days and anterior to Eternity and Time. And the titles&quot;Time,&quot;&quot;Day,&quot;&quot;Season,&quot;and&quot;Eternity&quot;must be applied to Him in a Divine sense, to mean One Who is utterly incapable of all change and movement and, in His eternal motion, remains at rest; and Who is the Cause whence Eternity, Time, and Days are derived. Whereof in the sacred Theophanies revealed in mystic Visions He is described as Ancient and yet as Young: the former title signifying that He is the Primal Being, existent from the beginning, and tha latter that He grows not old. Or both titles together teach that He goes forth from the Beginning through the entire process of the world unto the End. Or, as the Divine Initiator tells us, either term implies the Primal Being of God: the term&quot;Ancient&quot;signifying that He is First in point of Time, and the term&quot;Young&quot;that He possesses the Primacy in point of Number, since Unity and the properties of Unity have a primacy over the more advanced numbers.

3. Need is there, methinks, that we understand the sense in which Scripture speaketh of Time and Eternity. For where Scripture speaks of things as&quot;eternal&quot;it doth not always mean things that are absolutely Uncreated or verily Everlasting, Incorruptible, Immortal, Invariable, and Immutable (e.g.&quot;Be ye lift up, ye eternal doors,&quot;and suchlike passages). Often it gives the name of&quot;Eternal&quot;to anything very ancient; and sometimes, again, it applies the term&quot;Eternity&quot;to the whole course of earthly Time, inasmuch it is the property of Eternity to be ancient and invariable and to measure the whole of Being.

The name&quot;Time&quot;it Gives to that changing process which is shown in birth, death, and variation. And hence we who are here circumscribed by Time are, saith the Scripture, destined to share in Eternity when we reach that incorruptable Eternity which changes not. And sometimes the Scripture declares the glories of a Temporal Eternity and an Eternal Time, although we understand that in a stricter exactness it describes and reveales Eternity as the home of things that are in Being; and Time as the home of things that are in Birth.

We must not, therefore, think of the things which are called Eternal as being simply co-ordinate with the Everlasting God Who exists before Eternity; but, but, strictly following the venerable Scriptures, we had better interpret the words&quot;Eternal&quot;and&quot;Temporal&quot;in their proper senses, and regard those things which are to some extent participate in Eternity and to some extent in Time as standing midway between things in Being and things in Birth. And God we must celebrate as both Eternity and time, as the Cause of all Time and Eternity and as the Ancient of Days; as before Time and above Time and producing all the variety of times and seasons; and again, as existing before Eternal Ages, in that He is before Eternity and His Kingdom is the Kingdom of all the Eternal Ages. Amen.

So clearly explained and so true. The&quot;And the titles&quot;Time,&quot;&quot;Day,&quot;&quot;Season,&quot;and&quot;Eternity&quot;must be applied to Him in a Divine sense, to mean One Who is utterly incapable of all change and movement and, in His eternal motion, remains at rest&quot;; I saw once. In this Chapter is also found our&quot;Image and Likeness&quot;of God.

Even though we say&quot;Father Time&quot;, Fern insisted that Time is a feminine&quot;sustaining&quot;principle, and when we overburden her with our delinquencies she&quot;runs out&quot;, or merges into Eternal Time, an end of an Epoch comprised of many era&apos;s.

Engaging the Memory

St. Augustine

&quot;Take the line &apos;Deus Creator omnium&apos;, which consists of eight syllables. What has become of each syllable? Their sound id finished and has been wafted away into the past. They no longer exist. . . . It is in my own mind, then, that I measure time . . . . Suppose that I am going to recite a psalm that I know. Before I begin, my faculty of expectation is engaged by the whole of it. But once I have began, as much of the psalm as I have removed from the province of expectation and relegated to the past now engages my memory, and the scope of the action which I am performing is divided between the two faculties of memory and expectation . . . But my faculty of attention is present all the while, and through it passes what was the future in the process of becoming the past.&quot;

I had to read this twice and tried to&quot;simplify&quot;it, but could not, from&quot;Before I begin....&quot;, it has to be &apos;grasped&apos; by the Mind.

I read on the Serbian Language this morning, among other things:&quot;Serbian orthography is very consistent: it is an approximation of the principle&quot;one letter per sound&quot;. This principle is represented by Johann Christoph Adelung&apos;s saying,&quot;Write as you speak and read as it is written&quot;. Unless it is a word I wrote a thousand times before and it&quot;looks&quot;right, this is what I have to do, unless I feel I have to hurry, and probably all people who speak and write not in their Mother Tongue. For instance, when I write language&apos;, I think purely lan-gu-age, no &apos;quich&apos; is there, or have to seprate tongue as ton-gue. It&apos;s also the only way anybody, I would think, can pro-noun-ce and spell all the complicated names, terms, and words that come up in Orthodox Literature, for one. Problematic is when the words fall apart, ideas come to mind such as language is long in age etc., distracting from the subject at hand resulting in my being&quot;scatter-brained&quot;. Such are my excuses for typos and all But the loved A-re-o-pa-gi-te focuses the mind.

Mystical Theology

Dionysius the Areopagite

Chapter I

 What is Divine Darkness? 

Supernal Triad, Deity above all essence,
knowledge and goodness; Guide of Christians to
Divine Wisdom; direct our path to the ultimate
summit of your mystical knowledge, most
incomprehensible, most luminous and most
exalted, where the pure, absolute and immutable
mysteries of theology are veiled in the dazzling
obscurity of the secret Silence, outshining all
brilliance with the intensity of their Darkness, and
surcharging our blinded intellects with the utterly
impalpable and invisible fairness of glories
surpassing all beauty.

Let this be my prayer; but do, dear Timothy, in
the diligent exercise of mystical contemplation,
leave behind the senses and the operations of the
intellect, and all things sensible and intellectual,
and all things in the world of being and nonbeing,
that you may arise by unknowing towards the
union, as far as attainable, with it that
transcends all being and all knowledge. For by
the unceasing and absolute renunciation of
yourself and of all things you may be born on
high, through pure and entire self-abnegation, into
the superessential Radiance of the Divine Darkness.

But these things are not to be disclosed to the
uninitiated, by whom I mean those attached to the
objects of human thought, and who
believe there is no superessential Reality beyond,
and who imagin that by their own understanding
they know it that has made Darkness Its secret
place. And if the principles of the divine
Mysteries are beyond the understanding of these,
what is to be said of others still more incapable
thereof, who describe the transcendental First
Cause of all by characteristics drawn from the
lowest order of things, while they deny that it is
in any way above the images which they fashion
after various designs; whereas they should affirm
that, while it possesses all the positive attributes
of the universe (being the Universal Cause) yet, in
a more strict sense, it does not possess them, since
it transcends them all; wherefore there is no
contradiction between the affirmations and the
negations, inasmuch as it infinitely precedes all
conceptions of deprivation, being beyond all
positive and negative distinctions.

Today is the Feast of Christ&apos;s Circumcision

 http://full-of-grace-and-truth.blogspot.....rcumcision.html 

The Prologue from Ohrid

1. THE CIRCUMCISION OF OUR LORD AND GOD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST

&quot;The eight day following His birth, the Divine Child was presented in the Temple and circumcised according to the Law existing in Israel since the time of Abraham. On this occasion, He was given the name Jesus, which the Archangel Gabriel announced to the All-Holy Virgin Mary. The Old Testament circumcision was the proto-type of the New Testament baptism. The circumcision of our Lord shows that He received upon Himself the true body of man and not just seemingly, as was later taught of Him by heretics. Our Lord was also circumcised because He wanted to fulfill the entire Law which He Himself gave through the prophets and forefathers. In fulfilling the written Law, He replaced it with Baptism in His Holy Church as was proclaimed by the Apostle Paul:&quot; For neither does circumcision mean anything, nor does uncircumcision, but only a new creation&quot;(Galatians 6:15). (In the cycle of the liturgical calendar of the Church, this Feast of the Lord&apos;s Circumcision has neither a Forefeast nor an Antefeast).&quot; 

&quot;Circumcision of the flesh was replaced with a spiritual one&quot;as Baptism is a&quot;new birth&quot;, through which&quot;we are mystically born into the spiritual life.&quot;

St. Paul writes, Romans 2, 28-29

For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:

But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.

Colossians 2, 11-12

In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.

Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.

In&quot;The Lives Of The Holy Apostles&quot;is written:

&quot;When some time had passed, there arose between the Jews and the Hellenes of Antioch a dispute concerning circumcision: some said that it was impossible to be saved without circumcision, and others considered circumcision to difficult a thing to have performed upon them. Therefore, the Apostle Paul and Barnabas had to travel to Jerusalem, to ask the senior apostles and presbyters their opinion regarding circumcision, and to inform them that God had opened the door of the Faith to the pagans; with this latter news they gladdened the brethren in Jerusalem exceedingly.

&quot;In Jerusalem, at their assembly, the holy apostles utterly rejected circumcision, as something unecessary under the new grace.&quot;

In the New Testament, then, circumcision is of&quot;the Heart&quot;, a change of heart or Metanoia as thaught in Theosis. I think I remember reading one of the Prophets in the Old Testament speaking of&quot;seeing with circumcised eyes, and hearing with circumcised ears, spiritual.


Observed today is also the Feast of Sava, first Archbishop of Serbia, Father among the Saints.

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Sava_of_Serbia 

&quot;Sava was born Prince Rastco Nemanjic, (1175 or 1176)the son of Stefan Nemanjia, the Serbian Ruler and founder of the medieval Serbian state.

&quot;When he arrived in Serbia, Saba decided that on the first day of his archepiscopacy in Zica, the Feast of the Ascension, 1220, he would, as the newly concecrated Archbishop of Serbia, crown his brother Stephen as first Serbian king.&quot;

&quot;When he returned, Sava brought with him the medecine to heal the entire situation, the relics of (their) father, the Grand Zupan and saint, Stephen NemanjaSimeon the Myrrh-flowing and co-founder of Hilandar.&quot;

 http://www.teslasociety.com/mon2.jpg 

St. Stephen the First Crowned married Anna Dandola, the Granddaughter of the 41st Doge of Venice, Enrico Dandolo, who was buried in the Hagia Sophia, but his tomb was destroyed when the Turks conquered Constantinople in 1453. Later geneaologists maintain that the Doge had no children.

Quotation

 At first we were confused. The East thought that we were the West, while the West considered us to be the East. Some of us misunderstood our place in the clash of currents, so they cried that we belong to neither side, and others that we belong exclusively to one side or the other. But I tell you, Ireneus, we are doomed by fate to be the East in the West and the West in the East, to acknowledge only heavenly Jerusalem beyond us, and here on earthno one. 

&quot;The Illuminator&quot;

Thou wast a guide to the Way of Life, a first Hierarch and a teacher;
thou didst come and enlighten thy home country, O Sava,
and give it rebirth by the Holy Spirit.
Thou hast planted thy children like olive trees in the spiritual Paradise.
O Equal-to-the-Apostles and Saints, pray to Christ our God to grant us His great mercy.

Aglow in redish orange is the Eastern Sky, a tall, laced Pine Tree giving perspective of the horizon, not a sound, not the slightest breeze, an invisible current maybe, a sublime picture this morning.

Addendum to yesterday&apos;s post concerning circumcision which&quot;is in the heart - without human hands&quot;, of St. Paul. Melchizedek is said to have been born circumcised. Mr. Hall writes:

&quot;A great mind must be androgynous. The spiritual nature is neither male nor female, but both in perfect balance. Hence, its perfect manifestation must be through an androgynous, self-generating body, but ages must pass before the human race can sufficiently master the secrets of universal polaritiy for every man to become a complete entity in himself. Understanding is possible only when the positive and negative potentialities are in equilibrium; neither the male nor the female can be perfect of itself. Such is the mystery of the Pries-King Melchizedek, Prince of Salem, who was his own father and his own mother, and in whose footsteps all initiates of the Mysteries must follow if they would be &apos;priests forever after the Order of Melchizedek.&quot;

&quot;.... the spiritual androgyne, the middle race, the &apos;heroes&apos; or demigods, who partake of both qualities, and again of the initiates, the self-born, of whom the androgynous (two-headed) phoenix (or eagle) is the esoteric symbol.&quot;

It is also the Philosophers Stone. The Great Work of&quot;the ancient alchemists symbolized spiritual achievement by the two-headed bisexual figure.&quot;While the cerebo-spinal and sympathetic nervous system&quot;gradually draw together and ultimately &apos;merge&apos; into one - man will be negatively androgynous&quot;, or the philosophical Hermaphrodite.

As I have written before, affixed to each of the 4 corners of the pillars of the Church I go to is a double-headed eagle, eight in all. I think there are 5-7 pillars on each side, I will count them on Sunday.

Mr. Hall:&quot;.... the man who is fashioned like his Father in heaven&quot;, toward that goal we are helped by Dionysius.

There was St. Dionysius the Areopagite,&quot;the holy, glorious and right-victorious Hieromartyr, baptized by St. Paul in Athens and is numbered among the seventy Apostles.&quot;He was tortured and beheaded in the reign of the Emperor Domitian in 96 A.D.

&quot;One of the great values of the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite is the perennial message of the Orthodox mystical tradition which is indeed the heart of Orthodox theology.&quot;

The Identity of the fifth or sixth century person who chose to write under the pseudonym of Dionysius the Areopagite is unknown, what is known is that the Saint greatly influenced the Reformers of that time.

Continuing His Mystical Theology, the medical treatment in a latent manner.

What is the Divine Darkness?

Thus the blessed Bartholomew asserts that the
divine science is both vast and minute, and that
the Gospel is great and broad, yet concise and
short, signifying by this, that the beneficient Cause
of all is most eloquent, yet utters few words, or
rather is altogether silent, as having neither
(human) speech nor (human) understanding,
because it is super-essentially exalted above
created things, and reveals itself in Its naked Truth
to those alone who pass beyond all that is pure or
impure, and ascends above the topmost altitudes of
holy things, and who, leaving behind them all
divine light and sound and heavenly utterances,
plunge into the Darkness where truly dwells, as
the Oracles declare, that ONE who is beyond all.

It is not without reason that the blessed Moses
was commanded first to purify himself and then
to seperate himself from those who had not
undergone purification; and after the entire
purification heard many trupets and saw many lights
streaming forth with pure and manifold rays; and
that he was thereafter separated from the
multitude, with the elect priests, and pressed
forward to the summit of divine ascent.
Nevertheless, he did not attain to the Presence of
God itself; he saw not it (for it cannot be looked
upon) but the Place where it dwells. And this I
take to signify that the divinest and highest things
seen by the eyes and contemplated by the mind are
but the symbolic expressions of those that are
immediately beneath it that is above all. Through
these, Its incomprehensible Presence is
manifested upon those heights of Its Holy Places;
that then it breaks forth, even from that which is
seen and that which sees, and plunges the mystic
into the Darkness of Unknowing, whence all
perfection of understanding is excluded, and he is
enwrapped in that which is altogether intangible,
wholly absorbed in it that is beyond all, and in
none else (whether himself or another); and
through the inactivity of all his reasoning powers
is united by his highest faculty to it that is wholly
unknowable; thus by knowing nothing he knows
That which is beyond his knowledge.

&apos;This exeedingly Beautiful: our reasoning powers inactive, unaware of anything we know, we are united via our Nous, the purified Heart, to that which is beyond our knowledge, God.

On one rung on the Ladder of Divine Ascent is written:

&quot;If you labor a little, the Lord will also soon work with you&quot;.

Have a great Day

Mystical Theology

Chapter II

 The necessity of being united with and of
rendering praise to it that is the Cause of all and above all 

We pray that we may come unto this Darkness
which is beyond light, and, without seeing and
without knowing, to see and to know that which is
above vision and knowledge through the
realization that by not-seeing and by unknowing
we attain to true vision and knowledge; and thus
praise, superessentially, it that is
superessential, by the transcendence of all things;
even as those who, carving a statue out of marble,
abstract or remove all the surrounding material
that hinders the vision which the marble conceals
and, by that abstraction, bring to light the hidden beauty.

It is necessary to distinguish this negative method
of abstraction from the positive method of
affirmation, in which we deal with the Divine
Attributes. For with these latter we begin with the
universal and primary, and pass through the
intermediate and secondary to the particular and
ultimate attributes; but now we ascend from the
particular to the universal conceptions, abstracting
all attributes in order that, without veil, we may
know that Unknowing which is enshrouded under
all that is known and all that can be known, and
that we may begin to contemplate the
superessential Darkness which is hidden by all the
light that is in existing things.

As some perfected flower, Iris or Lily, is born
patterned heav&apos;nly beauty, a pictur&apos;d idea
that hath no other expression for us, nor coud hav;
for thatt which Lily or Iris tell cannot be told
by poetry ot music in their secret tongues,
nor is discerptible in logic, but is itself
an absolute piece of Being, and we know not,
nay, nor search not by what creativ miracle
the soul&apos;s language is writ in perishable forms
yet we aware of such existences crowding,
mysterious beauties unexpanded, unreveal&apos;d,
phantasies intangible investing us closely,
hid only from our eyes by skies that will not clear;
activ presences, striving to force an entrance,
like bodiless exiled souls in dumb urgent pleading
to be brought to birth in our conscient existence,
as if our troubled lot wer the life they long&apos;d for;
even as poor mortals thirst for immortality:
And every divination of Nature or reach of Art
is nearer attainment to the divine plentitude
of understanding, and in moments of Vision
their unseen company is the breath of Life:

By such happy influence of their chosen goddess
the mind of Hellas blossom&apos;d with a wondrous flow&apos;r,
flaming in summer seasons, and in its atumn fall
ripening an everlasting fruit, that in dying
scatter&apos;d its pregnant seed into all the winds of heav&apos;n:
nor ever again hath like bloom appear&apos;d among men.

Knowledge accumulated slowly and not in vain;
with new attainment new orders of beauty arise,
in thought and art new values; but man&apos;s faculties
were gifted once for all and stand, &apos;twould seem, at stay:
Ther is naw no higher intellect to brighten the world
than little Hellas own&apos;d; nay scarcely here and there
liveth a man among us to rival their seers.

So might we fear that such implicit unity,
so friendly a passionat love for nature beauty and truth,
such dignity of the body tender of pride and shame,
such lively accord of Sense, Instinct, Reason and Spirit
as gazeth down on us with alien sovranty
from all their statuesque literature and art,
were a grace (so might we fear) like the grace of childhood
lost in growth, a glory of the past, not to return.

And if the Greek Muses wer a graceful company
yet hav we two, that in maturity transcends
the promise of their baby-prattle in Time&apos;s cradle,
Musick and Mathematick coud their wet-nurses
but see these foster-children upgrown in full stature,
Pythagoras would marvel and Athena rejoyce.

Yesterday

Pre-Feast Of The Theophany Of Christ

 Christ is in our midst! 

 He is and always will be! 

&quot;Today the Lord enters the Jordan and cries out to John:&quot;Do not be afraid to baptize me. I have come to save Adam, the first-formed man!&quot;

 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ce/John_Baptizes_Jesus_Mural.jpg 

&quot;Prepare, O Zebulon, and adorn yourself, O Naphtali; River Jordan, cease flowing and receive with joy the Master coming to be baptized. Adam, rejoice with our First Mother, and do not hide yourself as you did of old in Paradise; for having seen you naked, He has appeared to clothe you with the first garment. Christ has appeared to renew all creation.&quot;

&quot;The dominion of death can no longer hold man captive, for Christ descended, shattering and destroying its powers! Hell is bound, while the prophets rejoice and cry: The Savior has come to those in faith! Enter you faithful into the Resurrection.&quot;

Father Ceko alone served the Matins and Liturgy, interaction of prayer and singing and the Cathedral rich and beautifully embued due to constant Prayer and Praise. Fr Ceko commenting on Jesus&quot;been immersed in the streams of the Jordan&quot;, and&quot;all matter is sanctified and made pure by Him&quot;, accepting our condition and identifying with us. John baptizes with water, but Christ will baptize with the Holy Spirit.&quot;

Commentary

&quot;The confession of sins is essential to baptism under both the Old Covenant and the New. St. John&apos;s baptizm, however, was a sign of repentance and forgiveness of sins only. It did not confer the power of total regeneration nor adoption as a child of God as does Christian baptism in the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. May we all be blessed with the humility of St. John, allowing us to recognize Christ in those we encounter in this world!&quot;

Many years ago I dreamt of standing in the Jordan, the water reaching my waist, my hands sweeping lightly over the water as one usualy does. My fear subsided quickly. A small number of ducks, can&apos;t remember how many, were swimming about, some of &apos;dead&apos; wood which simply moved with the water, others normal ducks as in a pond, but one or two had colorful rings around their necks, including silver and gold, letting me ignore all the others. I felt wonderful in the dream and upon awakening, and this feeling of well-being stayed with me for a few days.

The Venerable Maximus, a Monk living on Mt. Athos, called the&quot;hut-burner&quot;, who pretended to be crazy, built hut after hut and then burned them to move on, was once asked by Gregory of Sinai how He knew His Visions (or certain dreams) were good and not evil, illusions of the devil, to which the Venerable Maximus replied:

&quot;From this I know, that they are not lies,
That these visions, the spirit and body console,
That my spirit always yearns after them
That, from the sign of the cross, they will not vanish,
By sweet joy, a temptation, I know it is not,
By blessed joy that warns me completely.

It reminds of also years ago, when suddenly I felt the pure presence of&quot;humility&quot;, not localized but everwhere, bringing me to my knees and tears streaming onto the carpet I pleaded,&quot;O please God, let me stay here....&quot;

Have a good week

Dear Charlotte,
Forgive me for my skimpy input lately! Barbara and I just got back from spending a week with her dad down in Palm Desert. All the relatives have been taking turns spending time with him since his wife passed away. He&apos;s over 90 himself and we didn&apos;t want him to be lonely. It wasn&apos;t a difficult duty by any means, we had a great time down there with him.

While we were there we spent a lot of time with older folks, all with their own health issues of one sort or another. It was very strange, in the sense that, I don&apos;t know exactly how to put it, except to say that, everyone seemed to be looking at life as what happens to them in between birth and death, rather than looking at life as a preparation for what comes after death.

Of course, I realize that there&apos;s nothing too unusual about that, it&apos;s how most people view life in our day and age. Perhaps it was more striking because these older people were all coming apart at the seams in one way or another and there entire focus was on what the doctors were trying to do to keep them alive as long as possible.

Nothing wrong with that, necessarily, but there just wasn&apos;t any sense of there being anything beyond that going on in their lives. Very strange...

Then, on the last evening we were there, we had a very nice dinner at home, just the three of us, then decided to watch some tv. There was nothing on except a bunch of horrible stuff and we finally ended up watching an old black and white Turner Classic Movie:&quot;Miracle in the rain.&quot;

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYn38vBRNhk 

This movie was from 1956, (same year as both myself and Forbidden Planet...) I t was about this lonely secretary, (Jane Wyman,) who lived at home and took care of her mother, whose husband had left them both when she was just a little girl. One day the girl meets a soldier boy, (Van Jhonson,) they fall in love and he promises that after the war, he will come back and marry her. She gives him an antique Roman coin for luck and to remember her by. Three months later she gets a letter telling her that he was killed in action. She is desolate. A friend of hers, trying to console her, brings her into St.Patrick&apos;s Cathedral in New YorK City, (Where this all takes place...) The girl is not religious but, in the course of wandering around in the Cathedral, she comes upon a statue of St. Andrew the first-called, and wonders why no one has been lighting any candles to him? She makes it a habit after that, to come in and light candles for him and eventually, pours out her heart to him. She comes down with pneumonia and has a high fever.

This has all been pretty depressing up until now, if unusual, when Barbara&apos;s dad turns to me and say&apos;s,&quot;Don&apos;t worry, it comes out all right in the end...&quot;Evidently, he saw it forty or fifty years ago when it first came out!!!

So she ends up getting up out of her sick bed, delirious with fever, makes her way to the Church where she has a vision of her dead fiance who has come from the other world to tell her not to worry that he still loves her and that he has discovered that love lasts forever. He gives her the antique Roman coin back, which he wont be needing anymore, waves farewell and exits, stage left. She collapses out in front of the Church in the rain, where the Priest finds her with the antique Roman coin clutched in her hand.

WOW! Not bad!

So, there you have it. After a week of being around people who were just trying to make the most out of the short time they had left in life, we just happened to catch this on the tellie on our last evening together. It made a real impression on all of us. They just don&apos;t make em like THAT any more, I&apos;ll tell you that!

Obviously, it makes a huge difference in how we will choose to live our lives, whether we believe that this is all there is between birth and death, or that our life here in this world is merely the beginning of another life which is Eternal. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Thanks, Don, I was mystified and, of course, joking about John Nash.

The Cake still appears as if out of the void, so my belated Birthday Wishes to Morph will still count. In my fancied thinking, such&quot;accidental discoveries&quot;belong to the Secrets of the Universe as well when they coincide with a particular event. The Gentleman Himself appeared on the board a few years ago, and we both remember Him from our days at Ma&apos;at, so without further ado to which I easily tend

On yesterday&apos;s Special Day, Today, and in the Future, my Best Thoughts are with you, Sir, wherever thou art.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_616gIUrk 

On my calendar, yesterday was the Eve of Theophany and today Theophany and Baptism of Christ. This, I think, marks the end of the Epiphany commemorations, then, I read that Baptism is the first step to crucifixion.

Also honered today is Arsenius, Archbishop of Corfu, who lived in the 9th centurey, a&quot;highly educated man and renowned spiritual writer. He was glorified with wisdom, and by constant defendinding his flock from the wrath of the emperor Constantine (979-1028)&quot;, defended widows and was a Father to orphans. Like St. Spyridon and so many other Saints, He was a Miracle Worker.

Since humility came up yesterday, I came upon the following this morning. The Venerable Macarius the Great, an Egyptian and contemporary of Anthony the Great, also a Miracle Worker, whose&quot;humility amazed both men and demons. A demon said once to him:&quot;There is only one thing in which I am unable to overpower you. It is not fasting; for I do not eat anything. It is not in vigil; for I never sleep.&quot;&quot;But, what is it?&quot;asked Macarius.&quot;Your humilty&quot;answered the demon.&quot;This I understand completely, for no demon can enter in this Holy atmosphere, and I might add that Mr. Hall lived, not exhibited, in this humility, &apos;twas all about Him and feelable.

I always loved

&quot;Ye are the salt of the Earth&quot;

Honered on January 2, was St. Ignatius of Antioch, or Theophorus the God-bearer, one who bears God within himself. He writes:

&quot;Therefore put away the vile leaven wich hath
waxed stale and sour, and betake yourselves to the new
leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be ye salted in Him,
that none among you grow putried, seeing that by your
savour ye shall be proved.&quot;

From the Prologue of Ohrid

To contemplate the Lord Jesus as the Salt of the earth:

1. As the Salt which gives flavor to life in general;

2. As the Salt which preserves mankind from decay, who would, otherwise, be totally decayed from one end of history to the other;

3. As the Salt of my own life.

I recently heard that salt is a mild antidepressant, and read some years ago that the Egyptians considered the first mineral on earth salt, according to Isha de Lubicz.

I am delighted and almost surprised that you, Steven, are here two consecutive days. I concur about the doctor business, actually upset by their methods, most of them, and that most people live still in Egypt, including all of my Family to whom my first step is,&quot;We are immortal, you know!&quot;They look at me but dare not or look away, but I know the words are heard.

Thanks for the clips and info of the movie, I don&apos;t think the innate knowing of &apos;the other side&apos; has been and always will be just below the level of consciousness of every human being being, has been ridiculed for so long, but that is changing too. TV? I sometimes surf through 100 chanels and can&apos;t find nothin.... Good for contemplating Icons.

Thank God for Miracles, much rain we&apos;re having, and for all things.

Jesus sets the pattern for us. Through our Baptism, the Holy Spirit comes to us and overshadows us once again, as it did our first-created parents of old.

Troparion (Tone 4)

Today the Lord enters the Jordan and cries out to John:
&quot;Do not be afraid to baptize me.
For I have come to save Adam, the first-formed man.&quot;

Kontakion (Tone 4)

Prepare, O Zebulon,
And adorn yourself, O Naphtali;
River Jordan, cease flowing
And receive with joy the Master coming to be baptized.
Adam, rejoice with our First Mother
And do not hide yourself as you did of old in Paradise;
For having seen you naked,
He has appeared to clothe you with the first garment.
Christ has appeared to renew all creation.

Baptism is the doorway into all the Sacraments. Holy Communion is at the center of every Sacrament.

My breakfest every morning, much paper and fruit.

The Synaxis of St. John the Baptist is on my Church Calendar today, the 20th of January, though it is commemorated on January 7th, also.

&quot;In the Orthodox Church it is customary , on the day following the Great Feasts of the Lord and Mother of God, to remember those saints who participated directly in the sacred event. So on the day following the Theophany of the Lord, the Church honors the one who participated directly in the Baptism of Christ, placing his own hand upon the head of the Savior.

&quot;St. John, the holy Forerunner and Baptist of the Lord, whom the Lord called the greatest of the prophets, concludes the history of the Old Testament and opens the era of the New Testament. The holy Prophet John bore witness to the Only-Begotten Son of God, incarnate in the flesh. St. John was accounted worthy to baptize Him in the waters of the Jordan, and he was witness of the Theophany of the most Holy Trinity on the day of the Savior&apos;s Baptism.&quot;

A short summery of History from the Baptism of our Lord to America.

Saint Luke took the Right Hand of St. John to Antioch, later it was transferred to Constantinople and kept there. A bone of the Hand was brought to a Cistercian Abbey in France.

In 1484, the son of the Muslim Sultan Bayazet gave the Relic to the Knights of Rhodes. The Sultan himself was threatened by his Brother who had allied himself with the Knights, and the Relic was transferred to Malta.

The Russian Tsar Paul I (1796-1801), Grandmaster of the Maltese Order, clearly seen on His vestment, transferred the Hand to the Chapel of Gatchina, Russia, and as far as I can assertain, the Relic is now in the Winter Palce.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Palace 

Tsar Paul I was the son of Peter III and Catharina the Great of German Ancestry, known for Her Friendship with the Western European Thinkers of the Enlightenment I keep harping about. The very same Catharina whose Court the enigmatic Count Benyowsky,&quot;Gentlemen of the Inner Court&quot;,&quot;Travelers with Purpose&quot;, and various&quot;Hobos&quot;visited, and a few who met with Benjamin Franklin when He lived in France at Versailles, including Thomas Anson as far as I can see, I just wrote about. A grand an marvelous Conspiracy initiated by Francis Bacon.

Notice, enlarge the&quot;State arms under Emperor Paul&quot;on the bottom, a direct connection to out Heritage. I was always neutral about Russia, but now I&apos;m really liking the Country. I saw an interview with Putin once and liked the former President as well. There is always more to it than politics seen in the Person&apos;s demeanor tells more than words spoken.

The Prologue from Ohrid

Saint Euthymius the Great is also honered today:

&quot;Of noble birth and distinguished parents, Euthymius was born in the Armenian town of Melitene near the Euphrates river in the year 377 A.D.&quot;After visiting Jerusalem at age twenty-nine, He lived in prayer and&quot;internal thought of God&quot;in the desert called Pharan between Jerusalem and Jericho. With Him were Saints Cyriac the Hermit, Sabas the Sanctified, Theotictus and others. A Miracle Workers, St. Euthymius forbade the younger Monks who wanted to fast more than others so as not to become prideful.

&quot;About love, he said,&quot;What salt is to bread, love is to other virtues.&quot;A large Monastery was built beside His cave,&quot;which later, throughout the centuries, was cpmpletely filled with monks as a beehive is filled with bees.&quot;He commanded the gates of the Monastery to be never closed and hospitality adhered to. The Saint,&quot;a son of Light&quot;, died in the year 473 A.D.

Concerning&quot;The Prologue of Ohrid&quot;, which can be accessed on page 22 on this thread, the Prologue is a compilation of the Lives of the Saints, Hymns, reflections, and Homilies (originally written in Serbien), by Bishop Nikolai Velimirovic. A recent Father among Saints (1880-1956), He was called the&quot;new Chrysotom&quot;, was arrested by the Nazis and confined in the Monastery of Ljubostinja, and His reaction to mass deaths by firing squads was:&quot;Is this the German culture, to shoot hundred innocent Serbs, for one dead German soldier!&quot;In 1944, St. Nikolai suffered imprisonment and torture at Dachau. Thank God those horrid years are past.

My wife runs the bookstore at our Church. She has a lot of extra copies of the Prologue and asked me to write a commercial for them. Here it is:

&quot;We are confronted on a daily basis, in subtle ways, with a particular non-Christian, and even anti-Christian view of the world. Without our recognition, these influences try to shape our beliefs and those of our children. There is no more effective antidote for this subtle poison than the daily reading of the Lives of The Saints which have been gathered together for us in the 2-Volume Set of The Prologue from Ochrid .

(Available at Door To Paradise Bookstore)

Reading the Lives of The Saints for each day provides spiritual nourishment and a knowledge of God with which no worldly wisdom can compare.&quot; Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jan 21, 2010, 10:16am

Thank you. A few days ago, I quoted the profound words of St. Sava to Irenus, which are on the site. The words of the Saints are &apos;alive&apos;, reading them one can &apos;see&apos; the Saint in a Soul connexion.

Honored today is

Our Venerable Father George the Chozebite

&quot;St. George was born on the island of Cyprus. After the death of his parents, still a youth, he,&quot;having a divine desire to travel&quot;, went to Palestine to venerate the holy places. Here he arrived at the monastic Chozebite community which is found between the Jordan river and Jerusalem. In this community he subsequently became the rector.&quot;Having kept the fast as food was for the pleasure of eating&quot;, and&quot;exhausted by hiding his need to lie down, and by friendly tears and standing in all-night vigil&quot;, he was a paradigm of the&quot;greatest&quot;of monks. Having lived on earth,&quot;as if bodiless&quot;, he died in peace in the 7th century.&quot;

Kontakion

You were revealed as the brightest star, George,
Enlightening with divine rays those who faithfully call to you:
Pray for us to the Master Christ
Who has revealed Himself in streams,
And who enlightens those born on earth.

Today also

The Holy Female Martyr Agnes

&quot;As a thirteen year old girl, Agnes was thrown into the fire for the Faith of Christ and was then beheaded. She showed great miracle-working power during life and after death. Agnes suffered during the reign of Diocletian in the year 305 A.D.&quot;

It seems that for every Saint who died in peace hundred were murdered in most cruel ways. There is this abhorrent brutality in man....

 HYMN OF PRAISE 

 The spaciousness of the see broke out on all sides;

The earth as a trunk of the celestial garden,

But as a dark trunk with golden fruit--

Thus the dark earth with a starry firmament.

The earth silently extends its invisible branches,

And on the branches, stars, golden apples,

O, what wonderful fruit from an inexpensive mud,

What the mercy of God gave to the dark earth!

And man is earth; the body of the earth,

In the firmament are his stars; those are his good deeds,

His thoughts are rainbows, and they go to the end of the world -

Invisible branches, the stars are their tips!

Fruit! Fruit! the lord seeks from created man,

By fruit only, He judges man&apos;s life.

When death shakes the tree, may the golden apples

Of life fall into God&apos;s hands.

Then you will be able to say,&quot;I was not in vain -

Because of beautiful reality, I dreamed an ugly dream!&quot; 

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by renwdimgink on Jan 21, 2010, 1:49pm

I have been blessed to visit the monastery of St.George the Chozibite in Palestine on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho twice. It is situated in a wadi off the side of the highway, in the middle of the desert. You follow a winding path down into the wadi until, lo and behold! You find yourself in an oasis at the bottom with a small stream and palm trees and there built and carved into the rock walls we find the monastery itself. Sadly, there are not too many monastics there presently,(as is the case in most of the monasteries in the Holy land at present...) Where once there were thousands-a city in the desert. Still, it&apos;s a great place to visit!

In reading the lives of the Saints on a daily basis one is struck by the many, many martyrs and the horrible ways in which they were tortured. Of course, this does point out man&apos;s inhumanity to his fellow man, however, what comes across even more than that is the faith of these first Christian Martyrs.

Their faith was more than&quot;Wishful thinking,&quot;Gee, I sure hope God really exists and that there is an Heavenly Kingdom ?? No, their faith was a direct perception of another kind of reality.

They possessed a knowledge of God that allowed them to go willingly and even, joyfully into the other world, WITHOUT PUTTING UP ANY RESISTANCE TO THEIR TORTURERS, (in fact, converting many of them by the steadfastness of their faith, not to mention, the many miracles performed by them at the time of their martyrdom.)

These people were not simply deluded religious fanatics, but those who knew the reality of God and deemed it more valuable than anything the world has to offer, even life itself.

This is the kind of faith we hope to have, (and will probably be needing, as time goes on...) Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jan 22, 2010, 1:00pm

Having traveled to so many Holy Places, I can see why you are so knowledgable in matters of Orthodoxy, among many other subjects.

Yes, I read and marvel at how the Martyrs and Saints went to their deaths, as St. Ignatuis, for instance, teaching and preaching all the way while being led to His execution and asking those with Him not to lament or try to intervene. As to the cruelty of man to man, and animal I might add, all the Saints, Church Fathers, and the Church, ceaselessly preach to love God is to&quot;love thy Neighbor even as I have love you&quot;.

&quot;A strange and glorious mystery do I see&quot;, said St. Chrysostom, that&quot;their faith was a direct perception of another kind of reality&quot;can be &apos;heard&apos; by simply reading their words, not difficult, if they ring true they are, the only obstacle being, as Hermes avers, the time it takes to understand indicates the distance betwixt the Speaker and the Hearer or Reader, which, however, can close in a heartbeat when a truth strikes the Soul. St. Chrysostom and Dionysius guide the Mind so gently and easily to the Kingdom if it allows itself to be guided. If not, says the former, I can&apos;t help you.

There seem to be not enough days in the year, by far, to commemorate Apostles, Prophets, Church Fathers, Martyrs, Saints, and Hierarchy of Worthy Persons as we&quot;are from yesterday and the Church is from time immemorial&quot;. Today

The Holy Apostle Timothy

&quot;Tomothy was one of the seventy Apostles. He was born in Lystra in Lycaonia of a Greek father and Jewish mother. There He met St. Paul, and&quot;was an almost constant traveling companion of Paul, traveling with him to Achaia, Macedonia, Italy and Spain. Sweet in soul, he was agreat zealot for the Faith, and a superb teacher. After Paul&apos;s martyrdom, Timothy had St. John the Evangelist as his teacher. But when the Emperor Domentian banished John from Ephesus to the island of Patmos, Timothy remained in Ephesus to serve as bishop&quot;. Timothy was killed in 93 A.D. by pagans,&quot;his honerable relics were translated to Constantinople and interred in the Church of the Twelfe Apostles alongside the grave of St. Luke the Evangilist and St. Andrew the First-called.&quot;

Another who&quot;yearned for martyrdom&quot;was

The venerable Martyr Anastasius

&quot;Anastasius was a Persian by birth. His pagan name was Magundat. When Emperor Heraclitus warred with the persians, Magundat deserted to the Christians, went to Jerusalem where he was baptized and received the name Anastasius. It was not enough for him to be baptized, but, in order to give himself completely to serving the Lord he was tensured a monk. Among his other mortifications, Anastasius joyfully read the hagiography of the holy martyrs and in reading them he moistened the book with his tears and ardently yearned for martyrdom. The Lord finally crowned him with the martyrs wreath. In prison for a long time, Anastasius was suffocated under water and after being removed from the water the executioner beheaded him and sent his head to the emperor. He suffered on Januray 22, 628 A.D., in the town of Bethsaloe near Nineveh.&quot;

I wonder how these men could sleep, but there were some men who could not bring themselves to do such atrocities and died with them, blessed.

Gradually making connections, also with the Geography. On my calendar today

St. Gregory of Nyssa

A younger brother of St. Basil the Great, St. Gregory was one of the Church Fathers, along with St. Chrysostom - many times in my Mind.

In 372, St. Basil ordained His Brother Bishop of Nyssa in Cappadocia, the region 500 miles of Istanbul, to which the current Patriarch of Constantinople, His All Holiness Bartolomew, sent Bob Simon of&quot;60 Minutes&quot;, aired recently, and where Mr. Simon found&quot;a world of unfathomable beauty&quot;in the caves of&quot;a city of stones&quot;.

Saint Gregory&quot;was present at the Council of Antioch, and later at the Second Ecumenical Council (381) which took place in Constantinople. There He defended the Nicene Creed against the Arians.&quot;Before St. Gregory, at the First Council of Necene in 325, St. Spyridon countered the arguments of the Arians, i.e., that Christ was created, not begotten, is subordinate to the Father, not consubstantial with the Father and Holy Spirit as is the doctrine of the Orthodox Church. By the highest vision I ever had, in which nothing was but pure consciousness, including myself, and which Steven stated to be the&quot;Holy Spirit&quot;, I can somewhat understand the Consubstantiality of the Holy Trinity.

&quot;Gregory speaks of three stages of spiritual growth: initial darkness of ignorance, then spiritual illumination, and finally a darkness of the mind in contemplation of God who in being essense (ousia) cannot be comprehended.&quot;

I will continue with this&quot;Darkness&quot;Dionysius the Areopagite treats of in His understandable diction.

&quot;It is only through not-knowing and not-seeing that God can, paradoxically, be known and seen, knowledge that can only be gained through an&quot;ascending life of holiness.&quot;This notion would be extremely influential in both Western and Eastern spirituality, via the mystical writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite , and later the anonymous 14th century work , The Cloud of Unknowing. Thus he is a major figure in the history of apophatic theology and spirituality.&quot;St. Gregory is.

&quot;Related to this is Gregory&apos;s idea of epectasis or constant progress. Platonic metaphysics holds that stability is perfection and change is for the worse. In contrast, Gregory describes the ideal of human perfection as constant progress in virtue and godliness. In his theology, God himself has always been perfect and has never changed, and never will. Humanity fell from grace in the Garden of Eden, but rather than return to an unchanging state, humanity&apos;s goal is to become more and more perfect, more like God, even though humanity will never understand, much less attain God&apos;s transcendence. This idea has a profound influence on the Eastern Orthodox teaching regarding theosis or divinization.&quot;

Theosis does not teach that&quot;humanity will never understand, much less attain, God&apos;s transcendence....&quot;, the term is not fitting, Theosis teaches how to regain our Image and Likeness to God, to become gods by Grace.

&quot;Platonic &apos;metaphysics&apos; holds that stability is perfection and change is for the worse.&quot;My Phi-Teacher taught no such thing, that understanding is someone&apos;s interpretation.&quot;Our stability is but balance, and conduct lies in the masterful administration of the unforeseen&quot;, teaches the Divine Poet, meaning, since we are not yet Masters, we have to be vigilant about being stable, foresee what might come tomorrow resulting from our thoughts and actions of yesteryear and today and ministering to it&quot;according to our ability&quot;, a phrase the Areopagite repeats many times. My Phi-Teacher required the reading of&quot;Cloud of Unknowing&quot;, and it still surrounds the particulars in my head, but not so much the bigger picture.

 THE NICENE CREED 

I believe in one God, Father Almighty, Creator of
heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of
God, begotten of the Father before all ages;

Light of Light, true God of true God, begotten,
not created, of one essence with the Father
through Whom all things were made.

Who for us men and for our salvation
came down from heaven and was incarnate
of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man.

He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate,
and suffered and was buried;

And He rose on the third day,
according to the Scripture.

He ascended into heaven
and is seated at the right hand of the Father;

And He will come again with glory to judge the living
and dead. His kingdom shall have no end.

And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Creator of life,
Who proceeds from the Father, Who together with the
Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified, Who
spoke through the prophets.

In one, holy, and apostolic Church.

I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.

I look for the resurrection of the dead,
and the life of the age to come.

Amen.

And POETRY in her task of adorning spirit,
trustful also and faithful to the instinct of man,
honoureth ever the steeds above the charioteer.
She once would favor Selfhood, but &apos;tis now the foal;
and learning sapphic languar in the labour of love,
the Muse hath doff&apos;d her armour for a silken robe;
yet in her swooning lyxery she hath never match&apos;d
nor disthroned bearded Homer&apos;s great epic of war;
altho&apos; thatt siege of Troy was in the beginning
wrath and concupiscence, and in the end thereof
tragedy so tearful that no mind can approve,
nor any gentle heart can take comfort in the event.
But these and all old tales of far-off things, bygones,
of long-ago whereof memory still holdeth shape,
Time and the Muse hav purged of their unhappiness;
with their bright broken beauty they pervade the abyss&apos;
peopling the Solitude with gorgeous presences;
as those bare lofty columns, time-whiten&apos;d relics
of Atlantean adoration, upstanding lone
in Baalbec or Palmyra, proudly affront the waste
and with rich thought atone the melancholy of doom.

Yet since of all, whatever hath once been, evil or good,
tho&apos; we can think not of it and remember it not,
nothing can wholly perish; so ther is no birthright
so noble or stock so clean, but it transmitteth dregs,
contamination at core of old brutality;
inchoate lobes, dumb shapes of ancient terror abide:
tho&apos; fading still in the oceanic deeps of the mind
their eyeless sorrow haunt the unfathom&apos;d density,
dulling the crystal lense of prophetic vivion,
crippling the nerve that ministereth to trembling strenght,
distorting the features of our nobility.
And we, living at prime, what is it now to us
how our forefathers dream&apos;d, suffer&apos;d, struggled, or wrought?
how thru&apos; the obliterated aeons of man&apos;s ordeal
unnumber&apos;d personalities seperatly endured?
Think not to explore, estimate and accumulate
those infinit dark happenings into a single view
that might affect with true judgment of thought:
Imagination that , that would set science that task,
is as the astronomer who, with peduncled eye
screw&apos;d here and there at some minutest angle-space
of the wide heav&apos;ns, thinketh by piecemeal reckoning
to pictur and comprehend the illimitable worlds
thronging eternity; his highest fantasy
is like an athtet&apos;s dream that he hath leapt off the globe.
when all his waking powers is to jumping up and fall
the height of his own headall that the best can do.


Where it not then well to enquire of Reason, ere we admit
her condemnation of War, seeing it so firmly entrench&apos;d
in the immemorial practice and good favor of man,
whence hath she fetch&apos;d her high authority, her right
of spiritual judgment? WHENCE THEN COMETH WISDOM?

Post by renwdimgink on Jan 24, 2010, 8:13pm

The Sunday of the publican and the Pharisee is the first of four Sundays leading up to Great Lent.

The fruit of Humility is freedom.

True freedom consists of freedom from opinions. Freedom from the opinions of others and, even more so, freedom from our own opinions.

Being subjected to the opinions of others is bad enough, but being subject to our own opinions is even worse because we always believe that our opinions are correct, for, after all, they are OUR opinions.

The knowledge of God however, (The knowledge that comes to us from God,) is not an opinion but an absolute truth.

Happy is he who attains to this knowledge and, in true humility, bows to it and acts upon it.

Then one is truly free. Free from error. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jan 25, 2010, 12:21pm

Fr Ceko also amplified Humility after the Reading of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector, the former thanking God that he is not like other man, i.e., an extortioner, unjust, adulterer or the tax collector, that he fasts twice a week and gives tithes of all he possesses, whereas the taxcollector,&quot;standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other, for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exulted.&quot;

Pride, judgment of others, and opinions are hard to overcome, pride being the easiest, however,&quot;I am so proud of you&quot;is ingrained and encouraged to say, and the one commended is so proud of themselves they can hardly stand it, but it also encourages to do even better, that&apos;s my opinion.

Opinions themselves are not all that damaging because we say &apos;that&apos;s my opinion&apos;, or &apos;I think&apos; this so or not, a fact we can only state from experience, then we say &apos;in fact&apos;. &apos;Judgment of others&apos; is the worst, &apos;Freedom from our own opinions&apos; the best.

Pure Humility as I experienced knows only Thankfulness, no thought beside. As Father Ceko yesterday commented that we call Jesus Christ the King of Kings, we think of all the Noble and Virtues He associated with, and cited many other examples, but God destroyes all these notions, as He went among the poor and sinners and walked in Humility.

So yes, reading of the life of the Saints, one becomes humble, even shamed I feel when I read of the Martyrs, as today

The Holy Martyr Tatiana of Rome

 http://elevationperception.blogspot.com/2008/01/st-tatianas-day.html 

&quot;When the virgin Tatiana was led to Martyrdom, she prayed for her executioners. And lo, their eyes were opened and they saw four angels around the Martyr. Seeing this, eight of them were converted to Christ, for which they were tortured and killed. St. Tatiana&apos;s mar-tyrdom was long-drawn-out: she was flogged, parts of her flesh cut off, she awas sawn with an iron saw, and then, all disfigured and bleeding, was flung that evening into prison to be brought out on the following day for further torture. But God sent His angel to the prison, to give her courage and heal her wounds. Tatiana, there-fore, appeared before her torturers each morning in perfect health. She was thrown to a lion, but the lion became tame before her and did her no harm. Her hair was shorn, for an idea that occurred to their godless minds that some sorcery might be hidden in it, some magical strenght. Finally she was led out, together with her father, and the two were beheaded. In such manner this heroic maiden finished her earthly life in about the year 225, and was crowned with an immortal crown of glory. She had the weak body of a women, but a manly and valiant spirit.&quot;

His Grace, Bishop Irinej Gavrilovik of Nis was elected the 45th Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The Patriarchate of Pech is the historic seat of the historic chief of the Serbian Orthodox Church. His Grace was Administrator at Saint Steven&apos;s Cathedral from 1985-1986.

I also read of the struggle between His All Holiness, Patriarch Bartholomew and&quot;the zealot monks&quot;on Mt. Athos&quot;violently opposing attempts to mend a rift between the Orthodox and Catholic churches....&quot;. A prayer for the Catholic Church is said during each Vesper and Liturgy.

Dionysius the Areopagite

The superessential Darkness which is hidden by all the light in created things. 

Chapter III

 What are the affirmations and the negations concerning God? 

In the Theological Outlines we have set forth
the principal affirmative expressions concerning
God, and have shown in what sense God&apos;s Holy
Nature is One, and in what sense Three; what is
within It which is called Paternity, what Filiation,
and what is signified by the name Spirit; how
from the uncreated and indivisible Good, the
blessed and perfect Rays of its Goodness proceed,
and yet abide immutably one both within their
Origin and withing themselves and each other, co-
eternal with the act by which they
spring from it; how the superessential Jesus enters
in essential state in which the truth of human
nature meet: and other matters made known by
the Oracles are exponded in the same place.

Again, in treatise on Divine Names, we have
considered the meaning, as concerning God, of
the titles of the Good, of Being, of Life, of Wisdom,
of Power, and of such other names as are applied
to it; further, in Symbolical Theology we have
considered what are the metaphorical titles drawn
from the world od sense and applied to the nature
of God; what is meant by the material and
intellectual images we form of it, or the functions
and instruments of activity attributed to it; what
are the places where it dwells and the raiment in
which it is adorned; what is meant by God&apos;s anger,
grief and indignation, or the divine inebriation;
what is meant by God&apos;s oaths and threats, by Its
slumber and waking: and all sacred and
symbolical representations. And it will be
observed how far more copious and diffused are
the last terms than the first, for the theological
doctrine and the exposition of the Divine Names
are necessarily more brief than the Symbolical
Theology.

For the higher we soar in contemplation the more
limited become our expressions of that which is
purely intelligible; even as now, when plunging
into the Darkness that is above the intellect, we
pass not merely into brevety of speech, but even
into absolute silence of thoughts and of words.
Thus, in the former discourse, our contemplations
descended from the highest to the lowest,
embracing an ever-widening number of
conceptions, which increased at each stage of the
descent; but in the present discourse we mount
upwards from the below to that which is the highest,
and, according to the degree of transcendence, so
our speech is restrained until, the entire ascent
being accomplished, we become wholly voiceless,
inasmuch as we are absorbed in it that is totally
ineffable. But why, you will ask,
&apos;does the affirmative method begin from the
highest attributes, and the negative method with
the lowest abstractions? The reason is because,
when affirming the subsitence of That which
transcends all affirmation, we necessarily start
from the attributes most closely related to It and
upon which the remaining affirmations depend;
but when pursuing the negative method to reach
That which is beyond all abstraction, we must
begin by applying our negations to things which
are most remote from It.

For it is not more true to affirm that God is Life
and Goodness than that God is air or stone; and
must we not deny to God more emphatically the
attributes of inebriation and wrath than the
applications of human speech and thought?


Human speech and thought is better than attributing to God inebriation, and wrath.

Saint Nina, Equal to the Apostles, Enlightener of Georgia

&quot;Nina was a relative of St. George the Great Martyr and Juvenal, the Patriarch of Jerusalem. Her parents belonged to the nobility in Cappadocia and since they both were tensured in the monastic state, Nina was educated under the tutelage of Patriarch Juvenal. Hearing about the people of Georgia, the virgin Nina, from an early age, desired to go to Georgia and to baptize the Georgians. The All-Holy Mother og God appeared to Nina and promised to taker her to this land. When our Lord opened the way, the young Nina, indeed, traveled to Georgia where, , in a short period of time, she gained the love of the Georgian people. Nina succeeded in baptizing the Georgian Emperor Mirian , his wife and their son Bakar, who, later on, zealously assisted in Nina&apos;s missionary work. During her lifetime, Nina traveled throughout Georgia, mainly to convert the entire nation to the Faith of Christ, exactly at the time of the terrible persecution of the Christians at the hands of Emperor Diocletian. Having rested from her many labors, Nina died in the Lord in the year 335 A.D. Her body is entombed in the Cathedral Church in Mtzkheta. She worked many miracles during her life and after death.&quot;

Troparion of St. Nina

O handmaid of the Word of God
who in preaching equaled the first-called Apostle Andrew
And emulated the other Apostles
Enlightener of Iberia and reed-pipe of the Holy Spirit
Holy Nina, pray to Christ our God to save our souls.

The Cathedral Saint Nina rests, and an intriguing legend.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetitskhoveli_Cathedral 


Honered on my Church Calendar is another&quot;Enlightener&quot;of a momentous time in the Church History

Our Holy Father Sava I
Enlightener and First Archbishop of the Serbs (+1235)

The Cathedral of St. Sava in Belgrade, the largest Orthodox Church in the world, was one of the first I found and admired for its beautiful Architecture. It remainds one of the Taj Mahal.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Saint_Sava 

THE SERBIAN Grand Zhupan (Patriarchal leader) Stephen Nemanja had two sons, Stephen and Vukan; yet, he and his wife Anna desired, if it be God&apos;s will, to have another child.&quot;

Their third child was born in 1175, and at Baptism was named Rastko, which means&quot;to grow&quot;. Prince Rastko became Sava,&quot;and still remains the most beloved of all Serbian Saints.&quot;Sava is the Brother of St. Steven the First Crowned, Patron of the Church I attend, and recently wrote about.

 http://www.kosovo.net/sava.html 

The above is a very interesting link of St. Sava&apos;s Life, with beautiful pictures of Mt. Athos and its Monasteries. The Hilander Monastery has a bell tower where St. Sava hid from soldiers to take Him home on orders of His Father. I found a note on the&quot;Swinging icon-lamp&quot;of the Iveron Monastery on the Holy Mountain.

&quot;Moskow, September 4, Interfax - A silver lamp before the royal doors in the cathedral of the Iveron Monastery in Mount Athos started swinging back and forth early August not long before Georgian troops attacked Tskhinvali.

&quot;Athos monks claim that the icon-lamp has started swinging by itself during many centuries on the eve of great disasters and trails, the Zhizn daily writes.

&quot;The lamp was swinging before the six-day war in Israel, an earthquake in Armenia, and before the American troops invaded Iraq it was swinging so much that oil almost splashed out, the paper says.

&quot;When the lamp starts swinging, all monasteries of the Holy Mount are informed of it. Priests and monks intensify their prayers to the Holy Virgin and ask her to grant mercy and protect from trouble.&quot;

My&quot;retired Chemist&quot;Teacher once told us that things and events thought by the Human Mind &apos;occur&apos; or constellate themselves invisibly right &apos;above&apos; us in the ther, and even during events these invisible powers, good or bad, angels or demons, are present. For instance, a war is being fought above the battle field on the ground. Thoughts are real and every prayer changes the Universe.

Again, I like to give this link for those who may have missed it or didn&apos;t scroll down, as pertains to our Heritage. All this reminds me of the rare and warm atmosphere about the Aegean Sea when in Delphi.

I have friends in both Serbia and Georgia whom I would love to visit there someday.

As far as Philetheo goes, my son,Alexander and I spent a night there when we visited Mt. Athos several years ago. I would love to go back there, as well.

One of the former abbots of Philetheo, Fr. Ephraim, came here to North America many years ago and has built at least a dozen monasteries here. He lives at St. Anthony&apos;s monastery in Arizona. He is a spiritual Father to many people and is considered to be one of the living clairvoyant wonder-workers in our day.

We have been fortunate enough to see him and receive his blessing many times over the course of the past 18 years.

Elder Ephraim also has a close relationship with St. Paisius monestary in Safford,AZ where my daughter went to school for a year and a half. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jan 28, 2010, 11:10am

Where might have you not been and whom have you not met, I&apos;m beginning to think. I read about Fr. Ephraim this morning. Speaking of St. Anthony, commemorated today is the First Desert Father

Venerable Paul of Thebes

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_of_Thebes 

Complimentary to the &apos;Legend&apos;

The Prologue from Ohrid

&quot;Paul was born of wealthy parents in Lower Thebes in Egypt during the reign of Emperor Decius. Paul, along with his sister, inherited all the property of their parents. But his brother-in-law, an idolater, wanted to confiscate Paul&apos;s share of the property and threatened to betray Paul before the judge as a Christian if he did not cede his property to him. On one hand, that misfortune and on the other hand those heroic examples of self-sacrifices of Christian martyrs which Paul saw with his own eyes motivated him to give his share of the property to his sister and he, as a pauper, withdrew into the desert where he lived an ascetical life until his death. To what spiritual hights this ascetical giant reached is witnessed by no less a person than St. Anthony the Great who, at one time, visited Paul nd saw how the wild beasts and birds of heaven ministered to him. Returning from his visit, Anthony said to his monks,&quot;Woe is me, my children! A sinful and false monk that I am, a monk only in name. I saw Elijah, I saw John in the wilderness and, in truth, I saw Paul in Paradise!&quot;St. Paul lived one-hundred thirtheen years and peacefully died in the Lord in the year 342 A.D.&quot;

Even as there is an endless list of Saints, so endless are their Writings, and Orthodox Literature of anything one desires to know, and it&apos;s difficult to choose what to read or write first, second and third.

I would like to add a few words by Dionysius, and finishing with this part, begin a new thread dedicated solely to His Teachings so they can be read in continuity. The Illuminated Areopagite makes light of everything until the Divine Darkness is reached, or as my Phi-Teacher said,&quot;when in discourse you can no longer divide a thing, then in silence you perceive the Truth.&quot;Socrates.

Chapter IV

 That it that is the pre-eminent Cause of all things
sensibly perceived is not itself any of those things. 

We therefore maintain that the universal and
transcendent Cause of all things is neither without
being nor without life, nor without reason or
intelligence; nor is it a body, nor has it form or
shape, quality, quantity or weight; nor has it any
localized, visible ot tangible existence; it is not
sensible ot perceptable; nor is it subject to any
disorder or inordination nor influenced by any
earthly passion; neither is it rendered impotent
through the effects of material causes and events;
it needs no light; it suffers no change, corruption,
division, privation or flux; none of these things
can either be identified with or attributed unto it.

Beautiful to behold, pristine and serene fields, a road as if never traveled, and a cloud formation never to be repeated captured in a moment of time. On such I gaze every morning, some spectacular beyond words, and sublime, and my lofty thoughts are almost stilled in wonder and Thankfulness of a new day in God&apos;s Creation. The Moon streaming her light in 4 directions looked into my bedroom window this morning and I linger&apos;d for a while in a caravan of dreams....


The Mystical Theology of Dionysius, and the Darkness of the ancient Egyptians.

CHAPTER V

 That it that is the pre-eminent Cause of all things
intelligibly perceived is not itself any of those things. 

Again, ascending yet higher, we maintain that it is
neither souls not intellect; nor has it imagination,
opinion reason or understanding; nor can it be
expressed or conceived, since it is neither number
nor order; nor greatness nor smallness; nor
equality nor inequality; nor similarity nor
dissimilarity; neither is it standing, nor moving,
nor at rest; neither has it power nor is it power, nor
is it light; neither does it live nor is it life: neither is
it essence, nor eternity nor time; nor is it subject
to intelligible contact; nor is it science nor truth,
nor kingship nor wisdom, neither one nor
oneness, nor godhead nor goodness; nor is it spirit
according to our understanding, nor filiation, nor
paternity; nor anything else known to us or to any
other beings of the things that are or the things
that are not; neither does anything that is known it
as it is; nor does it know existing things according
to existing knowledge; neither can the reason
attain to it, nor name it, nor know it; neither is it
darkness nor light, nor the false nor the true; nor
can any affirmation or negation be applied to it,
for although we may affirm or deny the things
below it, we can neither affirm nor deny it,
inasmuch as the all-perfect and unique Cause of
all things transcends all affirmation, and the
simple pre-eminence of Its absolute nature is
outside of every negation- free from evvery
limitation and beyond all of them.

(1) Unknowing, or agnosia, is not ignorance or
nescience as ordinarily understood, but rather the
realization that no finite knowledge can fully
know the Infinate One, and that therefore it is only
truly to be approached by agnosia, or by that
which is beyond and above knowledge. There are
two main kinds of darkness: the subdarkness and
the super-darkness, between which lies, as it were,
an octave of light. But the neather-darkness and the
Divine Darkness are not the same darkness, for
the former is absence of light, while the latter is
excess of light. The one symbolizes mere
ignorance, and the other a transcendent
unknowing - a superknowledge not obtained by
means of the discursive reason.

(2) &apos;Of the First Principle,&apos; says Damascius, &apos;the
ancient Egyptians said nothing, but celebrated it
as a Darkness beyond all intellectual or spiritual
perception - a Trice-unknown Darkness.&apos; This is
for ever about the Pavillions of that great Light
Unapproachable. It is caused by the
superabundance of Light and not by the absence
of lumination: it is &apos;a deep but dazzling
Darkness&apos; (Henry Vaughan). &apos;The light shineth in
the darkness&apos; (St.John, 1,5). &apos;in Thy light we
shall see light&apos; (Psalm 36, 9).

(3) St. John of the Cross, for instance, wrote of
other kinds of darkness; for example, the darkness
of the night of purgation, and the dark night of the
soul, but the Divine Darkness is in a different
category from these.

(4) Particularly important here is the concept of
beyond-being, the recognition that waht is known
in the unknowing is beyond the realm of being
and cannot be adequately described, although
negation comes closer than affirmation.

(5) Compare the well-known analogy of Plotinus:

&apos;Withdraw into yourself and look; and if you do
not find yourself beautiful as yet, do as does the
sculptor of a statue ... cut away all that is
excessive, straighten all that is crooked, bring
light to all that is shadowed ... do not cease until
there shall shine out on you the Godlike
Splendour of Beauty; until you see temperance
surely established in the stainless shrine.
(Ennead, 1,6, 9).

Veneration of Apostle Peter&apos;s Precious Chains

&quot;Herod Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the Great and king of the Jews, grew wroth against the Church of Christ, and slew James, the brother of John the Eangelist. Seeing that this pleased the Jews, he took Peter also in custody and locked him up in prison, intending to keep him there until the feast of the Passover, so that he could win the favor of the people by presenting him as a victim. But the Apostle was saved when he was miraculously set free by an Angel (Acts 12:1 - 19). The chains wherewith the Apostle were bound received from his most sacred body the grace of sanctification and healing, which is bestowed upon the faithful who draw nigh with faith.&quot;

Apolytikion in the Fourth Tone

Without ever leaving Rome, tho didst come to us by the precious chains whoch thou didst wear. O foremost of the Apostles. And worshipping them with faith, we pray: By thine intercessions with God, grant us great mercy.

Kontakion in the Second Tone

Now Christ God, the Rock, doth glorify the rock of faith, illustriously, in calling all to celebrate the dread wonders of the most precious chains of Peter, the first and chief of the disciples of Christ our God, Who granteth forgiveness of sins unto all.

Anthony the Great

St. Anthony of the desert, as St. Paul, was born in Egypt, and lived almost all His life in the desert by the Red Sea. He visited St. Paul as mentioned in my post on St. Paul. Like St. Paul, St. Anthony sold all His posessions and died in the desert in 356 at the age of onehundred and five years of age.

Apolytikion

O Father Anthony, you imitated the zealous Eliijah.
You followed the straight paths of the Baptist and became a desert dweller.
By prayer you confirmed the universe.
Wherefore, intercede with Christ our God to save our souls.

Kontakion
Forsaking the uproars of life O venerable one,
you completed your life in quiet, fully imitating the Baptist.
Therefore, we honor you with him, O Anthony, Father of Fathers.

The Three Hierarchs, Saint Basil, Saint Gregory, and Saint Chrysostom, are also honered.

Fasting and Faith - Basil.

Theology - Gregory.

Acts of Charity - Chrysostom.

 Golden mouths, mouths of honey!

All laborers of one work;

Three seperately - three angels,

The three together as God in one,

No one is the main one, no one is secondary.

In eternity, they all agree,

You invoke one, all three help,

You hymn one, all three hear,

You glorify one, all three rejoice.

Three men, one whole;

Three Hierarchs, one deed;

Three names, one glory,

To all three of them, Christ is the Head. 


One of my favorite readings from St. Chrysostom, the Physician who heals in a latent manner.

 Saint John, a trumpet forged of gold,

Heralded to mankind, the mercy of God,

Miraculous mercy, which even loves the sinners,

Wonderful mercy, that shines through the sun,

And with the moon, amazes the earth,

In the cradle of stars, mercy, he is rocking,

The awesome mercy from bloody Golgatha,

Where God Crucified forgives the crime of the world,

Mercy of fear, forgiveness and glory,

Mercy which the angels sing,

Of which the whole of creation drinks,

Which only the saints glorify,

Mercy which is a balm to the ill,

Joy to the simple, foolishness to the scribes,

Antidote for the proud and a punishment for the vain;

The mercy of God, which all creation enjoys,

Which is poured out like a current of air,

Mercy that covers all sins -

Such mercy - unknown until Christ,

Eternal glow, from Christ radiated.

O Teacher of God&apos;s mercy,

Pray to God that He forgive our sins.

Ideas and influences spiritually descern&apos;d
are of their essence pure: but in the lot of man
nothing is wholly pure; yet all hindrance to good
be good and evil two in love or one in strife
maketh occasion for it, by contrast heightening,
by challenge and revelly arousing virtues to act.
Hence &apos;twill not be with men only of contention and hate,
nor only with the ambitious and disorderly
that combat findeth favor; honest men good and true
who seek peace and ensue it, seeing war as the field
for exercise of spirit that else might fust unused,
embrace the good, and cavil not the inherent terms,
rather welcoming hardship; which by affraying cowards
purgeth heroic ranks: and battle rallieth all
keen-hearted sportmen and the brave gamesters of life,
adventurers whose joy danceth on peril&apos;s edge,
for who life hath no relish save in danger of death;
who love sport for its hazard, and of all their sports
where hazard is at highest look find the best
there on the field where hourly they may stake their all.
And &apos;tis because they feel their spirit&apos;s ecstacy
is owing in nought to Reason, but exultantly
blendeth with the old Selfhood wherefrom it sprang&apos;tis thus
they can be friendly at heart with nature&apos;s heartlessness,
nor heed the wrongs and cruelties that come and pass,
overlook&apos;d as by men who have suffer&apos;d not nor see.

ut we who have seen, condemn&apos;d in savage self-defence
to train our peaceful folk in the instruments of death,
and of massacre and mourning hav suffer&apos;d four years
we hav no need to recount in vindication of peace,
sorrows which no glory of heroism can atone,
horrors which to forget wer cowardice and wrong,
dishonesty of heart and repudiation of soul,
yet gladly might forget in the passing of pain;
and memory is so complacent that we well may fear
lest our children forget;and see nature already,
regardless how her fractious babe had scratch&apos;d her cheek,
hath with her showy Invincibles retaken amain
the trenches, and reclothed the devastated lands.
See with how placid mien Athena unhelmeted
reentering hath possess&apos; her desolated halls;
how her musical temples and grave schools are throng&apos;d
with fresh youth eager as ever with the old books and games&apos;
their life abounding mirth reechoing from the walls;
where antique monuments their brother&apos;s names
in long death-roll await the mellowing touch of time.
And why not we forget? How is&apos;t that we dare not
wish to forget and cut this canker of memory
from us, as men disceased in one part of their flesh
find health in mutilation: as if our agony
wer a boon to keep, when in its own happy riddance
&apos;twould die off in a natural oblivion of things,
and with our follies fade: so, each one for himself
disbanding his self-share, Reason would dissipate
its own delusion, and lay that spectre of our dismay,
the accumilation of griefs; to which war hath no right
prior or prerogative: miseries lay as thick
and horrors worse than Plague invaded the cities,
Athens or London, raging with polluted flood
in every house, and with revolting torture rack&apos;d
the folk to loathsom deaths; nor men kenn&apos;d as they fell,
despratly unrepentant to the&quot;scourge of God&quot;,
how &apos;twas the crowded foulness of their own bodies
punish&apos;d them so:alas then in what plight are we,
knowing &apos;twas mankind&apos;s crowded uncleanness of soul
that brought our plague! which yet we could not cure nor stay;
for Reason had lost control of his hot-temper&apos;d steed
and taken himself infection of the wild brute&apos;s madness;
so when its fire slacken&apos;d and the fierce fight wore out,
our fever&apos;d pulse show&apos;d no sober return of health.
Amid the flimsy joy of the uproarious city
my spirit on those first jubilant days of armistice
was heavier within me, and felt a profound fear
than ever it knew in all the War&apos;s darkest dismay.

The Poet Divine Re: The Secret of the Universe

After riotous living the Prodigal Son came home, was the message yesterday, of living in the world as it is and growing tired of the&quot;The Nothing&quot;Bastian leaves becoming the Great Warrior Atreyu to embark on a terrifying journey to find the Empress who gives him the Pearl of Great Price.

I am reminded again of a Startreck episode I watched years ago, where three or four times the same strange scene was inserted out of context which I found so odd, viz, on a ranch in wine country in Northern California, a Man and Lady were sitting on a bench, and as if reminiscing the the Lady told of a Man who had a great vineyard and two sons, one stayed at home to tend to his Fathers vineyard and the other left home to become a Clingon, but that he wasn&apos;t all that bad and came back home again. Of course, I thought of the Prodigal Son Parable.

Though Father Norman was back, I think from the Winter Camp with Children, Father Ceko served the Matins again, but all the while, and even in the morning, if I may say so, I had a feeling that His Grace, Bishop Maxim, was near. The Matins being over, His Grace walked silently upon the aisle carpet toward the Altar and stood silent. All was silent and dignified. Bishop Maxim served the Holy Liturgy and all I will say Grace was in the Church.

Much to my dismay I can&apos;t give any comments as I forgot my Church Bulletin, but Fr. Ceko annouced that on Sunday, February 21, will be a Great Feast with several Bishops and Church Dignitaries attending, among Whom, it is my hope, will be the Elder Priest Love and Light about Him, I mentioned before.

Instead, Jacob Boeme, who tells that&quot;after a hard fight with the powers of darkness, my spirit broke through the doors of hell, and penetrated even to the innermost essence of its newly born divinity where it was received with great love, as a bridegroom welcomes his beloved bride.

&quot;No words can express the great joy and triumph I experienced, as of a life out of death, as of a resrrection from the dead! While in this state, as I was walking through a field of flowers, in fifteen minutes, I saw the mystery of creation, the original of this world and of all creatures . . . Then for seven days I was in a continual state of ecstacy, surrounded by the light of the Spirit, which immersed me in contemplation and happiness. I learned what God is and what is His will . . . I knew not how this happened to me, but my heart admired and praised the Lord for it.&quot;

Macarius of Egypt, Lamp of the Desert

Macarius the Great was born in Upper Egypt, I think I read near Asyut, where the Great Plotinus was born, and a town the train stopped on the way to Luxor. Trains in Egypt are actually somewhat luxurious compared to the usual life there, but I think I was in a first class coach, the Host and people very helpful, nodding with smiles of &apos;approval&apos; and encouragement and I felt welcome and very comfortable.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macarius_of_Egypt 

Saint Macarius fled to the Nitrian Desert,&quot;visited Anthony the Great and learned from him the laws and rules of monasticism&quot;, remembering the St. Anthony visited the Hermit St. Paul of Thebes.

Due to a dispute concerning the Necene Creed, Saint Macarius&quot;was banished to an island in the Nile by Emperor Valens&quot;, and upon his return was&quot;met by a multitude of monks of the Nitrian Desert, numbered fifty thousand, among whom were Saint Pishoy and St. John the Dwarf&quot;, the latter being the first desert dweller I &apos;met&apos;. Fifty thousand monks? The article below states&quot;more than four thousand&quot;, perhaps an error, but the Western Desert is a huge area.&quot;The entirety of the Nitrian Desert is sometimes called the Desert of Macarius, for he was the pioneer monk in the region. The ruins of numerous monasteries in this region almost confirm the local tradition that the cloisters of Macarius were equal in number to the days of the year.&quot;

Thanks to Jimmy Dunn

The Wadi el Natrun with its eight lakes producing Natron salt is ca. 135 km from Cairo, and one of the most sacred regions for Christians. In the Western Desert is also the&quot;The White Desert&quot;of which we spoke and viewed the awesome images some years ago, remember Don? Some 365 km from Cairo is the Bahariya Oasis where Zahi Hawass found the&quot;Golden Mummies&quot;. Further west is Siwa where the Great Alexander affirmed His Divine Nature. Perhaps the Macedonian found the Smaragdine Tablet of Hermes there, which He is said to have buried or hidden after reading it.

The Coptic Pope Cyril VI ordered 12 monks living secluded in caves at Wadi El Rayyon, 50 km south of Fayoum to restore the Monastery of Saint Macarius at Wadi Natrun where His body rests. The Saint reposed at the age of ninety, in the year 391.

Had I only known that&quot;the Monastery of St. Macarius lies in Wadi Natrun, the ancient Scetis, 92 kilometers from Cairo on the western side of the desert road to Alexandria&quot;, nothing could have stopped me from visiting the place on one of the trips to Alex, because I, and one of my Sisters also, liked visiting Kloisters and Churches wherever we traveled.

 http://www.stmacariusmonastery.org/eabout.htm 

The Monastery&quot;was founded in 360 A.D. by St. Macarius the Egyptian, who was spiritual father to more than four thousand monks of different nationalities-Egyptians, Greeks, Ethiopians, Armenians, Nubians, Asians, Palestinians, Italians, Gauls and Span-lards. There were among them men of letters and philosophers, and members of the aristocracy of the time, along with simple illiterate peasants. From the fourth century up to the present day the monastery has been continuously inhabited by monks. Fr. Matta el Meskeen has written a major work (in Arabic) on the history and archaeology of the Monastery of St. Macarius entitled&quot;Coptic Monasticism in the time of St. Macarius&quot;Cain, 1972, 880 pp.]

There is a Coptic Orthodox Church within walking distance from where I live and have looked at for years driving by.

&quot;Saint Macarius taught a wonderful simplicity.&quot;Christians&quot;, he said,&quot;should judge no one, neither an open harlot, nor sinners, nor dissolute people, but should look upon all with simplicity of soul and a pure eye. Purity of heart, indeed, consists in seeing sinful and weak men and having compassion for them and being merciful.&quot;On the subject of prayer he counselled,&quot;It is enough if you will often repeat from your heart, &apos;Lord, as it pleases Thee and as Thou knowest, have mercy on me.&apos; And if temptation comes upon you:&quot;Lord, help me!&quot;The Lord knows what is profitable for us and has mercy on us.&quot;

 TO MY FELLOW PRESBYTER, TIMOTHY,
DIONYSIUS THE PRESBYTER 

 What is the purpose of the discourse, and what the tradition concerning Divine Names. 

 SECTION I. 

&quot;Now then, O Blessed One, after the Theological Outlines, I will pass to the interpretation of the Divine Names, as best I can.

&quot;But, let the rule of the Oracles be here also prescribed for us, viz., that we shall establish the truth of the things spoken concerning God, not in the persuasive words of man&apos;s wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit-moved power of the Theologians, by aid of which we are brought into contact with things unutterable and unknown, in a manner unutterable and unknown, in proportion to the superior union of the reasoning and intuitive faculty and operation within us. By no means then is it permitted to speak, or even to think, anything, concerning the superessential and hidden Deity, beyond those things divinely revealed to us in the sacred Oracles.

&quot;For Agnosia, (supra-knowledge) of its superessentiality above reason and mind and essenceto, it must attribute the superessential science, so far aspiring to the Highest, as the ray of the supremely Divine Oracles imparts itself, whilst we restrain ourselves in our approach to the higher glories by prudence and piety as regards things Divine. For, if we must place any confidence in the All Wise and most trustworthy Theology, things Divine are revealed and contemplated in proportion to the capacity of each of the minds, since the Supremely Divine Goodness distributes Divinely immeasurableness (as that which cannot be contained) with a justice which preserves those whose capacity is limited.

&quot;For, as things intelligble cannot be comprehended and contemplated by things of sense, and things uncompounded and unformed by things compounded and formed; and the intangible and unshaped formlessness of things without body, by those formed according to the shapes of bodies; in accordance with the self-same analogy of the truth, the superessential Illimitability is placed above things essential, and the Unity above mind above the Minds; and the One above conception is inconceivable to all conceptions; and the Good above word is unutterable by wordUnit making one every unit, and superessential essence and mind inconceivable, and Word unutterable, speechlessness and inconception, and namelessnessbeing after the manner of no existing being, and Cause of being to all, but Itself not being, as beyond every essence, and as It may manifest itself properly and scientifically concerning Itself.

When I spoke to Fr. Norman on the phone and told that I love the Matins, He asked&quot;how come I don&apos;t know you?&quot;, but I am only one of a few people present at the beginning, so He probably would have remembered me at your asking. One time, Fr. Norman handed out the Blessed Bread after the Holy Liturgy, and He bent down slightly and must have said something so beautiful that I didn&apos;t hear the words but only felt His smile and love. Daily I pray for thee.

Dionysius the Areopagite, Mystical Theology

 SECTION II. 

Concerning this then, as has been said, the superessential and hidden Deity, it is not permitted to speak or even think beyond the things divinely revealed to us in the sacred Oracle. For even as Itself has taught (as becomes Its goodness) in the Oracles, the science and contemplation of Itself in its essential Nature is beyond the reach of all created things, as towering superessentially above all. And you will find many of the Theologians, who have celebrated It, not only as invisible and incomprehensible, but also as instructable and untraceable, since there is no trace of those who have penetrated to Its hidden infinitude. The Good indeed is not entirely uncommunicated to any single created being, but benignly sheds forth its superessential ray, persistently fixed in Itself, by illuminations analogous to each several being, and elevates to Its permitted contemplation and communion and likeness, those holy minds, who, as far as is lawful and reverent, strive after It, and who are neither impotently boastful toward that which is higher than the harmoniously imparted Divine manifestation, nor, in regard to a lower level, lapse downward through their inclining to the worse, but who elevate themselves determinately and unwaveringly to the ray shining upon them; and, by their proportioned love of permitted illuminations, are elevated with a holy reverence, prudently and piously, as on new wings.

 SECTION III 

Following then, these, the suprememlyDivine standards, which also govern the who;e holy ranks of the supercelestial orders,whilst honering the unrevealed of the Godhead which is beyond mind and matter, with inscrutable and holy reverence of mind, and things unutterable, with a prudent silence, we elevate ourselves to the glories which illuminate us in the sacred Oracles, and are led by their light to the supremelyDivine Hymns, by which we are supermundanely enlightened and molded to the sacred Songs of Praise, so as both to see the supremely Divine illuminations given to us by them, according to our capacities, and to praise the good-living Source of every holy manifestation of light, as Itself has taught concerning Itself in the sacred Oracles. For instance, that It is cause and origin and essence and life of all things; and even of those who fall away from It, both recalling and resurrection; and of those who have lapsed to the perversion of the Divine likeness, renewal and reformation; of those who are tossed about in a sort of irreligious unsteadiness, a religious stability, of those who have continued to stand, steadfastness; of those who are being conducted to It, a protecting Conductor; of those being illuminated, illumination; of those being perfected, source of perfection; of those being deified, source of deification; of those being simplified, simplification; of those being unified, unity; of every origin superessentially super-original origin; and of the Hidden, as far as is right, beneficient communication; and, the life of the living, and essence of things that be; of all life and essence, origin and cause; because Its goodness produces and sustains things that be, in their being.

Mystical Theology

 SECTION IV. 

These things we have learned from the Divine Oracles, and you will find all the sacred Hymnology, so to speak, of the Theologians arranging the Names, of God with a view to make known and praise the beneficient progressions of the Godhead. Hence, we see in almost every theological treatise the Godhead religiously celebrated, both as Monad and unity, on account of the simplicity and oneness of Its supernatural indivisibility from which, as an unifying power, we are unified, and when our divided diversities have been folded together, in a manner supermundane, we are collected into a godlike unit and divinely-imitated union, but also in a Triad, on account of the tri-personal manifestation of the superessential productiveness, from which all paternity in heaven and on earth is, and is named; also, as cause of things existing, since all things were brought into being on account of Its creative goodness, both wise and good, because all things, whilst preserving the propertise of their own nature unimpaired, are filled with every inspired harmony and holy comeliness, but pre-eminently, as loving towards man, because It truly and wholly shared, in one of Its Persons (subsistencies), in things belonging to us, recalling to Itself and replacing the human extremity, out of which, in a manner unutterable, the simplex Jesus was composed, and the Everlasting took a temporal duration, and He, Who is superessentially exalted above every rank thoughout all nature, became within our nature, whilst retaining the unchangable and unconfused steadfastness of His own properties.

And whatever other divinely-wrought illuminations, conformable to the Oracles, the secret tradition of our inspired leaders bequeathed to us for our enlightenment, in these also we have been initiated, now indeed, according to our capacity, through the sacred veils of the loving-kindness toward man, made known in the Oracles and hierarchical traditions, which envelope things intellectual in things sensible, and things superessential in things that are; and place forms and shapes around the formless and shapeless, and multiply and fashion the supernatural and formless simplicity in the variedness of the divided symbols; but, then, when we have become incorruptable and immortal, and have reached the Christlike and most blessed repose, according to the Divine saying, we shall be&quot;ever with the Lord,&quot;fulfilled, through all-pure contemplations, with the visible manifestation of God covering us with glory, in most brilliant splendours, as the disciples in the most Divine Transfiguration, and participating in His gift of spiritual light, with unimpassioned and immaterial mind; and, even in the union beyond conception, through the agnostic and most blessed efforts after rays of surpassing brilliancy, in a more Divine immitation of the supercelestial minds.

For we shall be equal to the angels, as the truth of the Oracles affirms, and sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. But now, to the best of our ability, we use symbols appropriate to things Divine, and from these again we elevate ourselves, according to our degree, to the simple and unified truth of the spiritual visions; and after our every conception of things godlike, laying aside our mental energies, we cast ourselves, to the best of our ability toward the superessential ray, in which all the terms of every kind of knowledge pre-existed in a manner beyond expression, which it is neither posssible fo conceive nor express, nor entirely in any way contemplate, on account of Its being pre-eminently above all things, and super-unknown, and Its having previously contained within Itself, superessntially, the whole perfections of all kinds of essentail knowledge and power, and Its being firmly fixed by Its absolute power, above all, even the superessental minds. For, if all kinds of knowledge are of things existing, and are limited to things existing, that, beyond all essence, is also elevated above all knowledge.

 SECTION V 

And yet, If It is superior to every expression and every knowledge, and is altogether placed above mind and essence,being such as embraced and unites and comprehends and anticipates all things, but Itself is altogether incomprehensible to all, and of It, there is neither perception nor imagination, nor surmise, nor name, nor expression, nor contact, nor science,in what way can our treatise thoroughly investigate the meaning of the Divibe Names, when the superessential Deity is shown to be without Name, and above Name?

But, as we said when we put forth the Theological Outlines, it is not possible to either express or to conceive what the One, the Unkown, the Superessential self-existing Good is,I mean the threefol Unity, the slike God, and the alike Good. But even the unions, such as befir angels, of the holy Powers, whether we must call them efforts after, or reception from, the super-Unknown and surpassing Goodness, are both unutterable and unknown, and exist in those angels alone who, above angelic knowledge, are deemed worthy of them.

The godlike minds (men) made one by these unions, through imitations of angels as far as attainable (since it is during cessation of every mental energy that such an union as this of the deified minds toward the super-divine light takes place) celebrate It most appropriately through the abstraction of all created thingsenlightened in this matter, truly and super-naturally from the most blessed union towards Itthat It is Cause indeed of all things existing, bit Itself none of them, as being superessentially elevated above all.

To none, indeed, who are lovers of the Truth above all Truth, is it permitted to celebrate the supremely-Divine Essentialitythat which is the super-subsistence of the super-goodness,neither as word or power, neither as life or mind or essence, but as pre-eminently seperated from every condition, movement, life, imagination, surmise, name, word, thought, conception, essence, position, stability, union, boundry, infinitude, all things whatever. But since, as sustained source of goodness, by the very fact of Its being, It is cause of all things that be, from all created things must we celebrate the benevolent Providence of the Godhead; for all things are both around It and for It, and it is before all things, and all things in It consist, and by Its being is the production and sustenance of the whole, and all things aspire to Itthe intellectual and rational, by means of knowledgethings inferior to these, through the senses, and other things by living movement, or substantial and habitual aptitude.





Dionysius

&quot;It is not permitted to speak or even to think beyond things divinely revealed to us in the sacred Oracles . . . . It is cause of all things that be, from all created things are both around It and for It, and It is before all things, and all things in It consist, and by Its being is the production and substance of the whole, and all things aspire to It, the intellectual and rational, by means of knowledgethings inferior to these, through the senses, and other things by living movement, or substatial and habitual aptitude&quot;- conforms to every word spoken or sung, and spoken in prayer in every Church Service, or alone, apprehended by the senses and comprehended by the heart wholly free from thought of any kind, which is achieved in some such moments of elevation during the Services.

 SECTION VI 

The Theologians having knowledge of this, celebrate It, both without Name and from every Name. Without name, as they say that the Godhead Itself, in one of those mystical apperitions of the symbolical Divine manifestation, rebuked him who said,&quot;What is thy name?&quot;and as leading him away from all knowledge of the Divine Name, said this,&quot;and why dost thou ask my Name?&quot;and this (Name)&quot;is wonderful,&quot;And is not this in reality the wonderful Name, that which is above every Namethe Namelessthat fixed above every name which is named, whether in this age or in that which is to come? Also, as&quot;many named,&quot;as when they again introduce It as saying,&quot;I am He, Who isthe Lifethe Lightthe Godthe Truth.&quot;

And when the wise of God themselves celbrate Him, as Author of all things, under many Names, from all created thingsas Goodas Beautifulas Wiseas Belovedas God of godsas Lord of lordsas Holy of Holiesas Eternalas Beingas Author of Agesas Provider of Lifeas Wisdomas Mindas Wordas Knowingas preeminently possessing all the treasures of all knowledgeas Poweras Powerfulas King of kingsas Ancient of daysas never growing oldand Unchangeableas Preservationas Righteousnessas Sanctificationas Redemptionas surpassing all things in greatnessand as in a great breeze.Yea, they also say that He is in minds, and in souls, and in bodies, and in heaven and in earth, and at once, the same in the sa,ein the worldaround the worldabove the worldsupercestial, superessential, sun, starfirewaterspiritdewcloudself-hewn stone and rockall things existingand not one of things existing.

 SECTION VII 

Thus then, the&quot;Nameless&quot;befits the cause of all, which is also above all, as to all the names of things existing, in order that there may be strictly a kingly rule over the whole, and that all things may be around It and dependent upon It, as cause, as beginning, as end. And Itself, according to the Divine saying, may be the&quot;all in all,&quot;and truly sung as of all, producing, directing and perfecting and sustaining guard, and shrine, and turning towards Itself, and that uniformly, irresistibly and pre-eminently. For It is not only cause of substance, or life, or perfection,so that from this or that forethought alone the Goodness above Name should be named, but It previously embraced in Itself all things existing, absolutely and without limit, by the complete benefactions of His one and all-creating forethought, and by all created things in joint accord It is celebrated and named.

The Image of God is like a blueprint in the depths of our being over which are laid layer upon layer of transparencies, each with their own determinism, informing and forming us according to the image built up from these layers of transparencies, making us, ultimately, into something other than what God originally INTENDED for us to be.

Great Lent is an opportunity to strip away these layers of transparencies and to get back to the original blueprint God INTENDS for us. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Feb 9, 2010, 8:57am

&quot;For we shall be equal to the angels, as the truth of the Oracles affirms, and sons of God, being sons of the resurrection&quot;, but now, knowing we have to shed the layers, we elevate ourselves through Divine Symbols and&quot;in godlike contemplation&quot;; Great Lent a time for introspection.

Mystical Theology

 SECTION VIII 

Further also, the Theologians do not honor alone the Names of God which are given from universal or particular Providences, or objects of forethought; but also from certain occasional Divine Visions, in the sacred templles or elsewhere, which enlightened the initiated or the Prophets, they name the surpassing bright Goodness which is above Name, after one or other causes of powers, and clothe It in forms and shapes of man, or fire, or electron, and celebrate Its eyes and ears, and locks of hair, and countenance, and hands, and back, and wings, and arms, and hinder parts and feet.

Also they assign to It crowns and seats, and drinking vessels and bowls; and certain other things mystical, concerning which, in our Symbolic Theology, we will speak as best as we can. But now, collecting from the Oracles so much as serves the purpose of our present treatise, and using the things aforesaid, as a kind of Canon, and keeping our eyes upon them, let us advance to the unfolding of the Names of God, which fall within the range of our understanding, and, the hirarchical rule always teaches us throughout every phase of theology, let us become initiated (to speak authoritively) in the godlike contemplation with a god-enlightened conception. And let us bring religious ears to the unfolding of the Holy Names of God, implanting the Holy in the Holy, according to the Divine tradition, and removing it from the laughter and jeers of the uninitiated; yea, rather, if certain men really are such, purifying them from their fighting against God in this matter. Be it thine, then, to guard these things, O excellent Timothy, according to the most holy leading, and to make the things Divine neither spoken nor known to the uninitiated. For myself, may Almighty God give me to celebrate, in a manner worthy of God, the numerous beneficient Names of the uncalled and unnamed Deity; and may He not take away a word of truth from my mouth.

On my Church Calendar today

Ephrem the Syrian

Prayer during Great Lent

 O Lord and Master of my life, take from me the spirit of sloth, despondency, lust for power and idle talk.
But grant unto me, Thy servant, a spirit of chastity/integrity, humility, patience and love.
Yes, O Lord and King, grant me to see my own faults and not judge my brother. For blessed art Thou unto the ages. Amen. 


&quot;Our Righteous Father Ephrem the Syrian was a prolific Syriac language hymn writer and theologian of the 4th century. He is venerated by Christians throughout the world, but especially among Syriac Christians as a saint.

&quot;Ephrem was born around the year 306 in the city of Nisibis (the modern Turkish town of Nusaybin, on the border with Syria, which had come into Roman hands only in 298).

Saint Ephrem grew up under the Leadeship of&quot;Jacob, the first bishop of Nisibis&quot;, who&quot;is recorded as a signatory at the First Council of Nicea in 325&quot;, attended also by Saint Spyridon, this meeting of hundreds of Bishops resulting in the formulating the Nicene Creed, recited during the Holy Liturgy.

&quot;Particularly influential were his Hymns Against Heresies. Ephrem used these to warn his flock of the heresies which threatened to divide the early church. He lamented that the faithful were&quot;tossed to and fro and carried around with every wind of the doctrine, by the cunning men, by their craftiness and deceitful wiles.&quot;He devised hymns ladden with doctrinal details to inoculate right-thinking Christians against heresies such as docetism. The Hymns Against Heresies emply colourful metaphors to describe the Incarnation of Christ as a fully human and divine. Ephrem asserts that Christ&apos;s unity of humanity and divinity represents peace, perfection and salvation; in contrast, docetism and other heresies sought to divide or reduce Christ&apos;s nature, and in doing so would rend and devalue Christ&apos;s followers with their false teachings.

&quot;Over four hundred hymns composed by Ephrem still exist. Granted that some have been lostto us, Ephrem&apos;s productivity is not in doubt. The church historian Sozomen credits Ephrem with having written over three million lines. Ephrem combines in his writings a threefold heritage: he draws on the model and methods of early Rabbinic Judaism, he engages wonderfully with Greek science and philosophy, and he delights in the Mesopotamian/Persian tradition of mystery symbolism.

&quot;The most important of his works are his lyric hymns. These hymns are full of rich imagery drawn from biblical sources, folk tradition, and other religions and philosophies. - Later writers have suggested that the madrase (hymns) were sung by all women choirs with an accompanying lyre.

&quot;Today, Saint Ephrem presents an engaging nodel of Asian Christianity, which might prove a valuable source ot theological insight for Christian communities that which to break out of the European cultural mode. Ephrem also shows that poetry is not only a vihicle for theology, but is in many ways superior to philosophical discourse for the purpose of doing theology.&quot;

Here I must insert a and Thank You, Saint Ephrem.

&quot;He also encourages a way of reading the Bible that is rooted more in faith than in critical analysis. Ephrem displays a deep sense of the interconnectedness of all created things , which could develope his role in the church into that of a &apos;saint of ecology&apos;. There are modern studies into Ephrem&apos;s view of women that see him as a champion of women in the church. Other studies have focused on the importance of &apos;healing&apos; imagery in Ephrem. Ephrem, then, confronts the contemporay church as an orthodox saint engaged in a theology that is at once non-western, poetic, ecological, feminist, and healing.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephrem_the_Syrian 

 http://www.quotes.orthodoxwiki.org/Ephrem_the_Syrian 

&quot;Ephrem is popularly believed to have taken legendary journeys. In one of these he visits Basil of Caesarea&quot;, the region close to Constantinople we are now familiar with.&quot;This links the Syrian Ephrem with the Cappadocian Fathers&quot;, Saints Basil, Gregory the Theologian, Gregory of Nyssia, and Athanasius the Great, who formulated the Mystery of the Holy Trinity. I don&apos;t know if I have all this correctly thus far, but it all belongs together anyway.

This link with the Cappadocian Fathers&quot;is an important theological bridge between the spiritual view of the two, who held much in common. Ephrem is also supposed to have visited Saint Pishoy in the monasteries of Scetes in Egypt. As with the legendary visit with Basil, this visit is a theological bridge between the origins of monasticism and its spread throughout the world.&quot;

Scetes in Egypt is in the Wadi El Natron, 135 km from Cairo, as described in post #653&quot;Marcarius of Egypt&quot;on the previous page, the desert region where St. Paul of Thebes, ca. 228-341) dwelled and whom St. Anthony the Great visited.

Saint Ephrem:

&quot;The boldness of our love is pleasing to you, O Lord, just as it pleases you that we should steal from your bounty.&quot;

Hymns

Troparion

By a flood of tears you made the desert fertile,
And your longing for God brought forth fruits in abundance.
By the radiance of miracles you illuminated the whole universe.
O our holy father Ephraim, pray to Christ our God to save our souls!

Kontakion

O holy father Ephraim,
As you meditated constantly on the final judgment,
You shed abundant tears of sorrow,
Making your struggle examples that we should follow and imitate,
And awakening the slothful to repentance:
You are indeed a father of high renown.

Having never heard of Saint Ephraim, I am glad to have become aquainted with this Church Father.

So I found

Pearls from Saint Isaac of Syria

What salt is for food, humility is for every virtue. To acquire it, a man must always think of himself with contrition, self-belittlement and painful self-judgement. But if we acquire it, it will make us sons of God.

Let us love silence till the world is made to die in our hearts. Let us always remember death, and in this thought draw near to God in our hearts -- and the pleasures of this world will have our scorn.

Walk before God in simplicity, and not in subleties of the mind. Simplicity brings faith, but subtle and intricate speculations bring conceit, and conceit brings withdrawal from God.

As a man whose head is under water cannot inhale pure air, so a man whose thoughts are plunged into the cares of this world cannot absorb the sensations of that new world.

It is a spiritual gist from God for a man to perceive his own sins.

Ease and idleness are the distractions of the soul and they can injure her more than the demons.

The purpose of the advent of the Saviour, when He gave up His life-giving commandments as purifying remedies in our passionate state, was to cleanse the soul from the damage done by the first trangression and bring it back to the original state. What medecines are for the sick body, that the commandments are for the passionate soul.

To bear grudge and pray, means to sow seed on the sea and expect a harvest.

The key to Divine gifts is given to the heart by love of neighbor, and, in proportion to the heart&apos;s freedom from the bonds of the flesh, the door of knowledge begins to open before it.

Dispassion does not mean that man feels no passion, but that he does not accept any of them.

This life has been given to you for repentance, do not waste it in vain persuits.

To whatever extent a person draws close to God with his intentions, is to what extent Gord draws close to him with His gifts.

A small but persitent discipline is a great force; for a soft drop tailing persistently, hollows out hard rock.


This last Pearl is actually an Axiom oft said in Germany as an encouragement and not to give up,&quot;Steter Tropfen hlt den Stein&quot;. A steady drop hollows the stone.

Love for one&apos;s Neighbor, mercy, and non-judgmentalness is emphasized a thousand times by Saint and Priest.
Every day I miss having missed Church last Sunday, but having attended often enough so that words spoken and sung surface during work, as well as prayer. Now these Gems are hidden in this thread, and St. Seraphim of Savo:

&quot;The prayer is not thorough if a man is self-conscious and aware that he is praying. By repetition things are interiorized and then one prays in sleep.&quot;

Why I Am Against Death

As far as I am concerned, death is entirely unnatural and only exists as a temporary consequence of the fall of man. If not for the fall, there would be no death, not only for ourselves, but for all of creation, which:

was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, (ROM 8:20)

Death entered into the world through the envy of the Devil and the misuse of our freedom of will and now, every death and every act of violence is an affirmation of the Devils victory over us and a denial of Christs victory over death.

The verse in St. Pauls epistle to the Romans quoted above continues:

Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. (ROM 8:21-23)

Death is a temporary consequence of the fall. Through Christs saving dispensation our soul may be resurrected even now; our bodies rendered incorrupt and at the Lords second coming, our soul will be reunited with our resurrected and glorified body:

Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. (1COR 15:51-52)

Woe to everything in the media, books, movies, tv shows, video games that promote and glorify revenge, violence and death as, not only justifiable and reasonable, but as the inevitable outcomes of life!

I, personally, prefer the foolishness of believing in the God of love and life, rather than the wisdom of this world whose only virtue is Survival and that, only for the Fittest.

And thus, I am against death!

&quot;Saint Alexander Nevsky, (1220-1263) was the Grand Prince of Novgorod and Vladimir during the most trying times in the city&apos;s history. Commonly regarded as the key figure of medieval Rus, Alexander was the grandson of Vsevolod the Big Nest and rose to legendary status on account of his military victories over the German and Swedish invaders while employing collaborationist policies toward the powerful Golden Horde.&quot;

Great victories

&quot;From Tales of the Life and courage of the pious and Great Prince Alexander found in the Second Pskovian Chronicle, circa 1260-1280, comes on of the first known references to the Great Prince:

&quot;By the will of God, prince Alexander was born from the charitable, people-loving, and meek the Great Prince Yaroslav, and his mother was Theodosia. As it was told by the prophet Isaiah,&quot;Thus sayeth the Lord: I appoint the princes because they are sacred and I direct them.&quot;...He was taller than others and his voice reached the people like a trumpet, and his face was like the face of Joseph, whom the Egyptian Pharaoh placed as next to the king after him of Egypt.His power was a part of the power of Samson and God gave him the wisdom of Solomon ... the Price Alexander: he used to defeat but was never defeated ...&quot;

Can I say, that while writing, I heard you say these exact words.

Cyrus and John

Wonderworkers, Unmercenary Physicians
Thaumaturgists who&quot;healed the sick free of charge&quot;.

The reading on St. Cyrus, in monastic habit, and St. John, in court robes of a Roman Officer, is extensive and demonstrates indeed the continuity of the way of the Church from the Feast of the Nativity, and onward.

&quot;The principale source of information regarding the life, passion and miracles of Sts. John and Cyrus in the encomium written by Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem (d. 638). O the birth, parents, and first years of the saints we know nothing. According to the Arabic&quot;Synaxarium&quot;, compiled by Michael, Bishop of Athrib, Cyrus and John were both Alexandrians; this, however, is contradicted by other documents in which it is said that Cyrus was a native of Alexandria and John of Edessa.&quot;

The Orthodox Church affirms the latter.

Cyrus

&quot;Cyrus practiced the art of medecine, and had a work-shop (ergasterium) which was afterwards transformed into a temple (church) dedicated to the Three Young Men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ministered to the sick gratis and at the same time laboured with all the ardour of an apostle of Faith, and won many from pagan superstition. This took place under the Emperor Diocletian. Denouced to the prefect of the city he fled to Arabia where he took refuge in a town near the sea called Tzoten. There, having received the tonsure and assumed the monastic habit, he abandoned medecine and began a life of asceticism.&quot;

Labouring with all the ardour of an Apostle of Faith cannot be other than gratis.

John

&quot;John belonged to the army, in which he held a high rank; the&quot;Synaxarium&quot;cited above adds that he was one of the familiars of the emperor. Hearing of the virtues and wonders of Cyrus, he betook himself to Jerusalem in fulfillment of a vow, and thenced passed into Egypt where he became the companion of St. Cyrus in the ascetic life.&quot;

This too is confirmed by the Orthodox Church.

The Three Young Men to whom St. Cyrus dedicated His Temple are related to the traditional feasting during the preparation of the Nativity of Christ.

 &quot;The Three Young Men in the Fiery Furnace, celebrated during the Nativity Fast as a reminder of the grace acquired through fasting (15th century icon of the Novgorod school)

The story from the Book of Daniel can be read here, icon and paintings.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiery_furnace 

The Three Young Men defied King Nebuchadnezzar by not bowing to Him and worshipping idols, consequently the King had them trown into a furnace, but emerging miraculously and unharmed by the flames so astonished the King that he commanded anyone speaking against the God of the Youth&quot;will be torn apart and have his house turned into a pile of stone.&quot;God demonstrated His power, and the story&quot;is followed by an account of an angel coming and making the inside of the furnace feel like a cool breeze over dew, and an extended hymn of praise to their God for delivering them, the&quot;Song of the Tree Young Men&quot;.

Sunday last was the last Sunday before Great Lent, which began yesterday. It is my first time to better become acquainted with Lent, which when growing up under the Catholic Church we didn&apos;t pay much attention to.

&quot;The Feast of the meeting of our Lord in the Temple&quot;

&quot;Sunday of the Expulsion of Adam from Paradise&quot;

&quot;Sunday of Forgiveness&quot;or&quot;Cheesefare Sunday&quot;.

&quot;For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive yours. But if you do not forgive men their trepasses, neither will your Father forgive your trepasses. Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.&quot;

With this in mind, Fr. Ceko combined fasting and forgiveness, to not judge others of what and how much they eat, that most Christians who are not monks will not fast strictly but fast according to their ability, and that one should not think, &apos;oh my God it&apos;s the austere and dreay time of Lent again&apos;, but see Lent as a time of Joy of bettering oneself, and also a time of reflection.

Cheesefare Sunday is the beginning of obstaining from eggs, milk and cheese, the minimum is obstaining from meat.

&quot;On this Sunday before the Great Lent, the last day that traditionally Orthodox Christians eat dairy products until Easter, the Church remembers the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise. God commanded them to fast from the fruit of the tree (Gen. 2:16), but they did not obay. In this way Adam and Eve and their descendants became heirs of death and corruption.&quot;

St. Simon the Tanner and the Miracle of moving the Mountain

&quot;Saint Simon the Shoemaker (10th century A.D.), also known as Simon the Tanner, is a Coptic Orthodox saint associated with the great miracle of moving the Mokattam Mountain in Cairo, Egypt, during the ruling of the Muslim Fatimid Caliph Al-Muizz.&quot;

The Caliph and a Jew named Jacob Ibn Yusef Ibn Killis challenged the Coptic Pope Abraham on account of the words &apos;if you have faith as small as a mustard you can move mountains&apos;. St. Simon the Tanner and the people prayed&quot;Kyrie eleison (Lord have mercy), the mountain was thrusting up and down, and the sun was seen from under it. After the miracle was performed in the presence of the Caliph, the Pope turned left and right looking for St. Simon the Tanner, but he had disappeared and no one could find him (a sign of the saint&apos;s deep humility).&quot;

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Simon_the_Shoemaker 

My personal experience of how mountains indeed are move was subjective. I visited Mokattam in Cairo at the time a Polish? artist was painting sacred images on the rocks. A Monk showd me a creeping plant sacred to the Holy Virgin Mary which never looses it&apos;s scent. I picked one and have it to this day.

I was told Mokattam literally means&quot;to cut apart&quot;as we also use the word. When I came to this country I noted the strange English word&quot;scissors&quot;or&quot;a pair of scissors&quot;, (in German&quot;Schere&quot;- to shear), which then reminded me of the&quot;Primordial Scission&quot;or how the Golden Section is created which Anthony West describes, and for short,&quot;.... we may say that One, in becoming Two, divides into unequal parts, and that inequality is both caused by phi and is phi.&quot;It cannot be grasp by the rational mind, writes Mr. West, but I contemplated this concept and the nickel in droping, droped.

The most impressive feature to say the least, is the enormous cave in the Mokattam, simply overwhelming the Mind. I ever regret not having asked the Monk who hewd out the cave and what happened to the stones. I didn&apos;t see any, and have not searched for an explanation. Sitting once with Aziz, a Muslim, by the Pyramids, I asked Him where he thinks the stones for the Pyramids came from and He pointed to Mokattam and said&quot;from there.&quot;Having seen the cave, I thought that not nearly enough stones were hewn out to build the Mids, but didn&apos;t asked further because the Pyramids are a sensitive subject for Muslims. I always had the impression that Muslims know the Pyramids have to do with Christianity and the Copts, therefore Christianity, are the heirs of the Monuments and Knowledge of the Ancient Egyptians. As my Phi-Teacher once remarked, ancient Knowledge and Helenic Teachings went right into the Koran.

By reading the lives of the saints and the writings of the Holy Fathers we discover our hidden potential as human beings.

By emulating their way of life we may realize that full potential.


 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEGxVJ9FLkM 

The Sacramental way of life prescribed by the Orthodox Church is a well-defined course of therapy which leads to the healing of both soul and body.

&quot;In most of the sacraments the Church takes material things water, bread, wine, oil and makes them a vehicle of the Spirit. In this way the sacraments look back to the Incarnation, when Christ took material flesh and made it a vehicle of the Spirit; and they look forward to, or rather they anticipate, the apocatastasis and the final redemption of matter at the Last Day.

The Orthodox Church speaks customarily of seven sacraments:

(i) Baptism
(ii) Chrismation
(iii) The Eucharist
(iv) Repentance or Confession
(v) Holy Orders
(vi) Marriage or Holy Matrimony
(vii) The Anointing of the Sick

Only in the seventeenth century, when Latin influence was at its height, did this list become fixed and definite. Before that date Orthodox writers vary considerably as to the number of sacraments: John of Damascus speaks of two; Dionysius the Areopagite of six; Joasaph, Metropolitan of Ephesus (fifteenth century), of ten; and those Byzantine theologians who in fact speak of seven sacraments differ as to the items which they include in their list. Even today the number seven has no absolute dogmatic significance for Orthodox theology, but is used primarily as a convenience in teaching.

Those who think in terms of seven sacraments must be careful to guard against two misconceptions. In the first place, while all seven are true sacraments, they are not all of equal importance, but there is a certain hierarchy among them. The Eucharist, for example, stands at the heart of all Christian life and experience in a way that the Anointing of the Sick does not. Among the seven, Baptism, Chrismation and the Eucharist occupy a special position: these three sacraments are pre-eminent among the divine mysteries.

Baptism and Chrismation in particular, are the doorways into all of the other Sacraments.

In the second place, when we talk of seven sacraments, we must never isolate these seven from the many other actions in the Church which also possess a sacramental character, and which are conveniently termed sacramentals. Included among these sacramentals are the rites for a monastic profession, the great blessing of waters at Epiphany, the service for the burial of the dead, and the anointing of a monarch. In all these there is a combination of outward visible sign and inward spiritual grace. The Orthodox Church also employs a great number of minor blessings, and these, too, are of a sacramental nature: blessings of corn, wine, and oil; of fruits, fields, and homes; of any object or element. These lesser blessings and services are often very practical and prosaic: Between the wider and the narrower sense of the term sacrament there is no rigid division: the whole Christian life must be seen as a unity, as a single mystery or one great sacrament, whose different aspects are expressed in a great variety of acts, some performed but once in a mans life, others perhaps daily.

The sacraments are personal: they are the means whereby Gods grace is appropriated to every Christian individually. For this reason, in most of the sacraments of the Orthodox Church, the priest mentions the Christian name of each person as he administers the sacrament. When giving Holy Communion, for example, he says: The servant of God ... [name] partakes of the holy, precious Body and Blood of Our Lord; at the Anointing of the Sick he says: O Father, heal Thy servant [name] from his sickness both of body and soul.&quot; Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Feb 19, 2010, 10:38am

The writings of the Saints and Church Fathers leave no doubt as to our potential, not by &apos;believing&apos; their words but by the innate faculty of understanding that only elightened Persons can impart the like Light/Wisdom.

I spend at least one hour each morning reading on their Lives and Teachings, but it is one thing to read how they lived their Lives and another to emulate them to the fullest. Nevertheless, they influence one&apos;s daily life by remembering those profound passages which resonate strongly in one&apos;s Soul, the Teachings adapting themselves to each Individuals degree of development and capacity. The Saints as Intersessors are also said to be ceaselessly praying for for us.

Nice for me was that I found, anew, Saint Arsatius,&quot;of whose live virtually nothing is known&quot;, save that He visited Constantinople with His Brother, and that Saint Ambrosius coverted Him to Christianity, but I found mystical passages not clearly written.

Saint Arsatius&quot;is said to have been bishop of Milan, who lived either around 400 or in the 6th cenuty, and possibly a martyr, but there is no evidence. Because of the traditional connection, he is further supposed to have been a disciple of Saint Ambrose, who was also Bishop of Milan, but there is no evidence for this either.

&quot;His relics were brought in 766 from Rome to Illmnster Monastery where a cultus grew up around them and where the well-known Arsatius-Basilika is still dedicated to him. They were moved to Munich in 1495, but returned to Illmnster in 1846.&quot;

The Illmnster Abbey was founded in 762, the Church being so old that it had to braced as shown in the photo, and the&quot;big Bell&quot;can no longer be rung for fear of the tower collapsing.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilmm%C3%BCnster_Monastery 

Thank you also for defining the Sacraments touched upon in the beginning of this thread, especially concerning Baptism and Chrismation. Thus far I have been present at five Baptisms, three Infants, one Teenager and an adult Lady. All are situated at the entrance to the Church and asked if they will join their Live to Christ, so promised, they are taken to the Baptismal Fount under John the Baptist, and after circling before the Altar three times, Fr. Ceko annoints the newly Baptized in seven steps from head to the feet, repeating the same dedicational verse. At times the name of the newly Baptized is incorporated in the Prayers and the Congregation wishes the Individual a long and good life in song.

As I observe I think of how I will feel at my time and have been waiting for an opportunity to speak with Papadia Sandra, perhaps this&quot;Sunday of Orthodoxy&quot;, after the Hierarchiacal Divine Liturgy and Procession of Icons, as I will stay all day.

The Blessings of Homes is performed each week in different towns about Alhambra by Fr. Ceko. Some Blessings are indeed asked for daily, of our food especially and to this day my children say &apos;ita daki mas gochi so sama&apos; before each meal, to which I have added more.

As much as I can, now, I give my thoughts to Lent in reading from the links, and as an aside the great story of Schnabel which history is joined to Religion.

A good day to You and All

Blessings of Koliva

&quot;Koliva is boiled wheat which is used liturgically in the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches. It is widely popular in Lebanon where it is known in as Snuniye, more commonly , as&quot;berbara&quot;prepared for Saint Barbara&apos;s day, December 4th, which is celebrated with Halloween-like festivities.&quot;


Koliva is served&quot;on the first Friday of Great Lent&quot;, after a&quot;memorial Divinr Liturgy&quot;, and&quot;due to its pleasant taste, in some countries (though not in Greece or Cyprus), it is consumed on other non-religious occasions as well, often with cream on top (though not with cream on fast days).

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koliva 

As shown in the picture, I am pretty sure it was a koliva mixture I saw among other cakes, which I called a&quot;rice dish&quot;, several weeks ago in Church, as it is also prepaired for the Patron Saint of a Family according to the Lady I asked about the Offering, which the article affirms, and also that rice is used when wheat is not available. The recipe and ingrediants, of which I have four and will purchase the remaining, are given and I will make it today as it sounds delicious.

&quot;Some Orthodox parishes have a designated individual charged with making the koliva. This is in part due to the health risk of fermented wheat if the koliva is not prepared correctly.&quot;

But wheat kernels can be used so I&apos;ll taste the measure of a teaspoon and wait an hour to see if I&apos;m still alive.

&quot;The origin of koliva predates Christianity. The word stems from the Ancient Greek word kollyvo, which originally meant cereal grain. In the Ancient Greek panspermia, a mixture of cooked seeds and nuts were offered during the festival of the Anthesteria. For this reason, in Greece koliva is also called sperma ( i.e.,&quot;seed&quot;).

&quot;The association between death and life, between that which is planted in the ground and that which emerges, is deeply embedded in the making and eating of koliva. The ritual food passed from paganism to early Christianity in Byzantium and later spread to the entire Orthodox world.&quot;

&quot;Orthodox Christians consider koliva to be symbolic of death and resurrection, according to the word of the Gospel:

 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat falls into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. (John 12:24)

&quot;Wheat which is planted in the earth and rises in new life is symbolic of those beloved departed who have died in the hope of resurrection, in accordance with the words of Saint Paul:

 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.... (I Corinthians 15:42-44)

&quot;This symbolism has its highest expression in the Saints, whose blessed state in heaven have been manifested to the world. For this reason, koliva is blessed not only at memorials for the departed, but also in commemoration of saints.&quot;

It is also blessed for the Living symbolic as sown of a natural body and raised a Spiritual Body.

Commemorating such a Saint today

Saint Theodore of Amasea

A Greek militaty Saint of the 4th century and Patron Saint of Venice, whose Life and Martyrdom was documented by Gregory of Nyssa.&quot;In Eastern Christianity he is more often known as Theodore the Recruit. - Orthodox and Armenians honor him on the first Saturday of Great Lent....&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_of_Amasea 

&quot;There are churches bearing his name at Constantinople, Jerusalem, Damascus, and other places of the former Christian east. An ancient church of San Theodoro in Venice is said to have been founded by Narses. The church was later demolished when the basilica of Saint Mark was expanded.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_San_Marco 

The two Patron Saints of Venice, Theodore and Mark are remembered by columns at the Lagune&apos;s edge. My Sister and I were in Venice at the Film Premier of&quot;Shark Tale&quot;, shown on the bottom photograph, then we went to feet the pigeons shown in the next picture. Neither one of us knew of a Saint Theodore.

At the foot of the Palatine in Rome is a very old church, circular in shape and dedicated to San Theodoro&quot;, to which people brought their sick children for healing.

While driving home from work yesterday, I was thinking of the current healing methods of the Medical Profession itself, excluding the Pharmaceutical Industry who scares natural health out of people, as opposed to the Healing Powers of the Saints, the difference being death in many cases of the former, never with the Saints.

A great weekend to all.

Since then all promise of spiritual advancement
lieth in two things, good disposition and (as &apos;twas said)
right education, it followeth here to speak of these.
First then of Disposition.Unless ther truly be
more good than bad absolutely in the make of man,
ther is no security for him and little hope,
except the inherent harmony and unity of good
be such as must in the end outweigh the surplusage
of all discordant enmity; and this well may be:
but should we inquire if Nature hath by any means
inclined man&apos;s disposition to the virtuous choice,
we may find how she hath done this, and by the energy
of the imitative faculty hath assured her end.
&quot;For mimicry is inborn in man from childhood up:
&quot;and in this differeth he from other animals,
&quot;being the most imitative: and his first approach
&quot;to leaning maketh he in mimicry, and hath delight
&quot;in imitations of all kinds.&quot;I would indeed
that Aristotle had set this pregnant verity
in forefront of his Ethick also, as now &apos;tis found
to stablish his Poetick; for the assumption of it
here and there in the Morals escapeth notice
and all the consequences thereof are unseen.
But if the cradled child imitateth the shows
that happen around him, he for-sure will most attend
to those that most attract, and must therefore be drawn
and held by the inborn love of Beauty inconsciently
of preference to imitate the most beautiful things.

And because Virtue is an activity, and lieth not
in doctrin and theory but in practice and conduct,
co-ordinating potencies into energy,
(and here &apos;tis Aristotle again speaketh, not I)
the preferential imitation of right action
is THE HABIT OF VIRTUE: and thus a child well-bred
in good invironment, so soon as he is aware
of personality, wil know and think himself
a virtuous being and instinctivly, in the pound
realization of Self common to all animals,
becometh to be his own ideal, a such-a-one
as would WILL and DO this (saith he) and never do thatt,
refraining there from shame, consenting here for love,
winning new beauty of soul from the embrace of beauty,
and strenght by practised combat against folly and wrong,
to perfect as he may his idea of himself.

Spiritual life being thus imagin&apos;d in the child
thru&apos; conscient personality and love of beauty,
which on so tender a plant budding hath power to bear
the richest fruit of all creation, incomparable
ther is nought in all his nurtur of more intrinsic need
than is the food of Beauty: as mammal&apos;s milk to his flesh,
which admitteth no proxy, so Beauty is to his soul,
that calleth for this comforting of nature&apos;s breast,
tho&apos; its outcries be unheard when it pineth in pain:
and since the hunger of mimicry is so strong in him,
that in the lack of milk &apos;twil ravin gall, and draw
infection and death from evil as quickly as life from good,
the first intrinsic need in education is found.

Thus Christ, who knew what was in man and thaught
man&apos;s perfect happiness to be the wonted realm
of heav&apos;n within his heart, spake thus Take hede (he said)
 Se that ye offende not won of these littll wons: 
and once again on this wise,&quot;If ther be any sin
unpardonable even in the wide compassion of God,
&quot;&apos;tis the denial and blasphemy of his Holy Spirit,
and the quenching in others of its nascent flame.&quot;

SUNDAY OF ORTHODOXY

TRIUMPH OF ORTHODOXY

&quot;A historical gathering took place at Saint Steven&apos;s Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in Alhambra this Sunday, February 21, 2010. For the third consecutive year, the Canonical Orthodox Christian Bishops on the West Coast of America con-celebrated the Divine Liturgy on the first Sunday of Great Lent.&quot;

The Event was hosted by His Grace, Bishop Maxim, and the Divine Liturgy was of Saint Basil the Great, which was held under a large tent, and together with the Procession of Holy Icons lasted four hours. It was festive and solemn and moving. Saint Herman of Alaska, Patron Saint of America, was remembered as the Missionary who introduced Orthodoxy to America; Prayers were offered for Patriarch Irinej of the Serbian Church; His All Holiness Bartholomew of Constantinople; and as always, our President, Persons in Public Office, our Troops, Travelers, the sick and poor, and the whole world....

The Bishops were His Eminence, Metropolitan Gerasimos, His Grace, Bishop Joseph, His Grace, Bishop Maxim, and His Grace, Bishop Benjamin. Father Ceko served the Matins, and I think it was Bishop Benjamin who served the Holy Liturgy, invested with Authority and speaking with a Surety that left no after-thought, and when His Grace turned to Bless the Congregation, and during Censing, it was as though He stood in the Realm of Grace imbuing the tent with a Holy Atmosphere. Methought I could see it even, it was wonderful and indeed &apos;otherworldly&apos;. I have experienced this before during the Divine Liturgy but never as powerful.

There was ceaseless, interlocking Prayer and Singing, and the same Bishop, for Whom I felt Divine Love not of my doing, bid us to affirm our Faith, repeating these words His Grace spoke with the same Consummate Voice

 THE SYNODIKON 

 As the prophets beheld, As the Apostles have taught,
As the Church has received, As the Teachers have dogmatized,
As the Universe has agreed, As Grace has illumined,
As Truth has revealed, As falsehood has been dissolved,
As Wisdom has presented, As Christ has triumphed.

This we believe, This we declare, this we preach:

Christ our True God, and His Saints we honor
In words, in writings, in thoughts, in sacrifices, in Temples, in Icons,

On the one hand bowing down and worshipping Christ as God and Master;

On the other hand, honoring the Saints as true servants of the Master of all, and offering them due veneration.

This is the Faith of the Apostles! This is the Faith of the Fathers!
This is the Faith of the Orthodox!
This is the Faith which has established the universe! 

How it is that Christ is Pantocrator becomes clearer by degree.

After standing four hours in wet grass with short intervals of sitting, when the Lady who has taken me under Her wings told me to put my feet up &apos;here&apos;, we went to have lunch at a table she had reserved via a Friend, but there was no chair for me. After a few words of who sits where it was agreed that I should sit &apos;here&apos; beside a German Lady. She told me she was a Catholic but converted when she married a Serb and wanted her children to have one Religion. I spoke German to Her and, taking a deep breath, she looked at me and answered in English. Another Lady with a great Spirit welcomed me twice.

While eating I was telling of the Koliva dish I made, suggested for Lent, that it was very delicious, but nobody seemed to know about it. The German Lady said that She buys a pizza crust and fills it with stuff she has, then asked me about my children and where they live, what I do and where I live, and so we are practically neighbors and can visit for lunch or something. Beginning to feel uneasy I said I worked and had very little free time. I had finished my meal, excused myself and left feeling guilty, as the Church stresses communal life.

I also remember that socializing with the Congregation is a way to&quot;seperate the wheat from the chaff&quot;, but couldn&apos;t my daily threshing field just be people I work with and for and my neighbors. It has been for many years. There are two reasons I leave after the Divine Liturgy, 1. Freeway-traffic, 2. described above, which talk I have shunned for the last 15 years or so. For my Family Religion is anathema. I have a really hard time interacting with people, and I don&apos;t know how I would fare discussing Religion. I listen to the Priests and knowledgeable persons, and like learning from the Saints. There is much more on and in my Mind than I would ever want to say, even superficially speaking.

When you think about interacting with the congregation, think about rocks in a tumbler or gold in a crucible...


What will happen to us at the end of the world?
St Paul says we will be changed:

&quot;Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
... See More
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.&quot;

Changed how? St. John says:

&quot;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.&quot;

Must we wait until the end of the world or can we begin to change even now? Again, according to the Apostle Paul:

&quot;But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.&quot; Re: The Secret of the Universe

Come Sunday, I&apos;ll stay again for lunch to hear and maybe participate in further conversations. I have no problem at all being one with the Congregation during the Service, it is from personal contact I shy away. It is my hope to see Father Norman to whom I could speak with ease.

Remembering that His Grace, Bishop Maxim, is fond of Icons, He gave the following Homily on Sunday.

 The Icon and the Kingdom of God 

We live in times awash with man-made images, in a postmodern epoch where each person struggles to produce the most convincing image of himself and his idea, where people try to attract the most people they can through their self image in order to impress and to impose their&quot;icon&quot;or, better yet, their&quot;idol,&quot;on others(as St Andrew says:&quot;I have become an idol to myself&quot;; Canon of St. Andrew of Crete, Ode IV). It is an era that offers falsehood, delusion, and fantasy without transcending the antinomies and limitations of history.

 Your Eminence, Your Graces, beloved brothers in the Holy Spirit and co-celbrant of our Modesty, and dear pious assembly of the fullness of the Church, the living icons of God. 

We live in such times; yet, this moment in time - The Sunday of Orthodoxy, the feast of the icon - proposes an alternative image: one Divinely-revealed rather than human-made, one that is convicting rather than convincing, one that is iconic rather than idolatrous - the Icon of God.

This Icon represents humanity having received the opportunity to circumscribe and depict the Transcendent God, which only became possible once God became man, expressing his Divinity in human form, bringing the Kingdom of God into the Divine Liturgy, and demostrating the reality of the Resurrection by asking one of His disciples to verify what he saw by touching Christ&apos;s hands, feet, and side Jn 20:26). Similarly, the language of the Fathers about Icons, especially that of the Seventh Ecumenical Council, has to do with both seeing and beholding the vision of God. But this language introducessignificant questions: What is the real image of God? What is the real image of man? What is the real image of this world? Does the Icon depict a Platonic ideal? Or does it represent Greco-Roman art? Or does the iconic image capture the corrupted world of Pieter Brueghel or Salvador Dali? Maybe, we Christians present an image that itself can obscure the image of the Kingdom? Do we not, instead of iconizing the trasfigured world of Paradise, most often represent the mere fallen world? This problem faces us in our present-day Church and it is necessary to ask ourselves: does our image of the world and the Church overshadow the true image of the Kingdom?

What is the difference between the Icon and the image, between the Divine Image and the image of this world? The two are altogether different.

The first, and significant, difference is that the Icon is not naturalistic; it does not represent something ephemeral, but rather it represents both a Person and a personal relationship. One of the most significant points to emerge from the Seventh Ecumenical Council is that one Divine Person - the Son of God - became man, demonstrating that we cannot speak about God or imagine God without the Person who revealed God to us. An image that does not refer to the Person of Christ is an image that refers to the corrupted world and thus leads to death. The Icon is not of this world; it is eschatological both in origin and in content. Not being drawn from history, we call the Icon meta-historical.

Homily on Icons

His Grace, Bishop Maxim

Nevertheless, the Kingdom can only be depicted by using created means. The Icon is distinct from the truth, not because it is false, delusional, or fantastic, but because it borrows its means of expression from still-corruptable nature.

Allthough its means of expression derive from fallen nature, the Icon refers to inexpressible Truth by encouraging our personal relationship with Truth; a proper Icon creates true personal relationships. That is why an Icon is indivisibly linked with Love: we cannot speak about Truth without Love, and we cannot speak about an Icon that does not lead us to Love.

For Orthodox Christians, this means that the Icon leads us to the Church. There we will meet the other in his or her true state. As Fr. Justin Popovich used to say,&quot;in the Church we are taught to see (iconically) in every man our future brother/sister as he or she is in Paradise.&quot;There, in the Eucharistic synaxis, we will see and meet God through our communion with others. So the Icon gathers (synaxis) the community we call the Church. The Icon, then, is not only an object we kiss and venerate, but an eternal synaxis that exists in moments, movements, and actions during the Divine Liturgy. Outside the Church, there is not the Kingdom of God, inside the Church, all is iconic.

Here we understand the next characteristic of the Icon: it refers to another, not to itself, leading us, thereby, out of solipsism. It encourages us to go out and meet the other. The Icon is person-oriented! When we venerate an Icon of Christ or a Saint, we demonstrate our victory over individualism and show that we are not self-reliant. When the Icon traces this relationship between persons (God and man) and gathers the Church, then the Church becomes a real depiction of the Kingdom of God, leading us to the Divine Eucharist, which St. Maximus the Confessor described as the image or Icon of the Kingdom. In the primitive phase of the ancient Church, the Icon was closely linked with the mystery of the Eucharist. The Eucharist is the celebration that makes the earthly Church what it is, namely, an Icon of the Kingdom.

But there is yet one more difference between the Icon and the image. The image&lt;fixed&gt;reality, as opposed to the Icon which does not fix it but liberates it from natural laws. We celebrate today the Fathers of the Seventh Ecumenical synod who gathered to testify that the Church could not exist without Icons, without iconizing the Person of God! When an image becomes an Icon, it no longer refers to itself anymore - to its ephemeral existence; rather, it refers beyond itself: to something beyond this corrupted world. When an Icon becomes an Icon, it redeems a person landscape depicted in it and situates that person or landscape in relationship to the Kingdom. In the historical live of the Church, everything is an image of the future. The Icons which depict the Saints are not photographs of their historical faces, but the images of the future they portray.

His Grace Bishop Maxim is coming to visit our community this weekend. We are all looking forward to his visit.

Our Priest, Fr. Michael is taking a position in San Francisco and His Grace will be helping us to find a new pastor. Your Fr. Norman was one of the possibilities being considered...We will see.

All the best to All in All. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Feb 25, 2010, 9:33am

Whether rocks in a tumbler or gold in a crucible, or as given in the Homily by His Grace Bishop Maxim, the importance of interaction with the Community becomes very clear. Being aquainted with you and your work in the Church which you sort of helped build 30 years ago, I think you said, I am confident that His Grace will be of great help in finding a new Pastor.

I find the Homily most informative and enlightening, elaborating on the Icon as a Window into Heaven.

The reality of the Icon&apos;s relationship with the Kingdom of Heaven is why the Fathers of this Synod repeated what St. Basil said in the fourth century: &quot;the honor paid to the Icon passes on to the prototype&quot;! Therefore when we venerate an Icon, goes beyond the Icon and reaches the Original source of the image, which is a Pwerson. That is why in the Church, the Word is an Icon and an Icon is the Word! And this is something that our Church experiences throughout the ages! In our Churches, the Kingdom of God is depicted and represented through Icons, through chanting, through harmonious architecture, through all manner of aesthetic endeavours that are part of our Liturgical expression. How did the Orthodox survive under the Ottoman rule without catechism or schools? Only through this Iconic approach to embodying Truth. The pious people spoke with God through Icons (iconographic depictions) and Hymns and not through human words or rational formulations; God, in turn, revealed Himself to His people through Icons and Hymns.

This, in the final analysis, means, dear brothers and sisters, that the Divine worship in its liturgical-iconical context has saved the Orthodox Church and not the verbal descriptions and rhetoric of the homilists...such as this present one.

There will be those who assert that an iconic image conveys the Platonic idea of a shadow empty of reality. But such a position makes it difficult to speak of the Church as an Icon without falling into the realm of the imaginative or unreal. The Iconic nature of the Orthodox Church does not imply a lack of reality, although it does imply a lack of objectified and autonomous reality. As Metropolitan John of Pergamon states,&quot;by being iconic in her existence the Church is two things: (a) she is an image of something else that transcends herhence, again, a relational entity; and (b) she is in her institution and structure so transparent as to allow the eschoatological realities to be reflected in them all the time. This can hardly be achieved outside the context of worship, for it is there that transcendence and transparency are experienced par excellence.&quot;

I hear Fr. Ceko joyfully exclaiming,&quot;Come One come All!

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Feb 26, 2010, 11:39am

His Grace, Bishop Maxim, continued:

My beloved, in this society permiated with the illusions of multimedia, where image-pollution of all sorts has blurred our vision, we are invited to promote the true Icon of the Kingdom, we are invited to liberate our everyday life from slavery to the natural world through this iconical ethos that our tradition bequeaths to us; an iconological ethos that leads to an affirmation of the other, which leads very often to&quot;silence&quot;and to deference before the other, who we prefer over ourselves (Honor one another above yourselves&quot;- Rom. 12:10).

Unfortunately, my beloved, Orthodoxy in our times tends to become an ideology, wherein slogans and accusations of betraying the faith and tradition - understood ideologically - are hurled at one another. But, significantly enough, our Orthodox Church has chosen the commemoration of the Seventh Ecumenical Council to be the Sunday of Orthodoxy. As is well known, this Council dealt with the issue of Icons and did not put forth any propositional definition of the faith. In declaring, This is the faith of the Fathers; this is the faith which has sustained the oecumene,&quot; the Council pointed to a form of&quot;theology&quot;, the Icon, which was the liturgical experience of the community and required no subscription to conceptual or ideological statements.

This declaration of the Seventh Council ended in the Christological debate of words testifying to the reality of the Mystery in the Icon of the Crucified and Risen Lord. This Icon removes our forgetfulness of the eschatological Coming of the Risen One, the eschatological Newness of the Living One (Apoc. 21, 5; 1, 17). Now&quot;we call Christ&apos;s image &apos;Christ&apos;... The Icon of Christ is nothing other than Christ, apart, of course, from the difference in essence&quot; (St. Theodore the Studite).

The identification of the selfsameness of Christ with His image leads to my final point: Orthodoxy is the Church and not an ideology! It is a gathering of the people and, particularly, a Eucharistic gathering of living Icons. This is what we must emphasize today! Not an internet-online-virtual illusion of communication, but the Icon as the visible and true communication of the Kingdom; such must be the future of Orthodoxy because such is the future Christ promises Hi Church. In the Eucarist, we are taught not only to venerate and greet icons, but also the other members of the Synaxis, not passin the living icons - people- by, but greeting and embracing them. So, the Icon is indeed the right method of looking at the world...Onlythis iconic approach will save Orthodoxy from becoming a secular organization conforming to the image of the world. 

May this, our commemoration of the Sunday of Orthodoxy today in Los Angeles, serve as a source of sanctification, strenght, and hope for the Orthodox faithful.

Finally, from this Holy Ambon we extend our wholehearted well-wishes to the beloved Hierarchs, to the devout clergy, and to the entire flock of the Orthodox Church of America, and we pray that God may bless our efforts and good works, to the glory of our Father Who is in Heaven and the honor of our Church and all the living icons within.

God bless His Grace, and I am grateful the Homily was printed for while listening I thought how I could remember and convey even half of it.

Post by charlotte on Feb 27, 2010, 12:10pm

Reminds me also of Emerson&apos;s&quot;We are symbols and inhabit symbols&quot;.

I loved Icons from the very beginning. They are painted after a manner that gazing at them establishes a personal relationship forthwith, and&quot;the honor paid to the Icon passes on to the prototype&quot;is felt and apparent. Icons depicting event adapt themselves to one&apos;s capacity of understanding. It is also easy or natural to comprehend that Icons which depict the Saints are not what they looked like,&quot;but are images of the future they portray&quot;. Emblems and items depicted with them assist in understanding.

I very much liked your post #655 on the last page treating of The Sacraments. As Icons are made of material things,

&quot;In most of the sacraments the Church takes material things water, bread, wine, oil and makes them a vehicle of the Spirit. In this way the sacraments look back to the Incarnation, when Christ took material flesh and made it a vehicle of the Spirit; and they look forward to, or rather they anticipate, the apocatastasis and final redemption of matter at the Last Day.&quot;

A good weekend to You and All

Yes. It&apos;s not merely a &apos;spiritual Paradise&apos; we are looking forward to, but:&quot;The final redemption of matter&quot;

And for those who recognize that fact, we can begin to anticipate that state and to live, as it were, in a &apos;foretaste&apos; of that final redemption; then matter begins to respond differently to us even now-thus the &apos;miracles&apos; which the lives of the Saints bear witness to.

Altho&apos; good disposition (as Aristotle hath it)
may be by beauty educated, and aspire
to theoretic wisdom (as Plato would teach)
and Ethick therewithal claim honor of the same rank
the ideal philosophy ascribeth to man,
yet, if for lack of faith he sink that claim, I see
a thing of hap without place in Reality.

On no hand is&apos;t deny&apos;d that terms of Right or Wrong
are wholly pertinent to man&apos;s condition on earth;
nor that, whatever his destiny may be, his origin
was bestial and his first ethick a rudiment,
that shifting ever and shaping in the story of man
at every time is the index of his growth in grace;
and, if the change of customs that the herd adopt
for comfort and to ensure what they most value in life,
hath moral tendency upward, then thatt tendency is
the animal sanction of virtue, and will take honor as such.

But Duty instill&apos;d with order is so almighty of kind
that &apos;twil make Law a Habit, whence all social codes
outlast their turn and time, and in arrear of life
hold the common folk backward from their nobler vaunt,
lagging and dragging, whether as a garment outgrown
tatter&apos;d and foolish, or as strong fetters and chains
wherein they lie fast-bound in misery and iron. 

Hence cometh all the need and fame of TEACHERS, men
of inborn nobility, call&apos;d Prophets of God,
Saviours of society, Seers of the promised land,
thatt white-filleted company that Aeneas found
circled around Musus in the Elysian fields,
the loved and lovable whose names liv evermorw,
the sainted pioneers of salvation, unto whom
all wisdom won and all man&apos;s future hope is due;
and with inspiration of their ampler air we see
cur Ethick split up shear and sharply atwain; two kinds
diverse in kind ther be; the one of social need
lower, stil holding backward in the clutch of earth,
from old animal unredeem&apos;d; the other
higher and spiritual, that by personal affiance
with beauty hath made escape, soaring away to where
the Ring of Being closeth in the Vision of God.

Sticklers for equality will hear nought of this,
arguing that social is but a past-personal,
personal a future-social, tenses of one verb,
the amatum and amabo on the stem of &apos;love,&apos;
virtue&apos;s pure nativ stock which hath no need of graft;
a doctrin kindly at heart, that cajoleth alike
diffidence of the ruler and conceit of the crowd,
who in collusion float its credit; and awhile
their ship of state runneth like the yacht in the race
that with full bellying sail, for lack of seamanship,
seemeth to forge ahead while it loseth leeway.

I understand what you say.

Gregory Palamas came up often since the beginning of this thread over a year ago now with the lone and cryptic sentence causing my Mind to stop in a peculiar way, and read in the Church yesterday was the Healing of the Paralytic again, but because the House was full and so many waiting by the door to be healed, the men uncovered the roof to lower down the bed on which the Paralytic was lying to Jesus to be healed. To the scribes Jesus said not to reason about these things in their heart but to have Faith, the indispensable condition for Salvation.

Father Ceko commented on this time being annual checkup of the Soul, a spring cleaning for Easter, and having&quot;completed this second week of Great Lent, not to drift awaybut to hold fast to Christ.

Troparion to St. Gregory Palamas

O light of Orthody! O teacher of the Church, its confirmation! O ideal of monks and invincible champoin of theologians! O wonder-working Gregory, glory of Thessalonica and preacher of grace! Always intercede before the Lord that our souls may be saved!

Kontakion to St. Gregory of Palamas

Holy and divine instrument of wisdom, joyful trumpet of theology, with one accord we sing your praises, O Gregory, inspired by God. But since you now stand in mind and spirit before the Original Mind, guide our minds to Him, O father, that we may cry to you, Hail, preacher of grace.

Commemorated today

Great Martyr Theodore of Tyro

The same Saint Theodore of Amasea, Patron Saint of Venice, I wrote about briefly in post # 675. I should, and do know by now that Saints are given different names according to either their place of birth, their Achievements in certain Cities or Regions, Estate in the Church and Deification.

The Saint&apos;s other names are&quot;Theodore Euchatia - from the place, Euchais, to which his body had been carried, and where he was held in such high veneration that the city came to be frequently spoken of as Theodoropolis&quot;, and in&quot;Eastern Christianity he is more often known as Theodore the Recruit.

&quot;Theodore Stratelates (&quot;the General&quot;) was martyred at Heraclea, and parallel miracles, such as slaying the dragon, (represented by a crocodile in his statue in St. Mark&apos;s Square), were attributed to him. At Dobarsko, the church of Theodore Tyro and Theodore Stratelates recombines the doublet.&quot;

St. Theodore, 4th century, was born in East Syria or Armenia,&quot;enlisted in the army and was sent with his cohort to winter quarters in Pontus in Anatolia. When the edict against the Christians was issued by the emperors, he was brought before the magistrates at Amasea and ordered to offer sacrifice to the gods, When he refused, the magistrates gave him some time, because of his youth, for reflection.&quot;This he employed in burning the Temple of Cybele&quot;, the Catholic Encyclopedia reports.&quot;

The Christians were considered dangerous to the State,&quot;which depended on the good-will of the Great Mother of Anatolia, Cybele&quot;, and Theodore was&quot;taken and burned at the stake.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_of_Amasea 

I don&apos;t know if this link works, but in it is stated that St. Theodore appeared in sleep to the Archbishop of Constantinople, Eudoxius, and told him that rather than eating regular food , kollyva should be made for the hungry people.&quot;The bishop asked what kollyva might be, and the Saint answered,&quot;Kollyva is what we call boiled wheat in Euchatia&quot;, or&quot;the same Kovila Charlotte has been raving about, save she used rice again in making more yesterday, but I forgive her.&quot;

Pope Saint Leo the Great

Venerated by Roman Catholic and Eastern Catholic Churches, Eastern Orthodoxy, and the Anglican Church.

Tradition tells that Saint Leo was born in Tuscany.&quot;Pope Leo&apos;s pontificate began on 29 September 440 and lasted until his death on 10 November 461. Pope Leo&apos;s pontificate, beside Pope Gregory I, was the most significant and important in the Church of antiquity.&quot;

Cyril of Alexandria claimed&quot;patriarchal jurisdiction over Palestine&quot;, and&quot;appears to have tryed to persuade Saint Leo to throw the weight of Rome behind his claim....&quot;

&quot;However, aside from important governance matters of Church, Saint Pope Leo is probably most notably known for meeting Atila the Hun outside Rome in 452, and convincing him to turn back from his sack of Western Europe.&quot;

 http://acta-sanctorum.blogspot.com/2009/11/pope-saint-leo-great.html 

Though the Orthodox and Catholic Church were not yet divided, the authentic Leadership of the Church was disputed. Nothing is said of Saint Leo as a Wonder-worker, but here is quite a bit of history concerning the time.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_I 

Leo the Great, Pope of Rome

Orthodoxy

&quot;According to some, this Saint was born in Rome, but according to otheres in Tyrrenia (Tuscany), and was concecrated to the archiepiscopal throne of Rome in 440. In 448, when Saint Flavian, Archbishop of Constantinople, summoned Eutyches, an archimandrite in Constantinople, to give account of his teaching that there was only one nature in Christ after the Incarnation, Eutyches appealed to Saint Leo in Rome. After Saint Leo had carefully examined Eutyches&apos;s teachings, he wrote an epistle to Saint Flavian, setting forth the Orthodox teaching of the person of Christ, and His two natures, and also counseling Flavian, should Eutyches sincerely repent of his error, he should be received back with all good will. More....

Apolytikion in the fourth Tone

The truth of things hath revealed thee to thy flock as a rule of faith, an icon of meekness, and a teacher of temperance; for this cause, thou hast achieved the heights by humility, riches by poverty. O Father and Hierarch Leo, intercede with Christ God that our souls be saved.

Kontakion in the Third Tone

Seated on the priestly throne, O glorious Leo, with the Holy Trinity&apos;s inspired and God-given doctrines thou didst stop the gaping mouths of spiritual lions and didst shine upon thy flock the light of God-knowledge, and art glorified now as a divine initiate of the sublime grace of God.

I came across the newest incyclical of

&quot;Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople&apos;s newest incyclical encourages dialogue between the Orthodx Church and other Christian churches and laments those who are&quot;unacceptably fanatical&quot;in challenging such dialogue. He specifically condemned the false rumors spread about Catholic-Orthodox dialogue. Patriarch Bartholomew&apos;s patriarchal and synodal encyclical was dated Feb. 21, Orthodox Sunday, when the Orthodox Church celebrates the defeat of the iconoclastic heresy.&quot;

The&quot;unacceptable fanatical&quot;challenge comes from a group of zealot Monks violently opposing attempts to mend the rift between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches.

Orthodoxy, Patriarch Bartholomew said, must be must be promoted with humility and interpreted in the light of each historical period and cultural circumstances.

&quot;To this purpose, Orthodoxy must be in constant dialogue with the world. The Orthodox Church does not fear dialogue because truth is not afraid of dialogue,&quot;Bartholomew continued, saying that a Church enclosed within itself would no longer be&quot;catholic.&quot;(Universal)

&quot;Dialogue with the outside world must first pass through all those who call themselves Christians, he wrote.

&quot;We must first converse as Christians among ourselves in order to resolve our differences, in order that our witness to the outside world may be credible,&quot;the Patriarch continued, citing Jesus&apos; prayer that all his disciplines&quot;may be one.&quot;

&quot;Beloved children in the Lord, Orthodoxy has no need of either fanaticism or bigotry to protect itself. Whoever believes that Orthodoxy has the truth does not fear dialogue, because truth has never been endangered by dialogue,&quot;the Patriarch stated.&quot;Orthodoxy cannot proceed with intolerance and extremism.

&quot;Patriarch Bartholomew encouraged Orthodox believers to have&quot;utmost confidence&quot;in their Mother Church.&quot;

Listening and hearing while reading Orthodox Teaching, it does not take all that long to discern the Truth the Heart comprehends.

The Apostle Archippus

&quot;The holy, glorious, all-laudable Apostle Archippus is numbered among the Seventy Apostles . He is mentioned by the Apostle Paul in his epistle to the Colossians (Colossians 4:17) and his letter to the Apostle Philemon (Philemon 11:2). Along with Sts. Philemon and Apphia he ministered to the town of Colossae from its Christian center, the home of Philemon. During a pagan feast the Church had gathered in Philemon&apos;s home for prayer. When the pagans learned of it they raided the home and took Sts. Archippus, Philemon, and Apphia to be killed. They were whipped, buried up to their waists and then stoned. St. Archippus survived the attack, barely, and the pagans then pulled him out and left him for the children&apos;s amusement. They stabbed him all over with knives and he gave up his soul to God.&quot;

It&apos;s hard to read how many ways there are to kill a person, or imagine oneself to have lived in those times, however, when one reads enough a good picture and connections form, Apostles and Saints I never heard of with names hard to pronounce.

Archippus the Apostle, Philemon the Apostle&amp;His Wife, Apphia, Onesimos the Disciple of Paul

&quot;Philemon, who was from Colossae, a city in Phrygia, was a man both wealthy and noble; Apphia was his wife. Archippus became Bishop of the Church in Colossae. All three were disciples of the Apostle Paul....

Kontakion in the Second Tone

We praise Christ&apos;s Apostles as bright stars illumination the ends of the world, glorious Philemon, Onesimus, Archippus, and with them, wise Apphia, crying: Pray unceasingly in behalf of us all.

Honered also is

The Venerable Dositheus

&quot;Dositheus was a disciple of the glorious Abba Dorotheus who lived in the cenobitic monastic community of the Venerables Serdius, John and Barsanuphius the Great. Dositheus was a kindsmen of a general and came to Jerusalem to visit the Holy Shrines. Once while he was gazing upon the Icon of the Dreadful Judgment in a church, a women clothed in purple attire approached him and began explaining the Icon to him. Finally, before parting, she said that if you desire to be saved, you should fast, obstain from meat, and pray to God often. That was the All-Holy Virgin Birthgiver of God [The Theotokos]. The heart of the young Dositheus became inflamed&quot;and he became a monk.&quot;The young saint lived in the sixth century&quot;, and remains&quot;an example of monastic obedience....&quot;

 http://www.westsrbdio.org/prolog/my.html?day=19&amp;month;=February 

 OBEDIENCE 

 Obedience without murmering, salvation complete,
Among the spiritual, the first pearl; stone most precious.
This Pearl, from Eve&apos;s necklace, unraveled,
And after it, all the goods, by God, bestowed.
The devil speaks both then and now: To God, do not listen,
Rather, according to the thoughts of your mind, live only!
Thus speaks the devil from time immemorial who detested the light,
Thus speaking, the disobedient with his noose he fitted.
Christ came, to the people cried out: the obedient He summoned,
To every call, the disobedient did not respond,
The scene of Paradise from Christ until now, repeats itself,
The obedient to Paradise is raised, the disobedient falls.
To his spiritual father, the true monk is obedient,
The father to the Church, the Church to Christ, her Lord.
Obedience, the reliable path toward salvation is,
Of the spiritual necklace; first light, the first pearl. 

Then I found this marvelous rock-cut tomb of Artaxerxes I of Persia.

Interpretations of Artaxerxes actions, by the seventeenth century Christian minister and founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, who&quot;interpreted several passages in the Old and new Testament to support limiting government interference in religious matters. Williams published The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution, describing his analysis of why a civil government should be seperate from religion according to the Bible. Williams believed that Israel was a unique covenant kingdom and not an appropriate model for New Testament Christians who believed that the Old Testament covenant had been fulfilled.&quot;

I have to read up on Roger Williams and learn if the seperation of Church and State here in America was thence influenced. The Orthodx Church confirms that the Old Testament Covenant has been fulfilled.

Have a good day

St. Leo Bishop of Catania, Sicily (709-789)

&quot;Saint Leo was a bishop in the city of Catania, in Cicily. He was famed for his benevolence and charity, and his Christian love for the poor and vagrant. Yhr Lord granted him the gift of healing various illnesses, and working miracles.

&quot;St Leo often urged (the sorcerer) Heliodorus to repent of his wicked ways and return to God, but in vain.&quot;Unable to persuade Heliodorus who disturbed Service in the Church, St. Leo took him into the city square and together they jumped into a pyre built from wood in which Heliodorus burned but St. Leo remained unharmed.

With hymns of praise let us crown Leo, who was consecrated to the Lord from early childhood; he received grace while still a babe in swaddling clothes. He is a bright shining star in the Church: its valiant defender and firm support!

A few days ago I happened on the Rila Monastery and thought I will find St. John, honered today.

Saint John of Rila

&quot;Saint John of Rila 876 - c. 946), was the first Bulgarian hermit. He was revered as a saint while he was still alive. The legend surrounding him tells of wild animals that freely came up to him and birds that landed on his hands. His followers founded many churches in his honor, including the famous Rila Monastery. One of these churches was only discovered in 2008 in the town of Veliko, Tarnovo. Today, he is honored as the patron saint of the Bulgarian people and as one of the most important saints in the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.

&quot;After accepting the life of a monk, he left the monastery in order to continue his life in solitude and prayer.&quot;St. John of Rila performed a multitude of miracles of which Tsar Petar I heard and made His way to visit Saint John and seek spiritual advice, but found the dwelling of the the Saint inaccessable. St. John refused to meet with the Tsar and&quot;the two men only bowed to each other from a distance.&quot;The Saint also refused the Tsar&apos;s gifts, advising him to give them to the poor. A wonderful fresco depicting Saint John on the link.

Orthodoxy in Antarctica

&quot;St. Ivan Rilski Col on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, is named after John of Rila. The St. Ivan Rilski chapel built in 2003 at St. Kliment Ohridski Base on Livingston Island is the first Eastern Orthodox edifice in Antarctica and the southernmost Eastern Orthodox building of worship in the world.&quot;

The Rulers of Russia and Eastern Europe are much involved in the Church.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Ivan_Rilski_Chapel 

There is also the Trinity Church of familiar design in Antarchica. It&quot;is a small Russian Orthodox church on King George Island near Russian Bellingshausen Station in Antarctica. It is the southernmost Eastern Orthodx church in the world.

&quot;The church is manned year-round by one or two Orthox priests, who are hieromonks of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra volunteering for the Antarctic assignement.&quot;The Priests are rotated yearly but some chose to go back.

Effort and Dedication

&quot;The church is a 15m-high wooden structure built in traditional Russian style. It can accomodate up tp 30 worshipers. The structure was built out of Siberian Pine by Altay carpenters led by K. V. Khromov, then dismantled, taken by truck to Kaliningrad and shipped to King George Island by the Russian supply ship Academician Vavilov. It was assembled on high ground near the sea shore by the staff of Bellingshausen Station, under the general supervision of the 30-year-old Father Kallistrat (Romanenko), who was to become the church&apos;s first priest. Kallistrat, a hieromonk of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra, had previously served at the Lavra&apos;s skete on Anzer Island in the subarctic Solovki Archipelago.&quot;

Do you skip over all the Russian names? I have to look trice sometimes to make sure I spell them correctly. As I said before, the Orthodox Church is everywhere but not well known, I didn&apos;t, and Geography is interesting. And thanks again to Wiki.

You neglected to post THIS from the propogue today:&quot;Water is finer than earth; fire is finer than water; air is finer than fire; electricity is finer than air. Nevertheless, air is a dense element in comparison to the spiritual world and electricity is a dense element in comparison to the spiritual world.

Electricity is very fine but the voice is finer than electricity; the thought finer than the voice; the spirit finer than thoughts.

The air is fine and it carries the voice over a great distance. Electricity is fine and it carries light over a great distance. Nevertheless, how much more is every deed, every word and every thought of yours carried to all ends of the spiritual world. O how awesome it is to commit sinful deeds and to speak sinful words and to think insane thoughts! To what immeasurable distances are amassed from that on the waves of the spiritual sea! But do not go into the details of the unknown world. The main thing is that you know and that you measure how all of your deeds, words and thoughts unavoidably create an impression on all four sides: On God and the spiritual world, on nature, on men and on your soul. If you train yourself in this knowledge, you will attain a higher level of saving vigilance.&quot;

From the Prologue of Ochrid

I&apos;ve just finished an interesting, semi-autobiographical novel by Doris Lessing entitled,&quot;The four gated city&quot;about people living in England during the middle 50&apos;s to early 70&apos;s who were persecuted by both, their society in general and psychiatrists in particular, for being telepathic and thus, not being able to cope with the fabric of lies with which our culture is woven. She compared it to the witch hunts that took place earlier in the same vicinity. I think you would enjoy reading it. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Mar 6, 2010, 12:05pm

I didn&apos;t read the Prologue yesterday, but have read the quote before, at least in part, and how true it is. What are our sinful deeds if we do no wrong to any man? The sinful thing is more likely the motivation why we do no wrong in calculating a gain, or it can simply be that doing no wrong is its own reward: a cherished Freedom from worry, a good feeling of lightness and ease when looking everyone straight in the eye. Sinful words such as slander one learns to control on account that feeling guilty distrurbes one&apos;s peace terribly. I remember not being able to sleep for hours because of what I had said and had to turn on the light to dispel the darkness engulfing me. A good teacher.

I find a good way to negate a sinful thought is an immediate&quot;Lord have mercy&quot;, but then it is said that the Virtues of men are the vices of Saints. It&apos;s scary to think what all we impress on the Spiritual World, but I&apos;m always In Love, as it is.

Thank you for suggesting the book, we still experience telepathic communication but have been taught to ignore it by sterile science.

I read much about the history of Great Lent and fasting.

Today is Soul Saturday

&quot;Now is the acceptable time! Now is the day of Salvation! Visit my soul in the abundance of Your mercy; take away the heavy burden of my transgressions only Lover of mankind!&quot;

&quot;The primary aim of fasting is to make us conscious of our depen- dence upon God. If practiced seriously, the Lenten abstinence from food -particularly in the opening days -involves a considerable measure of real hunger, and also a feeling of tiredness and physical exhaustion. The purpose of this is to lead us in turn to a sense of inward brokenness and contrition; to bring us, that is, to the point where we appreciate the full force of Christ&apos;s statement, &apos;Without Me you can do nothing&apos; (John 15:5).

&quot;Yet it would be misleading to speak only of this element of weariness and hunger. Abstinence leads, not merely to this, but also to a sense of lightness, wakefulness, freedom and joy. Even if the fast proves dibilitating at first, afterwards we find that it enables us to sleep less, to think more clearly, and to work more decisively. As many doctors acknowledge, periodical fasts contribute to bodily hygiene. While involving genuine self-denial, fasting does not seek to do violence to our body but rather to restore it to health and equilibrium. Most of us in the Western world habitually eat more than we need. Fasting liberates our body from the burden of exces- sive weight and makes it a willing partner in the task of prayer, alert and responsive to the voice of the Spirit.&quot;

People could save billions if fasting were advertised as the&quot;Diet par Excellance&quot;.

 HOMILY 

About fasting and prayer

This is the saving prescription of the greatest Physician of human souls. This is the remidy tried and proved. Another remedy for lunacy, there is not. What kind of sickness is that? That is the presence and dominance of an evil spirit in man, a dangerous evil spirit who labors to eventually destroy the body and soul of man. The boy whom our Lord freed from an evil spirit; this evil spirit that has hurled him at times in the fire, at times in the water just in order to destroy him.

As long as a man only philosophizes about God he is weak and completely helpless against the evil spirit. The evil spirit ridicules the feeble sophistry of the world. But as soon as a man begins to fast and pray to God, the evil spirit becomes filled with indescribable fear. In no way can the evil spirit tolerate the aroma of prayer and fasting. The sweet-smelling aroma chokes him and weakens him to utter exhaustion. In a man who only philosophizes about faith, there is spacious room in him for the demons. But in a man who sincerely begins to pray to God and to fast with patience and hope, for the demon it becomes narrow and constricted and he must flee from such a man. Against certain bodily ills there exists only one remedy. Against the greatest ill of the soul, demonism, there exist two remedies, which must be utilized at one and the same time: fasting and prayer. The apostles and saints fasted and prayed to God. That is why they were so powerful against evil spirits.

O gracious Jesus, our Physician and Helper in all miseries, strengthen us by the power of Your Holy Spirit that we may be able to adhere to Your saving preceots concerning fasting and prayer for the sake of our salvation and the salvation of our fellow men.


It is one thing to read here the words in my head, with which the Matins begin every Sunday, and another to hear them sung in Church:

Priest: In peace let us pray to the Lord.

Choir: Lord have mercy

Priest: Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by Thy grace.

Choir: Lord have mercy

Sincerely

Holy, and most sublime Ornament I have ever seen.

O Germ of Gold, thou seed of life supernal,
Birth-gift of all the world, yet world-unknown,
Immortal Son, of man the fruit eternal,
Celestial Adam in corruption sewn:
Now that I know thee, how shall I deny thee,
Or stay these vernal calends to proclaim,
That from my wintry soil shall vivify thee
With cordial heat that calls the heavenly flame?
Grow as I lesson, blossom as I shrivel,
Feed on my death as fire consumes the brand,
Be thou my lord and I shall be thy drivel,
Stamp with thy angel all my ore dis-manned.

Sacre this bread, transmute this mortal wine.
Till in my mass no crumb nor drop remain.

The Poet Divine


Kontakion (Grave Tone)

No longer does the flaming sword guard the gate of Eden,
for a marvelous quenching is come upon it,
Even the Tree of the Cross.
The sting has been taken from death, and the victory from Hades.
And, You, my Savior, has appeared unto those in Hades saying:
Enter again into Paradise.

The Next Step

Saturday last was windy and it began to rain lightly when I parked my car in front of St. Matthew Church to attend the Vesper. The door to the Church was open at a ca. 45 angle as I stepped on the first of two steps to the Vestibule, by the second step the door was open 90. It took a split second to be startled, I turned and kept looking at the door to which was affixed, on the bottom, one of those weighty brass door-stops that either falls automatically at the point to which the door is opened, or is forced down by the tip of the shoe. The stop was on the ground holding the door. I stood rationalizing: was the door pushed open by a gust of wind? No, I would have felt the rather strong gust of wind required to move the heavy wooden door and saw and &apos;heard&apos; it moving, but I didn&apos;t. A good chance also that such a gust would have flung the door open as far as possible to the other side or even against the wall of the Church. Moreover, I would have heard the door-stop fall, a sound I know well, but I didn&apos;t. I felt, saw, and heard nothing. All was still and I stood perplexed at what just happened as if it didn&apos;t happen, but there was this feeling and I walked into the Church.

The Cross we venerated this Sunday at St. Steven&apos;s was the same in form and color as on September 20th last year.

Mara the bitter Ocean, the&quot;Star of the Sea&quot;Church by the Ocean where I live.

&quot;The present feast has been placed in the middle of Great Lent for another reason. The Fast can be likened to the spring of Marah whose waters the children of Israel encountered in the wilderness. This water was undrinkable due to its bitterness but became sweet when the Holy Prophet Moses dipped the wood into its depth. Likewise, the wood of the Cross sweetens the days of the Fast, which are bitter and often grievious because of our tears. Yet Christ comforts us during our course through the desert of the Fast, guiding and leading us by His hand to the spiritual Jerusalem on high by the power of His Resurrection.&quot;

&quot;Moreover, as the Holy Cross is called the Tree of Life, it is placed in the middle of the Feast, as the ancient tree of life was placed in the middle of the garden of Eden. By this, our Holy Fathers wished to remind us of Adam&apos;s gluttony as well as the fact that through this Tree has condemnation been abolished. Therefore, if we bind ourselves to the Holy Cross, we shall never encounter death but shall inherit life eternal.&quot;

Commentary

&quot;Every day as Orthodox Christians we are called to deny the self, take up our cross, and follow Christ. And every day we falter, grabbing hold of our own agendas, believing that our will to be more important to God&apos;s.&quot;

How one comes to know what God&apos;s Will is becomes apparent in due time ever so subtly like an invisible and gentle force, firstly feeling that one can never turn away. Hard to explain.

The reading was from the Epistle Of the holy Apostle Paul to the Hebrews.

&quot;Brethren, seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesss, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sin. He can have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness. Because of this he is required as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins. And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called by God, just as Aaron was. So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but it was He who said to Him:&quot;You are My Son, today I have begotten You.&quot;As He also said in another place:&quot;You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.&quot;

After the Divine Liturgy, Papadia Sandra came with paper and pen and sat down beside me, asking for my phone number so I knew, saying Steven err.... Bauer, I added, had called, but didn&apos;t tell me what He might have said, it seemed important, but I suppressed a question or two and some more, thinking, how comes it that when I call nothing happens, whereas some people can pull strings so effectively. The Words&quot;Thank You&quot;are most wanting.

I joyned my &apos;Guide&apos; J, a lovely Lady, for lunch on Her, she insisted, spoke with the German Lady again, sat beside MA, a funny lady who complained that Church, Lunch, Bible Study, and Custodian Meeting was too much for one Sunday, but, retorted a Lady sitting across the table, it has to be today because.... Another Lady asked me to move over here, and that was my piece of cake, and so it went for 5 minutes over my head until I shrank like a wall flower into my chair, fixing my eyes on a painting on the wall of a Tsar, waiting for an opportunity to asked who He is. It looks like I have no choice but to tumble.

I am looking forward to a call from the Church!

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Mar 9, 2010, 10:43am

On the wall of the Lunch Hall of the Church hangs a painting of Tsar Peter I of Bulgaria, on the other end one of George Washington.&quot;Peter was particularely generous toward the Church, which he endowed lavishly throughout his reign. The emperor&apos;s generosity reached such an extent that it was seen as a corrupting factor by even Orthodox clerics, like Cosmas Presbyter. Others chose a path away from the temptations of the secular world, most notably Saint Ivan of Rila, but their ascetic existence still drew the attention of the monarch.&quot;

As I wrote below, post # 676, the Tsar sought the advice of Saint Ivan (John) and&quot;his uncle-in-law, the Patriarch of Constantinople Theophylact.&quot;Peter is considered&quot;a weak ruler&quot;by Historians, and&quot;presided over a long and relatively peacful reign, albeit one poorly illuminated by foreign or native sources.&quot;I don&apos;t know the meaning of the latter statement, it seems to me any Ruler presiding over a long and relatively peaceful period is a strong Ruler, and what foreign illumination would he need having Saint John and a Patriarch as an Uncle. The Orthodox Church canonized the Tsar as a Saint.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_I_of_Bulgaria 

It seems that there was not much, if any, seperation of Church and State in&quot;Holy Russia&quot;and neighboring Nations, and todays Rulers are loyal to the Church, visiting their Holy Places. I read much this morning of the Revelation of the Virgin to Archbishop John of Russia or Archbishop of Shanghai and San Francisco, of which I&apos;ll post later.

Today, the Church honors

Polycarp of Smyrna

&quot;The holy, glorious and right-victorious Hieromartyr - was a bishop and martyr of the early Church and the writer and subject, respectively, of two of the works in the collection called the Apostolic Fathers. The year of his birth is reported as anywhere from A.D. 69 to 81, and his martyrdom is recorded as being from A.D. 155 to 157. According to tradition, he was burned at the stake in Smyrna (the seat of his episcopacy and modern day Izmir in Turkey), and he was also reported to be a disciple of the Apostle John.&quot;

I have read some of His Letters, and was overwhelmed by the copious Literature on various and interesting subjects of the Church Fathers.

&quot;[A.D. 65 -100-155.] The Epistle of Policarp is usually made a sort of preface to those of Ignatius, for reasons which will be obvious to the reader. Yet he was born later, and lived to a much later period. They seem to have been friends from their days of their common pupilage under St. John; and there is nothing improbable in the conjecture of Usher, that he was the&quot;angel of the church of Smyrna,&quot;to whom the Master says,&quot;Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.&quot;

&quot;His pupil Irenus gives us one of the very few portraits of an apostolic man which are to be found in antiquity, in a few sentences which are a picture:&quot;I could describe the very place in which the blessed Polycarp sat and taught; his going out and coming in; the whole tenor of his life; his personal appearance; how he would speak of the conversation he held with John and with others who have seen the Lord. How did he make mention of their words and of whatever he heard from them respecting the Lord.&quot;Thus he unconsciously tantalizes our reverent curiosity. Alas! that such conversations were not written for our learning. But there is a wise Providence in what is withheld, as well as in the inestimable treasure we have received.&quot;

&apos;Tis a Treasure Chest

 http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.toc.html 

Today

The Prologue from Ohrid

 REFLECTION 

&quot;Conceal your spiritual treasure and do not reveal them unnecessarely. Behold, how men conceal and hide their material wealth and how, when forced to reveal how much they have, they always conceal the greater amount and only reveal the lesser amount. Very few are the number of men who want to reveal all that they possess, and fewer still are those who would reveal more than they, in reality, possess. This, the world considers frivolous and mindless. This clearly shows you how you need to conceal your spiritual wealth, that is, your virtues, your good works, your fastings, your vigils, and your prayers.&quot;

The wise children of the world conceal their material wealth so thieves don&apos;t hear of it, and the thives of spiritual treasures&quot;are the spirits of envy.&quot;

&quot;As soon as you reveal your spiritual treasure, they will endeavor to belittle it and to squander it. Just as soon as you reveal it without need [let us say, out of vanity, so as to be praised], they have seized it and desparaged it; and you, O rich man of spiritual treasure, will imperceptibly and sudden become a poor man. Many who were spiritually rich, the saints, made themselves out to be fools before the world so that by appearing foolish, they would conceal their great wisdom and strenght within themselves. The Abba Isaiah writes,

&quot;Those good works which are performed in secret are more pleasing to God.&quot;

And Saint Polycarp wrote,&quot;by grace ye are saved, not of works&quot;.

A good day to the world

Dear Charlotte,
All I did was ask His Grace while he was here how you were doing and if Fr. Nick had had a chance to bless you to be a catecumen? He told me to call and make sure you were being taken care of.

I mentioned to Papadia Sandra how modest and naturally reticent you were when it came to putting yourself forward,(which are good and unusual qualities to have in our day of &apos;Me first!&apos;) and thanked her for reaching out to you.

I asked if they had ongoing classes for catecumens or if they had any homework to give you, so, don&apos;t thank me yet!

Anyway, may God bless you to begin looking a little deeper into the Church. (Which, by the way, is from the Greek word &apos;Ecclesia&apos;, which means, &apos;Those who are called together.&apos;) Re: The Secret of the Universe

Third Finding the Head of St. John the Forerunner

&quot;The Third Discovery of the Henerable Head of the Holy Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist John occurred in about the year 850.&quot;It&quot;was found in the city of Emesia during a time of unrest at Constantinople connected with the exile of St. John Chrysostom.

&quot;It was transferred to Komana during the Saracen raids (about 820-820) and was hidden in the ground during a period of iconoclastic persecution. When the veneration of icons was restored, Patriarch Ignatius (847-857) saw in a vision the place where the head of St. John the Forerunner was hidden. The Patriarch communicated this to the emperor, who sent a deligation to Komana. There the head was found a third time around the year 850.&quot;

On May 25, it was placed in a Church at the Court at Constantinople, part being on Mt. Athos.

The Acts 18, 24-25

And a certain Jew named Apollos, born in Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

This man was instructed in the way of the Lord: and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.

The acts 19, 1-4

And it came to pass, that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coast came to Ephasus, and finding certain disciples,

2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost, since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.

3 And he said unto them, Unto what then where you baptized? And they said, Unto John&apos;s baptism.

4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentence, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.

Have a great day

Saint Porphyrius of Gaza

&quot;This great Arch-shepherd was born of wealthy parents in Thessalonica. From his youth, until age twenty-five, Porphyrius remained in Thessalonica, the town of his birth. After that, he took leave of his parents and worldly life and withdrew to the wilderness of Egypt. Under the guidance of an experienced spiritual father, the young Porphyrius was tensured a monk and remained there for five years. He then visited the Holy Land in the company of the monk Mark, his faithful companion. In the proximity of Jerusalem, he lived an ascetical life in a cave, again for five years. But then the legs of Porphyrius became weak and he was unable to walk.

&quot;Nevertheless, crawling on his knees, he continually attended the Divine Services of God. One night, our Lord appeared to him of a vision and cured him of the infirmity in his legs and he became completely whole. When he was lected Bishop of Gaza, Porphyrius accepted this obligation with a heavy heart. In Gaza, he found only two-hundred-eighty Christians. All other inhabitants were very fanatical idolaters. Only by his great faith and patience did Porphyrius succeed to convert the inhabitants of Gaza to the Faith of Christ. He personally traveled to Constantinople to see Emperor Arcadius and Patriarch John Chrysostom to seek their support in this unequal struggle with the idolaters. He received the desired support. The idolatrous temples were closed and the idols destroyed and he built a beautifuk church with thirty marble columns. Empress Eudoxia especially assisted in the building of this church. Porphyrius lived long enough to see the entire town of Gaza converted to the Christian Faith, but only after his many efforts, sufferings and prayerful tears to god. He died peacefully in the year 421 A D. He was a miracle-worker both during his life and after his death. Even today, his relics repose in Gaza.&quot;

 HYMN OF PRAISE
SAINT PORPHYRIUS THE PARALYTIC 

 The monk Mark asks Porphyrius:

You were paralytic, holy father,

On your knees, to church you crawled,

My hand in yours, you held

Yesterday thus and today otherwise!

At night you were ill, behold healthy you dawned

So suddenly, who healed you?

Of the rare physician, tell me the name-

To Mark, Porpyrius replied:

My Healer, my Creator is,

Last night on Golgotha, I fell asleep

But severe pain, completely overpowered,

As though in person, I sa clearly in a dream

On the Cross, my Lord hanging,

And on the other cross, the thief.

As I saw, so I cried out!

O God and Lord, remember me,

In Your kingdom, remember me!

The Good Lord, to the thief said:
Go down and his body heal,

As your soul, I healed.

Quickly the thief, the cross descended,

Embraced me, and raised me up:

Saying: To our Savior, draw near!

At that moment, the Lord also descended the Cross,

Lifted the Cross and, on me he placed it.

Receive the holy wood, He said,

And for the sake of eternal salvation, carry it.

As soon as I, with my hands, grabbed the Cross,

Immediately stood and was immediately made whole.

To God my Creator, glory be,

To Christ my Savior, glory be! 

And Thanks be to God for all things.

John of Patmos, John the Presbyter, and the Blessed Polycarp of Smyrna.

&quot;John the Prebyter (John the Elder&quot;/&quot;John the Priest&quot;) is an obscure figure of the early Church who is either distinguished from or identified with the Apostle John. He appears in a fragment from the church father Papias of Hierapolis as one of the author&apos;s sources and is first unequivically from the Apostle by Eusebius of Caesarea, the interpreter of both Papius and Polycarp.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Presbyter 

The Hieromartyr Polycarp was commemorated by the Church on March 8, and I gave a link to His enormous Corpus of Writings on that date.

Eusebius of Caesarea identified the obscure figure of John the Presbyter with John of Patmos, the Author of the Book of Revelation, but the Author of the Text of Revelation gives his name as&quot;John&quot;only. In my book,&quot;The Lives of the Holy Apostles&quot;is stated&quot;that the Apostle John wrote the Revelation&quot;&quot;, which&quot;text was given to him in what is now known as the Cave of the Apocalypse.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Patmos 

John of Patmos writes of the New or Heavenly Jerusalem, a&quot;shining city on a hill&quot;, the&quot;dwelling place of the Saints, interpreted as a physical reconstruction, spiritual restoration, or divine recreation of the city of Jerusalem.&quot;It is not a&quot;physical reconstruction&quot;of the&quot;old&quot;Jerusalem in Israel, but our restoration via Theosis to our original Blessed State, our Main Theme on this thread,&quot;the dwelling place of the Saints.&quot;

Old Jerusalem

&quot;The Golden Gate, as it is called in Christian literature, is the oldest of the current gates in Jerusalem&apos;s Old City Walls. According to Jewish tradition, the Shekhinah (Divine Presence) used to appear through this gate, and will appear again when the Messiah comes (Ezekiel 44:1-3) and a new gate replaces the present one; that is why Jews used to pray for mercy at the former gate at this location. Hence the name Sha&apos;ar Harachamim), the Gate of Mercy. In apocryphal texts, the gate was the scene of a meeting between the parents of Mary, so that Joachim and Anne Meeting at the golden gate became standard subjects in cycles depicting the Life of the Virgin. In Arabic, it is known as the Gate of Eternal Life.&quot; In ancient times the gate was known as the Beautiful Gate.&quot; 

I don&apos;t know what is meant by cycles depicting the Life of the Virgin, but the Arab designation is clear. There are two gates, the southern gates is the&quot;Gate of Mercy&quot;, and the northern gate is the&quot;Gate of Grace&quot;.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_(Jerusalem) 

The Parents of the Virgin Mary meet at the Golden Gate

&quot; Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate is a woodcut by the German painter Albrecht Drer, which depicts an embracing couple situated beneath an ornamental archway, surrounded by neighbours and fools.&quot;

Maybe the scene above them depicts New Jerusalem, or the Island Felsenburg.

An early and beautiful depiction of the Meeting of Joachim and Anne by Giotto di Bondone:

&quot;The work describes the story of the married couple Joachim and Anne, who though devoted to each other, were deeply unhappy as they were childless, which they take as a sign that they must have been rejected by God. An angel informs Anne of her conception, while at the same time asking her to meet her husband at the city gate in Jerusalem. On meeting, the couple entwined in joy. According to Chelidonius:&quot;Overjoyed Anne threw herself into the arms of her husband; together they rejoyced about the honour that was granted to them in the form of a child. For the knew from the heavenly messenger that the child would be a Queen, powerful (i)n heaven and on earth.&quot;In traditional depictions of the occasion, the pair embrace, but don&apos;t kiss.&quot;

New Jerusalem Monastery

The New Jerusalem Monastery, also knwon as the Voskresensky Monastery, is a male monastery, located in the town of Istra in Moscow Oblast, Russia.&quot;

The Monastery as a&quot;sacral place&quot;was founded by Patriarch Nikon in 1656, and took its name from the New Jerusalem. - In his time, Patriarch Nikon took in several monks of non-Russian origin to populate the monastery, for it was intended to represent the multinational Orthodoxy of Heavenly Jerusalem.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jerusalem_Monastery 

And as I wrote before:

&quot;In March 2009 Russian president Dmitry Medvedev signed a presidential degree on the restauration and renovation of the New Jerusalem Monastery. The federal government was instructed to subsidise the monastery restoration fund from the federal budget starting 2009, whith prime minister Victor Zubkov assuming it will cost about 13-20 billion roubles.&quot;

Our true potential and worth as human beings:

Jesus is the proto-type for all of humanity:&quot;The first-born among many brethren.&quot;(Romans 8:29) Jesus is the example of what he created each of us to be.

We were created,&quot;In the image and likeness of God,&quot;created to be &apos;Like&apos; God as far as possible. Adam was the proto-type of this God-like humanity until he fell, losing his original &apos;Likeness&apos; to God. For this reason, God himself became a man, thereby becoming the &apos;New Adam&apos;; raising up the image that had fallen.

The image of God is like a seed buried inside of us.We can either water, nourish and cultivate that seed until it grows into our own, unique, individual &apos;Likeness&apos; to God, which is our birthright; or, we can replace the image of God within us with other images and become like them instead.

In fact, this is exactly what has happened. The image of God within us has been replaced by other images(Romans 1;22-23). Fortunately, this process is reversible. The Orthodox way of life is a course of therapy which, if applied, uncovers the image of God within ourselves and brings it back out to the surface where it belongs.

&quot;Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.&quot;(Phillipians 3:13-14)

&quot;But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.&quot;(2nd Corinthians 3:18)

This is the way of perfection I hope for each of us! Re: The Secret of the Universe

 HYMN OF PRAISE 

 THE CITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE 

 Constantinople, wondrous city near the Bosphorus blue,

With your glory, whose glory can be measured?

You were an awesome battleground of spiritual warriors,

Blasphemous heretics and saints of God.

And through a sieve you sifted throughout the centuries long

And declared apostates and servants of God.

By many sins you are soiled, and by filth of sinners,

You are concecrated with the abundance of the blood of martyrs.

Who could enumerate the spiritual heroes,

And all heavenly visions and your mysteries, all?

The angels of God often swooped down upon you,

And men, as angels, to heaven were raised.

The mother of God, many times, within you appeared,

To deliver those in danger, the sick to heal.

The flock of wonderful saints, over you, hover

And the prayers of your children, to the Most High, bear.

O, how many saints were your children!

As many as there are lilies next to lilies and saints next to saints!

History and calendar, in red, you wrote,

By your effort even the great Symbol [The Creed] was written.

And about you, in such a way, this could be said:

Among the many cities, a red letter you are.

With Holy Faith, you enlighten the universe

From paganism and heresies, the world you healed.

Tortured much, but not slain, you have not yet passed.

That is why we all celebrate you! Confessor, that you are!

Throughout the earth and in the heavens, your glory echoes;

Everyone baptized, a great graditude owes you. 


Throughout the earth with splenderous images of Heaven

The Byzantine Empire was founded in 324, Constantinople its Capital.&quot;Justinian I, who assumed the throne in 527, oversaw a period of recovery of former territories.&quot;

Justinian I in Ravenna, Italy

&quot;The Church of San Vitale - styled an&quot;ecclesiastical basilica&quot;in the Roman Catholic Church, though it is not of architectual basilica form - is the church in Ravenna, Italy, one of the most important examples of Byzantine Art and architecture in western Europe.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_San_Vitale 

History

&quot;The Church of San Vitale dates from the early sixth century. Construction began in 526 when Orthodox Bishop Ecclesius was bishop of Ravenna. The church was completed in 548. While Giulianus (Julius) Argentarus, who may have been a banker, is believed to have financed construction of San Vitale, it is believed the Emperor Justian was also deeply involved. The church was built during the era when the emperor controlled much of Italy that previously had been conquered by the Visgoths.&quot;

And

 http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/ravenna-san-vitale 


North-west of Ravenna is Lake Como, where My Sister I and Husband, two couples, their Friends, and your truly made Holiday.

Origins

&quot;The area around Lake Como was inhabited as early as the Bronze Age, starting with a major Celtic tribe, the Orobii. This group cultivatedthe dialect now known as Eastern Lombard, which is still spoken by some residents (#) in Italy&apos;s Eastern Lombardy region. Orobii artifacts have been found in hills surrounding Como, and pieces of their ancient settlements remain.&quot;

The comedy and tragedy of Pliny the Younger

&quot;The most famous sons of Como (then known as Novum Comum) were the two Pliny&apos;s, both born there. Pliny the Elder, author of the celbrated Natural History in 37 books; and his nephew, Pliny the Younger, a Latin prose author&quot;, had two villas on Lake Como called&quot;Comedy&quot;and&quot;Tragedy&quot;. 

The Master Builders of Lake Como

&quot;The Comacine Masters were the shining pride of the whole old Como diocese and were mentioned as far back as the 7th century.&quot;

Mr. Hall once gave a lecture on the Comacine Builders, who were called upon by European Royalty, maybe Pope&apos;s, can&apos;t remember, Bishops, and Persons of means to build according to their wishes. The Builders, among them Monks versed in the Art of building, not uncommon, as were the Four Saints who were also Masons, mentioned to Don on the Egyptian Forum&quot;Fulfilling a Promise&quot;. The Comacine were free and independent, came by invitation only, swore no allegiance to their Hosts, and a binding Contract was drawn up providing for the&quot;Social Security&quot;of their Families in case of accidents before any project was began. If the agreements were violated, the Builders departed.

JESTOR

&quot;The first historical record of the activity of the Comacine Masons is in the edict of King Rotharis, dated 22 November A.D. 643, brought to light by archaeologist Muratori. There is a clause in the edict (Art.144) relating to the conditions for compensation and liability to accidents in building under the erection by the members of the guild.&quot;

The first Art and Craft Guilds were abolished in the Dark Ages, but some survived in Constantinople and Rome. Mainly they remained in the Lombard region in Northern Italy. Beside Architecture, the Comacine Guild were skilled in the&quot;Civil Arts&quot;of sculpture, painting, mosaic work, and wood carving, and versed in Literature and Music.

&quot;In the darkness which extended over all Italy, only one small lamp remained alight, making a bright spark in the vast Italian necropolis. It was from the Magistri Comacini. Their respective names are unknown, their individual works unspecialized, but the breath of their spirit might be felt all through those centuries, and their names collectively is legion. We may safely say that of all their works of art between A.A. 800 and 1000, the greater and better part are due to that brotherhood - always faithful and often secret - the Magistri Comacini. The authority and judgment of learned men justify the assertion.&quot;

METAMORPHOSIS or, Why bother with having a spiritual life?

Why go through all the trouble of having a spiritual life? Why not just live life to the best of our ability and try to get as much enjoyment out of life as it is as we possibly can? God has given us the perfect analogy in nature in the life of a caterpillar. The caterpillar doesn&apos;t live for it&apos;s life as a caterpillar alone. It&apos;s whole life is geared towards a point where it does the hard work of spinning for itself a cocoon and entering into the (seeming) inactivity,( which is actually an intense other kind of activity,) which results in it&apos;s emergence as a butterfly into another kind of life with all new powers, abilities and a beauty all it&apos;s own.

It is the same for us as far as living a spiritual life goes. It seems like a lot of hard work which isn&apos;t as much fun as our usual life in the world. The results, however are our &apos;Likeness&apos; to God, Paradise and The Kingdom of Heaven.

It&apos;s not bad, necessarily, to live life as a caterpillar. It&apos;s just not good enough for a creature that&apos;s meant to be a butterfly!

Powers unseen and unknown are the fountains of life:
no animal but kenneth that sunlight is warm;
no dog but shifteth posture with the shifting shade
sreasonably as we: but man maketh a dail for it
to measur his day, and by his abstract intellect
Hath taken it for the ource and very cause of life
then by science unraveling its physical rays
he hath separated some, and found some properties;
but of the whole he knoweth that his analysis
hath not approach&apos;d the secret of their living power.
Nor hath man ever a doubt that mere objects of sense
affect his mental states, not that the mind in turn
promoteth the action and function of his animal life
in its organs and bones. The Greek astronomer,
gazing with naked eye into the starry night,
forgot his science and, in transport of spirit,
his mortal lot. Then seem&apos;d it to him as if his feet
touch&apos;d earth no longer: (Greek letter)
said he, in the tresur&apos;d words that keep his joy from death.

Now this imagination of awe and ecstasy,
being proper and common in Man, and where lacking or dull
so ready to suggestion, it seemeth as tho&apos; the eye
had some spiritual visionas if the idea of Space
and also of God existed in the midnight skies;
and thus men came to think that their corporeal sense
ecounter&apos;d reality in the appearance of things;
and, stirr&apos;d by influences that outreaching Reason
kindled unknown desires, their awed souls fell to prayer
that the great Maker of All would reveal his Being.

If so be then that Reason, our teacher in all the schools
oweth to existences beyond its grasp, whereon
its richer faculties depend, and that those powers
are ever present influencing the unconscious mind
in its native function to inspire the Will, &apos;twould seem
that as the waken&apos;d mind fashion&apos;d to&apos;ard the intellect
so the dark workings of his animal instincts
faced in a new perspectiv to&apos;ard spiritual sight;
and thus man&apos;s trouble came of their divergency
For spiritual perception vague and uncontroll&apos;d
being independent of the abstract intelligence,
he is disconcerted twixt their rival promises&apos;
and, doubtful of his road, he wavereth following
now one now the other: and thus I stand where I conclude
that man&apos;s tru wisdom were a reason&apos;d harmony
and correlation of these divers faculties:
this wer the bridge which all men who can see the abyss
hav reasonably and instinctivly desired to build;
and all their sacraments and mysteries whatsoe&apos;er
attemt to bild it ; from devout Pythagoras
to th&apos; last psychologistof Nancy or of Vienna.

Saint Chrysostom affirms &apos;this is the place of the great work-the only place where that work can take place&apos;, in saying:

&quot;When works of faith are lacking, the name of a Christian does not benefit us...hasten, oh Christian, with repentence and conversion to the exit of the soul...because on earth repentence has its power.&quot;

I hope everyone had a good weekend. Mine was beneficial and interesting.

On my way to the Vesper, Saturday, turning on the car engine and with it the radia, a women&apos;s voice sang,&quot;all the Saints sit down to be blessed and I&apos;m going to see the Lord&quot;brought a smile to my face.

Sunday was a glorious a day as they come in greater Los Angeles. In the sun-bathed parking lot at St. Steven&apos;s I met a Lady and we marveled at the scenery, and agreed how fortunate we are to live in&quot;Paradise&quot;as we call parts of SoCal, and the Lady went her way.

I had seen Fr. Ceko walking slowly toward the Church and we both walked up the stairs, bowing a Good Morning. We paused and Fr. Ceko said that His wife had asked Him to call me, but that He hadn&apos;t had time, but will soon, or, perhaps if I stay for awhile after lunch we could meet. I bowed deeply, not only as in&quot;Thank You&quot;, but because it was both, a&quot;bright moment&quot;in clear sunshine and light and easy atmosphere as we stood in direct eye-contact with a happy smile for a second or two, uplifted.

It was the Fourth Sunday of Great Lent, of Saint John of the Ladder, Climacus. As Fr. Ceko mentined St. Climacus and the Divine Ladder of Ascent, I felt like raising my hand as if in school. &apos;yes, I know about it&apos;. Father Ceko then commented on a few steps.

 http://staoc.ca/ladder.html 

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Sunday_of_St._John_Climacus 

In the Holy Gospel reading from St. Mark and St. Matthew, there was a man whose son had a mute spirit, which, when it seized him threw him down and he foamed from the mouth, gnashed his teeth and became rigid. The disciples could not cast the spirit out and the Man came to Jesus and asked for compassion and help.&quot;Jesus said unto him,&quot;is you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.&quot;Immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears,&quot;Lord I believe; help my unbelieve!&quot;

Not our belief, but our&quot;unbelieve&quot;we need help with, Fr. Ceko emphasized. It is up to us to&quot;redeem the time&quot;.

&quot;Therefore He says:&quot;Awake, you who sleep. Arise from the dead, And Christ will give you light.&quot;See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.&quot;

Reminds me of Mr. Hall saying that we can take any wrong, transform it by inner integrity and give out the right.

I sat with my Friend J. again waiting for for lunch, and during the hour, frequently interrupted by some one asking or telling Her something, I learned where the Lady was born, how She grew up, where and how She met her husband, her children and the whole family.&quot;I&apos;m hyper&quot;, She joked, talking a blue streak.

The German Lady I. came over several times to invite me to sit with them, but I felt as if deserting my Friend who is always&quot;worried&quot;where I am making some remark to which the German Lady replied:&quot;I know, I feel like I have known her all my life&quot;, and my ears perked up.&quot;Well, you&apos;re both both German&quot;, said an other Lady, but that wasn&apos;t the reason, wasn&apos;t the vibration I got, though I felt no kinship. Lady I. came over a fourth time to give me her phone number with a sort of polite urgency to call. Now I am curious, the only thing that struck me about Lady I. when first introduced was the shape of Her face.

Lastly, outside, Papadia Sandra was happy as the sunshine mingling with people and gave me a hug, asking if Her husband had called me yet, so I&apos;m glad to be at least on the radar screen now.

Wishing everyone a good week

Fifth week of Great Lent

The Ladder of Divine Ascent

Post by charlotte on Mar 16, 2010, 9:55am

You posted the Icon of the Divine Ascent Ladder quite some time ago, and when I happened on Saint Climacus I wrote out the 30 steps in December. Since there are 5 more days to the Fifth Sunday of Great Lent, I&apos;ll post 6 steps each day for people who haven&apos;t been here at the time, if interested, and to refresh my memory as well. I suppose that was the point besides, amazing what has transpired since this thread began February 16, 09.

St. John Climacus on the&quot;spiritual struggle needed for entrance into God&apos;s Kingdom.&quot;

Step 1: Renunciation

&quot;But to secure a rocklike foundation, those with a mind for the religious life will turn away from everything, will despise everything, will ridicule everything, will shake off everything, Innocence, abstinence, temperance - these make a fine thrice-firm foundation.&quot;

Step 2: Detachment

&quot;No one can enter crowned into the heavenly bridechamber without first making the three renunciations. He has to turn away from worldly concerns, from men, from family; he must cut selfishness away; and thirdly, he must rebuff the vanity that follows obedience.&quot;

Step 3: Exile

&quot;Exile is seperation from everything, in order that one may hold on totally to God...Exile is a disciplined heart, unheralded wisdom, a hidden life . . . unseen meditation, the striving to be humble, a wish for poverty, the longing for what is divine.&quot;

Step 4: On Blessed and Ever Memorable Obedience

&quot;Obedience is unquestioning movement, voluntary death, a life free of curiosity, carefree danger, unprepared defence before God, fearlessness of death, a safe voyage, a sleepers progress.&quot;

Step 5: Repentance

&quot;Repentance is the voluntary endurance of all afflictionss. A penitent is the inflictor of his own punishment.&quot;

Step 6: On Remembrance of Death

&quot;It is im possible, someone says, impossible to spend the present day devoutly unless we regard it as the last day of our whole life.&quot;

I have not even nearly accomplished any of these steps.


Commemorated to day is the

Martyr Eutropius of Amasea

&quot;The Holy Martyrs Eutropius, Cleonicus and Basilicus suffered in the city of Pontine Amasea (Asia Minor) in about the year 308. The brothers Eutropius and Cleonicus, and Basilicus, the nephew of the Great martyr Theodore the Recruit, were comrades. After the martyric death of St. Theodore, they wound up in prison and by their preaching brought many of the pagan in prison with them to the Christian Faith.

The Saints were tortured under the Rulers Publius and Asclepiodotus of Amasea. Saint Eutropius and Cleonicus were crucified, and Saint Basilicus was beheaded.

 http://molonlabe70.blogspot.com/2008/03/martyr-eutropius-of-amasea.html 

The Prologue from Ohrid

The reproach of the Anointed One [Christ] &quot;is that which the men of this world with a powerful stench of the earth, are ashamed in Christ. That is Christ&apos;s poverty on earth, His fasting, His vigil, His prayer, His wandering without a roof over His head, His condemnation, His humiliation, and His shameful death. This&quot; reproach of the Anointed One Christ &quot;was valued by the apostles, and after them, by countless saints, who thought this to be of greater wealth than all the riches in the entire world. Following these indignities, the Lord resurrected and opened the gates of heaven and revealed the Promised Land of Paradise, into which He led mankind along the path of His reproach or the wilderness of His suffering.

O Lord, glorified and resurrected, help us that we may hold unwaveringly every drop of Your sweat and Your blood as a treasure greater than all worldly riches.

Fr. Seraphim (Rose) of Platina

&quot;We are told by the Holy Fathers that we are supposed to see in everything something for our salvation. If you can do this, you can be saved.&quot;

&quot;Reason is an upstart&quot;, Fern had it, implying the same as Fr. Seraphim. At times, when my Mind is raised my heart easily negates reasoning, but I don&apos;t go off the deep end, only higher.

&quot;The one thing that can save us is simplicity&quot;, indeed, as I noted several times the deliberate, easy and simple mode of Orthodox Authors, and I readily admit,&quot;Well, I guess I don&apos;t know much&quot;, comparatively, I think there is even a song about it, but I didn&apos;t have time to look for it.

But today is Saint Patrick&apos;s Day and as they say here,&quot;Everyone is Irish. I purchased a potted Shamrock thinking of Paul Mc.

&quot;Our father among the saints Patrick of Ireland, Bishop of Armagh and Enlightener of Ireland, was born in Briton. Captured and brought to ireland as a slave, bringing Christianity to its people. His feast day is March 17.

&quot;Saint Patrick was born around 390 (likely in 387), at Kilpatrick, near Dumbarton, in Scotland. His name is from the Latin Patricius, meaning high-born. His parents were part of the Christian minority of Britain, his father, Calpurnius, was a deacon,&quot;the son of Potitus, a priest, of the village Bannavem Taburni.

&quot;Saint patrick is most often recognized for likening the Trinity to a shamrock, illustrating that the shamrock has three parts, and yet is one; in similar way, the Trinity has three persons, and is still one.&quot;

Literature on St. Patrick is plentiful, best know, perhaps, that the Saint banished snakes from Ireland, Dr. Hoeller&apos;s&quot;Patrick the Snake Chaser&quot;. However,&quot;evidence suggest that post-glacial Ireland never had snakes; one suggestion is the snakes referred to the serpent symbolism of the Druids of that time and place, as shown for instance on coins minted in Gaul (see carnutes), or that it could have referred to beliefs such as Pelagianism, symbolised as&quot;serpents&quot;. The Druids are usually seen as Pagans, but my understanding of the Druids is not of the conventionally accepted norm. I like the Druids.

Speaking of rabbits, from the

Archives of&quot;Milk and Honey&quot;

Fr. Seraphim (Rose) of Platina

 An analogy from the sayings of the Fathers. 

&quot;Abba Hilarion [founder of Palestinian Monasticism] was asked,&quot;How it be right for a diligent brother no to be offended when he sees other monks returning to the world?&quot;The old man said,&quot;Let me tell you a story. Consider the hunting dogs which chase after hares; imagine one of these dogs sees a hare in the distance and immediately gives chase, the other dogs that are with him see this dog taking off and take off after him, even though they have not seen the hare. They will continue running with him, but only for a time; when at lenght the effort and struggle exhaust them, they give up the chase and turn back. However the dog that saw the hare continues chasing it by himself. He does not allow the effort or the struggle to hinder him from completing his long course. He risks his life as he goes on, giving himself no rest. He does not allow the turning aside of the other dogs behind him to put him off. He goes on running until he has caught the hare he saw. He is careless both of the stumbling blocks in his path, whether stones or thornes, and of the wounds they have inflicted.

&quot;So also the brother who wishes to follow after the love of Christ must fix his gaze upon the cross until he catches up with him that was crucified upon it, even though he sees everyone else has begun to turn back.&quot;

(Budge, The Paradise of the Holy Fathers, 2.211)

Of course, having not seen the hare, it is hard to follow the one who has seen it, so Faith, say the Fathers, is indispensible.

&quot;Saint Theophanes Confessor (c. 758/760 - March 12, 817/818) was a member of the Byzantine aristocracy, who became a monk and chronicler.

&quot;Theophanes was born at Constantinople, of wealthy and noble iconodule parents: Isaac imperial governor of the islands of the Black Sea, and of Theodora, of whose family nothing is known. Isaac died when Theophanes was three years old, and the Byzantine emperor Constantine V Copronymus (740-775) subsequently saw to the boys education and upbringing at the imperial court; Theophanes would hold several offices under this patron.&quot;

Saint Isaac Cathedral in Saint Petersburg,&quot;is the largest cathedral (sobor) in the city and was the largest church in Russia when it was built in (101.5 meters high). It was dedicated to Saint Isaac of Dalmatia, a patron saint of Peter the Great who had been born on the feast day of the saint.&quot;

Exterior

&quot;The severe neoclassical exterior expresses the traditional Russian-Byzantine formula: a Greek-cross groundplan with a large central dome and four subsidiary domes. The design of the cathedral in general and the dome in particular later influenced the design of the United States Capitol in Washington D.C. and the Cathedral in Helsinki.

Step 7: On Mourning

&quot;Mourning which is according to God is a melancholy of the soul, a disposition of an anguished heart that passionately seeks that it thirsts for, and when it fails to attain it, persues it diligently and follows behind it lamenting bitterly.&quot;

Sunday 5 of Great Lent

Mary of Egypt

&quot;Our venerable mother Mary of Egypt was a desert ascetic who repented of a life of prostitution. She lived during the sixth century, and passed away in a remarkable manner in 522.&quot;

Saint Mary of Egypt is commemorated on the fifth Sunday in Great Lent.

&quot;She began her life as a young women who followed the passions of the body, running away from her parents at the age of twelve for Alexandria. There she lived as a harlot for seventeen years, refusing money from the men that she copulated with, instead living by begging and spinning flax.

&quot;One day, however, she met a group of young men heading toward the sea to sail to Jerusalem for the veneration of the Holy Cross. Mary went along for the ride, seducing the men as they traveled for the fun of it. But when the group reached Jerusalem and actually went toward the church, Mary was prohibited from entering by an unseen force. After three such attempts, she remained outside on the church patio, where she looked up and saw an icon of the Theotokos. She began to weep and prayed with all her might that the Theotokos might allow her to see the True Cross; afterwards, she promised, she would renounce her worldly desires and go wherever the Theotokos may lead her.&quot;

Mary went to the desert where she lived for 47 years in solitude. She met the Priest St. Zosima, whom she told her life&apos;s story and demonstrated her gift of clairvoyance. St. Mary asked Zosima to come back&quot;exactly a year later. When he did so, he found Mary&apos;s body with a message written on the sand asking him for burial&quot;, which St. Zosima did, a lion helping Him to dig the grave.

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Mary_of_Egypt 

Here is another version with Icons, and a mention of&quot;Ben Jonson&apos;s play Volpone, (1606) one of the characters the expression&quot;Mary Gip&quot;. Commentators have taken this to mean&quot;Mary of Egypt&quot;.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Egypt 

&quot;Robert Graves speculates in The White Goddess (1948) that Mary of Egypt can be identified with&quot;Mary Gypsy&quot;, a virgin with a blue robe and pearl necklace. Otherwise known as Marina, Marian or&quot;Maria Stellis&quot;. She is supposedly a remote descendant of Aphrodite, the love goddess from the sea.&quot;

Symbolically, here we have a ligature to the&quot;White Queen&quot;named Mirana from whom the&quot;Red Queen&quot;stole the ruling crown, in&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. There are many layers in stories of old on Human Nature, leading to understanding and scaling

The Ladder of Divine Ascent

Step 8: On Freedom From Anger and on Meekness

&quot;The first step toward the freedom from anger is to keep the lips silent when the heart is stirred; the next, to keep thoughts silent when the soul is upset; the last, to be totally calm when unclean winds are blowing.&quot;

Step 9: On Remembrance Of Wrongs

&quot;Some, for the sake of forgiveness, give themselves up to labor and struggles, but a man who is forgetful of wrongs excels them. If you forgive quickly, then you will be generously forgiven.

Step 10: On Slander or Calumny

&quot;He who wants to overcome the spirit of slander should not ascribe the blame to the person who falls, but to the demon who suggests it. For no one really wants to sin against God, even though we all sin without being forced to do so.

Step 11: On Silence and talkativeness

&quot;He who has become aware of his sins has controlled his tongue, but a talkative person has not yet come to know himself as he should.&quot;

Step 12: On Lying

&quot;A lie is the destruction of Love, and a false oath is a denial of God.&quot;

God loves us a great deal and only wants one thing for us-to restore us entirely to the original blessed state we enjoyed in Paradise before the fall and to prepare us to make a graceful transition into the indescribably more glorious life of the world to come. (Seems like two things, but the first is the means of accomplishing the other.)

God is always trying to push us, gently in that direction.y choice we make either takes us closer to what God intends for us or farther away from it, so EVERY choice is significant.

If we want it, God will help us to understand more clearly the direction in which He wants us to go; our conscience will be awakened.

If we really want it, God will take us by the hand and lead us around the many snares which the evil one sets in our path and away from the dead ends he would like to draw us into.

If we REALLY want it, God will become an eagle, clutch us in His talons, hold us close to His breast and fly with us directly into the Kingdom of Heaven.

It all depends on what we want.

There&apos;s a whole new kind of world a&apos;comin that we can prepare for and even, begin to enter into now, if we so desire...

Conscient Reason, the channel of man&apos;s spiritual joy,
hath such dominent function also in bodily feeling
that &apos;tis the measur of suffering in all animals,
in lower forms negligible, and in the lowest
pain can be felt no more than mid the dancing waves
a pleasure-boat feeleth the hand on her tiller
that keepeth-up her head to th&apos; wind and her sails full.
And of spiritual pain the most cometh again
thru&apos; Reason, whether of frailty or of imperfection:
Savagery hath the throes; and ah!in tender years
the mind of childhood knoweth torments of terror,
fears incommunicable, unconsolable,
vague shapes; tho&apos;oft the be the dread boding of truth,
against which man&apos;s full Reason at grips may wrestle in vain.
Yet for the gift of his virgin intelligence
a child is ever our nearest pictur of happiness:
&apos;tis a delight to look on him in tireless play
attentivly occupied with a world of wonders,
so rich in toys and playthings that naked Nature
wer enough without the marvelous inventary of man;
wherewith he toyeth no less, and learning soon the lore
of cypher and alphabet anon getteth to con
the fair scholarly comment that science hath penn&apos;d
glossing the mazy hieroglyph of Nature&apos;s book;
and as he ever drinketh of the living waters
his spirit is drawn into the stream and, as a drop
commingled therewith, taketh of birthright therein
as vast an heritage as his young body hath
in the immortal riches of mortality.

And now full light of heart he hath willingly pass&apos;d out
thru&apos; the sword-gates of Eden into the world beyond;
he will be child no more: in his revel of knowledge
all the world is his own: all the hope of mankind
is sharpen&apos;d to a spearpoint in his bright confidence,
as he rideth forth to do battle, a Chevalier
in the joyous travail of the everlasting dawn:
Ther is nought to compare then, truly nought to compare:
and wer not fortune fickle in her lovingkindness,
all wer well with a manfor his life is at flower,
nor had he any fear.
But since her favor is inscrutable and uncertain,
and of her multiplicity she troubleth not
at the interaction of diverse self-consequences,
ther will be blasting and blightings of hope and love,
and rude shocks that affray; yet to the enamour&apos;d soul
evil is irrelevant and will be brushed aside:
rather &apos;tis as with Art, wherein special beauty
springeth of obstacles that hav been overcome
and to graces transform&apos;d; so too the lover of life
will make obstractions serve, and from all resistance
gain strenght: his reconcilement with suffering is eased
by fellow-suffering, and in pride of his calling
good warriorship welcometh the challenge of death.

Post by charlotte on Mar 22, 2010, 10:33am

Yesterday, Father Ceko touched upon us being created in the image of God and our return to His Likeness. The gentle pushing in that direction which I once misnamed nudging, becomes in due time a &apos;being drawn toward&apos; without thinking about it, present, permiating the atmosphere.

Fr. Ceko made an analogy about the feeling of wanting to be near God as a child reaching for the hand of its Parent just to be close, not asking for something, at least not all the time, and speaking of Mary of Egypt, in traveling to Jerusalem She neither sought God nor forgiveness for Her sins, her only reason being to see the Holy Land.

Another appropriate song played on my way to the Vesper, and it was good being in Church, especially in the very beginning of the Matins when almost alone and the Church is a Grand Icon of Heaven in Architecture and All within It. Fr. Ceko served Matins and the Holy Liturgy, inspiring everyone with a strong voice and total Devotion.

The Reading was from the Epistle of the Holy Apostle Paul to the Galatians

Brethren, before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept by the faith which would afterward be revealed. Therefore the law was out tutor to bring us to Christ, that we may be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under tutor. For you are all childreen of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ&apos;s you are Abraham&apos;s seed, and heirs according to the promise.

&quot;Pascha is just around the corner&quot;, said Fr. Ceko. &apos;Tis the last week of Great Lent, next Saturday is&quot;Lazarus Saturday, marking the beginning of our journey with Christ to His Saving Passion. There will be Vespers at 6:00 PM on Friday and a Hierarchical Divine Liturgy on Saturday morning at 10:00 AM. At 6:00 PM, the Festal Vesper s of Palm Sunday with the blessings of the palms and procession around the Church will be served. After Vespers, join us for a wonderful Leneten Dinner to commemorate the beginning of Christ&apos;s Entrance into Jerusalem.&quot;

Then Palm Sunday, Matins, a Festal Liturgy, and in the evening Bridegroom Matins of Great and Holy Monday. So this will be my first time in partaking of the Festivities.

I spoke with Papadia Sandra, to call and make an appointment with Father Ceko.

Thank you. April 26th was my first visit to St. Steven&apos;s. Almost a year has passed, much has transpired, and I am finally in the Vestibule.

Saint Quadratus (Kodratos) is commemorated today. There are five Persons by that name, but I think it is

&quot;Saint Quadratus, Apostle of the Seventy preached the word of God at Athens and at Magnesia (eastern peninsula of Thessaly), and was Bishop of Athens. His biographer called him&quot;a morning star&quot;among the clouds of paganism. He converted many pagans to the true faith in Christ the Savior, and his preaching aroused the hatred of pagans. Once, an angry mob fell upon the saint to pelt him with stones. Preserved by God, St. Quadratus remained alive, and they threw him into prison, where he died of starvation. His holy body was buried in Magnesia.&quot;

 http://full-of-grace-and-truth.blogspot.....odratos-of.html 

Eusebius writes:

&quot;1 After Trajan had reigned for nineteen and a half years Aelius Adrian (117-138) became his successor in the empire. To him Quadratus addressed a discourse containing an apology for our religion, because certain wicked men had attempted to trouble the Christians. The work is still in the hands of a great many of the brethren, as also in our own, and furnishes clear proofs of the man&apos;s understanding and of his apostolic orthodox. 2 He himself reveals the early date at which he lived in the following words:&quot;But the works of our Savior were always present, for they were genuine:-those that were healed, and those that were raised from the dead, who were seen not only when they were healed and when they were raised, but were also always present; and not merely while the Savior was on earth, but also after his death, they were alive for quite a while, so that some of them lived even to our day.&quot;
Such then was Quadratus.

The Ladder of Divine Ascent

Step 13: On Despondency

&quot;Despondency is being languid in singing psalms, weak in prayer, like iron in service, resolute in manual labor, reliable in obedience.&quot;

Step 14: On That Clamorous Mistress, the Stomach

&quot;Stint your stomach and you will certainly lock your mouth, because the tongue is strenghtened by an abundance of food. Struggle with all your might against the stomach and restrain it with all sobriety. If you labor a little, the Lord will also soon work with you.&quot;

I love this last sentence and it is true.

Step 15: On Incorruptible Purity and Chastity

&quot;The good Lord shows His great care for us in that the shamelessness of the feminine sex is checked by shyness as with a sort of a bit. For if the women were to run after man, no flesh would be saved.&quot;

Step 16: On Love of Money, or Avarice

&quot;The collector (of money) is stirred by charity, but when the money is in, the grip tightens.&quot;

Step 17: On Permissiveness

&quot;The man who has tasted the things of heaven easily thinks nothing of what is below, but he who has had no taste of heaven finds pleasure in possessions.&quot;

Step 18: On Insensibility

&quot;He who has lost sensibility is a witless philosopher, a self-condemned commentator, a self-contradictory windbag, a blind man who teaches others to see.&quot;


One of the Coat of Arms on the walls of the Church is of

Montenegro

&quot;It represents the two-headed eagle in flight, of the House of Petrovic-Njegos, a symbol of Byzantine and ultimately Roman in origin.

&quot;The lion passant in the centre is a sign of episcopal authority and represents the Biblical theme of the Resurrection, or Christ Ruler of All Christos Pantocrator, the Lion of Judah.&quot;

In the article, the Orb the double-headed Eagle holds in its claw is called&quot;the imperial egg&quot;. Looks like the World Orb to me in the hand of Kings and Queens holding the Scepter in the right hand.

The House of Petrovic-Njegos

&quot; Petar II Petrovic-Njegos (Serbian Cyrillic ) was a Serbian Orthodox Prince-Bishop of Montenegro and a ruler who transformed Montenegro from a theocracy into a secular state. However, he is most famous as a poet and is considered by many to be among the greatest poets of the Serbian language. The first notable writer from Montenegro, his notable works include The Mountain Wreath, the Light of Microcosm, the Serbian Mirror, and False Tsar Stephen the Little.

The Serbs of Montenegro consider themselves successors of the Nemanja Dynasty of Saint Stephen the First Crowned.

Saint Sophronius of Jerusalem

&quot;Sophronius was born in Damascus, where he was well educated. But he thirsted for more spiritual wisdom. In the monastery of St Theodosius, John Moschus became his teacher; then together the visited the scetics of Egypt. They wrote down all the wise sayings they heard, and later puplished them in two books entitled The Spiritual Meadow. 

In Jerusalem, Saint Sophronius&quot;witnessed the return of the precious cross from Persia, which the Emperor Heraclius carried into the Holy City on his back.&quot;The Saint wrote the life of Saint Mary of Egypt.&quot;His scroll reads:&quot;Oh Gladsome Light of the Holy Glory of the Immortal Father&quot;, which is sung every Vesper at Saint Matthew Church.

Troparion (Tone 5)

O Father Sophronius, thou wast glorious in the splendour of sobriety, and didst reveal thy ineffable enlightenment from heaven through the radiance of thy words. For by thy life thou didst attain to wisdom and dost now confirm thy Church, as an illustrious Hierarch and intercessor for us with the Lord.

 http://www.comeandseeicons.com/s/ynk09.htm 

Saint Sophronius&quot;was the Patriarch of Jerusalem from 634 until his death. Before rising to the primacy of the see of Jerusalem, he was a monk and theologian who was the chief protagonist for orthodox teaching in the doctrinal controversy on the essential nature of Jesus and his volitional acts. Bishop Sophronius was of Arab descent.

&quot;A teacher of rhetoric, Sophronius became an ascetic in Egypt about 580 and entered the monastery of St. Theodosius near Bethlehem. Traveling to monastic centres in Asian Minor, Egypt, and Rome, he accompanied the Byzantine chronicler John Moschus.&quot;

The Saint&quot;composed a Florilegium (&quot;Anthology&quot;) of some 600 texts from the Greek Church Fathers in favor of the orthodox tenet of Dyothelitism (positing both human and divine wills of Christ). He warned&quot;of the Muslim-Arab advance on Palestine&quot;, and&quot;died soon after the fall of Jerusalem to the caliph Umar I in 637, but not before he had negotiated the recognition of civil and religious liberty for Christians in exchange for tribute - an agreement known as the Umari Treaty. The caliph himself came to Jerusalem, and met with the patriarch at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Sophronius invited Umar to pray there, but Umar declined, fearing to endanger the Church&apos;s status as a Christian temple.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre 

&quot;Besides polemies, Sophronius&apos; writings included an encomium on the Alexandrian martyrs Cyrus and John in graditude for an extraordinary cure of his failing vision. He also wrote 23 Anacreontic (classical metre) poems on such themes as the Arab siege of Jerusalem and on various liturgical celebrations.&quot;

The poems were arranged in such a way that&quot;the two poems describe a complete circuit throughout the most important sanctuaries of Jerusalem at the end of 6th century, descibed as the golden age of Christianity in the Holy Land.&quot;

Saint Herman of Alaska

&quot;The true Christian is a warrior making his way through the regiments of the invisible enemy to his heavenly homeland.&quot;

Step 19: On Sleep, Prayer, and Psalmody

With the Brotherhood

&quot;Just as over-drinking is a matter of habit, so too from habit comes over-sleeping. Therefore we must struggle with the quaestion of sleep, especially in the early days of obedience, because a long-standing habit is difficult to cure.&quot;

Step 20: On Bodily Vigil, and How to Use it to attain Spiritual Vigil, and How to Practice It

&quot;Some stand before earthly kings without weapons and without armor; but others hold staffs of office, or have shields, or swords. The former are vastly superior to the latter, for they are usually relations of the king and members of the royal household. So it is with earthly kings.&quot;

Step 21: On Unmanly and Puerile Cowardice

&quot;It is not darkness and desolateness of place that give the demons power against us, but barreness of soul. And through God&apos;s providence, this sometimes happens in order that we may learn by it.&quot;

Step 22: On the Many Forms of Vainglory

&quot;When you hear that your neighbor of friend has abused you behind your back or even to your face, then show love and praise him.&quot;

Step 23: On Mad Pride

&quot;When the demon of pride gets a foothold in his servants, he appears to them either in sleep or in a waking vision, as though in the form of a holy angel or some martyr, and gives them a revelation, of mysteries, or a free bestowal of spiritual gifts. . .&quot;

Step 24: On Meekness, Simplicity, and Guilessness

&quot;Meekness is an unchangeable state of mind, which remains the same in honor or dishoner.&quot;

Step 25: On Humility

&quot;Many have received salvation without prophesies and revelations, without signs and wonders; but without humility no one will enter the marriage chamber, because humility is the guardian of these gifts, and without her they bring frivolous people to ruin.&quot;

Reflection

&quot;For as long as you are on earth, consider yourself a guest in the Household of Christ. If you are at the table, it is He who treats you. If you breathe air, it is His air you breathe. If you bathe, it is in His water you are bathing. If you are traveling, it is over His land that you are traveling. If you are amassing goods, it is His goods you are amassing. If you are squandering, it is His goods that you are squandering. If you are powerful, it is by His permission that you are strong. If you are in the company of men, you and the others are His guests. If you are out in nature, you are in His garden. If you are alone, He is present. If you set out to turn anywhere, He sees you. If you do anything, He remembers. He is the most considerate Housholder by Whom you were ever hosted. Be careful then toward Him. In a good household, the guest is required to behave. These are all simple words but they convey to you a great truth. All the saints knew this truth and they governed their lives by it. That is why the Eternal Householder rewarded them with eternal life in heaven and glory on earth.&quot;

Sts. Sophia, Faith, Hope and Love the Martyrs of Rome

&quot;The Holy Martyrs Saint Sophia and her Daughters Faith, Hope and Love were born in Italy. The mother was a pious Christian widow who named her daughters for the three Christian virtues. Faith was twelve, Hope was ten, and Love was nine. St. Sophia raised them in the love of the Lord Jesus Christ. St. Sophia and her daughters did not hide their faith in Christ, but openly confessed it before everyone.

&quot;An official named Antiochus denounced them to the emperor Hadrian (117-138) who ordered that they be brought to Rome. Realizing that they would be taken before the emperor, the holy virgins prayed ferently to the Lord Jesus Christ , asking that He give them strenght not to fear torture and death.&quot;

[Brought before the emperor, these four held each other&apos;s hands &apos;like a woven wreath,&apos; humbly but steadfastly confessed their faith in Christ the Lord and refused to offer sacrifices to the pagan idol Artemis. Before their suffering, the mother encouraged her daughters to endure to the end: &apos;Your heavenly Bridegroom, jesus Christ, is eternal health, inexpressible beauty and eternal life. When your bodies are slain by torture, He will clothe you in incorruption and the wounds on your bodies will shine in the heavens as stars.&quot;

 http://www.kosovo.net/edecani.html 

&quot;The name Sophia means&quot;wisdom&quot;in Greek; as for her daughters&apos; names, Faith, Hope, and Love (Charity), they are Pistis, Elpis, and Agape in Greek, and Vera, Nadezhda, and Lyubov in Russian.&quot;

 The Holy Martyrs Vera, Nada and Lyubov, and their Mother, Sophia 

 Sophia, all-wise, glorified the Lord;
As a sacrifice to Him, she offered three most beautiful daughters.
Th her daughters she said:&quot;Be not afraid, my daughters;
Strenghten yourselves in Christ, endure in the Faith;
And be not afraid of torture or bitter misfortunes.
Do not grieve over your bodies-it is better in heaven:
God will give you wonderful bodies in heaven.
Do not grieve over your beauty-with divine beauty
You will shine among the angels in the Kingdom of God,
As the daughters of the King of kings!
Do not grieve over life-what is this earthly life worth?
Its span is at most a hundred years.
In heaven, life without end awaits you:
Life without end, life without beginning.
Do not grieve for the company of earthly friends,
For the company of wonderful saints awaits you there.
Nor should the company of worldly kinsmen cause you grief-
For your kin in the heavens are the glorious martyrs.&quot;
As, one by one, they flew off to heaven:
Three white doves, innocent and pure,
Flew swiftly to the bosom of Christ.
And with her soul uplifted, their mother flew after them,
And joyned her glorious daughters in Paradise;
And our merciful God receives their prayers.

Lazarus Saturday

Protopresbyter Alexander Schmemann

&quot;The joy that permiates and enlightens the service of Lazarus Saturday stresses one major theme: the forthcoming victory of Christ over Hades.&quot;Hades&quot;is the Biblical term for Death and its universal power, for inescapable darkness that swallows all life and with its shadow poisons the whole world. But now with Lazarus&apos; resurrection&quot;death begins to tremble.&quot;A decisive dual between Life and Death begins giving us the key to the entire liturgical mystery of Pascha. Already in the fourth century Lazarus&apos; Saturday was called the&quot;announcement of Pascha.&quot;For, indeed, it announces and anticipates the wonderful light and peace of the next The Great Saturday, the day of life-giving Tomb.&quot;

 http://www.schmemann.org/byhim/lazarussaturday.html 

&quot;Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday together hold a unique position in the church year, as days of joy and triumph interposed between the penitence of Great Lent and the morning of Holy Week.

&quot;During the preceding week, which is the last week of Great Lent, the hymns in the Lenten Triodion track the sickness and then the death of Lazarus, and Christ&apos;s journey from beyond Jordan to Bethany. This week is referred to as the&quot;Week of Palms&quot;or the&quot;Flowery Week.&quot;

&quot;The position of Lazarus Saturday is perfectly summed up in the first sticheron chanted at Vespers on Friday evening:

 Having completed the fourty days that bring profit to our soul, we beseech Thee in Thy love for man:
Grant us also to behold the Holy Week of Thy Passion, that in it we may glorify Thy mighty acts and Thine ineffable dispensation for our sakes, singing with one mind: O Lord, glory to Thee. 

&quot;The scripture reading and hymns for Lazarus Saturday focus on the resurrection of Lazarus as a foreshadowing of the Resurrection of Christ, and a promise of General Resurrection. The Gospel narrative is interpreted in the hymns as illustrating the two natures of Christ: his humanity in asking,&quot;Where have ye laid him?&quot;, and his divinity by commanding Lazarus to come forth from the dead.&quot;

On Lazarus Saturday, the Vestment of the Clergy is usually green symbolizing rebirth. The next link I poste before.

Fulfillment of prophecies

&quot;Because of the resurrection of Lazarus from his four-day-long death, Christ was hailed as the long-expected messiah, King of Israel.

In fulfillment of the prophecies of the Old Testament, he entered Jerusalem, the city of kings, riding on a colt of an ass. Crowds greeted him. They had branches braches in their hands and called out to him with shouts of praise: Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! The Son of David! The King of Israel! Because of this glorification by the people, the priests and scribes were finally driven to destroy him, to put him to death (Luke 19:47; John 11:53, 12:10).

Hymns

Troparion (Tone 1)

By raising Lazarus from the dead before Your passion,
You did confirm the universal Resurrection, O Christ God!
Like the children with the palms of victory,
We cry out to you, O Vanquisher of death;
Hosanna in the Highest!
Blessed is He that comes in the Name of the Lord!

Kontakion (Tone 2)

Christ the Joy, the Truth and the Light of all,
The Life of the World and the Resurrection
Has appeared in His goodness to those on earth,
He has become the Image of our Resurrection,
Granting divine forgiveness to all!

It was this Icon on the Table at the Festal Lunch after the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy, served by His Grace, Bishop Maxim. The hour was festive and sacred. With the Blessed Bread we received a perfectly fashioned cross, probably of compressed Palm leaf&apos;s as it was very light, which I hung on the rear view mirror of Helena II.

Lunch was especially festive, Flowers, Red Roses complimented by white sprays on each Table, the place-settings as in a fine Hotel. I was surprized. After the Table with Lenten Bread was censed and a prayer for all the good food, a Church Member walked about with a tray of beautifully cut, sparkling crystal&quot;Stamperl&quot;glasses containing Pear Schnapps for the taking, so I.... husband the Serb I mentioned last, and I toasted to Good Health to All at the table. His Grace served Red and White Wine, everyone chatted with Him serbishly but I could make out red or white Wine and said &apos;red please&apos;.&quot;Red?&quot;His Grace smiled, and I must say, President Obama eat your Heart out. The Serbian Ladies sure know how to prepare the best meals, and Bishop Maxim&apos;s Mother served Desert Cake, Her own. After about an hour everyone had a gentle glow about them, so as You said long time ago, viz., Orthodox Christians are not a bunch of robots but diverse Individuals, in Dress also, at least here in SoCal, from Jeans with chains to mini skirts, boots and high heels, bare arms and low cut sweaters and dresses. No Judgment!

I had intended to partake, but missed the Festal Vespers in the evening, blessing of Palms and procession around the Church, for being so tired due to an exceedingly hard and busy week, and the Schnapps and Wine, though little of, didn&apos;t help.


Whence had Reason and Science
whence hath she fetch&apos;d her high authority, her right
of spiritual judgment? WHENCE COMETH WISDOM?

But I was anger&apos;d with myself to hav said this thing,
seeing that my thought had wander&apos;d; for Reason reply&apos;d
&quot;This question is wrongly ask&apos;d. Who is it that putteth
&quot;this question into my mouth, and biddeth me to answer him?
&quot;I who hav never doubted of my authority,
&quot;who am the consciousness of things judging themselves
&quot;Hav I not learn&apos;d that Selfhood is fundamental
&quot;and universal in all individual Being;
&quot;and that thru&apos; Motherhood it came in animals
&quot;to altruistic feeling, and thence-after in men
&quot;rose to spiritual affection? What then am I 
&quot;in my conscience of self but very consciousness
&quot;of spiritual affection upgrown to life in me?
&quot;Truly inscrutable and dark is the Wisdom of God,
&quot;but no man cometh unto WISDOM but by me.&quot;

Then I was ashamed; but still my thought went harking back
on its old trail, whence Reason learn&apos;d its troublous task
to comprehend aright and wisely harmonise
the speechless intuition of the inconscient mind;
which, tho&apos; a naked babe (as men best pictured Christ)
is yet in some sort nearer to the Omniscient
than man&apos;s unperfect Reason, baulk&apos;d as thatt must be
by the self-puzzledom of introspection and doubt,
That dark mind with its potency is the stuff of life,
nature&apos;s immutable provision: in some maybe,
stagnent and poor, in some activ and rich, in each
a given unique quantum of personality,
a loan of so-much (as &apos;tis writ to one he gave
five talents, to another two and to another one );
a treasure that can be to good fortune assured
by Reason, its determinant and inexplicable
coefficient, that varieth also in power and worth.

Palm Sunday

Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!

Was sung throughout the Service yesterday. Again it was festive, everyone taking a willow and palm branch at the entrance to the Church, which Father Ceko blessed with Holy Water at the end of the Holy Liturgy, about ten drops reaching my face and hair.

Prayers, Song and Tone thereof were in part different but as always moving, the perpetual petitioning for Mercy, giving Thanks and Glory to God throughout, Fr. Ceko always inspiring and lifting the Congregation higher as the Service progresses and the Church filled with Love and Peace. Saturday and yesterday, names of a number of Saints I wrote about were cited and Their Prayer invoked on our behalf. In His Commentary, Father Ceko highlighted the word&quot;Awesome&quot;as youth are wont to call things marvelous, a fitting term for the universal regeneration of Humanity and Resurrection into a New Life.

The Reading was from the Holy Gospel of Saint John

&quot;At that time, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom He had raised from the dead. There they made Him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him. Then Mary took a pound of very costly oil of spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil. But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon&apos;s son, who would betray Him, said,&quot;Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?&quot;This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was in it. But Jesus said,&quot;Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial. For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always.&quot;

Saint John came to Ephesus in great honour,&quot;and all the people of Ephesus came against him singing and saying: Blessed be he that cometh in the name of our Lord.&quot;

&quot;Isidore, in the book of the life and death of holy saints and fathers, saith this: S. John the Evangelist transformed and turned rods of trees into fine gold, the stones and gravel of the sea into precious gems and ouches, the small broken pieces of gems he reformed into their first nature, he raised a widow from the dead, and brought again the soul a young man into his body, he drank venom without hurt or peril, and them that had been dead by the same he recovered into the state of life.&quot;

At Saturday&apos;s festive lunch sat with us an Architect designing Orthodox Churches and Cathedrals, and it was said that in Las Vegas, Nevada, there are plans to build an Orthodox Cathedral fashioned after the one in Constantinople, owing to many wealthy Greeks living there. How grand &apos;tis? An Oasis in&quot;Sin City&quot;, where my Sister and her Husband came over to be married, and which City once so turned me off that I drove from LA and back in one day. The only things worthwhile seeing is the Cirque du Soleil, and the powerful heavenward beam of Light emanating from the top of the Luxor Pyramid Hotel seen for miles in the desert night, generally all else is plastic including the Sphinx fronting the Hotel. I did win $5 or 700.00 once on a slot machine, presaged no less a day or two before, forgot exactly.

The Great and Holy Week

Throughout the week are Vespers, Matins, and Holy Liturgy&apos;, which I will attend as my work schedule allows. Also recognized familiar names on facebook.

&quot; Great and Holy Week is the week from the conclusion of Great Lent on the Saturday of Lazarus to the celebration of Pascha.&quot;

History

&quot;While little is recorded of the development of the celebrations of the Holy Week during the early years of the Church, it apparently had very early origins. By the fourth century the celebration of the week appears well-founded and to be similar to our celebration today. The pilgrim Egeria to Jerusalem in the latter part of the fourth century describes the events of the week after the services of the Saturday of Lazarus, ...&quot;began the week of Pasch, which they called here the Great Week&quot;, noting the procession commemorating Christ&apos;s triumphal entry into Jerusalem on the first day of the week. It is during this week that we remember Christ&apos;s Passion and Crucifixion.

&quot;Lazarus Saturday concludes Great lent. This celebration remembers Christ&apos;s raising of Lazarus from the dead and the promise of universal resurrection for all. Lazarus Saturday provides a bridge to Holy Week during which the Church services remember Christ&apos;s last week before his crucifixion and resurrection, his passion. During this week the Matins services for the upcoming day are celebrated the evening before, and Vespers is celebrated in the morning. This anticipation of the Church&apos;s services gives the faithful a sense that the world is in travail, upside-down, because of the passion our Lord endured for our salvation. Although this practice is unusual, it is canonical in accordance with the ancient definition that the day is from sunset to sunset.

&quot;The Matins services of the evenings of Palm Sunday, Holy Monday, and Holy Tuesday, anticipating the events of the next day, share a common theme. These Bridegroom Services are derived from the Parable of the Ten Virgins, which calls for preparedness at the Second Coming, for the&quot;thief comes in the middle of the night.&quot;(Matt. 26: 1-13)&quot;

Reading more, I recall the video of the&quot;Holy Fire&quot;which does not burn, wishing I could be in Jerusalem now.

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Holy_Week 


Commemorated today is

Alexios the Man of God

&quot;Our venerable and God-bearing Father Alexios the Man of God (also Alexis or Alexius;) was a fourth-century monastic who is known for his dedication to Christ in anonymity.&quot;

History

&quot;Many sources will set the story of Alexis in Rome to somewhere in the tenth century, around the time when Benedict VII gave a church dedicated to St. Boniface to a group of exiled Christians, who were under the leadership of the Metropolitan Sergius of Damascus. This church was renamed for Sts. Boniface and Alexis, and the relics of the Man of God were believed to be placed in this church by the West. The bones found in the thirteenth century are now not considered by the West to be those of either Boniface or Alexis. An epic poem of the eleventh century tells the legend of the saint; however, many scholars and the Eastern church believe that the Man of God lived and died in Edessa in the fifth century and the name&quot;Alexis&quot;is a Greek addition. He is also classed as one of the famous holy fools of Byzantium, along with Symeon the Fool-for Christ and Andrew of Constantinople.&quot;

After reposing at the Great Lavra Monastery on Mt. Athos,&quot;the honorable head&quot;of Saint Alexis was taken&quot;to Moscow and placed at the Novospasskiy monastery for public veneration.&quot;

The benfit of rest from Contemplation

Excerpt from the Life of Saint John the Evangelist, He of the Eagle

&quot;Cassiodorus saith that a man had given to S. John a partridge living, and he held it in his hand strocking and playing with it otherwhile for his recreation. And on a time a young man passed by with his fellowship and saw him play with his bird, which said to his fellows, laughing: See how the yonder old man playeth with a bird like a child. Which S. John knew anon, by the Holy Ghost, what he had said, and called the young man to him and demanded him what he held in his hand, and he said a bow. What dost thou withal? said S. John. And the young man said: We shoot birds and beasts therewith, to whom the apostle demanded how in what manner. Then the youg man bent his bow and held it in his hand bent, and when the apostle said no more to him he unbent his bow again. Then said the apostle to him: Why hast thou unbent thy bow? And he said: Because if it should be long bent it should be the weaker for to shoot with it. Then said the apostle, So son, it fareth by mankind and by frailty in contemplation, if it should always be bent it should be too weak, and therefor otherwhile it is expedient to have recreation. The eagle is the bird that flyeth highest, and most clearly beholded the sun, and yet by necessity of nature him behooveth to descend low, right so when mankind withdraweth him a little for contemplation, he after putteth himself higher by a renewed strenght, and he burneth then more fervently in heavenly things.&quot;

I watched only this part, Earth does not appeal to the Children of Nature, but one volunteers and must have been me as I landed on an &apos;island&apos; called La Palo Verde where money rules, beautiful nevertheless, al be it I love the natural green green grass of wide open spaces. Have to watch the other nine to see where&quot;they&quot;are going with this. Reminds me of a South American Tribe who came forth some years ago, for the last time, they said, to inform Humanity of their Purpose and what needs to be done. For now, I&apos;m looking at

Holy Wednesday

&quot;Within the past two centuries, Byzantine practice has developed to include the mystery of Holy Unction, which is celebrated on Holy Wednesday, commemorating Christ&apos;s anointing with myrrh. The service ends with the priest annointing the faithful with holy oil. Some jurisdictions outside the Byzantine world also include this practice, such as in some parts of the OCA.&quot;(Orthodox Church of America, as at St. Steven&apos;s).

&quot;The services appointed by the Typicon for the evening of the Holy Wednesday recall that on this day Judas betrayed Christ, which led to the tradition from Apostolic times of fasting on Wednesday throughout the year. It also focuses on the Mystical Supper, which is celebrated in the liturgy of the following day.&quot;


Cyril of Jerusalem crops up many times in the study of the Saints, Hagiagraphy, I think.

Cyril of Jerusalem

&quot;Our father among the saints Cyril of Jerusalem (315-386) was a distinguished theologian and archbishop of Jerusalem in the early Church. He is celebrated by the Orthodox Church on March 18, (on my Calendar today) and on May 7 for his role in the apparition of the cross over Jerusalem in 351.

&quot;Little is known of his life before he became bishop; the assignment of the year 315 for his birth rests on mere conjecture. He seems to have been ordained deacon by Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem about 335, and priest some ten years later by Maximus. Naturally inclined to peace and conciliation, he took at first a rather moderate position, distinctly averse from Arianism, but (like not a few of his undoubtedly orthodox contemporaries) by no means eager to accept the uncompromising term homoousios.&quot; 

Arianism states that Christ was created, not begotten, therefore secondary to the Father, or&quot;There was a time when the Son was not&quot;, whereas&quot;homoousios&quot;means of the&quot;same essence&quot;,&quot;same substance&quot;, which is the doctrine of the Church.

Because of His wavering of this doctrine, St. Cyril had difficulties with His Superiors and was exiled from Jerusalem several times, until the First Council of Constantinople in 381, at which He was present,&quot;he voted for acceptance of the term homoousios, having been finally convinced that there was no better way.&quot;

Why am I totally fascinated by the History of Serbia, Constantinople and Environs, and the Byzantine Empire?

Serbia in the Middle Ages

&quot;The medieval history of Serbia begins in the 5th century AD with the arrival of the Slavs in the Balcans, and ends with the occupation of Serbia by the Ottoman Empire in 1540 with the fall of the Serbian despotate.

&quot;According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, a Byzantine Emperor who ruled during the 10th century, the Serbs migrated from white Serbia and initially settled around the region of Thessaloniki, Greece. Not to their liking, they instead settled a region farther north, a large proportion of what had been the Roman province of Illyricum. On the Adriatic coast, the Serbs formed four coastal principalities known as Nerevta, Zahumlje, Konavly and Trebinje and Duklja. Inland (to the east of the Dinaric Alps) lay a large territory streching north as far as the Sava River, and included the region of Bosnia. It retained the old name of Serbia, often called Baptized Serbia by the Byzantines, because it was Christianized (unlike the still pagan White Serbs in northern Europe).&quot;

Early states

&quot;Upon the initial arrival, the Slavs formed no uniform political organization, but rather remained divided into many tribes of various sizes, referred to as Sklaviniai by the Byzantines. These groups were led by native chiefs. Perhaps the tribes were organized into zupa, a form of territorial organization learned from the native Illyrians, being roughly equivalent to a county. Each zupa consisted of several villages, linked by clan (i.e. extended family) relationships.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Medieval_Serbia 

But this is just linial history in terms of gaining territory, trade, and securing alliances. Last Church lunch, I tried, prudently, to engage the so friendly and talkative Serb into a conversation about Serbian History, but He had to go to play Chess at another table, so I&apos;ll try again because it would be nice to have part of it straight from the Horses mouth.

Not to mention the mind addling and tongue arresting names of Persons and Places. I tried several times but had the feeling that their History is Old Hat to the Serbs and my questions were annoying, but I&apos;m sure - I just have to happen on the right Person, if not, I can follow the references of Saints, Dynasties, and Geography in my Mind.

Yesterday was

 &quot;Holy Thursday begins with the celebration of vespers and the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil with a Reserved Eucharist in representation of the earthly presence of Christ realized at the Last Supper. In the evening, anticipating the Matins of Friday morning, the Holy Passion service of the reading of the Twelfe Gospels is conducted. In these readings Christ&apos;s last instructions to his disciples are presented, as well as the prophecy of the drama of the Cross, Christ&apos;s prayer, and his new commandment.&quot;

Different, the Icon of the Mystical Supper at a Round Table, we are so used to Leonardo&apos;s.

 Holy Friday 

 &quot;Great and Holy Friday begins with the reading of the Royal Hours leading up to Vespers of Friday afternoon, at which time the removal of the Body of Christ from the Cross is commemorated. The priest removes the Body of Christ, the Epitaphios, from the Cross, wraps it in white cloth and carries it to the altar. In the evening service, called the Lamentations at the Tomb, the priest carries the Epitaphios, the painted or embroidered cloth representation of Christ, from the altar around the church before placing it in the Sepulcher, a bier symbolizing the Tomb of Christ. This procession, with the faithful carrying lighted candles, represents Christ&apos;s descent into Hades.&quot;

 Holy Saturday 

 Great and Holy Saturday 

&quot;Vespers and a Divine Liturgy of St. Basil are served, marked with readings of Psalms and Resurrection hymns that tell of Christ&apos;s descent into Hades, celebrated as the&quot;First Resurrection&quot;of Adam and the conquering of Death. It is appointed by the typikon to be celebrated in the afternoon, though it is served in the morning in many places.

&quot;This service comes from the ancient liturgical tradition of the Church of Constantinople and was its primary Paschal service. The hymn&quot;Arise O God&quot;from the Psalms was the original primary Paschal hymn before&quot;Christ is risen&quot;came to take its place. Its place as the ancient Constantinopolitan Paschal celebration is what gives the service such a bright and resurrectional character.&quot;

What the Greeks do on Easter

&quot;Painting of red eggs&quot;
&quot;Preperation of sweets (Koulouria&quot;)

Reminding me of the festive Lunch two weeks ago when a Lady brought to each table Koliva in the form of a Cathedral, so delicious that I&apos;m sorry I ever mentioned mine.

On Easter Sunday,&quot;all over Greece, the Greek people will hold festive celebration. Traditionally, lambs are roasted (which symbolize Christ) and friends and family get together to eat, drink, talk and dance.

&quot;In some towns, this tradition is a community celebration. For example:

&quot;In Arachova, rows of lambs are roasted in the village square.
On some islands, the town shoots&quot;Judas&quot;.

Most remarkable and new to me:

&quot;The Holy Fire is flown from Jerusalem on Olympic Airways, accompanied by high-ranking Greek Orthodox priests and government officials to the Athens airport. The Holy Flame is met with a reception of honour guards and is taken to the small church of Agioi Anargyroi in the Plaka square&quot;.

Couldn&apos;t find a singular picture of the Church, here it is the 5th down in the middle.

Saint John the Evangelist

&quot;And he, dispurveyed, death cometh which taketh all from him, and beareth nothing with him save his proper sins. When S. John had said all this there was brought before him a young man dead, which only had been in marriage thirty days. And his mother and friends wept sore, which before S. John kneeled down on their knees, praying him that he would raise him to life. S. John had great pity, and when he had long wept he bade to loose and unbind the body and said: O Satheus, which wert blinded with fleshly love, soon thou hast lost thy soul, and because thou knewest not thy maker Jesu Christ, thou art fallen ignorantly into the leash of the right evil fiends, wherefore I wept and pray that thou mayst be releved from death to life, and show thou to these twain. Actius and Eugenius, what great glory they have lost and what pain they have deserved. Anon Satheus releved him in yielding thankings to S. John, and blamed much the two disciples in saying: I saw your two angels weep and the devils demene joy of your perdition, also I saw the realm of heaven made ready for you and full of all delights, and ye have follily gotten for you the place of hell, dark and tenebrous, full of dragons and of all pains, and therefore it behoveth you to pray to the apostle of God that he remise and bring you again to your salvation, like as he hath revived me goodly. And among all other pains, this Satheus reciteth these that be contained in two verses following:

&quot;Vermes et umbrae, flagellum, frigus et ignis, Dmonis aspectus, scelerum confusio, luctus.

&quot;that is to say: worms, darkness, scourges, cold, heat, sight of devil, confusion of sin, and wailing. Anon then these two men by right great repentance prayed to S. John that he would pray for them, to whom S. John answered that they should do penance thirthy days long, and pray to God that the rods of gold and the precious stones might return to their first proper natures. After these thirty days they came to S. John and said to him: Fair father, ye have always preached misericord and mercy, and commanded that one should pardon another his trepass, we be contrite and repentant of our sins and weep with our eyes for this evil wordly covetise, the which we have by them received, and therefore we pray you that ye have mercy on us. And S. John answered: Our Lord God when he made mention of the sinner he said, I will not the death of the sinner, but that he be converted to life, for great joy is in Heaven of a sinner repentant. And therefore know ye that he hath receiveth your repentance, go ye forth and bear the rods and stones thither where ye took them, for they be returned to their first nature. Thus received they the grace that they had lost, so that after they did great miracles in the name of our Lord Jesu Christ.

&quot;S. John wrote his gospels after the other Evangelists, the year after the ascension of our Lord sixty-six, after this that the venerable Bede saith. And when he was required and prayed of the bishops of the country of Ephesus to write them, S. John prayed also to them, that they should fast and pray in their dioceses three days for him to the end that he might truly write them. S. Jerome saith of this glorious apostle S. John, that, when he was old, so feeble and so unmighty that his desciples sustained and bare him in going to church, ans as of times he rested, he said to his disciples: Fair children, love ye together, and each of you love other. And then his disciples demanded why and wherefore he said to them so oft such words. He answered to them and said: Our Pord had so commanded, and whomsoever accomplished well this commandment it should suffice him for to be saved. And finally after that he had founded many churches and had ordained bishops and priests in them, and confirmed them by his predication in the christian faith, the year sixty-eight after the resurrection of Jesu Christ, for he was thirthy-one years old when our Lord was crucified, and lived after sixty-eight years, and thus was all his age ninety-nine years. Then came the Lord with his disciples to him and said: Come my friend to me, for it is time that thou come, eat and be fed at my table with thy brethren. The S. John arose up and said to our Lord Jesu Christ. that he had desired it long time, and began to go. Then said our Lord to him: On Sunday next coming thou shalt come to me.&quot;

HAPPY EASTER HOLIDAYS TO ONE AND ALL!

So musing all my days with unceasing wonder
and encountering many phases of many minds,
thru&apos; kindly environment of my dispostion
I grew, as all things grow, in the pattern of Self;
til stumbling early upon the mystic words, whereby
in the semetic metrix of my father&apos;s creed
Jahveh reveal&apos;d his secret Being to the Jews,
and conning those large letters I AM THAT I AM
I wonder&apos;d finding only my own thought of myself,
and reading there that man was made in God&apos;s image
knew not yet that God was made in the image of man;
nor the profounder truth that both these truths are one,
no quibbling scofffor surely as mind in man groweth
so with his manhood groweth his idea of God,
wider and ever worthier, untill it may contain
and reconcile in reason all wisdom passion and love,
and bring at last (may God so grant) Christ&apos;s peace on Earth.

Nor could it ever dwell in my possible thought
that whatsoever grew and groweth can be unlike
in cause and substance to the thing it groweth on:
Thus I saw Conscience as a natural flower-bud
on its vigorous plant specialized to a function
marvelously, a blossom first unique in design
of beauty, in colour and form, thickening therefrom to a fruit
productiv to infinit regeneration; and yet
this budas any primer of botany can teach
is but a differentiation of the infertile leaf,
which held all this miracle in intrinsic potence.

Thus science would teach, and Heraclitus, I say,
was not the least among the sages of Hellas,
Nor those fire-worshippers foolish, who, seeing the Sun
to be the efficient cause of all life upon earth,
welcomed his full effulgence for their symbol of God.
And since we observe in all existence four stages
Atomic, Organic, Sensuous, and Selfconscient
and must conceive these in gradation, it was no flaw
in Leibnitz to endow his monad-atoms with Mind:
tho&apos; in our schools of thought&quot;unconscious mind&quot;is call&apos;d
a contradiction in terms; as if the embranglements
of logic wer the prime condition of all Being,
the essence of things; and man in the toilsom journey
from conscious of nothing to conscient ignorance
mistook his tottery crutch for the main organ of life.

Paschal vision of electrical engineering:

God is Love. God is an unlimited supply of Light, Life and Love. Jesus is a transformer, stepping down the unlimited power of God into something we can handle without melting all the insulation off of our wires.

We are the wires, meant to conduct the love of God to a light bulb, (or even, an entire string of light bulbs...)

Depending upon what kind of metal is used for the wires determines the degree of resistance and capacity. Lead has the most resistance and the least capacity, while gold has the least resistance and the most capacity.

Our spiritual practice is both, a means of inducing the current of God&apos;s love and an alchemical process of transmuting the lead of our wiring into gold.

Allow me to emphasize the fact that God is about one hundred million watts while we, in our present, fallen condition, can barely handle the sixty watts or so it takes just to keep us alive...

Jesus, through his saving dispensation for us, meets us wherever we are at-60 watts, 50 watts, 25...and, in a co-operative relationship with us, raises us back up into the fullness of his presence and, subsequently, into the fullness of our true nature as sons and daughters of the living God.

Silver, the Holy Spirit, is the best Conducter, but&quot;Gold is used for high-quality surface to surface contacts&quot;, and as I quoted Saint John the Divine,&quot;Pray to God that the rods of gold and precious stones might return to their first proper nature&quot;.

I remember from last year

&quot;The Paschal greeting is a custom among Orthodox Christians, consisting of a greeting and response. Instead of&quot;hello&quot;or its equivalent, one is to greet another person with&quot;Christ is Risen!&quot;The response is&quot;Truly, He is Risen!&quot;(or&quot;Indeed, He is risen!&quot;) This greeting is used during liturgical services and informally at other times, starting with the feast of Pascha and lasting until Ascension, the period known as Paschaltide.&quot; 

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Paschal_greeting 

And so it was declared in Church by His Grace, Bishop Maxim, while censing the Congregation, Father Ceko in a profound and powerful Sermon:&quot;all Creation is aware that He is Risen&quot;, at the festive Banquet and Barbeque, and everywhere in the parking lot.

The Icon pictured and another were on Banners to each side of the Entrance of the Cathedral, standing room only, and that not enough for the hundreds of Faithful, cars parked almost to the freeway. I made the mistake of not reserving a seat, thought I could do it Sunday, and wandered about with my lunch looking for my Friends, but saw them not and sat on the wall eating and biding my time. A Band was playing Serbian Music, People everywhere but I didn&apos;t know a Soul, so I left. No matter, the Hierarchial Vesper was Divine and singing most beautiful.

This being the&quot;Bright Week&quot;or&quot;Renewal Week&quot;of the Byzantine Rites

I think Father Ceko will now have time for me. Been wanting to post this Icon of the&quot;Good Shepherd&quot;for some time. Ashfield is in Sydney, Australia. It doesn&apos;t work, but if you like to see a beautiful image, please type in

Good Shepherd stained glass window, Saint John, Ashfield, Australia

When I stand in the back of St. Steven&apos;s under the beautiful Baldachin and look toward the Altar, there, on the Iconostasis seperating the Nave from the Sanctuary, is a painting of a youthful Jesus, and a stained glass window in the middle of the Sanctuary of an&quot;elderly&quot;Jesus as God, and just so I have been looking from the painting of Jesus as&quot;a transformer&quot;to God in the Sanctuary ever since I attend Church.

I spent all morning in Russia and learned of the Land&apos;s Renaissance in tandem with the European, and more of the so uniquely spectacular Cathedrals and Churches of Russia.

Tomorrow is celebrated the Annunciation

A feast for the eye is the

 Cathedral of the Annunciation dedicated to the Theotokos, located in the Moscow Kremlin.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_the_Annunciation 

&quot;Formerly, the cathedral was a home church of the Muscovite tsars. Its abbot had been a personal confessor of the royal family until the early 20th century. The Cathedral of the Annuciation was built on the Sobornaya Square (Cathedral Square) by architects from Pskov in 1484-1489. It was erected on the spot of an older 14th century cathedral of the same name, which had been rebuilt in 1416. Initially, the Cathedral of the Annunciation had three cupolas (two of them built around 1572). It was surrounded by parvises from three sides. In 1562-1564, they built four single-cupola side chapels over the arched parvises. The north and west entrances from the parvise are decorated with whitestone portals of the 16th century. The fretwork is clearly influenced by the Italian Renaissance architecture. The bronze doors of the north and west portals are decorated with gold foil. The floor of the Cathedral of the Annunciation is made of Jasper, which was brought from a cathedral in Rostov Velikiy in the 16th century. The walls contain fragments of murals, painted by Theodosius (1508) and others (second half of the 16th, 17th and 19th centuries). The iconostasis includes icons of the 14th-17th centuries, including the ones painted by Andrei Rublev, Feofan Grek and Prokhor, and 19th century as well.&quot;

Please click on the&quot;Satellite photo&quot;for a magnificent view.

The Muscovite Tsars

The Grand Duchy of Moscow was a medieval Russian polity centered on Moscow between 1283 and 1547. The Grand Duchy of Moscow, as the state is known in Russian records, has been referred to by many Western sources as Muscovy. However, this term is also sometimes applied to the Tsardom of Russia. The Grand Dutchy of Moscow was the successor to the Principality of Moscow and the predecessor of the Tsardom of Russia.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy 

Yet another grand&quot;Church of Ascension&quot;and Estate of the&quot;grand princes of Muscovy&quot;, and great aerial view.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolomenskoye 

&quot; Kolomenskoye is a former royal estate situated several miles to the south-east of Moscow city-centre, on the ancient road leading to the town of Kolomna (hence the name). The scenic area which overlooks the stepp banks of the Moskva River became a part of Moscow in the 1960s.

&quot;Kolomenskoye village was first mentioned in the testament of Ivan Kalita (1339). As the time went by, the village was developed as a favorite country estate of the grand princes of Muscovy. The earliest extant structure is the exceptional Ascension church (1532), built in white stone to commemorate the long-awaited birth of an heir to the throne, the future Ivan the Terrible. Being the first stone church of tent-like variety, the uncanonical&quot;White Column&quot;(as it is sometimes referred to) marked a stunning rupture with the Byzantine tradition.&quot;

Looking at the&quot;White Column&quot;, and the name&quot;Ascension Church&quot;, what sense does that make to say that it was built to commemorate the long-awaited birth of an heir to the throne, Ivon the Terrible? Who wasn&apos;t&quot;terrible&quot;as we understand the word, after all, he commissioned Saint Basil Cathedral whose architects are unknown, but surely not to Ivan. Furthermore, leading credence that the&quot;White Column&quot;was not built for Ivan to ascend to the worldy throne, he was crowned at the Cathedral of Dormation, is the following information.

 The great palace and other structures 

&quot;On the other side of the ravine from Kolomenskoye may be seen the five-tented Church of St. John the Baptist, tentatively dated to 1547. Actually, the church&apos;s origin is enshrouded in mystery. Some say the masters were Italians, others assign it to Postnik Yakovlev, reputedly the author of Saint Basil&apos;s Cathedral on the Red Square. Whatever the truth may be, it is clear that the church represents a transitional stage between the Ascension church, described above, and the famous 8-tented cathedral on the Red Square.&quot;

A transitional stage, yes, but in a religious sense. Many times literal Historians have Cathedral and Churches built for some victory or another, ignoring the obvious religious aspects.

Acquaintance and Trade of the Muscovy Princes with England

&quot;The first expedition of the Company of Merchant Adventurers was led by Willboughby, who seems to have been chosen for his leadership skills and unfortunately had no prior nautical or navigational experience&quot;, so Richard Chancellor navigated toward Muscovy, a journey of over 6oo miles, Tsar Ivan invited the Gentleman to the Royal Court and a sea trading route was opened between the two Countries.

&quot;The Company of Merchant Adventurers renamed itself the Muscovy Company, served as&quot;an important diplomatic link between Muscovy and England, in 1556 Chancellor never made it back to England because he shipwrecked, wouldn&apos;t you know.&quot;Chancellor was succeeded as the main trader of the Muscovy Company by Anthony Jenkinson&quot;, who&quot;was asked by Czar Ivan to sound out Queen Elizabeth I of England as a marriage prospect&quot;, but our Queen was not one to be sounded out.

&quot;The Muscovy Company traces its roots to the Company of Adventurers to New Lands in full: &apos;Mystery and Company of Merchant Adventurers for the Discovery of Regions, Dominions, Islands, and Places unknown&apos;) founded in 1551 by Richard Chancellor, Sebastian Cabot and Sir Hugh Willoughby, who decided to look for the Northeast Passage to China.&quot;

So they say. I thought I had to squeeze this in for a bigger picture.

&quot;The Company continued in existence until the Russian Revolution of 1917. The company headquaters (called the Old English Yard), built during the reign of Ivan IV not far from the Moscow Kremlin, were visited by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994.&quot;

Though burning steady at a certain amperage, my light bulb brightens and dims but always connected to current. I spoke to the Secretary of the Church yesterday. He will send me appropriate material to study and make an appointment with Fr. Ceko, who is in New Your this week.

The Deesis painted by Andrey Rublev

External links 2, 3, the 4th with an article and miniature Icons, especially the Icon of Saint Rublev working in the Savior St. Andronic Monastery.

&quot;In Russian culture there are the summits that are beyond the control of&quot;the river of time&quot;and looking at which the nation can find the way of salvation even during the hardest time. During the Great Patriotic War Russian people were given back the great names of their heroic pastAlexander Nevsky and Dmitry Donsky, and together with them the name of Andrey Rublev. In 1934 for the first time a seperate edition of a creative work biography of a famous Russian icon-painter, prepared by Mikhail Vladimirovich Alpatov, was published. On December 10, 1947, for the 800th anniversary of Moscow, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR I .V. Stalin signed resolution No 3974 for the creation of the reserve of history and architecture named after the Russian painter Andrey Rublev in the Savior-St. Andronic monastery. But during Khrushchov&apos;s&quot;thaw&quot;the works on creating the museum-reserve were frozen&quot;and authorities&quot;on ancient Russian culture&quot;wrote an open letter published&quot;in the newspaper Pravda (No 300, October 26, 1956).

&quot;Soon a wide veneration of the saint-painter began, when his image of&quot;The Life-Giving Trinity&quot;became the symbol of Orthodoxy for the whole world and the zenith of Russian art. During several centuries in the depth of the Church, the decision to canonize Andrey Rublev among the saints of Radonezh was held. It is known that the Most holy Patriarch Alexis (died 1970), who belonged to the ancient noble family of Simansky, venerated Andrey Rublev as a saint. in the family of Simansky. St. Alexis the Thaumaturgist, Metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia, was also especially venerated, whose name was taken by the Most holy Patriarch Alexis at monastic taking the habit. In the Savior St. Andronic monastery in Moscow founded by St. Alexis, where St. Andrey Rublov worked and found the last earthly refuge, the ancestor of the Most holy Patriarch the Most Eminent Pachomiy (died 1789) lay, whose relics were gained 200 years after his death. Soon after the relics of the Most Eminent Pachomiy (Simansky) were gained on July 16, 1989, the ancient cathedral of the Savior-St. Andronic monastery was solemnly cocecrated, where the frescoes by Andrey Rublev survived. (&quot;A Spiritual Tradition of Saint Andrey Rublev&quot; Journal of the Moscow Patriarchy [Moscow, 1990] No 1. Pp. 39-40). A year before this memorable event in June 1988 after the glorification of nine Russian ascetics at the anniversary Council of the Russian Orthodox Church St. Andrey Rublev shone in the completeness of the Church evidence.&quot;

&quot;The Bright and Renewal Week&quot;

Following yesterday&apos;s&quot;Annunciation&quot;

&quot;The Synaxis of Archangel Gabriel&quot;

Synaxis means&quot;gathering together&quot;, and the&quot;Supreme Commander of the bodiless Hosts&quot;is indeed&quot;associated with numerous happenings in Holy Scriptures, particularely his revelation to the Theotokos that she should bear Christ. This his primary role has been called one of announcing the salvation of manking.&quot;

There are many and various profound paintings of the Annunciation to the Mother of God, Her countenance being one of listening intently to Gabriel as He informs and requests of Mary to be the God-bearer; a Byzantien Icon depicting Her as if she had to think about it; Botticelli has her hold the kneeling Gabriel at bay; a 14th century painting by Fr. Angelo where in surprise She seems to say,&quot;you mean me?&quot;, a 14th century painting by Martini, where she appears to reject the Annuncement and Gabriel looks surprised; in El Greco&apos;s painting the Theotokos feels unworthy; in Francesco Albani&apos;s rendering she looks to God asking&quot;why me?&quot;, and of obedient acceptance of Her Mission rendered by Esteban. The Church teaches that the Theotokos accepted Her Calling willingly.

Previously, we spoke of the Archangel Gabriel In December in connection with Christ&apos;s Nativity or Christmas. When one studies Orthodox Religion one finds that Orthodoxy, meaning&quot;Correctly Believing&quot;, (orthos=correct, dokea=I see, doxa=glory), is itself a&quot;Synaxis&quot;or synergetic axis of collaboration, cooperation, interaction, and convergence of teamwork of the Church, as one meets Apostles, Saints, Martyrs, the Holy Fathers, Hierarchs, Patriarchs, Bishops, Priests, Kings, Queens, Architects, Painters such as Rublev yesterday, and countless other Persons re-occurring in seamless connexion all contained as within a Net.

&quot;The name Gabriel comes from the Henrew meaning&quot;Man of God.&quot;It has alternately been translated&quot;God is mighty&quot;or&quot;the strenght/power of God. The Prolouge from Ohrid explains his name this way:&quot;Man-God. The Holy Fathers, in speaking about the Annunciation, interpret that an archangel with such a name was sent to signify who and what He would be like, who must be born of the All-Pure One. Therefore, He will be Man-God, mighty and powerful God. The Holy Fathers think that Gabriel has pre-eminence in the first and greatest order of heavenly powers, that is, the Seraphic Order, since the Seraphims stand closest to God. He is, therefore, one of the seven Seraphims, closest to God.&quot;

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Archangel_Gabriel 

In the Old Testament, Gabriel is&quot;mentioned by name in two visions of the Prophet Daniel (see Daniel 8 and 9). Here he explains to Daniel the future of Israel. Holy Tradition also credits Gabriel with inspiring Moses to write either Genesis or the entire Pentateuch. Later Jewish Rabbinical literature states that he was the angel who taught Joseph the 70 languages needed to rule over Egypt, but this is not in the Genesis account.

&quot;The reason why Gabriel is most celebrated, though, is his role in the Annunciation and other events in New Testament times attributed to him by Tradition (although his name may not be mentioned explicitly in the text). Starting in Luke 1, Gabriel first appears to Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist. Zachariah initially refused to believe that his barren wife, Elizabeth, and he will have a child in their old age. This is the moment in which Gabriel says,&quot;I am Gabriel, I stand before God, and I have been sent to speak to you and tell you this good news&quot;(Luke 1:19). He then strikes Zachariah mute until the birth of his son because of his disbelieve.

&quot;Often Gabrial is also recognized as the angel who annunced the birth of the Theotokos to her parents Joachim and Anna and who came to Joseph the Betrothed in a dream, telling him that Mary&apos;s pregnancy was indeed miraculous and that he should protect and care for her.&quot;

The meeting of Joachim and Anna can be found

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_(Jerusalem) 

And

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_and_Anne_Meeting_at_the_Golden_Gate 

Gabriel&quot;then appeared to the shepherds near Bethlehem, telling them of the Nativity. Thus he was the key figure in revealing to humanity the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. He will also announce the Second Coming of the Lord by blowing a trumpet.

&quot;Finally, Gabriel was present during the Passion and Resurrection of the Lord. He is identified as the mysterious&quot;young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment ... following Jesus&quot;who fled naked after he was seized during Christ&apos;s arrest in Gethsemene (Mark 14:51-2). Most importantly, it was Gabriel who annunced Christ&apos;s Resurrection to the Myrrh-bearing Women outside the tomb.&quot;

Gabriel in Iconography

&quot;Because the Angels are incorporal beings, though the nevertheless take on human form when appearing to mankind, it can be difficult to differentiate one from another in icons.

&quot;However, Gabriel is ususally portrayed with certain distinguishing characteristics. He typically wears blue or white garments, he holds either a lily (representing the Theotokos), a trumpet, a shining lantern, a branch from Paradise presented to him by the Theotokos, or a spear in the right hand and often a mirrormade of Jasper and with an X (the first letter of Christ (Xpiotoc) in Greek)in his left hand.&quot;

The Greek letters are simplified. Gabriel should not be confused with Archangel Michael, whose&quot;specific mission is to supress the enemies of the true Church&quot;, whereas&quot;Gabriel&apos;s is to announce mankind&apos;s salvation.&quot;A 12th century anonymous Russian painter depicts Archangel Gabriel with&quot;Goldenlocks and Kingly Ruby&quot;.

The Mysteries of the Church are wonderfully told.


Noteworth also is the Muslim&apos;s believe that the Archangel Gabriel, Jibral, revealed the Koran to the Prophet Mohamed and also took the Prophet to Jerusalem, and Gabriel

&quot;.... was at a distance of but two bow-lenghts or (even) nearer; So did (God) convey inspiration to his servant (Gabriel) and then he (Gabriel) Conveyed (that to Muhammad).

&quot;From Abdullaah ibn Mas&apos;ood, who said: the Messenger of God saw Gabriel in his true form. He had six hundred wings, each of which covered the horizon. There fell from his wings jewels, pearls and rubies, only God knows about them&quot;.

Have a great day

To build a space of love

Start with a vision: Of our pristine origins: Male and female created he them: Both with exactly the same powers, abilities and potential; each complimentary to the other. God-like creatures in his own Image and Likeness.

Next: Accept the fact that we, as a race, have gone down the wrong road and continually go down the wrong road. The civilization we have built has gone astray. We stepped away from our first estate and lost our original likeness to God and nothing has been the same ever since!

Then: Create a space of love within and around ourselves where we can regain everything we have lost.

A space of love exists within ourselves when we agree with God and decide to co-operate in the process of purifying our thoughts, our feelings and our acts of will and to increase our conscious awareness.

A space of love exists between two people when they decide to accept each other and agree to love and care about each other, to live in harmony and with harmony as their guide and goal.

A space of love exists between a group of people when they agree to live for the best in each other.

A space of love creates an environment where all living things can grow into their full potential.

Our homes can be a space of love, a space of warmth and light, of good and positive vibrations, of beauty. Where we work can be a space of love; where we go to school, where we go to Church together, etc. etc.

This is our vision; the vision of all those who wish to embrace it, to build a space of love.

Within ourselves
Between two people
For our families
In our lives, together with each other.

However, be aware, there will be resistance on every level for those who decide to embrace this vision!
As long as we realize that beforehand, we can take it into account- Forewarned is forearmed. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Life giving spring

Post by charlotte on Apr 9, 2010, 10:55am

Yesterday, I walked by a little boy sitting in an old tree about 8 feet off the ground. He looked at me and said&quot;Hi&quot;, I stopped:

&quot;Hi, what are you doing up there?&quot;

&quot;Uhm, I&apos;m a little afraid.&quot;

&quot;Why are you afraid, you&apos;re not far up and wouldn&apos;t get hurt if you&apos;d fall, you could easily jump these few feet.&quot;

I looked further up the tree to gauge the branches and he followed my eyes. I said:

&quot;You could easily climb higher, the branches are spaced nicely and strong.&quot;

Pause. A little girl joins us.

&quot;My name is Kay and this is my sister Elina.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you Kay and Elina.&quot;Kay:

&quot;Uhm, I know you.&quot;

&quot;You do? Did you see me before?&quot;

&quot;Uhm, no . . . .&quot;

The children&apos;s Mother approaches and I say to them:

&quot;Well, this is nice, have fun in the tree, and you too&quot;I said to his sister laying on the broad, almost horizontally grown part near the ground.

The space of love between us was disturbed by a distrustful vibration. I said to the Mother that it was nice speaking with her friendly children and the Lady but smiled and walked away with them. &apos;Tis a sad state of affairs of suspicion everywhere in a fearful world.

The entire Universe is a Space of love, palpable, different from&quot;thin air&quot;.

I did read this morning,&quot;Bright Friday&quot;, on the Live giving spring.

 Panagia the Life Giging Spring 

 Panagia the Life Giving Spring icon and monastery originate from Baloukli, just west of Constantinople, and the first monastery built on the location of the garden that was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, sometime in the 5th century. This icon is commemorated by the Church on Bright Friday of each year.&quot;

Story

&quot;The image of the icon includes the Virgin Mary with her child standing within a stone chalice that presumably represents the living water which is Christ. This&quot;living water&quot;is contained in the cross which all who follow him must bear as he did. In the early Church, the baptismal font was actually in the form of a cross just like the cross of this icon and the Christians would enter it from the base of the cross and come out at the top, and then re-enter from the left of the cross and come out on the right of the cross; then the priest, who would be standing in the middle of the cross/baptismal font, would commune them.

&quot;During the reign of Emperor Marcian (d. 457), a bling man lost his way and the famous warrior, Leo Marcellus, passing by, helped him. As he went to search for some water to refresh the exhausted man, he heard a voice directing him to the spring.

In Constantinople, sometime in the 5th century, there was a garden dedicated to the Virgin Mother of God. In the garden was a spring and it was well-known for its miracles. In its history, the fountain had been destroyed and then rebuilt on many occasions, at the request of the Virgin Mother.&quot;

The Church was destroyed and a mosque constructed from its materials, but

&quot;During the reign of Sultan Mahmoud, the Orthodox received a measure of freedom to conduct religious services. They used it to erect, for the third time, a church of the Life-giving_Spring. In 1835, with great pomp, the Eucumenical Patriarch Constantine, celebrated with 20 bishops and an enormous flood ot the faithful, consecrated the church which stands to this day. Nearby was built a hospital and alms-house. Even the Muslims spoke with great respect of the Live-giving Spring, and of the Theotokos, who through it pours out her grace-filled power.&quot;Great among women Holy Mary&quot;is how they refer to the Most Holy Virgin. The water from the Life-giving Spring they call&quot;water of Holy Mary.&quot;

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Panagia_the_Life_Giving_Spring 

&quot;In Orthodox Hymnography the Theotokos is frequently compared to a Holy Fountain.

Kontakion Tone 8

O most favored of God,
You confer on me the healing of your grace from your inexhaustable Spring.
Therefore, since you gave birth incomprehensibly to the Word,
I implore you to refresh me with the dew of your grace that I might cry to you:
Hail, O Water of salvation.

Another beautiful Icon is here

Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II, a Reformer, not only permitted to rebuid of a small chapel,&quot;but of a large church according to the original dimensions&quot;, which was destroyed again on September 6, 1955, by rioting Muslims.

As a Civilization....I realized that so fully yesterday afternoon, shut the balcony door, covered my ears with my hands, closed my eyes and went to my space of love.

Easter Saturday or Bright Saturday is the last day of Bright Week, the week after Pascha.

On this day, the Paschal Artos, a large loaf of leavened bread which was blessed at the end of the Paschal Vigil on Pascha (early Easter morning), is broken and distibuted to the faithful.

&quot;According to the Supplemental Book of Needs, the fracturing of the Artos is done in this way:&quot;After the Divine Liturgy, the Artos is carried, as is customary, to the Trapeza (refectory) and&quot;Christ is risen...&quot;is sung three times, with reverences, and&quot;Our Father&quot;has been said, and having blessed the food as usual, the Deacon says:&quot;Let us pray to the Lord&quot;, and the Brethren respond&quot;Lord have mercy&quot;, the Priest says the following prayer over the Artos:&quot;O Loerd Jesus Christ our God, the angelic Bread, the Bread of Life eternal, Who came down from heaven and nourished us on these brightest days with the spiritual food of Thy divine benefactions for the sake of Thy three-day saving Resurrection, also now look down, we humbly pray Thee, upon our prayers and thanksgivings, and as Thou didst bless the five loaves in the wilderness, do now bless this bread, that all who eat of it may be granted corporal and spiritual blessings and health, through the graces and compassion of Thy love for mankind. For Thou art our sanctification, and unto Thee we send up glory, together with Thine Unoriginate Father, and Thine All-holy, Good and Life-creating Spirit, now and ever, and onto ages of ages. The Brethren: Amen. Having fractured the Artos as is customary, he distributes it to everyone before the meal.&quot;

Honored today

The Venerable Hilarion the Great

&quot;like a rose growing among thorns, this great saint was born of pagan parents in the village of Tabatha near Gaza in Palestine. His parents sent him to study in Alexandria, where the gifted youngster quickly assimilated both secular learning and spiritual wisdom. Coming to know the Lord Christ, he was baptized, and desired to dedicate himself completely to the service of the Lord. With this desire in his heart, Hilarion visited St. Anthony in the desert and became his disciple. Then he returned to his homeland and lived a life of asceticism near Maluma, at Gaza. Demons tried to terrify him in various ways, but by prayer to God and the sign of the cross he always overcame them and drove them away. Many lovers of the spiritual life gathered around him. Hilarion became for Palestine what St. Anthony was for Egypt. A divine teacher, a strict ascetic and a wonderful miracle-worker. Hilarion was revered not only by Christians but also by pagans. However, fearing the praise of men and tearfully lamenting,&quot;Woe is me, I have received my reward on earth!&quot;he fled from place to place, to hide from men and remain alone with his soul and God. Thus, he traveled and lived in Egypt, Sicily, Dalmatia and finally Cyprus, where his life of great labor came to an end in about the year 372, at the age of eighty. The miracle-working relics of St. Hilarion were translated by his disciple Hesychius, and were placed in the monastery he founded.&quot;

Prolog from Ohrid

I looked for the Saint&apos;s Monastery but found instead

Saint Hilarion Castle in the Besparmak Mountains, stated&quot;to have inspired Walt Disney to use it as a design for the castle of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

&quot;The castle is named after a little known hermit who fled Palestine during the 7th century to live and die up here, purging the mountain of pagan demons. It is said that the hermit was stone deaf, so was able to resist the tempting cries of the demons who stalked the mountains with ease. The deamons finaaly admitted defeat, and left Hilarion and the mountain in peace.&quot;

The dates from the Prolog, late 4th century, and this article, 7th century, are contradictory, and the content of the paragraph certifies literal and&quot;rational&quot;history. The Castle is in Kyrenia, North Cyprus, the site has nice pictures and some history.

Then I sailed west to Albania, a country on my mind since my school days, looking for Cathedrals and Monasteries. Albania is slightly larger than Maryland, its West Coast borders on the gentle Adriadic Sea which meets the Ionian Sea.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania 

Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania

&quot;Christianity first arrived in Albania with Saint Paul during the first century. Saint Paul wrote that he preached in the Roman province of Illiricum, and legend holds that he visited Durres. However, it was with Constantine the Great (324-37), who accepted Christianity and transferred the empire&apos;s capital from Rome to Byzantium, that the Christian religion was officially in the lands of modern Albania.&quot;

The Church&quot;declared its autocephany in 1922, and gained recognition from the Patriarch of Constantinople in 1937.

How Natur (as Plato saith) teacheth man by beauty,
and by the lure of sense leadeth him ever upward
to heav&apos;nly things, and how the more sensible forms
which first arrest him take-on ever more and more
spiritual aspects,yet discard not nor disown
their sensuous beauty, since thatt is eternal and sure,
their essence thereof being the reverent joy of life
this everywhere is seen and most overtly in Breed
(too many in truth ther be who find it never elsewhere):
yet man is slow to see that love&apos;s call to women
is graver and more solemn than it can be to him,
by reason of her higher function and duty therein,
and that all past attainment which his spirit hath won
came to him thru&apos; motherhood of the nursling boy;
yea, ev&apos;n the dignity of his masculine intellect,
that outreacheth her range, was first of her making
and never coud hav fruited but for the dvout
fostering environment of her lovingkindness:
nor can man&apos;s futur attainment forego thatt shelter,
wherwith her precocious girlhood accompaniet
the evergrowing incumbency of his pupillage,
as it grew in the bruts: . . and here &apos;tis seen again
how &apos;tis a backsliding and treason against nature
when women will unsex their own ideal of Love,
and ignorantly aiming to be in all things as men,
would make love as men make ittho&apos; Sappho did thatt,
who rare among women for manly mastery of art,
a Nonsuch of her kind, exceeded by default,
nondescript, and for lack of the true feminin
borrow&apos;d effeminacy of men, the incontinents,
who, ranking with gluttons in Aristotle&apos;s book,
made a lascivious pleasure of their Lesbian loves;
till in the event the euphony of her isle&apos;s fair name
whisper&apos;d an unspoken and else unspeakable shame.
Nor can the ethic that here intrudeth be deny&apos;d,
since if men speak of morals &apos;tis of sex they think;
forwhy the passion of it both transporteth their souls
and troubleth daily life with problems of conduct.

Now to the most who are like to read my English poem
christian marriage wil seem a stablish&apos;d ordinance
as universal, wholesome and needful to men
as WHEAT is, ubiquitous, and sib to a weed
that yet wil hamper its cultur, overruleth all else,
weigheth our gold by single grains, and harvested
measureth in sacks the peace and welfare of the world,
OUR BREAD OF LIFE, the symbol of the food of the soul.

But tho&apos; monogamy had been by wise lawgivers
coded with rights and duties and property, and thus
by Jewish use or Roman held place in the Church,
the instinct of sex was ever anathema to the Essenes
whose thought handsel&apos;d the faith; &apos;twas to thatt sect the accurst
contamination of all spiritual purity:
and only after tough battle against two mighty outbursts
of Pagan Poetry coud marriage come in the end
to its own, from being a tolerated discordancy
to be an accepted harmony, and hallow&apos;d as such
within the Church, a sacrament. Of those two wars
the story is long, and now &apos;tis here briefly to tell.

Sunday of Saint Thomas the Twin

&quot;The Aramaic Tau&apos;ma: the name&quot;Thomas&quot;itself comes from the Aramaic word for twin: T&apos;oma. Thus the name convention Didymus Thomas trice repeated in the Gospel of John is in fact a tautology that could potentially be interpreted as omitting the Twin&apos;s actual name.&quot;

Much is written about the Apostle but the Twin is not identified. Parhaps Thomas is called the Twin because He first doubted and then believed, which simple thinking came to me when I read:

&quot;According to The Passing of Mary, a text attributed to Joseph Arimathaea,&quot;Thomas was the only witness of the Assumption of Mary into heaven - from which she dropped her girdle&quot;to Thomas, girdle being interpretet&quot;the accomplished pristine awareness&quot;.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Apostle 

The white Basilica of Saint Thomas in India

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Thome_Basilica 

&quot;At that time&quot;, Jesus said to the Disciples:&quot;Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.&quot;And when He said this, He breathed on them, and said to them,&quot;Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&quot;

This passage from the Gospel of John would mean that we have the choice and power to forgive or retain the sins of others.

&quot;Jesus said to him,&quot;Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.&quot;

Commentary

&quot;The Holy Church calls the doubt of Thomas&quot;blessed doubt.&quot;This is because his doubt did not resist the truth, but desperately desired the truth. Blessed doubt gives birth to faith when it receives an answer. St. Thomas&apos; doubt now teaches Christ&apos;s Passion and Resurrection to all, and leads him to the clearest confession of Christ&apos;s Divinity, addressing Jesus as&quot;my Lord and my God.&quot;May we all learn from the blessed doubt of St. Thomas that Christ is truly risen, and allow His Resurrection to transform our lives, just as it did for the doubting Thomas.&quot;

The Church brings everything&quot;down&quot;to Us, applied to Us, recalling Fern&apos;s:&quot;What for and what good is it all if it isn&apos;t for Us.&quot;

It was wonderful in Church, transporting heavenly Singing in many tones. Fr. Norman served the Matins and Holy Liturgy, and commented on James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying to Jesus,&quot;Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.&quot;And He said to them,&quot;What do you want me to do for you?&quot;They said to Him,&quot;Grant us that we may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left, in Your glory.&quot;

And Jesus said to them,&quot;You do not know what you ask&quot;, to sit on My right or left&quot;is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it is prepared.&quot;Fr. Norman explained that not even the Father sees the faces of those who sit to the right and left because they are bent over in utter humility and devotion.

Petrova Church

&quot;The Petrova Church or Church of St. Peter and Paul is a Serbian Orthodox church on a hill of stari Ras, the medieval capital of Rascia (Serbia), near Novi Pazar, Serbia. It is the oldest church in Serbia.

&quot;The present church (8-9th century) has been built on several earlier churches of which remains have been well preserved. The foundation of the church, the massive columns, ground-plan the octagonal tower which conceals a inner cupola are examples of the circular mousoleal architectural type used after Emperor Constantine (306-312).

&quot;Saint Sava 1175-1235), a Serbian prince, brother of the serbian king Stefan Prvovencani and founder of the Serbian Orthodox church was baptized in the church. Stefan Nemanja ( Stefan Prvovencani, my note) held the council that outlawed the Bogomils at the church. Most of the preserved frescoes date to the mid-13th century when the frescoes were repainted.

&quot;The church was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia.

&quot;A 5th century BC princely grave (with regalia, robes, gold-silver jewelry, masks, beads, Attic pottery) of Greco-Illyrian type was excavated beneath the floor of the church in 1957-1958.&quot;

This excavation was under the old church.

Byzantium

&quot; Byzantium was an ancient Greek city, founded by Greek colonists from Megara in 667 BC and named after their king Byzas. The name Byzantium is a Latinization of the original name Byzantion. (Later renamed Constantinople)

History

&quot;The origins of Byzantium are shrouded in legend. The traditional legend has it that Byzas from Megara (a town near Athens), founded Byzantium in 667 BC, when he sailed northeast across the Aegean Sea. Byzas consulted the Oracle at Delphi to ask where to make his new city. The Oracle told him to found it&quot;opposite the blind.&quot;At that time he did not know what this meant. But when he came upon the Bosporus he realized what it meant: on the east shore was a Greek city, Chalcedon. However, according to legend, they had not noticed the land that lay a half-mile away. Byzas founded his city here on the European coast and named it Byzantion after himself. It was mainly a trading city due to its strategic location at the Black Sea&apos;s only entrance. Byzantion later conquered Chalcedon, across the Bosporus on the Asiatic side.&quot;

I don&apos;t know either what that means: when Byzas happened upon the Bosporus he knew what the Delphi Oracle meant because there was the Greek city Chalcedon, but didn&apos;t notice the land half-mile away, and founded his city on the European coast&quot;oppsite the blind&quot;, the Chalcedonians on the Asiatic side which he later conquered? And what of the&quot;land half-mile away?&quot;I can&apos;t even discern a mystical import.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantium 

The colonists of Megara, founders of Byzantium, according to legend.

&quot; Megara is an ancient city in Attica, Greece. It lies in the northern section of the Isthmus of Corinth opposite the island of Salamis, which belonged to Megara in archaic times, before being taken by Athens. Megara was one of the four districts of Attica, embodied in the four mythis sons of King Pandion II, of whom Nisos was the ruler of Megara.

&quot;In historical times, Megara was an early dependency of Corinth, in which capacity colonists from Megara founded Megara Hyblaea, a small polis north of Syracuse in Sicily. Megara then fought a war of independence with Corinth, and founded (c. 667BC) Byzantium, as well as Chalcedon.&quot;

In that case, Chalcedon didn&apos;t exist when Byzas sailed north-east across the Aegean Sea and supposedly espied the city and therefore understood what the Oracle meant.

&quot;The most famous citizen of Megara in antiquity was Byzas, the legendary founder of Byzantium in the 7th century BC. The 6th century BC poet Theognis also came from Megara. In the early 4th century BC, Euclid of Megara founded the Megarian school of philosophy which flourished for about a century, and became famous for the use of logic and dialectic.&quot;

But here is the most important sentence and the chief reason I persued some of this history, which connects it with the Petrova Chuch of St. Peter and Paul in Serbia, where in a 5th century BC grave beneath the Church was found Attic pottery among other riches, Megara being a district in Attica:

&quot;The Megarians were proverbial for their generosity in building and endowing temples. Jerome reports&quot;There is a common saying about the Megarians [. . . :]&quot;They build as if they are to live forever, they live as if they are to die tomorrow.&quot;

Speaking of doubt, yesterday, during an interview on the radio, a writer of a book on Religion agreed with the&quot;blessed doubt&quot;of the Church. A caller stated that doubt is actually a gift from God in that it compells the Believer to inquire ever deeper into the Mysteries of God, and the Non-believer to keep doubting his doubt.

The ancient Egyptians personified doubt as Set, bringing hot storms from the barren desert.

The doubting Apostles

Homily,
The Prologue from Ohrid

 &quot;What we have heard, what we have seen with our own eyes, what we looked upon and touched with our hands---We proclaim now to you&quot; (1 St. John 1:1). 

&quot;Behold, such is the apostolic preaching! The apostles do not speak as wordly sages, nor like philosophers and even less as theoreticians who make suppositions about something in order to discover something. The apostles speak about things they have not sought but which unexpectedly surrounded them; about the fact which they did not discover but, so to speak, unexpectedly found them and seized them. They did not occupy themselves with spiritual researches nor have they studied psychology, neither did they, much less, occupy themselves with spiritism. Their occupation was fishing - one totally experimental physical occupation. While they were fishing, the God-Man [Jesus] appeared to them and cautiously and slowly introduced them to a new vocation in the service of Himself. At first, they did not believe Him but they, still more cautiously and slowly with fear and hesitation and much wavering, came toward Him and recognized Him. Until the apostles saw Him many times with their own eyes and until they discussed Him many times among themselves and, until they felt them with their own hands, their experienced fact is supernatural but their method of recognizing this fact is thoroughly sensory and positively learned. Not even one contemporay scholar would be able to use a more positive method to know Christ. The apostles saw not only one miracle but numerous miracles. They hears not only one lesson but many lessons which could not be contained in numerous books. They saw the resurrected Lord for fourty days; they walked with Him, they conversed with Him, they ate with Him, and they touched Him. In a word: they personally and first handedly had thousand of wondrous facts they learned and confirmed one great fact, i.e., that Christ is the God-Man, the Son of the living God, the Man-loving Savior of mankind and the All-Powerful Judge of the living and the dead.&quot;

&quot;O resurrected Lord confirm us in the faith and ardor of Your Holy Apostles.&quot;

Their not doing research to discover something, much less occupy themselves with Spiritism, reminds me of Fern&apos;s,&quot;when there is a receptivity or opening the Lord puts something in there&quot;, or the&quot;Sudden Enlightenment&quot;, though with most of us it comes in discrete quanta or octaves, still parts or note&apos;s of the Whole, accruing, until we stand in the Light and hear the Heavenly Symphony.

The message of the Bible

The entire Bible can be summed up thusly;&quot;We are God&apos;s children and thus have inherently all the powers and abilities of our parent-GOD.&quot;Add to that the parable of&quot;The Prodigal son,&quot;and there you have the whole thing in a nutshell.

For those who are unfamiliar with this parable it goes like this:

&quot;And he said, A certain man had two sons: And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.

And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.

And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father&apos;s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.

And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.

And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.&quot;
(Luke 15:11-23)

Our life on earth consists of,&quot;Coming to ourselves,&quot;as the Prodigal Son did, and,&quot;Returning to our Father&apos;s house.&quot;

Our return to God is made possible and greatly facilitated by our Lord&apos;s saving dispensation towards us as administered through His Holy Church as established by His Apostles; preserved and handed down to us until this day in an unbroken lineage by those Apostle&apos;s direct descendants.

This return to God takes us along a path which leads through a process of Purification, Illumination and Deification which increases our faith to the size of a mustard seed; of which the Lord says:

&quot;verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.&quot;
(Matthew 17:20)

Now, we may choose to believe that the Lord was exercising Hyperbole here and was merely speaking allegorically; I, however, choose to believe that He was speaking quite literally and was trying to give us an idea of our own natural abilities as sons and daughters of the living God.

 http://environnement.ecoles.free.fr/bibl....0les%20eaux.jpg 

&quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do&quot;

In the beginning. God. Created.

God made we human beings to be the crown of creation. As such, He endowed us with complete freedom of will and authority over His creation.

This authority over creation allows for an almost unlimited degree of influence which we wield, for good or for ill.

God has given us time/space and the laws of physics as a temporary framework within which to learn from experience how to use the influence we have on creation with responsibility, in balance and harmony with His overarching, Divine Intention.

This limited framework is, however, only temporary. A time will come when there will be,&quot;Time no longer,&quot;(Rev 10:6) and we will be confirmed in the use or misuse, as the case may be, of our freedom and authority. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Our God is an all consuming fire

We were created to be like God in every way possible and to inherit the Kingdom of God. Our first-created parents fell away from God and we have inherited instead, the consequences of that fall. We are estranged from God and have become other than what God originally intended for us to be. The pure gold of our soul has become adulterated with needless impurities which obscure from us our own true nature.

God, however, in his loving kindness and infinite compassion for mankind, has provided a means for us to be reconciled with himself; refined and entirely re-united.

Through his saving dispensation toward us, he meets us wherever we are and raises us up, gradually, back into the fullness of his presence.

The presence of God is an all consuming fire which, as we draw closer to it, like gold in a crucible, melts away the dross which has accumulated throughout our soul. This process of Purification/Illumination/Deification which is mediated for us by the incarnate God, heals and restores us entirely to our original blessed state which we enjoyed together in Paradise before the fall.

&quot;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.&quot;(1 John 3:2)

As Orthodox Christians, we are not simply waiting for the end of the world and the second coming of Christ, we are running towards it! Or, as the Apostle Peter puts it in his second general epistle:

&quot;But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.

Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?

Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot;(2 Peter 3:10-13)

Therefore, let us also,&quot;Look for and hasten unto the coming of the day of God,&quot;being thereby Purified and Illumined,&quot;With open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,&quot;that we too may be,&quot;changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.&quot;(2 Corinthians 3:18)

The inner journey of the mind and heart

He who has repented travels toward the Lord. The way to God is an inner journey accomplished in the mind and heart. It is necessary so to attune the thoughts of the mind and the disposition of the heart that the spirit of man will always be with the Lord, as if joined with him. He who is thus attuned is constantly enlightened by inner light, and receives in himself the rays of spiritual radiance like Moses, whose face was glorified on the mount because he was illumined by God.

Orthodox Christians! Hold fast to the grace which you have; never let it become a matter of habit; never measure it by merely human standards or expect it to be logical or comprehensible to those who understand nothing higher than what is human or who think to obtain the Holy Spirit in some other way than that which the one Church of Christ has handed down to us. True Orthodoxy by its very nature must seem totally out of place in these demonic times, a dwindling minority of the despised and&quot;foolish,&quot;in the midst of a religious&quot;revival&quot;inspired by another kind of spirit. But let us take comfort from the certain words of our Lord Jesus Christ: Fear not, little flock, for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom&quot;(Luke 12:32). 

Let us live, even as true Christians of all times have lived, in expectation of the end of all things and the coming of our dear Saviour; for &quot;He that giveth testimony of these things saith: Surely I come quickly. Amen. Come, Lord Jesus&quot; Apoc. 22:20).

Saint Joseph the Hymnographer

&quot;Our father among saints Joseph the Hymnographer was a monk during the 9th century who was a strong defender of of the reverence of icons during the iconoclastic period. He is remembered for being a prolific writer of hymns, as noted throughout the Parakletike.&quot;

Saint Joseph was born in Sicily in 816, moved with his parents to Greece in 830, was brought to Constantinople, and became a monk at the Monastery of Latmos.&quot;While in prison he inspired others to stand strong against heretics&quot;, and while in prison&quot;Saint Nicholas of Myra appeared to him in a vision and asked him to sing in the name of God.&quot;

Hymn of the happy Pilgrims

Oh happy band of pilgrims,
If onward you will tread,
With Jesus as your Fellow,
To Jesus as your Head.

O happy if you labor,
As Jesus did for men;
O happy if you hunger
As Jesus hungered then.

The cross the Jesus carried
He carried as your due;
The crown that Jesus wearet
He weareth it for you.

The faith by which you see Him,
The hope in which you yearn,
The love that through all troubles
To Him alone will turn.

What are they but forerunners
To lead you to His sight?
What are they save the effluence
Of uncreated Light?

The trails that beset you,
the sorrows you endure,
The manifold temptations
That death alone can cure.

What are they but His jewels
Of right celestial worth?
What are they but the ladder
Set up to heaven on earth?

O happy band of pilgrims,
look upward to the skies,
Where such a light affliction
Shall win you such a prize.

To Father, Son, and Spirit,
The God whom we adore,
Be loftiest praise given,
Now and for evermore.

The first War of the Essenes was with the poetry
of SELFHOOD, those sages and epic rhapsodies
which had burst forth to flood all Europe in the time
of the northern invasions, when the hideous Huns,
extending the right wing of their havoc, swept down
on the old lands of the Goths. Soon as their arrows prick&apos;d
our Teuton forefathers, a clash of arms and yell
of battle arose, that in the unsearchable storage
of earth&apos;s high firmament vibrathed to this day.

The warriors, who in vain defence of home escaped
the first mauling and massacre, wer driven forth
and, pressing Westward desperatly, became in turn
themselves ruthless invaders, live firebrands and spredd
the blast of their contagion to Allemand and Frank,
Burgundian, Vandal and Lombard, from Angle and Dane
to furthest Kelt; and with the sword followed the song,
an inextinguishable pan of battle and blood.

A sudden eruption of nature, as when earth quaketh
and faltering along the edges of its winkling shell
the mountains roar and crack, and vent their ruddy bowels
in spume of molten lava; as oft had been where now
some gracious valley embosom&apos;d in soft azurous hills
smileth, an Eden as fair as Goddes love was feign&apos;d
to have planted for man&apos;s usethatt lost garden regain&apos;d,
lost once thru&apos; pride and now by long stooping regain&apos;d,
a pictur and outward symbol of the comfort of them
whose spirits dwell in the Eden that the Muse hath made
her garden of soul in the golden lapses of Time; 
and if, tracing to its source some Heliconian rill,
its mossgrown cave is found in the black splinter&apos;d rock,
where thatt once cool&apos;d and stay&apos;d, a volcanic moraine
to bank his blossom&apos;d Paradise and feed his vines,
ther-after to the poet all his joy wil seem
 a strange mysterious dream, a thread of beauty eterne
enwoven in mortal change, and he himself a flower
fertilized awhile on the quench&apos;d torrent of Hell.

Now when Rome&apos;s mitred prelates ambled o&apos;er the Alps
to hold the Gallic provinces, whose overlords
their missioners had won to the cofession of Christ,
the pagan folk submissiv to constraint were driv&apos;n
in flocks to th&apos; font, but got little washing therein.
Whatever of kindliness Tacitus once had found
sequester&apos;d in the rude homesteads of Germany
was burned up in thatt fiery ordeal, which taught them
the joy of frenzy and prowess, and the songs whereby
they glorify&apos;d the memory of successful lust,
and stirr&apos;d anew the fierce delight of battle and blood.

Good Morning!

Suitable is the Icon in Reply #736, and the Church as Icon livingly transforms in Appearances, more so at the beginning of the Matins when only a few Persons are present, and yesterday especially during the Bells ringing, praying and singing in one elevating transcendent Sound....

It was beautiful yesterday, the Sunday of St. Joseph the Arimathea, and the Holy Myrrhbearing Women.

Father Ceko called Joseph the Arimathea&quot;a Secret Disciple&quot;who takes care of the body of Jesus after death.

Righteous Joseph Troparion - Tone Two

The noble Joseph, when he had taken down Your most pure Body from the Tree, wrapped it in fine linen and anointed it with spices, and placed it in a new tomb. But You rose on the third day, O Lord, granting the world great mercy!

Holy Myrrhbearers Troparion - Tone Two

The angel came to the myrrhbearing women at the tomb and said:&quot;Myrrh is fitting for the dead; but Christ has sown himself a stranger to corruption! So proclaim:&quot;The Lord is risen, granting the world great mercy!&quot;

Holy Myrrhbearers Kontakion - Tone Two

You commanded the myrrhbearers to rejoice, and stopped the lamentation of Eve, the first mother, by Your Resurrection, O Christ God, instructing them to preach to Your apostles:&quot;The Savior is risen from the tomb!&quot;

The reading was from the Holy Gospel according to St. Mark.

&quot;At that time, Joseph the Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate marveled that He was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if He had been dead for some time. So when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. Then he bought fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which he had hewn out of the rock; and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Jesus observed where He was laid. Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, that they may come and anoint Him. Very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. And they said amongst themselves,&quot;Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?&quot;But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away - for it was very large. And entering the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed. But he said to them,&quot;Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid Him. But go, tell His disciples - and Peter - that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, as He said to you.&quot;So they went out quicly and fled from the tomb, for they trembled and were amazed. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.&quot;

The message is that though the Faith of the women was stronger than that of the hiding Disciples, it was still imperfect because they too, prepared for the corruption of Christ&apos;s body.&quot;His rest in the tomb fulfills the image of His birth in a cave and reveals the ultimate purpose of His coming. The specific mention of Peter here reveals a special care for the one who had denied Christ.&quot;

Reminds me of Fern saying that, like earthly parents, the Divine Parents give special care to the weakest child, which can also be applied to fallen Humanity entire.

Let no one doubt that Johnny Depp is a Priest, joked Father Ceko, referring to a visiting Priest who much resembles the actor. Father Ceko also let me know that He has not forgotten about me.

If there is one word in the English language that has, perhaps, the greatest significance about what it means to be a human being, that word is,&quot;INFLUENCE.&quot;What comes to mind when we hear the word influence?

Influence is a two-edged sword.On the one hand, there are continually things seeking to have an influence upon us, either for good or for ill which we have to determine which to accept and which to reject.

On the other hand, each of us has a profound influence on each other and on everything around us which we have to decide what kind of an influence will I choose to have?

It is within each one of our own power RIGHT NOW to decide what we will allow to influence ourselves and what kind of an influence we will have on others. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Good indeed, great would be if one of these days I would receive mail or a phone call, but Fr. Ceko seems very busy all the time, and how could I not be remembered in the book of life?

My head feels like a stone this morning due to an oppressive nightmare which influence will not abade. They say a Mensch = Human Being is the product of his surroundings from birth. That may be true to a degree with everyone, but as soon as we differentiate between I and the outer world, some people fashion a protective shell for themselves and are aware of what they allow or disallow to influence them. Such people allow things they like and love owing to affinity, others are molded by strict Parents to become a certain personality (mask), yet others are just swept along the river of life, but even in the latter two categories is a Rebel suppressed.

My soul was influenced by the fields and forests, flowers and creatures, my thinking by my Father and Mother as far as I let it, and some cruelties penetrated my shell. All else during the years was tangential until I met Mr. Hall and all my Teachers in His Sphere, and, of course, Fern of enormous influence bringing to a confluence the most selective things I had learned by introducing me to the Noblest Man that ever lived in the tides of time, the immortal Sir Francis Bacon of ever constant influence in my life, as obvious in my love for Poetry. If you only knew Him as I do, a most fortunate creature thou would be, for when He speaks so sweet and musical the voice of all the gods make heaven drowsy with the harmony.

I hope &apos;tis a good influence on everyone, as for the double-edged sword of Influences, to the enamoured Heart evil is irrelevant.

As cherished as is anonymity and privacy, it would be interesting if some Readers here would give letters to what has and what does now influence their lives in the challenge of ever growing and becoming. Who is there - not inspired when influenced by Great Minds, and takes wings when inspired by Divine Minds.

So inspired, my poetic Rhapsody of yesterday is confirmed by our Father Ephrem the Syrian the prolific Hymn Writer, who holds that Poetry is not only a vihicle for Theology, but in many ways superior to philosophical discourse for the purpose of doing Theology, hence the poetical language of the Saints, Bible Phrases and the Church. Surely it is because Divine Poetry, as I convey it each Sunday shatters the barrier betwixt the mind and the Eternal, at least brings near the senses another Reality spoken of in this thread, and Francis joined Legion long since.

Persons here, who have read all Poetry on this site with awe and awareness, will agree thatt the Divine Poet, and there is only One: Bacon/Shakespeare, knows all things in Heaven and Earth - than dream&apos;d of in our Philosophies, as claimed. I often wonder why evil is irrelevant to me, why I simply ignore it, and why, though the Church mentions&quot;fear of God&quot;, I am not afraid of God for He is a good and loving God, and repenting, He blesses Us, His Inheritence.

Though in the Greater, according to The Apostolic Fathers:

&quot;Thus the humility and godly submission of so great and illustrious men have rendered not only us, but also all the generations before us, better; even as many as have received His oracles in fear and truth. Wherefore, having so many great and glorious examples set before us, let us turn again to the practice of that peace which from the beginning was the mark set before us; and let us look steadfast to the Father and Creator of the universe, and cleave to His mighty and surpassingly great gifts and benefactions of peace. Let us contemplate Him with our understanding, and look with the eye of our soul to His long-suffering will. Let us reflect how free from wrath He is towards all His creation.&quot;

In tandem with Poetry, transendend experience during the Divine Liturgy on Orthodox Sunday, the Homily of Icons by His Grace, Bishop Maxim, and some such same moments in Church have permanent influence on my thinking and living, so have my Icons and Prayers, the latter in terms of the long aforementioned&quot;pray and watch&quot;, and in earnest pleading was lead by Saving Grace to a Poem for to keep in my cacoon.

Last Sunday, the Priest resembling Johnny Depp emphasized the difference between the Orthodox and other Religions, vis., in other Religions your soul goes to Heaven after death in a vague explanation, whereas Orthodoxy teaches that there is a complete divinization of matter, restoration of all people and the entire creation, which Irenaeus of Lyon called&quot;recapitulation&quot;, which I think is the perfect word, logical and true, for we can observe in the growing embryo the recapitulation of all the kingdoms, mineral, vegetable, and animal to Human Status.

Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.

Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.

For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.

Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.&apos; (Mark 13:28-37) Re: The Secret of the Universe

It was in response to my relating Fern&apos;s words that&quot;there is a complete immortalization of the body&quot;which I didn&apos;t believe at the time until you affirmed it and I read up on Theosis. It was not that long ago and I remember from the beginning of this thread the shimmering Solomonic Pearls of greatest Influence now a most cherished necklace.

The parable of the fig tree is beautiful. Similarly, I have been watching the first tender leafs sprouting on the pear tree in our backyard which bears the good fruit, and do best watching in nearness alone in personal communication with my Icons.

It is comforting to know&quot;that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.&quot;

First Prayer of St. Basil the Great

&quot;Almighty Lord, God of the Powers and of all flesh, Who livest in the highest and carest for the humble, Who searchest our hearts and affections, and clearly foreknowest the secrets of men; eternal and everliving Light, in Whom is no change nor shadow of variation; O Immortal King, receive our prayers which at the present time we offer to Thee from unclean lips, trusting in the multitude of Thy mercies. Forgive all sins committed by us in thought, word or deed, consciously or unconsciously, and cleanse us from all defilement of flesh and spirit. Grant us to pass the night of the whole present life with wakeful heart and sober thought, ever expecting the coming of the radiant day of the appearing of Thy only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, when the Judge of all will come with glory to render to each according to their deeds. May we not be found fallen and idle, but awake and alert for action, ready to accompany Him into the joy and divine palace of His glory, where there is the ceaseless sound of those keeping festival and the unspeakable delight of those who behold the ineffable beauty of Thy Face. For Thou art the true Light that enlightens and sanctifies all, and all creation sings to Thee throughout the ages. Amen.&quot;

My children always ask me,&quot;Is it o.k. to do this, is it o.k. to do that?&quot;

I tell them,&quot;Sure. As long as at the same time that you are doing whatever it is that you want to do, you can be; &apos;Awake and alert for action, ready to accompany Him into the joy and Divine palace of His glory,&apos; then it&apos;s fine. Go ahead and do it.

Use that, &apos;Readiness,&apos; as your touchstone for what you should and shouldn&apos;t do. If whatever you are doing takes you away from that, &apos;Readiness,&apos; don&apos;t do it.

And if you&apos;re NOT READY, don&apos;t do ANYTHING, until you are...&quot; Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Apr 23, 2010, 9:35am

The Evening Prayer. I am ready for three things, one I came across this morning in reading about the Martyr Terence and 40 others beheaded at Carthage, appropriate to the subject, which you pointed to almost a year ago:

Immanentize the Eschaton

&quot;To immanentize the eschaton means trying to make the eschaton (the transcendent, uncreated, spiritual, or future, the end of days, to trigger the apocalypse, see eschatology) in the immanent (within the limits of possible experience) world.&quot;

As just about every sacred concept, philosophical or poetic phrase or beautiful lyrics of a song is usurped in commerce, politics, or to appear smart, such as someone said to me just 2 days ago and which I won&apos;t even repeat, the article further states:

&quot;More recently, it has been used by conservatives as a pejorative reference to what they perceive as utopian schemes, such as socialism, communism, etc. In all these contexts it means&quot;Trying to make that which belongs to the afterlife happen here and now (on Earth)&quot;or&quot;trying to create heaven here on Earth.&quot;

Apparently, neither the conservatives nor the writer, who calls it a derogatory reference know that creating heaven here on Earth is what is means, dying to this insane world.

&quot;According to Jonah Goldberg, writing in National Review Online: 

&quot;In modern parlance, the phrace was coined by Eric Voegelin in The New Science of Politics in 1952. In the 1950s and 1960s, thanks largely to William F Buckley&apos;s popularization of the phrase, Young Americans for Freedom turned it into a political slogan.

&quot;Voegelin identified a number of similarities between ancient Gnosticism and the beliefs held by a number of modernistic political theories, particularly communism and Nazism.

&quot;He identified the root of the Gnostic impulse as alienation, that is, a sense of disconnection with society and a belief that this lack of concord with society is the result of the inherent disorder, or even evil, of the world. This alienation has two effects:

&quot;The first is the belief that the disorder of the world can be transcended by extraordinary insight, learning, or knowledge, called a Gnostic Speculation by Voegelin (the Gnostics themselves referred to this as gnosis).

&quot;The second is the desire to implement a policy to actualize the speculation, or as Voegelin describes to Immanentize the Eschaton, to create a sort of heaven on earth within history.

&quot;One of the most oft-quoted passages from Voegelin&apos;s work on Gnosticism is the following:

&quot;The problem of an eidos in history, hence, arises only when a Christian transcendental fulfillment becomes immanentized. Such an immanentist hypothesis of the eschaton, however, is a theorethical fallacy.&quot;

Voegelin thinks.

The book Fire in the Minds of Men explores the idea further.

 Dispensationalist Christianity 

&quot;The term has been used in reference to Christian sects that ascribe to Dispensationalism and work to hasten the Second Coming of Jesus and consequently the end of the world.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanentize_the_eschaton 

It also means, and in Harmony with the First Prayer of St. Basil the Great:

&quot;Enter Thou, O lord, into the darkness of my soul and arise Thy dawn within me that alway&apos; may I behold Thee before my face.&quot;

The correct definition of&quot;Immanentize the Eschaton&quot;

(Which means to,&quot;Bring about the end of the world,&quot;which is what we, as Orthodox Christians are trying to accomplish, WITHIN OURSELVES, so that we may begin to live in a foretaste of the life of the world to come in the here and now.)

Now, I&apos;m ready for work

Continued from last Sunday

A wilder strain maybe than the lost Bedouin songs,
that seal&apos;d the weird which the Angel of Araby foretold
to the outcast bondwomen in the famishing desert,
and she to her son,that his horoscope was to range
like the wild ass untameable, and his hand should be
&apos;gainst ev&apos;ry man, and ev&apos;ry man&apos;s hand against him.

Wherefor hitting for remedy on Plato&apos;s old plan,
when he proscribed Homer from his Utopian schools
saying that morals were unteachable to men
who imputed mortal passions to the immortal gods,
the priests denounced the bards, and would have stopp&apos;d their mouths;
but finding that forbiddance met with no regard
they turn&apos;d to assure their flock by amity, and to comb
the fleece they might not shear: upon which way they wrought
some mitigation, and growing reconciled to the art,
and grudging to the heathen what might serve the Church,
they took thought to divert it, and engaged the bards
to make like stirring balladry of the Bible tales:
wherein, joining themselves with good heart to the work,
their first grains of allowance multiply&apos;d to pounds;
while with their clerkly skill they sat fast to transcribe
the old pagan tales, redacted to the amended form
in which we know them, with what other numberless
wonder-lives of the Saints they wrote, symbolic masques
of Christian orthodoxy, and later mystery plays.

So all these diverse stuffs thru&apos; the dark centuries
lay quietly a-soak together in the dye-vats, wherein
our British Arthur was clandestinly christen&apos;d
and crown&apos;d, and all his knights cleansed and respirited,
reclothed as might be: for the dispossess&apos;d devils
had kindly accepted their rebate, content to find
their old home swept and garnish&apos;d; and tho&apos; verily
in their domestication, as &apos;tis with brutes, they had lost
keenness of sense and true compact of character,
they flourish to this day the darlings of our poets,
who drape their model Arthur to their taste, whereas
time was when good St. Andrew strode forth in plate-mail.

Many of the Saints are described as, &apos;Clairvoyant Wonder-Workers.&apos; These two abilities go hand-in-hand and are both latent faculties we all posses. Sanctity consists of bringing these latent faculties of ours out to the foreground and putting them at the service of God. This is something we all can do, if we so desire...

Now, you may well ask,&quot;How do I go about bringing these latent faculties of mine out to the foreground and offering them to the service of God?&quot;

The Orthodox Church and the &apos;Way of life&apos; it prescribes, is a course of therapy intended to help us accomplish this very thing. When understood in this context and willingly applied, it all hangs together and works together for good in the most splendid manner.

Orations of Gregory of Nazianzus/First invective against Julian the Emperor

From the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers

Gregory the Theologian (329-390) was one of the Three Holy Hierarchs, Cappadocian Father of&quot;consummate theological mind&quot;.

Orations

1

&quot;Hear me all ye nations, give ear unto me all ye dwellers on earth,&quot;for I am calling on you all, as it were, from the conspicuous and lofty watch-tower, whith a cry both high and loud. Hear ye nations, tribes, tongues, every kind of men, and every age, as many as now are, and as many as shall be, and in order that my proclamation may be greater, every Power of heaven, all ye Angels, whose deed was the putting down of the tyrant, who have overthrown not Sihon, king of Amorites, nor Og, king of Bashan----insignificant princes, and injuring but a small part of the land of Israel----but the Dragon, the Apostate, the Great Mind, the Assyrian, the public and private enemy of all in common, him that has madly raged and threatened much upon earth, and that has spoken and mediated much unrighteousness against Heaven!&quot;

2

&quot;Hear, O heaven! and give ear, O earth;&quot;for it is the fitting season for me to exclaim the same things with that loudest-voiced of all the prophets, Isaiah; save that he call out and testifies thus to disobedient Israel; but I, over a tyrant who also was disobedient, and has fallen a fitting victim of his own impiety.&quot;

3

&quot;Hear this, thou Soul of the great Constantius!----if thou art sensible of things below,----and ye souls of all the emerors before him that were lovers of Christ; but of him (Constantinus) above all the rest, inasmuch as he had grown up together with the inheritance of Christ, had augmented it to the utmost of his power, had made it strong through duration, so that he became on that account the most celebrated of all the sovereigns that had gone before. Alas for the contumely done him! He committed a mistake highly unworthy of his hereditary piety; he perceived not that he was bringing up for the Christians the enemy of Christ, and this one alone he did not well in showing kindness,&amp;c.;, in saving and crowning him that was saved and was crowned for evil. And very greatly will he rejoice, as much at the overthrow of impiety and the restoration of the affairsof the Christians to their first condition, as at this speech of mine: for I am about to offer unto the Lord a sermon of thanksgiving----one more holy and more pure than any sacrifice of heart; not after the fashion of that man&apos;s criminal and idle speeches, and his yet more criminal sacrifices, of which the superfluity and the effect was the power of impiety, and the wisdom, to give it the right name, foolishness: because all the power and learning of this world is but&quot;walking in darkness, and falling away far from the light;&quot;but that of his was of such sort, lying in such things, and bearing such fruits, that it was&quot;like grass quickly withered up, and as the herbs of grass quickly fallen off,&quot;and clinging unto rocks tumbling down in ruin with a crash, and more conspicuous for its fall than even for its impiety.&quot;

4

&quot;But as for me, sacrificing the sacrifice of praise to-day, and kindling the bloodless offering of words, who will furnish me with a stage commensurate with my thankfulness; or what tongue will sound it forth to such a distance as I desire; what audience will be equally eager with my speech? For not merely are thanksgivings in words most suitable unto that&quot;Word,&quot;Who, of all the names whereby He is called, especially delights in this appellation, and in such a sense of the title, but also a fitting judgment is it for that man to be punished by means of words for his transgressions against words, which though the common property of all rational beings, he begrudged to the Christians, as though they were his own exclusively; devising as he did a most irrational thing with respect to words; although, in his own opinion, the most rational of men.&quot;

Post by charlotte on Apr 27, 2010, 10:01am

I love what the Divine Poet calls&quot;Christian Confidence&quot;of St. Gregory:&quot;Hear me all ye nations, give ear unto me all ye dwellers upon earth&quot;.

Of the Emperor Julian the Apostate, Edward Gibbon writes:

&quot;The triumph of the party which he deserted and opposed has fixed a stain of infamy on the name of Julian; and the unsuccessful apostate has been overwhelmed with a torrent of pious invectives, of which the signal was given by the sonorous trumpet of Gregory Nazianzen.&quot;

Orations, First invective against Julian the Emperor

5

&quot;In the first place, because he wrongfully transferred the appellation to a pretence, as though the Greek speech belonged to religious worship exclusively, and not to the tongue; and for this reason he debarred us from the use of words as though we were stealing other people&apos;s goods----just as if he would have excluded us from the practice of the arts that are found in use amongst the Greeks, and thought it made any difference to him on account of the identity of the name; and in the next place, because he fancied he should escape our notice, not in his attempt to rob us of a bereft in the first class----we who so utterly despise these mere words----but in his apprehensions of our refutiation of his impious doctrine, just as though our force lay in the elegance of diction, and not in the knowledge of the truth, and in arguments or syllogisms, from which it is more impossible to preclude us than to hinder us from acknowledging God as long as we have a tongue. For we offer in sacrifice this thing along with the rest, that is to say, our speech, in the same way as we do our bodies, whensoever it may be necessary to contend for the Truth&apos;s sake: so that when he issued this order, he did indeed prevent us from talking Celtic, but did not stop us speaking Truth, and he exposed his own rotteness, but did not escape our refutiations; because he did not perceive that he was laying himself so much the more open to them.&quot;

Apparently St. Gregory spoke Celtic as He also uses the word &apos;iovous&apos;, but then the Kelts were all over Europe, even in my hometown Keltic coins were found, and in the Church Office, even though Catholic was the Cross of the Orthodox Church as I reported coming back from Germany.

To have one&apos;s pre-recognition confirmed in words by the Learned firms up the ground under one&apos;s feet, thatt by a Saint is heaven sent, referring to my first sentence, the first sentence and parts of the following paragraph.

6

&quot;For it was not acting like one who had full confidence in the grounds of his religion, or in the arguments themselves, to put a check upon our words: exactly as though a man should consider himself the best of the athletes, and demand to be proclaimed victor over them all, through ordering that none of those distinguished in that line should take part in the contest, or descend into the arena, or else should first maim his competitors in some limbs, which conduct would be a proof of cowardice and not of strenght, for the crowns belong to those that contend, not to those that sit above, and to those that put forth the whole of their strenght, not to those that have been deprived of part of their force; but if thou art altogether afraid to engage and to come to blows, by this very fact thou hast proclaimed thy defeat, and the victory belongs to me, though I have not contended at all, and he whom thou hast contended with should not contend. Thus then acted our wise Sovereign and Lawgiver, as though wishing that nothing should be beyond the scope of his tyranny, and enjoyned speechlessness over all the extent of his empire, exerting his tyranny over words first and foremost. But it is well-fitting for us to return thanks to God in behalf of words themselves, which have now recovered their liberty; especially to honor Him with other offerings, sparing nothing, neither money nor estates, which though at the mercy of the times, and of his tyranny, the goodness of God hath preserved to us: and before all other things to honour Him with words---- that well-deserved and united return of all whosoever have had their share in the benefit. But thus much suffices for my words concerning Words: for fear lest by streching the theme too far we exceed the limits of our time, and be thought to attend to other matters than the one on account of which we are here met together.&quot;

7

&quot;Already does my speech leap, and exult; and grows iovous along with those who hasten onward, and summons unto the spiritual dance all who were giving themselves over to fasting, to weeping, and to prayer; by day and night beseeching for deliverance out of the troubles that beset them; and making their fitting remedy in their ills that&quot;Hope which bringeth no shame;&quot;all who, having gone through great conflicts and struggles, and been beaten by the many and hard assaults of times, have become&quot;a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men,&quot;according to the saying of the Apostle, and though wearied in their bodies, yet continuing unconquered in their souls, being strong for everything in the Christ who gave them all strenght; all who, having put off the wordly Matter and dominion of Evil, or who have submitted with joy to the robbery of their possessions, or banished unjustly, as the saying is, from their own country, served, for a brief space, from husbands, or wives, or paternts, or children, or bu whatever other names of kindred less close we are bound; and who, for the blood of Christ, have despised their sufferings for the sake of Christ----all these may now seasonably repeat, and sing the words:&quot;Thou hadst set men upon our heads, we passed through fire and water, and thou didst lead us forth into a cool place.&quot;














 Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Apr 28, 2010, 9:27am

Have to begin my day with Saint Gregory the Theologian, and with those who hasten onward....

8

&quot;I also summon the other side to the rejoicing, as many as while they acknowledge the God of all, and so far are sound in their doctrines, but yet stick fast in the questions touching Providence, and out of the opposite have often chosen the better part,&quot;through the goodness that exhorteth unto reformation&quot;----but who nevertheless, through their meanness of spirit, and their levity, in the&quot;poundness of the ungodly,&quot;are kindled and set on fire, neither do bear&quot;the peace of sinners,&quot;as the Psalm says,&quot;nor endure counsel of God, neither do they wait patiently unto the end,&quot;being ever slaves of things present, and of things visible, by wonders like these are made strong for the reception of truth.&quot;

9

&quot;I call also to the souls that stand amazed around the scene and great theatre of this world, and I call unto them in the words of Isaiah:&quot;Ye women returning from the show, come hither, and turn toward me the eye of the soul from its wandering abroad, and wait and know that this is the God, exalting Himself amongst the heathen, exalting Himself in the great things He hath done, in signs, and in the things now done yet more manifestly.&quot;

Thousand Blessings upon Saint Gregory who speaks with heavenly Authority directly to the heart, and trice as many Blessings upon all Readers.

There is come now the middle of those days which commence with Christ God&apos;s saving rising and which are sealed by Pentecost, that Divine day.Illumined by both the feasts and joining both, it is radiant and also is now rendered majestic, manifesting and showing the presence of the great glory of the Ascension of our Master,Christ.

At Mid feast give thou my thirsty soul to drink of the waters of piety; for Thou, O Saviour, didst cry out to all: whosoever is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. Wherefore, O well-spring of life, Christ our God, glory be to thee.

The Fathers teach us that the feast of Mid-Pentecost stands in the middle of the fifty-day period from Pascha to Pentecost as a mighty flowing river of divine grace which have these two great feasts as its source. Pascha and Pentecost are united in Mid-Pentecost. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Apr 29, 2010, 9:12am

Thank you for such Words at such a time, yes, Father Ceko mentioned the connection between the two Great Feasts, even in a commentary during the Pascha Liturgy, I read about last week, as well as the Saints on my Calendar before and after the Sunday of the Paralytic, mine, but Saint Gregory, to Whom belongs the Victory though not contending at all, held me as one sitting in a velvet chair in His wonderfully arched Aula.

MYSTAGOGY: The Feast of of Mid-Pentecost and the Pentecostarion

A longer version

&quot;The fifty days following Pascha until the Feast of the Pentecost are known as the period of the Pentecostarion in the Orthodox Church. At the mid-point between these great feasts of Pascha and Pentecost, on the twenty-fifth day which is always a Wedenesday, is one of the most beloved feasts for the most devout Orthodox Christians known quiet simply as Mid-Pentecost. Mid-Pentecost is to the Pentecostarion what the Third Sunday of Great Lent which honors the Holy Cross is to the period of Great Lent. It is a day which helps us to focus on the central theme of the entire period. Whereas the mid-point of Great Lent reminds us to bear up the Cross of Christ bravely so that we may daily die with Christ in order to experience the Resurrection of our Lord, so also the mid-point of the Pentecostarion elightens us regarding the theme of the fifty days following Pascha - which is the acquisition of the Holy Spirit poured out as a gift upon all the faithful who partake of the living water which is Christ Himself.&quot;

Saint John the Damascene,&quot;drink a new drink,&quot;not brought forth from a barren rock,&quot;as in the Old Testament under Moses, but which rather&quot;springeth forth from the grave of Christ.&quot;Then during the Paschal Divine Liturgy the priest processes with the Gospel and chants loudly from Psalm 67:27 saying&quot;&quot;In the congregation bless ye God, the Lord of the well-spring of Israel.&quot;

&quot;Would that part of our choir were that company which of old chanted together with us a hymn to God, one neither feigned nor inglorious, but deemed worthy once of a place at His Eight Hand, and which I am confident, shall be again (after a little time) thought worthy of that same place: but which at present, from I know not what offence, stands aloof, and revolts from us, and doesn not even (what more astonishes me) through the influence of the common joy, come to meet together with us, but is holding a festive dance on its own account----one that is neither good in measure, nor danced to tune (for thus much, perhaps, even they themselves will allow me to remark)----but of what kind , and what a dance!! But if Zeal is moved to speak, yet Faith gets the upper hand, and I shall check the harshness of my speech out of respect for my hope. Still do I cherish my own members : still do I concede more to old love than to present jealousy, and for that reason I become too long-suffering than that I should upbraid them in warmer terms.&quot;

11

&quot;One party, one kind of souls, do I exclude from the festive assembly, though I groan and am pained, and grieved for them who perhaps understand me not, neither are sensible of their own ruin, whom I bewail (for this is the most pitiable of their affliction): nevertheless I exclude by proclamation, all who have not been sown upon the solid and immovable rock, but upon the dry and barren ground. These be they who having come unto the Word superficially, and though not having depth of earth, forthwith springing up and peeping forth, upon a brief assault of the Evil One, and a slight blast of persecution, have withered up and died away. And those yet worse than they, and still more worthy of exclusion from the festivity----all those who did not for even a little space hold out against the times and against those who were leading us into an evil captivity away from Him&quot;Who ascended up on high and made captives of us for our good;&quot;but these did superfluously show themselves good for nought, and mercenary, inasmuch as they did not resist even for a little while, but were straggling plants, though not even a slight affliction or trail had befallen them on account of the Word; but for the sake of temporary gain, or court-favour, or brief power, these wretched fellows bartered away their own salvation!&quot;

12

&quot;And now that we have purified by speech the entire body of our choir, let us sanctify ourselves both in body and in soul, and joining all together in one spirit, let us chant the song of triumph which Israel sang of old over the Egyptians overwhelmed in the Red Sea, while Miriam led the choir, and brandished high her timbrel.&quot;Let us sing unto the Lord, for He hath glorified Himself marvellously, the horse and the rider He hath cast&quot;(not into the sea, for this part of the song I alter, but)&quot;whither it was pleasing to Him, and in what way He thought it fit; the God that doeth and changeth all things&quot;(as saith somewhere in his prophecy, Amos, most divinely philosophizing).&quot;He that turneth into mourning the shadow of death, and that darkeneth the day into night,&quot;and Who, as it were, by means of a certain revolution, directs and corrects the whole world, as well as our affairs, whether tempest-tossed or not tempest-tossed, shaken and upset in its changes, and subject to constant vicissitudes, though by the ordering of His Providence they be fixed and not to be shaken, even though they move through contrary courses----ways that be clear unto the Word, although unknown to us.&quot;He that putteth down the mighty from their thrones, and adorneth with a crown him that expected it not&quot;(for this, too, I borrow from the Holy Scripture).&quot;Who clotheth the feeble knees with strenght, and breaketh the arm of the sinner and the wicked&quot;(this is from another song, just as each occurs in my recollection, there being many ready to complete my hymn, and to contribute their part to my song of thanksgiving).&quot;He that giveth to be seen of the ungodly both the exaltation above the cedars, and the plucking down into being no more; when we may be able with safety and swiftness of foot to escape from the ungodliness of the same.

&quot;Who shall sing these things as they deserve, and relate them amongst those who relate things divine?

Saint Gregory

13

&quot;Who shall sing these things as they deserve, and relate them amongst those who relate things divine?&quot;Who shall tell the mighty works of the Lord, shall make to be heard all his praises?&quot;What voice or what force of speech shall he find equal to the miracle? Who hath broken the shield, the sword, and the battle? Who hath bruised the heads of the dragon upon the waters, and given him for food unto the nations to whom Thou hast delivered him up? Who hath stilled the whirlwind into a breeze? Who hath said unto the sea, Be thou silent, be thou muzzled, and thy waves shall break themselves within thee? He Who hath crushed him that was lifted up and boiled furiously, but not for long. Who hath given us to walk upon serpents and scorpions, no longer lying secretly in wait for the heel of the passer-by (as the sentence directed), but publicly rising up and lifting on high the head that they were condemned to have trampled under foot? Who is He that hath made an unexpected condemnation an acquittal? Who is He that hath not completely&quot;suffered the rod of sinners&quot;(shall I venture to say)&quot;in the lot of the righteous&quot;(or, what is more modest than this expression) in the lot of those that know Him?

14

&quot;Fot it was not as righteous that we were delivered up to Him (for this is what few men, on few occasions, have experienced in order that they, like noble athletes, may put to shame him that tries their strenght, but as offenders who have been condemned, and afterwards pardoned out of His fatherly compassion; having been beaten only that we may be reformed, and admonished in order that we may turn unto Him.&quot;For He hath tried us, yet not in wrath; He hath chastised us, but not in anger;&quot;having manifested his loving-kindness through both things ----his admonition, and his remission. Who is he that hath wrought vengeance among the heathen, rebukes amongst the nations?&quot;&quot;Even the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.&quot;

15

&quot;I find but one voice, one song in any way worthy of the present occasion----that which Isaiah hathe shouted before us, exactly suited to the present times, and vying with the magnitude of the blessing:&quot;Let the heavens above rejoice, and let the clouds drop down righteousness; let the mountains break forth into joy, and let the little hills exult&quot;inasmuch as the whole creation and the heavenly powers, such, at least, is my opinion, take an equal interest in these events. For not only does the&quot;whole creation groan with us and is in the pangs of labour, being made subject to corruption&quot;(I mean to things below that are born and perish)&quot;expecting the end of these things and the revelation,&quot;in order that itself may then obtain the hoped-for deliverance, as being bound fast to them against its will through the power of Him who created it; but it also joins in glorifying Him, and exults together with the sons of God when they rejoice.&quot;

16

&quot;For this cause I will not refrain from sacred expressions when I am telling of Divine Power.&quot;Let the desert rejoice, and let her bloom like the lily&quot;(that is, the Church, which but yesterday seemed a widow, and husbandless, as well as everyone that was withered up by the envious and joyless winter of ungodliness), because the Lord hath had compassion upon His people, neither hath He abandoned His own inheritance;: because He hath done marvellous things, and His ancient, true councel, the which was to be favourable toward them that fear Him and that hope in His mercy, forasmuch as He hath broken down the gates of brass, and smitten asunder the bars of iron; because we have been humbled for our transgressions, and the snare has been broken, and we are set free, in the joy of the God that hath called us, and who comforts the lowly heart.&quot;

By the first way the soul becomes purified and so receives God; by the second way the God of whom the soul becomes aware Himself burns away every impurity and thus comes to dwell in the purified soul.&quot;St. Theophan the recluse Re: The Secret of the Universe

Continued from last Sunday

While thus the Catechists made compromising peace
with the poetry of SELFHOOD, ere the fight was won
in rescue of womenhood from the ravish of war,
a new era had dawn&apos;d and a new strain of song,
the young poetry of BREED; and the conflict therewith
is in my story styled the second Essene War.

&apos;Twas no Huns now that stirr&apos;d the Frankish heart to sing,
nay rather Athena&apos;s call, and the gracious emblems
of Hellenic humanity, that long had drown&apos;d
where they had sunk o&apos;erwhelm&apos;d in the wreckage of Rome,
undersuck&apos;d in the wallow, when Caesar&apos;s great ship
flounder&apos;d with all its toys in the decadent deep,
now freshly of their buoyancy up-struggling here and there
to ride in sparkling dance on the desolat sea:
Or what grave lore had refuged with the Ishmaelite
was stealing back from exile to its western home,
its mansions of birthright, and had now already inspired
passionat Abelard, who with his ethnic books
was heralding in Paris that full Renaissance
which should Illumin Europe, and plant her cities
with Universities of learning, sanctuaries
of spirit, our schools of thought and science to this day.

Full Springtime was not yet surely, nor soon to be:
&apos;twas a mayhap a ce jour de Saint Velintine
que chacun doit choisir son per, or a later day
of February, when in the shelter&apos;d woodland
the Sun with broaening smile thinketh to intercalate
a glad red-letter&apos;d feast in Winter&apos;s almanac,
which the thrush boldly announceththo&apos; the migrant birds
hav yet made no return upon the balmy sprays,
but the small homekeepers muster what choir they can:
Not elsewise was thatt first impetuous raid that storm&apos;d
the rear of the dark ages prematurely; and yet
the singers wer so may that man mareveleth stil
whence they came, or by what spontaneous impulse they sang.

As well might be with one who wendeth lone his way
beside the watchful d**es of the flat Frisian shore,
what hour the wading tribes, that make their home and breed
numberless on the marshy polders, creep unseen
widely dispersed at feed, and silent neath the sun
the low unfeatured landscape seemeth void of life
when without warning suddenly all the legion&apos;d fowl
rise from their beauties&apos; ambush in the reedy beds,
and on spredd wings with clamorous ecstacy
carillioning in the air maneuvre, and where they wheel
transport the broken sunlight, shoaling in the sky
with like sudden animation the fair fields of France
give birth to myriad poets and singers unknown,
who in a main flight gathering their playful flock
settled in Languedoc, on either side of the Rhone
within the court and county of Raymond of Toulouse.

Fifth Sunday of Pascha

Sunday of the Samaritan Women

Father Norman served the Matins, and Father Ceko the Holy Liturgy, leading the Congregation in ever devotional Pryer.

Spiritual Rebirth

&quot;The holy martyr Photina (Svetlana) ... was that Samaritan women who had the rare fortune to speak with the Lord Christ Himself at Jacobs Well in Sychar. (John 4) Coming to faith in the Lord, she then came to belief in the Gospel, together with her two sons, Victor and Josiah, and five sisters who were called Anatolia, Phota, Photida, Paraskeva and Kyriaka.&quot;

The last was the&quot;Sunday of the Lord&quot;, when the Samaritan Women came to the Well to meet Jesus after His Resurrection.

&quot;Water plays a big role in the story of the Samaritan women - water is used to describe or point to our salvation.

&quot;In this case, Christ said to her:

&quot;Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.&quot;

&quot;When Jesus spoke of giving water to the women at the well, He was telling her of the gift of the Holy Spirit.

&quot;SCRIPTURE calls the grace of the Spirit sometimes&quot;Fire,&quot;sometimes&quot;Water,&quot;showing that these names are not descriptive of its essence, but of its operation; for the Spirit, being Invisible and Simple, cannot be made up of different substances. Now the one John declares, speaking thus,&quot;He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with the Fire&quot;(Matthew 3:11): the other, Christ,&quot;Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.&quot;(John 7:38)&quot;But this,&quot;saith John, spake He of the Spirit, which they should receive.&quot;So also conversing with the women, He called the Spirit water; for,&quot;Whosoever shall drink of the water which I shall give him, shall never thirst.&quot;

St. John Crysostom, Homily 32, HOHN 4:13,14

&quot;Jesus saith unto her, Women, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in thruth.&quot;(John 4:21-24)&quot;

The Samaritan Women left her jar to fetch earthly water by the well and took with her the water of the Spirit to never again thirst.

From the Church Bulletin

Did you know? About Eternal Life...

&quot;The Orthodox Church doesn not believe merely in the immortality of the soul, and in the goodness and ultimate salvation of only spiritual reality. Orthodox Christians believe in the goodness of the human bod and of all material and physical creation. Thus in its faith in resurrection and eternal life, the Orthodox Church looks not to some&quot;other world&quot;for salvation, but to this very world so loved by God, resurrected and glorified by Him, filled with His own divine presence. At the ned of the ages God will reveal His presence and will fill all creation with Himself. For those who love Him it will be paradise. For those who hate Him it will be hell. And all physical creation, together with the righteous, will rejoice and be glad in His coming... When the Kingdom of God fills all creation, all things will be made new. This world will again be that paradise for which it was originally created. This is the Orthodox doctrine and the final fate of man and his universe. It is sometimes argued, however, that this world will be totally destroyed and that God will create everything new&quot;out of nothing&quot;by the act of a second creation. Those who hold this opinion appeal to such texts as that found in II Peter 3:10: But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens wil pass away...and the elements will be desolved with fire, and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up. Because the Bible never speaks about a&quot;second creation&quot;and because it continually and consistently witnesses that God loves the world which He has made and does everything that He can to save it, the Orthodox Tradition never interprets such scriptural texts as teaching the actuall annihilation of creation by God. It understands such texts as speaking metaphorically of the great catastrophe which creation must endure, including even the righteous, in order for it to be cleansed, purified, made perfect and saved. It teaches as well that there is an&quot;eternal fire&quot;for the ungodly, an eternal condition of their being destroyed. But in any case the&quot;trail by fire&quot;which&quot;destroys the ungodly&quot;is in no way understood by the Orthodox in the sense that creation is doomed to total destruction, despised by the loving Lord who created it and called it&quot;very good.&quot;

Fr. Thomas Hopko, excerpts from The Orthodox Faith.v.I Doctrine 

The ungodly may suffer now in the hellish hot desert never finding shade under the Tree at the cool Oasis nourished by the drinkable Water of the Well.

A profitable discourse on sobriety: &apos;Sobriety,&apos; in this case, is defined as, &apos;Remembrance of God; to consider ourselves to be, at the present moment, in the presence of the All-seeing God; To stand before God with the mind in the heart, aware of the fact that we are in the presence of God; And finally, to love God more in that moment, than any created thing.&apos;

From the Life of our Holy Father Antony

Once two brothers were on their way to St. Antony, and when all their water was gone, one died and the other was near to dying. Having no strength to go on, he lay on the ground and awaited death. Meanwhile St. Antony, seated on a mountain, called the monks who happened to be with him and told them: &apos;Take a jar of water and run along the road towards Egypt. There there are two men who were coming here; one of them is already dead, and the other too will die unless you hurry. This I saw when I was at prayer.&apos; Coming to the spot, the monks indeed found one man dead and they buried him; the other they revived with the water and brought him to the staretz. The distance was a day&apos;s walk.If anyone were to ask why St. Antony did not send them earlier, before the first one died, it would be an ill-judged question. Allowing the first brother to die was the business not of Antony but of God, Who gave this decision for the first and sent a revelation to Antony about the second. To St. Antony belongs only the miraculous deed that, seated on a mountain, he was sufficiently sober in heart to be found worthy for the Lord to reveal to him that which was a great distance from him. You see that, through sobriety of the heart, St. Antony was given divine vision and clairvoyance. For, according to the words of John of the Ladder, God appears to the mind in the heart, at first as a flame purifying its lover, and then as a light which illumines the mind and renders it God-like. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on May 4, 2010, 9:56am

Reading hours every morning, indeed, I read this story of St. Antony some time ago, being still and in the presence of God, or near Him by virtue of Sobriety, thereby others- and&quot;this Virtue&apos;s nature may be known: Now, practice, how to make the same thine own.&quot;

Sometimes I find so much of Interest that I barely have time to post. Today I came again upon St. Herman of Alaska:

&quot;A true Christian is made by faith and love toward Christ. Our sins do not in the least hinder our Christianity, according to the word of the Saviour Himself. He deigned to say: not the righteous have I come to call, but sinners to salvation; there is more joy in heaven over one who repents than over ninety righteous ones. Likewise concerning the sinful women who touched His feet. He deigned to say to the Pharisee Simon: to one who has love, a great dept is forgiven, but from one who has not love, even a small dept will be demanded. From these judgements a Christian should bring himself to hope and joy, and not in the least accept an inflicted despair. Here one needs the shielf of faith.&quot;

Orations of Saint Gregory

17

&quot;Do you mark how I weave my song out of sacred words and thoughts? and, as it were, with what belongs to others. I exalt and decorate myself, how I grow inspired by my joy? I spurn everything humble and human, cementing together and joining one thing with another, and bringing into one whole what belongs to the same spirit.&quot;

18

&quot;Aforetime the wonderful works of God were shown forth in Enoch translated, Isaiah caught up, Noah himself saved, and saving the names of the races; the whole world in a small bark escaping the deluge of the inhabitable land, in order that the earth might be adorned with more godly inhabitants; Abraham called, and honoured with a son in spite of his age, as a pledge of another promised Seed, and offering up his only begotten son as willing sacrifice, and receiving a miraculous victim instead of a son; the miraculous destruction of the wicked overwhelmed with fire and brimstone; the yet more miraculous deliverance; the Pillar of Salt that proclaimed the turning back again to sin; Joseph sold into slavery, fallen in love with, preserving his chastity, and receiving wisdom from God, and set free, and made a ruler, and dispensing corn in a higher stewardship; Moses thought worthy of talking with God and admonished, and making laws, and becoming a god unto Pharaoh, and leading forth Israel into the Land of Promise; the plagues of the destroyed Egyptians, and the preservation of the Israelites, who labored in the midst of these Egyptians; and the Sea retiring before the rod, and giving heed unto a word, and letting some pass along on dry land, whilst others, according to its proper nature, it overwhelmed.&quot;

19

&quot;And whatever other miracles came after these: the Pillar of Cloud giving shadow by day, the Pillar of Fire giving light by night, and both of them leading the way; the Bread rained down in the wilderness; the Meat sent down from heaven----the former proportioned to their need, the latter even above their need; the Water from the Rock----the one gushing forth, the other rendered sweet; Amalek overcome in battle, and that too by the ineffable and mystical gesture of the hand; the Sun standing still and the Moon stayed, and the Jordan cut in twain; and the walls shaken down by the walking round them of the priests and the sounding trumpets, and by the number that hath power; the Earth and the Fleece of Wool alternaely wetted and unmoistened; Strenght residing in hair----a match for a whole army; the few chosen by Lapping of Water, and trusting to conquer, and conquering according to their trust, that small number those many thousands. What need is there for me to reckon up one by one everything that was done through Christ Himself during His saving presence and dwelling in the flesh? And all the miracles that have been wrought after Him and through Him, by His holy Apostles and ministers of the Word? How many books and monuments tell their history!&quot;

Thousands of Books and Monuments, and thousands more related, the world over, Churches and Temples adorned with gold, silver, and precious Jewels, for which Kings, Queens, men and women gave all they owned in a Heartbeat but for the Grace and Glory of God, not because they were deluted but because their mind was rendered God-like.

Such a man was one of Seven Sons of the Holy Martyr Felicitas, Saint Januarius, commemorated today by the Church.

The benefit of practice. Saint Seraphim means that prayer is not thorough as long as we are self-conscious and aware that we are praying, and by repetition things are interiorized, then we pray in sleep.

Last night I dreamed I was writing about Jesus which could count for prayer, couldn&apos;t make out what I was writing but my soul was in a good place.

Related also is the dream the night before: I was driving up a hill and at some point I stopped, held my foot on the brake petal wondering if the car would roll backwards. At the same time my passenger pulled the handbrake to just before the cable snapping, which I was thinking - the cabel snapping, and he said, &apos;don&apos;t worry, it won&apos;t roll backwards&apos; and some other things.

If You Want To Avoid Cancer, Live Like A Monk

&quot;If you want to avoid cancer live like a monk. That is the inescapable conclusion from research into one of the world&apos;s most renowned monastic communities.

&quot;The austere regime of the 15,000 monks on Mount Athos, in northern Greece, begins with an hour&apos;s pre-dawn prayers and is designed to protect their souls.

&quot;Their low-stress existence and simple diet (no meat, occasional fish, home-grown vegetables and fruit) may, however, also protect them from more worldly troubles.

&quot;The monks, who inhabit a peninsula from which women are banned, enjoy astonishingly low rates of cancer.

&quot;Since 1994, the monks have been regularly tested, and only 11 have develped prostate cancer, a rate less than one quarter of the international average. In one study, their rate of lung and bladder cancer was found to be zero.

&quot;Haris Aidonopoulos, a urologist at the University of Thessalonika, said that the monks&apos; diet, which calls on them to avoid olive oil, dairy products and wine on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, helped to explain the statistics.&quot;

The key is alternating diets, plenty plant proteins, and eating&quot;the old fashion way&quot;.

&quot;The monks sit in silence while, from the pulpit passages from the Bible are read in Greek. They eat at speed - as soon as the Bible passage is over, the meal is officially completed.

&quot;The staples are fruit and vegetables, pasta, rice and soya dishes, and bread and olives. They grow much of what they eat themselves, Agioritiko red wine is made locally from mountain grapes.&quot;

Nice, these are my staples as well, save olives for which I never acquired a taste, though many love them, and my brother in law eats one jar at a time, and I should drink red wine sometimes.

A morsel for the soul from Saint Gregory

&quot;The Lord sets his face against the high-minded, and giveth grace unto the humble, and recompenseth contrary things unto the adversaries; He that meeteth out all things justly. Of this the divine David was well aware, and reckons as one of his blessings, the fact of his being chastened, and confesses his thankfulness to Him, Who had chastened; inasmuch as the learning the commandments accrued to himself therefrom. And,&quot;Before I was humbled (says he), I went astray: on this account I have kept Thy word,&quot;placing his humiliation in the middle between his transgression and correction, seeing that it arose out of the first, and produced the second, for sin is the parent of humiliation, and humiliation of repentance. So we, having been exalted when we were virtuous and orderly; and having grown up into this form and multitude through God&apos;s guidance,&quot;Waxed fat and kicked;&quot;and when we had spread ourselves out, we were pressed close; and the glory and strenght that we had gathered amidst persecutions and oppression, this when we prospered we brought to ruin&quot;.

Another quote from Saint Gregory:&quot;The Son is neither the name of an essence, nor of an energy; He is the name of a relationship&quot;.

Good guess that everyone knows, but best consult Orthodoxy, of

George the Trophy-bearer

&quot;The holy, glorious and rightvictorious Great-martyr and Trophy-bearer George was a Christian Roman soldier killed under Diocletian at the beginning of the fourth century. Though he was born in Cappadocia, his mother was from Palestine, and thus he is a particular favorite of many Palestine Christians. He is also patron saint of Moscow, Georgia, and England, amongst other places.&quot;

 George and the dragon 

&quot;St. George is often depicted with a dragon or some other serpentine creature under his feet. This comes from a legend whose details may very according to local tradition. The tale begins with the dragon making its nest at the spring (or lake) that provided a town (either near Beirut or Silena, Libya, often) with water. Consequently, the citizens had to temporarly remove the dragon from its nest in order to collect water. To do so, they offered the dragon a human sacrifice. The victim of the day was chosen by drawing lots. Eventuall, the&quot;winner&quot;of this lottery happened to be the local princess. The local monarch is occasionally depicted begging for her life with no result. She is offered to the dragon, but at this point a traveling George arrives. He faces the dragon, and, after invoking the name of the Holy Trinity, slays it and saves the princess. The grateful citizens then abandon their ancestral paganism and convert to Christianity.&quot;

No secret is the following:

&quot;The story may or may not be taken literally. For example, the battle between George and the dragon may represent the battle between Christianity and Satan or between St. Michael, the archangel, and Lucifer. Dragon-slaying does appear to be a common theme; it may be the case that George has served as a Christianized version of older Indo-European deities and their folklore.

&quot;After the fall of Constantinople and the association of St. George with the crusades, he is more often portrayed mounted on a white horse. At the same time St. George began to be associated with St. Demetrius, another Roman soldier . The two saints are often portrayed together mounted upon horses; in this respect they are likened to earthly manifestations of the Archangels Michael and Gabriel. (Equating George with Michael is understandable, as many icons of Michael also portray him on a horse slaying a dragon.) St. george is always depicted upon a white horse and St. Demitrius on a red horse (or black horse where the pigment used has decayed).&quot;

Thank God for Saint George,&quot;the origial Knight in shining Armour&quot;saving the&quot;Princess&quot;.

There is a link from Orthowiki to wikipedia.org, replete with familiar history.

&quot;In 1969, Saint George &apos;s feast day was reduced to an optional memorial in the Roman Catholic calendar, and the solemnity of his commemoration depends on purely observance. He is, however, still honoured as a saint of major importance by Eastern Orthodoxy.

&quot;His feast day, April 23, is the day of Aragon (Spain) and is also a holiday in Catalonia, where it is traditional to give a rose and a book to the loved one. This, together with the anniversary of the deaths, in 1616, of Cervantes and Shakespeare, has led UNESCO to declare April 23 World Book and Copyright Day.&quot;

&quot;But in the case of man, hard as it is for him to learn how to submit to rule, it seems far harder to know how to rule over man, and hardest of all, with this rule of ours, which leads them by the divine law, and to God, for its risk is, in the eyes of a thoughtful man, proportionate to its height and dignity. For, first of all, he must, like silver or gold, though in general circulation in all kinds of seasons and affairs, never ring false or alloyed, or give token of any inferior matter, needing further refinement in the fire; or else, the wider his rule, the greater evil he will be. Since the injury which extends to many is greater than that which is confined to a single individual.

&quot;For it is not so easy to dye deeply a piece of cloth, or to impregnate with odours, foul or the reverse, whatever comes near to them; nor is it so easy for the fatal vapour, which is rightfully called a pestilence, to infect the air, and through the air to gain access to living being, as it is for the vice of a superior to take most speedy possession of his subjects, and that with far greater facility than virtue its oppsite. For it is in this that wickedness especially has the advantage over goodness, and most distressing it is to me to perceive it, that vice is something attractive and ready at hand, and that nothing is so easy as to become evil, even without anyone to lead us on to it; while the attainment of virtue is rare and difficult, even where there is much to attract and encourage us. And it is this, I think, which the most blessed Haggai had before his eyes, in his wonderful and most true figure:&quot;Ask the priest concerning the law, saying: If holy flesh borne in a garment touch meat or drink or vessel, will it sanctify what is in contact with it? And when they said No; ask again if any of these things touch what is unclean, does it not at once partake of the pollution? For they will surely tell you that it does partake of it, and does not continue clean in spite of the contact.&quot;

&quot;What does he mean by this? As I take it, that goodness can with difficulty gain a hold upon human nature, like fire upon green wood; while most men are ready and disposed to join in evil, like stubble, I mean, ready for a spark and a wind, which is easily kindled and consumed from its dryness. For more quickly would anyone take part in evil with slight inducement to its full extent, than in good which is fully set before him to a slight degree. For indeed a little wormwood most quickly imparts its bitterness to honey; while not even double the quantity of honey can impart its sweetness to wormwood: and the withdrawel of a small pebble would draw headlong a whole river, though it would be difficult for the strongest dam to restrain or stay its course.&quot;

I once saw a perfect and pure heavenly movement rejecting anything unequal to Itself, could never be touched by anything impure or &apos;alloyed&apos;, seemed not even aware of any such.

Church Calendar

Mark the Evangelist, He with the Lion

&quot;The holy, glorious and all-laudable Apostle and Evangelist Mark is the author of of the Gospel of Mark, the companion of the Apostle Paul (as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles), and numbered among the Seventy Apostles. He is often referred to as John Mark, and is the founder of the Church of Alexandria, being regarded as its first pope. As a result, he is also particularly venerated by the Coptic Church as its founder, as well. His symbol as one of the four evangelists is the lion.

&quot;His name was John, as the Holy Bible says:&quot;He came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together in prayer&quot;(Acts 12:12). He was the one whom the Lord Christ, to Whom is the glory, meant when He said:&quot;Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says,&quot;My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.&quot;(Matthew 26:18)

&quot;His house was the first Christian Church, where they ate the Passover, hid after the death of the Lord Christ, and in its upper room the Holy Spirit came upon them.

&quot;This apostle was born in Cyrene (one of the five western cities, Pentapolis, in North Africa). His father&apos;s name was Aristopolus, his mother&apos;s name was Mary and he was a kinsman of the Apostle Barnabas. They were Jewish in faith, rich and of great honor. They educated him with the Greek and Hebrew cultures. He was called Mark after the immigrated to Jerusalem, where St. Peter had become a disciple of Jesus Christ. St. Peter was married to the cousin of Aristopolus. Mark visited St. Peter&apos;s house often, and from him he learned the Christian teachings.&quot;

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Apostle_Mark 

&quot;A number of traditions have built up around Mark, though none can be verified from the New Testament. Trditionally, Mark is said to be the man who carried water to the house where the Last Supper took place.

&quot;Coptic Church tradition additionally states that Mark is the one who hosted the disciples in his house after the death of Jesus, into whose house the resurrected Jesus Christ came (John 20), and into whose house the Holy Spirit descended on the disciples at Pentecost. Mark is also believed to be one of the servants at the Marriage at Cana who pured out the water that Jesus turned into wine (John 2:1-11), and was one of the Seventy Apostles sent out by Christ (Luke 10:1).&quot;

At the Alhambra Cathedral, it is a women servant who purs the water at Cana and Christ blesses her with a smile. (As said before)

The Bible
Saint Mark 14

13 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.

14 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples.

15 And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.

Saint Mark stands tall in a Russian Orthodox Icon at the Church of Transfiguration, Kizhi Monastery, you may remember, or klick on Kizhi under the Icon.

And, of course, Saint Mark Basilica in Venice of Byzantine design and gilded Byzantine Mosaics, millions of them, methinks.

Church of Cyprus

Apostles Mark, and Barnabas whose birth name was Joseph,&quot;but the Apostles called him Barnabas (son of consolation) because he was gifted at comforting people&apos;s souls&quot;, brought Christianity to Cyprus.

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Church_of_Cyprus 

&quot;The Orthodox Church in Cyprus was founded by St. Barnabas the Apostle in 46 A.D., and was under the Jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem up until 325, and became Autocephalous in 413. The Episcopal Seat is under the Archbishop Chrysostom II of New Justina and Cyprus.

&quot;In 478, the grave of St. Barnabas was found, with a copy of the Gospel of Matthew on his relics. The autocephaly of the Church of Cyprus was confirmed later by the Roman Emperor Zeno who granted its Archbishop&quot;three privileges,&quot;that is: to sign his name in cinnabar, to wear purple instead of black under his vestments, and to use an emperial scepter instead of the episcopal crosier.&quot;

I like both, the Scepter and the Crosier.

A good weekend, and &apos;Happy Mothers Day&apos;

.... the fair fields of France
gave birth to myriad poets and singers unknown,
who in a main flight gathering their playful flock
settled in Languedoc, on either side of the Rhone
within the court and county of Raymond of Toulouse.

Nor wer these Troubadours hucksters of song who tuned
their pipes for fee: some far glimpse of the heav&apos;nly Muse
had reached and drawn the soul by the irresistible
magnet of love: as when in the blockish marble
the sculptor&apos;s thought of beauty loomed into shape
neath his rude hammerstrokes, ere the true form is seen;
so had the monks&apos; rough-hewing of the old pagan tales
discover&apos;d virtue:an Ideal of womenhood
had striven into outline; which, tho&apos; passion heeded not
yet art had grasp&apos;d, divining fresh motiv for skill,
whereby knights, churchmen, monks, courtiers and scholars all
childishly wer enthrall&apos;d: ev&apos;n kings found honor in rhyme
whose loyalty is today its only honor, and to us
would seem frivolity, knew we not that we watch
beside the rocking-cradle of babes, whose prattling tongues
shoul oust monarchic Latin from his iron throne
which not the slaughter of this one innocent coud save:
Skysoarers should be rear&apos;d of such young flutterers;
for whom two freaks of fortune happily conspired,
a fine phantasy of spirit with light fabric of art;
so the faint dream of chivalry, as it took-on form,
tripp&apos;d delicatly with the delicat music
of the tentativ language, whose mincing metres
imposed good manners on the articulation of speech.

While in such play Count Raymond&apos;s folk lived joyfully,
Provence seem&apos;d to mankind the one land of delight,
a country where a man might fairly choose to dwell;
tho&apos; some would rather praise the green languorous isles,
Hawaii or Samoa, and some the bright Azores,
Kashmir the garden of Ind, or Syrian Lebanon
and flowery Carmel; or wil vaunt the unstoried names
of Africa Nairobi, where the Nyanza&apos;s lakes
Nile hid his flooding fountain, or in the New World
far Pasadena&apos;s roseland, whence who saileth home
westward wil in his calendar find a twin day.

But I in England starving neath the unbroken glooms
of thatt dreariest November which wrapping the sun,
damping all life, had robb&apos;d my poem of the rays
whose wealth so far had sped it, I long&apos;d but to be
i&apos; the sunshine with my history; and the names that held
place in my heart and now shall hav place in my line
wer Avignon, Belcair, Montelimar, Narbonne,
Beziers, Castelnaudary, Bearn and Carcasonne,
and truly I could have shared their fancy coul I hav liv&apos;d
among those glad Jongleurs, living again for me,
and had joy&apos;d with them in thatt liberty and good-will
which men call toleration, a thing so stiff to learn
that to the sceptics &apos;tis left and cynics. In Provence
Jew quarrel&apos;d not with Gentile; ther was peace and love
&apos;twixt Saracen and Christians, Catalon and Frank;
and (wonder beyond wonder) here was harbour&apos;d safe&apos; flourishing and multiplying, thatt sect of all sects
abominable, persecuted and defamed, who with their Eastern chaffering and insidious talk
had ferreted thru&apos; Europe to find peace on earth
with Raymond of Toulouse,those ancient Manichees.

Good Monday Morning,

The Church Service was profound and very wonderful yesterday. Fr. Ceko served the Matins and Holy Liturgy continually calling down Blessing and Grace, giving Thanks and praying for Mercy for God&apos;s Children, His Inheritance.

The reading was about the blind man, blind from birth, whom Jesus healed,&quot;He spat on the ground and made clay with saliva; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. And He said to him,&quot;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam&quot;(which is translated, Sent). So he went and washed, and came back seeing.&quot;

Father Ceco commented that&quot;Sent&quot;to the pool means that one who is &apos;Sent&apos; to the pool becomes a co-worker with with Jesus and his eyes will be opened,&quot;As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the World.&quot;Saliva is a healing agent, Salvation. Almost half of the year we spend on emphasizing the Resurrection, Fr. Ceko said,&quot;we are to be risen and transformed by the Word of the Scripture&quot;, in the&quot;fullness of time&quot;. Good news is also that Father Ceko finally called me, we spoke a few words outside the Church and He said He will contact me soon.

Sunday&apos;s Hymns

RESURRECTIONAL TROPARION - TONE FIVE:

Let us, the faithful, praise and worship the Word, co-eternal with the Father and the Spirit; born for our salvation from the Virgin. For He willed to be lifted up on the Cross in the flesh, to endure death, and to raise the dead, by His Glorious Resurrection.

THE BLIND MAN KONTAKION - TONE FOUR

I come to You, O Christ, blind from birth in my spiritual eyes, and call to You in repentance:&quot;You are the most radiant Light of those in darkness.&quot;

Reminds me of Fern&apos;s words that the minute we are born we are spiritually dead, and in His poem&quot;INCIPIT&quot;the divine Poet writes &apos;not dimly are we aware in an all-knowing sentient deep, where life is merged with Being as the light of the stars during day - then a soft enquiring troubles our quiet, we stir with old desiring and lean to earth, draw in and loose our sight, and with a terrible cry the spirit dims&apos;.

Remembering also Steven&apos;s question: &apos;what did your face look like before your Parents begot you?

Two Kinds of Time

&quot;In English, we are somewhat restricted in talking and thinking about time, partly due to the general lack of adequate words to express transcendent experience, and partly because we have just one word for &apos;time - whoch generally refers to chronological, calendar time as measured by the clock. However, in the Greek language, with its inherent thought patterns, the language in which the New Testament was written and the Eastern Fathers thought and wrote, there are two words for time.&quot;Chronos&quot;(as in &apos;chronological&apos;) is the Greek word for the earthly, temporal, measurable clock time where we live our everyday lives. Chronos time and space are chief characteristics of God&apos;s created world and therefore are not bad in themselves, but are to be redeemed, along with everything else in the fallen world&quot;.

The secondary word for time in Greek&quot;kairos&quot;,&quot;refers to what we might describe as &apos;Eternal&apos; or &apos;Divine time,&apos; or &apos;&apos;Transfigured time,&apos; or &apos;redeemed time&apos; - a realm wherein we step outside of&quot;transend clock time. &apos;Kairos&apos; time is the realm of artistic creativity, wherein one &apos;stands outside oneself,&apos; and is caught up into another ealm or level of existance. &apos;Kairos time is the present now time: &apos;Today Christ is born! Today Christ is risen! This is the day of salvation! &apos;Kairos times is also the &apos;fullness of time,&apos; when the Eternal breaks into and penetrates our fallen earthly existence, transfiguring it and us, wherein we are granted the gift of temporarly catch a glimpse of standing in the presence of God. This is the realm of what might be called &apos;religious experience&apos;or having a &apos;personal experience&apos; of God; it is the present moment of repentance and conversion. We have stepped into &apos;Kairos&apos; time when we are &apos;caught up&apos; and don&apos;t even notice the passage of &apos;chronos&apos; time.&quot;

I think we all have experienced such time-less moments being&quot;caught up&quot;by some profoud experience Below and Above, unaware of Chronos time until we&quot;come too&quot;and marvel what that was all about.

Time is too long for those who grieve
Time is too short for those who love

From the weekly Church Bulletin section

Did you know?

&quot;As the eternally-born of God and always existing Father in the&quot;timeless generation,&quot;the Son is truly&quot;Light of Light, True God of True God.&quot;For God is Light and what is born of Him must be Light. And God is true God, and what is born of Him must be True God. We know from the created order of things that what is born must be essentially the same as what gives birth. If one comes from the very being of another, one must be the very same thing. He cannot be essentially different. Thus men give birth to men, and birds to birds, fish to fish, flowers to flowers. If God, then,in the super-abundant fullness and perfection of His divine being gives birth to a Son, the Son must be the same as the Father in all thingsexcept, of course, in the fact of his being the Son. Thus, if the Father is divinely and eternally perfect, true, wise, good, loving and all of the things we know God is&quot;&quot;ineffable, inconceiveable, invisible, ever-existing and eternally the same&quot;(to quote the texts of the Liturgy...), then the Son must be all of these things as well. To think that what is born of God must be less than God, says one saint of the Church, is to dishonor God. The Son is&quot;begotten not made, of one essence with the Father.&quot;&quot;Begotten not made&quot;may also be put&quot;born and not created.&quot;Everything which exists beside God is created by Him: all things visible and invisible. But the Son of God is not a creature. He was not created by God nor made by Him. He was born, begotten, generated from the very being and nature of the Father. It belongs to the very nature of Godto God as Godaccording to divine revelation as understood by the Orthodox, that God is an eternal Father by nature, and that He should always have with Him his eternal, uncreated Son. It belongs to the very nature of God that He should be such a being if He is truly and perfectly divine. It belongs to God&apos;s very divine nature that He should not be eternally alone in His divinity, but that His very being as Love and Goodness should naturally&quot;overflow itself&quot;and&quot;reproduce itself&quot;as the Apostle Paul has called him (Colossians 1:13)... The Son of God born of the Father before all ages, is not created. He was not made out of nothing. He was eternally begotten from the divine being of the Father. He belongs&quot;on the side of God.&quot;

Thanks be to God for all things, and for a new and good day

Saints, Apostles, and Monasteries

Remembered today on the Church Calendar

Saint Basil of Ostrog

A Father among the Saints and Miracle-worker, Basil of Ostrog and Tvrdos,&quot;was the Serbian Metropolitan of Zahum and Herzegovina from 1639 to 1671.&quot;

Early life

&quot;St. Basil was born in Mrkonjie, a village in Herzegovina, of simple and God-fearing parents named Peter and Ana Jovanovic. His baptismal name was Stojan (Crojah). From his youth he was filled with love for the Church of God. He was taught the Holy Scriptures in the Zavala Monastery. His teacher was Serafim, the monastery&apos;s igumen. When Stojan reached maturity, Fr. Serafim sent him to the Monastery of the Dormation (Assumption) of the Theotokos (Tvrdos), near Trebinje. Stojan was tensured a monk with the name Basil and was then ordained a presbyter. As a monk, he quickly became renowned because of his genuine and rare ascetical life. Soon he was raised to archimandrite. Saint Basil took upon himself mortification upon mortification, each one heavier and more difficult than the last. He spent one year at Mount Athos.&quot;

An Igumen is the head of a Monastery; He who is in charge; and Archimandrite a Shepherd of the flock.

&quot;The miracles at the grave of St. Basil are without number. Christians and Muslims alike come before his relics and find healing of their most grave illnesses and afflictions. A great people&apos;s assembly (pilgrimage) occurs there annually on the Feast of Pentecost.&quot;

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Basil_of_Ostrog 

Please click on&quot;Ostrog Monastery&quot;for a great view

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_of_Ostrog 

Saint Basil of Ostrog distinct from Saint Basil the Great, Cappadician Father and one of the three Great Hierarchs with Saint Chrysostom and Gregory the Theologian, the latter I wrote a bit on this page. Then there is Saint Basil Fool for Christ, to whom is dedicated Saint Basil Cathedral in Moscow. The latter Saint Basil and the cathedral requires an extra page.

Yesterday were honered Sts. Jason and Sosipater the Apostles.

&quot;These Saints and Apostles of the first century, celebtated today, are especially interesting because of the archaeology that supports their history as enlighteners of the island of Kerkyra (known also as Corfu).

&quot;They arrived on the island of Kerkyra about 40 AD and we are told they are responsible for Christianizing the island, one of the first cities in all Greece to be Christianized.

&quot;The first two among the Seventy Apostles, and the last was the daughter of the king of Corfu. The Apostle Paul mentions Jason and Sosipater (Rom. 16:21), and calls them his kinsmen.

&quot;Jason was born in Tarsus, as was the Apostle Paul himself, and Sosipater in Achaea. The first was nominated by the Apostles as Bishop of Tarsus and the second as Bishop of Iconium.

Traveling and preaching the Gospel, these two apostles came to the island of Cofu, where they succeeded in building a church dedicated to St. Stephen the Protomartyr and in bringing some unbelievers to the Church.&quot;

Saint Stephen the Protomartyr, perhaps therefore pictured as a young man, was a convert from among Hellenistic Jews and related to Saint Paul.

Apolytikion in the Third Tone

Oh Holy Apostles, intercede to our merciful God, that He may grant our souls forgiveness of sins.

Kontakion in the Plagal of the Second Tone

Being illuminated with the teachings of Paul, ye became luminaries unto the whole world, O trice blessed ones; for ye ever shine upon the world with miracles, O Jason, thou fountain of healing, and Sosipater, thou glory of the Martyrs of Christ. O God-bearing Apostles, ye protectors of them that be in need, entreat God that our souls be saved.&quot;

Today is a Great Feast Day, fourty days after Pascha.

Ascension of our Lord

&quot;Fourty days after Resurrection, while blessing His disciples (Gospel of Luke 24:50-51), Christ ascended into heaven, taking His place at the right hand of the Father (Gospel of Mark 16:19 and Nicene-Constantinople Creed.&quot;

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Ascension 

Commentary on May 13

&quot;I ascend unto My Father and to My God, and Your God (John 20:17).

&quot;In these words the risen Christ described to Mary Magdalene the mystery of His Resurrection. She had to carry this mysterious message to His disciples,&quot;as they morned and wept&quot;(Mark 16:10). The disciples listened to these glad tidings with fear and amazement, with doubt and mistrust. It was not Thomas alone who doubted among the Eleven. On the contrary, it appears that only one of the Eleven did not doubt - St. John, the disciple&quot;whom Jesus loved.&quot;He alone grasped the mystery of the empty tomb at once:&quot;and he saw and believed&quot;(John 20:8). Even Peter left the sepulcher in amazement,&quot;wondering at that which was come to pass&quot;(Luke 24:12).&quot;

Neither the disciples nor the women who came to anoint Him&quot;with spices they had prepared&quot;expected the Resurrection.&quot;Mary Magdalene&quot;whom Jesus loved more than any other disciple,&quot;was sorrowful and complained:&quot;They have taken away my Lord, and I knw not where they have laid Him (John 20:13).

&quot;From whence this&quot;hardness of heart&quot;and hesitation? Why were their eyes so&quot;holden&quot;, why were the disciples so much afraid of the news, and why did the Easter joy so slowly, and with such difficulty, enter the Apostles&apos; heart? - The news of the Resurrection brought by the women only&quot;astonished&quot;them. They still wait for an earthly triumph, for an external victory.&quot;

Even earlier, the Apostles wondered,&quot;How is it that thou will manifest Thyself unto us, and not unto the world?&quot;(John 14:22). Their wonder continues, and even on the day of His glorious Ascension, the Apostles questioned the Lord,&quot;Lord, will thou at this time restore again the kingdom of Israel?&quot;(Acts 1:6). They still did not comprehend the meaning of His Resurrection, they did not understand what it meant that He was ascending to His Father. Their eyes were opened later, when&quot;the promise of the Father&quot;had been fulfilled.&quot;

Saint Chrysostom:

&quot;He was not always with them now, as He was before the Resurrection. He came and again disappeared, thus leading them on to a higher conception. He no longer permitted them to continue in their former relationship toward Him, but took effectual measures to secure these two objects: The fact that His Resurrection should be believed, and that He Himself should be ever after be apprehended to be greater than man.&quot;

&quot;The Ascention is the token of the Pentecost, the sign of its coming,&quot;The Lord has ascended to heaven and will send th Comforter to the world.

&quot;&quot;And unto the world He gives quickening forces through His human body,&quot;says Bishop Theophanes.&quot;He holds it completely in Himslf and penetrates it with all His strenght, out of Himself; and He likewise draws the angels unto Himself through the spirit of man, giving them space for action and thus making them blessed.&quot;All this is done thrue the Church, which is the&quot;the Body of Christ,&quot;that is, His&quot;fullness&quot;(Ephesians 1:23).&quot;The Church is the fullness of Christ,&quot;continues Bishop Yheophanes,&quot;perhaps in the same way as the tree is the fullness of the seed. That which is contained in the seed in a contracted form receives its development in the tree.&quot;

The night before last, in a dream, a &apos;tall&apos; man, in the sense of&quot;Man of Renown&quot;was standing with me. Twice I heard someone say the man was Tree number ? I forgot. The man said to me,&quot;I will come for Thanksgiving&quot;, which surprised me and made me glad. Then I saw a&quot;normal&quot;man who also said things I forgot, but it seemed both were the same man, but there was more to it. I am constantly thinking about the things I read and learn so maybe it carries over into my dreams.

This article I quoted from is very informative when read with attention, worth reading.

Hieromonk Damascene: Christ the Eternal Tao talk
Date:
Tuesday, May 18, 2010
Time:
8:00pm - 10:00pm
Location:
Kerckhoff Grand Salon UCLA Campus

This is the first major event for UCLA&apos;s Orthodox Christian Fellowship!

--Father Damascene, a past follower of Taoism and now an Eastern Orthodox monk, will be giving a talk about the similarities and connections between Taoism and Christianity.

&quot;Christ the Eternal Tao presents the Tao Teh Ching as a foreshadowing of what would be revealed by Christ, and Lao Tzu himself as a Far-Eastern prophet of Christ the incarnate God.&quot;

With its unfolding of spiritual history and practical, time tested advice on how to unite oneself with the Incarnate Tao and acquire Uncreated Teh, this talk will cover ground for the opening of ones interior life. It will be a long awaited Answer for those who, having turned away from modern Western religiosity, are drawn to the freshness, directness and simplicity of Lao Tzu and eastern philosophies, and at the same time are strangely, inexplicably drawn back to the all-compelling reality of Jesus Christ.

It&apos;s FREE!

Email me at epettygrove@ucla.edu for any questions.

PS. Directions to Kerckhoff Salon:

Take Westwood Blvd until it dead ends into the school.

 Belgrade, Serbia - The formal glorification of the newly canonized Saints was completed at the Holy Hierarchical Liturgy on Sunday, May 2, 2010 at the St. Save Temple on Vracar. The Holy Hierarchial Liturgy was officiated by His Holiness Patriarch Irinej of Serbia with the con-celebration of the Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church.&quot;These two are our joy before the Lord, the joy of our Church and the Universal Church,&quot;said His Eminence Metropolitan Amphilohije of Montenegro and the Coastlands in his homily.

&quot;In the year 1937 the venerable Fr. Justin, then professor at the University, met with the elder Symeon at his catacomb, at the Monastery he, with God inspiration, revealed and built. He met with him and wrote: is it possible that in our country exist such light and such a lighthouse? He wrote concerning him that he is the conscience of Montenegro. He felt before him the scent of Christ. And Fr. Justin wrote that he was caressed by the love of the elder&apos;s humble person, consecrated by the Holy Spirit. The two Saints of God met and recognized each other, vessels of God&apos;s grace. Fr. Justin who, just as we sing to him, had the God-man as a measure of all things and the elder Symeon, who also wrote that a pure heart sees God and that the Holy Spirit is He who sanctifies the Universe and everything and all. It was a time of crucifixion of the Church of Christ and a time when the Venerable Symeon of Dajbabe lived and a time that the Venerable Fr. Justin of Celije lived. Their names are inscribed in the Book of Life. Numbered among the Saints bless this holy church, and all of us, the people of St. Sava, all people and all nations. Through their prayers, Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit, enliven us, sanctify and confirm in all our days of our life unto the ages of ages.

&quot;The Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church at its session on April 29th 2010 proclaimed two new Saints of the Serbian Orthodox Church: the Venerable Justin of Celije and Symeon of Dajbabe. Venerable Justin will be venerate on June 1st/14th, and Venerable Symeon on March 19th/April 1st.&quot;

The Bishop shown alone is His Grace, Bishop Maxim of the Alhambra Cathedral.

Feeling&quot;the scent of Christ&quot;defines that which was all about the officiating Bishop while censing the Congregation repeatetly during the Holy Liturgy on Orthodox Sunday, of which I said: methought I saw it; and&quot;caressed by the love of the elder&apos;s humble person&quot;, defines what I felt when standing next to the elder visiting Priest and wrote that I wished to keep standing beside Him.&quot;The two Saints of God met and recognized each other, vessels of God&apos;s grace&quot;, is a confirmation of two people meeting, saying &apos;we recognized each&apos;, and much scoffed at, and is measured the same way as with the Saints because the recognition occurs instataneously and Entire.

April 2009, President Obama in Constatinople

President Obama and His All Holiness Bartholomew I, Patriarch of Constantinople. You might remember His Holiness from&quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

&quot;On his trip, President Obama was able to visit some tourist attractions in Constantinople as well, including a visit to Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque. While inside Hagia Sophia President Obama and Turkey&apos;s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan received information from the curator of the museum. Obama, as he stood under a fresco of the Virgin Mary, told reporters that he found the museum&quot;Spectacular&quot;.

&quot;A White House aide said that the President&apos;s seperate meeting with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I had an interesting note. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I went through a long list of items accomplished by the President on his trip, congratulated him on a successful speech to the Turkish Parliment, for instance. After going through this list, Patriarch Bartholomew I said,&quot;Oh - and by the way: congratulations on North Carolina.

&quot;Presient Obama had picked the UNC Tarheels to win the NCAA college basketbal tournament, which the team did last night. The President, according to the White House aide, laughed and smiled.&quot;

The Patriarch found our President&quot;very unassuming, very friendly, humble, and I was impressed with his simplicity&quot;, adding that the US President was pleased&quot;when I congratulated him because his team, North Carolina, won yesterday&apos;s basketball game - was impressed that I knew of it, - and in that pleasant atmosphere we parted.&quot;

This being surprised of what His Grace, Fr. Ceko, Fr. Norman, and other Priest know, past and present, happens to me all the time, and as evident, Steven seems to know all that was and is happening.

His Holiness&quot;sent an icon of the Prophet Baruch (patron of the President)&quot;to Obama&quot;with a handwritten inscription.&quot;

&quot;Most Greek newspapers&quot;reported that America wanted to keep the meeting confidential&quot;, and that&quot;no pictures were taken&quot;, but there it is

TWO NEWLY CANONIZED SAINTS

 http://www.saintstevens.org/ 



The Divine Poet

Restless and impatient man&apos;s mind is ever in quest
of some system or mappemond or safeguard of soul,
and coming not at truthev&apos;n as a dry-athirst horse
that drinketh eagerly of the first gilded puddle,
he espouseth delusion and sweareth fealty thereto:
and since common conditions breed common opinion,
nations lie fascinated in their swaddling clothes
cramped, and atrophied with their infantile suctions.
So in the inmost sanctum in the Hindu mind
a milch-cow is enshrined: : but those dour Manichees
wer trifling with no symbols; their wild faith had grown
deep-rooted on the prime obsession of savagery,
thatt first terrifying nightmare of dawning conscience
which, seeing in natur a power maleficent to man,
estopp&apos;d his growth in love: for these zealots ascribed
this visible work to the work of a devil,
from all time Goddes foe and enemy to all good:
In hate of which hellpower so worthy of man&apos;s defiance
they had lost the old fear, and finding internecine war
declared twixt flesh and spirit in the authentic script
of Paul of Tarsus, him they took for master, and styled
themselves Pauliciansthe depositaries of Christ.

Their Creedbetter than other exonerating God
from blame of eviland their austere asceticism
shamed the half-hearted clerics, whose licence in sin
confirm&apos;d the uncompromising logic, which inferr&apos;d
a visible earthly Church to be Satan&apos;s device,
the Pope his minister,him, the third Innocent,
who held his wide ambition for the will of God,
his fulminating censure for the voice of Christ;
and, troubled now that he could neither cleanse nor cure,
persuade not nor command, fell; and betray&apos;d by zeal
(as angry Peter once to serve Christ with the sword),
preach&apos;d a Crusade within the fold,thatt bloody wrath
label&apos;d in history The Albigensian war,
a sinking millstone heavy as ever pontiff tied
round the neck of the Church. For the champions of Christ
outdid the heathen Huns in cruelty, and in the end
was Raymond&apos;s county ravaged to ruin and his folk
massacred all or burnt alive, man women and child,
and their language wiped out, so that a man today
reading Provencal song studieth in a dead tongue.

Yet many Troubadours escaped from slaughter
fled to the Italian cities where the New Learning
gave kind asylum to their secret flame; and ere
within the Church&apos;s precincts they had raised a song,
Chivalry had won acceptance in the ideal of sex
and, blending with the worship of the Mother of God,
assured the consecration of MARRIAGE, still unknown
save to the christian folk of Europe whence it sprang.

Thus, as it came to pass, the second Essene War
brought the New Life in which full soon Dante was born.

 SEVENTH SUNDAY OF PASCHA; CELEBRATING THE ASCENTION OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST, AND COMMEMORATING THE FATHERS OF THE FIRST ECUMENICAL COUNCIL 

Yesterday in Church I thought about the meeting of Patriarch &apos;Bartholomew&apos; and President Obama in Constantinople mentioned in my last post, for we pray for&quot;the President of the United States and servants in public office who really really need it - our Senators et all and the pathetic State of Affairs. Anyway, I don&apos;t know our President&apos;s religious affiliation but I think He should join the Orthodox Church. Why do I say this? Because - you have to go to this Church even for a while and read up on the Saints etc., to glean&quot;The Secrets of the Universe&quot;, and given the naturally brilliant as well as educated Mind, disposition, temperament, command and use of language of our President, He would learn swiftly and Humanity would greatly benefit.

Ascention Kontakion - Tone Six:

When you had fulfilled the dispensation for our sake, and united earth to heaven: You ascended in glory, O Christ our God, not being parted from those who love You, but remaining with them and crying:&quot;I am with you and no one will be against you!&quot;

Holy Fathers Troparion - Tone Eight:

The apostle&apos; preaching and the fathers&apos; doctrines have established one faith for the Church. Adorned with the robe of truth, woven from heavenly theology, it defines and glorifies the great mystery of piety.

The&quot;Holy Fathers are lights on earth&quot;. A few weeks ago I printed the precepts of the First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea in 325, attended by 380 Holy Fathers, among them our Saint Spyridon, but haven&apos;t had a chance to post them yet.

Hieromonk Damascene served the Matins, and Fr. Ceko, Himself standing in Grace with upraised arms in prayer before administering the Holy Eucarist, the Holy Liturgy.

During lunch, Fr. Damascene gave a slide presentation of the Canonization of newest Saints of the Church, and spoke of their lives.

Saint Symeon of Dajbabe loved Language, Calligraphy and Art, lived in a cave He dug himself Monastery of Ostrog in Montenegro, and painted many frescos on the walls, which cave and frescos were shown. Saint Symeon prayed to Saint Basil of Ostrog the Miracle-worker, of Whom I just wrote briefly.

Saint Justin of Celije studied in Oxford, had a great sense of Beauty and loved Poetry, said he saw the God-man Christ as the measure of all things. Saint Justin wrote a 7000 page work on the Lives of the Saints. The two Saints met as described in the previous post concerning the Canonization.

Wisdom!

The reading from the Holy Gospel according to Saint John!

At that time Jesus spoke these words, lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said,&quot;Father, the hour is come. Glorify Your Son , that Your Son also may glorify You, as You have given Him authority over all flesh, that He should give life to as many as You have given Him. And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent. I have glorified You on earth. I have finished the work You have given me to do. And now, O Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was. I have manifested Your name to the men whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word. Now they know that all things which You have given Me are from You. For I have given to then the words which You have given Me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came forth from You; and they have believed that You sent Me. I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours. And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I am glorified in them. Now I am no longer in this world, but these are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep through Your name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are . While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name. Those whom You gave me I have kept; and none of them is lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. But now I come to You, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves.&quot;

The High Priestly Prayer Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on May 18, 2010, 8:35am

Partaker of the Divine Nature

In the gradual unraveling of this thread the following has been said many times in doctrinal Writ and poetic Rhymes. Reiterating, and in concord with yesterday&apos;s&quot;High Priestly Prayer&quot;, here it is from last Sunday&apos;s Church Bulletin &apos;Did You Know?&apos; segment.

About Christ&apos;s Ascension into Heaven...

&quot;After His resurrection from the dead, Jesus appeared to men for a period of fourty days after which he he was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God&quot; (Mark 16:19, see also Luke 24:50 and Acts 1: 9-11). The ascension of Christ is the final act of his earthly mission of salvation. The Son of God comes&quot;down from heaven&quot;to do the work which the Father gives him to do; and having accomplished all things, he returns to the Father bearing for all eternity the wounded and glorified humanity which he has assumed. The doctrinal meaning of the ascention is the glorification of human nature, the reunion of man with God. It is indeed, the very penetration of man in to the inexhaustible depts of divinity, ... To say that Jesus is&quot;exalted at the right hand of God&quot;as St. Peter preached in the first Christian sermon (Acts 2: 33) means exactly this: that man has been restored to communion with God, to a union which is, according to Orthodox doctrine, far greater and more perfect than that given to man in his original creation. Man was created with the potential to be a&quot;partaker of the divine nature,&quot;to refer to the Apostle Peter once more. It is this participation in divinity, called theosis (which literally means deification or divinization) in Orthodox theology, that the ascention of Christ has fulfilled for humanity. The symbolic expression of&quot;sitting at the right hand of God&quot;means nothing other than this. It does not mean that somewhere in the created universe the physical Jesus is sitting on a material throne. The Letter to the Hebrews speaks of Christ&apos;s ascension in terms of the Jerusalem Temple. Just as the high priest of Israel entered the&quot;holy of holies&quot;to offer sacrifice to God on behalf of themselves and the people, so Christ, the One, Eternal and Perfect High Priest offers Himself on the Cross to God as the eternal and perfect Sacrifice, not for himself, but for all sinful men. As a man, Christ enters (once and for all) into the one eternal and perfect Holy of Holies: the very&quot;Presence of God in the heavens.&quot;Thus, the ascension of Christ is seen as man&apos;s first entry into that divine glorification for which he was originally created. The entry is made possible by the exaltation of the divine Son who emptied himself in human flesh in perfect self-offering to God.&quot;

Fr. Thomas Hopko, excerpts from The Orthodox Faith. v. I 

In Saint John&apos;s Gospel from yesterday, Christ states that He was glorified with Hi Father&quot;before the world was&quot;, elsewhere it is stated that He was before All Eternity, and from the article can be gleaned,&quot;greater things than I have done you will do&quot;, and&quot;no one goes to my Father but through Me&quot;, which words once spontaneously&quot;traveled&quot;through my Mind ending in complete understanding while driving. I think it&apos;s one of those never forgotten things that flashes on the mind and disappears until enough insight is gained to simply &apos;know&apos; it, like I know I said this before.

The Orthodox Church is shadowed by the Catholic and branches of other Christian Religions. Thinking of Churches and Religion doesn&apos;t do much for many people for the Spirit has left these denominations as was the case with me. There is no comparison between a Catholic Mass which I remember well, and which seems so sterile to me now as if the Priest alone knew what and why he was doing.... and the inspiring Orthodox Divine Liturgy, and sometimes Father Ceko or Father Norman stop during sencing to speak to people, who speak among themselves, and so much more.

I didn&apos;t make it to UCLA, had doubts I would with my work having almost taken over my life again. I will enquire of the&quot;Orthodox Christian Fellowship at UCLA&quot;, itself interesting, if there is a transcript of the Lecture.

As it is, the more I read on Orthodoxy the more it seems to me It permiates our entire Western History through Europe, England, California and the city of Narbo, and all the way to me as my PO Box is at&quot;the Narbonne&quot;. It is so complex and multidimensional as to almost evade the Mind.

Love Cathedrals, Coat of Arms, Fleur de lis, Key and the Orthodox Cross

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narbonne_Cathedral 

The Divine Poet speaks of Raymond of Toulouse, and the ancient Manchees, a major Iranian Gnostic Religion, which&quot;taught an elaborate cosmology describing the struggle between a good, spiritual world of light, and an evil, material world of darkness. Through an ongoing process which takes place in human history, light is gradually removed from the world of matter and returned to the world of light from whence it came.&quot;Our Saint Augustine of Hippo, He who holds His flaming Heart looking at, and directing the Readers eye to the gilded word&quot;Veritas&quot;, was once a Manichaean.

Raymond of Toulouse,&quot;sometimes called Raymond of St. Gilles (c. 1041 or 1042 - 1105) was Count of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne, and Margrave of Provence and one of the leaders of the First Crusade.

&quot;According to an Armenian source, he had lost an eye on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem before the First Crusade, but this statement probably refers to the fact that he was one-eyed ( monoculus). 

&quot;Raymond was deeply religious, and wished to die in the Holy Land, and so when the call was raised for the First Crusade, he was one of the first to take the cross. The oldest and richest of the crusaders, Raymond left Toulouse at the end of October 1069....&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_IV,_Count_of_Toulouse 

Raymond then went&quot;east to Constantinople - was present at the siege of Nicaea in 1097 - he was ill during the second siege of Antioch by Kerbogha which culminated in the discovery of the Holy Lance by a monk named Peter Batholomew.&quot;

&quot;Peter Bartholomew (died 20 April 1099) was a soldier and mystic from France who was part of the First Crusade.

&quot;In December, 1097, during the siege of Antioch, Peter began to have visions, mostly of St. Andrew. Peter claimed St. Andrew took him to the Church of St. Peter, inside Antioch, and showed him where the relic of the Holy Lance could be found. St. Andrew instructed Peter to tell the Crusade leaders about this, and to give the Lance to Raymond of St. Gilles when it was found. Peter did not immediately inform Raymond or other leaders, and was visited four more times before June of 1098&quot;.

&quot;Peter&apos;s reputation was tarnished because many of the nobles did not believe him. He later claimed Christ had visited him and instructed the Crusaders to march barefoot to Jerusalem, although this was largely ignored. Other visions, from Christ, St. Andrew, Adhemar and others, revealed divine anger at the various sins and vices of the Crusaders.

&quot;On April 1099, Peter went through an ordeal by fire in an attempt to prove himself. It is very likely that he was severely burned in the process, although he claimed he was uninjured because Christ had appeared to him in the fire, and that he had been hurt afterwards when a crowd rushed to him.&quot;

This is literalistic speak. It doesn&apos;t say that the crowd rushed on him with torches to burn him. In any case, one should consider Peter&apos;s own words of the ordeal by fire that left him uninjured.

In the Sermon on the Mount,Jesus is calling us up to a higher level of responsibility. He is asking us to be responsible not only for our actions, but for our thoughts and feelings as well; For the intentions of our heart; which are the seeds of what become our actions.

About evil as the fruit of the thoughts of men

&quot;Hear O earth: behold I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened to my words, nor to my law, but rejected it&quot;(Jeremiah 6:19).

Brethren, do you see where evil grows and where it ripens? Not in the bosom of God, but in the thoughts of men. Evil is sown in the thoughts of men by demonic powers or from the passions of the flesh. Evil grows in the thoughts of men and spreads and multiplies itself, blossoms and bears leaves and finally shows fruit. In due time, God warns men to break from their evil thoughts so that evil would not ripen in the souls of men and bring forth its bitter and deadly fruit. In due time, God warned Cain but he did not want to heed the warning and permitted evil thoughts against his brother to being forth evil fruit; fratricide.

What are the thoughts of evil? All those thoughts that are contrary to the law of God; the word of God. Evil thoughts are the self-willed law of man which man prescribes for himself against God and contrary to the law of God. Therefore, if a man has resolutely decided to adhere to the law of God, evil thoughts are then as weak as shadows which quickly appear but, in the same way, quickly disappear. Then, a man is lord over his thoughts for he feels God as the Lord over himself. Then the law is the law of God and the evil thoughts of men, are nothing.

&quot;Behold, I will bring evil upon this people,&quot;said the Lord. What kind of evil?&quot;The fruit of their thoughts.&quot;That is: I will permit them only to reap that which they sowed and nurtured, for evil is neither My seed nor My harvest. The evil which I will permit upon lawless men is the fruit of their own thoughts. According to their thoughts, they should have estimated what kind of evil will befall them as a sower estimates, according to his seeds, what he will harvest.

O Lord meek and guileless, save us from our own evil which we alone, have nurtured in ourselves. We pray to You, remove the evil fruit of evil crops, and help us to pluck out the evil seed from our souls.

Remembering&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;well, and so on....and understand, so&quot;evil to him who thinks evil&quot;. Your post could be with&quot;Orthodox Psychology&quot;.

Saint Basil the Great, the Third Kneeling Prayer at Pentecost:

&quot;Oh Christ our God...(who) on this all perfect and saving Feast, are graciously pleased to accept propitiatory prayers for those who are imprisoned in hades, promising unto us who are held in bondage great hope of release from the vilenes that doth hinder us and did hinder them ... send down Thy consolation... and establish their souls in the mansion of the Just; and graciously vouchsave unto them peace and pardon; for not the dead shall praise thee, O Lord, neither shall they who are in Hell make bold to offer unto thee confession. But we who are living will bless thee, and will pray, and offer unto thee propitiatory prayers and sacrifice for their souls.&quot;

Remembering my beloved Father and all souls who have passed I pray for daily since long.

Now as with Selfhood so was it again with Breed;
for the fashioning of sex was attended thru&apos;out
by necessary attractionsas &apos;tis seen in plant
or animal, and these as they suffice in brutes
suffice in man so far as he also is animal;
but being specifically endow&apos;d he must in course
hav with the growth of reason outgrown the animal wont;
and in perfection of kind he surely had lost his lure,
had he not learn&apos;d in beauty to transfigure love.

Many shy at such doctrine: Science, they wil say,
knoweth nought of this beauty. But what kenneth she
of color and sound? Nothing: tho&apos; science measure true
every wave-lenght of ether or air that reacheth sense,
there the hunt checketh, and her keen hounds are at fault;
for when the waves have pass&apos;d the gates of ear and eye
all scent is lost: suddenly escaped the visibles
are exchanged to invisible; the fine measured motions
to immeasurable emotion; the cypher&apos;d fractions
to a living joy that man feeleth to shrive his soul.
How should science find beauty? Leibnitz rightly is held
the most irrefutable of all philosophers,
because he boldly excised the intrinse knot from the rope
and, showing both ends free, proclaim&apos;d no knot had been;
imagining two independent world&apos;s that move
in pre-establish&apos;d harmony twixt matter and mind;
a pleasant freak of man&apos;s godlike intelligence,
vex&apos;d by so vain a need; and thinking, with a thought
so inconceivable, to save appearances.

That there is beauty in natur and that man loveth it
are one thing and the same; neither can be drived
apart as cause of the other; and here it is to tell
how female beauty came to be the common lure
in human marriage.First in animal mating
the physical attractions, as they evolved with sense,
took-on beautiful forms, til beauty (as in bird-song)
was recognized consciently and exploited by art,
and after in man became that ladder of joy whereon
slowly climbing at heaven he shall find peace with God,
and beauty be wholly spiritualised to him,
as in its primal essence it must be conceived.

&apos;Twas an exhausting week and still dazed I feel like running to the hills.

Pentecost

I remember Don once making a similar remark, or the gist of it being the same as one of the Musketeers saying to his jailor:&quot;Now, what has Pentecost to do with me? Do you fear, say, that the Holy Ghost may come down in the form od fiery tongues and open the gates of my prison?&quot;Reminding me also of my trying to explain the German word&quot;Geist&quot;, the &apos;h&apos; missing, the &apos;h&apos; being a&quot;Hauch&quot;= Breath, such as would fog up a mirror, or&quot;Heiliger Geist&quot;, aside from Holy means&quot;heilen&quot;or healing. Christ is called&quot;Heiland&quot;= He who heals the Land.

&quot;To the Orthodox Christians, the feast of Pentecost in not just a celebration of an event in history. It ia also a celebration (of) their membership in the Church. They have lived the Pentecost and received&quot;the seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit&quot;in the sacrament of chrismation.&quot;

In the beginning of the Matins, served by Fr. Norman, Father Ceko came up to me and said, Have you received anything (reading material) yet?&quot;No, I replied. Ahem -&quot;to many obstacles, I will go and get it right now. We have a Chrismation today, have you been baptized?&quot;. No, I said, I have been baptized as a Catholic.&quot;Then&quot;, said Fr. Ceko, we will do the same with you as with the man today, it will be a short and simple &apos;confirmation&apos; as you will see.&quot;Thank God, I&apos;m eluding the &apos;dunking&apos;. Handing me information papers, He said,&quot;after you read this we&apos;ll talk, maybe you have additional questions&quot;.

Pentecost or Trinity Day, celebrated fifty day after Easter,&quot;The number fifty, as the fiftieth day after Pasch, stands for eternal and heavenly fulfillment, seven times seven, plus one.&quot;Dressed in white, the catechumen is anointed 7 times from head to ankle seven times with&quot;the seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit&quot;.

The descent of the Holy Spirit is associated with&quot;a mighty wind&quot;, which, not mighty, but pretty strong and unseasonably cold blew yesterday morning from the Ocean, rattling my window casing, and all day yesterday, and driving to Church I saw Planes approaching LAX slightly swaying. (Just bringing it into my daily life).

&quot;In those days, when the day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.&quot;

The House in which the Apostles were sitting, is traditionally the same Upper Room which was to be made ready for the Passover.

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Pentecost 

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecost 

We then prayed&quot;The Three Kneeling Prayers&quot;. Unlike in the Catholic Church, there is no place to kneel (and calluses), you either stand or sit, so we knelt on the floor:

&quot;O Immaculate, undefiled, invisible, incomprehensible, unchangeable, unsurpassable, immeasurable, and longsuffering Lord, Who alone is immortal, Who dwells in light unapproachable, Who created heaven and earth and the sea and all within them; Who before being asked, grants to all their petitions....&quot;

In that Spirit a good week to All

I read the 28 page&quot;Orthodox Christian Catechism&quot;introduction to the Church father Ceko gave me, much about Icons = Theology in Color, the Saints, History of the Church, Persecution, the Great Schism, the Creed, the Shape of the Liturgy, Church Etiquette, the Sacraments, the Architecture of the Church as an Icon of God&apos;s Kingdom etc., in general all we have discussed here. In reading I realized that I learned quite a bit of the Church this past year.

I also mailed the&quot;Orthodox Christian Fellowship&quot;at UCLA asking if a transcript of the lecture of Father Damascene is available, and posted of the event on myspace to see if anyone knows more about it.

Besides, we have covered parts of very interesting Church History, not to mention related and relevant subjects and song, multidimensional and productive. The thread is well worth re-reading from the beginning, which I have done now and then, few pages at a time. Perhaps, when I speak to Fr. Ceko again, all knowledge gathered will help to speed up my Chrismation, in my case a&quot;reconnecting&quot;with the Orthodox Church.

The Orthodox Christian Fellowship at UCLA replied that they had not recorded Father Damascene&apos;s lecture, anyway I can read His Book, and Your upcoming pamphlet on Modesty, a protection from the world in one sense.

Lamenting Your extended absence, I have Faith that our compassionate God will bless us, the Reader, and the World.

My extended leave of absence is from my job-not from our conversation here... So, no reason to lament!

I wrote the following for my 17yr old son who wanted to debate me on my views on &apos;Relationships&apos;

On Relationships
The first two relationships are the most important: Our relationship with God and our relationship with our neighbor.

First of all, we have to get ourselves &apos;right with God.&apos; Even if it takes our whole life to do this, there&apos;s nothing else more important that we need to do until we have done this.

Once we have accomplished getting ourselves right with God, we can move on to our neighbor, whom God tells us we should love as if they were our very self. And further, the Lord informs us that whatsoever we do unto the least of our brethren, we do unto the Lord himself.

If we use these first two relationships as our guide, then we will be ready to enter into whatever other relationships we may so desire without threatening the integrity of these first two, essential relationships.

No one can have a perfect relationship with God and their fellow man all the time. What&apos;s important is to establish it well on a solid foundation the first time and then to be attentive to maintaining and re-establishing it, as need be, as we go along.

The bottom line though, is get oneself right with God IN THE PRESENT MOMENT before undertaking anything new.

Then we can be reasonably reassured that what we intend to do will work out well.

Once we get into the habit of establishing, maintaining and re-establishing our relationship with God and our fellow man on a regular basis, we begin to understand what St. Paul was talking about when he exhorts us to,&quot;Pray without ceasing,&quot;and what it means to,&quot;Consider oneself to be in the presence of the All-seeing God at all times; to stand before God with the mind in the heart.&quot;

THEN we truly begin to draw near to perfection in our relationships. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on May 27, 2010, 9:36am

Good news, then, my hope was your absence only for a while. I should absent myself from my work and serving Mamon, not really &apos;serving&apos; but only necessary to function within society, which brings in relationship with our neighbor. The neighbor we are currently working for leaves at least one message a day voicing concerns about &apos;nothing&apos;, constantly fretting whether she would like this or the other and if the yellow color might not be too dark as in analysis paralysis, but I trust you, she adds, the next second doubting again. Though admonished not to, I &apos;judge&apos; silently &apos;neurotic, sad&apos;, and necessarely overhearing and overseeing the most troubled Family dynamics, the judgement is superficial and evaporates when speaking with her trying to allay her worries with genuine compassion if not outright love. If this sounds too goody goody.... on the other hand I&apos;m thinking I will be so glad to finish and get away for there is not a thing to be done to bring happiness to such people other than creating an environment to ease their Mind and to sooth their Souls.

Relationship with God is much easier, and this I said before: keeping in Mind Plato&apos;s advice that one should say a prayer &apos;before undertaking anything&apos;, for many years, when work was really difficult, or even not, I did it for God who saw me through and things were good, even once asking to send me a Humming Bird to let me know He hears me, and so one came and stayed with me for quite a while which is unusual. I know the importance given to Icons by the Church, living among them God becomes the Background automagically.

The week after Pentecost is Spirit Week, and I wanted to write about&quot;Whit Monday&quot;how the Holy Spirit&quot;called all men to unity&quot;, and does so all the time as was my marvelous experience without defenition untill you gave it one lighting my Mind.

To the Salt Mines, as Don would say

Good thoughts and well being

The Week of the Holy Spirit

Whit Monday, or Monday of the Holy Spirit is the Monday after Pentecost.

&quot;Whit Monday gets its English name for following&quot;Whitsun&quot;, the day that became one of the three baptismal seasons. The name&quot;Whitsunday&quot;is now generally attributed to the white garments formerly worn by those newly baptized on this feast&quot;.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whit_Monday 

In the Orthodox Church white garments are still worn after baptism. The Gentleman baptized last week wore a white suit to Church but took off his jacket to be baptized, and after put it back on.

&quot;Until 1973, Whit Monday was a public holiday in Ireland. It was a bank holiday in the United Kingdom until 1967. - It was also a public holiday in various British colonies, especially in the Pacific.&quot;

I thinks they brought Wit with them. Whit Monday is a holiday in many European Countries including Germany where we call it&quot;Pfingstmontag&quot;, a word that includes&quot;Pneuma&quot;and&quot;Geist&quot;, Heiliger Geist being Holy Spirit. The Monday after Christmas and Easter are also holidays.

The Holy Spirit is given a week in time, in reality It is ever present, suffuses all things, pervades all space, is &apos;boundless&apos;, there is no demarcation between It and Us though we know ourselves within it, It is as if an Eternal Vastness which feels utterly Holy, Divine Consciousness. About a week ago, on TV, I caught a man speaking about weightlessness in which is experienced a vast &apos;inner&apos; space which totally amazed him.

Orthodox Wiki

&quot;The Holy Spirit, or Holly Ghost is God, the third person of the Holy Trinity. The Holy Spirit is co-equal with the Father and Son. The word&quot;Spirit&quot;commonly translates the Greek New Testament word pneuma.

&quot;The Spirit dwells inside every true Christian, each one&apos;s body being his temple (First Epistle to the Corinthians 3:16). He is depicted as a &apos;Counsellor&apos; or &apos;Helper&apos; ( paraclete in Greek, guiding them in the way of the truth. The &apos;Fruit of the Spirit&apos; (i.e. the result of his work) is&quot;love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control&quot;(Galatians 5:22). The Spirit is also believed to give gifts (i.e. abilities) to Christians.

&quot;Christians believe that it was the Holy Spirit whom Jesus mentioned as the promised&quot;Comforter&quot;(i.e.&quot;strengthener&quot;,&quot;fortifier&quot;) in John 14:26. After His resurrection, Christ told His disciples that they would be&quot;baptized with the Holy Ghost&quot;, and would receive power or endowment (Acts 1:4-8); a promise that was fulfilled in the events recounted in the second chapter of Acts. On the first Pentecost, Jesus&apos; disciples were gathered in Jerusalem when a mighty wind was heard and tongues of fire appeared over their heads. A multilingual crowd heard the disciples speaking, and each of them heard them speaking in his or her native language.&quot;

The universal language of consciousness. Once in a dream I leaned over a concrete banister and saw a large swimming pool and a white Dove, the atmosphere being Holy. A white Dove as the Holy Spirit is also shown emanating fiery rays.

 &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;or&quot;Holy Ghost&quot; 

 Holy Ghost was the common name for the Holy Spirit in English prior to the 20th century. It is the name used in the King James Version of the Bible, and is still used by those who prefer more tradidional language. the word ghost has lost its old meaning of the spirit or soul that is inside man and come to be identified almost exclusively with the concept of disembodied spirits, usually the dead, which may&quot;haunt&quot;the living, an idea far from that intended by the King James Translation.&quot;

In the link, the King under the Arch is&quot;Cosmos&quot;, I read.

I gazed at the full Moon this morning and thought of what I heard on MSNBC TV May 20th,&quot;World Metrology Day&quot;, viz., the Moon is receding from the Earth one and a half inches per year. Who will keep time for us?

Posing the question it was that answer. Concerning the receding Moon I read before, but this time it was explained how the measurement is derived.

The last,&quot;Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit&quot;interpretation cited in orthodoxwiki is much to my liking owing to the conneXion to Sir Francis Bacon.

The Russian Monk and Wonderworker of Seraphim of Sarov (1759 - 1833), taught that the purpose of life of the Christian is to acquire the Holy Spirit.

Prince Charles to return to Mount Athos

&quot;AS HE approaches his fifth wedding anniversary next month, Prince Charles is feeling the need for male-only spiritual recharge: he is contemplating a solo sojourn to a monastery in northern Greece.

&quot;The religious enclave of Mount Athos, where no women has set foot since the 11th century (and even female animals are banned), was a favorite retreat for Charles during his testing times with his first wife Diana. But since his marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles he has not felt the need to return, untill now.

&quot;On previous visits to the remote religious community, the Prince has joined in prayer and meditation with monks during the mornings, spending his afternoons painting watercolours of the imposing monasteries dotted among the lush scenery.

&quot;Charles was first introduced to Mount Athos by his father, who was orn in Corfu and had to switch to Anglicanism from Greek Orthodoxy to marry the Queen. Philip&apos;s mother, Alice, was deeply religious and became a nun in her later life. When she died in 1969, she left no possessions, having given everything away, and was buried, as she had requested, on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.&quot;

Prince Charles is always welcom&apos;d by the Monks, and&quot;a senior royal source adds that, increasingly as he gets older, Charles&quot;is seeking answers to spiritual and philosophical questions. Nourishing the spirit is very important to him these days. He is a man beset by many pressures, so he relishes the prospect of spending time alone, with the time to concentrate on spiritual matters.&quot;

 http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2010/05/....ount-athos.html 

Very likely that Prince Philip, born in Corfu, told his Son about Saint Spyridon, the link to Orthodoxy a plus for the English Royalty.

Good to everyone

The aim of the Christian life is to acquire the Holy Spirit of God, to be restored to our original blessed state, to regain our lost &apos;Likeness&apos; to God and thereby be prepared to make a graceful transition into the indescribably more glorious life of the world to come. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on May 30, 2010, 9:19am

Indeed it is and does

.... that ladder of joy whereon
slowly climbing at heaven he shall find peace with God,
and beauty be wholly spiritual to him,
as in its primal essence it must be conceived.

This ken we truly, that as wonder to intellect&apos;
so for the soul desire of beauty is mover and spring;
whence, in whatever his spirit is most moved, a man
wil most be engaged with beauty; and this in his&quot;first love&quot;
physical beauty and spiritual are both present
mingled inseparably in his lure: then is he seen
in the ecstacy of earthly passion and heav&apos;nly vision
to fall to idolatry of some specious appearance
as if &apos;twer very incarnation of his heart&apos;s desire,
whether eternal or spiritual, as with Dante it was,
or mere sensuous perfection, or as most commonly
a fusion of bothwhen id distractedly he hav thought
to mate mortally with an eternal essence
all the delinquencies of his high passion ensue.

Verely if Hope were not itself a happiness
sorrow would far outweigh our mortal joy, but Hope
incarnat in the blood kindleth its hue no less
with every breath, to flud all the sluices of life
long as the heart can beat. And yet in love-mating
hope&apos;s ideal is so rich and fulfilment so rare,
that common minds in trudge with common experience
may think to amend their lot by renouncing life-vows,
as a vain bondage perversiv of happiness.

And coud man seperate brutal from spiritual,
and in things of the flesh liv as animals do
stealing their food and seizing the delight of the hour,
thatt were reasonable enough and might be wise in man;
but such divorcement being in the provision of things
shut out, ther is no way left nor choice for him, unless
he would make shipwreck, and of mere brutality
fall to piecesther is no hope for him but to attune
nature&apos;s diversity to a human harmony,
and with faith in his hope and full courage of soul
realizing his will at one with all nature,
devise a spiritual ethick for conduct in life.

Refusal of christian marriage is, as &apos;twer in art,
to impugn the credit of the most beautiful things
because ther are so few of them, and hold it folly
to aim at excellence where so few can succeed;
and where any success pincheth the happiness
of the far greater number, who left to themselves
might feel fuller content admiring common things
or ugly, and be happier in whatever likings
they can indulge. Altho&apos; they know it not, this is
the humanitarianism of democracy;
and since ther is in the mass little good to look for
but with instruction, authority and example impose,
Ethick and Politick alike have trouble in store.

Now mere impulse of sex,from animal mating
to the vision of Dantetho&apos; strong in all degrees,
is not the bond of marriage. Nay, if breeding ceased,
all motiv to it, liking for it and thought of it,
women and men would mate; and, whatever might lack,
married life might be found a more congenial state,
and marriage of true minds hav less impediment.

Saint Basil the Great &apos;on the Holy Spirit&apos;

&quot;The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of truth Who proceeds from the Father (John 15:26). Furthermore, the first and most proper title of the Holy Spirit is, in fact, Holy Spirit since no other name is more appropriate for a being which is incorporal, immaterial and indivisible. For this reason the Lord informed the Samaritan women that one must worship God in Spirit and in truth (John 4:24). She had believed that God must be worshipped only in certain places. He revealed to her, however, that an incorporal being cannot be circumscribed. Unlike created beings, such a being is subject neither to change nor variations. Instead, we are to lift our minds on high and ponder an intelligent being, boundless in power, of unlimited greatness, and generous in goodness. He is the source of holiness. All things seeking holiness seek the Holy Spirit. He vivifies them and enables them to reach their goal. The Holy Spirit perfects all things but lacks nothing. He gives live to all but is never depleted. The Holy Spirit can neither be increased by addition nor diminished, but is always complete, self-established and everywhere present. Are these the titles and characteristics of a mere creature?&quot;

Confirming and describing my vision of the Holy Spirit, and remembering another dream vision of a wholly rarefied substance, aware of its Intelligence, the observer partaking of it, a &apos;field&apos; which was circumscribed, whereas the Holy Spirit described above is substanceless, clear.&quot;Oracle Dreams&quot;, Artimedorus names such dreams, need no decoding and remain with the dreamer always.

Theosis: the Holy Spirit strives with us.

&quot;The Holy Spirit&apos;s works for our salvation are magnificent. He gives life and is the source of sanctification. He is the source of spiritual light which illumines all who use His to seek the truth. The illumination which the Holy Spirit gives is not extrinsic to Himself, but is Himself. The Holy Spirit distributes His energy in proportion to the capacity of the recipient. He is distributed but never changed, shared but always whole, unapproachable in nature but approachable through His goodness. Take the analogy of the sunbeam which lights all things wherein each recipient rejoices in the sun as if it existed only (for?) him. The Holy Spirit, likewise is given to all, and yet to each person as if possessed by that person alone. Those who receive His grace are filled with joy according to their capacity rather than according to the measure of His power. Are these the works of a mere creature?

&quot;The Holy Spirit illuminates humanity, and the illumination which He shares is Himself. The Holy Spirit reveals in Himself, Christ, the blessed Image in Whom one sees the unspeakable beauty of the Image&apos;s prototype, the Father. Indeed, as the Father is only revealed through His Image, the Son, the Son is beheld only through the Light of the Holy Spirit. As a statue is invisible without a light shining upon it, the light of the Holy Spirit is inseparable from the only natural Image of God, the Son. Through this illumination, the Holy Spirit illumines, perfects and sanctifies the souls who seek God. As the sunbeam makes transparent things brilliant, so also the Holy Spirit makes Spirit-bearing souls, illumined by Him, spiritual as well. From the Holy Spirit comes knowledge of the future, understanding of mysteries, heavenly citizenship, endless joy in the presence of God, becoming like God, and the highest goal, becoming God. Spiritual illumination, sanctification, and divinization come from the Holy Spirit. Without the Holy Spirit, God the Father and God the Son would remain hidden from us. Such is the greatness, dignity and working of the Holy Spirit. Could such works come from anyone less than God?

&quot;The Holy Spirit is confessed in the creed, is named in saving baptism and in the performance of miracles. Nobody can utter a word in defence of Christ without the Holy Spirit (Mat. 10:19-20). The Lord has given the Holy Spirit His proper place. Why then should the Holy Spirit accept the lower ranking of creature, especially since all creation is in bondage and the Holy Spirit frees it (2 Cor. 3:17)? How could anyone who has ever partaken of the Holy Spirit try to sunder Him from the fellowship of the Father and the Son? In everything the Holy Spirit is indivisibly and inseparably joined to the Father and the Son.

&quot;The Holy Spirit is described in the singular and not ranked with creation. He is unique, one of one, not one of many. The heavenly powers were established by the Holy Spirit (Ps. 32:6 LXX) and continue in goodness through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit existed, pre-existed and co-existed with the Father and the Son before all ages.

&quot;Such, then, to instance a few out of many, are the conceptions concerning the Holy Spirit, which we have been taught to hold concerning His greatness, His dignity, and His operations, by the oracles of the Spirit themselves.&quot;

Week before last, I drove to and fro work round the Palos Verdes Peninsula, along the Pacific and thankful there is no drilling allowed. Most days the Atmosphere was so clear I could see Avalon and I decided spontaneously to revisit Catalina Island. Taking the&quot;slow boat&quot;accompanied by leaping Dolphins, at times shooting ahead like rockets then waiting for the boat to catch up, I lodged at a Mom and Pop&quot;Bed and Breakfast&quot;at the end of a street near the hills where I climbed about looking for mysterious Caves to find what I could find. Other, the Town of Avalon is a bustling and noisy Tourist Place.



Truly myths so ancient and examples of life,
fish&apos;d-up out of the old jumble-box of history,
can find but little credit with this generation
who, like children absorb&apos;d in the scientific toys
of their high-kilted gossips, care not to ransack
the nursery cupboard for their grand-dam&apos;s old playthings;
tho&apos; family relics are they, once loved, and may show
how that in man&apos;s eternal quest of happiness,
contempt for fleshly pleasur is as near to his spirit
as is the love of it to his animal nature.

Vestiges of his stony asceticism imbue
all time, thick as the strewage of his flinty tools,
disseminat wheresoe&apos;er he hath dwelt; nor need we now,
from where they sleep bedded on archaeologic shelves,
fetch down upon the lecture-table our specimens
to teach what manners went to the making of man;
having such living witness of harmonized life
in the aristocracy of our English motherhood,
whence the nobility of our sons came, and therewith
precedence of their courtesy title in the world;
a tradition of good-faith, humanity and courage,
that year by year flowereth on the grafted stock
of Saxon temperament; the which slow or dead
to beauty, is but a dullard in spiritual sense.

And so the character of our common folk, up-built
in the commanding presence of feminin grace,
won therefrom (as I hold) its vulgar excelence;
for finding their own conduct unconformable
to beauty of so high grade, they guarded it apart
submissiv in its own status, a kindly thing
with naive honesty and good commonsense convinced;
and, easing embarrassment with the humour of life,
paid due respect and honour where they felt &apos;twas due,
so they might goodtemper&apos;dly and in laughable wise
hobnob with ugliness, and just at frightfulness,
and keep the farce up mirthfully in the face of death.
If any see not this fractur in our midst, because
the pieces are in place, &apos;tis pictured for him true
in Shakespeare&apos;s drama, where ideal women walk
in worship, and the baser sort find sympathy,
and both are bravely stirr&apos;d together as water and oil.

But if &apos;tis ask&apos;d to name what special function it was
that fell sequester&apos;d out of Adam in his lost rib,
and which, when launch&apos;d by Reason on his sea of troubles,
should be his paregoric and comforting cure,
&apos;twas no unique, ultimatly separable thing,
as is a chemic element; for rather our moods,
influences and spiritual affections are like
those many organic substances which, tho&apos; to sense
wholly dissimilar and incomparable in kind,
are yet all combinations of the same simples,
and even in like proportions differently disposed;
so that whether it be starch, oil, sugar, or alcohol
&apos;tis ever our old customers, carbon and hydrogen,
pirouetting with oxygen in their morris antics;
the chemist booketh all of them as C H O,
and his art is as mine, when I but figurate
the twin persistent semitones of my Grand Chant.

For verily I say unto

God is trying to prepare us to enter into another kind of reality-one where whatever we INTEND comes into being INSTANTANEOUSLY.

In order for us to be able to handle that kind of power with responsibility, we have to go through a process of purification and illumination to insure that all of the garbage in our sub conscious and unconscious mind doesn&apos;t manifest instantaneously as well.

To go through this process consciously and voluntarily is what is known as,&quot;Having a spiritual life.&apos; Going through this process unconsciously and involuntarily is what&apos;s known as,&apos;The Apocalypse and the end of the world.&apos;

Obviously, going through this process of purification and illumination consciously and voluntarily is highly preferable to going about it the other way.There is no third possibility, however.

The more we enter into this process willingly, the deeper we can enter into this other kind of reality EVEN NOW.

That is really what it&apos;s all about and looked at from that perspective, everything that happens to us, both individually and collectively on the world stage, makes perfect sense.

The Saints of North America

Saint Herman of Alaska, Patron Saint of the New World, and first Saint to be glorified by the Orthodox Church in America, familiar almost from the beginning of this thread via the Monastery in Platina.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_of_Alaska 

Saint Peter the Aleut&quot;(or Cungagnaq in his native tongue) was probably a native of Kodiak Island (Alaska). He is said to have received the Christian name of Peter when he was baptized into the Orthodox faith by the monks of St. Herman&apos;smissionaries operating in the north.&quot;

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Peter_the_Aleut 

Saint Innocent of Alaska,&quot;Equal-to-the-Apostles and Enlightener of North America (1797 - 1879), was a Russian Orthodox priest, bishop, archbishop, and Metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia. He is known for his missionary work, scholarship, and leadership in Alaska and the Russian Far East during the 1800s. He is known for his great zeal for his work as well as his great abilities as a scholar, linguist, and administrator. - He learned several native languages and was the author of many of many of the earliest scholarly works about the natives and their language, as well as dictionaries and religious works in these languages. He also translated parts of the Bible into several native languages.&quot;

How very interesting, In another field of research Harriot comes to Mind.

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Innocent_of_Alaska 


Saint Raphael of Brooklyn (Nov. 20, 1860 - Feb. 27, 1915) was born in Beirut, Lebanon, educated in Damascus, and was the first Orthodox Bishop to be consecrated in North America by Archbishop St. Tikhon of Moscow and Bishop Innicent of New York City, and served in Brooklyn until His death. As an auxiliary Bishop,&quot;St. Raphael founded the present-day primatial cathedral of the Antiochian Orthodox ChristianArchdiocese of North America (St. Nicholas Cathedral), established thirty parishes, and assisted in the founding of St. Tikhon&apos;s Orthodox Monastery in South Canaan, Pennsylvania.&quot;

Saint Varnava of Hvosno and Gary (1914-1964), was born in Gary, Indiana, attended school in Sarajevo and the Orthodox Theologiccal Faculty in Belgrad.

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Varnava_(Nastic) 

Saint Alexis (Toth) of Wilkes-Barre&quot;was a missionary priest, sent from his homeland in Slovakia as a Uniate, who, in order to serve and protect his flock in the United States in a hostile Latin envoronment, recognized the need to lead them in a return to their Orthodox Christian heritage.&quot;

KONTAKION TO THE SAINTS OF NORTH AMERICA - TONE THREE

Today the choir of Saints who were pleasing to God in the lands of North American now stands before us in the Church and invisibly prays to God for us. With them the angels glorify Him, and all the Saints of the Church of Christ keep festival with them; and together they all pray for us to the Pre-eternal God.

Charlotte Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jun 8, 2010, 7:49am

Honered among the Saints of North America is Saint Nicholai of Zica, Author of Prologue of Ochrid, and commemorated today is the Apostle Carpus of the Seventy.

&quot;.... the saints are our fellow church members, for the Church is&quot;the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem&quot;that includes&quot;tens of thousands of angels&quot;(the bodiless heavenly hosts) and&quot;the spirits of righteous people made perfect&quot;.

The Apostle Carpus, Saint Nicholai, and Saint Dionysius the Areopagite

&quot;Carpus was one of the Seventy Apostles. He was a follower and companion of the Apostle Paul by whom he was appointed as bishop of Varna in Thrace. He also preached the Gospel in Crete where he received St. Dionysius the Areopagite in his home. St. Dionysius testified that Carpus was a man with an exceptionally pure mind, meekness and innocence, and that the Lord Jesus, with His angels, appeared to him in a vision, and that he never began the Divine Liturgy unless he did not have a heavenly vision beforehand. Enduring many assaults for the name of Christ, he finally suffered at the hands of the unbelieving Jews and was killed and, with his soul, took up habitation in the kingdom of God to delight eternally gazing upon the Lord in glory.

Reflection of St. Nicholai of Zica

&quot;We should not desire the death of a sinner, but his repentance. Nothing grieves the Lord more, Who suffered on the Cross for sinners, then when we pray to Him for the death of a sinner and thereby to remove him from our path. It happened that the Apostle Carpus lost his patience and began to pray that God send down death upon two sinful men; one a pagan and the other an apostate from the Faith. Then the Lord Christ Himself appeared to Carpus and said:&quot;Strike me; I am prepared to be crucified again for the salvation of mankind.&quot;St. Carpus related this to St. Dionysius the Areopagite and he wrote it down and gave it to the Church as a lesson to all, that prayers are needed for sinners to be saved and not for them to be destroyed,&quot;for the Lord is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance&quot;(2 Peter 3:9).&quot;

 http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2010/05/vision-of-apostle-carpus-of-seventy.html 

So much for demanding the death penalty, and our prison system of punishment rather than all power to rehabilitation. Not long ago, I watched the Administration of the prison system in near East Countries such as Bosnia Herzegovina, Poland, Bulgaria, and one or two other Countries, and was as surprised as the Film Crew to see the living conditions of Prisoners who walk about freely and relaxed among and with the guards, as one said he is just there to do his time, in one case in a compoud with a Fountain, Peacocks, Flowers and grounds they cultivate, in another a Castle in a beautiful country side was changed to a prison, stunning the Film Crew, in all, the system is wholly geared to rehabilitatation, the guards informing the Film Crew of its operation and purpose.

What you do to the least of them you do unto me, and the Good Shepherd leaves the flock and goes after the lost one.

Open open that Door with the 8th, words in a song, and I may be pardoned recalling the stem of the Meerschaum Pipe, the key that opened the Treasure Room beneath the Trinity Church, beside my Church being very good last Sunday.

It was June 9, 1730

This morning I found

John the Russian

&quot;Saint John the Russian (1690 - 1730), is one of the most renowned saints in the Greek Orthodox Church. Being a prisoner of war and a slave to a Turkish Agha, he became famous and respected even by his Muslim master for his humility, steadiness in faith and benevolence. His holy relics are undecayed and wonder-working; there are evidences that this saint particularly helps sick children and those who suffer from cancer.&quot;

In the service of Peter the Great, Saint John fought in the Russo-Turkish war, was captured and sold into slavery.&quot;He worked as a groom and lived in the stables. Other slaves mocked at him for the zeal he was working with, but the pious man took no offence, trying to help them in their needs and comforting them when needed. For his sincere kind-heartedness, the saint had earned love and trust of the Agha who proposed him to live as a free man, in seperate house. But the saint refused, saying:&quot;My Patron is Lord and noone is above Him. He predestined me to live as a slave in a foreign land; seems, it must be so for my salvation.

&quot;Soon the Agha became rich and one of the most influential people in Urgup. He decided, that it is due to the holy man, who lives in his house. Having become rich, the Agha decided to carry out the Hajj. During this travel, his wife was giving a dinner to the relatives and friends. When the master&apos;s favourite dish, pilau was being served, she told John, who was waiting upon the table:&quot;How glad would your master be, if he could eat this pilau with us&quot;. The saint asked her to give him this dish, promised to send it to Mecca. Everybody was laughing, but John&apos;s request was complied, they decided he wans to eat pilau himself or give it to the poor.

&quot;When the Agha came back, he told about the miracle that had happened to him: while being in Mecca, he found a fuming plate of pilau in his locked room. And on this plate his name was ingraved - as on every plate in his house.

&quot;News of the miracle spread quickly, and everyone, even Muslims began to call John a&quot;veli&quot;- a&quot;saint&quot;. But he didn&apos;t change the way he lived, spending time in hard work and prayers. Before his death he had become seriously ill, and having no ability to stand up, asked for a priest to give him the Holy Communion. The priest was afraid to go openly to Muslim house and passed the Eucharist hidden inside an apple. Having taken it, the saint man died. It was June 9, 1730.&quot;

What John the Russian intended came into being. The mystery of the miracles of Saints.

Comprehending the Holy Spirit

Saint Basil the Great, Ouranophantor

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_of_Caesarea 

&quot;But on a higher note, our goal is to become like God in so much as possible for human nature. Without knowledge of God, one cannot become like Him. Without instruction there is no knowledge and instructions begin with the fundamentals. The proper use of speech is among the fundamentals of education, and words and syllables are parts of speech. If one spurns such fundamentals, one never advances to higher things. So if humans are to know God, they must wrestle with how God is expressed in human language. For the pious, therefore, learning precision in language concerning divinity is the first step in becoming God. As St. Athanasius the Great wrote, &quot;He, indeed, assumed humanity that we might become God.&quot; Such wrestling with language points to significant theological ideas which we shall study next.&quot;

Conspicuously impinging on the Mind, one can detect many an unusual definition in the language of the Orthodox Church, of Saints, Hymns, and well-versed Authors.

The Holy Spirit, Purifier

St. Basil the Great

&quot;Now the Spirit is not brought into intimate association with the soul by approximation. How indeed could there be a corporeal approach to the incorporeal? The association results from the withdrawal of the passions which, , coming afterwards gradually on the soul from its friendship with the flesh, have alienated it from its close relationship with God. Only then after a man is purified from the shame whose stain he took through his wickedness, and has come back again to his natural beauty, and as it were cleaning the Royal Image and restoring its ancient form, only thus is it possible for him to draw near to the Paraclete.

Most fortunate and blessed is he who in some such God given instant comes spontaneously into the Presence of the Holy Spirit.

&quot;And He, like the sun, will by the aid of thy purified eye show thee in Himself the image of the invisible, and in the blessed spectacle of the image thou shalt behold the unspeakable beauty of the archetype. Through His aid hearts are lifted up, the weak are held by the hand, and they who are advancing are brought to perfection. Shining upon those that are cleansed from every spot, He makes the spiritual by fellowship with Himself. Just as when a sunbeam falls on bright and transparent bodies, they themselves become brilliant too, and shed forth a fresh brightness from themselves, so souls wherein the Spirit dwells, illuminated by the Spirit, themselves become spiritual, and send forth their grace to others.&quot;

No one can refute this truth, and in the lesser we love the company of bright people, such as a Lady&apos;s high Spirit lifted and touched mine momentarily at the Post Office, yesterday, both of us waiting by the door yielding to the other. It was one of those rare out of this world moments, beautiful Her Spirit and pure Her words.

Illuminated by the Spirit, Saint Basil:&quot;Hence comes foreknowledge of the future, understanding of the mysteries, apprehenshion of what is hidden, distribution of good gifts, the heavenly citizenship, a place in the chorus of angels, joy without end, abiding in God, the being made like to God, and, highest of all, the being made God [that is, sharers in the divine nature].&quot;And so also we read repeatedly in this thread.

Saint Basil the Great&quot;On the Holy Spirit&quot;

&quot;By far the most frequently cited source in On the Holy Spirit is Holy Writ. Nearly all of his arguments begin with Holy Scripture as a source, or as a justification for his doxology. - But there is more to St. Basil&apos;s use of Holy Writ than its frequency. The centrality of Holy Writ is essential for St. Basil&apos;s theological methodology. Holy Scripture, for St. Basil, is the source of sources. It is central to Christian theology. St. Basil also uses and values highly both written and unwritten traditions of the Fathers. When citing the traditions of the Fathers to prove the validity of his doxology, however, he makes clear that one ought not be content with their support merely because they are the traditions of the Fathers, but because the Fathers understood and followed the meaning of the Holy Scripture.&quot; 

Not follow blindly what the Fathers teach, but discern and understand oneself that they understood the &apos;meaning&apos; of the Holy Writ by hearing what they convey.

&quot;The Holy Spirit searches the depths of God, whereas creatures receive divine illumination only through the Spirit. The Holy Spirit gives true worshippers the knowledge of God personally, or in Himself. For believers, divine knowledge comes through the Holy Spirit since the way to such knowledge ascends from the Holy Spirit (the Illuminator) to the one Son (the Image) to the one Father (the Prototype). Likewise, goodness, holiness, and royal dignity reach from the Father through the Son to the Holy Spirit. Therefore believers share in divine knowledge and goodness in the Holy Spirit and all three persons of the Holy Trinity participate in human illumination and sanctification. The Holy Spirit gives life to all, together with the Father Who enlivens all things and the life-giving Son. Romans 8:11 reveals,&quot;but if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.&quot;

It is also said that the Embryo is a living organism until quickened by the Spirit and man becomes a living Soul. I haven&apos;t read up lately how Biologists explain the&quot;quickening&quot;every Mother experiences with a sense of wonder.

First paragraph posted Dec. 13, 09, repeated for continuity

Now Women took her jointure from the potency
of spirit stored in flesh, the which, affined to her sex,
became a property of intuition and grew in her,
thru&apos; mutual adaption with the invironments
that wer its own effects, to a female character
in worth alike and weakness distinct from the male:
for while man&apos;s Reason drew him whither science led
to walk with downcast eyes fix&apos;d on the ground, and low
incline his ear to catch the sermon-whisper of stones
whence now whole nations, by their treasure-trove enrich&apos;d,
crawl greedily on their knees nosing the soil like swine,
and any, if they can twist their stiffen&apos;d necks about,
see the stars but as stones,while men thus search&apos;d the earth,
stooping to pick up wisdom, women stood erect
in honest human posture, from light&apos;s fount to drink
celestial influences; and this was seen in them
that worship&apos;d Christ nor look&apos;d, as then the apostles did,
for some earthly prosperity or prospect, nor ask&apos;d
what chief seats might be theirs reserved in the Kingdom;
his heav&apos;nly call drew him, and the Mary who sat
at Christ&apos;s feet in devotion, heard from him her choice
pronounced the one thing needful; and as &apos;twas for her,
so it is nowaday for us to our happiness.

For &apos;tis by such faith only a man can save his soul;
since his unique spirit cometh more and more
out of slumber into vision, he looseth heart the more
at the inhumanity of nature&apos;s omnipotence.
Thatt first savage suspicion is now the last despair
of earnest thinkers, who for love of truth refuse
to blink dishonestly the tribulation of man,
but deem it final truth, and see no cure thereof,
nor solace save what brave distraction of thought may bring
in further keen persuit of knwoledge, on the old path
that hath hereby led them where the everlasting worm
eateth their hearts . . . and yet man&apos;s Reason (as is confess&apos;d)
since &apos;tis of nature&apos;s fabric must share in her fault;
and man&apos;s spiritual sense, which inspireth his grief,
is equally of her giving: whence his complaint sheweth
the strange perversity of creation&apos;s self-reproach;
tho&apos; nature the while is by beauty awakening
her heav&apos;nly response to her heavenliest desire,
and in spiritual joy sanctioneth to the full
the claim of faith. To such despairers Christ out-spoke
in his rich poetry &apos;Tis better with one eye
blinded to enter into the life of Goddes Realm
than with both eyes to grieve in Hell. Be thatt not Truth,
then there is something found for man better than Truth;
which thought wer the supreme vanity of vanities,
at once a superhuman ambition and a poor pride,
truly the last infirmity of his noble mind.

Feast of the Holy Apostle Hermes of the Seventy

Kontakion - Tone Four

With the light of the Holy Spirit, you illumine the the way of the faithful like a star, O Holy Apostle Hermes. As you gaze on God the Word you repel the darkness of error.

Again, it was wonderful in Church. What I mean by wonderful cannot and perhaps shoul not be described, but only experienced. His Grace, Bishop Maxim, standing aside, sang with melodious voice throughout the Matins served by Fr. Norman, served the Holy Liturgy, and gave a Homily which would have delighted Scientists, Psychologists, Philosophers and Historians.

The reading was from the Holy Gospel of Saint Matthew

&quot;The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.&quot;

This was part of the Homily relating to the Observer of science, and to the first statement of this thread, &apos;our inner state becomes our outer invironment.

From the Church Bulletin
Quote of the Day

 &quot;If you read history you will find that the Christians who did most for the present world were precisely those who thought most of the next. It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so ineffective in this.&quot;

Steven has been away all weekend visiting Eureka! CA. With Abbot Hilarion. But it seems that Charlotte&apos;s posting of yesterday&apos;s Church bulletin is right in tune with what he has to say on his return:

The aim of the Spiritual life is to help each of us to become a Well-balanced person as a &apos;Stepping off place&apos; for being Sanctified and becoming God-like.

Paradise is what is considered, &apos;Natural&apos; for us. We are intended for the Kingdom of Heaven. The world that we have become familiar with is essentially a mirage which has become superimposed over the real world.

If we choose to live our lives for and in such a manner that we try to, &apos;Get the most out of&apos; and &apos;Make the best of&apos;, this present, fallen world, we run the risk of missing out on Paradise, the Kingdom of Heaven and all of God&apos;s promised Blessings for us altogether.

That&apos;s it exactly, Charlotte.

There is something wrong with the world and it is we who are responsible for that wrong. And we who are responsible for making it right once again.

our understanding of the future age is based in our understanding of the first created world.

According to the consensus of the Orthodox holy fathers, the entire first created world--not only paradise--was incorrupt, without death. It was a totally different reality than what we know today. There was no pain, nor suffering, nor disease, nor sickness; no death; all these things came into being through the fall. These things are UNnatural to the REAL world, and will have no place in the life of the world to come. Re: The Secret of the Universe

Greetings Don, Steven, and Guests,

Back from the days in San Francisco, &apos;twas brutal, my Daughter and her Husband moved into a nice, large House and we cleaned, painted, and moved stuff 24/7. The House is on a hill and the street up to it is named&quot;Ascension&quot;which I like. Question is, Ascension on the Corporate Ladder or the Kingdom. In this case definitely the former.

Aside from the mundane influencing our inner state, there is the visible Church influencing and enriching our inner state with understanding, repelling the former.

Hearing the accent of the Taxi Driver from LAX to my Place as sort of Russian, and seeing the Orthodox Cross on his rear view mirror, I ask,&quot;where are you from?&quot;&quot;Armenia&quot;, He answered.&quot;Are you an Orthodox Christian?&quot;&quot;Yes, I am&quot;, he said.&quot;I am in the process of becoming one&quot;, I told him, and that I read some of the History of the Church and region. We spoke about it some, and he said that the Armenians were the first Christians 2000 years ago to.... to .... he tried to find a translation for a word but couldn&apos;t and said it means something like the Armenians were the first Christians who looked for the fire. It seemed important to him to have me understand and he searched again for an English term, upon which I said not to worry, that I think I know the gist of what he is trying to convey.

This, then, was marvelous in my eyes, landing from a world so removed from mine, a thread was given to me to my world right at the Airport via the Taxi Driver.

As to our subject and the Church, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m off the Mark in saying that in no other Church will you hear a quote from C.S. Lewis, such a true one at thatt, and many other things.

There is not much to get out of this world, and to make the best out of daily life is good, but to what end? Who can believe that this live is all there is to Us? Most people would say that we live on in our descendents, no, I thought. Anyhow, I always dreamed of a beautiful place in the clouds as is the way of Dreamers, such as my beloved divine Poet, wide awake.

From blind animal passion to the vision of Spirit
all actual gradations come of natur, and each
severally in time and place is answerable in man.
As with the embryo which in normal growth passeth
thru&apos; evolutionary stages, at each stage
consisting with itself agreeable, so Mind
may be by observation in young changes waylaid,
agreeable all, tho&apos; no more congruous with themselves
than what a baby thinketh of its naked feet,
hen first it is aware of them, is like the thought
of piteous sympathy with which when an old man
he will come to regard them. So likewise of BREED,
youth and age hold their irreconcilable extremes,
from him who deemed sex to be the curse of man
to him who findeth in it the only pleasur in life:
then the four temperaments of blood possess of kind
their different sensibilities, and every bias
of education coloureth; while the abstract thought
some would submit its energy to rule of state,
to ethic duty some, others to personal health,
to social propriety or the grace of good manners;
climate can subjugate and religion constrain;
national tast prescribe practice and fix ideals;
yet howso no two men wil be found wholly alike,
nor any one man always consonant in himself;
the saint wil have his days of humiliation and trail,
the clown his rare moments of revelation and peace,
while commonsense wil waver in its faith with fortune.

Now as a physical object apparent to sense
must in all its perspective be studied, tho&apos; none
be true wholly in itself, and reality is found
by elimination of error, so &apos;twil be with Love,
which, is it had no various aspects of feeling
nor delusive perspectivs of spiritual sight,
neither coud it hav any essential property
in the Wisdom of God: thus men, who mostly liv
in the light of one aspect and convinced thereby,
wil deem of love differently, and in as many ways
as there be planes of spirit, and faculties of Mind:
and the philosopher expecteth little audience
of men school&apos;d to the habit of their own liking,
and were he heaven-inspired he should not therefore look
to win the general ear; yet, one proviso allow&apos;d,
he may command agreement; so (saith he) if ther be
any one scheme of Reason in the evolution of Mind
preferable and probableand without so much faith
he would sit dumbthen thatt ideal wil be found
in few, not in many, but potential in them,
and in the best imperfect, a desire of all,
an everlasting hope not everlastingly
to be rebuff&apos;d and baffled, rather preordain&apos;d
by arch-creativ Wisdom, as man groweth to find
his Will in Goddes pleasur, his pleasur in Goddes Will;
drawn to thatt happiness by the irresistable
predominent attraction, which worketh secure
in mankind&apos;s Love of Beauty and in the Beauty of Truth.

Perhaps I was right some time ago in thinking that you are an Official in the Church as I quickly discern&apos;d that you are most versed in All pertaining to Orthodoxy.

Father Ceko addressed me with&quot;oh, she is back&quot;, referring to my calling Him that I would be in San Francisco all week - the week He was going to call me&quot;to get started&quot;. We exchanged a few words and I think He will call me this week.

It was good being in Church to get over the commotion of the last days. At the beginning of the Matins an elderly Lady came close and said a few words I didn&apos;t understand. I speak only English, I said.&quot;Oh English - you bring oranges?&quot;Yes, I nodded.&quot;How much you pay? We want to help&quot;. Thank you, but its a gift for everyone, I replied.&quot;You born here?&quot;No, in Germany.&quot;My Daughter married to German man, they live in Stuttgart. You drive here?&quot;Yes, I live in ....&quot;How much you pay for rent?&quot;I said the amount.&quot;Expensive area but nice, I live in .... close, you come for Coffee and Cake?&quot;I have not much time because I work every day.&quot;What do you do?&quot;I explained and She gave me a thumbs up.&quot;My Grandchildren come tomorrow from Belgrade, they speak very good German, you will meet them, yes? I agreed.&quot;My Husband and I like the oranges very much and we would like to buy some. How much for a sack?&quot;The smaller one $2.50, and the large one $9.00.&quot;The smaller if you bring please&quot;. I agreed. The Lady came back twice to ask more questions, it was so nice and simple speaking with Her and I&apos;m looking forward to news from Germany.

That&apos;s about all that happened, I left after Church as no one I was acquainted with was present.

God forbid I should prophecy of plans unknown to you. &apos;Twould be a sharp misery.

Cyril of Alexandria

I was somewhat acquainted with the 24th Pope of Alexandria (376-444 A.D.) via my philosophical studies with different Teachers, at which time I didn&apos;t consider Him a Saint as I now understand a Saint.

&quot;Cyril is counted among the Church Fathers and the Doctors of the Church, and his reputation within the Christian world has resulted in his titles Pillar of Faith and Seal of all the Fathers, but Theodosius II, the Roman Emperor, condemned him for behaving like a proud Pharaoh, and the Nestorian bishops at the Council of Ephesus declared him a heretic, labelling him as a monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church.

&quot;Cyril was born about 376 in the small town of Theodosios, Egypt, near modern day El-Mahalla El-Kubra. A few years after his birth, his maternal uncle Theophilus rose to the powerful position of Patriarch of Alexandria. His mother remained close to her brother and under his guidance, Cyril was well educated. His education showed through his knowledge, in his writings, of Christian writers of his day, including Eusebius, Origin, Didymus the Blind, and writers of the Church of Alexandria. He received the formal education standard for his day: he studied grammar from age twelve to fourteen (390-392), rhetoric and humanities from fifteen to twenty (393-397) and finally theology and biblical studies (398-402).

&quot;.... Cyril followed his uncle in a position that had become powerful and influential, rivalling that of the prefect in a time of turmoil and frequently violent conflict between the cosmopolitan city&apos;s Pagan, Jewish, and Christian inhabitants.

&quot; Orestes, Praefectus augustalis of the Diocese of Egypt, steadfastly resisted Cyril&apos;s agenda of ecclesiastical encroachment onto secular prerogatives.

&quot;According to Christian sources, the Jews of Alexandria schemed against the Christians and killed many of them. Cyril reacted and expelled all of the Jews, or only the murderers, from Alexandria, actually exerting a power that belonged to the civil officer, Orestes. Orestes was powerless, but nonethless rejected Cyril&apos;s gesture of offering him a Bible, which would mean that the religious authority of Cyril would require Orestes&apos; acquiescence about the bishop&apos;s policiy.

&quot;This refusal almost cost Orestes his life. Nitrian Monks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadi_El_Natrun came from the desert and instigated a riot against Orestes among the population of Alexandria. These monks&apos; violence had already been used, 15 years before, by Theophilus (Cyril&apos;s uncle) against the&quot;Tall Brothers&quot;; furthermore, it is said that Cyril had had spend five years among them in ascetic training. Yhe monks assaulted Orestes and accused him of being a pagan. Orestes rejected the accusation, showing that he had been baptized by the Archbishop of Constantinople. However, the monks were not satisfied, and one of them, Ammonius, threw a stone and hit Orestes on his head, and so much blood flowed out that he was covered in it.&quot;

The Theology of Cyril reflects that of the Orthodox Church.

&quot;Cyril regarded the embodiment of God in the person of Jesus Christ to be so mystically powerful that it spread out from the body of the God-man into the rest of the race, to reconstitute human nature into a graced and eified condition of the saints, one that promised immortality and transfiguration to believers. Nestorius, on the other hand, saw the incarnation as primarily a moral and ethical example to the faithful, to follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Cyril&apos;s constant stress was on the simple idea that it was God who walked the streets of Nazareth (hence Mary was Theotokos (Mother of God)), and God who had appeared in a transfigured humanity.&quot;

Just last Sunday, Father Ceko put this in one sentence,&quot;God assumed US&quot;.

You know, but for my love of the Neoplatonists, Hypatia is on my Mind, immortalized by Raphael&apos;s glorious painting, the&quot;School of Athens&quot;.

&quot;Cyril is controversial because of his involvement in the expulsion of Novatians and Jews from Alexandria and the murder of the pagan philosopher Hypatia. Historians disagree over the extent of his responsibility for these events.&quot;

In view of this statement, and Cyril&apos;s Theology in agreement with the Orthodox Church, I give Cyril the benefit of doubt, but have to read His writings and Mind as these were tumultous times.&quot;The Orthodox scholar John Anthony McGuckin states:&quot;At that time Cyril is revealed at the head of dangerously volatile forces: at their head, but not always in command of them&quot;.

Murder of Hypatia

&quot;Prefect Orestes enjoyed the political backing of Hypatia, a pagan philosopher and scientist who had considerable moral authority in the city of Alexandria, and who had extensive influence. Indeed many students from wealthy and influential families came to Alexandria purposefully to study privately with Hypatia, and many of these later attained high posts in government and the Church. Several Christians thought that Hypatia&apos;s influence had caused Osteres to reject all reconciliatory offerings by Cyril. Modern historians think the Osteres had cultivated his relationship with Hypatia to strenghten a bond with the Pagan community of Alexandria, as she had done with the Jewish one, to handle better the difficult political life of the Egyptian capital.&quot;

&apos;Tis precisely how I see Hypatia the Philosopher and Diplomat and is the way of the Feminine, neither do I hold the pedestrian view of Pagans.

&quot;A Christian mob possibly led by Nitrian monks, however, grabbed Hypatia out of her chariot and brutally murdered her, hacking her body apart and burning the pieces outside the city walls.&quot;

Mystics and Mysteries of Alexandria

&quot;In the uneasy years (of the Arian controversy) that followed many religious leaders became over-involved in politics. Among the most active of theses was Cyril of Alexandria, who was born about 375 A.A. and died in 444. His claim to fame was his conflict with Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople.

&quot;Almost immediately upon his appointment to the leadership of the Christian community Cyril attempted to dominate the secular government. He contributed markedly to the expulsion of Jews from Alexandria; and, when his fanatical orthodoxy led to rioting and civil strive, he made no effort to intervene or pacify the public indignation for which he was responsible until the situation was taken over by the civil administration. He continued his attacks on Nestorius until he brought about his excommunication and banishment for heresy. As a result, Nestorian Christianity moved eastward, setting up churches in several parts of Asia and finally reaching China, where it was hospitably received.


&quot;At the time of Cyril&apos;s succession to the patriarchate in 412 A.D., the outstanding exponent of Neoplatonism and Greek learning in Alexandria was Hypatia, the daughter of Theon of Alexandria. Hypatia was born in Alexandria and after the death of Theon she became the acknowledged leader of the Neoplatonic School of Alexandria. Her extraordinary endowments attracted the attention of many outstanding intellects of her day, among them Synesius, Bishop of the Ptolemais. She was a women of great physical beauty, gentle and modest, and, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, she was the world&apos;s first great women mathematician. The best known book dealing with her life is Hypatia by Charles Kingsley. Though somewhat fictionized, it contains considerable useful information. In his preface Kingsley assures the reader that her personal life was blameless.

&quot;Resolved to destroy the influence of Greek philosophy in Alexandria, Cyril found it expedient to dispose of Hypatia and, probably with his connivance, she was btutally murdered by his followers. Dragged from her chariot by an assassin, her flesh was scraped from her bones with oyster shells.

&quot;After the death of Hypatia it became evident that the golden age of Alexandrian Neoplatonism had come to an end, and those who shared her conviction departed from the city and sought asylum in distant regions. Almost immediately Alexandria lost its leadership as a center of learning.&quot;

As with Cleopatra, so with Hypatia, ended an extraordinary period in our History.

Somewhat different wording

Cyril of Alexandria: Becoming Temples of God

&quot;[John] the Evangelist is not ashamed to declare the Disciples&apos; ignorance and again their knowledge, because he wanted to neglect the shame before the people and to accord with the glory of the Spirit and show who the Disciples were before the resurrection, and who they became after the resurrection... After He was crucified, the veil of the temple was cleaved, in order for us to know that nothing remains hidden from the faithful and friends of God. The Disciples were illumined with the knowledge after the time of resurrection, when the Christ inspired their face and they became other than what they were before. Even more they were illumined at the day of the Pentecost, when they changed to the power of the Holy Spirit that came to them.

&quot;They will be near God and somehow in the first places near Him than anyone else, those who have their heart clean, on whom the Saviour himself says He bestows a great award, when He says that the clean in heart will be blessed, because they will see God. I&apos;ll call to testify that this word is true, this most wise [John the] Evangelist, because he has seen the Glory of Christ, according to his saying, I have seen His Glory, he says, glory as of the only begotten from his Father, full of grace and truth. No one can gather with the eyes of the body the nature that is absolutely invisible to all creation. According to the Saviour&apos;s saying, no one ever saw the Father, except Him who is from the Father, that is the Son; He has seen the father. Those who have their mind clean from worldly stain and the passing care, I mean the care about this life, to them the Christ reveals His glory through a thin (veil?) somehow and above the mind theory, inside which He also reveals the glory of the Father.&quot;

&apos;Tis a simple translation, but the Teaching always the same, Saint Paul&apos;s&quot;The Christ in You the hope of Glory&quot;. Believers and Non-believers ponder this Mystery, and have since time immemorial, and those whose face was and is inspired by Christ never cease to encourage the Seeker.

Many people can not believe in God because:

1. If there WAS a God, how could He allow so many terrible things to happen? He must be a cruel God.

And 2. Because there are so many people who CLAIM to believe in God and yet, ACT as if there is none.

There is one answer which addresses both of these objections: God will NEVER violate our freedom of will, no matter what WE choose to bring into being.

In other words, in both instances, it is WE who are responsible for whatever problems that exist, not God.

At the same time, God is ALWAYS willing to help us to solve the problems we have created, IF WE SO DESIRE.

In order to bring about our complete conversion we have to invite the grace of God into every aspect of our lives; not just once, but without ceasing.
(1 Thessalonians 5:17)

The grace of God cleaves a man in two. God&apos;s grace, coming first at a man&apos;s initial awakening, and afterwards visiting him during the whole period of his conversion, cleaves him in two. It makes him aware of a duality within himself, and enables him to distinguish between what is unnatural and what should be natural; and thus it makes him resolve to sift or winnow out all that is unnatural, so that his God-like nature should be brought fully to light. But obviously such a decision is only the beginning of the undertaking. At this stage it is only with his will and intention that he has left the domain of alien unnaturalness, rejecting it, and aiming at the naturalness which he expects and desires. But in fact his whole structure remains as before-that is, saturated with sin; and passions dominate his soul in all it&apos;s faculties and his body in all it&apos;s functions, just as they did before.

Thus the true life of grace in man is in it&apos;s beginning only a seed, a spark; but a seed sown among tares, a spark constantly smothered by ashes. It is still only a feeble candle glimmering in the densest fog. Man by his conscious choice has attached himself to God, and God has accepted him, has united with him in this point of free choice located in the highest aspect of his soul; his Spirit. And this is the only part of him which is healthy, agreeable to God and saved. All the other parts are still held prisoner and do not want and cannot be obedient to the demands of the new life: the mind as a whole does not yet know how to think in the new way but thinks as before; the will does not yet know how to desire in the new way, but desires as before; the heart does not know how to feel in the new way, but feels as before. It is the same in the body in all it&apos;s functions. Consequently the man is as yet wholly impure except at one point which is the conscious power of free choice within his Spirit. God, being wholly pure, enters into union only with this part to begin with; but all the other parts, being impure, remain outside Him and estranged from Him. He is ready to fill the entire man, but does not do so until the man is purified and illumined; then God makes known His full dwelling in him.

This purification and illumination takes place not from accepting God into our lives only once, but in accepting Him into our lives at all times and in every hour. This is what it means when the Apostle Paul admonishes us to,&quot;Pray without ceasing.&quot;This ceaseless prayer does not consist of the particular words of prayers that we say to ourselves, necessarily, (Although the words of the &apos;Jesus Prayer&apos;,&quot;Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, Have mercy on me!&quot;may be very helpful in the beginning,) but of an inner attitude, a frame of mind as it were, where we continually turn to the Lord in our heart, a standing before the all-seeing presence of God in our heart accompanied by feelings of love for God and surrender to His will for us. To the degree that we remember God and continually invite Him into our lives, to that degree the fire of grace burns brightly in us, entering in and penetrating every aspect of our being entirely, uprooting the alien and unnatural passions which have dominated us up until this point; Sanctifying us and rendering us God-like.

As we continue to cooperate in this inner transformation, our outer environment is transformed as well.

Thank you for these words. In quiet moments everyone senses a pure aspect in him, I think, generally known as&quot;The Inner Child&quot;. &apos;There is a pure part in me not touched by anything, cannot be touched by anything, have mercy on me&apos;, surely this wholly pure Movement I once saw and knew It accepted nothing but perfection. I read the post again before sleep and dreamed an unusual dream, amazing when the outer world interfaces with things wholly unknown in this dimension.

In looking this morning for Saint Anastasia, the Mother of our Patron Saint Steven, whom we will honor in Church this Sunday, I happened upon this story of Saint Herman, Patron Saint of North America.

&quot;Russian sailors coming to Alaska were visiting Father Herman too. Once he was invited on board of a frigate, which sailed from Saint Petersburg. The captain of the ship, a man of excellent education, was sent to America by the Russian tsar to inspect the colonies. The 25 capatain&apos;s subordinates were also well-educated navy officers. And this company was perplexed by a conversation with a modest rather short monk in shabby clothes. The captain himself said later,&quot;We were at a loss what to say, we were fools in front of him!&quot;Father Herman asked them,&quot;What do you like most of all? What would you like to have so you could think yourselves happy?&quot;The answers were about wealth, titles, beautiful wives, position of a captain on a wonderful ship and so on.&quot;Do you agree, sirs,&quot;Father Herman continued, that all of your aspirations can be reduced to one wish: each of you wants to have something that he thinks to be the best and most worthy of love?&quot;Everybody agreed and he continued,&quot;Then tell me what can be better and far more worthy of love than our Lord Jesus Christ Himself? The One who created us and adorned all with perfection, Who gave life, Who provides for all and nourishes all, Who loves all and Who is the best of all people and Who Himself is Love? Shouldn&apos;t we love Him more than anything else and aspire for Him?&quot;Everyone started saying,&quot;Well, of course, this is true! It goes without saying!&quot;And then the old man asked,&quot;Do you really love God?&quot;Everyone said,&quot;Of course, we do. How can we not love God?&quot;&quot;Here I am a sinner, aspiring for 40 years to love God and yet I cannot say that I love Him perfectly,&quot;noted Father Herman and started to explain how one should love God.&quot;If we love someone, we always remember that person, we try to please him or her, and day and night our heart is preoccupied with that person. Do you love God that much? Is it often that you turn to Him, do you always keep Him in mind, are you always praying and following His commandments?&quot;We had to confess that we do not.&quot;For our own benefit, for our happiness, let us at least promise ourselves that from this day, this hour, this minute we will try to love God above all and do His Sacred Will!&quot;This wonderful conversation with St. Herman must have impressed the hearts of those people for the rest of their lives.&quot;

&quot;It was so much pleasure to listen to him that his interlocutors, even the Aleutians and their women, were so enthralled that they reluctantly left him only at sunrise.&quot;

A complimentary story to your post, I thought.

And here is Christ Pantocrator in the main Dome of our Church, the Risen Christ under Whom is my place, the painting of the Wedding in Cana, I mentioned before, and the Chair of the Bishop, where His Grace, Bishop Maxim, abides at times, changes, assisted by the Priests, from a black robe and staff to Bishop&apos;s Attire with Crown and Crozier. Upon exiting the Church one passes by the Icon of Saint Sava, Enlightener of the Serbian people. Every time I pass by I want to stop and stand before the Icon, held by the Saint&apos;s Eyes alive.

One of my favorite Epistle readings this morning:

&quot;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:

And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.

For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.

For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.

For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,

Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.

And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. Re: The Secret of the Universe 
Post by charlotte on Jun 27, 2010, 9:22am

I too noticed that the story of Saint Herman and the sailors is told somewhat dispassionate, and love for oneself is a prerequisite to love others, I think.

Art is the true and happy science of the soul,
exploring nature for spiritual influences,
as doth physical science for comforting powers,
advancing so to a sure knowledge with like progress:
but lovers who thereto look for expression of truth
hav great need to remember that no plastic Art,
tho&apos; it create ideals noble as are the forms
that Pheidias wrought, can ever elude or wholly escape
its earthly medium; nor in its adumbrations
reach thatt detach&apos;d suprasensuous vision, whereto
Poetry and Music soar, nor dive down in the mine
where cold philosophy diggeth her fiery jewels
or only by rare magic may it sometimes escape.

And this was the intuition of our landscape-painters,
whose venture seem&apos;d humbled in renouncing the prize
of the classic contest, when like truants from school
they made off to the fields with their satchels, and came
on nature&apos;s beauteous by-paths into a purer air:
For the Art of painting, by triumph of clouring
enticed to Realism, had confounded thereby
its own higher intention, and in portrayal of spirit
made way for Symbolism which, tho&apos; it stand aloof,
is outfaced in the presence of direct feeling:
Sithence in presentation of feminin beauty
the highest Art lost mastery of its old ideal;
as in the great pictur of the two Women at a Well,
where Titan&apos;s youn genius, devising a new thing,
employ&apos;d the plastic power to exhibit at once
two diverse essences in their value and contrast;
for while by the aesthetic idealization of form
his earthly love approacheth to celestial grace,
his draped Uranian figure is by Symbols veil&apos;d,
and in pictorial Beauty suffereth defeat:
Yes, despite all her impregnable confidence
in the truth of her wisdom, as there she sitteth
beside the fountain, dazzlingly apparel&apos;d, enthroned,
with thoughtful face impassiv, averting her head
as &apos;twer for fuller attention so to incline an ear
to the impartial hearing of the important plea
of the other, ho over-against her on the cornice-plinth
postured her wonted nakedness in sensuous ease,
leaneth her body to&apos;ards her, and with imploring grace
urgeth the vain deprecation of her mortal prayer.

Good Morning,

The more one goes to Church the more the Church goes with one, that is to say, in my case, the interior Architecture and everything depicted in Saint Steven&apos;s Cathedral forms in and impresses Itself ever more clearly on the Mind&apos;s Eye.

I missed Fr. Ceko&apos;s Greetings and bright smile early in the morning, Father Norman served the Matins and Divine Liturgy, and announced later that Fr. Ceko and Family were in Chicago for His Mother, Anastasia Ceko, passed away.

Sunday was the Feast of the Holy Prophet Elisha (Elisei), who&quot;lived in the IX Century before the birth of Christ, and was a native of the village of Abelmaum, near Jordan.&quot;

Elisha, the second Forerunner

Troparion - Tone Four

&quot;An angel in the flesh and the cornerstone of the prophets, the second forerunner of the coming of Christ, Glorious Elijah sent grace from on high to Elisha, to dispel diseases and to cleanse lepers. Therefore, he pours forth healing on those who honor him.&quot;

Elisha picked up the cloak of Eliah, his Teacher,&quot;which fell from the sky - and received the power and prophetic gift of Eliah. And when they went along the way and conversed, there appeared a fiery chariot and horses and parted them both. Elisha cried out:&quot;My Father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horse!&quot;

Elisha gained fame with the Researchers of Vimanas, those mysterious flying vehicles thought to be ancient helicopters, aircraft or UFO&apos;s.

Venerable Anastasia of Serbia

&quot;Saint Anastasia was the mother of St. Sava of Serbia (January 12). She was the daughter of the Byzantine Emperor Romanus, and received the name Anna when she was baptized. Later, she married the Serbian king Stephen Nemanya September 24).

&quot;She finished her life as a nun, receiving the name Anastasia.&quot;

&quot;Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak&quot;(Matthew 26:41)

&quot;Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.

For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.

Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.&quot;(Mark 13:33-37)

 http://www.orthodoxprayer.org/Articles_f....&amp;%20Prayer.html 


The very first step when it comes to watchfulness and prayer is to recollect our senses and to round up our scattered attention, focusing it and leading it within, by an act of the will, to the eye of the heart inside of ourselves.

As the five senses are organs of perception through which we experience the outer world and it&apos;s realities, the eye of the heart is an organ of perception through which we look within and experience, otherwise, invisible realities, more specifically, our own thoughts, the suggestions of the fallen angels and, conversely, the inspirations and vision of God.

Once we have rounded up and placed our attention on the eye of the heart, watchfullness and prayer are our means of guarding the heart from thoughts and evil suggestions.

It has been said that we must,&quot;Guard the eye of the heart from evil suggestions as you would gaurd your physical eye from a needle.&quot;

Watchfulness goes out ahead like a scout, identifying the enemy and prayer is the weapon which we wield in order to destroy the enemy, in particular, the&quot;Jesus prayer.&quot;

The Jesus Prayer,&quot;Lord,Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner,&quot;by invoking the name of Jesus, with humility, dissolves evil suggestions while at the same time, opens us up and invites the Grace of God into our lives which then purifies, heals and transforms us entirely.

Post by charlotte on Jun 30, 2010, 8:47am

One of my favorite Icons on the linked site.

Reading parts of Fr. Damascene&apos;s articles, and judging myself, I&apos;m not doing too bad, having practiced negated negative thoughts for many years, as mentioned, though not with prayer, now almost habitual. All else is private.

Possible Problems

&quot;It is also possible that you may encounter strong emotions during prayer. This can happen as you begin to find a deeper level of concentration and feel like you are about to enter in the place of the heart. If you are overcome with strong emotions simply open your eyes for a moment, make the sign of the cross and a few prostrations and then continue with your prayer. If you experience tears this is a good sign, but do not delight in the tears. They are normally accompanied with a feeling of humility and contrition couple with a profound love for God.&quot;

My first month in Church I had to continually fight back tears. They never seem to ebb.

&quot;Another problem is seeing lights, images or even apperitions. They may even seem like bright ones. Saint Nil Sorski tells us,

&quot;Do not permit yourself any concepts, images, or visions. For vivid images darting to and fro, and flights of fancy do not cease even when the mind stands in the heart and recites prayer: no one is able to rule over them, except those who have attained perfection by the grace of the Holy Spirit, and who have acquired stability of mind through Jesus Christ.&quot;

Saint Gregory the Sinaite warns similarly,

&quot;It must be completely imageless and we must on no account give freedom to the imagination or allow the fancy to form an image of any saint or light; because usually delusions, especially at the beginning deceive the minds of the inexperienced with false fantasies.&quot;

This is good news for I neither see light nor Saint, nor things darting to and fro, or have visions, my mind devoid of these things is drawn into a quiet state of reverence and wonderment.

Fr. John Romanides on Robin Hood and Orthodoxy

For History Lovers

Friday, May 14, 2010

&quot;[Since Robin Hood is being released today, I thought it worthwhile to reflect on what Fr. John Romanides had to say about this interesting legend and the value it has for Orthodox Christians. Since the complete story of Robin Hood will no doubt be overlooked as it always is in film, as well as the historical backdrop which makes the story so fascinating, this brief historical reflection will no doubt be of some interest to movie-goers this weekend. The question to ponder is whether or not the Robin Hood legend is a historical parable of the Frankish takeover of Roman Britain, initiated under the blessing of the new Frankish Pope?

&quot;I have kept the number of the footnotes from the original article which can be found linked under the source of the pericope for reference. The information presented can be examined alongside this website: http://www.robinhoodloxley.net/default.htm. 
J.S.]

Robin Hood - Orthodox Martyr?

&quot;The most famous of the Saxon revolutionary leaders against the Normans was Robin Hood. He had become ill and was taken by Little John to a nunnery where someone recognized him. The Norman nun who was curing him by bloodletting converted this cure into an assassination by letting him bleed to death. Little John and his men escaped to Ireland to continue their war against the Normans.

&quot;So many Saxons made their way to Constantinople New Rome after the Norman conquest to join the Roman Emperor&apos;s Varangian army that they displaced the Scandinavians as the majority. One of the great generals of this Varangian army had been King Herald III Hadrada of Norway (1015-1066). This means that Norway was still Orthodox. He had become the head of the Varangian army under Emperor Zoe (1042-1056). General Harald led his Varangians&quot;to frequent victory in Italy, Sicily and North Africa, also penetrating to Jerusalem. In Italy and Sicily he was fighting Franks and Normans at the time they were getting ready to rid themselves of the facade of Tusculan Roman Popes (1014-1056) in favor of real Franco-Latin Popes....

&quot;The name&quot;Greek&quot;for the Eastern part of the Roman empire was inaugurated by Charlemagne in 794, as already noted. But the term&quot;Byzantine&quot;was established by Great Britain, France and Russia as part of their plan to break up and divide up the Ottoman Empire among them....

&quot;Part of this same plan was to convince Orthodox peasants that the ancient Romans did not speak Greek, like the Romans of Patriarchate of Constantinople, but Latin. Therefore the Church of New Rome cannot be Roman. So it is in reality a Greek Church and nation just like Great father Charlemagne always said.

&quot;In this way the agents of Russia, Britain and France swarmed over the European part of the Ottoman Empire, called the&quot;Land of the Romans&quot;(the Balkans), telling all who for centuries have been calling themselves Romans and getting their education in Greek, that their ethnic enemies are those from the Phanar who also call themselves Romans, but are a bunch of Greeks.&quot;

We Are All The Children Of Byzantium

Professor Judith Herrin of Prineton University and King&apos;s College

&quot;In a lecture named after Steven Runciman it might be appropriate to suggest that he was a child of Byzantium by adoption. He adopted the identity of Bizantinist as a sort of self-definition, and many of us are proud to follow in his footsteps. On such an occasion, it hardly seems necessary to repeat our great dept to Steven, but this is an opportunity to thank our patron, Nicholas Egon, who set up an annual lecture in his name while Steven was still alive. Many will recall the times he sat in the front row and enjoied the lectures of my distinguished predecessor and asked a penetrating question. This evening I would like to draw attention to one of Runciman&apos;s less well known dictums - I often wonder it it was the strenght of Byzantin women that kept the empire going for so long.

&quot;Thanks to the efforts of many scholars the epithets traditionall associated with Byzantium are being rolled back; the bad old steriotypes are being countered by substantive demonstrations of what the empire achieved in its millennial history, and what that means for us today... It&apos;s now possible to stress that from its inception the newly Christianized empire of Rome in the East Mediterranean was in contact with a vast range of other forces, initially Persian, Turkie, even Chinese, and later Islam, pagan Russia, the Slavs, Vikings and Jewish communities among others. These contacts were military, diplomatic, theological and sometimes involved intellectual debate. Not only did Byzantium define its character and role in relation to this wider world, but it also influences even distant countries in the process. Its ancient Greek heritage as well as the formative Eastern, Roman and Christian features all played part in the shaping of Europe, the Balkans and the medieval Mediterranean world.&quot;

 Model for empires 

&quot;Sometimes we may only find these influences at second hand, for instance, in the coronation ritual of European monarchs or the adaption of Roman law to serve a medieval Christian society. But its examples still echo, for instance in a proud monarchy that was also linked to a most unusual cosmopolitanism. In this particular association, Byzantium set a model for most subsequent empires (the Hapsburg, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian and Russian). These were, in the main, true children and descendants of Byzantium. And today, a similar model of acceptance and toleration of difference may be cited as a guiding principle for contemporay metropoleis, like our own London.

&quot;In terms of imperial philantrophy, patronage of the arts, diplomacy and military tactics, Byzantine practice informed and helped to form its neighbors. And in the context of preserving and transmitting ancient wisdom with detailed commentary and explanation, Byzantine scholars excelled in many fields: medical, astronomical, historical and literary. Without making an excessive claim for the Byzantin contribution to world civilization, is we look at it more closely, we can see that Byzantium also continues to be our cousin.

&quot;But now I propose that we all imagine ourselves children of Byzantium for the next 45 minutes or so, while I use the epithet to trace out some of the less obvious ways in which Byzantium continues to have an impact on us today.&quot;

Obvious as I&apos;m writing about it.

&quot;Finally, who also said we are all children of Byzantium?

&quot;In November 2004, in connection with Turkey&apos;s application to join the EU, Jacques Chirac addressed a student conference in Marseille, the day after al large demonstration against Turkish membership. His use of the phrase is interesting on many counts, not least the fact that some Turks are indeed also claiming to be children of Byzantium: They emphasize how firmly the Ottomans maintained imperial traditions into the modern era, preserved Byzantine chancellery, habits, tax-keeping methods, and continued the multicultural and polyglot culture of Byzantium. This is claimed in the spirit of inclusivity and cousinhood, not of bickering and competition.

&quot;So in addition to the Balkan countries, and states emerging from the Russian and Soviet empires, Georgia and Armenia (distinctly different but orthodox), Syria and Lebanon with their ancient Christian communities, other groups such as the Copts of Egypt, can also claim to be children of Byzantium. In this larger family, Greece is our elder brother and sister. But it is also part of a wider group of siblings that is just beginning to be discovered. By drawing attention to the real, symbolic, and imagined children of Byzantium, I think we can expand and enrich our sense of that great civilization.&quot;

The painting&quot;is an allegorical painting by William Holman Hunt representing the figure of Jesus preparing to knock on an overgrown and long-unopened door, illustrating Revelation 3:20. - According to Hunt:&quot;I painted the picture with what I thought, unworthy though I was, to be by Divine command, and not simply as a good subject.&quot;The door in the painting has no handle, and can therefore be opened only from the inside, representing&quot;the obstinately shut mind&quot;. Hunt, 50 years after painting it, felt he had to explain the symbolism.

&quot;The original, painted at night in a makeshift hut in Worcester Park Farm in Surrey, is now in a side room off the large chapel at Keble College, Oxford. Toward the end of his life, Hunt painted a life-size version, which was hung in St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral, London, after a world tour where the picture drew large crowds.&quot;(wiki)

Giorgione, his master, already had gone to death
plague-stricken at prime, when Titian painted thatt picture,
donning his rival&apos;s mantle and strode to higher fame
yet not by this canvas; he who had it, hid it;
nor won it public favour when it came to light,
untill some mystic named it in the Italian tongue
L&apos;AMOR SACRO E PROFANO, and so rightly divined;
for tho&apos; ther is no record save the work of the brush
to tell the intention, yet what the mind wrought is there;
and who looketh thereon may see in the two left arms
the symbolism apportioning the main design;
for while the naked figure with extended arm
and outspredd palmvauntingly balanceth aloft
a little lamp, whose flame lost in the bright daylight
wasteth in the air, thatt other hath the arm bent down
and oppositely nerved, and clencheth with gloved hand
closely the cover&apos;d vessel of her secret fire.

Thus Titian hath pictured the main sense of my text,
and this truth: that as Beauty is ail with Spirit twined,
so all obscenity is akin to the ugliness
which Art would outlaw; whence cometh thatt tinsel honour
and mimicry of beauty which is the attire of vice.

Allegory is a cloudland inviting fancy
to lend significance to chancey shapes; and here
I deem not that the child, who played between the Loves
at Titian&apos;s well, was pictured by him with purpose
to show the first contact of love with boyhood&apos;s mind;
and yet never was symbol more deftly devised:
Mark how the child looking down on the water see&apos;th
only a refelction of the realitiesas &apos;twas
with the mortals in Plato&apos;s cavenor more of them
than Moses saw God; he can see but their backs,
save for a shifty glimpse of the pleading profile
of earthly Love (which also is subtle truth); and most
how in his play his plunged hand strirreth to and fro
both images together in a confused dazzle
of the dancing ripples as he gazeth intent.

Consciousness and Matter

Thinking+Feeling+Willing=Intent

Whatever we INTEND comes into being.

Presently, what we INTEND has to pass through the limits of Time/Space and the laws of Physics. These limits act as a governor and are there to protect us from our own creations which are out of balance and harmony with the over-arching framework of All-That-Is.

This temporary and extremely limited framework of Time/Space and the laws of Physics is what the Fathers of the Church mean by the term, &apos;The World.&apos;

From this perspective, the Church cautions us that to live our lives for the sake of &apos;The world&apos; alone is to miss the whole point of our existence which is, not to try to make the best out of this temporary, limited framework, but to free ourselves from any and all encumbrances that might keep us from becoming more fully who and what we really are truly meant to be.

So, when we say that we, as Orthodox Christians, are not waiting for the end of the world, but rather, running towards it, this is the context within which we mean that statement. We are doing everything in our power to, &apos;Imenentize the Eschaton,&apos; or to, &apos;Bring about the end of the world&apos; in ourselves.

As we are engaged more and more fully in this process of Healing, Purification/Illumination/Deification Which is at the heart of Orthodox Spirituality, the limits of this temporary, protective framework begin to recede and, what we INTEND begins to come into being more and more instantaneously until, an &apos;Omega point&apos; is reached where whatever we Intend comes into being entirely instantaneously and we are ushered into another life which is Eternal, Everlasting, without effort, needs or limits of any kind-a perfect world of limitless creative freedom.

Most people do not&quot;Get&quot;Christianity these days because it uses a different language to describe itself, a language which has been re-defined over the centuries to mean something entirely different to us than what was originally intended. To truly begin to understand what Christianity is about, we have to go back to what it&apos;s original definitions of the language it uses first were. This is only one of the benefits of Orthodoxy, which has gone out of it&apos;s way to preserve and hand down, to the best of it&apos;s ability, the original understandings, beliefs and practices of the first Christians.

Jesus, for us, is not merely an historical teacher or a mythical figure, but a living being with whom we may enter into an intimate, telepathic, personal relationship with.

It is this intimate and personal relationship which opens the door for us into possibilities which are, &apos;Not of this world.&apos; These possibilities bring us, gradually and consistently, step by step, from this world into the next. Re: The Secret of the Universe

One thing I noticed about the Church is the transparency of the activities of the Clergy, so I feel free to wite about it. For instance, Father Ceko told me&quot;last week I was&quot;here or there,&quot;then we had to&quot;do this or the other,&quot;my Wife told me&quot;, etc.

Father Ceko and Family are on vacation, hence Fr. Norman served the Matins and Holy Liturgy of Saint Chrisostom. In His Homily, Fr. Norman remarked that seeing ourselves as we truly are is a greater feat then the raising from the dead.

The reading from the Epistle of Saint Paul to the Romans was also appropriate to using our gifts and powers.

&quot;Brethren, having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, let us prophecy in proportion to our faith; or ministry, let us use it in our ministering; he who teaches, in teaching; he who exhorts, in exortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be without hypocrisy. Abbhor what is evil. Cling to what is good. Be kindly affectioned to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another; not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing steadfast in prayer; distributing to the needs of the saints, given to hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.&quot;

Quote of the Day

&quot;Miracles are a retelling in small letters of the very same story which was written across the whole world in letters too large for some of us to see&quot;
C.S. Lewis

In leaving the Church we pass by the Icon of Saint Sava above the Bishop&apos;s Chair, whose eyes draw mine to His so livingly as if knowing my Mind, Heart, and Soul, and I have to avert mine at times. Yesterday, not so many People behind me, I made a few steps to the side, turned my head a bit and for the first time noticed the symbol on a round broadloom His Grace, when present, stands on. Indeed.

A great week to All

Our thoughts determine our lives

 http://orthodoxincense.com/images/Books/OurThoughts.JPG 

For those who hold this philosophy of life; that we were created to be &apos;Like&apos; God, that we are co-creators with God, that God is continually creating and re-creating the entire multiverse from micro-second to micro-second; we find ourselves in a unique place of personal responsibility for the quality of our life.We find that, when we are in an interior state of balance and harmony with All-That-Is, then everything seems to flow smoothly and work together for good.

When there is any kind of pain, suffering, discord of any kind, it is a clear indication that we are out of balance and harmony and need to, immediately, readjust our inner relationship with All-That-Is.

This interior awareness of our alignment or, non-alignment , as the case may be, becomes the source of our sense of ethics and morality.

One quickly begins to realize that, particularly in these beginning stages, before our interior oneness with God is fully established, to what degree that we are consistently out of balance and harmony with All-That-Is.

If we are fortunate, we also discover that God is ever-present and always ready, willing and able to help us in everything, IF WE SO DESIRE and are asking for help.

Thus we begin to learn what it means to,&quot;Pray without ceasing.&quot;

We have been given complete freedom of will when it comes down to what we choose to bring into being. And yet, in any given moment, our choices range between only two catagories: What IS and what should never be...

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtoeOQksSzE 

If we are honest with ourselves, and truly desire what is best for all concerned, we will trust in Divine providence and realize that, although we can&apos;t always get what we want, we get what we need...

We have fallen out of our original blessed state; but, by the Grace of God we can get back to where we once belonged...

This morning I met Prince Marko, Hero of epic Serbian Poetry.

&quot; King Marko was an independant Serbian feudal lord in Macedonia from 1371-1395. Marko was venerated as a national hero by the Serbs and Bulgarians and he was also the protagonist of many epic poems. Folklore came to remember him as a respected protector and savior of the Christians during the period of early Ottoman Turkish occupation of Macedonian region.

&quot;Serbian epic poems attribute to Marko superhuman strenght: He is said to be able to squeeze water from cornel dried for nine years; his weapon of choice is said to be a mace (of 85 kilograms); the horse he chose was said to be the only one he could not throw over his shoulder.

&quot;The poems also assert his knightly valor: Even though he is prone to short-tempered outbursts, he remains a protector of the poor and the helpless, a guardian of the law and order, even when to his disadvantage. In one song he mourns killing a better hero, Musa, the Albanian robber, in another, he decides on the rightful ruler of the Serbian Empire, Uros, even though his dishonesty could have benefited his own father or his uncles. It is told that he chose to die when guns were invented (thus living for hundreds of years) and when he saw that&quot;every coward can kill a hero,&quot;even from a distance. By some legends even in death he only sleeps, waiting in a cave until he is needed again, a typical king in the mountain motif.&quot;

&quot; Marko in Bulgarian epic poetry 

&quot;Krali Marko is one of the most popular characters in the Bulgarian folklore from Macedonia for centuries. According to local legend, his mother was Evrosiya, sister of the Bulgarian voivode Momchil, who ruled territories in the Rhodope Mountains. At the birth of Krali Marko, three narecnitsi (fate-fairies) appeared and foretold that he would become a hero and replace his father, the king. When king Volkasin heard this he threw his son in a basket in the river to get rid of him. But a samodiva (also called samovila) named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko suckled the samodiva&apos;s milk, he acquired supernatural powers. He is portrayed as a Bulgarian fighter for freedom against the Turks. He has a winged horse, called Sharkolia (meaning Dappled) and a stepsister the samodiva Gyura. The Bulgarian legends incorporate important fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, even though the Bulgarian folk epos from Macedonia from Macedonia was created as late as 14-18th century.&quot;

Aren&apos;t Legends great? I hope you enjoy this equally great Ballad.

 Marco and the Turks, c. 1450 

VIZIER AMURATH is gone a-hunting;
Hunting in in the leafs mountain-forest:
With him hunt twelve warriors, Turkish heroes:
With the heroes hunts the noble Marko:
White days three they hunted in the mountain;
Nothing found they in the mountain-forest.
They a lake, a green-faced lake, discover,
Where a flock of gold-wing&apos;d ducks are swimming.

There the proud vizier lets looose his falcon,
Bids him pounce upon a gold wing&apos;d swimmer;
But the falcon turned his glances upwards,
And he mounted to the clouds of heaven.
To the proud vizier said princely Marko:
&quot;Vizier Amurath! is it allow&apos;d me
to let loose my own, my favorite falcon?
He a gold-wing&apos;d duck shall doubtless bring thee.&apos;
And the Moslem swiftly answer&apos;d Marko:

&quot;&apos;Tis allow&apos;d thee Marko! I allow thee.&quot;
Then the princely Marko loosed his falcon;
To the clouds of heaven aloft he mounted;
Then he sprang upon the gold-wing&apos;d swimmer---
Seized him---rose---and down the fell together.
When the bird of Amurath sees the struggle,
He becomes indignant with vexation:
&apos;Twas of old his custom to play falsely---
For himself alone to grip his booty:
So he pounces down on Marko&apos;s falcon,
To deprive him of his well-earn&apos;d trophy.
But the bird was valiant as his master;
Marko&apos;s falcon has the mind of Marko;
And his gold-wing&apos;d prey he will not yield him.
Sharply turns he round on Amurath&apos;s falcon,
And he tears away his proudest feathers .
Soon as the vizier observes the contest,
He is fill&apos;d with sorrow and with anger;
Rushes on the falcon of prince Marko,
Flings him fiercely &apos;gainst a verdant fir tree,
And he breaks the falcon&apos;s dexter pinion.
Marko&apos;s golden falcon groans in suffering,
As the serpent hisses from the cavern.
Marko flies to help his favorite falcon,
Binds with tenderness the wounded pinion,
And with stifled rage the bird addresses:
&quot;Woe for thee, and woe for me, my falcon!
I have left my Serbians,---and all those wrongs have suffer&apos;d.&quot;
Then the hunters in their course pass&apos;d by him---
Pass&apos;d him by, and left him sad and lonely.

This Book is on my mind ever since you posted it first, besides a hundred others to be read, Groucho&apos;s cart, while trying to finish that Novel, not to mention the endless online Resources, not forgetting to eat and sleep between work. Fie on small talk.

I don&apos;t know what other people do, if anything, as no one wants to talk about Religion, except Fr. Ceko and You, I readjust my inner relationship with All-That-Is, &apos;Be still and know that I am God&apos;, and have done so for many years though not as often, to keep my sanity, and also know to some degree, in rare times and not just momentarily, completely, the state of being in harmony with All-That-Is by Virtue of Love.

What IS and what should never be? What issues with me is that my dreams are still as new, ever the same, cannot be less or more, vouchsafe my life Above and Below to get back to where I once and will always belong.

This morning I read much about the Emperor Constantine as he a Saint&quot;in the Orthodox Church, although not in the Western Church. His great merit, from a Christian point of view, was in legalizing Christianity. His personal activities in other areas are less appealing.&quot;

Eusebius of Caesarea on the Life of Constantine

&quot; Eusebius of Caesarea was the bishop of Caesarea in Palestine during the early fourth century. He was a prominent personality during the period when Christianity was recognized by Constantine the Great, ending the persecutions, and he participated in the First Council of Nicea. He is famous for his writings, particularly his Church History or Ecclesiastical History (Historia Ecclesiastica). He is often referred to as Eusebius Pamphili because of his close friendship with Pamphilius, the founder of the major library in Caesarea.

&quot;Eusebius&apos; Life of Constantine (Vita Constantini is a eulogy, and therefore its style and selection of facts are affected by its purpose, rendering it inadequate as a continuation of the Church History. As the historian Socrates Scholasticus said at the opening of his history, which was designed as a continuation of Eusebius:&quot;Also in writing the life of Constantine, this same author has but slightly treated of matters regarding Arius, being more intent on the rhetorical finish of his composition and the praises of the emperor, than on an accurate statements of facts.&quot;The work was unfinished at Eusebius&apos; death&quot;.

 http://orthodoxwiki.org/Eusebius_of_Caesarea 

Implying that Eusebius&apos; writings of Constantine have to be taken with a grain of salt resolving His words to descern truths. I read before on Constantine and now understand why there was always something amiss.

A few excerpts of Eusebius&apos; writings.

His Humane Treatment of Prisoners

&quot;Thus the emperor and his army had long been accustomed to act, whenever there was a prospect of an engagement ; for his God was ever present to his thoughts, and he desired to do everything according to his will, and conscientiously to avoid any wanton sacrifice of human life. He was anxious thus for the preservation not only of his own subjects, but even of his enemies. Accordingly he directed his victorious troops to spare the lives of their prisoners, admonishing them, as human beings, not to forget the claims of their common nature. And whenever he saw the passions of his soldiery excited beyond control, he repressed their fury by a largess of money, rewarding every man who saved the life of an enemy with a certain weight of gold. And the emperor&apos;s own sagacity led him to discover this inducement to spare human life, so that great numbers even of the barbarians were thus saved, and owed their lives to the emperor&apos;s gold.&quot;

&apos;Twas good bribery, one could say, works great today, mostly to the contrary.

An Illustration from Ancient Times

&quot;FOR certainly anyone who will mentally retrace the course of events from the earliest period down to the present time, and will reflect on what has occurred in past ages, will find that all who have made justice and probity the basis of their conduct, have not only carried their undertakings to a successful issue, but have gathered, as it were, a store of sweet fruit as the produce of this pleasant root. Again, whoever observes the career of those who have been bold in the practice of oppression or injustice; who have either directed their senseless fury against God himself, or have conceived no kindly feelings toward their fellow-men, but have dared to afflict them with exile, disgrace, confiscation, massacre, or other miseries of the like kind, and all this without any sense of compunction, or wish to direct thoughts to a better course, will find that such men have received a recompense proportioned to their crimes. And these are the results which might naturally and reasonably be expected to ensue?&quot;

How often it is said loosely&quot;what goes around comes around&quot;, and if we could keep it conscious to become first nature, we would be great co-creators with God.

The Czech and Slovac Orthodox Church

The Orthodox Church of the Czech lands and Slovakia is a self-governing body of the Eastern Orthodox Church that territorially covers the countries of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The primate is his Beatitude, Metropolitan Christopher of Prague and the Czech Lands and Slovakia, who was elected on May 2, 2006.

&quot;The Church of the Czech Lands and Slavakia presents both an ancient history as well as a very modern history. The present day Church occupies the land of Moravia, where the brothers Ss. Cyril and Methodius began their missions to the Slavs, introducing the liturgical and canonical order of the Orthodox Church, translated into the Church Slavonic language. In doing this they developed the first Slavonic alphabet. This mission was destroyed after Methodius died in 885, as Pope Stephen V of Rome forced all disciples of the brothers to leave the countryside which is now the Czech Rebublic. The Orthodox order survived in present day Slovakia due to its nearness to Kievan Rus&apos; until the union with Rome was instituted by the Viennese Court.&quot;

After WW I many people joyned the Serbian Church, among them&quot;was a Roman Catholic priest, Matthias Pavlic&quot;whom the Serbian Church&quot;consented to consecrate Fr. Matthias as bishop of the Orthodox Church with the name Gorazd.&quot;

&quot;As the Orthodox leader in the new nation of Czechoslovakia, Bp. Gorazd laid the foundation of the Orthodox Church throughout Bohemia, Moravia, and into Slovakia.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_and_Slovak_Orthodox_Church 

Bishop Gorazd&quot;revived the Orthodox Church in Moravia, the Church of Czechoslovakia, after World War I. During World War II, having provided refuge for the assassins of SS-Obergruppenfuhrer Reinhard Heydrich, called The Butcher of Prague, in the cathedral of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Prague, Godarzd took full responsibility for protecting the patriots after the Nazi overlords found them in the crypt of the cathedral. This act guaranteed his execution, thus his martyrdom, during the reprisals that followed.&quot;

Saint Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia

Wenceslaus was Duke of Bohemia from 921 until his death. He is known in Germany, and&quot;best known in the English-speaking world as the subject of the Christmas carol&quot;Good King Wenceslaus.

&quot;He was the son of Vratislav I, Duke of Bohemia from the Pfemyslid dynasty. His father was raised in a Christian milieu through his own father, Borivoj, who was converted by Saitn Cyril and Saint Methodius, the&quot;apostles to the Slavs&quot;. His mother Drahomira was the daughter of a pagan trible chief of Havolans and was baptized at the time of her marriage. Wenceslaus&apos; murder in September of 953 was the result of a plot involving his younger brother Boleslav O of Bohemia. He was venerated as Saint Wenceslaus and is the main patron saint of the Czech state.&quot;

Saint Wenceslaus also sleeps in a Mountain Range and will awaken with his army of Knights&quot;to aid the Czech people when they face ultimate danger&quot;.

The largest Free Clinic in the Roman Empire was founded by

Sampson the Hospitable

&quot; Sampson the Hospitable (died c.530) was a citizen of Constantinople who devoted his time to serving the poor of the city. He is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Churches.

&quot;Sampson was born in Rome to a prominent family. He was a physician who devoted much of his time to helping the poor and the sick. He turned his home into a free clinic, providing his patients with food and lodging as well as medical care. he was later ordained a priest by the patriarch. When the Byzantine Emperor Justinian the Great became ill he sent for Sampson to cure him. He was the only physician in the city to do the emperor any good, and the emperor wanted to reward him.&quot;

Saint Sampson told the Emperor that He had silver and gold and other riches and gave it all up for the sake of Christ. The Saint is said to have healed the Emperor by touching him.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampson_the_Hospitable 

Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, Justinian the Great (c. 483-565) was one&quot;of the most important figures of the Late Antiquity and the last emperor to speak Latin as a first language. Justinians rule constitutetes a distinct epoch in the history of the Eastern Roman Empire.&quot;

Since all Ethick implyeth a sense of Duty in man,
&apos;tis first to enquire whence that responsibilty OUGHT arose;
a call so universal and plain-spoken that some
hav abstracted a special faculty, distinct
from animal bias and underivable,
whereby the creature kenneth the creator&apos;s Will,
that, in stillness of sound speaking to gentle souls,
drowneth all silence with the joy of his presence;
but to men savage or superstitious a voice
of horror, maleficent, inescapable,
houding them with fearful conviction of sin, as when
Adam and Eve hid from the scour of God&apos;s eye.
Which old tale of displeasur is true to life: because
the imperativ obligation cannot be over-summ&apos;d,
being in itself the self-conscience of thatt Essence
which is no other indeed than the prime ordinance
that we call Law of Nature,in its grade the same

with the determining instinct of unreasoning life,

all insubordination is imperfection in kind.

Reality appeareth in forms to man&apos;s thought
as several links interdependent of a chain
that circling returneth upon itself, as doth
the coil&apos;d snake that in art figureth eternity.
From Universal Mind the first-born atoms draw
their function, whose rich chemistry the plants transmute
to make organic life, whreon animals feed
 to fashion sight and sense and give service to man 
who sprung from them is conscient in his last degree
of ministry unto God, the Universal Mind,
whither all effect returned whence it first began.
The Ring in its repose is Unity and Being:
Causation and Existence are the motion thereof.
Thru&apos;out all runneth Duty, and the conscience of it
is thatt creativ faculty of animal mind 
that, wakening to self-conscience of all Essences,
closeth the full circle, where the spirit of man
escaping from the bondage of physical Law
re-entereth eternity by the vision of God.

The Alchemists mean the complete transformation of matter and without exception declared&quot;All Glory be to God&quot;. Everything we give to the Earth transforms it for degeneration or regeneration, and it is obvious that the Earth groans with us. The new Heaven and Earth may be when all is regenerated, or at least the New outways the old by a great margin and a new cycle can begin. That is, below. I once understood to the NTH degree that life can never not be, Creation may&quot;sleep&quot;for a while but must awaken again. Maybe that&apos;s why the Church teaches that Christ is&quot;pre-eternal with the Father&quot;, and then born of the Panagia and ever Virgin Mary. It is a Mystery, the Church teaches, not given a chance by Literalists.

Surprised again&quot;O, Your Grace&quot;, I stepped back but D. had her back to Him and I didn&apos;t know how to quickly stop her from talking and pull her to the side a bit, but I know by the smile that the whole scene amused His Grace.

Fr. Norman commented on what is meant by&quot;the truth shall make you free&quot;, that truth splinters into as many fragents as there are people.&quot;Grant us in this world knowledge of Thy truth, and in the world to come life everlasting.&quot;

 Quote of the Day 

 &quot;When humans should have become as perfect in voluntary obedience as the inanimate creation is in its lifeless obedience, then they will put on it glory, or rather that greater glory of which Nature is only the first sketch.&quot; 

C. S. Lewis, The weight of Glory 

 Did You Know? 

&quot;The gospels and epistles and all of the books which comprise the New Testament scriptures were written in the first century. Also at this time, the first Christian communities were established in the main cities of Asia Minor and Greece, and most probably North Africa. The Church was also established in the capital city of Rome. Contrary to what is sometimes thought, the Christian Church was first an urban phenomenon which only later spread to rural areas. Also, it was composed mainly of people from what we would call today the&quot;higher classes&quot;of society. Thus, it is not true that Christianity gained foothold in the world of the uneducated and backward people who were looking for heavenly consolation in the face of oppressive and unbearable earthly conditions.&quot;

Of the&quot;upper classes&quot;of the&quot;early&quot;Church I have given numerous examples, viz., Kings, Queens, and many born of noble and wealthy families, who gave all their possessions to the poor, established Hospitals and homes orphans and the homeless, and became Saints, Monks or Martyrs, so it can hardly be maintained as it is continually touted that those Personalities conspired to herd in all the gullable sheep to take their possession and lord their power over them. Their intention and power was other. This Humanity or&quot;human life-wave&quot;, as one of my Teachers called it, are not only we who are alive, but also our Ancestors and Descendants, all bound together, and&quot;the dead will be raised on Judgement Day&quot;.

The Church spread from the cities to rural areas, to the land dwellers or pagans. So little of what IS.

Have a great week

Today is the feast of the pre-eminent Apostles; Sts. Peter and Paul.

 http://www.executedtoday.com/images/Peter_and_Paul_icon.jpg 

From this day forth throughout the liturgical year we enter into the Apostles labor. As it is written in the Scriptures:

&quot;Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.

And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.

And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.

I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.&quot;(John 4:35-38)

And:

&quot;Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.&quot;(Matthew 9:37-38)

This coming sunday&apos;s Gospel will be really good. Stay tuned... Re: The Secret of the Universe

I saw Sts. Peter and Paul on my calendar yesterday, but once again was drawn into Chuch History.

Since the Taxi Driver told me that the Armenians were the first Christians to look for the fire, I searched for the origin of such a statement and came upon another Taxi Passenger&apos;s words:

&quot;An Armenian taxidriver in Los Angeles recently told a friend of mine that the Armenian alphabet was derived from the Ethiopian alphabet (actually, syllabary). This very astonishing notion would involve both dismissal of the historical record for Armenia and remarkable abnegation of national claims that usually only expand, not retreat -- as some Ethiopians say that their alphabet was invented autochthanously rather than derived from the Old South Arabian, as it was. I am very curious how this notion got started and if the Armenians who pass it on even know about St. Mesrop.&quot;

St. Mesrop is mentioned in the last link, anyway, this article takes another direction, but my Taxi Drivers comment on fire might originate with

Tiridates III of Armenia

&quot;In 301, Tiridates proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of Armenia, making the Armenian kingdom the first state to officially embrace Christianity. He is recognized as a saint by the Armenian Apostolic Church.&quot;

King Tiridates III was the son of Khosrov II of Armenia, who was assassinated&quot;by a Parthian agent named Anak&quot;, and one of the Sons of Anak was none other than Gregory the Illuminator.

Conversion

&quot;The traditional story of the conversion of the king and the nation tells of how Gregory the Illuminator, the son of Anak, was a Christian convert who, feeling guilty for his own father&apos;s sin, joined the Armenian Army and worked as a secretary to the king. Christianity in Armenia had a strong footing by the end of the 3rd century AD but the nation by and large still followed Zoroastrianism.&quot;

The rest of the story is also interesting, but the tradition of the Armenians being the first Christian to &apos;look for the fire&apos;, (or look back) according to my Taxi Driver, might have its origin with the Fire Philosopher Zoroaster.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiridates_III_of_Armenia 

The&quot;legendary patriarch and founder of the Amenian nation&quot;is Hayk, as&quot;told in the History attributed to Moses of Chorene.&quot;

&quot;Hayk was a handsome, friendly man, with curly hair, sparkling eyes, and strong arms. He was a man of giant statue, a mighty archer and fearless warrier. Hayk and his people, from the time of their forefathers Noah and Japheth, had migrated south toward the warmer lands near Babylon. In that land there ruled a wicked giant, Bel. Bel tried to impose his tyranny upon Hayk&apos;s people. But proud Hayk refused to submit to Bel. As soon as his son Aramaneak was born, Hayk rose up, and led his people back to the land of his forefathers, the land of Ararat. At the foot of the mountains, he built his home, Haykashen.&quot;

Hayk defeats Bel in battle at&quot; Gerezmank&quot;, and according to comparative mythology:

&quot;The figure slain by Hayk&apos;s arrow is variously given as Bel or Nimrod. Hayk is also the name of the Orion constellation in the Armenian translation of the Bible. Just as Hayk fled from Babylon because of Bel, whom he eventually killed, so Zeus had escaped to the mountains of the Caucasus, later to return to Sicily and hurl fatal arrows into the bodies of his titanic foes.&quot;

Prehistoric Armenia

&quot;The Armenian Highland shows traces of settlement from the Neolithic era. The Shulavery- Shomu culture of the central Transcaucasus region is one of the earliest known prehistoric culture in the area, carbon-dated to roughly 6000 - 4000 BC&quot;.
(The recent article I posted to facebook gives 4000 - 3000 Bc)

Modern Armenia

If you scroll down, on the right below the&quot;American Athena&quot;, you can clearly see Noah&apos;s Ark, retrieved by the Armenians and converted into a Government Building I thought it was in London, when I first saw the Building which looks just like the Ark, I thought, ahh, that&apos;s where it is.

Armenia, Persia, , Rome, Parthia, and Ethiopia

&quot;Like the Bosporan Kingdom, the history of Armenia stretches from the Golden Age of Greece through the Hellenistic Period to protracted status as a Rome, and Persian, client. The differences are that Armenia was not a Greek colony but the realm of an indigenous people of Anatolia, like the Phrygians and the Cappadocians, and Armenia outlived all the Greek colonies, all the other ancient kingdoms of Anatolia, and even Rome itself. Armenia was long subject to a long military and diplomatic tug-or-war between Rome and Parthia, then Rome and Persia, and finally Rome and Islam. Even today the Armenian language reflect strong Persian influence -- which has made it difficult to determine the affinities of Armenian with other Indo-European languages. Deep Roman influence is evident in the fact that Armenia converted to Christianity in 301 AD, more than a decade before Christianity had any official toleration or status in Romania itself. Armenia has thus traditionally been regarded as the first officially Christian country, though, with uncertainties in dating, Ethiopia may be able to challenge this.&quot;

List of Royal Saints and Martyrs

&quot;This list of royal saints and martyrs is a list of monarchs, other royals, and nobles who have been canonized or beatified, or who are otherwise named or revered as saints and martyrs in Christian Churches.&quot;

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_royal_saints_and_martyrs 

Abgar V of Edessa, and the Image of Christ&quot;modernly known as the Holy Shroud of Turin.&quot;

Perhaps I should first say that in writing from sources of conventional History, I fret not too much about&quot;according&quot;to whomever, but am more interested in the essence of an account or legend.

 The legend of King Abgar 

&quot;Abgar was, according to Assyrian tradition, the first Christian king in history, having been converted to the faith by the Apostle Thaddeus of Edessa. Abgar was an Assyrian king in the city of Edessa. Other accounts regard this a mere legend, equating the Abgar in the story with the Syrian Abgar IX, a late second century convert to Christianity. Moses of Khoren suggests that the name of the legendary figure is a corruption of an individual&apos;s title:&quot;... Because of his umcommon modesty and wisdom, and his old age, this Abgaros was given the title of Avag Hair (Senior Father). The Greeks and Assyrians, unable to articulate his name correctly, called him Abgar.

&quot;The legend tells that Abgar, king of Edessa, afflicted with an incurable sickness, had heard the fame of the power and miracles of Jesus and wrote to him, acknowledging his divinity, craving his help, and offering him asylum in his own residence; the tradition states that Jesus wrote a letter declining to go, but promising that after his ascension, he would send one of his disciples, endowed with his power.&quot;

Eusebius of Caesarea states that Thaddeus of Edessa, who converted the King, was sent by Thomas the Apostle in AD 29.

The Letter from King Abgar to Jesus

&quot;Abgar Ouchama to Jesus, the Good Physician Who has appeared in the country of Jerusalem, greeting:

&quot;I have heard of Thee, and Thy healing; that Thou dost not used medicines or roots, but by Thy word openest (the eyes) of the blind, makest the lame to walk, cleansest the lepers, makest the deaf to hear; how by Thy word (also) Thou healest (sick) spirits and those who are tormented with lunatic demons, and how, again, Thou raisest the dead to life. And, learning the wonders that Thou doest, it was born in upon me that (of two things, one): either Thou hast come down from heaven, or else Thou art the Son of God, who bringeth all these things to pass. Wherefore I write to Thee, and pray that Thou will come to me, who adore Thee, and heal all the ill that I suffer, according to the faith I have in Thee. I also learn that the Jews murmer against Thee, and persecute Thee, that they seek to crucify Thee, and Destroy Thee. I possess but one small city, but it is beautiful, and large enough for us two to live in peace.&quot;

A good Prayer, really, for to raise the dead of this world to Life.

The Doctrina then continues:

&quot;When Jesus had receivd the letter, in the house of the high priest of the Jews, He said to Hannan, the secretary,&quot;Go thou, and say to they master, who hath sent thee to Me: &apos;Happy art thou who hast believed in Me, not having seen Me, for it is written of Me that those who shall see Me shall not believe in Me, and that those who shall not see Me shall believe in Me. As to that which thou hast written, that I should come to thee, (behold) all that for which I was sent here below is finished, and I ascend again to My Father who sent Me, and when I shall have ascended to Him I will send thee one of my disciples, who shall heal all thy sufferings, and shall give (thee) health again, and shall convert all who are with thee unto life eternal. And the city shall be blessed forever, and the enemy shall never overcome it.&quot;

Eusebius says that Jesus Himself wrote the letter, but Biblical Scholars now generally think the letter(s) were fabricated.

King Abgar told Jesus that his city was small but beautiful, and large enough for the two of them to live in it, intimating that he probable meant his body which will be healed and blessed forever.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abgarus_of_Edessa 

The Image of Edessa, not made by human hands

&quot;John of Damascus, the leading architect of the church dogma favoring icons, specifically mentioned that Jesus&quot;is said to have taken a piece of cloth and pressed it to his face, impressing on it the image of his face, which it keeps to this day.

&quot;This latter concept of an&quot;image not made by hands&quot;( acheiropoietos) formed the foundation on which the Eastern Orthodox doctrine of icons was later created in the 8th century. This doctrine held that Jesus made the first icon of himself by pressing a wet towel to his face, miraculously imprinting the cloth with his features thus creating the prototype for all icons of Jesus, and an implied divine approval for their creation. The image is modernly known as the Holy Shroud of Turin.&quot;

The Holy Shroud of Turin as we generally know it, is said to be the cloth in which Jesus&apos; body was wrapped in the tomb. Here, the Image of Edessa is different and looks painted.

The&quot;Image Not-made-by-hands&quot;of the Orthodox Church.&quot;We call Christ&apos;s image &apos;Christ&apos; ... The Icon of Christ is nothing other than Christ, apart, of course, from the difference in essence&quot;.

Treasure in Heaven

&quot;Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:

For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&quot;(Matthew 6:19-21)

&quot;From the first moment of the awakening of the spirit by grace, man&apos;s consciousness and yearning pass from the creation to the Creator, from the earthly to the Heavenly, from the temporal to the eternal. In this realm lies his treasure, and there is his heart. He does not expect anything here, all his hopes are in the world beyond. His heart withdraws from whatever belongs to this world, nothing in it attracts him, he does not set his expectation on anything here and does not look for present joy. It is in the good things to come that he rejoices, it is these that he firmly hopes to posses. This transplanting of a man&apos;s treasure and the hopes of his heart is an essential feature of the awakened and burning spirit. It makes man essentially a pilgrim on earth, seeking his Fatherland, the Heavenly Jerusalem.&quot;(From &apos;The Art of Prayer)

&quot;Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer.&quot;(Romans 12:12)

Now, this might seem to some to be some sort of, &apos;Pie in the sky&apos; spirituality, but for those who have ears to hear, they recognize that the Resurrection is a BODILY Resurrection and that,&quot;the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.&quot;(Romans 8:21)

These hieroglyphic figures shall serve as two ways to lead into the heavenly life; the first and most open sense teaching the sacred mysteries of our salvation; (as I will show hereafter) the other teaching every man that hath any small understanding in the stone, the linier way of the work, which being perfected by any one, the change of evil into good, takes away from him the root of all sin (which is covetousness) making him likeable, gentle, pious, religious, and fearing God, how evil soever he was before. For from thence forward he is continuously ravished with the great grace and mercy which he hath optained from God, and with the profoundness of his Divine and admirable work.&quot;

Even though Saint, Sage, and Alchemist affirm that we are gods, and&quot;Horus reckons thee among the gods&quot;, it can&apos;t be believed for not understood and so far from being taught correctly.

Years ago I asked my Friend, a staunch Catholic and now assistant Minister who wanted me to rejoin the Church, how does the Priest comment on&quot;Ye are gods&quot;, and&quot;be ye wise as serpents&quot;. She said she doesn&apos;t know about that, only that she is going to Jesus upon dying.

You might remember, in the very beginning, when I posted the &apos;Diamond Poem&apos;, and because it is so beautiful....

Power of the Light, all-merciful and healing,
Of heaven&apos;s Arch, the vessel surrogate,
Reach thou my dark, each blot and lack revealing,
Till my dull sphere by thine is permiate;
Undo the fetters of this self-made prison,
Anb by thy solvent make me all atoned,
Until from earth&apos;s sepulchral shadows risen,
(Love&apos;s child redeemed that long in tears has groaned)
The upward path I take, by Fire ensplendoured,
And from this cindered flesh through pain untold,
Despite despair, in death past death regendered,
Earth&apos;s lead transmute to heaven&apos;s eternal gold.

Part out my pigmy; from this coal shall rise
The living Stone, the Diamond of the Wise.

Commentary on the five Loaves and two Fish

&quot;A spritual interpretation of this miracle given by the Fathers teaches that the five loaves idicate the five books of the Law (Genesis through Deuteronomy), which are broken open in Christ and thus feed the universe. The two Fish represent the Gospel Book and the Epistle Book, the teachings of the fishermen. The gathering of the leftovers by the apostles shows that the teachings the faithful are unable to grasp are nevertheless held in the consciousness of the Church. May our Lord Jesus Christ continue to fill our hunger with His word.&quot;

Hi Don,

Maybe you haven&apos;t read all of Steven&apos;s posts. Page 27, # 397

&quot;One thing I do know for sure, from my own experience, is that, the more conscious we are of our oneness with God, the more immediately matter responds to the touch of our consciousness, what we INTEND will come into being INSTANTANEOUSLY.

&quot;That is how&quot;MIRACLES&quot;occur. There are no miracles, simply a higher determinism which enters into and supersedes the time/space laws of physics which we are familiar with and which act as a governor and buffer for us until we are able to create at will with responsibility towards the whole.&quot;

Jesus spoke many Parables and the Church Fathers explain many things. Steven too, has given much insight.

This absolution of Reason is not for all to see:
But any man may picture how Duty was born,
and trace thereafter its passage in the ethick of man.
Ther is a youg black ouzel, now building her nest
under the Rosemary on the wall, suspiciously
shunning my observation as I sit in the porch,
intentiv with my pencil as she with her beak:
Coud we discourse together, and wer I to ask for-why
she is making such pother with thatt rubbishy straw,
her answer would be surely: &apos;I know not, but I MUST.&apos;
Then coud she take persuasion of Reason to desist
from a purposeless action, in but a few days hence
when her eggs wer to hatch, she would look for her nest;
and if another springtide found us here again,
with memory of her fault, she would know a new word,
having made conscient from the MUST to the OUGHT.
I halt not then nor stumble at how the duteous call
was gotten in course of nature, rather it lieth to show
how it was after-shapen in man from physical
to moral ends, and came no longer only to affirm
but sometimes even to oppose the bidding of instinct,
positing besides OUGHT the equivalent OUGHT-NOTS,
the stern forbiddances of those tables of stone
that Moses fetch&apos;d out of the thunder of Sinai.
And since we see how man&apos;s judgment of Right and Wrong
varied with educationand thatt without effect
to strenghten or weaken Duty, we conclude therefrom
that education shapeneth our moralities.
And when and whereas Conscience transfigureth the Instincts
to affection, as aforesaid, from motherly selfhood,
and to spiritual love from lust of breed, we find
Duty therewith extended in the moral field.
Thus &apos;tis (as missionaries tell) that head-hunters
who seek relish in refinement of cruelty,
will yet to soft feeling respond at gentle appeal:
my dog would do as well, coud he understand my speech.
Yet tho&apos; we see how birds in catering for their young
stint not their self-devotion, and punctiliously observe
distributiv justice; and that dutiful dogs
urged by conflicting calls wil stand awhile perplex&apos;d
in dumb deliberationne&apos;ertheless because
the true spiritual combat is unknown to brutes,
moralists teaching virtue as an end-in-itself
repudiate any sanction from motiv engaged
on animal welfare, and make utility
a cant term of reproach; tho&apos; on their higher plane
spiritual conduct is also utilitarian:
For virtue subserveth the soul&apos;s comfort and joy,
therewith al no less useful, nay more requisit
than is material comfort to our full happiness
in self-realization of perfected nature;
the which a sound doctrine of pleasure will confirm.

Denial of Use hath done our virtue wrong, while some
belittle also our Ethick, saying the subject is
of matter unknowledgeable in scientific sense,
taking contingency from the imperfection of man.
Granted, wer all men perfect, none would seek virtue;
nor should I now debate of it, but neither again
wer all omniscient, would any seek knowledge:
yet go we hunting after truth insatiably
as the Saints after holiness, who, comforted
by least attainment, persevere, Seeking the Lord
whom they hav found: and if a check or fault show more
in Ethick, &apos;tis that the hunter is on fuller cry
after true happiness than after mental truth;
or he thinketh at least to hav well nosed his desire,
and he nameth his quarry &apos;Satisfaction of soul.&apos;
Whereas the absolute Truth, whatever thatt may be,
or is, he hath not an inkling, nay nor any cause,
save in spiritual faith, ev&apos;n to hope well of it.
(&apos;Tis for such lack of stand that deep thinkers, who plot
intellectual approaches to the unknown, will lean
unconsciously upon ethick, or in the end incline
graciously to&apos;ards it.) Now any deficiency
is more discernable in an object known than in
a thing unknown to us, and in the discussion of it
ther is better likehood of agreement.

Re-reading my last post, I have to say again, &apos;just because I know what I&apos;m talking about doesn&apos;t mean anybody else does&apos;, though you must admit I&apos;m being hammered.

Perhaps my Promethean abilities are refined by Association with you, seems like every Sunday morning I sense what might happen at Saint Steven&apos;s, or not, so yesterday I felt His Grace would serve the Divine Liturgy, Fr. Norman did serve the Matins.

Walking on Water

The Disciples were in a boat&quot;in the middle of the sea, tossed by waves, for the wind was contrary. Now in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying,&quot;It is a ghost!&quot;And they cried out in fear. But immediately Jesus spoke to them , saying,&quot;Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.&quot;And Peter answered Him and said,&quot;Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.&quot;So He said,&quot;Come.&quot;And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to come to Jesus. But when he saw that the wind was boistreous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out saying,&quot;Lord, save me.&quot;And immediately Jesus streched out Hi hand and caught him, and said to him,&quot;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&quot;And when they got into the boat the wind ceased.&quot;

His Grace, Bishop Maxim, commented on the contrary wind of our doubts, how Faith is of the utmost importance on our journey to the Kingdom, and that&quot;supernatural&quot;things are available to us also. When discussing Religion, well known is &apos;I believe it when I can walk on water&apos;,&quot;When can I walk on water?&quot;Ans someone will say,&quot;When you become like Jesus.&quot;d

The AE also had Set the bringer of storms from the desert.

&quot;verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.&quot;
(Matthew 17:20)

Now, we may choose to believe that the Lord was exercising Hyperbole here and was merely speaking allegorically; I, however, choose to believe that He was speaking quite literally and was trying to give us an idea of our own natural abilities as sons and daughters of the living God.

&quot;When God so wills the natural order is overcome for He does whatsoever He wills.&quot;

The principle thing in our Spiritual life is heartfelt devotion; to stand before God with the mind in the heart. The closer we come to God, the more He can share His consciousness and His Blessings with us.

Mind over matter is the golden key.

Moving the Mountain, as I mentioned before, I once experienced years ago. How it came about I can&apos;t remember but know it wasn&apos;t in a Dream. I have been reading the Bible for many years to pluck out the Mysteries - what I thought a passage meant. For me, it&apos;s akin to reading Shakespeare, once I start I can&apos;t stop, as it is also with other inspired Writings. Perhaps I was reading the passage and my Soul responded, it was awesome and on a high plane of Consciousness as I was not aware of this &apos;reality&apos;. I remember It clearly and aspire to this Consciousness while in this World - is what this yarn is all about.

&quot;Now, practice, how to make the same thine owne&quot;, bids the Divine Poet, daily striving nearer to His Universal Mind.

The water crystals confirm the Saint&apos;s Knowledge that every prayer changes the Universe, in science it is Thought, even as sand produces patterns by Sound. In Church again and again we petition for mercy and&quot;save us by Thy Grace&quot;, and the Priest raises His hands in Prayer, I often think of the beneficent effect on the phenomenal Universe.

Mind over matter is what His Grace meant by saying that these things are available to us, using the word&quot;supernatural&quot;. Father Ceko also introduced me to Him who looked at me and said,&quot;so, it&apos;s about you&quot;, and I see a great Mind.

What I meant was by being near the Emerald City, Fr. Ceko, Fr. Norman, and His Grace are not nearly as severe in Instructions as you can be at times.

Mind over matter is the golden key.

I know indeed the difference between my insight of moving mountains and literally overcoming the natural order by sharing God&apos;s Consciousness, most marvelous and hard to believe, but Saint and Sage have so testified and demonstrated. Years ago I read that denying the very possibilty of such a feat prevents its occurrance and it kept my Mind open, as did my insight. of course, that was long ago and much has transpired since.

Generally and accepted, Mind over matter has become nothing more than forget about the situation at hand and do something else.

Among others, I found this

Curious Crucifix of Rila Monastery

&quot;one of the curious attraction of the Rila Monastery is the wooded crucifix, which took the Monk Rafail 12 years to carve during thr eighteenth century. The relic has a place of honour among the artefacts displayed in the smallish museum.

Engraved on the half-a-metre tall cross, there are 140 Biblical scenes with over 1,500 participants, some of which are the size of a rice grain. The microscopic figures cover both sides of the entire cross. The monk, in an inhuman display of patience, carved out the relic with a needle and, as a result, lost his sight.

&quot;The monastery&apos;s museum also contains interesting church plate samples, documents certifying donations from Tsarist Russia and personally from Ivan the Terrible, as well as a fingerprint mashine imported from Vienna. The images of devils trying to spoil people&apos;s good deeds may not have great artistic value, but are fun to look at.&quot;

The Crosier of the Bishop can be discerned in the Cross.

Contemplative Morning

Oh let the sun beat down my face
With stars to fill my dream.
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been.

To sit with elders of a gentle race
This world has seldom seen.
They talk of days for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed.

The entire &apos;Multiverse&apos; is an ongoing miracle
which God INTENDS into being from micro-second to micro-second. We, as sons and daughters of the living God, cooperate in the creation of the reality we then experience and interact with.

The quality of our life is determined by the degree of harmony and balance our creation of reality is in relationship to God&apos;s overarching Intentions.

Of course, the subconscious and unconscious mind, which plays a major role in this whole process of creation, can play tricks on us!

Thus, our need for a genuine, spiritual practice, as the one offered to us by the Orthodox way of life, which puts us through an ongoing and consistent process of Purification/Illumination/Deification.

On the other side of this process is another kind of reality. A multiverse of limitless creative freedom in complete balance and harmony with ALL-THAT-IS.

Have you been listening to the Dead? I think BDs lyrics. I read some of the comments below, everybody loves Jerry, listened yesterday morning to all sorts of songs.

I read your post on fb concerning dreams, &apos;reality&apos; and dreams, but these dimensions (7) are within us and there is a membrane allowing the crossover. I read that we go through these 7 dimensions unawares from idea or thought to action. the last. Remarkable is that we never see the observer of our dreams. One sentence in the song:&quot;Muttering small talk at the wall while I&apos;m in the hall&quot;, is how I feel on fb, some walls I can&apos;t access at all.

Anyway, I just want to make it to the&quot;other side&quot;Steven mentions, which I know exist.

Anyway, Don, I was wondering yesterday during work why you sent me this &apos;Vision&apos;. Was my contemplative mood contagious?

I also went back to your fb page, sorry for my snail pace, sure wish I could move like hell as J Page in that song, wonder if he was granted an Audience by the Queen when he went to Court that time.

Listened to the two songs,&quot;All my Tears Washed Away&quot;, and&quot;In The Arms Of The Angel&quot;which I love, and thought it odd that you posted them considering your disposition.

About dreams, you say that sometimes the line between this reality and the dream world is blurred. I too but rarely, when remembering something, wonder if I dreamed it or if it happened in what we call &apos;the real world&apos;, but we know that we take things from this world into our dreams and vis-a-vis, but there are 5 types of dreams.

Now I had a vivid and &apos;long&apos; dream last night about the Wedding of Chelsea Clinton, which I heard about but gave no thought to, really, so why this relatively extensive dream? In it, the Wedding Feat was not held in New York but in a House of wealthy people where I work at times.

Since they forgot to send me an Invitation I was wondering why I was there, and just when I wanted to leave I saw Chelsea coming up the stairs, hence stayed in the background so as not to be noticed. On a landing slightly above me, I watched absolutely radiant Chelsea in a beautiful white gown and veil walk on accompanied by her Mother and Father who was literally towering over and twice the size of Hillary. There were many people and He towered over all of them. How strange, I thought. Of course, many other detail were in in the dream.

Usually, a dream begins to fade shortly after waking, not this one, I see it clearly now and made such an impression that I know I will not forget it. So whence this dream since? I could not have seen it clairvoyantly since it has not yet taken place. Is Chelsea radiant with Joy and invisions her Wedding so vividly that I picked up on it 3000 miles away? And why, since I hardly minded it? I&apos;ll wait for a Photograph to see if there is any resemblance to my dream, other thoughts I keep to myself.

A great weekend to you and All

When we are in the middle of a dream, we tend to accept what we are experiencing as &apos;real&apos;. It is only when we &apos;wake up&apos; that we realize that we have been dreaming. The same can be said for our &apos;Waking life&apos;, that it is just another level of dream that we need to &apos;Wake up&apos; from.

To paraphrase Ignati Brianchininov in his description of the word,&quot;Prelest&quot;: Our fallen condition consists of&quot;Believing in mirages&quot;that we take for reality and then act accordingly.

This is a disadvantageous state to be in that we need to &apos;Wake up&apos; out of.

What a nightmare to watch just before the dawn, but I&apos;m glad that Anthony, as a boy delighting in mischief to scare people, listened to reason and became responsible. One always means more than one says.

The deserted road through the desert looks almost like Interstate 10 toward Phoenix Arizona which I drove many times, living for 3 month totally forsaken in the Harquahala Valley, but I could almost reach the Milky Way. And I hope tortured Valentine was ok after he came out of the Twilight Time Flight bathroom. It is most dangerous to loose all ordination in this world, better to live in it but not of it. I find grounding necessary lest we become like Valentine.

As to my dream of Chelsea, I looked at the Wedding photographs this morning and Her dress was just as I saw it, the Band about Her waist somewhat unclear. Of course, She would look radiant at Her Nuptial. I have had dreams where I know I was dreaming, and saw myself in dreams. Strange dreams that give a dead women leave to think and see.

I like the term&quot;subconscious security&quot;as another buffer, and the&quot;stealing of dreams&quot;, and then there is the stealing of thoughts, not really a&quot;stealing&quot;, and transferring of thoughts. Best is not to think at all in certain situations but simply being Whole, nothing wanted, nothing needed, the earthly and Divine in perfect Harmony. Complex ceatures we are while &apos;dreaming&apos; in this world, and the distance between the dreaming and the sober state is at times lightyears, others not at all.

Not that it matters much, I will go see Inception, which after all deals with and in this fallen state, and interpretation. The Divine Poet means a &apos;time&apos; before we arrive here.

INCIPIT

Before lip touches lip, ere the eyes weep,
Or hands reach out or feet run here and there,
We dream not thus, not dimly are aware,
But one with an all-knowing sentient deep&apos;
Where life is merged in Being, as the light
Of stars in day. Then once a soft enquiring
Troubles our quiet; we stir with old desiring,
And lean to earth, draw in, and lose our sight;
Tremble, and know not if with fear or bliss,
Feeling Love&apos;s wings beat near us in the night,
And closing sense and gross responsive limbs,
We, yet not we; then mused we test our might,
And with a terrible cry the spirit dims,
Desperate too late beneath our mother&apos;s kiss.

Thank you for the link Steven, hope all is well with you and your lovely Family.

Yesterday again was celebrated a Hierarchical Divine Liturgy, His Grace, Bishop Maxim serving, and graciously performing the seven step Ritual of my anointing, and it was also nice to once again hear my first name pronounced perfectly. So as not to inconvenience You, I chose the Lady V. as my Godmother for She was the first who spoke to me personally at Church.

His Grace spoke of our way to Perfection, and what it means that we should die so others may live, citing the Saints who when hearing confession took and made the sins of the People their own thus giving them Life.

The Reading from Saint Matthew was that you quote frequently, i.e., that even Faith the size of a mustard seed moves mountains.

Honored were the Fathers of the first six Ecumenical Councils; Venerable Macrina, Sister of Saint Basil the Great, Saint Steven The Tall of Serbia; and Venerable Eugenia-Euphrosynia (Princess Milica).

&quot;Now is our chance to choose the right side. God is holding back to give us that chance. It wont last forever. We must take it or leave it.&quot;

Greetings Don, Steven, Members and Guests,

Lively Board, this A bit confusing all the videos so I have to let that go.

I might begin with an experience related to the the Secrets of the Universe, the secret in this case being: how does one know something one doesn&apos;t know factually or objectively. For several weeks the thought of&quot;you should check the lights on your car&quot;crossed my mind several times, but I put it off till &apos;later&apos;.

The Experience

Early in the morning I was driving down the Boulevard and spied a Police car directly behind me. No other car in sight, I thought &apos;fine, I&apos;m the only one the Police can pay attention to. We drove a minute or so, and sure enough the lights then flashed. I pulled over, let down my window and while He got out I looked for my Licence, Insurance etc.

I looked up and there stood a COP with the brightest smile you can imagine:

P.&quot;How are you today?&quot;

&quot;I am good, thank you, how are you?&quot;

P. Good too, thank you. I suppose you are not one of the most wanted in this Country?&quot;

&quot;No, not yet&quot;, and handed him my Licence and Insurance. Opening my glove compartment, I said:&quot;I&apos;m looking for my Registration.&quot;

P.&quot;Never mind&quot;, the bright smile never left His face.

&quot;Why did you stop me?&quot;

P.&quot;Because you were doing &apos;almost&apos; 50 in 35 mile zone and your brake light is out.&quot;

Er, I thought, here goes $400, but the 50 is a bit &apos;iffy&apos; for I was going pretty slow relative to my usual speed, and He did say &apos;almost&apos;, but I must have tapped my brakes when I saw Him behind me or He wouldn&apos;t have known my light was out.

I asked:&quot;Is it the left or right light?&quot;

P.&quot;No, the one in the middle.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I forgot I had a middle brake light?&quot;And both of us cracked up laughing.

P.&quot;Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m not going to give you a ticket, just a warning.&quot;

&quot;Ah you are so nice, you just made my day!&quot;

Had I been out of my car I would have embraced Him with a light kiss on the cheek, which He knew.

&quot;Are we finished?&quot;

P.&quot;Yes, have a good day!&quot;

You too, Sir, and thank you!&quot;

I backed up and He got out of the car again:

&quot;Wait! Wait! Your backup light is out as well.&quot;

&quot;The left or right?&quot;

His smile as bright as before and I couldn&apos;t stop laughing either. I shall have them fixed post heste, I promised, and did the next day.

This &apos;chance&apos; happening early in the morning was wonderful and the moments in Time of our naturally cheerful interaction so real for both of us, delighting our day and some more time. Perhaps we&apos;ll pass each other again on the streets or at a stoplight, smiling, remembering, and re-connecting in the Realms of Good Will to Mankind. Should it so happen, I would tell the Officer of the silent voice hinting about checking the lights of my car.

Smile truly, and you might get away with it.

Repeated for continuity

Altho&apos; good disposition (as Aristotle hath it)
may be by beauty educated, and aspire
to theoretic wisdom (as Plato would teach)
And Ethick therewithal claim honor of the same rank
that ideal philosophy ascribeth to man,
yet, if for lack of faith he sink that claim, I see
a thing of hap without place in Reality.
On one hand is&apos;t deny&apos;d that term of Right or Wrong
are wholly pertinent to man&apos;s condition on earth;
nor that, whatever his destiny might be, his origin
was bestial and his first ethick a rudiment,
that shifting ever and shaping in the story of man
at every time is the index of his growth in grace;
and, if the change of custums that the herd adopt
for comfort and to insure what they most value in life,
hath moral tendency upward, then thatt tendency is
the animal sanction of virtue, and will take honor as such.

But Duty instill&apos;d with order is so almighty of kind
that &apos;twill make Law of Habit, whence all social codes
outlast their turn and time, and in arrear of life
hold the common folk backward from their nobler vaunt, logging and dragging, whether as a garment outgrown
tatter&apos;d and foolish, or as strong fetters and chains
wherein they lie fast-bound in misery and iron. 
Hence cometh all the the need and fame of TEACHERS, men
of inborn nobility, call&apos;d Prophets of God,
Saviours of society, Seers of the promised land,
thatt white filleted company that Aeneas found
circled around Musaeus in the Elysian fields,
the loved and lovable whose names liv evermore,
the sainted pioneers of salvation, unto whom
all wisdom won and all man&apos;s future hope is due;
and with inspiration of their ampler air we see
our Ethick split up shear and sharply atwain; two kinds
diverse in kind ther be; the one of social need,
lower, stil holding backward in the clutch of earth,
from old animal bondage unredeem&apos;d; the other
higher and spiritual, that by personal affiance
with beauty hath made escape, soaring away to where
the Ring of Being closeth in the Vision of God.

A noteworthy reading in mystical language from the Church Bulletin

The Holy Apostle Paul to the Corinthians

&quot;Brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached - unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve. After that he was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep. After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles. Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time. For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.&quot;

By falling asleep the Church denotes dying.

&quot;He died not for men, but for each man. If each man had been the only man made, He would have done no less.&quot;

Today, the Church Calendar marks

The Tranfiguration of Christ

&quot;Jesus has gone with his disciples Peter, James, and John to Mount Tabor. Christ&apos;s appearance was changed while the watched into a glorious radiant figure.

&quot;This event shows forth the divinity of Christ, so that the disciples would understand after his Ascension that He was truly the radiant splendor of the Father, and that his Passion was voluntary. It also shows the possibility of our own theosis.&quot;

The last sentence is what this thread is all about, becoming gods in our own right:

&quot;In the narrative, after the voice speaks, Elijah and Moses have disappeared, and Jesus and the three apostles head down the mountain, Jesus telling the his apostles to keep the event a secret until the&quot;Son of Man&quot;had risen from the dead. The apostles are described as questioning what Jesus meant by&quot;risen from the dead&quot;- The apostles are also described as questioning Jesus about Elijah, and he as responding&quot;Elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things; but I tell you that Elijah has already come. It was commonly believed that Elijah would reappear before the coming of the Messiah, as predicted in the Book of Malachi.&quot;

Remembering also that Elijah ascending to Heaven in His chariot, dropped His Mantle to Elisha.

&quot;Maximus the Confessor said that the senses of the apostles were likewise transfigured to enable them to perceive the true glory of Christ.&quot;

Necessarely so, reminds me of the Pyramid Champ saying, that the people dressed in white you see sometimes during the night on the Giza Plateau&quot;make you like them and you can see them.&quot;

Traditions

&quot;In Greece and Romania the harvest season traditionally began on the Transfiguration. Grapes, in particular, were not eaten before August 6. In some parishes, the first grapes would be brought to church for blessing and distributed to the parishioners.&quot;

TRANSFIGURATION Thursday, August 19, 2010

ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 8TH DAY

&quot;A knowledge of the beginning and end of all things is essential for us to understand the purpose of our existence here on this earth, and what lies beyond it. For a true interpretation of the first and last things, we must turn to those teachers who beheld the beginning and end in a state of divine vision. Among these great seers was St. Symeon the New Theologian (949-1022): he speaks of the mysteries of the beginning and end precisely because he has seen them.
St. Symeon&apos;s profound homilies on Adam and the future age give the theological foundation for the Christian life of struggle. The original state of man from which Adam fell tells of our deepest nature, of which our present fallen nature is a corruption that is to be overcome; and the future state of blessedness is the goal to which our Christian struggle is aimed, and to which we can attain, by God&apos;s grace, despite our fallen state.&quot;(From the introduction to&quot;First Created Man&quot;)

St. Symeon The New Theologian:
&quot;God, in the beginning, before He planted Paradise and gave it over to the first-created ones, in five days set in order the earth and what is in it. And on the sixth day He created Adam and placed him as lord and king of the whole visible creation. Then there was not yet Paradise. But this world was from God a kind of Paradise, although it was material and sensuous. God gave it over to the authority of Adam and all his descendants.&quot;(Genesis 1:26-31)

Here, St. Symeon goes on to describe what life would have been like for us had we not transgressed the commandment of God and become subject to corruption and death:
&quot;If now, after we transgressed the commandment and were condemned to die, people have so multiplied, then just imagine how many there would have been if all those born from the creation of the world had not died! And what kind of life they would have lived, being immortal and incorrupt, strangers to sin, sorrows and cares, and difficult necessities! And how, prospering in the keeping of the commandments and the good ordering of the dispositions of the heart, in time they would have ascended into the most perfect glory, and being changed, would have drawn near to God; and the soul of each one would have become light-bearing by reason of the illuminations which would have been poured out upon it from the Divinity! And this sensuous and crudely material body would have become as it were immaterial and spiritual, above all senses; and the joy and rejoicing with which we would then have been filled by fellowship one with the other, in truth would have been unutterable and beyond human thought.&quot;

Do you see if how we had not disobeyed the commandment, God would have raised us up directly into the Kingdom of Heaven from Paradise without having to go through this detour of the fallen world?&quot;But let us return again to our subject:
And thus God gave over to Adam this whole world which had been created by Him in six days. (Genesis 1:31, 2:2, 2:7) After He had created everything else, and made man also, and rested on the seventh day from all the works He had begun to do-He planted Paradise in Eden in the east as a Royal dwelling, and led into it as a king the man whom He had made.

But why did not God put in order Paradise on the seventh day, but planted it in the east only after He had finished all the rest of creation? Because He, as the foreknower of everything, arranged the whole creation in order and in an orderly sequence, and He assigned seven days that they might be an image of the ages which were subsequently to pass in time. But Paradise He planted after those seven days, that it might be an image of the future age. But why did the Holy Spirit not place the eighth day together with the seven days in the count? Because it was unfitting to place within the count the eighth together with the seven, for they, moving cyclically, produce so many weeks, years and centuries, but it was proper that the eighth day be placed outside the seven, since it does not have any cyclic movement.&quot;(But lasts forever.)

Do you see why we, as Orthodox Christians no longer keep the Hebrew Sabbath on Saturday, but rather celebrate the Resurrection of Christ, as the promise of the future age of incorruption for ourselves as well, on Sunday, which is both, the first and the eighth day of the week at one and the same time?

God planted Paradise&quot;With various fruits which never spoiled and never ceased, but were always fresh and sweet and furnished for the first-created ones great satisfaction and pleasantness. For it was fitting to furnish also an incorruptible enjoyment for these bodies of these first-created ones, which were incorrupt. Therefore their life also in Paradise was not burdened with labors and not weighted down with misfortunes. Adam was made with a body that was incorrupt, although material and not yet spiritual, and was placed by the Creator God as an immortal king over an incorrupt world, not only over Paradise, but also over the whole of creation which was under the heavens.&quot;

&quot;God gave the first-created ones a commandment, and commanded them not to taste of the tree of knowledge (of good and evil) alone; but Adam disdained this commandment of God, not believing the words of the creator...he tasted of that tree. Therefore he was immediately stripped of that incorrupt garment of glory, and was clothed in the nakedness of corruption...And thus it was fitting in all justice for the one who had become corruptible and mortal by reason of the transgression of the commandment, to live upon the corruptible earth and be nourished by corruptible food;
(Therefore, &apos; the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope&apos;...)
for since a life without labor and an abundant food which grew by itself had caused him to forget God and the good things which He had given him and to disdain His commandment, he was therefore justly condemned to work the earth in the sweat of labor and in this way receive food from it little by little as from some kind of steward.

Adam was banished from Paradise, ( &apos;lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:&apos; thereby being confirmed in that fallen state,) lived, begat children and died. And this was the way it was with all those also who came from him.&quot;

&quot;And behold, as you see, the sentence of God remains forever as an eternal chastisement. And all of us men became both corruptible and mortal, and there is nothing that might set aside this great and frightful sentence. And when there is no possibility to set aside this sentence, then what benefit is there in wisdom or in wealth, or in power, or in the whole world? For this reason the Almighty Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, came so as to humble Himself in place of Adam.&quot;

&quot;But I beg you to heed my words, because they begin now to touch upon a most great mystery, the explanation of which is soul-profiting both for us and for those who will live after us. It befits us now to ascend to the contemplation of the Incarnation of the Son and Word of God, and His unutterable birth from the Ever-Virgin Mother of God Mary. We must do this by means of some kind of image, and through it draw near to the understanding of the mystery hidden from the ages of the economy of the Incarnation, for the salvation of our race. Just as then, at the creation of our ancestor Eve, God took the rib of Adam and made the woman from it, in the same way now also our Maker and Creator God took flesh from the Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, as a kind of leaven and a certain beginning from the dough of our nature, and united it with His Divinity, which is unattainable and unapproachable- or, to say it better, He united His whole Divine Hypostasis essentially with our nature, and this human nature He joined without confusion to His essence and made it His own, so that the very Creator of Adam became unchangingly and unalterably perfect man. For just as from the rib of Adam He made woman, so from the daughter of Adam, the Ever-Virgin Mother of God Mary, He borrowed the virginal flesh without seed, and being clothed in it, became man like unto the first-created Adam, so as to accomplish this work, namely: just as Adam, through the transgression of the commandment of God was the cause of the fact that all men became corruptible and mortal, so also Christ, the new Adam, through the fulfillment of all justice, became the first fruit of our rebirth into incorruption and immortality.

And inasmuch as our Lord Jesus Christ became perfect man in soul and body, like us in everything except sin, so He gives of His Divinity to us also who believe in Him, and makes us like to Him in the nature and essence of His Divinity. Reflect on this most wondrous mystery: the Son of God received from us flesh, which He did not have by nature, and became man, which He was not, and to those who believe in Him He communicates of His Divinity, which no man ever had in any way,-and these believers become gods by grace.&quot;

The Feast of the Transfiguration is God&apos;s promise to us that, we too, who have lost our first-created, Divinely woven garments, will be restored to our original blessed state and clothed round about once again by the Glory of God. By His saving economy, He makes a way for us to become, &apos;Partakers of the Divine nature.&apos; (2d Peter 1:4)

&quot;Thus every saint is as we have said; but their bodies do not become immediately incorruptible and spiritual. Rather, just as iron that has been ignited by fire becomes a partaker of the brightness of fire, putting aside its natural darkness, and as soon as the fire goes out of it and it grows cold, it becomes again dark, so is it also with the bodies of the saints: when they are partakers of that Divine fire, that is, the grace of the Holy Spirit which fills their souls, they are sanctified, and being penetrated with that Divine fire, they are bright, distinct from all other bodies and more honorable than they; but when the soul goes out of the body, then their bodies are given over to corruption, and some decay little by little and become dust, while others do not decay for the course of many years, and are not either completely incorrupt or again completely corrupt, but preserve in themselves traces both of corruption and incorruption, until they receive perfect incorruption and are renewed by the perfect resurrection at the time of the general resurrection of the dead.

And for what reason is this? For this reason: it is not fitting for the bodies of men to be clothed in the glory of the resurrection and to become incorrupt before the renewal of all creatures. But just as in the beginning, first the whole creation was created incorrupt, and then from it man was taken and made, so also it is fitting that again first all the creation should become incorrupt, and then the corruptible bodies of men also should be renewed and become incorrupt, so that once more the whole man might be incorrupt and spiritual and might dwell in an incorruptible, Eternal and spiritual dwelling. Thus:&quot;The earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.&quot;(Romans8:19-21)

And that this is true, listen to what the Apostle Peter says:&quot;But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot;(2nd Peter 3:10-13) This does not mean that the heavens and the elements will disappear, but that they will be reordered and renewed, and will come into a better and incorruptible condition.&quot;

&quot;But let us see how the creation is to be renewed and come again into the condition of its original beauty. I suppose that there is not a single Christian who will think to disbelieve the words of the Lord who gave the promise to make the heaven new and the earth new, that is, that just as our own bodies, which are now dissolved into the elements but still are not turned into nothingness, again are to be renewed through the resurrection,-so also the heaven and the earth with all that is in them, that is, the whole creation, is to be renewed and to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and these elements together with us will become partakers of the brightness proceeding from the Divine fire. Just as a bronze vessel that has become old and useless, becomes new again when a metal-worker melts it in the fire and recasts it, in the same way also the creation, having become old and useless because of our sins, will be as it were melted in the fire by God the creator and recast, and will appear new, incomparably brighter than it is now.&quot;

&quot;What is the bright condition the whole creation is again to receive? You should know likewise what is to be the glory and the brightly- shining state of the creation of the future age. For when it will be renewed, it will not again be the same as it was when it was created in the beginning. But it will be such as our body will also be. Concerning our body the Apostle says:&quot;It is sown a natural body, but is raised,&quot;not as the body of the first-created one was before the transgression of the commandment, that is, material, sensuous, changeable, having need of sensuous food, but&quot;it is raised a spiritual body&quot;(1st Corinthians 15:44) And unchanging, such as was the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, the second Adam, after the resurrection, He being the first-born from among the dead, which body was incomparably superior to the body of the first-created Adam. In the same way also the whole creation, according to the commandment of God, is to be, after the general resurrection, not such as it was created, material and sensuous, but it is to be re-created and to become a certain immaterial and spiritual dwelling, surpassing every sense.&quot;

&quot;Thus the whole creation, after it will be renewed and become spiritual, will become a dwelling which is immaterial, (Which is to say, no longer subject to the laws of physics we are now familiar with) incorruptible, unchanging, and eternal...Having become spiritual and Divine, it will become united with the noetic world; it will be a certain mental Paradise, a Heavenly Jerusalem, the inalienable inheritance of the sons of God. Such an earth has not been inherited as yet by a single man; we are all strangers and foreigners. But when the earthly will be united with the Heavenly, then also the righteous will inherit that already renewed earth.

Now, for the time being, some of the earthly is being united with the Heavenly, and some is yet to be united with it. The souls of the saints, as we have said, even though they are still united with the body in this world, are united with the grace of the Holy Spirit, are renewed, are changed for the better and resurrected from mental death. Later, after separation from the body, they will depart into glory and into the unsetting brightly-shinning light. Their bodies, however, are not yet vouchsafed this, but remain in the tombs in corruption. But they also are to become incorruptible during the general resurrection, when also all this visible and sensuous creation will become incorruptible, and will be united with the Heavenly and invisible.&quot;As it is written and was spoken by the Apostle Paul,concerning those who remain alive until the consummation of all things,&quot;Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?&quot;(1st Corinthians 15:51-55)

&quot;Thus, The Kingdom of Heaven will be one, will have a single king over all, who will be visible from everywhere to all the righteous, He will remain with each of the righteous, and each of the righteous will remain with Him; He will brightly shine in each one, and each one will brightly shine in Him.&quot;

Happy Feast Day!

In daily life also is a simple, but not exact parallel, ie, we discard what has become old and useless, very few people would yet have and wear apparel from even thirty years ago, think and live as we did 28 years ago. Our mental constitution and cells of our body change every 7 years, yet never abruptly, but one phase&quot;merges&quot;into the next, or the evening of one day and the morning of the next are the same. The 7 days of Creation and and 7 stages of cell devision are identical, comparable to God the foreknower of everything arranging the whole creation in order and orderly sequence. Fern would say the only disorder and missing link is in our dumb heads.

Part of the soul&apos;s immortal life
As drops are of the sea.

Though wending on their lonely way
Or in the crowded mart,

They, ne&apos;er forget the love that set
its signet on their heart.

Love! the whitest rose of heaven,
The fairest charm to earth that&apos;s given;
Light of the soul, celestial flame!
Touched by live coal I&apos;d speak thy name;
Dwell ever in my heart as young
As when creation&apos;s song was sung,
And God with man at evening talked,
And midst the trees of Eden walked.
Thy starry chain is ever bright,
Its links are bars of rosy light,
The cunning work of angel hands,
Nor time nor space can loose its bands.

And noble galleries of art,

Oh, Raphael inspired!
Many Madonnas I have seen,
But thine the most admired!

Hour after hour I&apos;ve watched each grace
Unfolding beauty rare,
And every moment I could trace
Some lurking wonder there.

I&apos;ve wandered round the Parthenon,
On Athens classic hills,
And drank the snows of Lebanon
Flowing in crystal rills.

And where the lofty Pyramids
Arose with stately pride,
In sacred dread I bowed my head,
An infant by their side.

And I have roamed o&apos;er Ireland green,
And by the Lakes Killarney,
At the old castle I have seen
And kissed that stone, the &apos;Blarney.&apos;

Of all that thou hast given me,
We hear the Saviour say,
I have lost nothing, but will raise
It up at the last day.

And evermore the immortal soul,
Its jewel shall enshrine,
And all the sweet affinities
That here our hearts entwine.
There prattling tongues to us will tell
The glories of Emanuel!
What then, will our employment be.
We may iict lift the veil to see.

To serve our God with all our might,
And find in Him our chief delight,
&apos;Tis heaven upon the earth below,
And will be heaven when hence we go.
Pursuits, as various as our thought,
will doubless to our hand will brought,
And faith which bears us on its wings, ....

A good week to All

The other;
higher and spiritual, that by personal affiance
with beauty had math made its escape, soaring away to where
the Ring of Being closeth in the Vision of God.

Sticklers for equality will hear nought of this,
arguing that social is but a past-personal,
personal a future-social, tenses of one verb,
 the amatum and amabo on the stem of &apos;love,&apos;
virtue&apos;s pure nativ stock which hath no need of graft;
a doctrine kindly at heart, that cajoleth alike
diffidence of the ruler and conceit of the crowd,
who in collusion float its credit; and awhile
their ship of state runneth like the yacht in the race
that with full bellying sail, for lack of seamanship,
seemeth to forge ahead while it loseth leeway.

No Politick admitteth nor did ever admit
the teacher into confidence: nay ev&apos;n the Church,
with hierarchy in conclave compassing to install
Saint Peter in Csar&apos;s chair, and thereby win for man
the promises for which they had loved and worship&apos;d Christ,
relax&apos;d his heave/nly code to strech her temporal rule.
For social Ethick with its legalized virtue
is but in true semblance, alike for praise or blame,
a friendly domestication of man&apos;s old wolf-foe,
the adaptable subservient gentlemanly dog,
beneath groom&apos;d coat and collar in his passion unchanged.

Thus &apos;tis that levelers, deeming all ethick one,
and for being Socialists thinking themselves Teachers,
can preach class-hatred as the enlighten&apos;d gospel of love;
but should they look to find firm scientific ground,
whereon to found their creed in the true history
of social virtue and of its progress hitherto,
&apos;twill be with them in their research, as &apos;twas with him
who yesteryear sat down in Mesopotamy
to dig out Abram&apos;s birthplace in the lorn grave-yard
of Asian monarchies;and low hummocks of dust
betray where legendary cities lie entomb&apos;d
Chaldan KISH and UR; while for all life today
poor nomads, with their sparse flotilla of swarthy tents
and slow sand-faring camels, cruise listlessly o&apos;erhead,
warreners of the waste: Now this man duly unearth&apos;d
the walls whence Terah flitted, but beneath those walls
more walls, and the elder builings of a dynasty
of wider rule than Abram knew, a nation extinct
ere he was born: where-thru&apos; sinking deeper their shafts
the diggers came yet never on virgin soil, but still
wondering on earlier walls, arches and masonry,
a city and folk undremt of in archology,
trodden-under ere any story of man began;

a city and folk undreamt of in archaeology,
trodden-under ere any story of man began; and there,
happening on the king&apos;s tomb, they shovel&apos;d from the dust
the relics of thatt old monarch&apos;s magnificence
Drinking vessels of beaten silver or of glean gold,
vases of alabaster, obsidian chalices,
cylinder seals of empire and delicate gems
of personal adornment, ear-rings and finger-rings,
craftman&apos;s tools copper and golden, and for music a harp;
withal in silver miniature his six-oar&apos;d skiff,
a model in build and trim of such as ply today
Euphrates&apos; flowery marshes: all his earthly toys
gather&apos;d to him in his grave, that he might nothing lack
in the unknown life beyond, but find ready to hand
his jewel&apos;d dice and gaming board and chamber-lamp,
his toilet-box of paints and unguentsTherefore &apos;twas
the chariot of his pride whereon he still would ride
was buried with him; there lay yet the enamel&apos;d film
of the inlaid perish&apos;d wood, and all the metal gauds
that had emboss&apos;d the rail: animal masks in gold,
wild bulls and lions, and twin-figured on the prow
great panther-heads to glare in silver o&apos;er the course,
impatient of their spring: and one rare master-work
whose grace the old warrier wist not should outliv the name
and fame of all his mighty doings, when he set it up
thatt little nativ donkey, his mascot on the pole.

&apos;Twas he who dug told me of these things and how,
finding himself a housebreaker in the home of men
who sixty hundred years afore, when they left life,
had seal&apos;d their tombs from sacrilege and there had lain,
til from their secresy of their everlasting sleep
he had torn the coverlethis spirit, dazed awhile
in wonder, suddenly was strick&apos;n with great horror;
for either side the pole, where lay the harness&apos;d bones
of the yoke-mated oxen, there beside their bones
lay the bones of the grooms, and slaughter&apos;d at their post
all their king&apos;s body-guard, each liegeman spear in hand,
in sepulchred attention; and whereby lay the harp
the arm-bones of the player, as there she had pluck&apos;d her dirge,
lay mingled with its fragments; her sisterly audience
whose lavish ear-pendants and gold-filleted hair,
the uniform decoration of their young service,
marked them for women of the harem, sacrificed
to accompany their lord, the day when he seth forth
to enter into the presence of the scepter&apos;d shades
congregated with splendour in the mansions of death.

Yesterday, the Church, in a Divine Hierarchical Liturgy, meaning His Grace, Bishop Maxim served, honored the Serbian Saints, of Whom there is much writ on this thread.

Due to on and off ramp closures of Freeways leading one knows not where, this nerve-racking ordeal I described once, I ended up in Pico Rivera, but saw a Police Officer who pointed me in the right direction. I so don&apos;t like to be late for any date, and thought if I just make it in time when the Holy Book is offered for Veneration it will be ok, and Lo, I walked into the Cathedral and straightly joined the other People walking toward the Holy Book, held by Father Norman, and Blessing by His Grace. Walking back to my usual place, I calmed down.

The gentle and wise words of Saint Paul:

&quot;Brethren, we then, as workers together with Him also plead with you not to receive the grace of God in vain. For He says,&quot;In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in the day of salvation I have helped you.&quot;Behold, now is the the day of salvation. We give no offence in anything, that our ministry may not be blamed. But in all things we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much patience, in tribukations, in needs, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonment, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fasting; by purity, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love, by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown , and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.&quot;

The last words remind me of George Harrison&apos;s,&quot;All I have is yours, all you see is mine&quot;.

His Grace commented briefly on the Gospel reading of St. Matthew,&quot;For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.&quot;

A perfect example as applicable in As above so Below: in the Gospel, the Man who had five talents traded with them and made more, the one who had only one talent buried it and made no interest. Everyone knows, that below, rich people get richer because of investments and interest, whereas poor people have to spend what they have on daily living. And so it is with Spiritual Currency, when one adds to what one has one acquires more, if not, even the little one has peters out.

&quot;Aim at Heaven and you will get Earth thrown in. Aim at Earth and you get neither.&quot;

Steven, if You read this, when receiving the Blessed Bread at the End, His Grace smiled at me and said&quot;Steven&quot;. I leave it at thatt, to borrow the significance of &apos;thatt&apos; from the Divine Poet.

Waiting for lunch, the German Lady I. and I discussed alternative routes to get us to the Church on time. She said that on the way a few days before she was so confounded by even the first off ramp closure, and knowing what would happen, She turned around and went home again, LOL we did.

Leave Tigris now and Ur.Seek out Aryan race
by Gunga and Hydaspes in the teaming realm
when Sakya Muni preach&apos;d of gentleness and love,
and took divinity before Christ came: see how
at every Rajah&apos;s pyre, in Punjab or Kashmire,
in Vijayanogar, Kalikata and Udaipur,
for life-long centuries the mild Hindus hav burnt
their multitudinous girl-concubines alive,
and still beneath our lax imperial rule wil deem
any honest outlawry of their ritual Suttee
a tyrannous impiety of our western manners;
which none the less withheld not of our island kings
the last Henry, styled first Defender of the Faith,
from slaying his wives at will; nor was he for such crimes
less esteemed of the folk; altho&apos; judged as a man
by pagan ethick ir christian or by the insight
of poet or historian, more despicable
than we need to suppose thatt old monarch of Ur.

See how cross-eyed the pride of our world-wide crusade
against Nigerian slavery, while the London poor 
in their Victorian slums lodged closer and filthier

our Industry is worse fed and shut out from the sun.
In every age and nation a like confusion is found.

 IF DUTY held us long, now as in the old adage
PLEASURE may follow after, taking like second rank
in Plato&apos;s myth, as I twist it: wherein we traced
DUTY from the selfhood of individual life
growing to reach communion with the eternal;
while in the younger horse was pleasur intensified
by love, untill it issueth in the love of God.
And yet hath pleasure truly its main stronghold in Self,
because the greatest pleasure that man knoweth, is aye
the pleasure of life, even as his chief displeasure is death.

Sunday last, St. Steven&apos;s was hosting the annual Parish Festival,
Serbian music, dance, food and drink. The Serbs know how to celebrate!

In our Church Bulletin are a few intersting articles.

Mary in Eastern Liturgy

&quot;If Christ is the new Adam, Mary is often referred to as the new Eve... It is Mary who, by her total obediance, restores something absolutely essential in the order of creation...Mary is not the representative of the women or women before God, she is the icon of the entire creation, the whole mankind as response to Christ and to God...Being the heart of the new creation, Mary is the icon of Christ. The Church is institution and the Church is life...The Church is an eternal&quot;passage&quot;- from the old into the new, from this world into the Kingdom of God. It is difficult to define this life, but those who live it, be it only imperfectly, know that its perfect expression, its very&quot;movement,&quot;is Mary.&quot;

Did You Know?

What is Apostolic Succession?

&quot;Apostolic succession is the means by which Christ has passed on the Church, responsibility, authority and power for the continuation of His saving work through the Apostles, their successors, the bishops, and the clergy in general. The continuation of this succession is maintained through the bishops of the Church. They do the work of the Apostles. Their commission goes back to the Apostles. Historically and sacramentally each bishop can trace back his ordination to the Apostles. They have received the Holy Spirit through which they have the spiritual power to do the Lord&apos;s work in the Church. The bishop guarantees the orthodoxy and canonicity of the local Church, and together with the other bishops in synods, he is the voice of the Church as it speaks to the faithful and to the world.&quot;

Father Ceko spoke of loving God with our Heart, to forget our reading of this and the other, moving only our lips, but to pray with our Heart to God about anything and everything, which was good for me to hear because I have been doing this for years.

Quote of the Day

&quot;A man can no more diminish God&apos;s glory by refusing to worship Him than a lunatic can put out the sun by scribbling the word &apos;darkness&apos; on the walls of his cell.&quot;

 If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung,
Would you hear my voice come thru the music,
Would you hold it near as it were your own?

It&apos;s a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken,
Perhaps they&apos;re better left unsung.
I don&apos;t know, don&apos;t really care
Let there be songs to fill the air.

Ripple in still water,
When there is no pebble tossed,
Nor wind to blow.

Reach out your hand if your cup be empty,
If your cup is full may it be again,
Let it be known there is a fountain,
That was not made by the hands of men.

There is a road, no simple highway,
Between the dawn and the dark of night,
And if you go no one may follow,
That path is for your steps alone.

Ripple in still water,
When there is no pebble tossed,
Nor wind to blow.

You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone,
If you should stand then who&apos;s to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home.
